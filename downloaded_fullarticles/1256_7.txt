    <p>Prologue</p><p>Laughter rang out of the open second floor window in the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>old brick building near the corner of Diagon Alley and Dumbledore Lane. A chilly gust of wind rattled the ornate wooden sign that hung above the large red door below. Letters that looked to be made of liquid silver shimmered in the twilight and spelled out the words: Heroes Detective Agency- By Appointment Only. Witches and wizards bustled past the window, a quick glance upward with the hope that they would catch a peek of the boy who lived hard at work. They moved onward with hushed whispers and continued to finish their shopping before stores closed for the evening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>A large brown barn owl flew gracefully through the open window with a soft hoot, as the final traces of sunlight faded to darkness. The warm glow of the fire casted shadows of five people seated around a large wooden table. It was filled with scattered papers and empty dishes. The owl came to rest on a large perch beside the table as the group laughed again louder than before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>They had just wrapped up their latest case file on a rare magical beast that had attacked muggles and wizards alike across London. Draco placed his quill on the table, the ink left to dry on the final page of a long report to the Ministry of Magic. As he rolled up the documents and placed them in the large tube tied to the owl’s leg, flames in the fire place behind him flashed from a warm orange to a bright blue which indicated a message was about to come through.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>A paper airplane flew through the blue flames and was snatched out of the air with superb agility born from Harry’s seeker days at Hogwarts. He sat down in the plush armchair next to the fire as it returned to it’s original orange hue. He unfolded the tanned parchment and quickly scanned the message.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It was from Rupert Giles, an old Watcher friend who had recently moved back to the states.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The message stated that the HEROES were needed to investigate supernatural activity in a small California town. Magical creatures and muggles have disappeared in the woods that surrounded the town. He believed that Harry and his team were the town’s best chance of solving the mystery and asked if they could free up some time and come out to California. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry read the message to the group and put the question to each of them in turn if they were interested in taking on a new international project. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Well I think it must be serious if Giles has asked for our help” Draco remarked, “He is a very good Watcher and has dealt with a lot of supernatural problems when he was stationed in Sunnydale<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a few years ago. I trust his judgement. If he has asked for our help, then count me in.” He stood up to send off the owl out of the window to the Ministry of Magic.</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded to Draco and gave him a small smile. He then turned to Fred and waited for his thoughts on the matter.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry, you know I am always up for adventure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have never been to California. I am in!” Fred exclaimed with enthusiasm. He folded his arms behind his head as he leaned back in his chair balanced on it’s two back legs, precariously close to tipping point.</p><p> </p><p>Harry, a bigger smile spread across his face, winked at Fred , knowing that his carefree friend had never been one to take a long time to make decisions. Harry turned to Neville who sat quietly next to him.</p><p> </p><p>“I have always wanted to study the plants in the Reserve, the magical woods that surrounded the town of Beacon Hills. It has always been my desire to study the rare magical plants there. I vote yes.” Neville said his voice tinged with excitement.</p><p> </p><p>Harry patted Neville on the shoulder as he quickly scribbled a list while he mumbled a word that sounded oddly like sequoia, whatever that meant. He turned to face Luna who sat on his other side and was met with an intense stare of the blonde woman who stared back at Harry with great intensity that made him feel she could see through to his soul.</p><p> </p><p>“Well” Luna drawled out the word slowly like she was deep in thought, “If Giles said that something has attacked creatures and muggles, then it must be some kind of magical creature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that we are needed.” Luna said with a far off look on her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Ok then its agreed” Harry stated with authority. He grabbed a quill from the stack of papers in front of him and said “I will inform Giles that we will be there by the end of the week,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That will give Neville time to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>finish the Venetian Water Vine case and Draco can testify before the Wizenmagot on the Lastrange case.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>In the mean time everyone should pack<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>what you need to take to America for a couple of months at least. Fred you are in charge of packing the surveillance equipment and whatever else you can think of.” Harry said and scribbled a few things on a piece of parchment. “Oh, Neville, who will take care of your greenhouse while you are away?”</p><p> </p><p>“That won’t be a problem Harry.” Neville said and looked up from his long list. “I am going to bring it with me.”Nevillemstated to the group, like the answer should have been obvious to them all. “ Hermione created a spell that will allow me to shrink them back to seed form and then when I get to a new location I just have to plant them and reverse the spell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They will return to their original size in about a day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is what I did when I traveled to Albania and investigated the village that was being plagued by the paralyzing mold.”</p><p> </p><p>“Neville, I had no idea Hermione could invent spells like that! I would have had her in the joke shop working on product development” Fred said and looked at Neville in amazement.</p><p> </p><p>“I have been trying to get Hermione to join the Agency for ages, but I don’t think she will ever leave the ministry, she loves her work in Goblins Relations. “ Harry said with a small sigh, and glanced at Fred while he folded his letter into an airplane shape. “Well I think that about does it” He said and smoothed out the last fold. He raised his wand and waved it towards the flames and shouted ”Fuga Ignis” The flames turned from orange to blue and Harry threw the paper airplane into it where it disappeared in a flash of blue flames.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“It’s late, why don’t you all go home and get packed. I’ll clean up around here. We’ll leave on Thursday after Draco is done at the Ministry. I will arrange for an international portkey. Good job everyone on the hard work you put did to have this case solved so quick” Harry said and looked at each of them with adoration in his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco, Neville, and Fred gave him a pat on the back as they made their way out the door. Luna hugged and kissed him on the cheek.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Goodnight Harry, Go home and get some sleep.” She said and followed the men out the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry looked around at the cozy office the five of them shared and thought about how lucky he was to work with his friends. He circled through the room and straightened the mess that was scattered about the table and floor, as he did his eyes drifted to a group of framed photos sitting on a round side table next to the coziest sofa by the fire. He filled his mug with tea and sat down on the sofa. He picked up the largest framed photo that showed five moving figures jostling each other forward to a golden podium to accept their award of Order of Merlin First Class. He leaned back and reminisced about how the Heroes Detective Agency had come about just two short years ago.</p><p> </p><p>After the war, Harry had quickly accelerated through the Auror training program. He quickly rose through the ranks of the Ministry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Though he was excited about cases, he missed his work with Ron and Hermione and the adventures they shared in their schooldays leading up to the war.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He became restless in his job and longed for the feeling of freedom he had when they hunted horicruxes together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In his three years at the Ministry, he had not grown particularly close to any of the other Aurors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were all nice, and treated him well, but it seemed like they still thought of him as ‘The Boy Who Lived’ rather than just plain Harry, the Auror.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His small circle of friends were the only ones who treated him as normal bloke.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry found that there was one other person whose company he started to value...Draco Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>A year after the war ended, Draco’s father died in Azkaban and his mother joined him in death two months later. Draco had lost all of his family and friends during the course of the year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His friends that were loyal to Voldemort’s cause were either stuck in Azkaban or had turned their backs on him when he testified against his father and several escaped death eaters. Harry remembered how deep into depression Draco had spiraled in those days. It was during that time, on a dark stormy evening when Harry showed up on his doorstep with a bottle of fire whiskey in hand, and a sly smile on his face. ‘’I thought you could use some company tonight” and Draco let him in. They discussed the past, and mistakes they made, and the present and how life had taken them off course from where they thought they would be. It was years later before Harry found out that he saved Draco’s life that night with his simple act of compassion. Draco and Harry’s relationship slowly grew from enemies, to brief civilized encounters that would last only a few minutes when he would check in on Draco, to friends that looked forward to the hours long visits that they both relied upon on a weekly basis.</p><p> </p><p>Draco had decided to stop living in the past and to try and do something good with his life. Harry vouched for him with the Ministry and Draco’s determination to make up for the mistakes he and his family made against the wizarding community. He had no chances to be accepted into any wizarding universities, so Draco studied potions under a reluctant and retired Horace Slughorn with a little persuasion from Harry. He had become the youngest master potion maker in all of Europe. He worked for St. Mungos Hospital, researched cures for magical maladies and invented new medicines. Draco enjoyed the solitude of the lab for a time, but he soon found work at St. Mungos to be dull and was not as challenged anymore. Harry continued to check in with Draco when they would meet at the corner coffee shop near St Mungos. They spent their hours each week, day dreaming scenarios in which they both quit their jobs and started a Detective Agency. They could choose what kind of cases they wanted to work on and not be burdened with the strict rules of the ministry or the hospital. After three years of such conversations, they both decided that they needed to stop dreaming and put their dreams into action.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Now since he partnered up with Draco, they purchased a building located in the very furthest corner of Diagon Alley. It had become the office of the newly formed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>‘Heroes Detective Agency’.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry used his skills as an Auror, met with the clients, and spent a lot of time out in the field, while Draco worked in his newly built lab and took charge of the magical forensics. Because there were only two of them working pretty much around the clock to solve their first few cold case files, they eventually asked Fred Weasley, Neville Longbottom, and Luna Lovegood to join the team.</p><p> </p><p>Harry remembered how Fred had come to join the agency. The twins had opened two successful Joke shops the year after they left school. After George’s death, Fred found that he hated being in the shops where he and George and invented new products.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He sold the stores to his brother Ron and his friend Lee Jordan, and left the country. The next two years Fred wandered from place to place. Harry always managed to know where to send him a letter. He kept Fred updated on the family and that there was always a place form him back home when he decided to come back. Fred never stayed too long in one spot, Harry thought that Fred searched for something to fill the void in his heart when George was ripped away from him. Harry found Fred on his doorstep one evening back in London and he offered him a judgement free place to stay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the months past, Harry found that the twin loitered around the Agency most days. Fred helped Harry and Draco with their cases where he could, he set up surveillance on stakeouts with Harry, and they had long conversations through the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eventually his periodic visits to the office became more routine until he was there everyday by 8 am. Fred created better surveillance devices and charmed objects to protect against the dark arts than what Harry and Draco had seen anywhere else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fred’s spirits had started to lift, and one day he came in late after he purchased a flat in Diagon Alley above the Quality Quiddach Shop. he even started going back to the Burrow for family dinner on Sundays.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco and Harry observed the change in Fred and offered him a partnership in their business. Fred took a moment and starred out of the window and watched two boys run down the street laughing, when he looked up he responded with a sly smile that Harry hadn’t seen since George died, and muttered “Thanks mates” as he pulled them into a group hug that even Draco wouldn’t pull away from. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Neville found himself part of the group not long after Fred.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was often consulted on cases that involved magical plant and deaths caused by strange new poisons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry and Draco trusted his advice and instincts as he had quickly rose to the top of his field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neville, a top herbologist, had written many books on magical plants and their uses. He made many discoveries of new and rare plants. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Neville and Draco quickly became partners in the lab, old rivalries pushed aside and quickly forgotten, replaced by long hours of antidote and potion making. Each one offering their expertise to the other as respected colleagues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry and Fred after being out in the field chasing some criminal or beast, would come back to the office in the wee hours of the morning to find Neville and Draco having heated debates about what plant ingredient would work best in the potion the were working on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry and Fred would often start to break through the door ready to pull the two apart when Neville or Draco would make a snide remark about the other, Draco usually calling Neville a ‘dim witted Gryffindor’ or Neville calling Draco a ‘stubborn Slytherin’ there would be a moment or two of silence followed by hearty laughter from both men and then the sounds of pages flipped or potion ingredients being chopped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eventually Fred and Harry would walk away from the door and made their way to the pub for a pint.</p><p> </p><p>Harry laughed remembering how quickly the four of them had come together as a team. He had a hard time recalling a period in the last year that the four of them were not together. They did not have social lives to speak of, there were at least two or three of them in the office anytime night or day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco often said that they should just magic the broom closet into a dormitory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They didn’t go as far as to add beds but Neville and Fred turned one wall into a small kitchen where they ate most meals. Draco conjured up several large pieces of furniture where they lounged for hours on end and discussed, laughed,and argued about things such as what quidditch teams could win the league, what insane story would come out of the Daily Profit about Harry or Draco next,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>who was better looking, how long would it take Hermione Grainger to become Minister of Magic, who would get a date first and then married.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p><p> </p><p>This last conversation brought up the realization that none of the four men had been actively on the look out for a girlfriend. They all knew that Neville was gay and had been out of the closet since Hogwarts, but it was surprisingly Draco that next said that he was not interested in women, but that he knew since he was in his third year of Hogwarts that he was gay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry remembered the tightness he felt in his chest as Draco described what Hogwarts had been like for the closeted Slytherin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry found that Draco’s story was eerily similar to his own.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes he had dated Cho and Ginny for a short time, but it never felt quite right.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>After a few weeks of soul searching and several cases solved, Harry came out to the group one evening after dinner. He told them that he too was gay and that his time at Hogwarts and afterwards he had been so occupied with killing Voldemort and then after becoming an Auror, he never had time to figure out who he was or what he wanted out of his life. He told the three of them that he was tired of living a lie and wanted to be free. The three men got up and pulled Harry into a tight hug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was Neville that broke the tension and said “Fred it looks like you will have to fight off all of Harry’s female fan club now that the three musketeers are looking for blokes!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fred replied nonchalantly “ Looks like the ladies are out of luck... I’m gay too!” They broke apart and laughed as Fred summoned four beers from the refrigerator.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t very long before the Four Musketeers became five. Luna Lovegood had occasionally been asked to help them with cases that involved rare and unique creatures that none of the four had heard of. Luna had become an expert with magical creatures especially ones that were thought to have never existed. Since the war, Luna traveled the world in her quest to prove the existence of several new creatures, many thought to be myth, the Rumple Skin Snorkack and the Blimbling Humdinger just to name a few.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Luna instinctually understood the creatures she came in contact with. She seemed to have the unique ability to communicate with and understand their needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This unique talent helped them solve <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of their most dangerous and difficult cases.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Luna added an unique perspective to each new case.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She would often have a moment of clear brilliance seemingly out of nowhere, when the group was at a dead end or when they thought a case may have grown cold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s when she would look up from a book she would have open and shed light on a detail that everyone else had overlooked. Fred would joke that Luna probably used divination or animal communication to help them when all else seemed hopeless. Luna would just look up from her book and told them in her dreamy voice “Don’t be silly, the answer has been there the whole time. You just need to look”. The group just stared at her in amazement as she lifted her book and begun to read again. It was not long before the four men asked Luna to work full time with the Agency and thus the HEROES Detective Agency was complete. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The name of the agency became their mission statement: H.E.R.O.E.S. - Helping Explain Rare Occurrences &amp; Extraordinary Situations. With more than thirty local and international cases, under their belts in the last two years, they had quickly gained a reputation of being experts in all cases that concerned the supernatural. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry decided it was time to go home. He got up from the sofa by the fire and placed the closed case file in the storage room. He flicked his wand at the dishes on the table and they flew into the air and landed in the small kitchen. He used a cleaning charm and they washed and dried themselves and flew back<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>into the cabinet in a stack and clinked into place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry turned off the lights and performed a complex series of locking and protection spells that will keep anyone from breaking in while they are gone. He stepped out into the cobblestone street, turned in place and apparrated with a small pop to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>his home at 12 Grimmauld Place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
