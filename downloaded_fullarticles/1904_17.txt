  <strong>Chapter 1:</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Deal with the Devi-... </strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>um Death?</strong>
</p><hr/><p align="justify">Harry James Potter was making a deal. It was an important deal, probably the most important deal in his live. He couldn't afford to fuck this up. </p><p align="justify">It was the day of his 317th birthday. And instead of celebrating he had thrown a complete fit worthy of his young cousin Dudley. </p><p align="justify">While Dudley might have destroyed some Furniture and thrown something at his cousin Harry in his <em>'misery', </em>317th year old Harry Potter might have destroyed some landscapes in his magical outburst. </p><p align="justify">And he might have just barely remembered to aparate somewhere remote least he kill someone accidentally. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He was not Dudley or Voldemort who wouldn't mind accidentally killing some people if it meant making their displeasure known to others. </p><p align="justify">A deep voice brought him out of his musing. </p><p align="justify">He looked up at the dark haired man in front of him. He wore a business suit, something rich people wore like Armani, his hair was black as the night and his eyes a bright pumpkin orange with little green spots dancing in them. </p><p align="justify">The both of them were standing at Kings Cross station, he always landed there when dying. He might have 'AK' himself to have this little chat with Death. </p><p align="justify">"I can let you go back to anytime one of my Hallows found itself in your possession." </p><p align="justify">Harry brightened up at the thought of going back. </p><p align="justify">"But-" here his smile dimmed, being replaced by wariness, this was Death (The Death!) he was dealing with after all! </p><p align="justify">"-I reserve the right to change some things." </p><p align="justify">"What things?" now he was more than a little weary, this was an entity way older and a lot more powerful than himself but he had power over such a being. </p><p align="justify">Harry didn't call upon Death often but that was more out of respect for the powerful being who had seen so much more, had so much more knowledge than him. </p><p align="justify">But whenever they did meet Death was always polite, friendly and (dare he say) inviting to him. </p><p align="justify">Like he wanted to be friends. </p><p align="justify">And who was Harry to deny him? </p><p align="justify">Sure he had been quite angry with the entity when it explained to him that the hallows chose their master, just like wands, and would reject anyone else who wanted to wield them. </p><p align="justify">"Nothing significant." Death gave him a bashful smile that would have been reassuring if he didn't know he was making a deal with <strong>Death. </strong></p><p align="justify">He was proud of his inner Slytherin. </p><p align="justify">Death then pointed at his forhead: "You are my master, I will not allow you to be marked by anyone else." </p><p align="justify">Harry only nodded, he didn't want to go through his mental connection with Voldemort again if possible. </p><p align="justify">" I will offer you the bit of his soul as a tribute then, as soon as I will be able to speak properly. "</p><p align="justify">Because there was no doubt in Harry he would go back to being a Baby. </p><p align="justify">He was going to exploit this chance, milk it for all he could. And the best way, with the least casualties, when Sirius was still alive, was when he got the cloak, when his father died. </p><p align="justify">A sharp pain of regret and guilt stabbed his heart, he wouldn't be able to save his mother and father but it didn't matter, he knew them. He had talked with them often enough and they would tell him to stay strong and rescue the family he could. </p><p align="justify">And his mother would tell him to kick Dumbledores ass into oblivion, his father would tell him to prank it into oblivion. </p><p align="justify">He planned on doing both. </p><p align="justify">"And-" Harry was snapped out of his musings again (hey, what could he say he was an old man already). </p><p align="justify">"-you will still be my master. I have already taken the moment you became the owner of all three Hallows, the moment you became my master out of your timeline and stored it in a dimension only I have access to." </p><p align="justify">Harry could only blink dumbfounded. The little hope that he could have possibly just not collected the other Hallows and become mortal again died inside him. </p><p align="justify"><em>At least bargain for something else valuable, don't just roll over like a Griffindork! </em>his inner Slitheryin-voice (who sounded suspiciously like Draco Malfoy) chided him. </p><p align="justify">So like the Griffindork he was he blurted out the first thing that came to mind. "I don't want to go back alone!"</p><p align="justify">Death raised an unimpressed eyebrow. </p><p align="justify">"I mean... this is a big task and I don't think I will be able to do everything alone. Let someone else remember." </p><p align="justify">The entity didn't react for a few minutes but eventually it nodded and conceded with a "Very well." </p><p align="justify">"Great, Kreacher!" </p><p align="justify">Now it was Deaths turn to be confused (not that Harry could tell the Entity had the single most perfect Pokerface in the Universe). </p><p align="justify">Death would have honestly thought he would ask for his soulmate. But it also made sense he didn't. </p><p align="justify">First thing first he didn't know who his soulmate was, just that he had one and that the soul mate-bond had been blocked by one Albus too many middle names Dumbledore. </p><p align="justify">(Death couldn't wait to see his masters reaction when he found out he had not one but two mates.) </p><p align="justify">Secondly he wouldn't throw his mate (mates, seriously he could not wait! ) in the mess that was Harry Potters life if he didn't know if the person (people) could handle it. </p><p align="justify">But house elves were loyal creatures, especially ones like Kreacher and Dobby. </p><p align="justify">Since the Blackfamiliy-elf had been bound to his master his life force had been tremendously expanded. Unfortunately he had been rather old already and therefore only lived for 70 more years than he was originally supposed to. </p><p align="justify">The little elf appeared before Harry and looked up at him full of love and adoration. </p><p align="justify">"Great Master Harry be calling Kreacher?" </p><p align="justify">Harry smiled fondly at Kreacher, to him he was family. He went down to sit on the floor, he wanted to be at eye-level to Kreacher for the following discussion. </p><p align="justify">He explained what he planned to do, to travel back in time, save his family and friends. To change history. </p><p align="justify">To all this Kreacher listened patiently. </p><p align="justify">"And Kreacher, I would like to have you at my side for this.</p><p align="justify">...</p><p align="justify">Will you come back with me?" </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">" Master wants Kreacher to come back with him, he wants Kreacher to stay by his side?" the old elf had what suspiciously looked like tears blinking at the corners of his eyes. </p><p align="justify">Harry confirmed this with a firm nod and Kreacher launched himself at his Master crying tears of happiness. </p><p align="justify">Harry hugged him back and looked at Death with a mischievous smile on his face. </p><p align="justify">"I think we are ready." </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>
