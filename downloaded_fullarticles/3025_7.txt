  <span>He heard footsteps mixed with the sounds of pattering coming into the room.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He turned away from the stove to see the broken boy bundled up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A gold and red scarf was twisted around his neck and hands covered with mitts. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>They were running a scan over the sleeping boy.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The man with shabby hair smiled at him as when the kid entered. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bailey was walking beside the boy as he walked to the back yard.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Before he could open the door and head out, he pulled a hat on to the kid’s head.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>They had done it every other day since he arrived. His body was starting to heal.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Walking out into the snow the dog stayed by the door and watched. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The boy walked out a few feet from the stairs and flopped down.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He chuckled at him when he started to wave his arms and legs.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>But he was still struggling. With asking for things. With talking. With the basics.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After shaking the snow from his body he crouched down and gathered a ball of snow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He started to roll the ball around the yard.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The two men watched as the formation grew in front of him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He flinched every time one of them reached toward him.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After getting the ball to the height of his waist he started to work an another ball.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was halfway through rolling this one around when another person joined.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She wore a blue and bronze scarf with funny glasses.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He has panic attacks that rocked him to his core. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She walked up to him and looked down at him, her blond hair falling from behind her ears.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She helped him lift the formation onto the first one.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After that, they started to roll a third part for the creation.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>But he had to start to speak. Asking at least a question a day.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The head of their creation was a struggle to get on,</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The girl slipped on to her bum right as it was placed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The two men saw a smile on the boys lips for the first time.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He had started to talk about what he read, even if it was in a quiet voice.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After getting up the girl wrapped her scarf around the snowman.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The boy placed his hat on it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Two sticks were impaled into its side.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>It wasn’t until he called out for them after a nightmare did they know.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The two kids ran back the house with red cheeks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>One with a smile and the other with a shine in their eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>One joyful and excited, the other shy and hesitant.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>That though it may take time, Harry would be okay. </span>
