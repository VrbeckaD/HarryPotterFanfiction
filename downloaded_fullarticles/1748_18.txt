<p dir="ltr">  It had been a good day for Theseus Scamander. So far.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  Peter made him coffee this morning, as an apology for spilling one yesterday. No signs of Yaxley complaining about things, and he just got a lead to this big case he'd been working on for two weeks with his team. Theseus was now proudly walking along the corridor. On his way to his future sister-in-law's office to tell her about the lead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  But his luck seemed to run out when he reached her door.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "Harder, Tina!!"</p>
<p dir="ltr">  Theseus froze for a moment. His eyes widened. One hand stopped and hovered right above the doorknob. <em>Is that Newt? </em>He thought. Deliberating whether he should enter or not. But in the end, Theseus decided to do it anyway. He's the head auror, for Merlin's sake.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  His face was awfully burning when he opened the door, realizing what he just witnessed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  Right before the desk stood a way too familiar figure of his brother, back facing him. Newt's face looked shocked, and heavily flushed when he noticed Theseus' presence. Tina was kneeling in front of Newt, her hands holding <em>something</em> between his thighs. She was even more embarrassed and instantly shot to her feet. Newt didn't even turn around, instead he pulled his grey coat tightly to cover the front of his trousers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  Tina began to stutter, "Theseus,  i- uh, i can explainㅡ"</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "Not a word." Theseus raised his index finger. He cursed under his breath before continuing, "Come to the meeting room. We got a lead."</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "Yes, Sir." Tina lowered her head and sprinted to the door. She took a look at Newt, mouthed <em>'sorry' </em>with a grimace before leaving the room.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  Theseus had his hands on his waist. Couldn't believe how Newt still had the nerve to not turn around and face him. Was he that embarrassed he couldn't button his pants? "Oh, Newton."</p>
<p dir="ltr">  The younger man could only sighed, the redness on his face hasn't fade. "I'm so sorry."</p>
<p dir="ltr">  Theseus shook his head. "Just, fix your bloody pants and get the hell out of here." It was the only thing he could say as he left. </p>
<p dir="ltr">  Well, one good day has, unfortunately, been ruined.<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p dir="ltr">  <em>Fifteen minutes ago... </em><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">  Tina leaned against her chair. Exhaling heavily while trying to keep up with tons of files, though she failed eventually. She was just about to drowse herself off when she heard rapid and vigorous knocking at her door.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "Just a minute!" She said out of frustration. It must be Theseus, since he's the only one who would dare to do so. And Tina must be hurry before he gets to yell '<em>Goldstein!!' </em>and annoy the entire floor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "Did we get someth- Newt?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">  The ginger haired man was wincing. He didn't even wait for his girlfriend to say anything and entered her office. His grey coat was wrapped tightly around his body, as if he was hiding something. Tina could only stare, beyond confused. "What are you doing here?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "So sorry, Tina. But- you're the only person i can trust in this." said Newt while shifting his coat. Tina looked down. Her jaw dropped in disbelief.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  After a few seconds of silence, a snort accidentally escaped Tina's nose. The young woman immediately covered her mouth with her hands. Her eyes squinted, as if she was trying hard not to laugh. There was some kind of... Gecko, dangling on Newt's left thigh. Greyish blue with yellowish-brown spots, and the size of one hand. Its jaws tightly clenched around the fabric.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "What in the name of merlin is thatㅡ"</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "A Tokay Gecko, it's my first time seeing this creature too." Newt explained, scratching his temple. "I don't think it's magical. But a new staff in my department gave this to me as a present this morning and then, well... it sort of just happened."</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "I see." Tina took a deep breath, trying to gain more control for she didn't want to make Newt feel more embarrassed. Although she couldn't help but lock her stare at that creature. It wasn't the first time her magizoologist got entangled with his creatures, some of them are way more bizarre. But this one by far is the most hilarious. Tina cleared her throat, just want to question the most important thing, "But it didn't.. It didn't get to bite yourㅡ"</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "Oh no! No no no, just the pants, fortunately." Newt then gave her a pleading look. "Please help me, Tina."</p>
<p dir="ltr">  The brunette haired woman let out a soft chuckle, "Alright, alright, come here." she took Newt's arm and guided him to stand before her desk while she grabbed her wand. "Have you tried any spells?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "I did! But i couldn't try anything more because other spells might harm him."</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "Oh, well then, my senior taught me this specific spell, saved a friend from a snake's bite once. Maybe we should give it a tryㅡ" After a silent spell, Tina flicked her wand towards the gecko. But it did nothing. Newt only sighed, equally as disappointed as her.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  Tina tilted her head. Lips pressed into a straight line. Recalling other methods that might work. "Do you<em>... </em>Uhm, do you have salt?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">  The man shook his head.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "Mercy lewis, maybe he is magical." Tina muttered. "I guess we have no choice. We'll do it together, okay?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">  She knelt and wrapped her hands around the small reptile's body. Newt's hands followed a second after, covering her own. He counted on three, and they pulled. The gecko wiggled. Arms and legs stretched up and down, panicking. But its mouth remained sealed on the fabric.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  Another count of three, the couple pulled harder. Still no progress. Tina clicked her tongue, began to feel more frustrated and increased the force.</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "O-ow!"</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "I'm sorry! Did i hurt you?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "A bit." Newt hissed. "Try again."</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "Merlin's beard, what is wrong with this creature?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">  "Harder, Tina!!" </p>
<p dir="ltr">  Right at that moment, the door was slammed open. Newt instinctively turned his head around, while Tina peeked from Newt's body, only to be horrified when they saw the Head Auror standing behind them.<br/>
