  <em>Halloween 1981</em>
</p><p>With a sudden jerk he was wide awake. The storm raging outside rattled against the shutter, a flash of lightning illuminated the room.</p><p>Still half asleep he shook his head. "What time is it?" No one answered. It's been a while since he'd shared a bed with someone. And yet. Old habits die hard.</p><p>With aching limbs, he got out of bed and looked out of the window. His mind might be twenty-one, but his body felt like the one of a dotard.</p><p>His arms braced on the window shell, he watched the chaos outside, an uneasy feeling creeping up his chest. Normally a storm like this would calm him down. It was a little cathartic. Like the dirt of the world being washed away. Washed away with a big bang. But not tonight.</p><p>That night it felt ominous. As if something bad had happened and nature tried to underline it.</p><p>Finally, he looked away.</p><p>"It's just the stress," Remus whispered and made his way to the kitchen.</p><p>But just as he was about to make himself a cup of tea, he heard another bang. This time, coming from the door.</p><p>He scanned the room, looking for his wand, but then he realised that it was still lying under his pillow.</p><p>"Fuck."</p><p>Another knocking; this time much more emphatic. Then he heard a voice.</p><p>"Remus it’s me. Open the door."</p><p>With quick steps he hurried into the hallway and ripped it open.</p><p>He was wet to the bone. His gaze confused and anxious, clinging to a package he held tightly in his arms. The package screamed.</p><p>"Sirius. Harry?!"</p><p>"Please Remus, I didn’t know where else to go. It’s just- Fuck, I made a huge mistake. Please may we come in?" The words just sputtering out of his mouth.</p><p>Remus knew the situation was serious. It seemed his feeling had not deceived him. So, still confused, he opened the door further. But when they entered the kitchen and Sirius was about to speak, another knock was heard.</p><p>They both turned their heads and without asking Remus new that this might not be a favourable visitor.</p><p>"You know who this is?" he hissed at Sirius, who just shook his head. "Those aren't James &amp; Lily looking for their son, right?" Sirius swallowed, but then negated. "And whoever this is, he's coming for Harry?"</p><p>Sirius had no way of answering. A sudden breeze sweeping through the flat, caused them to flinch. For a moment they had to close their eyes and when they reopened them, none less than Albus Dumbledore stood in front of them.</p><p>"No," Sirius breathed. He pressed Harry even harder against his chest and took a step back. "No, you won’t get him."</p><p>"I'm sorry I barged in here unannounced, Remus. But my request is unfortunately very urgent. Sirius, please give me Harry."</p><p>The headmaster's voice was calm as always and yet it had a certain undertone that didn't allow any objections.</p><p>"Sirius, please?" He stretched out his hand, but Sirius stepped back further.</p><p>"Would somebody please tell me what the hell is going on?" Remus, still in his pyjama bottoms, stood baffled in his own fucking kitchen, but nobody paid him any attention.</p><p>"Sirius, you must now give me Harry. Time is running short.”</p><p>"Give him to you? And for what? So that you can bring him to these uptight Muggles? Only over my dead body."</p><p>"I'm not going to discuss this with you. Now give me Harry."</p><p>"No!"</p><p>"Sirius!"</p><p>"What the hell is going on?"</p><p>"THEY’RE FUCKING DEAD, THIS IS GOING ON!"</p><p>With a smack Remus felt all his remained strength leaving his body and everything turned terribly cold. The world suddenly frozen.</p><p>He clung to the kitchen chair in front of him, the only chance to hold himself up. When he eventually raised his head, he saw the tears in Sirius’s eyes. Leaving no room for any doubts.</p><p>"They’re really dead," Sirius sobbed and slowly Remus began to understand. He turned to Dumbledore; his own voice unfamiliar and strange in his ears. "Voldemort?"</p><p>"He's gone," the old man said with a sigh and took a seat on one of the empty kitchen chairs. "We don't know exactly what happened in Godric's Hollow this night, but one thing is for sure. Someone betrayed Lily &amp; James Potter. The Fidelius charm was lifted when Lord Voldemort was able to track them down and kill them." He rubbed his beard and paused for a second. "I assume James died trying to stop him. Just like Lily, who stood in his way when he reached the nursery. Her love might have saved Harry. And yet they had to pay with their lives." He turned his gaze at Sirius. "As it seems, they had put their trust in the wrong person."</p><p>"So did I," Sirius sniffed but his eyes remained on Dumbledore. Still determined as the first second the headmaster had set foot in this room. "But he will pay for this."</p><p>"What do you mean?" Remus snapped. "<em>You</em> were their fucking secret keeper!"</p><p>"No, I wasn’t."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"We switched."</p><p>"You and who?"</p><p>"Peter."</p><p>And finally, Remus' legs gave way. Powerless he sank down on the chair and buried his face in his hands. "This can't be true."</p><p>"I'm sorry Remus," Dumbledore said and got up, "but it is. Unfortunately, now is not the time to grieve. Voldemort may be gone, but his followers aren’t. They’ll come looking for Harry. And they’ll hunt those who protect him. So, I must take him to Lily's sister. Only there he’ll be safe."</p><p>Sirius sneered. "Safe? With them? How are <em>they</em> supposed to protect him? Besides, they hate people like us. How do you think they’ll treat him?"</p><p>"It is not for you to decide, Sirius." Dumbledore's voice now sounded unusually angry, which led Remus to straighten up.</p><p>"He is his godfather, Albus. James and Lily wanted Harry to stay with Sirius."</p><p>"As I said before, now is not the time to discuss this," Dumbledore urged, standing up, drawing his wand, "Sirius, I will not ask you again."</p><p>The air in the room immediately became thicker. Highly charged. Dangerous. With one sentence Remus was on his feet and stood in front of Sirius.</p><p>Harry still screamed like mad. His little hand desperately clawed into Sirius' jacket.</p><p>And Remus, he could do nothing but stand between them and probably the most powerful wizard of their time. In his pyjama bottoms. He didn't even have his wand.</p><p>But suddenly the tension subsided, the old man only shaking his head. "Where dwell the brave at heart," he mumbled.</p><p>With a tear in his eye he looked up at them but smiled. "Please excuse the folly of an old man. We often believe to know what is best by experience. But of course, you were their friends."</p><p>"Albus?" Remus looked at him with narrowed eyes, Harry suddenly silent but still clutching at Sirius arm.</p><p>"James Potter had also faced a powerful wizard this night, armed with nothing more than his bare hands to protect those he loved. I shall not be the one you must protect yourselves from, Remus." He nodded, confirming his own words and then turned to go. "But be careful. They will come. And this will probably be the first place they look at. But I'm sure you already know what to do."</p><p>He blinked at them briefly, when another breeze swept through the flat, and then he was gone.</p><p>Nobody said a word. For several seconds they stopped breathing, none of them ready to move. It’d really happened, and every further step would force them to accept it.</p><p>But finally, Sirius sighed with relief.</p><p>The same moment Remus grabbed the teacup from the table and threw it against the wall.</p><p>Then Harry started screaming again.</p>
