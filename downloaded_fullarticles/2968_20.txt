  <span>Harry gave one last wave as they finished up for the evening. The others had covered for him today - his mind had been with the blond back home and their combined frustration at the consequences a difficult childhood. Harry was still learning to accept happiness and Draco was trying to leave prejudice behind him. It was always easier to be the other’s lifeboat than to deal with their own stormy seas.</span>

  <span>He made his way home quickly, hoping that Draco wasn’t wallowing any longer. He’d been a right bastard to get out of bed that morning. Apparating to the back door of Grimmauld, he made his way through the dark house. No lights on, at this time of night? A faint glow of green and blue, pink and yellow came from the sitting room and he turned the corner to find that Draco had </span>
