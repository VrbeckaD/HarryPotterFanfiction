</p><p>Of all the weddings Draco Malfoy thought he might get invited to, this certainly wasn’t one of them. He never expected to see Neville Longbottom again after Hogwarts, let alone be invited to (and choose to attend) his wedding. He wasn’t even quite sure who Hannah Abbot was, but she looked pretty enough in her white dress, fairy lights woven into her hair.</p><p>The ceremony had been boring as predicted, but now was the part of the evening Draco had been looking forward to—the reception, complete with a gaggle of eligible witches in his age range. He hung back by the bar, leaning against it with one arm, sipping on his firewhisky as he scoped out the selection.</p><p>Ever since Astoria Greengrass had broken off their engagement for someone who “actually wanted to get married,” Draco had been taking things far less seriously. As in, no one stays for longer than one night. It’s not like he’d shagged a hoard of women—he certainly hadn’t beaten Blaise’s record. But before Astoria, there was only Pansy, and since? There’d been a fair few.</p><p>No one particularly memorable, though.</p><p>He figured he’d settle down eventually, once he found the right witch. To his utter dismay, he’d found that in order to want anything more than just sex, he needed intellectual stimulation as well. How very unfortunate for him. He had a different kind of stimulation on the agenda for this evening, though.</p><p>Finally deciding on his target—the girl in the navy cocktail dress with strawberry blonde hair, who looked on just the right side of tipsy to make bad decisions—he strode across the room. As he was about to make his introduction, he was rudely interrupted by a voice behind him.</p><p>“Oi, Malfoy! What are you doing here?”</p><p>It sounded familiar, but the words were slurred. It couldn’t possibly be—“Granger?” He turned to see the bushy haired figure barrelling towards him, clad in a tight red dress. Had she been anyone else, he might’ve taken the time to appreciate the way it accentuated her curves.</p><p>He braced himself for the blow it looked like she was about to deal him, and so was doubly surprised when she wrapped her arms around him for a sloppy hug. “I didn’t think you’d come.”</p><p>He saw Hermione on occasion, as they both worked for the Ministry these days. They were civil, at times even friendly, but nowhere near hug-level status. “Well, I can’t resist free cake and an open bar.”</p><p>Hermione laughed a little too loudly and it occurred to him that she was completely pissed. Like wobbling in her heels, eyes glazed over, truly blitzed. “You’re so funny.” She grabbed his arm for stability and stumbled as she tried to remove her shoes. “Who can walk in these death traps?”</p><p>Draco held her steady as she completed her task before leading her over to a nearby table. “Certainly not you.” She huffed and a piece of her hair flew up. Somehow, this version of Hermione Granger was kind of adorable.</p><p>He forgot all about the strawberry blonde.</p><p>“Granger, how are you <em> this </em> drunk? I don’t think I’ve ever seen you with more than a glass of Chardonnay.”</p><p>“You said it yourself, Draco.” He shuddered a bit at her use of his first name. “Open bar.” She booped him on the nose for emphasis.</p><p>“Yes, but why did you overindulge?” He flagged down one of the house elf waiters and grabbed a glass of water for her.</p><p>She accepted the glass and drank greedily before starting to rub her feet. “I don’t know. I guess, I sort of hate weddings.”</p><p>“What? Why?” He loved weddings, or at least what tended to happen at them. Surely hopeless romantic Hermione Granger didn’t <em> hate </em> weddings.</p><p>“Okay, that’s not the whole truth. This was supposed to be Ron’s and my wedding. After I broke it off, the venue opened up and Hannah jumped on it. I think these were the same floral arrangements, too.”</p><p>“Oh.” Draco didn’t know what to say. It was well-known that Hermione had called off her wedding nearly a year ago. It was also pretty well-known that Weaselbee was set to marry Looney Lovegood of all people in a few months.</p><p>“Yeah. Seemed like a good time to get drunk off my arse.”</p><p>“Well, Granger,” he leaned in to whisper conspiratorially, “You should be thankful this wasn’t your wedding. It’s downright atrocious.”</p><p>Hermione stared at him for a few seconds, and he started to worry she was about to weep, when she broke out into boisterous laughter. She clutched her stomach and gasped for air. “It really is, isn’t it?”</p><p>He joined her in laughing, not noticing at all the little creases around her eyes or how her whole face lit up, her white teeth gleaming. “You can do much better.”</p><p>She nodded, looking pensive for a moment. Then said, “I think I’m gonna be sick.”</p><p>“Okay,” Draco huffed, pulling her up out of the chair. “Let’s get you to your room.”</p><p>As it turned out, he had a hard time getting Hermione to her room—mostly because she couldn’t remember which one was hers. They stumbled down the long hallway together with her adding, “This looks familiar,” every few feet or so.</p><p>“You can’t remember a number or anything, Granger?”</p><p>“I think there may have been a two or a five…” she trailed off and started clicking her shoes together in her hand.</p><p>Draco sighed. “Fine. I’ll take you to my room.”</p><p>Hermione gasped. “A bit forward don’t you think?” Then she started to laugh. “At least buy me dinner first.”</p><p>“Clearly you didn’t eat enough actual dinner, or you wouldn’t be so sloshed.” He kept his hand at the small of her back as he waved his wand and let himself into his room. </p><p>Hermione clambered onto his bed and laid down. She stared at him for a few moments before patting the mattress beside her. “I promise I won’t bite if you don’t.” She smirked—which was more infuriating than anything because that was usually his move.</p><p>“I’m going to get you some more water.” He forced her to drink another glass before she promptly passed out.</p><p>Draco eyed the free side of the bed with apprehension. He was tired, no longer buzzed, and a bit sexually frustrated. Granger had ruined all his plans for the evening. But he didn’t know how she’d react if she woke up suddenly to him sleeping beside her. He sat down in the corner chair and debated whether or not to join her on the bed for so long that he dozed off while sitting up.</p><p>When he woke up, he had a stiff neck and his limbs ached from being cramped in the awkward position. Hermione was still sound asleep, lightly snoring, with her arm draped across her middle. She had never gotten underneath the covers and her dress had ridden up on one side to reveal a wide expanse of creamy thigh. He shook his head and transfigured the chair into more of a chaise so he could stretch back out comfortably, ignoring the voice inside that urged him to crawl into bed next to her.</p><p>When Draco woke up the second time, Hermione was awake and watching him cautiously. “I’m sorry I kept you out of your bed. You could’ve slept here; I would have been fine.”</p><p>He smirked. “I didn’t want to take the chance of you not remembering what happened and trying to hex my balls off.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t—” she stopped as he gave her a pointed look. “Okay, maybe I would.” She grinned as she sat up and tried to smooth out some creases in her dress. “Thank you for looking after me last night. I know I was a right mess.”</p><p>He waved her off as he came over and sat on the edge of the bed. “Someone had to make sure you didn’t get into too much trouble. A drunk Gryffindor is never a good thing.”</p><p>“Ha ha,” she deadpanned. She let out a deep groan. “Why is everyone getting married so soon? Aren’t we a little young?”</p><p>“I hate to break it to you, Granger, but you were one of those people until about a year ago.”</p><p>“I know! And thank Merlin I had the good sense to call it off when I did. Magical divorces are so much harder than Muggle ones.” She rubbed her face and Draco felt something in his chest—what was this ridiculous sensation? Empathy? Disgusting.</p><p>“You really hate Weasley that much?”</p><p>“Oh heavens, no! I don’t hate him at all. In fact, I loved him enough to save him from the horrible life we would’ve had.” She swept her riotous curls over one shoulder. “We were just a terrible match, you see. Nothing in common, disagree on almost everything—at least the sex was decent.”</p><p>Draco made a face. “I didn’t need to know that.”</p><p>She blushed. “Right. Sorry. Anyway, weren’t you engaged, too?”</p><p>“Yes and completely relieved that she had the good sense to call it off as well. You’re right, it’s much too soon to settle down.”</p><p>“Still, I wish people would just lay off.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” </p><p>“Oh right, you’re a man so you probably don’t get that ‘When are you going to find a nice boy and settle down?’ nonsense that I constantly am bombarded with.”</p><p>Draco furrowed his eyebrows then quickly uncrinkled them, remembering what his mother had said about wrinkles. “My mother has been nagging me quite a bit, actually. It <em> is </em> traditional for a Malfoy to be settled down by now.”</p><p>Hermione tapped her chin, thinking. “And how many more weddings have you been invited to this season?”</p><p>“Two. There’s Theo’s, for which I’m best man—”</p><p>“And I’m maid of honor,” Hermione interrupted. </p><p>He paused. Right, of course Hermione was—Theo was marrying Harry bloody Potter, of all people. “Yes, and then there’s Blaise and Ginny.”</p><p>“I’ve been invited to that one as well. Plus Ron and Luna’s wedding, which it doesn’t surprise me that you weren’t invited. So I’ve got three left and you’ve got two. How many more times are people going to bother us about our love lives at these things?”</p><p>Draco didn’t really care about any of that—he was just in it to shag unsuspecting bridesmaids. “I don’t see your point here. I usually avoid those kinds of people and go after the single witches instead.” He winked at her for emphasis.</p><p>She scoffed. “Just hear me out—we could go together. You know, say we’re involved. At least people would stop asking questions. And then after the last wedding, we could just quietly break up. What do you think?”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Granger… you want to <em> what?”</em></p><p>“Go together! To all the weddings—it’ll work out perfectly. People will stop asking about my love life, and if you happen to meet a girl you want to take home, I can be your wing woman!”</p><p>“My what?” Draco looked confused. </p><p>“It’s a Muggle expression. Never mind. The point is, I think we can help each other out. What do you say?”</p><p>“I say you’ve gone barmy…” he trailed off, wanting to laugh at the ludicrousness of it. Then he started to think—not only would it appease his mother that he was taking someone seriously again, but his choice of witch would annoy his father greatly. “But it’s really not a half bad idea.”</p><p>Hermione grinned. “It’s settled then. For the next three weddings, you’re my date.”</p><p><em> Sure</em>, Draco thought. <em> Pretend to date war heroine Hermione Granger—what could go wrong? </em></p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>He thought that agreeing to fake date Hermione Granger would be simple: show up to the wedding together, act like they like each other, maybe share a chaste kiss in front of people. But as was the swot’s tradition, she had a very detailed plan—one that she insisted on meeting in person and going over together.</p><p>They currently sat having lunch together in Diagon Alley, all the better if people were to see them, so she had said. “Excuse me, did you say ‘rules’? Whatever for, Granger?”</p><p>“Just a few ground rules, nothing too overbearing, I assure you.”</p><p>He rolled his eyes. “Okay then, let’s hear them.”</p><p>“For the duration of the fake relationship, you’re not to date anyone else. The same goes for me.”</p><p>Draco swirled the firewhisky in his glass. “Agreed. What else?”</p><p>“If you do find a girl you’d like to shag, you have to let me know in advance and then I’ll give you the go ahead to make your move.”</p><p>“What? You need to approve my sexual partners now?”</p><p>“Keep your voice down, Draco. We’re supposed to be on a date.” Her voice had gotten stern, and he tried to ignore the little flutter in his stomach that accompanied her tone.</p><p>He pulled his mouth into a tight line before answering. “Fine. I suppose it’ll help keep up the ruse, but if you think you get to veto any of my choices—”</p><p>“Relax. I just don’t want anyone to see you leaving with another woman and think you’re cheating on me.” She took a bite of her salad, licking her lips to catch any stray dressing. </p><p>He sat back. “Oh, I guess that makes sense.”</p><p>She gave him a curt nod, as if to say <em> Of course it does, you moron</em>. “And beyond that, we are not obligated for anything after the last wedding, which is Ron and Luna’s.”</p><p>Draco was oddly looking forward to parading Weasley’s ex around in front of him at his own wedding. “That all? We didn’t really need to meet for that. You could’ve owled.”</p><p>“Yes, but then people wouldn’t have seen us together.” She winked. “For instance, there’s a <em> Prophet </em> photographer outside, so I expect there might be a blurb in the society pages tomorrow about us being on a date.” She popped her last crouton into her mouth like she was incredibly pleased with herself.</p><p>“Touche, Granger. I didn’t realize you had so much scheming bottled up in that stuffy little school marm body of yours.”</p><p>She huffed. “School marm?”</p><p>He smirked. “If you like, I could take you shopping. Get you settled into a wardrobe worthy of Draco Malfoy’s girlfriend.”</p><p>Her cheeks started to pink, and he did a little victory dance inside. “Honestly, Malfoy. That won’t be necessary. I know how to dress myself.”</p><p>He snorted. “Clearly.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Draco’s official title at the ministry was Dark Magic and Artifact Consultant. This technically fell under the DMLE’s purview, and so he often found himself in contact with Potter. Though mostly, he sat around at his desk and looked through Auror reports. It was extremely boring but better than being in Azkaban.</p><p>“Malfoy,” a grating voice near his ear sounded.</p><p>He turned to see the wunderkind himself standing there. “Potter,” he sneered.</p><p>“I saw you with Hermione at Neville’s wedding.”</p><p>Oh good, the fun was already starting. “And what of it?”</p><p>“Well, it looked like she was pretty drunk. And Seamus said you took her back to your room?”</p><p>Ah, that arsehole Finnegan. How did he even see them? Draco hadn’t seen anyone watching. Well, he supposed Harry was going to find out sooner or later anyway. “I was helping her because she was too intoxicated to make it back on her own, but if you must know—yes, we are seeing each other.”</p><p>Draco felt a little surge of victory as Harry’s eyes widened. They had resolved many of their issues—seeing as the Golden Boy was engaged to his best friend—but he knew this would still come as a shock. “Oh, well… she hasn’t said anything to me yet.” He seemed skeptical.</p><p>“It’s still new. We weren’t really ready to start telling people yet. So I’d appreciate your <em> discretion.</em>”</p><p>Potter’s eyes glazed over a bit as he nodded, seemingly choosing not to start a fight at the Ministry. That was wise of him. “Of course.” He shifted nervously and adjusted his glasses. “Um, I have other work to attend to.”</p><p>Draco smiled sweetly. “You’re a busy man.”</p><p>Harry shuffled off awkwardly, and Draco went back to staring down his paperwork. He worked for about twenty minutes, feeling pretty good about the one report he finished when he heard heels clicking on their way to his desk.</p><p>“You told Harry?” He felt the weight of her stare even without seeing her.</p><p>Draco turned to look at Hermione and his jaw dropped. She was wearing something very unlike her normal outfits—a low cut blouse showed the very tops of her breasts, which were currently heaving in an alluring fashion. Her pencil skirt hugged the flare of her hips and ended just above her knees. She also had on a sensible pair of heels as well as some light makeup that accentuated her doe eyes and pink lips. He meant to say something, but the words wouldn’t come out.</p><p>“Well? What’s happened, kneazle got your tongue?”</p><p>He shook his head, regaining his focus. “Well, Granger, if you must know—<em>he </em> confronted <em> me </em> so I had to tell him something.”</p><p>“Okay. I would’ve preferred to tell him myself, but that’s fine. What’s done is done.”</p><p>He couldn’t take his eyes off of her. Had she always been this attractive? Then he remembered the Yule Ball and how she had looked at Neville’s wedding. Clearly, he’d been ignoring an important fact for far too long: Hermione Granger was fucking gorgeous. “What’s with this?” he asked, motioning up and down to her clothing.</p><p>“What?” She put her hands on her hips—why did he suddenly find that sexy?</p><p>“This getup. Much different from your normal matronly robes?”</p><p>She scoffed. “They weren’t matronly—” she paused seeing his look of disdain “—<em>fine</em>, they weren’t great. Maybe I took your advice about updating my wardrobe a little.”</p><p>He nodded, still roving his eyes over her appreciatively. “It uh—really works. You look lovely.”</p><p>She blushed for a moment, tucking some wayward curls behind her ear. “Thanks, Malfoy.”</p><p>“Don’t mention it.” He finally pulled his eyes away and focused on the corner of his desk. “So are we good then… about Potter?”</p><p>“Yes. I guess I was just surprised, that’s all. I had forgotten how much you interact with Harry these days.”</p><p>“I suppose you’ll let me know when our next scheduled meeting is?” He chanced another look at her. Still beautiful, dammit.</p><p>“Well, I think we should have lunch together at least twice a week so people can see us.”</p><p>“That sounds reasonable.” He leaned back in his chair, appearing more comfortable than he felt.</p><p>“I thought so. Lunch tomorrow then?”</p><p>“Wouldn’t miss it.” He flashed her what he hoped was a sexy grin.</p><p>Hermione smiled back and left. He kept his eyes glued to her arse for longer than necessary.</p><p>Draco sighed and cast a worried glance to the ceiling. <em> This might present a problem</em>.</p>
