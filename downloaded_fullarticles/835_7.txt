  <em>
    <span>Prologue</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Everybody born a Hero or a Wizard or a Bender knows the tale. They know of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>other</span>
  </em>
  <span> parties, they know they can wield power just like themselves, but a </span>
  <em>
    <span>different</span>
  </em>
  <span> kind of power.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They know about the war, dubbed the War of Power, when these parties fought for dominance of the other three parties- Powerless Ones and whichever other parties they fought against- Hero or Wizard. They know the peace treaty signed, when all Benders and  Heroes and Wizards sustained too much damage. They know they are forbidden to communicate with each other, and although they are taught to recognize them, they must act like they are one of the Powerless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They know they must obey this rule above all others, otherwise they face exile, and their powers will be stripped from them- in the hero world by the mysterious Quirk known as All For One, in the bending world by just plain exile,  in the wizarding world by the destroying of one’s wand, and they will become none other than a Powerless One, haunted by the misery of their memories.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If Wizards or Benders give birth to a Hero, that Hero is to be left outside the Hero Training facility entrance, known as </span>
  <em>
    <span>UA High School</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and the Wizards shall act as though no child had ever been birthed to them. If Heroes give birth to a Wizard, they shall act accordingly and leave the baby outside Hogwarts. If a Bender is birthed to some Powerful One not a Bender (oop so messy) then the Bender is to be left outside the Air Temple, where the Air Nomads will distribute the baby to the correct training grounds.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And if Heroes or Benders give birth to a Powerless, that Powerless is to be put back into its own world at what they call an </span>
  <em>
    <span>orphanage</span>
  </em>
  <span>. But Wizards are more humane. They take care of the Powerless, known as a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Squib</span>
  </em>
  <span> in their world, and send it to education in the Powerless world instead of the wizarding schools- </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, Durmstrang</span>
  </em>
  <span>. The Powerless grows up with full knowledge of a Wizard, but to keep both Wizards and Heroes hidden safely, they must also honor the Wizarding Code and hide the existence of Wizards and Heroes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Occasionally, the Powerless give birth to Heroes or Wizards or Benders. In such cases, the world concerned accepts the parents and grants them full knowledge of the truth. It is impossible that one gives birth to both a Wizard and a Hero and a Bender, as ancient power prevents such incidents.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And such is the rule that maintained balance between the Powerless (though they do not know it), the Heroes, the Benders and the Wizards. Their methods were so explicitly similar, and yet so different. All Heroes, Benders and Wizards only begin training at age eleven to fourteen. All worlds are kept from the Powerless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And yet one thing is so obvious: The Wizards’ treatment of Powerless children is so much </span>
  <em>
    <span>kinder</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It will prove to be their fatal flaw.</span>
