    <p>
  <span>James giggled as he planted one last kiss on Teddy’s mouth before rolling off of them. He dropped onto the mattress next to his partner as Teddy pulled him closer. James started tracing invisible symbols on Teddy’s chest which still had a light sheen of sweat from their previous activities. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could lie here forever.” James murmured against Teddy’s skin, a light smile on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wish we could.” Teddy replied. Their voice had a tinge of sadness to it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Three more days. Three more days until I leave and then I’ll have to wait until Christmas to see you again.” James sighed forlornly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy tensed underneath his cheek. James looked up to find a guilty look on their face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” James said skeptically. He didn’t want to admit it, but Teddy had always felt like a dream that was too good to be true. His mind was already running wild with potential sentences that could fly out of Teddy’s mouth right this moment. Most of them wouldn’t end well. “What is it?” He asked again, holding himself up on one elbow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“James, I-” Teddy began, but they choked. They cleared their throat before trying again. “James, I think we have to go on a break.” Tears had started to form in their eyes as they sat up in the bed, nervously twiddling with the hem of the bedsheets.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James was silent for a moment, staring into nothing and taking in what had just been said. He pushed himself up to sit alongside his partner. “Why?” He asked eventually. “Is- is there someone--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“NO! No, Merlin, no.” Teddy cut him off. “There’s no one else.” Teddy cupped James’s cheek and rested their head against James’s. They sighed. “I should have told you sooner, but- I was offered a position as Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts and I took it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t understand.” James pulled away, shaking his head slightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jamie, we can’t date if I’m going to be your teacher.” Teddy explained. “After, sure, but not during the year.” James was pulling away fully now, his face set in anger and frustration. He started picking up stray pieces of clothing and tugged them on violently. “Please, please, stay. It’s only for a year!” Teddy got out of the bed now as well and tried to placate James with his words and reasoning. “It’ll be over in no time! We could get back together during the hols.” James continued to pick up his things. “We could finally tell your family once the year is over!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That made James freeze. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy had always been the one to be reluctant to tell the family they and James were in a relationship. James and them had gotten together when James was in his sixth year of school. Teddy felt like a perv at first. James seemed so young in years compared to them but they knew there would be no one else for them. James had seen reason in not telling anyone at first. It worked pretty well. They got to explore their relationship on their own without people breathing down their necks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the past few months, James had been getting more and more annoyed with being hidden away. He wanted to be able to go on real dates and be affectionate with Teddy in front of their family. He’d tried to get Teddy to change their mind, but to no avail. Until, now it seems.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did you say?” James’s knuckles turned white around the doorframe as he spoke in a tight voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck, Jamie. Do you think I like this? Do you think I don’t want to scream off the rooftops that I have the most amazing boyfriend in the world? I can’t! At first it was because you were still in school and it felt wrong. But now that I’m going to be your professor it just can’t happen. I really want to come out to everyone. I really fucking do, Jamie. I had hoped that this year might have been the year. And then they waved this offer around and I had to take it.” Teddy had been slowly approaching James where he was stood in the doorway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, James.” Teddy put a hand on his shoulder. “Please, say we can make this work.” Their forehead now pressed to said shoulder. “I love you. I don’t wanna lose you. But just for this year, can we take a break? And then we can start our lives together. Properly. I promise.” Teddy begged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James turned around with a sigh. “Just a year?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just a year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And we can spend all of the Christmas holidays together?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, please. I’m not gonna survive those two weeks otherwise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James cracked a small smile. “Yeah, what would you do without me, eh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy’s own smile beamed back at him. “Suffer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James rolled his eyes before dragging Teddy into a kiss. “Now, before we actually ‘go on a break’,” He ariquoted, “I think it’s only fair we make up now for all the time we’ll miss next semester.” James started pushing Teddy towards the bed while his partner curled their fingers around James’s shirt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think, that’s a very good idea.” With the tension in the room now completely dissolved, Teddy could breathe a little easier.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now, Mx Lupin.” Teddy was pushed onto the bed while James climbed on top of them. “Let’s have some fun.” James said with a wicked smile on his face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>&amp;&amp;</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy and James were clinging to each other, pressed together from toe to lip, in front of the fireplace. James pulled away minimally and tried to subtly wipe away a tear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Jay. Don’t cry. We’re not going off to war.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know. It’s just never been this hard before. I won’t get to kiss you till Christmas holidays. We’ll practically be broken up.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told you before, this is not a break up, it’s--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah yeah, it’s just a break because you have a stupid moral code. I know, Ted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy kissed him one last time. “You ready to head home now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James sighed. “I guess.” He turned to grab the Floo powder off the mantel before Teddy stopped him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait, I forgot! I have something for you.” Teddy pressed a galleon into his hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, thank you?” James raised a confused eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take a closer look.” Teddy urged. “Harry once told me a story of how Aunt Hermione passed messages around through enchanted galleons. I tried to recreate it, only this one will count down the days. It’ll reset after the winter holidays to count down the days till graduation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James flung himself around Teddy’s neck. “Thank you. This is so incredibly sappy. But I love it.” He looked Teddy straight in the eyes. “I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two stayed silent for a moment before James turned around to Floo home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you come say hi on the train?” James asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And with that, James, along with their relationship, disappeared into the green flames.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For now at least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&amp;&amp;</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on! Come on!” Lilly tried to pull along her whole family on Platform 9 ¾. Her parents smiling at her enthusiasm. Despite the divorce, Ginny and Harry were never on bad terms with each other. Harry still went to the weekly Weasley Family Dinners every once in awhile, and Ginny still invited him for drinks with their friends. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilly didn’t need to push along Albus as much as the rest of her family. He was just as happy to go back as she was. This was a relief for both Ginny and Harry since before The Incident, he wasn’t all that keen on that magical castle and all that came with it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But now, Albus was running along upfront, eager to get back on the train. His reason was obvious to both Harry and Ginny though. Albus’ reason was also flying into his arms at that moment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Scorpius hugged him back with just as much of an idiotic smile. It seemed as though they hadn’t seen each other in ages when in fact it had been about two weeks since they last got together over the summer. While they were initially very sceptical about Albus hanging around a Malfoy, both parents were glad he had found such a good friend and they had grown to love Scorpius after actually getting to know him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Potter. Weasley.” A voice came from their left. Draco Malfoy was stood there with a small smile on his face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy.” Ginny greeted back politely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Draco.” Harry said. “I’ve told you to stop calling me by my last name.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have.” He simply replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James had strayed behind and strolled in then without much cheer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You okay, bud?” Harry laid a hand on his head. He’d gotten so big, but still he couldn’t resist doing that like he would to his youngest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I’m fine. I guess it’s just senioritis, or whatever they call it.” James replied with a sigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The year hasn’t even begun yet.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well…” James trailed off. He spotted a bright blue head of hair in the crowd and his mood couldn’t have been more conflicted. He was both glad to have spotted Teddy, but at the same time, knowing they couldn’t be like before was torture.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He touched a hand to his chest to feel for the galleon hanging there. He had turned it into a necklace he swore to himself to never take off. James stared off into the distance before picking up his trunk and hauling it along with him to the train.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Jamie!” His father called after him. “No goodbyes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just one corner of his mouth tugged upwards at his absent mindedness. He took the few steps back towards his family and hugged them both.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“See you at Christmas break.” James said before stepping back to haul his trunk and his arse on the train.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James had settled in with his friends in one of the compartments, but they noticed he wasn’t very talkative.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thinking of Mystery Lover, are you, James?” Penny teased him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James’ head snapped around and his hand automatically strayed to the galleon hidden underneath his shirt. “Uh- yeah, I guess so.” He didn’t see the point in hiding it. They knew he had a special someone, they just didn’t know the details which was good. He sent a silent thanks to his former self for not having spilled the beans.The only thing he did spill was about Teddy’s gender and pronouns. He hoped to every deity in the world that his friends wouldn’t make the connection when Teddy introduced himself in class.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you ever tell us their name? This is so stupid. We know you’ve been with them for ages now, but we don’t even know a name!” Simon whinged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would if I could, mate. But especially now, it’s just difficult. Things got… complicated to say the least. We’re kind of on a break right now.” James explained. His last sentence was met with pained intakes of breaths.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? What is it?” James asked</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, Jamie. Being on a break as they say, it never ends well. You need to get real with them. Sometimes, I feel like this person is just playing with you.” Penny put a hand on his shoulder in comfort, but James shrugged it off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t know what you’re talking about.” He sounded cross. “This all is a lot more complicated than you might think. So, please. Stay out of it.” He tried his hardest to keep his voice even.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“James, are you sure this is what’s right? That this being on a break isn’t just an excuse for something else?” Simon tried.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James couldn’t take this though. Today was already hard enough. He sighed deeply before standing up and walking out. “Piss off the lot of you.” He left his friends behind whos called after him and walked down the corridor aimlessly to try to cool off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, he found himself sitting on the sinks in the bathroom, an unlit cigarette between his lips. His tattered Converse thunking on the cabinet sounded loud in the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The creaking hinges of the door opening grabbed his attention and he snapped his head around. Teddy walked in the cramped space. “There you are. You weren’t with your friends, so it was quite the quest finding you since they had no idea where you were either.” Teddy moved to lean back against the stall door in front of James.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi.” James felt minutely better despite the previous conversation which was still running through his thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi.” Teddy came closer and snatched the cig out of James’ hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Those things are bad for you and they don’t make you look as cool as you think.” Teddy proceeded to place it between their own lips and lit it with the tip of their wand. “Oh, don’t give me that look. I only give the good advice, it doesn’t mean I have to follow it.” He took a long drag and released it at the tiny window that stood ajar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James got off the sinks then and stepped towards Teddy. He took their hand to grab the cig right back and take a drag for himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They might not make me look as you as you think I think they do, but they do make me feel better.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were close now. Too close. Teddy closed their eyes and sighed as they felt James’ fingers brush their own. “Jay.” They whispered through the smoke. Teddy knew it couldn’t happen and that as the older one, they should know better, but this was already going south quickly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is being on a break an excuse for something else?” James asked suddenly. Teddy could hear how hard he was trying not to sound like a little kid. James tried so hard always to sound older than he was supposed to be. Teddy sometimes blamed himself for that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? No! Where did that come from?” Teddy tried to get James to look at them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just- Nevermind. A stupid thing one of my friends said.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy grabbed James’ chin to force his gaze on theirs. “Being on a break is not breaking up or an excuse to break up. Being on a break is necessary at this moment because of professional and ethical reasons.” Their eyes kept switching between James’ own until they saw he understood fully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay.” James nodded, “Sorry, I just feel like such a-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kid?” Teddy interrupted. “Don’t apologise for that. I am, too. I may look older and wear these fancy robes and make my own money now, but don’t you think I still wonder if someone will come hold my hand when I go to the Healer’s because I’m scared to go alone? I feel like a fucking flailing five-year-old on the inside.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James chuckled. “I’ll come with you next time to hold your hand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was Teddy’s turn to laugh then. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stood together for a moment in silence, grinning at each other. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I miss you.” James said softly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m right here.” Teddy replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not completely.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I guess not, but I’m not gone either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James leaned in, pushing their foreheads together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This cannot happen, Jamie.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re not at Hogwarts yet.” James tried to be clever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Still. It can’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James nodded. He knew it couldn’t, but he still wanted to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now, go back to your friends. Tell them they’re idiots. And I’ll see you at the feast tonight.” Teddy pressed a kiss to James’ temple before leaving. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to make James feel a lot better about today.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He flicked the half-smoked cigarette out the window, took one last look at himself in the mirror and went on his way back to his friends.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&amp;&amp;</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Settle down, settle down!” Teddy’s voice boomed through the room. “Great, thank you.” They jumped up onto the desk and got comfortable. “Now, I’m sure no one has any interest in actually getting anything done in this class seeing as this is just he first day of the year and I am the new professor. So instead, how about a little game.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The whole class agreed wholeheartedly which made Teddy smile. This class was last year students and he was afraid they might feel too old to play games. They caught James’ gaze then and they received a subtle thumbs up from him. Teddy felt reassured then. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Great! Okay, so, we’re going to do this the muggle way. As you can see, I have a ball of yarn here.” They held up said item. “You’re gonna throw this around and when you catch it, you’re gonna state your name and tell a fact about yourself before throwing it to another person. Hold on to the string though, the idea is to create a sort of spider web.” Teddy waited a minute as they overlooked the room for any sign of confusion, but finding none. “Let’s get this started then.” They threw the ball at someone sitting in the first row and the game started up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy intended for the ball to go around once, but as the criss-cross spider web of yarn grew denser, the students really started getting into it. Chuckles could be heard every once in a while and a few even got full laughs with all the stories being told. So, Teddy did the only sensible thing and let them keep going. They guessed it would be best to just keep going until all of the yarn was gone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James had last received the yarn and said that he once almost got grounded for winning a race against his mum. His whole family has been convinced he had cheated. James was the first however, to throw the yarn back to Teddy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, mister Potter. My name is Edward Remus Lupin and a fact about me is that my pronouns are they and them. I would very much appreciate if that was respected.” With that he threw the ball to another student who caught it but had her head tilted sideways in question. “Uh, Louise?” Teddy waved at her as if to wake her up from her trance. “You okay there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, sorry. Just, what do you mean?” She said</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do I mean with what?” Teddy asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The pronoun thing. They and them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, those are my pronouns.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy half-laughed, being caught off guard. They knew questions like this would come, but frankly, They had naively hoped the students would just accept it. “Because I don’t think he and him or she and her fit me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But, you’re a boy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aha, see that’s where you’ve got the wrong impression. I am in fact not a boy, nor am I a girl. I’m what is called a non-binary person. There’s loads of info online if you have questions, and I would be glad to answer them too, but not during class.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy could see James glaring at Louise from where they were sat on the desk. It almost made them smile, but they couldn’t. Teddy was scared they would have that look in their eye. They’d seen it in pictures with James. Apparently, subtlety went out the window when it came to James and they were lucky the family had not caught on yet. Bless Harry’s genes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now,” Teddy clapped their hands together. “Let’s get on with the game.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And it did. Louise had thrown the ball to another student named keith.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“New schoolyear, new me, I guess, so I would like to use this fact to inform you all that I am very gay.” Keith declared</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We know!” The whole class spoke at once, having Teddy burst out laughing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” Keith deflated a little before laughing along at the murmur of chuckles he received. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good lad!” Teddy cheered and went to high five Keith. “How would you like to help in setting up a QSA?” Keith’s face was in awe at Teddy’s request. “Come to me after class then. It’s an idea I’ve had since I was sat at these desks myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The class went by too quickly. Soon it was time for the students to move on to their next period. Keith was still going over some more details for the QSA idea before he too moved on with a task to create a formal proposal for Headmistress McGonagall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How did I do?” Teddy asked James who had been lingering in the back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Great. Good to start with a game.” James walked to the front to where Teddy was still leaning against their desk. He stopped not too close, but not too far away from them, just close enough to see the faint redness in Teddy’s cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks. I was really nervous, especially knowing that you’d be in this class.” Teddy focused their eyes on the floor as they mumbled this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, the ice is broken I’d say. No need to be nervous anymore.” James tried to keep the conversation going, not wanting to leave, but he didn’t know what else to say anymore. Instead he just rolled on his feet, lingering in this uncertain atmosphere hanging around them both.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have another class now?” Teddy broke the silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nope, free period now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, okay.” Teddy nodded their head. “This is weird right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“SO weird.” James let out a deep sigh, relieved he wasn’t the only one feeling this. “Can we make it not weird? I just want to get through this year and get back together and maybe move in and have three cats and discussions over which curtains to get for our bedroom and-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait wait, what?” Teddy cut James’s  babbling off. “Move in? You… wanna move in together?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, yeah.” James said bashfully. “I mean, if you want. I know you’re still young, but I’ve been thinking about our future together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you ask me again on graduation day?” Teddy said with a big smile. They really wanted to. It would be perfect. But Teddy couldn’t give an answer right now. This year had only just begun. They didn’t want to get ahead of themselves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Technically, I never-” James cut himself off this time at Teddy’s look. “Yes. I will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good.” Teddy gave a firm nod.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James was about two seconds away from fucking it all and grabbing Teddy by the collar to reel them in when-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jamie!” Penny exclaimed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both of their heads turned towards the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh! Sorry, are you busy?” Penny took in the two people before her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, miss Bunce. I was just done with mister Potter here.” Teddy said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, thanks professor Lupin. Have a good day!” James walked out with Penny by his side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&amp;&amp;&amp;</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t forget to buy your tickets! Get them early!” A cheerful girl yelled through the halls as she pressed a flyer into James’ hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James looked down at the piece of paper. ‘Yule Ball 2021’ the flyer said in big bold writing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, anyone special you’ll be taking?” Penny sounded out of nowhere, startling James.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jeez, Pen. Don’t do that.” He clutched his hand, and the flyer, to his chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She snatched it from his hand and had a look at it herself. “Seriously, though. Are you going and/or are you taking anyone?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James breathed deeply and started walking to the library. “I don’t know yet. Not even sure if I’m gonna go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mystery person still on your mind then? You feel bad you can’t take them?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James affirmed with a nod. He hated that she could read him so well. Why wasn’t she more like Simon? He was oblivious to most things around him. “Are you going then?” He asked her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably. And since I can’t bring Micah since he lives all the way on the other side of the pond, I’m gonna be going alone. You know, make a statement. You don’t need a date to go.” Penny said determined. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, what do you think of just inviting Simon and all three of us go together?” James proposed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Penny seemed to think it over. “Yeah, that sounds like a good idea! Let’s hurry, I’m sure Simon will fall asleep on his Divination homework if we don’t get there in time.” She pulled him along to the library.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There, they indeed did find Simon still awake and staring at his books. “Hey, Si!” Penny said, dropping the flyer on his homework. “You wanna come to the ball with us so we don’t look all sad and mopey going alone?” She plopped down in a chair next to him. She got no reaction back however. “Simon!” She tried. “Simon!” She clicked her fingers in front of his wandering gaze and that woke him up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? Oh! Hey guys.” Simon finally came back out of his daydream.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Damn, where did your head go?” James said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you know, just-” Simon made a vague gesture with his hands. “What’s up?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We want to know if you want to come to the ball with us.” Penny explained</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, uh.” Simon looked distracted and stared off into the distance next to Penny’s face. “I- Yeah, sure, I guess. Sounds fun.” He gave a small smile before looking back down at his work.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright.” Penny raised an eyebrow and shared a look with James who returned the same sentiment. Simon had been acting weird lately. “Now, show me what you got for the homework so I can correct all of it.” </span>
</p><p>

</p><p>
  <span>That night in the Gryffindor common room, they were all sat by the fire. Most of the other Gryffindors had gone up already but Simon, Penny, and James had a nasty habit of talking until the sun started to rise again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Penny was laid out across her two best friends. Her head in James’ lap and her feet in Simon’s. She and James were bickering over which candy to buy next time they were going to Hogsmeade. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Obviously chocolate frogs!” Penny argued. “You can never go wrong with chocolate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so bored of them though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t HAVE to eat them. More for me, ha!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But we always share. It’s basically why we’re friends. And you were the one who did the maths, it would be more efficient or whatever to each buy some and then share.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Simon, what do you think?” Penny knocked her foot into his thigh. Simon startled a little. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About what?” Simon asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The sweets, Simon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Simon just shrugged. “Pick whatever.” He then lifted Penny’s feet out of his lap and stood up. “I think I’m going to bed. Goodnight, guys.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They watched him hop up the stairs and out of view.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Seriously, what the hell is up with that guy. He’s usually the one who never stops talking about food.” James watched where Simon had disappeared out of view.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right?” Penny agreed. “He’s hiding something from me. I hate when he does that. Especially this time, because suddenly he’s succeeding at keeping it hidden from me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James laughed. “A very hard feat to accomplish.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Exactly. Like how you are trying to hide that your mystery lover is actually Professor Lupin.” Penny sat up with a smug smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James was laughing no more and froze. “How- how did you find out?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, love, the tension between you two is suffocating honestly. Well, to me it feels like that. But I think you’re in the clear when it comes to the rest of the student body and even the teachers. Plus, they/them pronouns, their older and it’s complicated? Not that hard to figure out with those specifics.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James let out a relieved sigh. “Am I that bad?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You both are. But you both seem to be happy with each other as well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We are.” James smiled to himself. “I mean, this year is going to be hard though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because you called a break.” She filled in, finally understanding their conversation they’d had on the train. “Must be tough. But Lupin did the right thing. I mean, could you imagine if you were ever found out?” Penny whispered scandalously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know. Of course I do. Merlin, Pen, they’re always so close yet so far.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Imagine how I feel with Micah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James threw an arm around her shoulders. “Why is love so hard?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, right.” They were silent for a moment. But then Penny smiled and pulled her knees up the couch. “So, tell me everything. You must be bursting. I know I would be if I had to keep Micah a secret.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James laughed and immediately flung himself into their whole history from how they got together until their last kiss in front of the fireplace. He showed her the necklace. He told her about their plans for the future. And she listened to every single word. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s something kinda sexy about it as well, no?” Penny said once James had finally fallen quiet. “Like this whole student-teacher thing. It’s so scandalous. It gives it sort of an edge.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James had to laugh at that. “Our relationship has edge enough, I’ll tell you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ew, Jamie, gross!” Penny chuckled. “But really, I haven’t seen you this happy since the first year of our friendship. I’m really glad you’ve found this already.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me too. I just wish things were less complicated.” He laid his head on her shoulder. “At first it was just the age difference and then the whole intricacy of our family and would they think it’s weird bc we’re kind of cousins slash brothers. But now it’s also the school thing.” He sighed. “Sometimes it feels like so much. Like we’ll never be able to be out there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will.” Penny reassured him. “It’s less than a year now. We’re gonna have a great senior year and then we’re all free.” She wrapped her arms around him awkwardly and kissed the top of his head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, Pen. I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you, too, you big doofus. Come on, now. Off to bed. It’s way too late already.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Up the went to their respective bedrooms and managed to get enough sleep not to have their heads thunk on their desks the next day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&amp;&amp;&amp;</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Chatter and music sounded loudly through the nearly empty Hogwarts hall. James could hear Diana Ross’s ‘I’m coming out’ booming through the door of Teddy’s classroom. This made him chuckle. Of course Teddy would go all out and even have the music fit perfectly. Some confetti seemed to have made its way from under the door and was strewn all over the floor of the hallway. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James felt strangely nervous walking in there. It’s not that he tried to hide that he was gay, it’s more so that he was never the one to shout it from the rooftops and walking through that door felt an awful lot like shouting to him, even if he did have the chance to play it off as being the S in QSA. But he wanted to do this. For Teddy. For himself. For the other queer kids who knew his famous parents and to whom it might give reassurance. He knew he carried some clout because of his last name, may as well put it to good use.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James took a breath and turned the doorknob and took a step forward. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jamie!”, was yelled out at his entrance and heads turned to the doorway where he was still stood. It was Penny who rushed over to him and hugged him tightly. “So good to see you here! So, care to inform us what letter you are coming for?” She then held up a few buttons, some with a Q, some with an S. It took James a moment but he finally figured out what they were for. Once he did, he looked back at Penny with a smile, she herself was still waiting if he wanted to take the plunge. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll have a Q thanks.” He took the button from her and pinned it to his sweater. Immediately it began to fill with colour to form the gay rainbow flag. “Oh that’s cool!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have them charmed so they form whatever flag fits your identity.” Teddy chimed in, having slowly crept towards them. James noticed their button changing flags like those fade in-fade out photo presentations. It went from the non-binary flag to the pansexual flag to the trans flag. “You don’t have to wear it if you don’t feel like it, but it’s yours to keep if you want it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James had noticed not everyone seemed to be wearing them. Like Simon who was talking to Penny next to him. His shirt was void of any coloured pin. James damned the boy internally. He had been curious about Simon since the beginning, especially since he’d had a small crush on him when they were younger. Penny’s own button was striped black and white with a big S in the middle of it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Jamie?” James snapped out of his daze and looked over at Penny. “We’re just going to mingle a little okay?” Penny gave him a look, which meant to take his time with Teddy. He was really thankful he had her as a friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James walked over to Teddy. They were sat with crossed legs on their desk, their favourite spot to sit, overlooking the room with a small smile on their face. When their eyes caught James’, they seemed to sit just a little bit more upright.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi.” James said when he was close enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Potter.” Teddy said cheekily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James shook his head lightly and chuckled. “Oh come on, Teddy. That’s for class.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy echoed with their own chuckle. “Yeah, You’re right. I’m messing with you, lo- James.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James’ eyebrows shot skyward when hearing Teddy’s slip. Both of them hoped no one had been paying enough attention. Teddy cleared their throat as if to erase their mistake while James looked around to see if anyone had heard. They got lucky this time, the loud music and chit-chat that flowed around them had covered for them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James took a deep breath. “So,” He let out, “Seems like we got a pretty good turn-out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, indeed. Seems like there are more queer kids at this school than some people would like to acknowledge. It’s good to bond together, I guess. Have a safe space.” Teddy uncrossed his legs and bumped his heels against the back panel of the desk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have a lot of plans in mind then to keep this going?” James was trying to pull as many questions as he could out of thin air, just to have an excuse to stay and talk longer with Teddy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I compiled a whole list of stu- Hey, isn’t that your sister?” Teddy pointed towards to door and James turned to see.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, Yeah?” James rubbed his eyes as if he couldn’t believe what he was seeing. “And it seems she came with Alice Longbottom?” James’ eyebrows shot upwards again as he saw the two girls hold hands and smile brightly at one another while Penny offered them both a pin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy jumped off their desk and made a beeline for the two girls, James right on his heel. “Lily! Alice! Welcome!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Ted!” Lily said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s professor Lupin to you.” They joked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily waved him off. They weren’t her teacher after all. Not yet, at least. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, Lils?” James chimed in. “Something you wanna say?” He vaguely gestured at her bi-colored pin and gave her a curious look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh! Yes, Jamie, I guess I should introduce you to my girlfriend, Alice.” At Lily’s introduction, Alice gave a small wave and smile which James returned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, how did this come to be?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, we’ve been dating for a while actually. It kinda just happened, but we’ve both been really cautious about telling people. And now that Teddy decided to start the QSA, we both felt there was finally space for us, you know? We didn’t feel like hiding it anymore.” Lily looked over at Alice. “Because I love her and I want everyone to know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice giggled and pressed a small kiss to Lily’s mouth, whispering and ‘I love you, too’.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James felt really happy for them and he smiled warmly at his sister and her girlfriend. “I’m really happy for you. And know, that I’ll be there if you decide to take her home and come out.” At this, Lily gave him an understanding nod. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The same goes for you, big bro.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” James said before he remembered the rainbow coloured pin he was wearing. “Oh, shit, uh. Yeah, thanks.” It was then that a thought occurred to him and he started laughing. When he saw both Teddy and Lily’s looks of confusion, he took a deep breath to steady himself. “Oh, man. Poor Albus. The pressure is really on for that guy now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The four of them started laughing hard then, a few heads turning their way with looks as if they had more than just a few loose screws.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was at this moment, the door opened and Albus walked in, with Scorpius behind him. When the group noticed, their already maniacal laughter got even worse. Albus’ eyes grew wide. He hadn’t expected everyone of his family to be there and ran back out after a few hurriedly exchanged words with Scorpius. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Scorpius seemed a lot more confident than Albus and took Penny’s offered pin before apologising and running after his friend. James knew there was a story there, but he also knew not to push his brother. Albus would come to him when he needed it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Teddy, James, Lily, and Alice had all finally calmed down from laughing, Penny strode up to them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Honestly, you scared your brother away.” She tried to scorn them, but couldn’t hold back a smile herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, come on, Pen. We didn’t scare him away.” James said, wrapping an arm around her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, whatever, Jamie.” She pushed him away laughing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s so funny?” Simon’s familiar voice came from behind them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Penny and James turned around simultaneously. “Hey, Si.” Penny said overly bright. both her and James had a big question ready to burst out of the at any moment seeing Simon here. Though, neither knew it was wrong to push despite their burning curiosity. Simon became aware of that too. Simon sighed and gave in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I’m not gay, but I’m not sure what I am okay. I did actually like Agatha when we were dating. No, I don’t have a boyfriend now. Yes, I’ve liked guys, and I’ve thought about it for a while, and it’s a recent crush that really made me come here. Did that answer most of your questions, Penny?” Simon sounded exasperated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, actually.” Penny seemed surprised. James didn’t know why, Penny and Simon have known each other for so long. She should have seen this coming. “One more thing.” Simon threw his head back in frustration at her question. “What guy, and did anything happen yet. Please tell me, tell me, tell me!” She whined.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Simon looked like a lost puppy for a moment, but he quickly covered it up by looking at Penny incredulously before walking away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Seriously, what is up with that guy?” Penny threw her hands up and turned back to James.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He threw his arm back around her and shared a look with Teddy who mouthed a ‘talk later’ before removing himself from the group. He saw his sister and Alice had walked away to talk with some friends. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, let it go, Penny. Simon is fine. He’ll come around. He’s going through it right now. It’s not easy dealing with feelings that seem wrong and right at the same time.” James calmed Penelope down, and he hoped himself that his words were true.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When did you get so wise?” She asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I guess I’ve had some experience with this stuff.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>&amp;&amp;&amp;</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James and Penny had just left their potions class when Simon came running up to them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Penny! Penny!” Simon panted. “You have to come with me now!” He grabbed her by the wrist and pulled her along, James following on their heels.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wha- Simon, what’s going on?!” She said worriedly, her body rigid and in fear as she ran along with Simon. “If it’s another dragon, I swear to Merlin, Simon.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they reached the Great Hall, Simon let go of Penny’s wrist. “Stay there.” He said with a firm look. He then disappeared into the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Penny turned around to James who was just as confused as she was and gave a shrug in answer to her questioning look. He could not for the life of him figure out what the hell was going on. However, when heart-shaped confetti started falling from the ceiling, things started to click in James mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He saw Penny lift a hand and look up at the confetti in awe despite still being confused. She was a smart one, but James had never seen her so oblivious. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Penelope Bunce!” A voice boomed from the crowd that had gathered, and soon the parted to let a lanky boy through. Penny’s eyes widened and a beaming smile appeared on her face. “Will you please go to the yule ball with me?” Above his head sparkled the word ‘YULE BALL?’ in magical fireworks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James had never in his life seen Penny speechless, it was truly priceless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Micah! I- how- what?” Penny launched herself at him and swung her arms around his neck. He caught her with ease and a chuckle and lifted her off the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You haven’t answered my question, yet.” His american accent drawled. Micah set her back down and looked down at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you American idiot!” The crowd clapped as she hugged her boyfriend again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the meantime, Simon had come to stand by James again. “I’m assuming this is your doing?” James said to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nah, it was mostly Micah, he just needed a little help with the logistics.” Simon shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that why you’ve been so weird, lately?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Simon deflated a little at his question and stared ahead at where Penny and Micah were talking with their heads bent together and mirrored smiles. “Yeah, I guess.” He said in a flat voice. His gaze drifted away from his friends to further into the crowd and it turned sour. James didn’t dare to ask though. “I gotta go.” Simon walked away without another word.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James watched him go before sighing and stepping towards Penny and Micah. “Hey guys!” He hugged them both. “How crazy is this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know right?” Penny was positively beaming. James thought he might get blinded by her radiating smile. “That was so cheesy and super American and kind of hetero- and gendernormative.” Penny laughed. “But I loved it.” Her voice, just as her gaze, turned soft as she turned towards her boyfriend. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m happy for you guys.” James said sincerely, though he had to admit he was also kind of jealous that he couldn’t go to the yule ball with his better half himself. He felt a slight pang in his heart. Penny noticed and gave his shoulder a squeeze as they shared a look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“James!” Lily’s voice sounded, breaking the moment between the two friends. “James, can I talk to you for a second? I need your help with something.” She was stood a little ways away and jerked her head for him to come to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, Pen. Big brother duty calls.” He walked off towards his little sister and she grabbed him by the arm into a nearby alcove. “What is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, so, I just saw what happened with Penelope and her boyfriend. It was so adorbs and now I kinda wanna do the same for Alice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“OH! Oh wow. Good on you, sis.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you help me please? I mean, I’ll basically be making a public coming out as well and I don’t want to pressure Alice into something so I wanna make sure that she’ll be okay with this but I don’t wanna spoil the surprise either and also I need this to be a big gesture too like super romantic and great and I want her to be totally woo’d and-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“LILY!” James interrupted her and grabbed her by the shoulders. “Since when do you ramble?” His sister has never been a loud, talk-y kind of person. “But yes, I will help you figure something out. Don’t we worry. We got this.” He held up a fist and she bumped it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&amp;&amp;&amp;</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was Saturday morning. And Saturday mornings meant sleeping in, stealing food from the Great Hall to bring upstairs to share and talk. It had been James and Simon’s dorm room tradition since year three and they didn’t plan on breaking it now. They alternated getting the food based on who woke up first. Usually, that meant James. Thought, it never too long after coming back with breakfast for Simon to wake up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>However, this time seemed to be different. James had woken up and gotten the food with his roommate Keith and laid out a proper buffet on the floor in the middle of the room. The other two boys had woken in that time as well, only Simon seemed to still have his curtains closed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The four of them looked confused at each other before Keith silently concocted a plan. The smile on his face turned just the right side of mischievous and he made big gestures to quietly explain the plan to his roommates. When they all nodded that they understood, the four of them surrounded Simon’s bed and on the count of three they pulled open the curtains yelling any versions of ‘wake up’. Their fun stopped quickly when they were shocked to find not one, but two bodies in Simon’s bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Simon literally jumped up and shrieked in his bed from being scared so badly, the other person barely stirred. “WHAT THE FUCK!” He yelled back at the four confused guys surrounding him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, yeah, same here, dude.” Keith waved his hand over the whole scene.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Simon gasped, having forgotten he wasn’t alone under his sheets, but also very naked. “Fuck!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe later.” A familiar voice sleepily slurred. James now recognized that pale skin and dark hair to be Baz Pitch’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Holy shit!” James laughed. “Si, good on you dude!” He punched Simon in the shoulder and the latter fell backwards with an embarrassed groan from where he was sitting upwards.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Baz finally moved then. He stretched out his body lazily and without any shame, as if he knew he was a sight for sore eyes with an attitude so cool it would freeze your nose off. “Well, this seems like a situation I don’t wanna be in.” Baz pushed off the sheets and picked up his clothes in all his naked glory. James really was happy for Simon, his friend had good taste.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Baz dressed quickly, James whispered his last thought to Simon who just slapped him in the chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I appreciate it.” Baz said. James must not have been as quiet as he thought. Baz walked back towards the bed and leaned over. “See you later.” A coy and flirty smile was set on his face before he planted a lingering kiss on Simon’s lips. On his way out, he picked up an apple from the buffet that was still waiting to be eat and bit on to it before he disappeared.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The five of them watched him go and their room stayed so quiet they could hear the whispering and gasps from the people in the common room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t until a few minutes later they they all started talking at once. Well, all of them except Simon who was still sat in the middle of the bed flabbergasted by what had just happened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His brain finally spun into gear then. “Guys. Guys! GUYS!” Simon finally got them quiet. “I don’t wanna talk about it.” He flopped down on the bed, rolled himself in his sheets and spelled them closed again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone looked to James then. He nodded to make it clear he would handle this. He only hoped Simon didn’t think to spell his curtains so that he couldn’t open them. James waited for the others to leave the room before he tried lifting a curtain which luckily gave way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Simon?” James said softly. He sat himself cross-legged at the foot of the bed and put a hand on his friend’s ankle over the sheets. Simon merely grunted in response.”Ah come on, man. Let’s talk. Or not. You don’t have to tell me anything.” Simon removed the sheets from his face and shot him an I-don’t-believe-you-look. “Okay fine, I wanna know all the juicy details, but seriously, I’m here for you man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Simon sighed and sat up then. “I wish I could tell details, but I don’t even know what’s happening  to be honest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, it started a while ago, we got drunk and it just kinda happened. And it kept happening. Again and again. And, I don’t know, we’ve not talked about it. I’m kinda scared because I didn’t even know I was gay or if I am at all. I don’t even know if I like the guy, or if it’s just the sex or something else entirely.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James scooted closer and pulled him into a quick, awkward hug. “You don’t have to know anything, you know. Also, no one said you have to label anything. Though, if you ask me, seems like you’ve been doing some pretty gay things though.” They both chuckled. “Is that why you’ve been so weird?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Simon nodded. “I see everyone being happy with their dates, especially now with the yule ball coming up. And I just keep thinking about him.” He ran a hand over his face in frustration. “I just wanna stop thinking about him. He’s always there, in my head, lurking like the little creep. And I just-” He clenched his fists and growled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Si, sounds like you’ve got it pretty bad for this guy.” James weighed in. “I kinda see it too, you two together. As to figuring out your identity, well, that’s a personal thing.” He paused, thinking for a moment. “Though, I might have something to help you along with that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James got up and rifled through his trunk, mumbling to himself. “AHA!” He triumphantly held up the badge he’d received after the first QSA meeting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will that work even if you don’t know yourself?” Simon asked skeptically.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James shrugged. “Worth a try, no?” He planted himself on the bed again in front of Simon. “You don’t have to do it if you don’t want to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Simon rolled his eyes and snatched the badge out of James’ hands. It swirled with colours before dividing itself into four different segments. “I have no idea what all of these colour mean.” He looked expectantly at James.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yeah, sure. So this one means bi, this one is pan, this one is poly, and that I would assume means questioning. There’s not really a flag for that to my knowledge, but the question mark seems pretty obvious.” James explained while pointing at the different segments.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you know?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, so, Teddy is pretty big on this stuff and they went through a lot of self-discovery. But also, whenever we’d go to pride they would actually quiz me on this shit and I guess it stuck.” James laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Simon smiled, but sadly. “I wish I had what you two have.” James looked surprised at his remark. “Penny told me.” Simon said. James nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love them. And thanks. But you really don’t. At least not now.” They were quiet for a moment. “Baz will come around. And if he doesn’t, well then he doesn’t know what he’s missing out on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks. I hope you’re right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me too. Because I mean that. Younger me is screaming.” James snorted at himself before getting off the bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait, what?” Simon finally got off too and picked up his clothes to follow James down to the common room and finally get breakfast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh nothing. Just that I used to have a small crush on you when we first met and I wish I had known you were queer then.” James shrugged as if it’s not big deal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dude!” Simon shoved him playfully. “That might be the sweetest thing anyone’s ever said to me.” He clutched his heart and fake cried.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shove off.” They both laughed as James threw an arm around his mate and walked down the stairs with him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait.” Simon said before they reached the room. “I’d appreciate it if you and the others could keep this quiet.” He sounded more serious than James had ever known him to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah of course. I’ll make sure the others keep their mouths shut too. If not I’ll send Lily after them. She inherited mum’s outstanding bat bogey hex ability.” James winked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&amp;&amp;&amp;</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James had been waiting for ten minutes by the classroom door and grabbed Baz by the arm when he finally came out of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey!” Baz wrenched himself loose.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just know, Pitch, if you break my boy’s heart, I will come after you.” James threatened, poking him in the chest. “Do not play with his feelings. Either take Simon out or bounce. He deserves to be treated right.” James gave him one last look and turned on his heel. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t see the puzzled, yet hopeful feeling growing inside Baz. That was okay, Baz’s decision would be clear soon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&amp;&amp;&amp;</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The murmur of everyone making smalltalk buzzed in the room as people settled in their seats or shared food and drinks. The couches and chairs had been placed in a choatic semi-circle facing a white screen at the front of the classroom. Soon most of the seating spaces were taken and Teddy stood in front of the mass of students that had shown up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you everyone for being here at our second QSA meeting. I’m very glad to see some familiar, but also lots of new faces today.” That earned them a small cheer from the crowd. “Today, we’re taking things a little slower which means movie time! I hope everyone’s got snacks and drinks. Shout out to the ‘Puffs for providing those.” A group to his right whoo’d and whistled at them. Teddy laughed a little. “Alright settle down! The movie we’ll be watching today is called Pride. It’s one of my personal favourites. So, enjoy, everyone.” They set up the movie and moved to the back of the class to settle on one of the couches they had transfigured. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The couch just so happened to be occupied by James as well. This was, of course, a total coincidence. At least that’s what Teddy told themselves, their brain rushing to find any and all excuses to sit by James. And if they scooted just a little closer than would be deemed appropriate, then no one else would have to know. Both James and Teddy were glad for the close proximity in the barely lit room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was silent as the movie showed its opening scenes, but soon enough people whispered commentary to their friend or datemate. One couple had absolutely no shame and just started making out. Teddy was about to interfere as things seemed to get out of hand, but a guy next to them whisper-yelled ‘get a room’. The couple jumped up in surprise and ran out of the room, giggling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy huffed and shook their head. “Hey, we weren’t- aren’t much better.” James whispered from beside them. Teddy noticed his tense-slip up but decided not to mention it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, but still. We never snogged with a teacher in the room. We only did that in regular cinema settings.” Teddy smirked and bumped their knee against James’.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, we did that in all kinds of settings.” James added and mimicked Teddy’s kneebump.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James turned his head to look at Teddy, but found them already staring at him. It made his breath stutter for a moment. The nostalgic and longing emotion that was swirling in those beautiful eyes took James by surprise. If he was completely honest, he’d been scared if this break would turn into a break up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James knew the age gap sometimes took a toll on them. James was still too much of a kid sometimes and when he slept over at Teddy’s place things could get ugly. They bickered which turned into fighting about stupid things like how James leaves clothes all over the place as if he expects his mother to pick up after him. Or how Teddy had to work late sometimes or work at all and James couldn’t understand why they couldn’t always have a night out on a Wednesday. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’d never outright screamed at each other in fury, but voices had been raised before. Luckily, they both knew to take a walk if things got too heated. It was a rule they’d made to protect their relationship early on. Teddy came up with it, James was grateful for it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It got ugly at times. But when James saw the look Teddy was giving him now, he sincerely hoped they would be fine. Even if he wasn’t completely convinced yet that they’d come out of this year unharmed. But he had hope.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What.” Teddy whispered after James had been quietly staring for a while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you.” James breathed, barely loud enough to be heard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy bit their lip and looked to the front again, however they reached out in search of James’ hand and intertwined their fingers before giving it a squeeze. “Me too.” He said after a while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sounds of the movie filled the heavy silence between them. James hoisted his legs up onto the couch as an excuse to half cuddle up to Teddy. He put his other hand on top the one Teddy was already holding and enjoyed the moment he could have with them. They were few and far between back when they weren’t on a break. But now it was a miracle if they even had a minute to talk alone. James could hear Teddy sigh and knew they felt the same.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&amp;&amp;&amp;</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James mentally high fived himself. He’d done a good job with this promposal he’d helped Lily prepare. Alice was one lucky girl. It had been quite the challenge setting everything up without her knowing about it. James also found out that his little sister is an amazing liar which made him very suspicious of all the excuses she’s made over the years to not have to do chores. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James sighed as he sprinkled the last of the flower petals on the floor. His little sister wasn’t so little anymore all of the sudden. She had a girlfriend now, a serious girlfriend. James had to laugh though, being queer might not be contagious, but it sure as hell seemed to run in the family.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You done?” Lily said from behind him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yep, good to go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily’s phone went off then. “Yes! Rose just let me know that Alice is on her way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good luck.” James said to her before kissing the top of her head. She may have grown up, but he was still quite a lot taller than her. He went to hide behind a pillar so he could view the whole thing and held out his phone to record it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice appeared then in the hallway leading to the courtyard. She had followed the trail of petals all the way from the dorms to here. The bright smile on her face warmed James’ heart. He had to be quick to follow her as she followed the trail to where Lily was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A small crowd had gathered, mostly of Lily and Alice’s friends to watch the scene unfold. It was quite, well, magical. James had figured out a spell to make snowflakes fall from the sky, only he had modified it so they were specs of light, almost like fireflies. It turned the whole courtyard into a scene out of the sappiest romcom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as Lily saw her girlfriend approach she started playing on the ukulele she had gotten for her birthday two years ago. She’d taught herself and had gotten really good at it. That wasn’t all, though, because Lily also had a beautiful singing voice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quand il me prend dans ses bras</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Il me parle tout bas,</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Je vois la vie en rose.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Il me dit des mots d’amour,</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Des mots de tous les jours,</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Et ça me fait quelque chose.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Il est entré dans mon c?ur</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Une part de bonheur</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Dont je connais la cause.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>C’est lui pour moi, moi pour lui dans la vie,</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Il me l’a dit, l’a juré pour la vie.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Et dès que je l’aperçois</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Alors je sens en moi</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Mon coeur qui bat</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Hold me close and hold me fast</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>The magic spell you cast</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>This is la vie en rose</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>When you kiss me, heaven sighs</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>And though I close my eyes</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>I see la vie en rose</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>When you press me to your heart</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>I’m in a world apart</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>A world where roses bloom</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>And when you speak, angels, sing from above</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Everyday words seem</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>To turn into love songs</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Give your heart and soul to me</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>And life will always be</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>La vie en rose</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time Lily had stopped singing Alice was in tears. Her sobs of disbelief and amazement were drowned out however by the clapping and hooting that came from the crowd. Alice slowly walked to her girlfriend and they kissed awkwardly since both were smiling too much. When Lilly pulled back, she took out the rainbow coloured flag that she’d stuck in her back pocket of her jeans to hold it up. On it the words ‘Yule ball?’ was painted in glittery paint. At that Alice starting nodding like a mad woman and kissed her girlfriend again, setting off the crowd again into happy clapping and cheering.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James was right there too, clapping and cheering on his little sister. He was happy for her. She seemed to have found real love so early on in her life. He shared a look with Lily that hopefully conveyed how proud he was of her. She nodded in understanding before he slunk back into the shadows to wander the grounds with his thoughts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was strange, seeing everyone in love out in the open. He touched the galleon still hanging around his neck and took it out from underneath his shirt to hold in his fist. James walked down to the lake to sit and think. He twirled the galleon around in his fingers and suddenly felt anger for all that he couldn’t have, for all that he hasn’t been able to have the past year. He knew it wouldn’t be long until Teddy and he could be out in the open like the rest of them, but at that moment it just felt so unfair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If he was honest with himself, James knew he felt lost on a lot of accounts. It was his last year at Hogwarts and he felt like he was just floating around in the dark. It was disorienting and making it hard to breathe at times. He felt like he was falling behind on his friends who seemed to be doing just fine finding their way through to graduation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James calmed himself down with the spiteful thought that at least Albus didn’t have a girlfriend yet, just so the heat would be off James at family parties for a little at least. At least Alus bore half of the brunt of their family wanting to know every bit of their personal lives. And when James had a good day, he could even deflect all of the questions to his younger brother. It wasn’t the nicest move of him, but a necessary one since he wasn’t the best at lying. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James huffed and shook his head at himself. “I’m such an idiot.” He told himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, we all know that, but why this time?” Penny’s voice sounded as she came to sit next to him. She’d brought Simon along too who sat on James other side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James shrugged non-committedly in response to her question. “Self-imposed, imaginary sibling rivalry.” James said then.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.” Penny nodded. “I know that all too well. Only in my household, not so imaginary.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop complaining. At least you guys have siblings. Or a family at all for that matter.” Simon chimed in, annoyed. “Or an actual boyfriend.” He muttered, ripping off tufts of grass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both Penny and James looked at each other in shame before they shared the same idea mentally and tackled Simon to the ground with hugs. Simon squealed and laughed when Penny played dirty and started tickling him. James made sure he didn’t run from her torture. She was only satisfied when Simon yelled out ‘I give’. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The three of them lied down on the ground intertwined, catching their breaths. Simon had a best friend in each of his arms and James could only hope he felt how much Penny and him loved Simon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Si.” James got a hum in acknowledgement. “You know we are your family right?” Penny grabbed James’ hand to hold over Simon’s stomach and laced their fingers together loosely. “Just because you have no blood relatives doesn’t mean you don't have a family.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you.” Simon whispered to them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We love you, too.” Penny said. “As for the boyfriend thing, well, I can only hope Basilton comes around. If not, well, then he doesn’t know what he’s missing out on and you’ll be long swept off your feet by a better person by the time he does realise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Simon squeezed them both closer. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&amp;&amp;&amp;</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dinner in the great hall was a tumultuous affair. The applause had just died down from the last person who got a Yule Ball proposal from their crush or significant other. James smiled to himself having seen the display. These proposals were getting bigger and better by the minute. More significantly though, they were getting more queer too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ever since Teddy had started their QSA, kids have been feeling a lot safer around school. Sure, the bigots were still around, but they weren’t so quick to bully anyone anymore. Especially with Teddy themselves walking around the halls to keep their students safe and they had recruited a small group of burly people to keep an eye out on the younger kids. James was one of them. He’d been feeling a lot more protective over his little sister since he found out about her girlfriend. Lily could handle herself just fine, James knew, but he couldn’t help but feel that it was his brotherly duty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James looked around the hall, all the way to the other side. At the Slytherin table he saw Albus and Scorpius sitting together. James still wasn’t sure of the true nature of their relationship, but he could see the fond looks they shared, even if they had no idea they were into each other. He hoped they knew. He may not have been the best brother in the past and teased Albus about his house and his relationship with Scorpius, but that all faded away once he had his own slightly scandalous secret with Teddy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James looked a little further along the table and saw Baz sitting there. He seemed to be deep in thought and looked over at the Gryffindor table, catching James’ eye by accident. Baz looked caught of guard at first, but nodded then, James mirrored him. It was a simple gesture, but it seemed to wipe the conflicted look off his face to be replaced by determination. Baz stood and left the Great Hall then. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>One table closer James found his sister and her girlfriend having dinner together with friends. She seemed happy which in turn made him happy. More so, he was proud of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally he landed back at his own table. Micah and Penny were both discussing her extra credit potions homework, but Simon seemed to just push his food around with his fork. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You okay, mate?” James asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Simon shrugged. “Sure.” Just a few minutes ago, Simon was completely fine until-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, remember what me and Pen told you. If Baz is so stupid as to let you go, then that’s his loss.” James gave Simon’s arm a squeeze. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s just hard seeing everyone being asked out and -” Simon cut himself of with a sigh. “I’m being so stupid about this. This isn’t me. I wasn’t so heartbroken and hung up on Agatha last year.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Si, there might be a good reason for that. It just means that you really care this time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Caring sucks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It does.” James and Simon shared a sad smile at both the hardships in love.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t last long however, soon the whole hall was reduced to whispers. James looked up and saw Baz standing behind Simon with a flower in his hand. James looked happily shocked and gave Simon’s arm a slap to draw his attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ow, dude, what the-” Simon saw the look on James’ face and turned around when he pointed to look behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Baz was standing there, bashful. All his cool confidence gone from his frame. He looked paler than usual and a little terrified. Baz’ mysterious vibe earned him the reputation of a player. Though, a reputation was just that, because when James thought about it, he’d never known Baz to actually break any hearts around the school. There were only rumours. Still, him declaring anything to anyone with a flower nonetheless was groundbreaking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baz?” Simon whispered, waiting for Baz’ next move.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Baz cleared his throat then and walked to the Hufflepuff table to stand on the bench. “Simon Snow!” He exclaimed for the nearly silent hall to hear. “Will you do me the honour of accompanying me to the Yule Ball?” He held out the flower, it was an ambrosia flower. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ohmygod.” Penny whispered to herself. She clutched onto James shoulder and said to him: “The ambrosia flower means reciprocated love.” This made James gasp. It seemed Baz had taken his advice to heart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They watched as Simon stood up and grabbed the flower from Baz’ hand before looking back up to him. He nodded and smiled brightly. “Yes! I would love that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Baz let out a huge sigh of relief and jumped off the bench. His feet had barely touched the ground when Simon pulled him by his tie and kissed him. A lot of the Gryffindor last years were cheering, with Penny and James being the loudest. After that whole ordeal in the room, they were all glad for Simon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Baz locked eyes with James as he was hugging Simon. James nodded, Baz mirrored him. Simon pulled out of the hug and spoke to Baz in a hushed voice who nodded with a small smile on his face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, will you bring me up some food later?” Simon asked James. “We’re gonna be away for a bit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.” James yelled as they were walking away hand in hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In return he got a “Piss off” thrown back at him, making him laugh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They all settled down again at their table, James busy making a plate for Simon to take after he was done with his own dinner. He could hear their friends making jokes about Simon and Baz and what they could possibly be up to right now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Penny leaned over to him. “So, what are you gonna do for Yule Ball, then?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James froze, not having realised that with his two friends paired off with their own dates, he would be fifth wheel when tagging along. “Fuck.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&amp;&amp;&amp;</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mate, I’m so sorry.” Simon clapped a hand on James’ shoulder. “I didn’t think and now you’ll be all alone there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine. You’ve all got your dates and I’m happy for you.” James told him. He meant it too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were still in their room getting ready for the big night. James in the end had agreed to help out for a few hours at the Yule Ball doing snacks and chaperoning. He had his shift and was free to do whatever he wanted outside of that. James was just glad he’d have something to do at the Ball. He didn’t wanna miss it, but he also didn’t feel like turning people down. This shift gave him the perfect excuse to be vague about maybe owing any dances.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know you’re monogamous or whatever, but would they really mind you taking someone?” Simon asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James shrugged. “I’m sure it’d be fine if we’d discussed it, but it’s more that I just don’t want to. I think I’d have a better time on my own, then with someone who isn’t Teddy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh man, that’s cheesy as fuck.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.” James preened at that. James put together his outfit then. He wore simple black trousers and formal shoes and a white shirt. His jacket however was a muted gold colour which he’d found online and had shipped over to his dorm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Damn, Jamie. You clean up nice!” Simon praised from across the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James laughed and turned around. “Not so bad yourself, Si.” The burgundy suit with a tight black pattern on it fit him amazingly. “Baz’s not gonna know what hit him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James walked up to Simon and adjusted his wonky black bowtie before brushing off the imaginary dust off his friend’s shoulders and gently pushing him to the common room. Downstairs they found Micah and Baz making smalltalk. Penny must have given them the password. Though, James had a sneaking suspicion that Micah may have known it already. Penny was known to find a way around the gender-bias of the staircase.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Baz turned towards the sound of their stomping down the stairs, his expression could only be described as amazement. Simon seemed to notice it too and blushed fiercely under Baz’ gaze. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow, Baz.” James said from beside Simon, breaking the moment. “I know I look great, but it’s kinda rude to stare at me with your boyfriend right beside me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up.” Baz honest-to-god playfully swatted at James’ shoulder once he was within reach. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James gave a cackle as he avoided the slap and moved to stand by Micah to witness this new stammering Simon Baz managed to bring out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You look-” Baz started, not able to finish his sentence with any fitting word.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks.” Muttered an unusually shy Simon. “You too.” They just stood there smiling at each other for a moment, lost in their own little bubble. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It reminded James of him and Teddy and their first real date when they were basically already halfway in love. The memory left him with a bittersweet feeling and he touched the galleon where it was tucked into his breast pocket. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When an annoyed huff and a pained ‘ow’ came from up the other stairs, they all turned to see Penny. This time it was Micah’s turn to be starstruck. She looked amazing in her two piece purple dress. It was simple with a long poofy chiffon skirt and mesh top, but the floral design on the top gave it just that little bit extra. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even James had to stop for a moment and take it in. Penny usually wasn’t so bothered about her looks. She cared, of course, she liked looking good, but not enough to really try out a lot of makeup. She just felt more comfortable without it for her day to day life. This was the most dressed up any of them had ever seen her be. She suddenly looked so much older with her dark lipstick and bronze eyeshadow. She suddenly looked like a woman instead of just James and Simon’s best friend. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is everyone staring at?” Penny asked from the top of the stairs, as if she didn’t know. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You.” Micah told her, the others nodding in agreement. Penny made her way down the stairs with some difficulty. She clearly wasn’t used to wearing heels. “You look beautiful.” Micah gave her a quick kiss. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, handsome.” She smiled back at him. “Though, you’re not gonna say that at the end of the night when I’m biting your head off bc my feet are in pain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Penelope, do you honestly think I know you that little?” Micah joked. “I spelled your Docs smaller so they’d fit into my pocket.” He showed her the pocket in his blazer with her Doc Martens inside. “If need be, I’ll carry you back up myself. No painful feet for you tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh Merlin, I love you.” She told him. He laughed as she grabbed him by his neck to kiss him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, if we’re all ready to go, I guess we should move to the Great Hall then.” Simon proposed. Everyone agreed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You guys go ahead.” James said. “My shift isn’t until a little bit later and I’d like to avoid any awkward interactions.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sure, Jamie? We can wait a bit with you.” Penny said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James shook his head. “No really it’s okay. You guys go have fun. I’ll come find you when I get there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Penny gave him a squeezing hug. “Okay then. But seriously, come find us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Simon hugged him too, Baz threw him a two fingered salute and Micah squeezed his shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>&amp;&amp;&amp;</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Whoever was in charge of decorations, James had to applaud them. The Great Hall was unrecognisable in the best way. James was really glad he’d picked up the chaperoning shift. He wouldn’t miss this for the world. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The whole hall was decked out to look like a winter wonderland. A huge floor to ceiling tree stood tall in the far left corner, it was decorated with tinsel and candles and baubles which all seemed to have a moving family portrait painted on them. The star on top glowed and sparkled brightly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were snowflakes falling from the ceiling, but seemed to vanish a good few feet above people’s heads. The room seemed to be lit by warm yellow fairy lights that floated in place right below the clouded ceiling. The soft glow took away some of the coldness from the snowy and icy look of the decorations.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The four long tables had vanished and in their place there was a huge dancefloor. Round tables were placed at the sides of the room with neatly wrapped presents that changed colours as a centerpiece. The walls were adorned with stockings, wreaths, and tinsel to give it a homey feel. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The stage where the professors usually sat, was now used as an actual stage for a band to play on. At the moment they were playing an upbeat song that everyone was dancing to with smiles on their faces. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey there stranger!” Penny grabbed James’ hands and moved them back and forth to faux dance with him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi” James laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When did you get here?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not too long ago.” James raked his eyes over the room instead of fixing them on his friend. He was supposed to keep an eye out for the whole student body after all. “Having a good time then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah! This is great! I’ve already had to switch shoes though.” Penny dropped his hands and lifted her skirt a bit to show off the black Doc Martens on her feet. In the meantime, Micah had wrapped his arms around her from behind. She held onto them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, but I can’t stay. Still on patrol.” James said apologetically.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Penny shrugged. “I get it. Though, when you’re done being responsible, we’ll be in the common room. I managed to get a hold of something stronger than the punch they’re serving here.” Her eyes were filled with mischief. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James laughed. “Yeah, okay. Drink responsibly though. I’ve got some hangover potions, but they’re limited.” He was about to turn when he stopped. “Oh, and, the dorms should be completely empty right now.” He winked at her and pushed a small square package into her hand. “Just letting you know.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jamie! I am both shocked and grateful.” She looked down at the condom he’d given her before kissing his cheek. It read ‘NO MEANS NO’ before morphing into ‘SILENCE=/=CONSENT’.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I was only told to chaperone, I wasn’t given any detailed instructions about what that means. So, I took it upon myself to actually help instead of trying to pretend these things don’t happen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, if you’d ask me, I’d say you’re being even more responsible by promoting good sexual behaviour and teaching about consent. You’re a great chaperone.” She then plunged her hand into his pocket again and drew out a couple more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pen, Hey!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Damn, Jamie, how big are these pockets?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James shrugged. “Better too many than too few I guess. Now, get out of here.” He guided Penny back to her boyfriend. She left him with a wave as she dragged Micah by the arm and out of the Great Hall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James shook his head and went back to walking around the room. He saw Lily with Alice smiling and dancing together. He saw Albus and Scorpius shuffling next to each other and talking. He saw Teddy who saw him too and they raised their glass, James giving a nod in return. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James passed Simon and Baz who seemed to be stuck in their own bubble. He was debating whether or not to pop it when Simon decided for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey man!” Simon said. Baz wrapped an arm loosely around Simon’s waist. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey. Everything alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, everything’s great!” Simon couldn't help but look over at Baz who softened at Simon’s beaming eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, by the way before I forget to ask, do you have anywhere to be for Christmas yet?” James asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Simon shrugged, he gave a quick, nervous look to Baz. “I don’t know yet. Maybe I’ll go with Penny? But I went with her last year. I’ll probs just go back to the house. It’s only a few weeks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James put a hand on Simon’s shoulder. “Well, in any case. My dad said you’re welcome anytime.” He sounded serious enough that Simon understood he meant it, but not so serious that he brought the mood down. He waited for Simon to nod before slipping a few condoms from his pocket to Simon’s. “Be safe.” James winked and walked away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James could hear the beginning of a conversation about celebrating Christmas between Baz and Simon, but it wasn’t James’ to hear, so he walked a little quicker and looked around the room again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The upbeat songs had now dissolved into a slow, romantic music. While there was no guideline on how close couples were allowed to dance, James could still see Headmaster McGonagall look a little shook by how little distance there was. James couldn’t help but laugh at her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A familiar chuckle came from his left and James looked over to see that Teddy had quietly joined him. “Old people, right? Wizards live for ages, yet are so surprised that muggles have evolved much more.” Teddy shook their head and sipped their drink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I mean, right? How does anyone expect a progressive mentality with reactions to PDA like that?” James said. “Guess we’re even lucky to have the QSA.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy hummed in agreement. They both watched over the slow-dancing couples for a moment. “So, when do you get off?” Teddy asked too casually.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James smirked. “I thought we were on a break.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Didn’t say we weren’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy was staring at him. They were staring too hard. James could feel the eyes burning the side of his skull. Eventually he stared back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Twenty minutes.” James said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy nodded and pointedly walked out of the Great Hall. James watched them go until they were completely out of sight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He then looked back over the room. One slow quiet song had drifted into another and everyone was still stuck together, swaying from side to side. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Again he found Lily and Alice swaying with their foreheads pressed together. Again he found Scorpius and Albus off to the side, Rose was talking to them it seemed. Albus did not seem happy about that. He also found Simon and Baz dancing together, but talking quietly between them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James got more and more antsy with every passing minute. If only he could just take Teddy out to the dancefloor too and press close to them, maybe even twirl them around just because he could. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Twenty minutes, a near-miss incident of public indecency, and a confiscation of firewhiskey from some 3rd year miscreant trying to spike the punch later, James was finally relieved of his shift (the bottle of Firewhiskey tucked in his larger-spelled pockets next to the condoms).</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He spooned himself a glass of punch which he downed before bolting out of the Great Hall. The moment he walked through the doors, the loud music and buzz of a crowd washed away and filled his ears with white noise just for a moment as they adjusted. He took a deep breath and started walking. He hoped he’d understood Teddy’s message correctly.</span>
</p><p>

  </a>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy had just lowered the needle on their old-fashioned vinyl player when James opened the door. The soft, crackly jazz that filled the room made them both feel warm inside. A female voice began crooning out a slow lovesong.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>At last, my love has come along</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>James walked into the room and let his hand be taken by Teddy’s outstretched one. They pulled James closer and placed their other hand on James’ hip. James automatically brought his to Teddy’s shoulder and the couple started swaying to the music. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>My lonely days are over</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi.” Teddy whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi.” James smiled at the slight silly feeling he got. He also smiled at being so close again to his partner. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James leaned in, lost in the rhythm of the song and the magic of the moment, Teddy met his forehead and stopped there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jay, we can’t. Not yet.” Teddy told him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, Ted. It’s a few more days till we get home.” James tried.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Exactly, a few more--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, wait. Please just seize the moment now. Because once we get home, it’ll be Weasleys everywhere and family dinners and Lily and Albus and mom and dad wanting to spend quality time together and -” James sighed and squeezed Teddy’s shoulder. “I just want what little privacy we have now and enjoy it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll have that.” Teddy argued. “I still have my flat, we’ll have time there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, we won’t.” James was shaking his head and dropped his hand from Teddy’s shoulder to give himself some space. “I know you think that, and so would I, but it won’t be like we think now. It’s Christmas. You know how things get during the Christmas holidays.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But last year-” Teddy was cut off again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Last year we weren’t where we are now, because we were still figuring things out. Now we’re in an actual relationship. We need our space, not just a broom closet to make out in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy was silent, mulling over all the counterarguments James had thrown them. They huffed a laugh just once. “When did you get so goddamn mature and smart?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perks of dating someone six years older, I guess.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck, don’t say that. It still makes me feel weird.” Teddy pulled a face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, it’s only in years. We both know that deep down, you’re even more of a child then me.” James poked their belly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You do keep me young.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James was about to protest, but Teddy had leaned in and planted their lips on James’. James lifted his arms to wrap around Teddy’s neck as he deepened the kiss and sighed in contentment. James felt Teddy’s hand lower from his back to his butt and took it as a cue to jump up slightly and cling onto Teddy. He was being carried towards the desk until he could sit on it and cage Teddy with his legs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck.” Teddy breathed. “You were right, it’s been way too fucking long and why didn’t I just let you kiss me.” Teddy thought out loud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James chuckled a breathy laugh and started undoing the buttons on Teddy’s shirt. “Hold on.” James said. “Are you wearing lipstick?” James licked his own lips and smacked his mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, Thought I might try it out.” Teddy said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s… kinda hot.” James seemed surprised himself that he said that. “Do they all taste like cherries?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both James and Teddy took the smalltalk to slow down and take each other in. James was unbuttoning the rest of Teddy’s shirt as his partner was loosening James’ tie. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy smiled. “Don’t think so, but it’s a nice perk with this one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll say. You should wear it more often.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy blushed. “Good to know.” Their eyes lifted from James’ tie to his face. “Oh, crap, I got it all over you.” And started rubbing their thumb around James’ mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James grabbed their wrist. “I don’t mind.” He kissed Teddy. “In fact, pick a darker colour next time. Both you and I would look good with that.” The kiss that James gave them then was filled with absolute filthy promises.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once James had managed to leave Teddy half naked, he moved a hand to the front of his trousers and opened the zip to stick a hand in. Teddy gasped and clung to James’ shoulders. They’d only barely managed to rid James of his jacket and tie, but was paralysed by the cocky smirk James sported and the hand on his cock to do anything more about their uneven state of undress. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ohmygod Jamie, please just fuck-” Teddy felt a sense of relief, being intimate with James again. Almost too good to be true.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey Teddy, I really need to- AHHH” Albus screamed after barging into Teddy’s office and covered his eyes at the sight of James’ hand in Teddy’s pants. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck, Al. Get out!” James yelled</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus walked back out and slammed the door shut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James hung his head and retracted his hand from Teddy’s cock. “So much for privacy. Do you see now what Christmas break will be like?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy kissed him, a final time, before picking up their shirt, shooting a cleaning spell James’ way to clear off the smeared lipstick and walking towards to door. They cleared their throat and opened it to reveal a stunned and scarred Albus standing there, still covering his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Albus, did you need anything?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bleach for my eyes please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be funny.” James sounded really annoyed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not. I can never unsee that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can look now, though. No more scarring images.” Teddy said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tentatively, Albus peaked through his fingers before dropping his hands. “Oh, good. Okay, wait, when-why-you- What!?” The image only now caught up with Albus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe it’s best if you come in and sit down.” Teddy said. Albus followed the instructions on autopilot. “Love, maybe get him a glass of water?” Teddy told James who jumped off the desk and did just that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Love?” Albus asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, yeah.” Teddy sat down next to Albus on the sofa. “Your brother and I are dating. Kind of. It’s complicated right now with me being a professor. But we are and we have been for about a year now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A YEAR?” Albus accepted the glass James offered him and gulped it down. “Wow. That… actually explains a lot. You were barely home last summer.” Albus said to James. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, ‘going out with friends’, was just going out with Teddy.” James confessed, rubbing the back of his neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But, why? I mean, Teddy’s great, but, gross, they’re like our bro-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you say brother, so help me Merlin, I will cut you.” James threatened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy shot a disapproving look James’ way. “What James is trying to say, is yes, we get that it’s weird. Why do you think we haven’t told anyone? And then there’s the age difference. It’s all kinds of messed up. We know.” Teddy grabbed James’ hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But we just kind of fell in love, so none of that matters. Not really.” James finished.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus was silent for a long time. mulling over the events. He shifted in his seat then so he was seated towards the couple more. He took a breath and opened his mouth, but it took a moment for the words to come out. “How did you know?” He asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James and Teddy shared a confused look. “How did we know what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How did you know you loved each other. Or well, even liked, like, like-liked.” Albus was picking at his own fingers and his eyes darted all over the place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, well, it was scary, really scary. Especially since Ted is six years older and I was sure they would still see me as a kid or a little brother or something. But I took a chance. I thought the worst that could happen is they’d reject me and it’d be awkward for a while at family dinners, but I could live with that. I actually prepared for that because all I knew was that I just had to tell them how I felt, I had to know for sure.” James recounted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was going to reject him actually.” Teddy confessed to Albus. “I mean, he was 17, raised as my family, my best friend. I mean, Harry and Ginny are basically my parents. I once called her ‘mum’! I couldn’t just have him. It was so wrong, but when he told me how he felt, I just blanked out and kissed him. And I never looked back.” Teddy told their part and rubbed James’ knuckles with his thumb.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow, that’s, wow.” Albus sat there. “That’s not what I was expecting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What were you expecting?”James asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A little more advice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Advice?” It stayed silent after James said this. “Albus,” James had never sounded more like a big brother to Albus than now. “Do you like someone?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James thought about this more. Something about it didn’t make sense. Why go to Teddy when he could- James’ eyes widened. “Albus, is it a boy?” James asked and felt Teddy squeeze his hand and they too understood where this was going.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus nodded again and looked at them with watery eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s Scorpius isn’t it.” James didn’t even bother making it sound like a question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus let out one affirming sob before he clapped a hand over his mouth. Teddy pulled him into a hug and they felt Albus’ body shake a little. James went to sit down on the other side of his brother and put a hand on Albus’ shoulder. The three of them sat for a while until Albus had recovered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James and Teddy gave all their attention to him when they saw Albus was about to speak. Albus looked at James and said: “Is that the hand that touched Teddy’s junk?” as he pointed to the hand on his shoulder. James looked stunned for a moment and blushed before casting a cleaning spell. “Gross!” Albus whined with a smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh please!” James waved him off. Though, he was glad, at least his little brother seemed to be doing better.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They all shared a laugh and Albus wiped away the tears and sniffled. “Sorry for breaking down like that. I just, don’t know what would happen if Scorpius found out and decided he didn’t wanna be friends anymore.” Albus lowered his voice. “I have no one else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy looked over at James and the both of them knew now what heartbreak felt like. “You have us.” Teddy said. “You’ll always have us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus shrugged. “It’s not the same. Scorpius is my best friend. He’s my only friend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If he really is your best friend, he’ll stay, even if he doesn’t feel the same which, honestly, Al, I blame dad for your obliviousness. Scorpius would face a thousand Unforgivables for you. The way he looks at you makes me wanna vomit sometimes. And I’m not even paying that much attention to you two.” James threw his hands up. He felt sorry for Albus and his stupid Harry-genes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You remember in class last week,” Teddy chimed in, “And he asked you to help him with the spell we were practising?” Teddy waited for Albus to nod. “That was flirting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus shook his head. “No, it wasn’t. He needed help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James’ face turned deadpan. “Al, that boy is the smartest guy in this whole school. He didn’t need help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sometimes, he does. He asks me for help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah! Because he’s trying to flirt, you idiot. I saw him do the spell perfectly when you were still reading the textbook.” Teddy said. “He was definitely flirting. Merlin, you’re hopeless.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He really is.” A voice said from the open doorway. All three of them turned towards it to see Scorpius standing there. His hands in his pockets, his tie loose around his neck, and the sleeves of both his shirt and jacket pushed up his arms. “You left the map open on your bed.” Scorpius explained how he’d found him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were flirting with me?” Albus asked incredulously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have been for half a year, but thanks for noticing.” He huffed a laugh and bounced on his feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy gestured silently to James for them to leave the room. James nodded and got up, but didn’t leave without patting both his brother and Scorpius on the shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once outside, Teddy wanted to walk down the stairs, they could wait in the classroom for the boys to finish their talk. But Teddy felt their hand being tugged at and turned to see the excited, boy-ish look on James’ face as he jerked his head towards the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy shook their head, now was not the time for spying, but then James started pouting and they couldn’t resist, so they both watched as Albus and Scorpius talked in low voices to each other through the gap of the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why didn’t you say anything?” Albus stood, still fumbling with his hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why didn’t you?” Scorpius shot back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was scared of losing you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you think I was, too? I mean, I try to flirt and it didn't’ seem to have any effect, but then you glared at everyone who even came close to asking me out, or me asking them out. I was getting real mixed signals here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry. My brother tells me that’s my dad’s fault.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Scorpius laughed. “Actually, my dad has said similar things about yours. Something like ‘couldn’t even tell love from hate’, he’s told me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can we try again?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, but we can move forward.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow, that was some deep shit right there, Scorp.” Albus laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey! I’m smart, I’ll have you know. I can be deep and wise when- what are you doing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James could see Albus had moved closer, a lot closer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I kiss you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Scorpius nodded and smiled before he pressed his lips against Albus’.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James and Teddy moved away from the door to hug each other in silent victory, not wanting to give away their position, but the both of them oh so happy for the two boys.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&amp;&amp;&amp;</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The following morning brought Albus and Scorpius entering the Great Hall hand in hand as they walked towards the Slytherin table. They were both smiling softly. James looked over to Teddy at the front of the room and caught their eye. The look they shared said everything, relief, happiness, pride, over Albus and Scorpius finally getting their heads out of their arses. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James looked over to the Ravenclaw table where he found Lily and Alice glancing over at the Slytherin table before Lily turned her head to James and gestured excitedly. James raised his cup of coffee in response. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Today they’d all be going back to London to go home for the break. James couldn’t wait. Christmas break meant his own room, more privacy, more freedom, but most of all it meant Teddy. James touched the galleon underneath his shirt, as he always did, and knew the days were set to zero now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After breakfast, the whole school filed out of the Hall with cheerful buzz, happy to see their family again soon. James, though, saw Simon with a less happy expression shuffle behind him and Penny. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You okay, Si?” James asked, slowing his pace to walk along his friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, fine.” Simon shrugged. James gave him a disbelieving side-eye. Simon sighed. “Guess, I’m just nervous about spending Christmas at Baz’. He’s not had the best run with his parents.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can get that. My parents still have no idea about me being gay. I have no idea how they’ll react, you know. And his coming from a long line of purebloods, must be a lot of pressure.” James grabbed and squeezed Simon’s wrist for a moment. “But know you’re welcome at mine if you do need a place in a pinch, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, I really appreciate that man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James bumped their shoulders together. “Of course! Now let’s go pack.”</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>A little before lunchtime, everyone, save the few who stayed at Hogwarts, was sat on the train and was ready to go back to London. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James, Simon, Penny, Micah and now Baz with his friends, Dev and Niall, had found themselves an empty compartment to settle in. It was crowded, both literally and figuratively. Their usual dynamic was put off with all these new people, but they were all adjusting. Penny and Baz got along great when they weren’t competing for being at the top of the class. Dev and Niall were teaching Micah how to play magical Uno. Simon and James were busy trying to throw jelly beans into each other’s mouths (extra point were given when it was a nice flavour). </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was chaotic and loud and a little confusing since they were all still adjusting to each other, but at least they were adjusting. There seemed to be an undercurrent of relief in their easy conversations. The train ride would fly by in no time like this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were an hour into the ride before the compartment door opened and Albus was stood there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“James.” He simply said and jerked his head to tell him to follow, so James did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus walked in silence, James following him in confusion. The soft contentedness that was there at breakfast this morning has dissolved completely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is everything okay?” James asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did something happen with Scorpius already? Because if it did I-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re fine.” Albus had lead him to the bathroom, where Lily seemed to be waiting already.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Al, what is this about.” Lily asked in anger, she’s probably been left here to wait with no explanation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not ready for mum and dad to know.” He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily and James looked at each other, baffled. “Know what?” James said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About me and Scorp!” Albus near-yelled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“OH! Okay, yeah of course not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good, I just wanted to make that clear.” Albus breathed in and out deeply. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James grabbed his little brother and ruffled his hair. “Merlin, you’re always so goddamn serious about things. Lighten up. You couldn’t have just texted me that? I do still carry the phone mum and dad got us, you gloomy git.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I… didn’t think of that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But now that we’re here.” He glanced over at Lily, who had no idea about James and Teddy. He’d need to be careful with his words. “You can promise me the same right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus nodded and stuck out his hand. “Deal.” James took the hand and shook it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait, what d’you mean?” Lily asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry about it.”James said, he made to walk back out the bathroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is this about you and Teddy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James stopped short and turned back around. “No, what, why? How- how do you know about that.” He deflated a little.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily shrugged. “I notice things. Unlike some people.” Lily shrugged, making a dig at Albus. “Also, you really should be careful at those QSA meetings. You’re not as subtle as you think.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll keep that in mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now,” Lily began, “If we’re all agreed, no one breathes a word to mum and dad about any of our relationships until we’re ready to come out ourselves. Okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay!” Albus and James echoed. Lily held out her pinky. “Do we have to?” Albus whined, but quickly hooked his pinky into hers at the glare she threw him. James did the same and sealed the deal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Great. See you in London.” Lily dashed out the room back to her friends.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus strolled off too without another word, but the tension in his shoulders was gone and his step was just a tad lighter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James was the last to leave, but not before he’d dug out the galleon around his neck and saw the number set on zero, but around the edge it read ‘Today is going to be a good day’. It made James smile, Teddy always did like a hopeful musical reference.</span>
