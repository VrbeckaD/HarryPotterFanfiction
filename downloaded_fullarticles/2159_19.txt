    <p>Last night must have been quite the bender; Draco didn’t even know where he was. He peered around the rather garish bedroom from the safety of his covers. It looked as though no one else was there, plus he had all his clothes on which, seeing as Draco would never have a go at someone who thought that cutlery made for a sufficient wall decoration, was for the best.</p><p>Draco suddenly became conscious of the fact that he was queasy, and subsequently, ran to the ensuite bathroom to expel the contents of last night’s foray. He slouched over the sink to wash his mouth when he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. His bottom lip and left eye were bruised, and he had a bandage on his nose.</p><p><em>Who could it have been this time? Ex Death Eaters? Potter supporters? Potter himself?</em> It seemed that breathing was the only qualification needed to spite Draco. He went about prodding his bruises and proceeded to delicately remove the bandage from his nose, revealing a rather nasty cut.</p><p>That’s when he noticed, a top the bathroom counter, a green potion. Draco carefully inspected the bottle; he didn’t trust it. Instead, he opted to read the note next to the suspicious substance.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Dear Draco,</em>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <em>Drink the potion, it’s not poison. When you’re ready, come down for breakfast.</em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em>-Theodore</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>He was at Nott’s house? He must be dreaming; either that or he’s gone mad since he hasn’t spoken to him since the end of fifth year when Nott left Hogwarts.</p><p>What could it all mean? Was Nott the one who beat him in his drunken stupor, and, in a moment of pity, took him back to his house? Or, did Draco throw himself at Nott, who accepted Draco’s advances, obviously, but then things got a little freaky and Draco passed out? Or, the most plausible scenario, he wasn’t at Nott’s house at all! It was just an elaborate ruse to lower his guard so someone could pull a fast one on him… But, then why not have at him when he was stupid drunk?</p><p>All this thinking had Draco’s head throbbing; the unidentified potion grew more alluring by the minute. Well, if Draco was going to die; it might as well be in a stranger’s bathroom.</p><p>He proceeded to uncork the bottle. No particular odor hit his nose, and the consistency was slightly thick: Wiggenweld. He swallowed the entirety of the potion in one go. His bruises healed, and his cut haphazardly followed suit. He was also alleviated of his haziness. If his unknown benefactor was Nott, at least he knew how to cure a hangover.</p><p>Draco went back into the bedroom, finding his shoes next to the bed, his cloak draped in a chair, and his wand on the nightstand. Everything was just bizarre: the potion, the note, the unnecessary underlying kindness. Could Nott really be the one who did all this? For someone he hasn’t seen or spoken to in years? It seemed impossible. And that was why he wouldn’t stick around to find out who the real mastermind was.</p><p>Gathering his things and doing a once over in the mirror, Draco prepared himself to apparate. Inhaling through his nose, he pictured the place he’d like to go to.</p><p><em>Is that bacon?</em> His stomach growled. <em>Well, I suppose meeting this mastermind could be potentially entertaining, and it would be rude to suddenly leave without giving my thanks.</em></p><p>Draco stuck his head out the door and peered into the hallway,<em> the coast’s clear</em>. Stepping outside his room, he was simultaneously complimented and insulted by the many familial portraits lining the walls; he was definitely in a pureblood’s house. Maybe it was Nott after all.</p><p>Eager to leave the portraits to chat amongst themselves, he careened down the stairs following the scent of bacon.</p><p>“Oh Draco!” came a voice way too cheery for this situation. “You finally decided to show yourself.” It really was Nott.</p><p>“Yes, well, if I hadn’t been taken to a certain someone’s house then I wouldn’t need to ‘show’ myself to anyone.”</p><p>“You never change, do you?”</p><p>Draco paused, glancing at the array of delectable food laid out on the table before him.</p><p>“You know, it’s not just for looking at,” smirked Nott. Draco glared at him. “Take a seat, dig in.” Nott sat down and started to fill his plate with pancakes, eggs, and bacon.</p><p>“You know, it’s rude for a host to sit before his guest.”</p><p>“Draco, just sit down and eat some food.” Draco stood with a haughty disdain until he eventually succumbed to his hunger. “I knew you’d come around.”</p><p>“Ugh, you better not make me regret this, Nott.”</p><p>“Wasn’t planning on it, and you can call me Theo.”</p><p>Draco almost choked on his precious bacon, “Excuse me?”</p><p>“I know we haven’t seen each other in quite a while, but we were friends at Hogwarts.”</p><p>Draco was momentarily shocked, “We didn’t fuck, did we?”</p><p>Nott looked just as confused as Draco, “No, why would you think that?”</p><p>Draco was indignant, “Oh, I don’t know. Maybe it was that note you left me or that you tucked me into bed, or even, I might be reaching here, the pile of breakfast food that couldn’t possibly be eaten on your lonesome, and the fact that you just told me to call you by your first name despite the fact that we haven’t seen each other in years.”</p><p>Nott calmly watched Draco’s tirade, and how Draco took another slice of bacon when he was done. “Well, say something,” Draco sneered.</p><p>“Draco, I’m married,” Draco looked like he was about to protest to such an affront, “And that’s not the issue here. What do you remember from last night?”</p><p>It was clearly a diversion from Draco’s main question, but he hadn’t really thought about it, too busy focusing on matters of more significance. “I went to the Leaky Cauldron to get wasted, and some guy was yelling at me, and I don’t really remember anything after that…”</p><p>“You were in an ally when I found you, beaten pretty badly from what I could tell, and so I—”</p><p>“Why were you in an ally?”</p><p>“Because I saw a person lying on the ground?”</p><p>“That doesn’t seem like you, to be…helpful. What seedy business dealing did you have going on?”</p><p>“Draco, have you ever known me to be in any shady ‘dealings’?”</p><p>“Well, you never really talked much at school!” He exclaimed, bacon in hand.</p><p>“Can I get back to my story now?”</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes, “Be it me to interrupt the great Nott.”</p><p>“It’s Theo.” Draco groaned. “Anyway, I realized that it was you in the ally, and since there was no one with you, and you were unconscious, I thought it’d be fine to take you to my place.”</p><p>“Nott, what do you really want?”</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re—”</p><p>“If your story’s true, you could have alerted my parents, I’m sure they’d be delighted to talk to you—”</p><p>“It was too late at night, I didn’t want to impose.”</p><p>“Or sent me to a hotel room under my name, or to St. Mungo’s, but what you didn’t have to do is take me back to your house," Draco hissed.</p><p>“Is it so hard to believe that I care about an old friend?" Nott sickeningly batted his eyelashes.</p><p>Draco became pensive, “I don’t know. But what I do know is that you’re plotting!”</p><p>“Well, I was going to offer you something.”</p><p>“Ah-ha, I knew it!” Draco accusingly pointed his bacon at Nott , "Quid pro quo," and then continued to be smug.</p><p>Nott sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose and closing his eyes, “It was going to be free, but I forgot what a pain you are.”</p><p>“I seriously doubt that anything you offer could possibly be of interest to me.”</p><p>“What about a second chance?” Nott gazed at him with quasi-hope.</p><p>“You mean redemption,” Draco deadpanned, putting down his bacon. “I’ve done some unforgiveable things, Theo; things that I can’t forgive myself for. So, tell me, what good is the forgiveness of others?”</p><p>Theo looked saddened, “I’m terribly sorry.”</p><p>“It wasn’t your fault," Draco humbly chewed on some bacon.</p><p>“But I feel like it is, I could have stopped you.”</p><p>“Really, Theo? You have as bad a martyr complex as Potter, and all of those…things, they were my choices. I have to live with the fact that I made the wrong ones.”</p><p>“You don’t understand Draco, I went back in time.”</p><p>“You mean like a Time Turner?”</p><p>“Yes and no.”</p><p>“Okay, and? It’s not like you could have done much."</p><p>“I relived seven years of my life.”</p><p>Draco was silent, what more could he say to that? It defied all known laws of magic and sounded utterly bovine.</p><p>“I know, it sounds crazy, but it’s true. I—"</p><p>“It’s impossible," Draco licked his salty fingers.</p><p>“But it’s not,” Theo extracted a small book from his pocket. “Read it.”</p><p>Draco took the book into his hand, “Theo, I don’t want your diary.”</p><p>“It’s not my diary, it’s more like a chronology of events to come.”</p><p>Draco started to flip through the book.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">
    <em>June 24<sup>th</sup>, 1995- Voldemort comes back</em>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <em>June 18<sup>th</sup>, 1996- Department of Mysteries, father arrested</em>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <em>June 30<sup>th</sup>, 1997- Dumbledore killed by professor Snape</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p align="center"> </p><p>“All of this already happened,” Draco gave Theo an irritated grimace, “except that your dad wasn’t even at the department that night.”</p><p>“Flip to the back page.”</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">
    <em>June 5<sup>th</sup>, 2001- Draco Malfoy dies in ally by Leaky Cauldron</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p align="center"> </p><p>“Do you think this is funny?!” Draco glowers at Theo, half hoping he didn’t have an answer.</p><p>“Draco, I haven’t been back to England in years; I came back to make sure you didn’t die.”</p><p>“How very kind of you,” he stood up. “Well, Nott, as much as this has been a pleasure, I’ll be taking my leave.”</p><p>“Wait!” Theo grabbed his arm, “I’m trying to help you here!”</p><p>“By being my savior? I give you my full gratitude, Nott,” Draco spit.</p><p>“Draco, please, just hear me out,” Theo looked haggard.</p><p>Well, it’s not as if he had much else to do today. Draco tapped his foot, “You have five minutes.”</p><p>Theo gave him a small smile, “Thank you.” Draco sighed and sat back down to his plate of bacon.</p><p>“It’s a little convoluted, so stop me if you’re confused.” Theo looked at Draco who gave him a grudging nod. “Okay, where to start? Oh! So that part you read where my father was arrested, that was in my original timeline.”</p><p>“Original timeline?”</p><p>“Yes, in the original timeline, my father rejoined the Death-Eaters, and was arrested at the Department of Mysteries. I was a Death-Eater too, and well, in this timeline as you know, I’m not.”</p><p>“Is that why you went back? To stop your father from being arrested and yourself from becoming a Death-Eater?” Draco supposed he could understand that logic if he was going to play Theo's game.</p><p>“That and other reasons,” Theo fondly smiled at his wedding band.</p><p>“Wait, if this is all true, hypothetically speaking, aren’t you,” Draco did some inner calculations, “…twenty-eight years old?”</p><p>“Both yes and no.” Draco loudly exhaled in an obnoxious fashion. “But you’re getting ahead of me here.” Draco gave a wave of his hand that said continue, please. “Resuming my story, in the original timeline, my other self came across a rare magical artifact.”</p><p>“Uh-huh.” Draco put his feet on the table.</p><p>“And it sent me back in time seven years.”</p><p>“Yeah," draco lulled his head back.</p><p>“Can you stop doing that?”</p><p>Draco inspected his nails, “Sure.”</p><p>Theo sighed, “And it put the me from the original timeline into the me of this timeline.”</p><p>Draco reflected, “So, you’re a twenty-eight-year-old with the body of a twenty-one-year-old.”</p><p>“Close, but we haven’t gotten there yet.” Draco couldn’t believe that he was falling for Theo’s shite. “When I first got there, I noticed that whenever I made a small change in this timeline that diverged from the original timeline, I would forget what happened in the original timeline. That’s why I made this book,” he patted the small book that had been left on the table, “So that I wouldn’t forget what happened.”</p><p>“Wait, is that why you beat me as top student fourth and fifth year? Because you were really twenty-eight-years-old the whole time?” Draco was both pleasantly suprised by Theo's ingenuity and righteously indignant of this gross perversion of education.</p><p>“You and Granger, and yes, but I was twenty-one when I went back in time.”</p><p>“Wait, and because you changed things from your first life, you forgot them? So, it’s like you really are twenty-one again?!”</p><p>“That’s the gist of it.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Why did you save me if you knew I was going to die?”</p><p>“If you were important enough for me to put you in the book, then you're important enough to be saved.”</p><p>“I’m glad that the majority of your life has been dictated by a book.” Theo shrugged. “Why, exactly, did you tell me all of this?”</p><p>“Well, you were going to die today, and you seemed like the type who’d take up my offer.”</p><p>“You want me to go back in time?” Draco glumly surmised.</p><p>“Only if you want too," Theo fidgeted a bit, and then started tapping the pad of his fingers together.</p><p>Did Draco have a reason to say no? It was the deal of a lifetime from what Theo was saying, and it’s not like he was particularly attached to anything right now. Who knows, if he goes back to change his past, he’d probably be able to beat Granger for first place and Potter in all of those Quidditch matches. It was too good to pass up.</p><p>“I’ll do it.”</p><p>Theo was genuinely surprised, “That’s was quick.”</p><p>“Though I still have a lot of questions.”</p><p>“Naturally.”</p><p>“Since you went back in time, why didn’t you try to stop the Second Wizarding War?”</p><p>“I knew that Potter and his side would tie everything up in a neat bow, I just wanted to save those close to me, then get out of dodge.”</p><p>“Then why not save me?”</p><p>“As much as it hurts to say Draco, I knew that you’d be okay in the end.”</p><p>“I wasn’t fine sixth year!” Draco threw up his hands.</p><p>“I know, and I’m sorry, but I couldn’t save everyone! I didn’t know what was going to happen because I diverged so much from my original time. You-Know-Who could have killed my father for not joining him; he could have killed me, my family, and all of my loved ones.”</p><p>At least Theo looked descently dejected, “Hmm…Fine, next question,” he pondered for a bit, “What happened to the you from the original timeline?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I could have died, disappeared, been entirely erased from history, or gone on living in that timeline, never knowing that my conscience split into two exact copies. That timeline might not exist anymore. Time travel is a finnicky thing.”</p><p>“Sounds…terrifying, destroying entire timelines, and if I do the same, then you’ll disappear in this timeline," Draco shuddered.</p><p>“It’s plausible, but I believe that there are an infinite number of timelines going on at any given moment with every infinite possibility taking place simultaneously and splitting into more timelines. Who knows how many times we’ve had this conversation before and all the outcomes that followed? There may even be a Draco in another timeline who’s rewriting his past in this very moment.”</p><p>“What, exactly, is it that you do for a living?”</p><p>“I work as a researcher on time anomalies and other associated time issues for the International Wizarding Research Organization.”</p><p>“You sure do like to use the word ‘time’ a lot.”</p><p>“It’s a part of the job.”</p><p>“What about the you in the timeline I create?”</p><p>“What about him?”</p><p>“Well, don’t you care about what happens to him?”</p><p>“Not particularly. It’s your timeline, Draco. You can do whatever you want with him. Just know that you can’t fix everything, and you can’t save everyone. That’s a burden I had to accept because, the thing is Draco, we grew up in a dark time, and it could only ever end in two ways.”</p><p>That was a lot to take in. It seemed like too much, like you had to tread a careful line so that you didn’t mess everything up. One wrong move and the entirety of Wizarding Britain would be under the thumb of You-Know-Who.</p><p>“Now, I presume that you fully intend on going through with this whole ordeal,” Nott produced a silver Time Turner with a metallic red liquid inside, “So I will proceed with informing you on <u>The Time-Traveler’s Guide to Not Fucking Up the Space-Time Continuum</u> By Theodore Nott.”</p><p>“Sounds formal,” Draco said as Theo baited him by holding the Time Turner just above his outstretched palm.</p><p>“Rule one: It’s probably a bad idea to mention that you’re a time traveler from the future because they will use you as a tool of mass destruction, or subject you to terrifying experiments.”</p><p>“I’m quacking in my boots.”</p><p>“As you should. Rule two: Write stuff down that you remember from the ‘future’ so that you can use it to your advantage, and make sure your future journal is protected at all costs, no one can ever see it, lest they use it for their own nefarious purposes.”</p><p>“Be paranoid, got it.”</p><p>“And Rule three: Rule one &amp; two can be null and void if prevailing circumstances force you to break the Time-Traveler's code of honor.”</p><p>“What does that even mean?”</p><p>“Well, say you’re in a situation like this one, then you can tell people you’re a time-traveler. Or just whoever you trust enough because they start growing suspicious of the fact that you somehow have knowledge of events prior to their happening when you have no logical explanation for why you knew it was going to happen in the first place.”</p><p>“Personal problem?”</p><p>“Yeah, it sometimes happens. Have you thought of when you want to go back to? Because this thing goes by increments of one year.”</p><p>“Huh…I suppose I’ll have to go back to first year because I’m pretty sure Father came in contact with the incorporeal You-Know-Who at the end of first year.”</p><p>“A decade is a lot? Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Are you Ready?” Theo placed the Time Turner over Draco’s neck.</p><p>“What! Now?”</p><p>“Draco, what are you waiting for? You could go back now or in three days; it won’t make a difference.”</p><p>“But I didn’t think I’d have to do this now! I haven't said my farewells.”</p><p>“You’ll see them again, you big cry-baby,” Theo took the Turner, placing it around Draco's neck, and began to spin.</p><p>One… Two… A light breeze wafted in Draco’s face.</p><p>“Wait, I should study this timeline so I’m better prepared.”</p><p>“Draco, you're prepared as you’ll ever be”</p><p>Five…Six… A vortex of wind started to surround Draco, an ominous tiding.</p><p>“You’re just a prick, and I hate you," Draco helplessly watched Theo's deft fingers.</p><p>“I’m flattered.”</p><p>Eight…Nine… The wind was turning violent, throwing napkins and papers alike into disarray.</p><p>“Wait! I don’t want to go back. Stop! Just stop!” Draco latched onto Theo’s arms, panic filled his eyes and shook his every bone.</p><p>“Have a nice trip Draco!”</p><p>Ten… The house was shaking with the force of the wind. The lights flickered off and…</p><p>Poof</p><p>There was an explosion of glittering red dust, and then Draco was gone. Also, the lights came back on.</p><p>“So that’s what happens… This is going to take a while to clean-up.”</p>
