    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Children with hearts of gold, once rulers, blessed by the Lion and his Light. In retrospect, their destiny should have been linear, traced in their palms as they held bows and swords, marching to a war without an ending. Instead, they betrayed their guide, at once. Together, forming a unit made of broken pieces, glued together by the memory of having been, once upon a time, a family more than deities meant to be worshiped.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The First letter arrives on a Tuesday. The weather could be better, heavy clouds dissuading them to leave the flat. Some would say it's a miracle they got such place (barely big enough for three, certainly not enough for four) without support. They rely on each other (sometimes), mostly at nights. They take out board games, facing siblings as if they were playing a game or life and death. With more tea and hot chocolate, and a couple of biscuits. Store-bought, usually. The supermarket is a tougher opponent than most, blinding lights and colorful packaging lurking them into the abyss.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I wonder,” Susan whispers, letter in one hand, mug in the other, “what fate wants to do with our dear Peter this time around.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Dear, they use the term to convey a myriad of emotions. The strength of bonds, or royalty. Or the disdain of affection turned odd and ancient. What's a new start, when you are slowly losing everything you had? Ah, there is disgust towards Aslan's punishment.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>You do not take away memories! Bloody hell, you do not send children back into another time—and you are definitely not allowed—no one is—to let them read everyone they ever loved died tragically in a train accident everyone has long forgotten about.</em>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Nothing I fancy to read about, Su',” he still takes the letter, opening it with a pocket knife he shouldn't carry around. Assassinations were too common at some point. A shame it's starting to be fuzzy to remember when and how.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">As Peter starts to unfolds the paper, the remaining members of the household are attracted by the sudden silence. One after another, they gravitate around the shitty couch covered in stains which won't go away.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Susan is disappointed that's not blood.</p>
<p align="justify">At least, she knows how to remove such thing.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Sitting on the edge of the sofa, mug steadily held in both hands, she awaits for an explanation. Oh, it couldn't be bills to pay. They have done too much around, no matter how young they are. Neighbors lower their heads as they walk by, having vowed silence to protect the four orphans who live in the building. The ones who are so mature, carrying groceries with the same ease as they stop fights, stepping between fools without ever lowering their gaze. They are special, people whisper. And it's enough for them to accept they do not seek help at all. Adults play the parents when they pay them, avoiding social workers or anyone who could recognize them as more than ethereal guardians.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Too special, perhaps.</p>
<p align="justify">On the verge of being <em>magical</em>.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Peter is thirteen and Edmund climbs on the back of the couch, almost kicking him in the shoulder, Lucy clapping her hands in joy by his side. Susan sighs at the news, her eyes having already skimmed through most of the letter.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“They are apologizing before even saying why they are doing first, how bold,” his younger brother mocks.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Let me read, I am not as fast as you guys are,” Peter remind his siblings, gaze struggling to accept some of the words. He has little affection towards people writing with ink on parchment, finding the calligraphy hideous at best and non-readable at worst.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Hogwarts, he finally understands. That might explains some things, such as the residues of magic clinging to them since they returned. Or landed there. It's hard to tell. Sometimes, he feels at a loss around emails and supermarkets. At least people gained some basic human rights they should have from the start, he guesses. Peter wouldn't claim to be nostalgic of his era. He misses parents and classmates, playing in the garden and bickering with the others. The war and everything else? Not so much.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">As he turns the letter around, catching a glimpse of the remaining lines, Peter wants to burn it to ashes. That would be more convenient, honestly.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“They apparently missed my existence.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Brilliant, I envy them. We were not given the same chance.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Edmund, kindly shut up and let our dear brother proceeds this.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“As you wish, Su'.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">There must have been a mistake, the paper states, as new students are supposed to get their letter of acceptance at eleven. Peter is aware they only arrived in this time six months ago, therefore, it's no surprise they did not exist before. He is more surprised some magical school heard about their existence. The idea of fighting—wizards?--sounds tedious for a Tuesday.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I have enough with one witch around,” he mutters, not wishing to follow the same path. Ice cold fingers press against the back of his neck, as a warning. One which makes him elbow Edmund in—whatever part he manages to reach. “Ed', no offense, but I'm not certain they are talking about your kind of magic.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I would love to ask my <em>Mother,</em> if we had not gotten rid of her, twice.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The clear (terrifying) separation between him and them is always a difficult topic. One which is easily avoided as Lucy comments about wizards coming to visit them since they are children of non-magical parents.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Before their beloved brother can whine about not feeling included in this, Peter is quick to scan the room. They have to clean if they welcome guests. And buy more biscuits probably. Neighbors didn't appreciate them trying to catch pigeons with a bow and arrows last month, therefore they should buy a chicken or something. How does one host a dinner party for wizards? As the high king, Peter has never—oh he might have been in such situation before. A shame he forgot about it already.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Hm,” Susan pries the letter off his hands, a frown forming on her face, “if this letter is more than a prank, what I wholeheartedly believe in, this is too elaborate, where is mine? I turned twelve one month earlier.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Silence befalls them at once, no one having the answer.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“We can ask them when they come for Peter.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Lucy makes the meeting sounds like some sort of threat, a peace treaty meant to go wrong.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally something they can agree on.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     It turns out, Squibs are not invited to Hogwarts. Susan regrets not adding poison to the tea. Her collection is meager, that's true, although she is slowly building it with care. Oh, sometimes the best way to avoid being assassinated by your rival is to take care of the problem yourself. She watches these strangers in their long robes sitting on their couch with little care. They have no parents to play pretend today, which is fine as their cover story is that their grandmother is raising them. She's busy however, away at her cooking class for the elderly. No one questions why four children are not at school, leading her to believe wizards have no concept of what life is meant to be like for a Muggle Or whatever they call people who are not like them.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Lucy is the one asking questions, bubbly voice hiding a sharp intellect and a habit of pretending to be an innocent child. By all means, she is kind, their sister, heart filled with joy and a curiosity difficult to match. Innocent though? Not in the slightest. Once, they reached adulthood. And then everything was stripped away from them. Not very convenient, to say the least.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Susan has magic in her blood, right? So what is stopping her from joining?” Lucy has this talent at making people squirm when they do not offer what she wants to hear. Her smile is almost too perfect while she is sitting between the wizards, holding her mug of hot chocolate with care. Little marshmallows are slowly drowning one after another, and she couldn't care less.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I was also wondering why your curriculum is so averse to me,” she adds. For what she understands, there is gardening and potions, things she shouldn't struggle with more than anyone else.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">They pursue their lips together, uninvited guests who thought this would be easy. They are sitting close to four monarchs, they should have planned this better. Not that she can blame them for not knowing. Susan has no intention to reveal who she is (or was). She's the one whose memories go away the fastest, leaving blanks she fills with whatever she finds. Who cares about being a queen in a world where they played pretend? She'd rather rules there, over something real.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“It's not that Squibs are not welcome—”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Edmund snorts.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“They are not fit for the magical world, and we want no harm to come to them. We suggest Miss Pevensie to pursue her life as a Muggle, for her own safety.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Are you threatening me?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Susan watches them turn pale at once, sipping her tea with a polite smile. They have no idea of what they set in motion, how unfortunate.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Peter goes to Hogwarts. Alone, with the daunting task of researching as much as he can on the judicial system these people use.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">On his first night, he ends up in the headmistress's office, an old woman who seems already exhausted by his existence. They can certainly agree on that, he muses for himself, sitting in front of her. There is an argument, or rather a conversation he struggles to keep with as the train ride lasted for hours.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">He isn't fond of trains any longer. Not when they took him to Paradise and then back more than once. Still, he sits straight on his chair, hands folded in his lap as he awaits for an arrangement to be made. At thirteen, one shouldn't expect to win against the school, especially not as ancient as this one. Peter Pevensie isn't exactly an average kid though.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I cannot allow you to roam around the castle without belonging to a house.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I refuse to be sorted until my sister is allowed to study there.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Two hours later, Peter spends his first night at the infirmary, in a bed separated from the others by only an ugly white curtain.</p>
<p align="justify">That's the only place where she accepted to put him for now, certain he'll change his mind before the end of the first week.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">      “Pevensie, what are we doing to do with you?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><em>Wait until you meet my siblings before saying that</em>, he wants to suggest. He is always in the library, colorless uniform catching the attention of kids who whisper behind his back. He gets into a fight on the second week, grabbing a rusty sword off an armor as the student takes out his wand. There is a silence, a moment where the other doesn't get it (which kind of wizard doesn't raise their wand at the first threat). In a swift move, Peter disarms his classmates before putting the sword back, mumbling about boys not having any fighting skills.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Oddly, he doesn't get send to the headmistress's office for that. As dueling on school grounds without permission is apparently forbidden, therefore the bully doesn't dare to complain.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Later, as he is skimming through endless books whose lines are dancing in front of his eyes, letters treacherous, Peter hears the librarian lamenting over his attitude. Not studying for his classes, nor using his wand when he needs to. He'd rather carry matches to light candles rather than casting a simple spell, much to his teacher's chagrin.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Children like you, whose parents aren't magical, struggle to adapt sometimes,” she tells him once the library is closed and he is packing to return to the infirmary.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I'm not struggling, it's you who don't get it,” he replies, voice low so she cannot hear. He promises to be there tomorrow, although he isn't certain of finding a solution for Susan as fast as they planned.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">    Oldest in this year, Peter avoids problems by vanishing when he is not needed. Two months after joining the school, he already has a reputation. His magical abilities have increased as he started to care about his studies. Unlike what his teachers mumbled about him at first, he is quite diligent. Always ahead, fascinated by history. A shame he has to offer so many unwanted lines in his papers. Better approaches to wars, bitter comments about never avoiding casualties and rulers pretending otherwise being morons. His wand is long and precise, although rarely seen outside of class. He practices theory instead, sometimes putting headphones over his ears although no sound will come out at Hogwarts.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I don't like noise, or rather to be drowned in it. Especially when I'm trying to read,” he explains to a teacher one evening, after being called out for wearing them in class.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Getting detention for being insolent is insulting, although he doesn't complain.</p>
<p align="justify">He awaits his weekly meeting with the headmistress for that.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">McGonadall is not fond of him, he supposes. Or he is slowly worming his way into her heart as new problematic student. Peter isn't certain.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“May I inquire why you insist on complicating your own existence?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“You may. Although I doubt you'll appreciate the answer.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Aslan is faint by now, a dream of a dream, tucked in a corner of his mind covered in fog. He is merely the orphan, the one with three younger siblings raised without support. Magic must allow the headmistress to know that. After all, meddling, for what he read in history textbooks, is common place between wizards. As long as she doesn't mention it, neither will he.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“You have this arrogance to you, Pevensie, and still no house. I thought you would relent by being isolated and yet it's merely as if your classmates exist at all in your world.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Next year, if Susan joins, I'll go in the house I'm meant to belong to.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The conversation ends in another detention.</p>
<p align="justify">For once though, it's in the library. Something about sorting political books in the right order.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Peter thanks her, palm pressed against his heart.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     The young king once sat at the most fantastic banquets, lacing his tongue with praise and stories to win his enemies over. He barely recalls these moments, although it was certainly less oppressive than eating alone in the infirmary. The nurse is sympathetic to his presence, especially as he serves as an assistant in the evening, cleaning shelves to show he is grateful to have a place to be. He is certain she pities his spirit, the way he refuses to be tamed by the school.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">One evening, he steps outside of his kingdom to enter the Great Hall. Whispers start at once, as he sits at the closest table. Green and mighty, these ones. Rejected too, stigmas of war they didn't participate in weighting heavily on their shoulders. He is aware of their piercing gazes, how they want him to be gone right away.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Is there something on my face,” he asks, ignoring the way a girl's face becomes so red with fury she might choke on air, “I've been wondering about something I've read regarding a law, do you happen to have a lawyer in your family?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Opening the book he was carrying on the table, he lets them glance at the page, serving himself with mashed potatoes to the point he might regret it later. He has time though, pressing his fork against his lips more than once before a girl with dark skin and sharp eyes gestures for the boy by his side to move.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Jones, fourth year. My parents are both working for the ministry of magic. I've been more familiar with politics and laws than toys since the tender age of five.” Her voice is acidic, meaning she'll want to be paid for his work, which Peter finds fair.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Then I humbly request your services.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">      Before December, Peter has send one hundred letters to the ministry, and various groups working on the acceptance of Squibs.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">It doesn't work.</p>
<p align="justify">So he breaks quills by pressing them too hard against parchment, wondering what would be the point in returning the following year if he loses.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Susan has nothing to be punished for, not in this life or the previous ones.</p>
<p align="justify">Aslan can go fuck himself, for all he cares.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Immediately after having this though, Peter covers his face with his hands, inhaling sharply. Nothing makes sense, he loathes being on his own without his siblings. He dreads the days until Winter break, climbing first abroad the train and blasting his music in his headphones as soon as they are away from this damned school.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Lucy jumps forward, awaiting on the platform alongside the others. He wraps his arms around his beloved little sister, squeezing until she starts to complain. By Aslan, he missed them so much, it's unbearable.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Once they are back in their tiny flat, he almost starts tearing up at the new curtains they added in the kitchen. Obtaining this place was—too easy. Even with their skills as ex-monarchs, he is certain the universe found a way to assist them. They are too young, free of scars and blemishes which once covered their bodies. Sometimes, he is afraid of breaking when he casts a spell with too much strength, energy making his arm vibrate.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I have made little progress,” he confesses as Edmund keeps on glancing at their chess board without daring to ask for a game yet. That's more convenient as he is exhausted. Might explain why he presses his head against the crook of Susan's neck, refusing to move for ten minutes.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“We have struggled on our side too. People laugh at us, mostly,” from the corner of his eyes, Peter is fairly certain there is <em>his</em> pocket knife between Lucy's fingers, and that she is playing with it. Oh well—</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Survival, <em>or something.</em></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Let's try harder, tomorrow.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Curling his legs on the couch, Peter needs to rest for a while. Or maybe a couple of days.</p>
<p align="justify">Oh no, he has homework.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     On a Tuesday,<em> again,</em> McGonadall visits, interrupting what was certainly an intense board game involving chores and Edmund teasing them relentlessly.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The fact she appears in the middle of the living-room without a warning is enough for Lucy to drop her cards all over the board while Peter curses. Not his most appropriate choice, although he doesn't have points to lose for his house.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">(He suspects that, once he gets sorted, he is going to make one quite unhappy with months of misbehavior.)</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I'm going to prepare some tea, please sit down on the couch,” Susan gestures for the youngest kids to put the game away where Peter stands there, uneasy by the fact she might be there to expel him. On a hand it would be a relief, on the other, he'd rather not deal with Susan's wrath.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Twelve minutes later, as she takes into account her surroundings, with mild disgust towards the beloved couch, the headmistress decides to engage the discussion. Peter has never noticed before, but she is quite tall in comparison to them. Or perhaps it's merely a feeling caused by how elegant she is.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">There is grace in her, in the same way Edmund can move without ever being heard, or Susan sips poison in people's drinks with kindness on her lips.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“While it wasn't in England, I found a precedent in regard to Squib acceptance.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Oh that's fantastic,” Lucy's eyes are gleaming with joy. And he hopes it won't be crushed by hearing the student got murdered after a while.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“The case has differences, as the person is a Seer. Therefore their magic still appears in this form. Albeit they cannot cast any spell or have a wand obey them.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“And they were allowed to be a student?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Yes, their mother is a prominent member of the Seer community in their country, which allowed her to push their government until she got what she wanted.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“A shame we do not have such power.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Pevensie, I find admirable your pursuit to your goal, even if I am disappointed of how stubborn you are regarding to it,” McGonadall's lips form a thin line as she continues, “have you told your siblings you refused to be sorted in a house and thus sleep in the infirmary.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Peter!” Three voices berate him at once, making the teenager wince.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“That's a meager sacrifice to get your case to be brought to light, Susan.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I do remember asking you to research their justice system, not turning yourself into a martyr for my sake.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">While they frown at each other, Lucy trying to distract them with tea, Edmund seizes the opportunity to intervene.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Would it be possible to have an audience with whoever is in charge in your court? I'd like to invite the person you mentioned too.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“By court, I assume you mean ministry?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Oh yes, I suppose.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Edmund's grin is too sharp at once.</p>
<p align="justify">Who cares about such detail?</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Azel Tsukuda offered a formidable speech, for what Edmund writes in his letter, inquiring out loud why Japan managed to integrate Squibs in their curriculum while Hogwarts insists on refusing children a chance to have a proper education. There were many questions regarding budget and planning, apparently. Most of them leading the people in charge of the school system to admit this would take a couple of years to change things.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">His younger brother had a fantastic time, still as fascinated by politics and history as he already was as a ruler. By that point, Peter isn't even convinced it happened, it's merely a feeling. And one day, like Susan, they will believe Narnia to be a game. Ah, he doesn't mind as much as he would have months prior. Back in school, and in the headmistress' office where he might end up living at this point, Peter crosses his fingers behind his back.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“That was successful, wasn't it?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Your brother was a formidable ally to your cause, asking appropriate questions with an impressive timing. To think he is only ten… And your sisters offered an excellent input to. Especially Susan, who made a poignant speech. I take it runs in the family? This ability to run for miracles and your blunt belief that you are always right.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Indeed,” Peter can't help the smile which appears on his lips. Sure, they are arrogant, and sometimes they pay a price for it. It's often worth it though.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“In five years, if the following discussions go well, we might get our first Squib students at Hogwarts. However, this is a long and arduous path.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Five years is too long, he wants to interrupt, not that he gets the time to do so.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“That's why, I have decided to start an experimental course for Squibs starting next year. This course will have only three students, sorted like any other and following a slightly different schedule.” As Peter proceeds what it means, she offers him a rare smile. “Your sister will receive an owl tomorrow, as she has been selected in priority.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">It's March.</p>
<p align="justify">In a couple of months, Susan will enter Hogwarts.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     A little bit late, Peter gets to sit under the Sorting Hat, curious students holding their breaths as they watch the show. He is aware they made bets on him, and quite high  ones for some. For what he hears from Jones, Slytherin is the most envisioned choice for him. He doesn't mind so much where he ends, as he is has taken on the habit to sit at either table depending on his mood.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>Hogwarts never had a student quite like you, Peter.</em>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Oh, I guess I'm a handful.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>You are, boy! I wonder where you'll be the most at ease. </em>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I'll make a home out of what you have to offer. My sister is joining next year—there are four of us, you know.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The silence above him might be a sign that the Sorting Hat is trying to plan its retirement to avoid meeting his siblings. Which would be understandable. Finally, after what feels like an eternity (probably twenty seconds) he hears its answer.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Hufflepuff!”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">That night, Peter gets the slumber party of his life in the common room, everyone eager to welcome him. Ah, that's odd, without his siblings he felt at a loss for months, and now that he gets homemade cupcakes and a stuffed badger (sewed by a fellow first year), he's quite at home indeed.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The next morning, Jones (Nelly to be more precise), calls him her brand new rival in the middle of the hallways, and he deals with this with a wave of the hand and a remark about first years being picked on. That's fun, honestly.</p>

<p align="justify">    Peter Pevensie ends his first year with average grades due to not having been very attentive all the time, and too many detentions. He might not be the king of the school, not that he minds. As soon as he is home for the Summer, he forgets everything to focus on his siblings. Susan bothers him for his textbooks, wanting to learn as much theory as she can, whereas the youngest drag him into chess games or long walks in the park.</p>

<p align="justify">“There is magic everywhere, even in us,” Lucy muses while she leans against an old tree.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I think it's great. We can build something new in this time.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Do you think He is watching us?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">She clings to what they had, or who they were. So much that Peter doesn't dare to admit he forgot most of it already, like Susan. Edmund remembers perfectly every second with Jadis and the rest if a wasteland, because she imprinted her magic into his bones, although that's another story.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“Yeah, I want to believe He is there.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">No matter his torn emotions about Aslan, and the betrayal he can still taste on his tongue without remembering it, Peter has the feeling their old guardian remains around. Watching over them with a critical eye when he has nothing else to do.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Lucy holds a hand towards the sky, as if she was trying to catch the sun.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I'm mad at Aslan too. It's just—”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I get it, no worry, Lu'.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">They're family, after all.</p>
