  <u>Chapter One</u>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Uncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier. Mrs Weasley was close by him. She hugged Harry very tightly when she saw him, and whispered in his ear, ‘I think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer. Keep in touch, Harry.’  </em>
</p>
<p>That was weeks ago, and despite all the letters that he had sent, not just to Ron and Hermione, but also to Sirius and Remus, even one to Mrs Weasley, he had received the shortest most uninformative replies, when he received anything at all. Harry rolled over and reached under his bed into the space beneath the loose floorboard and pulled out the letter he had received from Sirius at the end of term. Harry had discovered it in his pocket when he got back to the Dursleys and he still was not too sure how to interpret the contents of the short missive. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Pup, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> I’ve asked Molly to slip this note to you when she had a chance, I know those muggles don’t like you corresponding with “our sort” over the summer and I’m not sure when I’ll be able to send you an owl. Firstly, I hope you’re not taking Cedric’s death too hard. It was tragic and it should not have happened, but remember it was not your fault. You could not have foreseen what was to happen and there was nothing you could have done to prevent it. Naturally, you will grieve his loss, and that grief will feel much sharper when you have to deal with it on your own, but I am here for you, as is Remus. We have both known loss in our lives and hopefully we can help you if you need us.  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Alright, now that I’ve got the most important thing out of the way, there’s a few things you need to know about what’s coming up this summer. Due to the current state of affairs, Albus has ramped up security. The Death Eaters seem to be laying low, but we think you might be a target since you escaped the graveyard alive. The headmaster has imposed an information blackout so be careful what you put in any letters you send, as your owl might be intercepted. Albus has people watching your place, just in case the Death Eaters find you, and we can pull you out of there right away. I tried convincing him to just let you come stay with me this summer, but he says that family is important and the Dursleys have not seen you all year, so he wants to give you all time to reconnect. He gave Molly the same story when she asked if she could take you to the Burrow. Pardon my French but i think that is a load of hippogriff dung. You haven’t told us much about how it really is with the Dursleys, but we’ve seen enough to know that they don’t treat you right. Your Uncle always has a face like a thundercloud when he collects you from the station, you never go home for christmas, Ron has told us about the so called gifts they send you (a toothpick? really? why bother?), and how thin you always look when you come back to school. And don’t think Molly hasn’t told me about the summer before your second year when the boys had to break you loose from your own bedroom. What sort of family keeps a person locked in a room with bars on the window? I know I didn’t have the most sparkling example of a loving family growing up, but even I know that if they loved you like Dumbledore seems to think, they would not treat you like a misbehaving house elf.  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> To be honest, I don’t like the way Albus is handling things, but he’s the only one we’ve got to lead us in the fight against You-Know-Who. It looks like he’s going to try to isolate you from our world so it’s more difficult for the Death Eaters to track you down, but I don’t see why the folks he’s got keeping an eye on your place aren’t allowed to make themselves known. I’m sure the Dursleys will behave themselves if they see that you’ve got a 24 hour guard. Anyway, just in case I can’t write you again soon, just remember we’ve got your back here, Pup. Me and Remus, and Molly too. We’re working on getting you out of there as soon as we can. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Don’t let the muggles get you down,</em>
</p>
<p><em>Padfoot   </em> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry sighed softly and returned the letter to its hiding spot under the bed. He was glad that Sirius had been able to get his this letter. Harry would have been going crazy if he had been left completely out of the loop like it seemed Dumbledore was trying to do. What was the man up to? When he had first woken up in the hospital wing after the events of the third task and had told the headmaster about what had happened in the graveyard, Harry had been confident that the old man would know best what to do in the fight against Voldemort. Harry knew that there must be a lot of things happening that he wasn’t privy to, but it was so frustrating to be completely cut off from any information from the wizarding world. Harry had given up on trying to get any information out of his friends. Their letters were empty and meaningless. Dumbledore had told them not to send sensitive information in a letter in case the dark forces intercepted their owls, exactly as Sirius had said. All Harry had found out was that they were together and hoped that Harry would be allowed to join them soon. Harry acknowledged that it was not their fault that he was stuck with the Dursleys but the unfairness of it still stung, that they were allowed to spend the summer together having fun while he was left to roam the streets of Little Whinging alone. </p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes to the sound of Petunia and Vernon moving around, and by the time he had pulled on a fresh set of clothes and run his fingers through his messy hair, his aunt was banging on the door demanding that he wake up and get started on breakfast. He opened his curtains and had a look around what he could see of Privet Drive, hoping to spot the witch or wizard who was lucky enough to be watching his house on this dreary overcast day. Not seeing anyone, Harry headed downstairs.</p>
<p>‘You took your time, boy.’ Vernon was already sitting in his place at the head of the table when Harry entered the kitchen, newspaper held up in front of him. ‘Come on, coffee!’ </p>
<p>Harry filled the water reservoir in the coffee machine and spooned in some fresh coffee grounds, turning to the pantry to get started on the food while the machine did its job. Petunia grabbed him by the wrist when he passed her, swingin him around so she could look at him.</p>
<p>‘Now, I want you to make us a special breakfast today. My Diddykins will be home any time now, and who knows what they have been feeding him at that camp of his. If I see you trying to ruin Dudley’s breakfast in any way at all, you will be back in that cupboard before you can blink!” She glared at him until she heard a soft ‘Yes, Aunt Petunia’ and then released his wrist, turning him around and shoving him back in the direction of the pantry. Harry rubbed his wrist and gingerly moved it around, wiggling his fingers to get rid of the pins and needles that had begun to develop. He silently went about making breakfast, being sure to cook double portions of everything for Dudley’s enjoyment. When the coffee was ready, Harry poured a cup for his uncle and set it down on the table in front of the large man, getting no thanks. Before Vernon could make any more demands, they were interrupted by the sound of the front door opening and closing, and Dudley’s voice rang out from the front hallway, ‘Mum! Dad! I’m home!’   </p>
<p>Harry was momentarily rendered speechless by his cousin’s appearance when Dudley walked into the kitchen. He had to admit, all that boxing training was doing his cousin a lot of good. No longer did he look like a baby whale, waiting to be airlifted back to the ocean. Dudley’s pudgy body had matured into a beefy, muscly physique which told volumes about how hard the boy had been training during the past year.</p>
<p>‘Diddydums! Mummy missed you so much!’ Petunia swooped down on her son, pulling him into a crushing hug. Harry noticed that she now had to stoop slightly to hug Dudley properly. ‘Come now, darling, let mummy get you something to eat. Look at you! They must have been starving you at that school, you’re skin and bones!’ She led Dudley to his place at the table, still muttering about having a word to whoever was in charge of the food at Smeltings. </p>
<p>‘Its alright, mum,’ Dudley took the plate that Petunia was trying to pile high with food and served himself a plate that to Harry’s surprise was a normal sized portion, as opposed to the gargantuan servings he was accustomed to seeing his cousin devour. He looked to where Harry stood, wiping the bench and tidying the cooking things, and motioned towards the table with his head, ‘Why don’t you join us, cousin? There’s plenty of food and I wouldn’t want it to go to waste.’</p>
<p>Harry glanced at his aunt and uncle before moving to join the family at the table. Vernon looked constipated and silently hid himself behind his newspaper once more. Petunia sucked on her lips as though she had been force-fed a lemon but said nothing to contradict her beloved son. So that was how, for the first time he could remember, Harry was able to enjoy a full-sized meal at the dining table with the Dursley family.  </p>
