    <p>The day was uncomfortably warm with the late-morning sun brightly shining and clothing clinging to sweat-damp skin.  <em>Lucky to be a witch</em>.  She thought as she subtly refreshed her cooling charm.  A young mother struggled with her crying child as she crossed the street.  Carefully she stepped over the fallen treat as she made her way towards her destination, orange ice cream melting into a puddle on the sidewalk behind her.  </p><p>Just ahead, behind black metal fencing, was the home she was seeking—large and Victorian, somewhat dilapidated with peeling paint and a missing shutter.  She noted the random assortment of children’s toys strewn about the yard and the crude chalk drawings on the sidewalk leading to the porch.  The stairs creaked as she approached the dark wooden door.  She thought it odd, the lack of children outside, as she rang the doorbell. Her unspoken question was quickly answered as a small blond-headed boy with missing front teeth opened the door and she was hit with a blast of cool air.  </p><p>“Jason!  What have I told you about answering the door without an adult!”  The chastisement came from a woman walking quickly towards them from an unseen part of the house.  </p><p>“Not to!” The boy, Jason, replied as he took off in the opposite direction. </p><p>“So sorry about that ma’am,” she breathed, continuing to approach Minerva at that same quick pace.  “How may I help you?”</p><p>“Good morning, I am Professor McGonagall.  I am here for an appointment with Sara Young.”</p><p>“Oh, good morning, Professor!  I’m Sara, and I must say it is a pleasure to finally meet you.  Come right this way; we can use Jennifer’s office.”</p><p>Sara appeared to be in her early thirties with a kind, round face, mousy brown hair and warm, dark eyes.  As Sara led her through the home, she noticed more and more evidence of children—a few scattered toys, the sound of running feet and high-pitched voices, a glimpse of a trio playing tag.  </p><p>“I’ll be in your office for a bit, Jen!” Sara raised her voice and called up a set of large stairs.  </p><p>“Alright!” A voice called back, and Sara directed her towards a darkened room near the staircase.  </p><p>“Make yourself at home,” she said as she turned on the overhead light.  The room seemed small with the large wooden desk and file cabinets taking space.  Minerva sat in the nearest of the two olive wingback chairs while Sara closed the door and sat in the old leather chair behind the desk.</p><p>“So,” Sara began “Lyra has been accepted at a private boarding school in Scotland.”</p><p>“Yes, Miss Black has been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,” Minerva confirmed.  </p><p>“I’m sorry…did you just say witchcraft?” Sara laughed, disbelief coloring her face.  </p><p>“Yes, Ms. Young, witchcraft.  I am a witch and the transfiguration professor at Hogwarts.  Magic is quite real.”  Minerva said as she pulled her wand from her robes.  Sara’s eyes widened as a grey tabby cat sat where, just seconds ago, the austere woman had been.  </p><p>“Magic,” she huffed leaning backwards in her seat, watching as the tabby disappeared and the woman was there once more. “And Lyra is a witch, too?  Well, that certainly explains some things,” she muttered after the professor’s nod of assent.  “Can you please tell me more about this school and about the, um, magical world?”  Her voice pitched high at the last two words.</p><p>“Of course, Ms. Young,” Minerva began.  “In the United Kingdom, the Ministry for Magic is the governing body, and the Ministry has passed the Statute of Secrecy.  The Statute of Secrecy ensures that the presence of magic and magical folk is not revealed to the non-magical world.  As Miss Black’s caseworker, you are an exception to this law but are beholden to certain by-laws.  Now, as you know, she will be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  As Deputy Headmistress, one of my duties is to meet with Muggleborn students prior to their first semester.  ‘Muggleborn’ is a term used in the magical world to denote magical children born to and living in the nonmagical world.  At Hogwarts, Miss Black will learn all she needs to be successful in our world.  The term begins on September first and—”</p><p>“September first!” Sara interrupted, “that’s two days from now!”  She blushed at the professor’s glare, feeling like a schoolgirl once again, “I apologize for interrupting, ma’am.  Please continue.”</p><p>“Apology accepted, Ms. Young.  Now, I understand that this is short notice, but Muggleborns are traditionally notified on their eleventh birthday.  The term ends in June, and Miss Black will be returned to your care for the summer.  With your permission, I will take the child to the magical part of London today to obtain her school supplies.  The school has a program for children who do not have little means, so there is no need to worry about payment.”</p><p>“That’s a relief; unfortunately, our funding is, well, poor at the moment.  And, I suppose that would be alright.  It is not something we normally allow, but this is a special circumstance.  We would need you to sign her out and sign her back in when you bring her back.”  Sara paused for a moment.  “As Lyra is a foster child, I will be needing to check in on her periodically at the school to ensure her wellbeing.  And, as the school will be responsible for her for a period of time, it is important for you to know that Lyra is special,” Sara said delicately.  “Unfortunately, Lyra has not had the best foster care experience.  She has been abused in the past and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.”  At the professor’s questioning look, Sara continued.  “Post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is a psychological disorder.  I believe American psychologists coined the term after the war in Vietnam.  For Lyra, this means that she has anxiety problems, nightmares, and flashbacks; she has seen counselors for this and is now doing much better.  She is a very resilient child, and she loves school.  I am sure she will be very excited to her the news.”</p><p>“There are many with special needs at our school, and I have every confidence in our Mediwitch.  She takes good care of our students.  I would be happy to correspond with you and to arrange for you to come to the school and check on Miss Black.  Now, may I meet the child?”  Minerva asked.</p><p>“Oh yes, right this way.” Sara said as she got up from her chair.  Minerva followed the woman back to the staircase, and they began to make their way upstairs.  “Lyra’s room is in the attic,” Sara explained.  “We had problems previously with her disturbing the other children at night, accidentally of course.  She can’t help it.”  </p><p>As they continued past the first floor, they found the staircase blocked by a group of four girls.  “Excuse me girls, our guest and I need to use the staircase.  Please take this another area.”  As the girls began to disperse, Minerva noticed an older girl hanging behind, staring at her.  </p><p>“Are you here to take the freak away?”</p><p>“Sloane, you know better than to speak that way,” Sara intervened.  “Now please go with the other girls.”  </p><p>The girl rolled her eyes and with a muttered “whatever,” she made her way down the hall.  </p><p>Sara began leading the way up the stairs once more.  “We’ve got eleven kids in this group home, ranging in age from 4 years to 15 years, and three staff members here twenty-four hours a day.  Not everyone gets along all the time, but we do our best.  Lyra’s room is just here.” </p><p>The door opened to a small room with a single bed pushed up against the wall opposite the door.  The closet was without a door, and Minerva could make out a few pairs of tops and trousers and a winter coat.  There was a single window, and on the sill, there was a framed picture of two girls hugging.  Beneath the window, there was a young girl sitting on the floor.  Her knees were pulled up to her chest, and she held a book in her hands.  She looked at Minerva and Sara with large, pale blue eyes from underneath dark, full eyebrows.  She had a slightly pointed nose and chin with thin, rosy lips.  Her hair was either a very dark brown or black and was long and straight.</p><p>“Hello, again, Lyra.  And happy birthday.”  The girl nodded in response, a small smile playing on her lips.  “You have a guest today.  This is Professor McGonagall; she’s here from the private school in Scotland we discussed earlier.”</p><p>Minerva took this as her cue and launched into the spiel.  “Good morning, Miss Black.  The school you have been accepted to is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  You are a witch, Miss Black, as am I.”  Minerva then took out her wand and transfigured Lyra’s book into a small rabbit.  “And at school you will learn how to perform magic like this and more.”  She allowed the child to pet the small animal before undoing her transfiguration.  The child continued to remain quiet, her blue eyes piercing.</p><p>“Lyra, Professor McGonagall is going to take you into the magical world today to gather your school supplies.  I expect you to mind her and not wander off.”  Lyra nodded and stood up.  She looked small for eleven, her clothes too large and her limbs thin.  She went over to the closet and pulled from it a backpack.  She put her book in and began packing clothes before Sara interrupted.  
“There’s no need to pack, Lyra.  You’ll just be gone with Professor McGonagall for a few hours, alright?”  Lyra nodded and put her clothes away but kept the bag.  </p><p>“Come now, Miss Black.  It’s time to go.”  Minerva said heading back towards the ground floor.</p>
