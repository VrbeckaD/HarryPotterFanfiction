          <div class="userstuff"><p>"I'm just looking out the window and it's cold outside, there's two boys yelling behind me and I'm terrified," Hermione whispered, and her friend grabbed her hand. </p><p>"Counting trees as they pass me by, and I'm trying not to look across the isle, cause Draco's letting Harry out his hand up his shirt and he's got his hand down his pants." She whispered, intently staring out the window. </p><p>"I know the driver sees it, I know he's peeking in the rearview mirror." Hermione watched as Lupin glanced at the boys for the tenth time. "He says nothing."</p><p>"Trying to ignore it, its fucking boring." Pansy turned, and Hermione did too, "I'm quietly observing, I'm saying nothing."</p><p>"No one's watching us?" Draco whispered, face flushed,</p><p>"Don't give a fuck." Harry whispered back, leaning Draco up against the window. </p><p>"Wheels on the bus," Pansy turned to Hermione, and the girl got up, walking to the front, "I'm holding it up at the front." People looked at her, "Wheels on the bus," Pansy said again, and Hermione repeated. </p><p>After being sent back to her seat, Hermione pulled her purse out, "I'ma light it up and pass it, puff, puff and pass it."</p><p>"Don't be a dick and babysit, come on, just pass it over here." Someone yelled from behind them, and Hermione tossed the bag over. </p><p>"Counting cars as they pass me by, trying not to look behind me cause Ron's got his ass on the glass. And I hate him, driver hit a bump fast." Pansy hissed and Hermione grinned at her. </p><p>"I know the driver sees it. I know he's peeking in the rearview mirror, but trying to ignore it is fucking boring. I'm quietly observing, I'm saying nothing." She mumbled on her friends cheek, leaving a small kiss. </p><p>"No one's watching us, don't give a fuck." She whispered, hand on Hermione's inner thigh, "Wheels on the bus." She clambered over, hiking her skirt up. </p><p>"I was holding it up in the front." Hermione kissed her neck, "Wheels on the bus."</p><p>"Wheels on the bus." The shorter girl whispered, and Hermione repeated. </p><p>"No one's watching us, don't give a fuck." She whispered again, sliding her cardigan off, "Wheels on the bus."</p><p>"Wheels on the bus."</p></div>
