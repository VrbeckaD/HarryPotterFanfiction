    <p>The window seats in Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour are rather tall, and Tiffany has to hand her peanut butter ice-cream to Rowan so that she can climb up onto it. She feels a bit like a child, but still can’t resist the urge to swing her legs as her feet seem to be miles off the ground.</p><p> </p><p>“So I have some theories about that book and the wand you found in the Ice Vault.” Rowan says, handing back Tiffany’s ice cream. “Can I see the wand, by the way?”</p><p> </p><p>Tiffany is too busy licking her ice cream to reply, but she does use her free hand to put the two halves of the wand on the table. Rowan picks it up, and studies it for a brief moment.</p><p> </p><p>“The wood is maple, but I don’t know enough about wand cores to figure out anything else.” Rowan says after a pause.</p><p> </p><p>“Maple wood, dragon heartstring core, ten inches.” Tiffany eventually comments once she’s certain her ice cream isn’t about to melt over her fingers. “That’s what Ollivander said Jacob’s wand was when I got mine.”</p><p> </p><p>“You have a good memory!” Rowan comments, sounding surprised.</p><p> </p><p>“I try to remember everything I can about Jacob.” Tiffany says. “How else will I find clues to where he is?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I don’t know how helpful his broken wand will be, but I hope for his sake he’s managed to find another one to use.” Rowan says carefully. Tiffany is sure Rowan doesn’t believe Jacob to be alive, but doesn’t like to admit that to Tiffany’s face. It’s a good thing too; Tiffany has had many shouting matches with her own mother on this very topic, and even though Rowan is her best friend she’s willing to argue with her on this too.</p><p> </p><p>“Any thoughts about the book?” Tiffany asks.</p><p> </p><p>“Not anything I can confirm until we go back to Hogwarts.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s probably Jacob’s too.” Tiffany reasons. “Bill said the scribbles look like they were done by a mad man, but Jacob wasn’t exactly… artistic.”</p><p> </p><p>“Is he better or worse at drawing than you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh piss off.” Tiffany smiles, despite the insult.</p><hr/><p>Once they finish their ice creams, Rowan having to scrub at her mouth thoroughly to make herself presentable, they head outside onto the street. Diagon Alley is much quieter than what Tiffany is used too, but then she supposes that no one has their school supply lists yet, and so the normal school rush hasn’t started. Tiffany and Rowan are on their way to the local sweetshop when something catches their eye; the papers on display outside the Daily Prophet offices. Tiffany picks one up, slightly horrified at the headline.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>Pesky Pemberton!</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Saviour of Hogwarts, or troublemaker?</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>By Rita Skeeter.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Hey!” Tiffany snaps, when Rowan tugs it out of her grasp. “I was reading that!”</p><p> </p><p>“Somehow I don’t think you want to read this, Tiffany.” Rowan reasons. “How does Skeeter even know all this stuff anyway?”</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s written about you breaking the ice curse, but this is really in detail, most of it correct!” Rowan exclaims. “Although not the forbidden romance bit, I hope.”</p><p> </p><p>“Romance?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry about it!”</p><hr/><p>Floo is by far Tiffany’s least favourite mode of transport. She chokes on ash as she tumbles into her living room, already aware that her next task would be to hoover the soot covered floor. Tiffany pushes herself back to her feet, and dusts herself off, blinking to clear her vision. The house seems suspiciously quiet. She makes her way through to the dining room, and grimaces. There’s a copy of the Daily Prophet left on the table in clear view. She groans, and considers throwing at away, but knows that her parents have likely already read it.</p><p> </p><p>“Tiffany.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, Mama!” Tiffany tries to smile innocently. “How are you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Would you like to explain yourself?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rita Skeeter really isn’t a reliable source, Mama. I wouldn’t take what she says seriously.”</p><p> </p><p>“I had a letter saying you broke school rules, but breaking the curse on a Cursed Vault? Tiffany, what were you thinking?”</p><p> </p><p>“I was thinking…” Tiffany trails off, wandering what the best course of action is right now. “That…” Her brain is supplying nothing helpful. “It would be fun?”</p><p> </p><p>“Tiffany?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Mama?”</p><p> </p><p>“Go to your room.”</p><p> </p><p>Tiffany scowls, but doesn’t complain as she stomps her way to her room, slamming the door as loudly as she can once she reaches it. Her mother is shouting at her about her ‘attitude’, but Tiffany tunes it out in favour of putting music on. She plonks herself down at her desk where it seems her parents have left a few letters addressed to her.</p><p> </p><p>One is a letter from Charlie (and Bill) telling her that him and his brothers are spending the summer holidays with their Aunt in Cornwall, and there’s another from Andre telling her about his new Pride of Portree poster. Finally, there’s a letter from Penny, unusually short from the girl who begged her to write over the summer. Then again, Penny is likely just busy.</p><p> </p><p>Tiffany gets to work replying, not letting her friends know about how she’s likely going to be grounded for the second summer running, but telling them about enjoying her time with Rowan in Diagon Alley, and recommending them ice cream flavours. For Penny, she writes an extra line telling her friend that if anything is wrong, she’s here to help. She sets all the letters to one side, ready to be sent when she can find her way to an Owl Post Office, an easy enough task in the West Country, what with all the semi-wizarding villages dotted around the countryside.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually there’s a knock on her door, and her mother enters her room before waiting for a response from Tiffany. She almost looks apologetic, but with her arms folded she comes across as more defensive than anything else.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you ready to talk about it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Talk about what, Mama?” Tiffany narrows her eyes, readying herself for an argument.</p><p> </p><p>“Why you thought it was a good idea to try and break into that Vault?” Her voice is already rising in volume.</p><p> </p><p>“People <em>would</em> have died.” Tiffany replies flatly. “If I did nothing, they would have died, and I would have been to blame for it. So I saved them. It’s… logical.”</p><p> </p><p>“Logical? Tiffany, you’re thirteen!” Her mother protests. “How is any of that logical?”</p><p> </p><p>“Do nothing and let people die, do something and save them?”</p><p> </p><p>“And get yourself killed!”</p><p> </p><p>“But I didn’t die, so there’s no problem.” Tiffany points out, turning in her chair to face away from her mother.</p><p> </p><p>“If you’re going to keep breaking rules… at least find your brother.”</p><p> </p><p>This gets Tiffany’s interest, although she refuses to turn back around. She's a Pemberton, and Pemberton's are nothing if not stubborn. </p><p> </p><p>“I thought you thought he was dead?”</p><p> </p><p>“Just find him, Tiffany.” The door clicks shut. That was not what Tiffany expected. At least she now has her mother's permission to keep looking for Jacob, although somehow she doubts the faculty at school will accept that as an excuse for rule breaking. </p>
