  <p dir="ltr">To the elites and ordinary citizens of the Capital, there was nothing special about the girl from District 12. The upbeat, weirdly-dressed escort, the Capitol’s very own eccentric Luna Lovegood (who was too crazy and otherworldly even for them), moved her hand this way and that in the blue bowl of fire, completely unfazed and untouched by the licking flames. She held up a single slip to the cameras.</p>

  <p dir="ltr">This Reaping of District 12 was no different than the ones before it.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">A name was called. This one for the ladies.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">“Hermione Granger.”</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">The sea of pale faces turned to the girl with a frightening mass of dark hair. She herself did not cry, though she could hear the muffled shrieks from her mother and the soothing lies her father speaks under his breath across the square of District 12. She will be alright, she heard him say. The crowd of seventeen year olds parted for her, quickly stepping away from her with nothing but silence and resignation.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">She made her way up to the stage and listened as no one volunteered for her. Luna trotted over the other bowl of flames and selected a male tribute. The boy was just as unremarkable as her. Short in height but yet fifteen years old, he sobbed softly to himself.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">No one volunteered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">It was not a surprise.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Both tributes of District 12 looked weak as the scores of District 12 tributes before them. The Capital, the audience, the Gamemakers, and everyone in District 12 knew the boy would die the first hour. Within the first 10 minutes of the 73rd Hunger Games.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">They were right.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">They knew the girl, despite how bright and clever she was, would fall short of extraordinary. She would not survive the first day.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">How very wrong they were.</p>
