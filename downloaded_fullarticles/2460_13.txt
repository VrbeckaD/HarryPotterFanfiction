    <p>
  <span>It seemed so mundane, so out of place to be sitting in a cafe when there were other, more important matters to attend. When there were so many things to think about. She supposed that the cafe was a nice break from the bustle and clamor of daily life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Annie didn’t even like coffee, if she were being honest and yet, she let Hitch drag her away from her duties to bring her there. “You always look so tense.” The girl rolled her eyes. “We have to do something about that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Annie was perfectly content to remain tense in light of things. She stared down at the silver band on her finger. Within seventy-two hours she would begin her mission. She drummed her fingers on the table, not knowing what else to do. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The barista returned with their steaming beverages. Really, she ought to be appreciative, the citizens in the confines of Wall Rose would fight one another for the beverage that Annie simply stared at. With an audible sigh, she sipped at the hot drink. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She fought the urge to scrunch her face and spit it out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well?” Hitch asked in a sing-song.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Was Hitch truly expecting her to thank her for this?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well what?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hitch rolled her eyes. “You’re welcome. I didn’t have to cut into my time to help you have a little break.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had cut into </span>
  <em>
    <span>her </span>
  </em>
  <span>time? Now there was a priceless notion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Annie took another drink. She hated it, but might as well savor it, it would probably be the last time she had an opportunity to taste something so horribly bitter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Without warning, Hitch leaned over and tucked Annie’s bangs behind her ears. “Ya know, you could be so pretty if you put even minimum effort in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Annie shrugged, struggling to see the point. Pretting herself up implied that she would be around long enough for first impressions to mean anything. Long enough to form bonds that she would keep. She wouldn’t get attached to anyone and she was going to make sure no one would get attached to her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet, it seemed as though Hitch already had.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I just don’t get it.” She gave a humming sigh. “I don’t get you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s fine.” Annie muttered, pushing her coffee mug to the side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hitch’s hand came to cup her cheek. Annie wondered if it was even worth it to lecture the girl about personal space. “Why don’t you let people in? Are you worried that people won’t like you?” That wasn’t it at all. “I think that they would.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Annie shrugged again. “Okay.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This caused Hitch to sigh again. “I guess I’m going to have to do all of the work.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because you’re Wall Shina’s hardest worker on a normal day.” Annie commented dryly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If the remark had bothered Hitch she certainly had a strange way of showing it. She rubbed her thumb against Annie’s cheek and closed the space between them. It was rather awkward, with the table in between them, but it was a kiss no less. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was the first time Annie had been kissed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And it would be the only. </span>
