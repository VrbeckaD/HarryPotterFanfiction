  <em> “So when are we going to acknowledge this, Granger?” He asked in a low voice, arms crossed as he eyed her with amusement. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “Acknowledge what?” She asked evasively, shifting a little against the desk, heart rate speeding up on its own at the implication. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> His lip curled up into that signature smirk as he reached out and grabbed her hand, pulling her close, “This thing between us.” </em>
</p>
<p>Five years after the Battle of Hogwarts, the Hogwarts professors have been totally re-staffed by none other than the Golden Trio and their classmates. Ever since the Battle, Hermione has been dating Ron, though things haven’t been good between them in a long time. With Draco and Hermione heading up the school’s Dueling Club, it’s guaranteed to be an interesting year, indeed. </p>
<p>Slow-burn friendship to romance DM/HG (Dramione HEA) / Post-BoH compliant, DH epilogue not applicable. Rocky/Unhappy RW/HG in the beginning, rated M for sexual content in later chapters.</p>
<p>*Warning: Ron/Hermione are together (unhappily) for a bit of this story but it is a background relationship as the DM/HG unfolds. I wanted to be upfront about that and I truly hope you enjoy the story!</p>
<p><b>Chapter 1:</b> Professors</p>
<p>O-o-o-o-o-o-o</p>
<p>“Alright, everyone quiet down,” Hermione said from the front of the Transfiguration classroom as her new first year students took their seats, “If you take a look up on the board, you’ll find the syllabus for the year,” she flicked her wand and the chalk started writing on the board, “Our first lesson will be a bit of background on the Magical uses of transfiguration and the theoreticals behind what we’ll be doing this year. Next class we’ll start with our first round of transfiguration spells.”</p>
<p>There was a murmur of excitement that spread through the room and she couldn't help but smile, thinking back to <em> her </em> first class at Hogwarts, “Please take a few minutes to copy down the syllabus for your reference and we’ll begin class when everyone is finished.”</p>
<p>There was a quiet fluttering of parchment and quills as students began copying down notes. Hermione wandered the rows, acknowledging how different it was to be on the other side. </p>
<p>After the Battle of Hogwarts, she, Harry and Ron had returned to Hogwarts for their unofficial 7th year along with a slew of others from their class who wanted to redo the year outside of the reign of the Carrows. The Wizarding World had taken years to put itself back together, to fill positions at the Ministry and reinstall confidence in the government, to rebuild Hogwarts from the battle, and to heal from the losses.</p>
<p>After graduating from Hogwarts, a notice had gone around to the Wizarding community in England that the staff at Hogwarts had collectively decided that, in the aftermath of the war and trauma of working under the Carrows, many professors would be retiring from the school in the coming years. In the wake of turnover, many of the old students stepped up to take apprenticeships with the current professors to take over their positions, Harry, Ron and herself among the many willing witches and wizards. It was to be a one year crash course in teaching, like a graduate program, followed by a three year training period of shadowing the staff in their specific subjects and preparing to fill big shoes.</p>
<p>It was now five years after the Battle of Hogwarts and Hermione had officially taken over the professor position for Transfiguration, Harry had taken Defense Against the Dark Arts, Ron had taken over for Madam Hooch giving flying lessons and coordinating Quidditch, Ginny had stepped in for Charms, Neville in Herbology, Dean and Seamus in Muggle Studies and History of Magic, Luna in Divination, Ernie Macmillan in Astronomy, Hannah Abbott in Arithmancy, Padma Patil in Care of Magical Creatures and, surprisingly, Draco Malfoy in Potions. McGonagall was still Headmistress, and, much to everyone’s dismay, Filch was still the caretaker with the help of Mrs. Norris.</p>
<p>“Professor Granger,” an enthusiastic looking Hufflepuff named Patrick, who had introduced himself the minute he’d walked into the room, raised his hand.</p>
<p>“Yes, Patrick?” She asked, walking over.</p>
<p>“The Syllabus says we’ve got twelve inches due on element changing spells for our next class but I’ve already done it and it’s closer to eighteen inches, is that alright?”</p>
<p>Hermione tried her hardest not to laugh. It was like listening to a younger version of herself on the first day of class, “That’ll do just fine.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ve no idea how I would ever cut parts out,” he turned back to the chalk board and continued to write as Hermione resumed her pacing through the rows.</p>
<p>She’d been dating Ron since after the Battle of Hogwarts. They’d known for years that they had feelings for each other and it had been such a relief to have each other in that time of grief. He’d gone with her on the quest to find her parents and restore their memories. She’d been by his side at Fred’s funeral. The Weasleys had taken her in like another of their own when Ron had introduced her as his girlfriend for the first time. Their relationship had been a ray of light in dark times. </p>
<p>Now… it had been years of a mostly content companionship with some hiccups along the way. Of course she loved him, she always had, but there hadn’t been a spark for a long time. She sighed subconsciously. Ron had proposed at the end of the summer and she had accepted, it felt like it had always been the plan and it’s what everyone expected. She always thought she’d cry tears of joy when she got engaged, and she hadn’t; alternatively, they had shared some version of a hopeful smile that this was the right decision as he’d handed her the ring to put on. If she had to guess, he’d likely been urged by Mrs. Weasley to move things along because they hadn’t really talked about an engagement at all before it happened. </p>
<p>She twirled the ring around her finger as she walked the classroom. They hadn’t set a date yet because there was no rush and neither of them had taken the reigns on planning yet. Gods knew she’d be doing it all anyway. She was sure they would build a nice life together once they were married, though, that would probably force them to put aside their differences. He was still her best friend, underneath it all.</p>
<p>Harry and Ginny had also started dating after the Battle, getting engaged sooner than her and Ron and had been married a little over a year ago now. They were happy, ecstatic even, to be with each other. She’d never know two people to be as right for each other as they were. Ginny just <em> got </em> Harry. She’d been possessed by Voldemort similar to how he’d been connected to him. She’d lost a brother like he’d lost parents. She was the only one, really, who knew how to take Harry in his down moments and turn it around before he even had the chance to sulk. </p>
<p>They just always seemed like the best versions of themselves together. And they didn’t fight like her and Ron did. Not that she would ever compare her own relationship to anyone else’s. She knew Ron cared for her very much, they just both forgot how to express it sometimes.</p>
<p>She thought about the other new professors; her old classmates. It was a welcomed reunion to see everyone together shaping the minds of a new generation. One that had lived through the same devastating times, but hadn’t been quite old enough to grasp the full weight of the war, unless of course they had lost family members. It was a generation that, for the most part, could still find peace at night. Something the rest of them still had problems with.</p>
<p>The one addition to the staff that seemed to fill her thoughts more than others was Draco Malfoy. She hadn't expected to see him on the roster, but there he was. Another old classmate, Susan Bones, was supposed to take over the Potions position, but over the summer, her father had fallen ill and she had removed herself from the position. She hadn't heard much about Malfoy after the battle and he hadn't redone seventh year with the rest of them. However, she'd overheard Professor Slughorn talking about the new candidates that had applied to take over for him, and raving about Malfoy's skills. She'd even overheard McGonagall comment back that his N.E.W.T. scores had been exceptional in the subject as well, which made her wonder if Malfoy had taken his seventh year classes and N.E.W.T.s away from Hogwarts. A few days later the staff had been informed that he had been extended the offer, and had accepted. Ron had groaned, Harry had looked curious.</p>
<p>Malfoy had been exonerated in the Death Eater trials, Harry testifying on behalf of him and his mother. Lucius had been sent to Azkaban to do a six year sentence, meaning he was likely due to be released next summer, but Draco and his mother had returned to the Manor, unscathed. They had all watched him walk away from the Battle, Harry insisting he’d only came after him in the Room of Requirement to try and get his wand back and not to thwart their horcrux hunt. They had all attended his trial. She had seen him standing behind a tree at Fred’s funeral and had watched him walk up to the grave as they walked away. She didn’t think anyone else had noticed him there. But they had all seen the remorse. And then he had disappeared. He had retreated to the Manor and not many people had heard from him since, albeit through whispers of those who saw him popping in and out of town once in a while.</p>
<p>Tonight was their first staff meeting and Hermione was quite intrigued to see how it would play out.</p>
<p>“If you’ve all finished up with your notes, we can get started with the lesson,” she had reached the front of the room again and looked around as most of the students were setting down their quills.</p>
<p>O-o-o-o-o-o-o</p>
<p>“Good evening, Professors,” came the voice of Headmistress McGonagall as everyone in the room quieted. She stood up in front and looked around at them all, “So good to see all of you here in this capacity. It’s been a long few years of apprenticeships but now, the minds of our Hogwarts students are yours. For better or worse,” she smiled and a few chuckles echoed.</p>
<p>“I’d like to introduce you to your newest colleague, who of course you all already know. Mr. Malfoy, if you’d like to stand up.”</p>
<p>Draco glanced around the room, his face expressionless, before standing up.</p>
<p>“Mr. Malfoy will be taking over for Professor Slughorn in Potions. As you all know, Susan had to return home for a family emergency and Mr. Malfoy was one of the first to apply for the position,” she gave him a nod and he sat back down.</p>
<p>“Now, it’s not just professor positions we’ve had to fill, but also heads of house and extracurriculars. I’ve gone through the process of determining who will be helping out with what this year and we’ll just see how it goes,” she eyed the group, “Heads of House will be Ms. Granger for Gryffindor, Mr. Macmillan for Hufflepuff, Ms. Lovegood for Ravenclaw, and Mr. Malfoy for Slytherin,” there were a few whispers and McGonagall cleared her throat, “Now for our extracurriculars, Mr. Weasley, you will obviously be handling all Quidditch related items such as team practices, match scheduling, etc., and I’ve also got you heading up our Wizards Chess club. We’ll be hosting the Dueling Club again and I’ve assigned Ms. Granger and Mr. Malfoy to that. We’ll also be continuing our school choir…”</p>
<p>She was still talking, but Hermione didn’t catch the next few things she said. She had been paired up with Malfoy to host the Dueling Club. Mcgonagall would be lucky if her and Malfoy didn’t duel <em> each other </em>. Did she forget they were school rivals? Did she want a bad example set for the students?</p>
<p>“Ms. Granger?”</p>
<p>Hermione blinked a few times, “Sorry, Headmistress, what was that?”</p>
<p>“I asked if you had any objections to the weekly Head of House meetings,” McGonagall was looking at her curiously.</p>
<p>“Of course not,” she smiled, “Makes perfect sense. I can take the lead on setting those up and preparing agendas.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful,” McGonagall said, turning back to her list of items to address.</p>
<p>Hermione glanced over at Draco who was in back of her a couple of rows. It looked like he was rolling his eyes. She turned back around, already annoyed with him. As much as she wanted to think the war had changed him, maybe she’d been mistaken.</p>
<p>It was going to be a long year, indeed.</p>
<p>O-o-o-o-o-o-o</p>
