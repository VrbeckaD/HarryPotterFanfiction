    <p>“What have you gotten yourself into this time Potter?!” </p>
<p>“I wouldn’t know, and I’m not the only one Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“It’s all your fault!” </p>
<p>“Not really, you were the one following me. I’m sure I was supposed to be taken, but you are here because of your own stupidity.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t following you!”</p>
<p>“Then tell me, why are you here? Because I was taken in the Forbidden Forest, nowhere close to the castle. Where you were supposed to be.” </p>
<p>Draco pulled at the chains that was around his wrists. “Will you stop doing that Malfoy!” Harry yelled at the person responsible for pulling his arms even higher above his head. Draco just smirked at the fact that he had managed to hurt Harry without having to do anything. </p>
<p>“I’ve been nice to you! I’m not made to be stretched like that!” </p>
<p>“Is the Chosen One in pain because of a little stretching? And at the hands of the person he hates.” </p>
<p>“Don’t call me that!” </p>
<p>“And why is that Potter?” </p>
<p>“Because I hate what I had to do because of the title. Hurting people that I love, killing people that is supposedly against me. Then go on and be praised by the fact that I had to kill someone. Not by choice but force.” Harry looked down on the floor that he was sitting on, tied down. Harry could feel his emotions surfacing and didn’t want Draco to see them. </p>
<p>“Is Potter going to cry now?” Draco said hauntingly. </p>
<p>“Just shut up Malfoy!” </p>
<p>Draco was about to tease Harry even more, but someone opened the door to their cage and walked in. To their surprise it was none other than Ron Weasley, the one they thought was locked up in Azkaban for his actions against Harry in fifth year. </p>
<p>“How the hell did you get out!?” Draco asked with a repulsed face. </p>
<p>“That wasn’t hard at all since the dementors are gone, thanks to Harry. But the hard thing was to get a hold of Harry alone. And that didn’t work since I had to take you as well, Malfoy. But that can’t be helped, I should have remembered that you wouldn’t leave Harry alone. So here we are.” </p>
<p>“What do you want with me Ron!” Harry asked Ron angrily. </p>
<p>“I want to take revenge, since you sent me to Azkaban.” Ron said with a creepy smile. </p>
<p>“Wait a moment. Harry sent you to Azkaban?” Draco asked in disbelief, he thought Ron and Harry were the best of friends. </p>
<p>“When he found out something about me, he didn’t like it. He is the reason I spent three weeks in the infirmary in fifth year. He beat me up so bad almost every bone in my body was broken, and I was bruised everywhere. So, I reported him to the Ministry for abuse and wrongful use of magic. He was sentenced with five years because of what he did to me.” </p>
<p>“But you are not allowed to be gay Harry! Something like that is just wrong, you were supposed to marry my sister and become a real Weasley! Just the way Dumbledore promised me before we met in the train.” Ron was furious, Harry only rolled his eyes. Al the while Draco was sitting there taking it all in. </p>
<p>“I still can’t believe that you are stuck on the fact that I won’t marry your sister and become a Weasley. I’ve never expressed any feelings towards Ginevra or any girl for that matter. It’s all been one sided, from you! And the thing with Dumbledore is just wrong, he can’t promise me to someone.” As Harry said that, Ron took a hold of Draco’s chains and pulled them towards Draco. Causing pain to burst into Harry’s body. Draco didn’t know what to do, he sat there in silence and watched as Harry was in immense pain. Ron was laughing at the sight of Harry winching in pain from his arms being pulled away from his body. </p>
<p>“Listen to me Harry and listen carefully! You are under my control here and you won’t talk back to me again. And I will get you to marry my sister!” Ron let go of the chains and Harry let out a big sigh in relief. Harry looked up at Ron and said nothing. He was not ready for that pain to erupt again. “Good boy, the Chosen One isn’t as dumb as someone might think from your grades at school.” </p>
<p>“…” Harry didn’t respond to that. </p>
<p>“Now let’s get to the fun part of this, Malfoy you get to sit there and watch your enemy in pain. Harry, prepare yourself for even more pain.” Ron took out his wand and cased a few spells. The room changed from a dark cell to a room full of torture tools. Harry was hanging from the ceiling, chains around his wrists and head looking down. He wasn’t far above the ground, but he wasn’t touching the ground. And his clothes were gone, he was only in his boxers. Draco was sitting on a chair, but he was tied down as well. His hands and legs were tied to the chair, forcing him to sit still. He still had his clothes, something he was happy about. Ron was standing next to the tools that would be used for torture, he was standing there with a creepy smile. Draco was scared for Harry and what was about to happen. </p>
<p>“Are you ready Harry?” Ron looked up at Harry, Harry didn’t say or do anything other than close his eyes. “You are a fast learner Harry, I never thought I’d see the stubborn Chosen One submit to someone.” Ron walked over to Harry with a whip in his hand. Ready to cause serious harm. Ron whipped Harry on his back, hard. He repeated the act over and over. Harry was trying his best to not speak out his anger and pain, so he was moving a little and showing he was in pain. Draco wanted to call out for Ron to stop, but he was afraid he would get the same punishment. So, he just sat there taking in the pain on Harry’s face. The torture went on for hours, Ron changes his tool from time to time. After a while Ron saw that Harry was about to faint, he stopped. Then he took out his wand again and placed Harry on the ground, making sure he was laying on his biggest wounds. Ron took of Draco’s restraints and gave him a first aid kit. Hinting that he was supposed to help Harry. Ron walked out of the room with a creepy smile. Draco ran over to Harry, whom was unable to move his hands and legs because of new chains placed there by Ron. </p>
<p>“Can you see and hear me Potter?” Draco said as he kneeled down beside Harry’s face. </p>
<p>“Yeah I can.” Harry said, clearly in pain. </p>
<p>“I’m going to clean and patch up your wounds, okay.” </p>
<p>“No! Don’t touch me!” Harry screamed at him. </p>
<p>“I’m not going to hurt you Potter, I’m going to help you by cleaning your wounds. If I don’t clean them, you will die.” </p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Draco opened the first aid kit and took out some rubbing alcohol to clean the wounds. He put the alcohol on a cloth and moved it closer to a wound on Harry’s chest. Draco was about to place the cloth on the wound when Harry pulled away. </p>
<p>“Potter, I told you I wasn’t going to hurt you.” </p>
<p>“I know, but my body reacted that way. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Okay, at least you aren’t afraid that I will hurt you. I’m going to place this on your wound on three, okay?” </p>
<p>“Okay.” Harry took in a deep breath and sighed. </p>
<p>“One.”</p>
<p>“Two” Draco placed the cloth on Harry’s wound and Harry screamed in pain. “Sorry I had to do it this way or I would never be able to clean your wounds.” Draco continued to clean the wound he had placed the cloth on. </p>
<p>“I know, otherwise my body would have pulled away at three. But I don’t think it will work the next time though.” </p>
<p>“Once I have the cloth on you Potter, I won’t have to take it off. That way I won’t have to force my way to touch you. And I’m sorry I couldn’t do anything when Weasel was torturing you.” </p>
<p>“It’s okay, and I wouldn’t want you to hurt yourself because of saying something. You being here helped me a little, if I was alone, I would have given up hours ago. But since you are here, I can’t have you die here because of my awful choice of friends.” </p>
<p>“You are saying you held out for hours because of me?” </p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ve already killed to many people. And I don’t think I could live with myself if I let another person die because I couldn’t take a little torture.” </p>
<p>“That isn’t healthy Potter.”</p>
<p>“I know. But I’m struggling as it is with everything that has happened to me. Ron only befriended me because of Dumbledore and then Hermione left for Australia with her family. Leaving me alone to deal with my demons. And now Ron is torturing me because I sent him to Azkaban. And of course, I had to drag you into all of this.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but do you at least still have contact Hermione, right?” Draco said as he continued to clean Harry’s wounds. </p>
<p>“Yeah, I do still have little contact with her, but it’s very little. And thanks for helping me like this. I thought you would want to leave me to die in agony.”</p>
<p>“I might not like you too much, but I can’t live with the fact that I could have helped but decided our rivalry was far more important.” </p>
<p>“And thanks for distracting me from the pain of the alcohol cleaning my wounds.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing, I had to do it since we don’t have our wands and I can’t to wandless spells.”</p>
<p>“Malfoy?”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Could you help me sit up? I can’t seem to do so in my current situation.”</p>
<p>“Of course. And I seem to have covered every wound of yours.”</p>
<p>“Thank you again. Really.”</p>
<p>Draco stood up to place the bloody cloth on the table. He walked back to Harry to help him sit up. It took a little out of him to lift the guy up. Draco was strong but Harry had so much muscles he was heavier than he thought. Draco eventually managed to lift him into a sitting position against the wall. </p>
<p>“Thanks. Not to sound selfish or anything, but I’m glad you were kidnapped with me. I don’t’ think I would have survived here alone.” Harry was exhausted, and clearly in pain. But he still put a little smile on his face. </p>
<p>“Potter, you need to sleep because you are exhausted out of your mind.” </p>
<p>“I can’t thank you enough Malfoy.” Harry said as his eyes closed, and he fell into a deep sleep. Draco saw that he was about to fall down, on one of his biggest wounds. He sat down next to him and forced his head down on his shoulder. That way he wouldn’t have to clean his wounds again. Draco let Harry sleep on his shoulder until Ron came back in.</p>
<p>“The Chosen One couldn’t handle the little session and fell asleep.” Ron laughed. </p>
<p>“He was exhausted from his body working overtime trying to clean and close all of his wounds.” </p>
<p>“Wake him up!” </p>
<p>Draco didn’t want to do it, but he couldn’t have Harry being punished even more than he will be. He gently shook Harry and he slowly opened his eyes. </p>
<p>“Nice of you to wake up.” Ron said. </p>
<p>Draco gently helped Harry up to a sitting position again, then looked at him with a sorry face. Harry gave a small smile and a nod, to indicate that it was okay. </p>
<p>“Are you ready for more Chosen One?” </p>
<p>“…” Harry didn’t respond to it, he couldn’t be bothered. </p>
<p>“Good boy let’s get started. And Malfoy you can go back to the chair and sit there.”</p>
