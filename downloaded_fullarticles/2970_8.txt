          <div class="userstuff"><p>[Dracos solo song]</p><p>(Talking about when the room of requriements exploded)<br/>
Folks, we finally got our headline<br/>
"Students Crushed as death eaters Attack"<br/>
Crab and and goyle calling me<br/>
Poor crab and goyle were just too damn slow</p><p>(Talking about the war)<br/>
Guys are fightin', bleedin', fallin'<br/>
Thanks to good ole' draco malfoy<br/>
Draco just wants to close his eyes and GO!</p><p>(He wants to go far away to rethink his life)<br/>
Let me go<br/>
Far away<br/>
Somewhere they won't ever find me, and tomorrow won't remind me of today<br/>
And the city's finally sleepin'<br/>
And the moon looks old and grey<br/>
I get on a train thats bound for far away</p><p>(Talking about all hes done, and stuff done to him)<br/>
And I'm gone<br/>
And I'm done<br/>
No more running. No more lying<br/>
No more fat old man denying me my way<br/>
Just a moon so big and yellow, it turns night right into day<br/>
Dreams come true. Yeah they do. Far away</p><p>(Talking about hogwarts/the wizarding world)<br/>
Where does it say you gotta live and die here?<br/>
Where does it say a guy can't catch a break?<br/>
Why should you only take what you're given?<br/>
Why should you spend your whole life living trapped where there ain't no future<br/>
Even at 17!<br/>
Breaking your back for someone else's sake!<br/>
If the life don't seem to suit you, how about a change of scene?<br/>
Far from the lousy houses, and the deadlines in between</p><p>(Remembering snape now and telling himself he will change)<br/>
Far away, my old friend<br/>
I can't spend my whole life dreaming<br/>
Though I know thats all I seem inclined to do<br/>
I ain't getting any younger<br/>
And I wanna start brand new</p><p>(Talking about the people who will be far away)<br/>
I need space. And fresh air<br/>
Let 'em laugh in my face. I don't care<br/>
Save my place- I'll be there<br/>
Just be real is all I'm asking<br/>
Not some painting in my head<br/>
Cause I'm dead if I can't count on you today<br/>
I got nothing if I'm not far away.</p></div>
