  <em>Hate me today</em><br/>
<em>Hate me tomorrow</em><br/>
<em>Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Hate me in ways</em><br/>
<em>Yeah, ways hard to swallow</em><br/>
<em>Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you</em>

<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And he was standing there. Casually sipping his alcohol-free drink and with boyish charm making conversation with most important wizards around the world.</p><p>Draco took another deep breath and blinked hard. Maybe it’s just a dream. How can he be here? How can he…</p><p>One, two, three…</p><p>Potter chose this exact moment to catch him staring. He looked surprised, or at least that what Draco thought he saw on his face, but in second Potter’s face change to that poster-boy official polite smile. Then he turned away not even slightly affected by Draco’s presence.</p><p>THE HELL?</p><p>Forty-four…</p><p>Fuck - counting, years of therapy and all the checks his therapist stole from him. It’s not working.</p><p>It never would. Not with Har…Potter.</p><p>Draco took in how fit and healthy he looked. Way better than the almost corpse he left behind all those years before. He looked good. He looked too good without Draco in his life.</p><p>It’s not like cares.</p><p>Because he moved on long ago.</p><p>Still It hurts.</p><p>Draco could easily identify the growing pain in his chest. Pain with the roots in his heart that never truly went away, but was silent in the past year. Right when he finally was starting to build up his life, Potter needed to come back just to show him how wrong he was. How his mere presence made him come back to that teenage broken boy. Boy who loved him. Boy he was no longer certain was  gone.</p><p>He heard Potter’s laugh at some stupid ministry joke.</p><p>How could he come back?</p><p>How could he ignore him like that?</p><p>How he got better?</p><p>Is he with someb…</p><p>Hell with this. Draco turned on his heels. He was done here. Charity, no charity, he couldn’t spend another second being so close to Ha-Potter. He rubbed on his wrist as he came to feel familiar scar.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“I hate you!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No, you don’t.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You don’t have a fucking right to tell me…”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Hate me, like you mean it Draco. Hate me…”</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With the last memory surfacing in his mind he Disapparated from the event. He completely missed green eyes burning with emotions.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p>He didn’t really know where to go. He didn’t want to come back to his empty flat nor going back to the Manor, mother would never let it go. She still couldn’t forgive herself for pushing him into Potter’s arms and convincing him time and time again that it will get better. With cracked smile Draco chose to sit at the bench near the river. Old place, old troubles. How many times he sat in the exact same spot thinking he couldn’t possibly screw his life worse. Funny thing each time he was proven wrong. And how many times he remembered warm arms wrapping around his shoulder and soft voice whispering it’s going to be alright.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>He should have known better.</p><p>Nothing lasts.</p><p>Just his mistakes. He never did any good,  no choice was truly his – that was his old excuse, now he knew he had those choices and he never was strong enough to make good one.</p><p>Once he thought he finally figured it out, that he was making finally good decisions, afterall he was trying to save hero of the wizarding world. How did it ended?</p><p>Like it always does, with scars and broken heart.</p><p>“Moon looks happy.”</p><p>With surprise Draco turned around to spot Luna Lovegood not far away walking towards him. She was strange, probably not really sane, but deep inside he was brave enough to admit he found comfort in her company.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Draco asked out of duty, partly curiosity. It way past midnight. And no matter how shitty, he was her friend. Or at least after everything they went through he wanted to call her that.</p><p>“Speaking with you.” She answered sitting next to him with stretched out legs. Moon played gently on her hair laminating it in silver and gold.</p><p>“Couldn’t guess.” Snapped Draco. Oh god sometimes she was pissing him off with her habit of stating obvious.</p><p>“I was at home, when I felt someone miserable was looking for company. It appears it was you.” She wasn’t even mad about his remark, just well being herself – warm and oblivious to the harsh reality. She was his walking hope that there was still something innocent in the world.</p><p>“I’m not miserable!” Draco snapped, but even to his own ears it sounded weak.</p><p>“Then I guess I will look for someone else.” She made a move to get up.</p><p>“No, wait.” He murmured. He was so damn awkward when it comes to asking for anything, even company. He cought her sparkling eyes and turned away. She could read him so well.</p><p>“It’s about Harry.” He broke the silence.</p><p>“Couldn’t guess.” She stated it with complitly still face, but draco could swear she was serving him back.</p><p>“I saw him tonight. After all those years and I...” he stopped as not knowing what to tell.</p><p>“He’s doing fine.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know.” He really tried not to sound bitter, but…</p><p>“I’m not blaming you. No one is.” She put gentle hand on his shoulder. He couldn’t escape the comparission with different, stronger arms and somehow felt the cold of the night causing him to shiver.</p><p>“Weasley has different view on that.”</p><p>“He used to, but not anymore. Harry too…”</p><p>“Don’t. Let’s just not.” Draco shook away her arm as it was too much burden to hold on to.</p><p>“What you did back then, how you ended things, you did it for him.”</p><p>“I did it for myself.”</p><p>“You loved him.”</p><p>“I broke him.” And broke myself along with it. Or maybe broken was just his state from the birth.</p><p>“You chose the hardest way.” Luna said calmly not trying to convince him, just stating her thoughts. It was good. It was all too bad, hitting home time and time again.</p><p>“I gave up too soon.” Draco whispered finally letting the thought that was eating him for so long out. He screwed everything. If he only was a little stronger…</p><p>“You did something no one of us had courage to do.” She was gazing at the moon. For the first time in the very long time he heard regret in her voice. Was she pitting him or regretting it wasn’t her there that night? But it was always him in the shittiest places at the shittiest time. It was his true talent.</p><p>“Yeah, and it turned out so well.” Sarcasm couln’t escape his tone.</p><p>“You can try again.” Gryffindors. Really thinking everything would turned out fine if only they say so.</p><p>“Sure, I should just patted his arm and sing-song to his ear “Potter let’s go back to shagging like we used to cos you are now sober and I won’t put anymore knives in your back. And as a token of our everlasting love look at all those beautiful scars. Btw I almost killed you, but I didn’t really mean to. You’re welcome.”</p><p>“Draco…”</p><p>“I’m done. We’re done. There’s nothing to come back to. Goodnight.”</p><p>He Apparated at his flat and threw himself on the couch. He was too tired.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“You must really hate me Harry.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m not. You know I love you.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No, you don’t. If you do, how could you do this to me?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
