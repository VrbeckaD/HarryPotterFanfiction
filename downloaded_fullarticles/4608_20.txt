  <strong>'Boy Who Lived... No Longer Living?'</strong>
</p><p>That's right, folks. Harry Potter: Boy Who Lived, Saviour, Defeater of You-Know-Who, may very well be dead!</p><p>The news came as a shock to us all at the Daily Prophet when only yesterday, a source inside the ministry claimed that Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, had declared young Mr Potter missing from his home after his Hogwarts acceptance letter got sent back.</p><p>You all know the story of Harry Potter, the boy who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at just one years old with the terrible cost of both his parents lives. According to my source, Headmaster Dumbledore had immediately taken the boy and placed him into his only other living relatives care, Lily Potter n√©e Evans sister, Petunia Dursley. And that is where he remained... Until now.</p><p>The Minister has made no official statement on whether the Boy Who Lived's whereabouts are known to him or not, but once again, my source came through. The Minister has no idea whatsoever as to where Harry Potter currently is, but plans on bringing the Dursley's in front of Wizengamot court to be tried under truth serum.</p>

  <strong>'Boy Who Lived under the stairs?'</strong>
</p><p>So it would seem.</p><p>Earlier on this week the Dursley-Potter trial commenced, which each member of the Dursley family being put under veritaserum and questioned about Harry Potter's whereabouts. And though they regretfully did not have the answer, a few other little facts came to light instead.</p><p>Harry Potter, a hero amongst all wizards, is nothing but a 'freak' in the muggle world.</p><p>According to his uncle-in-law, that is.</p><p>Vernon Dursley was the first to be questioned four days ago, and had to be restrained throughout the proceedings, and dragged out of the court room when he finished, letting lose an expressive list of words that would put even 'm**blood' to shame.</p><p>It would appear he is not the most believing of men, and hates anything to do with magic.</p><p>What makes matters worse, was that not only did the man plead guilty to keeping the child locked in a cupboard under the stairs, but also admits to abusing his nephew at least three times a week, assaults ranging from punches and kicks to scalding his arms with boiling water.</p><p>Our saviour, growing up in an unaccepting and abusive household?</p><p>It's no wonder he ran away!</p><p>Or so the Dursley's say, for according to all three of them, one day they woke up and Harry Potter had simply gone.</p><p>Now there's no need to panic just yet, as both Minister Shacklebolt and Headmaster Dumbledore have assured us that there's no way the remains of You-Know-Who's followers could have gotten Mr Potter, as the wards on the Dursley house had prevented that.</p><p>But it still remains a mystery as to where the Boy Who Lived disappeared to at just 10 years of age, or perhaps the more important question, where is our saviour now?</p>
<hr/><p>'<strong>Boy Who Lived presumed dead'</strong></p><p>And there you have it folks.</p><p>After two and a half years of looking for Harry Potter, the Minister calls off the search.</p><p>For almost three years, this world's best detectives, both wizard and muggle alike, have scoured the earth searching for our Saviour, but to no avail.</p><p>After the boy vanished at 10 years old, and the realisation of his disappearance less than a year later, the entire planet has been searching for him, from Saudi Arabia to South Africa, Mexico to Malaysia, Iceland to India, with no results.</p><p>Many believe the Boy Who Lived to be dead, and finally, after more than 30 months searching, Minister Shacklebolt has declared it.</p><p>Harry Potter is Dead.</p>
