          <div class="userstuff"><p>It was many and many a year ago,<br/>In a castle under siege,<br/>That a wizard there fought whom you may know<br/>By the name of Fred Weasley.<br/>This wizard he fought without knowledge or thought<br/>That he was being watched over by me.</p>
<p>I was a reader and he was a character,<br/>In this castle under siege<br/>But I loved him with a love that was more than love,<br/>My favourite, Fred Weasley.<br/>With a love that the omniscient author above,<br/>Knew must end brutally.</p>
<p>And this was the reason that, years ago,<br/>In this castle under siege,<br/>A spell blasted through a ruined wall, hitting<br/>My beloved Fred Weasley;<br/>So that his crying kinsmen came,<br/>And hid him away from me,<br/>To lay him in the hall of dead,<br/>In this castle under siege.</p>
<p>The author, hunched over a writing desk, <br/>Knew how cliché a happy ending would be—<br/>Yes! — that was the reason (as all readers know, <br/>About this castle under siege)<br/>That the spell shot from the ruined wall that night,<br/>Hitting and killing my Fred Weasley.</p>
<p>Alas my love it was stronger by far than the love<br/>Of those less well-read than me—<br/>Of those less obsessed than me—<br/>And neither the omniscient author above,<br/>Nor the fandom mourning in disbelief<br/>Could ever convince me to fully accept<br/>The death of Fred Weasley.</p>
<p>For he lives on in my mind, with every story I find<br/>About my Fred Weasley;<br/>Each time I re-read the whole book series,<br/>I remember my Fred Weasley.<br/>And so, I force my mind to forget that he died,<br/>So my favourite — my favourite — is very much alive.<br/>In the books there which I still read<br/>In stories I will always read.</p></div>
