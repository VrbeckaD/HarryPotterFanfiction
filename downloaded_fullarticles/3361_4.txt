    <p>Mister and Misses Masters were a perfectly normal couple who lived in a perfectly normal town. Their garden was filled with perfectly normal plants, and if you asked them what they liked to grow, they would hem and haw before telling you that, well, they didn’t grow much of anything!</p>
<p>And anyone who lives in their delightfully pleasant and normal town would nod their head and be content in the knowledge that they’re not the only person in the town who perhaps lacks a green thumb, and move on to talking about the weather, and the new episode of whichever show was popular, and not ever, ever talk about the boy who lives under the Masters roof.</p>
<p>Because, you see, the Masters had a little secret that they couldn’t let the town find out about. They had a unusual and strange young boy living under the roof of their suburban home that was truly anything but perfect, and he certainly wasn’t normal!</p>
<p>Because you see the child living under their roof didn’t act like a child should. Instead of going out to play with the neighborhood children he would sit inside and poke at the toaster until it launched bread in a most abnormal way, or until it exploded all over the Masters lovely and perfect kitchen.</p>
<p>So one day the Masters decided that it would perhaps be best if they sent this strange boy on a playdate with a lovely spectacled girl who just so happened to live next door.</p>
<p>So when the boy returned with singed clothes, a twitching body, and tears in his eyes, the Masters could only sigh and pull him inside.</p>
<p>Of course, they couldn’t have known that the girl was just as odd as the boy, and they certainly would never have sent the boy over if they had known that this incident would only make the boy even stranger.</p>
<p>But regardless of the reason, by the time school started, the Masters has decided to stow the boy away inside their normal and perfect house, and make sure that he couldn’t damage their perfectly normal reputation. They left him alone to his toasters and batteries, and he never bothered them again.</p>
<p>Now of course that is what would’ve happened if Noam hadn’t received a letter on the day of his 11th birthday. Because that day was truly where it all began.</p>
