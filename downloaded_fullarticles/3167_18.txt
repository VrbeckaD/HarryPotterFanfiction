  <b>The Truce</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry laid the round of drinks on the table and folded his arms, looking down at Hermione, Ginny and Ron like the Prefect he never was. ‘Right, now remember everyone. This is a truce. He’s still Malfoy but I’m working with him 24/7 now, so if you could just try to be civil it’d make things a lot easier.’</p><p>‘Oh Harry relax. Come on down from your high horse.’ Ginny pulled him down next to her.</p><p>‘I’m sure we can all be civil.’ Hermione nodded, trying to hide her misgivings. <em> This is going to be a bloody weird evening. Trust Harry to think he can just will everyone together and fix it. Classic. </em></p><p>‘I can’t believe you’re making us have a drink with that ferret<em>.</em>’ Ron grimaced, speaking for all three of them. ‘How is it possible that your judgement at 11 years old was better than your judgement right now?’</p><p>Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and put on his best Senior Auror voice. ‘Ron. We’re all older and wiser now. No one will be calling anyone names, understood?’</p><p>‘I won’t if he doesn’t.’ Ron shrugged.</p><p>‘We know this is important to you Harry, so obviously we’ll <em> all </em>behave.’ Hermione kicked Ron under the table.</p><p>‘<em>Thank you </em>Hermione. It is actually pretty important to me. We’ve spent quite a lot time working on this case in Romania, and I know none of you believe me but he’s.. Not as bad as he used to be. So just, don’t make things awkward.’</p><p>‘There <em> is </em> such a thing as being too bloody friendly.’ Ron muttered.</p><p>Ginny rolled her eyes. ‘Oh for Salazar’s sake both of you. It’s one drink. I’m sure we’ll all survive.’</p><p>Hermione tried not to think of the 101 reasons why this was incredibly likely to go wrong, and plastered a smile across her face. ‘Ginny’s right, relax. We’re all adults here.’</p><p>Harry, Ron and Gin took in her expression and all laughed.</p><p>‘You’ve always been a terrible liar.’ Harry said, adjusting his glasses.</p><p>
  <em> Yep this is going to be a bloody weird evening.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>It had been a bloody weird few weeks actually, ever since Harry had gathered them all in the sitting room at Grimmauld Place and told them with a grim expression that the Ministry had finally stopped pussy-footing around and his long-awaited Auror partner had finally been recruited.</p><p><em> Draco Malfoy</em>.</p><p>Hermione, Ginny and Ron had sat and gaped in disbelief, staying pretty much the same way in the weeks that followed. Harry seemed to take it surprisingly well, shrugging and saying sometimes you were thrown into things with people you might not choose but you still had to get the job done.</p><p>They were all worried. As the one living with him, Hermione spent a lot of time at breakfast and in the evenings when they were sat watching a film trying to coax him into his old ways - <em> come on Harry, let’s just hatch a plan and fix it. </em>But this time he wouldn’t be drawn into approaching this like something he needed to fix. He’d taken to rolling his eyes, telling her it wasn’t worth the effort, then sloping off to make more tea.</p><p>It was beyond bizarre.</p><p>He’d spent all of sixth year obsessing about just how evil Malfoy was, not to think of all their enmity in the preceding five years, and now he was going to be working alongside him and he just didn’t care?! Hermione knew they’d all grown up but it just wasn’t in Harry’s nature to be calmly accepting of a situation. She’d spent <em> years </em> trying to instil some sense of respect for authority into him and it had literally never taken hold.  </p><p>Except for now? She wasn’t buying it, something was going on. It didn’t sound like he’d even tried to negotiate with Kingsley and get Malfoy palmed off on someone else. She’d tried to talk to him about it at dinner a couple of times before his new partner started but he’d brushed it off, parroting the talk of forgiveness and unity she had spent their final year of Hogwarts banging into the younger years after the war. It was weird.</p><p>Now after almost a month of working together, Harry was saying that actually maybe Malfoy wasn’t as bad as he used to be and maybe they should give him a chance.</p><p><em> What a load of bollocks. </em>Hermione couldn’t believe it and she knew the others felt the same. None of them were happy with Malfoy being his partner in the field - Hermione had even tried asking for a transfer so she could cover the spot, but she’d been told in no uncertain terms that she would need 6 months intensive training they weren’t in a position to offer and if she moved departments now, all of the work she’d done on the House Elf Rights and Regulations Bill would be for nothing, as it ‘wasn’t a department priority, let alone a Ministry priority’. The Ministry did have a particularly special way of making your work feel valued.</p><p>As soon as Harry got wind of her plan, he’d made her promise not to try moving.</p><p>‘Things are alright. I mean, don’t get me wrong I’d love to work with you Hermione, but being an Auror has never been something you’ve wanted to do. And if Malfoy’s going to do something I don’t think you’ll be in a position to help whilst you’re in training and we’re both out in the field. And even if you could just transfer over automatically, you can’t stop now with the bill, it’s just the last few hurdles now isn’t it? The last few posho heads to bash together? I won’t let you give up on it! And anyway, I think things are going to be okay with Malfoy. He’s a pretty impressive wizard, when he’s actually working and not telling people about how he’s a pretty impressive wizard.’</p><p>That didn’t make her feel any better. Harry didn’t have a great track record for reading people, or for self-protection.</p><p>She had tried to persuade herself that Malfoy must’ve changed, to even be allowed through the Ministry doors. He couldn’t still be the same pointy faced mean little ferret that had terrorised her school years, or the awful twisted teenage pawn of the Dark Lord. Could he? She had seen him around the Ministry on and off over the last few years, after his early release from Azkaban. She wasn’t sure what he had actually been <em> doing </em> - it didn’t seem anyone knew, although the <em> Daily Prophet </em> obviously had its own lurid suspicions. They hadn’t really needed to cross paths so it had been pretty easy to avoid him, she didn’t have time to waste on Draco Malfoy.</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Until now apparently. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Harry clearly wasn’t sure he’d impressed the nature of the evening upon them. ‘I mean, he’s still an arrogant supercilious bastard but in some ways he does seem to have changed for the better. And I think we should try to give him a chance.’  </p><p>‘Who’s an arrogant supercilious bastard Potter?’ Malfoy seemed to have come out of the shadows from nowhere, and stood smirking at Harry’s elbow. Everyone around the table jumped guiltily.</p><p>‘Well, you.’ Harry said, frankly. ‘I’ve got you a drink. Obviously no need for introductions.’ He motioned around the table with a slightly abashed smile.</p><p>Malfoy seemed to consider him for a long minute, then he smiled. <em> He smiled. </em> A perfectly standard smile. Not a sneer. <em> Malfoy is capable of smiling. Who knew? </em></p><p>‘I won’t take arrogance or bastard - it’s not arrogance if it’s well-founded, and for all their flaws my parents were sticklers for marital tradition. But you can probably have supercilious. Thanks for the drink. Good evening Weasel. Weaslette. Granger.’ He gave each of them a nod and sat down.</p><p>‘Ferret.’ Ron matched his nod. Harry’s mouth twitched.</p><p>Hermione watched Malfoy sit, intrigued. When was the last time she’d seen him this up close? Maybe in potions when they were 16? He looked similar, but there was something that was different about him. Still the lean build of a Seeker with that shock of platinum hair but, what was it?</p><p>Less nervous anger. He had been wired with that at school. Now he seemed more at ease with himself - and if the rumours were true he was apparently not only silver-haired these days but silver-tongued too, his obnoxious goading teenage conversational style having matured into something fluid and smooth.</p><p>
  <em> If you were looking at him objectively, you could say he’s looking good. Attractive even. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> What am I thinking?! It is bloody impossible to look at Malfoy objectively. </em>
</p><p><em> Is he a Legilimens? </em> She felt her face heat as their eyes met and she looked away and picked up her pint.</p><p>‘Malfoy. How did you wheedle your way into the Aurors?’ Ginny asked bluntly.</p><p>‘Ginny.’ Harry muttered.</p><p>‘I don’t wheedle.’ Malfoy said evenly.</p><p>‘Bollocks!’ Ginny said. ‘You’re as wheedly as they come-’</p><p>Harry was looking pleadingly at Hermione, so she cut in quickly.</p><p>‘How have you been Malfoy?’</p><p>‘Fine thanks Granger. You? Freed all the house elves yet?’</p><p>Oh trust him to get straight to the thing she was feeling most sensitive about.</p><p>‘Not yet. You see there are these Pureblood families who seem to take great delight in making things difficult.’ She said tersely.</p><p>She was surprised he had the decency to look apologetic. ‘Ah, yes. I’ve been following your white paper’s progress and saw you’d hit some, er snags. I’m sorry, must be frustrating.’</p><p>Hermione stared at him in shock, saying nothing. <em> Was that empathy from Malfoy? </em></p><p>He smirked at her silence, clearly pleased to have surprised her. She bristled at the familiar smirk, so self-satisfied. <em> Not a totally reformed character then. </em></p><p>He took a sip of the firewhiskey Harry had brought him and grimaced. ‘What the hell is this Potter? Paint stripper? Tastes awful.’</p><p>
  <em> Definitely not a totally reformed character. </em>
</p><p>‘I thought you were supposed to be charming these days Malfoy. A true gent.’ Ginny said pointedly.</p><p>‘Yes that was rude of me. But it was also honest. Seriously Potter, this is burning my throat.’</p><p>‘I think that’s just what firewhiskey does Malfoy.’ Harry said with gritted teeth. This was not going well. ‘Maybe we should do something, make this less intense. How about a game?’</p><p>‘A game?’ Malfoy and Hermione echoed incredulously. He caught her eye and grinned at their united dismay. She sat once more staring in shock at him. The Malfoy she knew did not smile at sharing sentiments with <em> Mudbloods</em>.</p><p>‘You do realise what you’re letting yourself in for here-’ Ron began, motioning to his sister.    </p><p>‘Oh,  I know!’ On cue Ginny leant forwards, cutting in. ‘Let’s play Never Have I Ever!’</p><p>‘What. Ginny <em> no </em>. We’re not 13.’ Hermione frowned.</p><p>‘Never Ever What?’ Ron asked.</p><p>‘It’s a Muggle game. You go round in the circle and say ‘never have I ever’ then something you’ve never done, and if anyone else has done it, they have to drink. For example, I might say never have I ever got with anyone in the Room of Requirement, and Harry would have to drink.’ Ginny smiled. Harry rolled his eyes.</p><p>‘Seems pretty straightforward. I’m sure even you will start to pick it up as we go along Weasel.’ Malfoy said, leaning back to avoid the light punch Harry went to land on his arm.</p><p>‘Why is that people brought up by Muggles always fall back on physical violence?’ He muttered.</p><p>‘This is a truce remember Malfoy?’ Harry said meaningfully. <em> Ah, so Malfoy got a pep talk as well. </em></p><p>Hermione pulled a face. ‘This is lame.’</p><p>‘This is enforced fun.’ Ginny said cheerily. ‘Besides, if Malfoy is going to be out in the field watching Harry’s back, I want to know all I can about what he’s been up to.’</p><p>‘Thanks.’ Malfoy said drily.</p><p>Ginny smiled brightly at everyone. ‘I’ll start us off. Never have I ever been to Azkaban.’</p><p>Malfoy sighed and took a sip of his firewhiskey. ‘I see how this is going to be.’</p><p>The truce clearly wasn’t going as planned. Harry winced and tried to throw him a bone.  ‘Never have I ever fallen off a broom.’</p><p>Ginny groaned at what she thought was a waste of a go. ‘Oh come on Harry, there’s no point doing one that no one’s-’</p><p>‘Granger? Really?’ She was interrupted by Malfoy crowing, as he glimpsed Hermione trying to drink as subtly as possible. <em> Oh fuck. </em>She flushed red, narrowed her eyes across the table and snapped, ‘It was one time.’</p><p>‘Sorry, I forgot..’ Harry said weakly.</p><p>Ginny was clapping her hands with delight. ‘See! This is fun! All this new stuff we’re going to learn about each other! Now come on Hermione, you have to tell us the story.’</p><p>‘Oh this<em> is </em> fun.’ Malfoy smirked.</p><p>‘There isn’t really a story.’ Hermione scowled. She was greeted with a chorus of pleas, and eventually crossed her arms and said as quickly as possible, ‘It was in our final year. Harry was trying to distract me from N.E.W.Ts - I don’t know why I even agreed to it, my head was all over the place that year. Okay?’</p><p>‘And?’ Ginny prompted. Harry was concentrating on his pint, trying not to smile.</p><p>‘A pigeon came out of nowhere, flew at my hair, and I fell off.’ Hermione snapped.</p><p>‘Was he trying to nest?’ Malfoy asked calmly, prompting Ron and Ginny to cackle. <em> Traitors. </em></p><p>‘Oh shut up Malfoy.’ She wasn’t sure he heard over Ron and Ginny.</p><p>When Ginny finally collected herself she motioned to Malfoy. ‘You next. And don’t forget we’re supposed to be finding out salacious stuff.’</p><p>‘Merlin you Gryffindors are ridiculous - just because you’re all so conspicuous about what you’re thinking, it doesn’t mean everyone else is. The whole point of a salacious secret is that you’re unlikely to confess to it in the open - for example during a drinking game. If you really want to find out the <em> salacious </em> stuff, I don’t think this is best method.’</p><p>‘This is a stupid game.’ Hermione tried to concede without sounding like she agreed.</p><p>‘It sounds to me like someone just can’t think of a good enough question.’ Ginny pressed.</p><p>‘I’m going to get the next round. Everyone on the same?’ Ron said, pushing his chair back to stand but Malfoy beat him to it:</p><p>‘Don’t worry Weasel. I’ll get the rest of the drinks tonight.’</p><p>‘Oh.’ Ron gave him a suspicious look. ‘That’s generous.’</p><p>‘Oh for Godric’s sake Ron, he’s not going to poison any drinks.’ Harry said.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. ‘Of course not. He’s doing it so he doesn’t have to drink any more of the firewhiskey that would be in our price range.’</p><p>Malfoy surprised her with a short laugh before leaving the table.</p><p>Harry flicked her arm. <em> ‘Hermione.’ </em></p><p>‘What?!’</p><p>‘How many times do I need to remind everyone that this is supposed to be a bloody truce?’</p><p>‘Sorry. I am trying. It’s just so hard when he looks the same.’ She pulled a face.</p><p>‘I don’t think he does. He’s much better looking now.’ Ginny offered.</p><p>‘What?’ Ron and Harry spluttered together.</p><p>Ginny shrugged. ‘He looks good! I mean, he always looked good - but all the evidence suggests he’s only going to get better with age.’</p><p>‘Like a fine wine?’ Hermione teased.</p><p>Ginny laughed. ‘Oh come on Hermione - that jawline!’</p><p>Harry and Ron both looked keen to interrogate Ginny further but Malfoy had re-appeared with 5 clean glasses and a bottle of firewhiskey that probably cost more than a month’s wages.</p><p>‘I wasn’t drinking firewhiskey.’ Hermione said quickly.</p><p>He smirked. ‘Rude. Trust me, this is better than the dishwater you were just drinking. It’s actually pretty good stuff because the malt-’  </p><p>‘I know it’s good firewhiskey. I just fancied ale tonight.. Nothing I love more than a mansplaining wizard.’ Hermione cut him off, rolling her eyes.</p><p>‘Mansplaining.’ Malfoy echoed. <em> Hah. Of course you don’t know what it is, you massive knob. </em></p><p>‘It’s a Muggle word.’ Ron told him, clearly delighted to know something he didn’t.</p><p>‘Which is ridiculous because it’s a pretty widespread phenomenon in the Wizarding world too.’ Hermione snapped.</p><p>Ginny nodded in agreement. ‘Bloody hell, the amount of time I’ve had wizards fucking <em> banging on </em>to me about Quidditch rules. Mate, I know, I spend 40 hours a week playing professionally.’</p><p>‘So it’s when a man explains something to a woman, and is being a condescending twat about it.’ Ron explained to Malfoy. ‘Probably every other thing that comes out of your mouth, Ferret.’</p><p>‘I rarely keep company that I have to explain things to.’ The blonde replied drily.</p><p>‘Is that because no one wants to be kept in your company, Ferret?’ Ron responded. Harry put his hands on either side of his temples and groaned. Before Malfoy had a chance to reply he cut in.</p><p>‘Hermione, are you happy to drink the firewhiskey that you don’t need explaining? Or shall we get you an ale?’</p><p><em> It does actually look like good firewhiskey. Maybe this isn’t my hill to die on. </em>‘Oh don’t worry, I’ll drink it. Thanks Malfoy.’</p><p>‘Well that was quick.’ The corners of Malfoy’s mouth twitched. ‘I distinctly remember how stubborn you were at school. Have you learnt the error of your ways then, Granger?’</p><p>‘No.’ Ron laughed. ‘She’s still just as bad.’</p><p>‘Me?! Pot - kettle - black!’ Hermione spluttered.</p><p>‘Oh you were all as bad as each other. Bloody Gryffindors.’ Malfoy said cheerfully.</p><p>‘Malfoy. Remember your audience.’ Harry muttered.</p><p>‘You know it does sometimes make me wonder that Hogwarts sorted us into houses so we would be closest to people with the same flaws. Like surely everyone would’ve been more well-rounded if we’d had to mix more?’ Ron mused.</p><p>‘We were all pretty tribal.’ Malfoy poured everyone a drink and slid each glass smoothly across the table to its recipient.</p><p>‘Maybe we wouldn’t have been at each other’s throats if we’d had to share a common room?’ Ron said thoughtfully, before pulling a face at the thought.</p><p>Malfoy matched his expression. ‘Not sure sharing a common room with you would’ve improved much of Hogwarts life Weasel, but I see what you mean. Maybe if they’d just sprinkled some Hufflepuffs here and there in the other houses we would’ve all got along better?’</p><p>Ron laughed. ‘Thank Merlin no Hufflepuffs were sent to the dungeons, poor sods - you would’ve eaten them alive!’</p><p><em> Is this actually happening? </em> Hermione glanced at Harry and Ginny and saw they were just as shocked as she was. <em> Ron and Malfoy. Talking without any wands drawn. Are they joking with each other?! </em></p><p>‘Oh I don’t know, Daphne Greengrass probably would’ve taken them under her wing.’</p><p>Ron gave a low whistle. ‘Daphne Greengrass, I’d forgotten about her. Do you see much of them from school?’</p><p>‘Not really. I don’t know if you’ve heard, but some people feel I’m a bit of a bad influence. I see a bit of Pansy, probably speak to Theo the most - Death Eater Dads, shared experiences etc etc.’ Malfoy smiled wryly.</p><p>‘I didn’t know you were even friends with him at school.’</p><p>‘I could say the same for you and Susan Bones.’</p><p><em> Are Malfoy and Ron actually about to discuss Ron’s love life?! What. The. Fuck. </em> Hermione sipped her firewhiskey, trying to work out what the hell was going on.</p><p>Ron went red. ‘I wasn’t really.’</p><p>‘Love came later?’ Malfoy asked sardonically.</p><p>‘Pretty much. Yes.’ Ron nodded.</p><p>Malfoy looked shocked at his honesty. ‘Bloody hell Weasel. I was expecting a bit more bluster.’</p><p>‘Well Ferret, looks like you don’t know me that well at all.’ Ron grinned.</p><p>‘So you’re all loved up with Susan Bones. And you two are still going strong.’ Malfoy nodded to Harry and Ginny. The end of his sentence hung in the air as he fixed Hermione with his grey eyes but said nothing.</p><p>
  <em> Oh fuck off Malfoy, my love life is none of your business. </em>
</p><p>Harry and Ron nodded, oblivious. Ginny, however, caught the tension in the air and narrowed her eyes at him. ‘What about you then Malfoy? Any witches waiting at home?’</p><p>He didn’t look at her, keeping his eyes on Hermione. ‘Oh no, I’m a quite unattached.’</p><p>
  <em> Why is he still staring? Fuck off Malfoy. </em>
</p><p>‘Quite unattached is a novel way of saying I’m a lonely wanker who still lives with my mum.’ Ron observed lightly. Malfoy finally took his gaze from Hermione to grimace at Ron.</p><p>‘What a poet you are, Weasel. I’ll have you know I don’t live at the Manor anymore. Just a flat. <em> Without </em>my mother.’</p><p>‘So just a lonely wanker.’ Ron said agreeably, leaning across Malfoy to fill everyone’s glasses.</p><p>
  <em> This is going to be a long night. </em>
