    <p>Nagini has little clear memory of the first few hours after they walk, following Mr Scamander and the man they call Dumbledore, across the bridge and through the gates of Hogwarts Castle. In a bizarre, ragged procession, they all pile into the Headmaster’s office, a beautiful room full of books with dozing magical portraits covering the walls. The tall, gleaming windows place only a thin sheet of enchanted glass between herself and the grey September sky, and untouched miles of bleak, vast moorland below it. She sinks onto a faded armchair while Mr Scamander, his elder brother, the woman Auror and the Ministry men all cluster together by the ornately carved desk, whispering with Dumbledore and a frail-looking, elderly wizard who must be the Headmaster. The Can’t-Spell, Mr Kowalski, draws up a chair beside her and just sits, staring at nothing, his face blank with tiredness and misery. Yusuf Kama produces a chair out of nothing with his wand, then sits apart from both groups. Like Mr Kowalski, he seems to be merely staring into space- but his face does not hold sadness as much as a kind of emptiness.<br/>She knows that expression like an old friend. Mostly from the age-spotted, unbreakable mirror in her cage at the circus, but also from Credence.<br/>Credence…<br/>She tries to stay awake, to listen to the conversation- her ears, more sensitive than normal people’s, catch odd words like Confederation and inquest- but she’s too far gone. Her eyes are heavy with exhaustion, her mind with the same numb grief she reads in Kama’s eyes. All sense of decorum forgotten, she kicks off her thin shoes and curls up on the armchair like a child, adjusting the blue overcoat (Kama hasn’t asked for it back) so it drapes over her like a blanket. It smells faintly like a public lavatory that hasn’t been cleaned for a while, but it’s soft and warm, and there’s something about its weight on her that makes her feel more secure, more safe. Within seconds, she is fast asleep.</p><p>“Uh… Miss? Excuse me-”<br/>She wakes slowly, the fog of sleep still thick around her eyes. Her limbs ache and there’s a dull, throbbing pain in her neck; she tries to move it and winces, massaging it. Not the best angle to sleep at, then. Blinking, she sits up to see Kowalski leaning towards her, his hand on the armrest and a look of concern in his large, brown eyes.<br/>“You ok?”<br/>She nods.<br/>“Sorry for waking you up like that, it’s just-” He jerks his head towards the others, grimacing slightly- and Nagini stiffens as she realises: they’re all looking at her. She shrinks backwards and away from them, her chest tightening. <br/>“What’s happening?” The panic rises in her like boiling water. Are the Aurors going to take her away? Are they going to lock her up because of Credence? Will she have to go back to Indonesia?<br/>He leans back, looking concerned. “Hey, don’t worry. These guys are just talking ‘bout what we’re gonna do now, ok?”<br/>She nods again, slowly. What we’re going to do could mean any number of things, after all.<br/>“Right, then.” The woman Auror- what did they call her, Tia? No, Tina- Miss Goldstein, the German one called her- swings her own chair close to Nagini’s. She tries to hold a reassuring smile on her face, but underneath she looks too tense, too sad for it to be real. The pretty woman who joined Grindelwald was her sister. Nagini heard her saying, not my sister, not my baby sister, sobbing into her hands; Scamander had briefly forgotten his dead friend to sit by her, trying to comfort her.<br/>But now, Miss Goldstein is doing the old favourite tactic of pushing her sadness down, locking it away. Getting on with the matter at hand: stand up, walk here, do this. Nagini is a master of that particular art.<br/>Miss Goldstein swallows. “Here’s the plan. Newt and Theseus-” she indicates the Scamander brothers- “have kindly offered the rest of us beds for the foreseeable future, at least until the Ministry’s done with us. Seeing as neither of their places are big enough for, uh-”<br/>She tries to do a quick head-count.<br/>“Six,” Yusuf Kama supplies, stirring a cup of night-black coffee. “Depending on whether or not you count the Niffler.”<br/>The furry, black mole-like creature pokes its head out of Newt Scamander’s coat, and nuzzles the air, hopefully.<br/>“Right. So, we- um, Newt and- uh, Theseus and I were thinking: if Theseus goes with Jacob and Yus- and Mr Kama, and Miss- I’m sorry, do you mind if I call you Nagini?<br/>Taken aback, Nagini manages a shrug followed by a hasty, embarrassed nod. <br/>“Thanks.” Another smile, real-looking this time. “Would you be ok if the two of us stayed at Newt’s house? It’ll be a bit of a squeeze, but if you don’t mind- would that be alright?”<br/>Nagini opens her mouth, but nothing comes out. She doesn’t… it doesn’t make sense…<br/>“It shouldn’t be too cramped, really,” Newt adds, misinterpreting her silence. “I don’t normally use the bedroom anyway, so…” He smiles, hopefully. Kindly.<br/>Finding the right words is suddenly about as easy as catching a pixie in a swarm of other pixies. Nagini struggles, for a few seconds, between “Yes”, “Ok”, “Thank you”, “Why are you being so nice”, “Stop making fun of me” and “Wait… if you don’t use the bedroom, where do you sleep?”- among others. But they all feel wrong, they’re hard and jagged and get stuck in her throat. A second later, she’s horrified to feel tears welling up in her eyes. Blinking them back, she manages- in a hoarse whisper (when did she last have a drink?)- “You… you want me to… come stay with you? At your house?”<br/>Newt looks breifly confused, before a mixture of sadness and realisation dawns on his face. His pale green eyes look into her dark ones. “Yes.” He looks away again, but his voice remains firm. “Yes, I do.”<br/>Something touches Nagini’s hand and she flinches- but it’s only Miss Goldstein, her face full of concern. Nagini pulls away.<br/>“Hang on a minute.” The Scottish Auror starts forward, drawing himself up. Again, Nagini shrinks in on herself. “Let’s just have a look at the facts before we start forming welcoming committees, shall we?” The others remain silent. “Look, I’m more than aware of your… reputation, Miss Goldstein, and Merlin knows Scamander has a habit of taking home strays, but I’m afraid that’s not how these things work. Mr Kowalski, Monsieur Kama and this… young woman will need to return to the Ministry with-”<br/>“Says who?” Miss Goldstein has twisted around to glare at him, her face reddening. At the same moment Dumbledore says, more mildly, “And that would be on… what grounds exactly, Torquil?”<br/>The man glares at him, flushed but defiant. “You’re no fool, Dumbledore, so don’t waste my time. For one thing, the Muggle isn’t even supposed to be here-”<br/>“The Muggle’s got a name, pal,” muttered Kowalski, a sudden coldness on his face.<br/>“- and I’m sure MACUSA will be very interested in his association with two of its employees, one of whom is now a known associate of a terrorist- and you can wait your turn, Miss Goldstein; there are plenty of questions about your sister I’ll be wanting you to answer, t-“<br/>Miss Goldstein leaps to her feet, her fists clenched and eyes flashing. “Don’t talk like you know one thing about her. Don’t you dare. And as for Jacob, Mr Travers, you know perfectly well MACUSA’s only got the right to obliviate No-Majes on U.S. soil. As long as Jacob’s in Europe, he’s not under our jurisdiction and he’s certainly not under mine.”<br/>“And his acquaintance with Theseus’ brother is grounds to exempt him from Obliviation while he resides here, assuming Newt is willing to vouch for him,” Dumbledore adds, pleasantly.<br/>Travers looks momentarily stumped, but ploughs on: “That may be so, but anyone whom that girl’s been in contact with will have to be investigated. As for those two-” His harsh eyes shift between her and Kama, before he turns to Theseus. “I want to know exactly what he was doing in that cemetery- and in Paris, for that matter. Oh, and I’d be interested to know how he’s become so friendly with your brother.”<br/>“I wouldn’t call our relations friendly,” Kama interrupts, his tone icy, “but the first one is simple enough: I live there. In Paris, that is, not the cem-”<br/>“Quiet,” Travers snaps. “As for her-” Nagini’s stomach contracts- “you know perfectly well, Dumbledore, that I have every right to arrest her on suspicion of aiding a fugitive from justice, not to mention the arson attack in that little freak show of hers.”<br/>Miss Goldstein, looking furious, suddenly moves to place herself directly between Nagini and Travers. “And let’s be honest, I doubt she was even in France legally in the first place,” he finishes, with a contemptuous look in Nagini’s direction.<br/>She can feel herself withering under his dark, narrowed eyes. He’s right. He does have every right. Out of everyone here, she knew Credence best- or thought she did- and he was the only person who knew what they did to you in that place, and why they’d had to burn it. And if there are any immigration papers in her name- unlikely, knowing Skender- they’re probably fake, and definitely in his possession (wherever he is now). How can she tell them? How can she explain that it wasn’t her fault-<br/>Dumbledore clears his throat. “I must say, Torquil, considering that over twenty people died last night this seems a rather odd time to discuss the survivors’ travel documentation.” His voice is still polite, but with the faintest edge of steel, and his expression is even chillier than Kama’s. <br/>“Not my problem. I’m a servant of the law, Professor, not its master.”<br/>“How ironic.”<br/>For a second, Nagini wonders who has spoken. Then she realised that everyone is staring at Theseus Scamander. Travers looks stumped, his brow creased, for the first time no angry retort on his lips.<br/>Scamander looks back and suddenly, out of all the eyes in the room, Nagini realised that his are the coldest. There is mockery there, mixed in with pain and regret and sadness- but most of all a hard, burning anger. He stands up, not taking his eyes off Travers. “Would you mind if I had a quick word, Mr Travers?” He jerks his head, feigning casualness, towards the door. “In private?”<br/>The smallest hint of colour drains from Travers’ face. He nods curtly, then turns on his polished heel and stalks towards the door before Scamander can lead the way. Scamander walks barely more than a foot behind him, and Nagini isn’t sure whether to admire or fear the way he looks, like he’s about to put a knife in the older man’s back. The kind of quiet rage she remembers seeing so often in Credence’s eyes.</p><p>The minutes tick by on an ornate grandfather clock in the corner, as they sit in fragile silence. Dumbledore is leaning on a desk, staring thoughtfully at the ceiling, a peaceful but strangely sad expression on his face. Yusuf Kama, meanwhile, looks every inch the pureblood gentleman: poised, collected, dignified. The broken man with the manic eyes, who threatened her in a crypt five feet from the corpse of his mother’s rapist, is in every sense an ocean away. But under the calm exterior he’s alert, watchful. He never truly relaxes, even for one second- every muscle is tightened like a statue about to leap from its plinth. One hand rests, almost casually, on the pocket where he must be keeping his wand. He’s getting ready to run.<br/>He stirs, looks around. Their eyes meet. Nagini turns away and from then on, keeps her gaze firmly in her lap and does not look up again. Not even to check if she’s right in thinking that Miss Goldstein is still watching her. She’ll probably be on a ship “home”, if Jakarta could ever be called that, this time tomorrow. So there’s no point establishing relations, none in getting attached. </p><p>The door opens, and Travers and Scamander re-enter the office. Scamander looks… odd. A little rattled, yet oddly… triumphant. Travers, though… he still looks angry but more sullen, too. Like a disrespectful child who’s just had an earful from his mother. His fists are clenched, knuckles white, and he keeps shooting distrustful, almost… frightened glances at Scamander.<br/>Who ignores him.<br/>Then, Scamander clears his throat and addresses the room at large. “I’m pleased to say that- for now, at least- all that earlier unpleasantness has been settled, so there’s no need for anyone to worry. Obviously there’ll- there’ll be an inquest. And I dare say that all of us will be interviewed about…” He swallows, and his voice shakes slightly. “... about what happened. Last night. Yes.” He clears his throat. Swallows again. “Until then, we may as well be comfortable. So, as Miss Goldstein said: Mr Kowalski and Mr Kama will be coming with me- if you’re agreeable, gentlemen- and Miss Goldstein and Miss… Nagini will be accompanying my brother. We can use Portkeys, I think, assuming Professor Dippet has no objec-”<br/>“A-Actually, Theseus-” Newt Scamander stands up too, still cradling his Niffler- “I was thinking, unless no-one’s desperate for sleep, perhaps we could all, ah, stop off at mine first? We could rustle up a bit of food, and…” He falters, not quite able to meet his brother’s eyes, in spite of his best efforts. “And, well, I think there are some things we still need to discuss.”<br/>Nagini can’t see Theseus’ expression, only the back of his head. But he does at least seem to agree.<br/>“Ok, then.” Goldstein, who had been sitting on a spindly wooden chair during Theseus and Travers’ absence, stands up again.”I, ah- I guess that’s settled.” She looks at Nagini. “If you don’t mind, that is? I never actually checked.”<br/>Under her anxious gaze, the full realisation of what is happening seems to crash like a rampaging Erumpent into Nagini’s brain.<br/>They actually seem to mean it: they were asking her to come stay. And they seem almost… happy about it.<br/>She feels as if her insides are shrinking or maybe turning to stone, her head spinning and her heart so full it might burst.<br/>Finally, she nods, then forces her lips to move.<br/>“Yes,” she hears- her voice sounding distant, as though it belongs to someone on the other side of the wall. “Yes, I- I would like that. Thank you,” she adds, not wanting to seem impolite.<br/>Scamander and Goldstein’s faces both relax into relieved smiles.<br/>No- no, she must have read that wrong. No wizard- no normal person- will ever react to her like that. Maybe Credence… but look how that ended. They were just being courteous, doing their duty, that was all.<br/>Goldstein clears her throat. “Uh- Professor Dippet, would you mind…”<br/>“Certainly, certainly…” With a wand almost as thin and spindly as himself and his chairs, the elderly wizard summons an empty “Pepper Imps” box out of the trash can, waves his wand, and mutters “Portus”.<br/>The cardboard glows a luminescent blue, then returns to its usual, drab state. Theseus Scamander picks it up, and walks into the centre of their haphazard circle.<br/>“I’ll assume everyone knows the drill,” he says, holding it out.<br/>Nagini, in fact, does not- she has never used a Portkey before. But she doesn't say this; everyone, even Mr Kowalski, is nodding, and the thought of publicly declaring her ignorance- her difference- is too humiliating. Fortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any trick to it: Miss Goldstein holds a corner of the box between her thumb and forefinger, and Nagini copies.<br/>“You should all be off in around ten seconds or so,” chimes in Professor Dippet, checking his watch.<br/>Nagini grips the box until her fingertips turns white, counting down in her head. <br/>Ten.<br/>Nine.<br/>Eight.<br/>She sneaks a glance around the circle. They all seem relaxed- except Mr Kowalski, who is going rather green. But even in this neutral stance, their exhaustion and grief is obvious if you look into their eyes, and look hard. Her own eyes fall on Kama- and find him already watching her. But there is something strange about his expression. It holds sadness, yes, but something… something else… she can’t  describe it. She can’t look away, and isn’t sure if she wants to.<br/>They’re nice, his eyes. The deep, dark brown of them, the soft flick of black eyelashes. The constant look they have of being deep in thought, but weighed down by sadness. Not that she likes anyone being sad. But to be alone, to be adrift in the world with nothing and no-one… she knows, after last night, that he understands how that feels, and she finds it oddly comforting. <br/>She keeps looking. <br/>He keeps looking back. There’s a strange expression on his face, one as unfathomable to her as Parseltongue must be to him.<br/>“Two… one…”<br/>She gasps at the sudden, jerking sensation around her navel, followed by the sickeningly intrusive feeling of being yanked forwards by a hook in her stomach. The world collapses into a blinding hurricane of blurring light and colour; her head is spinning and she’s sure she’s going to be sick- she doesn’t like this, she really doesn’t like this-<br/>And then, as quickly as they’d set off, her feet hit solid ground, sinking into thick carpet that tickles the bridges of her feet. She can see the walls and furniture of someone’s living room, but doesn’t have time to piece anything more together- everything is wobbling and lurching horribly, and her entire body feels so odd…<br/>She staggers, her legs jelly-like and her head still all fuzzy- and a pair of thin but warm hands catch her, steadying. They grip her arms, but not in a wanting-to-hurt-her kind of way.<br/>“Woah- there you go, you’re alright,” says Goldstein’s voice, sounding alarmed but still kind, still reassuring. “C’mon, let’s sit down…” The Auror places one arm around her shoulders, and gently guides her over to an armchair. “That’s it,” she says, as Nagini shuts her eyes tight and tries to breathe without throwing up. And it isn’t just the motion sickness, now. Something else is aching inside her stomach like the echo of a fist, the sensation of being treated with such kindness, and the painful confusion of not knowing why… the last time… when was the last time someone had held her like this… a warm body to lean against on a rooftop, the brush of lips on her hand in a Parisian alley… no, don’t think- don’t think about that-<br/>But her anguish must have shown on her face, because Goldstein is still holding her like a sister. “That’s it,” the voice says. “That’s it. You’re ok. I’ve got you. It’s gonna be ok.”</p>
