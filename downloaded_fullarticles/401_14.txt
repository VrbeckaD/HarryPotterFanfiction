    <p>Harry and Draco get off the train and look around the platform.<br/>
Draco: Can you see him anywhere?<br/>
Harry: Nope.<br/>
They scan round again.<br/>
Harry: Oh I see him.<br/>
Draco: Is he with Sev?<br/>
Harry: Yep.<br/>
Draco: We'll give them a minute.<br/>
Harry: Yep. Shit!<br/>
Draco: Harry.<br/>
Harry: Sorry. Guess who forgot to write to their aunt and uncle with a cease and desist?<br/>
Draco: *laughs* Well done.<br/>
Harry: Lets go wind them up.<br/>
Draco: Why not?<br/>
They walk over to the two, very out of place looking, muggles.<br/>
Harry: Hi. I forgot to let you know that I'm not coming to yours this summer.<br/>
Vernon: You what?!<br/>
Harry: I'm going with Draco to Malfoy Mannor.<br/>
Draco: Hi.<br/>
Petunia: You can't Dumbledore said...<br/>
Harry: You think I care what Dumbledore said? He's manipulated all of us to do his bidding. I don't want to be that kid that is brought up to die. And that's the truth. I was hidden away from anyone who could change my view on Dumbledore. So that when Hagrid got me I would run to Dumbledore and thank him for rescuing me. When I have followed him all it has done is nearly killed me. I was nearly murdered by The Dark Lord in first and second year; third year was completely avoidable if Dumbledore hadn't done something fourteen years ago; fourth year The Dark Lord again and two weeks ago. My godfather, who has a young son, nearly died. I've had enough of Dumbledore's mind games. Too many people die.<br/>
Vernon: That's the most amount of sense you've ever spoken.<br/>
Harry: Glad I could be of service.<br/>
Lucius and Sev come over.<br/>
Draco: Hello Father.<br/>
Lucius: Hello Draco. Hello Harry.<br/>
Harry: Hello Lucius.<br/>
Lucius: Who are these people?<br/>
Harry: My aunt and uncle.<br/>
Lucius: Lets go.<br/>
Sev grabs Harry's arm, Lucius grabs Draco's, and they disapperate.</p>
