    <p>The Gryffindor common room could have had a divisive line drawn down the center for how directly opposite the two sides of the room were occupied. On one side, near to the roaring fire, students talked amongst themselves of the gossip of the day: how narrowly detention was avoided in Professor Snape’s class, or how, after two cancellations due to the Pitch either flooding or freezing out, Hufflepuff was finally going to be able to play Slytherin in the upcoming Quidditch match.</p><p>Across the common room, closer to the staircases leading up to the dormitories, a much larger number of Gryffindors gathered, most of them clustered around Ron Weasley and a fourth year whose name Ron couldn’t remember for the life of him, as they battled their way across the chessboard between them.</p><p>If it weren’t for the fact that most of her view of the board was blocked by the mass of onlookers, Hermione would have been much more invested in the game’s outcome. She and Ron, to all of their friends’ relief, had finally gotten over their latest fight and seemed to be back on rather normal speaking terms again. Despite being a terrible player of the game, she did enjoy watching, but there were times that Ron’s victory gloating over his housemates got rather grating to listen to.</p><p>At least he had stopped looking for easy prey in the unassuming first years.</p><p>But instead, while Ron stayed surrounded by his crowd, Hermione busied herself with finishing her Arithmancy essay for Professor Vector. She had been sitting at the next table over with Seto ever since dinner had ended. Although, her study partner had long since finished his work, and was currently dancing his fingers along the keys of his laptop, ignoring the spectacle around him.</p><p>When she heard Ron triumphantly call out a ‘checkmate’, she sighed and leaned back in her seat. Finally, the room would clear out a little.</p><p>Ron moved to sit at their table, with his box of pieces and board tucked under his arm. “Another win for me. That makes what, four tonight?”</p><p>“Five,” said Hermione. She screwed the cap back onto her ink bottle. “But who’s counting?”</p><p>Ron grinned. “What can I say? No one can match my skills!”</p><p>“How can they, when you usually pick on the beginners?” said Hermione. Her eyes darted to Seto for a brief moment before going back to Ron. “Have you thought to play against someone who might be better at the game than you?”</p><p>Ron snorted. “Come on, Hermione, who here is potentially better at chess than me?”</p><p>Hermione reached into her bag and pulled out her latest ‘light reading’ pick – a tome that was at least twice the size of their current Charms text. She opened it and pulled out an old, yet well-kept magazine clipping that Ron recognized from being at the Burrow over the summer. She tapped a paragraph of text and began clearing away her excess Arithmancy notes.</p><p>Ron’s brow furrowed slightly. The clipping was about Seto. Surprise, surprise. What was so special about this stupid article, anyway? Sighing, he looked at the passage in question, and then his face lit up, and he turned to the only other occupant of the table. “Seto!”</p><p>“Hn.” Seto was barely paying attention to them as his eyes pored over Roland’s emailed weekly status report.</p><p>“After all this time – you’ve been holding out on me!”</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>“I’ve been playing circles around all the underclassmen here, and there’s been a chess player right next to me this entire time! Why didn’t you say anything all those times I was looking for someone to play against?”</p><p>Seto still didn’t look up from his work. “I haven’t touched a chessboard in months. Obviously, I hadn’t the desire to play.”</p><p>Ron smirked at him. “What – worried that you’d lose?”</p><p>Seto snorted. “Hardly. You wouldn’t last ten minutes against me.”</p><p>“You’ve said you’re out of practice. What makes you so sure that you could beat me?” Ron smirked. “I’m at the top of my game!”</p><p>Hermione looked up from her finished essay, eyebrows raised. “Ron, I know you’re good – you’re <em>more </em>than good at chess…” She tapped the article in front of him again, “…but Seto is a <em>world champion</em>.”</p><p>Ron crossed his arms and glared at her. “What – you don’t think I could hold my own? Just because I haven’t won some big leagues tournament? Yugi wasn’t even a name yet in his Duel Monsters game, and <em>he </em>beat Seto on his first try!”</p><p>Hermione watched as Seto’s eyes narrowed dangerously. “Ron….”</p><p>Ron ignored her, set the chessboard down between himself and Seto and placed the box of pieces on the table. “Alright, mate, if you’re so sure you can beat me when <em>no one else</em> around here can, prove it!”</p><p>The typing stopped, the laptop closed and set aside.</p><p>“Very well,” said Seto. With his computer out of the way, he reached across and shifted the board to be more centered between them. “<em>One</em> game.”</p><p>“Alright,” said Ron, “And what side do you want?”</p><p>“Black.”</p><p>Ron’s eyes widened briefly. “…Interesting choice. Most people choose white.”</p><p>Seto finished setting his pieces in place. “I thought it was obvious by now, that I am unlike <em>most people</em>.”</p><p>“I suppose,” said Ron, and looked up eagerly at Seto. “Ready to lose?”</p><p>“An odd statement to make, considering I have no intention of losing tonight,” said Seto. He met Ron’s gaze with an intensity Hermione hadn’t seen since his duel with Yugi out on the Quidditch Pitch. “I have no intention of parting with my championship title. Now make your move.”</p><p>Ron nodded and surveyed the board. “E4.” He smirked up at his opponent. “Remember – this is <em>wizard chess</em>. It’s not like your kind.”</p><p>Seto raised an eyebrow, and sent his matching pawn to meet Ron’s. “So the pieces move on their own. Is that supposed to scare me? The game is played the same way; you will <em>lose</em> the same way.”</p><p>“You know, that fourth year was super confident too,” said Ron, as he directed his king-side bishop out a few squares. “And everyone saw where that got him.”</p><p>Seto was stone-faced. “Intimidation tactics don’t work on me.”</p><p>Hermione moved around to the end of the table to sit directly between them both, her eyes never leaving the game, or the two players entwined in such an intense battle. She had seen Seto hyper-focused on numerous occasions, and the side of him that came out while dueling was loud and derisive to accompany his various strategies of overwhelming his opponents quickly with brutal humiliation. But this was…different. After the first three or so moves from each side, there was no talking, except in directing the pieces. Neither player’s eyes left the war laid out in front of them.</p><p>And the only time she had ever seen Ron so intently focused was during a similar match, down in the lower chambers as they fought for their very lives on Professor McGonagall’s giant chess set.</p><p>There were no quick, hastily made moves. A captured piece went to Ron, a few moves later, one to Seto. Orders were made with firm determination after long, thoughtful moments of silence.</p><p>People moved about the common room, some lingered near their table a few minutes to watch the match, but left, unimpressed with the long pauses in action. With Ron winning most games in few yet quickly made moves, this game was far from the norm. But Hermione paid no attention to any of them. Her focus remained glued to the chessboard, trying to uncover each of their strategies, to get a handle on who might be leading the upper hand. But anytime it seemed she might have had something figured out, a move was made that would change the dynamic of the game.</p><p>It was Ron that uttered the first “Check,” and he did so with a grand smirk on his face, as if, after all these intricately-woven moves, it was a personal triumph to officially get on the offensive first.</p><p>Seto didn’t seem fazed by this at all. His eyes lifted from the board to meet Ron’s and raised an eyebrow. He didn’t even look back at the board, and formed a smirk of his own. “Bishop to C4.”</p><p>Hermione gasped, and Ron’s grinning face backpedaled to one of horror, as his queen was taken out, the threat exterminated.</p><p>Ron’s jaw dropped. “You <em>planned </em>that, didn’t you?!”</p><p>Seto interlocked his fingers together and returned to studying the board. “It’s your move.”</p><p>Hermione watched Ron. He was silent for a few minutes, his eyes madly raking the board over before he finally took his turn. And the battle continued.</p><p>Harry and Yugi returned from the library and set upstairs for bed. A few seventh-years remained, chatting amiably by the fire. A fifth-year prefect returned from making rounds. The common room continued to empty.</p><p>And the game marched onward.</p><p>The time lapses between turns were getting longer now. Hermione watched as the small graveyard of captured pieces on each side continued to grow, and there was still no clear winner.</p><p>Two ‘checks’ were called, one from each side. A pawn reached the opposite end and became a queen. Three moves later, a queen was lost.</p><p>A king was put in danger again, and once again thwarted capture. The pieces continued to thin. A rook was knocked out by a pawn, the last bishop destroyed by its rival counterpart.</p><p>Hermione wasn’t sure how they were going to manage to trump each other, with the small amount of pieces left in play. All of the pawns were gone. And so were a great number of supporting players.</p><p>But the lone-standing queen and knight of matching color that remained, after hours of skirting their way around the grid, pinned in their target near a corner of the board.</p><p>“Checkmate.”</p>
