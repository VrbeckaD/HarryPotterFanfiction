    <p>Hello everyone. I know it's kind of stupid to post another fic while I have other 2 I'm still working on, but this idea has been plaguing me for weeks. I decided to go ahead and type it up. It's nothing more than a smut fic, but it will have a bit of plot.</p><p>This will not be: I reincarnate in another world and fight my way to godhood.</p><p>Oh, and a little warnings.</p><p>I am not a good writer, English is my second language, in real life I do have a little experience in the D/s lifestyle and finally this is fiction. Meaning I am free to make some mistakes, make plot armors and combine universes as I want them fit.</p><p align="center">The beginning</p><p>Life or ratter death was simply. I died and reincarnated in another world as an average orphan with the average name of Maximilian murphy.</p><p>I didn’t had any special powers, a few magic tricks didn’t count else anyone who knew how to use a computer will be calling himself iron man, I only had my past knowledge. Which I used to find some hidden cash from a deceased mobster I remembered from a case batman resolved (or will resolve) and one stash hidden in the house of peter parker, yeah you heard right, this universe appears to be combination of several that I won’t bother mentioning.</p><p>Invested wisely most of it in Wayne industries, lex corp, star labs, stark industries, oscorp, roxxon, you know sure investments.</p><p>The rest I used it for my expenses: get a good education, decent apartment, good car, clothes, helping a few friends, you know the usual.</p><p>The rest I used it to put my own small business: a bakery franchise.</p><p>It was an incredible success in Gotham, but I had no delusions, it was only because of my best friend.</p><p>Why was I still in Gotham?</p><p>Easy, Heroes, villains and metas still hadn’t appeared or at least not like in all people knows they exist and can’t deny them.</p><p>Sure right now there were mutants in the “open”, but that was another story.</p><p>So for the moment Gotham was a relative safe city. As soon as batman or joker (if he appeared, I took precautions) appear I was out.</p><p>I don’t want to get in that mess.</p><p>I would like to say I did what any sane person would do and stayed away of anything close to this hero/villains/meta business but well…life happens and somehow I ended up being best friends with pepper Potts, yes, that pepper, and ended up adopting an orphan, Hermione granger, yes from harry potter.</p><p>She is actually proof that what I know isn’t infallible, contrary to what little I knew of her from books and movies, wasn’t anything like her life, her parents weren’t abusive but neither were loving, but once she started showing powers they abandoned her in the streets of gotham when they come to a vacation, I won’t go in great details, but she basically tried to steal from me, I caught her and somehow after a set of circumstances ended up adopting her.</p><p>Pepper and I were great friends, and my daughter loved us like her real parents.</p><p>I also loved them and trust them, proof of that is that I even told her about my reincarnation and a possible futures. They were amused for a while, until some things happened that proved me right.</p><p>When that happened Hermione freaked out scared of us abandoning her, for all the troubles that come with the magical world.</p><p>Luckily, pepper managed to calm her, she made her realize that my knowledge wasn’t reliable considering the many, many versions that existed from comics, movies, videogames, TV series, books, etc. of a single universe, and this earth was the combination of several shows.</p><p>She also told her that if we were to abandon her we wouldn’t we have bought her books of magic, a bit difficult for non-magical like us, but it was worth to see her smile.</p><p>Later everything was all right and normal like always.</p><p>Better begin to stop my musings and get up, pepper is going to come for me.</p><p align="center">Max's room</p><p>Max was starting to finally wake up. When he fully woke up he looked around.</p><p>Pepper, who was peeking through a crack on the door, took advantage of his confusion, and decided to eye him up while he was getting his bearings. He was in a shirt and boxers. Perfect.</p><p>“I better start to get ready before pepper arrives." thought Max<br/> <br/> Max only had to wait a few seconds for the doorknob on his door to turn, when the door swung open Pepper strutted into the room. Max was shocked, Pepper was wearing a skimpy business suit. It was a blouse, a skirt and high heels, the blouse showed off an indecent amount of cleavage, the skirt was real short and combined with the heels if she bend down even a little you could see everything.</p><p>The suit certainly accentuated what she had.</p><p><em>This is the sluttiest suit I could find, it should get him going. - Pepper thought.</em><br/> <br/> "Max you are finally awake!” Pepper said</p><p>She ran to him, and gave him a big hug.</p><p>Max looked down to see her shirt covered breasts at the bursting point. In fact he eyed the quaking button holding her top together warily, if that sprang off it could get his eye out!</p><p>"Is something wrong?" asked Pepper.<br/> <br/> "No. Nothing's wrong. So how long have you been waiting?<br/> <br/> "Half an hour I arrived earlier and got some food. I hope you don’t mind"<br/> <br/> "Oh, don’t worry my house is your house.” Max said</p><p>“I know, still is better to ask” she said</p><p>“Alright then. Ouch!” Exclaimed Max holding his stomach.<br/> <br/> "Are you okay? Need anything?" Pepper asked, slightly worried.<br/> <br/> "No, I'm okay, it's just my stomach. I guess I shouldn’t eat sushi that late” Max reasoned.<br/> <br/> "Well lay down and I'll heal you right up.” Said Pepper in a chipper tone.</p><p>"Okay Pepper." He answered.<br/> <br/> Max took off his shirt and laid in the bed. Closing his eyes he absently appreciated how convenient magic was, even if it were only some parlor tricks.</p><p><em>Why is Pepper acting so weird?"-he thought, noticing she was taking her sweet time adjusting her ass as she sat in his lap.</em><br/> <br/> Pepper's hand started to heal glow green as she started to heal him. While Max had his eyes closed, Pepper was looking at Max with his shirt off. His big muscles and great chest caused Pepper to almost start drooling.</p><p>She had to put her plan into action now.<br/> <br/> "Max can I tell you something" Pepper asked sounding slightly nervous.</p><p>Max opened his eyes and said</p><p>"Pepper we are best friends, you can tell me anything."<br/> <br/> "Well first, I want to thank you for saving me, don’t interrupt, you're a hero Max if it weren’t for your help I don’t know what we would have ended doing to survive. You will probably say that we could have been fine based in what we know of your future knowledge, but we know it isn’t infallible.</p><p>Proof of that is that I don't a crush in Tony stark any more, thanks to you, I've grown up, and realized how childish my crush on him was.</p><p>Hell just talking with him 5 minutes I discovered he was the narcissistic, playboy and drunkard you said he was, sure he might grow up in the future given what you know, but there is no guarantee and I have met someone better.” She finished</p><p>“Really? Well I am fine as long as you are happy, by the way who did you meet?” he asked</p><p>“You. I care about you, I have always had. And I'm sorry it took me this long to realize how much you meant to me." She confessed.<br/> <br/> "..."- but before he could even begin to think of what to say to her Pepper stopped healing him and gave him a chaste kiss on the lips.<br/> <br/> "That was for always being there for me, and this is for always helping me.” She said as she gave Max another kiss, this time putting more of her feelings for him into it.<br/> <br/> "Pepper, are you sure about this? I mean what about your future as MS Stark? Hell you have been keeping yourself pure for him…more or less.” Max inquired.<br/> <br/> "Other girls don’t count Max, and yes I'm sure. It took me a long time to realize this, but, I love you. And I know that you have eyed my ass a few times, so enjoy it” Pepper finished with a flirty wink</p><p>"Well if you are sure, let's have some fun." He finished with a grin as she got off him so he could take his shirt and boxers off.</p><p>While Pepper took off her clothes and pushed Max's back onto the bed.<br/> <br/> Once Max was on his back Pepper slowly sat down on top of him and lined up his cock in her pussy.</p><p>"Max I want this so much. Please Max let's make love." said Pepper as she slipped the head of his cock in her pussy and slammed herself down on his cock. Having broken her hymen years ago experimenting with girls (she wasn’t planning sleeping with any man who wasn’t stark, or at least those were her thoughts before), the pain was minimal.<br/> <br/> Pepper started a steady rhythm of up and downs while Max palmed her plump ass.</p><p>"Max, more! Oh God, ah, ah, Oh God my pussy's on fire! Max, fuck me. Oh God! Ah, ah, more! Touch my breasts; they want to feel your touch." Exclaimed Pepper between pants.<br/> <br/> Max grabbed one breast and started to suck on her nipple. He grabbed her other breast with his free hand and started pinching the nipple.</p><p>"Pepper you're so fucking hot. Faster, I can feel your hot pussy. I want you to cum all over my cock.” Max managed to say before he grabbed her ass and started bouncing it faster, thrusting up at the same time.<br/> <br/> "Max more! I'm almost there! Your cock feels so good! Fuck my pussy harder. I'm almost there! Hurry Max! Oh God. Deeper! Ah, ah, ah, Oh God! I'm Cumming!”</p><p>Shouted Pepper as she had the hardest orgasm of her life.</p><p>Max gave a few more quick thrusts as he bottomed out inside her and released his load into her waiting womb. Extending Pepper's orgasm a few more seconds.</p><p>"That felt so good Pepper. I hope you didn't think I was going to be satisfied with just one round did you?" Said a grinning Max switched positions.</p><p>So now Pepper was on the bottom and Max was on the top.<br/> <br/> "More. Fuck me more! I'll do anything you want. Just fuck my pussy raw!" Half-shouted Pepper as she opened her legs to show Max her pussy, still dripping with both their love juices.</p><p>Max then grabbed her waist and rammed his cock in her pussy, hammering away at full speed.</p><p>"Pepper your pussy is so good! I can't stop, you are just too sexy." said Max as he slammed in and out of her pussy.<br/> <br/> "Max more, faster, harder! Oh, ah, ah. Fuck me, fuck me rough! Oh God faster!" She was openly screaming at this point.</p><p>She grabbed the bed rails so Max could fuck her faster.</p><p>"Max fuck me until I can't cum anymore! Until I can't move! Oh God! Cum in me! Fill me to the brim!"</p><p>"Pepper I going to cum." grunted Max.<br/> <br/> “Me too. Let’s cum together." Moaned out Pepper as they both came.</p><p>Max Shot six times before he pulled out, another 2 spurts came out and hit her breasts.</p><p>"Sorry about that Pepper. I thought I was done." Max sheepishly admitted while rubbing the back of his head.<br/> <br/> "No worries Max. Now let me suck you off." Said Pepper as she got on her knees, grabbing his long 12 inch cock with one hand she engulfed the first few inches in her hot, wet mouth and messaged this balls with the other hand.<br/> <br/> "Go faster my little slut." Moaned Max.<br/> <br/> Pepper didn't even care that Max called her a slut. For him, it was true. So she would let Max call her whatever he wanted, in private, of course. Pepper licked the bottom of his cock first and when she got to the tip she kissed it. Putting it in her mouth Pepper started to suck hard and fast.</p><p>"Pepper. Deeper. Suck faster you bitch I want to cum all over your face." Max grabbed her by the hair and forced his cock down the back of her throat.</p><p>Unfortunately he was only able to get six inches in without hurting her. And while she seemed to be enjoying being used like a whore he was still rather new to sex with his best friend.<br/> <br/> "Almost... there." groaned out Max as he sped up his thrusting for a few seconds before erupting in her throat.</p><p>Holding his cock where it was most of his seed went down her throat causing her to choke. It became too much for her to shallow and some of his seed splashed onto her face and dripped onto her breasts.<br/> <br/> "Damn Pepper. You sure like sucking my cock don't you?" Gasped out Max, commenting on the fact that she didn't resist at all when he started face-fucking her<br/> <br/> "Yes. I do Max. It's a good thing you're already accepted me or else I would have had to use the spare key, enter your apartment at night and rape you. I have to make up for lost time after all." Pepper finished with a lusty grin.<br/> <br/> "Get on the bed and get on all fours. You said to fuck you until you couldn't cum any more so I want to fuck that nice ass of yours till you can't even think about moving without feeling sore. Hurry up my cute little cum dumpster." He said as she got up.<br/> <br/> Max smacked her ass as she get on all fours and spread her ass cheeks wide open for him.</p><p>"Now Pepper, before I fuck your ass, tell me how hard you want it." Max ordered as he put his cock near her asshole, and move it around the entrance, teasing her until she did what he asked.</p><p>"I want it hard! Fuck my ass till I can't feel my legs anymore. I want you to stick your long hard fat dick into my little ass. Fuck me hard and long until your balls are empty. Make me your bitch, I'm yours Max. So please Max, stick it in already! I don't care if I start screaming in pain! Just fuck my ass as hard as you possibly can!" She pleaded, practically vibrating with lust and excitement.<br/> <br/> "Okay then slut, when I'm fucking your ass I want you to thank me for giving it to you so roughly." Max said right next to her ear.<br/> <br/> It was a little difficult to put the massive head into her small ass but the juices from the sex they had a second ago helped tremendously.</p><p>Before Pepper could plead to put it in faster she was cut off by him succeeding in getting the head in.</p><p>Taking her words to heart Max gave no mercy as soon as he was able he rammed all the way into her tight ass, drawing a scream of one part pain and two parts pleasure from her.</p><p>His hips resting against her ass cheeks for a second before he pulled all but the head out and slammed back in. after a few thrusts he abandoned any form of rhythm and was slamming in and out of her with reckless abandon.<br/> <br/> "Oh God! My ass! Fuck me harder! Oh God, deeper. Ah, oh, ah, ah, ah, Oh God fuck my Ass. Oh God, your huge cock! I can feel it, it's in me so deep! I'm your whore! Thank you Max for fucking my ass so hard!"<br/> <br/> "That's a good slut, next time you come to my apartment I am not letting you out until I fuck you. I want to see your pussy filled with my cum every time you leave my apartment!” said Max as he spanked her ass.<br/> <br/> "Max, I am going to cum." Pepper moaned weakly.<br/> <br/> "Oooh no, you don't cum till I tell you too. Hold it in, the longer I fuck you the harder your orgasms going to be."<br/> <br/> As he went even faster with a quick use of mafic she shoved her face into the pillows. Not even having the strength to grab the bed rails again.</p><p>Max didn't stop, not even for a second, he only thrust harder and faster as the minutes ticked by.<br/> <br/> Pepper couldn't take it anymore.</p><p>"Max! Please I need to cum! I can't take anymore!"</p><p>Max ignored her and continued slamming into her, making sure that she'd be begging for more the next time she got horny.</p><p>Max bent down and whispered into her ear. "You've earned it Pep, let it go whenever you want."</p><p>And she did, with a mighty scream Pepper had the greatest orgasm yet, topping the one earlier by far.</p><p>Max, feeling a now familiar pressure building up used a bit more magic and sped up thrust thrusts to inhuman levels. After a few seconds of this he slammed into her ass with bruising force and released the biggest load of the night into her rectum.<br/> <br/> Pepper, out of energy, simply flopped down on the bed. She silently thanked Max when he picked her up and put her beside him so she could rest her head on his shoulder.</p><p>She mustered all her remaining strength and gave Max another kiss.</p><p>"You sure know how to satisfy a woman." She commented as he pulled up the blankets to cover them both.<br/> <br/> "You were excellent too. Well then, we'd better get some rest, my naughty little slut might need some rest before we go out."<br/> <br/> "Sounds good, <strong>yawn</strong> but don't call me names like that in public Okay? Only when we're alone." She barely said the last sentence before she lost the downhill battle against her increasingly heavy eyelids.<br/> <br/> "No problem Pepper." He said, kissing her on the forehead and smiling at her lovingly before he too, fell to sleeps embrace</p>
