    <strong>EYES</strong>
  </u>
</p>
<p>Domineered. She had been domineered all her life by her mother and her fusty mother’s advisor, she was fed up with it and wanted to rebel. Oh, there was one thing wrong with that, she was the Queen of England. Bloody inconvenienced by a crown that weighed heavily on her head. She needed to be young, to enjoy balls without the ceremony, to dance without feeling the invisible symbol of her rule.</p>
<p>That was when they met when she felt even weightier on her. Eyes that could strip her naked in one look. If only the man had that power, she thought. That was where her true self could run free reign. Slowly, she turned in the dance to find the eyes were slowly taking in her body, she watched as turned on her heel. The eyes haunted her, the man himself was her Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Her heart, an organ it was rumoured she did not possess, beat hard in her chest. Steady rhythms to meet the pace of the dancing. Also the step of her passions, now her own eyes were fixated on him. Twirling around always making sure she could see him.</p>
<p>So, this was not the first time she met him. It was the inaugural time she found herself meeting his eyes with calm equanimity and flirtation. A friend had whirled next to her, causing them to almost stumble.</p>
<p>“Oh I am sorry, my Queen,” the guest, the daughter of the Duchess of Cornwall said. “I was hoping to grab your attention, really.”</p>
<p>This meant a little conversation was in order, “I wish to know your name,” the Queen replied.</p>
<p>“Hermione,” she said blushing.</p>
<p>“No harm was done, Hermione, perhaps we ought to take a ride on the horses sometime soon,” to which the young woman nodded and she was approached by a young blond man who offered his hand, blushing Hermione smiled and checked her card. “Draco, a rather odd name,” Hermione said, “but Greek-like mine, let us to the dancefloor.”</p>
<p>When the Queen was left alone. The eyes were walking, somehow she forgot that the eyes were only a body part but belonged in a face with cheekbones that could shard diamonds, lips that could quibble and, Victoria blushed, ardently kiss too. They were lips formed for War Speeches and for Making Love…the naughty thoughts invaded her mind again.</p>
<p>A man was a troublesome beast; the eyes were closer to hers and glanced down on the head of the man she had come to depend upon.</p>
<p>She curtsied as he bowed low from the waist, he forest green velvet jacket brought out the golden quality his gaze possessed.</p>
<p>“My Queen,” he demurred, carefully taking her hand in his, “may I have the honour of this dance.”</p>
<p>Blushing all the way down her neck she smiled, and lengthened her arm out, “I shall be delighted,” she said.</p>
<p>“My dear Queen might I say you look exquisite this evening.”</p>
<p>“And you, dignified, Prime Minister.”</p>
<p>The moment he wrapped an arm around her waist she knew she was done for, this man – the saintly creature belonged with her, and for her, she couldn’t let go.</p>
<p>“Enjoying yourself, my Queen?”</p>
<p>Her answer must be guarded she knew that but she wanted to be 18, a young girl dreaming for a man she met at the Dance Ball, “Immeasurably more so now,” she smirked, her eyes gleaming triumphantly. “Now that I’m dancing with you, I feel my world complete!”</p>
