    <p>WolfStar: SuperNova</p><p>Chapter 1<br/>          Remus stared at Sirius from across the Divination room, with longing not just from the oversized erection straining from under his robes, but also from his heart. This wild haired hooligan completed him in every way, he couldn't help but just ache for him. He felt like he could explode at any moment just from being around this rugged, gorgeous man.<br/>As soon as the lesson ended he hurried over to help Sirius with his books as nonchalantly as he could. They climbed down the ladder, going down the enormous staircase that lead from the tower, and met James and Peter at the bottom. <br/>“All set for Transfiguration?” James asked them. <br/>“Yeah a real class you mean?” replied Sirius. <br/>They all had a laugh at Trelawney’s expense while finding their way to Professor McGonagall’s classroom.<br/>The class was half full when they arrived, and as usual McGonagall had some notes on the board about what they would be doing for that class. Seemed like they'd be transforming birds they conjured into books today. Remus enjoyed watching other living things undergo changes against their will, not for any dark reason, it just made him feel less alone. His lycanthropy was a secret to almost everyone at Hogwarts aside from Professors  Dumbledore, Slughorn, McGonagall and of course his three best friends. This is why all of them were always excited for Transfiguration, they had secretly learned how to become Animagi so they could hang out with Remus during his “time of the month”. This was no simple feat as human and cross species transfiguration were things they would only be starting to learn this year and next. After successfully transitioning the birds several times Remus asked to be excused. </p><p>He headed down the hall to the prefect bathroom. Passing Boris the Bewildered Remus muttered, “Pine Fresh.”<br/>When he got there he rushed to the sink and splashed his face with water. Standing there staring in the mirror he tried to calm himself. Ever since he and Sirius had discussed their mutual interest in each other he had been on edge. He was wanting for so much more but understood Sirius’ reasoning for keeping things quiet for now. They had only just begun to explore this new connection, no need to tell the whole world if it wasn't forever. Still as it was getting closer to the full moon his animal side was taking over and his sexual urges were hard to contain. He was having a hell of a time covering his raging erections, although the robes helped immensely. <br/>I could just rub one out, he thought, and headed for an empty stall. He slid down his trousers just enough to release his aching member, gently preparing for relief as he was so engorged. He had only just begun to rub his cock when he heard the bathroom door open. <br/>Of fucking course someone would come in! he thought. He held his breath and waited in silence as the intruder seemed to wander through the bathroom aimlessly. It seemed like an eternity and Remus couldn't stand the uncomfortability of his pulsing member for another second. Suddenly the intruder was right outside his stall. <br/>Oh my fucking God I'm about to get found out wanking in the bathroom, he thought. Panicking he shoved himself back into his robes, when a familiar voice spoke ever so softly. <br/>“You couldn't wait for me to fuck you tonight? You had to sneak off and wank it in the middle of class?”<br/>It was Sirius. <br/>If Remus was uncomfortably full of semen before, it was nothing compared to being caught by the man causing him such tension. <br/>“Heh… well I didn't want to disappoint you tonight I suppose..” he said shakily. <br/>“Well what's the hold up. Let me in!” Sirius replied with a hint of excitement in his voice. <br/>Remus flung the door open and Sirius squeezed into the stall. There wasn't much room in the small cubicle and that only made Remus more excited. <br/>“So what's the problem then? All backed up?” Sirius said with a smile.<br/>He was taunting him as he always did. He then slid his hand gently from Remus’ tie slowly down his front, opening his robe, and revealing his impressive erection. <br/>“Well Well Well. Look what you have for me.” Sirius said acting coy. <br/>“Please either do something about this or get out so I can Siri. I'm in pain here.” Remus demanded. <br/>“Well what would you have me do with it?” Sirius joked gently stroking Remus’ hard cock. <br/>Feeling his animal side take over again Remus couldn't stop himself before he said, <br/>“Well, I want you to get on your knees and use that mouth of yours on my cock if we're handling this here.”<br/> Sirius took a step back and for a second Remus thought he crossed a line. Before he could apologize or laugh it off as a joke Sirius dropped to his knees in front of him with a sexy smirk. Remus almost lost himself as soon as Sirius put his soft mouth on his cock. He couldn't think of anything except how good it felt to have Sirius passionately tongue bathing his prick, he somehow found a way to lick gently and suck vigorously simultaneously. Neither one had much experience with their new forbidden relationship.  Remus was a virgin and Sirius had only had a go with a few women before he realized it wasn't satisfying. Still Sirius was working Remus like he invented the blow job. <br/>“Bloody Hell! …. You're amazing! …. I feel like you're gonna suck my dick off!” Remus grunted. <br/>“‘Ust ‘oo ‘ate or tu’nite.” Sirius choked out while never letting Remus out of his mouth. <br/>Remus could feel his release coming and wrapped his fingers in Sirius’ rugged, curly locks and thrust into his face in such a rough manner he thought he'd given him whiplash. He threw his head back and let out an uncontrollable howl of satisfaction as he finished inside Sirius’ mouth. When he opened his eyes he went completely white. Sirius hadn't paid attention either but after he wiped his mouth he looked up at Remus and his jaw dropped. <br/>“Hiya bad boys!” taunted Moaning Myrtle with a small wave.</p>
