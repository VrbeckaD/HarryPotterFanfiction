    <p>
  <span>Draco tried to beg off of lunch with mother, but she seemed determined to get him in the same room with her—alone; his father was off in France, thank Merlin—and he was too tired from a night of hideous nightmares to refuse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they sat and ate, she watched him like a hawk. Her eyes were narrowed and her lips were thin and turned down at the corners, an expression he hardly ever saw on her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It made him suspicious, so in turn he watched her, which led them swiftly to a staring match that they both took with an air of minor competitive aggression. By the time he’d finished his lunch and drank the rest of the wine, his eyes were dry and his stare void of any real focus besides his mother’s general direction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She cleared her throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He raised his eyebrows.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shuffled her napkin off her lap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He summoned a toothpick and started working on the bits he couldn’t reach with his tongue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her face cleared of any evidence of a glare, smoothing out in the same way she’d taught him as a child.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re going to America,” she said, off hand, as if it had already been decided and talked through and she was just reminding herself out loud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me?” Draco asked, appalled by the thought. “No I am </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled, sharp at the edges, and Draco wanted to strangle her, but only a mild strangulation, because he did love her in the end, unfortunately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh </span>
  <em>
    <span>yes</span>
  </em>
  <span> we </span>
  <em>
    <span>are</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>♣</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco hated the floo; portkeys were terrifying, but you didn’t hear that from him; and there was no way he was going to fly across the bloody ocean on a broom, so the SeaTran it was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had grown up around the hatred of everything slightly new that wasn’t 1) European and 2) based on ‘pure blood’. And so the SeaTran was talked about in “his” (see: his father’s) social circle as if it were a creation of festering filth, therefore disgusting and not worthy of their time—unless, of course, said time was used to complain about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco knew, however, that his mother was secretly fascinated by magic made by half bloods, mudbloods or even non-magic things made by muggles—a fact that would never leave his mind, and neither his lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’d always lingered in book shops near the inventions section whenever they’d go. She'd spend her time glancing swiftly over the rows of books marked ‘new’, and nothing that was </span>
  <em>
    <span>new</span>
  </em>
  <span> these days was made by someone with an outstanding faultless bloodline, let’s be realistic. They were too busy celebrating their old victories—if you were to call them that. ‘Oh, my great-great-great-great uncle created the Cold-be-Gone potion in 1790, wasn’t that amazing?’ (queue murmurs from other Rich Dumbasses in agreement,) ‘Anyway we’re rich still so why do anything else except for brag about this one accomplishment some old fuck I never knew did, and eat the free food at annual charity galas, pretending as if we’re seriously worried about these—what was it, again—oh, right, </span>
  <em>
    <span>orphans</span>
  </em>
  <span>.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco had a bit of pent-up rage up in there about that topic. He knew it, and he was increasingly, irreversibility mad at himself about—just, who he was, is, and will be, as a person.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But enough of that. He didn’t want to think about his own bullshit right now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So back to his mother’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d caught her when he was younger, once or twice, with a muggle book or magazine about technology clutched within her grip in the wee hours of the night. She’d burn them once she was done with them, just in case her husband found out. And he’d kept his mouth shut, because that’s what a son does when he sees his mother happy for once.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then now. After the war...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hated it, only because it meant he had to use a proxy—Luna—to get his hands on the stuff, such as televisions, electronic clocks, and whatever else for her amusement, thanking Merlin his father was gone for now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On ‘business’.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Whatever business would an ex-deatheater purist have in France?’ one would ask. Probably that girl Hermione, knowing her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Good question! He hadn’t the faintest idea, and to be honest, he really could give less of a single shit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because he was here now with his mother, boarding the SeaTran to America.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The SeaTran went, shockingly, under the sea. All the way across the way to the Americas, where it branched off from its DC Dropoff location to surface in Canada, Mexico, and Brazil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The whole thing was huge and moved like a snake under water, its body made of gleaming bronze-and-silver coloured steel. You entered through the mouth, and the whole head was that of a snake’s (including fangs, but hopefully you were smart enough to avoid those). The metal beast was created by a team of half blood nobodies, half of whom from America and the other from England. They’d been frustrated by the lack of wizard transportation to and from their friend’s landmasses, so they’d just built a giant snake and called it a day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At least, that’s what the brochure clutched in his hands claimed, and what his mother quietly nodded to, when she’d read it. He’d seen her just the other day with a book titled ‘The Great Metal Beast of the Seas’, which, now with context, should have raised alarm bells but hadn’t because he’d been too excited about her openly reading something so decidedly Not Pureblood in front of him without shame.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was the first to admit to himself (and, like, Pansy, but that’s the extent of the word traveling) that these few months alone with only each other and a house elf had them realize how far apart they’d drawn away and how close they had to stick.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’d done it to protect each other, sure, and that was all fine and dandy, but it hadn’t just been the war’s fault. His father was smart, with the tendency to be rather proud, and both of those combined equal a tyrant, in a sense. He turned away from emotion, from truth, from love, and used all his energy on hating people and things. He’d breathed it all in, the idea that he was better, so much better, than everyone else—that when he was shown he wasn’t, by the Lord of Tyrants himself, he’d crumbled and fallen and let things </span>
  <em>
    <span>happen</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They, on the other hand, had just wanted to survive it all, hadn’t they?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A whistle blew and people from their group of First Class riders started to board. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The SeaTran’s body, from the outside, seemed to breathe as they moved, but it could’ve been... a trick of the light, or something. He stepped inside when his mother did, following her as she muttered to herself about room number and whatnot until she exclaimed, “Right here!” In such an enthusiastic way as she pointed to their door that he had to smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their compartment was brightly lit by modern-looking muggle lights, and had plenty of room to stretch out ones legs. The hallway ran on one side of the body, the compartments on the other, so they had a nice window view to the outside. He touched the glass, and felt a low thrum of deep, strong magic under his fingers. It was reinforced in a way that spoke of a slight paranoia about windows, and he wasn’t quite sure if that was a good thing or something to worry about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The whole SeaTran was currently beached, so the view was okay, but not anything new. He turned back to heave their luggage into the shelving above their heads, catching a glimpse of his mother poking at the lights.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The electricity in this train is purely muggle. They had to figure out how to balance the two—magic and electricity—oh, as you know, they usually short each other out unless the current is made </span>
  <em>
    <span>by</span>
  </em>
  <span> magic. But they did it, this is pure muggle current, running alongside magic auras, no power surges or flickering... no sparks... Why, isn’t that </span>
  <em>
    <span>interesting</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” she asked him, turning to look him right in the eye.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Devastatingly,” he said, and he found himself truly meaning it. Because—really. It </span>
  <em>
    <span>was </span>
  </em>
  <span>interesting. “You’re going to make me think about this, you know, and then I won’t be able to sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You </span>
  <em>
    <span>already</span>
  </em>
  <span> can’t sleep,” she pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He went still, and then laughed. “Touché.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are they getting any better?” She wondered, touching his back gently in reassurance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sometimes,” he said, looking back out the window. “When do we depart?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sighed, moving to sit, and he felt a twinge in his chest. She wanted to talk, he knew that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew that, but fuck, he was not </span>
  <em>
    <span>ready</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Not for that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In ten minutes, if all goes  well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They started to get comfortable, Draco dragging the stupidly large </span>
  <em>
    <span>Wandless Wonders: How to Cast Without Your Wand</span>
  </em>
  <span> from his book bag.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The whole book was... enlightening. In the way one might realize a river will not move aside for you, and you must swim up the current as fast as you can before you hit the waterfall and then </span>
  <em>
    <span>fall down</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Basically, it was helping him jack shit and he was a thin razor’s edge away from taking a step in his mother’s direction and burning the damn thing, albeit not for the same reasons.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wandless magic was stupid. It was stupid because it didn’t come easy, and Draco needed it to come easy or else he’d find himself throwing a fit that was very 1991 of him. He was better than that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was better than that </span>
  <em>
    <span>now.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The SeaTran started to move, a small sway of the compartment that, when looking out of the window, was extremely disproportionate from the amount of moving the metal body was doing. It made sense to charm the inside to only move slightly, as if it wasn’t they’d’ve been thrown across the room about ten times right about then, but it still messed with his head to see it so he looked away, down to his book, and cracked it open with a determined look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait, honey, look,” his mother breathed, and he looked back just as the body submerged itself in seawater, the waterline rapidly moving up the window until only water remained as it slid into the depths.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sort of reminds me of the dorms,” he mentioned, and his mother smiled and nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He watched some more, but he could only take so much before he began to feel a little sick from the swift and efficient way the train moved, building up speed until the depths were a blur of dark blue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He settled more firmly in his chair and told himself that he was going to learn wandless fucking magic right the fuck now.</span>
