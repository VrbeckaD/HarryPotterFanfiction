    <p>Albus Dumbledore looked around his office at Hogwarts with smug satisfaction. It had been 5 years since the end of the second Wizarding war, and everything was going to plan. Voldemort had been defeated, and Albus now had the reputation of being the Leader of the Light for two Wizarding wars. Yes, there had been losses, but the ends had justified the means. And in case of resurgence in Death Eaters or the rise of another Dark Lord, Albus had tucked away the orphaned Harry Potter as his ace in the hole. Albus smiled to himself and leaned back in his chair, looking across the room at Fawkes dozing on his perch. </p>
<p>Just as the thoughts that everything was going according to plan crossed his mind, one of the many devices on his shelves began to whirl and buzz. Albus cocked his head and his brow furrowed. The device was linked to Harry’s well-being, and was only supposed to go off if Harry was in danger. As Albus got up to check, the device slowed down and stopped buzzing. Albus relaxed. He was sure that Harry had merely tripped or was roughhousing with his cousin. Albus was confident that all was well. </p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>In Number 4 Privet Drive, a scared little boy curled up on a blanket on the floor. His aunt had taken away the crib that he had been sleeping in because Dudley was too fat to sleep in his, and needed 'his own space now that he was growing up'. That meant that there was ' no space' for Harry, so his aunt had cleaned out the cabinet under the stairs and told Harry that this would be his room from now on. Harry knew better than to argue. </p>
<p>For as long as he could remember, Harry had known that he needed to be as quiet as possible and take up as little space as he could. Take up too much space, and Uncle Vernon would get angry and yell and sometimes hit upside the head. Make too much noise, and Aunt Petunia would hiss at him that he was drawing too much attention and pinch him on the under side of his arms. As soon as Uncle Vernon got home, she would tell him that 'The boy had been acting out." and then Uncle Vernon would get mad. Either way, Harry knew to stay quiet and small and not argue with anything. Like when all he was given to wear was Dudley's too big clothing, or when his aunt made him sleep on the floor with only the very thin blanket that had been his since he was a baby.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, today had been a really bad day. He had been trying to get out of his cabinet to go to the bathroom, and had accidentally opened the door right as his aunt walked past. Apparently, this had left a scratch and a bruise, and result he had been slapped across the face for getting in the way, and shoved back under the stairs. The door had been locked, and Harry had no idea when he was going to be let out.<br/>
As Harry squirmed and wondered how long he was going to have to wait to go to the bathroom, he heard the front door open and his uncle announce that he was home from work. Harry tried to control his breathing and make himself as quiet as possible. As he listened for what was going on outside his door, he heard his aunt talking to his uncle about him. He couldn’t hear much, but he heard “Pushed” and “Bruised” and knew that no matter how quiet he was, things were going to get bad. His stomach started to ache with the familiar tension that happened every time that he knew he was in trouble.<br/>
He heard the lock slide on the outside of the door, and the door opened to his uncle’s red face and angry expression. </p>
<p>“You pushed your aunt? She’s got a giant bruise on her arm from your clumsiness, you waste of space!” His uncle reached in and grabbed him by his too-big shirt, hauling him out into the open. Harry whimpered and shook his head. </p>
<p>“It was an accident, Uncle Vernon, I swear!” Harry’s uncle wasn’t interested in his excuses, and slammed his fist into the side of Harry’s head. Harry whimpered again, and realized that he was losing control of his bladder after holding it from so long. It only took a moment for Vernon to realize what was going on, and his face got even redder as it contorted in fury.<br/>
“You nasty little shit! Trying to get out of a well deserved beating!” Vernon dropped him onto the growing puddle on the floor. Vernon kicked the boy on the floor, fury and glee mingling when the child whimpered. Vernon had always had a sadistic streak and was more than happy to let it out on the freak that had been forced upon their family. He kicked again, knocking the boys head against the wall. </p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>Albus looked up as the monitor device on Harry began to spin and shriek again. Not truly concerned that anything was wrong, Albus walked over to the fireplace and threw in a pinch of Floo powder. If he didn't have to go into the Muggle world he would rather not, and he had a pawn under his thumb that would be perfect for checking on the situation without getting involved.<br/>
“Severus, can you please come to my office?”</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>Vernon wasn’t done with the freak. He leaned down and grabbed Harry by the hair.  “You are going to clean up every inch of this hallway, you disgusting freak. And then, because you stink like piss, you are going to sleep outside in the back yard. We can hose you off tomorrow”.  Harry’s eyes widened. It was October, and was getting very cold at night. Harry got up, moving carefully because his side hurt when he moved too fast.<br/>
“Uncle, what do you want me to use to clean the hallway?” Vernon sneered. “Well, since we don’t want any of our things to touch your filth, I think you should use your blanket.”</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>Severus came through the Floo to the Headmaster’s Quarters. He was rarely called here, not since the Dark Lord had disappeared 5 years ago. Most of Severus’ time was spent dealing with obnoxious children who didn’t want to be bothered to properly learn Potions and fulfilling his Head of House duties. Severus was surprised that instead of the quiet of the tower, there was a shrill screech coming from one of the nick-knacks that cluttered Albus's office.</p>
<p>Albus looked up from his seat at Severus’ arrival. “Ah, there you are, my lad. I have a small favor to ask of you. It seems that young Harry might be in some sort of distress. I informed Petunia when she took Harry that she wouldn’t be bothered by anyone from our world, but we should check on Harry just to confirm that nothing untoward is happening. Since you are familiar with the Muggle world, I thought it would be best for you to investigate. Subtly, of course.”</p>
<p>Severus sneered, and thought that he wasn't sure if he was sneering at having to deal with Petunia for the first time since they were children or having to take up his time for the bloody Boy-Who-Lived. “ And what, Albus, should I be worried about with Mr. Potter? Are we sure that his distress is something that needs to be checked on? I am sure that he’s merely throwing a tantrum because his family won’t buy him his favorite toy or another treat?”</p>
<p>Albus chuckled to himself as he used legillimancy to gently view Severus's state of mind. He didn't want Severus to get involved with Harry, and it would be much easier if his opinions regarding Harry were based in the idea that Harry was spoiled by his relatives. It was so much easier to control people when they wore their emotions so close to the surface, and since Petunia and Vernon Dursley spoiled their own child it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine that they did the same for Harry. “Be that as it may, Severus, I would like you to check on Harry to make sure that he is well.” Albus’ voice had a note of finality to it, and Severus knew from past experience that he wouldn’t be able to say anything else to change his mind. </p>
<p>“I’ll leave immediately.” He knew that it would postpone his dinner, but it also meant that he wouldn’t have to spend it surrounded by the inane chatter of staff and students, and could order food in his quarters and eat in privacy. As he Flooed back to his own quarters, he let the nasty thoughts about James and Harry Potter fade from his mind, and let the happy memories of his friendship with Lily come back to the forefront of his mind. There wasn't anything that he wouldn't do for the only child of his lost friend. </p>
<p>***********</p>
<p>Harry pulled his blanket out from under the stairs and began wiping the floor, careful to not bump the side table and moving slowly due to the pain in his side from where his uncle kicked him. His uncle watched with narrowed eyes and after a couple of moments decided that Harry wasn’t moving fast enough for him. </p>
<p>“Moving slow won’t spare you having to go outside, you little shit!.” Vernon cuffed Harry on the side of his head again, and then grabbed him by the hair. “I’m sick of your stink. Petunia will have to deal with your mess.“ Despite the pain in his side and his head, Harry kept a tight hold on his blanket. Since he was going to have to sleep outside, he didn’t want to drop it and not have any covering. Even if the blanket smelled like urine, it was better than nothing. Pulling Harry by his hair, Vernon dragged the limp boy to the back door, opened it, and tossed Harry into the back yard. “We will see how we are feeling tomorrow, if we let you come back in.” He shut the door and threw the lock. Heaven forbid the nasty little thing try to creep back in while they were sleeping. Petunia, sensitive to the cleanliness of her house, had already dealt with the mess in the hallway; one might never have known anything happened.</p>
<p>Vernon looked at his wife lovingly. “What’s for dinner, pet?”</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>Severus appeared on the corner of Privet Drive in Little Whinging, and looked around at the utterly bland houses. He wore a black suit with a Mandarin collar and black trousers, reminiscent of his teaching robes but not out of place on a Muggle street. He moved into the shadows of a large tree and disillusioned himself and began to make his way to the ordinary and boring house labeled Number 4. Moving around the house, he began checking in the windows, looking for any indication that anything was wrong.  The inside of the house was just as ordinary as the outside, but Severus was surprised that he didn’t see any indication that Harry even lived here. There were pictures of the family, and many of a very overweight child that couldn’t possibly be Harry, but not a single picture of the child that he had been sent to check on.</p>
<p>Severus moved around to the back of the house silently, using long honed skills as a spy. He peered in the back window and watched the family eating dinner for a moment, tilting his head back and forth as he processed what he was watching. The horse-faced woman he remembered as a teen was obviously Petunia, and she now had a pinched look to her face that did not improve her appearance. Sitting across from her was a grossly overweight man with a large mustache, obviously her husband. Sitting in between them was an equally overweight child, about 6 years old, with pale blond hair and a nasty expression on his face as he demanded that his mum put more food on his plate. Severus narrowed his eyes at the scene. Where was Harry?</p>
<p>A shuddered breath from the other side of the yard caught his attention, and he quietly made his way in that direction, listening for the sound of a bark that might indicate a dog that would give away his position. As he moved closer, he could hear the sound of chattering teeth, and knew that it wasn’t a dog he was going to find. A heavy feeling in his chest was all the warning that he got that something was wrong before he realized what he was looking at. Lying under the bushes in the corner of the yard was a tiny child wrapped in a threadbare blanket. Messy black hair stuck out from the edges where the boy had wrapped the blanket around his head. This left his feet uncovered, and the boy had curled up as small as he could in an attempt to get as much of himself under the blanket as possible.  The boy shivered and his teeth chattered, but he didn’t wake up. </p>
<p>Confused at what he was looking at, Severus cast Lumos and kept the light from his wand shielded from the house by his jacket. He moved closer to the child and leaned down to look at the boy in the dim light. As light fell across the boy’s face, Severus saw a bruise spreading across from his temple to below his eye. His lip was split, and as Severus got closer he could smell urine strongly. Severus’ mind raced to piece together what he had witnessed. He dispelled the Lumos and stood up, grinding his teeth and trying to control his temper. </p>
<p>Despite his outward reaction to Albus’ request for him to check on Harry, Severus desperately wanted to protect on the child of his best friend. Unbeknownst to Albus or James Potter, Severus and Lily had mended fences and had quietly been in communication up until she had been killed. But Severus wasn’t willing to put her in danger, and after she had been killed, he felt the same way about her son. Seeing him now, sleeping out in the October cold, bruised and covered in urine, he felt an anger that he didn’t think was possible. He knew that he had to remove the child from here immediately for his own safety.</p>
<p>Not wanting to startle the young boy, Severus knelt down and ran his hand over Harry’s head. “Harry… Harry, wake up.” The little boy whimpered, but didn’t wake. Severus got down on his knees and gently moved to pull Harry out from under the hedge. Harry whimpered again, but it was less sleepy and more pained. Severus realized that he must be more injured than he thought, and his rage at the monsters that had treated a child this way grew. His own childhood abuse made the harming of a child anathema to him. Working as quickly and as gently as he could, Severus magically cleaned the blanket that wrapped Harry and used it to slide Harry out so he could pick him up, being careful to not jostle him. As Harry was lifted up, he woke briefly. He saw a man with dark hair and dark eyes, and thought that maybe he was Death. He didn’t want to die, but anything was better than the pain in his side and his head. He wished that he could have convinced his aunt and uncle to love him, even a little.  As he was lifted, Harry passed back out from the pain.</p>
<p>Without a second thought, Severus Disapparated back to Hogwarts, not realizing that Harry had woken at all. </p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>Severus appeared outside the gates of Hogwarts with his precious cargo. Not wanting to cause additional injury, he laid the boy down on the ground gently and cast Levicorpus to ensure that he wouldn't be jostled as he moved through the castle.  He began to make his way up the path, heading directly to the Hospital ward. Poppy would be able to take care of Harry while Severus dealt with the Headmaster. As Severus made his way through the castle, he recast the disillusionment charm, making sure to include Harry. It wasn’t quite curfew, and he didn’t want to have to explain why he was bringing a child much to young for Hogwarts to the Infirmary. As the ward came into view and he thought he was in the clear, Minerva stepped out of her office and right into his path. </p>
<p>“Oof! Who is that! Whatever student is there better drop the spell immediately, or I shall have to take points! You know spells aren’t allowed in the corridors!” Minerva McGonagall wasn’t going to mince words this close to curfew. Severus sighed, and then grinned. Having Minerva in his corner when dealing with the Headmaster would make getting Harry to a safe place much easier.  He quickly dropped the charm. </p>
<p>“My apologies, Minerva, I didn’t have the chance to get out of your way when you stepped out.” Minerva blinked in surprise, not only at Severus’ presence but also at his politeness. Severus was well known for being especially venomous when surprised.</p>
<p>“Not at all, Severus, but what in Merlin’s name are you doing wandering the halls disillusioned like that?” Severus’ face grew grave, and he stepped to the side so that Minerva could see the tiny figure floating behind him. “I am afraid that I am taking care of the Headmaster’s grave mistake.” Minerva gasped as she got a look at who was wrapped in the blanket. Even with the messy hair and blanket wrapped around him, the scar on his forehead was clear. </p>
<p>“What on… “ Minerva was going to exclaim about his presence here in the castle, but spotted the bruise developing along the side of Harry’s face and she puffed up like an angry cat. “Oh, oh no…” She looked back at Severus. “What are you waiting for?!?” She began to make her way in the direction of the Hospital ward, making it clear to Severus that she was going to be going with him to help Harry. Smirking internally, Severus followed. There was nothing like having the Transfiguration professor and Deputy Headmistress in your corner. As they walked up to the doors to the ward, Severus disillusioned Harry again, in case there were students behind the doors. </p>
<p>Minerva walked in first and glanced around the ward to see if there were any students in the beds. Seeing that the ward was empty, she opened the doors to give Severus room to bring Harry in. Madam Pomfrey bustled out from her office, notified by the charm on the doors that let her know when she had a new arrival. </p>
<p>“Minerva… and Severus? This is a surprise. What can I do for you this evening?” Both Severus and Minerva had grim looks on their faces, and Pomfrey was surprised when a tiny child appeared between the two of them, hovering over to the bed closest to the back. Madam Pomfrey looked between the two of them, and then at the child in shock. Why had they brought such a tiny child to her? Then she saw the boy’s face, and the scar, and she knew. </p>
<p>“Oh, Morgana, what happened to you, little one?” Madam Pomfrey had dealt with child abuse before, as the mediwitch for such a large institution, but it broke her heart every time. She ran her wand over the child and began to diagnose the injuries to Minerva and Severus. “Orbital fracture, left side. Multiple broken ribs, broken left arm. One of the ribs has punctured his spleen… Oh, I want to strangle the person that did this!” Poppy's eyes welled up with tears at the amount of pain that the little boy had to be in. Then her eyes hardened and she turned to Severus and Minerva. "You are dealing with this, yes?" It was so rare for the gentle mediwitch to lose her temper, so seeing her ferocity just meant that Severus had another ally in his pocket. </p>
<p>“Ladies, if you will excuse me, I have to go relay this to the Headmaster.” Minerva looked up at him. “Don’t think for a single second, my lad, that I am going to let you go up there alone. I am going as well. “Minerva’s accent was showing, and she began to make her way towards the door of the infirmary. Severus turned back to Madam Pomfrey. </p>
<p>“Please, don’t let him out of your sight until I come back. We need to make sure that he’s safe. “ Pomfrey merely nodded, busy on the charms that she was using to heal the tiny child in the middle of the bed. Severus followed Minerva out of the infirmary and through the halls, listening to her mutter under her breath. “Bloody Muggles, I KNEW that we never should have left him there. I ought to go there and give them a piece of my mind..”.  Severus knew that no matter what else happened, watching Minerva go off on Albus was going to be the highlight of the evening.</p>
<p>The gargoyle that guarded Albus’ office moved out of the way as they approached, indicating that Albus knew they were coming. Minerva stomped up the stairs, her temper evident in her carriage and demeanor, and Severus glided behind her, his face impassive. As they got to the top of the stairs, the door swung open. Albus didn’t even get up from his seat behind the desk. </p>
<p>“Ah, Severus, glad you are back. And how is young Harry this evening? Everything resolved? Surely a simple disagreement with his cousin? I noticed that that he seemed fine again not long after you left. “ Albus was reading through notes on his desk, and didn’t notice that Minerva was in the room until she stomped over to his desk and slammed her hand down sharply. </p>
<p>“Disagreement with his cousin? Seemed alright? Albus, I am going to be quite up front with you, but what in BLOODY HELL do you mean, was okay? He’s NOT FINE!” Albus looked up sharply, blinking in surprise at Minerva’s withering tone. Severus stood back in the middle of the room, letting her take the lead. “That young boy has been beaten to within an inch of his life, and had Severus not brought him here there is no telling what further injuries would have been done to him. Or, indeed, how long he would have been able to survive in that place. What did I tell you? I told you when we left him there 5 years ago that those people were the worst kind of Muggles, and I was right. I was more that right, because they were not only the worst kind of Muggles, but they were the worst kind of humans!” Minerva barely stopped to catch a breath while she ranted at Albus, and was breathing hard in her rage. </p>
<p>“Minerva, please calm down. I am sure that it wasn’t that bad. Corporal punishment is, while not our way, very common in the Muggle world…” Albus didn’t get the chance to finish what he was saying before Severus interrupted him harshly. </p>
<p>“Corporal punishment? No, Albus, that was not what this was.  That boy was sleeping out in the yard, with nothing but a piss-soaked blanket that I wouldn’t leave for a dog. He’s got broken bones all over, and Madam Pomfrey was quite overwrought when she saw him. She's not sure that the child would have survived the night.“ Severus exaggerated a little to make Albus feel worse, but Minerva didn't contradict him. Albus narrowed his eyes. He’d been out-maneuvered by Severus, and he knew that there was no way that he was going to be able to put Harry back in the Muggle world without a quarter of his staff blowing everything out of proportion. Well, Albus thought, if he couldn’t keep Harry under his thumb with the Muggles, than he would just have to keep him close in a different way. He made sure that his face reflected the deep sadness that he should have felt, instead of the frustration that his plans would have to change. </p>
<p>“Oh, that poor boy. This is just awful. Well, he certainly cannot go back and live with his relatives any longer. “ Albus appeared to think for a moment, before his eyes settled on Severus and seemed to lighten with an idea. “Severus, as you were so kind as to bring him to us, I am placing Harry in your care. Permanently.” Severus kept his mind impassive, let a sneer cross his face and put as much resentment as he could into his voice. “You mean to saddle me with James Potter’s whelp?” Internally, he was dancing with joy. Being given the chance to take care of Lily’s child was like light coming down from the heavens to bless him. This way, he could be closer to the only part of her that remained. </p>
<p>“Now Severus, that’s not fair. James grew up to be a good man, and at one point in time Lily was your best friend. Taking care of their child will be a challenge, but I think it will be good for you. Perhaps it will help you move past your resentment of the past.” Albus was very proud of himself for thinking of it. Severus would keep Harry under wraps and humble, if only because of his seething resentment for James Potter. </p>
<p>Severus nodded his assent at Albus. “If that is all, I will return to the Infirmary to check on my new ward.” Severus turned and walked back out of Albus’ office. Minerva stayed where she was, looking down at Albus with narrowed eyes. </p>
<p>“You put that boy with the Muggles, and now you are going to have the one person in the world who hates him be his guardian? Albus, what are you thinking?” Minerva was sure that Albus was starting to grow senile. </p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Minerva, this will work out well for everyone in time.” Albus nodded to himself, trying to appear wise. Minerva just continued to glare down at him. </p>
<p>“I hope you are right.”</p>
