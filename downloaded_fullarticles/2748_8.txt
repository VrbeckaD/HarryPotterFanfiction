    <p>Mornings are the hardest.</p><p>You relive the Battle of Hogwarts every single night. The scenes play out in quick succession beneath you, like you are a spirit floating above it all, a ghost that cannot leave. From the top-down, you see: Fred and George leaning over the balcony, staring out into the night; the Death Eaters approaching the school grounds, a mass of dark hoods and jeering faces; Fred’s lips pressed against yours, feather-light in the midst of war; him laughing as you say that he isn’t allowed to die, because “if you die, I’ll kill you”. You see Fred smiling at you in that bold, mischievous way of his. </p><p>“I won’t,” he replies. “I have to marry you after this, remember?”</p><p>The cruel film continues, hurtling relentlessly toward the final scene: Fred’s laughter; his elation at hearing his estranged brother making a joke; the blast that kills him, sending his body to the floor; his frozen smile and unseeing eyes; the crying from his mother, from you, from his twin. You see yourself begging him to say something—<em>anything.</em> Please, Fred, <em>please. Anything. Anything… This smile cannot be his last.</em></p><p>Mornings are the hardest, because for a moment, it all feels like a bad dream.</p><p>It is especially hard today, because you are woken up by Fred’s voice.</p><p>“Why the long face, George?” you hear Fred saying. Groggily, you rise from your bed, wondering why Fred had crawled out of bed without waking you up. When you walk out into the hallway, you realize that the two brothers are in the washroom. After a pause, you hear Fred joke, “Wow, do I also look this terrible when I’m sad?”</p><p>More silence. You envision George rolling his eyes. You’ve been friends with the two of them for seven years, and you’ve heard this banter before, and you’re ready to hear George say, <em>“Nah, mate, you look worse. I’m the better looking twin, remember?”</em></p><p>But he doesn’t say that today. Instead, George gives a shaky little laugh—the same one that had left him during the funeral, the one that always dissolves into agonized, silent tears. It is this laugh that forces it all to come rushing back to you—</p><p>Fred is <em>gone. </em></p><p>“Cut me some slack, you git,” George finally says. “I’m in mourning.”</p><p>The washroom door is ajar. You glance through the opening and see that George is alone. He is leaning against the washroom sink, looking into the face of his reflection. He is smiling, but his cheeks are wet.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>During your fourth year, the twins decided to play a joke on you that left you mortified for weeks afterward. To this day, you still don’t really understand why they thought it’d be a good idea. It was all Fred’s idea, George had confessed afterward. You had believed him, of course, because Fred was always the instigator.</p><p>It had happened during a lovely spring morning. You remember having taken off your robes because the sun was making you so hot. Fred had told you to meet him at the lake, near enough to the Whomping Willow to enjoy the romance of its budding leaves, but far away enough so that it would not harass you. You saw him immediately and, without thinking, ran over and greeted him with a kiss on the cheek. It was chaste, but enthusiastic. This was absolutely normal behaviour—you were young and excited to see your first ever boyfriend.</p><p>Curiously, Fred made a face and jerked back, clearly disconcerted. From behind the nearby tree, you heard the other twin yell, “<em>Oi! </em>You weren’t supposed to do that! You weren’t supposed to kiss me right off the bat!” He ran out from his hiding spot, dodging a half-hearted swing from the Whomping Willow.</p><p>Something clicked, and your jaw dropped. Staring at the boy in front of you, you yelled, “<em>George!?”</em></p><p>He only smiled, apologetic.</p><p>“I’m <em>so </em>sorry!” you cried. “It’s just… you look just like him!” Of course, this went without saying, but you were unable to give a better explanation in your mortified state.  </p><p>“He wanted to see if you’d be able to tell the difference,” George informed, seeming to recover from his embarrassment. “You know, in case one of us ever becomes evil and you have to figure out which one to kill.”</p><p>“And you couldn’t tell the difference!” Fred cried. He immediately grabbed George by the shoulder, rubbing vigorously at the spot where you’d kissed him. George protested immediately, trying to wiggle out of his brother’s grasp.</p><p>“Ow—<em>geroff!”</em></p><p>Fred continued, ignoring his brother’s suffering as he continued to scrub your kiss off his cheek. “You need to be more careful than that!” he scolded you, but you could tell that he was trying to hide a smile. “George is the evil twin, you know. You need to be able to tell us apart.”</p><p>“Don’t listen to him—I’m the good twin! He’s the one you’ll need to <em>stupefy</em>!”</p><p>You rolled your eyes. </p><p>“Oh, come off it. If we had just <em>talked </em>for a little bit, I would have been able to tell the difference.”</p><p>“Oh?” Both of the twins turned to you, eyebrows raised. Intensely curious, one of them remarked, “not even Mum can tell us apart, usually.”</p><p>“It’s easy!” You were looking at Fred now. “George can actually be sensible sometimes. <em>You’re</em> a lost cause.”</p><p>Your boyfriend gave a roaring laugh, a brilliant smile on his face.</p><p>“Right. But I’m <em>your </em>lost cause.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>George stiffens when he notices you in the reflection. It takes him a moment to figure out what to do. This had, after all, been an intensely private and absurdly <em>stupid </em>moment. He isn’t off his rocker, not yet—he knows that he needs to quit this strange habit of talking to his reflection. He’s no longer identical to Fred now that his ear is gone, anyway, so it isn’t even that convincing! But no matter how silly it is, it helps him, lets him pretend for a few, precious seconds each morning that Fred is still alive, still <em>with him</em>.</p><p>And these moments with Fred—they are private. They are not meant for you, nor anyone else. Catching you spying on him feels like a betrayal.</p><p>But when he sees your eyes glistening, he forgets his own grief.</p><p>“I’m all right.” He straightens up. “I—err—I’m not as mental as I look right now, I promise. This is just… something that I do,” he finishes lamely.</p><p>When you join him in the washroom and wrap your arms around him, he yields. Leaning into your touch, George watches the two of you in the mirror, your bodies pressed together in grief.</p><p>“I’m worried about you,” you whisper. You aren’t crying, but your reflection looks almost there. George’s chest has ached so much over the past few weeks that it shocks him when he feels the pain worsen. He hadn’t thought it possible.</p><p>“You don’t have to,” he promises you.</p><p>For a moment, the two of you just stand there. George wraps his arms around you, holds you close—comforts you the way that Fred would have wanted. Your head is buried into his chest, so you don’t notice what he sees in the mirror: his brother with his sweetheart, holding her close. It is like Fred is still here, still with you, and the two of you can still live out your long lives together… it is like George is the one who died—</p><p>—<em>should </em>have died, he can’t help but think.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="left"> “<em>Amortentia</em>,” you said, thrusting the potion out at the twins. “Strongest love potion in the textbook. D’you think I managed all right? I’m two years behind you, so I haven’t done this in class yet.”</p><p>George shrugged as he took the flask from you, seeming unbothered. “It’ll be better anything the two of us will ever come up with. We both got T’s on our Potions OWLs.”</p><p>“Yeah, remember when <em>I </em>tried to make amortentia?” Fred grinned. George chortled.</p><p>“Lee threw up for about half the day!”</p><p>“Oh…” Your eyebrows shot up, and you stared uncertainly at the liquid in George’s hands. It looked right, with its clear consistency and mother-of-pearl sheen, and it <em>smelled </em>right, too, like something between newly baked sweets, old broomsticks, and fresh grass. In other words, it smelled like<em> Fred</em>.</p><p>Still, you had never done this before, and you definitely didn’t want to poison anyone.</p><p>“Well, then, careful with that. Do you want to test it before using it on someone?”</p><p>“Only one way to test it, love!” Fred snatched the flask from George’s hands, swirling it around and inhaling deeply, as though he were sampling a vintage wine. “Smells like you! Good start. Bottoms up!”</p><p>“You know, mate,” George interjected before his brother could start drinking, “given the fact that your girlfriend brewed the love potion, I don’t think you’ll feel anything if it <em>is </em>working. Doesn’t sound like a useful test.”</p><p>Fred frowned, though you could tell that he wasn’t truly upset.</p><p>“Well, I’m not letting <em>you </em>have it,” he exclaimed at George. To emphasize his point, he threw an arm around you, pulling you in close. You squealed at the sudden motion, but he didn’t relent. “You’re not allowed to fall in love with my girlfriend!”</p><p>George didn’t seem too bothered at the mild accusation. “Not what I was suggesting, actually.”</p><p>“I don’t want <em>Lee</em> to fall in love with my girlfriend either!”</p><p> George snapped his fingers. “Darn.”</p><p>You giggled. “It’s fine, guys. Love potions don’t make people develop proper feelings—they just drive infatuation. You’ll basically follow me around like a puppy and act absolutely obsessed over me if this works.”</p><p>“Oh, but I’m <em>already </em>absolutely obsessed with you—”</p><p>“He really is,” George interjected. “Won’t shut up about you. Cuts into my sleep, you know.”</p><p>“You won’t notice a difference!”</p><p>You raised a brow. “But doesn’t that mean that George is—”</p><p>George was right, you wanted to say. It would be a meaningless test if Fred wouldn’t act any differently should the potion work. But he only grinned and said, “Cheers!” before downing the whole thing. Your face fell into your hands. You might have just poisoned your boyfriend, all because he needed some love potions for his up-and-coming joke shop.</p><p>“<em>Muffliato </em>charms before bed it is, then,” George said dryly.</p><p>As it turned out, Fred <em>was </em>head over heels for you already. His behaviour hardly changed, except he became unbearably public about his affection over the next twenty-four hours. Rather than snogging you in deserted corridors and waiting until the common room emptied out before locking you in his arms and spinning you about, he did those things in front of <em>everyone. </em>But the actions were all the same, and George found that he lost no more sleep than usual that night.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p align="center"> </p><p>You’ve convinced yourself that this is the best way to cope. George has withdrawn from the rest of his family, unable to stand The Burrow with the absence of his brother. You know just a little bit about what it’s like for him: it is strange visiting a place that you consider home without seeing the person who’d <em>made</em> it home. It is the place where the emptiness of a world without Fred feels the greatest, and George cannot stand that cold void. It is probably also worse, you think, because Mrs Weasley keeps slipping and calling him Fred. You do not blame her, because even when they were alive, she sometimes mixed them up.</p><p>Still, neither of you can stand it.</p><p>So you’ve kept to the flat above the joke shop, which is where you’d been living anyway. Multiple times, you’ve thought about moving out, but George always insists that you should stay. “Fred will,” he repeatedly says, “come back as a poltergeist and drop dungbombs into my bed daily if I leave you alone. Also, I’ll go absolutely mad if have no one to talk to here.”</p><p>“Right.” At this, you always smile encouragingly. “I’d go mad without you too, you know.”</p><p>But a part of you thinks that you <em>are </em>going mad staying with him. This flat is the first home that you’ve ever shared with him. You can feel Fred’s absence here more than anywhere else, no matter how hard George is clearly trying to fill it. You can taste it in your tea in the morning, because George hasn’t quite figured out the amount of sugar and milk to add, but Fred had always been spot on about it. You can hear it George’s voice, sometimes uncertain in his jokes because he no longer has Fred to play off. You can feel it in the empty space next to you in bed, in the absence of arms around you, the unsettling feeling that you are forever waiting for a punch line that will never come.</p><p>Sometimes, though, George is incredibly <em>good </em>at filling the absence. Sometimes he keeps you company in the washroom in the morning, the two of you just brushing your teeth together and bantering with mouths full of toothpaste. Sometimes, when your eyes are heavy with tears, he holds you tight and it feels the way that Fred did it: with his arms tight around you, with the smell of broomsticks and the fresh outdoors, and it hurts so bad. Sometimes he looks at you over breakfast, and you are floored by the warmth in his brown eyes, the way that his face is carved exactly like Fred’s.</p><p>You should have seen it coming. You should have known that at some point, the loneliness of your bed would become too great. You should have known that at some point, squeezing your eyes shut and trying to imagine his sleeping body beside yours would no longer be enough. You should have known that you’d eventually knock on George’s door, needing him to fill up the emptiness at night. Your body is abused with sobs by the time he opens the door, each one wracking the inside of your chest with pain.</p><p>“I c-can’t stand it anymore,” you say, and you hate how your voice sounds: pathetic and blubbering and so <em>childish</em>. “I just—I <em>can’t. </em>He used to sleep beside me, a-and it feels so <em>cold </em>now, and—please, make it <em>stop.</em>”</p><p>George is nothing but sympathetic when he holds you and invites you into his room. At your insistence and scattered pleas, he allows you to sleep next to him in bed. He does not hold you, of course, because just his presence is all you need. When you wake up in the middle of the night and glance over to the man who looks just like your deceased lover—well, it is enough. It helps you pretend that Fred is alive, if just for a few, precious seconds each night.</p><p>Given all of this, you should have seen it coming that simply living together would not be enough for either of you.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Long after the love potion wore off, Fred had remained absurdly affectionate. It was a bit embarrassing, and made you go red in the hallways every time he insisted on kissing you up and down your neck, but in his words—“I got a taste of what it’s like to do this all the time! And I rather like it. I’m not going to quit!” And George, ever the enabler, only laughed at the two of you and egged him on, so Fred never ended up stopping.</p><p>He’d also become more upfront about his feelings. That had been odd, at first. The Weasley twins always seemed too busy cracking jokes and pulling pranks to really talk about <em>feelings</em>. It had only come up a couple of times ever before, but now, Fred seemed to be full of these moments. “Well, you know how mad I am over you now,” Fred had explained. “No point hiding it!”</p><p>And so, completely transparent about his intentions, Fred one day brought up the future.</p><p>“George and I are going to drop out of school,” he said. You might have been worried about other Gryffindor students overhearing his plans, but he held you so closely that most of them tried pointedly to avoid looking at you. Somehow, you found it hard to look at him, too. You still enjoyed the heat of his body pressed up against you, of the scent of him, just as potent as <em>amortentia</em>. But actually looking at him, meeting his eyes? It was easy to stare at the crackling fire in front of you instead. For a few moments, you let the sound of splitting wood fill the silence.</p><p>“Yes,” you finally replied after a few moments, voice hushed. “I know.”</p><p>“I still wish you would come.”</p><p>“…I know.”</p><p>“But you won’t, will you?”</p><p>“I want to finish up school, Fred. You know that.”</p><p>“Yeah.” You felt him deflate a bit. “It’s not that I don’t want you to. It’s just… you know, with that old hag in charge, and with you alone…”</p><p>“I won’t be alone. I’ll have Hermione and Ron and Neville and Seamus, and I guess Harry whenever he isn’t too stressed over the whole You-Know-Who thing.”</p><p>“Yeah, but… <em>I </em>won’t be there for you.”</p><p>“You will be, still, even if not in person,” you assured him. “And I’ll take every chance to visit you.”</p><p>Something you said made him straighten up. He leaned forward, pecking you on the cheek.</p><p>“So we’ll try the long distance thing?” he asked, sounding much brighter.</p><p>You bit your lip, trying not to smile too much.</p><p>“We’ll <em>nail </em>the long distance thing, Fred.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>He is trying his best. George thinks quite honestly that the two of you need each other, that the both of you would go mad without the other. But the situation has quickly presented a dilemma, an awful Catch-22: though the two of you would go mad without the other, you seem to be losing your minds living together as well.</p><p>He thinks that it’s more his fault than yours. George keeps dreaming about his twin, of his other half, dying. He keeps agonizing at night, wishing that he had been quicker to react and pushed Fred out of the way and taken the hit instead. In these fantasies, Fred is alive and you are happy and mum is well and he would not have to look at his reflection in the morning and think of his dead brother. Of course, all of you would have to mourn, but he just <em>knows </em>that it would have been easier if it had been him and not Fred… because Fred had always been slightly better at starting jokes and lightening up the atmosphere, and Fred had always loved you so much, and you would not feel the absence of George in the way that you feel the absence of Fred, like a long, happy life has been robbed from you. </p><p>Fred had simply been more… deserving.</p><p>George turns to look at you.You are sleeping in his bed, as is usual now, and he can’t help but find you beautiful in moments like these. Though your expression is finally peaceful, he can see tear tracks at your cheekbones. He likes to think, as he falls into slumber, that he has been easing this pain for you. He has always loved you as a friend, always cherished the relationship between you and Fred, and had looked forward to having you become his sister-in-law. If only Fred were alive—you would be less sad, and less empty…</p><p>Sleepily, he continues to stare at you. The tear stains run all the way down to your parted lips.</p><p>It isn’t about him wanting you, although George isn’t stupid enough to deny that you are a very want-able person. He’s always been able to see why Fred had fallen in love with you.</p><p>He’d just always stopped himself from thinking about it too long in the past.</p><p><em>In the past.</em> </p><p>But it isn’t about you, not really. It’s more about Fred.</p><p>Still, it feels like a betrayal.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">When Bill and Fleur got married, it had felt like a dream: a reprieve from a looming war, one where you were able to step into a fantasy. Part of the dream, of course, was that you and Fred were not constantly thinking about what it would be like to die. Instead, there were countless days before the two of you, and you constantly imagined all the things you’d like to do with Fred with this time, most of them rather cliché and mundane: you would help them out at the shop, someday get a real career of your own, have an outdoors wedding, have babies with him, grow old with him. Happiness seemed to stretch out before you in these moments, full of infinite possibilities.</p><p>So at Bill and Fleur’s wedding, twirling in Fred’s arms with your dress flaring around your knees, you impulsively decided to indulge in that dream. You needed to say it in that moment, because you knew that either of you could die any day.</p><p>You kissed him deeply, and looked up at him.</p><p>“Let’s get married,” you blurted out.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Married. Us.” You frowned a little bit. “You’ve never thought about it?”</p><p>“’course I’ve thought about it! Don’t be silly.” Fred grinned. “But you know, you’re still a bit young. I mean, you’re of age—but you’re of <em>Ron’s</em> age, and he’s definitely too young to be married.” He made a face. “That’d be weird.”</p><p>You gave him a <em>look. </em></p><p>“Hate to break it to you, but I’m <em>always </em>going to be Ron’s age.”</p><p>“Well, that complicates things. You think you can manage aging a little faster? George and I perfected that aging potion for the Triwizard Tournament, you know…”</p><p>You hit him—lightly and harmlessly and just on the shoulder, but you smacked him all the same, laughing. “The two of you got caught and sprung beards, Fred. You looked like Merlin.” You tilted your head when the laughter died down, watching him carefully. “So does this mean you’ll never want to marry me?”</p><p>He looked aghast at the accusation.</p><p>“No! Of course I want to marry you. Just… later. When Ron is older.”</p><p>You snorted.</p><p>“…you sure?”</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>“I’m holding you to that.”</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>“I’m holding <em>you </em>to that too. You’ve made the absurd decision to marry Fred Weasley, and there’s no backing out!”</p><p>“Are you proposing to me?”</p><p>He didn’t miss a beat.</p><p>“Yep. You’re my fiancée now. Sorry!”</p><p>You giggled, and he spun you again. A light flashed in the corner of your eye, followed by the whirring sound of a Polaroid printing from a camera. The two of you had been captured on film, your dance and engagement immortalized—evidence of the long life stretching before the two of you.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>But the long life is gone now. There will be no more dances, no home together, no marriage, no babies. You are alone, cut off from that infinite, happy path, left only to mourn it. You’ve kept the photo, of course, and looking at it is the only way you can pretend that your life is as it once was. You have watched Fred spin you a thousand times, pulling you toward him and kissing you silly... You always close your eyes after and try to recall how his hand had felt on your waist, the precise feeling of his lips, how he had laughed in that moment...</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>One day, George visits you on campus. On the weekdays, you often return to Hogwarts to study part-time, as many other veteran seventh years are doing to finish their NEWTs. George routinely checks up on you, smuggling Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes and other contraband to cheer you up. The two of you visit your old haunts: the secret passages, the Gryffindor commons, the lakeshore by the Whomping Willow, <em>just </em>out of its reach. One day, when the two of you are treading through the snow by the lake, naked tree branches in the corner of your eye, you find yourself looking up at him. Inappropriately, your mind wanders to that silly prank that the two of them had played on you…</p><p>You stare at him. Your voice is calm, as smooth as the lake surface. It is so cold that your breath mists at your lips.</p><p>“Do you remember when you and Fred played that joke on me?”</p><p>George only nods, as though this is a normal question.</p><p>“I still stand by it, you know. He was the evil twin.”</p><p>You laugh a little bit.</p><p>“You don’t have to worry. I can tell the difference.”</p><p>A pause. The two of you just stare, studying each other’s expressions. His eyes are the same warm brown, and the lines in his face are the exact same as when Fred is stressed… His build is the same too, even if his shoulders are slumping a bit, weighed down by the aftereffects of war and loneliness and loss.</p><p>“Not by looking, you couldn’t,” George points out.</p><p>“No.” You take a step closer. <em>Stupid, stupid,</em> you think to yourself, but you’ve been going mad for <em>ages</em> now, not knowing what to do with the emptiness of the flat… “I’m still sorry about the mistake. It’s just… you look just like him.”</p><p>He leans down.</p><p>“I’m sorry, too. That I look like him.”</p><p>The two of you are silent. After their growth spurt a few years back, the twins had sprung up like beans, and you have to stand on your toes—just the way you did with Fred…</p><p>Your lips are hesitant at first. They brush against each other slowly, haltingly, because the both of you know that this is wrong and that you’re going mad and that this will not cure your grief. But when you are pressed together like this, the yawning cavern of loneliness feels a little less cold. It is substituted by the foolish memory of Fred, his skin pressed against yours, wonderfully hot in the winter chill…</p><p>But it is not really his skin, you tell yourself. Pausing, you consider stopping.</p><p>But then George is pulling you by the waist and his hand is cupping your cheek and you have reached up and threaded your fingers through his hair. Before you know it, the two of you are pressed against each other, panting into the other's mouth, tongues working desperately to swallow each other’s grief. Your hot breaths cloud around your faces, hiding your lips.</p><p>And his lips feel so much like Fred’s, and you know you are being unfair to them both, but you cannot stop.</p><p align="center"> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p>“…wow.”</p><p>Fred collapsed on top of you, still out of breath. Your bodies were coated with sweat, but you didn’t care, only hugging him closer. At the foot of the bed, your feet absently tapped at his, and he responded in kind.</p><p>“You take my virginity,” you said after a few moments, “and all you can say is ‘<em>wow</em>’?”</p><p>“You <em>aren’t </em>going to say wow? I’m hurt. I thought I did a good job!”</p><p>“Hm... I guess it was okay,” you teased. “I’d rate you an ‘O’.”</p><p>“Incredible! The first ‘O’ I’ve ever gotten! Take that, OWLs!” You snorted. “I’m not surprised, of course—you <em>did </em>keep saying that.” He propped himself up on an arm, looking at you in the face as he impersonated you: “‘<em>Ohhhh, Fred, please don’t stop! Ohh, I’m going to—’</em>”</p><p>“Merlin, <em>shut up</em>!” You smacked him. “I hate you!”</p><p>Of course, you didn’t. It was quite the opposite, and he knew that at this point, and had acted in kind. Fred had been careful with his hands, fretting over almost every detail, because he wanted your first time to be perfect. He had asked over and over if this was okay, if you were in pain, telling you not to worry because he’d made sure that the two of you were being safe. He’d been so gentle and affectionate with you, and it didn’t hurt at all, and you’d felt feather-light the whole time, telling him <em>I love you, I love you, I love you,</em> into his ear. You’d held each other so fiercely during every second, as though the moment either of you let go, one of you would float away…</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>George thinks he’s finally lost his mind.</p><p>Both of you <em>know </em>that this is wrong, but you barely make it home anyway. As soon as the front door swings shut behind you, he is pulling you toward the bedroom, and you are not resisting, and your clothes keep falling, falling, falling, shedding like snakeskins. And he has never felt your bare skin before, but it is impossibly familiar and comforting, like your flesh was made for him—even though you’ve never belonged to him. As far as he is concerned, he is an imposter, an imitation of the body that is supposed to be wrapped up in yours.</p><p>He ends up pushing you against the wall, his hands traveling up and down your torso as you work on his belt. “We shouldn’t do this, we shouldn’t,” you keep whispering, but every time he moves away, you pull him down by the shoulders, and George finds it impossible to stop himself from kissing you again. Your scent is so wonderful, and your hips feel so good, and for a moment, he can’t think of anything besides your hot breath on his collarbone. It is the happiest he has been in months.</p><p>He is mad with need as he lifts you up and carries you to bed. He knocks a vase over, and his knee bangs against the bed frame, and your body lands harshly on the mattress, but neither of you flinch. George finally pauses here, wanting to ask if you are okay, remembering that he should maybe find protection—but then you are pulling at his hips, your legs are suddenly wrapped around his waist, and you are begging for him. He is on top of you, and then he is inside you, and for a few, fleeting moments, he feels the guilt ebbing away.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>You have no one to blame but yourself. You’d instigated as much as George had, and he’d actually paused multiple times, pulling back and trying to ask if you were <em>sure</em>, if you were <em>okay</em>. You could tell that he was concerned even when you cut him off, because Fred had had the exact same mannerisms... but you kept going, kept wanting to fill up the emptiness inside you. And though you’d stared at his face during the entire act, you find it hard to look at it now.</p><p>Beside you, George’s breathing has finally evened out. You feel him running a finger along your waist. It seems more clinical than sensual, and so, you glance down. Moonlight is spilling onto the bed through the window slats, illuminating finger-shaped dark spots at your hips.</p><p>“Sorry,” he whispers.</p><p>You close your eyes.</p><p>“Just a bruise. Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>“Not about that. I mean—I’m sorry about those too, the bruises. But I’m also just… <em>sorry.</em>”</p><p>Your breath hitches.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” you reply carefully, “It’s my fault.”</p><p>“Only as much as it’s mine.” Jaw clenching, you try to steady your breathing as he continues, “I’d understand, you know, if you hate me now.” George laughs a little bit, sounding broken the way he does in his early mornings alone in the washroom. “It’s been unfair of me to ask you to stay with me this whole time, when you look at me and keep thinking of <em>him</em>—and it was unfair of me to do this with you—and it’s unfair that it’s <em>me </em>beside you right now, and not <em>him</em>—”</p><p>His voice breaks off just as you turn to him. It is childish of you to starting crying, but you can’t help yourself.</p><p>“Oh, <em>George,</em>” you breathe, and he flinches when you say his name. You reach out, cupping his face and thumbing his jaw, your finger running along his cheekbone until it reaches the scar where his ear used to be. “Please, <em>please </em>don’t say that. His death was unfair, but <em>you’re </em>not. It’s… you just <em>can’t </em>think that way about yourself… this is why I’m worried about you,” you finish helplessly. You know that he’s been suffering, but you didn’t know that it would be this bad: that he would look at you, and accuse himself for causing your grief.</p><p>He doesn’t seem to hear your words.</p><p>“You can leave me,” he says. “You’re allowed to.”</p><p>You curl up against his body, fingers still resting upon his face.</p><p>“Am I allowed to stay instead?”</p><p>George doesn’t reply to that, just pulls you close and holds you tighter. His body is warm and coated in sweat and he smells almost like love potion, so you don’t protest, simply trying to press yourself closer to him. It is unfair of you to do this, but it would be more unfair for you to go.</p><p>“I won’t leave,” you reassure him, and the two of you lie there for the rest of the night, facing each other. Neither of you are willing to fall asleep, and neither of you are willing to talk, too afraid of what is waiting in your dreams…</p><p> </p>
