    <p>It was astounding, really, what could change in a matter of mere months.</p>
<p>After the night that most students were referring to as the “Battle of the Astronomy Tower”, everything had changed. The rumors had buzzed frantically around the school in the weeks before the end of term, before Dumbledore’s funeral, before you had all been sent home. Some of them, of course, were outrageous, some plausible. </p>
<p>But there seemed to be a certain, painful consistency: the involvement of the boy you wished you could stop loving.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy had smuggled Death Eaters into the school. </p>
<p>Draco Malfoy had cast the Dark Mark over the Astronomy Tower. </p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore had been murdered on the Astronomy Tower.</p>
<p>The Death Eaters had fled, Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape among them.</p>
<p>The students were pretty evenly split about whether or not it had been Draco or Snape that had cast the actual Killing Curse.</p>
<p>Those last two weeks you had spent the great majority of your time in your Prefect bedroom, hardly leaving for meals and certainly not going to your alcove. After keeping your promise to Draco and staying there a whole evening, listening to shouts and screams and explosions coming from around the castle, the desire to return there at the end of last term had been nonexistent.</p>
<p>You had also had little desire to be around the other students, to hear Draco’s name and his misdeeds on their lips. It gave you too many conflicting feelings.</p>
<p>The summer had also been like a sort of hell.</p>
<p>After the Ministry officially fell it finally really hit you that things were going to become very deadly indeed. Things got worse: a Muggleborn Registration Commission was formed at the Ministry. Attendance at Hogwarts was made compulsory. People and entire families were going on the run, leaving empty houses behind. You and your mother both begged your father to leave England, to take his boyfriend, but he refused.</p>
<p>And You-Know-Who was in Draco Malfoy’s house, and you had no way of knowing if he was dead or alive, or what was happening to him over the long, hot weeks of July and August.</p>
<p>You began having nightmares. </p>
<p>Mostly they involved the death of your father, or your mother, or Draco, and you would wake, gasping, trying to shake the images of their pale skin and lifeless eyes from your mind. It never seemed to work.</p>
<p>The only good thing that could be said about the summer was that it was giving you plenty of time to practice Occulumency. It was a better alternative to your feelings, anyway, and so when you felt the prickling sensation of fear or anxiety choking you, or when Draco’s face appeared in your consciousness, giving you a spike of sadness through the stomach, you practiced. You cleared your mind and you counted and you did it for hours.</p>
<p><em>Clear your mind</em>, you would tell yourself. <em>Compartmentalize.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes it backfired, though, when you heard these words in his voice.</p>
<p>This meant that not only was your Legilimency becoming something that could easily be called a <em>power</em> – something that you could tap into at will rather than something that controlled you, as long as you were in smaller groups or no one was touching you – but also that your relationship with your parents was actually improving.</p>
<p>September 1<sup>st</sup> came, and you were both terrified and relieved. </p>
<p>Hogwarts belonged to the Death Eaters, but you would finally at least know if Draco was alive.</p>
<p>And indeed, the first thing you did when you arrived on the platform of the Hogwarts Express was sweep it frantically with your eyes, searching for that familiar platinum blonde head.</p>
<p>It was easy to spot, both due to his trademark hair and his height.</p>
<p>He seemed to have grown even taller since you had last seen him. The relief at seeing him alive was so powerful that you had to tightly grip the handlebars of your trolley to keep from falling over. You couldn’t see his face; he wasn’t looking your direction, but was instead talking to a woman that you assumed to be his mother, Narcissa Malfoy.</p>
<p>You quickly looked away, suddenly determined to get into the train as quickly as possible. Looking at him after the initial relief – even just the back of his head – was too painful, and you found that you were now struggling with multiple emotions, making you breathless: guilt, anger, a pang of longing. </p>
<p>You hated them.</p>
<p><em>Compartmentalize</em>, you reminded yourself, but the voice that whispered the word in your ear was his, and for a moment you thought you could recall the taste of his lips on yours.</p>
<hr/>
<p>When you made your way to the prefect compartment in the afternoon accompanied by Ernie Macmillan, you got a particular shock when you slid the door open, because Draco was sitting there in the compartment next to Pansy Parkinson, who was, you were irritated to see, clutching rather tightly to his arm and sitting nestled into his side.<br/><br/>You stopped dead in the doorway.</p>
<p>He hadn’t been a prefect last year. He had given it up. He had told you that.</p>
<p>He had been too busy, too busy with…you had never known, then.</p>
<p>But now you did.</p>
<p>But here he was, apparently with prefect rights reinstated – probably because he was a fellow Death Eater, you thought rather savagely, feeling a sudden rush of anger.</p>
<p>But then you saw that you had been wrong. He wasn’t a prefect at all. There were other, younger Slytherins here with the prefect badges on their chests, and he and Pansy were wearing matching Head Boy and Girl badges.</p>
<p>He glanced up then, his eyes briefly meeting yours.</p>
<p>His expression didn’t change, but something very, very small flickered in his eyes. </p>
<p>And then it was gone, and he was looking away. Shaking yourself a little, you slowly followed Ernie into the compartment and sank into the seat beside him, taking stock of the others in the room.</p>
<p>It seemed that in the absence of Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger this year, the Gryffindor prefects would be Neville Longbottom and Parvati Patil. The Ravenclaw prefects were, of course, the same, but you didn’t recognize the two new adults in the compartment, or the two other Slytherins.</p>
<p>The new adults were a man and a woman. The man was very thin and the woman very large, and they both had a distinct glint in their eyes that you didn’t like one bit. They also had their sleeves rolled up and their wands out, proudly displaying the matching Dark Marks on their arms.</p>
<p>It was, very clearly, a show of authority. A threat.</p>
<p><em>We run your school now,</em> their arms seemed to say. <em>You can guess what will happen if you don’t comply</em>.</p>
<p>“We’re going to discuss a few changes,” said the woman in a raspy sort of voice, baring her teeth a little before giving you all a very nasty grin. “The new Headmaster has put us in charge of the prefects and punishment this year, so it’s best if you all listen very, very carefully.”</p>
<p>You shuddered a little at the way she said the word <em>punishment </em>with clear excitement in her voice.</p>
<p>“You are required to report anything that you see to us immediately. All punishments will be decided by my sister and I,” said the man roughly, glaring around at you with the unmistakable light of a challenge in his dark eyes. “Though of course, we will be kind enough to let you carry out some of them,” he finished, and the sister cackled, which made your stomach lurch.</p>
<p>Neville Longbottom shifted in his seat, but you didn’t dare look at him.</p>
<p>You already knew quite well that you’d be doing no such thing. There was no way you were handing over students from younger years to these people, who, after only a few seconds in their presence, you could already tell were clearly monsters.</p>
<p>“Furthermore,” said the man, “If you find that anyone at this school is found to be less than Halfblood, you will notify us immediately.”</p>
<p>There was a long, horrible pause.</p>
<p>“No,” growled Neville Longbottom finally. “We won’t.”</p>
<p>“Blood traitor,” drawled Draco, and your eyes immediately shot to him, widening at first but then narrowing in anger. He, however, wasn’t looking at you, but was only gazing at Neville with the look of bored disdain that he was all too good at putting on his aristocratic features.</p>
<p>You felt suddenly very sick.</p>
<p><em>Fucking Gryffindors and </em><em>their</em><em> recklessness,</em> you thought desperately, eyes darting anxiously between Neville and the two Death Eaters, who were staring at him, rather stunned. <em>Obviously we won’t do it, but to say it like this, here…you’ve already made yourself a target, Neville…</em></p>
<p>The man flicked his wand almost lazily, but the sound of the force hitting Neville’s face was so powerful that you and Parvati both gasped, and even Pansy shifted a little in her seat.</p>
<p>Neville slumped over to the side a little before sitting up again with a black eye, though his back was even straighter than before and the look of defiance in his eyes was still there, if not stronger. “You will, boy, or you’ll go the same way as your parents,” sneered the man, and then he glared around at the rest of you. “Anyone else have anything to say?”</p>
<p>Everyone shook their heads quickly, eyes wide.</p>
<p>“Good. The Carrows, remember that name. I’m Amycus and my sister is Alecto. Don’t forget it. And if you don’t report anything to us for a week, we’ll know what you’re doing, and you’ll be sorry. Now get out of our sight,” Amycus Carrow spat, and you wasted no time in scrambling to your feet and rushing out of the compartment without looking back.</p>
<p>Once outside the compartment, you realized that you were shaking. You made it some way down the aisle before you turned to Ernie, pale and horrified.</p>
<p>“Are you all right, Y/N?” He stooped to look into your face in concern, placing his hands on your shoulders.</p>
<p>
  <em>Doesn’t look so good, Merlin, of course not, what the hell are we going to do…</em>
</p>
<p>You flinched at the thoughts that came stampeding into your brain at his touch – you were too shaken up to even attempt to block him – but they were suddenly interrupted by a very familiar drawl. “I’m sure she’d be much better without your ugly face right in hers, Macmillan.” </p>
<p>Ernie turned away to face Draco, who was standing in the aisle and leaning casually against one of the compartments, eyes glittering very maliciously at the other boy.</p>
<p>“Malfoy.” Ernie was puffing his chest out in the pompous manner that only Ernie seemed to know how to do. “Bet you’re loving this, aren’t you? This was the kind of school you wanted Hogwarts to be all along, wasn’t it? Death Eater. <em>Murderer</em>,” he spat viciously, in a tone that you had never even thought capable of the Hufflepuff boy.</p>
<p>Draco just smirked, apparently supremely unconcerned with Ernie’s opinion of him. “You’ve got me on the first charge. Though I’m afraid you’ve gotten some details wrong on the second one.”</p>
<p>“Come on,” you muttered to Ernie, tugging at his sleeve.</p>
<p>Draco threw you a contemptuous look when Ernie turned away, but you ignored it as best you could and continued on down to your compartment, mind racing. You had no idea how you were going to get out of reporting other students. It was sick, it was cruel, it was terrifying, and Draco’s nonchalant attitude and blood purist remark was only making you feel sicker, though you weren’t sure what you had expected from him. Wasn’t this part of the reason you had ended things?</p>
<p><em>Distance</em>, you reminded yourself. <em>Keep your distance </em><em>from him,</em><em> Y/N. </em><em>It’s best.</em></p>
<p>“What are we going to do?” Ernie asked you on the way.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” you whispered fearfully. “I really, really don’t know.”</p>
