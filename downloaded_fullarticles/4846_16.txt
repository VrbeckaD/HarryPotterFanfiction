    <p>Everyone thinks that she  is dead. Her brothers think that she is dead. Only a select few know that she is alive, and only one survives. They were killed by death eaters, by stupidity, and by spite.  Her name is Ariana Dumbledore, and this is her story.</p>
<p>Ariana Dumbledore is a mystery. She was sheltered her entire life and nobody knew much about her. The only people that knew anything about her were close family or friends of the Dumbledore’s.  She is the young witch who, at the age of six, disappeared into the house, and was never really saw again. The wizarding world only knows a tiny bit about her, and that is about to change.</p>
<p>The story that most people know is that Ariana Dumbledore  was caught performing magic in front of some Muggle children when she was six years old. The Muggle boys wanted to see the trick again, but since she was so young, she couldn’t reproduce the magic. They hurt her. She went into a state of shock and her magic never fully recovered. She would lose control of her emotions and cause magical outbursts.</p>
<p>Her father, Percival Dumbledore,  tracked down the Muggle children and hurt them. He was sent to Azkaban. He refused to tell the Ministry why he attacked the boys because Ariana would have been sent to St. Mangos.  Her mother wanted to shield Ariana from the outside world, and shield the world from Ariana, so she moved the entire family to Godric’s Hollow.</p>
<p>Aberforth Dumbledore was the only person who could calm Ariana down and keep her emotions under control. One day, Aberforth wasn’t with Ariana, and Ariana caused an explosion with her magic, killing her mother. The entire family came back to Godric’s Hollow to mourn Kendra Dumbledore. Albus ended up taking care of Ariana but he resented it.</p>
<p>While Albus was taking care of Ariana he befriended Gellert Grindelwald.  Aberforth thought that Grindelwald was distracting Albus from Ariana and the three wizards got into a heated argument. Aberforth challenged them to a duel. The duel was too much for Ariana. She tried to stop it, but was hit by a curse. </p>
<p>Today is the first time that you will hear the  true story of what really happened to the 14 year old witch who died in an unfortunate accident, which actually wasn’t an accident. You will learn about her friends, her enemies, and her protectors. Would you like to know how Ginny Weasley knew Ariana, and how Ariana is still alive? Would you like to know about her hiding places and how she is an unregistered Anamagus. This is a story of love, hate, friendship, and of course, mystery.</p>
