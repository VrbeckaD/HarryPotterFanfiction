    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p class="p2">Hermione looks up as Harry enters the room in a silk robe.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It shouldn’t have surprised her, she knew. She was used to seeing Harry dressed in the finest clothes money could buy. He was the First Lady and Tom Riddle would want him dressed properly. As though they were happily married, as if all of this was not done to keep an eye on Harry and to declare to the world that Tom has won, and their savior, their little fighter, has been defeated.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">In the past, Harry had always been in just a shirt and some jeans. When they slept, he slept in oversized shirts that were comfortable.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But now…</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry was frowning at her. Hermione knew he didn’t like it when they visited him. It was dangerous.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But this was an emergency. Harry would understand.</span>
</p><hr/>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Wrapping himself in white sheets, Harry Riddle sighed in relief when he saw that the other side of the bed was empty. <em>He</em> would be back soon, Harry thought. And it would be almost as if he was never gone.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry sits up from the bed and rings in his breakfast, stretching as he did so. Three house elves appear.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Madam,” One squeaks. “Eggs for today?” He asks, the three elves presenting Harry with elaborate trays of different types of egg dishes.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No,” Harry says absent-mindedly while running a hand through his hair. “I want french toast.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They curtsy before disappearing again. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry reaches for the Daily Prophet that one of the elves laid down on his bedside table. The blonde omega, Draco Malfoy, is on the headlines again. There probably was not anything worthwhile to report when this was all they got in their papers. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">Perhaps its true what they say, Harry thinks. For entertainment to make the front news, sex <em>does</em> sell. <em>Draco Malfoy Renews Contract with Omega Underwear.</em> What else did he do besides spread his legs for powerful men and model underwear?</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Or maybe this was one of the tactics his husband used to distract the masses from his law reforms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> T</span>he true horrors that was going on in Britain. The media was powerful and Tom would undoubtedly wield it as good as he did his words and his magic.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">They house elves appear again with Harry’s breakfast trays. Each one is carefully arranged exactly as Harry instructed them in the past.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He’s not particularly hungry. He never had an appetite on mornings like this. He had a lot of work to do, a lot of meetings to attend, and a schedule that took all of his time. But that was okay. It meant he could not think. It meant he was not alone with his thoughts.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">He snaps his fingers and again, the three house elves appear. He waves his hand to signal that he was done eating and they could start cleaning up.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Madam,” The elf calls nervously. “You barely touched your food. Sir will be angry if you don’t eat—“</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well, he’s not here, is he?” Harry says as calmly as he could. It was still so early in the morning for this. The house elf gulps and scurries to take away his breakfast. They disappear with a pop. Harry sighs as he prepares to take a bath.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This was his life now. It’s been eleven years since he married Tom Riddle. They had suffered a crushing defeat after Harry tried to take on his role as the savior. He tried killing Tom Riddle. Tried to save the whole wizarding world from his grasp. But he had lost.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And yet, Tom had offered him a union. Spare those he loved, spare the light side. They had already lost so many, Tom whispered in his ear. It would be a shame if he lost all of them now. Harry had looked desperately at the small number of people who were left fighting with him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom offered them their lives in exchange for his hand in marriage. It was time to end it, Tom said.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Maybe he was meant to be a savior in a different way.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A marriage would let the people know that the fight was over. Harry marrying Tom meant there was stability, or a show of it. It would show the wizarding world that they have come to an agreement of sorts.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Peace. Tom said it was for peace.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry turned on the faucet and relaxed in the warm water.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">He made his choice. All of them were still alive now, thanks to that choice.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry goes through today’s schedule in his head.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">First was the opening of the new Magical History Museum. That entailed wearing something formal. Maybe the white gown he received for their tenth anniversary. He hasn’t worn that yet. Then he had lunch with the Magical Children Orphan—</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Madam?” A house elf calls nervously. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What is it?” Harry asks while sighing loudly.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s—It’s madam’s friends—they—“</p>
<p class="p2">Harry gets up immediately. “Help me get dressed.”</p><hr/>
<p class="p1">"Who is it this time?" Harry asks warily. He was tired of meeting his friends only so they could report rebel activities to him. He had already left that nonsense in the past when he married Tom. It was a childish dream to try to stop the reforms, to overthrow his husband. And it put his very friends in danger.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry still remembered Tom's dangerous promise to kill all those he cared about if he ever tried to support the rebellion, if he ever talked to them. He could not forget how hard and how cold the alpha’s eyes were in his threat. And Harry knew he was not lying.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After their marriage, his friends insisted they keep him updated on the rebel's activities. But he had turned a deaf ear on them. It was for their own protection. Mostly, they would tell them of the kidnapping of key members in Tom's government.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"The time is <em>now</em>, Harry," Hermione would say eagerly. "The rebels are finally getting somewhere. We have to act now.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry would look at her. Hermione was smart, he knew. She was once called the smartest witch of her age. Back when they were still rebels. Back when they were still trying to defeat Tom Riddle. She would have figured out why Harry married Tom. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Why did he do this to him? Why did they intend on making life harder for him knowing full well what horrors his husband was capable of doing? Have they forgotten how he killed Dumbledore not even by his own hand but just by one of his loyal followers?</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">One time Hermione had the guts to finally say what she was really thinking.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Then you can finally stop pretending to be with Rid—"</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>"Hermione!</em>" Harry said, quickly shutting her up. They were being watched. Although Tom never acknowledged that his friends would talk to her about the rebels during their early years of marriage, Harry just knew that he knew.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"My child," he would say when he arrived home, his voice barely above a whisper. He would look at him coldly. His finger would trace his cheek slowly and roughly. It hurt. He wouldn’t, couldn’t hurt Harry. He was a far too valuable public figure. Any whisper of Tom hurting him would result in a scandal. Then he would drop his hand and walk away. It was a warning, a reminder of their agreement, of why he married him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"He will not let it happen," Harry whispered fiercely. "Whoever the rebels kidnapped, he will and can replace quite easily. The government continues to function. The reforms continue. Nothing can change that!"</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His outburst took Hermione and Ron by surprise. They looked at him through wide eyes as though they could not believe those words came from his mouth.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry breathed heavily. He would have never said that years ago, when he was not yet married. But he has been with Tom for eleven years. He saw his intelligence, his political manueverings. He saw how unforgiving Tom was of fools who could not do as he pleased. He had murdered Snape for allowing Harry and his friends to escape while they were still on the run. He stayed in power because he was capable of staying in power. He excelled in it.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione and Ron left her without another word, too shocked to do anything else. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Years passed and their meetings becoming less and less. He thought they had finally given up on him. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Until today.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You said it was urgent, that I should pack my fastest broom." Harry refused to bring anything. He thought it would only encourage her. Hermione looked nervous which was unlike her. “Is it Sirius?" Harry demanded. Sirius has wisely kept out of the war to survive. He had chosen to support Harry in his decision of marrying Tom for peace. The light saw this as a clear declaration of which side he belonged to. "Who is it, Hermione?"</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She looked like she was debating whether to tell him the truth or not. "It's... it's your husband," he said softly. "It's Tom Riddle, Harry. They have him.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry felt the air leave his lungs and suddenly, he could not breathe.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Impossible.</em></span>
</p><hr/>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's hands caressed the <em>Lightspeed</em>. It was light, it barely weighed like anything, yet was the fastest broom ever manufactured. It was made from the finest wood that even only the wealthiest in the whole wizarding world can afford. Harry remembered the first time he laid his eyes on them.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was their seventh anniversary, and England held their breaths as he walked down the aisle again in an emerald gown, his alpha’s colors, as they renewed their vows. It was a grand affair, and when Tom pledged himself to protect him for all his life, he placed his hand on the small of Harry’s back and kissed him. It was one of the rare moments they touched each other.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His husband was always cold and he thought of him as a child, and Harry convinced himself that their marriage did not need such petty things. It was for the peace of Britain that Harry married him, for the peace of his friends and Sirius. Tom did not expect anything but loyalty from him and Harry did not expect anything but promises kept.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom presented him with an elegantly wrapped gift after. The <em>Lightspeed</em>. In honor of his days in Hogwarts when he was still a Seeker. Also a cruel reminder of how he was not allowed to fly freely anymore. It was only for appearances. Like their marriage. Harry would never get the chance to use it.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So they went on their married life, hardly even married. They had functions to attend to distract them. His husband was the Minister of Magic, and he was the First Lady. They had their roles to play and meetings to go to.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Always busy, it was seldom that they saw each other except on events that required both their presence. But they would talk sometimes, of tedious things and their obligations to the country, but it was amicable enough. The alpha made sure Harry was doing his duties, and the omega made sure Tom was keeping his side of the bargain.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The first years of their marriage, Harry would not dare sleep on their marriage bed. He lay stiff every night, afraid that somehow he would find a way to kill him. Kill the Boy-Who-Lived. Finally rid himself of the enemy he sought to destroy since he was an infant. But as the years went by, he was able to close his eyes even just for a few minutes. Soon enough, it grew into hours, and finally, the whole night. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sometimes Tom would seek his warmth when he is deep in his sleep. Harry always managed to move away into his side of the bed. What would his dead mother and father say?</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But some nights, he let him, and even dared to move closer.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">But that was years ago, though.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry could not remember the exact time, or the exact date, but after he went into his First Lady obligations, a few brave people actively shouted their protests against him. How he was a fake savior, that he was better of dead than married to a man who was a murderer.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was one of those nights where he sought him, and feeling alone and afraid, Harry was quick to let the alpha hold him. He did not know if Tom was awake or asleep then, but ever since that night, Harry could not sleep without feeling his presence beside him, and his arms started seeking Harry almost every night. The omega found solace in his alpha. It was quite ironic, how the man he feared so much, could make him feel so safe in the darkest hours of the night.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He supposed it had to do something with their biology. He was an omega. And he was an alpha. It was only natural.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This was also why Harry kept a strict schedule of his heats. Always so diligent in updating and tracking, even a day before it happened, he already slept in a different room, spelling the rooms so no sound would escape. Tom never forced him to spend his heats with him, nor did Tom try to spend his ruts with Harry.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That was never the intention of their marriage.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">One time, though, his heat had come a week early, right after Tom was away for two weeks. They were both sleeping then, Tom unusually pressed against him more tightly than usual. And then he felt it. The pain. The desperation. Harry remembers a waking Tom through the tears in his eyes and Harry repeatedly calling for him. <em>Alpha.</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His heat lasted for four days. Harry only remembered flashes of begging Tom to take him from behind and Tom looking at him with a dark look in his eyes. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The day his heat was over, he woke up, and Tom was gone.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was sore, though, and when he tried getting up, he couldn’t walk without wincing in pain.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They never talked about it.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">It never happened again and Tom never left for more than three days afterwards.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>"Child,"</em> Tom would call him in the privacy of their home. He never called him that in public. He was always <em>‘my wife, Harry’.</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sometimes he would reprimand Harry when he failed to do his duties as the First Lady properly and other times he would want him to sit beside him after a long day at the Ministry. At first he thought it was because he thought it best to keep Harry in his sight most of the time, but his husband was proud and arrogant. He would never think for one second, that anyone could breach his security.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">One day he came home to Harry, "Child," he said, and then he kissed Harry long and hard, his one hand wrapped around the omega’s neck, and his other forcing his chin upwards. He was tall, and Harry felt the comfort of Tom wrapping his arms around him when they slept and something else… something that burned at his abdomen, and something that made him remember the only heat he spent with Tom. It made him dizzy.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry shook his head. Now was not the time to be thinking of such things. He picked up the <em>Lightspeed. </em>He stashed his wand in his sleeve.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And with one final breath, he nodded to Hermione and they were off.</span>
</p><hr/>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Colin Creevey did not know why the Minister was lounging on the chair. Even with his hands tied up behind his back and his feet bound, the man looked positively relaxed and regal—almost bored. His long legs were extended and crossed at the ankles elegantly as if he was on vacation, enjoying a warm weather at a poolside.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Scrimgeour’s going to torture you, you know,” Colin spat. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He watched as the man slowly looked in his direction, almost as if he was only realizing that there was someone in the room with him, as if Colin’s presence did not warrant any kind of attention.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom Riddle arched an eyebrow, a smirk forming in his. “Oh?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He looked so smug.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He’ll make it slow, make it hurt,” Colin taunted. “It’ll wipe that arrogant look on your face for good.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">Tom gave a lipless smile—looking amused.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m a little insulted he only put one guard on me,” he said. “And a rather… lacking one at that.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Colin’s eyes widened.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">How dare he. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man was powerless, defenseless, tied up with no way to move. Colin could start the torture now and no one would know any better. No one would care. He would probably be rewarded for his courage.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They were alone too, his comrades ordered to guard the only entrance into the rebel base. They had captured the most powerful man in Britain. The Minister’s whole army was coming for them. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">They were more than ready though. Years and years of a quiet rebellion allowed them to make magical weapons and new powerful combat spells. Now the only thing left was to take control of the Ministry, to kill its symbol of power.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Colin took a look at the man again. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">He didn’t appear the least bit worried. Colin wondered if he knew what his capture meant, what it meant for Britain, what it meant for his life. Perhaps the man only appeared to be calm. He didn’t have his wand. And even if he could do hand magic, the room didn’t allow for any type of magic to be used. It was also possible that the man was thinking of means to escape.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Colin heard whispers of the man’s frightening intelligence and cunning. But it was impossible to escape. Yes, Colin was only one man but he was one of the better fighters and was especially trained for hand-to-hand combat—the <em>muggle</em> way—and the minister was <em>old. </em>He also would not know how to fight.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom Riddle couldn’t possibly hope to escape with just his wits.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“There are more guards outside the door,” he bluffed. The man looked like he didn’t believe him at all. “And more guards at the elevators. You cannot escape.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom chuckled. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I won’t,” he said as if the mere idea was idiotic, thus supporting his earlier claim of having a… <em>lacking</em> guard.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Colin shut his mouth. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He didn’t like the way Tom made him feel—inferior, like he was a child. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But what else could he expect from the man who single-handedly took down the Order of the Phoenix and took control of the British government?</span>
</p><hr/>
<p class="p1">“Give me the floo powder!” Harry ordered the house elf. The elf scurried away immediately looking frightened. Hermione had a feeling this was not the first time Harry ordered him around in a harsh manner.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry was probably just frightened. Capturing the invincible Tom Riddle would throw Britain into chaos once it got out. For twelve years he has ruled with an iron fist and if he suddenly died… Hermione stopped pacing. Who was going to replace him? What would happen to Harry?</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Hermione looks at Harry who was wringing his hands and pacing as well. He must be thinking worst things. But he would finally be free and that was all that mattered.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Hermione interrupts Harry's pacing and tells him she has to prepare for their long travel, Harry doesn't even nod to her direction.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The poor thing.</span>
</p><hr/>
<p class="p1">The elf runs back to Harry in haste. Harry grabs the powder and throws it at the fireplace.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry, without thinking, called the Minister’s Head of Security. “Barty!” He almost screams at it.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">To his surprise, it was not a call for help that escaped his mouth the moment Barty answered.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“<em>How could you</em>?” He hissed. He did not recognize his own voice. “He trusted <em>you</em>! What were you <em>doing</em>?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Madam, we—“ Harry did not want to hear excuses. This was his head of security. Handpicked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tom was always so confident about his abilities of keeping himself safe. He hired the best fighters, trained them since boyhood, and they had <em>failed</em> him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We are going to their base.” Harry said decidedly.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“But, madam, we need a plan, we cannot just—“</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Now, Barty. Or I will tell my husband it was <em>you</em> who caused all this delay in his rescue.” He spelled Barty’s flames away and breathed. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He summoned his broom and went to where Hermione was preparing for their departure.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His husband would be <em>livid</em>.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
