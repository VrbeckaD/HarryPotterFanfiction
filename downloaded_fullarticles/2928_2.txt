    <p>A/N: This chapter's cards are "dragon dildos", " Charlie Weasley's arms", and "betraying your friend to the Dark Lord". </p><p> </p><p>Charlie weasley was a good man. He came from a good family. He had a good job. Everything was good. But it could have been <em>better</em>. Because Charlie Weasley had a problem. Working on the dragon reserve left very little time for dating, and while he'd been led to believe that potential partners would find a dragon tamer sexy, he was alone.</p><p>Charlie Weasley masturbated a lot. As a result, he had incredibly buff arms. Luckily, his family assumed that dragon taming involved some sort of physical labor when it was mostly observation and note-taking, so no one took note of his increased muscle mass.</p><p>But Charlie Weasley's arms were <em>tired.</em> It was his one weakness, really. </p><p> </p><p>Harry Piotter was a friend to Charlie. They first met when Harry was just a little firstie, but they got on great. Further meetings took place when Harry visited the Burrow, and Harry and Charlie got close.</p><p> </p><p>The Dark Lord exploited Charlie's one weakness. Set up an ambush on Harry Potter, and all his problems would go away. In exchange for Harry Potter, the Dark Lord gave Charlie a magical dildo. Not only was it charmed to move on its own, alleviating the stress on Charlie's arms, but it was <em>dragon themed</em>. </p><p><br/>There was only one possible answer, really. Harry would probably be okay.</p>
