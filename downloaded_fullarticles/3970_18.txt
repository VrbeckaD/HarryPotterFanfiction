    <p>Harry paced Dumbledore’s office, his mind racing, his heart beating harshly against his chest that felt hollow with the loss of Sirius. He never thought that the vision he received could be a trap; a trap that nearly cost the lives of himself and his friends. It did cost the life of his godfather. His heart bled at the thought of any of his friends dying as well. He wasn’t sure whether or not his friends were back at Hogwarts or still at the ministry. If they there they would be in the hospital wing; heading quickly towards the door Harry attempted to turn the knob swearing when it didn’t open.</p><p>With his hands balled into fist Harry continued to pace; wishing more than anything for a way out. He could hear muttering from the former headmasters in their portraits. He hissed at them “to just shut up” he didn’t want to hear their opinions. The more he paced the more agitated he became. He wanted to run, out run his thoughts, out run the unbearable pain that seemed to consume his entire body.</p><p>He ignored their muttering about disrespectful students not respecting their elders. Harry could care less about the long dead former headmasters in the portraits. Harry wanted out of Dumbledore’s office; he didn’t know why Dumbledore hadn’t made the portkey for the infirmary.</p><p>His attention snapped to fireplace when he heard the floo connect. “Let Me Out!” he ordered not giving Dumbledore time to step from the fireplace.</p><p>Dumbledore, however, had no intentions at this point of granting his request. Harry didn’t want to hear anything Dumbledore had to say; he hadn’t bothered to acknowledge his presence the entire year. Why should he be forced into the man’s company now after all that happen.<br/>
“Have a seat Mr. Potter we have much to discuss.”</p><p>“OH NOW YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME AFTER YOU IGNORED ME FOR THE WHOLE YEAR! YOU WANT TO TALK. SPARE ME!” Harry hissed still pacing the floor like an agitated caged animal. “LET ME OUT!”</p><p>Dumbledore looked calmly at his distraught student. He knew it was a risk keeping things from the boy, but it was a risk that he was willing to take.“I will but we must speak first,” Dumbledore informed his distraught student, “I know the loss of your Godfather is weighing heavily on you.”</p><p>“DON’T YOU DARE,” Harry shouted, “HOW DARE YOU MENTION HIS NAME WHEN YOU KEPT HIM LOCKED UP IN THAT HOUSE KNOWING HOW MUCH HE HATED IT.”</p><p>“Sirius understood that it would take time to get him cleared of the charges with the ministry. Just as he understood that you needed to learn the art of occlumency. I knew Voldemort would seek to gain full knowledge of that which he only knew a part,” Dumbledore tried to explain.</p><p>“FAT A LOT OF HELP THAT WAS! ALL SNAPE DID WAS TORMENT AND RIDICULE ME!” Harry replied his magic crackling around his small form. “WELL VOLDEMORT WON’T FIND OUT WHAT IT SAYS BECAUSE IT BROKE AND I’M GLAD IT DID. NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW WHAT IT SAID. MAYBE THEN THEY WILL LEAVE ME ALONE,” Harry shouted relieved.</p><p>“I’m afraid that I know what it contains as I’m the one who heard it in the first place,” Dumbledore informed him.</p><p>“WHAT!” Harry shouted in agitation his hands in tight fist at his sides. “I asked you in first year why Voldemort came after my family; but you refused to tell me. I asked again in second year, you had another excuse. This is your entire fault,” Harry shouted his accusations clear, “If you weren’t so focused on your goals you would have known that things that affect other people’s lives, is need to know information, not when you decide to tell it.”</p><p>“ENOUGH!” Dumbledore ordered, causing Harry to pause in his pacing to look at the old man. “It is not for you to know everything that is going on with the war effort.”</p><p>“If it directly affects my life, it is my right to know. It is not for you to decide what I need or do not need to know. Just like, it isn’t your right to tell my friends to ignore me the whole summer. You aren’t my parent, you aren’t even my guardian,” Harry snapped he was not going to allow Dumbledore to sweep his misdeeds under the rug.</p><p>“Do you want to hear the prophecy now?” Dumbledore questioned.</p><p>“No I don’t want to hear it. When I asked you didn’t want to tell me, so why should I bother with it now. According to you sir, it's none of my business. Evidently it’s not in my right to know as you've denied me the right for 4 years now. Isn't that right Headmaster? I don't want any parts of your machinations," Harry snapped out, “as far as I’m concerned this is your war you figure it out but leave me out of it. This pathetic community can burn in hell for all I care.”</p><p>“NOW LET ME OUT!”</p><p>“Very well, Mr. Potter,” Dumbledore sighed, you are to return to Gryffindor tower and pack your things. You are as of now suspended from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry until the verdict of your disciplinary hearing later this summer. Until such time you are to return to your muggle relative’s home. If you are cleared you must retake all of your exams as they are deemed invalid with your suspended status or you will be required to retake your 5th year.”</p><p>“You’re suspending me?” Harry questioned shocked.</p><p>“You were out of bounds Mr. Potter, a fact that the minister of magic himself saw. He ordered your expulsion from the school; however that is not viable, suspension however is and you are to get your things and return to my office; at which time someone will escort you home.”</p><p>“I want to check on my friends,” Harry retorted, not believing that Dumbledore would not grant his request to make sure his friends were okay after the ordeal they’d been through at the ministry.</p><p>“Your friends do not have any lasting medical problems and each should make a full recovery. However, you will return to the tower and pack. I expect you back within a half hours time or if you so choose I can order a house elf to retrieve your things. Madame Pomfrey already knows that you are not allowed in the ward. Off you go,” Dumbledore ordered ending their conversation.</p>
