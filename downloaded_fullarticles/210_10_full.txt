  <b>Early November.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus Snape glanced up from marking the truly execrable essays that his first year potions class had turned in that afternoon and glared at his dungeon door as a tentative knock sounded once again.  He sat paused with his quill in the middle of scratching a disgusted F on a young Ravenclaw’s blood, sweat and (literal) tears and scowled to himself in the hope that whoever was interrupting him would take the hint and go away. After the excitement of the trial of the Eight, his own arrest and then the various plans and schemes that he had cooked up with Dumbledore for their vastly expanded forces all he really wanted was to shut himself up in his damp and chilly dungeons and studiously avoid anyone who so much as looked like they might have world saving of any kind on their minds. His scowl deepened as the knock came again and he threw his quill down in disgust. “Come.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The door opened and the mother of the newest muggle member of Durus Cateanus stuck her head cautiously around the door. “Professor Snape?”  Liz edged into the room and hesitated before shutting the door quietly behind her. “I’m sorry to disturb you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Snape watched as her eyes drifted from his unwelcoming face and around his classroom, her eyes widening and mouth falling open must unattractively as she took in the room and its contents. He lifted one eyebrow as the woman actually paled as she pressed a hand to her stomach when she caught sight of a foetal goblin pickled forever in a jar directly beside her head.  He couldn’t quite contain the smirk of his lips as she jumped back a pace with a muffled curse and bumped her head on the door. “Mrs Horvath.” Snape stood and pulled his cloak tightly around him as he folded his arms, glaring down his nose as he waited for an explanation for her presence in his territory. And waited. And waited. And waited. He resisted the urge to roll his eyes as she continued gaping in horror at the room around them and realised if he wanted to get back to his scowling and dashing first year hopes for passable grades in his class he would have to speak again. “I presume there is a reason you are here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz managed to drag her eyes from a huge glass jar that she swore had eyeballs merrily bobbing in some kind of clear preservative and stared at the sallow faced man glaring at her in a way that somehow managed to be more disconcerting than the rest of the room combined. She licked her lips nervously and forced herself to concentrate on her mission. “Yes. I, er…” Her eyes drifted over his shoulder as she caught sight of bunches of what looked like withered animal legs hanging from the ceiling like strings of onions. “Oh God!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Snape frowned as she paled even more and turned to see what had caused her distress. All he could see were the dried lambs’ legs that he had procured from the kitchen for his sixth year class in the morning. He swayed slightly to the side, just in case there was something unspeakably horrible hiding behind them, and then swayed back to an upright position with a grunt of relief. Nothing there.  “Mrs Horvath, as much as I would like to play ‘scare-the-muggle’ with you, I really must insist that you inform me of why you are here and then let me get back to what I am doing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…”  Liz tried to swallow and focus on his unfriendly face. “The children have diaper rash and Madam Pomfrey said you might be able to make up a salve for me as she’s a little busy at the moment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Diaper rash?” Snape narrowed his eyes and stared down his hooked nose. “I’m afraid I am not familiar with that particular ailment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz made herself step further into the room and away from the reassuring door at her back. “The wetness from their diapers has caused some irritation on their skin.” She watched as he looked even more bewildered and tried to smile. “On their bottoms. From when they pee.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great Merlin.” Absolutely disgusted, Snape closed his eyes and tried to recall the days when practically everyone in the castle bar Dumbledore and McGonagall had been too scared of him to even think about approaching him and asking for favours. His life had apparently deteriorated to the point that random muggle women felt comfortable about popping in unannounced and asking for cream to relieve sore arses on babies. He took a deep calming breath. Maybe if he begged and pleaded with Voldemort he’d be allowed back into the dark fold, surely even life as an evil minion was better than this torture.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Um, maybe I should come back.” Liz stepped back in alarm as a thick vein began to throb in the scary looking man’s temple. “You’re obviously very busy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait.” Without looking at Liz, Snape turned in an impressive swirl of black cloth and stomped towards his walk-in potions cupboard behind his desk.  Muttering to himself he unlocked the door and flung it open to crash against the wall before going inside. Liz waited nervously as various curses and crashes sounded before he came marching back out clutching a medium-sized jar of something bright blue and shoved it at her. “Here. This will help and will be suitable for delicate skin. Please inform Madam Pomfrey and Mrs Weasley that in future I would be most obliged if they did not make use of my skills except in the most dire emergencies. Good day.”   He stalked back to his desk, flinging himself down in his chair to resume his marking before realising that Liz had made no move towards the door. “Yes, is there something else?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz shifted uneasily and fiddled with the jar in her hands, nearly dropping it in her nervousness. “I don’t know how to get back.” She flinched at the exasperated glare on Snape’s face and stuck her chin out defensively. “I had to follow a little glowing ball to get down here and it ran off when I knocked on your door.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Snape flung down his quill he had just picked up again and glared. “It ran off?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz squared her shoulders and reminded herself she was a grown woman with a successful career and she wasn’t about to be intimidated by a man who looked like his mother had gotten more than friendly with a vulture at some time in her youth. “Well it didn’t grow legs and actually run off, but it definitely disappeared.”  She narrowed her eyes and glared back at him. “You need to make another one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I most certainly do not.” Snape upped the wattage in his own glare and was mildly impressed to find that Liz didn’t seem to be at all alarmed by his malevolent expression but shoved the jar of ointment she held in her hands into the pocket of the fleecy jacket she wore to fold her arms and begin tapping her foot in annoyance. “Please shut the door quietly behind you when you leave.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz’s eyebrows hit her hairline at the dismissive tone and her foot picked up speed considerably as she completely failed to move from her spot on his sticky dungeon floor. “Wizard or not, you’ll speak to me with courtesy or I’ll make you regret it, Professor Snape.”  She flicked her sensibly cut brown bob away from her face as he stared in amazement at her cold face. “I will not be spoken to like one of your students.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you know who I am?”  Professor Snape realised his mouth was sagging open in surprise at Liz’s cold tone and he shut it with a snap. “My good woman, I happen to be…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The scary guy in the silly dress, I know.” Liz couldn’t quite stifle her smile at the affronted look that flashed across her adversary’s face at her casual dismissal of his fearsome reputation. “I’ve heard all about you from the kids. Well, that nonsensical attitude might scare them rigid but I’m afraid it doesn’t work on me. Now, are you going to behave in a civilised manner or am I going to have to stick my head out that door and start yelling for Professor Dumbledore?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus Snape was lost for words. For possibly the first time ever in his life. He cast his eyes quickly over the room to make sure he was still in his dungeons and had not suddenly been transported somewhere else or into an alternate reality and then he looked back at the muggle woman who was now watching him in what could only be called amusement.  He glared at her until his eyes threatened to water but that only seemed to serve to increase her amusement and make him feel like sneezing. “Please remove yourself from my classroom.” There, just the right amount of cold disgust with an underlying threat of imminent violence if she didn’t comply. That should do the trick.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz tipped her head to one side and shivered. “Better, but you could definitely use some work on your tone. Do you feel a draft?” She rubbed her hands together briskly and shivered again. “You could really do with a fire in here.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Professor Snape’s hand was half way to his face to make sure that his expression was suitably forbidding before he caught himself and hurriedly lowered it. Not since his days as a student in his house had he failed to cower someone with one of his ‘special’ looks and now a woman who had nearly screamed the castle down when she had been keyed in a few days earlier was turning her back on him and stretching out a curious hand to touch a jar next to her filled with an ominous looking red liquid that occasionally went ‘gloop’. “Don’t touch that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz hastily pulled her fingers back millimetres away from the glass. “Why? Is it dangerous?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, merely extremely valuable and difficult to acquire.” Snape got up from behind his desk and grabbed Liz’s arm in a vice-like grip. “Please leave.” He opened the door and steered her through it, not registering the heavy slam behind him as he pointed her back towards the main part of the castle. “Walk that way until you see the portrait of the two young witches attempting to waylay a young prince and then turn right. Good day.”  He turned to go back through his door and then grunted with pain when his nose hit solid wood and he bounced unwillingly back to Liz’s side. “Bloody hell!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz couldn’t help the snigger at the look of fury on his face as he tried to open the closed door, realised it was locked and then searched for his wand only to find it was still very definitely on the other side of the thick wooden panel. “Oh dear.” Her face worked as Snape swung round to glower at her and then she gave up the battle and broke into a fit of helpless laughter as she looked from him to the locked door. “Would you like me to go and get Hermione or Harry to open it for you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Certainly not!” Absolutely horrified, Professor Snape grabbed Liz’s arm and marched her away from his dungeons and back up the corridor to the main part of the school. “I have enough difficulty earning their respect as it is, without you informing them I need help getting into my own classroom. I will escort you to the Great Hall and then I will go in search of the Headmaster or Mister Filch.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor Snape, I don’t know how you people treat women in your world but in mine it’s considered extremely bad manners to manhandle them.” Liz tugged her arm free of his grip with difficulty. “I may not be a witch but I can assure you I’m more than capable of walking alongside another person for a few minutes without having to be dragged along.” Liz adjusted the sleeve of her fleece where it had rucked up and sniffed in annoyance. “If you don’t mind that is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The noise of Snape’s teeth grinding together was clearly audible in the otherwise empty corridor but he did just about manage to restrain the urge to growl in anger as the infuriating woman marched off and disappeared around the top of the corridor to the right. He stood clenching and unclenching his hands into fists for a moment thinking of all the unpleasant things he would like to do to Molly Weasley and Madam Pomfrey and was no longer allowed to do now he was leading light in the fight for good against evil then followed Liz muttering some very nasty things under his breath. He paused as he came to the top of the corridor and watched as she stomped away from him. “You’re going the wrong way.” Without waiting for an answer he turned to the left and stalked off, his robe flapping behind him in a most satisfactory manner.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz stopped and turned as she heard his voice and cursed viciously as she saw him disappear into the gloom without another word or glancing back to see if she’d heard him. She fought back the urge to remove the jar of salve from her pocket and hurl it at the back of his unwashed head before starting back the way she had come. “Jerk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Snape smirked to himself as he caught her not very subtle insult and picked up his pace to force Liz into an undignified trot to keep up. “Twit.”</span>
</p><p> </p>

  <b>Middle of November.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> As the long, cold days of November slowly passed and more and more refugees arrived at the castle, Severus Snape descended into the blackest of moods and made the most of every opportunity to make sure he dragged everyone he came into contact with down with him.  He kept up a punishing schedule of teaching all day, planning and strategising most of the night with Dumbledore and the few hours of rest he allowed himself were mostly filled with uneasy, broken dreams of his past and the constant fear of what might happen in the future.  It was on one such night in the middle of November, as the wind howled and splattered a driving rain against his small window, that he sat bolt upright in bed, gasping in panic as he came out of a nightmare where he had been forced to watch the Eight die at Voldemort’s hand before the Dark Lord had then turned his wrath on Hogwarts and the helpless people there.  Snape dropped his head into his hands with a shudder and scrubbed his palms over his face, desperately trying to erase the image of Draco being torn apart by giants as he screamed for his teacher to save him. “Just a dream.” His shoulders shook with reaction under his pyjama top as he took several deep breaths and then abruptly threw back the covers to jump out of bed and stumble across to the small cabinet where he kept his bottle of fire whisky. The hand that raised the bottle shook as he unscrewed the cap and tilted it to his mouth, shuddering again as the potent liquid made it’s way down his throat and created a false sensation of warmth in his rigid body.  His eyes opened as the sudden flood of alcohol slowed to a trickle and he stared in surprise at the empty bottle clenched in his shaking hand before slamming it down on the wooden top of the cabinet and reaching inside for a fresh bottle. His hand groped blindly for a moment before he bent and saw that the cupboard was completely empty and the expected bottle was nowhere to be seen. “No!” The door slammed shut as he kicked it in frustration and realised that somehow he had managed to drink his way through three bottles of whisky by himself in under two weeks without noticing. Desperation clawed at his throat and he stared wildly around the room, hoping for a miracle and a house-elf to appear with fresh supplies and then forced himself to calm down as he realised that the last thing he needed was for someone, even a servant, to witness his unbalanced state.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Several minutes, and some very inventive cursing, later, Snape had decided the hell with it and was stalking through the dark passages of Hogwarts on his way to kitchens to liberate the bottle of fire whisky the elves kept under strict lock and key for the special desserts they sometimes made the Professors.  He was unwilling to call down for an elf to bring it to him as he didn’t particularly want to risk one of the things waking up if they didn’t have to and instead was hoping to slip in and out of the kitchens with his spoils without being noticed. A hope which imploded with an almost audible pop as he slipped down the kitchen stairs and saw Liz Horvath seated at a long table with her hands wrapped around a steaming mug, staring with glazed eyes at the contents and his already foul mood wasn’t improved as she glanced up and rolled her eyes in disgust. “Oh God, not you again.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Feeling uncharacteristically vulnerable in his slippers and dressing gown, although they were at least his usual black, thank Merlin, Snape did his best to glare back. “I beg your pardon?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Look I’m not really in the mood to take any of your pissy attitude tonight, so why don’t you just grab whatever it is you came down here for and get lost?” Liz shivered in her own light blue robe and returned to staring into her hot milk that Dobby had very kindly made for her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?” Professor Snape’s eyebrows rose and he stared in disbelief as the muggle woman dismissed him. “How dare you talk to me like that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Easy. I have some pretty strong urges to kick the crap out of anyone I see with a wand these days and for some reason you inspire these feelings a lot more than most wizards.” Liz’s eyes stayed fixed on her drink as she spoke and she absently tucked a strand of hair back behind her ear as it dipped dangerously close to her drink. “Now go away and leave me alone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Snape opened his mouth, shut it again when he realised he couldn’t be bothered to argue when the thirst for his whisky still clawed at him and instead marched to the cabinet beside the huge cooking range to tap his wand on the door and open it. “It would be my pleasure.” He sighed with relief as he saw the desired beverage skulking behind some plainer sauces at the back and snatched at it to tuck it under his dressing gown out of sight. “Are you quite sure you wouldn’t like some assistance back to your quarters? Our encounter doesn’t seem quite complete without you demanding something I am unwilling to give and threatening to report me to the Headmaster.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz hunched her shoulders around her ears at his caustic remark as he strode past her towards the stairs. “I think I can manage, I come down here most nights.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Snape almost made it. His foot was actually on the bottom step to freedom and copious amounts of brain numbing alcohol and then he heard her sigh quietly to herself.  He ground his teeth as his hand unknowingly caressed the bottle of whisky clutched to his chest and then he turned back to Liz. “Do you think that’s wise? These are most dangerous times.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz snorted and didn’t look up. “Really? I hadn’t noticed.” She sipped at her drink and then looked up with a confused frown as she realised he hadn’t left the room. “Can I help you with something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think the Headmaster would approve of you being outside of your quarters unprotected.” Fighting the urge to now hurl his bottle at Liz’s ungrateful head, Professor Snape forced himself to relax the death grip he had on his fiery goodness and took a step towards the table. “If you’ve finished your drink, I will escort you to your quarters.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gee, thanks.” Liz pushed her chair back and headed for the hob where a pan of milk stood steaming gently on the low heat. “But I’m not tired and I want to be on my own.” She poured some more hot milk into her mug. “Don’t let me keep you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“For a woman who is unarmed and alone with an almost complete stranger in an unfamiliar environment, you might consider changing the way you speak to me.” Snape took another step towards the table as a vein in his temple began to throb. “You have no idea what I am capable of when I am roused.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can you fight off my daughter and her friends when they come looking for you afterwards?” Liz blinked back bitter tears as she carried her milk back to her seat. “Somehow I don’t think even you could stop your fabled saviours kicking your uptight ass, do you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Eight are my students and respect my authority.”  Snape glowered and almost convinced himself of the lie as his mouth twisted in a sneer. “Your child holds no fears for me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lucky you.” Liz frowned as she felt a lone tear trickle from her eye. “She scares the crap out of me.” The milk sloshed in her mug as she put it down on the table with a crash and buried her face in her hands. “Just go away and leave me alone!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stop that.” Professor Snape was at the table before he realised he’d moved and he glared down at Liz’s shaking body. “Stop that immediately.”  He glared as Liz completely ignored him and continued to weep brokenly. “I </span>
  <em>
    <span>order</span>
  </em>
  <span> you to cease this nonsense forthwith.”  A muscle in his cheek began to twitch as his angry words went unheeded and Liz began to sob harder. “Stop it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…I can’t.” Liz’s breath began to hitch. “I can’t. It’s…too…much.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you injured?” Professor Snape glanced warily over Liz’s body. “Do you need medical assistance?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No!” Liz scrubbed a shaking hand over her face. “Please, just go away and leave me alone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a moment he was sorely tempted and then Professor Dumbledore’s disapproving face swam before Snape’s eyes and he found himself reaching a snowy white cloth hanging from a nail on the nearby wall. “Here. Clean your face.” His eyes rolled as Liz went off into another storm of sobbing as the cloth was thrust in her face and he resigned himself to the fact that his whisky would have to wait as he lowered himself into a chair and waited for her to calm down. Long minutes passed as Liz cried and Snape stared anywhere but at the distraught woman and then she slowly began to calm down and her sobs eased into intermittent sniffs as her tears finally ran dry.  Without asking Professor Snape got up and took Liz’s mug to tip away the cold milk and then refill the cup with the last of the warm milk on the stove. He brought it back to her without saying a word, sitting and watching as she drank it down before gently taking her arm and guiding her back out of the kitchen and up the stairs to her house where he left her without another word. The whisky bottle that he had laid down in the kitchen when Liz had first broken down was forgotten as he tumbled in exhaustion into bed and was found sitting by the still lit stove by a very confused house elf.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <b>End of November.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As the month dragged on Liz and Snape fell into an uncertain pattern of meeting in the early hours of the morning in the kitchens as they tried to battle their own separate demons and sat together in silence as they downed mug after mug of warm milk.  Both were unwilling to break the fragile and unlikely peace between them by speaking and it was only after the night that Durus Cateanus had turned on each other in such spectacular fashion that they finally began to verbally communicate. Snape had arrived after Liz and was alarmed to find her huddled in one of the two armchairs that the house-elves had started leaving by the fire for their visits as she wept silent tears once more.  He paused for a moment at the foot of the stairs and had nearly decided to slip quietly back up them when her head turned and he found himself caught by the sheer misery in her wet eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> “What is it? Is it your daughter?”  He almost jumped at the sound of his own voice in the quiet kitchen but hurried forward as her face crumpled again. “Is she injured?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No.” Liz shook her head and stared into the fire. “She’s not injured.” Tears ran unchecked down her face as it creased in bitter lines. “Not physically anyway. Did you hear about what she and the others did in the woods?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” Cautiously Snape lowered himself into the armchair across from her and leaned back so that his face was in the shadows. “I understand they were very brave.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’re killers.” Liz’s fists tightened into hard balls of flesh as she thought of the way Kit and the others had looked when they had come back to their quarters dripping with demon blood and other less recognisable things. “All of them. I never really saw it before, when they just spar in the training room it doesn’t seem real, but they kill and they enjoy it. God, what they </span>
  <em>
    <span>looked </span>
  </em>
  <span>like. That’s not my kid, it can’t be; my child could never do what they did to another living being and enjoy it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think she does.” Snape watched as Liz gulped down bile and shook his head as she looked up at him. “I don’t think any of them enjoy it.” He paused and thought of Connor Angel. “Well, with one notable exception.” He smiled grimly as Liz shivered and leaned closer to fire in a bid to warm her chilled bones. “They have been placed in an extraordinarily difficult situation and I believe they are coping sufficiently.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I lose more of my daughter every day.” Liz couldn’t seem to stop shivering as she remembered Kit trying to explain the desperate urge she had been battling to go out and slay demons with her friends. “That old man stood before me tonight and told my little girl and her friends that they are being changed in ways no one ever expected and that he would start using them as the weapons they are and I had no choice but to give my blessing because Kit told me that it might kill her if I didn’t.” Pure fury sparked in her eyes. “How is that right? How can you let children be used in that way?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They </span>
  <em>
    <span>shouldn’t </span>
  </em>
  <span>be used that way. There is nothing honourable or good about this entire situation.” Snape leaned forward as Liz voiced many of the secret concerns he struggled with nightly since the identity of the Eight had been revealed. “Battles should never be fought by teachers and children, you should never have been brought here and our Ministry should be able to protect us. But they cannot.” He shook his head in disgust and his lank hair slapped against his cheek. “We are forced to place our hopes and future into the hands of children that are barely out of their cradles on the word of a witch that died a millennia ago. We have to trust in the Eight.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz stared at his lined face and then turned back to the fire. “It’s not right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>                                   </span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <b>Early December.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Professor Severus Snape looked up at the light tap on his office door and gave a tight smile of welcome to Liz Horvath as she poked her head into his room. “Hi. Just thought I’d check you were still on for milk and cookies later? I managed to persuade Dobby that I wouldn’t ruin his precious kitchen if he let me mix up a batch of double chocolate fudge.” Snape waved Liz to the chair before his desk with a tired sigh and tried to smile more warmly as she waved an enquiring eyebrow. “Bad day, Severus?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Anyanka gave a talk to my class today.” Snape raised an eyebrow as Liz muffled a laugh behind her hand. “I take it you’ve already heard?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was in the Infirmary for the baby’s check up when the girls brought her back in.” Liz chuckled and crossed her legs as she got comfortable on the chair. “Dawn, Ginny and Kit couldn’t speak without stammering and Hermione was happily planning another talk with Anya that I believe they want to centre on all the things the Slayer and her people have stopped over the years. Apparently Anya thinks she can get her hands on the remains of a mayor of Sunnydale that turned into a big snake.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Absolutely not!” Filled with terror at the thought of sitting through another one of the absurdly perky demon’s talks on the unfortunate beings she had helped slaughter over the centuries, Professor Snape sat bolt upright and pointed an emphatic finger at Liz’s laughing face. “That woman is never coming near another one of my classes ever again.” He shuddered as he remembered some of the more graphic images. “What that woman has </span>
  <em>
    <span>done</span>
  </em>
  <span>…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She sure would have come in handy when Kit’s father walked out on us, I know that much.”  Liz grinned at the snarl from the man opposite her. “You did a good thing today, Severus, Anya’s brighter than I’ve ever seen her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh good. That will make my poverty and disgrace so much more bearable when I’m dragged out of school by the Ministry and forbidden to ever teach again.” Professor Snape glared at Liz as she laughed again and then closed his eyes as he fell back in his chair with groan. “Sweet Merlin, what she showed those children.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure it was very educational.” Liz eyed the deflated figure of Severus fondly as he tilted his head back to stare at the ceiling blankly and then stood and turned to the door. “I’ll let you get back to work. See you, tonight?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If I don’t impale myself on my own wand in remembered horror first, certainly.” Snape kept his eyes on the ceiling as Liz slipped out of his office with another laugh and then slowly sat up to stare at the chair she had just vacated. Something very peculiar was happening to him and he wasn’t the least bit sure he liked it.   Ever since they had broken their self-imposed silence the night Kit and the others had taken on the demons in the Forbidden Forest their nightly meetings had changed as they had slowly but surely began to get to know each other.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At first both Liz and Snape had been hesitant in their conversations, both from different worlds and cultures and neither sure of the other’s supposed interest in them, but then they had gradually relaxed and had found that even with all their differences they had much in common. Both were to some extent cut off from the world they now both occupied, Snape by virtue of his past history and unwillingness to allow others close to him and Liz by her very nature, but they were both deeply lonely in their own ways and it was undoubtedly a delight to find someone to talk too about something other than the imminent end of life as they knew it.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Snape was surprised to find that despite being a muggle Liz was a very entertaining conversationalist and was more than willing to challenge the opinions he offered her on diverse subjects such as art and history without any regard for the fearsome reputation he had acquired over the years.  He was surprised to feel a deep respect for her as they shared stories of their very different lives and was reminded that although she was to all intents and purposes helpless now she had raised a child by herself for the last seventeen years and built up a very successful career as well.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz, on her part, was stunned to find that the deeply unpleasant man she had first spoken to in his classroom was actually quite shy under all the layers of abrasive sneering and disgust that his habitually cloaked himself in and found that underneath the surface there was more than a passing resemblance to Draco Angel, whom she had taken very much to heart after his defence of her beloved daughter. They shared the same belief in their innate superiority over practically everyone else on the planet but Liz also saw the same need for acceptance in Snape that she saw in Draco and found herself delighting in the wary smiles he had started to flash her after a while.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Snape leaned forward and steepled his hands on his desk as he stared thoughtfully at the door that had just closed behind Liz. Of all the upsetting and downright peculiar things that had happened to him over the course of his eventful life the most alarming one had happened to him without triggering the slightest qualm or early warning signal.  Somehow, someway, over the course of more hot milk and cookies than was good for him and some very late nights, Professor Severus Snape, aged thirty nine and confirmed bachelor of his parish, had made a friend of one of the creatures that he had professed all his life to despise and then, to just tip the scales towards insanity that little bit more, he suspected he was on the very cusp of falling in love for the first time in his life.  With a muggle to boot! Snape shuddered as he thought of the look on his father’s face if the evil old goat had lived long enough to be told the news and then chuckled quietly to himself. Actually that would have been quite amusing, come to think of it. Definitely worth the possible painful disembowelling and definite disinheritance that would have followed. The smile bled from his face as he thought of Liz again and he sighed deeply, sure of only one thing in this frightening new world he now seemed to be living in.  However much the little runt tried to deny it, this was absolutely, without any doubt whatsoever, all Harry bloody Potter’s fault.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz watched the light from the fire flicker over Severus’ face as she sat with her legs curled comfortably under her in her usual chair and frowned to herself as she tried to work out what seemed to be so different about him that night.  He had stalked into the kitchen just after midnight with his usual glare sending Dobby scurrying for his bed in the elf quarters behind the kitchen with a squeal and then had flashed his usual tight smile of thanks as she had handed him a steaming mug of milk and nutmeg.  They had taken their seats before the fire chatting casually about their days and then lapsed into silence as they just enjoyed the quiet of the kitchen, but instead of the usual comfortable atmosphere, Liz had noticed Severus flicking glances her way when he thought he was not being observed and more than once his face tightened as he seemed to be holding an internal conversation with himself. “Severus, are you ok?”  Liz frowned as he actually jumped in his chair and she leaned forward in concern. “Is there something going on that I don’t know about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Cursing quietly to himself for drifting off, Severus tried to smile reassuringly. “Of course not, Elizabeth.” He shifted uneasily in his chair as she leaned forward and stared at him with worried brown eyes. “I apologise if I’m not good company this evening, I’ve had a rather trying day. I’m obviously more tired than I thought.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz looked unconvinced. “Are you sure that’s all it is? You seem miles away.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure.” Severus tried his reassuring smile again and swore foully in the privacy of his own head when Liz looked positively alarmed by the feeble effort and made a mental note to practice smiling in front of mirror at least once a day for the foreseeable future, he’d obviously lost the knack somewhere along the line. “The end of term is always very busy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right.” Liz leaned back in her chair and eyed him uncertainly. “Whatever you say.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus went back to staring at the fire broodingly for long minutes acutely aware of Liz’s eyes on him and then found his mouth opening of its own accord without any direct involvement from his brain. “Do you ever think of what you will do when this is over?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When what is over?” Liz pursed her mouth in confusion and tilted her head to one side curiously. “Meeting you like this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus frowned as he felt his heart give an uneasy thump against his ribs at the thought of never having these quiet moments with Liz again and shook his head. “No, when the war is over. When you are free to leave here and resume your life.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” Now it was Liz’s turn to stare into the fire as she considered his gruff question. “No, I haven’t thought about it.” She shrugged. “I’ll go back home, I suppose. Take Kit and try and rebuild our lives.  Obviously I’ve lost my job, but at least with the Ministry covering my mortgage we won’t be homeless and hopefully it won’t take too long before I can find another firm willing to employ me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see.” Severus’ heart was now thumping painfully against his ribs as he realised that the quiet woman he had come to see as a friend would in all probability be leaving for the other side of the world before the clean up had started on the victory celebrations. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz looked even more confused at his quiet comment. “What will you do? When it’s over I mean.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I shall remain here.”  Snape’s mouth twisted in a bitter smile as he kept his eyes on the fire. “I have too many enemies to go elsewhere and even when the Dark Lord is defeated there will be plenty of people only too happy to see me writhing in agony before they give me a long painful death.” He glanced up at the muffled gasp of shock from Liz. “Don’t worry; as long as I remain at the school I will be perfectly safe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry.” Knowing the words were horribly inadequate, Liz felt her eyes fill with sympathetic tears as she watched her friend lean back in his chair until his face was hidden. “I’ll miss you when I go, Severus. You’ve made these last few months a lot easier to face.” She bit her lip uncertainly for a moment. “Will you…I mean…I’d like you to visit sometimes if you could. I don’t want to lose touch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Secure in the knowledge his expression would be hidden by the shadows, Snape closed his eyes in distress and forced a laugh. “I don’t think that’s a good idea, Elizabeth.  I think it’s unlikely I’d fit in your world.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The stab of pain that made Liz raise an instinctive hand to her heart caught her completely by surprise and she was only able to stare in silent shock at the fire as she realised that the thought of never seeing Severus Snape again was almost as upsetting as the thought of never seeing her daughter again. She rubbed the hand over her woollen sweater as she tried to organise her thoughts and was astounded to discover that she was definitely not feeling just the normal levels of distress that a friend might feel at his casual dismissal.  She had come to rely on his quiet support over the last few months and without seeing what was happening had managed to come closer to a relationship with the most frightening man she’d ever met in her entire life than in all her years as a dating single mom. Over the course of their conversations he had told her the best and worst of him, right down to the things he had done whilst under the service of Voldemort, and even after hearing the very scary memories he carried with him, she still felt nothing but comfort and safety in his gloomy presence.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz bit her lip thoughtfully once more and then made a decision. As much as they all talked of their eventual victory, she was only too aware that the eventual outcome of their fight with Voldemort could just as easily be the destruction of Hogwarts and all who had opposed the Dark Lord in his quest for power. As Liz had gotten to know her daughter at Hogwarts the one thing she had found herself admiring most about Kit was her absolute determination to live for the day and not worry about tomorrow until it happened. In fact all of the Eight had the same almost frantic desire to sample as many pleasures as they could in their own ways, all of them aware that at any minute they could find themselves fighting for their lives and be left with nothing but regrets to hold as they slipped away into the dark.  Liz uncurled her legs and inched forward on her chair until she could see Severus’ dark eyes glittering in the firelight. “I’m going to miss you, Severus. Very much.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And I you.” Snape caught his breath at the picture she made in the dim light, wrapped in a chunky woollen sweater with her brown hair shining around her face as she rubbed her palms unconsciously against the rough material of her jeans. “Hogwarts will seem very empty without you here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I could visit.” Liz forced herself to keep meeting his eyes and wished that she didn’t sound so much like a desperate teenager as she tried to dry her suddenly sweaty palms on her denim covered legs. “I already know about your world and Kit will want to keep seeing her friends. I wouldn’t be able to afford plane tickets for a while but maybe you could make one of those key things?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Elizabeth….” Snape sighed wearily and shook his head slowly. “You don’t want to do that. Believe me when I say you don’t want to try and live in two different worlds. When you can leave here, go and don’t ever look back to us. Take your daughter and live your life as you were meant to do with your own kind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz flinched as though he’d slapped her. “My own kind?” She moved jerkily to her feet and hoped her face wasn’t as stricken as it felt. “How can you say that to me, I thought we were past all that?” She turned away from him to stumble towards the stairs. “I thought we were friends…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Elizabeth, wait!” Snape jumped up and hurried after her as she made for the stairs, catching her arm in his hand. “Wait, I didn’t mean it like that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz tried to tug her arm away. “I think you did, Severus. Let go of me please.” She refused to give him the satisfaction of seeing her cry and held her head up proudly. “I’m suddenly very tired.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus redoubled his grip on her arm. “I apologise, I had no intention of hurting you. I merely thought you would prefer to put this episode in your life behind you as soon as possible, Merlin knows it hasn’t been exactly pleasant for you here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, being inferior to pretty much everyone I come into daily contact with kind of puts a damper on things, yes.” Liz tugged at her arm again. “I just thought that we had a friendship that was a little more permanent than whenever the war ends.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We do!” Snape’s infuriated shout made them both jump and he let go of her arm only to grip her shoulders in both hands. “Of course we do. I told you that you mean a great deal to me, I value your friendship deeply.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But you never want to see me again when I go back to the States?” Liz raised an unconvinced eyebrow. “Oh yeah, we’re great friends.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was thinking of you, Elizabeth. I would prefer that we parted on good terms rather than ruin a friendship that would be impossible to maintain between two such very different worlds.” Severus’ fingers clenched and unclenched on her narrow shoulders as he tried to make her understand. “It is only natural that you would want to move on and leave the past behind you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Will you stop damn well saying that!” Completely exasperated, Liz thumped his chest awkwardly and resisted the urge to stamp her foot. “Why would I want to leave you behind me when I like having you in my life so much? Severus, I actually </span>
  <em>
    <span>like</span>
  </em>
  <span> spending time with you and I enjoy your company.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You do?” Snape blinked in surprise at her firm declaration. “Really?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes!” Liz slipped out of his suddenly lax hold and threw her hands into the air. “Of course I do. I haven’t been overloading on cookies for the last few weeks just to see how far I can stretch the waistline on my jeans, you know. You’re a very kind, warm and funny man and it’s been my pleasure getting to know you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus blinked again and then stared warily over his shoulder in case there was actually some other man standing behind him that Liz might be talking to before looking back at her. “No one has ever said anything like that to me before.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I should imagine not.” Liz folded her arms and glared petulantly. “You go around growling, scowling and generally scaring the bejesus out of everyone and they never have the chance to see how nice you can be when you want to be.” She sniffed as she looked at his lank hair and shapeless robes. “And you’re not exactly overly enthusiastic when it comes to personal grooming which kind of adds to the overall scariness but you have a good and honourable heart and that’s very attractive to people that take the time to look past the vicious insults and looks.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Snape felt his jaw sag slightly. “You think I’m attractive?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” Belatedly Liz realised she’d gone a little further than she intended with her rant and stepped back to put some distance between them, suddenly unsure of herself and her new resolve to seize the day. “I meant to say…appealing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But you </span>
  <em>
    <span>said </span>
  </em>
  <span>attractive.” Severus followed her as she took another step backwards. “Would that be attractive just in the friendly sense?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz swallowed at the hopeful look in his eye that he couldn’t quite hide and shrugged uncomfortably. “Not entirely just in the friendly sense, no.”  She watched him warily as he raised a hand towards her face. “What are you doing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Something very out of character.” Severus kept his eyes on hers as he lowered his head and lightly brushed his mouth across her open one. They pulled back and stared at each other as fireworks completely failed to go off and they weren’t overcome with a sudden blinding passion for each other. “Oh. Would you like to try again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz spluttered with sudden laughter at the annoyed look on his face and moved closer. “I think we’d better. That was pitiful.”  She raised her face to his as their lips met again and this time, while not earth shattering, their kiss raised some very pleasant and long forgotten sensations in both of them. When Liz pulled back this time she smiled and touched his face lightly. “Better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Somewhat.” Severus stepped away and led her to their seats by the fire. He waited until she had settled back onto her seat and then perched on the edge of his to take her hand in his. “Elizabeth, I can’t promise this will take us anywhere we want to go. We’re both very used to doing things our own way and I’m still not sure that we are able to successfully bring our worlds together.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Liz smiled and squeezed the warm hand holding her own comfortingly. “Let’s not borrow trouble, Severus. There’s a long way to go before we can find that out and I think we’re both old enough to know that life isn’t all hearts and flowers. Let’s just enjoy what we have for now and let tomorrow take care of itself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re a very wise woman.” Severus raised her hand to his lips and brushed a kiss over her knuckles. “Very well, we’ll just take each day as it comes.” They smiled at each other in the light of the fire and then let go of each other’s hands to lean back in their chairs and enjoy the warmth from the dying fire.</span>
