    <p>Draco shifted in his seat as he heard a thud ring throughout Malfoy Manor. He glanced from his spot on the couch of the living area towards the hallway to his left and watched as a toy broom flew across the hallway from one room to another. Draco shook his head as he recognized the two rooms the broom was flying between. Rose and Scorpius. He shook his head playfully before hearing a young girl’s joyful scream fill the house.</p><p>“Dada! Can you come here please!”</p><p>Draco stilled momentarily, still not use to hearing Rose call him ‘dada’. It’s been a year since him and Hermione were wedded, and Rose insisted on calling her stepfather ‘dada’ because ‘only mummies and daddies get married’. Draco slowly stood and proceeded to walk towards the room the broom was thrown from. It was the room Rose claimed as her own after they moved in. 

Astoria has passed away shortly after giving birth to Scorpius. Draco knew she was sick, she had a blood disease that was common in the Greengrass family. Rose was born a few months before Scorpius, Hermione and Ron wanting to help Draco with Scorpius after Astoria’s passing. It worked for two years. And then it didn’t. Ron had passed away in an unfortunate accident in the Auror Department. Rose and Scorpius were only two and Hugo was a newborn. Both Draco and Hermione struggled parenting alone, always helping each other when needed. </p><p>It took five months after Ron’s death for Draco to find the courage to ask Hermione on a date. He was enamored with how much pain she endured but still kept going. Draco was almost envious. It went well enough for Draco to suggest Hermione move into the manor, for the convenience of things. Hermione hesitantly accepted. A short year later they were married, the children overjoyed they could be in the ceremony. </p><p>“Dada! Hurry!”</p><p>Draco was pulled from his thoughts and entered Rose’s room to find Rose standing in the center of it. Light blue walls greeted him as Draco smiled as he glanced down at Hermione’s twin. Rose looked and acted like a mini Hermione, the only difference between the two was Rose’s hair and eye color. Draco saw that Rose’s unruly bright red hair was pulled back into a ponytail. The five-year-old was staring at Draco with her bright blue eyes while wearing a white t-shirt with what appeared to be a bludger neatly printed on the front.</p><p>“Dada, we have a game for you! Mummy, Hugo, and Scorp are hiding. One of us is the snitch! You have to find it!”</p><p>Draco smiled as Rose cheerfully explained the rules of what had to be Hermione’s game. He nodded and eyed Rose suspiciously.</p><p>“And what are you supposed to do?”</p><p>Rose smirked, and Draco’s eyes slightly widened. </p><p>“Well, I’m a bludger. So I have to stop you!”</p><p>Draco wasn’t expecting Rose to run at him full force, but she did. Even being caught off guard, Draco still managed to hold his balance as Rose jumped onto him. He glanced around Rose’s room, while Rose clung to his back, thankful that Hermione convinced Rose to keep little to nothing in her room. Draco walked quietly to Rose’s bed, holding onto Rose as he kneeled and looked under the bed. Draco saw two gray eyes stare back at him and he pulled away just as Scorpius crawled out from under the bed. </p><p>“Surprise, daddy!”</p><p>Scorpius jumped us and revealed that he was also wearing a white t-shirt. Slight disappointment overcame Draco when he saw a quaffle printed on Scorpius’ shirt. The young boy playfully yelled before clinging to Draco’s right leg. Rose soon jumped off of Draco’s back and clung onto his left leg. Draco slowly turned, careful not to hurt the now laughing Rose and Scorpius. His eyes wandered around the almost bare room. Rose had a rather large bed, queen size, and a couple of toys. A desk was tucked away in the back corner. A large dark blue beanbag chair sat in the other back corner of the room. Neither Hermione nor Hugo could hide behind or the other. Draco turned and faced the large walk in closet near the door to the room. The closet door was closed, something it never was, and Draco trudged his way over, Rose and Scorpius still laughing and clinging onto each leg. </p><p>“Scorp, he’s getting close.”</p><p>Draco smiled as Rose and Scorpius fidgeted around his ankles, making some progress on slowing down their father. Draco let out a sigh of relief as he stood in front of the closet door. He heard Rose and Scorpius scream a playful “No” and let go of his legs as he opened the door. Draco smiled as he was met with two hazel eyes staring up at him. Hugo, who was wearing a white t-shirt with a bludger printed on it, smiled up at his stepfather. Draco smirked as he realized the children were the two bludgers and quaffle, meaning Hermione was the snitch. Draco lifted Hugo up into his arms. He looked down at Hugo, the three-year-old being awfully silent. Hugo stared back with curious eyes. Draco took note at the vast differences between Rose and Hugo, shocked that the two were biological siblings. While Rose looked exactly like Hermione, save for the hair and eye color, Hugo looked nothing like his mother. Hugo’s hair was a deep red, dark enough to pass as brunet from far away, but still definitely red. Freckles lined his nose and under his eyes. His eye color was the only thing remotely close to Hermione’s, but even they were off. Hermione’s eyes were brown whereas Hugo’s eyes were more of a hazel. Draco looked up to glance around the rest of the walk-in-closet and saw Hermione sitting pretzel style in the back. Draco smiled and made his way to his wife, Hugo in his arms and Rose and Scorpius following behind him.</p><p>“Looks like I found my snitch, although I swear I found you years ago,” Draco playfully stated, never breaking eye contact with Hermione. The witch stood up and glanced at her husband, playfully smirking at her him.</p><p>“Oh, I’m not playing. Only the kids are playing. Hugo couldn’t be alone.”</p><p>Draco’s face fell, his expression unreadable. Rose and Scorpius stood quiet next to him, smiling uncontrollably. </p><p>“Hermione, we have three kids,” Draco stated, clearly confused.</p><p>“Good to know you can count.”</p><p>Draco shook his head, tempted to wipe the smirk off Hermione’s face with a kiss.</p><p>“There are four balls in quidditch,” Draco stated.</p><p>“I never said there wasn’t.”</p><p>“But if only the kids are playing, then there is no snitch. Rose and Hugo are bludgers and Scorpius is a quaffle.”</p><p>Draco looked at all three of the children. Each child had their respective ball on their shirt, each child smiling at him. Rose and Scorpius acted like they knew something Draco did not, like where the snitch was. Hugo smiled simply because he was happy. </p><p>“Did you check all of the kids,” Hermione asked, a suggestive tone escaping. Her eyes panned down to her own shirt. Draco stared at Hermione’s shirt, even more confused. Hermione was also wearing a white shirt, but it was plain. There was nothing on the shirt. Draco looked back up at Hermione, a pleading but loving look in her eyes. Draco’s breathing quickened and his heart started beating faster as he reached towards Hermione’s shirt. He slowly lifted the shirt, revealing something painted onto Hermione’s stomach with magic non-smudging paint. </p><p>“Are.. are you serious,” Draco squeaked out. Draco almost panted as he read Hermione’s stomach again. The witch smiled as she kissed Draco’s cheek. She took Hugo from Draco’s arms.</p><p>“Draco, read it aloud, the kid’s can’t read it yet and they want to know too,” Hermione pleaded. Draco nodded as Rose and Scorpius stared up at their father.</p><p>“Granger-Malfoy Snitch; estimated arrival is August.”</p><p>Draco glanced back up to meet Hermione’s gaze. She nodded, tears forming in her eyes. Rose and Scorpius tugged on their parents’ shirts, confused on what was happening.</p><p>“Mummy, what does that mean,” Rose questioned.</p><p>“Daddy, we already have a snitch in our qudditch ball box we don’t need another one,” Scorpius stated with confusion.</p><p>Draco picked up Rose and Scorpius, one kid in each arm. He smiled back and forth between the two.</p><p>“It means Mummy and Daddy are having another baby.”</p><p>Rose and Scorpius stared at each other with wide eyes before letting out two screams of joy. Draco smiled as Rose and Scorpius asked them questions a mile a minute, but he didn’t hear them because he was too busy staring at Hermione.</p>
