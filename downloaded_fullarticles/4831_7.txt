    <p align="center">~July 1994~</p><p>“Cool.”</p><p>Concentration broken, Severus fell onto the pillows he had learned approximately a decade ago were necessary. He eased back up, glaring at Harry, who smiled sheepishly.</p><p>“Sorry,” he said. “I didn’t mean to startle you, Professor Snape.”</p><p>He had made it clear that Harry <em>could</em> address him as Severus outside of school, but Harry seemed unlikely to start. He even addressed Remus as “Professor Lupin” still despite the same courtesy extended. The only one he accepted such a suit from was Black.</p><p>“Not the first time I’ve been interrupted,” he said.</p><p>Remus happened to find breaking Severus’ concentration amusing, even going as far as mumbling erotic suggestions just as Severus was about to enter the levitation state. He had to move the time to when Remus was fast asleep and also down in the living room.</p><p>Speaking of…</p><p>Severus stood. “It’s five in the morning, Harry.”</p><p>“I couldn’t sleep,” he admitted. “Nightmare.” Harry stuffed his hands in his pajama pant pockets in an attempt to hide his embarrassment at the confession. Severus hummed.</p><p>“I know the feeling,” he said. “Care to talk about it?”</p><p>“It’s silly,” Harry said.</p><p>“Nothing that frightens someone is ever silly,” Severus said. “You can tell us.”</p><p>Granted, this was more Remus’ area, but PTSD from the first war often left Severus with his own nightmares from the things he’d witnessed and even some of the things he’d done.</p><p>He tossed one of the pillows to Harry, who sat down on it, thinking. “I’m in a house,” he said after a moment. “An old, dark mansion. And I am heading toward one of the rooms because there’s a light on. I see that there’s a large snake on the floor and a man. He approaches an arm chair and tell someone sitting in it—someone I can’t see—that he’ll ensure that the job is done and make any sacrifices he must to see it through. There’s a voice, kind of raspy and tired, coming from the chair, telling the man he trusts him to not fail. The snake, then alerts whoever is in the chair that I’m outside in the hall. The man opens the door and there’s a flash of green light. Then I woke up.”</p><p>Severus hummed thoughtfully.</p><p>“You don’t think it means anything, right? Could it just be a dream?”</p><p>“You tell me.”</p><p>“That’s useful.”</p><p>“You’re taking Divination, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Yes, but it’s not like Trelawney is any good at her job.”</p><p>“Oh, she isn’t much of a teacher, I agree, but she does have a gift. She knows what she’s talking about. Sometimes.”</p><p>“She kept saying I was going to die last year. Said it was the Grim. Nope. Just Sirius.”</p><p>Severus snorted. “True as that is, she has been known to give a prophecy or two in the past.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“It’s rare, but it does happen.”</p><p>“When was the last time?”</p><p>Severus hummed. “I think it was just before you were born…or not. Who knows?”</p><p>“Who cares?” Harry added, smiling.</p><p>“Well, either way, I’m not one for interpretation, and yes, most of the time a dream is just a dream. Sometimes, though, dreams have deeper meanings. They allow one to handle situations they are still coming to terms with or, in your case, more complex. It could be me, but it sounds like a vision of sorts.”</p><p>“Vision? I’m able to divine?”</p><p>“Not the same way Sybill does, but yes. If you like, I can show you a couple tricks that could help prevent these visions or dreams from happening.”</p><p>Harry frowned, unsure.</p><p>“You might be able to levitate, yourself.”</p><p>And now his eyes widened. “Really?”</p><p>“Don’t get your hopes up if you don’t start to. It took years for me to meditate deep enough where I can…and now you just want to learn how to levitate.”</p><p> It wasn’t as if Harry was avoiding showing his excitement at the idea of it, bouncing where he sat and grinning. “Won’t I?”</p><p>“It took me about seven years to get to a point where I could levitate during meditations.”</p><p>Harry stilled. “But it can happen if I’m diligent enough, right?”</p><p>“Diligent isn’t the word I’d use. Patient is more like it. You need a quiet space or at least some white noise. You get into a comfortable position and focus on breathing. Some find it helpful to count, but the point is to empty your mind of all clutter or thought.”</p><p>“Severus, we’ll have to get new shackles! The Velcro’s coming undone,” Remus called.</p><p>Harry doubled over laughing and Severus groaned, turning irately to him. “REMUS I AM WITH A CHILD!!!”</p><p>“Yeah, I see that now,” Remus said, blushing and hiding the felt shackles behind his back “I thought he’d still be asleep.”</p><p>“We agreed to keep it in the bedroom, Pet.”</p><p><em>You wouldn’t have minded if he was still asleep</em>. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“<em>Not the point</em>.” Severus pinched the bridge of his nose. “I know you are. I’m sorry, too. For yelling.” He stood and approached Remus, giving him a gentle kiss. “Good morning, by the way.”</p><p>“Good morning.” Behind them, Harry made a faux vomit sound before making his escape. Remus laughed. “Good to see him acting more like a regular kid.”</p><p>“And what does that make us? His parents?”</p><p>“Perish the thought! I don’t think we’d want to fill those shoes. Black can take up the role for all I care.”</p><p>“Good,” Remus said. “Happy as I am to have Harry here, I really want you to fuck me without worries.”</p><p>“You know, I don’t think I realized how horny lycanthropes were.”</p><p>Remus arched a brow. “Think if we get that chance, you won’t be able to keep up?”</p><p>“Cheeky,” Severus said, grabbing Remus’ ass. “I keep up with you fine, Pet. Now, I know you want to get fucked, but…” Severus pushed him back. “You have to give Harry the Talk.”</p><p>“Wait…really?”</p><p>“I’m not doing it.”</p><p>“Hasn’t he already…”</p><p>“Apparently, he hasn’t. Not that I expect that fat muggle to have given him accurate information even if he had. Add to it, you’re the horny one.”</p><p>“He might be straight. I can’t—”</p><p>“Yes, you can. And you will. At least Black won’t need to worry about it.”</p><p>“I hate you.”</p><p>“Nice, try, Pet. I know you love me. In fact, I’ll give you a little incentive: after you fulfill that task, I’ll fuck you any way you like. But you need to talk to Harry first. The longer it takes, the longer it will be till we have sex again.” He turned around to head in to the kitchen, then stopped, spinning back to Remus, smirking. “And you’re not to touch yourself in the meantime.”</p><p>“What if Harry already knows?”</p><p>“Have you seen the way the kid acts around his peers? He’s anything <em>but </em>knowledgeable about what to do if he gets a partner—male, female, both, or neither. And be thorough about it.”</p><p>“What? You’ll read my mind if I’m not?”</p><p>Severus’ smirk widened. “<em>Wasn’t planning on it but it’s a good idea</em>.”</p><p>
  <em>Fucking mind-reader.</em>
</p><p>“<em>You never minded before.</em>”</p><p>“That’s it, I’m picking up Occlumency,” Remus snapped. Severus laughed and moved onward to the kitchen. “Just see if I don’t!”</p><p>“I believe you, Pet,” Severus said. “You could get it out of the way.” Remus followed him into the kitchen and rested his chin on his shoulder. “That’s not going to work, Remus.”</p><p>“I know, it’s just…give me a little bit of leeway?”</p><p>“Nope. I’ve had to do it for hundreds of students that aren’t even my children. Potter at least has enough brains to comprehend it. Unlike some Slytherins I can mention.”</p><p>“I’m sure you don’t even have enough fingers and toes to name everyone.”</p><p>“Not unless we include my collection of quills, fountain pens, and…actually not even that. It’s rather sad…” He turned the stove on and retrieved a pan. “My point is, you may have to do so in the future, being the Gryffindor boys’ go-to.”</p><p>“Well, how do you do it?”</p><p>“It’s better if you don’t bullshit through it, for one. I treat it like any other preliminary lesson before starting a new section of the practice.”</p><p>“Theory. Right. Obviously. You do it better.”</p><p>“Nice try,” Severus said. “Get the eggs, please.”</p><p>“You’re despicable and impossible,” Remus muttered on his way to the refrigerator.</p><p>Truth be told, it wasn’t a bad idea to at least make sure he knew how to handle romantic relationships before he started delving into them. Better to go in knowledgeable rather than blind.  And Harry had proven to feel more comfortable discussing sex and relationships with Remus anyway.</p><p>He handed the egg carton to Severus. “I just don’t really know where to start. When my dad sat me down for it, it was all about how I got to be extra careful given what I am and the like. Course, at the time, I hadn’t come out.”</p><p>“Well, my dad was too drunk half the time to bother. Never mind he had a habit of fucking my mother whether he knew I was in the room or not. Tended to run to my room and cover my ears.”</p><p>Remus shut the refrigerator, horror stricken. That Severus could say something so nonchalantly…</p><p>“I didn’t know,” he whispered.</p><p>Severus shrugged, cracking the eggs in a glass bowl. “I knew something was wrong with that then even before I really understood. But I wouldn’t do that to you, Remus.”</p><p>“I know you wouldn’t,” Remus said. He embraced him again. “You know you can open up to me about these things, Love.” It explained his disgust at his darkest fantasy back in school. “I’m here if you want to talk about your past.”</p><p>Severus poured the egg mixture in the pan. “I don’t like talking about my parents.”</p><p><em>But you want to get it off your chest,</em> Remus thought, giving him a little squeeze as he hid his face against Severus’ back. “That’s okay,” he said. “I’m not going anywhere, Love.” He released Severus and went to the pantry to make some toast. “About that punishment you’re giving me.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Will you at least help me figure out what to talk to him about?”</p><p>Severus snorted. “Yes, Remus. I’ll help with that ‘lesson plan.’ And Pet, maybe put those shackles away. We’ll worry about them later.”</p><p>Remus blushed and grabbed the cuffs, heading back to their bedroom.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>Severus set a small folio in front of Remus once Harry had gone out to enjoy the sunlight. “Is this…”</p><p>“Just some notes and the like from the times I’ve had to do it for the Slytherins.”</p><p>Remus opened it and hummed, thumbing through the graphs, pictures, and brief explanations.</p><p>“Thanks,” Remus said forlornly.</p><p>He didn’t know how to even <em>begin</em> discussing it with Harry. Add that to the prospect he might have to also talk to other boys about their growing sexuality…Remus looked at Severus.</p><p>“Help?”</p><p>“I’m helping.”</p><p>“You know what I mean.”</p><p>“He’ll receive it better from you,” Severus said. “From me, he might just be traumatized. He’s getting used to me. And I him. But you,” he grinned. “He likes you, Remus. I know you can do this better than I could. Besides,” he kissed Remus. “I’m sure you’ll see it’s not as bad as you think it is.”</p><p>“Remember when you thought Harry had a crush on me?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“What if it’s like that?”</p><p>“Then no harm done,” Severus said.</p><p>“Is this really because of the cuffs?” Remus asked. Severus snorted and walked away, patting his shoulder without a response. Remus sighed and reviewed the parchments in front of him. Well, it wasn’t as if it didn’t need to be done.</p><p>
  <em>Sooner I take care of this, the better…</em>
</p><p>He glared at Severus again, who only smirked in reply.</p><p>
  <em>No time like the present.</em>
</p><p>Remus stood and smoothed down his jumper before going outside.</p><p>“Harry, mind if we chat?”</p><p align="center">#</p><p>Granted, it could have gone much worse. But that was a small comfort for Remus as Severus laughed. Remus slapped his leg, sending Severus into another wave of jovial laughter.</p><p>“It wasn’t that bad. He’s healthily curious, if nothing else.”</p><p>“Oh come on, he asked if it was normal to be in love with one’s enemy!”</p><p>“Does it really surprise you that Draco Malfoy might have a crush on Harry?”</p><p>“No. But I am amused by it. Those two are always at each other’s throats. Or rather, it’s the classic proverb of pulling pigtails.”</p><p>“How’d it go again. Wait!”</p><p>“<em>No</em>.”</p><p>“Just one more. Not the whole thing.”</p><p>Remus sighed and waved his hand, giving Severus leave.”</p><p>
  <em>“So, wait, what if a boy likes a boy? Could it still apply or does one need physical pigtails.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No, Harry, it does apply.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry balked. “So Malfoy might actually have a crush on me or Hermione?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Uh…it’s possible, but without confronting him about it…”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m not gonna confront Malfoy!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well, you could turn it on him. Best way to shock an enemy is to be nice to them.”</em>
</p><p>Severus exited Remus’ mind. “On second thought, that’s actually adorable. What was the term Aurora used? Ah yes: I ship it.”</p><p>Remus arched a brow. “Should you be ‘shipping’ two thirteen year olds?”</p><p>“I think Malfoy’s fourteen now, actually,” Severus said.</p><p>“A technicality,” Remus snapped.</p><p>Severus shrugged. “Perhaps you’re right. It’s just a little adorable, is all. Not to mention, I’d like to see how red Lucius Malfoy can get.”</p><p>Remus hummed.</p><p>He had the misfortune of meeting the man recently. He was every bit as pompous as Severus and Harry both said. It was fun messing with his sensibilities, though, sending him a middle finger while kissing Severus in the middle of Diagon Alley after receiving Harry’s new school list.</p><p>Unfortunately, the boys had also caught the finger raised, earning a pair of giggling teenagers retreating from the argument about to ensue.</p><p>“One other thing,” Severus said. “Not entirely unrelated. The Quidditch World Cup.” Remus perked up. “You’re good, Pet. It’s a crescent moon that night. No full moon for at least two weeks after.”</p><p>“So we can go.”</p><p>“We can go.”</p><p>Remus pumped his fists in the air, falling backwards onto the bed. “Yes!”</p><p>Severus laid beside him, propping his head up on his hand. “I take it you’re excited?”</p><p>“I’ve not been able to go to any of the games in ages! Of course I’m excited!” Remus turned onto his side, grinning at Severus. “Ireland versus Bulgaria.”</p><p>“We’ll make the Bulgarians regret ever messing with the Irish!”</p><p>“Well, the Bulgarians do have Krum.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“He’s good at his job. An excellent Seeker if I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>“So is Harry. I fail to see the point.”</p><p>“He’s in his last year at Durmstrang.”</p><p>Remus sat up. “He’s still a student?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Wow.”</p><p>“Granted I’m sure Harry could get there himself if he wanted to. He’s got the talent.”</p><p>“He really does,” Remus agreed. “So, if I recall, you said you’d give me anything I want if I took care of that harrowing task.”</p><p>“It wasn’t <em>that</em> bad,” Severus said, “but I did.”</p><p>Remus straddled Severus’ waist, letting him shift to lie on his back.</p><p>“What do you want, Pet?” Severus asked, running his hands on Remus’ thighs.</p><p>Remus hummed, kissing Severus. “You’ll do anything?”</p><p>“I would.”</p><p>“Even if what I want is to cover myself in chocolate and you to lick it all off?”</p><p>Severus’s eyes darkened a bit and he licked his lips.</p><p>Remus grinned.</p><p>“After dinner, of course,” he said, wiggling enough to see Severus’ eyes glaze over some more.</p><p>“I want your wicked tongue all over me, keeping me to the edge of coming till the very end. I want you to bite me each time I beg you to let me come because I’m so close I’m going mad. Even here,” Remus cupped his groin.</p><p>“Of course, not as hard as anywhere else, just enough to hurt enough to make me remember that I’m not supposed to come till you’ve come all over me and make me drink every bit of your come just mingled with the excess of chocolate on my skin. Then once I’m clean again, only then can I come.”</p><p>Severus growled, rolling Remus on his back. “Go on, Pet,” he said, latching his teeth to Remus’ neck.</p><p>“To…to keep me from touching myself you have me tied up with my arms and legs spread wide with enough movement so you can lick as much of me as you can and bite me when I’m bad.” Severus growled again, shoving a hand down Remus’ pants and began to stroke. Remus bucked. “Um…Oh <em>fuck</em>…you’re…oh <em>god</em>…Severus…I want…I…”</p><p>Severus removed his hand and licked at the bruise he’d given.</p><p>“No. You’re not coming yet, Remus,” he purred, motioning for Remus to turn over and spread his legs. He shoved his hand back down, running the pad of a finger over the creased hole. “The things you do to your master, Pet. Go on. Tell me what else you want me to do on that night.”</p><p>“I…I want…I…I want to be beaten.”</p><p>“Beaten?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Biting isn’t enough?”</p><p>“I want you to beat me, slap me, hit me, spank me, whip me—whatever you feel fits after we’ve come. In fact, when you do this, I want one of our toys in me vibrating at such a pace, I feel I might be able to come again. But again, don’t let me, Master. Please don’t let me come till you’ve come again all over my raw skin and make me drink it again.”</p><p>Severus hummed, moving his fingers down over the perineum. He could feel Remus attempting not to buck or move.</p><p>“Anything else?” Severus asked, removing his hand so to yank Remus’ pants down to his knees so to continue the gentle massage, fingers just ghosting over Remus’ scrotum</p><p>Remus rocked his hips against Severus’ fingers. “I…I…”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>Remus whined and pushed back on the fingers. “Severus…Master…”</p><p>“I’m here, Pet. You’re so pretty like this. Maybe we should see if any of our friends would like to watch this little scene you’re suggesting.”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>!”</p><p>“Oh? You want to be watched? Maybe we should invite our <em>guests</em> to lick you off, too.”</p><p>“I thought you were insufferably jealous.”</p><p>A finger eased inside him. Remus gasped and keened at the burn, almost too painful to bear.</p><p>“I think it’s clear now that you are mine alone and will fight very hard to keep it that way. Would you like that? I wouldn’t mind watching another sub, of course. No harm in telling him or her how best to please my pet.”</p><p>The finger stroked inside him, burning and pleasing in tandem.</p><p>“I kind of like that image. You tied down and a female sub licking you clean for me and her dom alone to enjoy, telling her how to please you and how you can please her. I want to see that so bad. But we’ll explore that another time.”</p><p>The finger slid out and Remus twitched at the loss, even though it was just a pinky.</p><p>“I’ll give you that dream, Pet,” Severus said, “When do you want to embark on that little escapade?”</p><p>“Now now?”</p><p>“We don’t have any chocolate sauce on hand. Gonna have to go to the market first.” Remus hummed.</p><p>“Tomorrow night?” he asked.</p><p>Severus grinned and kissed him. “Tomorrow, then,” he agreed. He slapped Remus’ ass. “Undress and lie on your back with your legs spread for me.” Remus obeyed, grabbing the headboard. Severus gripped the base of his cock and swallowed him down, gently dragging his teeth over the flesh while the spare hand massaged Remus’ balls.</p><p>“Oh fuck…oh fuck…” Remus groaned. Severus bit down a little harder as he moved up the shaft, pressing the tip of his tongue against the slit. Remus gasped arching his back off the bed. He whimpered as Severus dragged his teeth over the head, cautious of the tip.</p><p>Severus pried Remus’ hands off the headboard and directed him to his crotch. “Well, pet?”</p><p>Remus swallowed and pulled Severus’ cock free, swallowing him down.</p><p>“Good boy,” Severus purred, running his fingers through Remus’ hair. “Do you like your master’s cock?”</p><p>Remus hummed affirmatively, bobbing his head. He moved just so that the head remained and sucked as hard as he could. Severus moaned Remus’ name as he came.</p><p>Remus lifted his head enough to meet Severus’ eyes. Severus pulled him back to stand on his knees and kissed his swollen lips.</p><p>“You are going to look so debauched tomorrow night, Pet. Might bring you to the pensieve and have it replayed for us so I can stroke you’re cock as you watch yourself go mad by my tongue. Make you scream and beg for more hands on you and I want to see you pegged…damn, Remus, I am going to fuck you till you can’t walk.”</p><p>“Promise?” Remus asked.</p><p>Severus laughed, tucking them both into the bed. “If I could do so now, I would.” Remus hummed, wiggling closer.</p><p>“Sev.”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“I like your idea, too,” Remus said. “Even if it is a woman you want to see fuck me.”</p><p>Severus snorted, pressing a kiss to Remus’ forehead. “We’ll figure out <em>my</em> fantasy later, Pet. Tomorrow is just for you and only you.”</p><p>Remus snuggled closer. “How long had you been thinking about inviting others?”</p><p>“I think it started when I suggested making Black watch me fuck you.” Remus chuckled.</p><p>“Figured as much,” he said.</p>
