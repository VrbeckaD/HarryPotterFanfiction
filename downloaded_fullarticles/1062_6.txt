    <p>Tom had always known that there was something <em>different</em> about him.</p><p>Something <em>wrong</em> with him. </p><p>He just never realised how depraved he actually was until that day. </p><p>They were in potions.</p><p>Malfoy was sprawled casually on the stool, not doing any work, but rather leaning back a little too far as he examined all the ingredients that sat displayed at the side of the classroom. The ones they weren’t supposed to touch. Casually, he read the labels aloud, asking Tom if he knew what they were; if he did, then they were put back on the shelf, if he didn’t, then Malfoy started to play with them.</p><p>He turned the bottles over and over, looking at the liquids and powders and mucoids that were inside. Really, he was like a child in a candy store looking at all the pretty coloured sweets and deciding which one he wanted to buy. </p><p>And that was fine, at least he wasn’t getting in the way. </p><p>At least, it <em>had</em> been fine, until Malfoy held up a green bottle with some dark coloured sludge-like liquid inside. Tom didn’t recognise the name, which was unusual, but whilst he was good at potions, it had never been his preferred discipline to study. So, he just went back to stirring counterclockwise and watching everyone else as they did the same. </p><p>Or, he did, until he heard a sharp intake of breath from Malfoy followed by a series of panicked noises that descended quickly into incoherence, punctuated only by the smashing of a green glass bottle. By the time Tom turned around Malfoy was staring at his forearm and getting pretty close to shouting.</p><p>For a moment, Tom looked at him unsure what exactly it was that seemed to be causing all the distraction; perhaps, he should have cared more, but it was hard to when Malfoy was so melodramatic ninety-nine per cent of the time. It was so hard to know what actually constituted as an emergency that Tom had given up bothering to try.</p><p>But now was probably an emergency.</p><p>The dark sludge that had been safely inside the glass was now, at least, partially blobbed onto Malfoy’s arm; and it moved around, as though it were sentient, squirming like a horrific cross between a slug and an octopus.</p><p>But whatever it was, it was eating Malfoy’s skin. </p><p>Corroding whatever it touched, burning at it. He could smell it, that acrid odour of decomposing flesh, dying right before his eyes, curling up and dropping onto the floor in a way that had Malfoy retching. It must have been painful too because the hyperventilating shouts that had started all this were rapidly blurring into a screaming that made the hairs on the back of Tom’s neck start to stand on end.</p><p>Then there was the blood.</p><p>It dripped, at first, then it surged; bubbling out of Malfoy’s arm like lava as whatever nasty thing it was burrowed itself deeper into his arm.</p><p>Tom just watched. </p><p>There was this twisting in his stomach and this sick feeling in his throat, but not a nausea, more a sudden shock of feeling. It was like he was suddenly aware of himself. Conscious of everything inside him from the pounding of his heart to the scratching of his shirtsleeves against his wrists, and the collar that was so hot and rough on his neck. </p><p>And Malfoy was still yelling out. </p><p>Writhing on the floor as the sludge still ate into his skin; blood continuing to swell to the surface and seeping through the white of his shirt, and into the wood of the floor, staining everything it touched with this dirty red.</p><p>And Tom just stood there.</p><p>He couldn’t stop staring at the spot it had all started. There was nothing but a hole there now, a mangled mess of blood vessels leaking and lumps of flesh hanging off and even the bone starting to dissolve.</p><p>It crackled and crunched in a way that bone should never.</p><p>Tom couldn’t even swallow as he watched. And not from disgust; there were plenty of students who’d rushed over the sinks and vomited up their lunch at the first sight of blood. But he stood there, eyes stuck to the sight like a fly in a spider’s web.</p><p>It was haunting and hypnotic, and Tom found himself gripping the edge of the desk. Clenching the wood until his knuckles were white and aching. Tom wanted to press himself into the that wood, feel the grooves against his skin, against the tightness that had coiled in his stomach. This dark, wet thing that wanted wooden splinters embedded in it. </p><p>Tom tried to swallow again; to just breathe <em>normally</em>, but the sight was just too <em>good</em> and, instead, he was hot and biting his lip and pressing his fingers so <em>hard</em> against the wood that they hurt. </p><p>The grotesqueness of it all was so all-consuming that Tom nearly didn’t notice someone watching him. </p><p>Nearly. </p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the way Harry’s eyes were directed at him, and not at the mess before them. He shifted, suddenly even more aware of how he looked and what he was doing and what everyone else was doing. </p><p>None of them was flushed.</p><p>None of them was burning and shivering. </p><p>None of them gripping onto a desk like it was the only thing holding them upright. </p><p>But Tom was, and he couldn’t stop. No matter how much Harry stared, Tom couldn’t stop himself continuing to grip the desk too hard, and breathe too heavy, and lick his lips too much, like the sight before them was mouth-watering. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, the class had been dismissed early that afternoon, and Tom didn’t even say goodbye to anyone. All he needed was to get somewhere secluded and quiet and cold and work out what was fucking wrong with him. </p><p>Tom ended up in the communal showers, but no one else showered at four in the afternoon so they were empty. Without even thinking he had stumbled into the farthest shower from the door, hands fumbling blinding for the taps and turning the temperature down to just above freezing just to try and extinguish this burning under his skin. </p><p>He didn’t even take all his clothes off before he got under the water; only his robes and his shoes and his socks were discarded in an unruly pile. The spray of the water soaking him, the cold snapping at his skin like the jaws of a predator, but Tom barely felt it, not with the aching that spread like a rot right through the fabric of his skin. </p><p>Burrowing into him.</p><p>He just wanted to water to wash it all out. To clean away these needles that were sticking into him and stop whatever monster it was that was eating him from the inside out. </p><p>But it didn’t work. </p><p>And, nearly an hour later, Tom found himself with his forehead still pressed into the tiles and his hands still balled into fists, just thinking of that moment. Replaying it in his head again, and again, and again. Each time reliving the howling and smell of burning and the shock of it. That sudden snap from normal to abnormal.</p><p>Tom squeezed his eyes shut and pretended that he couldn’t see the blood as it slicked Malfoy’s skin, and he could imagine what it would be like to shove his fingers into the hole in Malfoy’s arm, pushing at the flesh, sinking his nails into it, and hearing him scream. </p><p>He wanted to bite his lips.</p><p>Make them bleed.</p><p>Watch the red start to drip down onto the tiles and twirl like a prima ballerina down the drain. He wanted something to hold; to dig his nails into and scratch and claw and bite. He wanted something to touch, something tangible and solid and willing to just squeeze between his fingers until it was mush, and –  </p><p>“Tom?”</p><p>Tom swallowed, and stayed very still in the shower, though he didn’t turn off the water. He knew that voice, and it wasn’t who he thought might have been looking for him. No, that voice belonged to Harry. </p><p>A part of him wanted to reply, even if it was to tell Harry to go away. But his throat was so fucking dry that not even the simplest words could be formed without withering away in milliseconds. </p><p>“I know you’re in there.”</p><p>Tom clenched his teeth, grinding them together and wishing he had something else between his teeth. Something soft and yielding that he could sink his teeth into, and bite, and chew, maybe even swallow whole.</p><p>“I want to help you,” Harry said, his voice echoing around the bathroom; and though there were the overtones of confidence, Tom could still detect the faintest notes of uncertainty. As though, deep down, Harry was scared of what he might find lurking beneath the surface. </p><p>“<em>Please</em>, Tom, let me help you.”</p><p>Tom shut his eyes, “alright,” he murmured.</p>
