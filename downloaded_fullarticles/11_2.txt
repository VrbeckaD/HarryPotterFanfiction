      <p>He heard Voldemort scream,</p>
      <p>"Stun him!"</p>
      <p>Ten feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it. Gripping his wand more tightly, he dashed out from behind the angel and bellowed, pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the Death Eaters running at him.</p>
      <p>"Impedimenta!"</p>
      <p>From a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at least one of them, but there was no time to turn and look; he jumped over the Cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him; more jets of light flew over his head as he fell, stretching out his hand to grab Cedric's arm as Voldemort shrieked,</p>
      <p>"Stand aside! I will kill him! He is mine!"</p>
      <p>Harry's hand had closed on Cedric's wrist; one tombstone stood between him and Voldemort, but Cedric was too heavy to carry, and the Cup was out of reach.</p>
      <p>Voldemort's red eyes flamed in the darkness. Harry saw his mouth curl into a smile, saw him raise his wand.</p>
      <p>"Accio!"</p>
      <p>Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup. It flew into the air, and soared towards him… His heart jackhammered in his chest as he caught it by the handle…</p>
      <p>But nothing happened…</p>
      <p>His last hope of escaping was gone… The handle slipped out of his numb fingers and his head fell in defeat. In the background, the death eaters jeered and shouted as he heard Voldemort approach him,</p>
      <p>"Are you quite done with trying to escape, Harry?"</p>
      <p>Harry closed his eyes as he let go of Cedric's lifeless arm… The sense of failure weighed heavy on his soul. He'd failed him… He'd failed Cedric…</p>
      <p>The despair that filled him was a heady blackness; the means of escape he'd thought possible had vanished to black, not blocked, but like they had never been there at all. The notion of hope became meaningless, and if his mind tried to linger on such ideas they started to feel like cruel tricks, as cruel as any desert mirage. The bonds he had, the ones that kept his heart beating, felt so thin and frail and even they were a terrible weight.</p>
      <p>At least, he wouldn't have to live with his sense of failure… He wouldn't have to face Cedric's parents… Voldemort was going to kill him… He was going to die.</p>
      <p>And that didn't bother him. It should but it didn't. His mind felt oddly calm and relaxed even though his treacherous heart was trying to escape his body. It was struggling to beat its way out of his chest.</p>
      <p>He could still feel the warmth of his wand between his fingers but what good would it do him now? He could fight but it would only serve to prolong his death. There was no escape from here…Not for him at least…</p>
      <p>He felt the tip of Voldemort's wand touch his forehead. Any minute now he was going to see the green flash of light. Any minute now he was going to be gone from this world. This was the last chance he had to honour Cedric's wish. The words finally left his lips,</p>
      <p>"I have a request."</p>
      <p>The death eaters shouted insults at him, but a hush fell as, no doubt, Voldemort silenced them. The tip of the wand receded from his forehead and he whispered hoarsely,</p>
      <p>"Cedric… Could you… Could you have his body delivered back to his parents?"</p>
      <p>Voldemort was silent for a moment and then he chuckled darkly,</p>
      <p>"What a selfless request, Harry. Even now, when you are minutes away from death… You continue to think of others…You should be more concerned about what will happen to your body once you are dead."</p>
      <p>Harry opened his eyes and looked up at Voldemort…Meeting his crimson gaze head on as he spoke,</p>
      <p>"I don't care about what happens to me…Not anymore… All I'm asking is that you honour my request… Please…"</p>
      <p><em>Please</em>… Why had he said that? Was he really that desperate? Now the death eaters would probably boast that he'd begged before he'd died. But he was desperate… Cedric had died because of him. He could have lived a long healthy life if it hadn't been for him. This was all his fault and he needed to make it right. He just had to make it right before he died.</p>
      <p>There was utter silence in the graveyard and then Voldemort spoke,</p>
      <p>"It shall be done."</p>
      <p>The relief those words filled him with was indescribable. It felt like a huge weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He didn't know why he trusted Voldemort's words… For all he knew, the man could be lying but everything inside him was screaming that he wasn't. Voldemort was really going to honour his request.</p>
      <p>He could die in peace now. He dropped his wand as his final act of surrender and spoke,</p>
      <p>"Thank you."</p>
      <p>The wand returned to his forehead and Harry closed his eyes as his life flashed in front of his eyes. All those terrible years with the Dursleys… The time he'd read his Hogwarts acceptance letter… The first time he'd held his wand… The first time he'd seen Hedwig… The time when he'd met Ron and Hermione… All the moments he'd shared with them… He remembered his first time on a broomstick… He remembered the twins… He saw their smiling faces… Remembered all their jokes… He saw Sirius and Remus… He saw Hogwarts… All the corridors…The grounds… Hagrid… Professor Dumbledore…Professor McGonigal… Even Snape…</p>
      <p>It was strange how many memories he'd accumulated in his short life span and yet how fast they'd flashed inside his head. He was glad that he'd met the people he'd met… He was glad that he had people who cared about him… Who would probably be sad at his demise… Who would look for him if Voldemort burnt his body or left him to rot in this graveyard or worse… A decent burial was out of the question for him. Voldemort hated him too much and Harry was certain that his death would not be enough to satiate his desire for revenge.</p>
      <p>He drew in one last shaky breath and then a flash of light behind his closed lids threw everything into immaculate darkness.</p>
