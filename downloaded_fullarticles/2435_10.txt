<p><br/>Sirius hadn't been planning to leave Grimmauld place that day.</p>
<p>He had always known that he would leave, but he hadn't anticipated it being so sudden and unplanned. He had even threatened to run away at Christmas time and at the end of last summer (with some time spent at James’s house both times).</p>
<p>Walburga had ordered him to stay in his room, so Sirius hadn't anticipated leaving the house at all that day. Both of his parents were upset with him over the incident with Remus and nearly getting Snape killed. Walburga had been hounding him daily over having nearly been expelled. "<em>If</em> <em>it hadn't been for our family name then you would have had your wand snapped. You have no idea what your father had to do to keep it hushed up. You should be more ashamed of yourself.</em>"</p>
<p>The shame did bother him, although it wasn't for the same reasons that Walburga thought that he ought to be considering.</p>
<p>It hadn't occurred to him at the time that Remus would be upset. He had been trying to get back at Snape. It wasn't just a grudge on a classmate- Snape was involved with the dark arts and the rising presence of pureblooded witches and wizards that were against muggleborns or even worse. It seemed like a noble and courageous thing to do to take a stand against someone who spent time with Avery and Mulciber—it was possible that Snape was even involved with the Death Eaters - the secret society that Sirius had only heard whispers about when people thought that he wouldn’t overhear or from his parents.</p>
<p>If everything had gone according to plan, Snape would have been scared off a bit by seeing Remus in the werewolf state. That would have shaken him up. Sirius did feel a little guilty at the fact that Snape could have died—in the moment he hadn't considered it as that big of a potential loss. After all, if Snape was as far into the dark arts as he seemed to say then he wished the same fate on Evans and the other muggleborns. Snape would grow up to be a murderer and no one was going to stop him, so why not prevent the deaths of more innocent lives?</p>
<p>The effects that it would have on Remus had seemed more minimal at the time. Of course, Remus would be willing to do anything to get back at Snape. If Remus knew how Snape was corrupting Regulus... If he knew what Snape had said--</p>
<p>It wasn't as if Remus weren't protected. Sure, Sirius figured that he wouldn't be able to get a job after the incident, but he didn't need a job. James was wealthy. Sirius was wealthy. They could easily take care of Remus. If everything kept going at the same rate, then they wouldn't want careers after school—they would be fighting in an impending war. It didn't occur to him that Remus might eventually want a job.</p>
<p>He didn’t realize that it could have gone far worse when he made the flippant careless comment to Snape.</p>
<p>He could have ruined Remus's life.</p>
<p>Even though Sirius could be talking to James on his two-way mirror (and he had been doing that multiple times a day) he was still dwelling on what he had done to Remus.</p>
<p>A sharp knock on his door stirred him out of his misery. He stuffed the two-way mirror into his pocket. "Come in," he said, knowing he had no choice in the matter. He sat up on his bed.</p>
<p>Walburga strode into the room and sat down in a chair that she conjured, across from Sirius. "I have decided that we're going to make a plan for you, and if you promise to adhere to it then you don't have to stay in your room the entire summer," she said.</p>
<p>"What sort of plan?" Sirius asked uneasily. Even though Walburga had said 'we' Sirius was certain that she meant that she would be the one devising the plan and Sirius would have no say in the matter.</p>
<p>"First, I think it would be best that you don't spend time with beastly students at school," Walburga said.</p>
<p>Sirius managed to hold his tongue at that, even with his mother calling one of his best friends a 'beast' of all things. He could ignore it since Remus's furry little problem was hardly an issue. An argument was only going to prolong the time he had to spend listening to her, so he just stared at her, hoping to get it over with sooner. He could call her an idiot at the end of her tripe after she had worked through it. Ignoring her entirely was satisfying at times.</p>
<p>"You're also going to write an apology letter to Severus Snape," she told him.</p>
<p>"They've already made me apologize," Sirius mumbled.</p>
<p>"You're going to do it again, only properly this time," she insisted.</p>
<p>Sirius went quiet again. He was resigned to spending the rest of his summer in his room, so protesting wasn't going to get him anywhere.</p>
<p>"I'm going to speak with the headmaster and see if we can get you switched to Slytherin as well. Both your father and I feel that you have poor influences in the Gryffindor house, and that your behavior would be markedly improved," she told him.</p>
<p>She waited for a reaction from him that didn't come. He stayed silent, imagining what James was going to say about all of this.</p>
<p>"You're going to stop wearing those ridiculous muggle clothes as well. You look absurd," she added.</p>
<p>Sirius stared at her, unfazed. The comments on his attire could always be much worse given what he was wearing. Pureblood witches and wizards had no conception of which muggle clothes were currently or traditionally considered masculine or feminine.</p>
<p>"I would also like you to spend some time with Penelope Parkinson. I think that it's about time that you focus on spending a bit of time thinking about the future. I think that she would be an excellent match, although any pureblooded girl would be suitable. These muggle girls that you have on your walls are appalling," Walburga said. "Can you imagine tainting the family name and diluting the blood line? We have a duty to have witch and wizard children- I don't want you taking any chances with the possibility of squibs or worse."</p>
<p>Sirius gaped at her over that. "I'm not going to marry a pureblooded girl," he said, face reddening. "That's horrific."</p>
<p>"Sirius, we'll have to disown you if you don't marry a girl from a pureblood line. We really don't want to do that, but you must understand the necessity. You have far too many absurd ideas about muggles. You can't be a blood traitor. I'm arranging for you to spend some time with Penelope. I think it would do you a great deal of good to spend some time with someone who will be a good influence-"</p>
<p>"I'm not going to date her!" Sirius shouted. He could feel his heart race with nervousness and anger.</p>
<p>"Do you already have someone in mind then?" Walburga asked archly.</p>
<p>Sirius hesitated, nearly blurting out Lily Evans's name- James liked her all right and she was muggleborn. It would upset Walburga, but he couldn't even bring himself to do that, thinking back to a beater on the Hufflepuff quidditch team before shutting down that line of thinking entirely. "No," he said quietly.</p>
<p>"Then there's no harm in spending time with her and talking. I've arranged with her parents to have her over tomorrow evening if you're amenable to that," Walburga told him.</p>
<p>"I'm not <em>amenable</em> to that," Sirius said bitterly.</p>
<p>"Talking with her will help," Walburga continued as if he hadn't spoken. "A woman will of course understand the importance of our families and keeping pureblood lines intact. If not Penelope then perhaps Diana Rosier, Melania Crabbe, Daphne MacMillan, or Mirielle Lestrange... Maybe one of the Greengrass girls then? It's vital for our communities to-"</p>
<p>"Muggleborn girls are no different pureblooded witches. What difference would it make if I were to like them or even a muggle girl? I could be happy with either-"</p>
<p>Walburga grabbed his shoulders at that, eyes wide. "Are you seeing a muggle girl?" she demanded.</p>
<p>"What? No, I just don't think-"</p>
<p>"Are you lying to me? Have you been seeing a muggle girl?" she asked, shaking him angrily.</p>
<p>"I haven't," Sirius told her, pulling away from her.</p>
<p>"If you have been going behind my back and seeing a muggle girl like a blood traitor-"</p>
<p>"Maybe I have," Sirius said spitefully, unable to control his tongue. Only his mother would get so angry about something like this.</p>
<p>Walburga grabbed his arm harshly, yanking on him. Sirius nearly lost his footing in spite of being a head taller than her.</p>
<p>"Let go of me," he said, trying to pull away.</p>
<p>"A muggle girl? Abomination!" She shouted, close enough to his face that he wrinkled his nose at the spittle that ended up on his cheeks.</p>
<p>"You're a blood traitor! You have to end it with her this instant!" she screamed at him, waving her wand to levitate him in the air.</p>
<p>It was harmless- less forceful by far than the grip that she'd had on him earlier, but there was something disorienting about being lifted into the air and the control that she currently had over him made his heart pound and palms sweat. He felt too hot and too cold at the same time. "Put me down!" he shouted, intending to sound forceful and angry but only managing a cracking squeak that sounded more likely to come from Peter Pettigrew than himself.</p>
<p>"You should be ashamed of yourself! Do you have any idea how much shame this could bring to the family? You're an abomination! Do you have any idea how this reflects on me? On the family? Are you too selfish to even think about what your actions might do to others? How do you think Regulus feels, having a blood traitor for a brother? Or your father? Do you think he's proud to call you his son? Can you imagine what this is doing to me? You've absolutely broken my heart with your betrayal," she said.</p>
<p>Sirius squirmed. "I'm not really dating a muggle girl mum- I'm not. Honest. I just wanted to make you angry," he said.</p>
<p>Walburga put him down.</p>
<p>His legs shook under his weight and knees nearly buckled. He realized that he couldn't stop shaking.</p>
<p>"Then will you consider seeing one of the girls that I suggested? A fiancée and the responsibility that comes with that would help you get your priorities in order. Other pureblood friends and a switch to Slytherin would help as well," she continued.</p>
<p>"I'm NEVER marrying a pureblood!" he yelled. "Never! I'm not like you!"</p>
<p>“It’s for the best. Your brother has the good sense to be on the right side of everything. He’s considering joining the fight for our rights and safety with the Dark Lord after school. You should be considering doing the same. All of this nonsense that you’re involved in is risky for you and risking our family.”</p>
<p>At that point Sirius realized that if he stayed here he would never have a say in the matter- and that leaving was inevitable anyway. He was afraid of what would happen if he did stay. The same fight that he intended to be a part of after school was brewing in his own house, and if he wanted to be on the right side of things he couldn't stay.</p>
<p>He grabbed his wand and muggle skateboard that he managed to make fly. He hopped onto it and zipped out of the room.</p>
<p>"SIRIUS BLACK!" Walburga yelled.</p>
<p>He nearly ran Regulus over as he flew down the stairs on it, barely managing a semblance of the usual balance he had on it.</p>
<p>Sirius saw a flash of light out of the corner of his eye and heard a loud explosion. He landed roughly at the bottom of the stairs. It took him a second to realize that his skateboard was gone. He started immediately tearing towards the front door.</p>
<p>He winced when his mother grabbed his arm. "You get back to your room right now!" she shouted.</p>
<p>"I'm leaving and never coming back!" he screamed back at her, wrenching loose. He ran out the front door.</p>
<p>He didn't stop, running through the muggle part of London. When he rounded a familiar corner, he morphed into his animagus form, running as Padfoot for as far as he could before finding a bench and transforming back. He sat down, panting heavily and breathless from the run.</p>
<p>Sirius glanced into the two-way mirror before angling it a little away from his face, not wanting to look at James just yet.</p>
<p>"James Potter," he said.</p>
<p>"Padfoot? Hey- are you there?" James asked, not seeing him in the mirror.</p>
<p>"I'm here. I'm in London and I need you to come get me," Sirius said, hating the slight quaver in his voice.</p>
<p>"Are you all right?" James asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I think I've just been disowned. Could you come get me?" Sirius asked, failing to mask the quaver that still lingered against his will.</p>
<p>"I'll go get mum and dad. Where are you at?" he asked.</p>
<p>Sirius gave him the two nearest street corner names. He flinched as a muggle man spat a very derogatory epithet (‘<em>woofter</em>’) in his direction.</p>
<p>"Could you hurry?" Sirius asked, hoping he didn't worry the Potters too much, but deciding it was urgent.</p>
<p>"We'll be right there- I'll go get them now," James promised.</p>
<p>With that, the mirror cleared and Sirius was left feeling alone on the bench. He looked down, trying to ignore the stares of muggle passersby men and women in business suits going about their business on their lunch hour.</p>
<p>He kept nervously looking around for the Potters.</p>
<p>Sirius tensed in unease as James and his parents spotted him and headed over. Both of James's parents were friendlier towards muggles than his own parents were even if they were purebloods as well—and James had plenty of muggleborn friends at school. They were familiar with muggle clothing. The clothes that Sirius wore weren't exactly the standard fare that he dressed in during days off at school. They were muggle clothes to spite his parents, but they also had a unique campy flair to them.</p>
<p>This went beyond the standard interest in punk rock that Sirius had a predilection towards. His hair was grown out to nearly sweep his shoulders, his jean trousers were simple albeit purposefully a too tight, his shirt had a sword on it that would look kitsch for muggles but reminded him of the lost sword of Gryffindor, his nails were painted, the earrings in his ears were simple gold chains that were far too feminine with the amount of dangling and sparkling that the rubies at the bottom did, and he had more makeup on than just eyeliner typical of rock musicians – at least those feigning some semblance of heterosexuality – of the time.</p>
<p>"Did she kick you out over your outfit?" was the first question out of James's mouth when he went over to Sirius, although he had a peculiar expression of near bemusement on his face. Sirius would have never worn the outfit at Hogwarts (for fear of the damage to his reputation and a sense of insecurity) or even most public places. It was the sort of outfit that screamed for attention and was cobbled together from bits of muggle subculture that Sirius had struggled to pick up on, even growing up in Islington in London. He was never entirely sure if he even belonged on the edges of it.</p>
<p>"Erm, no. She doesn't like my muggle clothes, but that wasn't all of what we argued about," Sirius said, fiddling nervously with an earring. "I'd really like to get going before mum comes looking for me."</p>
<p>"Come along," Fleamont Potter said after a brief pause, "we'll go to where we apparated in and take you home."</p>
<p>"Thank you," Sirius said, realizing that he would need to adjust to the idea that the Potter's manor would now be his real home.</p>
<p>Fleamont put a protective hand on Sirius's shoulder as they walked back across the street to a secluded enough area where they would be able to apparate.</p>
<p>Euphemia Potter was quiet, but Sirius could see the distractedness. He tried not to dwell on what she was thinking.</p>
<p>With a pop they disapperated and found themselves in James's living room.</p>
<p>Sirius went to the wastebin and bent over, holding his hair back enough to keep the vomit out of it as he emptied the sick of his stomach.</p>
<p>"Still not fond of apparation?" Fleamont Potter asked.</p>
<p>Sirius shook his head and felt his stomach heave again. "Hate it," he said weakly, before dry heaving once more.</p>
<p>"I'll get you a pepper up potion," Fleamont told him, heading out of the room for a vial.</p>
<p>"Sorry, we would have taken the Floo, but James said that you sounded troubled," Euphemia told him, rubbing over his back.</p>
<p>"Mmm," Sirius grunted noncommittally before dry heaving again.</p>
<p>Fleamont came back in the room and handed Sirius the pepper up potion.</p>
<p>Sirius downed it and his stomach calmed. The tension he'd been carrying in his shoulders eased and he relaxed.</p>
<p>"You're welcome to stay here as long as you like," Euphemia told Sirius. "You're like a son to us."</p>
<p>"Thank you," Sirius said.</p>
<p>"Let's head upstairs a moment," she told them.</p>
<p>James and Sirius followed Euphemia to the guest room.</p>
<p>"We'll have to redo it, but this guest room will be yours," Euphemia told Sirius.</p>
<p>"I thought that-" James's protest was quickly quieted by a sharp shake of Euphemia's head, responding instinctively as any son would to a mother's silent admonishment.</p>
<p>"We can go shopping for new blankets, decorations, and anything you want to make the room feel like yours," Euphemia continued a bit more cheerfully.</p>
<p>"I thought you said that he would be staying in my room like usual," James said, disregarding his mother's earlier warning after the initial confusion passed.</p>
<p>"That was a possibility, but I'm sure Sirius will feel more at home with his own room. We don't want him feeling like a visitor," Euphemia said.</p>
<p>"I really don't mind either way. Thank you, Mrs. Potter-mum," Sirius said. He had an inkling that the room switch was more about the clothes he was wearing (and what it hinted at) than anything else, but he was just grateful for a place to stay.</p>
<p>James looked dubious, but he didn't push the issue further, merely exchanging a wordless glance with Sirius that only left his friend wondering what he was thinking.</p>
<p>"Can we go shopping at Diagon Alley now?" James asked instead of voicing any concerns. "It looks almost exactly like your room, mum, and we'll be able to spruce it up quickly."</p>
<p>"All right. Go ask your father for the galleons for the trip," Euphemia told them.</p>
<p>"Brilliant," James said, before heading back downstairs with Sirius following automatically behind him.</p>
<p>Fleamont was on the sofa, eyes unfocused and fully contemplative of the situation. He looked up when the boys bounded down the stairs. "Where are you headed so soon after getting here?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Diagon Alley. Mum said to ask you for money for some stuff for Sirius's new room," James told him expectantly.</p>
<p>"That sounds like a good idea- get your minds off of the whole thing," Fleamont told them before going to his small safe in the living area meant only for holding galleons for such excursions. "Take however much you need."</p>
<p>"Thanks," James said, grabbing out a few handfuls for the trip. He placed it in a coin pouch and headed over to the fireplace, grabbing a handful of Floo powder.</p>
<p>"See you at Diagon Alley," James told Sirius before stepping into the flame and shouting his destination.</p>
<p>Sirius followed behind him a moment afterwards with a shout, "Diagon Alley!"</p>
<p>He arrived and stepped out of the fireplace, finding James waiting expectantly for him.</p>
<p>"Do you want to go for Florean Fortesque's ice cream first, or do shopping first?" James asked.</p>
<p>"Definitely ice cream, to celebrate my disownment as the heir to the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black," Sirius said, voice singsong and mocking at the title. He grinned.</p>
<p>"Celebration with ice cream it is, then," James said, looping an arm around one of Sirius's as they headed to Florean Fortesque's.</p>
<p>They got a few questioning glances at Sirius's sartorial statement, but otherwise had a quiet walk to the ice cream shop. Once they entered, James let go of Sirius's arm and went up to the counter, ordering for both (their usual- a very pricey and extravagant sundae for each of them) and paying.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Sirius said.</p>
<p>"You're welcome," James said perfunctorily, raised on good manners. "How about we sit over there?" He gestured to an area away from the windows in case anyone related to Sirius happened to pass by.</p>
<p>"That works for me," Sirius told him, walking over and sitting down.</p>
<p>James sat down across from him. "So, what did you do to finally get your mom to disown you? What are we celebrating?" he asked.</p>
<p>Sirius wrinkled his nose. "It's actually not that spectacular," he admitted. "I don't actually know if I'm officially disowned either, but I expect so."</p>
<p>"Oh," said James, trying not to look disappointed at the lack of a story, but failing miserably. "So, then what happened?"</p>
<p>"Well, I did manage to upset mum. I suppose it was still impressive. She was already upset about having to talk Dumbledore into not expelling me over the incident with Moony. She wouldn't let me out of my room for days. Regulus wasn't allowed to talk to me either-- not that it matters since he never does anymore anyway. He's too stuck on that pureblood nonsense-- the idiot," he said.</p>
<p>"He's a prat," James agreed.</p>
<p>"Mum told me that we were going to devise a plan- I suppose to get me back on track to whatever ideal she has. Can you believe that she suggested having me moved to Slytherin? I don't think it's even possible to switch houses. I don't think Dumbledore would go for that," Sirius said.</p>
<p>"I've never heard of anyone switching," James said.</p>
<p>"Anyway, mum started hinting around the idea that I should look into getting settled down and asked me about girls and if I'd thought about who I'm going to marry someday. She seems to think that a fiancée would be a 'positive influence' on me-- especially if the girl is a pureblood."</p>
<p>The waiter dropped off their sundaes at the table, which Sirius promptly stuffed a large bite of into his mouth to give himself time to think about how much he was willing to share.</p>
<p>"And what did you say to that?" James asked.</p>
<p>Sirius winced at the ice cream headache and chewed a few of the chocolate chunks before replying. "Well, obviously I hadn't thought about it, but I don't want to marry a pureblood and said as much, so she was very angry about that. She started suggesting girls that she wanted me to consider too. They're all horrid though. Half of them would probably sleep with Voldemort given the chance, you know. Pop out little babies that say 'mudblood' as their first word," Sirius said, shaking his head. "I don't even want to think about children yet, but I know I wouldn't want them corrupted by any of the girls my mum likes."</p>
<p>"Not to mention the inbreeding," James said.</p>
<p>"Exactly," Sirius said. "Anyway, long story short, it escalated a lot. It was a big argument. I wasn't very nice, but neither was mum. She, ah, actually scared me for once. I was afraid and grabbed my muggle skateboard that I bewitched to fly. I was going to ride it out and had made it down the stairs in the house, but she blew it up. I was really afraid that she was going to really hurt me, so I just left."</p>
<p>Sirius pursed his lips together and was quiet after that, fiddling with his spoon and a small pool of melted ice cream.</p>
<p>"She scared you?" James asked after a moment.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Sirius mumbled.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," James said quietly.</p>
<p>Sirius shrugged.</p>
<p>They were both quiet for a moment, neither one eating, but both unwilling to keep discussing the uncomfortable topic either.</p>
<p>"I hope Regulus leaves," Sirius said after a moment.</p>
<p>"Me too," James said. There was a hesitant pause where he just awkwardly opened his mouth a couple times before clearing his throat. "Your mum didn't hurt you, did she?"</p>
<p>"Not really," Sirius said. "Just shook me up a little."</p>
<p>James glanced down at Sirius's arms that had curved irritated scratches. "And those?"</p>
<p>Sirius shrugged. "Again, didn't really hurt me. Just scratches. Mum grabbed me when I tried to leave," he said.</p>
<p>James didn't know how to respond to that, so just worried at his lip with his teeth for a second. "Well, here's to your disownment, and managing to leave your awful family behind," he said, raising a spoonful of ice-cream in a mock toast.</p>
<p>Sirius raised his spoon and clinked it against James's. "Cheers."</p>
<p>______________________________________________________</p>
<p><br/>"Let's go to a muggle shop too," Sirius said. "I want some muggle stuff for my room."</p>
<p>"Sure, just lead the way. I don't know much about muggle shops," James admitted. "I only know what Evans has told me. I haven't been to one myself."</p>
<p>"They're not too different," Sirius said. "We'll just have to stop at Gringotts to change some gold over."</p>
<p>"I almost forgot they use different coins," James said. "I do all right in muggle studies, but it's different actually putting it into practice isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I forgot the first time. They thought it was fake money and I nearly got thrown out of the shop. They treat me a lot better now that I have the hang of it," Sirius said as they headed into Gringotts.</p>
<p>James walked over to one of the goblins. "James Potter. I want this changed over to muggle money please," he said, plopping about twenty galleons on the counter.</p>
<p>"One moment," the goblin told him.</p>
<p>James smiled pleasantly and waited.</p>
<p>"There you are," the goblin said, handing him one hundred pounds. "May I help you with anything else?" <br/> <br/>"No, that's all," James said. "Thank you."</p>
<p>"You're welcome, have a nice day," the goblin told them, but James had already walked away before he really finished the sentence.</p>
<p>"We'll get a skateboard first. I want a new one," Sirius told him, leading him through muggle London. He went down a back street to a small shop. He led James inside.</p>
<p>"Hey welcome back," the shopkeeper said with a friendly smile. He was leaning against the counter idly.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Sirius said.</p>
<p>"Can I help you with anything?" he asked them.</p>
<p>"I need a new skateboard. My mum got rid of my old one," Sirius said.</p>
<p>"That's awful. That was a nice one," he said. "Isn't she just going to get rid of a new one though?"</p>
<p>"I moved out," Sirius said with a cheeky grin. "Moved in with my best mate and his parents."</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you," he said with a lazy wave at James. "Do you want the same model?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," Sirius decided.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper grabbed one down for them and placed it on the counter, giving them their total.</p>
<p>"Can you count it out for me again? I'm rubbish at it," Sirius said, handing over a stack of pounds that James got at Gringotts.</p>
<p>"Sure," the shopkeeper said. He counted it out. "I need five more."</p>
<p>Sirius hopelessly handed him more of the stack.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper handed him back most of it and some change. "Thank you," he said. "Are you doing modifications to this one too?”</p>
<p>"You're welcome," Sirius said. "Yeah. I haven't decided what I'm going to do to it yet though. Definitely a better paint job."</p>
<p>"Yeah it's a nice board, but a little plain," the shopkeeper said. "You'll have to bring it in once you get it painted."<br/> <br/>"I will," Sirius said with a grin. "See you."</p>
<p>"Thanks again," the shopkeeper told them.</p>
<p>James followed Sirius out. "Where to now?"</p>
<p>"I want more music records sometime soon, but that's it for now," Sirius said.</p>
<p>"Home, then?" James asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Home," Sirius said.</p>
<p><br/>_______________________________________________________</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Euphemia Potter plopped an extra helping of steak and kidney pie on Sirius's plate.</p>
<p>"We were wondering—and you don't have to tell us! Don't feel obligated! Euphemia and I were wondering what happened with your parents," Fleamont said.</p>
<p>Sirius glanced at James who had a mouth full of pie and just shrugged.</p>
<p>"They just... they're on the wrong side of all of the pureblood and muggleborn mess. You know how it is right now. They were pressuring me to keep siding with them, and I kept refusing. Mum and I had a fight over it all," Sirius said quietly.</p>
<p>"That's all?" Euphemia pressed gently.</p>
<p>Sirius nodded. "It was really bad though," he said.</p>
<p>"All right. You can tell us more about it when you feel like it," Euphemia told him.</p>
<p>"I don't want to talk about it," Sirius mumbled. "I just want to forget it. I'm here now- and everything is better."</p>
<p>"We're very glad that you're here," Euphemia told him genuinely.</p>
<p>Sirius smiled at that.</p>
<p><br/>________________________________________________________</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>"Night," Sirius said.</p>
<p>James fixed him with a look. "You know, you don't have to stay in the guest room if you don't want to, even if mum strongly suggested it."</p>
<p>Sirius licked his lips and rubbed at the back of his neck awkwardly. "It's all right. I don't mind. No sense in getting disowned twice in one day, right?" he joked.</p>
<p>The joking manner wasn't enough to keep James from realizing the hurt and truth behind that statement. "Come on- at least come to my room for a little while. I want to talk to you," he said.</p>
<p>Sirius shrugged one shoulder noncommittally and followed James into his room.</p>
<p>James sat down on the bed. "We've been sleeping in the same room for five years now. I don't expect you would suddenly do anything different now," he said. "Even if mum and dad saw your clothes today and thought that you're a – well, a you-know-what – they aren't going to kick you out of the house. They're not like your parents. They're still letting you stay, even thinking that."</p>
<p>"I don't know if I am or not. I mean, if I like blokes or not," Sirius told him, glancing away to avoid seeing his reaction. He strongly suspected that he might be interested in men, and had thought about it a considerable amount, but he still wasn’t entirely sure.</p>
<p>"That's all right," James said, awkwardly clapping his shoulder. "Like I said, I don't care. Moony's a werewolf after all. There are worse things to be."</p>
<p>Sirius felt a bit flustered at that, but had a hard time pinpointing why. "It's not exactly the same. Moony doesn't like being or want to be a werewolf. I think- if I do like blokes, then it's not going to be something that I'd want to change. I'm just not sure if I do like them or not."</p>
<p>"If you're not sure, then it's even more ridiculous to have to stay in your room all of the time. If you end up liking girls then secluding yourself is pointless, and we're like brothers anyway even if you do like boys. It'll be like our room at Hogwarts or any other summer vacation when you stay over. Plus, if you get sick of my snoring then you can still go to your own room," James said.</p>
<p>Sirius finally relaxed. "You're right," he said. "I'll go change and be back."</p>
<p>"That's better," James said brightly.</p>
<p>Sirius headed to the guest room, pausing to look in the mirror for a second. He tugged off his t-shirt and wiped his face off with the inside of it, the make-up smearing over the fabric. Once he had enough of it off to be satisfactory he tossed his shirt in the general direction of the laundry basket.</p>
<p>He carefully set his earrings on the bedside table before changing into the new Gryffindor themed pyjamas that he had bought.</p>
<p>James did seem more at ease when Sirius came back in the room without the make-up and earrings.</p>
