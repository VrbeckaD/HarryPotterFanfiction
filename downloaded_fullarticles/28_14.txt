    <p>For as long as Hermione could remember, she was 'different' from all the other children in her neighborhood. Well, let's face it, as far as most of the adults in her community were concerned, she was an 'odd duck' - honestly, what 'normal' kid was reading and writing at the age of two! On the other hand, Hermione's parents were thrilled that their only child was a budding genius (they had her tested!) and did everything to encourage her ceaseless thirst for knowledge - trips to the library were a weekly necessity (sometimes twice a week when Hermione snuck in a couple more hours of reading after her parents finally nodded off to sleep).</p><p>But, being the ever practical parents, Drs. Jeanne and David Granger realized that Hermione would never be content being relegated to the local creche while they both were at work at their growing dental practice. So, they began the arduous task of interviewing a seemingly endless stream of applicants for Hermione's live-in tutor/caregiver.</p><p>Fortunately, the very last respondent from the au pair agency was absolutely perfect. Maybe a bit too perfect in hindsight, but after two weeks of dealing with complete dunderheads, the Grangers were getting downright tetchy. </p><p>Dorothea Figg (or 'Dot' as she insisted on being called) was a short (5' 2"), athletic, 20-year-old university student with waist-length, sandy-blonde hair tied back with a black ribbon into a low ponytail. Her sapphire blue eyes sparkled when she first caught sight of the bushy-haired little girl shyly hiding behind Jeanne. Hermione quickly overcame her bashfulness when she spotted the variety of textbooks peaking out from the large, grey canvas backpack hanging over Dot's left shoulder. </p><p>"Do you like to read, too?" Dot asked Hermione. Jeanne and David chuckled at their daughter's beaming smile. "I think you just make a friend for life," laughed Jeanne. After reading Dot's introduction letter from the agency,and asking numerous questions regarding her education and child-care training, David said "based on your credentials and the references you've given, I believe you are exactly the person we've been looking to hire. Can you move-in this weekend and start work on Monday?</p><p>"Of course," replied Dot.  "I travel light, so most of my things only take up two large boxes. I can be here at noon on Saturday or sooner if you require." </p><p>"Noon on Saturday's perfect," said Jeanne. "We'll finish readying the guest room and see you then."</p><p>After a quick chat with Hermione to assure her that she was coming back in two days time, Dot shook the Granger's hands in thanks, re-shouldered her backpack, and headed out the front door. </p><p>Dot then quickly walked a block down the street, stepped into a dark alley behind the local pub, looked about to make sure no one was around and disapparated with a soft 'POP'.</p><p>"So," said a heavily accented voice when Dot appeared in the warmly lit sitting room. "Is she the one we've been looking for?"</p>
