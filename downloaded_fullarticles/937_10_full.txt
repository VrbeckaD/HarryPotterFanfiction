    <blockquote class="userstuff">
      <p>Welcome to my dumpster fire!<br/>This is an AU rewrite. Harry Potter is out of character because he's now Hellion! He's a Slytherin, has a mouth on him, carries a switchblade, and will punch you. No, he does not trust adults.<br/>Because this is a rewrite, there is some text taken directly from the books. This is /not/ an attempt at plagiarism. I am receiving nothing from this work and don't pretend I have any actual rights to absolutely anything Harry Potter related. What it is, is an attempt to create the cliche (or classic) HP-rewrite-trope, build a more seamless AU, and most importantly, create a familiar and safe environment to introduce Hellion!<br/>I hope you accept him because I love him so much.<br/>This is "book one", and this is only "book" that will have lifted text. Again, the most important reason why I've attempted this is to try to present Hellion in place of our beloved Harry Potter.<br/>A giant thanks to Caty for being my beta. I appreciate you so incredibly much. Thank you for overthinking so I don't have to. :D But seriously, thank you. Your ideas, puzzlement, and what-if's breathe life into these things I try to do.</p>

  <em>
    <span>1988</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was so cold. He was shaking a little, but the bright Christmas lights, the joyous bells, and the laughter and excited chatter around him were enough to help him pretend he was warm. He was trying very hard to keep up with his aunt, knowing full well that she would leave him behind if he got lost. They had only come into the city because his cousin Dudley had demanded this new top-of-line toy that only recently came out, and it was very crowded being so close to the holiday.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry didn't mind though. He liked the city, especially around the holidays. Plus, it was a rare treat for him to be allowed to come. Sure, Aunt Petunia didn't really have a choice with no one available to watch him, but Harry could pretend he was wanted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sorry," he mumbled, bumping into someone. He tried stepping out of the way but unintentionally stepped into the middle of a big group coming out of a store. "Sorry, sorry, sorry," he chanted trying to rush out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Move it," one man grunted, shoving him away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sorry, sorry!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stumbled out of the crowd and looked around. He couldn't see his aunt anywhere.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, no."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jogging, he tried going all the way down the street. He looked both ways, but nothing. He stood on the tip of his toes, but that was no help at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Would his aunt come back this way? Maybe he could find where she parked the car? Wait there?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An hour later, Harry was freezing and mildly panicked. He tried to ask for help but no one would even stop to look at him properly. One bloke merely shoved a banknote at him. Harry had no idea what to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You lost, kid?" asked a gruff voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry spun to see a homeless man sitting at the mouth of an alley. He was bundled in a ripped, faded blanket and a beanie with several holes in it. He had a cardboard sign leaned against a bag next to him, asking for money and food.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded shyly, unsure what to make of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Where's your parents at?" the man asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry stepped a little closer to hear better and noticed a distinct stench of someone unwashed. Someone who had been unwashed for a while, by the smell of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I don't have any," Harry answered him. "I got separated from my aunt."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man nodded as though he expected nothing else. "D'you know where to go fer the police?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry bit his lip and shook his head. "They wouldn't want me doing that."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man frowned then coughed. Worried, Harry scuttled closer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Are you okay?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man continued to cough, and despite the smell, Harry gently patted the man on the shoulder, wanting to help but not knowing how. "I'm fine," the man wheezed. "Why… why wouldn't they want you ter go ter a rozzer?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry crossed his arms against a breeze, wishing he had a warmer, thicker coat. "Because… just, they would be angry if I did."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man considered him some, and Harry considered him back. The man looked cold as well, and Harry was willing to bet he himself had on warmer clothes than the man did. Remembering the pound the other man had shoved at him earlier, Harry brightened a little and pulled it from his pocket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Here," he smiled. "I hope this helps."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man looked at the pound then threw his head back and laughed. "You keep it," he coughed. He then asked where Harry lived and dug a few more pounds out of his own pocket. "You take this, go't the bus, ask the driver if they go to Surrey. If they don't, ask which bus does. Then take this money and ride home, son."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was stunned. "But you need this money."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man smiled a yellow-tooth smile. "I can get more. You need ter get home."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took a little convincing, but eventually, Harry took the money, found a bus station, did as the man instructed, and a few hours later, was knocking on the front door of 4 Privet Drive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Told you," Uncle Vernon yelled as soon as he opened the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Is it him?" Aunt Petunia asked from the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes," Uncle Vernon snarled, roughly grabbing Harry by the collar then swiftly locking him in his cupboard and telling him he was to get no meals for two days as punishment for getting lost.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>During those days, Harry thought about the homeless man in comparison to himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both had clothes that barely did anything except keep them from being nude. They both went hungry and probably had about the same amount of time between meals. They both were looked down upon by most people, both called names, and both got sick easily if the man's cough was anything to go by. The difference between them was that Harry at least had shelter, and if an illness or injury got bad enough, got some care. Though, his eyesight was getting worse, but it wasn't bad enough yet where his aunt and uncle would do anything about it. He was sure any day now his teacher would send him home with a letter, and that would just lead to further punishment on his part, even if he got his eyesight fixed in the end.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yes, Harry may have had a roof over his head, but was the cost really worth it? The man on the street was really nice. That didn't promise everyone on the street was, he knew that. But… the homeless man was confident he would get more money. A lot of people just shoved money at homeless people—he knew, he saw it every time he got to go out with his aunt. They were mostly ignored, and better yet, they weren't punished. They were free to find their own food, not locked in a cupboard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe it was the hunger that drove him away. Maybe it was the way his aunt and uncle looked at him versus the way the homeless man did. Maybe it was the way Uncle Vernon backhanded him so hard he hit the wall, fell to the floor, then was thrown in his cupboard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ultimately, it was because they forgot to lock him in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, late in the night on Christmas Eve, Harry snuck out of his cupboard. He nicked his cousin's big, thick coat, some gloves, a scarf, and a hat, a backpack stuffed with food, a pillow and blanket, along with his toothbrush, his cousin's toothpaste, and some toilet tissue just in case. He grabbed some other things he thought he might need, and also stole however much money was in his aunt's purse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, he left a note on the kitchen table:</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Merry Christmas. I'm never coming back.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>-Harry</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Unbeknownst to Harry, as he wrote those words and signed his name, a blood protection running through his veins shifted, leaving the house with him and keeping him from sight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>1991</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus was tired, annoyed, and couldn't believe he was doing this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry Potter had been missing for over three and a half years. He still remembered the day it happened—blasted child had to choose Christmas Day. Mrs Figg, per her assignment, went over to deliver fruitcake and check on the child. She reported he wasn't there, and that something seemed off with the Dursleys. A few spells, and they easily confirmed the boy wasn't anywhere in the area. A few pointed questions at Petunia and her muggles, and they showed them the note Potter left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At first, Severus thought it was clearly a tantrum of a spoiled child, but while Dumbledore was questioning the muggles, Severus slowly explored the downstairs, hoping that if he got busy looking there, he wouldn't have to be the one to search the brat's bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he peeked into the cupboard under the stairs, he did not expect what he found. A few detection spells later, and the abuse was clear to Severus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He told the Headmaster this, but Albus dismissed him, saying he must have been mistaken.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Months later and Potter still hadn't resurfaced, Severus told McGonagall. She confronted the Headmaster, but again he dismissed it, confident in the child's care.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When a year passed, they both confronted Dumbledore again, as the odds of the child being alive at all at that point were practically nil, and they felt the Dursleys deserved punishment for it. That was when the Headmaster revealed a small crystal that he had spelled himself and would have told Dumbledore if Harry Potter's heart was no longer beating.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn't long after that Dumbledore himself finally started to show signs of being deeply concerned. When they reached the two-year mark, Albus finally broke down and revisited the Dursleys to do official spell work. It revealed years of abuse and neglect. McGonagall and Severus shared a long look, but neither said anything. The guilt on the Headmaster would have had to have been enough for then.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Several random reports would come in from time to time, different witches and wizards reporting they had seen Harry Potter. Some of them reported he looked ill or injured, was dirty or seemed homeless. Others reported he looked like a normal, happy child. No matter which, they were enthusiastic about meeting the Boy Who Lived and was happy to tell whoever would listen, causing Hogwarts to have to head the Ministry off before they could get too suspicious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not long after a report of Harry Potter attempting to actually attack a wizard, Dumbledore brought up binding spells Severus could do to find the boy. After all, the boy's father did save Severus' life. Neither party had activated any kind of Life Oath owed, but Severus could now, and that oath would be transferred to his son. It could help find him, as it was clear at this point that the boy's own magic must have been preventing him from being found. Not even Dumbledore's private resources at the Ministry could find Potter's Trace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus begrudgingly said that he would activate some kind of Life Oath as a final, desperate attempt before they had to get the Ministry officially involved, which would inform the entire wizarding world that their Boy Who Lived was missing, and if they were unlucky enough, that he had been missing for quite some time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now, it was less than a fortnight before the start of what should be Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts. Severus had put it off for as long as possible. If he failed, Dumbledore could weasel out of any blame the Ministry would want to give, but they would perhaps be successful at finding the boy. If he succeeded, then, apparently to Dumbledore, everything was still… 'salvageable'.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus booked a room at the Leaky Cauldron as most sightings and results of their own searching put Potter in London over the years, and at midnight, performed the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Debitum Ad Vitae Perficitur</span>
  </em>
  <span>, a ritual and oath that would almost assuredly allow Severus to find the boy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Four hours later, he was walking some questionable streets of London, and thanks to the headlights of a passing car, was able to just catch a familiar messy pile of black hair of a short someone ducking behind a dumpster. If Severus didn't know he was looking for James Potter's son, he would have thought it was an eleven-year-old James Potter himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He slowly approached.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Harry Potter?" he asked quietly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Potter, you need to come out. Enough is enough."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was almost eerie, his footsteps on the wet pavement being the only sound above a light dripping of water from the rain earlier that night. He tried to push down his annoyance, positive he was going to find a frightened child huddled next to the brick wall. However, when he peeked over the dumpster, nothing was there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, there was a sharp pain slicing at his ankle, and he jumped back, shocked, to find Potter had ducked underneath the dumpster and just swiped at him with a switchblade. The few feet he stumbled back was enough for the young boy to dart out from his hiding place and take off down the alley toward the street.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus growled and Apparated to the mouth of the alley to block Potter's exit. "Think again, Potter."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy got into an obviously well-practised defence position, knife up and ready to strike. He was short, coming to about Severus' midsection. His hair was matted, unwashed, and sticking up every which way. What was startling in what little streetlight there was, was that Severus could see the boy had his mother's eyes. He was squinting though, and Severus wondered if it was natural for the boy because of that fierce look on his face or not. He wore battered, dirty trousers and a ripped shirt. He reeked to high heaven as well, but honestly, otherwise, he looked alright.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus resisted the urge to roll his eyes at the child's attempt to look threatening and held up his hands. "Put down the weapon, Potter. You will lose in a fight against me, and I can find you now, no matter where you go."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Rubbish," the boy snarled. "Move."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No. This has gone on long enough, Potter. It's time to return to your world."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I left 'em years ago. I've made it this far—I don't need 'em!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus really did roll his eyes this time. "Not </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> world, you daft muppet. The wizarding world."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Confusion flickered across the boy's face briefly, but he otherwise didn't react. "Move."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus narrowed his eyes and tilted his head. "You do know about the wizarding world, yes?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Move. I don't wanna hurt you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I can assure you, foolish child, you won't hurt me. Answer my question."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Won't hurt you?" the boy curled his lip. "I'd like to see you try to say that with your throat slit."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was an unusually ominous, and disturbing, threat from someone so young. Especially since, in that moment, Potter looked like he was capable of fulfilling it. "If you even try, you will be the one hurt, Mr Potter."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Stop callin' me that!" the boy hissed. "Move out of my way!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus took a step forward, trying to see any angle that could get the boy to put the weapon down. Albus had sounded so positive all these years that the boy was still just as pure and innocent as ever. The boy he was looking at now was anything but.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I mean it," the child growled. "Stay back."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you want me to stay back or move?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Both."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus took note of the brief fear that flashed in the boy's eyes as he tried to get closer. The child scuttled backwards more but was obviously still ready for attack. "And if I don't?" Severus challenged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'll kill you if I have to," the child said softly. "And I'm warnin' you, if you don't stop, it may not be up to me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus froze then, a slight chill racing down his spine. There were several implications of that statement, even though Potter most likely meant his own accidental magic, but it wasn't at all good or okay. Well, it was indifferent to him, really, he knew they both would be fine due to his skill and the oath he activated if a pimp or the like came after them, but not good for the boy's past years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What exactly had been happening to Harry Potter?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and told himself just to focus on solving the immediate issue: getting Harry Potter into custody of some kind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Enough. Harry Potter, I know you grew up in an abusive home and ran away years ago. I am not here to take you back. I am here to offer you an entirely different world from either them or the streets, which," he sneered, looking the boy up and down, "has obviously been your residence for a while. I'm offering a chance to get three square meals a day, a warm bed, friends among your age group, and even a chance to actually learn something."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If his impromptu speech didn't work, Severus thought his usual teacher-tone would. Instead, Potter snarled harder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Right," the child drawled, "and you'll just do tha' out of the kindness of your heart. No need to run drugs for you or suck you off. Listen here, you perv, I don't care if you're from the Dursleys, the Spooks, or just some sick fuck—you will move out of my way or I will make you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a time, once, when Severus saw those exact same eyes look that fierce and threatening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Never, however, had he seen those eyes also look haunted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In that moment, he had no doubt this boy would do his best to fulfil his threats, and also, in that moment, something shattered in Severus. For all these years, he thought of Harry Potter in one of four ways: as the symbol of his guilt for having betrayed Lily so thoroughly, as a symbol of his heartbreak for losing Lily, as </span>
  <em>
    <span>James Potter's</span>
  </em>
  <span> son, or as Lily's son.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now, he was pulled fully to the present with the child's words, with the sharp smell of the child's body odour, the stench of the dumpster, the crisp scent of the rain, the slight </span>
  <em>
    <span>swoosh</span>
  </em>
  <span> of traffic, and those green eyes on such a young face, set so deadly…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At that moment, the child stopped being anyone's son. At that moment, seeing Lily's eyes on such a young James' face, but eyes so much older than either of them ever became, he couldn't help but see this child as his own person. Any whispers of his past grudges or feelings dissipated rapidly, and Severus realised he was only holding on because… because it was what he used to gauge himself. His morals and everything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking down at an eleven-year-old child, brandishing a switchblade and more than ready to harm him with it… his morals </span>
  <em>
    <span>finally</span>
  </em>
  <span> found a gauge of their own, after all these years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He swallowed, then squatted so he was the shorter one. The child obviously didn't expect nor like that, taking several more steps back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm not going to fight you. Nor am I going to let you hurt me or yourself. I'm here to take you home—to your </span>
  <em>
    <span>real</span>
  </em>
  <span> home. The one your parents wanted you to have."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no mistaking the sudden desire that shone in the child's eyes, but he was far from letting his guard down. "I bet. And next you'll be tellin' me you knew me parents and tha' I'm somethin' special. I may've been born at night, Spook, but it wasn't last night."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"As a matter of fact, I did know your parents. Lily and James Potter. Your aunt Petunia was Lily's sister."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Surprisingly, that broke through to the boy. He narrowed his eyes, studying Severus for several long moments, then asked, "Who are you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"My name is Severus Snape."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The child readjusted his grip on the switchblade. "Don't ring no bells. I'm not goin' anywhere with you, so unless you want somethin' else, you can go."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus considered him then said, "I merely want you to listen. I can get you some fresh clothes, take you somewhere to wash up, and buy you breakfast. All I ask for in return is for you to listen to what I have to say."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took several more long moments, but then the boy finally lowered his weapon, his obvious hunger surely the only reason he was agreeing. "You try anythin' funny, you'll be sorry."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus inclined his head then stood. Figuring offering to take the boy back to the room he booked wouldn't go over well, he asked, "Where to?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The Y," the boy said immediately and began walking around him and away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus followed, being sure to keep his distance, and when they passed by an all-hour supermarket, he had them stop to buy the boy new clothes and shoes. The boy looked surprised Severus actually bought him those things, and thanked him genuinely, but he still only came close enough to Severus to grab the bags before putting distance between them again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus followed him several blocks to another building where Potter smirked and had Severus pay off the guard to allow the child to slip in and use their facilities. Severus half expected the boy to find some other way out once finished and scurry off, but he was pleased when the freshly washed boy came back to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sun was beginning to rise when the two found a diner and went inside. The boy led them to a back booth and sat with his back to the wall. Severus didn't comment on it, nor when the boy ordered water, orange juice, and tea.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So," Severus opened, wondering how to start this, "Potter, there's a lot-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I told you not to call me tha'," the boy scowled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus raised an eyebrow. "Then what shall I call you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"They call me Hellion."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do they," Severus drawled. "Why am I not surprised?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Shut up and tell me wha' you were gonna tell me. I don't have all day."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Somehow I doubt that," Severus sneered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And somehow I don't care."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus' lips quirked at the boy's flare, and he settled back in his seat, deciding to get to the point. "When you were born, your name was put on a list of future students of Hogwarts. It's the same school your parents went to. This September would mark your first year there. It's a boarding school—an opportunity for a home between the months of September and June."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A muscle in the boy's jaw twitched. "Prove it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus reached into the inside pocket of his casual robes and pulled out a Hogwarts letter address to the boy. As soon as the child saw it, his eyes went wide. "I take it you recognise this?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"'Em birds. They kept droppin' similar ones near me, but they wouldn't leave, so I didn't take the bait."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus noted his wording. He slid the letter over to him, waiting patiently as the boy very carefully reached out and took it. Potter stared down dumbly at it, the letter addressed only as 'Harry Potter' as no one could find where the boy was, and Potter didn't even look up when the waitress came over with their drinks; he simply ordered a soup.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus thought this was easier than he originally assumed it would be until the boy opened the letter and began reading it. His face immediately hardened, and he crumbled it up and threw it at Severus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Problem?" Severus sneered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I dunno wha' you're playin' at, but you can leave. I listened to your tosh, so go."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It is not tosh."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Right," Potter sneered back, "I'm a wizard. You're here to sweep me up and whisk me off to a magic kingdom."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus took a breath to regain some patience and slowly pushed the crumbled letter back across the table. He crossed his arms. "Your scepticism is understandable. However, you aren't listening to me, are you? I can explain it all if you allow me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Fine," the boy crossed his arms too. "Explain. Start with how you know both me parents' names and my aunt's."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus frowned. "I believe I've already said that I knew them."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The Spooks only know me parents' names. They don't know nothin' 'bout the Dursleys."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Spooks…" Severus repeated, finally catching on that the strange term meant witches and wizards rather than the muggle law enforcement as Severus had initially assumed. "That's why you decided to listen to me. Others from our world have been searching for you for years, and you've run across others who recognised you. But they only knew of your parents…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter didn't say anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus sighed, leaning forward. "Look, Potter-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hellion."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hellion," Severus nodded begrudgingly. "How about I start from the beginning…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Surprisingly, Potter didn't interrupt him and listened attentively, though his expression was blank, and Severus had no idea how the child was taking the news.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus explained that magic was real, asking the boy that if he didn't believe him, think back to whenever he was able to do something he couldn't explain. He told him that the boy's parents were magical, that they had actually met at the school being offered to Potter, and explained that when he went missing, many people in their world tried looking for him, but that, they theorised, the child's own magic prevented him from being found. He told Potter that he was able to perform a specific ritual, though he didn't tell him what kind, that allowed Severus to finally get close to the boy. He also explained that he knew Petunia because he also went to school with Potter's parents, although he made sure to mention how he only just knew them, that they weren't friends or close at all to head off any questions from the boy, just in case.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They fell quiet soon after the food arrived, and they stayed in silence as they ate, the boy drinking the soup like he did his other liquids. He seemed to be doing it carefully, and it made Severus wonder when the last time the boy ate was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So," Potter eventually said, "the Dursleys lied to me. This whole time I've actually been pretty normal, for this new world."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"In a way, yes."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lips pursed, Potter uncrumpled his letter and read through it again. Then he looked up at Severus, meeting his eyes with another hard expression. "I still need you to prove it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus raised an eyebrow in question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If you're a wizard, prove it. Do magic."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Annoyed, Severus huffed. "Not here."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter shrugged. "Sorry, I'm ain't goin' nowhere else with you. Either prove it, here, or leave."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Internally grumbling because he knew the child meant what he was saying, Severus took a careful glance around. Positive no one was looking, he pulled out his wand, the quickly transfigured Potter's empty teacup into a mouse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter's eyes widened. "Wow."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Smirking, Severus transfigured it back, then jumped when Potter protested.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No! Turn it back!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Curious, Severus did. He watched carefully as Potter smiled slightly and gently coaxed the small, white mouse into his hand. He kept a soft smile as he pet the creature, then he bent over and began whispering to it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Potter," Severus hissed, a bit appalled at the child's behaviour.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter, however, didn't seem to hear him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Potter," Severus tried again, looking around and glad to see the early morning patrons weren't looking still. "Potter… Hellion."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy's head snapped up, clearly surprised. "Wha'?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Were you even aware I was addressing you?" Severus asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sorry," Hellion shrugged, still petting the mouse. "What d'you say?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Filing that away, Severus moved on, "Put the mouse back."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No," Hellion argued, cradling the creature to his chest, "I wanna keep 'im."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You can't keep a transfigured mouse, you foolish boy," Severus hissed at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why not?" Hellion replied petulantly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Because it's not actually a mouse," Severus answered. "It's a teacup."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Looks like a mouse to me," Hellion challenged defiantly. "It's breathin' and everything!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It will eventually turn back into a teacup because </span>
  <em>
    <span>that's what it is</span>
  </em>
  <span>."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hellion frowned.  "Can't you do something to make it stay a mouse?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No," Severus sighed. "Put it back on the table."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hellion eyed him critically, then he sagged, pouting, and did as he was told. Severus returned the mouse back to a teacup just in time for the waitress to come over to see if they needed anything and clear off the table. As Severus asked for the check, Hellion studied his letter again. Severus watched as his childish pout turned into a real, resigned frown.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slowly, with what sounded like genuine sadness, Hellion said, "Thank you for the offer, but I can't."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why ever not?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hellion spared him a look like he was an idiot then stared out the window and crossed his arms over his stomach. "I ain't got no money."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You actually have quite a lot of money."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hellion eyed him again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Your parents left you plenty of money. It's just our kind of money, not the kind you're used to. I'll show you where the wizard bank is and give you your key regardless, but if you accept your enrolment, I can also show you where to buy all the things you need. I'm even willing to help book you a room at a wizard inn until the start of term, and I have with me your train ticket to get to school. It's completely up to you. What do you say?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hellion stared at him completely expressionless for almost a full minute before he hunched in on himself more and looked down. After a moment, he nodded, agreeing, but his hair and posture hid his face completely. Severus could only imagine what the child was feeling or thinking, and he suddenly felt some bitterness and anger on behalf of the boy, knowing that whatever happened from that point forward, the child probably wasn't going to have an easy life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It suddenly didn't seem fair.</span>
