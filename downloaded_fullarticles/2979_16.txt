    <p>...SPN...</p>
<p>Now I pray The Lord my soul to take as I lay me down to sleep.</p>
<p>There it was again the same prayer just like it had been everyday for the last ten years. Something was up with this kid. At first it was just odd maybe a child’s mistake but now the kid was fifteen and it was still the exact same prayer. It was bugging him at this point. He wanted... no needed to find out what was happening with this kid and it would be a perfect way to get all four of his oldest sons to work together. Yes. That is what he’d do. Send the boys down to get answers. “Archangel meeting, now please boys.” He called throughout the Heavens. </p>
<p>A few minutes later all four of the archangels walked into the room. “Father.” Michael said as he took a seat at the table followed by Raphael, Lucifer, and Gabriel. </p>
<p>“What is this about? We just had a meeting this morning.” Raphael questioned.</p>
<p>“Yes, I know, but something as come up and I have a mission for you all.” God or as he preferred to be called Chuck replied. </p>
<p>“For all of us. What is this mission?” Lucifer asked leaning on the table. </p>
<p>“I need you all to go to Earth.” Chuck replied. </p>
<p>“Earth? Wouldn't it be better to just send Gabriel.” Michael said glancing at the fourth born archangel who was playing with his phone.</p>
<p>“Gabriel, please stop texting Sam and pay attention.” Chuck said with a sigh. “If I didn't think something could be wrong then yes I would just send Gabriel but I have a feeling that all four of you are going to be needed.” </p>
<p>“You have a feeling. Why don't you just tell us what this is all about?” Lucifer snapped glaring at his father. </p>
<p>“I wish I could but all I know is the kid as been praying the exact same thing for the past ten years. That the child is a boy of fifteen years old this July and he as something to do with one of Death's Prophecy.”</p>
<p>“Your talking about the soul kid aren't you.” Gabriel spoke up as he put his phone away.<br/>
“Soul kid?” Raphael questioned tilting his head to the side as he looked from his little brother to his father and back again.</p>
<p>“Yes the soul kid, so you've heard him too.” Chuck replied.</p>
<p>“ Everyday for the last ten years always the same thing. Now I pray The Lord my soul to take as I lay me down to sleep.” The Messenger said. </p>
<p>“Wait a minute, you both have been hearing this soul kid pray this same thing for ten years and have done nothing?” Raphael snapped in anger a child was so obviously in trouble and his father and brother knew and didn't do anything. </p>
<p>“Calm down Raph. I tried to figure out what was going on with him but I couldn't find him.” Gabriel said. </p>
<p>“That is bullshit, Gabriel.” Raphael hissed. “Your an archangel. We can find anyone.”</p>
<p>“We couldn't find the Winchesters.” Michael replied softly.</p>
<p>“Because of Castiel.” Raphael snapped. </p>
<p>“Boys! Enough. I can tell that right now the boy is on his way to London. I want you all to meet up with him and find out why he is praying to die.” Chuck ordered. </p>
<p>“Of course Father.” Michael said as he stood from the table. </p>
<p>“Michael wait we can't just ambush the kid.” Gabriel said. </p>
<p>“We aren't going to ambush the child, but we can watch him and assess the situation.” Michael replied with a look that screamed just because I'm a warrior doesn't mean I can't use my brain brother I know when to fight and when to watch.</p>
<p>Gabriel smiled at the look. “Alright let's go watch the kid and get a plan in place as to what to do.” </p>
<p>….HP….</p>
<p>Harry Potter gripped his Firebolt as he flew through the air over London. The air seemed heavy like the wind was holding its breath. The teenager looked around for what had to be the hundredth time. Something was watching him he just knew it, but what. Was it the Death Eaters? Or maybe Voldemort himself? “Easy Harry we’re almost there.” Remus Lupin called out.</p>
<p>“You said that an hour ago.” Harry called back.</p>
<p>“Yes I know. Mad-eye.” Remus replied.</p>
<p>“Fine. Let's head in.” The auror snapped angling his broom down toward the city. </p>
<p>...SPN…</p>
<p>“We are going to lose him.” Lucifer huffed.</p>
<p>“No we aren't. Just watch Luc.” Gabriel said. So they did. The boy along with his companions flew into the city and to a roll of townhouses. Gabriel smiled as he felt the wards. “Come on. I can get us in.” </p>
<p>“How?” Raphael questioned.</p>
<p>“Later Raph. Just follow me and stay invisible.” Gabriel said. </p>
<p>...HP…</p>
<p>Harry smiled as he hugged Sirius. “I'm glad to see you. How have you been?” </p>
<p>“Bored mostly. Just sitting around here.” Sirius answered. “Come on let's get something to eat.” Sirius said leading Harry into the kitchen. The next few hours past in a blur of food and friends and laughter. </p>
<p>“Padfoot.” A voice boomed out. </p>
<p>Sirius jumped to his feet. Remus following quickly. “What is it? Who is it?” Voices called all around them. </p>
<p>The two men ignored them and called out. “My Lord Loki.”</p>
<p>“Moony I see you are here as well. Where have you been? I have heard nothing from any of you for years.” The voice (Loki) boomed out again.</p>
<p>“Things happened… a lot of things. Please join us for a meal and we will explain.” Remus replied.</p>
<p>“Gladly. I've heard of Molly Weasley’s cooking.” A man said as he appeared in the doorway three others behind him. “Can my companions join you as well?”</p>
<p>“Of course My Lord.” Sirius said. </p>
<p>The man smiled as he walked over and sat down beside Harry. His three companions joined the group at the table as well. “Ah.. Sirius who are these guys?” Harry asked his godfather.</p>
<p>“The man… well I use that term loosely is Loki and the other three are..” Sirius said looking at Loki.</p>
<p>“You know how I told you that I ran away from my family as well. These are my older brothers. My real brothers.” Loki said.</p>
<p>“Does that mean you're going to tell us who you really are now?” Remus asked.</p>
<p>“Hmmm… Gabriel. The name is Gabriel. And these are Michael. Lucifer. And Raphael.” Gabriel said softly.</p>
<p>“Archangels. Your archangels.” Hermione exclaimed.</p>
