    <p>"McClain, Lance." The boy's eyes snapped up at the mention of his name. He straightened up, his heart beating loudly in his ears and began walking up towards the stool. He looked to his family, smiling encouragingly at him, all dressed with red and gold.</p><p>Lance smiled as he sat confidently, he knew where he would go. The next thing he saw was the inside of the hat. <br/>
<em>Huh, another McClain.</em> The boy nearly jumped off his seat when he heard the voice.<em> I thought I'd seen the last of you for the generation.</em> A confused "what?" Escaped his mouth before he could stop it. <em>Interesting, complicated as well, brave, witty as they come, keen to learn. That sounded wrong, but Lance didn't comment.

"A McClain, in Ravenclaw?" "That can't be right."</p>
