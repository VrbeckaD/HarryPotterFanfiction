    <p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>The wards alerted Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts that the visitors had arrived. It was going against everything he stood for, everything he had worked for, to hold this meeting. But the remains of the ministry and the interim minister if magic, Amelia Bones, had decided that the outbreak of the illness and the coming back of dead people were a good point in time to make peace with Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters.</p>
<p>Dumbledore was sitting there, appearing calm on the surface, but those who knew him could see him practically foaming at the mouth and gnashing his teeth. He was furious. All his carefully planned steps, all the sacrifices he wanted others to make for him and the greater good… Everything would be for naught if the peace treaty came.</p>
<p>Severus Snape, potions master and professor, head of Slytherin felt smug just looking at the headmaster. The old man finally had it coming. Snape was satisfied, that finally all would come to light. Every little thing he had helped Dumbledore hide had been documented and hidden. Every “accidental” death, every bribery, everything stolen or liberated from the dead wizards, witches, muggleborn or squibs. Severus just regretted that it had taken so long, that it had taken the end of the world for the ministry to listen… Severus was one of the few that seemed to be immune against the virus turning dead people into walkers. When Poppy Pomfrey had checked everyone remaining in the castle and everyone coming and seeking shelter, they had been surprised. Those with creature blood seemed to be incapable of becoming infected. </p>
<p>When the first refugee turned and almost succeeded in biting others it was discovered that the only magic that worked efficiently was fire. Everything else the walkers just shrugged off, the hunger too big and the brain too dead to register pain of any kind. </p>
<p>No one knew from where the virus came from. The correspondence with the outside world, muggle or magical, stopped when more and more herds were discovered. The muggles went down first, the government helpless against the panic and without wards they didn’t have any changes. Dumbledore had decided against helping others and had closed down the school. Protecting the future generation, as he had said. When the ministry had come seeking help, they had been overrun by panicked people, some died in the commotion and had started turning, and Dumbledore didn’t want to let them in. Keeping the wards up and ignoring the minister when she ordered him to let them in. Just when some walkers heard them and came seeking food the wards flickered shortly and let them in. </p>
<p>Dumbledore was still fuming when he was not able to discover why or how the wards had let them in. HE was the headmaster and the only one in control of the wards. Someone within the school was working against him. </p>
<p>When the ministry finally came into the great hall it was discovered that Percy Weasley had been bitten and Dumbledore had ordered him to be put out of his misery. Smirking inwardly as he finally had a reason to kill off the ignorant prat. It was a great surprise when Poppy checked him and found no virus, no infection at all. The wound was bad, but that was all it was a flesh wound, healed over quickly by potions and all that remained was a scar on his upper arms.</p>
<p>Molly Weasley and her two youngest children, Ronald and Ginevra, had almost been glad to see the prat die. He had turned his back on their family and left them to fend for themselves when he should have send money home for them to buy things, like better clothes or Quidditch equipment! But he had not done so. Molly had been furious that he was keeping all his earned money to himself. When Percy had come over, the last time they had seen him a few month prior to the outbreak, and she had demanded he gave over everything and that he moved back in to give them even more money and to not waste it on his own flat, the twins had protected their brother and had gotten him out of the Burrow. Arthur Weasley had stood by, not understanding what was happening and why. He loved his family, loved his sons, but why were they fighting and not listening to their mother? Why was this happening at all? A speck within him cried out, watching his son leave. His soul divided by sorrow at not being able to keep the family together. His very being crying out for something that just was not there…</p>
<p>Arthur had rejoiced at Percy being there, he had felt the crack in his heart when he had seen the wound. When he thought Percy would die for sure. A part of himself felt like joining him, just leaving it all behind. Fred and George were closer to Percy than ever. Keeping him within arm length and watching over him. They had always tried to include him in their lives, included him in their pranks, not exactly voluntary, and when that failed they tried to argue with him just to know that he cared for them as much as they cared for him. Bill and Charlie had fled the country as soon as they good after coming of age. They were always in contact and after Sirius Black had provided them with two-way-mirrors the contact became even more frequent. All of them had been worried about Percy. He was more withdrawn and paler than ever. </p>
<p>Bill Weasley had taken up a post at the Gringotts office in Diagon Alley. His fiancé, Fleur Delacour, had joined him after finishing school and had started a very successful designer shop in London, branching out into the muggle and magical world. Bill had wanted to be near his brothers and father, but he avoided his mother and the two youngest siblings. The deception he had discovered had been mind-blowing. When he came to visit the Borrow he had heard things that changed his view on his whole life.</p>
<p>~~~~~~Flashback~~~~~~<br/>Standing in front of the door Bill raised his hand to knock when suddenly there was a scream heard from within.</p>
<p>“NOOOOOO!!!!! Leave me alone! Where are they?! Why are the not here? What have you done!!!?” Bill was shocked to hear his father that desperate. He had never heard him talk like that. Usually he was quiet and controlled, at times meek. But what kept him rooted to the spot was the voice answering.</p>
<p>“Arthur, calm down! You have to drink the potion and everything will be good again. You will forget those feeling again and love me and Ron and Ginny again!”</p>
<p>Not being able to keep out of it Bill opened the door after using the strongest concealment charm known at Gringotts. Seeing Dumbledore sitting at the table and drinking tea while watching Ron and Ginny holding onto their father’s arms and his mother standing in front of him with a potions vial in her hand Bill’s grip on his wand tightened. </p>
<p>“You know that we cannot let you go, Arthur.” Dumbledore admonished the struggling man. “After all the work I went through to make everyone forget about dynamics and the mass potions suppressing those damned urges, you really think I will let your two alphas destroy all my plans?”</p>
<p>Arthur’s struggles became even more desperate “Where are they? What have you done to them?” Tears started filling his eyes… Why were they doing this?</p>
<p>“As I told you before, they are safely confined and will stay that way. As long as you do what I say, Arthur. Just stop your sniffling and take the potion!” Dumbledore was quickly losing his calm, seeing the omega sniffle before him made him angry at the dynamic system once again. Just because HE had been overlooked as he was neither dynamic! Those knot headed alphas, the sniffling omegas and the worthless betas… He would make everything right in the world, just like HE wanted it and deserved!</p>
<p>Seeing the uselessness of his struggling Arthur fell quiet. Was he doing the right thing? Submitting to someone not his alphas? Condemning his sons, the whole magical world to this deception just to save two people? Unable to take the thought any longer he nodded and was quickly brought back under control by the love potion and obedience potion administered by Molly. </p>
<p>Ron and Ginny huffed in the sudden silence. “It’s getting worse, every time. Can’t we just kill him off and take over the family?” Ron asked.</p>
<p>Shaking his head in exasperation Dumbledore looked at the siblings “As I have told you all these years we will have to kill of all your brothers before you would be able to become the Lord of the house.”</p>
<p>“You could just keep your word and make me Lady Potter! That way we could get to his money and then kill Potter!” Ginny gloated at getting one over Ron. </p>
<p>“He is my best friend! He will give me money whenever I ask him to! And ‘Miona will make sure he doesn’t even remember it!” Ron whined </p>
<p>Fed up with their whining Dumbledore stood up “Enough! I will not listen to this anymore. Ginny, I told you he first has to defeat Tom, then you will be able to give him the love potion. Meanwhile I will make sure Black is killed off, that way he will have no one at all to rely on other than his loyal friends and you. The contract is already written up and ready for signing, I just have to get the damn werewolf out of the house and use the imperious curse on Black…” Maybe he could even sneak in a bit pleasure on his part… A willing, more or less at least, omega would be really sweet, until he would have to get him killed that is. Dumbledore smirked making the three Weasleys shudder in sudden fright. The headmaster was creepy when he did that, looking so evil and demented.</p>
<p>Bill couldn’t believe it! They were insane, all three of them! And his father was a prisoner, kept quiet with potions and blackmail… What about his other brothers? Charlie? Percy? Fred? George? They didn’t seem to be part of this deception. Poor Harry… And what was this about dynamics? Alphas and Omegas? </p>
<p>Something within Bill was screaming in realization. Fighting against a potion administered at Hogwarts the very first day. Given to everyone since Dumbledore had come to Hogwarts as a Professor. </p>
<p>Shaking his head Bill knew what he had to do. Turning around in silent apology to his father, Bill Weasley left the house. Planning the future steps to bring down those harming his family.</p>
