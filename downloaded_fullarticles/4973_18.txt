Snape awarded him only with a sidelong glance as he passed by the boy. Wasn't he aware of the time?</p><p>His next class -- in fact, the class that Snape held -- was about to start, but Malfoy didn't make a move. Snape only grunted to himself, continuing to move forward.</p><p>As he walked with quick steps to the center of the room, he did his usual: stared at every student so menacingly that they had to look away sooner or later. Malfoy, however, always put up with good competition, but no such thing at the moment, since the one mentioned wasn't present. He couldn't believe how this matter affected him as much as it did. He did enjoy Malfoy's personality, the limitless supply the boy seemed to have of smart remarks never failed to make Snape's mouth quirk upwards, but in the end he was just a spoiled brat at the best of times. Why did he care that he looked troubled? Not to mention missing Potions. Before he could stop the thought, he felt his lips move on their own.  </p><p>"Oh, you'll pay."</p><p>Longbottom looked up from where he was sitting. "Sir?"</p><p>Snape let his black, piercing eyes do the talking and watched Longbottom’s trembling lips as his face returned to his Potions book.</p><p>"You're reading the wrong page, Longbottom.” The disdain was as clear as ever and the boy answered his usual. </p><p>"Sorry, sir, my mistake." </p><p>"As always," Snape said, with a wave of his wand the book closed shut and opened again to the correct page with such force that it made Longbbottoms hair flutter. Snape sighed and turned on his heel.</p><p>**</p><p>Malfoy's usual minions got waved away. That was when Snape understood that something must have been bothering him. Sure, he had waved them off many times before, but not like this. </p><p>Snape frowned and made his way towards that white-blond hair, standing just close enough to be sure that Malfoy would be able to see his shoes. He cleared his throat since Malfoy didn't seem to notice his presence.</p><p>"Oh, bloody hell, Crabbe, wh--" Draco silenced as he looked up at his Head of House. </p><p>He studied the boy more closely as he looked up at him.<br/>
He had dark rings under his eyes. Lack of sleep, obviously, but there was something else; the expression on his face didn't belong there. Snape couldn't help but notice that Malfoy's bad habit had returned: his lower lip was pushed out in a pout just like a four-year-old's.<br/>
"You, come with me."</p><p>Those were the words that made him rise to his feet.</p><p>Snape led the way towards his quarters. Once inside, he locked the room and muttered a silencing spell.</p><p>His black eyes locked with deep, slightly angry, grey ones.</p><p>"So, Mister Malfoy, why are you sulking?"</p><p>"Just..."</p><p>"Yesssss?" He knew that drawing out the ‘s’ always seemed to make the boy shiver slightly. This time was no different.</p><p>"Are you actually asking me how I'm doing, Professor?"</p><p>Snape looked like he had been kicked hard, and made an involuntary twitch with his mouth.</p><p>"No, I’m just asking you why you are giving me hell these days." </p><p>Instead of irritating his professor any more but answering back, he settled on looking slightly surprised. "I do what?"</p><p>"A garden gnome couldn't have stolen my Polyjuice Potion, transforming itself into you, now could it?"</p><p>"Professor?" A smile played at the boy’s lips.</p><p>"I'm not joking. Unless a garden gnome did exactly that, would you mind explaining to me why your latest exams looked so atrocious? All these years, I corrected each and every one of them, not one looking like they do now."</p><p>"I...Um..."</p><p>Snape arched one eyebrow at his otherwise cocky student.</p><p>"Are you, in fact, speechless, Mr. Malfoy?"</p><p>"I haven't been sleeping well."</p><p>"And why is that?"</p><p>"Like you care!" He spat and fixed his gaze upon his professor defiantly.</p><p>"Oh, I do care, never doubt that. Your grades are dropping almost as low as Potter’s."</p><p>"Are you comparing Potter's intelligence with a garden gnome's?"</p><p>"That is not important," he said in a harsher voice than he meant to.<br/>
He made sure to soften his voice before speaking again, though he didn't know why he bothered in the first place, "Why aren't you sleeping well? Maybe I can help?" Snape frowned when he saw the boy struggle, but lost the battle and a mocking laugh escaped his lips. "Do not laugh at me, Mr. Malfoy."</p><p>"I'm sorry! Just the whole thing with garden gnomes and Potter, polyjuicepotion...Hilarious really." Once he noticed Snape wasn't as amused he took a few deep breaths to calm himself down. "I have trouble sleeping because of nightmares... okay?"</p><p>Snape arched his eyebrow again, thinking that the face might make Malfoy speak, but as he feared, the words needed to be drawn out.</p><p>"Well? Nightmares about what?"</p><p>"I'd rather not..."</p><p>"I can force you, you know. If not by myself, I know plenty of spells that might be useful."  </p><p>The Malfoy smirk was in its correct place as he said, "Oh, you wouldn't."  </p><p>"No?" He moved closer to the boy.</p><p>"No. Because my father--" the boy silenced on his own, so used to having his father there for him. Now that he wasn't, things weren’t going quite as well for Draco as they once did.</p><p>Playing on this matter, hoping to get the boy angry so that he would spit out his nightmares, Snape fought the urge to smile sneakily when he continued, "--Is in Azkaban, yes, I know."</p><p>"Don't... I don't want to talk about this, please just..."</p><p>Before he could finish,  Snape flicked his wand towards the cabinet in the corner of his office which held the test of each of his students. It made an unmistakable rattle and Draco knew instantly what it was and it made him reluctantly move closer to Snape. </p><p>Boggarts... He took a few steps back. He never got the chance to see who or what his boggart was that time in class because of Potter's desperate need to be a drama queen.<br/>
The stupid fool took that boring class to an abrupt end just as it started to get interesting.</p><p>Silently, he had thanked Potter, really, for being the idiot that he was. He didn't want to display his fears to the others. Many things scared him, among those being squirrels, and he just couldn't live with himself if a squirrel jumped out as his boggart. He would be ridiculed, just like he ridiculed others if that one ever got out. So he didn't find out thanks to Potter, and he didn't want to find out now, either. He had a feeling his professor's sarcastic nature would have a blast if the boggart took the shape of a tiny squirrel. Taking in the look on Snape's face however, Draco knew that he didn't have a chance getting out of here before his professor made his point.</p><p>His thoughts were interrupted by Snape's dry voice, "You know what this is, no?"</p><p>Draco sighed and nodded. </p><p>"Place yourself in front of me."</p><p>"I don't want to!" The childish tone of voice matched with his innocent face, but Snape knew better. Now annoyed beyond belief, he grabbed Draco's collar, pulling him close and placing him harshly next to himself.</p><p>"Puppy dog eyes won't work on me. Your mother might melt for the trick, but not me, so stop what you're trying to do. You're wasting your time, and mine."</p><p>"But...I don't...I'm not..."</p><p>"You're sounding like a child, stop this instant!"</p><p>"But..." He bit his lip hard. </p><p>Snape frowned at the sight of a scared Draco. He didn't look the way Snape had pictured him looking scared. The thought had thrilled him to no end in his daydreams whenever Draco had been particularly disrespectful although that rarely happened towards Snape, there had been times when the boy had lashed out at him. After those times he wouldn't mind having Draco as scared of him as Neville Longbottom was. </p><p>But this sight wasn't enjoyable at all. He sighed for letting the boy get under his skin, annoyed with himself for the first time in this conversation. He cleared his throat. "What's the problem, Mr. Malfoy? Obviously something is bothering you."</p><p>"It shows my boggart...What do you expect? Laughter?"</p><p>"Don't be scared, it can't hurt you, even if it could, I'm here. Now, let's begin." Without waiting for a reply, the doors flew open and a furious hooded figure turned up. Snape knew who this was even before the hood revealed its face: Lucius Malfoy. Snape knew that Lucius could be intimidating, sometimes vicious and very unpredictable, but Snape was truly surprised when he resulted in Lucius’ only son’s greatest fears. Draco inhaled sharply after inspecting the body up and down, clearly expecting his boggart to be something smaller than this. Taking a few stumbling steps back, his eyes fixed themselves on that oh-so familiar face.</p><p>"Father...I didn't..."</p><p>"The spell, Mr. Malfoy, out with it!" he barked like an order.</p><p>"I...I don't remember..." The tremor in his voice spoke for itself: he was terrified.</p><p>"Get a hold of yourself, boy! Just mock him, picture him looking ridiculous!" He pronounced the magic word on purpose to help him. He just wanted to find out why Draco was so scared of his own father.</p><p>"Riddikulus!" he screamed from the top of his lungs, pointing his wand towards his father. The almost royal-looking Lucius turned into a 50 year older version of himself, hunched back, using his infamous cane as support and wasn't at all intimidating. </p><p>Snape tried to block the smile that was close to being displayed on his lips before saying, "Well, well...look at good old Lucius, you'll always have that on him" he added as Draco tried to say something, but got cut off. "Now, talk." Snape used his 'don't argue with me, just do as I say' voice, which ended up with Draco shrugging while staring at him.</p><p>"Well, I don't know why..."</p><p>"People don't make excuses for one’s fears, Mr. Malfoy."</p><p>"I wasn't, I just didn't realize that he was my boggart, that's all!" It was spoken softly as he looked at Snape at the same time he twisted his hands nervously.</p><p>"Since when?"</p><p>"Things got worse once the Dark Lord returned after the triwizard..."</p><p>"What things?"</p><p>"Instead of being just mean about my grades and his expectations of me being a Malfoy and all... He became more physical."</p><p>"Is he beating you?" Snape failed to hide his surprise at this thought, but frowned when Draco almost whined.</p><p>“No, he’s just being an arse. He scares me a lot at home.”</p><p>"And what happens when he does? Merlin, do I have to drag out every word from you? Words that I obviously want to hear?"</p><p>"He's...um..." Draco's eyes suddenly avoided Snape’s.</p><p>"Well?" His patience almost shattering, he took a firm grip of Draco’s chin, tilting his face up. Apparently once he figured that he had no place to run and hide unless he wanted to fall victim to one of Snape’s spells, he sighed deeply, defeated.</p><p>"He's touching me, damn it! My own father! You happy?!" he spat. The angry tone didn't go well together with his now sad and confused grey eyes. "All right? Stop this."</p><p>Snape loosened his grip, trying to take in what the boy had just said.</p><p>"Not sure I wanted to hear that."</p><p>"You fucking asked!" Draco's voice had turned from an almost worrying calm to a high-pitched yell. Snape thanked the silencing spells he had cast on the room.</p><p>"Language, Mr. Malfoy," Snape said, almost with disdain. The word 'fucking' didn’t match the boy’s beautiful face. Snape opened one of his many books. Even though he found what he was searching for, he didn't speak for a few minutes, making the boy nervous and jumpy.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"Silence!" The voice once again was harsher than he meant. "Just be silent, I'm reading." He looked up at his student that was looking just on the verge on saying sorry.<br/>
Snape shook his head at this, and Draco's lips went into a thin line out of pure self-control. Snape noticed the stamping of Draco's foot, but he didn't have the heart to tell him to stop that too, since his very body-language was so far off from what he was used to seeing from the boy. "Ah, here it is. Your father is preparing you for your first meeting with the Dark Lord."</p><p>"What you're telling me is just nonsense!" His voice unsteady with disappointment as he continued, "I've met the Dark Lord!"</p><p>"Yes, but you were too occupied thinking about your father’s advice on what to say to the Dark Lord that you didn't study his face as closely as I did. Once he removed your hood, he hissed like a snake, did he not?"</p><p>"Um, I guess he did. I'm not sure."</p><p>"Oh, don't lie, I saw you get all tense, and for a moment you lost your concentration." He looked at the boy whose facial expression was twisted with impatience. "Him speaking in parseltongue is never a good sign. He's saying something he doesn't want anybody to know, not even the people he trusts most.  What was obvious though was that he liked what he saw, Draco.'</p><p>The boy inhaled sharply at the sound of his given name used for the first time in this uncomfortable conversation with the Potions master more than at what the words implied.</p><p>'After that, he licked his lips slowly. That is even worse. You should consider yourself lucky he didn't do anything right on the spot." </p><p>Draco frowned, cleaarly confused and when he spoke next his voice nearly broke with panic. "What's any of this got to do with my father?"</p><p>"Think, Mr. Malfoy, or my statement about your latest test being taken by a garden gnome would fit once again."</p><p>"How dare you?" </p><p>Snape watched as the boy’s pale cheeks turned red, and for a brief moment of lack of self-control, he found it cute.</p><p>"Dare what, Mr. Malfoy?" Snape said instead, toning down his words with a tired undertone that he sometimes used on whichever student had angered him at the moment.</p><p>"Insult and mock me while I'm in this...state?" He had lowered his voice a bit.</p><p>"Well, I know you're obviously not very happy about this situation, but it needs to be done, I assure you that. Let me tell you about the rule. I don't know why you haven't been informed about this, but for you to become a Death Eater at a very young age, your virginity needs to be sacrificed."</p><p>Draco's eyes went wide with shock. "What...I...How could he know that? What if I wasn't?"</p><p>Snape awarded him with pinching the bridge of his nose as he spoke, "Are you?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>"Well, to answer your question-- though it's not a good answer -- he just knows." Draco grimaced and looked away as he thought that Snape was mocking him somehow. Clearing his throat, however, made Draco turn his full focus on Snape again. "Even if he couldn't, he would want to confirm it himself. Or let somebody who's reliable do it."</p><p>Kicking the end of the table with one foot, the pout returned.</p><p>"I still don't get what that has anything to do with my fa--"</p><p>"-- Be quiet! Let me explain. Since you’re as young as you are, the Dark Lord wants no innocent children in his army. Your innocence is only removed when your virginity is."</p><p>Draco was silent for almost five minutes, taking in what had just been said, Snape studying his face closely all the while. </p><p>"Why...Um..." Draco’s blush deepened.</p><p>"Yes?" Snape asked, the word dripping with impatience. He just wasn't used to a stuttering Draco, a Draco who was barely able to form complete sentences. Though in his heart, he knew that the boy had a right to be upset.</p><p>"Why can't anybody else..."</p><p>"There were a few who volunteered, I assure you."</p><p>"Really? Who might that be?"</p><p>"You mean 'which ones'?"</p><p>"Yes! I got you the first time, there were a few, I'm not deaf!"</p><p>"Don't take that tone with me again. Well, Greyback was very eager, growling at you, but you were probably too involved in an inner dialogue, as involved then as you are now, that you didn't hear him." Snape frowned, sighed and gripped Draco's chin, making the boy focus. "You're not listening to me.”</p><p>"Well, excuse me! It’s a lot to take in!"</p><p>"As I was saying, Greyback growled in your direction." Draco shuddered and formed his mouth into a rather disgusted 'o'. And of course the Dark Lord himself, but many of them were holding back since your father was there. Lucius was very angry at the whole situation. He was clenching his fists all the way through. Once you left he said in front of everybody that you will not be touched by anyone else but him."</p><p>Draco grimaced but said nothing.</p><p>Snape gave him a few seconds to process before speaking again, trying in vain to choose his words carefully. "He didn't want the others to hurt you, as I'm sure they would do great damage." Of course he knew straight away this approach was wrong as Draco's eyes reduced to angry slits.</p><p>"Getting this from my father isn't damaging, you say?' He took a deep breath before looking up defiantly at Snape and added: 'I'd rather have the Dark Lord, thank you!"</p><p>"Foolish boy, you don't know what you're saying."</p><p>"Oh, I know perfectly well what I'm saying, Sev." Now it was Draco's turn to study Snape's face, he did it with increasing curiosity too since his professor looked at him like he had greatly insulted him. Although his black eyes showed no emotion, Draco knew that he was angry, he could tell from the older man's twitchy body language.</p><p>"Sev?" Snape said, almost disgusted.</p><p>Despite the seriousness of what they were discussing, or maybe because of it, he found himself fighting the urge to smile nervously as he continued: "Yes, that's short for Severus." Draco said matter-of-factly. </p><p>Snape couldn't help himself thinking that his name sounded very sweet coming from those lips, in that voice. Instead of encouraging the boy, he spat, "I know, Mr. Malfoy! But it's Professor to you. Only a few are allowed to call me by my first name, and lesser than that I let shorten it down to Sev, for that matter." </p><p>Draco snickered and straightened his tie that had been a little curled up after Snape grabbed him earlier. Practically tearing his gaze from the boy’s small hands, he snapped, "What's so funny?" When Draco didn't answer, he pinned the suddenly frightened boy to the nearest wall.</p><p>"There is not much left of my patience, Mr. Malfoy. I thought that I might inform you of that if I do something stupid."</p><p>"Let me go!" Almost squirming out of his grip, Snape just took a firmer one around those wrists, waiting until Draco gave up his stubborn attempts.</p><p>"You don't want the Dark Lord taking your virginity, Draco. Trust me. You should feel the same contempt as you would feel if Greyback claimed you."</p><p>Draco blinked a few times, calming himself down, his lips trembling slightly as he brought himself to speak to his professor who had an almost bruising grip around his wrists. He swallowed the whimper that was threateningly close to leaving his lips. "Well, I don't, I just don't want it to be my father! He doesn't seem to notice that he completely destroys what little we have together by doing this to me! Can't you..." He took deep, harsh breaths before adding the powerful sentence, "Can't you do it?"<br/>
He felt himself blush even deeper, hating himself for it. He tried to search his professor’s face for any emotion whatsoever, but failed.</p>
