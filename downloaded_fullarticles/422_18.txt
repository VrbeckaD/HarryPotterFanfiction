  <em>Cold.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>There is nothing else on our minds. Just freezing<em>, fucking</em> <em>deadly</em> cold. You loose your sense for the whole when constantly fighting for your life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>We are ten, maybe twenty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Soldiers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Stuck somewhere in the middle of the unyielding <em>bloody</em> Russian winter. For weeks now.</p><p> </p><p>All hope is lost. None of us cares for the war anymore or even something as insignificant as victory. What matters is surviving. Some of us even don’t care about that anymore. You can hear them at night. Wimper. Welcoming dead. They believe it is easing to just give up. But I can’t. I have to fight. For <em>her</em>.<em> For them</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Dates lost their meaning long ago. What even is a day of the week or another if you can die any moment? Nothing. Abso-<em>fucking</em>-lutely! Today though is special. I can feel it. Probably Christmas Eve. I’m not sure anymore.</p><p> </p><p>I don’t know where I am. I hide in a hutch somewhere in this never-ending forest. Alone. I lost my mates a couple of days ago. There were only four of us anymore anyways.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I’m cold. Or maybe not. I don’t feel it anymore. I feel nothing. Absolutely nothing. I could as well be dead. From the outside. But inside of me, there is this burning fire. Hot. Roaring. <em>Her</em> fire. <em>Theirs</em>. It throbs inside of me. Relentless. I have to fight.</p><p> </p><p>I think of her. Her fierce behavior. That she always needs to be right. I need to get back to her. I can’t allow that her worries have been right. I want to watch my daughter grow, see my son again. Who’s hero I always have been. I am.</p><p> </p><p>My fingers shake when I reach for the picture inside of my pocket. The one somebody snapped before I left. She’s smiling up at me. There is all this love, I still can’t believe I deserve. My heart aches and maybe, just maybe a tear slips from my eye. But I don’t feel it anymore.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>And as one of the bravest is also lost to death, welcomes the release, people huddle for warmth at home. There are roaring fires and they sing, „Silent night, holy night…“ All hope in those few words. Hope that’s long ago lost.</em></p></div>
