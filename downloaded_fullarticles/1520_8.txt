  <u> <strong>CHAPTER 1:Â Forspent</strong> </u>
</p><p>
  <em>July 1998</em>
</p><p>"Both of us?"</p><p>"Yes, why not?"</p><p>Harry had just asked Andromeda to move across the world with him. Far away from England. Far away from the haunting memories of dead friends and family.</p><p>"This is a big decision. I don't know what to say."</p><p>"Can you promise to think about it? Really think about it? Please Andy?"</p><p>"Of course Harry. But what will you do if I say no? Take them with you?"</p><p>"No," he rushed out, "I would never do that to you. Teddy and Mara are your family too. If you stay, we all stay."</p><p>"Thank you. You're a good man. I'll think about."</p><p>Harry nodded and turned his attention to the sleeping babies in his arms. Poor little orphans, just like him.</p><p>It had been a very long six weeks since the Battle of Hogwarts. So many were dead. So many more alive, yet broken. He was somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Although he never gave up hope, he had been fighting for survival for years, he was not always sure that he would make it out alive. Not against Voldemort. Harry wanted to beat him of course, but he also thought it was somehow disrespectful to his parents if he believed - truly believed- that he could succeed where they didn't. They had more knowledge and experience than he did. Who was he to think he could do better? At the same time, he would fail their memory if he didn't try his damndest.</p><p>Then there was the damn prophecy. It meant that he could, maybe, possibly, succeed. Dumbledore told him that the power he had, that the Dark Lord knew not, was love. Love. Harry did admire and respect Dumbledore, but the man was mad. Absolutely barking. Love. Harry eventually discovered what the real power actually was. And it wasn't love.</p><p>Being locked up in his room the summer after Sirius died left him with little to do but think. He thought. He also cried until no more tears came. He raged and it filled him with purpose. He discovered. He thought some more. Then, six weeks ago he faced it all. He walked towards death in peace, but it was fleeting. He lost one purpose, to gain another.</p><p>Love was never the power. How many mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, strangers, laid their life down for another in vain. Harry was not selfish enough to think that his mother loved him more than any other mother would love her child. He also couldn't desecrate the sacrifice of all those who died fighting for what was right, standing up for those weaker, dying because there was no other choice. He had no choice either. Love was not enough. Love is partial. Love is particular. No, love was not his weapon.</p><p>There was, and still is, something greater than love and Harry found it. He found it while cursing his fate, his relatives, the entire Wizarding World during that depressing, lonely summer. He experienced it while searching for the Horcruxes. He faced it when he watched the life leave Snape's eyes. He held it. And he kept it hidden.</p><p>For now, Harry would put those thoughts aside. He had babies to take care of. Granted, he didn't know much about caring for one but with Andy's help and the instinct to do the opposite of what was done to him growing up, he figured the kids would turn out just fine. Yes, that seemed like a good plan.</p><p>-HPHPHPHPHPHPHP-</p><p>"What do you mean you're leaving?" shouted a startled Hermione.</p><p>"You're joking, right mate?" asked a more surprisingly subdued Ron.</p><p>"This is no joke. Andy and I are leaving the country. We're off in a couple of hours, in fact. I wanted to tell you both in person."</p><p>"Why? Where are you going? What about your education?" asked Hermione.</p><p>"There is nothing left for me here." Harry held up his hand to cut off whatever she was going to say. "I know you guys are here, but you both have your own lives. The last seven years have brought only one crisis after another. I'm tired. Tired of the stares, the whispers, the demands, the drama."</p><p>"Why didn't you tell us sooner? You're leaving today! And you're just telling us now. I thought we meant more to you than that," accused a teary Hermione. Ron nodded in agreement.</p><p>Harry sighed. "It wouldn't have mattered when I told you. It wouldn't change that I'm still going and you're staying."</p><p>"After everything we've been through, you're just leaving?" Ron's anger finally showed itself.</p><p>"Look, this isn't about you, neither of you." He was being harsh but he had to be. "This is about me. You both have your family here. You have each other. What do I have left? Nothing. Nothing but painful memories. I can't move forward otherwise. I need to do this. I am doing this. With or without your unasked for approval." His tone was fierce.</p><p>"How can you talk about leaving us?" Hermione's waterworks was full-on now.</p><p>"Hermy, you don't need me. Never have. You're with Ron, and the Ministry found your parents. You'll be fine. Please understand. This is what I want. This is what I am doing. For the first time in my entire goddamn life I am being selfish. I earned the right to be selfish," He said more gently as he hugged her. She sobbed into his chest. Tears soaking into his shirt.</p><p>"We'll miss you. What if we never see each other again?" she asked, her voice muffled.</p><p>"For how bright you are, you sure are daft at times," he laughed. "You forget you're a witch! We have owls, floo, portkeys, mirrors. We'll keep in touch. Plus, I'll have to pop back once in a while for a proper cuppa. It's a known fact that only Brits know how to make a proper brew." That got her to chuckle.</p><p>Harry spent another twenty minutes reassuring both of them. He loved Hermione and Ron, he really did, but he was relieved when they left. He finally showed them out after promises to look after himself and to write. He gave them letters for Mr and Mrs Weasley, McGonagall, Hagrid, George, Ginny, Neville and Luna. Telling them all goodbye, thanking them for all they had done for him, for showing their unwavering faith through the years, for being worth fighting for.</p><p>He did a final walk through of Twelve Grimmauld Place and said his final goodbye to the house. It was all he had of Sirius and for that he would miss it.</p><p>"Kreacher," he called out.</p><p>"Master called," answered the house elf once he popped into the room.</p><p>"Please seal the house and then meet me outside." Kreacher bowed and popped off again. Harry walked out the front door. It was time to leave.</p><p>The house had become a haven for him and Mara. He had returned to it a couple of days after the final battle since he had nowhere else to go besides the Burrow. He did not want to intrude on the mourning Weasley's. So he went back to the dark and gloomy house to find it clean. At first he thought he was in the wrong place but then Kreacher appeared and explained that he had done the overhaul. Harry just accepted the changes and in a show of his appreciation he gave Kreacher the Slytherin locket in honor of Regulus' sacrifice.</p><p>They both knew why Kreacher was suddenly more helpful but neither spoke of it. Harry accepted Kreacher as his house-elf and laid down several ground rules. Kreacher didn't even say a bad word to him. Nor about Andy or Teddy when Harry moved them in. He wasn't exactly warm towards them but he followed orders without grumbling complaints. A vast improvement if there ever was one. Harry was sure that wherever Sirius was, he was either laughing or jealous at the change.</p><p>Harry waited on the front steps for Kreacher to finish sealing the house. Elf magic was strong and constantly ignored by Wizards. The house would be impenetrable once Kreacher was done and everything in it preserved. No one would be able to get in while they were away and if someone did try, Harry and Kreacher would know instantly. He looked at the once dilapidated house with a bit of fondness. His musings were interrupted by a pop.</p><p>"It is done, Master," spoke Kreacher.</p><p>"Thank you again. You are sure you will be okay with me apparating you all the way there?"</p><p>"Master is a strong wizard. Kreacher will be fine."</p><p>Harry nodded and held out his hand. Kreacher took it and they disapparated without a sound.</p><p>-HPHPHPHPHPHPHP-</p><p>"Harry?" called out a surprised Andy from somewhere in the house.</p><p>He and Kreacher had just apparated into the receiving room of their new house. The wards were set to alert Andy and himself of anyone's arrival.</p><p>"Yes, it's us," replied Harry. He looked down at Kreacher who was still holding his hand. "No missing pieces?" he joked.</p><p>"Kreacher is whole," replied the elf quite seriously.</p><p>"Good. Well, you can get settled then." The elf nodded and popped away. Harry opened the door to the room and on the other side found a smiling Andy.</p><p>"You're early. I wasn't expecting you for at least another hour," she said.</p><p>"I know. I was able to get rid of them rather quickly. They were probably still in shock. Didn't even notice I didn't answer any of their questions about where we were going. We left as soon as they did."</p><p>"Well, don't just stand there. I want to show you what Winky and I have been up to."</p><p>Harry followed Andy around the house taking in the changes she had made in the last week. The new furniture had arrived and it was looking like a proper home. The house was quite large for six of them but Andy had loved it on sight. Harry wanted to make her happy so he bought it without question. Thanks to the ridiculous exchange rate between Galleons to Pounds they could afford the large house easily even after paying for all the damage done to Gringotts while getting Hufflepuff's Cup.</p><p>Gringotts. Meeting with the Head Goblin had been awkward to say the least. He felt really bad about the break in, and out, but it had been necessary to win the war. Once Andy had agreed to leave England they decided on crossing the Atlantic. America had a more spread out community. It would be easier for them to start over. They of course needed money, which was a problem as the goblins were still very angry at what a wizard had done to their bank.</p><p>Harry had to explain to Andy about his part in it. Which then turned into telling her about the gist of the hunt for horcruxes. He avoided telling her anything in detail. Just that when Dumbledore died he was left with the task to destroy Voldemort's soul-anchors so he could finally be killed. He didn't tell her about going hungry while on the run, the loneliness, the fights, the fear, and then the absolute bone chilling dread that he himself was one. No, he kept it all to himself. It was bad enough that Hermione and Ron knew that. No point in burdening anymore people with his memories when she was grieving the loss of her husband, daughter and son-in-law.</p><p>Harry decided to take full responsibility for the damages to Gringotts. It was the right thing to do anyway. With Andy's help he wrote a letter and sent off an owl to the Bank. The invitation to meet with the Head Goblin arrived rather quickly with a time set for the following day. When he arrived for the meeting he could feel the wary stares of every single goblin in the room. He had been promised a parlay so he wasn't worried that they would attack but he still didn't like their glares, pointy teeth, and even pointier swords.</p><p>He walked confidently to the first free teller he saw and was immediately taken through a large ornate gold plated door and down many guard lined corridors to the extremely opulent office of the Head of Gringotts, who turned out to also be the King of the Goblins.</p><p>Thankfully, Andy had not turned her back on her Pureblood rearing and had walked Harry through meeting the battle hardened leader of the Goblin Nation. Harry was prepared to be extremely respectful and bow but to not show weakness. What he wasn't prepared for was the surprised look on the Goblin King's face even before he bowed. The look was undeniable, though it lasted mere seconds, before the King schooled his face into a smile that was more grimace-like than anything else. Harry was surprised as well. He did not think that the King would recognize the changes in him. But he did. Both ignored it. Just like Kreacher and Winky did. After negotiating the cost of reparations with the King, Harry was able to meet with an estate goblin. That goblin did not react to him, aside from obvious wariness like the other goblins, and Harry was grateful.</p><p>After settling his accounts, creating a will just in case in which he left everything to Teddy, Mara and Andy, he was given a list of available and extremely secure properties abroad. It had taken about four hours from stepping into the bank to leaving and he was glad of the brevity of it as he was expecting to be there all day. Once he returned to Grimmauld Place, he had given the stack of property portfolios to Andy and told her to have fun. She was shocked and had refused at first. Telling him that it was his home and he should have a say. He didn't want to tell her that he didn't know where to start as he never had a place to call home. So he just told her that he trusted her to pick a place that would be suitable to raise the kids since she had experience with parenting. She hugged him, ignoring his tense response to being touched, and immersed herself in the selection process.</p><p>The house she finally selected had been the fifth or sixth in the stack, he couldn't quite remember. But her reaction was immediate, and that he did remember. He was reading to the babies, not caring that they were too young for it, when he heard an 'Oh' from Andy. He looked up to see her smiling wistfully at a photo. He knew without even looking at it that it was the one. He sent off an owl with instruction for immediate purchase and left no room to argue when Andy protested.</p><p>So now they lived in Seattle, Washington. Right on the water because, why not. It was less than a week from Andy agreeing to moving in which was extremely fast but appreciated. The faster they left England the better. The goblins were extremely helpful, for a fee of course. The house was purchased quickly and updated without fanfare. Unlike in Britain, where the Wizarding World was stuck in the middle ages, the Americans embraced electricity and all new technology. Harry was really excited about that the most. He was finally the owner of all the things he never was able to enjoy at the Dursleys; several television sets, DVD players, computers and the house was set up with telephone lines so the computer was connected to the internet, the best muggle invention to date, and to the high security surveillance system he had installed.</p><p>Andy had picked the house because it looked very much like the Italian villa she and Ted had spent their twentieth anniversary. A villa that they had hoped to retire to one day. The memory brought happy tears and in remembrance of that Harry bought it, no questions asked. The house was located on the low-bank waterfront of Lake Washington, a much coveted area. It was more of a mini estate than a house as it was gated and offered the utmost privacy. The main house was built in 1927, had a peaked roof and an elegant stucco facade. The first thing you notice on entrance is the awe inspiring archway. The house had six bedrooms, six bathrooms, a grand formal room for entertaining with an ornate firescape and large stained glass embellished windows with views of the lush green landscape of the Pacific Northwest towards the majestic Mount Rainier. It was a beautiful and peaceful location which hopefully would aid in their healing.</p><p>-END OF CHAPTER-</p>
