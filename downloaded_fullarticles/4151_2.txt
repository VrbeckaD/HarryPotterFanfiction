    <p>Amelia Novak smiled at all of her friends as she made her way into the great hall. She had missed Hogwarts, she had missed her father Misha too, but Hogwarts was home. Adrinette smiled as she walked through the doors. She took a deep breath and smelled the musty castle and felt the warmth that she had missed. She caught the sight of blonde hair and smirked hurrying over.</p><p>“Look at that mess on your head.” She said standing in front of the blonde before hugging her best friend. “Oh god I missed you Amelia, how was your summer? I tried to find you on the train, but Avery and Scott wanted to talk quidditch strategy.” Adrinette’s clear blue eyes searched Amelia’s chocolate brown eyes.</p><p>“Oh God! Adrinette! I’ve missed you so much! It was amazing! I played a ton of quidditch  with my uncles for my dad, anything to keep him from droning about work, or about how much he misses my mom. I spent quite a bit of time with my uncles, and its fine I sat with Cedric on the train.”</p><p>“Oh god, you got to sit with Cedric, I’d love to talk strategy with him if you know what I mean.” She nudged her friend laughing.</p><p>“As lovely as hearing you hens gabble, my brother and I would like to get to our table, and you both are blocking the way.”</p><p>Adrinette looked up and sighed seeing the Weasley twins. “Why don’t the both of you just, I don’t know, go around us?”</p><p>“Because you’re in …</p><p>…our way.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh look Adrin, they’re doing that freaky clone thing again.” Amelia smirked.</p><p>“Oooh, next are we going to have to guess which one is Sam and which one is Eric?” She snarked crossing her arms challenging them to make her move.</p><p>“You don’t want to do this Pearman.”</p><p>“What are you going to do Weasleys? Sicc peeves on us?” Amelia rolled her eyes and then to piss them off more she turned towards her friend.</p><p>“We did talk strategy on the train actually…”</p><p>If there was one thing a person shouldn’t do, it was to threaten Adrinette Pearman, she was the younger sister of an Auror and one brother who was a squib who used his life to join the British Military, the girl could handle herself well. “That sounded like a threat, Weasley, why don’t we settle this beater to beater on the field this weekend?” She then followed Amelia’s lead and returned to discussing the holiday.</p><p>“We find the word threatening so Malcontent.”</p><p>“We prefer menacing about.”</p><p>“Call it whatever you want morons, the fact is you’ve done it. I’d like to see you try to make us move. I don’t see why you couldn’t have sat on the other side of the table, but i guess instead of you both receiving a full brain you each received half.” Amelia bit back.</p><p>Adrinette snorted before sighing. “Come on, Ami, I am getting bored of this and clearly they aren’t leaving anytime soon, see you in the quad tomorrow after breakfast.” She hugged her friend once more before turning with a swish of her ponytail.</p><p>“Bye Adrin!” Amelia smiled before glaring at the Weasleys a little longer.</p><p>As the girls left George sighed and Fred hit him in the shoulder. “You keep treating her like you’re 5 and she will definitely stuff you in a broom closet and toss away the key.”</p><p>“Oi, you keep being threatened by a cupcake mate so shut it.”</p><p>Fred just shoved his brother playfully before heading to the Gryffindor table.</p><p>“Why do you guys look like you’ve swallowed a canary?” Harry asks</p><p>“Oh George here is thinking about swallowing something, isn’t that right ol’ Georgie.” Fred smirked at Harry.</p><p>“I was not! And I have not! What do you mean Fred! Stop self-projecting your thoughts onto me.” George said starting to fill his plate.</p><p>“He’s taken fancy to a certain quidditch player, if you know what I mean, Harry.”</p><p>The younger boy blushed. “Oh, wow, I’m… flattered… I think, but I’m not…”</p><p>“As flattering as it is that you think my brother is attracted to you, he likes little miss priss from Ravenclaw.” Fred answered when George started choking on a sip of water he took.</p><p>“Miss Priss?” Harry asked looking thoroughly confused.</p><p>“A certain beater, who would love to give my brother a good beating herself, I must say.” Fred just snickered watching George grab a handkerchief off the table and wipe his face.</p><p>“He isn’t innocent either; I swear he has murder in his eyes when he sees Cedric with the hufflepuff princess.” George blurted.</p><p>“Unlike you I don’t have a jealous bone in my body, don’t tell me you weren’t jealous when Ginny told us about a certain someone entertaining a male on her holiday in China.” Fred shot back tensely.</p><p>“Okay, but also, who was pissed off when they found out that their crush was surrounded by men their whole Holiday and that Cedric took her to The Weird Sisters concert and snogged her face off.”</p><p>“Well, who ended up writing out plans on how to take the mickey out of said girl?”</p><p>“Both of you, I had to hear about it from the both of you.” Ginny said sitting down with a sigh.</p><p>“Okay, Ginny who are they talking about? I’m lost here? Miss priss Ravenclaw and the Hufflepuff princess? I feel like I know them but… I’m lost.”</p><p>“Adrinette Pearman is the one that shot a bludger at George for making a lewd comment and Amelia Novak is the one who almost knocked you off your broom last year trying to catch the quaffle before it fell.”</p><p>“You like Pearman and Novak? Seriously? They don’t seem like they’d give you the time of day. No offense.”</p><p>“Possibly wrong, look at their body language.” Hermione replies boredly from his right.</p><p>“Oi, what are you talking bout Granger?” George asked raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“You haven’t noticed their body language? It’s obvious.” She rolled her eyes. “There’s frustration there, and an obvious flirtatiousness.”</p><p>“I can see Novak because she seems like she’s less rough around the edges, but Pearman trying to kill George is flirtatious?” Harry sounded just as confused as the twins.</p><p>“She was raised in a very…passionate? Home. Her dad’s an auror, her brothers in the military, so yeah it is. Amelia is and has been mostly raised by her dad because her mum isn’t around, so her style is odd too.”</p><p>“Passionate, you call it? I call it being a bitch.” George muttered.</p><p>“Amelia’s style is less deadly than Adreinette’s at least.” Fred snickered.</p><p>“At least Adrinette is hot!” George growled</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean, Mate?” Fred asked.</p><p>“Does it matter!” Hermione balked at them. “Girls are not just inanimate things to looks at!”</p><p>“They are nice to look at though, most of them.”George muttered.</p><p>“Especially if they have a nice figure.” Fred nods.</p><p>“You boys have to be joking.” Ginny scoffed at them.</p><p>“What do you expect…</p><p>“…we’re men.”</p><p>Hermione and Ginny scoffed. “I can’t believe you two, why can’t you ask them on a date like normal boys?”</p><p>“Well, looking at the way they’re talking, I imagine the response would be to get bent.” Harry said chuckling.</p><p>“Flirt first, and actually flirt, don’t be twats.” Ginny nodded</p><p>“They don’t know how to be anything but twats.” Ron told her as he huffed into his seat.</p><p>“Well, they need to learn if they ever want children.”</p><p>“Who wants them to procreate?” Ron asked raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“Oi, same to you, troll.” Fred shot back.</p><p>“He’s the last sibling I want to procreate.” George nodded. “We can mess with our kids and wives. And if they kiss the wrong twin we can milk it for years.” George joked.</p><p>“Oi! I don’t want my wife kissing you.”</p><p>“Why, scared she’ll run off with me? I am right handsomer than you.” George smirked.</p><p>“Any woman unlucky enough to marry you has my sympathies.” Everyone looked up to see Adrinette. She smiled at the girl’s. “I came to tell you both that you should come to the quad tomorrow after breakfast. We’re going to do a bit of catching up.” She gave the twins a glare before turning and walking back over and sitting next to Cho Chang to talk about her holiday.</p><p>“That girl is like bloody ice.” Ron shuddered as he spoke.</p><p>“Shut up.” George scowled.</p><p>“Oh hey Ginny what classes did you take this year?” Amelia asked standing behind Fred.</p><p>“Oh you know, the usual ones, mum convinced me to take history of magic again. But I decided to take, but I got into muggle studies and Arithmacy.”</p><p>“We might have muggle studies together.”</p><p>“That would be wonderful, I could use all the help I can, If I owl dad he’ll get so off topic it won’t even be funny.” Fred kept glancing up at Amelia.</p><p>“Why are you looking at me like that for?” Amelia sneered. “Oh I can help trust me.”</p><p>Fred quickly looked down causing George to snicker. “Doesn’t Cedric need you back at his side, Novak?” George asked leaning in on his hand.</p><p>“Whats that supposed to mean, tweedledumb?” She growled. “Jealous?”</p><p>“Of you, oh definitely. What I wouldn’t have given to share a tent with ol’ Diggory during the Quidditch cup.” He smirked.</p><p>“Oh you should be, he has abs I could wash my robes on.” She said when someone ran into her almost knocking her into the table.</p><p>Cho Chang quickly caught her helping her stand. “Oh, sorry… I.. lost my head. I came to say hello to everyone.” She said softly and a bit nervously.</p><p>“Oh hello Cho, you’re looking radiant as ever.” Amelia smiled. “I was just asking Ginny about her classes when Georgia started in on me.”</p><p>Fred froze before he started laughing. “Don’t forget Fredirica’s staring problem.” Ginny added jokingly.</p><p>“What a beautiful name.” Amia giggled placing her hand on Fred’s shoulder to steady herself, before realizing and yanking it off. Ginny and Hermione laughed while George looked away.</p><p>“I should get going, the feast is about to start.” Cho said quickly.</p><p>“I should too.”’Amelia nodded to everyone glaring at the twins before making her way back to the table.</p><p>“That was like… icing.” Ron told them after she left. “It’s like you were getting threatened by a cupcake. What did you ever do to her?”</p><p>“I honestly don’t remember.” Fred replied. “Do you remember Ginny or George?”</p><p>“Well, you did tell me that she could stand to lose the glasses once.” George told him.</p><p>“You also made a comment about her round face, she was 12.” Ginny added.</p><p>“I am a twat! Her face isn’t round it’s heart shaped, like her arse.” Fred blurted like word vomit.</p><p>Everyone was silent. George stared wide eyes at his brother. “What’s the matter with you, arse.” He said knocking him upside the head. “What would mum say?”</p><p>“Mum stares at dad’s all the time and you know it!! They aren’t innocent or did you not realize where babies come from, idiot?”</p><p>“Mum would be appalled by your words though, bloody idiot.”</p><p>“Wasn’t he just…?” Harry asked and Hermione nodded.</p><p>“What did I miss?” Ron asked confused.</p><p>“Nothing Ronald eat your dinner.” Hermione replied.</p><p>“Honestly, women.” He muttered as he ate.</p><p>Fred and George reached over both smacking him upside each side of his head.</p><p>Dumbledore stood up announcing the new teachers and began the annual speech.</p><p>Adrinette looked over at Amelia and smiled at her. Then her face fell and she turned to the front as Dumbledor announced that all quidditch matches had been cancelled for the year.</p><p>Amelia sighed that’s when she was gonna show Cedric and the damn Weasley twins how good she’d gotten. He announced the Triwizard tournament and after the school song everyone was sent to their dormitories.</p>
