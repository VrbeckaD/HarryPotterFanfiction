    <p>“So let me get this straight,” said James with a cheeky grin, although Sirius was not amused by his oh-so-brilliant pun, “your plan is to use your animagi form, for me to ask one of the hottest Slytherins to ever walk  the halls of Hogwarts to walk you?” </p><p>“Well when you say it like that, it does sound stupid.” Said Sirius downing the rest of his firewisky, “but think about it, everyone trusts dogs! I’ve seen him around your neighbourhood, when he walks the dogs, he talks to them!” Sirius obviously felt strongly about it and James, being his best friend just had to taunt him about it.</p><p>“Sirius, Remus Lupin is two years older than us, he was a perfect student at Hogwarts and now he writes books about werewolves that are included in the Hogwarts curriculum! He’s very,” he hiccuped, “attractive!” </p><p>“Don’t I know it!” Sobbed Sirius into his hands, “I’ve had the biggest crush on that bloke ever since fifth year, and he never even noticed me, this plan has to work!” He stood up in his stool, the bartender was giving him looks and James, who was just as drunk as Sirius nodded apologetically towards the bartender before imitating his best friend. Once up on his stool, he took Sirius’ hand and Sirius said:  “Let’s make a bet! If this plan leads to me and Remus getting together, you have to ask Lily Evans out, no excuses!” </p><p>James paled just thinking about the possibility of having to talk to the fierce redhead that had caught his eye back in school. “BUT!” He yelled, “If you and Remus don’t end up a couple, you will have to give me your motorcycle!” </p><p>“But you don’t even ride!”</p><p>“Ok the bet is on!” Yelled James before apparating back to their loft. He threw himself on their sofa, and reached to pat Sirius who usually ended up next to him on the sofa, when he realized he had abandoned his best friend back at the pub. “Oh well,” he whispered as sleep waved over him, “ he’ll find his way back.”</p><p>But as Sirius stared into space, right where his best friend had been not a second ago, he felt nauseous. He looks down and spoke out loud “why am I so tall?” Before realizing he was still on the stool, as he got off, he fell onto a tall guy, who caught his forearms to provide support.<br/>
“Hello lad,” he said offering a tipsy smile. </p><p>Sirius was in shock, he took in the guy’s features, from his sandy hair to his scars, he felt his strong hands supporting his arms. He was much more handsome up close. “You’re so pretty,” said Sirius before passing out right in Remus’ arms.</p><p>“Is there a way we could go out without guys throwing themselves at you?” Asked Marlene smiling teasingly at her best friend.</p><p>“You’re insufferable,” said Remus rolling his eyes, but he was concerned for the guy in his arms. “What should we do Marls?”</p><p>Marlene smiled devilishly, she loved Remus dearly, but he hadn’t been in a relationship with a guy since he had left Hogwarts and she needed him to find a boyfriend because Merlin, he had been getting on her nerves lately.</p><p>“You should probably take him to our apartment, I’ll get home after a few drinks.” She said eyeing a stunning dark haired girl who was talking and gesturing dramatically next to a redheaded beauty.</p><p>Remus’s gaze kept flickering between her best friend and the handsome lad in his arms.<br/>
“Are you—“</p><p>“Yes I’m sure Remus for Merlin’s sake!” She said before giving him a side hug.</p><p>Remus apparated back to his and Marlene’s flat, he carried Sirius to the sofa and dropped him as softly as possible. </p><p>Sirius unconsciously reached to pat James’ leg which was always near his head only to touch skin. He laughed. Remus was flustered as this stranger had touched his hand, and the guy didn’t seem to remove his hand but was laughing uncontrollably.</p><p>“James, I know you need some action but we’ve been over this, you’re not gay!” He slurred opening his eyes. He did a double take as he noticed the man of his dreams hovering over him, he couldn’t believe his eyes.</p><p>“Is this a dream?” He asked, the effects of alcohol had not worn out and out of the blue, slapped Remus.</p><p>“You’re supposed to ask me to pinch you, not slap me!” Said Remus holding his cheek, completely shocked about Sirius slapping him.</p><p>Sirius was stunned, was he really inches away from the boy he had been in love with since fifth year? Had he just slapped one of the most handsome Slytherins to have graced the face of the earth? Now how was he supposed to get him to fall in love with him. All these thoughts swirled into his mind as he felt darkness engulf him.</p><p>“What just happened?” Thought Remus as he threw a cover over the drunk idiot lying on his sofa.</p><p>“So pretty” whispered Sirius in his sleep, and Remus’ face grew red thinking the stranger had been talking about him.</p><p>The next morning was awkward to say the least, Sirius had not recognized the place he was currently in. Thinking he had been kidnapped, when a hand on his shoulder startled him, he slapped the person behind him.</p><p>“Really!?” Yelled Remus. </p><p>Sirius had little to no memory about last night. </p><p>Remus sat Sirius down in his kitchen and gave him a glass of water, a potion to counter a hangover, a cup of coffee and a bowl of cereal. To break the awkward silence, Sirius tried to start up a conversation.</p><p>“So did we sleep together?” He blurted out, mentally slapping himself.</p><p>Remus spit out his coffee. He said he only brought him to his flat to help him, nothing had happened between them.</p><p>“Well,” said Remus scratching his chin, “you did slap me. Twice.”</p><p>“Want me to kiss it better?” Sirius couldn’t help himself from answering.</p><p>They gawked at each other. And before making more of a fool of himself, Sirius apparated back to his flat, only to find James still sleeping on the sofa.</p><p>“James!” He yelled in his friend’s ear, “we have to do this! Let me be your pet! I’m in love!” </p><p>James stirred slowly.</p><p>“The bet is on mate!” He said offering a goofy smile before throwing up on Sirius.</p>
