          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Remus," Sirius Black said one day to his best friend<strike></strike> <strike>and crush</strike> as they were hanging out. He was just in one of those moods, you know? Not even a bad mood either. Maybe...a flirty mood. "If I was a girl I would totally go out with you." Like no homo, right?</p><p>"Hey!" Their other friend James said when he heard that. "I thought you said you'd date <em>me </em>if you were a girl?"</p><p>"No, I said I'd have sex with you." Sirius clarified. "Meanwhile I'd have a long and fulfilling relationship with Moony here."</p><p>"Oh, that makes sense." James smirked. </p><p>"...meanwhile?" Remus said. </p></div>
