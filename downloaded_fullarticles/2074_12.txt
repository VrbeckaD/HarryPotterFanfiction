    <p>“I think we should see other people.”</p><p>Out of all the things he was expecting on this Wednesday night, this was not one of them. He had thought that his boyfriend was going to push for a threesome again. Something that hadn’t gone over well the first time when he realized that the man he had chosen as their third had gone and flirted with Remus the entire time. They had not gone through with it once it was obvious how that night was going to go.</p><p>Remus stared at his boyfriend. Sure, he and Gilderoy had been in a rut lately, and he had been on the verge of ending it himself a few times now. He hadn’t expected <em> Gilderoy </em>to end it, the man had always seemed content with the eye-candy that Remus’ provided. Remus made Gilderoy look good, and this was not how Remus imagined their night going.</p><p>He glanced over at Gilderoy, taking in his boyfriend’s (ex-boyfriend’s?) perfectly symmetrical face. The way his blond hair was elegantly swept off of his forehead, the way his ice blue eyes twinkled under the dim lighting of the restaurant. He was pretty in a way that reminded Remus of a Ken doll. This was often the topic of discussion between his friends - how plastic Gilderoy was. Even now, with a perfectly frozen yet polite smile thrown Remus’ way. As if they were strangers.</p><p>“Did you bring me here to prevent a scene?” Remus asked, placing his cutlery down with more force than necessary before swallowing the rest of his glass of wine. It tasted like sour grapes. He actually really hated wine.</p><p>“I’m moving to Germany for a film that I’ve gotten the lead role for,” Gilderoy stated. <em> When the Hell did this happen? </em> “I know you love me, but I don’t want to hurt you by being away on location. I want to keep my options open too, not that I’ll cheat on you, but I won’t be this young and fit forever.”</p><p>Remus couldn’t recall ever saying that he was in love with Gilderoy. The man across from him had been decent company, but a poor substitute for who Remus actually wanted. Not that it mattered now. Maybe Remus deserved this, he was a shit boyfriend.</p><p>Gazing around the establishment they were dining at, Remus took it all in as he processed the fact he was being broken up with. Everything was rococo style, overly ornate and brightly colored. Christ, there was even a woman playing the harp on a slightly raised stage. Everything about this was so pretentious and entirely Gilderoy, he was the exact opposite of Remus. They rarely had anything in common. How did their relationship last a year?</p><p>Without uttering a single word regarding what Gilderoy had just said, Remus stood up and left the restaurant. Not bothering to look back once. Actually, he was relieved that Gilderoy had the stones to end it. Still, Remus was angry. More with himself than with Gilderoy. He couldn’t find it in him to care much about his now ex-boyfriend.</p><p>As soon as he made it home, he flopped down onto his couch, brought his pillow up to his face, and screamed. “WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUCK!” It was muffled but it helped dissipate the rage, leaving him boneless and emotionally exhausted.</p><p>His phone was pinging, probably Gilderoy asking him where he had gone. Probably furious at being foot the bill at the bourgeois restaurant. Honestly, everything there was so fake and Remus was still hungry despite having eaten a majority of his tiny meal.</p><p>After laying on the sofa for a few minutes, Remus reached for his phone. He proceeded to order pizza once he deleted the unopened text from Gilderoy. Then he sat and stared at nothing for a moment. What was he going to do now? He was single. It felt as if the shackles that had been holding him back for the last year had finally come off. Remus may not have been the best boyfriend (he was pretty terrible), but he was sure that was not how he was supposed to feel when the person he was serious with for the last year ended things abruptly.</p><p>He took a quick shower and changed into loungewear before the pizza arrived. Once his food was set on the coffee table, he took a few beers out of the fridge and turned on Netflix. It was refreshing to do something so sloven, something that his ex would see as beneath his pretty self. Honestly, why did Remus waste so much time on someone he barely tolerated?</p><p>Maybe it had been the sex. Though even <em> that </em>was mediocre.</p><p>What did people usually do after a breakup? Cry? Did they try to get that person back? Did they scream and throw things around? Did they get rid of their ex’s belongings? When he thought about it, he didn’t want to do any of those things. He didn’t feel like crying. Remus certainly didn’t want Gilderoy back. There was nothing in his apartment that even belonged to his ex. A whole year and nothing to show for it.</p><p>It was better this way.</p><p>He hunkered down onto his couch, Netflix being a comforting static noise as he wrapped a throw blanket that had been over the arm of the couch around him. He needed something to cheer him up, something to squash this irritability. He brought his phone out and went onto AO3 to read the rest of an interesting piece of Messr. Padfoot’s fanfiction.</p><p>Remus had an addiction to written words. At the age of 30, he wished he could be mildly embarrassed by it, but he wasn’t. There was no shame in his harmless hobby.</p><p>He clicked on Cara Mia, a Deathly Hallows fanfiction written by Messr. Padfoot. It was 65 chapters long, and Remus was enraptured.</p><p>Cara Mia was beautiful. He was going on day three of reading it and was near to the end. He wanted to know if Albus and Gellert ended up together. He wanted to know if the slow burn canon divergence would pay off. This was his OTP that he was reading about, in the best-written fic he had ever stumbled across. It was as if every sentence caressed a part of Remus’ soul. There was a total of 92,659 words in this story and Remus was determined to devour all of them.</p><p>He had read and written his fair share of stories throughout his life. He had been writing fics since he was eleven when there were hardly any out there for his favorite book at the time and he wanted more of the story. Remus was just a tad bit obsessed with literature, although these days he hardly read any type of book.</p><p>Each chapter of Cara Mia was deliciously long, and there were no fillers. No nonsense that had nothing to do with the plot. It gave Remus’ fanboy heart a hard-on.</p><p>The fanfiction was amazing, Messr. Padfoot had talent. He had the ability to easily become a published author. Remus hoped that he would one day gather his courage and his creativity to write his own book.</p><p>He sighed heavily. He should stop thinking of the writer as Messr. Padfoot and start thinking him as <em> Sirius </em>. But he hadn’t allowed himself to think of that name in almost three years.</p>
<hr/><p>“How’s Lockhart?” Alice asked the next day before taking a sip of her sweet tea.</p><p>It was lunchtime but they were eating in Remus’ classroom while he graded the papers that he disregarded the night prior. Some of these answers were just idiotic, but they still made him smile. Never let it be forgotten that children were interesting creatures, and most of them were innocently hilarious.</p><p>“He dumped me,” Remus stated while marking Bill Weasley’s paper with ‘B-’ on top with a purple pen. He learned early on that fifth graders didn’t care that he meant 83%. “Said that he’s got a film he’s starring in, in Germany, and that he doesn’t want to be tied down.”</p><p>“What a prick,” Alice scoffed. “I never liked him.”</p><p>“No one did,” Remus muttered as he finished his last student’s paper. He cracked his fingers and straightened the stack of essays neatly to be entered into the computer. He idly took a bite of his sandwich and thought back to the last chapter of Cara Mia he had read. His heart was still aching at the amount of longing the characters had for each other.</p><p>“How much do you want to bet that he’s doing porn,” Alice stated as she capped her bottled tea. “I mean, he’s as dumb as a brick, but he’s pretty. He’d do well in porn.”</p><p>Remus laughed, because yeah he could see it. “I’d feel bad for whoever he was doing the scenes with, he wasn’t that great.”</p><p>Alice sighed, short brown hair tucked behind her ears. “We should go out on Friday. Do something fun, you know?”</p><p>Something fun would be another night on his couch with no one to bother him as he finished reading this fic. That was peaceful. Maybe with Chinese food this time instead of pizza, and more beer. Instead of telling this to Alice, however, he shrugged and gave her his undivided attention.</p><p>“What did you have in mind?”</p><p>“Getting fucked up,” Alice answered immediately, “Frank’s mother is coming to town and that woman is overbearing. I’d like to have some fun so that I have fond memories to look back on while I suffer at her hands.”</p><p>“You’re way too cruel to your future mother-in-law,” He grinned. He had met Mrs. Longbottom twice since knowing Frank, and that was all he was willing. The woman was a bit too much to handle.</p><p>“Tell me about it,” Alice sighed and leaned her head back to stare at the tiled ceiling, “there’s a roof bar in Brooklyn called Hogs Head that’s kind of a club too. We should hit that up.”</p><p>“You don’t feel like we’re too old for clubs?” Lounges, sure. Clubbing was something for young kids. Then again Remus always felt too old for his age.</p><p>“You’re only 30,” Alice pointed out, “and you’re cute. We need to get you drunk and maybe even laid if all you’ve been having this last year was horrible sex.”</p><p>Remus hummed, not disagreeing. It would be a change of pace, especially with the way he was. He wasn’t big on drinking or dancing in public. He wore sweater vests and pressed slacks to work every day, and cardigans with elbow patches with dark jeans on the weekend. He was bookish. Maybe it’d be nice to not be himself for a night. “Fine, I’m in.”</p><p>“Great!” Alice perked up considerably, “come to my place around 8 on Friday, we’ll pregame before heading out. If you’re not dressed hot then I’ll be forced to put you in Frank’s clothes.”</p><p>“What constitutes as ‘hot’?” Remus found himself asking, peering over his glasses at her as she stood and began to gather her things. Their lunchtime was quickly coming to an end.</p><p>“Something tight or fitted. Nothing nerdy chic,” Alice waggled a finger at him. “8 tomorrow Lupin!”</p>
<hr/><p>Remus stared at himself in the mirror. Nude and damp, his brown hair fell onto his forehead, his round hazel eyes followed the litter of freckles that were across the bridge of his nose and the moles on his neck and chest. He didn’t see what Alice did, he wasn’t ‘cute’, not in a conventional way. His face was too angular, all cheekbones and chin, his nose was long and his mouth was too wide. His vision went downwards, chest with barely any hair, a light happy trail. He could count his ribs, his was bony and long, clean lines.</p><p>He was of average height, and narrow. Some would call him lithe. His father would say he’s underfed. And his complexion was lily white, from days spent indoors and under fluorescent lighting. He probably had a vitamin D deficiency. There was nothing really special about him.</p><p>Alice had said they were going to get him laid, but from Remus’ perspective, he couldn’t understand <em> how.</em></p><p>He spritzed on the cologne that he had received as a gift from Sirius years ago, the expensive one that he rarely ever used because he was afraid it would run out. Could cologne go bad? It still smelled of cedar and citrus and smoke. He put some pomade in his hair so that it wouldn’t become a frizzy mess, yet it still flopped across his brow, as if daring Remus to do something with it. There was no use fighting his hair.  With one last frown to himself, Remus went into his closet to pull out a black tee which was a size too small, he put on black socks and a pair of black skinny jeans that matched the shirt perfectly. Then his black Vans.</p><p>He put on his deodorant and turned his head to the left and then to the right, trying to figure out what he was missing. He put on a simple silver necklace that had a small pendant of the Star of David at the end. Still, something was missing. He put his contacts in and tried to put his finger on what exactly he could add to what he was wearing. Something irresistible.</p><p>Then he remembered it. Sitting in the back of his closet, wanting to be forgotten but never thrown out.</p><p>Remus took in a deep breath as he stared at the black leather motorbike jacket. With its multiple zippers, buckles, and studs. It still faintly smelled of motor oil and Blackstone Cherry.</p><p>The jacket was too big on him, meant for a man with a broader frame.</p><p>“Why am I doing this to myself?” Remus muttered, running a hand through his hair and causing it to fluff slightly. He swallowed uselessly, Adam’s Apple bobbing before staring at his mirror image.</p><p>He felt 21 again, stupid and reckless. The jacket reminded him of whiskey-flavored kisses and shared joints in the back of an old yellow ‘97 VW Golf while driving to the beach and singing to Weezer off-key.</p><p>Shaking himself, Remus grabbed his wallet, keys, and phone before leaving his apartment.</p><p>With luck, he’d get so drunk that he’d accidentally lose the damn jacket.</p>
<hr/><p>Pregaming included too many shots of tequila and not enough carbs to soak in the alcohol and laughing at everything Alice’s friend, Mary, was saying because she was cute and funny and Remus could easily see himself taking her home.</p><p>By the time they made it to Hogs Head, they were each slightly tipsy and loose-tongued.</p><p>Hogs Head was chic, fairy lights strung up everywhere, although the lights from the Brooklyn bay and Manhattan across did the space wonders. There were two bars on either side, a dance floor in the middle and lounging areas surrounding it.</p><p>“This is really nice,” Frank commented lowly to Remus. “I’m shocked, I honestly thought Alice was going to take us to a place with a mosh pit or something.”</p><p>Remus laughed, he hadn’t meant to, but he wasn’t sober and had always been a giggly drunk.</p><p>“I’m gonna find us a table,” Frank announced.</p><p>“Let’s dance!” Mary tugged at him and Remus shook his head.</p><p>“You and Alice go, I’m going to get a drink.” He told her, debating on what rounds to get for the table. The bar didn’t have too many people, and for that Remus was grateful. Having one on either side of the club probably helped prevent congestion.</p><p>He was looking over the drink of the night special when he felt the hairs on the back of his neck prickle. Someone stood casually beside him, leaning slightly against the bar and almost entirely in Remus’ space. It could just be a random clubber needing a drink. Maybe someone trying to pick him up, it’s happened in the past.</p><p>The smell of wood and bergamot, a familiar scent that haunted Remus’ dreams, wafted around him. It complimented his own cologne.</p><p>“That jacket looks good on you,” his voice was as smooth as velvet. Something that Remus’ imagination could never replicate, no matter how hard he tried to prevent himself from doing so.</p><p>Remus swallowed his nerves down and took in a deep breath. He looked at Sirius from the corner of his eye, he had forgotten how tall Sirius was, there was at least a four-inch height difference between them. Them running into each other was bound to happen. New York City may have been large, but apparently not large enough. Although the last Remus had heard, Sirius had run off to France to deal with his Uncle’s vineyard. That was roughly two years ago, and now here he was, in a bar in Brooklyn. He didn’t want to admit how much it hurt to see Sirius.</p><p>“Thank you,” Remus managed to say, proud of himself for sounding collected and calm. His heart was beating so fast he was scared it was going to leap out of his chest. “Do you want it back?”</p><p>Sirius leaned forward as he caught Remus’ eye. His hair had gotten longer, it was a wavy black that fell down towards his shoulders, the ends brushing his collar. His stubble was almost a beard, and it was evenly grown. His skin was a lovely caramel brown as if he had spent the last two years outdoors. He probably had.</p><p>He looked amazing.</p><p>“Are you still with that boyfriend that you hate?” Sirius’  asked instead, eyes flashed silver in the dim light as he tilted his head down toward Remus. His smile was full of sinful promises.</p><p>Remus gulped. He had forgotten, he had become complacent with life. Sirius was as bright as his namesake, and Remus felt as if he was suddenly crashing into him.</p><p>It was in his smile, his scent, his eyes, his hair. It was just him being <em> him. </em>Remus wished that he could be anywhere else at that moment. At the same time, he wished he could lean into Sirius. He swallowed again.</p><p>“That’s none of your business,” He whispered. He could feel his ears on fire, his face heated up.</p><p>Sirius scoffed a gentle laugh, “Really?”</p><p>His voice was lowered to match Remus’. It was something that he always did, ever since they were children. It used to drive Remus insane when they were younger, it still did, it forced them to stand closer, forced their heads to be bowed together. It was an intimacy that should not be allowed. Especially since they hadn’t seen each other in years.</p><p>The music around them was loud, there were people milling around the bar laughing obnoxiously. The smell of the Hudson River permeated the air along with the scent of cigarettes on the wind.</p><p>“What’re you doing back here?” Remus asked. He wasn’t sober, but the bubbliness from earlier had dissipated completely. It left behind the type of honesty that only someone as drunk as he was would have. Words unchecked and a guarantee for future regrets in the horizon if he didn’t keep his mouth shut.</p><p>Sirius’ eyes were all over his face, drinking him in. “Visiting.”</p><p>It was a lie, and Remus hated the fact that despite their time apart he still knew when Sirius was lying to him.</p><p>Sirius brought a large hand up to tuck his loose hair behind his ear, and Remus noticed how the band on his finger glinted. It twinkled at Remus almost mockingly. It caused his stomach to churn.</p><p>“You’re right, it’s not my business,” Remus took a step back, away from Sirius. He wasn’t sober enough to deal with this, he was positive that his expression was stricken and his emotions were obvious. “Have a good night.”</p><p>“Re, wait,” Sirius looked as if he were going to grab him, but hesitated.</p><p>Remus scanned the tables until they landed on Frank. He rushed his way through the crowd of people and refused to turn around to see if Sirius was still standing at the bar.</p><p>“No drink?” Frank asked from his spot, he was casually sitting back, uploading a random video he took of Alice and Mary dancing onto Instagram.</p><p>“I’m actually not feeling well,” Remus told him, it wasn’t a lie. “I think I’m going to head out.”</p><p>Frank gave him a concerned look. Brows furrowed, frown heavy on his face. “You okay, dude? Yeah, you look pretty pale there. We can take you home.”</p><p>They had just gotten to Hogs Head. It was kind of Frank to offer.</p><p>“I’ll take an Uber,” Remus shrugged. Realistically he’d take the train. He needed the extra time to think.</p><p>Frank made to stand but Remus shook his head.</p><p>“Tell Alice I’ll text her once I get home,” Remus said before leaving.</p><p>He shouldn’t have left. He should have stayed. Mary seemed interested in him, and Remus would have gone home with her if not for the fact that Sirius was there. Fucking Sirius. Remus hadn’t missed the band on his left ring finger, hadn’t missed it at all.</p><p>His phone buzzed in his pocket as he took his MetroCard out to swipe. He was going to lose connection down in the subway anyway, so his phone could wait.</p><p>Instead, Remus stood in the crowded compartment, he leaned against the door which leads to the adjoined car, feet spread apart in order to maintain balance. A ring on Sirius’ finger shouldn’t be a big deal. It shouldn’t! It didn’t stop the lump from forming in Remus’ throat.</p><p>Well, fuck.</p><p>He couldn’t quite remember how he made it home. The tequila from earlier in the evening sloshed around inside of him, curdling at the memory of Sirius wearing what had appeared to have been a wedding band.</p><p>He stripped off his clothes until he was left in his briefs and socks as he vomited in his bathroom. Tequila did not taste any better when stomach acid got involved. His esophagus burned and his eyes watered, tears streamed down his face with every heave. He needed to take out his contacts.</p><p>Still, why was Sirius back? Now? After being abroad, and obviously enjoying his life? How did Remus end up running into him? It was as if the universe were rubbing salt into the wound that was his broken heart. It had been roughly three years! Remus should have carried on well before now, it was too bad his emotions didn’t seem to think so. He was sure that Sirius would always be his soulmate.</p><p>When all the contents of his stomach were out, Remus rinsed his mouth and splashed water on his face. His phone was still in his jacket pocket and he clumsily made his way toward his kitchen table to get it from the back of a chair.</p><p>There were a few texts from Alice.</p><p align="center">[Alice in Underland]</p><p><b>Alice </b>[22:04]: Frank said you were sick and left?? Are you okay??</p><p><b>Alice </b>[22:08]: Text me when you get home?</p><p><b>Alice </b>[22:23]: Are you home yet?</p><p><b>Alice </b>[22:30]: REMUS!!!!</p><p><b>Remus </b>[22:50]: Sorry, I got home a few minutes ago. I’ve been throwing up since I got here.</p><p><b>Alice </b>[22:55]: OMG! ARE YOU OK?</p><p><b>Remus </b>[22:56]: Yeah, I just need water and sleep.</p><p><b>Alice </b>[22:57]: I’m sorry you got so sick. Get plenty of rest.</p><p><b>Remus </b>[22:58]: Thanks. Enjoy your night.</p><p>His couch was cool against his naked back, and Remus allowed himself to sink into it. He should get up and drink some water, but his stomach couldn’t handle anything. It pinched painfully.</p><p>Alice was kind, and a decent friend. He was glad that she wasn’t pushing for more answers. Although he was sure she’d ask more questions had she been sober. She was probably going to ask him what exactly happened on Monday. At least he had the weekend to adjust.</p><p>He sighed as he chewed on his lower lip before sending a text to someone he knew wouldn’t bullshit him.</p><p align="center">[Lily Flower]</p><p><b>Remus </b>[23:04]: Are you busy?</p><p><b>Lily </b>[23:05]: No, my Friday night is me in my bed with Hulu.</p><p><b>Remus </b>[23:06]: No James?</p><p><b>Lily </b>[23:06]: He’s out with Peter.

I’ll be there in an hour.</p><p><b>Lily </b>[23:11]: I’ll order something to eat.</p>
<hr/><p>Remus was glad to live in New York, the city truly never slept. Especially the closer one got to Manhattan. The Burrows were a little more low-key and family oriented, but it was a Friday night and he blended in with other commuters who were coming and going. He couldn’t imagine living upstate, where everything became rural and more suburban. He couldn’t imagine leaving for New Jersey or Connecticut, where stores closed at decent hours and it was odd to see people milling about past a certain time.</p><p>Remus was in track shorts, the same black tee from earlier, his vans, and an oversized hoodie over everything. He had on his glasses and chewed on his lip the entire walk from the subway to Lily’s building. The summer heat crept slowly in the air. It was nearly the end of June, school would be let out within the next week and Remus would have nearly two months of not dealing with children directly. He had a part-time job lined up with a library not too far from where he lived. Something so that he could survive the summer and afford extra supplies for the next school year.</p><p>Thinking of work was a brilliant distraction for the conversation that he was bound to have with Lily.</p><p>He pressed the buzzer for her unit and took a step back, waiting to see the kitchen window open and her head pop out. Waiting for her to throw her key’s down to him. She lived on the sixth floor, there was no elevator, the building had been constructed before those became trendy. Like his shoebox of a home.</p><p>“Hey!” She greeted as Remus leaned against the door while he closed it behind him. He was wheezing, trying to urge his lungs to work and his knees not to give out. “I got Chinese.”</p><p>Remus slid his shoes off and walked into the small space, joining Lily at her tiny table. She tried to recreate the bistro look in her kitchen. Small round table with a cloth over the wooden top, and two ornate chairs. Containers of lo mein and orange chicken laid out with forks.</p><p>“Thanks,” He told her.</p><p>Lily was the type to always use food as comfort. It wasn’t healthy, and she joked that it was the reason she would never lose weight and would always stay round, but at that moment Remus understood why she did it.</p><p>Her galley kitchen had a single archway which led to the same hallway as the front door, across from the kitchen was her bathroom and her bedroom, to the right of the kitchen archway was the living room. Her building was old and her actual unit was small. Though it was cozy, and clean, and entirely Lily.</p><p>“I’m not even going to pretend to have tact,” Lily sighed into her pork fried rice. Her ginger hair was pinned up into a sloppy bun and she was wearing one of James’ shirts with yoga pants. “What happened? I didn’t even know he was back.”</p><p>She looked indignant, and rightfully so. Her freckles were barely visible under the flush of her cheeks, a heavy frown on her lips and brow. Her chipped nails were holographic and kept catching Remus’ eye.</p><p>“It’s just like I texted. I went out to Hogs Head, that bar-club in Brooklyn, I was going to get myself a drink and there he was. Wearing a fucking wedding ring.” Remus took another bite of his noodles in order to swallow the bitterness that seeped into his mouth.</p><p>“A wedding ring?” Lily sat back, green eyes wide. “Are you sure? What the fuck? How are <em> you </em>Re? Are you okay? This is a lot.”</p><p>“Lily, fuck, it’s not…” He let his sentence drop.</p><p>How could he explain that he longed for Sirius still? How he was Remus’ first thought upon waking, and how he was the last thought before he slept? How he dreamt of Sirius. Silver eyes and coy mouth and clever hands. How his heart was still so broken despite their years apart.</p><p>Instead, he shrugged uselessly. What did <em> his </em>feelings matter? It’s been almost three years, and he had dated. He had been in a relationship until recently. To everyone else, it appeared as he if moved on. And why wouldn’t Remus move on? Especially when Sirius had run off to France, and wasn’t he married now? Fuck, wasn’t he? It appeared that way.</p><p>The two of them being apart didn’t stop Remus from reading all of Sirius’ work. From being Sirius’ number one fan. Just like when they were eleven. Fifteen. Twenty. Twenty-four. Sirius was the sun, Remus would always orbit around him.</p><p>The look Lily threw him now made Remus feel ashamed. Blood rushing to his face. He wanted to cry and was mortified to find his eyes watering. Suddenly Lily was out of her seat and crouched down beside him. Well <em> fuck </em>. And sure it was Lily who cooed and rubbed his back, but Remus wanted to bury himself alive at that very moment.</p><p>He focused on the stitching of the table cloth underneath his hands as he swallowed the lump in his throat not for the first time that night. He had told himself that he’d never shed another tear over Sirius Black. Remus had never felt more stupid in his life.</p>
