    <p>
  <span>I was awakened by the light shining through the window. I sat up, looking at the wall left of my bed. I looked at the calendar, smiling at the thought of going back to Hogwarts. I got out of bed and crossed the large room, approaching the window.  Gripping it, I pushed the window all the way up and looked out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The weather was marvelous. The window faced the back of the house, looking out at a big field and a pond. Off in the distance I saw a stable and a big red barn. There were three beautiful horses grazing next to the pond, the house throwing a large shade over them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Overall, Moore Manor was a pleasant place to live. With three floors and enough space for a family of twelve, it made for comfortable living arrangements.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was owned by my aunt and uncle, who took me in after the death of my parents twelve years ago. They were killed on the same night as Lily and James Potter. Photos of my mother are present throughout the house, yet I've never seen a picture of my own father. The thought still bothers me, but I choose not to dwell on it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I closed the window and walked across the room to where my trunk stood. I already had my whole trunk packed with everything I needed. On it was my folded school uniform. I don't like changing on the train so I'll usually get dressed in my uniform at home. I picked up my clothes and walked into the bathroom. I took a quick shower and dried my hair afterwards. After putting on my uniform I brushed my hair and walked downstairs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kevin and Emily were sitting down at the dining room table. I liked having cousins. They are like the siblings I never got to have. They were only a year apart, with Emily being nine and Kevin being ten. Emily smiled at me when she saw me. I smiled back and sat down in front of them. Kevin just looked at me and then back to his plate. We did not really fancy each other. That and he's always grumpy in the mornings. My aunt, Kate walked in from the kitchen with a plate of food and a glass of orange juice. She set them down in front of me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thank you." I said as I looked down at my plate. Bacon, eggs and toast. Yummy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're welcome, dear." Kate replied with a smile, walking back to the kitchen.  We ate breakfast is a comfortable silence. When we were done eating I took mine, Emily's and Kevin's plates and went inside the kitchen. I put them in the sink and made my way to the living room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>My uncle was sitting down in the armchair, sipping coffee and reading the Daily Prophet. He was paler than usual and his eyes were wide open in what looked like shock and fear. He looked as if he saw the ghost of Salazar Slytherin right in our living room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What's wrong, Uncle Charlie? You look like you just saw a ghost." I commented, sitting down on the couch across from my uncle. He quickly looked up from the paper and shoved it aside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, it's nothing All rubbish in that Prophet, nothing more..." He looked down at his watch and stood up. "Lets start getting ready, we have an hour before the train leaves." He walked past me, heading out of the room. "Wouldn't want to miss the Hogwarts Express would you?" he said in a light and carefree tone. When I was sure he left the room, I grabbed the paper and unfolded it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first page was all dedicated to one article. Under the heavy black ink of "Escape from Azkaban" was a mugshot of a wizard. I leaned back ad relaxed, starting to read the article that caused my uncle's worrying. Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban? Known You-Know-Who supporter? Oh, what news. You-Know-Who's dead. I heard someone walk in and I quickly hid the paper underneath cushions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Get ready honey." said Kate, causing me to nearly sigh in relief. "We're leaving now." she added.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay, I'm coming." I got up and walked upstairs, entering my room. I grabbed my trunk and my owl's cage, walking back downstairs. Pennylane hooted, stirring.  I followed my aunt and cousins outside. Upon putting my trunk safely in the trunk of the car, I slid into the backseat.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I pushed my cart through the crowds, looking around and smiling at anyone I recognized. I slowed down and got my things off the cart. Kate looked at me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You packed everything you need?" I gave her a nod.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If you remember you forgot anything, we can always mail it to you." she said. I thanked her and took a look around. I grinned when I saw my best friend, Kim, walking towards us. She soon broke into a run and threw her arms around me. I laughed, hugging her back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh my gosh, I missed you so much!" squealed Kim. I chuckled and pulled away from the hug.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I missed you too." I told her. The train's horn blew, causing the last of the students to board. I faced aunt Kate, Kevin and Emily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Alright, this is it. I'm going." I hugged each of them in turn. The train's horn blew again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Now get on the train, before it leaves without you." said Kevin. I nodded and picked up Penylane's cage, boarding the train with Kim right behind me. I turned and looked at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You go on, I'm going to find Harry, Ron, and Hermione.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"They won't enjoy the company of a Slytherin?" she asked, a small smirk on her lips. I sighed, shaking my head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's not that. You know they're warming up to you." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I know. It's fine, I didn't really want to sit with you guys anyway." I narrowed my eyes at her, causing her to chuckle. "I'll go find Draco. See you later." I watched her walk down the opposite end of the corridor. I turned around and started walking, looking into every compartment. I finally found a compartment occupied by them. I stepped inside, smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hey, guys."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Amy, hi." replied Hermione. I gave each of them a hug, sitting down. My eyes lingered on the man that was sitting down across from me, his head leaning against the window. He was covered in a blanket, which made it hard to see his face. He seemed kind of shabby, and his presence here made me curious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Who is he?" I asked, setting Pennylane's cage down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's R. J. Lupin, our new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. " I nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Seems kind of strange he's taking the train, doesn't it?" Ron gave a shrug in response.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you guys think he's really asleep?" Questioned Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Seems to be. Why?" asked Hermione.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I have to tell you guys something." Harry stood up and closed the compartment door. After sitting back down he  told us how Mr. Weasley warned him about Sirius Black, and how he told Harry to warn me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why?" I questioned him. "What does Sirius Black have to do with me?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I don't know. Mr. Weasley must know because he said you are in more danger than me." Harry said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, the train stopped and the lights in the compartment turned off. The train rocked, as if something was boarding it. The room became very cold and the water in the water bottle that stood on the windowsill became ice. We saw a hooded creature in a black and ripped cape opening the door to our compartment. I was terrified, I couldn't move. If I could I would reach for my wand. The creature opened the door halfway and looked in. It didn't have a face, just a mouth. It leaned in towards Harry it looked like it was feeding off of his energy. Then, out of nowhere, Professor Lupin stood up and took out his wand, directing it at the creature.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Expecto Patronum</span>
  </em>
  <span>!" When he spoke those words I saw a light come from the tip of his wand and scare off the hooded figure, forcing it to leave our compartment. Harry slumped back against the seat, unconscious. A moment later, the lights came back on and it was warm again. Professor Lupin pocketed his wand and looked around. His eyes landed on me and a look of recognition briefly crossed his face. He cleared his throat and sat back down, getting a chocolate bar out of his pocket. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Chocolate will make you feel better." he said simply, unwrapping the bar. He broke it into several pieces, offering it to us. I was the first to reach for it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thank you, sir..." I leaned back and took a bite of the chocolate. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I am no sir, Professor will suffice." he replied, smiling slightly. Harry came to, immediately sitting up and fixing his glasses.  Professor Lupin handed him a piece of chocolate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Professor, what exactly was that thing?" asked Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It was a dementor Harry." answered Lupin. "Now excuse me, I would like a word with the driver." He  stood up and exited the cart.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I took a sip of my pumpkin juice and set the goblet down. We were currently enjoying our feast. I smiled as I looked around the Great Hall and up at the bewitched ceiling. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Feels like home.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span> I heard snickering and laughing coming from behind me. turned around and saw Draco, Crabbe, Goyle and Kim looking my way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Psst, Potter!" Draco called. Harry, Ron and Hermione turned around. "Is it true you fainted? You </span>
  <em>
    <span>actually</span>
  </em>
  <span> fainted?" The three of them started laughing while Kim shot Harry an apologetic look. Harry ignored her,  turning back around and finishing his pudding. Draco spared me a glance before turning back around as well. Some Slytherin's consider me a traitor because I'm a pureblood that is close friends with muggleborns. I hate the term mudblood. It's one of the most degrading terms you can call a witch or wizard. I turned back around and continued eating. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the feast was over all of us started walking to our dormitories. I had to talk to Kim, now. I wasted my opportunity when I was on the train and I didn't want this to wait until tomorrow, as I probably wouldn't be able to get her alone. When we exited the Great Hall the Gryffindor's went up the left staircase and the Slytherin's went down the right staircase. I pulled Kim aside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What is it?" she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I have to talk to you." I looked around to see if anyone was listening. "Not here."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I took her hand and lead her into an empty corridor. We walked until I spotted an old door with a lock on it. I stopped walking and took out my wand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Alohomora</span>
  </em>
  <span>." I whispered and the lock lifted. I opened the door and went inside, pulling Kim with me. We found ourselves in an small storage room, with half empty shelves lining the walls.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Lumos.</span>
  </em>
  <span>" The tip of my wand lit up, illuminating the space between us. Kim looked at me and rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What did you want to tell me?" asked Kim, getting more impatient. I took a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Listen, I know Draco and his band of buffoons are your friends, but Harry is your friend too. And </span>
  <em>
    <span>I'm</span>
  </em>
  <span> your friend. That's why I'm asking you if you could try to control Draco. He can be really cruel. Not just to Harry but to others also." she quietly listened to me talk. A grin appeared on her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you like Harry, Amy?" My eyes widened, not expecting her to say that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"W-what? I-I..." I stammered, not knowing what to say. Of course I like Harry, but that's not why I want Draco off his back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course you do, Amy. Don't be afraid to admit it..." she teased. I sighed and ran my hand through my hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Fine! I do. But that's not the point..." She gave her a brief hug.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Alright, I'll try to talk to him..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thank you." I whispered. She pulled away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I have to go now, I will see you tomorrow at breakfast." She left the storage room. I listened to her receding footsteps and put my wand in my pocket.  I left and went up to Gryffindor tower. Making my way through the portrait hole, I went upstairs and walked into the room I shared with Hermione. All of my stuff was already there. I changed into my pajamas, making small talk with Hermione I got into bed and crawled under the covers, falling asleep soon after.</span>
