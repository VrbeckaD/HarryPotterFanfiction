  <span class="aster">Severus Snape couldn’t know for certain when was the first time he saw the red-haired girl that he’d one day call friend, yet by his eighth birthday, he had already made her his acquaintance. One of the earliest memories he had of her was from before he had the nerve to actually talk to her. She was alone, her nasty sister nowhere to be seen, playing in the community garden just outside Pillmore Lane. She wore a yellow dress, just like the flowers in her hair. It had taken him a while to notice that the flowers woven in her hair were not actual gerberas as he had first thought, but common daisies that she had changed the colour. </span>
</p><p class="aster" align="justify">Lily was her name and everything about her reminded him of the spring. Her eyes were the colour of lush grass after the rain, her hair the colour of chestnuts and poppies. Her laughter was the chirping of a robin and she was curious like newborn pups. She was kind like the breeze that ruffled treetops and magical like the first cusp of life that appear just as the snow melts. Cokeworth was a grey mass to which spring could rarely arrive, but one look at her and one might believe to be in the most wondrous form of woodland.</p><p class="aster" align="justify">Their friendship had flourished in that same garden, forgotten by working adults in order to pay their bills. Sometimes, her shrew of a sister would come as well, those were dreary affairs that were soon ended by her shrieks. When they were alone, Severus might tell Lily about their kind as one might tell a child bedtime stories of fairytales. She was full of questions that only he could answer and loved to do it, in the most detailed manner. He preened under her attention as she flourished under his directions. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">She’d bring every book on magic he could find inside the dusty old house he was raised in, while she would lend him her favourite tales of fiction, be that <em> Gulliver’s Travels </em> , <em> Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea </em> , <em> Frankstein </em> or <em> Oliver Twist. </em></p>
<hr/><p class="aster" align="justify">The first gift he received from her had been a leather cover journal, for his eighth birthday. Winter holidays were just over, so a profound melancholy had overtaken them, for they would only have the weekends to meet. She had drawn with pastels an easter lily on the last page of the notebook, in a clumsy attempt of a botanical illustration. It had been a cold day, that day. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">“You can write all your ideas on it.” She had said, sitting on a swing and pushing the thin layer of snow around.  “So, when you become a famous wizard and you publish on international papers, you’ll remember to dedicate them to your dearest friend and biggest supporter, Lily Evans.” </p><p class="aster" align="justify">“We are friends, then?” He had asked. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">“Of course, Sev. Best friends.”</p><p class="aster" align="justify">Three weeks later, when her own birthday had come, he had nicked an old copy <em> The Language of the Flowers </em>his mother kept in the attic as his gift to her - an iris he had nicked from a florist shop pressed inside the pages. It was the sort of thing that Lily loved. Rhymes and cryptology, cloudy days and sweet scents, pastel colours and satin ribbons. She was a self-assumed romantic, with a thing for impressionism and the Pre-Raphaelites. It had been her who introduced Chopin and Saint-Saëns to him, but of all the artists she had shown him, Satie had been the one who stuck with him through later periods of life. Even after she left, he would put vinyl on and let it play, a the time did nothing to wash his melancholia away. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">They were still first-years when they had their first big fight. It was around May, and the exams were near enough that they would latter blame their words on the stress caused by them, in order to avoid analysing their disagreement further. They would only patch their friendship up back at home when no prying eyes were around to watch them. </p>
<hr/><p class="aster" align="justify">“Why didn’t you come yesterday?” He had asked, as they walked from their first class in the morning, Transfiguration, to Potions. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">“Viola got news from home, you see, her bunny died and she was so sad, Sev!” She had said, with pity. “Dorcas - you remember her? I introduced you last week - she knows where the kitchens are. So, she took us, girls, to have a mug of hot chocolate. Viola was able to forget for a while, but I don’t know really how she is going to be this next week.”  </p><p class="aster" align="justify">“So, you didn’t think to, I don’t know, warn me before going to the kitchens?”</p><p class="aster" align="justify">“Dorcas didn’t really say where we were going or what we were going to do. I thought it would be quick, sorry Sev.”</p><p class="aster" align="justify">“Really? You blew your best friend off for a bunch of girls you weren’t talking to until last month? That’s nice, Lily.”</p><p class="aster" align="justify">“Sev! That’s unfair, you know I’ve been trying to make friends this year. And I finally did it. What’s so wrong with that? It’s not as if you can’t do your Charms homework alone, you know it just as much as I do.” </p><p class="aster" align="justify">“The wrong is that you forgot about me! You are so selfish, Lily that you can’t see it!” </p><p class="aster" align="justify">“I’m selfish? You want to monopolise me, Severus. You don’t greet Dorcas, you don’t even talk to any of my friends! I thought it was ‘cuz you are shy, but you have made friends with those chauvinistic prats of your house alright! You are just self-centred.”</p><p class="aster" align="justify">“I suppose that muggle-born sobby bunny less girl and the soulless harpy are better friends than a self-centred me, then.”</p><p class="aster" align="justify">“Of course no, Sev. You’ll always have me.”</p><p class="aster" align="justify">“Well, I don’t need you, Lily!”</p><p class="aster" align="justify">“Fine, guess what? I don’t need you either. Goodbye!” </p>
<hr/><p class="aster" align="justify">That had been the first of the many fights they would have through the years. Sometimes they would last minutes, others hours, once in a while, they had one that lasted days or weeks. They only had three that lasted months. But they only had one that lasted years, and that never had been one to have an end. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">
  <em> But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different? </em>
</p><p class="aster" align="justify">The night after that one he had walked back to his common room alone, way past the curfew. He couldn’t really reconcile the words Lily had spoken with the memories he had of her. In his mind, the part capable of rational thought argued that Lily was really a muggle-born, and that if he wanted to succeed in this world he would have to recognise her supposedly inferiority. Severus didn’t really believe in the discourse adopted by the ruling class - but he had come to understand the necessity to spout it: he wasn’t like Potter or Black, with their families with money and influence on their own, he hadn’t the luxury to go around denying the discourse of those that would promote him. Lily was simple in that area. She saw everything in black and white as if right and wrong could be easily found in real life. That wasn’t true, the world was way more grey than most Gryffindors could understand, and thousands of reasons lead to a number of much smaller actions. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">Severus did hate the absolute conviction a quarter of the school seemed to have, all of them dressed in red and gold. They were brash in their judgment of morality and Lily was not exempt of that. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">The next days, he would allow the idea of talking to her once again swirl around his mind, yet he never did it. Her words were engraved in his mind. Sometimes, he would catch a glance of her red hair, and remember the words she had spoken to him. He would remember the way her indigo dressing gown contrasted with her hair that night, the contempt in the eyes he had held so dear for over seven years. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">
  <em> You've chosen your way, I've chosen mine.</em>
</p>
<hr/><p class="aster" align="justify">One of the last times he saw her was after their N.E.W.T.s. Almost everyone in their year sat by the Great Lake, enjoying a rare sunny day in what was beginning to prove to be a rather cloudy Summer. Soon they would graduate, and then they would be separated by war. Lucius had already sent him a letter, and there would be a gathering at the beginning of July, in which he hoped to introduce Severus to some connections and their lord. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">Severus wrote in his journal - not the one gifted to him by Lily, many years ago, that one laid forgotten at the bottom of his trunk - but in a magical one, capable of hiding its writings if one hadn’t received permission to read it. He was surrounded by his connections, Mulciber, Selwyn and Black. Mulciber was jinxing some birds in the tree they were under, while Selwyn cursed a bracelet Severus had never seen before. Black read a book, the kind that would belong to the Restricted Section if he had not brought it back from home. The Blacks had a truly impressive collection. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">Suddenly, he noticed Lily. She was quite far away, in the cobstone beach, surrounded by friends. Her girls around her, their feet unbothered by the bitterly cold water they were sunk in. Lily herself had a head on her lap, of none other than James Potter. His friends were also there, Black and Lupin duelling against each other while Pettigrew talked effusively to a girl. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">Lily was quite fashionable, despite her muggle clothes. A nice teal skirt covered her knees paired with a raisin coloured blouse. Potter raised his wand to her hair and a crown of purple pansies graced her hair, making her laugh. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">Flowers. Flowers used to be a thing for them. Not anymore, nobody could contain the breath of springtime that was Lily Evans. They were dating for many months while now, he knew, but the sight never ceased to bring fury to his mind. Potter was still an arrogant, self-important, ridiculous and violent swine, but she refused to see it now, blinded by affection in a way that she never allowed herself to be with Severus. Her life would be dragged down by that wretched man. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">If it hadn’t been for James Potter, he’d still have Lily by his side. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">She bent down to kiss him, and Severus decided to walk away. Soon, all would be past. </p>
<hr/><p class="aster" align="justify">The last time he had seen her had been different. The Order had organised a skirmish in Avery Hall, to release some muggles they kept at the dungeons. He had glanced briefly at her, while she fought Corban Yaxley. She was bleeding around her torso, but that didn’t seem to stop her from blinding him with a pink eye and blasting him away. Her hair was shorter and she moved swiftly, dancing in battle with another woman, a bit older, that if he could remember was the newly married Auror Alice Longbottom.</p><p class="aster" align="justify">Severus nearly shouted for her when the Cruciatus Curse was thrown in her direction, but Longbottom got to her first, pushing her out of the way. Soon, his attention was redirected to Fabian Prewett, and he engaged in a duel with him. </p><p class="aster" align="justify">He never saw her again after that day. </p>
