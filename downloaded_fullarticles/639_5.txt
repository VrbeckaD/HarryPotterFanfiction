<p>"<strong>SLYTHERIN</strong><strong>!</strong>" bellowed the hat. It echoed around the large hall and those that wore the brilliant green and silver robes politely clapped as the First Year walked down the dais steps towards the table on the far left. The other houses, mostly those garbed in yellows or in blues, clapped as well. Those dressed with bright crimson either huffed silently or had been staring off into space for the past ten minutes.</p>
<p>The was enough to gather what little information I was offered today on the different aspects on houses. Throughout the entire train ride and what little I've seen of the sorting, there were a few peculiar things that caught my attention. Those in red, Gryffindors from my guessing, were only as rowdy whenever someone joined their ranks, but were well mannered and gave respectful applause to those other than the those in emerald green. But never did the two houses give an applause for the other, and instead huffed or stuck up their noses in retaliation to the other gaining another member among their ranks.</p>
<p>"Granger, Hermione," the professor, McGonagall if I remembered her name properly, called out. The bushy haired girl from the train shakily walked up the steps herself and plopped down on the stool, glancing up warily at the torn up hat that was placed upon her dark curls. They sat there for a while, like some others before her, before the Sorting Hat finally decided on the house she was to be placed in with a loud "<strong>RAVENCLAW!</strong>" which sent the girl rushing down to the table in blues and silver that sat rat next to the one in green. She would have gone down to the table with the Sorting Hat still placed upon her head if it wasn't for the stern professor grabbing onto the ratty tail end and tugging it back for the next First Year student. Everyone clapped, for it seemed the rivalry was only placed between Green and Red, rather than Blue and Yellow.</p>
<p>This was a pattern for the next students. An eleven year old would walk up, nervous, and the hat would be placed on their head. Depending on the kid, the Sorting Hat would take from only a few centimeters from touching the first hair to three minutes after putting the hat on for the second time just to be sure. Most went to Gryffindor or Hufflepuff before they reached the "G"s, where a Goyle, Gregory was the first Slytherin after a long line of other houses to be sorted for the left side of the hall. After that Slytherin popped up more. A Malfoy, Draco was the next after him, and then a Nott, Theodore.</p>
<p>Once they got to the letter "P", I prepared myself. I knew who I was, how important I was and will be once my name was called out. Only one who was silly enough to <em>not</em> open their text books before term wouldn't know. Of course, I didn't know myself, all things considered, until a few weeks before, but I still managed to figure out how important I was to the Wizarding Community. How those reacted at the sight of the flesh wound that had settled just above my brow for nearly all my life. If it wasn't for that, I would just be a normal wizard who probably still wouldn't have known about the magical world that lived just a few streets away from 4 Privet Drive.</p>
<p>After a while, I finally heard my name called from the witch. A loud and clear "Potter, Harry" was all it took to silence the entire hall and I had hundreds of eyes boring into my back as I walked up the dais steps. I didn't realize how rickety the stool was and nearly fell over once I sat down, but managed to catch myself as soon as the hat was settled onto my head. It flattened the messy dark curls just enough to cover parts of my vision.</p>
<p><em>"Hmm, interesting, interesting,"</em> I heard inside my head. It was a bit startling, to hear a voice that wasn't yours speaking to you. </p>
<p><em>"What seems to be so interesting?"</em> I asked the hat.</p>
<p><em>"I'm wondering where to place you, Mr. Potter,"</em> it responded. <em>"So many possibilities reside in you. Ravenclaw may be of your best interest. You seem to enjoy knowledge and how to use them, but you have no curiosities to drive you to truly think outside of that box. Gryffindor is another option for you as well. Lots of courage and the need to be worthy of those around you. But you don't see bravery to be the best of virtues to follow, I see... Hufflpuff would have been considered, if you felt that you needed to be loyal to those you deemed worthy of such. Only those that have been betrayed would feel such a thing, I see... So that leaves Slytherin, those who crave to follow their own set of rules, to analyse what is before them before acting so. You seem to have such qualities, but what's so interesting is your almost lack of ambition to do what you were born to be."</em></p>
<p><em>"I was born to be just Harry,"<strong> </strong></em>I retaliated. I remember a few wizards and witches whispering among themselves when Hagrid and I walked through Diagon Alley. Many mentioned that the "savior of the wizarding world had finally arrived" but I just want to be Harry. I'm only eleven and already they're hoping I'd defeat the Dark Lord before I'm thirteen. <em>"Nothing more, nothing less. Just put me in a place where I can be Just Harry."</em></p>
<p><em>"Just Harry? Alright, I've decided,"</em> the hat concluded, and I could hear the seems on the hat open and the Sorting Hat to finalize his decision.</p>
<p>"<strong>SLYTHERIN!</strong>"</p>
