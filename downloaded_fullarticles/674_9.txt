  <b>October 1988<br/></b>
</p><p>The bushes rustled and the trees groaned with the oncoming wind. Detached multicolored leaves twirled across the sidewalk like ballet dancers on a knife. The small schoolchildren escaped their prisons in favor of frolicking in piles of said leaves: crunching and munching, undertaken by their small shoes.</p><p>The sounds and smells of the late-summer circus fill the air as the poor underpaid circus-hands begin to reorganize the animal-filled wagons, carousels, and music-makers. Popcorn and cotton candy paper litter the ground where the circus will stand for one day more. The horses bray and the lions roar as they too sense the changing winds. They know something is afoot, something that can be disguised by the red leaves and the costumes upheld by small children and circus performers alike. When the screams of delight mask the true screams of terror is the opportune time for It to strike.</p><p>However, It cannot wait. It has just awoken, and It is hungry, very hungry.</p><p> </p><p align="center">★★★</p><p> </p><p>Claire LeBeau walked down the sunny sidewalk, feeling the autumn breeze blow through her hair as though it wanted to lift the blond locks out of their two small pigtails. She giggled and adjusted her pink backpack as it slightly slid off of her shoulders. The jostle caused the indigo poodle patch that had been poorly ironed on by an overworked mother to finally give way, falling to the ground before getting caught in the undertow of the leaves. Claire continued walking obliviously as the wind carried the light patch further and further away from its owner.</p><p>Dodging trees and mailboxes, the patch within the leaves blew down the street. It twisted in the air, high above the sidewalk before the wind suddenly stopped. The airborne foliage fluttered to the ground from its great height. The patch fell too, aiming for the asphalt street beside a storm drain. When it was not three inches from the ground, an unkempt costumed arm shot out of the opening and snatched the patch from the air with a rapid ‘thwack’. With the patch clutched the clenched fist, the arm slitchered back into the drain, grinding along the asphalt with a hiss.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Claire, she would not be making it home from school. Not even as she walked along, stuck in her own little world, did she ever think of the danger that resided underneath the seemingly average little town whose highlights were made up of three square blocks, a school for each appropriate level, a church, and a drugstore. Children were rather naive that way, and this naivete made them easier targets.</p><p>Claire began to hum a little tune to herself as she neared the wooded area near her house. Unlike the deciduous trees that spotted the cemented sidewalk, these trees were coniferous as the day was long, therefore they didn’t have leaves to lose. Sure, they had pine-cones and needles to throw down upon the dirt ground that lie underneath it, but the most important thing was the fact that the lack of bareness provided an excellent cover for many things. Hiking, camping, and love trysts were among the most popular of these things, but the most relevant thing in this moment was murder. The humming stopped.</p><p>Claire could see her house. It was about four more houses away. She was so close.</p><p>All of a sudden, she heard a loud snap that for any adult could fall into one of two categories: a snapping branch, or a snapping bone. However, everyone, no matter what age, has the sense to attempt to place where the sound likely occurred. Claire did exactly this. Swiveling her own head and shoulders in the forest, she tried to place where she heard the snap.</p><p>It was then that she noticed that there was no noise coming from the forest itself. The buzzing from the cicadas, bees, and flies was absent. The cheerful tweets of the birds was also silent. Neither did the wind rustle the trees as it had before. It was too quiet.</p><p>However, it wasn’t before long that the tune Claire had been humming to herself earlier was echoed back to her from beyond the visible treeline. This time however, it was whistled, and it wasn’t whistled very well. The rendition was enough that she could tell what it was, but each of the bastardized notes reflected it for what it truly was: a lure. Unfortunately for Claire, it was a good one.</p><p>Her lovely little white Mary Janes stumbled from the path, one after another as she stepped foot into the darkness that the high-reaching branches provided. The inside was just as eerie as the outside. There was barely any light, but there was just enough to create a suspiciously straightforward path that led Claire deeper and deeper. She didn’t find anything wrong with her situation until the sun went behind the clouds and she heard the whistling stop, leaving her in the opaque silence.</p><p>This was the part where she realized that she was hopelessly lost. Panic began to set in. Blood began to pound her heartbeat faster and faster. A snap identical to the one before echoed in the silence right behind her, catching her attention. Her head whipped around to once again attempt to identify the source, but she couldn’t see anything that would have caused such a sound. Turning her head back around, she was met with yellow-red catlike eyes that glimmered in the darkness of the bushes. Fear chose this moment to grow within Claire, choking her hopeful “Hello?” into nothing more than a whimper.</p><p>A playful growl like that of an overgrown puppy answered back. The girl’s fear halted, overridden by curiosity. The schema in her memory of the thoughts and ideas that made up a dog were exhibited here in those eyes and the growl. That wasn’t good for It.</p><p>The supposed dog stepped forth from the bushes that concealed it from sight, revealing itself to be something else altogether.</p><p>It had indigo fur in patches along its body, looking more like a shaving accident than anything normal on an animal. Its mouth was too big, its smile stretching all the way to its ears. Its body was the most disturbing with limbs too long and what looked like a hunchback. The “dog” was clearly not a dog. It was closer to a hyena, and it sure acted like one when it began to laugh that same anxiety-caused laugh that makes hyenas so famous in the first place. The laugh warbled from a high-pitched squeak to a low rumble that sent a chill down Claire’s spine.</p><p>The dog began to advance on the young schoolgirl as she stood there uncomprehending what she was seeing. However, when it got close enough, her body took over her mind’s control and she ran.</p><p><img title="File_000" src="&lt;a%20data-flickr-embed=" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1305888259" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1305888259" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/> <img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1755/40591723650_eb1aa9db34_b.jpg" alt="File_000" width="1024" height="640" data-pagespeed-url-hash="4137555450" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);" data-pagespeed-url-hash="4137555450" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></p><p>The chase was on as Claire flew through the dense forest the same way she came. Low-hanging tree branches swatted at her arms and face while exposed roots threatened to trip her. The footfalls of the snarling beast trailed her in the same way a shark follows the scent of blood. In this case, It was following the scent of her fear.</p><p>Claire could see the light of the neighborhood through the trees, the metaphorical light at the end of the tunnel. However, just as she was about to breach the visible treeline, a root actually tripped her. Her face hit the ground causing her vision to become blurred as she flipped herself over to get up. A scream escaped her lips as she met the face of the dog, or, well, two of them because of her doubled vision. It had stopped to watch her fall, but It was quickly bored of this chase. As Claire attempted to rise, the dog got down on its haunches, winding itself up to pounce.</p><p>Not a split second passed before the large animal landed on the frail child, claws scratching into her chest and half-hazardly pulling out her heart and lungs. The sick squelch of the gooey flesh echoed in Claire’s ears as she died.</p><p>Unperturbed by a lack of life in the child, It continued to feast. The next parts to be consumed were the lower organs. At some point during this process, It had morphed into his clown form. The transformation caused little distraction because there was no pause in his consumption. The muscles and fat came next; so ripe with bloody adrenaline and fear that the creature actually moaned with satisfaction. It had been twenty-seven years since his last meal.</p><p>Soon enough, there was only skin and bone left. Blood soaked the front of the clown costume as It made quick work of tearing, grinding, and consuming the remains. The same demented giggle echoed through the vicinity as the creature slunk back toward It lair. <em> Soon </em>, It promised. It would need to feast again very soon because the long sleep always made It weak. The first feedings were always close together for that reason.</p><p>Crooked steps wandered through the water of the Barrens, always vigilant but this time not ready to be seen by any stray man, woman, or child until at least a few feasts.</p><p>However, as was usually the case, the only sign that anything occurred at all in the forest was the large bloodstain on the ground, hidden later by bushes and foliage until the police begin to investigate later that night. Pennywise took immense joy in the misery and grief of the family upon finding out that their youngest child was never coming home again.</p><p> </p><p>
