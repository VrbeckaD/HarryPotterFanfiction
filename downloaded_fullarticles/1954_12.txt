    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p class="western">He was flagging and it was obvious.</p>
<p class="western">Ascending the school rankings at Shujin Academy, holding down four part-time jobs, and maintaining his activities as head of the Phantom Thieves as well as ensuring he actually had a social life as well was <em>exhausting</em>. There just were not enough hours in the day to devote to all the things and people he wanted to do and see, not only that but everyone had their own problems and issues that he wanted to help them with, but he just didn't have the <em>time</em>. Kawakami-sensei and her guilt money, Ohya-san and her missing friend Kayo-san, Shinya's self esteem and his pushy mother, Iwai-san and his past connections, Ann's modelling, Ryuji's old friends on the track team, Yusuke and his artist block, Makoto worrying after Eiko-san, Futaba's unconsciousness and their looming Medjed deadline, the ever increasing number of requests to deal with people via Momentos. It felt like he was being pulled in a thousand different directions all at the same time, and he could barely breathe through the pressure of it all sometimes.</p>
<p class="western">Which is what brought him to here, and now, fumbling his way through his third shift at the beef bowl restaurant that week and dropping a stack of bowls across the floor, shattering many of them.</p>
<p class="western">He cursed under his breath, immediately kneeling to pick up the pieces, this was the <em>last</em> thing he needed today.</p>
<p class="western">“Kurusu-san, go take five,” Potsu-san told him suddenly, kneeling beside him. Potsu was the only other worker at the restaurant and their last remaining full time employee. Akira hadn't really spoken to him much, they were both pretty quiet guys despite being roughly the same age (he thought, it was hard to tell how old foreigners were sometimes), but Potsu was always busy and didn't really stop to make small talk, meaning it was nearly impossible to get to know him, he was always attending a customer, filling in paperwork, washing up, cooking, cleaning, he just didn't stop. And he had apparently been there long enough to decide that getting to know the ever rotating door of part-timers was pointless. In all honesty, Akira hadn't really tried to get to know him all that much, he was nice enough, but in a distant kind of way as if he was scared to get too close to people. Sure he admired the perkiness of the foreigner's ass in the locker room at the end of a shift when they changed out of their uniforms and headed home (it did seem a little odd that Potsu would always tell him to get home safely instead of have a good evening), but that was about it, he didn't even know his first name. He knew he'd been told that first shift, but had quite forgotten it in the onslought of other information that had been crammed into his head that day.</p>
<p class="western">“I'm fine,” he objected roughly, reaching for a large shard of porcelain.</p>
<p class="western">Potsu covered his hand, stilling it, “Take five,” he repeated softly but firmly, “I don't know what's going on, but you're all over the place. You'll get hurt if you carry on like this. Take five, I can handle it. Wash your face, come back when you're settled,” he suggested, peeking up through wild black hair with alarmingly green eyes hidden behind foggy scratched round glasses.</p>
<p class="western">He realised then that he had never <em>actually</em> made eyecontact with Potsu-san before. He sighed heavily, rubbing his face as someone shouted for another curry bowl, Potsu called over his shoulder that it was coming right up before taking the small handful of large bowl shards from Akira's hands. “Go,” he ordered as he dropped them to the floor, and picked up the few still good bowls to be put back in the wash before getting the broom.</p>
<p class="western">Wearily, and warily, the highschooler got to his feet and shuffled out of the main restaurant, hearing a few of the regular customers asking Potsu if he was alright and getting a generic, “He's been under a lot of stress lately. I hear exams are coming up, probably not been sleeping as much as he should be. Would you like more rice with that?” from Potsu as he cranked his efficiency up three notches and took over the front of house alone.</p>
<p class="western">Morgana nosed his way out of his bag in the locker room, “Hey, hey, you okay? I heard a loud crash,” he admitted as the door swung shut behind him.</p>
<p class="western">He sighed heavily and sat down beside his friend, rubbing his face with a slightly shaking hand, mentally cursing himself for fucking up like that. If that had been on a heist.... he needed to sort himself out before someone got hurt. It was a good thing their manager spent so much time in the office watching TV operas at full volume, he probably saw and heard absolutely none of that.</p>
<p class="western">“Just dropped some bowls,” he finally admitted once he felt less like his bones were going to rattle their way from his body.</p>
<p class="western">When it was just himself working, Morgana could sit on the shelving above the prep counters and be his 'eye in the sky' so to speak, doing the brain work of making sure he didn't forget an order. But when Potsu-san was on shift, he had to stay in the locker room because the other teenager had hawk-like eyes, able to spot dirty fingernails and grease spots on the floor in a dark room at thirty paces. It was kind of alarming. Akira knew he'd never allow an animal into the kitchen, he was pretty strict about food hygiene and kitchen standards, the number of print outs he had been sent home with on that first day was shocking – more so was the fact that his manager did not care if he knew or didn't about allergens and cross contamination, but it was Potsu-san who held him back after closing and took him through it all and explained why it was so essential before telling him to youtube an allergic reaction, because that was the consequences of not doing their job right. Akira had never really thought of fast-food as being particularly dangerous until that rather eye-opening evening. For the record, he never, <em>ever</em>, wanted to see someone in anaphylactic shock in person, more still, never wanted to be the cause of it either.</p>
<p class="western">“It'll be okay, Joker, they're just some bowls. I don't think you'll lose your job over that,” the feline quickly rushed to assure him, worming his way out of the bag in order to crawl into his lap.</p>
<p class="western">He huffed a small smile, rubbing his friend's head, he wasn't scared about his job. Bowls broke all the time. They had another box of them in the dry store and he knew that if the manager hadn't seen anything then Potsu wasn't going to report him – he never reported any of the other part-timers when they broke things.</p>
<p class="western">The door door slid open, “How're you feeling, Kurusu-san?” Potsu asked as he made his way in, bottle of water in one hand and a tray with a medium BBQ bowl with extra vegetables, and a chocolate doriyaki still in its packaging and cool from the fridges on it. He stopped and then stared down at Morgana in Akira's lap, the feline practically flattening himself into his stomach and trying to look smaller. Shit, they'd been caught.</p>
<p class="western">“....Better now for having seen your pretty face,” he found himself blurting out, desperately trying to deflect attention from Morgana with terrible flirting.</p>
<p class="western">The cat groaned in his arms, claws sliding out to prick at his skin, “That was bad and you should feel bad,” he scolded, appalled at his lack of charm. Potsu's eyes widened as he looked down once again at Morgana. The smallest of their thieves folded his ears back worriedly, “Maybe he won't tell on us? He feeds me sometimes out back on break time, so he can't be that bad of a guy. Right?” he asked worriedly.</p>
<p class="western">The other teenager set the tray of food down on the other bench and slowly backed away to the door, “Don't let him into the kitchen,” was all he managed to choke out before he fled the room.</p>
<p class="western">Akira groaned and flopped backwards to lean against the wall behind them.</p>
<p class="western"> </p><hr/>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">He gaped at the manager, “Potsu-san <em>quit?</em>” he blurted in shock.</p>
<p class="western">The man nodded, looking miffed, “What happened Kurusu? He was one of my best workers and today he just handed his uniform in and said he was leaving, wouldn't even offer an explanation. Did he <em>say</em> anything to you? You were working with him today.”</p>
<p class="western">He swallowed and shook his head in bewilderment. “He – didn't say anything to me. We barely spoke, to be honest,” he explained faintly. Was this because of Morgana? He seemed unusually spooked when he saw him, was he maybe afraid of cats? No, Morgana said that sometimes Potsu <em>fed</em> him in the back alley when he was on break and the cat was stretching his legs. So what had set him off? He had seemed <em>fine</em> until – until Morgana.<em><b>..</b></em></p>
<p class="western">...Could he have <em>heard</em> Morgana speaking?</p>
<p class="western">No, that was a bit of a stretch.</p>
<p class="western">And yet....</p>
<p class="western">They still hadn't found the person with the black mask in the metaverse. And no one could understand Morgana until they'd been <em>in</em> the metaverse. Had he been <em>working</em> with the person behind the mental shut downs all this time?</p>
<p class="western">Almost immediately he wanted to hit himself, he was leaping to wild conclusions without evidence, and besides that.... he honestly didn't think Potsu was that type of person. Yes they didn't speak much, but he <em>had</em> noticed how hard the other teenager worked, how he would sometimes let a meal go free to someone who looked particularly down on their luck, how all the left overs they couldn't keep ended up going into his bag but found their way into the hands of a few homeless people he saw sometimes on his way back home. And yes, like Morgana said, he often fed the stray cats in the alley behind the restaurant. Hardly the behaviour of someone who murdered others.</p>
<p class="western">His manager growled in frustration but eventually sent him home with his pay, looking vexed and uncertain as he immediately began to look through his usual pile of job applications, no doubt to find someone to replace Potsu.</p>
<p class="western">He changed, and collected Morgana in a daze, waiting until they were walking back to the station before telling him what had happened. He didn't share his thoughts on the possibility of Potsu being their black mask, it was ridiculous, and not only that, Morgana hadn't listened to anything beyond his quitting, already lamenting the loss of his beef cuts at volume and crying for the young man to come back.</p>
<p class="western">He shook his head in amusement as he descended into the station – and spotted Potsu in his casual clothes rummaging in his bag for his railpass.</p>
<p class="western">“Hey! Look! There he is! Go ask him why he quit! My beef depends on it!” Morgana yelled in his ear, practically crawling out of his bag to urge him onwards to the foreigner.</p>
<p class="western">Potsu must have heard the yowling because he looked up at them the moment Akira took a step forward, and his face drained of all colour.</p>
<p class="western">His friends back in the country always complained about his cat-like tendencies, how he would always nap in summer, that flash something shiny in his general direction and he couldn't ignore it, the staring, etc. Looking back on this <em>exact</em> moment, he could only hang his head in sheepish acknowledgement that they were wholly correct about his feline behaviour.</p>
<p class="western">Potsu bolted, and, unable to ignore him, Akira took off after him.</p>
<p class="western">“AHHHHHH!! Joker! What are you doing?!!” Morgana howled, digging his claws in frantically as he vaulted over the ticket barrier, and chased the teenager down the platform. He was having a lot more luck dodging all the pedestrians than Akira, he was falling behind! “He's jumped the ticket barrier again! He's heading into the underground pass!” Morgana reported from his shoulder, using the extra height to peer over everyone's heads and keep an eye on their target.</p>
<p class="western">He skidded around the corner, dodging a business woman and vaulted the ticket barrier himself, charging down the stairs that he could see Potsu at the bottom of, the teenager glancing over his shoulder once and then taking off again. He was a <em>speedy</em> little bastard, but he ran down into the underground mall and there were only so many exits down there.</p>
<p class="western">“Ah! He's heading up the stairs! Directly in front, past the convini!” Morgana called as he dodged past a group of girls from Shujin and took the stairs three at a time after him, heading into the underground walkway and taking a sharp left at Morgana's instruction, the two of them chasing the head of messy dark hair left again and back out onto Central Street.</p>
<p class="western">That was when they lost him.</p>
<p class="western">Panting and winded as he finally left the underground, he looked around desperately through the evening crowds and darkness.</p>
<p class="western">Morgana groaned, “Damn, we lost him,” he complained, tail flicking in disappointment.</p>
<p class="western">Akira huffed, dragging a hand through his hair in frustration as he panted for breath and coughed a little. Damn. He sighed heavily and began to slog his way back home, doubly exhausted now from the mad run through the streets and disappointed in both himself for being unable to catch Potsu, and with Potsu being so suspicious as to run like that. It wasn't doing the guy any favours against the suspicion now growing in his mind.</p>
<p class="western">Should he bring this up with the others?</p>
<p class="western"> </p><hr/>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">He took the next three days of evening shifts at the beef bowl place, but Potsu didn't show up again, he had effectively cut all ties with the place apparently. No one had his home address, his phone number, his e-mail, anything. Even his locker was empty, not that he had much in there Akira remembered, just his clothes and a can of deodorant. Not even a photograph of a girlfriend or a family member.</p>
<p class="western">No sign of him on the train platforms either, and he <em>did</em> linger and wait. But with the last train to Yongen-Jaya pulling up he couldn't afford to do it for long. He was forced to put it all out of his mind as he focused on keeping the others calm as their Medjed deadline loomed and Futaba continued to pass in and out of sleep as she dealt with the trauma of having her palace collapse and her persona awaken within such a short period of time. He was both grateful and annoyed it was summer vacation because he could do as he pleased, but on the other hand there was nothing better than school to distract him from his troubles.</p>
<p class="western">Ohya-san had called him begging for more info on the Phantom Thieves, and considering that the Medjed challenge and the current speculation online any article she wrote would get a lot of attention. If he played his cards right and insinuated the right things, they could drum up even more interest, it was always a good idea to strike while the iron was hot and give her something good to work with both before <em>and </em>after a Heist.</p>
<p class="western">He just wished he didn't have to go to the red light district in Shinjuku for it.</p>
<p class="western">It was a good thing he was tall, people didn't tend to look twice at him as he meandered down the streets with his hands in his pockets, just fast enough to have an obvious destination, but not too fast as to appear nervous and thus an easy mark. He still got eyed by a couple of the hawkers in front a couple of the more.... risqué establishments, gauging to see if they could drag him in and drain his wallet before brushing him off. He dressed a little too well to be 'desperate', but not well enough to be 'repressed', and eventually reached Crossroads without incident.</p>
<p class="western">It was quiet as usual before the post-work crowd arrived, Ohya was already pickled and perched at the bar, her back to him as she muttered bitterly under her breath, Lala-san glanced his way as he came in and smirked at him, but her customary reprimand to keep it to a dull roar didn't come. Instead she glanced over her shoulder as one of the doors into the back opened up and a small figure in a dark purple furisode decorated in white and pink cherryblossom patterns, cinched shut with a deep burnished gold obi, long dark hair brushing their shoulders as they carried a large crate of bottles in.</p>
<p class="western">“Set them down over there,” Lala commanded to the unknown girl who made a noise of agreement and knelt down behind the counter.</p>
<p class="western">“Oh! It's you!” Ohya greeted sloppily, finally spotting him in the mirrors behind the alcohol bottles at the bar, “How's my <em>faaaavourite</em> Phantom Thief Fan?” she cheered happily as he took his usual seat.</p>
<p class="western">He thought about it for a second before answering in a way he knew she's appreciate, “Overworked and unappreciated, yourself?” he asked politely, letting her guffaw for a moment.</p>
<p class="western">“Same!” she chirped with a bright false laugh that barely hid the bitterness she quickly washed away with a mouthful of her drink. She frowned down at it and then shook it demandingly, “Lala-chan! Refill!” she crowed.</p>
<p class="western">Lala snorted at her, “You handle this Harii-chan. Show her the bottle tricks you did me and she'll love you forever,” she teased the young girl as she got up, carefully brushing her hands off.</p>
<p class="western">“I... don't think I can do them with these sleeves, Madam,” the 'girl' admitted, turning just enough for Akira to get a glimpse of a familiar face, and a black velvet choker hiding the adam's apple he knew that Potsu actually had. However, unlike him, clearly Potsu actually needed his glasses to see because when he turned to them properly, he clearly didn't recognise or even <em>see</em> Akira's facial features as he bowed politely to them. “What would you like, Ohya-sama?” he asked demurely, playing the part of hostess perfectly. Wow, Ann could take lessons from him on acting, he decided eyeing the way the young man was holding himself and speaking – it was a complete one-eighty from his usual attitude in the beef bowl shop. It was almost shocking how much of a difference taking those glasses off was though he decided, listening with half an ear as Ohya-san listed her demands, a refill for her, and a glass of the same for him.</p>
<p class="western">'Harii-chan' looked at him, green eyes clearly not seeing him. His former colleague was well done up, wearing a shoulder length black wig, delicate make-up with careful contouring to make himself appear older and less foreign, he offered a politely doubtful smile, “Does Sir have any I.D.?” he asked gently, making Ohya scoff and try to wheedle her own way, and get politely, and implacably, shut down.</p>
<p class="western">“I'll just have a water,” he assured him, watching as Potsu frowned a little at the sound of his voice.</p>
<p class="western">“Of... course, sir,” he said before slowly turning away and quickly moving to make the drinks up. He rolled his sleeves up, and that was when he started flipping the bottle, much to Ohya's noisy excitement and appreciation as he made up her drink in as flashy a means as possible. He wasn't even making a cocktail for her, it was purely for entertainment until he slid the glass with her refill over and then poured a glass of water for him. “Is there anything else I can get for you?” he asked politely.</p>
<p class="western">“How about a phone number so Joker can stop tripping over his tongue?” Morgana sassed from the depths of his bag, sounding both amused and long-suffering.</p>
<p class="western">He nudged his bag not so gently with the toe of his shoe as Ohya started looking around the room wildly, “Did a cat get in here?” she demanded, eyeing the floor as if it were going to attack her.</p>
<p class="western">'Harii-chan' had clearly heard Morgana as well, his face had paled again, and his smile was decidedly fixed as he avoided looking at Akira, “I didn't hear a cat,” he admitted quietly, “Perhaps I should check out back,” he mused stiffly, turning.</p>
<p class="western">Lala waved him down, “I'll go. You don't know your way around the basement that well. If a cat has managed to get down there, I'll find it,” she promised before handing 'Harii-chan' a plastic keyfob, “Front is yours.”</p>
<p class="western">'Harii-chan's face was stuck in that rictus of an expression between professional smile and horrified grimace as he accepted it and tucked it into his obi, “Of-of course Madam. I will do my best,” he promised with a polite bow.</p>
<p class="western">“Maaan, where did Lala-chan pick up a cutie like you?” Ohya-san demanded as soon as the proprietress was out of sight, the door swinging shut behind her, and likely taking all of 'Harii-chan's hopes and dreams with her judging by the look in his eyes.</p>
<p class="western">The plastic polite smile was back, “Madam Lala happened to be the friend of a friend. When I mentioned needing work she admitted that an extra pair of hands would be helpful,” he explained sweetly, still pointedly not looking at Akira who was beginning to get a little annoyed with being treated like wallpaper.</p>
<p class="western">He could ask why he quit the beef bowl shop, or he could assure him that he would do a good job... or he could try to fluster him into making some kind of slip up by flirting – not that it would be a hardship. He hadn't exactly <em>known</em> he was bi, he'd only ever been physically attracted to girls before, but it was kind of undeniable that Potsu-san had an incredible butt, and looking at him dressed up like this was.... very nice. He had thought Yusuke very attractive when he met him, but hadn't exactly been <em>interested</em>. Maybe this was just his type?</p>
<p class="western">“Why'd you quit the beef bowl restaurant?” he asked, instead of anything else. Potsu-san clearly already knew who he was, and there was no denying that Akira could recognise him even with the make-up and outfit.</p>
<p class="western">“Eeehh? You two know each other?” Ohya slurred in her usual manner, leaning forward in her chair with a reporter's instincts for gossip as 'Harii-chan's polite smile fell into an uncomfortable frown that he was quick to try and hide behind a sleeve.</p>
<p class="western">Akira nodded, “We used to work at the same restaurant in Shibuya,” he admitted watching Potsu-san carefully.</p>
<p class="western">The young man tried to shrug a shoulder and look nonchalant, “...It was just time to move on,” he explained delicately, “I couldn't afford to stay there, and the hours were no longer convenient,” he explained, <em>lied</em>, while avoiding eyecontact with Akira who felt his stomach drop. So. It really <em>was</em> his fault that Potsu-san quit working at the restaurant.</p>
<p class="western">“People have been asking after you,” he said, watching as his face fell a moment with real regret before he began to busy himself with cleaning behind the bar.</p>
<p class="western">“Maybe I'll drop by on a day when I don't have a shift. It would be nice to be a customer for once,” he added with a painfully false sounding laugh that he hid behind a sleeve.</p>
<p class="western">Ohya laughed as well, agreeing to let other people serve you for a change was the best before demanding another refill of her already empty drink. Potsu-san actually did laugh, a quiet little thing, but did as he was told, once again spinning the bottle through the air before pouring her drink with a smile. She practically chugged it before demanding another, taking the young man aback. Clearly this was the first time he'd actually met Ohya. He repeated what he was doing and handed her another drink which she was quick to try and drain.</p>
<p class="western">“Uhm, Ohya-sama, perhaps you should slow down?” he suggested worriedly, “You'll give yourself an upset stomach like – ”</p>
<p class="western">And predictably, Ohya snapped at him.</p>
<p class="western">“Aww! Shuddup! Yer not my mother! Just keep 'em comin' or I'll write an expose revealing <em>all</em> of Lala-chan's secrets!” she threatened drunkenly, swaying dangerously in her seat. It was the same empty threat she issued when Akira first came to Crossroads, Lala never took it seriously, neither did he, because he knew that there was no way in hell Ohya would ever so such a thing to her bestfriend (he had some suspicions that perhaps Ohya might have had a crush on Lala but didn't know how to approach it). 'Harii-chan' clearly took it seriously if the way he reared back as if slapped, his face spasming in anger for a moment before it settled into a cold expression.</p>
<p class="western">“Very well, Miss. I will add the inevitable cleaning fee to your tab,” he informed her icily before making her up another drink, this time without the spinning bottles which made Ohya wince a little as the glass was set down with a very sharp tap in front of her before 'Harii-chan' went to empty the dishwasher on the far side of the bar away from them.</p>
<p class="western">“Shit. I really ballsed that one up, didn't I?” she complained to herself before taking another mouthful of her drink with a sigh. “I can't catch a break. My publisher doubled my quota meaning I don't have any free time to look for information on Kayo-chan, my mom is on my back about finding a husband, and now I've pissed off Lala-chan's little kitten. Hell,” she bitched under her breath before chugging her drink and rubbing her face.</p>
<p class="western">And then, as predicted, she groaned and staggered to her feet, “Ugh, my stomach. I'll be back in a few.” Before tottering off towards the ladies room. Experience dictated that she would be in there for a while, if she didn't pass out while in there. Normally he would get going but....</p>
<p class="western">He gestured 'Harii-chan' over, “Can I have a juice, please?” he asked politely, watching the other teenager frown at him before sighing and coming over with a glass in hand.</p>
<p class="western">“We have tomato, orange, cranberry, lemon, apple, mango, lichee, melon, and pineapple. Which would you prefer?” he asked stiffly.</p>
<p class="western">“Orange juice.”</p>
<p class="western">“Coming right up,” he said before heading for the fridge to get the carton out.</p>
<p class="western">“You know, you <em>can</em> tell me the truth. Why did you really quit?” he asked coaxingly as the glass was set in front of him.</p>
<p class="western">'Harii-chan' pressed his painted lips together before giving him a plastic grin, “Sorry, you haven't reached the required levels to unlock my tragic backstory,” he declared, flinching as Morgana cackled in his bag 'Shot down in flames!' crowing from the feline.</p>
<p class="western">Levels, huh?</p>
<p class="western">“Then let's make a deal,” he suggested smirking around the lip of his glass, the effect was probably ruined because his target couldn't even see his face, but the tone left little to the imagination none-the-less.</p>
<p class="western">A particularly deadpan expression crossed the foreigner's face, “A deal, huh? Only problem with that is you have nothing I want.”</p>
<p class="western">“Maybe so. But I'd like to get to know you. Maybe once I do, I'll be able to think of something in exchange,” he admitted with as charming a smile as he could. 'Harii-chan' was clearly thinking about it, looking away from him and pulling on a strand of hair from his wig with a conflicted look on his face.</p>
<p class="western">He shook his head and turned away, “I doubt it. You should head home. Shinjuku is dangerous at night,” he dismissed just as Lala-san returned from the basement, huffing and grumbling. She looked between them, the empty glass in front of Ohya's usual seat, the juice in front of Akira, and then sighed deeply.</p>
<p class="western">“How long's she been out?” she asked long sufferingly.</p>
<p class="western">“Only five minutes, Madam,” 'Harii-chan' informed her, “I – she threatened to write an article on you- ”</p>
<p class="western">Lala waved it off, “It's an empty threat sweetheart, she talks a big game, but we go way back, she'd never.” She grinned slyly at her staff who breathed a sigh of relief, “I have too much dirt on her to risk it,” she bragged, prompting an actual laugh from his former colleague.</p>
<p class="western">“Ahh, that explains it,” he said with a grin.</p>
<p class="western">Akira looked away and began drinking his orange juice, feeling uncomfortable all of a sudden.</p>
<p class="western">Lala-san chuckled, “Well, I didn't find our feline friend, but I did find a case of sweet potato shochu on the top shelf of the wine rack, think you can pull it down for me?” she asked looking at 'Harii-chan' who straightened up and nodded eagerly.</p>
<p class="western">“Yes, of course, Madam,” he agreed and fled into the back without a backwards glance.</p>
<p class="western">Lala turned to him with a raised eyebrow and a pointed look on her face, Akira grimaced at the unspoken demand and continued sipping his drink without answering. Eventually though she sighed and flapped a hand in annoyance, “Fine, if you don't want to talk then listen. I won't let anyone bother Harii-chan, I hear one word of complaint from him about you and you can meet Ichiko out front,” she warned severely before beginning to clean up after Ohya, “He likes practical things and sweets if you're looking for gift ideas,” she added not looking up at him as she took Ohya's glass and tipped the dregs away.</p>
<p class="western">He flushed, “I'm – not – interested like <em>that</em>,” he managed to get out.</p>
<p class="western">Lala rolled her eyes, “Sure you're not,” she agreed sarcastically before glancing at the clock, “You'd better make a move, kiddo. Shinjuku gets rowdy at night and we're almost at riot hour.”</p>
<p class="western">Glancing at the clock he grimaced and finished his drink, “Thank you, Lala-san, please tell Ohya-san I'll see her again later.” When she pulled her head out of the toilet.</p>
<p class="western">“Travel safe,” Lala told him, collecting his empty glass.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
