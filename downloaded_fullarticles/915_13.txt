</p>
<p>
  <span>Well, here we were.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I took a drink of whiskey and sighed heavily, feeling as though I was bone-weary. I couldn’t remember the last time I felt this tired. This worn out. And I had played professional quidditch for over a decade and been coaching for nearly that long. But this. This was something else. I looked out across the party, seeing all the happy faces. My son Jamie and his wife Lila were dancing slowly, staring into each other’s eyes. My other two sons – Remus and Alan – were doing shots with George in the corner. Remus’ fiancé Laura and Alan’s girlfriend Bridget were not far off, talking about whatever it was they were talking about.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>All around were friends and family. Most of the quidditch league was there as well. Should have known that my daughter would have the biggest, grandest – and most expensive – wedding of them all. Though I blame that mostly on her new husband, regardless of whoever’s idea it was. Frowning, I continued searching the dance floor, trying to locate them. Where the bugger had that girl gone off to? Hopefully not snogging like a teenager in a broom closet somewhere.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sighing again, I reached for my glass, thinking back over the past several months and the ordeal they had been. Here I thought after two wars - and nearly a third - and coaching Puddlemere United for over 10 years, I had faced the worst. I apparently hadn’t taken into consideration the marriage of my little girl.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But perhaps I should start at the beginning. It all started about nine months ago…</span>
</p>

  <b>November 2026</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Where’s Pix?” I asked, walking into the kitchen. The triplets were at the table while my wife Iris was standing at the stove, finishing up lunch. Lila stood helping her. Even with everyone’s busy schedules, we still managed to have lunch at the country house once a month as a family. It wasn’t necessarily mandatory, but everyone showed up. Usually Pixie was the first to arrive with Wills in tow, which is why it was odd that lunch was nearly on and she still hadn’t shown up. Having a lie-in didn’t seem like Pix, always being the first up out of all the kids.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Think she said she’d be a little late, right?” Remus asked, looking at Jamie. It was an odd sort of look, as though they were trying to keep something from me. Jamie just looked down at his plate, not saying a word.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yea, that’s what she said when she came over just before I left,” Alan said quickly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why she at yours?” I asked, walking over and taking a seat at the table. It was odd that she’d pop by today before lunch.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Dropped off some potions and such. Then Lily asked her for help with something,” he said smoothly, which only made me more suspicious. They always made Alan talk when they were trying to hide something.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“She couldn’t take care of it later?” I asked, reaching for a glass of ice tea. “Or yesterday? She didn’t have a match.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lils was fairly insistent. And last night was the Halloween party. Didn’t have time because she was getting ready for that,” Remus said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I glanced over at Iris, who was watching the boys from the stove, a curious look on her face. Lila had suddenly become very interested in the salad she was making.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“They lyin’ to us, Red?” </span>
  </em>
  <span>I asked. She offered me a smile and quickly turned back to the stove.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Not this time,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>she replied. I shrugged and turned my focus back to my sons. Jamie had gotten married a couple years ago and was settled in with Lila. Her father Marcus – my old school rival – had moved into a small cottage in the nearby village. He came over most nights after he finished work. If someone had told me back at Hogwarts that someday Marcus Flint and I would be friends and that our children would marry, I’d of likely boxed their ears. Never would I have thought that would happen. Funny how things change.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It likely wouldn’t be long until Remus proposed to his long-time girlfriend Laura. He was practically living with her as it was, leaving Alan and Christos in the flat along with Harry’s youngest Lily, who was in her first season as reserves seeker for the Harpies. She had moved in the week after she graduated Hogwarts, taking up residence in Pix’s old room. I had suggested she take Jamie’s room so that Pix would still have a place there, but Pix insisted Lily take it, putting the final nail in that coffin. She was finally and truly settled in the old warehouse with Wills.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And Christos didn’t seem to be in any hurry to get back to the island, saying he was keen to stay in London for the indefinite future. I suppose the fact that he was dating my niece Roxanne had something to do with it. They had been together since the troubles with the Network and, unsurprisingly, George had seemed thrilled by it. He took it much better than Perce with his daughters, who was still complaining about Ryan Kelly even though he and Lucy had been married two years now and she was six months pregnant with their first child. He wasn’t much better with Molly’s boyfriend of a year, even though the poor bloke was doing rather well in the Ministry, working in the Department of International Magical Cooperation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And they thought I was unreasonable.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I couldn’t help frowning slightly. Never had I expected Wills and Daisy to end up together. And apparently for good as she had formed a connection with him nearly three years ago. I told them they weren’t allowed to marry until Pix was 25 and for the most part they seemed to be following along with it. Part of me hadn’t expected them to, granted Wills would do just about anything to stay on my good side. His Christmas gifts had only gotten more extravagant as the years passed. But that was another story.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The Prophet come in this morning?” I asked, looking back at Iris. Out of the corners of my eyes I saw all three boys freeze slightly as Lila walked over with the salad and sat next to Jamie.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not sure. Might be on the front porch,” Iris said, not looking up from the stove.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Might as well look over the news while we wait on Pix,” I said, starting to stand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m sure Pix’ll bring it in when she gets here. She’s likely on her way,” Alan said, grabbing a crisp from the bowl. I stopped and looked over at him. Shrugging I settled back down. It was a Sunday after all. Whatever news could wait a few more minutes. Granted my suspicions were still up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How was the party?” I asked. To be honest, I was surprised Remus and Alan had shown up when they did considering they were likely to have gotten incredibly drunk the night before. Pix must have improved upon their mother’s hangover tonic for them to look so cheery.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good, as usual,” Remus said. “Pix and Wills had the best costumes.” I rolled my eyes slightly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What did they go as this year?” I asked, sighing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Claire and Jamie Fraser,” Alan said with a grin as he glanced over at Iris. She stopped and looked over, surprised.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“From Outlander?” she asked. Alan nodded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Huge red dress. Everyone had to clear a path for her whenever she moved,” he said, chuckling.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Isn’t that the same characters we did that one Halloween in Hogsmeade?” I asked, finding the names familiar. Iris nodded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They did a TV series on the books several years ago. Guess Daisy watched it,” she said. “I can’t wait to see the pictures.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Should have seen Wills in his kilt. Going around talking about how proud he was of his Scottish girlfriend,” Remus said. “Granted he had a piss poor accent.” I rolled my eyes. Of course, he’d do that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He’ll probably wear one in the wedding just to get on Dad’s good side,” Jamie said, laughing. Remus and Alan glared at him from across the table.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’ll take a lot more than a kilt,” I muttered, wondering just what Remus and Alan were upset about. We’ve all known since the connection they’d end up married at some point. “But thank Merlin we have some time before that.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course,” Jamie said quickly. “You said 25, right?” I nodded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If he knows what’s good for him, he won’t propose until Pix’s 25</span>
  <span>th</span>
  <span> birthday,” I growled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oliver. Daisy is an adult. I think she’s old enough to decide when she wants to get married,” Iris chided as she started sending dishes over to the table. “We’ve known for years that they’ll get married at some point. Wills is already 36.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just because they are connected doesn’t mean they have to go and get married right away,” I nearly shouted. And it was true. Daisy only turned 23 about four months ago. She was still a child in my mind.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“As I recall you were 23 when we married,” Iris said, smiling slightly. I stared at her a moment. Blast Red and her good sense.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yea, but you were 27!” I replied, determined not to lose this argument. “And I’m still none too thrilled that it’s Wills. He’s way too old for her.” Iris sighed and rolled her eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Tonks and Remus were 13 years apart,” she said, returning to the fridge to get something.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But they didn’t meet when Tonks was 8 years old!” I shouted. The triplets laughed softly. Turning to them, I huffed slightly. “And you lot encouraging them.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Dad, we did nothing of the sort,” Remus said. “That happened all on its own.” I sat back in my chair, silently stewing over the fact that my daughter – my little girl – was dating and someday marrying an annoying bloke 13 years her senior. Who still happened to be my star chaser. Which meant I wasn’t allowed to hex, jinx or beat him up since I needed him to win the Cup. Not to mention I got a tidy sum from management every time the blighter made the British World Cup team roster.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Anything else interesting happen at the party? James get jinxed again because of his costume?” Iris asked, returning to the table with a pitcher of ice tea and sitting down. The triplets glanced at each other before answering – highly suspicious.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Nope, nothing,” Jamie said too quickly. “James was relatively tame this year.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, turns out Kingfisher’s got a new girl,” Remus said. “Seems really happy with her.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s wonderful. Who is she?” Iris asked, leaning forward.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Marlena Kaster. Plays chaser for the Harpies,” Alan said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I thought she was lovely,” Lila said softly. “They are very much a good match.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did Lucy and Ryan go?” Iris asked, starting to fill her plate. I watched her silently until she paused. “She’ll be here any minute. It won’t hurt if we started eating.” I rolled my eyes slightly as the boys attacked the food.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yea, went as mummies,” Remus said with a snort. Iris chuckled. Even I had to admit it was an entertaining idea for a costume for the couple. What with Lucy about to be a mum and all.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Where is Daisy? This is getting ridiculous,” I huffed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Relax, Oliver, I’m sure she’ll be here soon,” Iris said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yea, Dad. Give her a break. She’s probably tired after last night,” Jamie said. He froze again as Remus and Alan glared at him. Again. Something was definitely up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright, out with it. You three are obviously covering for her for something,” I said, sitting back in my chair and crossing my arms in front of me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I think we should wait on Daisy,” Iris said. I looked over at her. She must have seen something. They were all hiding something from me and that did not settle well.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What. Happened. Last. Night,” I said slowly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good going, Jamie,” Remus said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yea, you couldn’t hold off for a few minutes longer?” Alan shot at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Boys. Now,” I said, not caring that they were all 25 going on 26. Jamie sighed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well… so something else happened last night,” he started.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yea, I get that. What?” I said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well… technically this doesn’t mean that they’ll get married before Pix is 25,” he continued. In a split second all I saw was red. Jumping to my feet, I banged my fists against the table.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“THAT SLIMY SNAKE! I TOLD HIM NOT TO ASK HER UNTIL SHE WAS 25!” I shouted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You said marry, Oliver,” Iris shot back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“BESIDES THE POINT! HE DISOBEYED MY ORDERS!” I shouted, glaring at her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Really, must you be so unreasonable?” Iris said, rolling her eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is my little girl we’re talking about!” I yelled. I could feel my blood pressure rising by the second. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oliver William Wood!” Iris shouted at me. “You will sit down and be reasonable!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Instead, I pulled my wand out and apparated to the flat in the city.</span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>~~~</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“DAISY NYMPHADORA WOOD! GET YOUR SKINNY ARSE OUT HERE NOW!” I shouted as I appeared in the living room. Christos was sitting at the bar, eating something from a bowl. He seemed shocked to see me there. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mr. Wood! How good to see you,” he said, smiling as he put the bowl down and slid off the stool. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Where is she?!” I demanded. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Um, well…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Roxanne starting to come down the hall in her pajamas and then quickly turn back around.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“DAISY!” I shouted again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Dad, what are you doing here? I had to stop by to grab something and then was about to head over,” Daisy said as she walked down the corridor into the living room, looking confused. Lily followed her in athletic shorts and a Harpies t-shirt, some of the makeup from the Halloween party still visible on her face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hiya, Uncle Oliver,” she said cheerfully as she walked over and hopped on a stool next to Christos.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did Wills propose to you last night?!” I shouted. Daisy’s nostrils flared as her eyes flashed red.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Bloody, fucking Jamie,” she muttered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is he here?” I demanded. Daisy crossed her arms in front of her and sighed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wills, get out here,” she said. Wills shuffled down the corridor, having the audacity to look ashamed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hi, Coach!” he said too brightly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO WAIT!” I shouted, starting for him. Daisy put her hand up, effectively freezing me. She was too much like her mother sometimes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Dad, we were just on our way to tell you,” she said, her hands resting on her hips. I tried to speak, but being frozen prevented that. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“You’re only 23,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>I thought.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I know I’m 23, but that’s besides the point. You were 23 when you and Mum married.” I glared at her. “For Merlin’s sake, Dad! When are you going to realize that I’m not a child anymore!” I just stared at her. I knew she was right, but still she was my little girl after all.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you promise to be civil?” she asked me. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’ll try,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>I thought. She waved her hand, unfreezing me. I cleared my throat and straightened my shirt, glaring at Wills.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We were on our way to tell you,” Daisy said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We wanted you to know before you saw the paper,” Wills added, causing Daisy to roll her eyes and groan. The paper? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s in the damn Prophet?!” I shouted, causing Daisy to jump slightly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, there wasn’t anything we could do about that. He went and proposed at the damn Halloween party,” she said, glaring up at the tall player.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What can I say? Wanted to make a grand gesture,” he said, grinning.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The ring wasn’t enough?” Daisy said with a snort as she crossed her arms in front of her again. It was at that moment that I caught sight of the large ring, glittering on her hand. Blimey, it was nearly the size of her. Part of me wanted to jinx him, but I knew Daisy would just put up a shield. So instead I sighed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Best get to the house. Your mother will want to hear about it and see the ring,” I said. Daisy looked over and grinned at me. She ran over and wrapped her arms around my neck.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I knew you’d come around,” she said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is not me accepting this,” I said, glaring over her shoulder at Wills. The color started draining from his face as he realized that with Daisy hugging me, I had a clear shot at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course, sir. Coach,” he said, gulping.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The last thing I heard before we all left was Lily complaining.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well that was no fun…”</span>
</p>
