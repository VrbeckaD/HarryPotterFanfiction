  <em>June 1, 1993</em>
</p><p>On the effective date of the Werewolf Protection Act, Remus stood outside the ministry in the rain, his hands on Zack’s shoulders, murmuring the incantation to renew the feeble shield he had cast to keep them dry. It wouldn’t have been a difficult spell to maintain under ordinary circumstances, but this day, only thirty hours after the night of the full moon, it was a struggle to stay upright, let alone use any magic.</p><p>For that reason, many of the stoic, grim faces surrounding him were saturated with rain. A couple wielded umbrellas somewhat clumsily, and most were shivering in the threadbare attire of the poverty stricken. His kind had been shunned to the point of unemployability for all Remus’s life. He had dedicated his career and spare time to changing the state of things, including persuading so many frightened men and women to reveal their true selves, accepting the repudiation in an effort to further the cause. To show those who knew them that a werewolf was not a monster; that in fact, they had unwittingly called a werewolf a friend.</p><p>Now, Remus saw accusing glares on many of the familiar faces in the crowd. He bore it with all the steadiness he could muster; he met their eyes and stilled his trembling hands by grasping Zack more tightly. In response, the boy tilted his head back against Remus’s torso and smiled up at him with such uncomplicated trust, Remus thought his heart might stop.</p><p>Merlin, he thought, feeling sick. How we’ve failed him. He wished Sirius was there to lean on—physically, emotionally. Remus had, in happier post-moon periods, found a shy delight in the special care that Sirius liked to show him when he was weakened. So much so he had sometimes feigned the exhaustion for a few extra hours to prolong all the fuss.</p><p>But there was another line for the Responsible Parties. Bile rose in Remus’s throat, recalling Sirius’s offhand remark that the office was the same one where one licensed pets and magical creatures.</p><p><em>Tagged, like a dog</em>, Remus thought bleakly.</p><p>A tall, willowy witch appeared in the doorway, in bright green glasses and Department of Magical Creatures uniform robes. She looked at them all with a tight-lipped, but not unkind smile. Remus was so brittle at that point that this bare indicator of humanity undid him; the shield failed and he and Zack were abruptly doused with rain. The boy yelped, then laughed, because Zack was perpetually good-humored, and Remus hoped to hell that the world he’d been born into didn’t soon take that away.</p><p>As the assembled crowd moved forward to the entrance, Remus was startled by the strong smell of wet dog. He laughed, pained, because he didn’t know what else to do, and bent over to press a quick, desperate kiss into the hair on the top of Zack’s head.</p><p>Sirius stood in another line in another part of the ministry, trying not to think too carefully about what was happening. Sirius often used conversation as a distraction. He was excellent at polite and largely meaningless socializing, and falling into the familiar patterns, drilled into him since infancy, was oddly soothing. He had initiated the strategy with the wizard in line just ahead of him, an aged Pureblood who had known all of Sirius’s great aunts and had struck a mutually beneficial agreement with a werewolf for personal security, which sounded to Sirius like voluntary enslavement, if there was any such thing.</p><p>Only slightly less depressing was his exchange with the wizard and witch who fell into line behind him, and informed him they had generously agreed to register a werewolf couple in exchange for a modest monthly fee.</p><p>Merlin.</p><p>By the time Sirius was summoned into a chamber to fill out the paperwork, he was feeling more off balance than he could recall since boyhood, possibly the moment when he had realized, listening to James wax poetic about the most compelling aspects of Lily’s figure, that he strongly preferred the shape of a man.</p><p>And that was before he saw the contract.</p><p>“I don’t understand,” Sirius told the ministry staffer, a young man barely old enough to shave and wearing ill-fitting gray robes. Sirius double checked the magical signature and then the signature page, trying to reconcile the two. “This is spelled as a binding contract, but there’s nowhere for Remus to sign.”</p><p>“I’m, I’m sorry, sir, but - Remus?”</p><p>Sirius returned his blank look with one of his own and tapped the first page, just above Remus’s name. “Remus Lupin. Zack is a minor, so I suppose I...understand,” the word had to be forced through gritted teeth, “in his case, but...”</p><p>“Ah! Oh, yes, I see, sir. The werewolf. There is no need for the creature to sign. His legal status being, ah, that of a creature.”</p><p>His universe was off kilter. This couldn’t be right, that his—that <em>Remus</em>, the best and kindest person in the world, who was more of an adult and a better caretaker than Sirius could ever hope to be, was subject to this horror. He stared down at the contract, and briefly considered setting it on fire, then he recalled the sight of Remus’s face that morning in the safely neutral space of their home.</p><p><em>Don’t do anything rash</em>, Remus had said, his large hands warm on Sirius’s shoulders, their bodies so close that Sirius could sense Remus’s steady breath. <em>No grand gestures, either.</em></p><p>It hadn’t hit Sirius at that point. He’d been upset by the election, shocked by the legislation, but it had all seemed like—philosophy, principle, not—well, he’d known that so many of the innocent, already unfortunate werewolves would suffer. But he’d thought that, with him, Remus and Zack’s lives would not be truly changed. Distasteful though it was, it was only paperwork.</p><p>Remus, who knew him as no one else ever had or ever would, realized that Sirius wouldn’t feel the new reality in his bones until he was physically there, in the ministry, a table separating him from a bureaucrat who was telling him that his soulmate and child were mere “creatures,” and reminding him in a monotone and indicating with his index finger the paragraph which stated expressly that the registrant would be personally responsible for any attacks, thefts, or acts of vandalism committed by his charge(s).</p><p>Sirius wanted to go back in time to that morning and kiss Remus. To press their mouths together, grasp the taller, leaner man’s waist, and bite his lower lip, gently, until he felt it tighten and curve into a smile.</p><p>The only way Sirius knew to articulate his feelings for Remus was in this way. For someone who talked with ease, he struggled to actually say anything meaningful with words, and it troubled him that instead of offering true comfort on this horrible morning, Sirius had only grinned at Remus’s admonishment, rolled his eyes, and made a playful promise to “be good.”</p><p>At least Zack was too young to really understand, which left Sirius doubly motivated to clean up this ridiculous mess before he was. Although it was already too late, he recalled, for Hogwarts.</p><p>*****</p><p>In the coldest, wettest depths of Azkaban, a handful of prisoners clung to one another against the chill, and told one another stories in low voices. There were rules about the subterranean levels, where the dementors didn’t seem able to tread. New men didn’t get an invitation, unless they had or formed allies with the older set. The Leaders decided who was welcome, and the first criteria was the ability to do something sufficiently entertaining to pass the time. Because of the total darkness, that meant either singing or storytelling, ever since the ancient witch who knew enough wandless magic to feebly illuminate the air around the Leaders’ faces had finally died.</p><p>Peter was a good storyteller. Peter was good at anything, if he put his mind to it. Maybe not the best, but good. He could be a good wizard - he’d been an animagus by fifteen, after all - he could be a good student. He could be a good friend, and he could be a good spy.</p><p>He could not be the best at anything, but he’d been resigned to that fact since some time during his second year at Hogwarts. If he had been a little less intelligent, and never figured out his own limitations, he thought he would have had a happier life, if likely a briefer one.</p><p>It was strange, but even in the forgotten human storage container that was Azkaban, every spot of pleasant emotion hunted by monsters, perpetually cold and almost constantly blind, Peter couldn’t exactly regret being alive, or any of the choices that had ensured he would be.</p><p>Maybe he had finally found something he was better than good at. Many lost their will far earlier in their tenure, and threw themselves off the parapets and into the sea like stones. When they washed up on the sharp rocks of the craggy beach, the dementors would gather up a handful of prisoners to bury them.</p><p>The prisoners didn’t bother killing each other as a rule, though there was plenty of violence, and without healing magic the dismal conditions could spell death from a wound that wouldn’t be a serious concern for a free witch or wizard.</p><p>Peter was luckier than most. Long before he was officially welcomed in the underground, he could join the true rats in the tunnels that carried him there, rest in the shadows and hear the singing and the music. The dementors didn’t seem very interested in rats.</p><p>This day, or night, it was impossible to tell, the group sat close, shoulder to shoulder. Outside it had to be raining, because water was coursing around the edges of the chamber, slowly carving a deeper cavern out of the rock and soil. One day it would go below sea level and no one would be able to gather here any longer. Peter wondered if he would still be alive then, and forced to keep company with the rats more than he already did.</p><p>Peter told the story this time.</p><p>“Once there was a boy whose parents hated him on sight. They kept him in the attic like a squib, and the elves were his only caretakers, and his only source of food. For years he lived in the dark, dirty and alone, until the ghost of a squib ancestor was finally convinced to take pity on him, and opened a secret door to a passageway that could take him to any room in the house, through the walls.</p><p>“From inside the walls, he could hear and see everything. The walls were transparent when viewed from the inside out. So the boy watched his parents while they kissed and while they argued, when they had dinner guests and when they rose at midnight and went to sit in the dark kitchen and drink tea. He watched them read in silence. He watched the house when it was empty, too, though he didn’t leave the walls.</p><p>“Then the boy began to realize that something worse than a ghost was with them in the house. Doors slammed and the floor sometimes went soft and uneven, like a breathing hide. The windows sometimes shattered and the broken glass raced toward his parents’ faces. His father lost an eye this way.</p><p>“The presence didn’t ignore the boy, but it seemed fond of him. In the perfect darkness of his attic room, the boy couldn’t hope to see the beast, but he felt it there, beside him when he slept, emanating heat and smelling faintly of blood.</p><p>“The boy watched his parents grow drawn and ill, and waited for them to leave the house. He thought If the monster could scare them away he could leave the walls and live in the house, amongst the books he didn’t know to read and in the light that was too bright for his underdeveloped eyes. He imagined the softness of the beds and what it might feel like to be immersed in the perfumed hot water of a bath.</p><p>“As the boy grew more eager, the beast was bolder. It clawed the wallpaper from the walls, and shredded the books, silent and invisible. The figures vanished from every portrait in the house and the elves were mute and trembling, barely able to accomplish the most basic tasks.</p><p>“The boy’s parents called an expert at last, though they forbade him from entering the attic, and he poured a salt circle and called for ghosts, convinced they were the culprit. They came, the boy saw from the walls. But they were quiet and without malice, even the squib ancestor, who wasn’t asked so didn’t mention the boy she’d set loose in the walls.</p><p>“The next expert laid runes under the foundation and broke a curse that had kept three rooms in the house locked for three generations. But the curse breaker couldn’t touch the beast.</p><p>“Finally, when the parents were desperate, weak, and gaunt and the boy was sure they would soon give up, a third expert came, in silver-spangled black robes and a conical hat, face dark and wizened from a life in the desert. He spoke with a foreign tongue and when he gazed around the antechamber by the front door (for the floo had been temperamental since the beast first appeared) the boy felt the walls shrink back from him, compressing the boy in the process so that he could hardly breathe.</p><p>“The wizard knelt and put the palms of his hands on the floor, and for the first time, the beast made noise. A great wrenching howl came up from the stones in the cellar and down from the roof; every wall and door and window between rattled with it, and after a minute, the expert removed his hands. The house was quiet again, though it seemed to be shuddering all over, and the boy felt the beast near him, hot and coiled like an adder on the defensive.</p><p>“‘Your family is at war,’ said the expert, ‘and the house has chosen the side of the heir.’</p><p>“‘We have no heir,’ insisted the boy’s mother, but she couldn’t contain a glance toward the attic. Confused and disappointed by the expert’s answer, they sent him away and spoke furiously to one another, too softly for the boy to hear.</p><p>“He thought about the beast that was everywhere but couldn’t be seen, and thought suddenly that it wasn’t invisible at all—it <em>was</em> the house, each room in each level, and the attic chamber. The gap in the walls where the boy wandered through the days of his life. The secret lair where the elves slept. And it was on his side.</p><p>“The moment he realized that, the boy felt the beast—the house—become alert, like a dog that has heard its masters whistle and waits for a command.</p><p>“The boy had never had a moment of power in all his life, and his whole universe was the house. So in that moment, with the entire universe as he knew it, his to command, he was flooded with feeling but no sense of a goal—he felt only satisfied, and confident that what he wanted would come to be, and all he had ever wanted was—</p><p>“The boy realized that his parents were screaming. Their screams did not last, because the house had no interest in making them suffer, only in making them gone. From inside the walls, the blood and tissue and fragments of fabric from the robes they wore could not touch the boy, but because the walls were transparent he was suddenly seeing the room as though a red cast had been painted over his eyes. His parents were nothing but a wet mist settling over every surface in the room, which he observed without emotion for some time, until the elves appeared and cleaned carefully until all evidence of his parents had gone.</p><p>“The boy lived very comfortably after that. He curtained the windows, and the elves discarded what was left of the books. The boy bathed, and ate, and slept in a soft bed, and the house was his companion for the next hundred years of his long life.”</p><p>The crowd was quiet for a few minutes after Peter stopped talking, and then someone snorted. “Peter never tells a story about sunshine and happiness, does he?”</p><p>“That’s what Brown is for,” said someone else. They all laughed a little, even though most of them took a shy delight in Brown’s long and detailed descriptions of hot sunlight, flower gardens and delicious meals.</p><p>“Did you make that one up yourself, Peter?”</p><p>“No, he didn’t. I am sure I’ve heard it before.”</p><p>“It’s an old story,” Peter said quietly, looping his arms around his knees, smiling a fond smile that none of them could see. “A good friend told it to me.” It had been one of Lily’s favorites. He wondered if she was still interested in house magic, wherever she was.</p>
