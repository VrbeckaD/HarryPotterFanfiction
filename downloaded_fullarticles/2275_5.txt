    <p>Sirius had tried to spend Halloween forgetting that three of his friends were in hiding and the other might have sold them all out to Voldemort, but it wasn’t working. The Muggle gay clubs in Charing Cross were as far as he could possibly get from the war, but he couldn’t shake the itch that something was wrong. Nothing helped—not the alcohol or the loud music thrumming through his bones or the quickie with some nameless bloke in the bathroom. Eventually he had to admit defeat—but checking on Peter would help, surely? He could reassure himself that all was well, and either go back out or just surrender to sleep and hope November was better.</p><p>He shivered as he stood in the corridor outside Peter’s flat: clothes that had been comfortable in a mass of sweaty moving bodies were definitely not suited to the nippy October night. Peter didn’t answer when he knocked in the agreed two quick, three slow pattern. Sirius knocked again. The door didn’t look forced; nothing looked wrong at all from the outside. Nevertheless, Sirius had his wand out and his heart was beating too quickly as he unlocked the door and called out, “Wormtail?”</p><p>It was empty. The small, dingy flat still had signs of occupation—Peter had left the bed unmade, there was a mug next to the sink, various other things scattered across the floor and furniture he could see. Peter was not meant to leave the flat. Sirius brought him food and anything else he needed (in fact, Sirius was the only person Peter saw, since the rest of the Order was still under the impression Sirius was the Potters’ Secret-Keeper—but that was only temporary, he knew that, just for the first week or so, until they had a better idea of who to trust). There was no sign of a struggle, and Sirius felt something cold running down his back and pooling in his stomach. Something had gone horribly wrong.</p><p>He didn’t dare think about what he might be travelling towards as he flew on his bike from London to the West Country, because thinking it would make it real. He’d get to Godric’s Hollow and everything would be fine. He’d let James and Lily know that Peter was missing, but it would turn out that Peter had been just desperate to see anything but those four walls and would be back in the flat by morning. He’d be at the pub or visiting his mum. They would all laugh about it once it was over. They’d tease Sirius that he had overreacted and everything would be—</p><p>His stomach dropped when he saw the Dark Mark in the sky. He knew which house it would be over, and the minutes he had to spend flying towards it felt like time had stopped. His body belonged to someone else as he climbed off the bike and forgot to put the kickstand down, so it fell over when he let go. He didn’t hear it fall, too transfixed by the sight in front of him.</p><p>The sickly green glow gave off just enough to make the scene look unreal, the house lights having extinguished when the casters (the Potters, his <em>friends</em>) died. Part of the second storey had been destroyed by some kind of explosion, the new outline looking like an open wound, jagged and dangerous. The front door was open and Sirius didn't understand why until he tripped over something lying on the threshold and lit his wand, turning away in time to vomit into the pram they still kept by the door, despite never going out anymore.</p><p>James—the body of James—was holding the door open. Two years ago, he might have checked to see if he had just been stunned, but in the last twelve months he had seen enough dead bodies to know. He knew he should close James’s eyes, at least, or rearrange his body or <em>something</em>, but he couldn’t bear to look, so he moved further into the house instead. Vomiting hadn't helped the nausea at all and he swallowed back bile as he heard movement from upstairs, his wand out and stance changed before he consciously thought about doing it.</p><p>It was Hagrid, though, which was so unexpected Sirius just froze. He stood there, mouth slightly open, for a moment before Hagrid came downstairs and pulled him into a hug. He heard him mutter something about Sirius being white as a sheet and him being sorry and best friends and he just tuned it out and focused on the physical sensations of the hug because otherwise he was going to fall apart.</p><p>Even though he'd had time between seeing the Dark Mark from his motorbike and being crushed against the coat of a half-giant to consider the context of two of his best friends being dead, his brain had been filled with white noise and he hadn't thought of the <em>how</em>, considering there had been no sign of a struggle. The hug seemed to clear his brain somewhat and he had his mouth open to say he was off to kill Peter Pettigrew when there was a noise from upstairs.</p><p>"Ah, that'll be little Harry, then," said Hagrid, as if it was normal and established that small babies survived attacks that left accomplished wizards dead.</p><p>"Harry? He's still alive?" Sirius asked, brain still feeling like his thoughts were moving through treacle. He'd had it explained to him that it was Harry that Voldemort had been after, so he didn't understand how Voldemort had killed everyone <em>but</em> him.</p><p>"Yeah, Dumbledore said it was him that stopped him! You Know Who, I mean. Didn' explain how, an’ he just Apparated away ten minutes ago, 'spose ter do important stuff, but I'm here ter keep him safe an’ then deliver him ter—”</p><p>"Wait, I'm his legal guardian. I'm his godfather," Sirius said, and then backtracked, thinking he had misheard. "What do you mean stopped him?"</p><p>"You-Know-Who's gone, he blew up, I think. Dumbledore wasn' very clear, ter be honest. He did say tha' I had ter get Harry ter Surrey tomorrow, though."</p><p>"I—” He wanted to ask whether there was a body, whether they knew he was gone for good, whether that meant the war was over, but instead he concentrated on the baby he could now hear upstairs. “It's in Prongs'-- it's in James' will. He updated it before he went into hiding, if he and Lily die, I have custody of Harry. I can get you the notarised copy from the Ministry if you want. I’m taking him."</p><p>Something moved to Sirius’s left and he had his wand up again before he realised it was just the cat. Minerva (James thought it was hilarious; Lily thought it was disrespectful, and tried to just refer to ‘the cat’, but he had heard her refer to ‘Minnie’ when she thought nobody was listening) rubbed against his calf, twisting through his legs to scent-mark him more thoroughly. Sirius lowered his wand and tried to focus for a moment on the familiar feeling: if not for the cold breeze whistling through the open door, this could be any time in the Potters’ house when Minnie decided that the best way to show her affection was to make it as difficult as possible for him to move without falling flat on his face. It didn’t work—the wind made him shiver and there was the faint smell of something burnt on the air.</p><p>Hagrid looked like he had not expected this challenge to Dumbledore's authority, which, well...Sirius thought that Dumbledore's authority rarely got questioned. But Harry was all Sirius had left—all that was left of Lily and James. James' ridiculous hair, even now, and Lily's eyes. Sirius couldn't have that taken away from him too, not by Dumbledore—Dumbledore had suggested the Fidelius Charm, and it had failed, and it was Dumbledore's fault they had died, and Dumbledore—why would Dumbledore know better than Sirius what was right for Harry? Sirius hadn't raised a baby, but as far as he knew neither had Dumbledore, and at least he had <em>known</em> James and Lily, known them properly.</p><p>"I think I should still bring him ter Dumbledore—he has a plan for him, got him a place ter stay, I'm sure he's got it all worked out," Hagrid said, and if he sounded a little uncertain to Sirius's ears, it might have just been wishful thinking.</p><p>"I'm not leaving him to Dumbledore." Sirius knew he should trust Dumbledore—and yet there was something he couldn't place, some instinct that told him the speed with which he had organised this was suspicious. How long could it have been since Voldemort had murdered Lily and James? Hours? Had he known it would happen? And where was he taking him? Sirius didn't live in Surrey, nor did anyone he knew. Minerva realised she was not getting the kind of attention she desired and wandered off into the kitchen.</p><p>Hagrid looked uncertain and there was an uncomfortable silence between them for a few moments before Harry cried and they both started for the stairs.</p><p>"I've got it," Sirius said as he ducked under Hagrid's broad arm and turned towards Harry’s room, picking his way through some rubble because the explosion that had ripped through the house seemed to have come from the nursery. He stopped at the doorway. One of the walls was missing completely, blown outwards, making the room much colder than it had been downstairs. Lily's body had fallen in front of the cot, as if—he crouched and closed Lily's eyes, putting a hand against her cheek for a moment as Harry quieted at the sight of him. Even if his stomach turned just at the thought of doing the same for James downstairs, he could give Lily this respect.</p><p>Voldemort's body wasn't there, and Sirius didn't know whether he wanted to kick Voldemort's corpse in the face or if he was glad it was absent. After an age he stood up, picking Harry up out of his cot and turning towards the door where Hagrid was watching, tears rolling down his face and into his beard. "I'm Harry's guardian," Sirius said, Harry on his hip, "but if you want I will come with you to Dumbledore to tell him what I think of his <em>plan</em>." Harry was usually pulling at his hair by now (Lily had always laughed at him when it happened), but he seemed to just be patting at it. Sirius tried not to let it worry him.</p><p>Hagrid sagged a little and nodded, holding his hands out for Harry, but Sirius didn't hand him over.</p><p>"What about James and Lily?" Sirius said as he found a bag and started looking through drawers, packing nappies and onesies and grabbing the blanket and the toys out of the cot. The broom he had bought Harry just a few months ago was against the wall and he hesitated before packing that too, trying not to think about it.</p><p>"I don' know, I was only told ter take care of Harry an’ bring him ter Surrey tomorrow night," Hagrid said, shaking his head. "I guess someone'll come collect them?"</p><p>Sirius knew that Harry was alive and needed him more than Lily and James but he didn't want to leave his best friends, their ruined house, and he resolved to find someone to send their bodies to the morgue at St Mungo's. He'd organise Order members to salvage their belongings, and he didn't know how they would protect the scene from Muggles, but they had a few hours before anyone woke up. At least it wasn’t raining.</p><p>There were plastic containers of food in the fridge, neatly labelled in Lily’s handwriting, though Sirius knew James had cooked them. He packed them, too, hoping they were things Harry would eat. Minnie reappeared, and Sirius realised they would have to take her as well—she had done nothing to deserve a life on the streets or in the pound. Her carrier was in the living room and she mercifully went inside without argument. Sirius tried not to think that she knew there was nothing left for her here.</p><p>"I don't know whether it's safe to Apparate with a baby—I don't know if I even can Apparate right now," Sirius said, "so we can take my bike, and we'll stop at the Longbottoms on the way, I need to tell them to...to send Prongs and Lily to the morgue and get their belongings and secure the scene so the Muggles won't start investigating it." He waited until Hagrid nodded before saying, "You can drive, I'll just transfigure a sidecar, I won't fit behind you."</p><p>It took him three tries before he could create a serviceable sidecar from Lily’s least favourite garden gnome, too shaken, but he managed something that would do and strapped himself in, holding Harry against his chest and tucking him under his jacket. The bag he had packed was in the sidecar’s tiny boot, but Minnie was at his feet—he didn’t want her seeing how high up they were, but he didn’t have the heart to shut her up in the pitch-black without any idea what was going on.</p><p>As they rose into the sky, using the cover of darkness since the cloaking spells didn't cover the sidecar, Sirius felt a sound that wasn't really a laugh come out of his throat, jagged and harsh. Lily had always joked that the bike was his child just as Harry was theirs, and he never let anyone else drive it. Yet here they were.</p><p>Harry fell asleep as they were flying over Bristol, following the motorway.</p>
