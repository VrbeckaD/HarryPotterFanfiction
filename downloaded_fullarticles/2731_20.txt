    <p>Ever since he was small, Newt had heard the stories from his parents and relatives about how them meet the person they were meant to spend their life with. Their one and only soulmate. He had seen his parents marks so many times, he had been told that he would meet his own when he it was time. Newt had not thought that it would happen when he was only 10 years old. They had travelled to America do to his fathers work that summer, why was something Newt didn’t really know. All he knew was that he missed the open space and nature at home. As his father was on a meeting, his mother had taken him and his brother to the zoo.</p><p>He was looking around himself at the poor animals in the zoo, he felt really sorry for them. The cages were small and none of the animals looked happy to be there. He had managed to sneak away when his mother and brother were looking away and had found his way towards one of the back doors. He was smiling big as he reached up for the door that would lead him into one of the cages. “You shouldn’t do that.” A voice had said behind him and in the moment that followed, Newt could feel how something was burning on his forearm. Quickly turning around he could see a small group of people walking away but he had no chance on seeing who they were.</p><p>Rubbing his forearm where it had burned, Newt returns back to his mothers and brothers side. It wasn’t until evening when Newt found out why his forearm had been hurting. As he was getting ready for bed he could see the line that had been spoken to him shining a bit. Looking at it in surprise, he quickly covered his arm up when he heard someone walking passed his room. How was he going to tell his parents or anyone else for that madder that he had found his soulmate but he had no idea of who this person was or that it had happened back in America.</p><p>Now years later, Newt finds himself on a boat heading for America. To be more correct he was heading for Arizona, the boat were stopping in New York. He had only one thing in his mind, find his way to Arizona so that he could finally let Frank fly free, to give the Thunderbird the chance he should have had from the start. Feeling how his case were moving in his lap, Newt leans towards it. “Dougal – you settle down now, please. It won’t be long.” He whispered to the case and he could hear a faint sound coming from the Demiguise. Looking up once more, Newt could see how they were growing closer towards land.</p><p>Keeping back, Newt let the Muggles around him leave the boat before he himself starts to walk down the plank to join one of the long lines. It was moving slowly forwards and Newt started to get worried and his grip around the case got harder. “Next!” The customs official calls out and Newt steps forwards and he hands over his passport. “British, huh?” The man in front of him asked and Newt nods his head, lowering his eyes in the progress. “Yes.” He managed to get out. “First trip to New Work?” The man asked and Newt nods his head once more. “No.” He told him.</p><p>“Anything edible in there?” The man then asked, nodding his head towards his case and Newt puts a hand on his breast pocket. “No.” He said carefully, feeling how he was getting more and more nervous once more. “Livestocks?” The man asks once more, in that moment the catch on the case flicks open. Newt looks down and hastily closes it. “Must get that fixed –“ Newt said, trying to lighten up the air. “Ah, no.” He then answered the question that had been asked.</p><p>The Customs official looks at him in suspicious. “Let me take a look.” The man told him shortly and Newt looks at him. He carefully places the case on the desk between them and discreetly flocks the brass dial to ‘Muggleworthy’. The customs official spins the case towards him and pops the catches, lifting the lid to reveal pyjamas, carious maps, a journal, an alarm clock, a magnifying glass and a Hufflepuff scarf. Finally satisfied he closes the case. “Welcome to New York.” He then tells Newt who nods his head at that. “Thank you.” He said, gathering his passport and case one more. “Next!” The man calls out just as Newt steps away from the desk.</p><p>Once he was passed the customs, the British wizard takes a deep breath as he tries to calm down his beating heart. He already knew there wouldn’t be much problem getting through the Muggle customs, that didn’t mean that he could be a tiny bit nervous of getting through them. He had a permit for his case, he had too have one with the work he was doing. But he didn’t have the right type of permits for the creatures he had inside the case and it was easier to lure the Muggles then his fellow Witches and Wizards. With another deep breath he starts to walk down the road of New York. </p><p>He kept looking around himself as he were walking, eye big as he looked at the big houses all around him. It was a different sight from home, it was a different sight from the last time he had been in the city. But then again, he didn’t get to see so much of the city last time either and if everything went according to his plan he would not bee in New York long enough to get to know the city. People were hurrying past him, all of them in need to be somewhere and fast and Newt takes a step to the side to make sure he wasn’t in their way. Reaching a large building soon enough made him look up, a big crowd had gathered in front of the massive stairs and he could see how a woman were talking to the people in front of her.</p><p>Curiosity took over and Newt slowly moves towards the group, now hearing what the woman were talking about.  Slowing down, Newt kept a close eye on the woman as he were walking. Forgetting that he was walking in a big group made him walk right into a woman with her hat pulled down and upturned collar. “Oh…. So sorry.” Newt told her as he realized what he was doing, glancing towards the woman he could see how her big eyes grows big before he continued to walk forward.</p>
