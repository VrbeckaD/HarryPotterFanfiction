    <p>Harry caught the Knightbus to Diagon alley, and decided to take a look at the shops in Knockturn. He made his way into Borgin &amp; Burkes first, browsing through the wide array of items on display. He brushed his hand along a full length mirror, and smiled when an excited Shadow stepped out.</p><p>He was looking at a particularly expensive amulet seated on a velvet cushion, when he heard the doorbell clang and Draco stepped into the shop. He was going about to go up to meet him, when a man followed behind.</p><p>He had Draco's pointed face and grey eyes. Lucius Malfoy, Draco Malfoy's father and a death eater. He eyed the shelves lazily and drawled out a command for Draco.<br/>
“Touch nothing” Draco turned to his father and scowled.<br/>
“I thought you were going to buy me a present.”<br/>
“I promised to buy you a racing broom.”</p><p>“What’s the good of that if I’m not in the house team?” said Malfoy, looking sulky.<br/>
<em>‘Aww, he's jealous. This year will be different though</em>.’<br/>
“Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor. He’s not even that good, it’s just because he’s famous … famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead …”<br/>
<em>‘Is he badmouthing me? And lying to his father</em>?’</p><p>Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.<br/>
“… everyone thinks he’s so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick –”<br/>
“You have told me this at least a dozen times already.” Said Mr Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son,<br/>
“Really? How rude, Draco! And I was just beginning to like you.” Shadow walked up to the Malfoy's shaking her head and tsking. “And after poor Harry was kind enough to gift you his broom!” Draco couldn't resist laughing.</p><p>“He only gave me his broom to get out of Quidditch! But what are you doing here? I assume Harry is around somewhere.”<br/>
“We're meeting up with the twins later today, and thought we'd come browse for a bit, see if anything catches our fancy.”</p><p>Mr Malfoy looked extremely suspicious.<br/>
“Draco, who is this?” Draco, suddenly remembering his dad, blanched. He glared at Hermione and turned to his dad.<br/>
“Um, father, this is Hermione… she's a student at Hogwarts, and friends with Harry Potter.” A single one of Mr Malfoy's eyebrows rose.<br/>
“You seem to know her well. Why haven't I heard about her?”<br/>
“Well Mr Malfoy, I'd say it's cos I'm registered as a muggleborn, I'm friends with Harry, and I'm a Gryffindor. Your family ain't too keen on us.”<br/>
“Oh Hermione, that's cute and all, but I just think that Draco doesn't like you enough to tell his family.” Harry approached the trio, hands in his pockets.</p><p>“What bollocks! Draco thinks I'm awesome, don't you Dracey Wacey?” Draco closed his eyes and sighed in defeat.<br/>
“Please don't ever call me that again.” Mr Malfoy looked like stone.<br/>
“I think you should explain.” Draco grimaced.<br/>
“I will, later.”<br/>
“Meet us at Gringotts, that's where we're meeting the twins.” Harry and Hermione waved to the Malfoy's and left, leaving a pale son standing next to his expressionless father.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“Lo Harry!”<br/>
“Lo Hermione!” The twins called out loudly, waving and smiling.<br/>
“Hello boys! Hope you don't mind, Draco will be joining us for a little while.”<br/>
“Oh? Draco's here? Where'd ya find him?”<br/>
“He was shopping with his dad in Knockturn.” The twins expressions turned to shock and awe.<br/>
“You guys got to go down Knockturn?”<br/>
“Wicked! We're never allowed down there.”</p><p>They all chatted for a while, waiting for Draco to show up. When he finally showed up with his father who was still expressionless, the twins mobbed him.<br/>
“Hello Draco! You're looking wonderful!”<br/>
“That you are! We were wondering, dear friend,”<br/>
“There are some things we can only get from Knockturn,”<br/>
“but alas, we aren't allowed down there,”<br/>
“so we hoped you would be able to get us some?”<br/>
“pretty please Draco, we promise not to prank Snape for at least three weeks.”<br/>
“three weeks, brother!? We only agreed on two!”<br/>
“desperate times call for desperate measures.”</p><p>They turned to Draco and spoke in chorus.<br/>
“So, how about it?” Draco grinned genuinely.<br/>
“No way. You don't prank Professor Snape anyway. If I agree to this I'm liable to wake up as a bird.”<br/>
“No need to fear, Draco!”<br/>
“the only thing we have that can turn you into a bird must be eaten!” before Draco could carry on with his banter, his father interrupted.</p><p>“I would like to make sure I understand. You four have become friends with Draco?”<br/>
“We have.” Harry spoke this time. “You will hear from other students that we adamantly hate each other, but all our arguments and insults are in good fun. The only student we really dislike is Ronald Weasley.”<br/>
Mr Malfoy shot a look at the twins who were nodding in agreement.</p><p>“Is that right.” It wasn't a question.<br/>
“It is, Mr Malfoy sir. He's gotten really insufferable lately.”<br/>
“We've tried talking to our parents, but Dad is totally oblivious, and Mum's proud of him.”<br/>
“He told Professor McGonagall that Harry, Hagrid, and Hermione had a dragon!”<br/>
“Well, to be fair we did kind of have a dragon.” Hermione looked sort of smug.<br/>
“Imagine if we'd had a Basilisk!”</p><p>The twins grinned.<br/>
“We know that tone! I don't think we'll need to imagine.” despite Draco's earlier explanation, Mr Malfoy's eyes conveyed his confusion. Harry could only smile.<br/>
<em>‘I wasn't kidding about a Basilisk, you know. They're really easy to breed, and we already have a dragon and a cerberus. What's another dangerous creature</em>?’</p><p>The group of five headed off to Flourish &amp; Blotts to pick up their new books, most of which were written by Gilderoy Lockhart. While Harry, Hermione, Draco, and the twins all laughed and chatted, Mr Malfoy trailed behind, obviously wanting to keep an eye on them.</p><p>When they finally made it to the store, they found it surrounded by a massive mob of people. A large banner spread across the front of Flourish &amp; Blotts proclaimed a book signing by Gilderoy Lockhart.</p><p>Hermione turned to the group and smiled sweetly.<br/>
“So who wants to be the sacrificial lamb?”<br/>
“We aren't going in there.” The twins looked stubborn. Harry walked up to Hermione, put his hands on her shoulders, turned her around, and gave her a little push.<br/>
“Go ahead.”<br/>
Hermione scowled, grabbed Harry's hand and started dragging him with her.</p><p>They tried to push their way inside, but only drew Lockharts attention. He leapt to his feet and shouted<br/>
“That can't be harry Potter?” the crowd parted, whispering excitedly. Lockhart dived forward, seized Harry’s arm and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into applause.</p><p>Harry smiled charmingly as Lockhart shook his hand. The photographer clicked away frantically, knowing the opportunity he was getting.</p><p>“Wonderful Harry,” said Lockhart, through his blinding teeth. “together, you and I are worth the front page.” Harry's smile turned slightly cunning as he spoke loudly.<br/>
“It's really wonderful to meet you, Mr Lockhart, sir! I've read all of your books, and I think they're wonderful! Did you really do all those amazing things?”<br/>
“Of course, Harry! Of course!” at this, the crowd applauded even louder.</p><p>When he finally let go of Harry’s hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers. He tried to sidle away, but Lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side.</p><p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said loudly, waving for quiet. “What an extraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I’ve been sitting on for some time! When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography – which I shall be happy to present him now, free of charge –” the crowd applauded again, especially taken by Harry's simpering look</p><p>“– he had no idea,” Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, “that he would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, Magical Me. He and his school fellows will, in fact, be getting the real, magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that, this September, I will be taking up the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!”</p><p>The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering slightly under their weight, Harry made his way outside.</p><p>Unfortunately, as soon as he and a hysterically laughing Hermione got back to their group, they were approached by the Weasel. Hermione's laugh turned to a giggle, and Harry decided to sit back and watch.<br/>
“Oooh hello little Weasel! Come to get your nose busted again? I'm sorry, I've moved on from that. I've decided to start aiming lower.”</p><p>“Don't sound so confident, Granger! You're just a filthy mudblood hanging out with the strongest people she could find. How many of then are you screwing?”<br/>
Hermione's laugh increased in volume, and she spoke in a sing-song voice.<br/>
“Little muggle-lover said the M-word! Is that why you're considered a ‘blood traitor’? Can't even stick to your own values.” she tsked.<br/>
“And implying that Mr Malfoy is unfaithful? Placing your father in some very hot water there!”</p><p>It didn't take long for the rest of the Weasley family to show up, and the fight escalated. Harry finally got to meet Molly Weasley, Arthur Weasley, and Ginny Weasley. The first impressions they made weren't good.</p><p>Mr Weasley immediately became openly hostile, and Mrs Weasley egged him on. Ginny Weasley, just stared at Harry, blushing. It eventually took Hagrid to break up the fight, and they all parted ways, but not before Harry spotted Mr Malfoy slipping a book into Ginny's cauldron.</p>
