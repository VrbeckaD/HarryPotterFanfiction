  <b>Chapter 1</b>
</p><p align="justify">“It’s my pleasure to announce that Hogwarts has been chosen to host the Triwizard Tournament this year!”</p><p align="justify">Minako-sensei’s –– as she demanded everyone to call her –– amplified voice filled the grand dining hall, echoing in Yuuri’s ears like a nightmare he couldn’t quite remember yet left him shaken. He tried his best to sink lower in his seat and avoided eye contact with everyone around him. It had been three years, three years of wallowing in self-pity and misery. Three years of doing his absolute best to put the past behind him and overcome his weakness. Three years of experimenting with magic and pushing himself beyond his own limits. The shiny scars curling up his arms were apt reminders of how much he had sacrificed to prove himself.</p><p align="justify">For nothing.</p><p align="justify">He was still average at best, his talents lying in things everyone could do if they tried, maybe better and faster than Yuuri had managed. But it was fine. After all, he had only one year left and it wasn’t like he wanted to compete this time around. He had learned from his mistakes and would not repeat them again.</p><p align="justify">A finger poked him on the shoulder, then again and again, making him turn and look at a shock of red and gold colored hair that was obscuring a pair of huge, doe like eyes. Yuuri blinked, mouth going slack for a second. He did not remember anyone sitting next to him.</p><p align="justify">“Yuuri-senpai,” Minami said, his smile wide and hopeful, “you’re signing up for the delegation, right? You have to!”</p><p align="justify">“I…” Words stuck in his throat, and he had to avert his gaze to get away from that look of unabashed eagerness. How could he say no without crushing Minami’s expectations? It wasn’t like Minami would understand his reasoning, Yuuri himself didn’t really understand it most of the time. He just knew he couldn’t do it.</p><p align="justify">He shook his head, lips pressed together, silently willing Minami to drop the topic. Sadly, Yuuri’s legilimency skills were nonexistent and Minami was like a dog that had found a juicy, giant bone; he refused to let it drop.</p><p align="justify">“Is that a yes? Please, you have to, Yuuri-senpai, you are the best and you would be the perfect Champion our school could ask for!” he rambled, all chipper and completely oblivious. Yuuri closed his eyes and carefully ignored Seung-Gil’s derisive snort.</p><p align="justify">“Minami-kun,” he said, quietly urging the boy to shut up.</p><p align="justify">“Yes? Did you know that I’m planning to sign up too? I mean, I know my robes are only pale orange, but I’m already fifteen and it’s such a great opportunity! And I want to cheer you on while you compete even if I––”</p><p align="justify">“Kenjiro, the headmistress is still speaking, would you kindly shut up?” Seung-Gil cut in, his tone cold. Yuuri sent him a grateful look, but the other boy was looking at Minako-sensei, completely ignoring him and Minami’s sulky huff both.</p><p align="justify">“––the delegation will be appointed by the faculty based on academic and interpersonal skills, while the remaining ten spots will be filled by volunteers. However, I advise you to take the responsibilities and consequences of upholding our school’s image into consideration before you decide to sign up for the journey,” she said.</p><p align="justify">Her voice was cheerful as always, layered with that silky steel severeness that made her students both respect and fear her in equal measures. Her sharp gaze was staring down at them all, daring anyone to react inappropriately to her warning. Everyone was quiet. “Further information will be provided by your homeroom teachers tomorrow morning before breakfast. Do not pester them until then. Now, with that out of the way, all that remains is to wish you all an educational and productive school year, whether you spend it at Hogwarts or here at Mahoutokoro. Dig in!”</p><p align="justify">“Yuuri-senpai,” Minami piped up with a china pot held carefully in his hands, “tea?”</p><p align="justify">“Thank you, Minami-kun,” Yuuri replied, trying to smile at the boy encouragingly.</p><p align="justify">He had no idea why Minami was so devoted to him. He was such a lively person, full of optimism and kindness. He worked hard and Yuuri just knew that he had a bright future ahead of him. Minami did not have to resort to using second rate tricks to be able to live up to the standards expected of them, and looking down at the scar on the back of his left hand, barely visible thanks to the length of the sleeves on his robes, he was thankful for that.</p><p align="justify">“Are you looking forward to your new classes?” he asked after taking a sip. That should be a safe enough topic.</p><p align="justify">“Oh, definitely! I already start on all of the books we are going to use this year and it’s all so exciting!” Minami gushed, his chopsticks clutched close to his chest. “I need to work on my transfiguration skills and I’m really not good at Arithmancy, because numbers and equations elude me, but I really hope by time spring term ends my robes will turn dark orange.”</p><p align="justify">Yuuri’s lips curled up at that. Minami’s ambitiousness was admirable, and he had little doubt that the boy would get what he wanted. Minami was looking at Yuuri’s robes, eyeing the shimmery silver color with determination. It made Yuuri want to shrink back, but there was nowhere to hide in the crowded hall. He patted Minami’s shoulder awkwardly, then decided maybe it would better to concentrate on getting some food on his plate. Fortunately, one of Minami’s classmates drew Minami’s attention away from him, leaving Yuuri to eat in peace.</p><p align="justify">He did not expect to be chosen for the delegation. Being an average wizard at best should ensure his safety from being pushed into the limelight, and as he had decided not to sign up himself, he was almost sure he would have a quiet, hopefully productive last year that would allow him to prepare to present his final project and get ready for the five International Sorcerer’s Undertakings, or ISUs for short, he decided to take.</p><p align="justify">If nothing else, his project was going well. Maybe the approach was unorthodox and needed more than a little fine-honing before it could be called anywhere close to be finished, but experimenting with his own body and magic had had at least one good thing coming out of it. Not that someone else couldn’t have thought of it of course, but no one seemed to have before, so it was an unique enough of an idea to present it to the examination board next March. If only he could figure how to replace fire with something less damaging…</p><p align="justify">Someone jostling his arm brought him back to the present. The girl next to him blushed scarlet and stuttered around an apology that Yuuri waved away with a smile. For some reason, it only made the girl blush more and suddenly turn away without saying anything else. Nishigori snickered next to Seung-Gil, sending Yuuri an exaggerated wink, which Yuuri answered with an eyeroll, his gaze catching on the gleaming white gold band on Nishigori’s right ring finger.</p><p align="justify">“Did you propose to Yuuko?” he found himself asking his classmate, eyes widening. Nishigori grinned proudly, looking down at his ring for a second as if checking whether it was real. It was an oddly intimate moment, something Yuuri did not expect from the usually rakish boy he had known since they were seven.</p><p align="justify">“Yes!” Nishigori replied with an eager nod and thrusted his hand out to show off his ring. Seung-Gil glared at the appendage blocking him from his meal, but Yuuri did the polite thing and admired the simple yet beautiful piece of jewelry as expected. “My mother was all weepy during the yuinou ceremony which got Yuuko’s mother going as well, although between the two of us? I think they were crying over the amount of money they had to pay for the whole fanfare.”</p><p align="justify">Yuuri’s lips twitched even as someone gasped in outrage at Nishigori’s careless words. Not that Nishigori paid any attention to anyone besides Yuuri at that moment. “Well, as long as Yuuko is happy...”</p><p align="justify">“She totally agrees with me, you know. She went along with it because of our parents, but what she really wanted was going to the beach and celebrate our engagement in private. If you know what I mean.”</p><p align="justify">The obscene wink was back, causing Yuuri to snort. He might be inept at social traditions and only knew what kissing someone felt like from Yuuko’s tales, but he was not blind or stupid. And whatever their society liked to think about traditions, they lived in the 21st century and were heavily influenced by the Mahoukanai.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sure Yuuko would be furious if she knew you are talking so freely about your private life.”</p><p align="justify">“Whatever.” Nishigori shrugged, but his cheeks flushed. “I’m just happy she said yes.”</p><p align="justify">“Congratulations on your engagement, Nishigori-senpai!” Minami piped up happily, receiving a wide grin in return. “You are really lucky.”</p><p align="justify">“Thanks, kid, I know.” It was a rare moment of self-deprecation that reassured Yuuri that Yuuko would receive the devotion and love she deserved.</p><p align="justify">“Are you signing up for the Triwizard delegation, senpai?” Minami was back on topic, but this time Nishigori was his target. Then again, from what Yuuri could hear, almost everyone around them was talking about the upcoming tournament next term. And who could fault them?</p><p align="justify">The last time the tournament was held, Victor Nikiforov, Koldovstoretz’s Champion, set a new record defending his title, which was unheard of even before the age restriction was first raised to seventeen, then lowered to fifteen when a new contract had been drawn between the magical schools that give Ilvermorny, Mahoutokoro and Koldovstoretz the right to participate in the tournament with their own champions. Victor had been the first fifteen year old to be legally chosen as a champion and he made winning look so easy that three years later, everyone wanted to do the same.</p><p align="justify">Yuuri had been one of them. He wished he hadn’t been.</p><p align="justify">Nishigori, though, looked much less bitter, his smile turning rueful as he shook his head. “Can’t,” he said. “I cannot give up my place on the team for half a year and wouldn’t anyway. The Tengu comes first.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, I understand.” Minami nodded. “If I were as talented as you in Quidditch I would think twice about signing up.”</p><p align="justify">“You’re laying it on thick, kid, that’s for sure,” Nishigori replied with a chuckle. “But seriously, I’m a twelfth year and my robes are still only bronze, I know where my talents lie.”</p><p align="justify">“But bronze is great!”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, if you are a tenth year, maybe.”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t let people hear you, Nishigori,” Seung-Gil interjected with a sneer. “The majority of upperclassmen are proud of their bronze robes.”</p><p align="justify">“More like they are trying to sell that they are proud of it, when in reality they are dying to get even just a shade closer to gray.” He cut a pointed glance at Seung-Gil’s charcoal robes then looked back at his own bronze ones.</p><p align="justify">Seung-Gil didn’t comment on that, his pursed lips a flash before his head bowed to face his plate, but the tips of his rosy ears peeking out from his mop of black hair spoke for him. Nishigori smirked, triumphant and smug over his victory against the younger boy. Yuuri smiled into his fresh cup of tea, refilled by Minami, and decided to put everything related to the Triwizard Tournament on the backburner for awhile and just enjoy the rest of his first night back to the school.</p><p align="justify">By the time he got into bed that night, the nagging thorns of worry had loosened a bit and he was lulled into sleep by Nishigori’s muffled snoring, hoping for a good year.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Their class was small. Well, to be fair, Mahoutokoro had the smallest student body in the entire Magical World, but Yuuri’s class was made up of only seventeen students, most of whom looked less than eager to listen to their homeroom teacher tell them about whatever rules the Board of Directors had come up with to ensure the school’s delegation would uphold the refined and superior image of Mahoutokoro.</p><p align="justify">Yuuri, still little more than half-asleep, had the fleeting thought that the whole thing was stupid. Their high and mighty attitude was such a farce. Yes, his schoolmates were competitive and did their best to achieve the greatness expected from them, but most of the times they failed to measure up to the insane expectations placed onto their shoulders. Their knees buckled and they sank into the muddy pits of oblivion, taking on high standing but still regular jobs instead of bringing great change to their world.</p><p align="justify">Maybe he was being unfair. Healers, aurors, politicians and potion makers were all needed and respected. They received the necessary recognition even if most of the time they were taken for granted, but they were not what Mahoutokoro expected from her students. What she wanted was revolution and worldwide admiration and awe, the same attention the Tengus got after winning the World Champions League for the third time in a row.</p><p align="justify">Unfortunately, aside from a copious amounts of theory the students had to swallow and integrate into their very core, Mahoutokoro did not offer anything revolutionary in her curricula. Yes, children started much earlier than in any other school, and they were expected to create a new spell on their own by the end of their twelfth year, but that was all the difference between Mahoutokoro and the other schools in the Magical World.</p><p align="justify">It had been obvious at the last Triwizard Tournament, and the way their school’s champion only had been fourth behind Koldovstoretz, Bauxbatons and Ilvermorny. Touting their own horns in a falsely humbled way and putting the students under more duress wouldn’t change facts, and if the pinched look on his homeroom teacher’s face was anything to go by, she had the same idea as she looked at them all.</p><p align="justify">“Look,” she started, “I know that whatever the headmistress might think, at least half of you could never be bothered to sign up for the Triwizard Tournament. Unfortunately, Minako-sensei and the Board of Directors have their own ideas on how things are supposed to go, which means that every twelfth year student with Titanium and up robes are automatically selected to the part of our delegation. Only the members of the Quidditch team are exempted.” She looked at Hayano and Shibutani.</p><p align="justify">“What about signing up?” Kayako asked, bathrobe clad arms folded across her chest.</p><p align="justify">“Anyone with Fire and up can put their name down, however, I highly advise all of you who wear lower level colored robes to think twice before signing up. Once your name is in the roster you cannot change your mind and if you are selected you are expected to uphold the traditions and values of our institute.” It would have been effective if her tone hadn’t been deadpan and she hadn’t read every word from the parchment in her hands.</p><p align="justify">“What if someone qualifies for mandatory participation but doesn’t want to do it?” Yuuri’s eyes shot to Mao, whose soft features were contorted into an unfriendly sneer. She was wearing her Mercury robes already, hair done up in a nice bun. Yuuri had never been more grateful to her.</p><p align="justify">“I’m afraid that is not an option.” Their teacher did sound apologetic, but at least she did not look at Yuuri as she said this, saving him from the humiliation of everyone’s unwanted attention. “I’m sure I don’t need to stress how important it is to present a respectable and united image to the other schools. Having our top students lead our delegation is a must.”</p><p align="justify">“We could put you on the team for this season?” Nishigori offered, not even trying to stifle the yawn stretching his mouth wide. Mao shook her head with a small smile in response.</p><p align="justify">“Thank you, but I’m no coward,” she said primly. The words rolled around in Yuuri’s head like heavy stones. “Any extra training we are supposed to go through before we leave for Hogwarts?”</p><p align="justify">“All candidates receive the standard training organized specifically to meet the tournament’s requirements. Entering the competition on a whim is not acceptable and won’t be tolerated.”</p><p align="justify">Yuuri sank low in his armchair, his eyes darting around for any sign of someone looking back at him. Kim-sensei was pointedly not looking at him, but he received the message loud and clear. He knew there was no way he would ever live down what happened three years ago and now here was the proof he had been waiting for since Minako-sensei first uttered ‘Triwizard Tournament’ last night.</p><p align="justify">There were a few more questions asked, none of which Yuuri paid the slightest bit of attention to. His thoughts were picked up by a black whorl and scrambled beyond recognition. He had to face the Goblet of Fire again. He had to do the very thing he vowed never to repeat. He didn’t have a choice. No way out of it…</p><p align="justify">His fingers were white as they clutched at the soft fabric of his night robe. His eyes were unseeing, his awareness devoured by mind-numbing terror. He couldn’t accept what he just heard as the truth. Just no. There had to be a way. Maybe, due to his past indiscretion, he would be deemed unfit to be part of Mahoutokoro’s esteemed delegation. The thought gave him pause, barely noticing that Kim-sensei was bowing her head and getting ready to leave. He stood up and returned the motion alongside his classmates, the response automatic and ingrained in his bones even when his thoughts were a million miles away.</p><p align="justify">Making plans had never been his forte, but the chance to find a way out of the impending mess gave him a sliver of hope that he could do it. Talking to his homeroom teacher would be useless. The decision was not up to her ultimately, and after everything Yuuri was still one of Minako-sensei’s favored students. If he weren’t, he would have been expelled three years ago. Using the right words with Minako-sensei could make all the difference he needed. And then he could graduate in peace and go home to his family and live out the ordinary life he was destined to.</p><p align="justify">Nishigori flicked him on the forehead, making Yuuri blink up at him with a most probably dumb expression and getting a cheeky grin in return. “Come on, you gotta get dressed. Mr. Future Champion or not, breakfast waits for no one.”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t call me that,” Yuuri protested weakly, tasting bile in the back of his throat even if he knew that Nishigori meant nothing bad by calling him that name.</p><p align="justify">“You need to lighten up, Katsuki, or you’re gonna get an aneurysm from all the stress you put yourself under.”</p><p align="justify">“I didn’t know you knew the word aneurysm.”</p><p align="justify">“Fuck off, I know a lot of words.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, I bet half of them are variations of Yuuko’s name.”</p><p align="justify">“No need to be bitter over being too much of a wuss to ask her out before I got there.” Yuuri rolled his eyes at that statement.</p><p align="justify">“Yuuko is my childhood friend. I never wanted to ask her out,” he replied evenly, staring right back into Nishigori’s challenging gaze. “And she would be pissed if she heard you talk about her like she was a prize to win.”</p><p align="justify">“Whatever, my Yuuko knows I would do anything for her,” Nishigori stated proudly, chest pushed out, head held high. “Can you say the same for your darling V–-”</p><p align="justify">“Would you two stop your old married couple routine and get ready? Classes start soon,” Mao-san cut in, her tone sharp. “Katsuki-san, Kim-sensei posted the schedule for extra training on the board, make sure you don’t forget to check it.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, thank you, Mao-san,” Yuuri answered, nodding his understanding. He averted his eyes and headed for the stairs after a quick bow, giving the board as large of a berth as he could.</p><p align="justify">“You know no one cares about your little stunt last time, right?” He heard Nishigori’s voice a little while later. Yuuri was in the middle of getting changed into his uniform, struggling to put on his undershirt. He thought about staying like that, with his head hidden by the shirt’s material to avoid the conversation, but he knew it would be useless. Nishigori tended to be like a bull and crashed through everything in his quest to get what he wanted. Maybe that was why he was such a great Chaser.</p><p align="justify">“I care,” Yuuri replied looking at his still naked feet. “I made a complete fool out of myself and brought shame to our school.”</p><p align="justify">“You’re an idiot,” Nishigori scoffed. “Sure, it sucked that your attempt backfired, but it was ballsy of you to even try. Was it hilarious when your skin turned all purple with blue spots? Totally–-”</p><p align="justify">“Shut up,” Yuuri muttered, but Nishigori went on.</p><p align="justify">“–-but only those stuck up assholes who only cared about appearances thought any less of you.”</p><p align="justify">“You’re lying. I’ve seen the looks. Still hear the whispers–-”</p><p align="justify">“You’re really a moron. All the people who talk behind your back? They’re all jealous asses, I can’t believe I have to tell you this!”</p><p align="justify">“I appreciate your… support, but it won’t change the fact that I’m going to talk to Minako-sensei and ask to be released from my obligations–-”</p><p align="justify">“Ugh… no. Stop right there. Go, be a prissy little coward for all I care. But the Katsuki Yuuri I know would never back down from a challenge.”</p><p align="justify">With that, Nishigori disappeared behind their bathroom door, leaving Yuuri flabbergasted and with the feeling of a different kind of shame than he had been feeling all this time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In the end, Yuuri did not talk to Minako-sensei. He went to her office, stood in front of the ornate door for endlessly stretching minutes, but even as he raised his hand to knock, all he could hear was Nishigori calling him a coward. It was a bitter pill to swallow, the complete lack of empathy that had always been part of the way Yuuri talked himself out of things.</p><p align="justify">He was used to people telling him it was okay, that it would get better and to take as much time as he needed. He clung onto these falsely ringing consolations desperately, lying to himself about what he was really doing. That he was being a coward and running away from things. Because that was what he had been doing all his life. Sometimes he got boosts of courage and did something only to panic and crumple under the responsibility his actions brought down on him.</p><p align="justify">He was pathetic and he hated it.</p><p align="justify">That was why he did not knock in the end. Well, partly at least. Part of him just did not want to face Minako-sensei and her acerbic, sharp tongue that was never afraid to lash out if she deemed it necessary. Yet another part of him thought that he did not deserve special treatment just because he had been a stupid kid with even stupider dreams at fifteen. If Mao-san, who was at the top of their class and the closest to be worthy of the Gold robe everyone wanted to get, did not get to bow out of being part of the delegation, why should Yuuri? If anything, he deserved it less for his shameful behavior in the past.</p><p align="justify">Taking a short detour to the closest restroom to hide from the world and himself until he could find his equilibrium again, Yuuri sat in one of the stalls and wheezed into his hands for a while. His head was full of charged, cottony static that left little space for actual thoughts, but enough room for illogical tears that kept streaming down his face. Nothing made sense in that moment and facing his school mates at the dinner table seemed unbearable.</p><p align="justify">He wished cell phones worked in the castle. He wanted to hear his mother’s voice, hear the soft clearness of her Japanese instead of the magically blended syllables that tricked his brain to believe he was listening to his mother tongue even when someone used an entirely different language. He also wanted to hear his mother’s opinion, too. She had always been so level-headed and honest, supporting him the best way she could along with his father and sister.</p><p align="justify">He just wanted his family.</p><p align="justify">With one last, shaky sigh, he got up from his seat on top of the closed toilet lid he had chosen for his place to wallow and wiped away his tears. His skin felt sticky, making him scrunch up his nose and splash cold water onto his face. He avoided the mirror in front of him, choosing to stare at the white porcelain instead until his cheeks felt numb from the cold and he was marginally calmer.</p><p align="justify">He took his time getting back to his room, heaving a sigh of relief when he found it empty. He wasted no time getting rid of his robes, his shoes already lined up by the door, and falling face first into his bed. Only three and a half months left before he could go home again and forget about the impending tournament for a while.</p><p align="justify">He couldn’t wait.</p>
