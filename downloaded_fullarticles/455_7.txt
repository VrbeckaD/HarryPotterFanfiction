    <p>Draco closed his eyes tightly as he felt yet another servant lay their hands on him, turning him to face towards the light, gently tilting his chin up. As innocuous as the touch was, he was going to go insane if people kept handling him, running their greasy little paws all over his skin like they owned him.</p><p>Because they didn't. No one owned him. Not yet.</p><p>His thoughts were distracted for a moment as one of them told him to shut his eyes, swiping a smooth line of eyeshadow under his browbone. Another pair of hands began to brush through his hair and he stiffened, remembering just how many betas there were in the room, watching him. Someone began to unbutton his shirt and his eyes flew open, bright green and furious. There were certain indignities he refused to suffer through.</p><p>In one swift move Draco grabbed the offending servant by the wrists. "You think you can strip me down?" he snarled, the smaller man cowering under his piercing stare. "Me, the sole heir of the Malfoy estate? You have the gall?" Perhaps it was unfair to take his tensions about the rest of this day out on him, but Draco didn't care much about whether or not his annoyance was justified. As he'd recently learned, life was sadly lacking in justice.</p><p>"I'm sorry sir," the servant whimpered, and Draco rolled his eyes. "But it's your father's orders that you be dressed in this by the time you're showed to your guests."</p><p>The garment that the man displayed made Draco's head hurt. It was pure silver, long sleeves accenting its cinched waist. The hemline was low, scraping the floor, and it opened at the midline to reveal a pair of accessorizing pants.</p><p>"That's a dress," the Malfoy heir stated flatly, mentally cursing his father.</p><p>Lucius was the bane of Draco's existence. The Alpha had made his life hell since the day Draco had presented. It had been expected that the heir would be another Alpha, but when Draco had been revealed to be an omega... Well, nothing he could do would please Lucius. Not that he wanted to. The demands that had been heaped upon him were ridiculous. Never complain. Always obey the head of household. Dress as if your appearance was the most important thing about you.</p><p>Draco just couldn't. He'd been raised to be smart and capable, someone that could take over running the family if Lucius were ever to perish. Why did his omega nature make that any different? He was never going to give in to traditional stereotypes and prove himself useless. Draco Malfoy would never be a simple brood mare.</p><p>The only person in the world that seemed to think he could make something of himself was his mother, Narcissa. She had always told him that being a wife and a mother didn't make her any less intelligent, that it wasn't diminishing. Occasionally, the sentiment was soothing. He'd always been closer to his mother, Narcissa being who he'd looked up to in his youth. She'd seemed powerful, even as an omega. Of course, this power dimmed more and more each time Narcissa simply stood aside whilst Lucius screamed at him.</p><p>It seemed that at every turn his father wanted to remind Draco that he was weak, a failure, everything that the Malfoy family hated. This dress was simply another way to do that. Especially today.</p><p>Today was the auction.</p><p>Draco knew that if Lucius wanted to he could've married him off quietly, to some appropriately high bred Alpha. But no, there was no possiblity that any matters considering Draco could be polite and under the radar. Instead his father had decided to be traditional. He'd invited all the eligible Alphas the family knew to brawl, with the winner gaining the right to mate and claim Draco. A truly barbaric idea. Any outsider, if strong enough, could leave with Draco, take him home to be their slut. </p><p>The servants began to undress Draco, this time with more caution. He let them with no further complaints, knowing they couldn't disobey Lucius' orders. The silver cape-dress had laces in the back that took forever to do up, and the omega began to fidget, hands clasped in tight fists. He didn't want to go see all the guests. They were here to witness his humiliation, to experience first hand who the Malfoy heir would be sold to. Whichever Alpha won was bound to be a senseless brute who would beat him senseless each night, every time he didn't act submissively enough. The thought made Draco want to throw up all over the rich emerald pants that a servant was guiding him into.</p><p>When they had finally finished, one of the betas gave Draco a mirror. He glanced at his appearance, initially with disinterest, and then examining more closely. Light pink eyeshadow dusted his eyelids, complementing the rose gloss smeared across his lips. They'd pulled his long silver hair back into a braided bun, and it sat nestled at the nape of his neck. Somehow he looked delicate, waifish. He hadn't known his cheekbones could look this sharp. His firm pout and glare destroyed the effect a tad, but the omega couldn't deny he looked exquisite. A perfect prize to be won.</p><p>"Put a smile on your face," a cutting voice ordered him, and Draco turned, unsurprised to see Lucius Malfoy looking down at him.</p><p>"Father," the omega sneered, crossing his arms. "Don't I look splendid? The perfect piece of meat, just waiting to be sold to the highest bidder."</p><p>Lucius slapped Draco so hard that the boy stumbled back a few steps. "You will be polite and submissive until you leave this house with your new alpha," his father hissed. "I don't want to hear any more nonsense about how upset you are. This is an omega's destiny. Fix his makeup," he ordered the servants, and two young betas rushed to cover up the red handprint blooming on Draco's cheek.</p><p>"Follow me," Lucius commanded once Draco seemed presentable, and left the room with a swish of his cape. There was nothing the omega could do but force himself to wear a neutral expression and follow his father to the Auction.</p><p>As soon as the pair made their entrance, Draco could feel every pair of eyes in the yard fixate on him. There must've been a thousand people there, all dressed in their best finery and staring him down. It would've looked like regular festivities, complete with champagne and flowers, if not for the fighting ring set up in the yard. It was an intimidating sight, chairs surrounding a sand pit encircled with a metal ring, and Draco froze in his tracks. This was where his destiny would be decided.</p><p>A soft hand rested on Draco's shoulder and he relaxed into his mother's touch, looking up at her, clearly relieved. "Darling, you should go wish some of your suitors luck," Narcissa said softly, and the instructions calmed the omega somewhat. He knew how to charm a crowd. Perhaps he could charm his new husband or wife into being kind to him.</p><p>With a small nod Draco stepped forward, smiling graciously at every guest that told him how delectable he looked. When he reached the side of the fighting pit, a crowd of so-called suitors greeted him. They were all clad in black, each radiating pure testosterone.</p><p>The crowd was so large as to be intimidating, and Draco swallowed nervously. Did he even know anyone here? God, he was going to be given to a total stranger. This was the ultimate cosmic punishment.</p><p>Thankfully, a familiar face caught his eye. Blaise Zabini, striding to meet him, a characteristic smile gracing his features. "Ah, my future fianc√©e," the Alpha joked. "Let's hope I can save you from this batch, eh? Some of them look ready to snap you up."</p><p>Draco couldn't help but laugh, relaxing in Blaise's presence. He'd known the Alpha ever since he was a young child. They'd been introduced at eleven and become instant best friends. For a while they'd both thought Lucius would consent to a marriage between them, but it never happened. "Don't say that too loudly," Draco scolded, "these beasts might get a little possessive and pound you into the ground."</p><p>"We're not all beasts." A voice rang out from behind Draco, and Pansy Parkinson joined the pair, clad in a midnight black jumpsuit.</p><p>"You're competing?" Draco burst out in surprise, looking up at the Alpha woman. "I thought--you said you weren't going to, Pansy." He'd known her for as long as Blaise, but they had more of a love-hate relationship. It was always fun to be with her though, and it wouldn't be a nightmare to be married to her. Maybe there was more hope than he'd previously thought.</p><p>"Well, I thought I had to," she shrugged, and Draco cocked an eyebrow inquisitively. Pansy looked at Blaise, who shook his head. "You haven't told him?" she gaped, her gaze flickering between the Alpha and the omega several times.</p><p>"Told me what?" Draco demanded, a sense of foreboding creeping up his spine. "What is it? Tell me now, Pansy, or I swear I'll-"</p><p>"Calm down," Blaise hushed him, glancing around. "It's just... Some of the people courting you are rather... Unexpected."</p><p>"Like who?"</p><p>"Thomas Riddle is here," Pansy sighed, placing a hand on Draco's shoulder.</p><p>The blond felt like he was going to throw up.</p><p>He knew Tom, knew him too well. The things that man had done... It would be absolute hell to be married, never mind mated to him. He was a professional omega handler, one who loved to exert his dominance physically, to humiliate those he was put in charge of.</p><p>Draco didn't realize he was shaking until Blaise pulled him into a hug. He quickly tried to calm himself, disgusted at his weak omega instincts. "It'll be fine," the Alpha murmured, patting his back. "He won't win, not against everyone here. There must be someone stronger."</p><p>"Right," Draco mumbled, and then pulled away, catching his breath. "Good luck, you two. I'll be rooting for you."</p><p>He walked away from his friends with his jaw clenched, attempting to pull his thoughts from imagining a future with Tom. It would be utterly humiliating to break down in front of these strangers. It could not happen, Draco would not allow it.</p><p>Lost in his thoughts, Draco bumped into someone and stumbled back, almost falling. He was about to snarl at them before he remembered where he was and put a pretty smile on his face. "I'm so sorry," he simpered as he looked up at whoever this was, and then froze.</p><p>Dark green eyes looked out at him from underneath a mop of curly black hair, a jagged scar sprawling across dark skin. The Alpha looked just as taken aback as Draco was, but all the omega could focus on was how much bigger the man had gotten, how thick his chest was, how he exuded dominance and strength from every pore. "Harry Potter," he gasped out before he could stop himself, and an easy smile graced the Alpha's face.</p><p>"I wasn't sure you'd remember me," the man admitted, and for the first time Draco noticed he was dressed in the all black of a suitor.</p><p>"Of course I do," the omega replied haughtily, one hand fluttering above the silver fabric of his dress. "How could I forget?" Harry had gone to academy with him when he was younger, before he'd presented. They were arch-nemesises in a way only two children could be, fighting over silly little things. But then Draco had presented, and Lucius had declared he must be homeschooled. </p><p>"When I heard about this," Harry gestured to the monstrosity that was the auction, "well, I couldn't miss out on the chance to see you again. I may not win, but I'm glad to have spoken to you. You look..."</p><p>"Splendid, I know," Draco interrupted, surprised at his own gall, and then forged on. "Like a bitch about to be bred."</p><p>Harry looked at him for a moment and then burst into laughter, chuckling so loudly that a group of the other guests looked at them. "I forgot how witty you were," he snickered, and then casually patted the top of Draco's head, a move that left the omega reeling. He'd been expecting more of a slap.</p><p>Suddenly, a bell rang across the yard, and all eyes were drawn to the fighting ring. "Ah. Well, I suppose I've got to go fight for your hand. Wish me luck." And with that he strode away, leaving Draco flabbergasted and not entirely sure what he had been so worried about.</p><p>"Good luck," the omega called out quietly to Harry's retreating back, and then realized he needed to get to the ring as well, to watch his fate be decided.</p><p>Draco found his place at the top of the ring, next to his mother, and sat down with all the grace he could summon. The crowd of suitors were standing in the ring together, most lining the edges to get a defensive start. Lucius stood next to him and waved a hand for silence once everyone had arrived, grinning a showman's smile.</p><p>"Friends," he crowed, "future family. We're here today to find a suitable mate for my son and heir, Draco Malfoy, an omega worth fighting for. The rules are simple. Any Alpha in the ring has a chance of winning my sons hand. To be disqualified, all that must occur is an Alpha's shoulders touching the ground, as then they will be in a submissive position. And Draco is supposed to be the one submitting here, isn't he?"</p><p>There were laughs from the crowd. Draco felt a wave of nausea sweep over him.</p><p>"All is fair in love and war, Alphas, and this is both. For now... Let the fighting commence!"</p><p>The suitors burst into movement as soon as Lucius announced the beginning of the fight, and Draco leaned forward despite himself. It was chaos in the ring, growling filling the air as each Alpha became more aggressive.</p><p>Blaise was the first person Draco could pick out. He was doing a fair job of avoiding the more dangerous Alphas, instead weaving in and out of the fighting to trip up suitors that weren't paying attention. He managed to get two people out just as Draco watched, and one that looked especially vicious. Crabbe something or other, the omega thought.</p><p>Pansy was also weaving through the crowd, although her teeth were bared and her eyes were glimmering. She was a force to be reckoned with, as she confronted a large Alpha and took him down with a flash of her nails. Draco had never seen a female Alpha in action, but she inspired terror, as some of the other suitors actually jumped out of her path.</p><p>Then, in a flash, Pansy was laying on the ground, gasping for breath as she stared upwards in shock.</p><p>Tom. He had taken her down so quickly, ruthless in his brutality. Pansy was forced to get herself up and hop out of the ring before sitting down on the other side, looking defeated. Draco could barely look for fear of what he'd see, but he managed to glance at Riddle.</p><p>The Alpha was looking straight at him, a predatory grin stretched across his face, revealing sharp teeth that made Draco suck in an audible breath. Narcissa gently put a hand on his, but Draco pulled his away, too angry and terrified to allow himself the base comforts of his mother's touch. Riddle looked for a moment more before leaping away, closing a hand around Blaise's neck, and Draco cried out softly as his best friend was slammed to the ground. There went his hope.</p><p>The omega's throat felt like it was closing up as he watched Alpha after Alpha be eliminated. Some were bleeding, some had broken bones, but the crowd was quickly thinning. All Draco could do was close his eyes and listen to the reactions of the crowd, hoping that when it was over he wouldn't be forced to kneel for Tom. That would truly be hell. But perhaps hell was what Draco was destined for.</p><p>"There's only two left, darling," Narcissa said quietly, and Draco couldn't help but slowly open his eyes.</p><p>Harry and Tom were dueling it out in the center of the ring. Tom was no surprise, but the fact that Potter had lasted to the final two made Draco's heart skip a beat. Anything would be better than Riddle, he knew that, but Harry wasn't an option he'd previously considered.</p><p>A snarl rippled through the air and Tom lunged for Harry, trying to seize him by the arm. Harry answered with his own growl, eyes alight with fierce rage, and struck Tom across the face. The fighting sped up until Draco could barely tell whose yelps of pain were whose, whose blood was spattering the sand.</p><p>And then Tom was on the ground.</p><p>It was only for a second, but it was long enough that everyone saw. Riddle leapt to his feet with a snarl, eyes wild, but there were already cheers and clapping coming from the crowd. Draco didn't know if he was going to burst into tears or if he was going to throw up. Nausea seemed to be following him through this nightmare of a day. And then the crowd fell silent, and Draco realized that Harry was striding towards where he sat.</p><p>The Alpha was an absolute mess. His hair looked worse than usual, all mussed up. Somehow in the struggle his shirt had come off, revealing an obscenely muscled chest that was streaked with blood. His eyes were fixed on Draco, the heat they contained burning the omega from twenty feet away.</p><p>"Go kneel for your new Alpha," Lucius hissed, and Draco froze in his seat.</p><p>His new Alpha. Terror gripped him at the words, and he couldn't tear his eyes from Harry. He'd never felt so thoroughly afraid of anyone. He managed to stand, intending to step into the ring, but instead found himself turning and running as fast as he could, pushing aside guests in his desperation. They were so slow to part, making Draco feel as if he was running through water, unable to move as quickly as he'd like.</p><p>It was foolish, and he knew that. An omega running simply triggered the Alpha instinct to chase. Still, he had to get away, had to at least attempt to escape the bleak fate that awaited him as Potter's property. Terrified gasps ripped through his chest as he broke free from the crowd and sprinted across the lawn, hearing an Alpha growl ripple from the ring.</p><p>There was a thud from behind him and someone shrieked. Draco knew Harry was close in pursuit, and yet he still couldn't stop himself, swerving to the side and attempting to escape around the left of the house. His legs were pumping briskly, frantically, adrenaline fueling his sprint for freedom.</p><p>Draco reached the side of the mansion and scraped against the brick, ignoring the rip of fabric and focusing on making it to the front gate. It couldn't be more than five hundred feet away, he knew that, he could make it.</p><p>And then he was being knocked to the ground, a heavy weight covering his entire body and shoving him into the grass.</p><p>The omega screamed and thrashed underneath his Alpha's body, scrabbling at the grass and digging his nails into the dirt. It was undignified, and useless, but Draco still threw his body around as much as he could in an attempt to get away.</p><p>Strong arms encircled the omega and trapped him as Harry rolled over, sitting up and trapping Draco firmly against his chest. The omega fought him until he exhausted himself and went limp. Then the sobs started, embarrassing tears that Draco couldn't seem to stop, no matter how hard he tried. They wracked his smaller frame, and Harry held him close, pressing his face into the man's neck and scenting him.</p><p>Something about the act made Draco cry harder, and Harry shushed him gently, bringing a hand up to smooth back his hair. "It's going to be alright," he murmured, shocking the omega into momentary stillness. Why wasn't his Alpha currently beating him for daring to run away? Harry continued to reassure him and Draco sat silently in his arms, overwhelmed by the pure scent of Alpha that was washing over him.</p><p>"My life is over," he managed to whisper, and Harry growled in response, shocking Draco once again. He looked up at the Alpha and his instincts told him to snuggle into that broad chest, to accept Harry's protection and kindness.</p><p>Of course, Draco wasn't going to listen to his mindlessly omegan inner voice, so he pushed Harry away, landing on his rear in the dirt. "This is ruined," he said flatly, looking at the torn sleeve of his dress.</p><p>"Good thing you have a different outfit for the mating ceremony," an icy voice snapped from behind them, and Draco's shoulders tensed at how furious Lucius sounded. Harry's head snapped towards the other Alpha, and before Draco knew it his new mate was helping him to stand up, a firm grip on his arm.</p><p>"That won't be necessary," he said in a tone colder than Lucius', and Draco trembled. Then, before he knew what was going on, Harry swept him up into his arms. "We'll do the mating ceremony quickly, and then Draco and I will be leaving."</p><p>Draco couldn't look at his father from his position in Harry's grip, so he simply looked at his new Alpha's neck.</p><p>"Fine," Lucius snapped angrily. "Then get on with it."</p><p>Harry smirked and began to carry Draco to where the ceremony was supposed to take place. There was only one clear thought in the omega's head, amongst the conflicting emotions fighting for dominance: would this really be all that bad?</p>
