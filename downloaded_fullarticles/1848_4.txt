    <p>Contemplating a divorce and financial issues at a bar was never a good idea, especially if you had to work in an hour and there was a new murder you had to investigate. Because apparently people don’t know how to not die. It isn’t that hard. Just avoid ever exiting the house. </p><p>Getting drunk off Firewhiskey shots sounded much more appealing to Harry than interviewing some new witnesses of some stupid murder. But if Harry wanted to keep his job, he didn’t exactly have another option than to show up and just get it over with.</p><p>	Of course, that didn’t stop him from having a shot or two. Or eight…</p><p>	So there he was. Staring at the face of a girl who couldn’t have been much older than his own child, Lily, while trying to avoid the blurring in his vision. Don’t throw up, don’t throw up, don’t throw up.<br/>
“-and then they were dead.”</p><p>	Harry blinked. “Huh?”</p><p>	“Were you not paying attention?” Harry’s boss, and the actual interrogator, asked. Why he needed Harry in the room, he didn’t understand. Couldn’t he take his own notes?! It didn’t make any sense. Harry could never remember his name - it was something weird and German - so he just called him Officer Whatever in his mind. “Of course.” He mumbled, squinting down at the notepad. He was supposed to be taking notes as he went about the interrogation, and had been sloppily writing things down that he wasn’t sure were accurate or not.</p><p>- Someone died<br/>
- Big explosion<br/>
- Girl witnessed<br/>
- Happened today</p><p>	“Could you just, erm, repeat it again please?” </p><p>	The girl rolled her eyes, tapping her fingers on the desk and looked annoyed. “Yeah, whatever. Like I said before, we were all in Diagon Alley, getting my brother a new wand.”<br/>
Contemplating a divorce and financial issues at a bar was never a good idea, especially if you had to work in an hour and there was a new murder you had to investigate. Because apparently people don’t know how to not die. It isn’t that hard. Just avoid ever exiting the house. </p><p>	“What’s your brother’s name, again?” Officer Whatever asked.</p><p>	“Arlison.”</p><p>	“Is he your only sibling?”</p><p>	“No, I have a younger brother too. Bentheim.”</p><p>	“Why did Arlison need a new wand?”</p><p>	“He broke his old one.”</p><p>	“How?”</p><p>	“Is this relevant?” The girl asked, now getting pissed off. Her fingers continued to make a rhythm on the desk, going faster and faster every second that went by. </p><p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p><p>	“Everything I ask is relevant, Serenity.”</p><p>	“My parents are dead - murdered, and you’re asking about my brother’s wand!” She stood up, now fuming. Harry frantically took notes, avoiding the rumbling in his stomach and the pounding in his head. His vision came in and out of focus and his handwriting was shaky - practically illegible. “This is ridiculous! You’re ridiculous!”</p><p>	“And your hesitancy to answer a simple question is making you look like a suspect!” Officer Whatever shouted, also standing up. “Now sit down, and finish the interview, alright?”</p><p>	The girl inhaled sharply, shot a death glare at Harry (Why me? What did I do? He thought. I’m just sitting here!), but reluctantly sat down again. “Alright then. Let’s get this bloody thing over with, shall we?”</p><p>	“Good girl.” Officer Whatever said as if she were a puppy. “Now. how did your brother break his wand? How old is he?”</p><p>	“He’s seventeen, I believe. Going into his last year of Hogwarts. And I dunno how he broke it. Probably sat on it, knowing him.” She snickered, and Harry shot down maybe sat on wand.</p><p>“Right. Carry on with the story then.”</p><p>	“We went to Ollivanders, but Ben wanted to go to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes down the road, so I went along with him. Just as we were coming back, the entire shop had burst into flames. My brother and some others made it out all right, but my parents didn’t.”</p><p>	“Did you see anything suspicious?”</p><p>	“No. Not that I can think of.”</p><p>	“Tell me about your family.”</p><p>	The girl shrugged. “Not much to tell. My mum’s name is Parvati and she’s Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and my dad Sai is an author. He’s a squib, too.” </p><p>	“Can you think of anyone that would have had a grudge against your parents?”</p><p>	“Uhm, duh.” She looked at Officer Whatever like he was dumb (which he was). “Literally anyone. My mum’s a step down from Minister, my father’s a squib, and we aren't white! Duh, people are gonna hate us.”</p><p>	Harry held back laughter.</p><p>	“And your siblings?” Officer Whatever continued. “What are they like?”</p><p>	“Are you suggesting that one of us killed them?! We aren’t arsonists, we’re children!” She stood up again, and the security guards behind her leapt towards her when she looked as though she were going to slap Officer Whatever.</p><p>	Luckily, the officer stopped the guards before either of them could touch the girl, and causing her further anger. “It’s a mandatory question, miss.”</p><p>	She glared at him. “Yeah. Kay. Well, my brother Bentheim’s starting school this year. He’s eleven or something. He likes pickles. He’s also adopted from some Nomad wizards somewhere in like, Scandinavia, cause my mom had complications after giving birth to me and could never have another birth child. My other brother and I aren’t. Arlie and I are like, best friends, too. Though I will admit he’s kinda dumb, but then again, all boys are at his age.”</p><p>	“Anything of actual use about them?”</p><p>	She frowned, as if she were going to say something pissy back, but apparently chose not to. “He’s in Gryffindor, but is really quiet. Probably would be best in Hufflepuff. He doesn’t have many friends, either, and the ones he does have annoy the living hell out of me. Like there’s this one guy, Peter, who’s obsessed with some muggle band called My Chem-”</p><p>	“I said relevant!”</p><p>	“Right. Sorry. Well, they’re both kind of boring. So that’s it.”</p><p>	“Potter, you got all that down?”</p><p>	Harry looked up from his notes. “Yeah.”</p><p>	“Hold up, you’re Harry Potter?!” The girl looked at him with wide eyes. </p><p>	“Yeah…”</p><p>	“Like, the Harry Potter?”</p><p>	“Yeah…”</p><p>	Officer Whatever cleared his throat. “You best be going, Serenity I’ll meet you and your siblings in the lobby in about an hour. Help yourself to the Pumpkin Juice we have.”</p><p>***</p><p>Harry sat in the corner of the tiny room, trying not to be noticed as people discussed what to do with the three Greer children.</p><p>	“They have to go with one of us.” Officer Whatever stated very matter-of-factly. “They need Ministry protection.”</p><p>	“Well, I certainly can’t house them!” A man across the room said sternly, twirling his mustache. “I’m allergic to children!”</p><p>	“And I can’t either.” An elderly woman croaked. “My cat Cotton has been very under the weather as of recent, and I can’t risk him exposure to germ-infested children!”</p><p>	People around her nodded in agreement.</p><p>	“What about you, Potter?” Officer Whatever looked over at him. </p><p>	“I-erm-what?” He blinked, having not been paying any attention.</p><p>	“Perfect!” Officer Whatever exclaimed. “You’re an ex Auror too, plus you have children their age for company! Unless, of course, it’s a burden to you?”</p><p>	Oh crap. Harry thought, his eyes widening. How the hell was he supposed to answer this? To tell his boss that no, he had just gone through a divorce and lost the custody of his own children and would rather just sit and drink wine all day rather than care for three PTSD ridden teenagers, without losing his job?</p><p>	Officer Whatever was right. The children needed protection - whoever started the fire would surely be after the witnesses, especially if the oldest child (Arlison, was it?) saw who it was. And they had just lost their parents, they likely needed support, a father figure, to help them through this time. How many people had Harry had during his teen years to help him like that? Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Snape. Even more than that. </p><p>	“Alright.” He said finally.</p><p>“Great! Now, c’mon, Potter. Let’s go greet your new family.”</p><p>***</p><p>“What’s he doing here?” Was the first thing the girl said when Harry and Officer Whatever walked into the waiting room. The little boy was asleep, leaning on her shoulder, and woke up when she spoke. “Potter, I mean.”</p><p>	“He’s your new guardian, until further notice.” Officer Whatever said dully, looking over at Harry.</p><p>	“Uh...hey?” He said in response, looking between the three children. The girl looked back angrily, fiddling with a strand of her long black hair. The older boy looked rather similar to her, though was notably shorter, and had large bags under his eyes, likely from crying. The little one had light brown hair, and sparkling blue eyes - a complete contrast from his siblings. He wiped drool off the side of his cheek, and yawned. </p><p>	“Hi!” He smiled groggily. “I’m Bentheim!”</p><p>	“Hi Bentheim!” Harry smiled back overly enthusiastically, ignoring his spinning head. “My name is Harry. I’ll be taking care of you for a while.”</p><p>	The girl - Serenity, stood up, whipping around to face Officer Whatever with an expression of pure rage on her face. “You’re dumping us with this trainwreck?! What the hell’s wrong with you?!”</p><p>	“Miss Greer-”</p><p>	“I don’t want to hear your pathetic excuse! Our mum and dad just died, and you’re leaving us with this obvious drunk, who people have been trying to kill since he was an infant? Where in your tiny brain did you think that was a good idea?!”</p><p>	“I’m not as think as you drunk I am!” Harry shouted, almost tripping over himself as he took a step towards Serenity.</p><p>	“My point proven.”</p><p>	“Ser, c’mon.” The older boy put a hand on her shoulder, and her body immediately relaxed. “Calm down. You’re in grief. Don’t take it out on him.”</p><p>	Serenity took a deep breath, pursing her lips, and sighed. “Fine.” She said finally. “You’re right.”</p><p>	Officer Whatever smiled brightly. “See! I knew you would come around! Now, good luck, to the three of you.” He nodded at the three children, then walked back into the office.</p><p>	“Well…” Harry frowned, unsure of what to say.</p><p>	“Are you gonna be our new dad?” Bentheim asked with wide eyes.</p><p>	What the hell? How do I respond to this?</p><p>	“Ben!” The older boy elbowed him. “Don’t.”</p><p>	“But-”</p><p>	“Don’t make him uncomfortable. He’s already probably feeling awkward enough as it is.” Arlison turned to Harry. “What did you say your name was again, sir?”</p><p>	Harry opened his mouth to answer Arlison’s question, but Bentheim interrupted. “All I meant was-”</p><p>	“Ben, shhh.”</p><p>	“I-”</p><p>	“Shut up and listen to your brother, Bentheim!” Serenity snapped, and everyone was silent for a moment. Harry could tell by the two boy’s expressions that they weren’t used to her being angry at them, and felt a pang of sympathy. </p><p>	“Right then...shall we get going?” Harry said finally, avoiding the children’s gazes.</p><p>	“Yeah.” Arlison replied, grabbing Bentheim’s hand, who had tears running down his cheeks. “Yeah, let’s go.”</p><p>***</p><p>“Is this your home?” Bentheim looked around in awe as they stepped inside the small house. </p><p>	“Yeah, it is. Do you like it?” Harry smiled at the little boy - he was rather fond of him. </p><p>	“Very much, sir!”</p><p>	“Aww, no need for formalities.” Harry said, trying not to slur his words. The tipsiness he had felt earlier had faded, but he was still very clearly drunk. “Call me Harry.”</p><p>	“As in Harry Potter?” Arlison’s eyebrows rose. “You’re Harry Potter?”</p><p>	“Yeah.” He said awkwardly.</p><p>	“That’s so cool!”</p><p>“You know,” Harry began, an idea popping in his head as a way to win over the children’s favour. “I knew your mum. We were friends at school. I took her to the Yule Ball, actually. And my best friend Ron took her sister.”</p><p>	“Really?” Ben looked up.</p><p>	“Wicked.” Arlison said.</p><p>	Serenity shifted, staring at the ground. “You know what’s really wicked?”</p><p>“Hm?” Harry, Arlison and Bentheim said at the same time, looking up at her (she was the tallest of the group).</p><p>Serenity gave Harry a glare that seemed to pierce his soul. A chill ran up his spine “Talking about mum.” </p><p>“Ser-” Arlison began to say, but was cut off.</p><p>“Whatever. It’s fine, Arlie. Really.” She turned to Harry. “Where will we be sleeping, sir?”</p><p>“Harry.” He corrected. “And my kids rooms, if that’s all right.”</p><p>“Where are your kids?”</p><p>“With their mother.” Harry said stiffly.</p><p>“Right. You’re Harry Potter.” Serenity’s eyes twinkled. “Harry Potter, the Boy who Cheated on his Wife. It was all over the Daily Prophet last year.”</p><p>“Serenity!” Arlison’s jaw dropped. “Mr. Potter - Harry, I mean, I’m so sorry!”</p><p>“It’s all right.” He pursed his lips, forcing a smile. “Maybe you children should be off to bed. You’ve obviously had a long day.”</p>
