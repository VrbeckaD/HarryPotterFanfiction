  <span>“Do these sunglasses say ‘I’m a movie star’, or ‘I’m hiding my dark circles because I’m perpetually tired’? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He blinked, rather stupidly, at the question. It wasn’t, he realised now, whether or not they made her resemble a movie star, whatever one of those was, that needed answered. “Why are you wearing sunglasses? It’s midnight,” he added, his freckled nose scrunched in confusion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Because,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” her reply was said in an annoyingly slowed down tone, as though it ought to have been obvious why one would be wearing sunglasses at such an hour, in a permanently darkened alcove of an even darker corridor,  “they make me look like a movie star...</span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> hide how tired I am, it’s a win-win situation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What even is a movie star?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No idea, I overheard someone say it and feel it describes me well though, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Umm…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Exactly.” Pansy’s reply was said in such a matter-of-fact manner that Ron didn’t bother to press the matter further, he knew only too well that the time they had remaining was dwindling, and that he did not wish to spend it arguing semantics over how much sense it made to adopt the title of a subject, when that subject was a mystery. He had a </span>
  <em>
    <span>much </span>
  </em>
  <span>better idea for how the rest of their evening should go.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmmm.” He grinned at the sound, knowing the feeling of his lips against her neck was the cause. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stop smirking, it doesn’t become you,” she snapped, only making him grin further as his hands tousled their way through her long dark hair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Doesn’t become you,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>he repeated, his tone mocking, you sound like my Aunt Muriel. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And yet,” he let out a hiss as her hips unexpectedly arched forward, “you’re </span>
  <em>
    <span>incredibly </span>
  </em>
  <span>turned on from what I can feel. Your Aunt Muriel? What an odd fetish indeed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, old deceased relatives are what get me going, that explains why your cold, dead heart attracted me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure that’s what it was...my </span>
  <em>
    <span>heart.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He kissed her, hard, before replying. “Well, not straight away, no.”</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hermione?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmm?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s an oovie star?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione’s slowly raised eyebrow was the only thing that indicated she had heard him, her head refusing to shift position as her eyes poured left and right over the page of a very large book that was located between the friends. “A what, now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“An oovie star,” Ron repeated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione’s eyes rose to meet his, blinking, as though he’d asked something ridiculous, which, for all he knew, he had. “A </span>
  <em>
    <span>movie </span>
  </em>
  <span>star tends to be an overly dramatic, self centred rich person who knows not what hard work would look like if it punched them in the nose.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, th-thanks.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome,” Hermione replied, pupils already back to zooming across the old page. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>That does actually suit her.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was hard, this not allowing his eyes to wander business, especially when she was stood </span>
  <em>
    <span>right there, </span>
  </em>
  <span>wearing </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>skirt, paired with </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>shirt and...the same bloody sunglasses. At least the time of day it made a modicum of sense for her to wear them, the torrential rain he could see out a nearby window didn’t, but who was he to argue. Especially since the perpetual tiredness she had mentioned was almost entirely his doing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He, Harry and Hermione were ushered further up the corridor, towards the classroom door they were waiting on opening, and Pansy, who was entirely better at ignoring Ron’s very presence than he was at ignoring hers. It pained and turned him on in equal measure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“-movie star, I think it describes me very well-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He didn’t hear the rest, a pounding in his ears having overtaken all other noise as he did everything to fervently avoid a pair of brown, bushy, and currently very raised, eyebrows, the eyes they belonged to wide and staring at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Luckily, at that point, the door to the classroom opened and, most uncharacteristically, Ron eagerly began to walk forwards, desperate to avoid Hermione. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Despite his best efforts, however, and even with the pounding, he couldn’t avert his attention from the hissed ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>I knew it!’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>that echoed from behind him. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<em>
    <span>Oh, this is going to be bad. </span>
  </em>
