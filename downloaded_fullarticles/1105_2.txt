    <p>Only the dead have seen the end of war. <br/>-Plato</p>
<p>He had drug himself to class early and gotten a seat in the front off to the side in hopes that no one would bother him. First day of classes and all, maybe everyone would be welcoming. But of course he was wrong. Behind him slid a group of mixed houses. Ravenclaws and Gryffindors who obviously still held contempt for him. </p>
<p>They were forced together there. A group of children left to pick up the pieces after a war. Split down the middle in which side they chose, which side they were born into. Good vs. evil. Wrong vs right. Dark vs. light. No matter which term you used the after math left a large grey area in between the two. And in the grey area they existed. Jumpy, tired, uncomfortable this was the life of a survivor.</p>
<p>He was trying to read ahead in the subject when the silence in the room was broken by the electrical sound of a curse hitting a protective shield. </p>
<p>He was surprised that the shield was enclosing him, but even more surprise that despite how thick the shield was it was cast non verbally. </p>
<p>“If your going to attempt to cast hexes at least get fucking good at it.” She slammed her books on the table next to him jarring him from his confusion. She sat down hard in the chair and let out a long sigh tossing her long brown hair over her shoulder. </p>
<p>“Like this.” She opened her hand once and 5 sparks of red flew across the room and hit their intended targets sending them yelping in the air. </p>
<p>“Amateurs” she mumbled. </p>
<p>“Granger.”</p>
<p>“Hello Malfoy, lovely to see you again. How was your summer.” She grinned at him. </p>
<p>He took a second to look her over. She looked older, more refined. Her normally bushy hair had grown out and was laying in loose curls down her back. She had lost quite a bit of weight and he’d never admit it to her but she was too skinny now in her too big uniform. She looked tired but her eyes were still a golden brown honey color and besides everything they had been through together they looked up at him friendly. </p>
<p>He raised a brow looking at her as if she grew another head. </p>
<p>“Well enough I suppose, I’m here after all.” He shrugged. “And yours? I mean besides the reports from the prophet that you basically went missing?”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Well I’m here after all.” She said throwing his words back at him. “So I guess just peachy.”  </p>
<p>The class started and they didn’t speak again till the end when they were asked to transfigured a dried seed into an edible piece of fruit. Draco couldn’t help but notice she was tapping her fingers against the table like she was in a hurry to get out of the room. She had seemed bored all lesson but he didn’t really find that surprising considering she had always been much more advanced than the others in school and that was before she had to survive on her own for a year in the wild on the run. Well technically not on her own. She had Potter and the Weasel, but she might have well as been considering those two probably just relied on her. </p>
<p>“Do you want to go first?” She looked over at him breaking his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Sure.” He shrugged and murmured a small spell as he waved his wand around the seed. The small mustard seed transformed into a watermelon and she gave him a small smile. </p>
<p>She reached her arm across the table and waved her wand transfiguring it back into a seed. Then she waved it once again without saying the words aloud changed the seed into a perfectly ripe green apple. She picked up the fruit and tossed it to Draco. </p>
<p>“Here ya go, you can keep it.” She grinned. </p>
<p>“And why would I do that?” He asked not rudely, but genuinely questioning how she would know he liked green apples. </p>
<p>“They’re your favorite. You smell like a orchard.” She shrugged and got up to approach the teacher. She handed him a scroll that had the Hogwarts seal on it. </p>
<p>Draco watched as the professor read over the note with brows furrowed and placed a hand on Hermiones shoulder giving her a sad smile. Nodding to her at whatever it was she was whispering. He looked around to see the others had packed up and left so he quickly threw his things in his bag. He stopped outside of the room to speak to a sixth year who had the class next when she brushed past him down the hall. She was almost at the end when he took a bite of the apple and let out a near moan at how juicy and ripe it was. </p>
<p>He almost choked when she froze at the end of the hall and looked back at him. A mischievous smile on her face and then she winked at him! Hermione Granger winked at him! How did she even know he took a bite. There’s no way she heard it with all the noise on the hall. He was confused but intrigued, a combination he would seek to rectify. </p>
<p>He didn’t see her for the rest of the day. She didn’t come to lunch or dinner which Draco thought was weird. He saw the Weaslette at dinner talking with Longbottom and he saw them shoving food in their pockets when they thought no one was looking. That’s even weirder. It was the first day of classes, there was no way she’d have that much work to do. Maybe she was sick. She did seem off earlier. He could easily chalk it up to being back here after so long. </p>
<p>He finally saw her again the next day. She had missed breakfast but was sitting in the potions class when he arrived. He moved to the table behind her to be able to watch her without being so obvious. She was leaning back in her chair. Sitting very still, head rested against the back, she must have transfigured her chair to be more comfortable for her because the rest of the class just had stools. </p>
<p>For a second he thought she was asleep but she held up a stack of papers in her hand silently. He was about to ask what it was when Susan Bones came walking in the class towards her and took them. </p>
<p>“Oh Hermione you are a life saver! I would have never been able to come up with anything like this! Thank you so much!” The girl gushed at Hermione who just nodded and smiled at her. </p>
<p>The youngest Weasley came into the class next and sat down next to Hermione while Bones was still blubbering her thanks. </p>
<p>“Hello Susan, are you in this class today?” Ginny asked the huffle puff. </p>
<p>“Hello Ginny. No, Hermione graciously made prefect schedules and rounds for me to use. I was just thanking her for it. I don’t know how I would have managed without her help. I don’t know why you turned down head girl Hermione! It’s like you were made for it.” </p>
<p>“Nah, I’ve got enough pseudo titles to last me for a lifetime Susan, I didn’t need to add Head girl to the list.” She shrugged but then grinned at her red headed friend. </p>
<p>“Unless of course that’s the title of my sex tape!” She bursted our laughing, a rich deep laugh that sent her head back. Ginny had cracked up at the same time, it must’ve been some sort of inside joke that Susan Bones didn’t understand because she blushed and left the room. </p>
<p>Draco couldn’t help but release a small snort from the display he just witnessed. He didn’t think he would ever hear the Golden Girl used any type of crass language but two days into the year and he’d already been floored. His snort didn’t go unnoticed and the two girls turned around to look at him, at the same time Blaise and Pansy joined his table. </p>
<p>“Ferret. Something funny?” Ginny asked. </p>
<p>“Hello to you too Weaslette. I was just enjoying the show. After all it’s not every day that the Golden Girl runs off her friends for talking dirty.” He smirked and to his surprise Hermione didn’t respond she just chuckled and turned back to sitting how she was when he came in. </p>
<p>They had spent the class working on a strong sticking potion. It wasn’t a difficult potion per say, just had a lot of small steps to follow in order. The best part of it was once it was done it was done, and they could relax while the others worked to complete it. He tried to tamper his jealousy when Hermione and Ginny were the first to finish. The ginger sat and was talking about quidditch while Hermione instantly went back to her relaxed state. </p>
<p>They had just added their last ingredient and was doing the final stir when Hermione bolted up in her seat. She looked around the room quickly and grabbed her cauldron and Ginny’s hand and spun around to Draco’s table. </p>
<p>She pulled her wand quickly and cast a spell. </p>
<p>“What the hell Granger! What’s going on!” Pansy almost shrieked. </p>
<p>“Three.. two... one.” She whispered and there was an explosion from the table Neville and Seamus had occupied. </p>
<p>A huge cloud of sticky goo flew around the room crashing against the bubble shield she had erected around them. </p>
<p>“Sorry Pansy, I just figured you didn’t want to be stuck to floor here for the next few hours.”<br/>She shrugged. “God knows I didn’t.” </p>
<p>“How did you know it was going to explode?” Blaise asked his face puzzled. </p>
<p>“It was too hot, the dragon scales were scalding-“ she started but was elbowed by the red head. “And well it’s Seamus and Neville, do they ever get anything right?” She added quickly, exchanging a glance at her friend. </p>
<p>“Professor we will just leave our potion here for you to check when you get unstuck.” She called over moving their cauldron back to their desk and the two girls walked from the room together. </p>
<p>“That was odd.” Pansy said. </p>
<p>“She’s right, those two always fuck something up.” Blaise added. </p>
<p>“No, I mean it’s odd that she went out of her way to shield us too. Why did she do that. I know if it was me I wouldn’t have covered them.” She added shaking her jet black bob.</p>
<p>“If you think that’s weird. Let me tell you what happened yesterday in transfiguration .” Draco said as they packed up. </p>
<p>He retold the story to his friends as they walked to their common room. They all seemed equally surprised that she not only protected him, but then retaliated. He left off the part about the Apple, but only because he wasn’t sure how he felt about that and if Pansy picked up on it she would exploit it to his chagrin. </p>
<p>He saw her again at lunch. It was the first meal she had been to and from the size of the plate she made it was also the first meal she had actually eaten. She laughing with Longbottom and Weasley in between bites. The two friends seemed to be encouraging her to eat. </p>
<p>He was about to look away when he saw it. She lifted a small bottle from her robe and poured it into her goblet before drinking it down. She didn’t draw attention to it. But he could tell Ginny had seen it because she gave her a nod and squeezed her hand. </p>
<p>Every time he thought he was getting an idea of what was going on with the New Hermione he found himself even more confused. </p>
<p>After lunch they all had DADA together. They all had to stand in the back of the room as the new professor went around and assigned them seats. He was seated next to the Weaslette which he was annoyed about until they got seated behind Granger and Nott. At least he wasn’t completely surrounded by lions. Pansy was close by too at the table to his left but Blaise was on the other end of the room sitting next to Longbottom. They both looked very unhappy. </p>
<p>The professor had droned on about life after the war and the fight that will continue to ensure success. She mentioned how important it was to come together and raised her water bottle in a faux toast. </p>
<p>“Here’s to coming together!” The professor cheered. </p>
<p>Hermione turned in her seat locking eyes with Ginny as she raised her bottle. </p>
<p>“The title of your sex tape.” She mouthed at the red head and they both had to stifle giggles. </p>
<p>Malfoy just shook his head at them. </p>
<p>Her mannerisms changed as class progressed, she went from smiling and relaxed to sitting up at a sharp angle and taping her feet and fingers against the table as she did the first day. He watched as she grabbed a coin out of her bag and squeezed it tight in her palm while whispering into it. Then he watched as the girl next to him grabbed a coin from her pocket and held it up. Ginny sighed as she put the coin away. </p>
<p>She looked across the room and Draco followed her eyes to see Neville looking across at her with a concerned face. </p>
<p>He looked back at Hermione to see that she had leaned over and had her hand on Theos arm. Who was now sitting completely rigid in his seat. </p>
<p>“Whatever it is you’re worried about I need you to calm down. You are drowning the room in anxiety.” She whispered to him. </p>
<p>“Mione.” Ginny interrupted them. The girl snapped her eyes towards the red head and her eyes were almost glowing. </p>
<p>“I’m trying Gin. He’s just so anxious.” She gritted out between her teeth. Before anyone could react someone dropped an entire stack of books on the other side of the room drawing everyone’s attention. Draco looked up to see Neville looking sheepishly. And by the time he looked back Hermione was tossing a small vial into her bag and was taking a deep breath. And Ginny seemed to release a pint up breath as well. </p>
<p>After a few seconds Hermione leaned over to Nott. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry I snapped at you Theodore. It’s just hard being back ya know. I didn’t mean to take it out on you I’ve just been a little tightly coiled.” She gave him her bast supportive smile and Theo returned it. </p>
<p>“It’s alright Granger, I think this is hard on all of us.” Theo said. </p>
<p>As soon as the teacher dismissed them she was the first out of the door escaping to her common room. </p>
<p>“Is something wrong with Granger?” Draco looked at the Weaslette. </p>
<p>“She’s fine. She is just healing Malfoy not broken, she doesn’t need you and your lot judging her that’s for sure.” She snapped and walked out to follow Hermione.</p>
