</p><p align="center">____________________</p><p>Once the Battle of Hogwarts is over, Hermione returns to school. Not right away, obviously, and not all at once. But slowly. Eventually.</p><p>It takes months of effort to rebuild the castle, and longer still for the trauma to thin, for the survivors of the Great War to feel comfortable returning to the one home that was meant to keep them safe.</p><p>McGonagall looks older than she’s ever looked — the War has not been kind to her — but still she stands tall at the front of a crowd of hundreds of volunteers from all over the country, stone-faced and serious as she directs them with precision. There’s a weariness to the way she moves that hadn’t been there years ago, like some permanent crippling injury done to her soul has left her irrevocably changed. But still, the fire behind her eyes does not falter; has not wavered, not in all the time Hermione has known her.</p><p>It takes months of Charms work, months of clean-up crews, months of scrubbing blood out of stone walls, of clearing away rubble, repairing ripped and burnt paintings, sewing together torn and tattered tapestries. Months of replanting the grounds, of Hagrid quietly and mournfully coaxing animals and creatures back to the Forbidden Forest, whispering to the plants in the dead of night until they finally take root, sprouting tall from soil that a few months ago was charred and littered with remains.</p><p>But once the Battle is over, once the dust settles, once the dead are buried and the loses are being mourned, once the seasons change from summer to autumn, Hermione goes back to school.</p><p>It’s strange, being at Hogwarts without Harry and Ron. It’s strange, and not easy for her to adapt to. She’s never been in the castle without them. Never awoken early in the morning to the thought that they were not there with her, slumbering only a few rooms away. Never entered the Great Hall glancing for their familiar forms only to be sorely disappointed moments later when they fail to appear from within the crowd.</p><p>It puts her off-balance, makes her feel wobbly on her feet and nervous and lonely (truly, properly <em>alone</em>) for the first time in recent memory.</p><p>But Ginny and Luna help remarkably.</p><p>Hermione feels a connection to them, a comradery born of battlefields and blood and tragedy. Luna, who wrapped Hermione up in her arms every night when they were recovering together at Shell Cottage. Who made the hours feel bearable by whispering stories of fantastically impossible magical creatures into Hermione’s ear until she drifted off to sleep. Luna, who would brush a dry cloth over Hermione’s brow when she awoke in the dead of night shaking in a cold, miserable sweat. Who watched over her with quiet eyes, never discussing the things (vulnerabilities and fears and everything in between) that Hermione unwittingly revealed to her in the midst of those bewitching, endless hours. Who despite all the odds has become something of a trusted advisor, a confidant in a way Harry and Ron have never been.</p><p>And then there’s Ginny, who has (somewhat unexpectedly) become Hermione’s most valued companion. Ginny refused to leave her side, to let their friendship waver even when they were children, when they were young and innocent and naïve, when the greatest injury they could imagine being done to them was being ignored, spurned by the boys. Ginny stayed with her when Ron’s jealousy forced friendships to strain, when Harry’s misplaced anger caused her many late nights’ worth of tears and heartbreak. And Ginny stays with her as Harry and Ron start to drift away from her (from them both). With Harry off in his own self-imposed and tormented isolation, and with Hermione’s once-potential romantic relationship with Ron fizzling to a disappointing conclusion with very little fanfare, Hermione and Ginny find each other in an unanticipated but not unwelcome mutually-beneficial companionship.</p><p>Hermione has never had girlfriends before. Not in the traditional, <em>talk-about-boys-and-braid-each-other’s-hair-during-sleepovers </em>way, that is. She’s had female friends, certainly. Ginny has always been a stable, solid measure of support during their long summers together at the Burrow. Her Hogwarts roommates, while not exactly <em>friends </em>of hers, were certainly nothing like enemies. She even counts among her friends the few members of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff she managed to befriend during her fourth-year study groups, when Ron and (a more reluctant) Harry had seemingly written her off for good. But she’s never had friends like Ginny and Luna, before. Not the way they are now. Nothing even comes close. And in the wake of her faltering relationship with Ron, in the wake of Harry’s current unwillingness to reach out for help (except Ginny, because he always seems to make an exception for Ginny), Hermione finds that she leans on different shoulders than she expected.</p><p>She finds she does not mind in the least.</p><p align="center">____________________</p><p>It’s her first night back in the dorms, and Hermione can’t sleep. Her bed is too warm, too comfortable, too unknown to her. After so many months sleeping outside in tents, sleeping on the ground, in a new forest or town every-other-night, the notion of a regular, soft, luxurious place to sleep is daunting. It sets her teeth on edge. Anxious and twitching, like she can’t trust it — like she <em>shouldn’t </em>trust it; like the comfort is a false flag meant to trick her, deceive her, lure her with its promise of safety and security only to rip it from her hands when she least expects it.</p><p>When she used to sleep in these beds, all those many years ago (lifetimes), she liked to draw the curtains entirely closed around herself. It provided her with at least the façade of privacy in a room she shared with 4 other girls. She always enjoyed the comforting embrace of those heavy curtains, blocking light and sound and air, like a shield around her sleeping form. Like those forts she used to build as a child out of blankets and couch cushions and pillows with a single lamp she’d hang from the apex to light her piles and piles of books, in her own little world where her parents couldn’t reach her. She enjoyed the way she could be simultaneously within and without. Plus, for most of her adolescence (before situation demanded she outgrow this particularly cumbersome trait) she was unable to sleep unless submerged in total darkness.</p><p>But when she draws the curtains around her bed tonight, instead of the expected calm, she instead feels a wave of panic overtake her. It closes in on her and makes her feel like she can’t breathe and she closes her eyes and <em>tries</em> to relax but all she can see is darkness and all she can feel are the thick curtains pushing in on her, suffocating her, and the air is musty and stifling and too hot and she can hear the echoes of explosions in her ears, can hear the screams of her classmates, the wails of their ghosts calling from deep within the castle, and she—</p><p>She rips the curtains away from her bed and sits up, panting, feeling cold and sweaty and out-of-place and sick.</p><p>But then she looks around the room she’s in, and she feels somehow worse.</p><p>Lavender’s bed: empty. Parvati’s bed: empty. Emmeline and Abigail’s beds: empty.</p><p>Hermione is the only surviving inhabitant of her dorm to return. No one else — none of those girls she spent 6 years growing up with and sleeping next to — has come back. Lavender, she knows, is still in St. Mungo’s, recovering from Greyback’s attack. Parvati had flat-out refused to step foot in the castle ever again. She hasn’t heard any news about Emmeline since she left for Christmas break the year Hermione was on the run. As a Muggleborn student, she hadn’t been able to come back to school at the start of the new term without risking her own life. Hermione doesn’t know what became of her, and hadn’t really thought, before now, to look into the matter. Wherever she may be, Hermione hopes that Emmeline is safe.</p><p>Abigail had not made it out of the Battle alive.</p><p>She looks out at the sea of empty beds — and tries to grapple with the notion that this is the first time she’ll be sleeping in a room by herself in nearly a year — and Hermione’s stomach turns over.</p><p>She can’t stay here.</p><p>She can’t.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She really should be more surprised, she thinks when she stumbles down the staircase and discovers that she isn’t the only one who decided to seek solace in front of the Common Room fire tonight. In the end, the sight that greets her just makes her feel <em>warm</em>.</p><p>Ginny’s head rises from Neville’s shoulder and she smiles at Hermione in a way that leaves Hermione feeling comfortingly <em>seen</em>. Understood and welcome, all at once. She looks at Hermione like she <em>understands</em>. “Couldn’t sleep?” she asks, and there’s no accusation behind her words, no pitying consolation. Hermione nods wordlessly, and Ginny smiles again. “Us either.” She pats the spot next to her on the couch, an open invitation for Hermione to join them.</p><p>Hermione sinks into the plush red cushions and immediately curls into Ginny’s side. They must make a strange tableau: woman lying on woman lying on man. But Hermione barely has a moment to consider her own discomfort before Ginny tosses a thick, heavy blanket over her shivering form and Hermione is sinking further into the feeling.</p><p>“Thanks,” she murmurs, and Ginny’s only response is simply to slip an arm around her shoulders.</p><p>“It’s too weird being back here,” Neville says from the other end of the couch, his eyes focused and unblinking on the crackling fire in front of them. “I don’t know if we should have come back.”</p><p>“I don’t know either,” Hermione agrees quietly. There are too many ghosts, here. And she isn’t talking about the <em>House</em> ghosts, Nick and the Friar and the Grey Lady. She means the invisible ghosts, the lingering impressions of classmates loved and lost. The loveseat over by the side of the room that Lavender used to curl up on. The table in the library where Hermione had once coached Seamus through his Transfiguration homework. The Quidditch pitch, where she had once cheered on Harry and Fred and George and Ron and Angelina and Oliver…</p><p>There are too many ghosts, too many memories, too many stories leeching out of these walls.</p><p>Hermione doesn’t know if they made the right decision in returning.</p><p>But with Ginny’s arm around her shoulders and Neville’s blanket draped across her, with the warmth of the fire and two of her greatest friends burning some feeling back into her extremities, she thinks that maybe, just maybe, she might survive.</p><p align="center">____________________</p><p>She graduates on-time with Ginny and Luna’s year — and the few students, like Neville, from her own who had wanted to return to school to see their education through — and it is… less climactic than she imagined it would be. She always imagined her graduation from Hogwarts would be this profound, lasting moment in her life. She always imagined it would mark some sort of significant shift in her demeanour, in her future, in her thoughts, in her dreams and her worldview. She always thought it would feel like the cumulative efforts of all of her sleepless nights and tireless hours of studying finally paying off in one single, gratifying conclusion. She always imagined it would be <em>more</em>.</p><p>In reality, her graduation is uneventful and unremarkable. Graduating doesn’t mark a shift in her, doesn’t signify the threshold between childhood and adulthood. Not like she once thought it might. She lost any remaining semblance of her childhood long ago; has been a woman fully-grown for going on three years now, despite what wizarding law might or might not say regarding her age.</p><p>It matters that she graduates because it matters to her that her degree is finally complete, that this is one more thing she can check off of the ridiculous ‘<em>Life To-Do List’ </em>that she’s kept active and running since she was 10 years-old. (Like anything on that list matters now, in the wake of all she’s faced. Death and hunger and fear and torture and degradation and humiliation and rebirth and triumph. Like any of her foolish, naïve milestones matter <em>now</em>.)</p><p>But beyond that, the event itself is unremarkable.</p><p>It is only when she <em>does</em> finally graduate, only when she is standing in her empty dorm room with her degree (metaphorically) in-hand, that Hermione realizes she has <em>no idea</em> what she wants to do with her life. A career in the Ministry seems apt and right up her alley — she’s always been ridiculously hard-working and, in general, whole-heartedly willing to act as a public servant for the betterment of society. (She thinks, unbidden, of the phrase <em>‘For the Greater Good’ </em>and shivers, and shoves it from her mind.) She’s never harboured Harry’s reservations towards authority (particularly governmental authority), never struggled, as Ron so often does, with the resigned understanding that she’ll have to work in less-prestigious fields in order to build herself a solid foundation. A Ministry job is almost <em>expected</em> of her. Pre-destined, even. It’s what she’s been building towards for nearly a decade.</p><p>But Hermione can’t help the revulsion she feels, the sickness and the unease that rises in her stomach chest throat at the mere thought of that sort of existence. She shrinks away from the notion of a 9 to 5 desk job so <em>soon</em> after… everything.</p><p>(Surely there must be more to life than slaving away as a bureaucratic grunt for a government only just now beginning to shake off its inherent prejudice and corruption. Surely she must have other options besides paperwork and meetings and the continued rigidity of fixed schedules and London office work. Surely there must be <em>something</em> else she can do besides work for the organization that has, on several occasions, tried to hurt/imprison/kill her and her closest friends.)</p><p>Currently knee-deep within this existential crisis, Hermione sits down heavily upon the bed she occupied for 7 years (on and off) and stares, unblinking, down at her fully-packed trunk. She feels as if she’s the last one left in the entire tower. All the others must have already begun to head for the train. It’s about time for that. In fact, Hermione thinks that if she doesn’t leave soon, she’s likely to miss it.</p><p>She does not move. Instead, she sits motionless on her old bed and stares down at her belongings as her mind dashes off at a million miles a second. She contemplates her own future and how her life even <em>now</em> feels as if it’s slipping away from her. She’s lacked control for <em>so long</em> now, has been beholden to the whims and the needs of others for nearly her entire life. How extraordinarily <em>unfair</em> that all is. She thinks about how she’s sitting here, a woman almost in her twenties, with a whole world of new responsibilities staring her down and how is she meant to <em>deal</em> with all of this when she’s never been taught <em>how</em>, when she can’t even—</p><p>(She thinks of Sylvia Plath, <em>I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story, </em>thinks of the figs of her future, all the lives she might lead, thinks <em>I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind, </em>thinks <em>I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet, </em>thinks of rotting figs and black, poisonous fruit and her life, branching out before her, already turning black around the edges<em>.</em>)</p><p>A hand on her arm pulls her out of her thoughts. Hermione starts, her hand moving automatically to the wand in her pocket. She blinks quickly a few times, realizing belatedly that her vision has gone a little blurry with the fog of unshed tears. When she finally manages to look up, Ginny is crouched in front of her, her brow furrowed and her eyes worried. “Hermione?” she asks quietly. “Are you alright?”</p><p>Hermione nods around a smile that doesn’t feel genuine. “Fine,” she says, though she knows it doesn’t sound like the truth. The look Ginny levels her way confirms it. Hermione sighs quietly and shakes her head, closing her eyes and dipping her chin so low that it brushes the top of her sternum. Her mouth, strangely, tastes of over-ripe figs. She licks her lips, trying to dispel it. “I just…” she says in a voice that shakes, admitting softly, “I don’t know what we <em>do</em>, now. This is the first time in my life I’ve ever… <em>not</em> had a plan for something.”</p><p>But Ginny — sweet, marvellous, lovely Ginny — just squeezes her hand tightly until Hermione finally looks back up at her. “You want to know what to do next?” she asks, and Hermione shakes her head, her expression almost desperate. “We keep fighting. The War might be won, but there are still fights we have to see through.” She squeezes Hermione’s hand again, and Hermione squeezes back. “So we get on that train, and we get to work. We keep fighting. We keep fighting until there’s nothing left to fight against, and only things left to fight for.” She presses a swift kiss to the back of Hermione’s hand, and Hermione feels herself warm at the gesture. “We keep fighting,” she repeats, her voice soft enough to almost be mistaken for a whisper.</p><p>Hermione allows Ginny to help her to her feet as something bright, something that feels almost like <em>hope</em>, expands inside her chest.</p><p align="center">____________________</p><p>The day Hermione realizes that she has to leave her childhood home is one of the most surreal of her life.</p><p>It takes her a while after she graduates — a few months, really — but she slowly comes to realize that, however noble their intentions, her parents will <em>never</em> understand what has happened to her in the past two years. They’ll never understand what she went through, the things she saw, the things she lost, the people she fought with, the lives she took, the deaths for which she’s responsible. They will never understand the nightmares that haunt her in the dead of night, the faces of lost friends she sees whenever she closes her eyes, the way she flinches away from women on the street with dark, curly hair. They’ll never understand the way her hands tremble sometimes without her wanting them to, or why she refuses to wear bathing suits and sleeveless dresses, or the way her bones creak in her body whenever it storms, or the fire that shoots through her muscles without warning on some of her harder days, making them seize up, making her crumble to the ground.</p><p>It forges an incomprehensible impasse between them which, Hermione thinks, will never truly be surmountable.</p><p>It had been hard, restoring their memories. Not in terms of magical difficulty — the spell was a relatively easy one to reverse, all things considered — but… it had been emotionally draining. They were furious with her, of course. Furious she erased herself from their lives, sent them off to Australia, gone off and risked her life in a war they had never even heard of. But most of all, furious that they weren’t able to keep her safe. Furious that, had she died in the Battle, or even in the larger War, they never would have known; never would have gotten the chance to mourn her; never would have known they’d even <em>had </em>something to mourn.</p><p>(Maybe it isn’t fair to say that they were furious. Maybe a more sympathetic description is ‘terrified’.)</p><p>She has changed remarkably over the past few months, in ways that confuse even her. She has changed, is changing, <em>will </em>change. There’s no point trying to stop it; it’s as inevitable as sunset.</p><p>The last time her parents saw her she had been their daughter, but now… now, a stranger stands in their living room. A strange woman, older and gaunter. Older and haunted by memories and pain and war. A woman who carries anguish in her steps; who stares off into the distance at odd times during the day; who looks at them with such a dark, ancient <em>knowing</em> in her eyes that it shakes the very foundation of their home.</p><p>They never understood why she wanted to go back to school. They hadn’t wanted to let her out of their sight for more than a few minutes at a time, really, after losing her for a year. They couldn’t understand the way the magic pulled at her, demanded her attention. But in the end, they let her go. There wasn’t much they could do to stop her.</p><p>But when she returns from her final year at Hogwarts, she returns to a home that no longer feels like her own, to parents who no longer feel like <em>parents, </em>that is who no longer have <em>authority</em>. She returns to a familiar space as an unfamiliar person, and it doesn’t take her long to realize that the two are incongruous. Like trying to force a square peg through a round hole, Hermione is trying to stick herself somewhere she does not belong.</p><p>It doesn’t take her long to realize she can’t stay.</p><p>(She thinks she scares them. They don’t say as much — would never <em>dream</em> of saying as much — but she catches little flashes of it in her mother’s eyes, in her father’s brow. She scares them, and that deeply unsettles her.)</p><p>(She thinks of the poetry of Christina Rossetti, of goblins poisoning children in the damp night, of fairy tales and nursery rhymes and boogeymen, thinks <em>We must not look at goblin men, We must not buy their fruits: Who knows upon what soil they fed Their hungry thirsty roots, </em>thinks of herself as a child, poisoned, and as a goblin, poisoning.)</p><p>Her parents will never understand what The War did to her. They will never know the costs. Hermione will never tell them about the new scars on her body, what effects Bellatrix’s savage torture left on her mind. She will never tell them how she wakes up most nights in a cold sweat, shivering and with the taste of her own blood on her tongue; how it felt to have her school — her safe haven — destroyed in front of her eyes. Will never say how agonizing it was to bury her classmates, her friends; the emotional toll of forcing herself to <em>stay at school</em> and <em>conquer</em> it and prove that she can be stronger than her demons.</p><p>She will never tell them. She would never <em>be able</em> to tell them. They could never understand.</p><p>When she tells them she wants to move out, they look at her with such sadness, such grief, such <em>pity</em>, that it makes her want to curse everything around her into oblivion.</p><p>But they don’t try and stop her. And that is a horrible, terrible sadness in its own right.</p><p>They let her go.</p><p align="center">____________________</p><p>“You could come to the Burrow,” Ginny offers one night over a quiet dinner in some tiny East-London café. They meet every so often in the city, for meals or shopping or a quiet cuppa. Sometimes Hermione brings Neville, and sometimes Ginny brings Luna. But more often than not it’s just the two of them.</p><p>Hermione likes these little outings. She likes the regularity of them, the familiarity. She likes Apparating into London, likes walking through the streets, blending into the crowd — just another young woman, invisible amongst the throngs. She likes the anonymity of the city, the fact that she doesn’t run the risk of seeing former classmates or professors or enemies or comrades-in-arms. She thinks Ginny likes them for the same reasons.</p><p>Hermione shakes her head as she wraps her hands around the mug of coffee in front of her. (She got used to drinking coffee out on the run. There was something more satisfying about brewing it over a fire than warming a kettle of tea. It’s a taste she’s acquired, not at all the way she was raised — her father would be appalled — and even now she doesn’t quite know how to shake it.) “I can’t,” she says softly. “I couldn’t imagine giving your mum one more kid to worry about.”</p><p>“We’re hardly <em>kids</em>, Hermione,” Ginny reasons, and Hermione has to admit that that’s at least true. “Besides, I think…” Something pulls at the corner of Ginny’s mouth (a frown that almost stops her from speaking), but she soldiers on. “I don’t think she’d mind. She likes taking care of people. Doesn’t know what to do when she doesn’t have mouths to feed and kids to scold. And… well, nearly everyone’s gone, now. It’s just me and Ron left.”</p><p>Hermione doesn’t know how to tell her that that’s <em>precisely</em> the reason she can’t stay with them. She can’t go back to being coddled and looked after and taken care of and mothered. She can’t face Mrs. Weasley every day knowing the price that her family paid for this fight. She can’t look that lovely, kind woman in the eye knowing that she might have had a hand in her son’s death. She can’t walk into the house that once was such a defining part of her childhood without being reminded of <em>everything that was </em>and <em>everything that could have been. </em>She can’t walk around in those rooms pretending like she doesn’t hear Fred’s laughter, like she doesn’t see Bill’s bright and smiling face, scar-free and youthful, in every room. She can’t look at Ron without feeling heartbroken and sad and guilty, knowing that once upon a time they might have had a shot at <em>Something Better Together, </em>but at this point it’s starting to feel more and more like they’ve already missed their chance.</p><p>She doesn’t know how to explain any of that to Ginny. But when she looks up and meets the younger woman’s gaze, Ginny has this look on her face that makes Hermione think she understands, at least in part, what Hermione might be feeling.</p><p>When she turns down the offer once more, with an air of finality, Ginny doesn’t push her. And she never brings it up again.</p><p align="center">____________________</p><p>She doesn’t know what makes her decide to leave her parents’ house with no lease set up, with nowhere to stay, and with very few of her clothes and personal possessions. And she <em>definitely</em> doesn’t know <em>what</em>, exactly, compels her to knock on the door of Number 12 Grimmauld Place with nothing more than a jacket thrown over her shoulders and suitcase in hand. But here she is, standing on the steps outside the familiar home, knocking three times in quick succession.</p><p>Harry pulls the door open and immediately blinks at her in surprise. His hair is tousled and messy, his eyes a little unfocused behind his glasses. He hadn’t been expecting her but he doesn’t seem angry to see her. So, that’s comforting.</p><p>Hermione’s stomach clenches a little at the realization that this is the first time they’ve seen each other in just about a year.</p><p>“Hermione!” he exclaims, wiping his hands off on a towel he pulls from his back pocket. (Had he been shaving? Cooking? She has no idea.) “This is a surprise. Are you looking for Ginny? She’s not supposed to get here until—” His eyes flick down and catch sight of the trunk at her feet. “Oh,” he says softly, like a breath of air.</p><p>She tries to smile at him. “Hi, Harry,” she says, whispering too. “Can I come inside?”</p><p>He steps aside, pushing the door open behind him in order to let her pass.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“You can stay,” he says later, handing her a cup of coffee she hadn’t asked for (but had desperately wanted). “You can stay as long as you like.”</p><p>“It won’t be long,” she promises, her fingers twitching around the handle of the mug nervously. “I just… I couldn’t bear living at home any longer. I just need somewhere to stay until I can… get a job and-and figure things out, and—”</p><p>“Hermione,” he cuts her off quickly. “I promise, I don’t mind. You can stay as long as you like. You’ll always have a place here. You know that.”</p><p>She smiles at him, and it’s the first real smile she’s been able to produce in a while. “Thank you,” she says sincerely, her voice heavy.</p><p>They look at each other for a few long moments, and it’s striking how different it all feels. It isn’t <em>uncomfortable</em> but it’s… definitely different. There’s more silence between them, now. But also more understanding. They haven’t seen each other in nearly a year, and yet there’s no sort of animosity between them, no begrudging anger, no hurt feelings from being deprioritized.</p><p>(Hermione remembers the very first time she was in this house, the summer before their fifth year, when Dumbledore made her and Ron swear not to reveal anything about their lives or their location to Harry. She remembers his anger, the look of betrayal levelled at her; remembers how he threw accusations her way; remembers how alone he felt, how abandoned. She remembers how crushing it was, to know that she caused it. She remembers that time, and is grateful that this is not a repeat.)</p><p>Hermione thinks that she should hug him. Harry quite looks like he could do with a hug. But she stays in her seat, unwilling to broach the space between them.</p><p>(She’s not sure how the war has affected him. They haven’t seen each other in a year, and she isn’t sure how he might react. <em>She</em> can barely stomach any sort of physicality; every hug feels like it’s crushing her, every unexpected touch burns through her like venom. Her skin crawls at the notion of sleeping next to someone, of letting herself be so vulnerable in someone else’s company.)</p><p>(She wonders if she’ll ever get over it.)</p><p>“I’m sorry I didn’t come to your graduation,” Harry says quietly, his eyes downcast and his hands folded in his lap.</p><p>Hermione blinks, startled. She shakes her head though she knows he can’t see her. “That doesn’t matter. You’ve been busy.”</p><p>“I could have made the trip.”</p><p>“I’m not angry with you, Harry. I understand why you didn’t come.” And she does. She <em>does</em> understand.</p><p>He looks at her now, his eyes shining and dark behind his glasses. He looks impossibly old, lit like this from below by the solitary candle that burns between them. There’s a deep sadness to the curve of his shoulders and the tightness of his eyes that makes Hermione practically ache for the boy she once knew. “I don’t know how you did it,” he says quietly. “I don’t know how you went back there. I don’t know how you spent a-a year back in that castle without…” He trails off.</p><p>Hermione lays a hand gently on top of his. “I almost went mad,” she admits softly. “I was so close to going mad, so many times. I almost left… maybe a dozen times in my first two weeks.”</p><p>“Why did you stay?”</p><p>She shakes her head. “I don’t honestly know. To see it through, maybe. To prove to myself that I <em>could</em> stay. For… for my parents. Ginny and Neville and Luna. All the people who never got a chance to…” Harry squeezes her hand tightly and Hermione has to swallow a few times around the thick lump in her throat. She blinks rapidly, trying to ward off tears she does not want to shed. “I’m sorry,” she apologizes, using her free hand to wipe at her eyes. “I didn’t mean to get so emotional.”</p><p>When she meets Harry’s gaze next he’s smiling at her in that soft, quiet way that he used to. He smiles at her like they’re 15 and only just coming to terms with the fact that the world is a harsh, terrible, and cruel place. He smiles at her and she feels like smiling back.</p><p>“I’m glad you’re here, Hermione,” he says, and she feels a little puff of relief at the confirmation. She hadn’t been sure if she was bringing up memories he might otherwise have wanted to bury. “I’m really, <em>really</em> glad you’re here.”</p><p>“Me too, Harry. Me too.”</p><p align="center">____________________</p><p>With two of them living in the house instead of one (and Ginny spending more and more of her nights in Harry’s bed, too), they make quick work of redecorating Grimmauld Place. When they were 15, under Mrs. Weasley’s guidance, they made great efforts to clean the house and make it somewhat-habitable while still keeping the basic look and structure of the rooms the same. Now, they practically tear it to shreds. There’s nothing in this house that any of them wants to keep. Nights spent eavesdropping on the Order, cramped rooms and dusty darkness, Sirius’ beleaguered footsteps trudging up and down the stairs day in and day out, weeks spent hiding out before Hermione accidentally brought Yaxley back into their safe little world… memories, and good ones. But no need to keep all the furniture in the same place to keep them.</p><p>There’s nothing about this house with its poisoned atmosphere and sour décor that they want to keep, so they completely tear it apart. They repaint rooms, air out ratty carpets, and throw old furniture out by the curb with barely a second glance. Some of the nicer china Harry gives to Mrs. Weasley, over her polite (and loud) protestations. Any items that can be safely disposed of (without risking exposing the Muggle population to injury or curses) are thrown away or donated. Everything else Harry hands over to the Ministry. Walls covered by paintings and tapestries that can’t be removed by magic are simply torn down. Hermione takes a sledgehammer (a tool too unsophisticated for any wizard to think of using) to the one wall on the main floor, the one covered by that hideous tapestry of the entire Black family (minus the burned-out blood traitors, of course). She accidentally hits a pipe in her enthusiasm and floods nearly the entire first floor of the house, but Harry, rather than being angry, just laughs at her, soaked as she is, and hands her a towel before rolling up his own sleeves and getting to work. They’re without water for three days, but she thinks it’s worth it.</p><p>Harry looks happier with each passing week. He’s well in the middle of his Auror training by now, so most days Hermione spends by herself in the small house, repainting walls and tearing down old decorations, throwing beds into the street and donating old clothes and bedding (after dutifully checking to make sure nothing has been cursed).</p><p>Truthfully, they don’t have much to get rid of. The best treasures in the house were sold off years ago, pilfered by Mundungus after Sirius’ death. Much of the house had been ravaged and demolished in the meantime — pillows torn asunder, furniture tipped over, wardrobes destroyed — no doubt during the Death Eaters’ raid. Harry had only done the bare minimum in making the space habitable again when he moved in, but that mostly entailed throwing away broken glass and sweeping up the floors. He’s done nothing to replace broken and lost furniture, to redecorate old bedrooms, to dispose of dark objects and rude paintings, to restock the kitchen shelves with glassware, plates, and the like.</p><p>That’s where Hermione comes in.</p><p>She’s glad for the work, glad for the purpose. It gives her something to do, something that feels important, something that feels productive and like it matters. She’s never been much of a handyman, never been particularly adept at using her hands to build things. She’s never been particularly artistic, nor particularly good at housekeeping spells. But with Harry by her side she learns. And they work together through long summer afternoons, with the door propped open to urge the dust out. And they sweat in the heat, they sweat through the grime, but they laugh, occasionally. And it feels good.</p><p>Ginny shops for plates and silverware, for blankets and rugs and throw pillows. She picks out lamps, tables, vases and flowers and coasters and a million other tiny things Harry and Hermione would never think of needing. She arranges them all around the house and smacks Harry’s hand away whenever he tries to move something. “You’ll leave that alone, Harry Potter,” she warns him when he tries re-arranging the pictures above the mantle, “if you know what’s good for you.” (She acts more and more like her mother every day. Instead of the anger and mortification she might once have felt, Hermione thinks that now she might almost be flattered by the comparison.)</p><p>Luna shows up one day with her smocks, dressed in her paint-splattered trousers, her beaten-up trainers. She ties her hair up and sets to work painting the fine details along the trim in the kitchen, decorative flowers around the mirror in the first floor bathroom, bright constellations and peaceful depictions of the sky on the ceilings of several of the bedrooms. And after quiet consultation with Hermione and a quiet nod of approval from Harry, she begins the long, arduous task of re-creating a tree similar to the one that used to hold portraits of the Black family. But the faces Luna paints on the wall are those of their lost friends and allies, those people they loved (and continue to love) and do not want to forget. Sirius and Mad Eye and Dumbledore and Fred and Tonks and Remus and even Snape. Poor young Collin Creevy, who never should have been at the Battle in the first place. Dobby and Hedwig and Buckbeak, who helped them so much and who were lost too soon. James and Lily Potter, Ariana Dumbledore, Ted Tonks, Regulus Black, Credric. (She continues the painting for years afterward, always adding to the mural, more and more faces as they gain more friends and family and loved ones and inevitably lose them —  for as all living things must do, their friends eventually die, but the deaths hurt less and less and less and less. They lose more friends, and Luna painstakingly adds their portraits to their growing tableau. Her own private tribute to the fallen.)</p><p>Neville provides them with more house-warming plants than they can keep track of, despite Harry’s vehement warnings that he’s likely to kill any plant in the house that requires any kind of regular watering. Neville just laughs and entrusts Hermione with the schedule.</p><p>Even Ron comes by a few times, lends his hands to the quiet work of building cabinets, constructing bed frames, moving mattresses and bookshelves between rooms. He never stays for long, and he never talks much during his visits, but he passes Hermione in the halls and gives her a small smile, and she feels good about that, too.</p><p align="center">____________________</p><p>“Kingsley contacted me the other day.” Harry says one morning over breakfast.</p><p>“Oh?” Hermione’s only really half-listening as she squints at the morning’s <em>Prophet</em>. Her eyesight doesn’t seem to be as good as it once was. She may have to look into getting glasses, soon. (Gods, she feels old. She’s only just approaching 20, but she might need <em>reading glasses</em> soon.) “About your training? Or just to see how you’re doing?” she asks, because why else?</p><p>“Neither, actually.” That makes Hermione pause. “He… well, it seems the Order have a bit of business still to take care of.”</p><p>“And… he wants you to join?”</p><p>“No, he knows that my focus is on becoming an Auror, right now.” Hermione frowns, still confused. “He wanted to know if I… if <em>we</em>, really, would be willing to let them use Grimmauld Place as Headquarters, again.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Harry swallows, looking nervous. “I told him I had to think about it. We’re still doing renovations and… and things have been going so well, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to… bring all of that back into our lives.”</p><p>Hermione shakes her head. “It’s definitely something to consider. But this is your home, Harry. Whatever decision you make is yours, and I’ll support you either way.”</p><p>“This is <em>our home</em>, Hermione,” he says like it’s obvious, and something catches in her chest. “I’m not making any decisions about this without you.”</p><p>Hermione nods, taking a deep breath in through her nose. “Well… do you want to do it?”</p><p>“I’m not sure,” he says honestly. “I can’t… I’m worried if I let them, then I’ll… then we’ll <em>both</em> be dragged into it. We won’t exactly be able to ignore the Order’s work if they’re conducting it right in our kitchen.”</p><p>Hermione nods at that. “True. We couldn’t ignore it then.” She gives Harry a long, meaningful look. “But do you really <em>want</em> to ignore it? That doesn’t feel like something you’d do.”</p><p>Harry has to chuckle. “You’re right. You always are. I <em>don’t</em> want to ignore what they’re doing. I… I want to help, I think. We can’t really be free of all of this… can’t start to move on until the fight’s done, and… the Order’s trying to make sure that that happens.”</p><p>“And Knigsley is alright with re-establishing the Order? He’s Minister now, and the Order doesn’t exactly operate within the confines of the government.”</p><p>“The Order can do what the Ministry can’t. Kingsley knows that better than anyone.” Harry pauses. Runs a hand through his hair. “It’ll be smaller than before,” he continues, clearly reciting lines he’s been given. “Fewer people. Only those who can be spared. They’re mainly just… hunting down remaining Death Eaters. Making sure none of Voldemort’s followers can begin to recruit an army, again. There aren’t many left, either. Most are dead or in Azkaban. There are only a few high-profile Death Eaters still at large.”</p><p>“You sound like you’ve already made up your mind.”</p><p>He gives her a small, wry little smile. “Do I?”</p><p>She nods. “Yes. But it’s alright; I’ve already made up my mind, too.”</p><p align="center">____________________</p><p>It’s a little strange, at first. The first few meetings are quiet, and sad, especially when Hermione is reminded of all of those familiar faces she will never see again — Alastor and Tonks and Remus and Fred and Sirius and God, even <em>Snape</em> (and oh how she still hates him, even after knowing the full history of what he did, even after knowing of Harry’s forgiveness). But in the heart of tragedy, the others find strength.</p><p>Their numbers grow.</p><p>At first, the only attendees are Kingsley, Arthur, Molly, McGonagall, and Harry and Hermione (though they both maintain adamantly, perhaps foolishly, that they are not <em>officially</em> active Members of the Order). But pretty soon, they’re joined by Neville, and Luna, and Ginny, and Bill and Fleur. Parvati Patil, Seamus Finnigan, and Dean Thomas. Other Ministry officials, friends of Bill’s from when he worked at Gringott’s, old classmates of Arthur and Molly’s. A few other Hogwarts professors, when they can manage to sneak away (Flitwick, Sprout, even Trelawney).</p><p>They don’t all come at once, nor do they all attend every meeting, but they show up when they can. They are all determined, dedicated fighters. They each have something they are willing to die for. They each have something they are willing to kill for. (For Hermione, it is peace. For Harry, it is freedom. For Parvati and Dean and Seamus and Neville, their fallen friends. For Molly, her children. For Kingsley, the future. And on and on and on.)</p><p>Slowly but surely they begin to gather intelligence once again. They have a network of connections and spies that extends far beyond the boundaries of London, far beyond the boundaries of their small country. Charlie has his ties in Romania, Fleur in France, Seamus in Ireland, Bill in Egypt, Kingsley in America. Slowly but surely they begin missions once again. Most of the time, Hermione doesn’t hear from their operatives in the field. She’s only ever made aware of the success or failure of their activities later, much later, when the Order comes together to either mourn or celebrate.</p><p>It’s slow, arduous work, but it feels important.</p><p>They’re shaving away at the remaining ranks of violence and terrorism and fascism and blood-purity one by one, and it feels like it matters.</p><p align="center">____________________</p><p>Nearly four months into Harry and Hermione living together, and Ron moves in, too. It makes sense, really. He and Harry are going through the same training program and working together so closely, the Order of the Phoenix is resurfacing and Ron wants to remain involved, and Ginny already basically sharing a room with Harry at this point, leaving him the sole child under his parent’s watchful protection… It makes sense, really.</p><p>Hermione thought that it would be strange between them, the silences tense and uncomfortable. She had thought it would make <em>her</em> uncomfortable, to have Ron so near to her when they have barely spoken since their fleeting and ill-fated romance came to a spectacular crashing halt.</p><p>But when Ron shows up on their front door with a duffle bag in hand and a shy smile on his face and he says, “Hey, Hermione,” she immediately throws herself into his arms. He drops his bag to the ground and hugs her as fiercely and as tightly as she hugs him.</p><p>She had thought it would be strange, and stilted, and awkward, but it turns out to just be brilliant.</p><p align="center">____________________</p><p>Having Ron and Harry and Ginny all together under one roof again makes Hermione feel light in a way she hasn’t in months, maybe even years. Harry cooks them breakfast every morning, Hermione spends her days making a few finishing touches to the house’s renovations (it’s so much brighter, now; it feels so much bigger without the dark walls and looming, glowering portraits; it feels so much more like <em>home)</em>, and at the end of the day they all come together to talk, or play chess, or read, or listen to the radio, or watch some television (Harry and Hermione insist on putting a set in the living room, and Ron and Ginny stare at it with wide-eyed disbelief for hours and hours on end the first few nights they have it).</p><p>It feels <em>good</em>. It feels <em>right</em>. It feels like something hopeful, like something that might mean <em>the future is possible, </em>and Hermione <em>knows</em> that they’re all so young, still — barely more than teenagers — but they’ve lived through more in the past two years than most have in 30. And Hermione knows that they’re young, knows that the future is fleeting and unpredictable, but… there’s a stability to them, to this little gang of four. There’s a feeling of safety within the walls of this home.</p><p>She feels excited for the first time in a good long while.</p><p align="center">____________________</p>
