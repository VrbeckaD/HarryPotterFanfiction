    <p>Darius was walking through Diagon Alley with Draco, Lucius and Narcissa. It was time to shop for supplies for their second year at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe we have to buy all of Lockhart’s books for DADA class. What can we possibly learn from that?” Draco complained and Darius agreed. He had never read any of the man’s books but he had heard of him. The man was a show off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Speaking of the devil, as soon as they got to Flourish and Blotts Gilderoy Lockhart was there, promoting his new book to the press.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It can’t be- Harry Potter!” someone exclaimed and true enough Potter appeared, looking lost as the photographers started taking his picture. Lockhart smiled widely as he grabbed Potter to his side. Potter looked like a deer in headlights as several flashes from the cameras went off in his face. Lockhart on the other hand was flourishing in the attention and made a speech on how Potter would be gifted with his entire book series.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Poor Potter,” Darius muttered to himself as he browsed the books with his uncle. Draco was not as interested in books and was standing aside while his mother got the required books for him. Darius was looking through a book on dragons when he heard Draco’s voice:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Bet you enjoyed that, Potter. You can’t even enter a bookstore without creating headlines.” Darius shook his head. His cousin had not liked Potter from the beginning due to his friends.</p>
<p>“Leave him alone,” a small red-haired girl said, trying to look threatening but failing. She and Potter both had soot on their face and clothes and had probably travelled by floo. Darius and his uncle went to Draco’s side while Granger and Weasley had joined Potter’s side.</p>
<p>“Draco, that’s enough,” Darius said while Lucius placed the handle of his cane on Draco’s shoulder. Draco took a step back and Darius went up to Potter.</p>
<p>“Hello Potter,” he greeted.</p>
<p>“Mr. Potter,” Lucius said and held out his hand. “Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.” Harry took the offered hand and Lucius pulled him closer to carefully remove Potter’s hair from his forehead with his cane.  </p>
<p>“Forgive me, your scar is legend, as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you,” Lucius said softly. Potter’s face was grave.</p>
<p>“Voldemort killed my parents,” he said with a tight voice. “He was nothing but a murderer.” Darius narrowed his eyes; he hated when people spoke badly about his father. His father was so much more than Potter thought and he had to hold himself back from protesting against Potter’s words. He barely heard Lucius’ reply to Potter but he heard Granger’s tight reply:</p>
<p>“Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.” Lucius gazed at Granger.</p>
<p>“And you must be,” Lucius glanced at Draco who stood behind Granger. “Miss Granger. My boys have told me all about you.” Darius held back a smirk; Granger could only guess the things that him and Draco had told Lucius about her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Darius saw the twins waved at them; he had kept in contact with the twins over the summer and had even met and them at one point. He wanted to speak to them when Mr Weasley appeared. Darius felt the tension between Mr Weasley and Lucius. Darius still had to give his uncle credit for remaining calm when he spoke to Mr Weasley even though he was insulting him. Mr Weasley however did not keep his calm and lounged at Lucius. They bumped into Darius and Weaselette who both dropped their books on the floor and Darius hurried to pick his up. In the end it was Hagrid who broke up the fight between Mr Weasley and Lucius.</p>
<p>Lucius quickly fixed his appearance, straightening his clothes and hair before he turned to Draco and Darius.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Come on, boys,” Lucius finally said as he began to leave the book store.</p>
<p>“See you at school,” Darius told Potter and the twins as he left.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I still do not understand why you must socialize with Weasleys,” Lucius said once they reached home.</p>
<p>“We have been through this, uncle Lucius,” Darius sighed. “The twins are not like their father or mother. Or even their little brother.”</p>
<p>“You chose your companions badly,” Lucius said exasperated and Darius chuckled.</p>
<p>“So, you have told me but I told you that the twins are valuable as friends,” he answered.</p>
<p>“As you wish,” Lucius sighed as he left to his study.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Darius chuckled on his way to his room where he sorted through his new purchases. He had already started to pack for his trip to Hogwarts and only had a few things left. He took his book bag and picked out his new books and began to sort through them. That was when he noticed it; his diary was gone. His precious diary that he brought with him everywhere was gone. His only communication with his father was lost. He frantically looked through his bag again but it was empty. He searched through his entire room, thinking he had forgotten it somewhere but it was nowhere to be found. He called on the house elves and asked them if they had seen it when they cleaned but nobody had. Darius was close to tears; he could not lose his diary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Darius hurried over to his uncle’s study and knocked on the door. He waited until he was allowed to enter before he went inside.</p>
<p>“Uncle Lucius! My diary is gone,” he said, trying to calm himself. Lucius looked up from the parchments he was reading.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you have not misplaced it?” Lucius asked but Darius shook his head.</p>
<p>“I have looked everywhere,” he said almost desperately. He had to blink to keep the tears from coming.</p>
<p>“Calm down, Darius,” Lucius said as he went over to Darius and placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. “When was the last time you saw it?”</p>
<p>“I had it this morning. I was writing in it and telling father about our shopping trip,” Darius said softly. “Then I put it in my bag for safekeeping. But I have already looked in my bag a hundred times.” Lucius squeezed Darius’ shoulder.</p>
<p>“I am sure it will turn up somewhere,” he said with a comforting voice.</p>
<p>“What if it does not?” Darius asked. Lucius gave a reassuring smile.</p>
<p>“I’m sure it will. I’ll have the house elves look for it.” Darius nodded but he was still upset.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The diary was still not found when it was time to leave for Hogwarts.</p>
<p>“We will continue to look for it,” Lucius promised as he stood on the train platform to wave Darius and Draco off. Darius nodded.</p>
<p>“Thank you, uncle Lucius,” he said. Darius and Draco bid Lucius and Narcissa goodbye and then left to board the train.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While on the train Darius felt a little bit better while being surrounded by his friends. He smiled as he sat in a compartment along with Draco, Pansy and Blaise. He had seen them over the summer but it was still nice to see them again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This year Darius and the others did not take the boats to the school but instead were guided to a place where some carriages waited, seemingly drawn by nothing. Darius however, knew that the carriages were drawn by Thestrals even if he himself could not see them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>During the welcome feast Darius noticed that Potter and Weasley were missing from the Gryffindor table which struck him as odd. All the other Weasley’s were there and the youngest one was of course sorted into Gryffindor with her brothers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Darius caught the eyes of the twins and mouthed Potter to them and the twins shrugged their shoulders. If the twins did not know where someone was then it was rare for someone else to know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next morning at breakfast everyone knew what Potter and Weasley had done with taking the flying car and crashing it into the Whumping Willow. Darius held back a laugh when Weasley got a howler from his mother who scolded him in front of the whole school for what he had done. Potter too looked a little pale in the face at the howler.</p>
