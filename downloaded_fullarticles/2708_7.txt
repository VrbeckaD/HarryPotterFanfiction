    <p>Have you lost something recently? A sock or maybe a shiny button?</p><p>Or maybe you found something that you were sure was somewhere else? A book placed back on a shelf or a toy brought back inside.</p><p>Maybe you could swear you are being watched but no matter where you look there is nothing there.</p><p>Maybe you heard a voice or saw a flash of light.</p><p>It could be your imagination.</p><p>Or maybe, just maybe, something far more extraordinary </p><p>In my many years of life, I have come across more than a hundred species of sentient creatures. Each one more varied than the last in terms of appearance, habitat, behavior and even culture, these creatures, that many believe to be nothing more than myths, inhabit the entire world. From the ever expanding sky to the deepest of underwater caves. Some as big as a mountain, where others could fit on your thumbnail.</p><p>Within the pages of this journal I will be writing down my observations of these beings as well as the many legends that surround them. Welcome, readers, to the Creature Encyclopedia.</p><p>~Dianna Reeves</p>
