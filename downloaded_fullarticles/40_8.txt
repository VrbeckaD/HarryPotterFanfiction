  <strong> Hello, readers! </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Before you proceed to click that button to read the first chapter to this story, I would like to address a few things:</p><p dir="ltr">First off, there will be <strong>major themes</strong> that are in the <strong>tags</strong>. Especially, if <em>incest, father/son, nephew/uncle relationships</em> are not your cup of tea, so therefore, please do not proceed to read. And the age that Draco and Harry are at in this story is almost at age 12 (basically, right before their birthday). There will be no mpreg until they're a bit older (maybe between 14-16).</p><p>Second, this story also contains with Draco and Harry being hermaphrodites, and there will be a lot of sexual acts with them having female organs and genitals, and both boys will look feminine. Again, if that’s also not your cup of tea, then, please do not proceed.</p><p>Third, this story is purely for readers who like certain themes that are mentioned in the tags <em>(I’ve tagged everything that will mostly be in the story)</em>, and is for the readers and myself for our own entertainment and enjoyments.</p><p>This entire story (that doesn’t have a plot-ish) is pure fictional and fantasy and will not follow along with the books/movies. I <strong><em>only write</em></strong> things for my own entertainment and my own choice to share the story for readers, who like certain themes and relationships. <strong>Any rude comments towards the author/readers/story will be immediately deleted and only positive comments will be left up.</strong> So, if this story is really not for you, then you can exit out of the story and read something else that you can enjoy. </p><p>I hope you readers will enjoy this story, that is pure porn without any plot (there might be a tiny plot). Please make sure you read all the tags, before you start reading.</p><p>
  <em> This story is written for pure entertainment. </em>
