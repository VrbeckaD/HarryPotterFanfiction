    <p>Angsty…it was the only word to Kaelyn Kensley’s current mood, and it was more and more becoming her constant state of being.</p>
<p>She hadn’t come to Hogwarts with romance on her mind at all. Her initial goals were basic: learn magic, investigate the vaults, find her brother. The plan was to keep mostly to herself so there would be no distractions to those goals. Rowan Khanna and Ravenclaw had made that seem even simpler; there would be nothing to get between her and all the research she would need to do. No one would question a Ravenclaw devoting all her efforts to study. But then Merula came along with her own vault obsession, then a growing list of curse-breaking allies, and it was suddenly apparent that nothing would be as basic as Kaelyn had imagined. Especially when she realized that a convenient friendship had blossomed into quite a crush.</p>
<p>Considering how long her family had dealt with the shame, mockery, and stigma surrounding Jacob’s escapades, Kaelyn was truly surprised at how quickly she (mostly) outgrew the initial “cursed kid” label so many had applied to her. Granted, her early vault successes and temporary inclusion in the Weird Sisters had probably helped considerably. She’d made friends in all the right places and had a plethora of contacts, so by the time she recognized the butterflies growing in the pit of her stomach, she probably could have had any number of people take her up on a date. Andre made it sound like the easiest thing in the world, and even offered to help set her up some time if she wanted. Simple again.</p>
<p>Except like everything else, it was turning out to be anything but simple. Sure, she was certain there would be takers. Most of her popularity was based on overinflated rumors and who she knew, but she had her odd share of admirers and hero worshippers. And even if nothing serious came of it, it felt likely that many of her friends might be on board with a date or two. She suspected even Rowan would say yes, if she asked. But of course, it had to be Penny.</p>
<p>Penny frickin’ Haywood. Plenty of fish in the proverbial sea, but Kaelyn just had to go and fall for only the prettiest, most popular person in their year. The blonde Hufflepuff was friends with everyone, up on all the gossip, excelled in her classes, and again, yeah, <em>super pretty</em>. Really, not at all the kind of person Kaelyn would have thought would catch her eye. Parties and popularity? Gossip? Definitely not her thing…except that it hadn’t taken long for her to learn a side of Penny that few were familiar with.</p>
<p>Kaelyn remembered the first time she’d asked Penny for help (like anyone could ever forget the enthusiastic smile she’d received). Immediately, Penny had jumped at the chance to work with her, even hinting that she didn’t really cherish parties as much as people seemed to assume. <em>“No one ever asks me to join them on death-defying adventures!”</em> Before Kaelyn knew it, she’d discovered that the pretty, touchy-feely, popular Hufflepuff was secretly a complete badass with a thirst for adventure rivaled only by her passion for potion-making. She was the center of the rumor mill, yet any true secret shared with her was safer than gold at Gringott’s. She had loads of friends, but only a tiny handful who actually knew her. And Kaelyn was completely hooked.</p>
<p>Originally, she’d been so focused on finding the vaults and saving her brother that she’d tried hard to toe the line and stay out of as much unrelated mischief as possible. The vaults got her in to enough trouble as it was. Then Penny showed up and with just a few words, suddenly Kaelyn was jinxing prefects and helping steal ingredients from the potions lab to brew some crazy forgetfulness potion the blonde had to be talked out of using. It didn’t seem to matter how much Kaelyn’s brain said no, if Penny asked, her answer was yes. The young curse-breaker seriously doubted she would have ever bothered jumping through the endless hoops of becoming an animagus (keeping that mandrake leaf in her mouth for a month was pure torture), but Penny wanted to try brewing it and she needed a guinea pig, so now Kaelyn could become a cat at will. Sure it was awesome and had its uses, but again, it was mainly to impress that blonde vixen with an angel’s smile.</p>
<p>People said to reach for the stars, and Kaelyn just had to go further. Penny was more than out of her league, she was out of her galaxy and seemed positively unobtainable. And so the Ravenclaw girl sat every day, hanging out or scheming with her unlikely group of friends, completely entranced by the sound of Penny’s voice and the deep blue of her eyes, while trying to appear calm and collected to everyone around them. Kaelyn could feel her resolve starting to crack, and she had developed a tendency to blurt out her feelings to semi-strangers for some strange reason. The Weird Sisters’ cheering charms had probably helped that along, but it was still the weirdest moment to come busting out with her secret crush. <em>But the way those blue eyes had looked at her when she was up on that stage!</em></p>
<p>It didn’t help that Penny came bearing gifts of hugs and cuddles for everyone she saw. How was Kaelyn supposed to feign mere friendship when something as simple as inviting the blonde to sit by her resulted in a breathtaking grin and snuggle time? Or even worse, when things got serious and Penny put on her determined face and pledged her Hufflepuff loyalty, and Kaelyn could melt into a puddle right then and there. Kaelyn’s previous boggart encounter had manifested itself as You-Know-Who, but she was now certain that any new boggart she might chance upon would morph into an angry looking Penny telling her she never wanted to see her again…and the witty Ravenclaw just couldn’t think of anything <em>Riddikulus</em> enough to make the defensive spell work on that.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for Rowen to peg her, she could tell. They never talked about it but anything even mildly Penny related had her clever friend shooting her insightful, amused looks. She had a feeling Tonks had noticed, as well, but surprisingly the metamorphmagus kept whatever thoughts she had to herself. Kaelyn abashedly recalled just recently when she’d been studying Red Caps in the library with Charlie and Tonks, Charlie had pointed out where the book said “Red Caps think anything that’s beautiful is repulsive…”</p>
<p>The word beautiful had immediately played an unavoidable game of word association in Kaelyn’s brain and before she could turn on her mental filter, she was already exclaiming, “That’s it! I have to talk to Penny…” She’d blanched, knowing it was way too late to take the words back, but Tonks had smirked and played along with her little slip.</p>
<p><em>“Good plan, Kaelyn. If he’s repulsed by prettiness, then Penny can be our secret weapon.” </em>It had actually inspired a real plan for a beautification potion, but at the time Kaelyn had wished for nothing more than the earth to split open and swallow her up.</p>
<p>And now here she was in 4<sup>th</sup> year Herbology, between all those very astute people in her life, trying desperately to pay attention to the plants she was supposed to be watering all while the girl of her dreams was going on about a new potion she was working on and she was just<em> so damn cute</em>.</p>
<p>Students were still sleepwalking into the woods and Rakepick was eyeing Kaelyn like some kind of sacrificial lamb. She hadn’t managed to find the missing centaur arrowhead yet, Flitwick was busily prepping her for Prefect status, and all Kaelyn wanted to do was push Penny onto the table beside them and kiss her senseless…and Kaelyn Kensley knew she was in way over her head.</p>
