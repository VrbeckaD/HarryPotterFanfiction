          <div class="userstuff"><p>“I don’t want you to come to the funeral,” Draco said. It was the first thing he had said since learning of his father’s death an hour ago.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Harry said. “Any particular reason why?”</p>
<p>Draco sighed. “You never liked him and actively hated him for most of your life. I… part of me wants you there for comfort but I wouldn’t want you to mourn a man you never got along with. It would feel wrong… egoistic…”</p>
<p>“Draco,” Harry said and reached for his hand. “Why would you choose now of all the times to be selfless? What you said is true, I never liked him, but if me being there would help you deal with it all, I’ll accompany you because I love you and will always do anything in my power to keep your pain to a minimum.”</p>
<p>“Will you ever stop being the martyr?” Draco complained but, in this moment, he seemed much more relieved than annoyed by it.</p>
<p>“Probably not,” Harry said and traced the wedding ring on Draco’s hand with his finger. “But you’ve known that since before you married me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have,” Draco admitted. “Will you come with me to the funeral?”</p>
<p>Harry smiled at him. “As long as I don’t have to pretend I ever liked him.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t ask the impossible of you.” Draco gave another sigh. “Thank you, Harry.”</p>
<p>Harry squeezed Draco’s hand. “For you always, love.”</p></div>
