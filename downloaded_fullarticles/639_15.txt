          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Bucky, it's freezing," Hermione grumbled as her teeth chattered. A cold breeze blew once more, sending a chill down her spine. She wrapped her arms tightly around her waist, pulling her coat as close to her body as she could get it. Shaking her head, she dropped down to the ground and pulled her legs up to her chest as she watched Bucky continue to pace back and forth in front of her.</p><p>"I know," Bucky replied, pausing his pacing to turn and look at Hermione. Confused as to why she wasn't standing beside him, he dropped his gaze to the ground and chuckled when he noticed her sitting in the dirt. "Why are you sitting on the cold ground?"</p><p>Hermione glanced up at him and rolled her eyes. "Because I'm cold, and the wind doesn't seem as chilly down here. Come sit beside me. Obviously, the pacing isn't doing any good to keep you warm. You're starting to shiver."</p><p>Bucky rolled his eyes as he sat down beside her. "I am not," he replied, shaking his head as he scooted closer. He reached over and wrapped an arm around her shoulders. "Now, come over here and keep me warm."</p><p>Hermione giggled and scooted next to Bucky, resting her head on his shoulder. She continued to look around their surroundings. She couldn't figure out how in the world they had gotten here and how they were going to get home, but at least she was here with Bucky rather than alone. "So, do you have any idea where we are?"</p><p>Bucky shook his head. "Not a clue," he sighed, looking around at the sky above them. "But it's beautiful here."</p><p>"It really is," Hermione sighed, smiling happily as she continued to huddle up against Bucky. His body heat was doing an excellent job keeping her warm as it continued to get colder. Without knowing where they were, she had no idea how much colder it was going to get and if they would survive the night. As concerning as that thought might be, Hermione knew that together they could conquer anything.</p><p>Just as she was about to say something to Bucky, a loud thud sound from behind them, both of them jumped to their feet at the sound; they spun around to notice a small spacecraft lying behind them. After a few moments, someone came walking out of the ship.</p><p>Hermione couldn't tell who it was, and Bucky wrapped his arm around her waist, pulling her behind him.</p><p>"Who are you?" Bucky asked, furrowing his brow as the stranger approached them as a few others behind him followed him.</p><p>"We're the Guardians of the Galaxy, bitch, and it seems like you could use our help," the stranger announced, coming closer. "Bucky?"</p><p>"Starlord," Bucky replied with a sigh, rolling his eyes as he reached forward to shake Starlord's hand. "It's good to see you."</p><p>"It's good to see you too," Peter replied, shaking Bucky's hand and peaking over his shoulder at Hermione. "And you must be the little woman Bucky's been bragging about at Avengers' meetings."</p><p>Hermione laughed and took a step closer to Peter. "And you're annoying spaceman Bucky's told me so much about it. It's great to meet you."</p><p>"The pleasure is all mine. Let's load up this space ship and get you two home," Peter replied.</p><p>Hermione slipped her hand into Bucky's and squeezed tight. "Home sounds wonderful."</p></div>
