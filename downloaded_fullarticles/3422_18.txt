    <p class="Para">
  <i>You are no one from nowhere.</i>
</p><p class="Para">
  <i>The timeline that would have given birth to you no longer exists, and yet you still live.</i>
</p><p class="Para">
  <i>You have no name, no parents, no past and no future.</i>
</p><p class="Para">
  <i>You are a child of the wandering stars.</i>
</p><p class="Para">
  <i>And I, Azura, will guide you to your destiny.</i>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p class="Para">"Wake up," says a raspy male voice. "Wake up, we're here. We've arrived in Morrowind. You must have been having quite the dream."</p><p class="Para">Beneath me, the rocking of the waves churns my stomach. I sit up and put a hand to my forehead, blinking the sleep from my eyes and peering into the dark cabin. The person who spoke is a man with pointed elven ears, ashen gray skin, and blood red eyes, with a scar running down the side of his face.</p><p class="Para">"Yeah," I mumble. "You could say that." I feel about myself to find myself clad in the same shabby clothes as the gray-skinned elf, and I'm missing my bag and any other equipment I was carrying, and my hands are bound in shackle-like bracers. "Azura, why couldn't I still have my possessions?" I grumble.</p><p class="Para">"Never heard of a Breton that worships Azura before," my cellmate says.</p><p class="Para">"Well, this one does," I reply.</p><p class="Para">She was the one who sent me here, who gave me passage to this world, a world she was counting on my willingness and ability to help. I'm willing, certainly. As for ability, well, it would help if I still had my belongings.</p><p class="Para">"What's your name? I'm Jiub."</p><p class="Para">"Lexen Skywalker," I say, deciding to go by that name. It's as good as any.</p><p class="Para">"A Breton with a Nord name?" Jiub says. "Half-and-half, I take it?"</p><p class="Para">I shrug. "Maybe."</p><p class="Para">I have no parents. In order to erase the doomed timeline, the one I originally came from was wiped from existence. I don't know if another Lexen Skywalker might be born in the new timeline, but I'm not him. And if I have parents in this alternate universe, I don't know who they are. They're not Anara Chelseer and Anakin Skywalker. They're not James Potter and Lily Evans. Not any of the people I might have claimed as parents in any of the universes I've been in before. I'm now nobody from nowhere.</p><p class="Para">But, if I'm going to blend in with this world, then I'd best start fabricating a story. Having a Breton mother and a Nord father is a good start toward an illusion of having a life. I'll just have to find out more about this world to hammer out the rest of the lie.</p><p class="Para">I wonder where my friends wound up, and <i>who</i> they wound up being. I should try to contact them as soon as possible, but my lack of possessions might be a problem with that. We had a collection of linked journals, that if one person wrote in, everyone else could see what they wrote. I could have summoned up a spirit animal and sent it along with a message, but I've never been able to cast the Patronus Charm without a focus.</p><p class="Para">"Do you know what might have happened to my belongings?" I ask.</p><p class="Para">"Hard to say," Jiub says. "Maybe they'll give them back to you once we're released."</p><p class="Para">"I hope so," I say. "Some of the stuff in that bag was irreplaceable."</p><p class="Para">"I don't know, I always figured if you think something is irreplaceable, you just haven't tried hard enough to replace it," Jiub says.</p><p class="Para">I chuckle. "There's a point to that."</p><p class="Para">"Shh, quiet, a guard's coming," Jiub says.</p><p class="Para">An armored human comes down the corridor to the room Jiub and I are in. "Alright, come along, prisoner. You're getting off here."</p><p class="Para">"Him or me?" I ask.</p><p class="Para">"You, Breton," the guard says. "Just come along with me."</p><p class="Para">Jiub inclines his head toward me and says, "Azura be with you."</p><p class="Para">"Thanks," I say. "You too."</p><p class="Para">I stumble down the corridor after the guard. The ship isn't even moving and I still can't walk properly in it. I hate sailing. Good thing I remember absolutely nothing of that trip. Thank Azura for small favors. I reach for the hatch and fumble with it but can't quite figure out how to open it.</p><p class="Para">The guard snorts in annoyance at me. "Here, I'll get those shackles off of you."</p><p class="Para">It's awfully gracious of him to let me go, and even more gracious not to mock my apparent lack of coordination when anywhere near water. I climb out to the deck and blink into the sun. Birds are chirping, and not far away the eerie call of some sort of enormous creature echoes across the harbor. Since nobody else seems to be freaking out about it, I assume that this is normal and ignore it accordingly. I stagger to the edge of the ship and almost fall face-first into the water, if it weren't for the guard on the dock grabbing me and straightening me.</p><p class="Para">"Best get your land legs back there," the guard says. "It would look bad for the paperwork if you were to accidentally drown while you're being released from prison."</p><p class="Para">"Yeah, thanks," I say with a smirk. "Can I just say, for the record here, that I really, really, really hate ships?"</p><p class="Para">"Duly noted," the guard says. "Our records don't say where you're from."</p><p class="Para">"I'm a Breton," I say, hoping that explains it.</p><p class="Para">"So, High Rock then, I take it?" the guard says. "Daggerfall, perhaps?"</p><p class="Para">"Yeah, Daggerfall," I say smoothly. "I'm totally from Daggerfall."</p><p class="Para">If the guard doubts the veracity of my claim, he doesn't do more than give me a look and write something down. "Head on in, then."</p><p class="Para">So that was a prison ship? Why was I even in prison? Hopefully someone will mention it, because I'm not asking. Best just go with the flow and pretend that I know what I'm talking about.</p><p class="Para">Inside the building is a man in brown robes. "Ah, we've been expecting you. I am Socucius Ergalla with the Imperial Census and Excise Office. We just need to fill out some paperwork and you'll be released. Now, you can either fill it out yourself, or you can answer my questions and I'll fill it out for you."</p><p class="Para">"I can read," I say. going to take the papers.</p><p class="Para">"Yes, of course," Socucius says. "We have to be diplomatic about that, after all. Also, the letter that preceded you said you were born under a certain sign, but did not mention which one."</p><p class="Para">I raise an eyebrow. "That was some excellent communication there."</p><p class="Para">"Yes, well, sometimes people forget to mention things," Socucius says. "It does seem strange that it would be important enough to mention but not to elucidate. Which sign <i>were</i> you born under?"</p><p class="Para">"The wandering stars," I venture, really hoping that counts as a valid sign.</p><p class="Para">"Ah, the sign of the Serpent," Socucius replies. "Patron of the unlucky, the most blessed and most cursed."</p><p class="Para">"Indeed so," I reply. "Very much indeed." I chuckle.</p><p class="Para">I look over the paperwork, wanting to know my occupation and skills. Let's see, sort of a bard and sort of a spellsword? I scribble in my best estimates and hand it back to him.</p><p class="Para">"Ah, very good, very good," Socucius says. "But you did not really need to write 'absolutely useless' at alchemy, really."</p><p class="Para">"Why do you even need to know this stuff?" I wonder.</p><p class="Para">"It's procedure. But 'bard-spellsword-thing' does not sound very nice on a form."</p><p class="Para">I snort softly. "Then call me a 'Stormseeker'."</p><p class="Para">"I have never heard of a 'Stormseeker'," he says.</p><p class="Para">"Does everybody really fit into these neat little categories?" I wonder.</p><p class="Para">I have to wonder just how well any of my skills will even work in this universe, especially if I don't have a wand. Speaking of…</p><p class="Para">"Also, if I'm being released here, will I get my belongings back?" I ask.</p><p class="Para">"Your belongings?" Socucius says. "I'm afraid we didn't receive any and there was no mention of such. I'm sorry."</p><p class="Para">I grumble. "No worries, I'll manage. Just means I'll have to start from scratch again, I suppose."</p><p class="Para">"Can I just put you down as a bard and scratch out alchemy for destruction magic?" he asks.</p><p class="Para">"You're really persistent in wanting to put me into a cubbyhole," I say. "Stormseeker. I am the Stormseeker. Alright?"</p><p class="Para">"Far be it from me to argue," Socucius says, shrugging. "Fine, you're a Stormseeker. And if anyone asks me what that is, I'll tell them I don't know, either."</p><p class="Para">"It means I like to look for stuff and electrocute things," I say.</p><p class="Para">"I suppose that makes as much sense as anything," Socucius says. "Very well. Here are your forms. Continue on through and give them to Sellus Gravius in the next building."</p><p class="Para">He hands me the paperwork, and I move on, already making mental notes for whenever I inevitably wind up having to go through this place again. I wonder, will I reset to the prison ship now when I do a full reset? The Nexus of Torn Elkandu, that I'd originally been resetting to, is no longer functional due to my own actions, even if I <i>did</i> wind up saving the universe in the process, and I hadn't made a full reset since that event. I didn't really want to risk it. But that was before Azura got involved, and I'm sure she'll have something to say about it.</p><p class="Para">Well, I can't really worry about it too much. If I wind up getting killed in a way that forces a full reset, I'll see for myself when and where I reset to. I'm not going to go out and hit myself with a Killing Curse or find a basilisk to look at in order to force one, and I'm sure normal deaths will just put me back at waking up a few hours previously as usual.</p><p class="Para">First things first, though, I need to see about resupplying myself. And if I had my bag of holding, even if it were empty, I could just be grabbing everything in sight that might possibly be useful. Actually, never mind, I do grab everything in sight that might possibly useful. Dagger, lockpick, bread, money, ring… I'm sure nobody will miss these things. I'll make a note that replacing my bag of holding will be my first priority when possible, closely followed by my wizard tent. I go into the next building.</p><p class="Para">"I'm Sellus Gravius," says the armored man in the next room. "I'm here to welcome visitors to Morrowind. Are you the prisoner we're releasing today?"</p><p class="Para">"I'm Lexen Skywalker," I say. "Here's my paperwork." I hand him the forms.</p><p class="Para">"Great," Sellus says, taking them from me and not even looking at them. "I don't know why you're here, and I don't need to know. Your release was authorized by the Emperor himself. When you leave this office, you are a free man. But first, I have instructions for you, from the Emperor."</p><p class="Para">I raise an eyebrow. "Okay, so what does the Emperor want me to do?"</p><p class="Para">I'll decide for myself whether I actually want to do whatever this Emperor wants later. For the moment, I'll just run with it.</p><p class="Para">"I have a package here that you are to take to Caius Cosades, in Balmora," Sellus says. "Ask for him at the South Wall Cornerclub."</p><p class="Para">"Right, could I get a map?" I ask.</p><p class="Para">"Ah, here you go," Sellus says, handing me a parchment marked with cities, forts, roads, and natural features. "I recommend just going and riding the silt strider, though. Much quicker and safer. You can find it just outside town. You can't miss it. It's a giant insect."</p><p class="Para">"A giant insect," I repeat. "Okay then. Anything else I need to know?"</p><p class="Para">"Obey the laws," Sellus says. "Theft, murder, assault. If you wind up going to jail, you're going to need to do the time or pay the fine. The Emperor isn't going to bail you out again."</p><p class="Para">"Understood," I say. "Am I free to go now?"</p><p class="Para">Sellus waves me toward the door. "That is all."</p><p class="Para">I head out the door and take a deep breath of fresh air, and get my first good look at Morrowind. Lush, green trees hang overhead, draping their foliage down toward the ground. Glowing plants and mushrooms grow amidst puddles of algae-filled water.</p><p class="Para">As I walk away from the Census and Excuse Office, I overhear a pale-skinned elf complaining about how he's certain that the guards took his ring. I consider the ring I grabbed while I was in there, and squint at it, trying to focus my magic senses. Magic reading never came as easily to me as it did to Luna, who always seemed to be able to tell things you wouldn't have thought she had any way to know, but I learned it nonetheless. I detect a blue aura around the ring. Healing magic? Like hell is that elf getting it back. It's mine now. Also, he's really whiny. I pointedly walk away from him and look around for this silt strider.</p><p class="Para">At the side of the village whose name I still haven't found out, a wooden ramp leads up to an enormous insect standing on stilt-like legs, which lets out a deep, reverberating trill through the air. That must have been what I heard when I got off the boat. A dark elf woman stands at the top of the ramp.</p><p class="Para">"I'm the caravaner for Seyda Neen. What's your destination, outlander?"</p><p class="Para">"Balmora," I say, wondering if Seyda Neen is the name of a place or a person.</p><p class="Para">"That'll be thirteen drakes," the caravaner says. "Just hop in and we'll take a ride."</p><p class="Para">"In?" I say dubiously, going over to the edge of the platform to take a closer look at this giant insect. Rather than riding <i>on</i> the insect like I'd expected, it appears that someone has hollowed out a cavity inside its carapace and attached controls to its organs and sinews.</p><p class="Para">"Well?" the caravaner says. "Are you going to pay for a lift or not?"</p><p class="Para">"Uhh…" I say, backing away. "I think I'll walk."</p><p class="Para">As I quickly head back down the ramp, I can hear the caravaner laughing about the squeamish outlander.</p><p class="Para">I pull out the map Sellus Gravius gave me. Yeah, this village is Seyda Neen. I scan over the place looking for Balmora. That's another thing I'm going to need to get, a magic map. I wonder where Sirius wound up? He was the expert in magically mapping things. I do know a bit about it myself, but I can't do fine detail work like that without a wand.</p><p class="Para">For now, though, it seems like I'm on my own. Wherever my friends might have Awakened into this world, none of them have contacted me yet, and I don't have the means to do so myself right now. I can't even guarantee they might have the same names or faces, but I'm sure I'll run across them sooner or later.</p><p class="Para">I needn't have resorted to the map. Just outside of town there's a crossroads with signs pointing off to the left and right. Admittedly, the alphabet used on the signs is different from the one in the paperwork I'd been doing, but I can still read it. I head off down the road marked for Balmora and a good many other places. Which would take me right past that damned silt strider again. Who would <i>do</i> something like that to a poor giant insect? I take another look at the map and figure it would be quicker to cut straight north, and find a rough path winding through the swamp.</p><p class="Para">I barely get out of sight of the village before I hear a bloodcurdling scream split the air, not from ahead of me but from <i>above</i>. A man in a robe comes hurtling through the sky and lands with a splat at my feet, dead instantly. What in the Void? Well, there's only one thing to do when there's a corpse in front of you and you're poor. Rifle through the pockets for valuables. Actually, I decide to just strip the body and put on his clothes. They're a little rumpled but otherwise in good shape, even though the hat does look kind of like a nipple. Beats the shabby prison garb the guards had stuck me in. Note to self: Even if I can't get a bag of holding anytime soon, I need to invest in at least an ordinary pack.</p><p class="Para">The man was carrying some scrolls, and a quick read of their magic shows me that they have some sort of Wind Magic attached to them. Flight, I would assume, given the hapless mage's sudden descent. The fool probably mistimed his landing. Flying would make it much quicker to get to Balmora and save me slogging through a swamp. I take one of the scrolls in hand and pulse my magic through it to activate it, and leap into the air.</p><p class="Para">I get a lovely view of the landscape whooshing by below me, up until a steep, rocky hill jutting out of the ground interposes itself in my path. I can't stop my flight, and strike the hillside with a headlong rush and a brief crunching pain before I quickly die.</p>
<hr/><p class="Para">I wake on the prison ship. This is looking like one of those days.</p><p class="Para">"Wake up," says Jiub. "We're in Morrowind. That was some dream you must have been having."</p><p class="Para">"I dreamed I was flying, and then I fell," I reply, rubbing my eyes.</p><p class="Para">"Ah, got to be careful with those levitation spells," Jiub says. "Don't want it to wear off at the wrong moment."</p><p class="Para">"Yeah," I agree.</p><p class="Para">I run through the prison release process again, as if the paperwork hadn't been dull the first time around, and continue to insist that I'm a 'Stormseeker'.</p><p class="Para">I take a bit more of a look around Seyda Neen this time around, thinking I was in a bit of a hurry to get out of town last time. But I don't see much of interest immediate in the swamp village. I stop in at the tradehouse to look over their supplies, that I determine most of which are currently out of my very low price range. I do invest in an ordinary pack, however. A poor substitute for my magic one, but it'll do for now.</p><p class="Para">I set off down the north path again, and right on cue, the hapless flying mage lands at my feet. I strip him again, but this time I pocket those scrolls. If I don't figure out a way to use them safely, I could always just sell them, after all. A journal that I hadn't noticed before is laying near him, probably dropped as he was falling. It reveals that his name was Tarhiel, and that he's probably an idiot.</p><p class="Para">As I'm traveling north, I inadvertently wind up meandering off the path and into a barren, ashen area, whereupon I spot some sort of giant bat-like creature hovering above the rocky hills. It notices me, and with a screech, dives toward me. I draw my dagger and swing, but the creature is fast and maneuverable and I can't land a hit even as it bites and claws at me. What's worse, two more zip in out of nowhere, screeching and clawing the whole time. The bat-like things soon tear me apart.</p>
<hr/><p class="Para">I find myself back on the prison ship with Jiub telling me to wake up.</p><p class="Para">"You were dreaming," Jiub is saying.</p><p class="Para">"I was dreaming about being torn apart by screeching bat-like creatures," I grumble.</p><p class="Para">"Cliff racers?" Jiub says.</p><p class="Para">"Is that what they're called?" I say. "I really hope that dream wasn't prophetic or something, because this is going to be an incredibly annoying 'freedom' if it is."</p><p class="Para">I go through the release procedure again, buy a pack at the tradehouse, and stare off at the path leading into the swamp for a long moment. I go off just far enough to collect the falling mage's possessions again, then return to Seyda Neen and approach the silt strider port.</p><p class="Para">"I'd like to go to Balmora, please," I say, handing over the requested coins to the caravaner.</p><p class="Para">Silt striders are weird, but I can get used to it, I figure. It beats being torn apart by the local wildlife before I can even properly equip myself. Fucking cliff racers.</p>
