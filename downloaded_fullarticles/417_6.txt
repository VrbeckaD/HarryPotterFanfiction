          <div class="userstuff"><p>Beware, Slytherins in your dungeons, Ravenclaws in your tower, Hufflepuffs in your den, Gryffindors in your H.Q.! People of Hogsmeade - especially beware!</p>
<p>Remus Lupin is out of the Shrieking Shack and he's off his potion!</p>
<p>Sirius Black is barking vainly in his own Animagus form, trying to distract Lupin from wherever the Hell that werewolf is going - and he's up to no good! In a very non-funny way too!</p>
<p>And Dumbledore? When this is all over, you better hope that you'll have a good explanation for everything.</p></div>
