"Lily, Take Harry and Run" said James running to the now broken door wand in hand. </p><p>Running upstairs Lily quickly checked her runes underneath baby Harry's crib. Kissing his forehead she whispers "your gonna be okay I promise" Suddenly there is a huge blast and the bedroom door flush open.<br/>
"Step aside and I'll let you live" the hooded figure says.<br/>
"Never" yelling as Lily gets in front of the crib getting in front of the crib.<br/>
"Stop being foolish and step aside" the hooded figure demands.<br/>
"No take me please" Lily pleads.<br/>
"I just want your kid" the hooded figure raising his wand. "Avada Kedavra" green shooting from its wand and hitting Lily killing her. "Now, you." Stepping to the crib and raising his wand, not noticing the runes underneath glowing brightly. "Avada Kedavra." Suddenly in a flash the spell shots back at the figure turning him to dust. Baby Harry Disappearing and runes stop shining. </p><p>Delta Quadrant October 31st 2371 Captains Ready Room USS Voyager<br/>
A quiet cry sounds though the ready room of Captain Kathryn Janeway. Entering the room with her first officer she stops and looks at the small baby in her chair.<br/>
"Captain since when did you have a baby?" Her first officer asks.<br/>
"I havent" says the Captain walking over to the baby, picking him up."But he is bleeding. Chakotay take over on the bridge I'm gonna take to the med bay." Quickly walking out into an elevator. "Deck 9" </p><p>Delta Quadrant October 31st 2371 Medical Bay USS Voyager </p><p>Walking into the high tech medical bay. The captain lays harry down on the bed in the center of the room. "Computer active the emergency medical hologram" she shouts.<br/>
"Please stay the nature of the medical emergency" man says appearing out of thin air.<br/>
"Doctor I need you to look at this baby"<br/>
"Of course, might I ask where this baby came from Captain?"<br/>
"I dont know, I was heading to my ready room and found him laying in my chair"<br/>
"Weird" the doctor says grabbing an instrument and waving it above the forehead of the baby.<br/>
"Whats weird?" Quickly walking over from where she was pacing.<br/>
"The scar it's not healing. I got every thing else healed but the scar" the man says. ,"I might be able to make a cream that could but it will take a bit"<br/>
"Doctor can you find out who he is what happened to his parents?" She asks.<br/>
"Of course, it will take but a moment." Walking over the the computer in the middle of the room and typing on it "Even stranger It seems he doesnt match any of the crew or anyone in our data banks. However he does seem to be completely human, expect there seems to be some energy coming off him but I sadly cant get a good reading on that cause its intervening with my scans." the doctor says. "Might I suggest something Captain".<br/>
"Yes what is it" Janeway answer.<br/>
"Maybe you should adopt him"<br/>
"What" she stare at him wide eyed. "Have you gone crazy"<br/>
"Adopt him. Take him in captain. Captain you might need someone you can be relaxed around. "<br/>
Still looking shocked the Janeway says "What if his parents come back? What do I do then?"
"And if they dont what do you do then." 
"Okay I'll think about it" walking up to Harry rubbing his cheek with her finger. "Tuvok to Captain Janeway" voice brings her back to reality. Sighing she clicks her badge, "Janeway here what's wrong" she says.<br/>
"Your need on the bridge Captain"<br/>
"On my way" she say clicking her badge again looking at the doctor she asks "do you need him still?"<br/>
"Hmmm" the doctor says not really listening to busy looking at the computer readings. "What? Oh yes he needs to updated on his shots and I wanna see about that scar"<br/>
Janeway shaking her head begins to walk out but stops and turns around say "I'll be back when I can" and walking out.</p>
