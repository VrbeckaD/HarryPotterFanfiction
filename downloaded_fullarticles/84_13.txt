    <p>The sun was shining, birds were chirping, no one was trying to take over the world … yet, and it was the weekend, the perfect time to hang out in the park with friends. Which was what a small group of Domino High students and one Egyptian were doing.</p>
<p>Anzu and Honda were dueling at one of the picnic tables while Jounouchi was trying to give Honda some “words of wisdom” on what to do. Unknown to anyone but Yugi, who was sitting on the table, so was the Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh, though many knew him as Yami or the other Yugi, that resided inside the Millennium Puzzle. The first, and only, time he had tried to give Anzu advice she had refused any of his backseat dueling and given him a look that had sent him back to the puzzle with a shiver. He was still backseat dueling as Anzu had called it but this time only Yugi could hear it who was more content to just let Anzu duel the way she wanted to as Honda and Jounouchi got into squabbles over what cards to play or not play.</p>
<p>Malik watched from the swing he was swinging on, trying to get himself as high as he could push the swing to go. He wasn’t really interested so he turned his attention to the last person in the group. Ryou was under the shade of a tree, laying on his stomach, reading a book. He jumped off the swing on the upswing before it could get too high and made his way over. “Come swing with me Ryou,” he said when he was standing over the other only he was ignored. “Ryou,” he whined as he dropped down to sit in front of the other before poking him in the shoulder.</p>
<p>Ryou startled before looking up at the other. He pulled an ear bud out of his ear as he sat up. “Yes?” he asked.</p>
<p>Malik frowned slightly before pointing back at the swings with his thumb over his shoulder. “Want to swing?” he asked again.</p>
<p>Ryou gave the other a small smile before he said, “Sorry, but if I stay in the sun too long I’ll burn, I’ve told you that.”</p>
<p>“Just a little?”</p>
<p>Ryou shook his head no. “If the sun wasn’t so high maybe.”</p>
<p>“What about sunscreen?”</p>
<p>“I’m wearing some.”</p>
<p>“And you’ll still burn?”</p>
<p>Ryou nodded.</p>
<p>Malik frowned.</p>
<p>“How about I read to you a little then I’ll reapply my sunscreen and swing with you?” Ryou bargained.</p>
<p>Malik smiled. “Alright,” he said, “Can I braid your hair then?” Ryou blinked at that. “It’s fun,” Malik cut in before Ryou could ask. Ryou nodded. Malik happily made his way behind Ryou and started braiding his hair as Ryou started to read aloud. After a few lines Malik made a face. “What are you reading?” he asked as he looked over Ryou’s shoulder, holding the braid he was working on in place. Whatever Ryou was reading was in English Malik guessed but the other was translating it to Japanese.</p>
<p>“Edgar Allen Poe,” was Ryou’s answer, “Would you prefer the Brothers Grimm’s Fairy Tales instead?” he asked as he reached for another book beside him.</p>
<p>“Uh,” Malik caught movement out of the corner of his eye. He turned to watch as Jounouchi shook his head no and made other motions to signal his distaste with that option. Anzu and Honda were snickering while Yugi had a small smile on his face in amusement. “What are those about?” he asked.</p>
<p>“They’re like Disney stories only darker and more morbid. Disney made them more “children friendly” by taking out some of the lesson parts of the story because they were too dark,” Ryou shook his head, “Honestly if you ask me those attributes kind of made them more real and relatable.”</p>
<p>“I think I’ll stick with Poe for now.”</p>
<p>Ryou went back to reading as Malik watched Jounouchi sigh in relief. Malik shrugged and went back to his braiding.</p>
<p>After a few stories, Anzu winning, and starting another duel with Honda, Ryou shut the book and put it, along with his other book, in his bag and pulled out his sunscreen which he started to apply. Malik finished off the braid he was working on with a small hair band that he knew Ryou kept in his bag for whatever reason. Ryou stood and stretched and Malik followed suit. “That Poe guy …”</p>
<p>Ryou nodded with a chuckle. “Yeah, so swings?”</p>
<p>Malik nodded enthusiastically as he started to follow the other.</p>
<p>Before they even left the shadow of the tree there was a series of loud cracks from the other side of the park where a small group of five people in black robes and skull masks seemed to appear out of nowhere.</p>
<p>All the park patrons did was look over and blink, used to the strange going ons of the city. It wasn’t until one of the strange robed people pulled out a stick, said something, and a green light admitted from the stick. The light hit a patron who fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The group of students watched as someone approached the fallen patron and kneeled, trying to stir them into movement. When the person didn’t move a scared look fell over the face of the person who tried to wake them. They turned to look at the robed person, wide-eyed and frightened. The park was quiet, making it easy to hear what they said, “They’re dead.”</p>
<p>Another robed person raised a stick similar to the first and pointed it at the frightened patron who paled and scrambled to their feet. They weren’t able to move in time before another stream of green light hit them in the back and they fell to the ground as dead as the first.</p>
<p>This startled the other park patrons into screaming and running for safety as the robed figures flicked their sticks and cast jets of red and green at those that couldn’t get to safety fast enough.</p>
<p>Honda and Anzu gathered up their cards and hastily put them away and Yami switched places with Yugi, before, instead of running away like everyone else, they all ran into the fray, Malik and Ryou leading the charge.</p>
<p>Anzu, Yami, Ryou, and Malik ran over to help others get away and lead the way to the exits safely while Honda and Jounouchi ran to confront the robed figures. They might not have known what was going on but they did know that these people were bad news. And to avoid the lights coming out of their sticks.</p>
<p>“Hey creep!” Jounouchi yelled as he hurled a rock at one of the figures. It hit the person in the face and stunned the others into looking at their comrade, apparently shocked that anyone would fight back. This moment of shock was enough time for Honda to punch another in the cheek.</p>
<p>While Honda and Jounouchi confronted the robed figures head on with fists and dodged the strange lights, the others were trying to get everyone else out of the park. Yami and Anzu took one side of the park while Malik and Ryou took the other side. Yami’s deep, commanding voice was easy to hear while Anzu helped those who tripped and fell or found it hard to get their baring’s in their mad rush out of the park. Ryou directed people out of the park and Malik yelled out directions while keeping an eye on the fight.</p>
<p>It seemed the robed figures had changed tactics somewhat, instead of firing green and red streaks of light they were just firing red streaks of light and their main targets seemed to be Honda and Jounouchi who were doing their best to avoid being struck. The lights would then usually strike the ground or something else though a few stray red streaks would hit a person fleeing who would then scream in pain. The robed figure would then seem to focus solely on the person they struck until a punch from either Honda or Jounouchi would cause them to break their focus and the person would stop screaming. It took Anzu or Ryou a few precious moments to get them to move again before they would shakily get to their feet and slowly stagger toward the exits again.</p>
<p>It was one such streak of light that hit close to a child’s feet who screamed in fright and then ran over to hide under a piece of play equipment. Their mother saw this and started to make her way over to her child only to be stopped by Ryou. She screamed at him that she had to get her child when a stray streak zipped by their heads a little too close for Ryou’s comfort so he pulled them both down behind a large rock that many older kids climbed on. He reassured her that he’d get her child but she had to stay put. After she gave him a shaky nod of her head that she would stay put he rushed out of their hiding place and, keeping an eye on the fight, made his way quickly over to the cowering child.</p>
<p>He noticed that Honda and Jounouchi were starting to tire but the robed figures didn’t look as if they were doing much better either. He briefly wondered how they kept their masks on as he ducked down under the structure and stopped by the child’s, a girl of maybe not much older than eight, side.</p>
<p>She was crying, sniffling, and trembling in fear. Ryou paused as the sight reminded him of Amane when she scrapped her knee waiting for him to find her when they were playing a game of hide-and-seek before shaking himself from his stupor.</p>
<p>“H-hey,” his voice shook but he kept going, “Your mom is worried about you.” The little girl looked up at him with puffy red eyes, her fear clear for all to see. He tried to keep his pain at seeing such a face masked with a cheery look to reassure her that everything would be alright. “See?” he asked as he pointed over to where the girl’s mother was still hiding behind the rock. The girl followed his finger with a hiccup but made no move to move from where she was crouched. He heard a familiar mumbling noise in the back of his mind. He reached for the Millennium Eye in his jacket pocket. </p>
<p>He had found it one day after Battle City when he was going through a stash of the Spirit of the Ring’s pilfered items and, probably against his better judgment, kept it on him. He kept a lot of the stuff the Spirit had stolen unless he could easily find out who owned it, in which case he then sent it back. The Ring, despite usually returning quite quickly after being lost, was still missing. Ryou suspected that Yugi had it which would explain it not returning, but he didn’t feel quite right without it nor was he wanting it to return, so when he found the Eye a sense of relief washed over him. He knew The Eye wasn't meant for him, but it was still a Millennium Item and eased something inside of him, though for the life of him he couldn’t put a name to it, so he was reluctant to part with it.</p>
<p>He gave it a tight squeeze and the mumbling cleared up.</p>
<p>~Master,~ the deep feminine voice spoke calmly through his mind, ~What is going on?~</p>
<p>~Some people in robes attacked the park with sticks,~ he answered. That had been another thing he had found out after Battle City, his Duel Monsters and he could talk to one another outside of the Shadow Realm, though it was mostly Change of Heart and Dark Necrofear, though it seemed to be a mumbling noise unless he held onto the Eye and focused on listening.</p>
<p>~I see,~ the deep voice of Dark Necrofear answered back. ~Do you require my assistance?~ she asked.</p>
<p>He peaked out of his hiding place to see that most of the park was clear and Honda and Jounouchi were tiring but still putting up a fight. He ducked his head back and gave the girl a small smile before answering. ~Not yet. The park’s almost clear so we'll be retreating soon.~</p>
<p>~I see, well Change and I are here if you need us.~</p>
<p>~Top of your deck like always!~ Change of Heart’s lighter, more hyper voice called out enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Ryou couldn’t help the soft chuckle that escaped his lips. ~Thank you,~ he turned his attention back to the girl in front of him, letting go of the Eye and slipping his hand from his pocket in the process. “Let’s get you to your mother, now, shall we?” he asked as he held out his hand for her to take.</p>
<p>She wiped her eyes and took his hand. He offered her a soft, reassuring smile and she offered him a wet, wavering one in turn. He eased out from under the equipment and she followed suit. He made sure the path was as clear as it could be before taking off towards the girl’s mother. He kept himself between the hooded figures and the girl to offer some semblance of protection.</p>
<p>They were a little more than half way to the rock when the girl put on a burst of speed and left his side. “Momma!” she called in happiness, her mother coming to meet her. He tried to quicken his pace to keep himself in between the girl and the hooded figures but he hadn’t expected the sudden burst of speed. And he didn’t expect the red streak of light coming their way. He watched as if the events were happening in slow motion. The light hit the girl who was thrown off her feet. She hit the ground, her head hitting the packed dirt with a sickening thud before time started back up at its normal pace.</p>
<p>Ryou watched as the mother had run over and cradled her little girl in her arms, crying her name over and over. He could do nothing but stop and stare at the two. Again, the girl reminded him of Amane and he had failed her. He grabbed his shirt in a tight fist, over his heart, as he started having trouble breathing.</p>
<p>He looked around from his new position between the girl and her mother and the hooded figures. They were so close to getting everyone out of the park, just a few more people on both sides who were a little scuffed up but still able to walk. There were a few more bodies on the ground other than the first two now that Ryou looked. But the most worrying thing he saw was Honda and Jounouchi. The group of hooded figures had surrounded them and the fight looked like it was finally, actually getting to them, they were panting and their punches seemed sloppier then they once were.</p>
<p>A wail from the girl’s mother broke him out of his assessment of the fight with a jolt, his breath coming back to him with a gasp. He turned to look back at them, at some point having turned to fully face the robed figures. His hand fell to his side as he faced forward again, a numb rage filling him.</p>
<p>His right hand slipped into his jacket pocket and pulled out the Millennium Eye as his left hand slipped into his deck case on his hip. He pulled out the top card and, holding the Eye in a tight fist, held the card between his middle and index finger at arm’s length, facing the group of hooded figures.</p>
<p>“I call forth Dark Necrofear,” his voice was barely a whisper as his rage choked it, but it was enough. The card and Eye glowed brightly before a dark mass of shadows emerged from the card and took form.</p>
<p>Dark Necrofear kneeled before him on bended knee. ~What can I do for you my Mas-~ she stopped mid-question as she took in the look of pain on his face. She looked behind him and narrowed her eyes in anger at the scene of a mother cradling her unresponsive daughter to her chest. She looked around the park before her eyes fell on the fighting group. She turned back to Ryou. ~Were they the ones to cause such destruction?~ she asked in her deep, calm voice, though now there was anger in it.</p>
<p>Ryou could do very little more than nod. “Please,” his voice wavered as he spoke, still soft and choked with rage but also hurt now, “please take care of them.”</p>
<p>Dark Necrofear nodded before standing. With her right hand she pushed Ryou’s hair behind his ear and placed a soft kiss to his forehead. ~Please, hold Doll,~ she requested as she pulled back. Ryou could do little more than nod. She transferred her broken doll to him and he held it in the crook of his right arm as he continued to hold her card out in front of him. She nodded in approval before turning around and making her way over to the fight.</p>
