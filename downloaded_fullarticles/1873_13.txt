    <p>
  <span>It has been a while since the entire Weasley family had been to the house at the same time. Of course, they were missing Percy who was sent on a diplomatic mission to America and Charlie was still somewhere in Romania taming Dragons.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The meeting was organized by Harry and Ginny, so everyone had to attend it. Molly had already prepared a delicious 4 course meal and everyone was socializing themselves. Young James was proving to be too tough for Victoire to handle and needed an adult supervision to avoid a cute battle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After the dinner, Harry stood up and hit the wine glass with spoon to get everyone's attention. When he was sure that he was looking at him, he began.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We all know that James Sirius is proving to be a handful to me and Ginny. I guess he is tough even for Molly to babysit. " </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Molly waved her hand as if it was nothing she couldn't handle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So we finally found a solution for this ". He waited for the dramatic effect.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He is going to have a sibling in the next 7 months ".</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Everyone gasped and then roared in excitement.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, Ginny is pregnant... Again ".</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A wave of congratulations started before it was cut out by Ron shouting ""BLIMEY, HARRY ". Everyone was surprised why Ron took offence to this good news.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I and Hermione were waiting for the 3 months to cross to announce ours but you stole the moment “he complained.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Molly almost shrieked in excitement “is that true?" She asked looking at Hermione. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione was blushing and nodded. Molly rushed and hugged her and started crying. Hermione was almost getting crushed by her huge frame.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Stop being so dramatic, mom” complained Ron “you act as if it was a miracle ".</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, Ron” sobbed Molly “it’s not that. I'm just happy that all my children have a grandchild now ".</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"What about Charlie” enquired George “I never knew you disowned him ".</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Charlie comes home with a new girl every time” said Molly” I know he is sowing his wild oats right from his school days. I bet you if I ever saw a redhead in Transylvania that would be my bastard grandchild ".</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Language, Molly” thundered Arthur. He glanced furtively at Hermione and then slowly added “you can't teach such words to James ".</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"C'mon Artie “cooed Molly “he is too young to remember".</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Oh yeah " mocked Ginny “one of his first words were bugger thanks to his uncle Ron ".</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"What? Me? Harry uses that all the time “complained Ron and everyone laughed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Everyone was so euphoric with the double surprise that they failed to notice why Hermione was unnaturally quiet. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Alcohol flowed and Molly was crying more in happiness. Harry, George and Bill were sharing their stories of tantrums by their respective wives while Ron was listening in horror. Ginny went to her room to tuck James in. No one noticed that Arthur and Hermione had quietly slipped away from the room.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Arthur was impatiently waiting in his workshop. The moment Hermione arrived, he cast a muffliato spell. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So tell me?" He asked impatiently.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If I tell you, it’ll only complicate things “replied Hermione.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"But I need to know, I’m involved in this” said Arthur.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ok, according to the muggle science, the date of conception can be predicted up to a margin of 2 days “said Hermione.” And I had sex with Ron only a week later after we finished the meeting with the muggle prime minister." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Arthur was crestfallen. He just sat on the chair. Not only had he cheated his wife but his own child will be called a grandchild to outside world.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Can't you check who the father is? Don't they have that method “he asked eagerly?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>" No, Arthur" said Hermione " we can't collect the cells until the baby is born to check the DNA, besides I checked with doctor, since you and Ron share 50% of DNA, it might come as a false positive if Ron ever tried that in future".</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Can we just.....” Began Arthur.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just...... “Asked Hermione, he could sense sparks flying from her nose “Say it Arthur ". </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You know....." Stammered Arthur “abort..... ".</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Really? Why should I? “Thundered Hermione.” You think it's that easy, why you didn’t abort any of your children when you had the means to take care of all of them ". </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Arthur stared at the floor; he knew he can't answer this.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Honestly, that was my first thought" sighed Hermione “when I found I was pregnant. I went to the gynecologist and she took an ultrasound to confirm. It was just a tiny clump, looking like a tumor. But I fell in love with that immediately." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, it was a mistake and you know that “interjected Arthur. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, it was fate and I'm not going to kill my baby just because the father regrets after donating the sperm.” Replied Hermione.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What about Ron?" Asked Arthur “you think you are going to spend his entire life believing a lie ". </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Look how happy he is, he had seen my pregnancy tester before I came back from gynecologist. I've told you before that the doctors have certified me as fertile and your son is avoiding every time I raise the issue." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Maybe deep down, he wants to believe it “continued Hermione” and I'm fed up of this "hints" dropped by Molly as if we aren't trying for the past 3 years ".</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Arthur hit himself on his head several times. He will have to live with this all this life and an unborn child is held at stake by the mother.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I've made my decision, Arthur" said Hermione “I’m raising this child. The only choice you have to make is to keep quiet or own up to your deeds. I can rise as a single mom and don't need your support. I'm ready to face the repercussion from the family and media ". </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Telling this, she just stormed out of the room and Arthur was contemplating how his life came to this.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He looked around the room and realized that this is where it happened that fateful night three months ago.</span>
