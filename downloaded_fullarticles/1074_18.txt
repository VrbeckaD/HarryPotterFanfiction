    <p>Bella knew her role. She stood proud and held her hand out for her soon-to-be husband. Black became Lestrange. Soft applause stumbled from the crowd as they wed. Looking over the stone face witnesses she saw he wasn’t here. It was unsurprising but her eyes stung, still she did not cry.</p><p>Bella knew he wouldn’t.</p><p>Bella knew he couldn’t.</p><p>She still believed in what could never be.</p><p>That part of her was just unbroken.</p><p><em>Disgusting. Malformed.</em> She thought about that shameful part of herself. Her new husband took her hand and she did not shutter. A hint of pride puffed in her chest because of this. She could live up to this task from her master.</p><p>Her new husband looked coldly to her. She returned in kind.</p><p>This is right. And she knew it was no matter how much she wanted to scream.</p><p>They danced at arm’s length. The music was a classic piece written by a pure blood. It was probably played at her mother’s wedding and her mother’s as well. A testament to their culture and a reminder of what she was fighting for. Soon the dancing was over and the guest left in small groups.</p><p>She was nearly dragged to her husband’s room.</p><p>Bella undressed in front of her crude husband as he splayed himself out on their bed. Her chin lifted up and she let her bridal robes fall to the floor. Perky young breast drew her husband’s gaze right away. He would soon defile her with his touch and his seed. It was her role in this battle. And she would perform for him with the passion only a true dark witch could. Even if her partner wasn’t <em>him</em> she would play her role as dutiful wife to the pureblood cause.</p><p>She crawled onto the bed and kissed Rodolphus. He, to her luck, put out the candles and in the darkness she had her Dark Lord again.</p>
