    <p>Brisk autumn air blew the dried leaves around, creating a slight scratching noise as the dead plants dragged themselves across the pavement. Tina watched as one took its course, skidding four feet away from her before stopping. She smiled to herself, proud that she could still perform wandless magic. Tina knew she was skilled, it was a given since she was an auror, but often doubted herself. She took a deep breath of the smoke-scented air and exhaled loudly, her chest burning. She wrapped her arms around herself tighter to block out the cold that even her largest grey coat couldn’t contain. Tina fiddled with a rock, bouncing it up and down, before noticing something. </p><p> An image floated in the lovely, liquid depths of her iris, the reflection of a man in a blue overcoat with the collar halfway turned up, wearing a gray and yellow scarf, silhouetted against the clear glass window of the shop he passed. A flash of recognition conspicuously appeared on her face, and all it took was for her chocolate brown eyes to land on the ginger mess that was Newt's hair for her to realize it was him. </p><p> "Newt..." Tina whispered quietly, watching him walk briskly down the leaf-riddled street. "You're here."</p><p> He didn’t notice her, but instead hurried along the street. His case was in hand, being held tightly. Tina watched gleefully as he strolled, too overcome with happiness that he was back to feel or think anything else. The sound of heels hitting the ground seemed to echo throughout the city as she stood and walked toward him. Newt turned down an alleyway, struggling to put his case in both hands as he did so. Tina continued following him. It was a strange parallel to how they’d first met, although she now knew Newt wasn’t a mysterious man who’d inevitably cause mayhem. She turned the corner promptly, only to find Newt struggling with his case in a back corner. “Newt?” She said tentatively, only taking a few steps closer. The niffler had gotten out again, and Newt was attempting to put him back in the case before any further disorder occurred. The creature let out a tiny squeak as it saw her, registering that she was someone he knew. </p><p> “Tina.” Newt’s face showed signs of recognition and relief. Tina grew hopeful, though she didn’t know for what, at the look. “I’m so glad you’re here. I apologize for the improper greeting, but would you help me put the little bugger away? He’s managed to get out again.”</p><p> “Oh… of course,” Tina answered, kneeling down and helping Newt get a steady grip on the squirming niffler. He’s managed to obtain a few jewels, Tina noted when her eyes landed on the small pile of sparkling objects that glimmered underneath him. Newt shook him softly, and a final two pieces of gold fell out. The niffler looked ashamedly at Newt, although he was more put out about losing his precious shiny things than anything else. Tina held the case open and shut it tightly as Newt returned the niffler to the case. They stood up in unison, Newt wiping his hands together and Tina holding the case. “You let that niffler thing out again? Didn’t you learn not to last time?”</p><p> “Tina,” Newt repeated, looking at her everywhere but her eyes. Tina stared back at him and looked, really looked. It had been nearly a year since they’d last seen each other, so there were some significant changes. Tina noted that he looked much older than he had the last time he’d visited. She wondered if it was because of the stress from writing and publishing his book, or something else entirely. His hair had grown longer and wilder, if that was possible. But what Tina noticed the most was how impeccably tired he appeared. </p><p> “Why’re you here?” She asked. It wasn’t exactly what she was aiming for, as it was straightforward and must’ve seemed like she didn’t want him around. Nonetheless, the question was already asked; there was nothing she could do about it. </p><p> “I came to talk about my manuscript, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” Newt explained to her. He didn’t understand why she looked so taken aback. </p><p> Tina was silent for a moment, the words reflecting in her mind. Then she smiled at him. “You chose the title I came up with?” </p><p> “I… suppose I did,” Newt said. He shuffled then, not meeting her eye. Had he? Of course. Her title was exactly what he’d needed. It was something that captured the amazingness of the creatures while also showing that the book was informative. He may have liked it a little extra because she’d come up with it, but he’d never admit to it. </p><p> “Um, are you hungry? We could… go get coffee. Or-or tea, depending on your taste,” Tina suggested hopefully. Her face mirrored the same look she’d given him on the docks as he left. Entirely happy, but under all of that, sad. Newt grew curious as to why she was sad. </p><p> “I’d like that,” he said. Tina smiled and motioned with her head for him to follow her. </p><p> Together they walked down a few stretches of sidewalk, side by side. The sun was starting to warm up the city, so Tina eventually shrugged off her coat and held it over her arm. She saw Newt eyeing something a few feet ahead, and looked at the sign. “Kowalski Bakery.”</p><p> “Newt, do you think it would be wise if-“</p><p> “I think it would be a bit silly to do, but I would very much like to visit our old friend. Even though he won’t remember us…”</p><p> Tina nodded sadly. She’d been able to get over losing her friend quickly, but Queenie has been an entirely different story. Her sister had been utterly devastated and heartbroken for weeks. The bell jingled as her and Newt walked in, the scent of freshly cooked rolls and pastries hitting her nose as soon as she stepped through the doorway. She sighed at the warmth, immediately feeling hungry enough to eat the entire bakery in one sitting. Tina and Newt walked up to the counter, and she admired the intricate designs of the treats. The shapes looked oddly familiar, and it only took Tina a few seconds to register that the food was shaped to look like Newt’s creatures. The rolls looked like nifflers, another looked like the erumpent. She admired them from afar until Jacob came up to them, a jolly smile on his face. “Slow day today, you’re my first visitors. What would you two like?”</p><p> Newt and Tina placed their orders and strolled to a nearby seat where they sat together in silence. Instead of speaking, they both admired the incredible figures that were in front of them. “Jacob’s work is incredible,” Tina mused, taking a bite of the roll she’d ordered. “As is the taste.”</p><p> “Absolutely incredible,” Newt agreed. “If only he could remember us…”</p><p> Newt knew that it could never happen, that muggles couldn’t know about magic in America. If he still felt as melancholy as he did about what’d happened, he could only imagine how Queenie was handling the loss. She’d been the closest with Jacob, so close that neither Tina nor Newt’s accords with him were even eligible to compare. Queenie had known everything about him. She’d known his secrets, his story, his everything. Granted, she knew the same for Newt and Tina, but she was in love with Jacob. Something entirely incomparable with friendship.</p><p> Tina sighed, a sad look on her face. “You know we can’t,” she said, picking at her roll. “MACUSA wouldn’t allow it. Queenie and I… we’d lose our jobs.” </p><p> As if she was on cue, the doorbell jingled again and the younger blonde walked in. Jacob’s entire demeanor changed and he brightened up when he saw her. “Miss Goldstein,” he said, tipping his head in respect. Queenie emitted a giggle, not noticing the two staring at her only a few feet away. That was, until she sensed their thoughts. Queenie turned around hurriedly to face Newt and Tina, who both avoided her eye. </p><p> “Queenie…” Tina said, not knowing what else to say but showing obvious disappointment. “You can’t…”</p><p> “I’m sorry- I can’t help it. Jacob’s just so…” Queenie was also at a loss for words. She’d finally been caught, after spending seven months coming in and out of the bakery to visit him. They were short, rushed visits, just so she could check on him and make sure he was doing alright. Jacob had somehow managed to fall in love with her all over again, something that filled Queenie with a deep sadness. It was forbidden for anything to happen, she knew, and it made her heart ache in a way she’d only ever read in books. </p><p> “Queenie, you know this is highly inappropriate,” Newt said to her, and she glared at him angrily. Seeing Jacob, being caught and Newt being unexpectedly back made her flare up in anger. She was already angry at Newt for leaving so suddenly, for hurting Tina, although unintentionally. Queenie knew exactly how they felt about each other, and it made her feel even more remorseful toward him. However, she knew she was being irrational. She was upset, after calming down she’d be pleased that he was visiting again.</p><p> “What’s highly inappropriate is that you-” </p><p> Jacob cut in, interrupting Queenie’s reply.  “Hey, guys? Is something goin’ on? If it is, I’d rather have you talk it out outside, not in here. It’s bad for business, customers fighting and all.” </p><p> Everyone looked away, a guilty aura in the air. This wasn’t the time nor place for arguing, no matter how bad what Queenie was doing was. She was risking both her and Tina’s careers, something that they both had worked hard on. A bright layer of sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the blonde curls on Queenie’s head, and Jacob felt himself falling back in love. Something was pulling at him, and he had an intense feeling of deja vu regarding the people in front of him. He frowned, and Queenie shuffled nervously, hoping and praying that his memory wouldn’t be recovered.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything,” Newt apologized suddenly, looking toward Queenie. </p><p> Queenie rejected his apology. “No, no, it’s fine, really. I just… didn’t think you’d be here.”</p><p>“Queenie, we have to discuss this,” Tina said, a worried look on her face. “You know you can’t have any relations with no-majs, let alone romantic ones.”</p><p> “But why? Just because he’s a no-maj doesn’t mean we should treat him any differently!” Queenie retorted, but she faltered because any argument she had was invalidated. She knew not to see Jacob, but still did despite her best judgement. </p><p> There was a deafening silence that was accompanied by a heavy feeling in the air. Queenie looked back at Jacob longingly as he tended to another customer, and Tina fiddled with her hands and stared at the swirled designs of the table. The silence was a wall, separating them indefinitely. It was the calm after a storm. </p><p>“I…” Queenie attempted to break the silence. It was quiet, too quiet, and even though she was a legilimens the consistent flow of thoughts and noise had died down to leave her in a lonely abyss. “When did you get back, Newt?”</p><p> </p><p>“Only just this morning, I’ve had an incredibly busy schedule since publishing my book. I would’ve wrote, had I not, but honestly I found myself unable to come up with the words to say,” Newt explained. In all honesty, he truly couldn’t find the words to say. Tina was very important to him and while he felt terrible for not telling her, he knew he’d have been rendered speechless had he seen her waiting for him at the dock. It’s much more satisfying to be greeted unexpectedly than at the docks, when you’re unknowing of what to say, he mused. </p><p>“Newt Scamander, an acclaimed author who couldn’t find the words to say,” Tina quipped lightheartedly.</p><p> Newt sent a look of offense her way. He was still on the edge after the Queenie and Jacob incident, even though it’d only been a minor mishap. Tina realized he didn’t take it as a joke and quickly tried to change the subject.</p><p>“How’re the creatures?” She asked, trying to make it less obvious that she was changing the subject to elude any further mistook statements. Newt, however, didn’t seem to mind, and instead grew excited at the mention of something he was passionate about. A new batch of occamies had just hatched, something exciting not only to him, but hopefully to her as well, given they’d captured the mother only ten months before.</p><p> “Oh, they’re absolutely terrific! There’s new occamy hatchlings. They are a bit more of a handful than I anticipated, but once they fully mature in a few months I’m sure they’ll be much more behaved,” he enthused, much to Tina’s delight. She had always been fascinated by the creatures, even if at the beginning she’d shown distaste for them. It was the mindset she, and plenty of other Americans had been raised with. To be closed-minded. However, unlike her older sister, Queenie was very open-minded and had adored the creatures from the start</p><p> “Oh, that’s lovely, I’d love to see them again. Wouldn’t you, Teenie?” Tina sent a sideways glance toward her sister, unaware that Newt didn’t get Queenie’s blatantly obvious comment. Queenie, however, was only trying to tease her sister. She knew exactly how Tina felt about Newt, despite her consistent protesting of the blonde’s claims. Legilimency had its perks, and being able to read into her sister’s feeling before her sister even knew them was one of them. Queenie never told her, though. She didn’t feel right, going around and telling other people how they felt. It was a learning experience, a way to discover yourself and grow. To interrupt that just to conserve her from the confusion she was facing would be robbery. Robbery of the mind.   “Where are you stayin’?” She asked after receiving the look from Tina. </p><p> “I was just going to find a spot to lay my case down and sleep in it. That makes it much easier to save money, and it’s more time efficient that way,” Newt explained, although what he had said was a lie. He actually didn’t know where he was staying, and had just come up with the idea to lay his case down somewhere on the spot. There’d been no time to make slight arrangements such as where to stay when he was off promoting his book in London. Even the five days it took to travel from England to America were so hectic, he simply didn’t have the time to plan out where he would stay.</p><p> Queenie felt sympathetic toward him. She knew what it was like to be in a strange and unfamiliar place, with only a guide to help you. It reminded her quite a lot of her first week at Ilvermorny. She was in a brand-new place with only Tina to guide her. Queenie’s instinct, and, in part, he legilimency, told her Tina would absolutely love to help Newt navigate New York. She found it her duty to make that happen. “Oh no honey, I don’t think that’s necessary. Teenie and I are perfectly fine with you stayin’ with us,” She said to him, and she could hear Tina scolding her in her mind. Although it was more of her telling Queenie not to embarrass her than anything.</p><p>  Newt was very obviously taken aback by Queenie’s offer. “I couldn’t, I’d be intruding,” he said, eyes flicking between the two sisters before settling on the napkin that had come with his roll. </p><p> “You wouldn’t be intruding! We don’t mind.” Queenie protested, truly concerned that he worried he’d be intruding. Inviting him over wasn’t just for her sister, she would also enjoy new company. While living with her sister was eventful, she couldn’t help but find herself feeling more and more lonely. Her only social transactions were between Tina and her colleagues. She’d include Jacob, but Jacob was only ever gaping at her and their conversations consisted of mere small talk, of him trying to pry any information about her out of her, and Queenie trying to order her food without feeling the familiar heartache she’d grown so accustomed to return. “It’ll be just like old times!”</p><p> Of course, it couldn’t be ‘just like’ old times. They’d spent Newt’s entire visit, aside from the week after, running around New York trying to catch his creatures. In fact, they’d all have to be in terrible danger for it to be old times. Newt knew what Queenie meant, however. He wasn’t stupid. Although he did find himself longing for it to be like it had been before at certain times. While he definitely didn’t miss the prominent danger, like someone imposing as a Congress member, only to be the darkest wizard of the time, and an obscurial reigning terror on the city, he did miss the simplicity that underlied underneath all of that. The genuine friendships that hadn’t yet turned to new and odd feelings. Of course, he cared for his American friends dearly, but he missed when they were just friends and he didn’t feel so confused all the time, regarding his feelings… More specifically, his feelings for Tina.</p><p> Everything seemed to have happened so quickly. One moment he was packing away for his journey back home, the next he was feeling terribly melancholy about leaving. Tina offering to take him to the docks didn’t help the feeling, in fact it made them worse. And then seeing her trying to hide how upset she truly was, and how she tried to hide it, it just made the matter turn downright depressing. He didn’t want to leave. As eager as he was to get to London and deliver his manuscript, he didn’t want to leave his new friends and New York behind. So much had occurred in the week he’d been there, it wasn’t right for him to leave them… leave her, as quickly as he did.</p><p>“But no leaving in the middle of the night,” Queenie added after a moment, waiting for Newt to make up his mind. She wouldn’t feel offended if he didn’t want to stay, just worrisome about him. The city was dangerous, even without Grindelwald imposing as Graves and obscurials running about. It was a city filled with concealed magic and arbitrary culture. A city of light that had a hidden darkness underneath it.</p><p> “I wouldn’t dream of it.”</p><p> Queenie was delighted that Newt wanted to stay with them. “What was it like, returnin’ to London and being considered a hero?” She asked, her curiosity taking the best of her. Despite her best judgement, she wanted to pry and get all of the information she’d wondered about.</p><p> “Incredibly daunting. I don’t know how my brother, Theseus, does it. The worst bit is the press, they’re relentless. The Daily Prophet seemed more interested in my social affairs than my stay here.” Newt knew he’d said too much the moment he’d spoken, for Queenie was undoubtedly searching his mind to know what they’d said now. He remembered what the Prophet’s articles had said, such vulgar, cruel things that weren’t right to say about anyone. The writers disliked him, in which his general distaste for public attention was at fault. It was near impossible to reach him, or to get any statement, so they created falsified stories to make up for the lack of information. Being the Prophet, all of the stories consisted more about the social prospects of his stay than his magizoology studies.</p><p> What really bothered Newt was that the Prophet had somehow gotten a hold of the information concerning who he’d stayed with, including the Goldsteins. Luckily there was no documented information of him being affiliated with Jacob, He could only imagine the things they’d say, piled on with the truly judgemental and wrong things they wrote about him and his companions now. There were rumors, of course. Rumors that he'd only gone to America to be with his “special friend,” and that “special friend” was none other than Queenie. He’d laughed when he recalled this, considering the fact that if  he had a “special friend,” it would’ve been Tina.</p><p> Queenie’s eyes went wide with the thought.</p><p>  “There’s no need to worry, I won’t pry. It’s reassuring to know everything they’d said was falsified anyway,” She said, in consideration of Newt’s sudden worry. </p><p> Tina stood up suddenly and gestured toward the door. It had grow cloudy outdoors, and a smell of oncoming rain tinged the air. “We should head back,” Tina said, looking at the two of them pointedly. “It’s going to storm soon. I figure if we get back we’ll miss it.”</p><p> Newt nodded in agreement and turned to face Queenie, who seemed to have dazed off. He turned back to face Tina, who sighed and shook her head. Queenie was still coveting over Jacob, it was as clear as a midsummer’s day. “Queenie?”</p><p> “What- oh, sure, I think that’s right, we should be headin’ back home now…” she said, hands reaching out and grabbing her bag. She didn’t meet anyone’s eyes as she did so, only glancing back once more at Jacob before making an obviously fake positive expression toward the two and following them out the door.</p>
