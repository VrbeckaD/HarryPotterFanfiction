  <em>Pain was shooting through her neck and face. There was yelling. Jeering. A hand holding her head down. Something red was in her eyes. It won't stop.</em>

  <strong>
    <u>The Underground City</u>
  </strong>
</p><p>The feeling of her hair being pushed out of the way and fingers touching her neck brought Titania out of her mind. Whipping her head around she took in her surroundings. She was sitting in a small booth, against the wall. Candles shed dim light on the wooden walls of the tavern, The Lion's Den. All sorts of shady people were sitting at the various tables, drinking alcohol and making their criminal deals. On the far side, near the bar, a fight had broken out between two men. Based on their size it looked like they used to live on the surface, people who grew up in the underground tended to be much smaller than surface dwellers. Several people were cheering them on as one man hacked the others chest up with a knife, the thing that had sent Titania into her memories.</p><p>Looking to her right her bright green eyes met steely blue. Levi. His fingers were still under the red curls that fell over her shoulders. Ever so slowly he moved his hand so his palm rested against the jagged scars she used her hair to conceal, his thumb laying against the scar that curled behind her right ear. "You're thinking about it again."</p><p>Suddenly her eyes wouldn't look at him.Instead she stared down at the plate they had in front of them, now clean of all its food. They had been doing well for themselves recently so they had gotten the biggest meal the tavern served. A steak with mashed potatoes and a bread roll. Everything on the plate had been divided in half and pushed onto each side of the plate, the same thing with every meal they had. They had each also ordered a cup of tea, black.</p><p>"No I'm not."</p><p>"Yes, you are. I know the look you get when you do." He glanced over to where the fight had been. The man who had just been cut up, now a lifeless corpse, was being dragged out of the building. The other man, looking exceptionally proud of himself, had already ordered another drink without even cleaning the blood off his face. "We can find another place to eat after this. This happens way to much."</p><p>"This is the best place to eat around here, Levi. Everywhere else is worse than it is here."</p><p>Suddenly his hand was on the other side of her neck. He pulled so her forehead bumped against his shoulder for a second before letting go. "Then we'll cook ourselves. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out."</p><p>Then they sat there in silence, finishing their drinks. Both of them were holding the cups by their rims, a habit they had developed around the time Titania started hanging around Levi. Usually the red head would be chattering on about something, anything to fill the silence, but now she was just soaking up the warmth that Levi was providing as their shoulders brushed together. And Levi didn't try to force her into conversation. It always irked him when she wasn't as high spirited as she usually was, but he knew that she wasn't in the mood for talking. He had been with her through enough flashbacks to know how things went afterwards.</p><p>Once they finished with their tea, it didn't take long since they preferred it hot instead of warm, they both stood up. They were making there way to the door, Titania following closely behind Levi, when they managed to pick one voice out of the many floating around the room. "I am looking for Titania Adler."</p><p>Both of their heads whipped around when they heard that. Standing over by the bar was a tall man, obviously from the surface world, wearing dark robes. His black hair was greasy and his nose hooked. He looked thoroughly unimpressed with his surroundings, of course he could just have a resting villain face. He didn't look particularly dangerous, but people probably thought the same thing about Levi and Titania considering how small they were.</p><p>Green eyes met blue, and Levi nodded. Focusing on the greasy haired man, Titania cast her mind out. But in her attempt to read the mans mind, something she had no idea how she could do, she effectively hit a wall as solid as the stone walls of the underground. Once she did it was as if she had called the mans attention to her. He immediately turned to face her, as if she were a beacon. She saw his eyes widen slightly and he hesitated.</p><p>Next thing she knew Levi had grabbed her hand and dragged her through the swinging doors of the tavern. The two started running through the streets, moving around back alleys. They weren't sure if the man had followed him because they weren't looking back. In their experience looking back was the best way to get caught. They were just focusing on everything in front of them. Making sure they knew where they were going. It would be bad if they lost track of where they were and turned into a dead end.</p><p>Suddenly there was a loud crack, like a gunshot. As soon as the sound registered in her mind Titania felt Levi pull her down to the ground. Once there the slightly taller boy curved his body over her, holding her head to his chest. It had become a reflex for them after an incident two years ago when Titania had been hit by a stray bullet from a firefight. It hadn't hit any vital organs, arteries or veins, but ever since then Levi would instinctively shield her if he heard a gun discharge, no matter how much she complained about it.</p><p>They were only in that position for a few seconds before they were both hauled up by the arms. It was the greasy haired man, and he was staring intently at Titania's face. So intently that he didn't notice Levi give her a firm nod. At that they both drew their knives and in swift motions cut into the flesh of the hands holding their arms. The mans eyes widened as he quickly released both of them. Without hesitation Titania flipped her knife into the reverse hold Levi had taught her before ripping it through the mans thigh, twisting it around violently to do more damage before tearing it out at a different angle than the way it went in. She watched as he dropped to one knee. She wasn't sure if it was the shock of everything that had made the man buckle so quickly or if he truly was a wimp, but she didn't have the time to wonder about it. As soon as the man was down Levi grabbed her hand once again and they were running back the way they had come. People in the street didn't seem to care about the teenager and child carrying bloody knives, which was all the better for them. If they were really lucky people would go see if they could scavenge off of a corpse. That would keep the man busy if he could still support himself on his leg.</p><p>They ran for a good amount of time before they found themselves back at the house they lived in. Levi had lived in it with Kenny, a serial killer that had taken him in, and had continued living there when Kenny left him one day. It wasn't long after Kenny left that Titania became part of Levi's life.</p><p>Once they were inside they barricaded the door, moving a chair in front of the door and placing the heaviest items they had on the chair.</p><p>After they were convinced they were safe Levi turned to Titania, while pulling out a rag to clean his blade. "What did you find?"</p><p>Cleaning her own blade, Levi's habits had influenced her greatly over five years of living with him, green eyes stared down at the ratty black boots she was wearing. "Nothing. It was like he had a wall built around his mind. I've never felt something like that before."</p><p>She heard Levi walk across the room, seemingly unphased by this revelation. "Huh, maybe I should've had a chat with the man. At the very least I could've figured out how to keep you out of my head." His voice was flat when he said that, but Titania knew what it was. A friendly jab that Levi thought would make her feel better. Levi seemed cold and unwelcoming on the outside. And if anyone got on the inside he would still be cold and unwelcoming. Except when it came to Titania. She was convinced that she was the only person to ever see him smile.</p><p>Glancing at the small clock on the table, Levi gestured for the red head to follow him. "Come on, Tani. After all that I think we deserve to sleep a little early."</p><p>That night Titania stayed with Levi in his bed, just like when she had first moved in with him. She had pressed herself firmly against him, arms around his waist, legs around one of his and face against his neck. He rested one of his arms around her as well, face hidden in her hair. Despite everything he felt like it had been a good day.</p>

  <strong>
    <u>Hogwarts</u>
  </strong>
</p><p>Severus Snape was muttering to himself as he limped his way through the front doors of Hogwarts. His mood had already been rather sour because it was time for the professors to go out and make introductions for the muggle born students that had been accepted into their school, and it had only gone downhill after everything he had just experienced. It had been sheer luck that the girl, Titania Adler, had been in the establishment he went into. He was convinced that Dumbledore wanted to annoy him by assigning the the toughest child to find. The address on the letter was the vaguest address he could possibly have.</p><p>
  <strong>Ms.T Adler</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>The Underground City</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Eldia</strong>
</p><p>Because of that he decided to ask for help in what looked to be a popular pub. He had asked the man behind the bar about the girl, but before he got an answer he felt a probing mind slam into his occlumency walls with all the force of a mountain troll swinging its club down on its victims. When he turned to find the source he was greeted by a ghost from the past.</p><p>Now he would have to deal with this on top of the Potter boy coming to school.</p><p>"Severus!" The voice drew his attention to the top of the staircase where he found three stunned faces. Minerva dropped the books she was holding and she came rushing down the stairs with Pomona and Filius hot on her heels. Once she had reached him she reached out and snatched up his wrists so she could examine his hands while Filius peered at his leg. "How did this happen?"</p><p>"It would seem," He paused to hiss as the small professor poked at the jaggedly torn flesh on his thigh. "That Ms.Adler does not trust authority figures."</p><p>Three sets of eyes stared at him for a moment. "A child did this to you?"</p><p>"Two children." Severus once again started to limp his way through the hall, now with Minerva's powerful grip steering him in the direction of the Hospital Wing. "She had a boy with her. I was asking people where I could find her since the address on the letter wasn't specific enough. Well, she and her friend overheard me say her name. It quickly went downhill."</p><p>"So they just attacked you for no reason?" Pomona was following along with Filius, both of them holding the books the transfiguration teacher had dropped, and she stared at Severus with wide eyes.</p><p>"No, they initially tried to run away. This happened when I grabbed their arms."</p><p>They were now in front of the Madam Pomfrey's domain, ready to sacrifice the potions professor to the nurse. Minerva opened the door for the man, she didn't want him to do it with his injured hands, before she stuttered out a sentence. "I-I'll go... ask Albus what he wants to do about this." She pushed Severus through the opening before closing the door, leaving him to suffer his fate alone.</p>
