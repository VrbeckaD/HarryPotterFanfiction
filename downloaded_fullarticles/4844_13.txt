    <p align="center"><strong>Desiderium</strong> <em>: An ardent desire or longing, particularly for something once had; grief or regret for the absence or loss of something or someone. </em></p><p align="center">*****</p><p align="center">“Invisible threads are the strongest ties.”</p><p align="center">-Friedrich Nietzsche</p><p>The day was overcast and atypically cool for early September, but the gray clouds did little to dampen Isra’s spirits.</p><p>“Make sure to write every weekend! And if you ever need to…” Isra blocked out her Mum’s instructions as she repeated them for the hundredth time since they had arrived at King’s Cross.</p><p>“I know Mum,” Isra placated, biting the inside of her cheek to keep from snapping.</p><p>“Yeah, don’t you worry about nothing,” Hasan, her older brother, reassured, dropping a heavy arm around her shoulder, which Isra tried and failed to shrug off. “I’ll keep this shrimp safe, on my Gryffindor honor!”</p><p>“You two should probably board now,” Dad spoke up. Unlike Mum he wasn’t overly affectionate or anxious, and looked like he wanted this whole ordeal to be over. Isra agreed.</p><p>“I suppose so…” Mum whispered, tears gathering once more in her already red-rimmed eyes. Stepping forward, she enveloped her two children in a monstrously tight bear hug before finally stepping back and wiping her eyes with an embroidered handkerchief. “I love you, be good!”</p><p>Isra could not help but become a little emotional herself at her Mum’s goodbye, despite being overly eager to board the train and begin her journey, and felt her throat tightened.</p><p>“I will, I love you Mum,” she said hoarsely. To her Dad, she turned and raised an eyebrow. “Uh, bye Dad.”</p><p>He smiled and gave her a thumb up, “Bye!”</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she turned and followed Hasan, who was already jubilantly making his way down the corridor, greeting what seemed like every person on board.</p><p>“Oi, keep up, would you?” he shouted back at her, pausing momentarily for her to catch up. Isra huffed and hurried up a bit, catching up to him.</p><p>“Now don’t be nervous, I know you’ll be surrounded by third year Gryffindor blokes, but us Gryffindor men are renowned for our chivalry,” he boasted, as he finally came to stop outside the last compartment of the train.</p><p>“May Merlin himself protect me from other men if what you are is considered a gentleman,” Isra growled, already dreading the long journey trapped between her brother and his equally idiotic friends.</p><p>“Uh yeah, about that, can you like not talk like a freak and pretend to be normal 11 years old in front of my friends?” he asked, rounding on her with crossed arms. “The last thing I need are rumors that I’m from a family of weirdos.”</p><p>Isra just rolled her eyes once more and did not bother giving him an answer of any form. Hasan seemed to get the message because he turned around and opened the door and entered the compartment.</p><p>Isra followed him and was instantly deafened by whoops and hollers.</p><p>“Oi Sharif!” a boy who Isra recognized as Chad yelled. “You’ve grown like three inches-that’s more than your dick!”</p><p>“HEY,” Hasan shouted, momentarily silencing everyone. “My <em>kid</em> sister will be riding with us, so let’s show her some Gryffindor decency, yeah?”</p><p>The third-year Gryffindor boys seemed to only now take in her presence, and a variety of sheepish looks crossed their faces.</p><p>“Oh, um, hi,” a dark-skinned boy got up and extended his hand towards her. “I’m Darren Thomas, nice to meet you.”</p><p>“Likewise,” Isra greeted back, placing her hand in his to give an appropriate shake. “I look forward starting a new school year with all of you as my peers.”</p><p>“<em>Oh. My. God!</em>” Hasan whined. “What did I say about talking normally?”</p><p>“How was that abnormal?” Isra bit back, angry that he continued to insult her personality.</p><p>“Well to be fair, it sounded like you memorized it from a book or something,” another boy who Isra also recognized as Arnold Weasley spoke up.</p><p>“Ignore them, they’re just mad they can’t sound pretentious like that,” a blonde boy said to her with what was supposed to be a friendly smile. “I’m Hank Longbottom.”</p><p>Not bothering to point out that he too had pretty much insulted her, she just gave him a tight smile and wedged herself in a spot between the door and Hasan. About fifteen minutes later all the boys had given up on trying to engage her in conversation and had gone back to their rambunctious attitudes.</p><p>After having to duck her brother’s elbow from crashing into her temple for about the fourth time, Isra decided that she had reached her limit for male idiocy for the day and quickly stood up.</p><p>“I’ll be in the compartment across the corridor if you’ll need me,” she said to Hasan quickly, not bothering to wait for his reply. She sighed in relief when she stepped outside and their voices were instantly muffled.</p><p>Walking across the corridor to the last compartment, Isra did not bother knocking; it was unlikely that anyone was back there, especially considering her loud her brother and his friends were being.</p><p>She, however, was immediately proven wrong when she slid open the door.</p><p>There, seated alone was a dark-haired boy who looked around her age, features silhouetted by the gray light that leaked in from the windows to his side. His clothes looked worn and threadbare, and his posture was rigid.</p><p>Realizing that she had been staring, Isra blinked rapidly before asking in her most polite tone, “May I sit here?”</p><p>“I suppose,” he answered, turning back to look out the window, seemingly bored with her already.</p><p>Isra frowned at his dismissal, but took a seat anyways; it would do no good to have Hasan and his boisterous crew looking for her when she wasn’t where she said she would be.</p><p>She instantly disliked the boy across from her, his very presence was…unsettling.</p><p>The silence between them grew so heavy, it felt very nearly suffocating, so Isra spoke up once more, despite her uneasiness.</p><p>“I’m Isra Sharif, a first-year,” she introduced herself, waiting for his response.</p><p>He turned his neck to look at her and Isra finally caught sight of what color his eyes were: she had no idea. She supposed the closest color to describe them would have been a blue, so dark that it was nearly black. She had not known before that such an eye color existed.</p><p>“Tom Riddle,” he said quietly. “I’m a first-year as well.”</p><p>His tone and gaze was too direct to chalk him off as shy, Isra noted. No, there was something peculiar about Tom.</p><p>“Riddle,” she repeated. “I don’t seem to recognize it, are you a muggle-born?”</p><p>His neutral expression shifted as he frowned, “Muggle-born?”</p><p>“Oh,” Isra breathed. “It’s um…terminology used in the wizarding community in reference to people who don’t have magic. Sometimes these non-magical people, Muggles, have children who <em>can</em> do magic, who are referred to as Muggle-born.”</p><p>“And you, are you a Muggle-born?” he asked, his gaze sweeping over her as he took in her every detail.</p><p>“No, I’m a Pureblood,” she told him without any pride or arrogance. Her family did not support the pureblood supremacy in any form. “I’m actually from the ‘Sacred 28’, but I don’t think that’s anything important.”</p><p>“But some people do?” he edged on, his eyes taking on a tune of intensity she had never seen in someone her age.</p><p>“I suppose…it’s mostly the Slytherin house that believes the Pureblood supremacy rubbish,” she answered, growing uncomfortable under the weight of his gaze.</p><p>“Ah, since you don’t know any of this, you’re a Muggle-born then,” she concluded as she pieced together all the parts of their conversation. “Don’t worry, I won’t judge you for that.”</p><p>“I was born into an orphanage and have been raised there my entire life,” he said in a voice that made her stomach drop in pity. “I don’t know my lineage.”</p><p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” she finally managed to say. Throughout her childhood, she had read countless books chronicling the lives of orphans, but she had never met an actual orphan until now. “But it’s all right, lineage does not define you, it is your actions and accomplishments that does.”</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at that. “I suppose,” he said, an echo of the first sentence he had uttered to her.</p><p>There were a few moments of amicable silence, when the door slid open and the trolley woman greeted them.</p><p>Realizing that he must not have much pocket money, and probably didn’t even know what most of the items in the cart were, she gave him a sincere smile and said, “Let me treat you to some candy, a payment for keeping me company.”</p><p>“That isn’t necessary,” he told her, but Isra ignored him and proceeded to buy a rather large stash of candies. She was renowned by her family for her sweet tooth anyways.</p><p>“It’s no fun eating alone,” she told him, holding out a chocolate frog for him to take. He stared at her proffered hand for a few moments, and just when Isra was about to retract her hand in embarrassment, he reached forward to take the frog, his fingertips just barely brushing against hers.</p><p>The slight contact, however, was enough to make her gasp, and suddenly it was as if her sense of self was violated by his, waves of his what could only be cosmic energy crashing into her; it was as if his very aura was seeping into her, filling into her skin and stretching it with dread. The room in her vision stretched and darkened, its very axis tilting as her entire paradigm of autonomy was shifted to include Tom-the sudden invasion so harrowing, she very nearly threw up.</p><p>“Are you alright?” he inquired, looking more inconvenienced than concerned.</p><p>Isra forced herself to nod, but all she could really process was that she could <em>feel</em> who he was and what she felt was…scary.</p><p>“Just…some motion sickness,” she forced herself to say, wanting to both jump out of the compartment to get away from him and the suffocation associated, and to stay, to find out just what on Earth was happening to her.</p><p>He shrugged and took a bite of the chocolate frog, reading the trading card intently.</p><p>“Albus Dumbeldore,” he said without preamble, flipping the card to show her Dumbledore’s picture on it. “I met him, once.”</p><p>“Oh?” Isra asked breathlessly, forcing herself to not sway away from the waves of dark energy coming from Tom by clenching her fists tightly. “He’s the head of my brother’s house, supposed to be a really nice guy.”</p><p>“Hm,” was all Tom’s reply. “And which house do you wish to be sorted into?”</p><p>Isra blinked at his sudden curiosity concerning her. “Well, I’d like to be sorted into Ravenclaw, I think I would be most challenged academically there.”</p><p>Her body’s reaction to his presence was no longer so violent, and settled more as a discomforting itch deep within her bones. Perhaps she really was just becoming ill?</p><p>“And you?” Isra asked him. “Do you know which house you’d like to be in?”</p><p>“Whichever house makes me the greatest Wizard to have existed,” he said solemnly.</p><p>Despite her uneasiness, Isra could not help but giggle softly at that, “You sound like a model Slytherin.”</p><p>“The house of prejudice?” he asked without any teasing in his voice.</p><p>“The house of ambition,” she replied honestly. “I wouldn’t mind being a Slytherin, but at the moment I’m more interested in learning as much as I can, without worrying too much about its applications.”</p><p>“What’s the point of learning something if not to apply it?” he asked her, the candy stash lay completely forgotten beside her.</p><p>“Well you certainly need to learn the applications,” she argued. “But to study something only in hopes of exclusively using it later limits your mindset.”</p><p>“A set mind is a focused one.”</p><p>“A closed mind is a small one.”</p><p>Tom crossed his arms and shook his head, taking in everything that had just been spoken. “I believe there is some merit to your word, to become a great Wizard, I must have an extremely extensive knowledge on every subject.”</p><p>Isra smiled, but could not help but feel as if she had made a mistake speaking this all to Tom. She brushed it off to the fact that she simply did not want to be housemates with him.</p><p>The door suddenly slammed open, and in popped Hasan.</p><p>“Oi, it’s time to robe up!” he bellowed. “Ohhh, who is this, your boyfriend?”</p><p>Isra instantly colored at his incredulous accusation--could he not feel the darkness oozing out of him?!</p><p>“Hasan!” she hissed in both fury and embarrassment. “Can you please behave yourself?”</p><p>Hasan, completely ignoring her, stalked over to Tom and stood in front of him, chest puffed out and hands on his hips, “Listen, I don’t care that you look like Count Dracula Jr., you try anything fancy with my sister and I’ll hex you so hard your Mama will feel it.”</p><p>Isra gasped at his insolence, but before she could move to do anything, Hasan raised a hand and struck himself across the face, <em>hard</em>.</p><p>“What the-?” Hasan spluttered, his cheek turning an angry red.</p><p>“Now now, what you said was rude, but there’s no need to be violent about it,” Tom said in a diplomatic voice.</p><p>Rushing over to take Hasan by the arm, she pulled him out of the compartment before he did something else stupid.</p><p>“It was nice meeting you, Tom,” Isra lied in a rush as she ushered a dazed Hasan out.</p><p>She heard no reply as she slid the door shut and turned to face her brother, who’s eyes finally seemed to be refocusing.</p><p>“Isra, I swear…I wasn’t going to hit him <em>or </em>me, but I,” he trailed off, tentatively touching his cheek with his fingertips.</p><p>Isra only pursed her lips and looked away. Now that she was away from him, the itch in her bones and subsided, but a new feeling had replaced it: anxiety.</p><p>“I know Hasan,” she said soothingly, rubbing his arm comfortingly. “He can…have an effect on a person like that.”</p><p>She did not try to free herself from his grasp when he took her underneath his arm and led her back to his compartment.</p><p>“Stay away from him, OK?”</p><p>Isra nodded.</p><p>She did not have to be told twice.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="right"> </p>
