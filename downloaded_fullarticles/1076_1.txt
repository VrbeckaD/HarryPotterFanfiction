  <u> <strong>Battle of Hogwarts: 2nd May 1998</strong> </u>
</p><p align="left">‘You bitch!’</p><p>Hermione missed Bellatrix’s killing curse by a split second as she dived to her side and crashed into a pile of broken down furniture. She ignored the pain of the impact as she steadily collected herself off the ground and stood up once more to face the maniacal witch before her. Bellatrix was standing around fifteen feet away from her, and she looked like an infernal incarnation of some form. Dressed head to toe in black, her unruly black hair was spread around her head like a demonic halo, and her eyes were filled with pure and unadulterated bloodlust. She observed how Bellatrix’s dilated pupils engulfed her eyes in black pools of darkness, contrasting starkly with her deathly pale skin. If Bellatrix weren’t so abominable, she might even be beautiful. </p><p>Panic stricken, Hermione looked around at the chaotic evil that surrounded her. The Room of Requirement was barely recognisable. Harry and Ron were both fighting a Death Eater each – Harry against Dolohov, and Ron against Mulciber – and other friends were helping too. She felt a cold hand clamp itself on her heart. The cries of the wounded resounded loudly in her ears. If she closed her eyes, she could see the terrible sights of the Great Hall, and how the place she had once called home had turned into a cemetery.</p><p>Bellatrix looked formidable. Her heavily lidded eyes were black as night, the thrill of the chase and the intoxication of dark magic rife within them. Hermione sensed the dark witch’s magic lunge for her and furiously rip at her skin.</p><p>Hermione swallowed and managed to back away from Bellatrix, who was sporting a demented smile that fitted her face – her mad, rotten face – so well.</p><p>'Give it to me!'</p><p>Hermione’s grasp on the object in her bloodied hand tightened. It was Ravenclaw's diadem. She had almost died to protect the wretched thing, and there was no way in Hell she was going to give it up.</p><p>The sound of Ron’s screams swiftly brought Hermione out of her stupor. She looked over to her right in time to see Ron narrowly miss a c<em>ruciatus</em>. Luckily, Harry had pulled him out of the way just in time. Fear gripped Hermione as she realised that all three of them would most likely die tonight.</p><p>Her attention snapped to the diadem in her hands. <em>All this carnage</em>, Hermione wanted to scream, <em>for a bloody tiara. </em>Her thumb rubbed against its smooth texture, the diadem cold against her clammy hand. As she did so, she felt a jolt of energy spread through her like wildfire. Shaking, she raised her wand at the monster in front of her.</p><p><em>Sectumsempra</em>, she thought furiously, her sweaty brow furrowed in concentration. Her magic channelled itself through her wand and sped towards Bellatrix in a stream of crimson, hitting her squarely in the chest. Bellatrix screamed as her hands attempted in vain to cover the gaping bloody hole that was now forming in her chest. It had been her first completely successful hit in half an hour.</p><p>Instead of crumbling to the ground, however, Hermione watched in awe and horror as Bellatrix’s bloodcurdling screams turned into hysterical laughter. Cackling with perverse glee, Bellatrix used a hand to smear her entire face with her own blood, and proceeded to lick her lips. Hermione wretched.</p><p>‘Mmm,’ Bellatrix grinned, a deranged smile forming on her face. ‘I do love the taste of blood. Reminds me I’m <em>alive</em>.’ She quickly waved her wand over her gaping hole, and the blood soon congealed; although Hermione noted with somewhat short-lived satisfaction that the hole wasn’t fully closing. <em>Snape had his uses</em>, Hermione thought darkly. She closed her eyes for a split second and tried to calm her raging magic down. She expertly channelled her emotions – although by Merlin was it <em>hard</em> – and concentrated her power into her wand.</p><p><em>Confringo</em>, Hermione thought as she slashed her wand through the air. Bellatrix’s grin soon vanished as she blocked the spell and retaliated with a string of dark curses that would have made lesser witches fall to the ground dead.</p><p>‘Now,’ snarled Bellatrix, as the two witches continued throwing curses at each other and evading them with considerable skill, ‘I won’t ask you again. Give. Me. That. <em>Diadem.’</em></p><p>‘Dream on,’ Hermione bit out.</p><p>A shadow passed over Bellatrix’s face. In that moment, Hermione forgot she was in the presence of another human being. It was incredible, looking at the effects of malice so twisted and mangled that it was something <em>beyond </em>evil. There was a lust for destruction and death that rivalled the Dark Lord’s.</p><p>‘Then,’ Bellatrix whispered softly, although her voice carried through the noises emitted by her fellow classmates as they fought with others, ‘I shall have to force your hand.’</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened as she saw Bellatrix raise her wand and wave it in a horribly familiar motion. Hermione recognised it as the <em>Obliquo</em> curse. If it reached its target, the curse would cause her limbs to spasm and twist unnaturally - it was like the <em>Cruciatus</em>, but more localised.</p><p><em>'</em><em>Praesidio tenebris!</em>’ Hermione screamed. She felt the power of Bellatrix’s curse smash heavily against her shield, causing her almost to topple over. Sweat dripped from her forehead as she gripped her wand with all the strength she had left. </p><p>It was at that moment that Hermione caught sight of it. There, in the corner of the Room, a few feet away from where they were fighting and covered in dust, was the Vanishing Cabinet that Malfoy had used in their sixth year to smuggle his demented aunt and all of her friends into Hogwarts.</p><p>To her astonishment, it was still very much intact, despite all the curses being flung around it. An idea instantly came to her. If she could get to it, she might be able to vanish to safety and destroy the Horcrux without interruption. This, of course, was all predicated on the idea that the Vanishing Cabinet was in perfect working condition and wouldn’t trap Hermione in a perpetual void of nothingness.</p><p>Hermione’s eyes darted from Bellatrix to the Vanishing Cabinet. Could she make it? It was close, but Bellatrix was regaining speed and energy, despite the ugly gash still visible on her chest. <em>How is that even possible, </em>Hermione thought irately as she watched Bellatrix throw a hoard of curses her way, which she dodged just in time.</p><p>She had to make a decision now. Bellatrix's strength was regaining.</p><p>‘You filthy Mudblood!’ Bellatrix shrieked. ‘How dare you touch that which the Dark Lord covets? You. Will. PAY!’</p><p>The Avada Kedavra missed Hermione by an inch.</p><p>It was now or never.</p><p>Hermione brandished her wand in one fluid motion and cast her mind on the spell she had invented in sixth year. It was a nifty little spell and wouldn’t ordinarily be suited to the rage of war, but what it lacked in raw power it made up in cleverness.</p><p>
  <em>Dearmo ab aspectu.</em>
</p><p>Hermione noted in satisfaction at Bellatrix’s momentary confusion. The spell tricked its victim into perceiving more than one version of the person who'd cast it, and would magically divert their attention to the replica. Bellatrix's eyes kept slipping from the real Hermione to her "doppelgänger", although Hermione noticed Bellatrix was doing well at retaining a significant amount of her concentration on the real version. </p><p>Hermione took her chance. She leapt towards the Vanishing Cabinet, and yanked the door open. As soon as she entered, the diadem began to scald Hermione's hand. Wincing in pain, she looked down and saw in horror that the Horcrux had started to emit a black smoke-like entity inside the cabinet. It eventually grew so thick that it had completely clouded Hermione's sight. She could sense its evil surrounding and choking her.</p><p>Then the cabinet began to shake. The last thing Hermione saw through the smoke was the sight of Bellatrix running towards her in fury. Hermione quickly slammed the door shut before Bellatrix could reach her.</p><p>‘No! Stop!’ Bellatrix screamed as she tore open the Vanishing Cabinet with a force of dark magic. But it was no use.</p><p>Hermione had vanished.</p>
