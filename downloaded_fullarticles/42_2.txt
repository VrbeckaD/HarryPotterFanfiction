    <p>“And this way is your office —”  Percy is explaining as they round a corner. It's her first day of the job at the DOMC — Department of Magical Creatures. She’s been wanting to work here since she started B.A.R.F. Now, it’s happening.</p><p> </p><p>They turn the corner, and she smacks right into someone coming the opposite way.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” she says, and looks into his face.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi,” he says, and something in his eyes makes her think this is the most off-guard she’ll ever see him. He hadn't known she was working, or if he had, he hadn't been expecting to see her.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi,” she half-whispers back.</p><p> </p><p>“Ms. Granger, I’m so sorry,” Percy apologises profusely, “I —”</p><p> </p><p>“Percy, it’s fine.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agreed,'' Draco— Malfoy says “Good to see you, Granger.”</p><p> </p><p>“And you.” Malfoy walks past them, continuing on his course.</p><p> </p><p>“Honestly, if I had known —” Percy rushes to apologise again.</p><p> </p><p>“Really, Percy, it’s okay. The war is behind us now.” Hermione says, then clears her throat and announces briskly, “Let's go.” Percy marches off down the corridor, and Hermione tries to not to remember. She fails.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It was night, and she could hear everyone clattering around distantly, on the lower floors. She wasn't meant to be there, but she had to. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> There was something about him, about him when he waited in the square for seven hours without moving. Something about him when they finally went out, and then dragged him in, limp like a rag doll, with that glassy half-smile on his face, with the dull look on his eyes. He seemed dead, that was it. It seemed like they'd killed him, and there's nothing that she wanted more than to see what that was like. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She’d crept in like a robber, making sure she wasn't seen, wasn't heard. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Once she was inside, she just froze. She stood at the door and wondered if he'd acknowledge her, the one staring at the wall. After a moment, he moved, swung upwards to stare at her, like the marionettist had realised she was looking. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Granger,” and his voice is thin. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Hi,” she blurts out, suddenly feeling self conscious, “I — I’m sorry to be here, bu —” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Did they send you?” he looks sick. Hermione's aunt had cancer, and he looks like she did, with hi skin and his eyes and just the way his cheeks are hollowed. There's a terrible look people get when they are sick. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Who?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Order.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “No. I’m here on my own.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> He smiles, and smiling in itself is a nice act. You smile, and it means you're happy, which means you're having a nice time, but with Malfoy, it’s more like a snarl, with a mocking edge in his narrowed eyes. “Gryffindor Granger never could leave well alone, could you?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She swallows, and crosses her hands. “Why are you here?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> His face where it’s turned towards her, seems to break. “I — I,” he shivered violently, his spine rolling up and down, “I didn't know what I was getting into. Voldemort — he lived in my house,” he bends his head and starts to cry. “He lived in my house.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Hermione watches him and doesn't know what to say, “I'm sorry,” and her voice comes out quiet, like a mouse. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You lot are always sorry,” and he’s crying now, tears running down his cheeks, “always sorry, but you never fix it.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She couldn't handle that. The sudden attacks of her beliefs so suddenly, how it wasn't trying to be an attack. She’d left, along the hallway, down the stairs into the room she shared with Ginny, the one thankfully empty right now. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She tried to breathe, and put her hand over her heart, and wondered what the fuck was wrong with her, the fuck she was thinking. </em>
