    <p>Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or Hellboy.<br/>A/N: For those who have already read this chapter, I am just fixing some mistakes me and my kindle made. No new stuff in this chapter.</p><p>	Nuada strolled through Surrey on a foggy night, heading toward the sound of a swing squeaking in the distance. He knew that was a strange occurrence at this time of night, children were usually in bed. He kept walking until he came to a bent fence around a playground worthy of being condemned. He looked to see a short person with long midnight black hair sitting on a swing near the end. The figure stopped as Nuada walked up to them from behind.<br/>	"What are you doing it here so late young one?" The figure got up and turned around, revealing a teen boy with aristocratic features and luminescent emerald green eyes.<br/>	"You say that as if you're much older than I. You don't look a day over 20." He said with a smile. "Then again, I suppose being an elf does that to a person." Nuada took a step back.<br/>	"How did you know what I am?" The boy tilted his head to the side.<br/>	"I'm a wizard. I learned about you elves in school. Mostly the story about the truce between elves and humans. What's your name?" Nuada was intrigued. He hadn't really bothered to interact with wizards. They were human, mostly, so he avoided them. Any info he had on them came from the goblins in Gringotts.<br/>	"My name is Nuada Silverlance. Yours?" The boy's eyes went wide.<br/>	"Th...The Prince?" Nuada chuckled. <br/>	"Yes. But if you have read about the truce, you know that I exiled myself. Now, your name?" The boy visibly collected himself before answering.<br/>	"Harry Potter, your Highness." Now this name he had heard.<br/>	"The Boy-Who-Lived?" This made the boy- Harry- scowl. "Don't like the name then?" Another face.<br/>	"Not in the least. But what brings you to Surrey? Not a very exciting place." Harry said, sitting cross-legged on the ground, Nuada moved to do the same.<br/>	"I was just passing through when I heard you on the swing. I'm heading to Bethmora in Ireland." Harry nodded in understanding, then got a far off look in his eyes.<br/>	"What is it like? Bethmora, I mean." Nuada's eyes went wide before he smiled and started telling Harry of what Bethmora was like before the Golden Army was created, making Harry look wistful. Then Nuada sighed.<br/>	"Now it has a sickness upon it, and itâ€™s my fault. I begged my father to let the goblins build the Army, and now our land is cursed." Harry gave him a look of sympathy, making Nuada want to change the subject.<br/>"How old are you Harry?" <br/>	"I'm 16. I'll be 17 next week on the 31st. That's of age in the Wizarding World. I can't wait till I can leave." This got Nuada's attention.<br/>	"What do you mean?" Harry shifted nervously, looking anywhere but at the Elf in front of him.<br/>	"After my parents died, I was sent to live with my aunt and uncle. They... Hate me. Hate me for my magic. Merlin! They probably would have hated me anyway. They treat me like a slave. So I can't wait to leave when I'm 17." This information made Nuada angry.<br/>	"What's stopping you from leaving now? It's only a week." Harry grimaced.<br/>	"And go where? Dumbledore will find me if I go to the Wizarding World. Not that I want to go back there right now anyway. I've already taken out the Dark Lord. No place for me there now." Nuada absorbed this with a nod, a thoughtful look on his face. It only took him a few minutes to finally come to a decision.<br/>	"Come with me." Harry looks up in surprise.<br/>	"What?!" Nuada chuckled.<br/>	"Come with me. I'm good at keeping myself hidden, I could keep you hidden as well. I wouldn't mind the company, and you could see the world. Will you go?" Harry was staring at him in shock.<br/>	"Are... Are you serious?" He asked, looking afraid of hoping, making Nuada's heart squeeze in sadness.<br/>	"Of course. I don't like the idea of you traveling the world by yourself." Harry grinned at him, before launching himself forward, his arms wrapping around Nuada's neck. Nuada tensed for a moment before chuckling and hugging him back lightly, until Harry let him go and stood up. <br/>	"I need to go get my things, then I'll be ready to go!" Nuada got up and followed the young wizard down a couple of blocks until they came to a row of identical houses. Nauseatingly so. He stopped at the one labeled number 4, freezing in apprehension, the prince coming up beside him. <br/>	"Do you wish for me to come with you?" Harry thought for a moment, before looking at Nuada shyly.<br/>	"You're already doing so much for me. I can't..." Nuada waved him off.<br/>	"I offered. Do not think of yourself as a burden. If you were I wouldn't be taking you with me. Of course you have a lot to learn, but we will rectify that." Harry grinned.<br/>	"Then yes, I'd like for you to come with me." Nuada smiled and gave him a small push forward, Harry smiling shyly back at him. They both went to the back door, Harry waving his hand, lock clicking. They quietly walked in, the shorter of the two walking toward the cupboard under the stairs, waving his hand to unlock the lock on the door. He ducked inside grabbing a medium size sack and started shoving things inside. They heard footsteps on the stairs and the younger froze, before relaxing when the figure of a muscular boy about Harry's age appeared. Nuada however had his hand on his sword just incase. The other boy quietly came up to them and whispered.<br/>	"What's going on Harry?" The teen asked, eyes flicking to Nuada warily before focusing on Harry.<br/>	"I'm leaving a week early. It's safer this way, Dudley. We both know Dumbledore will probably send someone to 'collect me' on my birthday. And I've been offered a way out." The other boy-Dudley- looked to Nuada again.<br/>	"I suppose he's involved?" Nuada stepped forward to speak.<br/>	"Harry is going to travel with me and I plan to hide him from the wizards, so yes I am involved." Dudley seemed to size him up for a moment before nodding and bringing his attention back to Harry.<br/>	"I'll go get  Phobos and Phebos." The older whispered and crept back up the stairs. Nuada stood next to Harry.<br/>	"Phobos and Phebos?" Harry grinned.<br/>	"My familiars. They're just babies right now but Phobos is a black mamba and Phebos is a black panther cub." Nuada nodded, but was looking at the sack that Harry had just shoved his belongings, including his trunk into. Harry gave another grin. "Extension charm. We can use it to store any supplies we might need." Nuada gave him a smile. He wasn't even traveling with him yet and he was already thinking in 'we'. It was... Adorable, and very telling of how easily he latched onto someone who was kind and willing to take care of him in any sense. Not that Nuada thought he was weak by any means, but emotionally he was deprived and was like a leech, clinging to any bit of affection he could get. Nuada wasn't really an affectionate person, even with his sister who he loved dearly, but he would not deny the boy if he needed, or even wanted it.<br/>	While Nuada thought all this, Dudley had come back down with a snake and a black ball of fur and handed it to Harry, who was now watching him.<br/>	"Are you ready to go?" The elf nodded and followed the young wizard out of the nauseatingly clean house, listening carefully for any noises of danger. He didn't stop listening until they were at the end of the block and next to the manhole Nuada intended to use for travel. He waited patiently for Harry to put the cub in a hidden inside pouch of his sweat shirt, it's small head looking out beneath his head, before opening the cover and motioning his young companion down. After Harry was a good way down, Nuada looked around to make sure they were not seen before climbing down and dragging the cover back over behind him. Harry was waiting for him when he reached the bottom. Nuada took the lead until they came to one of his camps he had set up years ago. <br/>	A large bed covered in silk blankets and pillows sat in the center, off to the left of that was a bathroom, though older still had working plumbing. Below both those was a small kitchenette and a table with three chairs sitting around it. Harry pulled out his cub and gently set it on the bed, then taking the snake and doing the same with him before turning toward Nuada, looking thoughtful.<br/>	 "What do I call you?" He said, head tilting like a dog. Nuada smiled, and motioned to one of the chairs as he sat in another. He waited for Harry to sit as well before he answered.<br/>	"You may just call me Nuada. I've never been big on the formalities, unless I have to use my title. Besides, from what I understand, when you turn 17 you will be a Lord." Harry's eyes narrowed.<br/>	"What do you mean a Lord?" It was Nuada's turn to be confused.<br/>	"The Potter's are an Ancient and Noble House. Going back to Merlin. Maybe even before that. The head of the family is either a Lord or Lady. In your case a Lord since as the last of your family, you are the head of the family." Harry was glaring down at the table now, eyes glowing with suppressed power. "I am sorry if I upset you, I thought you would know these things. From what little I know, heirs of Ancient and Noble Houses learn these things from an early age." Harry waved him off.<br/>	"It is not you who has angered me. I have a feeling Albus Dumbledore had something to do with this and was most likely supposed to make sure I was educated in such things. He made sure I would be ignorant. I'm going to have to go to Gringotts sooner than I had wanted to make sure Dumbledore hasn't tried to steal my title." He then looked up at Nuada with hopeful eyes. "Will you go with me?" Nuada sat and thought for a moment before answering.<br/>	"I wouldn't want anything to happen to you so I suppose I have to go, don't I?" Harry beamed at him, then seemed to grow shy.<br/>	"Thank you for all you're doing for me. I realize that you are going out of your way to help me. I hope that maybe I can help you in some way, to repay you."	 Nuada gave him a small smile.<br/>	"There is no reason to thank me young one. I decided I wished to help you. Felt compelled even. So I help you of my own accord. There is nothing forcing me to help you." Harry just kept smiling, then blushed when his stomach rumbled. Nuada chuckled, getting up to get his bag of provisions, rooting around and pulling out a couple of apples for Harry. He put them on the table in front of the wizard and said boy took one and bit into it gratefully. While he ate them Nuada grabbed his sword and went to a slightly secluded area before pulling off his shirt and putting it aside to train and think.<br/>-------------------------------------------<br/>	Harry ate his apples as he sat and thought about what had happened in the course of the day. This morning when he woke up he had been planning on leaving the magical world for the muggle world, and everyone in it. Then he meets Nuada, a prince, in the park, and he wants him around. The Prince of Bethmora wanted his company! It was mind boggling. Not to mention how handsome he was. There had to be someone who loved the elf and be pissed off that Harry was anywhere near him. His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of something whistling through the air catching his attention. His curiosity getting the better of him, he followed the noise and its source, only to be left standing in shock. He was travelling with a mouthwatering god. He watched as Nuada's muscles flexed as he battled invisible foes. He was absolutely stunning, white skin over perfectly chiseled muscles, beautiful even with the scars decorating his body thanks to past battles. After about ten minutes of being entranced, Harry was startled by Nuada stilling and looking in his direction.<br/>	"How long have you been there Harry?" Said boy blushed under the intense gaze, which didn't go unnoticed by the prince.<br/>	"I don't know. A while I guess... You're very good with your sword." Nuada smirked.<br/>	"I've been training for over a 1,000 years. I better be good." Harry stared with wide eyes.<br/>	"1,000 years! Just how old are you?" Nuada chuckled, grabbing his shirt and pulling it back on, seeing Harry give a small pout, but masking it quickly.<br/>	"I'm 1,316. So I only have 1,300 years on you." He walked back toward the kitchen, the boy following faithfully behind. "Now we need to get some rest before tomorrow." Harry smiled and nodded, but froze when he realized something.<br/>	"Are we going to be sharing the bed?" Nuada looked at him curiously, an eyebrow raised.<br/>	"Is that a problem?" Harry blushed again.<br/>	"No. I was just wondering. Good night." He quickly slid into the left side of the bed, not looking at the prince. Nuada was highly amused as slid into the other side of the rather large bed. It would seem the little wizard had a crush on him, and he'd be lying if he said it wasn't reciprocated. But he would leave these thoughts for tomorrow.</p>
