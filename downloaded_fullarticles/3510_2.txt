    <u>Draco’s POV</u>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>It’s been already 2 years since the end of the war. I can say that I ‘ve survived my trial pretty well even though it was thanks to the luck named Harry ‘git’ Potter. Without him I would be probably in Azkaban trying to not go crazy any fucking minute. Funny how my petty existence should be thankful to him. I was surprised when he just popped up in front of Wizengamot to defend me and my case. I expected that I would have my cell already prepared next to the one of my father’s but noo Potter just had to save one more life because of his almighty hero complex. Maybe I am thankful, but I have for him only a little drop of thankfulness.</p>
<p>“Good morning, I am searching for some fruit yoghurt, can you help me?” My pitying was interrupted by young girl maybe thirteen or fourteen years old.</p>
<p>Breathe in, breathe out. Okay, good, now smile, I can’t lose another job.</p>
<p>“Good morning, aisle three you need to go to the end of this one then to the right and it would be the fourth aisle on your left.” I said with the best smile I could do at that moment. Just go, please. To my luck she left immediately. <em>Sigh</em>. This day will be long.</p>
<p>Yeah, because of wizarding society I rather left and started my own life in a muggle world slash muggle London. It was hard since the beginning, but I can handle it somehow now. I just still hate talking with muggles. Old habits die hard I guess. I live in small apartment just few minutes of walk from this department store. It is small but mine and that’s all that matters to me.</p>
<p>I was lucky during last few months that I had no encounters with wizards or witches. Only wizards or witches can have alpha, beta or omega traits that’s why I’m glad that I didn’t meet anyone. And guess who was so lucky to inherit omega traits and presented as an omega year ago? It was the worst like literally THE WORST experience I ever had. It was triggered by some wizard alpha who just wanted to have a lunch in a place I worked as a waiter. I suddenly felt dizzy and drunk maybe. I remember smelling some spices mixed with chocolate.</p>
<p><em>Sigh.</em> I still have some flashbacks during nights I’m alone. That wizard dragging me out, kissing me, trying to have me, my unpleasantly wet ass and wet jeans I had. I cried and begged him to leave me, but his strength was overwhelming. Thankfully my coworker saved me and drag me to my home then leaved. After that I remember an awful pain in my body. The most humiliating fact was that I wanted that wizard back with me. It was a long week, long week of my first heat, I hated it, I hate everything about it, but… I can do nothing. Learn to live with it Draco Malfoy otherwise you’ll get fucked by random stranger again. So, I keep track of my heats and always take day offs from my job. It helps to not get raped.</p>
<p>“Okay another shelf is filled with this meat-poison in cans.” He praised himself and smiled checking his watches.</p>
<p>“Nice my shift ends in half an hour.” Draco mumbled for himself and turned to leave to the storeroom but bumped to some man and started panicking. <em>Oh shit, he smells like an alpha. </em></p>

  <strong>
    <u>Harry’s POV</u>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Two years without any possibility of private life, it exhausted Harry enough that he started to live in muggle London since week ago. After war Harry was chased by reporters from Daily Prophet every day he went out. Ginny left him, and it was partially his fault as well. Actually, he admitted that he only pretended his love for her after war. She was awesome as a friend but his feelings for her, he felt during their studies in Hogwarts, completely disappeared. So, she focused more on Quidditch as a seeker in Holyhead Harpies and stayed in touch with her family. Harry wanted to stay away of any wizarding public places, so he confessed to his friends – Hermione and Ron, about Ginny and his feelings.</p>
<p>Ron was mad on Harry at the beginning but then he came and told him: <em>“Well mate, Ginny is Beta. I know…. And I wish for you as Alpha for Alpha… You just should find some Omega that you’ll be happy with. Merlin I am glad that you’re not with my sister anymore.”</em></p>
<p>Harry smiled. These memories were precious to him. He got up from the armchair he was sitting in and went to grab some food from fridge.</p>
<p>“Damn… I have to go to buy some food…I completely forgot!”</p>
<p>So, he took his coat and went to the nearest store. This muggle life somehow helped him to live more freely then in wizarding world, no one to pursue him, no interviews… He enjoyed it.</p>
<p>He didn’t use his wand, he tried to do everything in ‘the muggle way’ last few days. It didn’t occur to him at first how much he was used to magic around him but…after two or three days he was already used to the muggle way. Whenever he woke up from his nightmares he went to do laundry or wash dishes…anything doing by hands helped him relax. He would lie if he said that he was fine. He knew that he had tons of problems and panic attacks but didn’t like the fact that Daily Prophet would find out immediately if he went to counselor.</p>
<p>“Okay so some cans with anything eatable first.” Harry mumbled to himself when he arrived in the store.</p>
<p>Something smelled nicely here like combination of vanilla, lavender and something he didn’t know but it reminded him the feeling of laying on a greenfield site and just enjoying the warmth of the sun. Completely lost in depths of the scent he just continued to the aisle in front of him. It had some cans with… meat? So, he didn’t question how he got there. Until the guy, that was refilling the shelves a second ago, bumped in him, that took Harry out of his scent trance.</p>
<p>“Erm, excuse me.” Harry heard from guy, who to vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>“That was strange.” Harry mumbled to himself and followed that guy with his eyes, then took some of the cans with him and went to pay him.</p>
<p>Only after Harry arrived at home he suddenly realized that there was a witch or wizard because of that scent. Well maybe witch than wizard because it smelled like an omega and Harry didn’t have the pleasure to meet any male omega. It was pretty rare in fact. He sighed.</p>
<p>He took one of the freshly bought cans and plopped the inside of it on his plate and went to heat it up in the microwave. During the heating of his ‘delicious’ meal, he tried to remember the scent he smelled. He didn’t know why but it was somehow familiar to him. Maybe he should try to meet that someone again.</p>
<p>He was disturbed by the sound of microwave, telling him his meal was ready to eat.</p>
<p>“Whatever- it can wait, now I’m really hungry.” Harry shook his head and took the plate out of the microwave.</p>
