    <p> </p><p>The hellicarrier was full of silent people today. Yesterday and all last week it had been organised chaos to put it politely. The part of the reason for last weeks disturbances<strong>*</strong> was currently the reason for the almost shocked silence in the non-submarine.</p><p>"Nat, you have to believe me, I didn't cheat on you! I swear on-"</p><p>"You do realise they're not listening to you."</p><p>The speaker was Bruce. He had been hearing the SHIELD agent apologise all day and now he was getting pissed off, " Ms Romanov and her...companion," <em>Loki. Who should also be blamed. "</em> Are ignoring your existence so, please shut up." The scientist turned back to his work, hoping that Barton went away quickly. Tony would come soon and he would need all his wits about him, wits that would hopefully stop the Other Guy from throttling the billionaire.</p><p>Unfortunately, for Bruce's wits and SHIELD's new lab, Barton didn't leave quickly enough. </p>
<hr/><p>Harrison Romanov wasn't having a good day. He had spent half the morning calming down an irate Hulk and the other assuring a terrified Dr Banner he was, "Most certainly not to blame for this" and "No, Tony still wants you to stay in the tower". Then, in the half-hour assigned to lunch, he'd found out why his sister had locked herself, Loki and Captain America in the training room. The revelation had not been pretty and the already agitated staff were now jumping at the slightest sound.</p><p>Harrison, or Agent Snake Charmer - his semi-official title - knew the reason that his sister was so upset. When he caught the bastard he was going to torture him till he cried. He stopped, speaking of bastards...</p><p>BANG!</p><p>CRASH! Agent Barton fell out of the air vent above him looking disorientated. He was dragged roughly to his feet and dangled over a convenient staircase.</p><p>"Right now I am a very angry brother. A very, very angry mage. A very, very, <em>very</em> angry assassin. And you Clint Barton have just broken my sister's heart. The last person who did that was lucky to shot before I found him. You, however, I know where you live. If you come within a hundred feet of my sister or my her room - I'll castrate you. And then rip out your heart and bury your body so deep in the woods even God won't find you. Your heart though will go on this wall as a prize and a warning to every other person who even thinks about hurting my Spider." Hawkeye was shaken vigorously, "Do you understand me, Barton?"</p><p>The blonde man nodded shakily, wondering if the man holding him would drop him anyway. " Good boy." The archer was draped over the railing and Harry walked off, that'd teach the bastard not to mess with a Romanov.</p><p>
