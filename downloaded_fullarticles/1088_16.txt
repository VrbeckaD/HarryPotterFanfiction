          <div class="userstuff"><p>So, I'm on the couch, reading my favorite book,<em> Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,</em> and I get a knock at my door, so naturally I go to open it.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Hello?" I call out. "Who's there?"</p><p> </p><p>My hand is on the doorknob, keeping the door closed. Then, I hear a posh British voice answer me.</p><p> </p><p>"Er, well, I don't know how to say this, but you're my favorite character from a book series." He chuckles nervously. </p><p> </p><p>This voice sounds..familiar. Too familiar. I peak through the peephole in my door and do a double-take so hard I get a bit of whiplash. I..just saw Harry Potter. I open the door, and there he is, standing outside of my apartment.</p><p> </p><p>"Wh- are you- Harry Potter?!" I'm obviously baffled at this point.</p><p> </p><p>"Er- Yes I am. But your story left on such a sour note, and I came to change that."</p><p> </p><p>"..what? A book? What happens? Do I die or something?"</p><p> </p><p>He then pulls out a gun, cocking it and pointing it at me.</p><p> </p><p>"I think you misunderstand the point of my visit."</p></div>
