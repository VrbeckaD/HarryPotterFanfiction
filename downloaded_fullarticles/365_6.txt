</p><p>Given that Remus, James, and Peter had spent the last seven weeks trying to contain Walburga Black's daily Howler, it was somewhat of a Pyrrhic victory they were only now seeing progress. </p><p>It would have been easier if Sirius helped, but he preferred to affect absolute indifference while his mother's shrieks echoed off the walls. It was not remotely the first time he had sustained this sort of verbal assault, which he told them repeatedly; this information did not impact their conduct. Each morning, while Walburga screamed, Remus, James, and Peter embarked on new adventures in misapplied hexes while Sirius spread butter and jam on his toast, calm as you please, propping his feet on the table and tipping his chair off the floor.</p><p>The rest of Gryffindor table, and the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables as well, seemed to have adjusted to the new state of affairs, having long since contented themselves to eating breakfast in silence using personal muffling charms. But Remus' dedication was not waning. The data was fascinating, to say the least. Transfiguration never did anything to the Howlers, though James' convincing command of <em>Draconifors</em>—deflected, and notably proving successful once connected with a salt shaker nearby—concerned Remus greatly for the prank that would inevitably follow. Their <em>Aqua Eructo / Ebublio</em> combination had also been inspired, but it had only made Walburga's voice sound like it was underwater, the words not much obscured. Trying to make the thing Disappear had taken the three of them to even affect it—the effect being the instant manifestation of 99 identical Howlers echoing the same abuse in unison. This had required Madam Pomfrey's casting of a spell of impressive scope to undeafen all 400 people in the hall at once, and had not been reattempted.</p><p><em>Expulso</em> did nothing. Fire did nothing. <em>Finite Incantatem</em> thrice cast only rendered them suddenly useless at spells for the following hour—something which had not gone over well with Flitwick when they'd landed in Charms unable to use magic. </p><p>Their most successful attempt to get the Howler down to a dull murmur had been this morning, with petrification and silencing charms, followed by hasty covering of the letter with a nearby pastry lid. Lily’s participation had strengthened the attempt, and the Howler’s words could no longer be discerned as long as one was actively eating.  Remus considered this their greatest success to date.</p><p>Sirius, for his part, showed no change in his reaction regardless of their countermeasures. This might have annoyed Remus, except that he believed three things to be true. </p><p>First: Any genuine reaction from Sirius was bound to make things worse. He'd shown up at the Pettigrews' Swansea cottage two months ago severely unmoored, vowing never to go back to the Black family home, over events he wouldn’t talk about. His behavior had not stabilized since. Sirius' control in the face of these Howlers was admirable in a certain light, even if whatever Sirius repressed at breakfast was instead unleashed slowly throughout the day.</p><p>Second was that it seemed possible Walburga would know if Sirius reacted with magic, not least because Regulus’ eyes were fixed on Gryffindor table too often for someone pretending his brother didn’t exist. Howlers were intended to humiliate, to shame, to make Sirius’ disownment publicly clear—and yet, as Sirius may have realized, their daily recurrence suggested that Walburga was far more affected by Sirius' departure than Sirius was by his disownment. Being called a <em>Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh</em> was possibly being interpreted by Sirius as a compliment. Remus was happy enough not to interfere.</p><p>Third was that the daily arrival of Walburga's Howler may have been contributing to why Sirius had not yet been expelled. The head table heard her screaming, same as anyone else. Sirius might have managed to beat his own record for detentions accrued in the first six weeks of classes—a whopping 26, impressive even to James—mostly for failure to do homework, mouthing off at teachers, and flagrantly violating Hogwarts rules. For example, Sirius had recently eschewed wizarding robes, preferring a rotation of loose-necked t-shirts emblazoned with Muggle band slogans. </p><p>And, of course, there was the persistent problem of the curse wars happening in the halls.</p><p>From what Remus could tell, teachers had given up reprimanding him for minor offenses, simply because there was so much else to reprimand him for. In this matter, James was not helping. Remus, newly made Prefect rather against his preferences, was doing his damndest to serve as the group’s impulse control without either alienating himself from them or copping too heavily for the administration. It was a delicate balance, and not one Remus felt was particularly successful. He preferred to address problems individually as they arose, and thus was not trying to tackle the problem of Sirius as an overall concept, despite instincts to the contrary.</p><p>The Howler wearily fogged up the pastry lid as Remus ate. It heartened him to notice that Lily’s attention was drawn to it as well. She caught his eye from down the table, face resting in one hand, her expression as perplexed as his. </p><p>Blessedly, James was missing this silent communication. He was too busy bleating something in Remus’ ear about how he'd gotten Lily to participate in the countercurse in the first place. James had forgotten, as he so often did, that Lily and Remus met every Wednesday evening before Astronomy to discuss Prefect duties, and forgot even more commonly that Remus and Lily had been at least civil and occasionally friendly over the past couple of years.</p><p>Sirius was, as usual, ignoring the situation altogether, preferring to lick jam off his fingers with individual and vulgar focus. "Well," he said cheerfully, marking the Howler's last wheezing words with the thunk of his chair against the floor. “New day ahead of us, chaps, a fresh turn around the sun. A world of endless possibility. Open doors, open hearts, open—"</p><p>"—books?” Remus muttered.</p><p>"Minds, at the very least," Sirius answered with a wink. "C'mon, Prongs, we can put in a solid twenty at the Willow before you drag me to class.”</p><p>"What are you doing to the Willow?" Remus asked with a wince.</p><p>"Enchanting bludgers to fly at it,” Sirius offered easily. “Check its batting speed. Hoping to give Slytherin a bit of a surprise against—"</p><p>“Do shut up, Padfoot,” James said loudly, spinning to his feet, “or you'll ruin the surprise."</p><p>Remus didn't need to look to know Lily was listening. Today’s Howler had finally burned up, in any case, gracing Gryffindor table with its 46th scorch mark of the year. “And you're sure the tree will survive this assault?" he asked gingerly, replacing the pastry lid where it belonged.</p><p>Sirius flashed him an indulgent grin, one hand grasped around the back of his chair. Remus had taken to noticing his hands quite a lot lately—but that was incidental. Hands were very <em>there</em>, generally speaking. Sirius had stooped to wearing robes today—albeit not in regulation, as they were burgundy dress robes sitting open over his usually unbearable low-cut t-shirt—but still managed to be the very picture of reckless abandon. The lovingly conditioned waves of his hair were cast over one shoulder, his grey eyes dancing with mischief as he held Remus' gaze. 

</p><p>Remus was abruptly struck, as by a bludger to the face, by how beautiful he was.</p><p>"Trust you to fall in love with the only tree capable of tearing a man apart," Sirius grinned.</p><p>”Finally we learn where Moony's affections lie!" said James, lacing an arm around Sirius’ shoulders.</p><p>“Aye, it’s young Willow who's stolen his heart."</p><p>"She's a fiesty dame, but she'll take your secrets to the grave. Your grave, of course, but—"</p><p>"Alright," said Remus, eyes closing. "Thank you; I am fond of the tree; please don't destroy it."</p><p>"She'll get through it better than the bludgers,” Sirius said, “promise.” And without further ado, he leapt onto James’ back; James caught him easily; and like this, the pair of them screamed out of the Great Hall as a unit.</p><p>Remus allowed himself an incredulous moment to process the chaos of what he’d just witnessed before returning to the remains of his breakfast. Peter, meanwhile, was still beside him, sketching an impressive rendering of a Howler on a napkin beside his plate. 

</p><p>"Not going with them?” Remus asked.</p><p>Peter shrugged, balancing a half-eaten piece of toast in one hand. "They never ask.”</p><p>“Me neither. Count it as a blessing." But Remus was discouraged from continuing when Lily slammed her books down in front of him. </p><p>"Well done Prefecting," she hissed across the table.</p><p>"You know as well as I do nothing under the sun would stop them."</p><p>"You might've at least tried."</p><p>"I did try. If you'd been listening to anyone but James—"</p><p>"You only clarified whether they were going to <em>hurt</em> the tree, which enchanted bludgers sound like they really might. What's the point of you, if not to stop them?"</p><p>"Contrary to popular belief," Remus said evenly, "I exist on this earth for reasons other than to hold James and Sirius back from their illustrious life of crime. I notice you didn't interject either, despite your eavesdropping."</p><p>"It's not eavesdropping when the entire Hall is subjected to their latest bit!" </p><p>And as Lily tore out and away, Remus reached for his coffee and toasted the place she had just been. "Thank you," he muttered, "for your help with the Howler."</p><p>"Oh," said Peter, awkwardly patting Remus on the shoulder. Toast crumbs fell over his robes. “You're welcome."</p><p>Remus might have corrected him on another morning, but he'd had quite enough excitement for one day. Instead, he poured himself another cup of coffee and reveled in the Great Hall's abrupt but welcome silence.</p><p><br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>It was hard to assess the danger Sirius was actually in, of course, when Remus heard reverential clarions every time Sirius walked into a room. </p><p>It’d had no particular beginning: a nag in his mind had grown to questions, then questions to answers, then answers to agony. Now Remus only occupied one of two states: looking at Sirius, or not looking Sirius. There were no other options. OWL year was proving completely impossible, thank Christ, as it excused Remus’ sudden withdrawal, reliance on dry jokes and sarcasm, his focus, and his avoidance. To the outside observer, Remus didn’t seem like he was in love with Sirius; he only seemed like he hated everything. Remus had frankly never loved an impending exam more.</p><p>Sirius and James had recently been appointed the most eligible bachelors in the year. An additional strain. They leaned predictably into the attention; James held an understandable appeal. He emphasized the assets of his wealth and glasses, wearing his tie loose around an unbuttoned collar. He had taken to messing up his hair purposefully throughout the day; the whole aesthetic was well supported by the rugged, emerging angles of his face. A recent but severe uptick in his confidence had solidified his status as a pompous heartbreaker over the past year or so.</p><p>Sirius, meanwhile, was establishing himself as a general delinquent. 

</p><p>The stolen motorbike had—it had undone Remus. The few vestiges of control he’d had on his feelings for Sirius had been immediately severed when Sirius had rode into Swansea looking like—like leaving his parents had turned him into some sort of… god of leather. He was transcendent, was the point: deliberately provocative, wiry and lean. High cheekbones, piercing gaze. Even his hair was a point of obsession for them both. It was soft; it smelled <em>wonderful</em>. Over one short summer, everything about Sirius had evolved specifically to drive Remus insane. </p><p>Sirius, of course, knew nothing of this, and with any luck he never would. Remus had spent a forlorn fourth year watching Sirius’ dating exploits, increasingly agitated when Sirius reported back on his escalating firsts. He’d thought he, like Peter, was feeling a bit left behind; but when the same feelings didn’t surface when James followed suit, Remus had gotten his first clue about what was going on.</p><p>James, surprising everyone, had since settled down somewhat. Now he declared every time Lily Evans walked by that he was a man of singular devotion. Sirius, on the other hand, had significantly increased his dating ambition since fifth year began. He seemed, in classic Sirius fashion, to relish in having people vie for his attention. Remus, meanwhile, had made not-caring about Sirius’ dating life one of his daily tasks. Like Prefect rounds, or rising for class, he perfected it equivalently. It was OWL year, after all; he had more important things to worry about than Sirius' girl of the week. 

</p>
<p>If Remus tore his cuticles to shreds every time Sirius and whomever entwined themselves anywhere in his vicinity, surely no one noticed. Lesions were by now an established part of his image.</p><p>Sirius had always been a physical person. They were all of them physical; any pretense at personal space had been abandoned sometime in third year. Remus could not exactly discourage Sirius’ tendency to express himself physically without giving himself away; but he could not, in all good conscience, allow things to proceed, either.</p><p>Sirius paid not enough attention to Remus and altogether too much. On top of motorbikes and women and altered states of consciousness, Sirius had also become somewhat indiscriminate in his pursuit of…</p><p>Well, frankly, Sirius tended to get a bit seductive with anyone who’d let him, when he was drunk enough.</p><p>And Remus let him.</p><p>It was… ruinous. It was the best thing that'd ever happened to him. It wasn’t much; they never kissed; Sirius only mouthed at Remus’ neck, which Remus found agreeable. He didn’t know what Sirius meant by it, he didn’t ask, it didn’t matter, they would never discuss it. Remus was not special. James laughed when Sirius started up the same thing with him, shrugging him off fondly; Peter had kicked up a somewhat more serious fuss, a problem Remus would have to contend with at a later date.</p><p>Remus, of course, simply allowed it. Things had progressed. Once Sirius had managed to crowd him against a bedpost, hot and close, one hand at Remus’ hip as he dragged his teeth along his throat, and Remus—desperately trying to find the will to put this to a stop—moaned. Softly, an accident, one of the biggest regrets of Remus’ life—but instead of pulling off, Sirius had only doubled down. 

</p><p>By the time Remus did pull himself together, he had an impressive mark to show for it. Remus had coveted this with desperate mortification. He'd disappeared into the Prefect bathroom upon its discovery for longer than he reasonably could excuse, and suffered a catastrophic Herbology class days later after Sirius gently touched his neck in passing. So gripped was Remus by the memory of Sirius' mouth on his skin that he had lost track of all instructions, landing himself in the Hospital Wing, pus burns down his arms.</p><p>Remus took heart in the fact that Hogwarts’ female population found it equally difficult to deny Sirius. Sirius was the most beautiful man alive; Remus was not ignorant to stark reality. Put like that, the situation was simple.</p><p>With great power came great responsibility, however, and Sirius’ popularity developed an ugly side. Not in four years at Hogwarts had Remus heard one person’s name dominate the gossip the way Sirius’ did now. It wasn't that he didn't deserve the unkindness; often, he did. He had little concern for his own future and even less concern for the feelings of others.

</p><p>But while Remus could tolerate gossip from people Sirius had actually wronged, it was another matter to hear it from effective strangers. Sirius was a prat and a ruffian, true; but he was <em>Remus’</em> prat and <em>Remus’</em> ruffian, and he was helpless but to defend his sole right to saying so.</p><p>(Sirius had lately stated his curiosity about the new spate of fellow detainees, most of whom were in for being late to class—all of whom, strangely, reported being randomly Petrified in the halls. Not under penalty of death would Remus admit it, but if they had simply spoken better of their peers, they might have found themselves sitting fewer detentions.)</p><p>Remus rationalized his attachment to Sirius in countless ways. James was Sirius’ best friend; Remus knew it, he didn't mind it, James had certain privileges Sirius coveted. But Remus had always shared a certain thread of connection with Sirius. Remus still talked to his parents, unlike Sirius—but his relationship with them was fraught, especially these days. This was something neither James nor Peter understood.</p><p>(It had been Remus' fault for leaving the magazine lying around. The argument with his father still rattled in his head. To hear Lyall talk about it, Remus' lycanthropy was now responsible for his homosexuality, and probably countless other unknown deficiencies. Remus, more contrarian than he’d known he was capable of, had since picked up a few bad habits he might have otherwise avoided just to lean into his father’s perception of his systematic deviance. Now he was starting to look forward to his after-class cigarette, to his own annoyance. If his rebellions were considerably more subdued than Sirius’, they at least understood each other’s reasoning.)</p><p>Sirius, meanwhile, knew what it was to live under the shadow of threat. Neither James nor Peter slept with their wands under their pillows the way he and Sirius did. Sirius was plenty familiar with ostracism, understood the implications of Remus' lycanthropy better than anyone. This understanding went both ways, or so Remus liked to think: it was Remus brought into Sirius’ confidence two months ago when he needed his ribs taped; it was Remus who, once aboard the Hogwarts Express, took Sirius’ chin in hand and fixed the click his jaw acquired over the summer.</p><p>Sirius, of course, was not the only one with secrets. James’ endless attempted discussions about who fancied whom among their number were proving increasingly difficult to dodge. It felt hellish to withhold part of himself from them after years of freedom, but Remus felt no keener to pursue the alternative. Unlike with his father, there was no escaping them. They shared classes, a common room—a dormitory, for crying out loud. If there had been one reason to accept the Prefect badge, it was for the new option of a private bath. 

</p>
<p>Remus was ferociously content with the state of his life as it was, with his friends and secrets and burning devotion. If abandonment was the cost of transparency, he’d pass up transparency every time.</p><p>Remus, then, would have to start shrugging a drunken Sirius off his neck. The conclusion was as terrible as it was inevitable. Sirius was too good at the things he chose to do; he was good at being obnoxious and disaffected, good at skiving off his schoolwork, good at Transfiguration and Charms in spite of never cracking a book; he was good at pranks, good at Quidditch in several positions; and he was decidedly, <em>hopelessly</em> good at necking. </p><p>Remus suspected, given Sirius’ pursuant purpose and the odd snogging review he’d gleaned in the halls, that Sirius was quite good at kissing in general. Remus wanted evidence to support this hypothesis just as keenly as he vowed to avoid it.</p><p>Things were fine as they were. His heart soared and sank so often it may as well have been rigged with a pulley, but Remus felt immensely blessed to be even within Sirius' striking distance. To be his friend, to be taken into his confidence, to be a target of his affections—this was enough. </p><p>All there was left to do was buckle down for OWLs, implement his Sirius deflection plan, and eventually let drop that he fancied men in a way that could not possibly make anyone upset, and everything was bound to turn out fine.</p><p><br/>
