    <p>Marlene swung across the the monkey bars while James sat above her. Sun had been beating down on the climbing frame all day, making the metal burn hot against her skin. “I wish it was tomorrow already.” He said longingly. “I’m not going to be able to sleep tonight.” </p><p>“Yeah, I can’t wait to ditch you for some better friends.” Marlene smirked. James pulled a face and started trying to pry her fingers off the bar. “No, don’t! I’m kidding!” She shrieked, grabbing another one. “Face it Jamie, you’re stuck with me.” </p><p>“I can’t wait for Quidditch! Reckon we’ll get picked for the team?” He asked. James was convinced they’d be in the same house, and she really hoped that he was right.</p><p>“They’d be mad not to.” Her dad used to take them up in into the woods on his days off to ride brooms, it would be so good to play for the actual an actual team though…and the glory of winning the Quidditch cup…people cheering her name. Marlene smiled slowly at the thought. She hooked her knees over one of the bars and let go, swinging upside down. </p><p>“Marley, your knickers are showing.” James muttered. </p><p>“Why do you care? You’ve seen me in my knickers before — without them too.” Their parents used to put them in the same bath to save time when they were little. She laughed at way her voice sounded as the blood rushed to her head, the skirt of her dress tickling her chin and her long hair brushing against the hard ground below.  </p><p>“<em>I</em> don’t care. But there’s a man over there watching us.” James said. Marlene swung her body, grabbed a bar and let her legs fall, before pulling herself up to sit beside James. Together they watched the man as he watched them. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end; there was something very unsettling about him. “Why’s he in a playground?” James whispered. Marlene looked around, they were the only two other people there, so he wasn’t here with children of his own. “There’s a whole park full of benches he can sit on.” </p><p>“Can we help you?” Marlene called out irritably. Though she instantly regretted it, neither of them had brought their wands, even if they had, they didn’t really know any spells yet. As the man stood up James shifted slightly, squaring his shoulders. </p><p>“Are you here by yourself?” The man asked as he approached. </p><p>“Marlene, let’s go.” James said, ignoring the question; he looked as uneasy as she was starting to feel. They jumped down from the climbing frame and ran out of the playground, across the field, and didn’t stop until they’d reached the safety of James’s front garden. James picked up a stick and brandished it at the gate. “I’ll jinx him if I see him again!”</p><p>“I’m sure you will.” Marlene said, rolling her eyes. </p><p>“And at school you need to tell me if anyone picks on you, I’ll beat them up.” He said. Marlene spun around, hands on her hips. </p><p>“I’m almost two months older than you, James Potter!” She could beat people herself.</p><p>“Yeah but I’m the boy.” James shrugged. Marlene shoved him hard, and he landed on his backside in the grass. </p><p>“I don’t need you to protect me!” </p><p>“Alright, alright.” He muttered, and she held out her hand to pull him back to his feet. Mrs Potter appeared on the doorstep.</p><p>“Come on, Marlene, your mother wanted you home for half six.” She smiled, ushering her inside and over to the living room fireplace.</p><p>“See you tomorrow!” She called over her shoulder to James, before stepping into the emerald flames.</p>
