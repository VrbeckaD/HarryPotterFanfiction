    <p>Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mrs. Verona Evans had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from her niece Harriet’s room. </p><p>“Third time this week!” She roared across the table. “If you can’t control that owl, it’ll have to go!” </p><p>Harriet tried, yet again, to explain. </p><p>“She’s bored,” she said. “She’s used to flying around outside. If I could just let her out at night—” </p><p>“Do I look stupid?” snarled Aunt Verona, a bit of fried egg dangling from her mouth. “I know what’ll happen if that owl’s let out.” She exchanged dark looks with her husband, Peter. </p><p>Harriet tried to argue back but her words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Evans’ daughter, Diana. </p><p>“I want more bacon.” </p><p>“There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,” said Uncle Peter, turning misty eyes on his massive daughter. “We must build you up while we’ve got the chance… I don’t like the sound of that school food…” </p><p>“Nonsense, Peter, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,” said Aunt Verona heartily. “Diana gets enough, don’t you, girl?” </p><p>Diana, who was so large her bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harriet. </p><p>“Pass the frying pan.” </p><p>“You’ve forgotten the magic word,” said Harriet irritably. </p><p>The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: Diana gasped and fell off her chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mr. Evans gave a small scream and clapped his hands to his mouth; Mrs. Evans jumped to her feet, veins throbbing in her temples. </p><p>“I meant ‘please’!” said Harriet quickly. “I didn’t mean—” </p><p>“WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered her aunt, spraying spit over the table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ WORD IN OUR HOUSE?” </p><p>“But I—” </p><p>“HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DIANA!” roared Aunt Verona, pounding the table with her fist. </p><p>“I just—” </p><p>“I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!” </p><p>Harriet stared from her purple faced aunt to her pale uncle, who was trying to heave Diana to her feet. </p><p>“All right,” said Harriet, “all right…” </p><p>Aunt Verona sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harriet closely out of the corners of her small, sharp eyes. </p><p>Ever since Harriet had come home for the summer holidays, Aunt Verona had been treating her like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harriet Evans wasn’t a normal girl. As a matter of fact, she was as not normal as it is possible to be. </p><p>Harriet Evans was a witch—a witch fresh from her first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Evans’ were unhappy to have her back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harriet felt. </p><p>She missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache. She missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, her classes (though perhaps not Prince, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in her four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in her cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks). </p><p>All Harriet’s spellbooks, her wand, robes, cauldron, and top of the line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Aunt Verona the instant w had come home. What did the Evans’ care if Harriet lost her place on the House Quidditch team because she hadn’t practiced all summer? What was it to the Evans’ if Harriet went back to school without any of her homework done? The Evans’ were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Aunt Verona had even padlocked Harriet’s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world. </p><p>Harriet looked nothing like the rest of the family. Aunt Verona was large and neckless, with an enormous amount of black hair; Uncle Peter was horse faced and bony; Diana was blond, pink, and porky. Harriet, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet black hair that was always untidy. She wore round glasses, and on her forehead was a thin, lightning shaped scar. </p><p>It was this scar that made Harriet so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harriet’s very mysterious past, of the reason she had been left on the Evans’ doorstep eleven years before. </p><p>At the age of one year old, Harriet had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harriet’s parents had died in Voldemort’s attack, but Harriet had escaped with her lightning scar, and somehow—nobody understood why Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harriet. </p><p>So Harriet had been brought up by her dead father’s brother and his wife. She had spent ten years with the Evans’, never understanding why she kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Evans’’ story that she had got her scar in the car crash that had killed her parents. </p><p>And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harriet, and the whole story had come out. Harriet had taken up her place at wizard school, where she and her scar were famous… but now the school year was over, and she was back with the Evans’ for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly. </p><p>The Evans’ hadn’t even remembered that today happened to be Harriet’s twelfth birthday. Of course, her hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never given her a real present, let alone a cake—but to ignore it completely… </p><p>At that moment, Aunt Verona cleared her throat importantly and said, “Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.” </p><p>Harriet looked up, hardly daring to believe it. </p><p>“This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,” said Aunt Verona. </p><p>Harriet went back to her toast. Of course, she thought bitterly, Aunt Verona was talking about the stupid dinner party. She’d been talking of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich manufacturer and his wife were coming to dinner and Aunt Verona was hoping to get a huge order from him (Aunt Verona’s company made packaging). </p><p>“I think we should run through the schedule one more time,” said Aunt Verona. “We should all be in position at eight o’clock. Peter, you will be—?” </p><p>“In the lounge,” said Uncle Peter promptly, “waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.” </p><p>“Good, good. And Diana?” </p><p>“I’ll be waiting to open the door.” Diana put on a foul, simpering smile. “May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?” </p><p>“They’ll love her!” cried Uncle Peter rapturously. </p><p>“Excellent, Diana,” said Aunt Verona. Then she rounded on Harriet. “And you?” </p><p>“I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,” said Harriet tonelessly. </p><p>“Exactly,” said Aunt Verona nastily. “I will lead them into the lounge, introduce you, Peter, and pour them drinks. At eight-fifteen—” </p><p>“I’ll announce dinner,” said Uncle Peter. </p><p>“And, Diana, you’ll say—” </p><p>“May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?” said Diana, offering her fat arm to an invisible woman. </p><p>“My perfect little lady!” sniffed Uncle Peter. </p><p>“And you?” said Aunt Verona viciously to Harriet. </p><p>“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,” said Harriet dully. </p><p>“Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. Peter, any ideas?” </p><p>“Verona tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason… Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason…” </p><p>“Perfect… Diana?” </p><p>“How аbout: ‘We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.’” </p><p>This was too much for both Uncle Peter and Harriet. Uncle Peter burst into tears and hugged his daughter, while Harriet ducked under the table so they wouldn’t see her laughing. </p><p>“And you, girl?” </p><p>Harriet fought to keep her face straight as she emerged. “I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,” she said. </p><p>“Too right, you will,” said Aunt Verona forcefully. “The Masons don’t know anything about you and it’s going to stay that way. When dinner’s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Peter, and I’ll bring the subject around to packages. With any luck, I’ll have the deal signed and sealed before the News at Ten. We’ll be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow.” </p><p>Harriet couldn’t feel too excited about this. She didn’t think the Evans’ would like her any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive. </p><p>“Right—I’m off into town to pick up the dinner dresses for Diana and me. And you,” she snarled at Harriet. “You stay out of your uncle’s way while he’s cleaning.” </p><p>Harriet left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. She crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under her breath: </p><p>“Happy birthday to me… happy birthday to me…” </p><p>No cards, no presents, and she would be spending the evening pretending not to exist. She gazed miserably into the hedge. She had never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harriet missed her best friends, Ronnie Prewett and Hermes Granger. They, however, didn’t seem to be missing her at all. Neither of them had written to her all summer, even though Ronnie had said she was going to ask Harriet to come and stay. </p><p>Countless times, Harriet had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig’s cage by magic and sending her to Ronnie and Hermes with a letter, but it wasn’t worth the risk. Underage wizards weren’t allowed to use magic outside of school. Harriet hadn’t told the Evans’ this; she knew it was only their terror that she might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking her in the cupboard under the stairs with her wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harriet had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under her breath and watching Diana tearing out of the room as fast as her fat legs would carry her. But the long silence from Ronnie and Hermes had made Harriet feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Diana had lost its appeal—and now Ronnie and Hermes had forgotten her birthday. </p><p>What wouldn’t she give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? She’d almost be glad of a sight of her archenemy, Dahlia Black, just to be sure it hadn’t all been a dream… </p><p>Not that her whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harriet had come face to face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harriet had slipped through Voldemort’s clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harriet kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes— </p><p>Harriet suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. She had been staring absent mindedly into the hedge—and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves. </p><p>Harriet jumped to her feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn. </p><p>“I know what day it is,” sang Diana, waddling toward her. </p><p>The huge eyes blinked and vanished. </p><p>“What?” said Harriet, not taking her eyes off the spot where they had been. </p><p>“I know what day it is,” Diana repeated, coming right up to her. </p><p>“Well done,” said Harriet. “So you’ve finally learned the days of the week.” </p><p>“Today’s your birthday,” sneered Diana. “How come you haven’t got any cards? Haven’t you even got friends at that freak place?” </p><p>“Better not let your dad hear you talking about my school,” said Harriet coolly. </p><p>Diana hitched up her trousers, which were slipping down her fat bottom. </p><p>“Why’re you staring at the hedge?” she said suspiciously. </p><p>“I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,” said Harriet. </p><p>Diana stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on her fat face. </p><p>“You c-can’t—mum told you you’re not to do m-magic—she said she’ll chuck you out of the house—and you haven’t got anywhere else to go—you haven’t got any friends to take you—” </p><p>“Jiggery pokery!” said Harriet in a fierce voice. “Hocus pocus—squiggly wiggly—” </p><p>“DAAAAAAD!” howled Diana, tripping over her feet as she dashed back toward the house. “DAAAAD! She’s doing you know what!” </p><p>Harriet paid dearly for her moment of fun. As neither Diana nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Uncle Peter knew she hadn’t really done magic, but she still had to duck as he aimed a heavy blow at her head with the soapy frying pan. Then he gave her work to do, with the promise she wouldn’t eat again until she’d finished. </p><p>While Diana lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harriet cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of her neck. Harriet knew she shouldn’t have risen to Diana’s bait, but Diana had said the very thing Harriet had been thinking herself… maybe she didn’t have any friends at Hogwarts… </p><p>Wish they could see famous Harriet Evans now, she thought savagely as she spread manure on the flower beds, her back aching, sweat running down her face. </p><p>It was half past seven,in the evening when at last, exhausted, she heard Uncle Peter calling him. </p><p>“Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!” </p><p>Harriet moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight’s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven. </p><p>“Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!” snapped Uncle Peter, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. He was already wearing a midnight blue suit. </p><p>Harriet washed her hands and bolted down her pitiful supper. The moment she had finished, Uncle Peter whisked away her plate. “Upstairs! Hurry!” </p><p>As she passed the door to the living room, Harriet caught a glimpse of Aunt Verona and Diana in gaudy dresses. She had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door bell rang and Aunt Verona’s furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs. </p><p>“Remember, girl—one sound—” </p><p>Harriet crossed to her bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on her bed. The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.</p>
