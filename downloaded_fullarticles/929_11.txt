    <p>
  <b>A = Aftercare (What they’re like after sex)</b>
</p><p>You are his first priority. Are you well? Any aches or pains? Severus knows he can be…intense at times. If you’ve just finished a round of BDSM-style lovemaking, he’ll lovingly worship every inch of your body—massaging delightfully scented potions into your skin as he heals any scrapes. Was he tugging on your hair? One scalp massage coming up! </p><p>
  <b>B = Body part (Their favorite body part and also their partner’s)</b>
</p><p>His arms. Severus’ teaching robes do him zero justice. I’m talking the Kylo Ren Effect. You know—we all thought Kylo was a scrawny twig…only to see him shirtless and collectively fall off our chairs in shock? Severus is the same (though, granted, not <em>as</em> beefy). Whenever you’re in his arms you feel utterly secure. Nothing can harm you. Plus, his hands are <em>part</em> of his arms. Calloused, skilled…dear Circe, the things that man can do with a mere <em>finger</em>. (*Swoons*)</p><p>Your eyes. The way your eyes soften whenever you gaze at him… He’d find it night impossible, but it’s a look you give to him, and him alone. Whenever he’s making love to you, Severus craves being able to watch the love and pleasure build in your eyes. (Since he enjoys taking you from behind, mirrors would often come into play.)</p><p>
  <b>C = Cum (Anything to do with cum basically…I’m a disgusting person)</b>
</p><p>Coming inside you. While Severus has some fears about fatherhood, he also has a secret pregnancy kink. The thought of making your belly swell with his child? Expect filth in your ear as he makes you beg for it. It’s all about claiming you. Do you want him, Y/N? Say it. You wanted him. His baby. His cum overflowing inside you. </p><p>Likewise, the sight of you swallowing his cum? Knee-buckling levels of arousal. While he’d never force it on you, prepare to be REWARDED the first times you do this.</p><p>
  <b>D = Dirty Secret (Pretty self explanatory, a dirty secret of theirs)</b>
</p><p>Being somewhat telepathic, Severus tends to pick up certain strong thoughts. Whenever you’re ogling him, he’s well aware. Slytherin that he is, Severus wouldn’t be able to resist toying with you. Wanting to kiss him while he’s grading papers? He’d make sure to ‘absently’ rub the pad of his thumb over his bottom lip in thought, barely concealing a smirk when your inner self trembles.</p><p>
  <b>E = Experience (How experienced are they? Do they know what they’re doing?)</b>
</p><p>We must remember that Severus became a Death Eater willingly. While he’s certainly no Casanova, Severus is likely more experienced than expected. As for his skill… Let us not forget the rumors of his telepathic abilities. Sharing pleasure? Oh…you’ve yet to truly grasp the full extent of his abilities.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p><b>Quick Note:</b> <em>Since he’d become a Death Eater willingly, allow my to address something.</em> Severus wouldn’t be into rape <em>at all</em>. Remember, his mother was severely abused by his father. It’s possible Severus witnessed sexual assaults—even if he’d merely heard it, only to understand once he was older. He, therefore, is staunchly against the abuse of women. That being said, Death Eaters likely have groupies. Being such a powerful man brings a certain desirability.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <b>F = Favorite Position (This goes without saying. Will probably include a visual)</b>
</p><p>Gazing into your eyes as he cradles you close, feeling all your emotions flowing into him as he loves you with heart-wrenching tenderness. While Severus certainly enjoys roughness, it’s the mental—even spiritual—connection that he craves most. You’re his world. When he’s buried deep inside you, feeling your arms and legs twining about him to keep him close? He feels finally at home.</p><p>
  <b>G = Goofy (Are they more serious in the moment, or are they humorous, etc.)</b>
</p><p>Severus isn’t an overly humorous man. The dark life in which he’s embroiled hasn’t allowed for much laughter. When he’s making love to you, he’d be serious—intent on connecting on a level deeper than physical. That being said, you’d prove a great influence on the stoic man. Are you the giggly sort? He’s not above a wry grin, shaking his head in amusement as he leans down to kiss you.</p><p>
  <b>H = Hair (How well groomed are they, does the carpet match the drapes, etc.)</b>
</p><p>Severus is well-groomed South of the Belt. Considering the cause of his slick hair, however, it’s understandable. (Remember, his hair appears greasy due to constant potion-making, not neglected hygiene.) As for other body hair, Severus has—brace for it—a <em>goody trail</em>. <em>Yessss</em>. Follow it at your leisure, watch his abdomen dip and shiver at your touch!</p><p>
  <b>I = Intimacy (How are they during the moment, romantic aspect…)</b>
</p><p>Severus is without a doubt the most tender lover you’ll ever find. The level of gratitude toward fate for bringing you into his life could bring him to tears. <em>You</em> are the most precious thing in his life. He lives for you. Knowing this, is it any surprise he’d treat you with love and devotion? </p><p>Propped on elbows above you, he’d tilt his head to the side, using a mental bond to communicate on a level deeper than words. You’d be able to feel each other’s heartbeats—your chests pressed together, fingers laced.</p><p>
  <b>J = Jack Off (Masturbation headcannon)</b>
</p><p>Does he jack off to thoughts of you? Absolutely. Severus has a vivid inner world through which he can live his most depraved—tying you to the bed and fucking you for hours, all the while hearing your desperate moans fill the air—fantasies.</p><p>Admittedly, though, he’d try to hide this fact for as long as possible. The idea of masturbation—when it applies to himself—is a private matter. Having been shamed during his pubescent years, he has a residual  discomfort with his own sexuality. In the beginning of your relationship, Severus would rather die than have you catch him cock-in-hand. </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p><b>Note:</b> I’d recommend some mutual masturbation to help you both get over any shyness.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <b>K = Kink (One or more of their kinks)</b>
</p><p>Bondage is the big one. Naturally dominant in bed, he loves making you squirm as he towers over you. He’d never hurt you, but seeing you willingly at his mercy? Merlin, it <em>does</em> things to him…</p><p>
  <b>L = Location (Favorite places to do the do)</b>
</p><p>Your bed. Everything about it brings such joy, from seeing you asleep after make love, to watching you ride him as he sits back against the headboard.</p><p>
  <b>M = Motivation (What turns them on, gets them going)</b>
</p><p>Being wanted. Severus is so used to being looked at with disgust. The way your eyes soften, face lighting up whenever you see him? His chest will expand with painful amounts of love. In a purely lustful sense, Severus deeply enjoys watching your eyes cloud over with desire whenever he approaches to loom over you. He doesn’t need words to turn you on—something that will never cease to astound him.</p><p>He’s also highly susceptible to your thoughts. Just flood him with smutty daydreams and he’ll stop what he’s doing, slowing raising his gaze to pin you with a <em>scorching</em> look. </p><p>
  <b>N = NO (Something they wouldn’t do, turn offs)</b>
</p><p>Hurting you. Rough play, he’ll do—but actually inflicting harm? Never. After Lily, he’d be terrified of loosing control, possibly taking things too far. What if he lost you? What if you left him? He doesn’t think he can go back to the way things used to be.  No: he <em>knows</em> he can’t—not without dying a bit each day.</p><p>
  <b>O = Oral (Preference in giving or receiving, skill, etc.)</b>
</p><p>He’s <em>enthusiastically</em> open to giving. Whenever he’s in the mood for revenge after hours of teasing, he’ll give a wicked grin, holding you in place as he goes to town. </p><p>As for receiving? The fact that you <em>want</em> to do it makes him weak with want. Gods, he loves you so much. Stroking your cheek, he’d watch your actions, half-expecting to wake and find it to have been a dream.</p><p>
  <b>P = Pace (Are they fast and rough? Slow and sensual? Etc.)</b>
</p><p>For Severus, sex is about much more than the physical. The emotional connection is what he craves most. He, therefore, prefers to take a slow, languid pace in bed—the kind that keeps you both at the very edge for seemingly hours.</p><p>That being said, he’s also got a dark side. While he can be painfully gentle, he’s also very much into rougher types of sex. Either way, expect him to typically outlast you.</p><p>
  <b>Q = Quickie (Their opinion on quickies rather than proper sex, how often, etc.)</b>
</p><p>Quickies, in his opinion, are meant for times of simple fucking—an act between two strangers. Why would he ever treat you in such a way? The first time you drag him into his supply closet, demanding him then and there, however, he’ll gain a new perspective. Sometimes you just can’t wait any longer. Sometimes he needs to be inside you. Quickies are for those times. As for frequency? More often than he’ll ever admit.</p><p>
  <b>R = Risk (Are they game to experiment, do they take risks, etc.)</b>
</p><p>Let’s not forget that we’re talking about the Half Blood Prince—a wildly inventive man. Experimental potions? How about a cloning spell so you can make love to two Severus’ at once? Prepare to be his muse.</p><p>
  <b>S = Stamina (How many rounds can they go for, how long do they last…)</b>
</p><p>Oh, you’ll be satisfied—<em>amply</em> satisfied. Remember, Severus is in top condition (he just hides it beneath layers of teaching robes), often having to spring into action whenever called upon. Not only is he able to readily ’rise to the occasion’ whenever ‘duty calls’, he’s a master of self control.</p><p>
  <b>T = Toy (Do they own toys? Do they use them? On a partner or themselves?)</b>
</p><p>He’s not overly interested in sex toys—unless, of course, he’s using them to discover new ways to pleasure you. Besides, who needs objects when there’s spells to try? The only limit is your imagination.</p><p>
  <b>U = Unfair (How much they like to tease)</b>
</p><p>Severus is the master of blatant, yet invisible teasing. Are you working on a task in public? <em>No, no, you spelled it wrong</em>. He’ll lean over you, plucking the quill as he corrects the mistake—all the while covertly pressing against you as his breath tickles your neck. Acting completely unaffected, he’ll then leave you wondering what the hell just happened. </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p><b>Note:</b> It’ll take you a few weeks to realize he’s been doing it on purpose. The telepathic fiend. Revenge will be sweet as you tie him to the bed…</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <b>V = Volume (How loud they are, what sounds they make)</b>
</p><p>Severus is unexpectedly vocal during sex—making sensual groans and grunts as he works his body in the most sinful of ways. With his deep moans of encouragement, you’d be helpless against the growing pleasure. (Plus who can resist Severus purring pure naughtiness into your ear?) </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p><b>Note:</b> The one time you both forgot a silencing charm during a quickie in his supply closet will forever bring a blush to your cheeks. Honestly, did Madame Pomfrey have to give you knowing looks <em>all</em> the time?</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <b>W = Wild Card (Get a random headcannon for the character of your choice)</b>
</p><p>Is his voice an option? Because <em>damn</em>. While others find think it drawling, you adore hearing him speak. After all, Severus is a man inclined toward silence. </p><p>Once you get to know him, you’d be able to pick up the slight strain or tremors whenever he’s trying to suppress laughter. Plus mid-sex groans? (Warning: Severus is very into dirty talk. *Fans self*)</p><p>
  <b>X = X-Ray (Let’s see what’s going on in those pants, picture or words)</b>
</p><p>He’s quite large—hence his concern after more rough encounters. He’s also uncut, making the tip incredibly sensitive. (Licking it is a must during oral.) </p><p>
  <b>Y = Yearning (How high is their sex drive?)</b>
</p><p>This greatly depends on what’s going on in the world. If the war is at its peak, Severus will be in a stress spiral—working himself to the bone as he tries to prepare for every possible outcome. Needless to say, he’ll go days without rest, only to surprise you with a desperate, <em>passionate</em> bout of lovemaking.</p><p>When he’s not about to collapse with stress? Considering the fact that you’d be in close quarters much of the time—leading to prolonged exposure—is it all that surprising he’d want you so often? Especially once quickies become an option? </p><p>
  <b>Z = ZZZ (…how quickly they fall asleep afterwards)</b>
</p><p>Severus is able to function on very little sleep—hinting to a past of insomnia. While you’d want to help with that, you’d likely be unable to change his dependance on Sleepless Dream potion—at least, not while the Dark Lord is alive. Otherwise, he’ll be riddled with horrific nightmares. </p>
