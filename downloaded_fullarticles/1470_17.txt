    <p>
  <span>Harry turned in his bed for what seemed like a thousand time. Thoughts were running through his head preventing him from sleeping. Few minutes have past, as he finally got up from his bed feeling irritated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He let out a tired sigh and walked towards his trunk, taking his invisibility cloak, but before he could leave he looked at his broom. He always felt relaxed when he was flying or practicing Quidditch, maybe it wouldn’t hurt if he went out for a ride? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After battling with his thoughts for a while Harry decided to go for it. So he took his cloak and broom heading out of the Gryffindor tower, the walk towards the exit was stressing. Harry has never left the castle at night, </span>
  <em>
    <span>alone </span>
  </em>
  <span>before</span>
  <em>
    <span>.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Soon he was outside, already walking towards the Quidditch Stadium. Once he was there he took off his cloak and got on his broom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It felt wonderful, the wind that ruffled his already wild hair, the moon that was shining on the sky, owls hooting in the forest and the feeling of freedom. When he was in the air nothing was bothering him, no Voldemort, no weird house elves appearing in his room, no boring lessons or unstopping thoughts. Just him and his broom…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry didn’t even realise, that someone was standing beneath him. That was until he looked down and saw a tall, silver haired boy, standing in the middle of the pit. Watching him silently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry narrowed his eyes as he already knew, who was watching him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Malfoy.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He flew down to face the boy, as he got down he noticed that Malfoy was holding his broom. That confused Harry, because what was Draco bloody Malfoy doing here in the middle of the night, with a broom?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As he got down from his broom, he looked at Malfoy and asked “What are you doing here Malfoy?” his face was twisted in anger and confusion. He even felt a bit scared, because who knew what was going inside his rival’s head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The silver haired boy narrowed his grey eyes and said “I could ask you the same thing </span>
  <em>
    <span>Potter</span>
  </em>
  <span>” the last name was said with so much venom, that a true snake would be jealous of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry crossed his arms “I asked you first Malfoy! Not to mention that you were the one, who interrupted </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy glared at the raven haired boy and said “I do not own you an explanation Potter! Besides, I come here every night, so you could say that </span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> was here first!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Boys stood there glaring at each other, neither one backing down. Finally Harry let out a huff and grabbed his broom heading towards the exit, when he heard Malfoy speak again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As you’re already here, maybe you would be of use”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emerald eyed boy stopped in his track, as he turned and asked “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy didn’t turn towards Harry as he said “You see I come here to practise. As my teammates are a nuisance, I prefer to train alone. But as you are here you could be of use”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah so?” said Harry feeling his irritation grow with each word that silver haired spoke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Grey eyed boy finally turned and said with irritation in his voice “Are you always so dull?” before Harry could answer, the other boy already started speaking again “I’m asking you to train with me Potter”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry felt as if someone smacked him “You’re joking right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy glared at him and said “We know each other for two years, do I seem like a person who jokes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Wild haired boy glared as well as he turned and said “Yeah, no. I’m not helping you”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But before he could leave he heard Malfoy speak once again “I don’t need your help. I want to show you that I’m better”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry once again stopped and turned, he let out a laugh and said “Yeah, I see that you can joke afterall”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy took a step towards him saying “Alright then” Harry tilted his head at him and the silver haired boy continued “Show me. Show me that you are better than me” The smaller boy bit his lip thinking that’s when he heard Malfoy say “Scared Potter?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s head snapped up at these words, as he saw the other boy grinning mischievously at him. He the grinned as well saying “You wish Malfoy” with that he headed towards the taller boy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Both of them spend almost all night training and even fooling around a bit (well it was mostly Harry fooling around, as Malfoy rolled his eyes at him). When the sun started raising both of them decided to head back, when they entered the castle they split without even a word to each other, as if the last few hours didn’t happen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Later in the day they were back at each other's throats, but at night the two of them went out to the stadium. It was like an unspoken agreement, they met almost every night to train at first, but as the time was flying by they started to grew closer. Sometimes they were just sitting and talking, or just flying around trying to catch one another.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It continued for years, until one memorable night in the fifth year.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As always Harry made his way towards the exit to met up with Malfoy, his hand still ached after what that pink frog did. But that did not stop him from his meeting, when he finally got to the exit Malfoy was already there, waiting for him. He was in his green and silver Quidditch sweater and black pants, his normally neat hair was wild,as if he ran his hand through them a thousand times. He was looking at his watch with a worried look, Harry felt his heart skip a beat as the sight of his… friend? Enemy? Rival? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He shook his head and threw his cloak off of him, before clearing his throat to announce his presence to Malfoy. The silver haired teen, clearly got startled at the sound, as he jumped slightly and looked towards Harry with wide eyes. The emerald eyed teen only smirked at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy let out a breath, and glared at Harry before taking his hand, leading him towards the stadium.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry felt himself blush, as he looked at their joined hands. Last time Draco held his hand was back in the fourth year, after Harry’s final trial. After... Cedric’s death. It was actually the first time when they held hands, Draco was worried about Harry so he visited him in the hospital wing soon after what happened. They spend whole night together, Draco trying to calm him down as he cried. Harry smiled to himself sadly, it was one of the best and worsts night’s in his life to be honest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Soon they entered the Stadium, Malfoy led them towards the middle of it and turned to look at Harry. They stared at each other, just as the wild haired teen was about to ask what’s going on, Malfoy said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Show me your hand” his voice was cold, with no emotion behind it. It kind of scared Harry a bit, it was just… too calm, too cold. And too much like Lucius’ Malfoy’s voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry wanted to take a step back, but Draco stopped him, stepping closer to him and grabbing his waist. Harry once again blushed, that’s when Draco spoke again in the same cold voice “Your hand Harry. Now”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The smaller boy felt chills ran through his body, but finally held up his injured hand to show Draco. Silver haired teen took a small step back and loosened his grip around Harry’s waist. He took off the bandage, and finally saw what he was looking for. Right on Harry’s hand, was a fresh wound that said in Harry’s writing </span>
  <em>
    <span>“I must not tell lies”. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy stood there staring at the wound with no emotion, but Harry knew that something was wrong as the hand around his waist tightened once again, almost possessively.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The silence around them was thick and unsettling, as Draco kept staring at the words carved on Harry’s hand. Finally after what seemed like forever, he asked in cold and emotionless voice “So it’s true”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before Harry could come up with some kind of answer, he was being crushed into Malfoy’s hard chest. He let out a yelp of surprise at the grey eyed boy actions, but soon his body relaxed against his will.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I will kill that bitch” whispered Draco into Harry’s ear making him shiver.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Draco…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No” said Draco, as he hugged Harry tighter “She had no right. She will perish, I promise”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry wanted just to stay in Draco’s arms and never leave. But why? Why did he care? Why were they hugging? What’s going on?!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let go of me Malfoy” said Harry as he started to struggle against the taller boy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry…” whispered Draco as he loosened his hold a bit, just enough to look at Harry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Harry’</span>
  </em>
  <span> me Malfoy! Why do you care? You’ve never cared! All you do is insult me and my friends! And now when we’re alone you’re so good? And you think that I can just forget all the shit you do to me during the day?! Now you just come here and..!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry was cut off, by a pair of aggressive lips that were kissing him. Hard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The kiss was aggressive from Draco’s side and clumsy from Harry’s, as he didn’t really know how to react. The taller boy licked and bit at Harry’s lip, trying to get inside and after few seconds the raven haired boy let him in. From that moment the kiss became both passionate and aggressive, at some point Harry felt light headed and his legs almost gave out on him but Draco growled into his lips and held Harry tighter, in order to not let him fall. Soon they pulled back, breathing heavily, their lips swollen and red.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After their breaths became even, the weight of their situation crashed down upon them. Neither of them knew what happened and why did they do it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On Draco’s side it felt right. He didn’t know why he have done that, he just wanted to do it. And he is Draco Malfoy, he gets what he wants. He looked at blushing Potter in front of him and smirked, right now he wanted Harry Potter, so he will have him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry on the other hand was in shock and confusion, he didn’t know what possessed him into kissing Draco. But it felt good… it was like flying on his broom. He felt free, like nothing could bother him ever again. He just wanted to stay in arms of his former rival and never leave, let the world take care of itself without his help. But then his thoughts cleared, he just kissed Draco Malfoy, his enemy!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You okay there Potter? Or was it too much for you” asked Draco, with wide pleased smirk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The emerald eyed boy, snapped out of his daze and looked up at his ‘rival’ that he just kissed “I-I…” with that Harry pulled back from Draco and started running away, towards the castle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But unfortunately he didn’t get too far, as Draco caught up to him and stopped him by grabbing his wrist. He tried to pull his hand back, even tried to punch Malfoy but the silver haired teen grabbed his other wrist. Trapping him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck Potter?” snarled Draco, his grey eyes showed his rage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah what the fuck Malfoy?!” hissed Harry, as the other boy squeezed his wrist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I remind you that you were the one, who ran away for no reason and almost punched me” said Draco, as his cold grey eyes stared hard at Harry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But Harry didn’t notice them, as he felt his rage and confusion grow “No fucking reason?! You kissed me, you prick!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco nearly bursted in rage as he yelled at Harry “Yeah?! Don’t fucking go make yourself a victim, because you liked it Potter! Don’t fucking lie!” he took a step closer towards Harry, their chests were neatly touching “You liked it. How my hands were on your waist, how my lips crashed against yours, how…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut up!” hissed Harry as his cheeks were flaming with blush “Just shut up! It doesn’t matter if I liked it or not! We can’t! </span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> can’t! We’re rivals and enemies!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh really?” snapped Draco as he glared at Harry “Since when do enemies meet every night just to spend time together? Laugh together? And above all go and spend the night in the hospital bed trying to help one other?!” Harry clearly didn’t know how to answer to that so he stayed quiet. Draco took a deep breath and said “Maybe at the beginning we were, but through the years we changed Harry. I know I did” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry shook his head and pulled his bruised wrists out of Draco’s relaxed grip. Then he took a step back and said “It doesn’t matter Draco. Who we are, who we were. Because you know fully well that when the morning comes all of this will disappear”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that Harry walked away and this time, Draco didn’t chase after him. Because he knew too that the emerald eyed boy was right.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When the morning comes all of this will disappear and they will once again become Potter and Malfoy. Gryffindor and Slytherin. Two rivals. Two broken souls.</span>
