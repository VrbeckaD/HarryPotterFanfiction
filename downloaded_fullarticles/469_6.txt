    <p>"–is six thousand years old! Scorp, isn't that awesome!"</p><p>"Since when are you even interested in palaeontology?"</p><p>"I mean, people change, right? And this stuff seriously speaks to me."</p><p><i>Oh, does it now.</i> Palaeontology used to be 'boooring, Scorp, what you'd even use that knowledge for' when Scorpius came back from his trip to Egypt, last summer, with blisters from sunburn and a few heavy tomes on the topic. Somewhat, however, it's all he hears nowadays from Albus, ever since the other boy started showing signs of an infatuation towards a certain, bloody– stupid– Well. Towards Samantha Buckhead.</p><p>Scorpius sighs.</p><p>He has suffered through a lot. But it didn't break him. He is a strong boy, a brave fighter. Even if all he sees whenever he looks in the mirror is</p><p>a victim.</p><p>A weakling.</p><p>A failure.</p><p>He can see good in other people – perhaps a little more good than there actually is – but he remains blind at his own brightness.</p><p>He's never truly seen himself as someone who can be loved. Wanted. Needed.</p><p>He never feels safe. With the world. With himself.</p><p>He's difficult.</p><p>Different.</p><p>Weird.</p><p>Redundant.</p><p>He watches people around him enjoy themselves, often with their partners, and wonders if he'll ever experience this sort of happiness as well.</p><p>Whether Malfoys are cursed, somewhat, deprived of the right to ever find joy.</p><p>He tries not to show that. His weakness. His darkness. The dirt that could stain the carefree people around him.</p><p>He has to be better than that. Above who he truly is. Otherwise, how could anyone ever want him?</p><p>He found his soulmate in Albus. His joy, his comfort, his love. His heart sings at the thought of him. Whenever they talk, touch, or simply sit or lie together and just share space, Scorpius feels at home. Truly at home.</p><p>Albus is a treasure. One that Scorpius vows to protect at all costs, even if his own life were to be at stake. Albus' happiness is his highest priority. It's keeping Scorpius alive. He isn't able to feel happy when Al isn't happy.</p><p>Which is why he can't let his feelings ruin the moment and disappoint his best friend. Of course Albus wants to talk to him about his girlfriends – or in this case, potential girlfriends. They talk about everything.</p><p>In moments like this Scorpius isn't too sure whether he is glad for it or hates it.</p><p>The fact that Albus is being so excited is not surprising at all, considering how much of a low self-esteem he has. It must be quite thrilling to have someone show their interest in you.</p><p><i>Scorpius</i> has that kind of interest in Al, but can he show it? It doesn't seem like a safe ground. He has no idea where to start. How to approach the topic. Perhaps he should drop some hints? Be gentle and cautious about it?</p><p>In all honesty, he wants to just scream the truth, straight in Albus' face. He wants that weight to finally be off his shoulders. It has lifted him up in the darkest, coldest moments where the world was a black hole, sucking the life right out of him, but it is also a tremendous burden to carry in his heart.</p><p>Especially in moments like this.</p><p>And Albus is so painfully thoughtful about it.</p><p>"Do you think she would think I'm trying too hard if I do my tie like that? Or is that what girls like? Crap. That one time in my life when I could use an older brother."</p><p>It's too sweet, but that sweetness holds such bitterness that Scorpius is barely keeping the awful grimace off his face.</p><p>"You know, I think Samantha might just be one of those people who appreciate the efforts. More things to do with your fingers that way, too–"</p><p>Scorpius, shut the fuck up. This is <i>not</i> helping.</p><p>"Yeah? Hmm... And what do <i>you</i> think, Scor? Do I look...?" He makes some vague hand movements, turning around.</p><p>Scorpius' heart clenches. <i>You look too good to be true. Please, stop. Stop doing this to me.</i></p><p>"Great. Very– You– Yeah, I like it. I mean, I'm sure she will like it. Everybody will stare at you, I'll bet, so if you want to make–" Stop. Talking. Weird. Shit. "You know. Make an impression. This is great."</p><p>"Yeah? I feel kind of ridiculous. It's not a <i>date</i>, technically, we're just going to work on a bloody school project, Merlin, I <i>am</i> overdoing it, aren't I? What the hell has happened to me, I was never– like <i>this</i> before. Scor, please slap me or– shake me or something. <i>I need help.</i>"</p><p>Scorpius bites his lip, trying not to scream, 'I AM ALL YOU NEED, YOU MORON, PLEASE, UNDERSTAND THIS FINALLY', although the mere shock at the intensity of the urge works like a bucket of icy cold water.</p><p>"Come on, Al, stop thinking, just go and– do your thing. You'll do awesome, I'm sure. And remember to be back before curfew." With that, he pushes a somewhat stiff Al out of the dorm, shuts the door closed, and throws himself face-first onto his unmade bed. A scream that he lets out seems to have torn something out of his very soul.</p><p>
  <i>What the fuck was that?!</i>
</p><p>Maybe he's caught some kind of fever. He should probably visit Hospital Wing, he hasn't been there in ages.</p><p>It really is a serious problem that nobody has come up with a potion for a broken heart yet. Scorpius would drug himself with that shit every day, happily.</p>
<hr/><p>The following days Scorpius spends mostly on practising relaxation through breathing. He has to. Otherwise, his jagged nervous system will break down sooner than later.</p><p>If he's being honest with himself, Scorpius isn't at all surprised that Albus and Samantha have grown closer to each other: Al is just too precious to not fall in love with him at least a little bit if he opens up to you, and long-term school projects are only an additional factor to help the budding relationship develop.</p><p>How bloody <i>cliché</i> is that.</p><p>Turns out Scorpius is playing the third wheel now, because, apparently, the novelty of a new relationship is so much more exciting than the comfortable friendship you've been tending to for years.</p><p>Scorpius is saddened at the biting bitterness that is poisoning him, but he can't help it. It's impossible. Where are their chitter-chatters during breakfasts? They drown as soon as bloody <i>Samantha</i> walks into the Great Hall. And Scorpius loses his appetite immediately (he swears he's lost a few pounds over the course of a week). Where are their lazy walks around the castle between classes? Ask the portraits, they've heard enough of that vomit-inducing sweet whispering and obnoxious sloppy sounds that Scorpius dreams were his.</p><p>The worst thing is, apart from that, Albus remains the same. The same sweet (if a bit grumpy), caring boy Scorpius can't help but love. He cannot bring himself to hate his best friend. It's not like Al is doing it all on purpose. Scorpius sees that Albus is trying to juggle between him and his new girlfriend. He understands that. He appreciates that.</p><p>He still dies inside whenever he sees Albus with a girl.</p><p>Why. Why him. Why did he have to fall for his straight best friend.</p><p>Scorpius tried to win over his feelings towards Al, but truthfully speaking, every single boy he lays his eyes on only reminds him of how much he would rather keep them shamelessly on his best friend. And how much more attractive he is. And how Scorpius will probably never have the same kind of relationship with any of those guys, because Albus is one in– there's not even a number for it.</p><p>He's simply <i>Albus</i>. No one could ever replace him.</p><p>Not even if Albus had a twin.</p><p>Speaking of...</p><p>"Wait. You've bought James a <i>book</i>? Wow, Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, you <i>are</i> a savage. What's he done to you, just tell me and I'll–"</p><p>"No, no, no, it's nothing like that, Al. Merlin. Do you honestly hold such a low image of your brother? We have talked some over the last summer, and I get that as a younger sibling you are biased, but hey, he can be pretty nice. People do mature, you know."</p><p>Al was still biting his lip, a deeply doubtful look on his face.</p><p>"Okay... let's agree that James has developed some kind of maturity over the past year. Why a book, though? I've never seen a book in his hands, apart from some quidditch stuff. Not even a school book. I'm telling you, this one is going to stay on his shelf and collect dust, at best."</p><p>"Well, I've seen him in the library a few times, and he did have reading glasses on, so I suppose he was there to read."</p><p>"<i>Reading glasses</i>?" Al snorts. "Uh-uh, I'll <i>bet</i> he only bought them to have more people cramming into his bed."</p><p>Scorpius shrugs. He thinks James looked rather fine with those glasses on, but mostly because it made Scorpius imagine how <i>Albus</i> would look in them. They'd suit his face so well... And no, they weren't 'Harry Potter glasses'! They had an elegant square shape that would perfectly emphasize that gorgeous square line of Albus' jaw...</p><p>Merlin, he really shouldn't be thinking that <i>right now</i>. The way he has tucked his cock would keep a potential boner hidden but all the more uncomfortable.</p><p>Blinking himself back to reality, he realises Al is flicking through the book Scorpius bought for James, a sort of flushed look on his face.</p><p>Scorpius doesn't want to dig too deep into the reason for why that expression is making his stomach tighten in both disappointment and arousal.</p><p>"So, uhm." Al closes the book. "Good gift for a..." He glances at the title. "Fish pie connoisseur, huh?"</p><p>Scorpius bites his lip. <i>Come on, Scorpius, it's now or never. You have a perfect opportunity!</i></p><p>"I suppose James would appreciate it, even if you're right and he's not, in fact, secretly a <i>book</i> connoisseur. This particular one is not something that could feed our friendly discussions, I'm afraid, but I thought it could come in handy for him. What do you think?"</p><p>Albus is still eyeing the book in a rather strange manner.</p><p>"Still hard to tell, honestly, I mean, James and books... even <i>that</i> kind of books. Well, let's wish this one good luck. So, uhm. From what you're saying," he begins tentatively, "I get you're not into...?" He trails off, eyeing the book meaningfully.</p><p>Scorpius blinks at him. Then looks down at the book. Salazar, his brain is going through some ice age whenever he's around Al, or what.</p><p>"Well, I most definitely can't stand fish. Both literally and figuratively speaking. That hasn't changed. <i>Sausages</i>, on the other hand, now, that is an entirely different thing. Is, uhm," he nibbles on his bottom lip, "Is that okay with you?"</p><p>Al shrugs, but his expression grows even more unreadable and Scorpius is slowly starting to lose his breath. "Sure, why wouldn't it be. Everything stays the same. Unless you are not okay with, like, the hugs and stuff...?"</p><p>That expression just makes Scorpius want to reach out and hug him right then and there, Merlin.</p><p>"No, I'm okay! Everything can stay, yeah, I don't want any change." He releases a breath he's been holding. "I'm glad."</p><p>Albus smiles, and the warmth washes over Scorpius– gods, this is such a brilliant torture.</p><p>"You know, actually..." Scorpius clears his throat, but his tongue feels oddly uncomfortable in his mouth. "Actually, I have– something to tell you. I didn't want to but–" Now. Or. Never. Perfect opportunity! "I can't keep it in any longer." He glances at Al, almost apologizingly.</p><p>Al's expression immediately morphs into a concerned frown, the way he leans in towards Scorpius makes it somewhat both more and less difficult. "What is it?"</p><p>Scorpius takes a deep breath...</p><p>...and feels a wave of nausea.</p><p>
  <i>Oh god.</i>
</p><p>"I– uh, hang on..." He storms out of the dormitory.</p><p>He barely makes it to the bathroom before he locks the door and hovers over the toilet, begging his stomach to stop its violent spasms.</p><p>"Ugh..." he groans, his limbs shaking.</p><p>Merlin. He didn't realise he's gotten so nervous. What a rollercoaster it's been lately. He fears he won't last long.</p><p>Suddenly, there is a soft knocking on the bathroom door.</p><p>"Scorp?" <i>Shit</i>. "You okay there?"</p><p>
  <i>Deep breath, Scorpius, just take a nice deep breath.</i>
</p><p>"Y-yeah, 'm fine." Such shallow words.</p><p>"You sure? I'll be there, in case you need something, okay?"</p><p>Scorpius nods, instinctively, although Al obviously can't see him right now.</p><p>Merlin, no. He can't do this. He just can't. Al doesn't mind that he's gay. Okay. But what are the chances that he's gay as well? Scorpius has seen him doing <i>stuff</i> with girls, and he looked like he very much enjoyed himself. Scorpius would rather burn the stifling memory of that blasted evening when Al had come back to the dorms, hair in an even bigger disarray than usual (Scorpius' insides did a massive jump at the sight, that sent unbearable longing through Scorpius' body and nearly took his breath away), lips swollen and smeared with lipstick (that felt like a big, ugly <i>punch</i> to the guts), and a hazy look on his face (Scorpius wanted to fucking <i>crumble</i> at that point). He could bloody <i>smell</i> some kind of sweet, floral perfumes lingering on him, and the realisation of just what exactly made Al smell of them made him sick.</p><p>He was feeling like shit for a good week afterwards, even though when Al told him about his ventures, all worked up and eyes bright, he didn't sound like they went past the <i>decent</i> sort of activities. Maybe. Scorpius didn't know. He didn't want to know. But also, he did want to know and that inner conflict was making him restless. But he doesn't want to think too much about that. Not right now, not ever, if he has any say in it. The point stands, Al is into birds. Clearly. Scorpius hasn't seen him ogle any boys or do anything that would remotely speak 'I'm into guys as well'. Which is why Scorpius believes his friend would not feel comfortable should he find out that Scorpius has a crush on him.</p><p>A massive crush.</p><p>Scorpius is actually perfectly aware that this crush is a more serious thing – <i>much</i> more serious – but calling it simply 'a crush' is basically the only thing keeping him from, well, crushing under the weight of the feeling. It's pretty much the last and only thing that is still keeping him somewhat sane.</p><p>Maybe he should tell Albus the truth, after all... Albus will ask, inevitably, and what is Scorpius going to tell him? 'Nah, just some food poisoning, I knew I shouldn't have eaten that sandwich at Hog's Head today'?</p><p>I mean, it does sound legitimate. Also, that sandwich did concern Scorpius but he was <i>hungry</i> (weeks of eating half his usual amount of food per day came back with vengeance).</p><p>Nah, love confessions can wait. If not today, then maybe... maybe next week.</p><p><i>Or perhaps never, how about that</i>. Scorpius sighs.</p>
