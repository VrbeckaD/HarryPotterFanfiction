  <span>Chapter 1: Three Letters and a Surprise Visit</span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>Part 1:  Prongs</span>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span>The sun was shining over the garden and James was happy to be out flying on such a beautiful day. It had rained all week and he was desperate to get outside. His mother, Euphemia Potter,  was sitting on the porch watching him, her long grey hair pulled up into a neat bun. His father, Fleamont Potter was at a meeting at the ministry. James was an energetic 11 year old whose hair was always a mess but his parents had a hard time keeping up as they were older, nearing on their 80’s. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James threw his father’s old quaffle into the air and flew after it. He caught it with one hand but then quickly dropped it as a grey owl flew past him, landing gently in front of his mother. James knew what the owl meant, his Hogwarts letter had finally arrived, and he was happy to end his flight in order to retrieve it. His mother was smiling and holding the recently delivered letter in her hands. She held it out to James who grabbed it and read it three times in quick succession. By the end he was nearly jumping he was so happy. He was going to Hogwarts. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mum, can we go to Diagon Alley tomorrow? Dad will be home so we can all go.” His dark hair was even messier than usual and his mother stood up slowly patting it down in hopes that it may lay flat (her attempt was unsuccessful). </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes dear we can, now go put that letter somewhere safe and wash up for lunch.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The young boy ran inside clutching the letter in his hands tightly. His mother followed slowly behind enjoying the sight of her happy son.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As night fell and the moon rose steadily over the country James sat as still as he could in the front room of the Potter house awaiting the arrival of his father. Just as he was about to give up and wait in his room his father arrived with a pop. James jumped up and ran to him, jumping into his father’s arms in an excited embrace.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well hello James.” James’ father had grey hair that was a mess like his son’s but he had managed to keep it looking reasonably neat. He sat slowly in an arm chair across from the couch that James had been sitting on and smiled at his son signaling he was ready to hear whatever news had caused James’ excitement. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“My letter came today dad!” James was practically yelling and Mr. Potter brought his finger up and rested it against his lip hoping to quiet his rambunctious child. James’ voice dropped down and he continued. “It came while I was out flying and mum said we could go to Diagon Alley tomorrow. So…can we?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He stood still staring into his father’s blue eyes. Fleamont let out a small laugh before responding. “Of course James we’ll leave just after breakfast.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James nearly knocked his dad over rushing to tell his mother.</span>

  <span>Part 2: Padfoot</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was nearing lunch time and Sirius had been sitting still for far longer than he liked to admit. His brother Regulus was sitting beside him and was staring at the family tree placed in front of him with a look of great focus flashing across his face. Sirius pretended to read it but his mind was busy on other things. He was imagining all the fun he would have when he finally got to Hogwarts in September. He hadn’t received his letter yet but he knew that it was nearing the day he would. He was brought out of his trance by a small grey owl knocking on the window outside his father’s office at 12 Grimmauld place. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius leapt out of his chair and ran to the window opening it swiftly and grabbing the envelope from the clutches of the owl, who quickly flew away flapping its magnificent wings as it went. The stern looking tutor the Blacks had hired to teach their children grabbed the letter out of Sirius’ hand. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You can look at this after your lessons are over.” Her face and voice were laced with anger and it made a shiver run down Sirius’ spine.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius sat back down and continued staring at the family tree in front of him.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius had finally finished his lessons for the day and was released from his father’s office with his letter in hand at ten after one. He looked at it for a moment before noticing that Regulus was walking next to him, his eyes fixed on the letter. Sirius slowly pulled apart the closed edge of the envelope and lifted out the paper inside. It was addressed to him and signed at the bottom. He read over it carefully. Enjoying each word as it flooded over him. He was finally going to Hogwarts. Sirius handed the letter to his excited younger brother to peruse and smiled at the look of sheer joy on his small face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As Sirius and Regulus reached the kitchen they were surprised by the presence of their cousins, Andromeda and Narcissa, who were sitting around the table chatting. Bellatrix was staring into the fridge looking for something to eat, her dark hair pulled up into a messy bun atop her head.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hi Sirius, hi Regulus.” Andromeda smiled at her younger cousins. “I see you got your Hogwarts letter. We got ours today as well.” She pointed toward the folded letter lying in front of her. “Mother says we can go to Diagon Alley later this week. You must be very excited to get your wand and other supplies?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius nodded with a smile creeping across his face. He sat at the table with his cousins ready to eat after his long morning. </span>

  <span>Part 3: Wormtail</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Peter Pettigrew was a small boy with nothing that really set him apart from the other children in his neighbourhood. His hair was almost always dirty and his clothes didn’t quite fit right but he was basically an average 11 year old wizard. He had a hard time making friends but he didn’t let it bother him too much as he was always happy to sit and watch the neighborhood boys playing. Not to mention he knew he wouldn’t have to deal with it for much longer. He was sitting alone in his garden reading over the Hogwarts letter that had been delivered to his home earlier in the day. His eyes darted back and forth over the words and he soaked in every bit of it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Peter’s family had thought he might be a squib until the letter had arrived just before lunch. Peter loved the way the owl looked as it flew gently in through the window and he happily took the letter from him trading a few owl pellets. He immediately ran it into his mother who was sitting in a rocking chair knitting a scarf in red and gold. She smiled at her son as he handed her the letter. The look on her face made Peter feel even better than the letter had. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Peter. Peter. Come in for dinner dear.” Peter’s mother was standing at the door calling out to him and he was pulled out of his trance. Peter stood up and walked toward his mother folding the letter and placing it carefully into his pocket. “There you are dear, come on in we’re sitting down for dinner now.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He followed his mother into the house desperate for a delicious home cooked meal.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As the night became darker Peter sat in his room thinking about Hogwarts. His parents hadn’t stopped discussing it throughout dinner and he was happy to have so much to talk about with them. He stared out his window into the night wishing he could leave right then and there. He knew he wouldn’t be able to fall asleep so he decided he would rather read. He picked up a pile of papers from his desk. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They were out of order but he was able to fix that quickly. He started from the beginning. An article written by a reporter for the daily prophet. He had cut it out of the paper a few weeks earlier. The headline was cut off but he enjoyed it anyway. The article discussed the Hogwarts houses. He had Gryffindor highlighted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Peter slowly drifted off to sleep as he read the descriptions of the four houses.</span>

  <span>Part 4: Moony</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In a tall tree in the middle of the country a small boy had his nose stuffed in a book. It was not unusual to find Remus Lupin with his nose hidden in a book on a nice afternoon. His parents were sitting in the kitchen talking to a tall man with a white beard and half-moon spectacles. He had seen the man arrive from his position in the tree. Remus was intrigued by the stranger, the Lupin’s didn’t get many guests. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus pulled his face up from his book when he heard the familiar sound of footsteps approaching him. He looked down to see the old man walking toward him. Remus nearly dropped his book once he realized who the man was. He recognized his face from his chocolate frog collection. It was Albus Dumbledore the headmaster at Hogwarts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello Remus, do you mind if I join you.” Dumbledore smiled up at Remus in the tree and began to climb. Remus stared at him for a minute before responding with a curt nod, though it didn’t matter much as he was already in the tree. Dumbledore eventually reached the branch that Remus was sitting on and positioned himself comfortably. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So Remus, do you know who I am?” Dumbledore asked and Remus began nodding aggressively, almost causing himself to fall. “Well that’s good, then possibly you know why I am here?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Umm… no sir, I don’t.” Remus was beginning to become nervous. He had an idea as to why the professor was there, though he didn’t want to say it out loud. He was finally eleven but he knew he wouldn’t be able to attend Hogwarts, not with his “problem”. Though he was curious why the headmaster had to come to tell him personally.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well then, that is fine I am happy to explain. I am here to personally invite you to attend Hogwarts this coming year.” He was watching Remus hoping for any sign of understanding but the small boy seemed to be in a state of shock. “We have prepared the necessary safety procedures and there is a place where you will be able to safely transform on the full moon. It will be our little secret”.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus started to smile. His eyes widened and he looked truly pleased. “You mean I actually get to go to Hogwarts?” He was nearly shouting with excitement. Dumbledore nodded and let out a hearty laugh. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes Remus, you actually get to go to Hogwarts.”</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus was sitting in his room as the moon began to rise. There was still almost a week until the full moon but he still felt uncomfortable as the moon came into view. He was reading over the list of supplies he would need for school and thinking about the fun he would have, and the wonderful books he would read. Lyall Lupin was standing in his doorway when he looked up. Remus smiled when he saw his father.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Dad, I’m really going. I can’t believe it. I keep thinking it was a dream, but here it is, right in my hand.” Remus glanced back at the paper in his hand before quickly returning his eyes to his father. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m very happy Remus. Your mother and I are so proud of you and I know you will get even better once you have a thorough education. All those books you read are one thing but you will be studying under the leadership of one of the greatest wizards alive at the best school for wizardry in the world.” Remus smiled at his dad’s words but he could sense the fear in his voice. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus had never been away from his parents. But come September he would be away from them for a whole school year. He could feel the fear and excitement building up in the pit of his stomach.</span>
