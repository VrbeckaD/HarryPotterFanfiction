    <p>“—Could not get her off. I was down on her for fifteen minutes at least.”</p>
<p>“That’s generous! I only spent a few minutes down there because it seemed like she was ready, but then she never came!”</p>
<p>“Exactly!”</p>
<p>Draco’s focus was pulled from the novel he was half-through. He had eyed Blaise and the other boy when they chose to sit next to him and chat when he was <em>clearly</em> looking for peace from the two of <em>them,</em> but they had ignored him. He was sitting in the corner of the common room, and they had still found him.</p>
<p>It was so tough being this popular.</p>
<p>“Which bint are you on about?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Granger,” they responded together.</p>
<p>His eyes flipped to them, waiting for the joke.</p>
<p>“Granger who?” he tried, hopeful.</p>
<p>“Hermione Granger,” Blaise said slowly, like Draco was deaf. </p>
<p>Draco looked back and forth between them. “What about her?”</p>
<p>“She’s frigid or something,” the other boy said. Monty? Murphy? Draco tried not to learn his name in hopes that he wouldn’t need to know it, but he’d been following him and Blaise around since the start of the year. Being “8th years,” Draco, Blaise and Theo had started rooming with the 7th years, like Mocky here, and he’d been inescapable. </p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say ‘frigid,’” Blaise said, scholarly. “She can be quite responsive.”</p>
<p>Muphbert nodded his head vigorously. </p>
<p>“But she just doesn’t come,” Blaise continued.</p>
<p>Draco blinked. “We’re talking about Granger?”</p>
<p>“She’s not bad too look at, Draco. Even you have to admit that,” Blaise raised a brow at him. </p>
<p>Draco didn’t have to admit to anything. He was quite confused. </p>
<p>“Especially with the slim-pickings this year,” Blaise continued.</p>
<p>“Yes, such a shame everyone had to die, and all,” Draco said, sarcasm pouring off his tongue.</p>
<p>“Right you are!” Muggins said. He placed his hand over his heart. “I miss Lavender Brown. What a set she had on her.”</p>
<p>“So, you’ve slept with <em>Granger?</em>” Draco asked Blaise. </p>
<p>“A couple times.” Blaise leaned back in his chair. “She’s great, except –“ Blaise gestured to Morgan.</p>
<p>“She can’t come!”</p>
<p>Draco smirked. “Maybe not for you, Mullins.” The boy looked strangely at him. Draco could check “Mullins” off the list. </p>
<p>“Me neither.” Blaise admitted. He looked quite resigned to it, which was a first. Draco and Blaise had always been first to talk about girls and compare notes. Blaise was always trying to out-do him.</p>
<p>“Well,” Draco said. “The war was a stressful time. I’m sure it’s a side effect, or post-traumatic—“</p>
<p>“No, no.” Blaise leaned forward. “I got so worked up about it after the first time we did it, so I contacted Krum. Says she couldn’t back then, either!”</p>
<p>Something wasn’t sitting well with Draco. “How long have you been seeing, Granger?” he asked Blaise.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ve only been with her once –“</p>
<p>“Not you, Martin.”</p>
<p>“I’ve met up with her a few times.” Blaise shrugged. “I’m not <em>seeing</em> her.” Blaise glared at him. “You’re not honestly going to tell me who I can and can’t shag based on their blood status, are you Malfoy?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing like that,” Draco said. “I’m just surprised that Granger’s shagging people right and left.”</p>
<p>“Granger?” Theo walked into the common room. “I’ve shagged her. Bloody good time.”</p>
<p>Draco glared at him. What the hell was happening.</p>
<p>“But she can’t finish, right?”</p>
<p>Theo shrugged. “She screamed like a banshee for me.”</p>
<p>The three boys looked at him. </p>
<p>“Really?” Blaise asked, eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Back in October. I had her in a classroom during Prefect rounds.” Theo smiled and Draco wanted to hit him. “Bent her over a teacher’s desk and we went at it.”</p>
<p>“And she came?” Draco asked.</p>
<p>“Definitely.” Theo smirked. Draco clenched his jaw.</p>
<p>“Oooh. Oh god.” </p>
<p>Draco looked over and Blaise had his eyes closed, running his hands up his chest. </p>
<p>“Yeah. YES! YES! Theo. YES!”</p>
<p>Blaise opened his eyes and dropped his hands. “Like that?” he deadpanned. </p>
<p>“I mean…” Theo glared at him. “She wasn’t faking it, if that’s what you mean.”</p>
<p>Blaise smirked. “She was. She told me she hasn’t ever had an orgasm.”</p>
<p>Draco looked at him. This was something she admitted? That was so personal. An image floated through Draco’s head – Granger and Blaise, wrapped up in white sheets, running their hands over each other after finishing. Blaise kissing her neck as she spilled her darkest secrets—</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Draco said, standing and spinning to look at the room. “Have <em>all</em> of you gits slept with Hermione Granger?”</p>
<p>A small first year looked back at him and shook his head “no.”</p>
<p>“<em>Draco</em> hasn’t?” Theo crossed his arms in front of his chest and looked him up and down. “I’m surprised. I thought you would have jumped her on the Hogwarts Express this year.”</p>
<p>Draco’s neck felt hot. “Excuse me? Why?”</p>
<p>Theo shrugged. “No more Voldemort. Your father’s locked up. No more blood purity bullshit to worry about. Weasley and Potter aren’t here and Pansy’s in France.”</p>
<p>Draco blinked at him. “None of those are reasons to ‘jump her on the Hogwarts Express.’”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright.” Blaise stood, grinning. “The most important thing right now, is that Theo thinks he got her off.” Blaise chuckled. “Theo thinks that Viktor Krum couldn’t do it, Blaise Zabini couldn’t do it, but he <em>did</em> it.”</p>
<p>“I said none of those things –“</p>
<p>“So, I say,” Blaise tilted his head, “he should give it another whirl and let us know how he fares.”</p>
<p>“Fine!” Theo threw up his hands. “I’ll talk to her in class tomorrow, see if I can meet up with her this week.”</p>
<p>Draco’s eye twitched. It should be harder than that to have sex with Hermione Granger. She was… difficult. Wasn’t she? He looked around at all the boys who’d had sex with her over the past few months (first year excluded) and wondered why she was sleeping around.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~</p>
</center>Draco watched her through classes the next day. She was still the same swotty know-it-all she always was. He tried to imagine her bent over a desk for Theo, and the image made his neck prickly.<p>He packed up his books and was just heading out the door when he saw Theo approach her. He stopped and watched as she smiled warmly at him. He couldn’t hear what they were saying, but Theo touched her arm… like they were friends. Or lovers. And she let him.</p>
<p>Draco left.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~</p>
</center>She had nice tits, he supposed. And she was thin, but not too thin. And while her legs were long, apparently she’d spread them for every dolt over the age of seventeen. Or at least that’s what he was surmising at this point.<p>Blaise had done more research. Justin Finch-Fletchley had had her. Ernie Macmillan had had her. Terry Boot had had her. </p>
<p>None of them had gotten her off. Draco was with Blaise when he questioned Ernie, and Draco hadn’t been able to stop himself from asking, “How did you approach her about it?”</p>
<p>Ernie had lifted his brows and said, “She came on to me, actually. We were chatting and she asked if I felt like meeting up with her sometime. Very forward of her, but… charming too.” Ernie had nodded, smiling, like the whole thing was an old fairy tale or a fond memory.</p>
<p>“That’s about how it was with me,” Blaise had said. And Draco had glowered as the two of them talked about her perfect tits.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~</p>
</center>It wasn’t that he found her attractive. Not at all. It’s just that Draco had been known to be a generous lover. No one complained (and he did write to Pansy and she did confirm that she had never faked it with him, why do you ask, Draco?) and he was sure that all the witches he’d been with had a good time.<p>So, if there was some kind of a competition here, some kind of a reward, then he wanted it.</p>
<p><em>That</em> is why he was in the library on a Saturday night, watching Granger compile a list of research texts for the History of Magic paper. It was assigned yesterday, and wasn’t due for three weeks. That’s how he knew he could find her here.</p>
<p>She checked her list and then wandered to the stacks closest to his table. This was as good a time as any.</p>
<p>He smoothed back his hair, then shook it back out, hoping for a messy look.</p>
<p>“Hello, Granger.” He leaned against the stack and tried to smile normally. Without the usual Granger-reserved smirk.</p>
<p>She looked over at him. She took in his easy pose and his odd smile and raised a brow.</p>
<p>“Are you next in line?”</p>
<p>His eyes widened, and he coughed. “I… I mean,” he stammered.</p>
<p>“Save it, Malfoy,” she said, and pulled the book off the shelf. “I won’t be your little ‘experiment.’ Tell the rest of the Slytherins to leave me alone, too.”</p>
<p>She moved away, back to her table. He stood, dumbfounded, still leaning against the stack. He jerked when she disappeared from view, and strode quickly to find her.</p>
<p>“Who’s giving you trouble?”</p>
<p>She stood next to her table, referencing her list of books she was pulling. She didn’t look up at him when she said, “Well, Nott is ready to try again, now that he knows that there’s ‘fame and glory’ waiting for him. And Harper has tried walking me to Hogsmeade—”</p>
<p>Draco’s eyes squinted. “Harper? He couldn’t find a G-spot with a locator spell.”</p>
<p>“And you could?” She looked at him from over her shoulder.</p>
<p>He gave her a look that said “of course.”</p>
<p>“It’s not just the Slytherins. I’ve had other boys approach me due to the Slytherins’ big mouths. Thanks for that, by the way.”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t me. That was Blaise.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes. “Oh, then, thank you for not participating and not fueling the rumor mill.”</p>
<p>Draco turned his eyes down on the table. She faced him.</p>
<p>“Look Malfoy, what do you think you’re going to get out of me.”</p>
<p>“An orgasm.”</p>
<p>She chuckled. It was like the laugh bubbled from her chest, and her smile appeared unbidden. Like she hadn’t meant to laugh, but she actually found it all very funny.</p>
<p>“Wonderful,” she quipped.</p>
<p>“Multiple, actually.”</p>
<p>She laughed again, less taken by surprise this time. He’d never seen her smile like that before.</p>
<p>“And you’re up to the task, Malfoy?” She turned to him and crossed her arms over the book in front of her chest.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And if I told you that the closest I’d ever gotten to getting off wasn’t with penetration, it was with his mouth on me?”</p>
<p>She lifted a brow at him. He swallowed.</p>
<p>“I’d say ‘Lead the way to the Restricted Section.’”</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes at him. “And the second closest I’d gotten was when the guy didn’t get to come at all?”</p>
<p>He blinked at her. “That’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Or when he was tied up, blindfolded, and whipped, and I got to be in complete control, using a strap-on on him?”</p>
<p>Draco's cheeks were warm. She stared at him, holding his gaze. “I’d say,” he began, voice cracking, “’Tell me when to meet you at the Room of Requirement.’” </p>
<p>She snorted. “You’re really invested, aren’t you?” She moved around him, heading toward the back wall. He followed. “All this just to claim you made the Gryffindor Lioness purr?”</p>
<p>“Were any of those situations real? Have you really…” He couldn’t bring himself to repeat what she’d said about the… bondage.</p>
<p>“Not really.” She smiled. “I mean I’ve tried a few BDSM things here and there, and of course it’s great for a guy to go down on me…”</p>
<p>Draco looked over his shoulder as he followed her. He couldn’t believe she was talking about this. In a <em>library.</em></p>
<p>“But nothing that got me there,” she finished.</p>
<p>He swallowed. “Right. What else have you tried? Or what’s worked best?”</p>
<p>She glanced at him over her shoulder as she stopped in front of a shelf. “I’ve tried just about everything one can try by themselves…”</p>
<p>Draco’s mind took a small vacation. Hermione Granger in her four-poster, with her curtains drawn and a silencing spell cast –</p>
<p>“And I have tried it with a girl, but I didn’t like that as much.”</p>
<p>Draco’s mind took a long sabbatical. </p>
<p>“With who?” he asked. He felt his neck getting hot.</p>
<p>She looked over at him as she pulled another book from the shelf. She raised a brow and smirked. “Wouldn’t you like to know.”</p>
<p>She started moving down the shelf, looking for another book. He did. He did really want to know.</p>
<p>He refocused. Fifty percent of the problem had vanished, he realized, so he went with that. “So, you’re sure you like men best?”</p>
<p>“Yes, pretty sure.”</p>
<p>“What is it you like about men?”</p>
<p>She looked over at him, and for the first time her cheeks turned pink. Interesting.</p>
<p>“What do I like about them?” Her eyebrows shot up. “Well…” She turned to look back at the books. She took a moment to think, and Draco took a moment to study the lines of her neck.</p>
<p>“I guess I like that they’re bigger than me. Their height and their chests.” </p>
<p>Draco resisted the sudden urge to stand tall. </p>
<p>“You could find a tall woman. A broad woman,” he suggested.</p>
<p>“Hm, yes.” She stared at the books. She pursed her lips and shook her head slightly. “I didn’t care much for the other girl’s breasts though when we were together. They’re lovely to stare at sometimes, but I didn’t really do anything with them.”</p>
<p>Draco swallowed before he asked, “What else about men then?”</p>
<p>“I guess…” She looked down at her feet as she thought. “I like their bodies. The muscles. Women have lovely soft curves but that’s not what I fantasize about.”</p>
<p>Draco really should have planned better for this conversation. He had honestly expected to talk to her, get her to commit to a time and place, and leave. Not discuss sex and Granger in bed with a girl and what she likes and what she fantasizes about –</p>
<p>“I think I just like the masculine energy, you know?” She looked up at him, expecting him to agree. </p>
<p>He didn’t know. But he maybe understood. “Do you like to be dominated?” She pursed her lips at him, like she was ready to end the conversation. “I only mean, because of the masculine energy thing. I guess, maybe I mean, do you like to be taken care of. In bed. Or do you like being in charge?”</p>
<p>She blinked at him. “Not really one way or the other.” She stared at the book in her hands, like she was really thinking. She pulled her lip between her teeth in a mindless way that had Draco’s hands sweating.</p>
<p>“Have you ever done it in the library?” he asked, without censoring his mouth at all. He waited for her to roll her eyes and tell him to bugger off.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She turned and headed to a different stack of books, without even a blush on her cheeks. Draco narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“With who?!”</p>
<p>She turned to look at him. “Zabini.”</p>
<p>He felt ice in his veins. Zabini had stolen something from him he didn’t even know he wanted.</p>
<p>“How?” he found himself asking. </p>
<p>She scoffed at him. “<em>How?</em>”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I wanna know what he did wrong.”</p>
<p>She smiled and pulled a gold book down from a high shelf. “He didn’t do anything wrong,” she said. “Malfoy, I’m telling you. It’s just something that’s a part of my biology. It’s rather funny watching all of you try to ‘earn’ something you can’t have though.”</p>
<p>She laughed a bit. He blushed and stepped toward her. “I’d like to try. If you’ll let me.”</p>
<p>She looked up at him. He was one step away from her, so she had to tilt her neck a bit to see his eyes. There was something strange in her expression, like a curiosity or a wariness.</p>
<p>He narrowed his eyes at her, and tried, “Or even if you won’t let me.” He let his eyes darken with sinister thoughts, and he stepped in to her again. She frowned at him, and her curiosity was gone. He relaxed.</p>
<p>“I’ve already tried non-consensual fantasies. Not my style.” She bit the inside of her cheek and reached for the book. His arm jumped and reached for it first. </p>
<p>“Okay,” he said, handing her the heavy book. She stared at him, and he watched her eyes flit between his, feeling the heat from her body.</p>
<p>“Is there money on this?”</p>
<p>He blinked and his vision was clear again. “Money?”</p>
<p>“Some kind of bet to see who can make me scream first?” Her eyes were cold. They’d been almost warm a moment ago.</p>
<p>“Not that I’m in on.”</p>
<p>“So, you’re really just interested in the glory of it?” She said it so condescending.</p>
<p>“Actually,” he said, shrugging, “I’m in it for the academics now.” He smiled at her, teasing her. “Research and trial and error. All very interesting to me.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes. She smirked and said, “Trial and error? Who says you’re getting a set of ‘trials.’ What if you only have one shot?”</p>
<p>He licked his lips and was surprised when her eyes drifted down to them. “Then I better get it right the first time.” </p>
<p>Draco reached for the books she held at her hip and carefully removed them, interested to find that she didn’t stop him. He kept his eyes on hers as he bent to place them on the floor next to her feet. He stood tall again, and gently touched her hip, turning her until her back was against the stacks.</p>
<p>She moved easily, but looked away from him. “Here? Zabini had the decency to take me to the Restricted Section,” she teased, but he could tell that she was nervous.</p>
<p>“Ah, but that didn’t work, did it?” he said, coming to stand in front of her. “Trial and error.”</p>
<p>She looked around quickly. There hadn’t been a single person near them since they began talking in the other section of the library. Saturday night.</p>
<p>Before she could argue, he stepped in closer to her, causing her to look up at him. Taller and wider, he remembered. He slowly dropped to his knees in front of her. Her eyes went wide, which he thought was interesting, seeing as how she was probably more experienced than he was at this point.</p>
<p>Draco kept watch on her face, looking for her to deny him. She bit her lip. He placed his hand on her calf, wrapping his fingers around the slope of it. He dipped his head, and pressed his lips against her right knee. He felt her hips shift.</p>
<p>“What if someone sees?” </p>
<p>He looked up at her, keeping his mouth close to her skin. “I hope they do.” He smirked as she looked down at him and saw her shiver as his breath hit her knee. </p>
<p>He held her eyes and pressed another light kiss above her knee. Her lashes fluttered, and the mix of curiosity and wariness was back.</p>
<p>She said nothing so he kissed her a little higher. From this angle, he could watch her chest move in and out. He kissed closer to mid-thigh, right under her skirt. His right hand moved up her calf, sliding along the back of her leg, and coming forward to play with the hem of her skirt, starting to lift up –</p>
<p>“You can’t be angry with me when it doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>His hand froze, and his eyes snapped to hers.</p>
<p>“<em>When?</em>” He tried arrogance.</p>
<p>She just nodded. “It will be nobody’s fault, so you can’t take it out on me.”</p>
<p>He blinked up at her. “Of course.”</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, leaned her head back on the shelf, and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Draco smiled at her skirt hem. He placed his left hand on her other calf, sliding up until it was at the hem of her skirt on the other side. He paused once to kiss her other knee, and then used both hands to push her skirt up. She pressed her thighs together just as he got to the top of her legs, and Draco smiled. Until he saw her plain white knickers. </p>
<p>He swallowed. Just like Granger. She’s done it with a girl, tried some BDSM shit, done it in the Restricted Section, but she’s still wearing exactly what you’d expect underneath her skirt. He wasn’t sure if he would have been more shocked to find a lacy red thong, or even <em>no</em> underwear. But he was definitely warm thinking of her still wearing this kind. Like she had never been touched by another.</p>
<p>His hands still held her skirt up, fingers on her hipbones. She held her thighs together tight, and her hips were almost tilted away from him. He pressed his mouth to the top of her mound, his nose brushing the top of her knickers, and he felt the muscles in her hips and thighs squeeze. He looked up at her and her eyes were closed, lip pulled between her teeth.</p>
<p>He could smell her. She was already getting wet. He kissed her there again, and smiled against her. </p>
<p>This was going to work. </p>
<p>He lifted her skirt higher, tucking the front of it into the waistband. He didn’t want to disappear under it. He’d like to see as much of this as possible. </p>
<p>He kissed the top of her thigh, right next to the fabric of her knickers, letting his tongue slip out and press against her there. He heard her take a breath. He closed his mouth around the spot, sucking gently, nipping lightly, and pulling at the skin. He repeated the same action on the other thigh. </p>
<p>Her thighs were still shut, and while he could ask her to open them, he’d rather let her do it herself. </p>
<p>He pressed his mouth over her knickers again, same spot, but this time he sucked the fabric, and pressed his tongue against it. His hands traveled back down from her waistband, and settled on the width of her hips, fingers pressing light circles into her backside.</p>
<p>He lowered his mouth and kissed her right over her clit. </p>
<p>And her thighs opened. And her hands grabbed the shelf. </p>
<p>Frigid, she was not. </p>
<p>He slid his hands over her hips, bringing his thumbs to center. He swiped them down, grazing her clit and down to her core. He brought them back up the same path, over and over, on top of the fabric, letting his palms slide against her thighs as they journeyed.</p>
<p>He looked up at her. Her face was pink, and she wet her lips with her tongue. Her eyes were still closed, but her chest moved out and in, and he wanted her so badly to open her shirt. But that would be for him. Not for her.</p>
<p>He looked back down at her hips, tilting toward him now. Somehow her feet had come to be on either side of his knees, and she was leaning back on the shelves. </p>
<p>He was hard already. Maybe if she came, she’d let him have her.</p>
<p>His cock jumped at the thought of bending her over one of the library tables, or just right here against these shelves.</p>
<p>His lips pressed against her clit again, and a soft sound came from her lips. He let his tongue press against her, and then run from where she was wettest, to where her clit should be. He took his time, slipping up over the fabric of her knickers, and every path he started she let out a small sigh. </p>
<p>He wondered if she’d be loud when she finally came. He should have silenced the area, but then he realized he didn’t care. He wanted everyone to know that he made her scream.</p>
<p>She heaved a breath above him. He had been pressing harder and harder on each swipe up, thinking about her screaming his name. His tongue was practically inside of her except for the wet knickers between them. </p>
<p>He reached up and started to roll them down, finding it hard to breathe as her pretty pink pussy appeared. She was glistening. Her knickers were barely down to her knees when he abandoned them and reached up to pull her lips apart. She gasped and he bent to continue the pattern he started over her knickers. </p>
<p>Her hips swung forward. He groaned into her and she gasped. One of her hands left the shelf and grabbed his head, gripping his hair. He took a deep breath before she pressed him against her. </p>
<p>He pulled her left knee up, and swung it over his shoulder. She gripped him harder. And his tongue dipped into her for the first time. </p>
<p>“Oh, god.” </p>
<p>He pushed in and out of her, desperate to hear her make more noises for him.</p>
<p>“Mmm. Please.”</p>
<p>His fingers found her clit and rubbed. Her hips slipped forward and then back, slapping against the shelves. His finger circled around her while his tongue dipped slower and she groaned, pressing his face against her. </p>
<p>He needed air but she was close. He knew it. His own hips began thrusting against nothing, and he wanted to pull himself out and wrap around himself, but he needed to focus on her. </p>
<p>He pulled away from her, even with her impressive grip on his head, took in air, and looked up at her face. The hand not on his head was pulling at her breast through her shirt, and he wanted to see them. </p>
<p>“Take off your shirt. Open it. Whatever.”</p>
<p>She opened her eyes and he didn’t expect to see the heat explode in them once she saw him. She gasped, even though he wasn’t currently touching her. He had her all over his face. And he tried licking his lips for her. She pressed her lips together and moaned.</p>
<p>“Take if off. I want to watch you play with your tits, Granger.”</p>
<p>She brought her hands to the top buttons and started moving through them slowly. He watched her, but let one of his thumbs slide through her lips, up and down, stopping just before finding her clit. </p>
<p>Her bra was white too. How dare she. He let out a deep breath, and she gasped. He’d breathed right against her. </p>
<p>“Keep the bra on. I want to watch you touch yourself.”</p>
<p>His voice was low and slick with her cum, and she nodded slowly and brought her fingers to her breasts, circling them. He moved his thumb up, and started circling her clit. She groaned, and his cock jumped.</p>
<p>She only completed three more circles before she started flicking her thumbs over her nipples, up and down. He copied the motion for her clit.</p>
<p>“Yes, god. Please.”</p>
<p>She moved faster on her nipples and he could see them pointed hard through the bra. He kept the same slower pace on her clit, just to see—</p>
<p>“Malfoy, please.”</p>
<p>He swallowed. He dropped his mouth to her clit and let his tongue do what her hands were. She moaned, a choked sound. She pulled at her tits with her fingers, pulling the peaks through the bra and plucking them like strings. He closed his mouth around her and sucked, tonguing her. </p>
<p>She flung her head back and reached for his head again, both hands pressing into his hair, holding him still while her hips moved. She let out little grunts on each thrust, fucking his face and pulling his hair until it hurt.</p>
<p>This witch would make him come in his trousers. </p>
<p>He slid a finger inside of her, and she panted. He found a good angle and got his second finger inside, loving how tight she was. Her hips moved into a different motion, moving down on his fingers, allowing him to take a breath and come back to her clit.</p>
<p>He licked at her as he pressed into her heat, pushing up and curling against her. She moaned. She was so close.</p>
<p>He continued this. Licking at her, fucking her with his fingers, and letting her hips stutter against his face. Her hands went back to her breasts. </p>
<p>After thirty more seconds of this, he tried a third finger inside of her. She cried out. He curled them. She gasped. He flicked her clit. She keened. </p>
<p>He pulled his mouth away, jaw tense. He tried to relax his muscles while he finger-fucked her. She was pulling at her tits again, eyes closed, hair a mess. </p>
<p>“Come on, Granger.”</p>
<p>She pressed her lips together, and squeezed her eyes closed. </p>
<p>“You look beautiful like this,” he whispered. She opened her mouth, gasping. “Dripping down my hand, fucking my face, and playing with your tits.”</p>
<p>Her fingers squeezed tighter on her breasts and she groaned. He saw her jaw clench. He brought his other hand to flick her clit once and the skin around her eyes pulled tight, squeezing. He curled his fingers inside of her and he finally realized the groan, the muscles clenching – it wasn’t pleasure. </p>
<p>He dipped his head to lick at her clit again and she bit her lip, face squeezed tight. </p>
<p>“Granger?”</p>
<p>“I can do this.” She gasped. “Keep going. I know I’m close.”</p>
<p>He watched as she pulled frantically at her nipples, biting her lip. His fingers changed their rhythm. She flinched. He pulled his hand away and started softly kissing at her hips. Then slow dips of his tongue, to long swipes against all of her. This lasted another five minutes.</p>
<p>He looked up and she had stopped playing with herself. She was looking down at him, face flushed, hair stuck to her face. He watched her as he gave another long slow swipe. Her eyes were empty. </p>
<p>“I think I’m done.”</p>
<p>He pulled away from her and wiped his hand on his sleeve. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean, the waves came and left. No tsunami.” She looked away. </p>
<p>He stood up, body aching. “That doesn’t mean you’re done.” His eyes were fierce and she lifted a brow.</p>
<p>“I told you you couldn’t be angry with me.” </p>
<p>“I’m not! I’m –“ He stopped. He was angry. He took a breath and looked at her, shirt open, bra covering perfect mounds.</p>
<p>He reached up, and softly cupped one of them, running his thumb over her. He looked at her face and she was watching him. He brought his other hand up, and repeated the action to her other breast. </p>
<p>He was still hard in his trousers, and he could feel the heat from her naked hips.</p>
<p>He slid his hands around the band of her bra, asking her with his eyes if he could. She nodded.</p>
<p>He unclasped it, and slid it off her shoulders. Dusky nipples, already pointing towards him. His hands slid around her again, holding the weight of each breast in his palms, but ignoring the peaks. He looked at her face, and she was closing her eyes again, licking her lips. He circled her nipples, like she had done earlier. Her mouth dropped open and she arched her chest forward a just a bit.</p>
<p>He smiled as her tits were offered to him. He kept his eyes on her face as he bent and licked the tip of her left breast. </p>
<p>She gasped, and her eyes opened, looking down at him. He pressed his tongue against her, and then closed his mouth around her. Her arms came up, holding onto his elbows. He moved to her other breast, this time blowing cool air on her. He felt her press her thighs together.</p>
<p>She watched him as he stood tall again, almost pressing against her, and flicked both of her nipples with his thumbs. She gasped. He leaned his face close to hers and her eyes widened. His thumbs swept circles and figure-eights, and she breathed in his breath. </p>
<p>He leaned forward and at the last second moved to her neck, moving quickly against her, pressing his lips against her shoulder and continuing to flick her breasts. He stepped into her and pressed himself against her stomach. She gasped and he sucked her skin. He used his tongue on her neck and nipped with his teeth, and her hands slid around his elbows and to his shoulders. </p>
<p>He pressed his hips against her again, and she squeezed at his shoulders. He flicked her breasts and rolled her between his fingers and she breathed against his neck. His hands glided to her ribcage and he pulled her up, pressing his hips forward, and she wrapped her legs around him. He thrust against her slowly, his trousers still on, but he felt her wetness seeping through. </p>
<p>Mouth still attached to her neck, he slid his arms around her back and cushioned where her skin had been pressed against the shelves. He tilted his hips against her again, and she groaned.</p>
<p>He pulled back to look at her. It wasn’t a pleasure groan. </p>
<p>“I think…” She bit her lip. “I think I’m too sensitive right now. Over-stimulated.”</p>
<p>She looked away from him. Her cheeks were red. </p>
<p>“Okay,” he said. “We can try something else.”</p>
<p>“No, I think I’m done.”</p>
<p>She pressed her lips together and let her legs drop. He felt a wave of disappointment run through him.</p>
<p>“I can do other things—“</p>
<p>“No, of course you can,” she cut him off. She looked up with an open face and even placed her hand on his cheek. “Remember, it’s not you. It’s me.”</p>
<p>“You can’t just give up!” His eyes were hot and she held his face.</p>
<p>“The problem is that you came here with the express purpose of doing something impossible,” she tried to explain. “That’s why you’re angry right now.”</p>
<p>“No!” He stuttered for a beat. “It’s… it’s…”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, Malfoy.” She raised a brow. “I can still take care of you?” He felt her hand slide against the front of his trousers, and his cock jumped against her even as his brain pushed him away.</p>
<p>He stepped back. “No! How is that fair!” He stared at her with wide eyes. “I shouldn’t get to come if you don’t!”</p>
<p>She laughed. She actually laughed. “That’s a first.” She smiled. She crossed her arms over her naked chest.</p>
<p>Draco realized that boys like Blaise, Theo, even a few faceless girls had gotten off with Hermione Granger while she just laid there. </p>
<p>“You’re not a <em>hole</em> for us to try our luck on!”</p>
<p>Her jaw dropped like she was going to fight him, before realizing he was saying something sort of nice.</p>
<p>“No!” He adjusted himself in his pants. “Meet me back here tomorrow, Granger and we’ll try something new.” He started to march off then turned back, pausing in front of her. He reached for her arms and gently pulled them down from her chest.</p>
<p>He took in the sight of her nipples, still peaked from earlier or the temperature. He tilted his head at the blush on her chest. He reached forward, and lifted one breast, memorizing the weight of it.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” </p>
<p>He looked up at her face, giving him that curious wariness again. “I’m gonna wank off to your tits, Granger. I need a good visual aid.”</p>
<p>She blinked at him.</p>
<p>He tweaked the breast in her hand, and she sucked in air. </p>
<p>He marched out of the library as well as he could in that state, and headed for the broom closet just a corridor away.</p>
