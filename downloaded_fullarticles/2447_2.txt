    <p>Harry was sleeping lightly when the alarm went off. He sat bolt right up and out of instinct reached over to turn the alarm clock off. However, it wasn't his alarm clock making the klaxon noise and with this revelation, he was on his feet and scrambling to get dressed as quickly as possible. In spite of his haste, he paused for a moment - his belt unbuckled, one arm in his cloak and his glass skewed so that one of the arms had gone and lost itself in his unruly black mane - reached for the alarm clock again and checked the time before flipping the face to the family clock. </p><p>The numbers and marks around the clock disappeared, instead replaced by eight different points: home, school, work, travelling, lost, hospital and Mortal peril; while the hands of the clock multiplied so that every member of his family was represented, and moved to illustrate their current state. </p><p>His wife, Ginny Potter, had her hand resting on work, and Harry knew that it would be there for another couple of hours. The qudditch championships were fast approaching and the Holyhead Harpies had to a good shot at the title, which meant early morning drills to keep them in tip top fighting shape. </p><p>His sons, James and Albus, were set to travelling, as they were both visiting their uncle, Bill Weasley and his family in France. It was summer vacation and Bill had offered to have all the kids round (most likely Fleur's idea) and everyone agreed that it would be a fun trip for the kids and once work died down for everyone else, a nice family reunion. His daughter, Lily - on the other hand - had her hand next to his own at home. She had so desperately wanted to travel with her brothers, who'd left yesterday, but a bout with the cold had left her weak and Harry wanted to keep an eye on her and make sure she was feeling a lot stronger before sending her to join her brothers and cousins. </p><p>Finally, the hands for his best friends Ron WeasleyÂ  and Hermoine Granger were also represented on the clock and while Hermoine's stood alongside Ginny's at work, Ron's was pointed at lost. Harry would usually be concerned but there were more pressing matters and he knew that Ron wasn't in any immediate danger (or his hand would be on mortal peril).</p><p>Seeing this all made Harry sigh in relief, as he'd assumed the alarm - which had now ceased - had something to do with one of them. His fears laid to rest, Harry finished getting dressed and before heading downstairs, took a quick look in the mirror. </p><p>At thirty, Harry had lived through his fair share of trouble and while it hadn't claimed his life, it had left its mark in the form of lines that aged him a little more than he'd like to admit and although his hair currently covered it, there was also the lightning bolt scar that had set him down this death-and-disaster-filled path from the time he was one. However, the scar had been dormant for the last thirteen years and whatever was going on, it didn't seem to be related to the scar or Voldemort, the powerful dark wizard that had given it to him. </p><p>With that, Harry left the confines of his bedroom and headed downstairs. The lights flickered on as he made his way down, but they didn't obscure the faint blue light radiating from the living room; where he was greeted by a cougar-shaped patronus sitting on the living room coffee table. The moment it saw him, it began to speak; a smooth yet obviously tired voice of the deputy head of the auror office, Susan Bones, emanating from its closed mouth. </p><p>"Sorry to disturb you at home, Harry," she began. "But there's an urgent case that requires your attention. I'll be waiting in your office." </p><p>Once it had relayed it's message, the patronus evaporated and the living room was plunged into a darkness. Harry sighed and flicked his wand twice: the first flick illuminated the living room, while the second procured him a cup of steaming black coffee. He drank it as he began casting a charm that would alert him when Lily woke up (a charm he'd forgotten the name of and thus dubbed the "sleeping beauty" charm) and once both were finished, he returned the cup to the kitchen, killed all the lights in the house and walked out the door. Harry walked for a moment and upon reaching the necessary distance, turned on the spot and disappeared.</p>
