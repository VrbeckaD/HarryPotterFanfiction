    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius came into the kitchen at Grimmuald place where Remus was helping Harry and the others with their homework which was spread like autumn leaves over the kitchen table.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> He cleared his throat loudly and Remus looked up from where he was explaining something harry had written in his latest essay.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hi Sirius, how’d it go?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I, er, I need to talk to you Moony.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A frown line creased Remus’ forehead. Sirius looked uncommonly, well, serious. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Okay, excuse me Harry.” Harry nodded and Remus got up and followed Sirius into the neighbouring room. Harry, Ron, Hermione and the Twins looked at each other and instantly reached for the extendible ears, sliding them under the door in record speed. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“… alright Padfoot?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Huh? Oh. Yes, yes I’m fine I just…” He sighed, “Remus when were you going to tell me about Harry?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“About Harry what?” Remus sounded utterly bewildered now.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s just... do you remember that time you forgot to take your potion?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus’ voice was flat when he responded. “I’m hardly going to forget.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Right. Well you know Dumbledore had Severus look through your memories to make sure you hadn’t, you know…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They heard an intake of breath and Lupin’s voice was shaky when he responded. “Oh God. Did I… did I attack someone, k-kill someone?” He sounded almost close to tears, he was so panicked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What? NO! God no, nothing like that. It’s just… I mean maybe he was mistaken, but Severus he, well, he also saw something else while looking through your memories. He didn’t mention it to anyone until today, but I don’t think he knew what it meant.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Just spit it out already Sirius.” Lupin was clearly on edge with fright.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Right. Well he said, I mean he implied that”, he took a deep breath, “Harry might be your mate.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The silence was so complete you could have heard a pin drop. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry and the others waited with bated breath, then they heard a long slow exhale from Remus.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It doesn’t matter.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Doesn’t…”, Sirius started angrily, but Remus cut him off.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No, it doesn’t.” Harry could just imagine the glare Sirius must've got to shut him up then. “I would never harm Harry, you know that. He’s James’ son for Pete’s sake.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You don’t get to chose your mate.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t you think I know that?! Hell I know that better than you do. And if I did, do you really think I would have chosen someone 20 years my junior who also happened to be my student and son of my best friend?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You love him.” Sirius stated. His tone not quite accusatory.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course I do. I couldn’t not love him. But that doesn’t mean that I have to do anything or that he ever has to know. It’s not safe.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“If this is you getting all self sacrificing over being a werewolf again” Sirius began</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Dammit Sirius, do you really want me in a romantic relationship with your own godson?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius shut his mouth. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Like I said”, Remus continued, his tone somewhat calmer now, “It doesn’t matter.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They heard a sigh through the extendable ears, Sirius sounded defeated, “I’m sorry Remus, I know how long you’ve waited for your mate.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t Siri, just don’t.” Harry thought he’d never heard Lupin sound so tired.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I just wanted you to be happy.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus gave him a wry smile, “Well it seems Fate has other ideas.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">Most of the others where too frozen with shock to notice at that moment, but Fred heard the two men approaching the door and swiftly reeled in the extendable ears.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius came in, clapped his hands together in mock joviality and asked what they all wanted for supper. Remus came in and sat back down next to Harry and everything resumed its previous pace, only with Hermione, the Twins and Ron sending Harry and each other surreptitious glances every few minutes. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Thankfully, Remus seemed too lost in his own train of thought to notice. Supper seemed to pass with the usual cheer, perhaps Harry was imagining it, but there seemed to be a slight undercurrent of tension that hadn’t been there before. Finally the table was cleared and Harry, Hermione and the Weaslys excused themselves, retreating to his and Ron’s room to discuss what they’d heard. It wasn’t until the door closed behind them that the outburst finally occurred. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You’re his MATE?” Ron exclaimed as soon as the door was closed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Keep it down, Ron”, Hermione complained with a swift glance at the door behind her, but she looked just as worried. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry shook his head, “I don’t understand, what did they mean by Mate?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“A werewolf’s mate is basically like a soulmate. They’re the one person they will ever truly love with all their being, I mean they can love others, but not to the same extent and certainly not romantically,” Fred said looking just as troubled as the other two.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry felt his legs go weak and he sat down on the bed behind him. <em>Romantically? Him and Remus?</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It doesn’t have to be romantic,” Hermione quickly chimed in, “From what I’ve read werewolves love their mates completely and unconditionally, it’s the strongest form of love there is. They just want them to be happy.” She sat down next to Harry on the bed looking at him and her expression softened. “Wolves don’t get to choose their Mates. They know who they are from the moment they meet them, but Remus didn’t chose this. You heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>what he said. He’s not expecting anything. This could actually be a good thing.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron exploded, “How in the Hell is being the chosen of a werewolf a good thing?!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione glared at him. “This is Remus we’re talking about. You know he’d never harm Harry and, frankly, I think, given the number of enemies we have to deal with right now, having another person who loves and will protect him can only be a good thing!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron and the Twins didn’t look convinced, but Hermione simply turned back to Harry, her hair swishing at them dismissively. "You don't have to do or feel anything you don't want to Harry. Remus cares about you, we already knew that, this is just a bit more than we thought he did."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"And not in the same way." Ron piped up, "I'm sorry Hermione, but you don't know as much about werewolves as we do, reading about them in books can only get you so far. Wizards have lived with them for centuries, the stories we hear..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Are just stories!" Hermione interrupted standing up angrily, "Ron this is just like with the House Elves, you take it for granted because it's all you've ever known, but I look at just the <em>facts</em> and the <em>fact</em><em>s</em> are that there is no reason for us to be worried about this."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron looked like he was about to explode. "No reason?! They're out of control Hermione. I'm not saying Remus isn't a decent bloke, I know he is, but he's got a condition! He can't always control himself and that's not prejudice that is a <em>fact. </em>Harry is human, he's not. They're different species," Hermione opened her mouth to say something, but Ron plowed on over her, "Remus is <em>20 years</em> older than Harry, he's one of Harry's father's oldest friends, our teacher <em>and </em>he's a dude and Harry fancies girls, right Harry?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry shrugged. "Don't really know."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron blinked at him. "Huh?" was his 'oh, so eloquent' response. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Well, I," Harry felt his cheek flush a little under the eyes of the Twins and Ron looking at him, Hermione simply looked a little bemused. "I may have, sort of, had a bit of a crush on him when he taught us in third year. Nothing major, just, you k-know." He felt his cheeks heat up even more as he started to stutter. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione nodded sympathetically, "Probably you were sensing your side of the bond."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry looked at her quizzically and she explained. "While the bond is strongest for Lupin, at least at this stage, you probably would feel at least some form of attraction to him. According to the Complete Werewolf Encyclopaedia by Miranda Goshawk if you were ever to, erm," she flushed slightly, "consummate the bond then it would effect you both equally. But since that's not likely to ever happen," she said in a rush, "then you don't need to worry about that." She looked at her hands fidgeting on her lap. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry cleared his throat, "Right. Ok, well since this doesn't really change anything right now and we've discussed everything that matters for tonight, how about we all head to bed? It's late and I could do with some rest." Ron nodded and everyone dispersed. Truthfully harry just wanted some alone time lying in bed that night to figure how he felt about all this, but he wasn't lying about being tired and his head had barely hit the pillow when he drifted off to sleep.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">Next morning at breakfast Ron and Hermione weren't talking to each other, Harry suspected they'd had another disagreement about Lupin, and after a few half hearted attempts to bridge the gap Harry gave up and ate his breakfast in silence thinking over what he'd discovered last night. </p><p class="p2">His feelings toward Lupin up until this point had been complicated, but honestly Harry hadn't really put much effort into trying to figure them out either. They were just there. But now he needed too. Ok to start off with, how did he feel about apparently being Lupin's One True Love?</p><p class="p2">Well, like Hermione said last night it didn't really change anything, at least, not right now. He wasn't ready for it. It might change something in the future when he felt he was ready and wasn't currently being distracted by Dark Lords trying to do him in every year. He was glad that Lupin cared about him and knew that he cared for the man too, in his own way. He had always looked up too and admired him, maybe bordering on hero worship when he was 13, but Remus was... complicated, how could he not be with his past? Harry simply felt he didn't know the man well enough to say he loved him or whether he could love him, but he knew Remus was a good, kind man and, for now, that was all he needed. He felt sorry for the man, waiting years to find his Mate only to find out it was some whom he could never, in all likelihood, be with. Still Harry couldn't comfort him, couldn't offer him false hope, when he honestly didn't know what he could offer, if anything. He was only 15, and while he had certainly had a crush on the guy Harry was still not really prepared for, all that side of things. He'd only just admitted to himself last night for the first time that he was bi, not because the though bothered him, but rather because he just hadn't really considered that matter before. It occurred to him then how much of normal teenage life he must be missing out on, how much more would he have thought about girls and dating if he hadn't spent most of last year figuring out how to fight dragons and survive underwater. He suddenly felt very sad and lonely for some reason. A part of him wanted Remus there, just to talk too, but he'd headed off to do some task or other late last night and hadn't gotten back yet. </p><p class="p2">Over the course of the next few days, things settled back into their normal routine at Grimmauld place, Hermione and Ron soon made up and went back to bickering over homework, while the twins continued to develop their various pranks complete with loud bands and explosions, mysterious smells and oddly flashing lights. Various Order members came and went and more than once Mrs. Weasly roped them into completing house chores around the mansion. </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">It was a few days before Harry began to wonder why Remus hadn't stopped by again. It wasn't unusual for him to be out on order business, but he was rarely gone so long and Harry wanted to talk to him. Not about the Mate thing, no Harry though he might just die of embarrassment if he tried, but he still wanted to speak to him. Harry felt he would be able to get a much better grasp of his feelings toward the man if he were around.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Remus still isn’t here?” Harry asked at breakfast that morning as they all sat down. Sirius frowned slightly, “No, I don’t know what’s happened to him. He just came into the kitchen late Saturday night and said something had come up and he had to go.” Sirius shrugged and turned to head back into the kitchen. bBehind his back Harry and Ron had seen the colour drain from Hermione’s face at his words and her hand raised half way to her mouth. As soon as he was out of the room Ron asked, “Hermione? What’s up?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She looked distressed, “Saturday night. That’s when we overheard them talking about Harry being Remus’ Mate.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So?” Harry asked, but a leaden feeling had begun to settle in the pit of his stomach. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So, they don’t know about the extendable ears, but I forgot Remus is a werewolf. He wouldn’t <em>need</em> extendable ears to be able to overhear us, ever from down here.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ron spoke up, “Are you saying he heard us discussing Harry being his Mate in our room?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione nodded and Harry felt a little queasy. He stood up startling both of the other two. “You know what I’m not feeling hungry anymore, I’ll see you both later.” And with that he all but fled out of the room. He headed up to the attic and Buckbeak, he needed sometime alone to think through things. It was just his luck that Remus should overhear and flee. Now he might never get to see the man he was slowly coming to accept he had feelings for ever again. </span>
