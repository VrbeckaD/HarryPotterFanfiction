    <p>Callie was woken from her lack luster sleep by the sound of her pig-of-a-cousin stomping down the stairs, and only moments later the banging of her aunt on the cupboard door. “Get up, girl! You have to make breakfast for my precious Dudders, he’s a growing boy after all. Now up!” Callie groaned, <em> growing boy my arse. That pig doesn’t need anymore food then he’s already getting. Still last thing I want is to get punished again </em></p><hr/><p>Since Mrs. Fig hadn’t been able to take her, she’d been dragged along by her relatives to the zoo. It wasn’t actually all that bad really, her aunt and uncle had been forced to buy her an ice lolly when they hadn’t been fast enough to leave before the man at the cart could ask her what she wanted; she’d even been given Dudley’s ice cream after he complained about it not having enough of the desert. But the best part of the day, in Callie’s opinion, was the reptile house; the snakes there had a lot more interesting things to say then the people that surrounded her.</p><p>Unfortunately good things rarely happen to her, and even more rare are the ones that last. Her pig cousin and his friend had seen her talking to the snakes and decided she had to, try to make her at least, have the reptiles do some sort of show for them. Well the bastards certainly got their ‘show’ and her scaly friends got their freedom, she hoped at least some of them wouldn’t get caught to. Still the masses didn’t appreciate them as much and there was a mad dash to the exits.</p><p>Getting back to number four, Callie did her best to keep her face neutral as her uncle beat her with his belt, no way was she going to let him get the reaction he wanted, before he threw her in her cupboard.</p><hr/><p>First opportunity to ditch the half giant, Callie took. She was going to explore this wizarding world on her own damn terms, but before she could do anything she’d need money; so to that Gringotts place first. Hagrid had said her parents had money, and since they were dead Callie could only reason that now that money was hers. <em> Excellent! Money means no more Dursley’s. </em></p><p>“Excuse me, Mr. Goblin sir. My names, Callie Lily Potter and I’d like to see my vaults please. Thank you.” It paid to be nice to those who handled your finances, and the fact that the goblin teller looked so surprised at her politeness only further cemented in her mind that wizards were really, really stupid.</p><p>“Key.”</p><p>“Err… I don’t have it, I think that half giant fellow-what was his name again… Oh! Right, Hagrid. I think he had it, but I ditched him when I got the chance.”</p><p>“Proof of identity.”</p><p><em> Reasonable. </em>Callie lifted her bangs to show the teller her scar, “will this do?”</p><p>The goblin gave a curt nod and she let her bangs fall back in place. “Follow me Miss Potter.”</p><hr/><p>Callie sat thinking, she didn’t like that this Dumbles-whatever-guy had been essentially stealing from <em> her </em> vaults. But when she thought about it, it seemed best to let him continue thinking he had everything all under control. She wasn’t going to back to her <em> relatives </em> though, not ever; and the only way to do that was to accept the titles thus emancipating herself the easy way. The nice goblin manager-Ragnok-even said there was a way to keep it quiet.</p><p>“Yes. I think that’s best, there’s no way in hell I’m gunna go back to the Dursleys...and I think it be better if only those strictly needed to be in the know, know.” Ragnok nodded accepting her reasoning, passing her the two lord rings and one heiress ring.</p><p> </p>
