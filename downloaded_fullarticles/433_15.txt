    <p>She was drunk. Stumbling through the hallway, she knew she should have regretted joining Luna and the other Ravenclaws in their celebration of Rowena's birthday. But since she had always felt like half a Ravenclaw, it had been only natural at the time. <em> She really should regret drinking so much Firewhisky. </em> But she didn't. Hermione giggled to herself, as she leaned on one of the empty suits of armour standing guard in the moonlit corridor. </p><p><em> Oooops! </em>The armour clanged as she lost her balance, falling backwards on her bum. It made her giggle even more.</p><p>"What have we here?" Professor Snape's dark eyes were suddenly looming over her, his hooked nose sniffing. "Have you been drinking, Granger? Not only that, curfew is long past. Twenty points from Gryffindor!"</p><p>Hermione could see, though, that his eyes were drawn to her legs, as her skirt had ridden up almost to her hip as she fell. Parting her legs a little more as she boldly met his gaze, she leaned back on her arms, thrusting out her chest. Licking her lips slowly, she could see Snape's Adams apple bobbing slightly.</p><p>Severus was shocked, but not entirely sure that he believed his eyes. <em> Didn't Granger wear underwear? </em> It was almost like he had seen a brief flash of a naked pussy when she parted her legs. His cock twitched a little, making him want to rearrange his clothing. <em> This was improper. After all, she was a student. </em></p><p>"I'm sorry, Professor. I lost track of time." The girl smirked drunkenly at him, and he narrowed his eyes. </p><p>"Who were you drinking with, Miss Granger?" he asked silkily.</p><p>Hermione furrowed her brows, her mind feeling fuzzy and sluggish. Not wanting to expose the Ravenclaws, she answered: "I can't tell you, Professor."</p><p>His eyes darkened, and he reached out a hand to help her up. "You'll be in detention with me until you tell me where this party is. Be prepared to work your intoxication off, Miss Granger."</p><p>Taking his hand, she rose quickly – too quickly – as the world spun around her. Stumbling, she fell into his chest, grabbing hold of his robe. Lifting her eyes to his face, she giggled again. <em> Oooops. He sure wasn't pleased. </em></p><p>Severus had to support her down the stairs, and she leaned heavily on him to avoid falling over again. Sighing, he put his arm around her waist, dragging her along. She was warm, and curiously light, and the feeling of her curved hips against his hands made his thoughts turn to… <em> NO, he wouldn’t think about that. Not with a student, no matter how inebriated he was himself. He should never have drunk that Firewhisky before going on patrol. Maybe this was stupid. Maybe he should deposit Granger at Gryffindor Tower instead. Though, letting her get away with insubordination wasn’t something he wanted to either.  </em></p><p>Well into his room in the dungeon, Hermione looked around with curiosity. She had never been inside Snape’s private rooms, nor had any other Gryffindor student that she was aware of. <em> Maybe he’d invite the Slytherins in, but certainly never a Gryffindor.  </em></p><p>There were books everywhere, and cupboards with neatly packaged Potion ingredients, phials and glasses with liquids and powdered substances. There were two large, leather chairs, a table, a desk with a chair and an open bottle of Firewhisky, with only a little left at the bottom. She sniggered, maybe the Professor had been drinking too before his patrol?</p><p>Running a hand through his greasy hair, he kept up his intimidating stare, making her squirm. "What to do with you, Miss Granger," he mused. "You're not in a state where I would let you near my ingredients. This is how it will be: You'll dust my bookshelves and sort the books in an alphabetical order."</p><p>"Ok!", she replied. Taking hold of her robe, she pulled it over her head.</p><p>"What are you doing, Granger?" <em> She could hear the worry in his voice, a faint tinge of panic too. </em></p><p>"Taking off my robe, sir. I don't want it to be dusty." As her robe landed on a chair, she saw him look at her with shock in his face. <em> Ooops. She had forgotten that she'd been playing strip poker with the Ravenclaws. </em> Her shirt, skirt and stockings were back on, but she couldn't find her underwear after the game. Her suspicion went to a burly, seventh year who had almost drooled as she took off her bra. <em> Maybe he stole her underwear to masturbate into it? </em></p><p>Now, Professor Snape was staring at her nipples. They stood out boldly and erect in the cold air in the dungeon, and the thin fabric of her shirt made her darker areolas show through. Her shirt was askew, she realized, with quite a few of the buttons open, showing a good amount of cleavage. </p><p>Peering at her Professor, she rather thought he was almost drooling too. <em> Naughty, </em> she laughed to herself, as she found it intensely amusing. <em> Had Professor Snape by the sight of her now fallen into his very own, little teacher-student fantasy? </em></p><p>Severus swallowed, feeling as if his throat was constricted. <em> Those nipples… </em> They were dark shadows against the fabric, jutting out, begging him to touch and lick them to sharp points. The buttons of her shirt were almost all open, baring her chest. Those full, perky breasts, <em> oh, how he'd love to squeeze them. </em> But <em> no</em>, she <em> was </em> his student. A very sexy one at that, one he wanted to bend over, fuck her into mindlessness. <em> No, STOP IT, </em>he told himself, swallowing again. Sitting heavily down in his chair, he felt slightly dizzy. </p><p>She put her hands to her hips, saying: "Where would you like me to start, Professor?"</p><p>He snapped his eyes up to her face, a spot of color blooming faintly on his sallow cheeks.</p><p>"You'll start over there with the top level. Take out the books, and afterwards you'll dust the shelf. You are not to use your wand, Granger."</p><p>"Ok." She sauntered up to one of the bookshelves, hips swaying as enticingly as she could manage. There was only a tiny bit of drunken wobbling, barely noticeably, and she congratulated herself for a walk well done. </p><p>Stretching up, standing on tip-toes, she realized that she wouldn't be able to reach the books.</p><p>"Um, Professor? If I'm not allowed to use magic, you'll have to help me. I can't get hold of the books."</p><p>He sighed, moving out of the chair towards her.</p><p>"See?" she said, stretching out her arms as far as she could, feeling her breasts being pushed upwards by the movement, and her arse pushed out and back towards him. </p><p>Severus swallowed one more time, before he took a step towards her. Standing almost directly behind her, his hand reached out, travelling up her arm, the brush against her feeling like a thousand tingles shooting straight to his cock, and he plucked down the first book, putting it in her hand. Granger bent down, setting it on the floor.</p><p>Hermione smiled a little wickedly for herself. <em> Oh, he wanted to touch her alright, or else he would have asked her to move over. </em></p><p>Twisting slightly to look at him, making sure he could get a good eyeful of her cleavage, she made her eyes big and innocent. "Thanks,  Professor. Will you help me with the rest of the books also?" </p><p>He nodded, black eyes locked on her chest. </p><p>They moved along the shelf, taking out book after book from the top shelf, repeating the performance. Each time, his arm brushed the side of her breast, and Hermione moved a little closer to him, until her arse finally was pressed against his front. <em> Oh, he had his fantasy going, alright. </em> His cock was hard, bigger than she would have thought, poking her through his clothes. She almost wanted to giggle again, turning on Snape had never been in her wildest dreams. <em> But, tonight she was in a wicked mood. </em> As he put the next book into her hand, she bent down with her legs straight, grinding her arse into his erection. A groan emerged from him, and he gripped her hips.</p><p>The tempting little minx rose slowly, still pressing herself against his body, and Severus couldn’t help it, his inhibitions apparently long gone with the Firewhisky. Though his mind tried to warn him against it, his hands moved of their own volition, travelling up, grasping her tits, massaging those pert nipples. She moaned, leaning her head back into him. One of his hands moved down to her skirt, disappearing underneath to the inside of her thighs. As he reached the apex, he gasped.</p><p>"Granger, I never knew you were so … forward," he grunted as his fingers found her bare mound. "How come you don't wear underwear at all?"</p><p>She sighed, parting her legs for him, letting his fingers pass through her folds.</p><p>"And you're so slick and wet for me," he continued, feeling both amazement and an intense arousal, as his fingers working her little nub. "All these years you've been in my classroom, and I never knew you were such a little siren underneath your robes." His other hand continued to stroke her nipple, and she gasped as he inserted a finger into her cunt.</p><p>"So wet, and so tight. Do you enjoy being fucked ... hard, Miss Granger?" Severus fervently hoped so, because all he could think of, was to bury his cock into that tight wetness. </p><p>Snape's voice were silky and dangerous as usual, and his finger was now pumping her, while the others still played with her clit. Hermione felt her belly clench hard at his words. </p><p>"I don't know," she gasped. "I'm a virgin. Maybe you'll <em> teach </em> me how?" Her emphasis on <em> teach </em> wasn't lost on him, and she could see his eyes dilate, like she had given him a present. <em> Something he wanted very much.  </em></p><p>Steering her towards his desk, he bent her over, positioning himself behind her, pulling up her skirt. Hermioen leaned forward on her arms, strutting her arse out to him, making him groan.</p><p>"You're a very naughty girl, Miss Granger, and I will teach you a lesson,” Professors Snape purred in her ear, his breath a hot tickle against her sensitive earlobe. “We'll see if you can make yourself earn the points you lost this evening. Would you like that, Miss Granger? Working off your loss of points? To pay for your … sins?"</p><p>"Yes, please, Professor. Please!" she whispered throatily, as a strong tremor shot straight to her sex. <em> Surprisingly, it turned her on, this imbalance in power. He, a teacher, and she, a student. It was all wrong, but right now, oh so sexy - so… right.  </em></p><p>He fumbled with his clothes, and then she could feel it, a thick, silky cock positioned just at her entrance. She shivered a little in anticipation, as he slowly pushed his member into her.</p><p><em> Strangely, it hurt a little, even through her drunken haze. </em>"Please, Professor, it hurts, I can’t take it," she whined, but he continued to press himself into her, filling her up, before with a quick thrust he buried himself to the hilt in her. </p><p>Severus growled, with a death-grip on her hips, and she gasped and shook around him. "You're so big, it hurts, please be careful," she moaned. <em> He couldn’t help it. He knew he was big, but to hear it from a witch stretched around his cock was always flattering, making him proud.  </em></p><p>He reached down, rubbing her little nub again, as he slowly slid himself out. Withdrawing almost to the tip, he thrust in again, making her whimper a little. </p><p>It was still too much, but it was starting to feel good too, her pleasure rapidly rising again. Hermione moaned as he rubbed her more firmly. As he sped up his tempo, the thrusts came faster, and she felt herself move against his hips, to get more of him, to get that delicious feeling of being stuffed full of her teacher's cock. </p><p>Severus grunted: "You're… so… tight… Granger," almost forcing the words out. His movements became harder, and he was ramming his cock into her pussy, still stroking her clit. <em> It felt so heavenly. Her wet slickness fitted so tight around him, squeezing the tip of his cock. He wouldn't last long, even though he was nineteen years her senior. </em> He <em> should </em> be experienced enough to make it last for as long as he wanted to, but that felt like an impossible goal. Severus was holding on to a thread, his orgasm only a few thrusts away, like he was a randy teenager with no stamina. <em> Oh, fuck, </em> he thought, <em> it wasn't like he usually had the chance to bend such a sexy young witch over the table pushing his cock into her. </em></p><p>Hermione felt the build-up of her own orgasm, her clit hard against the strokes of his clever fingers, moaning more and more audibly, until she came undone, clenching around him, milking his cock. As her final gasp gave way for her peak, she felt Snape's cock twitch inside her, and he slammed himself into her with a series of erratic thrusts. As he came deep inside her, burying himself into her pussy, flooding her with his seed, he roared: "Twenty points to Gryffindor!"</p><p> </p><p> </p>
