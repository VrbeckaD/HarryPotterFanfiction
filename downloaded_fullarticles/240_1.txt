    <p>Persephone Potter had never imagined water could be so blue. Persephone Potter’s imagination couldn’t come up with all the things that had occurred this summer, but the water in the Mediterranean being so blue was the strangest thing that had occurred.</p><p>Put in chronological order, the first strange thing that had happened was that her mother’s friend from Hogwarts was her neighbor under the name of Johnson. She explained it was the most generic, normal sounding name she and her husband could come up with. Her husband, Reginald Cuttermole, was an employee of the Ministry of Magic in the Magical Maintenance Department, a department that took care of maintaining the upkeep of the ministry. He told her that people would tell her that it was an unimportant division but really, they are the back bone of the Ministry.</p><p>After the utter shock of the American family being wizards, they had somehow talked the Dursleys in to drive her to a little restaurant as a celebration of the kids being back.</p><p>“I assume you have a lot of questions,” Mary said when Diana finished her first ramble of her classes. Her father made her stop talking to start her meal, which probably got cold. Persephone listened, eating her linguini silently. She shrugged.</p><p>“I’m…surprised.” She said after swallowing. The meals at Hogwarts were scheduled by the Head Girl and Boy and they hadn’t put too many pasta days down. She’d forgotten how good pasta was. “Also kind of mad Nico didn’t tell me.” She stared pointedly at him from across the table as he read the side menu awkwardly. She kicked him and he looked up at her, startled.</p><p>“Sorry what?” He asked. She rolled her eyes.</p><p>Diana snorted, “Not overly indulgent? I am surprised,” She smirked when Nico scolded her and then she winked at Persephone, who bit back her smile, nearly choking on her pasta. “Anyway, you’re coming to Italy with us, yes?”</p><p>“I’m…really grateful for the offer, but I don’t think my aunt and uncle would approve…besides, I think they need me at home for the summer,” She said, looking down at her plate, feeling that terrible feeling she always had when she was a child and wasn’t allowed doing things because of her uncle and aunt’s rules.</p><p>Mary placed a hand by her plate, “Well, I don’t believe you aunt and uncle would disapprove, not after I had a chat with them,” She smiled, but there was something sinister about her words. “And reminded them how very educational it could be for you…” Persephone thought she probably definitely did not use those words, “And after some consideration, they’ve decided to allow you to come.”</p><p>Persephone’s mouth dropped open, “But…they won’t possible pay and I don’t want you to either!”</p><p>“Well, of course they won’t be, and neither will you,” She smiled almost knowingly. “Persephone, darling, are you aware of a weekly to monthly allowance your aunt and uncle receive for taking…care of you throughout your life?” Persephone shook her head. “Well, they receive a certain amount of money each week to be able to foster you. The day you left for Hogwarts, I made it a point to remind them that they will not be fostering you for nine months of the year and…convinced them to allow me to set up a bank account for you to put the money they receive for you.”</p><p>Persephone stared blankly at her, wondering what she was trying to say…Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were paid to keep her? Well this made a lot more sense.</p><p>“How…how much do they get paid?” She asked.</p><p>Nico was the one to answer, “Four-fifty a week,” He said absently. She moved her stare to Nico. He met her stare and looked away.</p><p>“The money is sitting under your name, and mine as a safety, and I’ve been making sure they put the money every week into the bank over the forty-two weeks you’ve been gone from under their roof.” Mary said. She was so shocked at this news that she wasn’t able to calculate how much money was in a bank with her name on it—she was more shocked that she was worth four hundred and fifty a week.</p><p>She must have been staring at her pasta for a long moment because Diana bumped her shoulder, “Do you want your bread?”</p><p>It was impossible to move on from such a subject and yet, they did. Diana was retelling a story about Hogwarts, which led to Persephone asking what house she’d been in and Diana telling her she was a Slytherin. That led to a long series of questions from Persephone to describe the common room in great detail. Despite seeing the common room, she was still fascinated.</p><p>That was the first unbelievable thing that had happened that summer. It led to Mary walking her through the workings of a bank, which were much more complex than the wizarding banks. She walked her through how to withdraw, and how to make cards and handle such things. She had to explain several different times but Persephone thought she got it by the fourth time.</p><p>The second unbelievable thing that had happened that summer was that she was <em>actually</em> going to Italy. She had went to the Dursley’s for the day, with Diana and Nico. It was strange having either of them in her bedroom, when it looked nothing like her dorm. She still had floral beddings and lace curtains with a vase of fresh flowers. She was half-expecting Nico to comment on how feminine it was, as all boys do, but he remained quiet, standing by the door and petting Salem. Diana and Persephone went through her things, picking out what fit and what no longer did.</p><p>Over the course of the school year, Persephone’s skinny, small body had grown. She’d gained weight during her time at Hogwarts and it was only now that she realized she looked almost normal. With her history of ballet training, she’d always been showing the curve of her hips and the toned contour of her legs. Now, she could no longer count her ribs and she found her shirts began to feel slightly snug around her…chest.</p><p>Diana was recounting tales on her sisters as they unfolded and re-folded. “…and despite the fact that I literally don’t know her, she acts like I killed that stupid, yapping dog of hers—which, I have thought about, being as it’s the most annoying thing, <em>ever</em>.” She groaned. “And god, I think she’s gotten all her petty little friends to nag and bitch about me as if, again, I did something when I haven’t had more than like three conversations with her.”</p><p>Persephone was exhausted by the day, not physically but mentally. Despite everything that had happened, her mind was still reeling with information—Nico’s foster parents were her neighbors. Did this mean he would be living with them? Was this the emergency that had occurred last summer? She was full of questions.</p><p>“But Gabrielle! Oh, I adore her,” Diana smiled, “She’s such a sweet girl, and wrote me such a nice letter before school starter, about how she couldn’t wait to meet me and hug me, I swear, Percy, there’s never been such a cute little girl!”</p><p>She realized she’d been staring at Nico when he suddenly caught her gaze. She looked away, “How are the dorms set up?”</p><p>It was too easy to let Diana gush about Beauxbatons, and it was even easier to listen to her. Despite her accent, she spoke with such an exquisite tone of voice that anyone could fall in love with her by listening to her speak. It was too easy to be lost in her stories.</p><p>“Holy shit,” Nico suddenly said, snapping his head to Diana. “Give me your phone!”</p><p>“Why?” Diana asked, startled.</p><p>Nico, waving his hands, looked panicked, “Hurry!”</p><p>Diana handed him her phone and he frantically typed something in. Diana and Persephone stared at each other with questioning eyes, before he groaned, “Nooooo!” He looked up and looked at Persephone. “Percy Jackson isn’t playing anymore in London!”</p><p>Her mind blanked and she scrambled to grab her laptop. Diana watched the two panic, not understanding their obsession of the book series movie adaptation. Persephone scanned the internet but found no illegal uploads of the movie.</p><p>“Since when is the government efficient?” Nico snapped when they scoured the internet for a good twenty minutes.</p><p>Diana was lying on Persephone’s bed, sighing dramatically, “Are you done yet? I’m bored out of my mind.”</p><p>“Wait, check Italian movie theatres,” Nico suggested loudly.</p><p>So a trip to Italy became much more realistic when the three decided to find a theatre that played the Percy Jackson movie. The thought of having a fun summer was completely out of the norm for Persephone.</p><p>The plan was to stay in Venice for three days, three days in Bologna, five days in Florence and a week in Rome. It was a relatively short trip, not meant to carry out for too long. Nonetheless, Diana packed as though it were a summer long trip. Diana requested her opinion on dresses that she tried on and turned for different angles while Persephone sat on the floor, sipping water, giving thoughtful opinions on each dress.</p><p>“So—after Italy what are you doing?” Diana asked as she dropped the dress to her feet and stepped out of it.</p><p>Persephone politely avoided looking, “Ballet program so I’ll be staying with a friend.”</p><p>“Hm, Charlie’s brother?” She asked.</p><p>“Cedric Diggory.”</p><p>“Never heard of him,” She did her hair up. “Do you want to be a ballerina when you grow up?”</p><p>Persephone leaned against the wall, surveying the dress she was buttoning up. Diana was a master at buttoning and zipping up dresses from the back. “I have no idea what I want to do anymore! For a while I wanted to be an engineer—now I want to be a potioneer. I never seriously considered being a professional ballerina.”</p><p>“You would be a very nice ballerina,” She commented. “Hm—I think I’d like to be a fashion designer—oh, have I shown you the uniform at Beauxbatons? It’s so pretty and made out of silk!” Persephone did not blame Nico for excusing himself—Diana was overwhelmingly passionate about a dizzying amount of things that it was almost hard to keep up.</p><p>“I am happy you have become friends with Nicolas,” Diana said randomly while trying on the fourteenth dress.</p><p>Persephone looked at her in surprise before blushing, “Well…I am happy too…even if he is annoying.” She didn’t really think they were friends but she wasn’t about to say that out loud.</p><p>“All boys are,” Diana smiled to her through the mirror, “But he seems more open now. He was very closed off and—”</p><p>“Moody?”</p><p>Diana laughed, “Shy, but now he is much more…how you say? Friendly.”</p><p> </p><p>Italy was exquisite. Despite only staying a few days in each city, Persephone soaked everything up. The first night, they’d gotten in so late and the jet lag hadn’t hit just yet so they got this huge cheese pizza—which, by gods, was fantastic. They didn’t sleep so when the sun rose, they were up a good seventeen hours already. Mary made the three of them wear charms that allowed for the adults to locate the three of them, with an added category of intense protection spells. Then they allowed them to walk to their first sight while Mary and her husband went off for their business.</p><p>Persephone was surprised with how much trust Diana’s parents had in the three of them, but Diana wasn’t bothered. She led the way, flipping her hair at the people who stared at her in admiration. The Italian sun did wonders for her and people stopped to cast her a second glance. Nico and Persephone followed. Nico was enamored with his camera, taking pictures every few minutes, one of which Persephone posed for with a smile, the rest she was in she was sure she had no idea were being taken.</p><p>They visited the Academia first. The paintings of Veronese seemed to capture Persephone’s full and undivided attention and Nico had to repeat several questions—it seemed she was acting translator for the three of them, despite Diana’s study of the Italian language. It was only when Diana announced that she was hungry that Persephone had to allow herself to be dragged away.</p><p>Apparently it was much too early for any lunch venues so they hunted down some cafes, for brioches and fruit of the season. Next, they visited a bookstore, Acqua Alta—</p><p>“High water,” Persephone explained to Nico. “Like during the tide season.”</p><p>“Of course you know,” Nico snorted, “Percy,” He said in a mocking tone and she rolled her eyes.</p><p>The books in the store were stocked high up in bathtubs and even gondolas. It was very common to find a cat wandering the store that a lot of pictures from the album that would eventually come out of the trip were of the girls petting a cat. Persephone bought herself a beautiful copy of Dante’s <em>Divinia Comedia.</em></p><p>Unfortunately, they weren’t able to visit that many cathedrals but they were able to get some gelato before heading back to meeting Reginald and Mary. They planned a more together trip to visit the magical communities of Venice for the next day and finally the jet lag caught up with them.</p><p>“Apparently, in A.D 79, the Ancient Roman warlock, Zaccaria Innocenti cast the Dancing Feet Spell on Mount Vesuvius, triggering its eruption and destroying the Roman cities of Pompei and Herculaneum, killing at least 1500 people,” Nico read from the pamphlet they picked up from the entrance. It was a rather small community, tinier than Diagon Alley. They were only passing through but it was still much more comforting to see people using magic.</p><p>All over, the trip was filled with very non-magic things with a sprinkle of magic here and there but it was only after a three hour train ride to Turin on the third day early in the morning that Persephone was fully indulged in the magical roots of Italy.</p><p>There was a magical school in Turin, named <em>Istituto dei Maghi di Giubiana, </em>Giubiana’s Wizard’s Institution. A magical train dropped them off near the gardens and while Mary and Reginald went up to speak with a tall, serious looking man, a girl, about Diana’s age, greeted them each with a kiss on the cheek, speaking in broken English, telling them her name was Evangeline and she would be taking them on a tour.</p><p>She explained that the school prided itself on the academic excellence, as it offered summer programs for those who were able to attend to them. They passed what could only be students, dressed in savoy blue robes with a golden bull clasp. Evangeline told them that the bull was the emblem of the city of Turin, as it appeared on both uniform and school crest. The blue was the color of the Royal House of Savoy that once ruled over Italy before it became a republic. She cheerfully added that this was why the national football team had blue uniforms despite the red, white and green flag.</p><p>The school was a single, sprawling building with carefully manicured grounds, modelled not after the main residences of the royal family but a hunting reservation, expanded in manners to allow for somewhat permanent residencies of the students. Their motto was written on the main hall’s wall, Alacriter Arcana Discimus: "We learn secrets with alacrity".</p><p>Evangeline described, half in Italian and half in English, that the school is name after a witch-like figure that appeared in northern Italian Non-Magical folklore. She told them that the non-magical people’s tradition was to burn a ‘giubiana’ on the last Thursday of January, as they saw the figure as scary and negative and the burning was meant to be symbolical. The naming of the school was done with purpose to reclaim the name and proudly reaffirm with a head held high that, “<em>yes this is what we are, no matter how much you try to malign and repress us”.</em></p><p>Nico and Persephone shared a look but Diana had a gleaming look in her eye as she eyed Evangeline.</p><p>The location wasn’t random either. Esoteric traditions say that certain cities in the world form triangles, one for dark magic and one for light and Turin is the only place in the world to be part of both, along with London and San Francisco for the former, and Prague and Lyon for the latter.</p><p>It seemed like any other school—or at least, it seemed very much like Hogwarts. They played Quidditch in the expanding land and they had school tournaments. However, they did not have houses, so it was hard for Persephone to understand how they played against each other.</p><p>When they met with Mary and Reginald again, Persephone noticed Evangeline pass Diana a note. Persephone raised a brow and Diana smiled coyly.</p><p>When they arrived back to their little house in Venice some hours later, it was dinner time. Nico whispered into her ear, “Wait here.” He disappeared into the house and she grimaced after him—why was he so ominous? He was so dramatic.</p><p>When he returned, he gestured for her to follow him, “We’re going to the beach.”</p><p>She groaned, “I’m so hungry though!”</p><p>He cast her a side-glance, “Well, the moon will be out in a few hours so…”</p><p>She blinked, “We’re doing that <em>now</em>?”</p><p>Persephone was not like other witches—she carried a gene, a special gene passed from mother to child. Persephone was a siren—she didn’t have a tail or gills but apparently, at some point in her family tree, one of the women were born of the sea. Somehow, it was passed to her and she had some very…mermaid like traits. A beautiful, hypnotizing voice, a pretty face, an affinity towards the water…it was all very confusing and would be very cool for Persephone should the full moon not cause her so much pain every month. Much like a werewolf.</p><p>Nico was, well, she wasn’t exactly sure what he was. He wouldn’t admit to being a werewolf, which was irritating because he obviously was one. He had figured her out last year when he used one of her hairs as a wand core and made a fully functioning wand out of it. Long story. Other than her and the Weasley twins, she was sure he had no other friends, isolating himself very successfully from most of the Hogwarts population. He kept a lot of secrets but she thought she trusted him—she would trust him more if he didn’t always take her off into dangerous situations—the Forbidden Forest in the night, was one.</p><p>He was annoyingly ominous, somehow always able to omit very important information from her. It was a gift—like he only spoke of the Alchemy studies done at the school they had visited. She thought maybe he didn’t trust her as much as he should—they did go through several painful full moons together, after all.</p><p>“So,” She said following after him, “You’re being really quiet. On the night of a full moon.”</p><p>He raised a brow at her, glancing back at her with his amazing eyes. “Would you rather I tell you all about my thoughts and feelings?”</p><p>She shrugged, “Wouldn’t hurt.”</p><p>“Right,” He said. When the grass turned to sand, she pulled her small heeled shoes off, feeling a lure from the water some ways beyond them. “While we’re here, we should get some extra water—” She didn’t hear the rest as she had darted forward, at some point dropping her bag and shoes on the sand in the process. “And there she goes.” She heard faintly in an exasperated voice.</p><p>She felt a sudden satisfaction when she reached the water, feeling as though a layer of her skin fell off. She was ready to dive in when someone looped their hand around her arm, holding back. She hissed back at him and then covered her mouth, “Sorry!”</p><p>“Good to see you’re still in control,” Nico commented, raising his brow. “Wouldn’t wanna wet your pretty dress,” He said, pulling her slightly towards him. He kept his hold on her wrist, as if to make sure she didn’t swim away, which was probably really smart while he dug in his bag. He pulled out his wand and Persephone’s eyes widened.</p><p>“We’re not allowed to use magic out of school!” She hissed at him. “We’ll get in trouble!”</p><p>He looked at her in amusement, “Okay Seph.” He pointed his wand and without speaking an incantation, sent a light volt of red to the ground. Where it met the sand, it flamed hot and smoke floated away before revealing a jar. “Here. Fill it with water.”</p><p>He handed her the jar and she raised a brow, “Why?”</p><p>He looked at her with impatience, “The jar is made from Mediterranean sand so once you fill it with ocean water, it will refill itself with the same water each time—which is Mediterranean water—”</p><p>“Okay, got it,” She rolled her eyes, leaning down to fill it with water. His hold on her wrist slid from her wrist to her hand until he was holding her fingers. His hand tightened. “I’m not going to swim away.” She told him.</p><p>“Your hair’s white,” He said. He was right. Her hair was falling over her shoulder and it was no longer curly and auburn red but slick, straight and very blonde white. She said nothing and kept filling the jar. When it was filled to the rim, she handed it back. “So from what I read, this is good for eyes and skin—”</p><p>“Skin?”</p><p>He tightened the jar lid, “Your skin will be really dry to the point of peeling off layers of skin, inflammation and shitty rashes—” She gasped, “So like, make a moisturizer out of this will you?”</p><p>“Right,” She grimaced. She felt more in control than any other full moon. She thought it had to do with his hand tightened around hers. However she still pulled him towards the water, trying to dive in but only successfully falling into the water face first, still having his hand in hers. He pulled her up by hand easily, almost lifting her above and out of the water.</p><p>She coughed, embarrassed.</p><p>“So…so am I going to…?”</p><p>“Become a fish?” She frowned at the wording. “No, you’re half human.”</p><p>“So…?”</p><p>“So only by choice.” He told her.</p><p>“Only…by choice…?”</p><p>“Probably.”</p><p>“PROBABLY!?” She screeched. He winced, staring at her in annoyance. “That’s—”</p><p>“As much as I know, sorry,” He said, staring at her. Annoyance overcame her and a feral instinct moved her to twist his hand, which was still in hers, to pull him close where she lifted her leg up and around his neck, pulling him down into the water. She pushed his head down for half a second until he overpowered her by raising them both up out of the water, her on his back. Before she could try again, he had already rushed them away from the shore and onto the grass.</p><p>She blinked as he flipped her, holding her instead up in his arms. He stared down at her, cocking a brow, “Feel better?”</p><p>She crossed her arms, “Whoops?”</p><p>“Right,” He set her down and she grimaced down at her attire. Covered in sea water and sand, her eyes were burning with tears. “We should head back now.”</p><p>“Could we—”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“I won’t—”</p><p>“Yes, you will try to drown me again, we both are very well aware that you will try and drown me if we go back so we are not going back.” He crossed his arms and stared at her as if daring her to try to go back to the ocean. She knew he would either carry her back or drag her so she let him lead.</p><p>“Right, well,” She huffed, turning away to stare at the sea. “I don’t think my wanting to drown you has anything to do with the full moon.”</p><p>She shifted her weight onto her other foot and it was too late to realize her legs were suddenly inadequate in supporting her full weight. She heard the crack before she fully registered it and she fell to the ground, gasping in pain.</p><p>“Jesus what—”</p><p>She screamed, a long scream as she felt a tearing in her legs. Blinding, white pain shot up her legs and her bones started breaking. She reached for her legs, scratching at them, needing the skin off her. She screamed, gasping as the skin peeled off and she felt herself break.</p><p>She felt herself being picked up and then the splash of water made her snap, and she kicked away from the person near her, clawing her way under the waves. She felt a sting by her hair roots and cried out as her white and silvery hair reacted to the water. She struggled, her body on fire and her legs heavier and heavier—there was no resisting the change when she felt the pins and needles in her mouth, as though her DNA was changing as the seconds went by.</p><p>She screamed into the water, struggling. She felt her bones break, her spine snap all the way up and she couldn’t control her screams anymore. Her legs were no longer legs—they broke and fused together.</p><p>She was crying and in pain and it hurt—it hurt how she came to be, but when she looked up, she could see. Her eyes, made for the water, were able to see everything clearly—tears flooded her eyes at the moment, but beyond that, beyond the water, the full moon was clear.</p><p>Hades stood in ankle deep water, staring off as she disappeared. He was gasping, unable to keep himself from feeling the fear he did. He’d asked Diana to cover for them, without giving a proper reason as to why, but now? Would Persephone come back?</p><p>He couldn’t stop to think of this answer, for his own change had just begun.</p><p>                                         ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Persephone was sore. Neither she nor Nico spoke the next day, much too tired to say anything useful. She kept taking showers, unable to keep herself cool enough. Walking was worse and she couldn’t keep herself from downing water bottles by the litre.</p><p>After Venice, they travelled down to Bologna. Despite being…changed, it was enjoyable all the same. They had hit Bologna right in the middle of a film festival, where there were nightly free movies. The three—Diana, Persephone and Hades—settled in near the cathedral steps to watch and while Nico couldn’t understand much, it was beautiful. She looked around—she could understand everyone’s conversations, despite their accents. And it wasn’t just Italian—it was German, Portuguese, Greek…it was good to know why she was so good with languages. She just hoped she wouldn’t soon be able to understand fishes.</p><p>An old couple passed them a smiled, commenting in Italian, “Una bellissima coppia! Giovane amore!”</p><p>Narrowing her eyes, Persephone leaned away from Nico and ignored Diana’s snickering and Nico’s asking what they said. She told him they were speaking to themselves. She wasn’t sure he believed her. She tried her best to ignore the proximity by people watching—no one was on any cell phone and there was a sense of community—but to no avail.</p><p>They visited the Fontana del Nettuno in the Piazza del Nettuno, the incomplete Basilica di San Petronio church, and they stopped by the quadrilatero. It was…haunting, to step into the enclave. She could feel the medieval past, as some parts were still their authentic selves. It was a beautiful pathway of narrow paths between close buildings with cobblestone floors. They passed many markets, some butches, delis, fish markets, bakeries, high end apparel stores. Her favorite was when they passed slowly by a jewelers store, where many pretty necklaces were on show. The man working there called to them, “Belle signore!”</p><p>They stopped, smiling sheepishly, and the man offered a necklace, “Bella collana per belle donne, eh!” At this, he reached back to clasp a necklace around Diana’s neck, smiling as he did. It was a sweet and genuine sentiment. Diana was beaming the whole next twenty minutes and Nico nudged her, earning him a slap on the arm.</p><p>It wasn’t just Diana getting loads of attention from admirers. It seemed that the full moon had different effects on Persephone. She was getting attention too, though she knew she didn’t look different. A florist gave her a bouquet of flowers for free, which was very nice, until he offered her the entire store. She raised a brow.</p><p>“Perhaps you are part veela,” Diana said, linking their arms.</p><p>“Veela?” Persephone questioned.</p><p>“Veela. Native to Bulgaria. They are semi-human people, usually women with very white-gold hair and skin like the moon. They aren’t fully human, though, they have bird heads with a long beak and have long wings from their shoulders, when angry.” She told her casually. “They dance and hypnotize anyone who love women.”</p><p>“O—oh…” Persephone blushed deeply. “How?”</p><p>“They have their own type of magic, I think.” She said. “They can even launch fire balls from their hands. I haven’t been able to do that just yet, not right anyway.”</p><p>“Wait, what?” Persephone stopped. “Are you…”</p><p>Diana giggled, “Of course! I am beautiful, no?”</p><p>Persephone sputtered, “But your hair…”</p><p>“I am half-spanish.”</p><p>“Like me?” She said out dumbly.</p><p>Diana nodded, “Maybe you are part veela…or maybe siren? Siren and veela are very closely related—you know the earliest sirens had bird body instead of fish?”</p><p>“HAhahaha!” She laughed hysterically, “Right…”</p><p>“Well, if you were a siren, I would know. I am only a fourth veela but sirens and veela imprint on each other.”</p><p>“Ah, veelas and sirens share a lot of traits—being short tempered is one,” Nico offered cheerfully and earned two smacks. “Jeez!”</p><p>And so the plot thickens.</p><p>“So…does your sister not like you…because…?”</p><p>“Well, yes, because I am also veela, but more because I am more beautiful than her,” She said, shrugging. “She may be a little racist too—I mean, I am more beautiful than her veela and I had dark characteristics, no?”</p><p>“Huh.”</p><p>“If I were your type of Spanish, maybe she might like me more…”</p><p>Persephone raised a brow, “My type?”</p><p>“If I were pale Spanish…” She sighed almost miserably. “I do not mean you are less Spanish, I just mean people are more nicer to people who look like you, who talk like you.” She smiled sheepishly at Persephone, “I am a little jealous but I hope I do not offend you?”</p><p>“No, no I think I understand…” Persephone frowned to herself. She thought about this for a long time.</p><p>She was a metamorphmagus, she can change the way she looks but she liked the way she looked. Did she like the way she looked because everyone around her was pleased with how she looked? Pale skin, light eyes? Would she be miserable if she did look more like her father did, with his olive skin, dark eyes and hair? Would she not be pretty? Is that how girls like Hermione, Lavender, Parvati and Diana always felt? Persephone felt sick to her stomach.</p><p>After Bologna, they spent five days in Florence, where they visited the Duomo di Firenze, quickly becoming tired from the four hundred six-three steps in time spaces. They reached the lantern at the very top of the structure, which was apparently the highest point in central Florence. They visited the Uffizi, where Persephone nearly cried at seeing Botticelli’s finest pieces with her actual eyes. It wasn’t just the gallery which amazed her but the venue itself. It was architecturally fascinating, having been built in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, designed by Giorgio Vasari. She spent a good portion of the three hours they spent there being lost at how breathtaking it all was.</p><p>Afterwards, they visited the galleria dell’Accademia. It was to Nico’s great pleasure that they were allowed to take pictures and now she had a picture of her standing next to David, something that a 26-year-old Michelangelo had carved out of a single block of marble 500 years ago. It was absolutely beautiful…</p><p>They bought some fresh food from the Mercato Centrale before travelling to the Giardino Bardini. The beautiful purple wisteria arch was in full bloom. Nico was the one who ventured farther away, for pictures. She was craning her neck at a painful angle but it was worth it. They climbed the beautiful staircase and took in the view over the city.</p><p>They took a stop the next day at the Caffe Gilli for pastries and to satisfy Diana’s apparent addiction to caffeine. They took a bus to Fiesole where they found themselves at the hilltop town that overlooks the valley of Florence. Granted, they took the wrong bus but still ended up in a beautiful place. They toured a roman theater, the San Francesco convent and then was dragged out to the hiking trails by Nico, who was going on about how amazing and incredible it was that they were standing where Da Vinci had first tried out his flying machines.</p><p>They visited the Arno River, that she stayed a good measure away from, just in case. Their final three stops were to the Vivoli Gelato for some gelato, then to the leather shops, where Nico tried out a gorgeous black leather jacket. Persephone grabbed it and another jacket of the same style but in a coffee color and gave Diana the money to pay for it. Birthday present was in check. If he were to ever tell her when his birthday was—maybe Christmas was better.</p><p>The final place they visited was the Biblioteca delle Oblate. With live music and a book in hand, it was the best thing to do on their final day in Florence.</p><p>The last week of their trip was to be in Rome. Persephone was ever so excited for it. They visited the Piazza Navona, where they saw the Fountain of Four rivers. They visited the iconic Colosseum. It lived up to the hype of its name—the largest amphitheatre ever built, with the capacity to hold 50 000 to 80 000 people, she was not disappointed.</p><p>They strolled about the Roman Forum and the Palatine Hill and she almost felt bad for Nico having to listen to her Roman mythology lessons. Truly all of their trip was her giving lessons on the roman myths but the only time she was able to really just not contain herself was when they visited the Pantheon.</p><p>She sat by the Trevi Fountain, again with gelato, wondering how much trouble she’d get in for swimming in the fountain. Shouldn’t sirens get privileges? They walked along the Tiber, and she was overwhelmed with emotion at knowing she was at the place where Remus and Romulus were once said to have been. Nico had annoyingly gotten several pictures of her crying by the river and she wouldn’t speak to him for an hour. They wandered the narrow streets of Trastever, on the west bank of the Tiber River.</p><p>And then, much to her surprise, they visited another magical school.</p><p>The Rhea Silvia Imperial Academy of Sorcery was a beautiful school, with a dedicated section of the catacombs, well protected from tourists of non-magical people with repelling charms. The school was named well, being as Rhea Silvia was the mother of Romulus and Remus. It was <em>entirely underground.</em> It was an incredible sight.</p><p>They taught Latin here, something Persephone was well jealous of. Their motto was Nobis a Maioribus, roughly translated to “From Our Ancestors to Us”, which Persephone thought was well put. Their entire theme was based of Roman mythology. The school color was red, and their uniform was white mostly, with some red accents, secured at the shoulder and resembling a toga rather than a wizard’s classic robes. Persephone was astonished.</p><p>When the end of the trip came, she was very sad to leave. She wouldn’t forget, of course, and the things she’d seen would remain with her forever, she thought—another thing stuck with her. She had to go back to the Durlseys.</p><p>And that was when everything seemed to go wrong.</p><p>She’d come home, half-expecting Salem, her cat, to be killed or worse—sat on by Dudley. She’d left her cat with a neighbor, Mrs. Figg’s, and found he was okay. That was good. Hedwig, too, was alright. She’d paid a pet carrier service to take care of her and she’d been magically transported back to her cage the morning she’d come back.</p><p>She was sure none of the Dursleys were up yet. She stuck her hand through the mail slot and extended her hand to reach the lock. Unlocking the door, she very slowly opened the door and stepped across the threshold.  Quickly and silently, she closed the door behind them and took her suitcase and her book bag over her should and running up the stairs.</p><p>Nothing had changed. She had the same lace curtains, flower bedding and white vase on her dresser. She shut the door, and found Hedwig in her cage. She unpacked some of her clothes, some books and her journal as well, trying her best not to make amess. In a few days she’d be gone to Cedric Diggory’s for the dance program anyway. She clasped the suitcase shut and accidently knocked it over, making a large bang. This didn’t disturb the Durlseys, who were still sleeping, but it did disturb Hedwig.</p><p>She squawked awake and then saw Persephone and started squeaking excitedly. She ran across the room, trying to hush the bird but it was too late. She heard a grunt in the next room and then a shift in the floorboards—someone was awake.</p><p>A few seconds later, the door was thrown open. “Girl!” He shouted. Behind him, Aunt Petunia peered over his shoulder.</p><p>Oh, she did not miss her uncle. He hadn’t changed, at all.</p><p>As surprising as it was, Persephone Potter was indeed related to the Durlseys. She looked nothing like any of them. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; their son, Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Persephone, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with a well early developed shape under the baggy clothes she wore. She had long, curly red hair and brilliant, upturned almond shaped green and blue eyes. But because she was a metamorphmagus, she could change her appearance at will very easily, though she had not done anything but keep her eyebrows done.</p><p>Something not so easily covered up was the thin lightning-shaped scar on her forehead. The scar was only there, sketched into her skin abnormally by one of the most dangerous wizards that ever lived who’d failed to murder her and was the reason that she was found by her Aunt Petunia on the doorstep.</p><p>When she was but a year and three months old, Persephone had survived the curse that no one could, the curse with no counter curse, from Voldemort (stupid name, I know). Persephone’s parents were not so lucky, but as it turned out it was not luck but her mother’s love that protected her. The curse had rebounded and nearly destroyed Voldemort’s powers, and himself, really. This was why she was famous, why people had once raised their glasses to The Girl Who Lived.</p><p>But, of course, she’d been brought up by her dead mother’s sister and her husband. Ten years here had truly put a strain on Persephone, especially when she’d been told that her parents abandoned her. At some point, the story changed to they had been in a car accident but it was never mentioned again. It was unnerving, how little respect they had for Persephone’s dead parents.</p><p>As was usual, even ten years of being here would not cause them to miss her. She was surprised Dudley had not taken over her room while she’d been gone.</p><p>“Two minutes in this house and you already make a mess, cause a ruckus already—” Hedwig squawked loudly, “And that bloody bird! You’re lucky I allow you back in this house!”</p><p>After several minutes of screaming, he dragged the suitcase she had out of the room, “No bloody magic tricks in this house!” Before he slammed the door behind him and she heard the click of the lock being locked. She sighed.</p><p>What else had she truly been expecting?</p>
