    <p>Draco was nervous. He couldn’t say that aloud, but he was freaking out.</p><p>The boy at Madam Malkin’s was Harry Potter and he didn’t recognize him. How could he possibly miss that! He spent all of his life listening about Harry Potter’s stories, how he survived the Dark Lord’s Avada Kedavra at only 1 year old, how he would begin Hogwarts the same year as Draco.</p><p>Draco was thrilled: he secretly thought Harry Potter was cool. He hoped they would be sorted both into Slytherin; he would love to have a powerful friend like him, strolling down Hogwarts corridors side by side, becoming strong together and getting the admiration of all their peers.</p><p>The day he arrived at platform 9 and ¾ his heart was pumping fast in his chest, his hands trembling slightly. He was about to make up for not recognizing Potter; he would gain his friendship, cost what it may.</p><p>On the train, he got Crabbe and Goyle with him to give Harry Potter the idea he was someone respected as well. He entered the cabin and saw him. Fuck, was he really cool with his scar and green eyes. Draco took a deep breath to steady himself, he could do it. He stretched his hand, “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”</p><p>Sink or swim.  </p>
