    <p>This was the last thing harry had expected when awoke from the black hole that was blissful sleep. It felt surreal. There, before him, was his own body, laying curled in the fetal position, in the cupboard under the stairs. The scene had all colour bled from it, and seemed to be either completely still, or moving in slow motion. There was a black and green screen in front of his, with a ridiculous and bone-chilling message written on it.</p>

  <b>Player [Mammon] has the following options:</b>

  <b>&gt;Delete save file and restart game&lt;</b>

<h5 align="center">
  <b>&gt;Pick up from last save&lt;</b>

  <b>&gt;Resume from place of death with a penalty&lt;</b>
</h5>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was at a loss for what to do. He absently noted the similarities that, whatever had happened, was similar to the video games that Dudley played. It said he had died. No, that his body had died. So that meant that… this thing, viewed his body as the avatar, and himself, his soul or conscience, as the player. So, deleting his save file and restarting, meant that he would… restart his life? But then, since he couldn’t remember anything like this happening before, this could’ve happened before. So he wouldn’t remember any of his life, would he? And picking up from his last save would’ve been ideal, but then, he didn’t know when his last save was. So that option was also out. His final option was restarting from when he died, but with an unknown penalty… this was undoubtedly the best option, right? It had to be, he wanted to remember who he was, after all. With his mind made up, he reached out and selected the third option. His world once again went black.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When he woke up the next time, he was no longer having an out of body experience. Instead, he was back inside the cupboard under the stairs. He resolved himself to finding out what the hell was going on. As far as he could tell, it was night. There were no footsteps, nor creaking floorboards, and there was hardly any light filtering through the grate on the cupboard door. He couldn’t get back to sleep, he knew it, his mind was in a flurry over the events that had taken place; or rather, event, as hardly anything happened. It was just one thing that was singularly confusing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He tried to calm down, to center his mind and focus. He regulated his breathing, like the monks in the movies he listened to from his cupboard. He could soon hear the skittering of the spiders from the corners of his cupboard, and the crickets’ choir chirping from the open kitchen window, the leaves of the trees fluttering in the wind. He could hear the birds chirping, bees buzzing, dogs yipping, the early morning chatter of the neighbors-</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">His aunt’s sharp voice as she harshly wrapped on the door to the cupboard. “Boy! Get up! Breakfast isn’t going to make itself.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where he once might have wanted to lash back at her for disturbing his sleep, he was calm for once, and knew that talking back only ever got him less food. “Coming, aunt Petunia.” he said in a neutral voice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was strange, he realized, as he was going through the motions of making bacon and eggs, that he wasn’t the slightest bit tired, despite having stayed awake for a good part of the night. He weirdly, didn’t feel hungry either, even though before that strange dream-death-thing, he had been starving. He heard a beep, and looked at the timer on the oven, then to the bacon that was still cooking inside the frying pan. Weird. He went back to his thoughts; so, he didn’t feel sleepy, or the effects of not sleeping, nor did he feel hunger. Now that he thought about it, he didn’t have cramps from sitting in one place for too long, or the regular aches and pains that he usually had; his legs hadn’t fallen asleep either.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He divided the bacon into two Dursley-sized portions, and one Petunia-sized portions. Dudley got three eggs, uncle Vernon got five, and aunt Petunia got two. The toaster popped, and he set to buttering four pieces of bread, setting the next four pieces afterwards, and three more after that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The… box type thing had looked like something out of a game. He should call it the Game System then, right? So then, the box was a menu. If the Game System viewed his life as a game, then he would be playing something along the lines of “the Game of Life”. Would that mean that he has some type of status menu-?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pop up of another black-green status box scared Harry, making him drop the toast he held in his hand onto the floor, buttery side down of course. He stopped clutching the knife like it was his last hope, and put it on the counter, picking up the toast, he put it aside, knowing that it was going to be his piece, if only because it fell on the floor. He was only lucky that it had butter on it, in addition to the dirt that his cousin tracked into the house. He willed the screen away, noting that he could now see three bars in his vision. One was green with the label “Hp”, the one under that was labeled “Mp” and was a purple-y-pinkish colour that Dudley would scream about if he ever found it on his clothes. The last one was light blue, had the label “Sp”, and was already slightly depleted, reading 24/28.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He set the toast on the plates, and the plates at the table, before heading outside to get ahead on his chores, with his floor-toast in his mouth. As he ate, he noticed the Sp bar filling back up. So did that mean it represented hunger? But he didn’t feel hungry. It started slowly going back down when he finished eating and started weeding the garden, pulling thorns and prickles out of his fingers along the way. Hp was likely health or hit points, and Mp was probably mana or magic points- Wait-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He jerked back in surprise, pulling out a particularly tough plant from the rose thicket, but also landing himself on his back, and spraying dirt every which way. He spit the soil out of his mouth and continued.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-Did that mean that magic was real? Or was it only him who could perform magic? He didn’t know whether the Game of Life was a single-player or multiplayer game. He didn’t know a lot of things… back on track though, what is Sp? Skill points? Soul points? Sardine points?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He smiled to himself at that last one. He took the hose out of the shed, and hooked it up to the water main, holding it with his thumb in front of the nozzle, making sure the water sprayed evenly, before watering the roses and other flowers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry sighed, or should it be Mammon now? He just really couldn’t do anything without new information regarding either the Game of Life, or just video games in general. He heard a bell sound, and looked towards the other side of the street, where the paperboy was throwing another paper, before speeding up on his bicycle. He turned the water off and put the hose back in the shed, but getting out the push mower in its place. He mowed the lawn until it was even, before checking that his hand-me downs were dry and free of dirt and then heading inside to do whatever his relatives wanted him to do.</p>
