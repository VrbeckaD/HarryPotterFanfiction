          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our tale begins in Alecto and Amycus Carrow's house. The couple are discussing the sentence The Minister For Magic gave them instead of time in Azkaban.</p><p>Amycus said, "I can't believe he wants us to be Defence Against The Dark Arts Professors."</p><p>Alecto smirked. "I can't believe we said yes."</p><p>Amycus pointed out, "Teaching a bunch of teenagers has to be better than Azkaban, Ally."</p><p>Alecto muttered, "We never did much teaching last time round though, did we?"</p><p>Amycus told her, "That's all behind us now."</p><p>Alecto asked, "Do you think we will be good teachers?"</p><p>Amycus replied, "I can't know for sure, but I do know that we can teach these kids which path not to go down."</p><p>Alecto smiled slightly. "We certainly have more experience in that area than most, but we can't just teach them about the bad side of the subject, Am."</p><p>Amycus chuckled. "Course not, but it's a starting point."</p><p>Alecto beamed, "You know, I rather like the sound of Professor Carrow."</p><p>Amycus grinned. "It certainly has a nice ring to it."</p></div>
