    <p>Minerva McGonagall was one of the few Hogwarts employees who had not been hired by Albus Dumbledore. The others were Filius Flitwick, who was <em>gifted </em>to Hogwarts in the 1760s’ aftermath of yet another Goblin War and Rolanda Hooch, who, like Minerva, was the legacy of Headmaster Dippet. As Minerva was hired before Albus’ takeover of Hogwarts, she had undergone the ritual magic binding all Professors had been required to undergo prior to Albus’ Headmastership. The ritual meant that Minerva’s magic (as well as Filius’ and Rolanda’s) was intertwined with the magic of Hogwarts. </p><p>Albus had done away with the ritual magic binding, as his history with the Dark Arts meant that he was still biased against the old ways of doing magic. Of course, as Headmaster, he had had to bind his magic to the school, but after having done so he passed a new rule for hiring professors that did away with the ritual entirely. The fact that Hogwarts’ magic would never have willingly enabled Severus Snape to become a Professor, let alone a Master, had the ritual still been practiced was only one reason Albus had no regrets about ending the practice. The others, like everything else Albus did, would remain secret.</p><p>Minerva McGonagall was not a woman who typically regretted her choices. She loved her art of Transfiguration, she loved teaching, and she loved Hogwarts. Never did she regret having her magic connected to the school’s, not even when Hogwarts’ limitations became a stranglehold on Rolanda and Filius’ plans.</p><p> The only time she ever held any emotion other than respectful awe for Hogwarts was the day she witnessed Harry James Potter’s Sorting. The Sortings, as Deputy Headmistress, were always her favorite time to be a Professor. Reading the names, watching the children react to the Great Hall, seeing their reactions before hearing the Hat reveal where they’d be for the next nine months - all of it was what kept Professor McGonagall in good spirits throughout the summer. She remembered the Sorting of Harry’s parents almost as vividly as she did her own - watching Lily Evans fearlessly take the Hat and speak to it out loud, arguing with it about her personality, watching James saunter up and immediately follow Pettigrew into Gryffindor - Minerva McGonagall had been friends with the Potter’s, and expected someone similar in their son.</p><p>Watching Harry Potter trembling up to the Sorting Hat was one of the worst experiences of Minerva’s life. She saw, as any trained adult would, the fear in the boy’s face, the undernourishment, the way he angled his posture as far from her as he could. She felt his flinch as she accidentally touched him in placing the Hat. </p><p>Hogwarts’ magic prevented her from reacting - from beckoning over Poppy or even reassuring Harry that he was safe here. She was unable to bring the boy back to reality, and could only wait, could only take the Hat after its shout, could only call out the next name.</p><p>Never did McGonagall regret binding her magic, until her magic couldn’t help that poor, mistreated boy she had allowed Dumbledore to neglect. But by then, she was too late, and under the too-watchful eyes of Albus Dumbledore to help that underfed Ravenclaw.</p>
