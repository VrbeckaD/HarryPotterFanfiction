    <p>STORY TITLE: To Be A Master<br/>PART: 01 Claiming<br/>AUTHOR: Red Jacobson (red.jacobson@gmail.com)<br/>DISTRIBUTION:  My Yahoo Group, HP FanFiction Archive, Archive of Our Own, <br/>Hentai-Foundry, Questionable Questing<br/>DISCLAIMER: None of the Characters You Recognize belong to me, they all belong to JK Rowling and her publishers. <br/>SUMMARY: After the Interview with Rita Skeeter, Luna approaches Harry with a strange request<br/>FEEDBACK: Of course! It Makes Me Write Faster<br/>RELATIONSHIPS: Harry/Multi<br/>RATING: NC-17<br/>WORD COUNT: &lt;5,405&gt;<br/>SPOILERS:   None, if you don't know how the Harry Potter story goes by now, why are you reading this story?<br/>WARNINGS: If You've ever read any of my stories, you know what to expect, Oral, anal, Femme-slash, dom/sub, multiple partners, and Femme-cest.  <br/>AUTHORS NOTES:  Hogwarts starts at 13 in this universe, so Luna is 16 at the time of the story and Harry is 17.</p>
<p>Saturday, February 17th, 1996<br/>Room of Requirement<br/>After Dinner</p>
<p>“I'm sorry, Luna, but I'm going to need you to repeat that!  You could not have possibly said what I heard you say!”</p>
<p>Luna sighed, shaking her head, “Harry, I understand your shock but it's really the only way to prevent the Ministry from taking me and using me as their pet seer for the rest of my life.   I know that it's not accepted in the muggle world but this is not the world you grew up in.   But if it makes you feel better I'll repeat myself.   I need you, Harry James Potter, to claim me, Luna Selena Lovegood, as your personal slave in payment of the life debt I owe you for destroying You Know Who's body when you were a baby.”</p>
<p>He shook his head in disbelief, “Okay, that's what I thought you said, but, isn't there any other way? I was treated as a slave my entire life by my relatives and I refuse to treat anybody else the way I was  treated!”</p>
<p>Luna smiled sadly, “Harry, if there was another way, don't you think that Daddy, Hermione and I would have found it by now?  Daddy understood from the very beginning that a blatant attack on the Ministry’s reputation would see him arrested and has been preparing for it ever since I suggested this over Yule.   He isn't happy about what I would have to do as your slave but I think that's just because he doesn't want to think about me having sex with anyone.   I talked to Hermione when we came back after break and the three of us have been researching for a legal way to prevent the Unspeakables from taking me.  We are all in agreement that this is the only way.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute!  Hermione, the Society for the Promotion of Elvish Welfare Hermione, who is trying to free the house elves, says that you need to be a slave?     That doesn't make any sense!” </p>
<p>“Actually, it's the mistreatment of the elves that upsets her, she knows that you would never mistreat me, and that I'm choosing to be your slave.  I've got a note from her telling you that.  She knew that you would worry about her reaction.”    </p>
<p>Reaching into her robes, she pulled out a scrap of parchment and handed it to him.  Harry read over it, recognizing Hermione's hurried writing, and it was basically what Luna had said with a postscript that threatened to show him exactly what a wicked witch could do if he ever mistreated Luna!</p>
<p>He folded the parchment and put it in his pocket before looking at Luna again, “And you're really okay with this? With being a slave?”</p>
<p>She shook her head, “No, I'll admit I'm not enthusiastic about the idea but it's better than the alternative, which would see me locked in a cell for the next few hundred years, fed potions to force me to have visions every day and night until I died!”</p>
<p>He stared at her, his jaw working but no sounds coming out.   He couldn't let that happen to her, not to anyone, but especially not to a girl who had become a friend!</p>
<p>Closing his eyes, Harry sighed. “Do you actually have to be a slave? If I were to marry you, or make you a part of the Potter family another way, wouldn't that protect you?”</p>
<p>Her gentle smile didn't change as Luna shook her head, “While marrying you would protect me, and I would love to be your wife, unfortunately, it wouldn't work.  In order to be a recognized marriage, both of us would have to be at least 17, or have passed our OWLs, and we don't qualify under the Ministry's own laws.”</p>
<p>“Okay, what do we have to do to make this legal?”</p>
<p>“The initial binding is fairly simple.  You take your wand and point it at me, saying 'I, Harry James Potter claim Luna Selene Lovegood as a slave in payment of the debt she owes me.'  You could expand on that by stating what the debt is from but it's not really necessary, the magic of the binding recognizes the reason for the debt.  Anyway, once that is done, I have to serve you sexually and, once that is completed, my magic and life will be bound to yours.”</p>
<p>She must have realized what he was going to say because Luna continued before he could object, “It's not rape, Harry, I would be happy to have sex with you even without the slave bond and, if the situation weren't so urgent I would prove it to you by giving you my body before you claimed me! But there is a possibility that one of Umbridge's spies saw us with Rita this afternoon and, if we leave the room without doing the ceremony I could be taken before morning!”    </p>
<p>There was never any chance that he was going to turn her away, even though he really hated the idea that the Wizarding World still accepted enslaving people like this.  Still, he wanted to make sure she enjoyed what was going to happen as much as possible.   Casting a spell to sound the alert when it was an hour before curfew, he reached out for her...</p>
<p>Luna stiffened when he put his arms around her and he said softly, “I'll perform the ritual in just a couple of minutes Luna, but first, I want to make sure you know that I do care about you, my lovely Moonchild, and will always do my best to take care of you and protect you.  I would have done that even without this ritual but I have even more reason to now and I swear you won't regret it!”</p>
<p>She looked up at him, a hopeful expression in her eyes, and he lowered his face to hers.  Luna realized what he was going to do and a smile blossomed on her face as she moved to meet his lips.</p>
<p>He gave a silent prayer of thanks to Tonks for the lessons over the summer as his lips pressed softly against the nervous blonde's, his hands rubbing her back as he opened his mouth slightly and licked her closed lips.  Luna relaxed in his embrace and her lips parted, allowing him entry, but he continued kissing her softly.   She started responding, her body rubbing against his, and he dropped one of his hands to lightly caress her bum through the robes she was wearing.  She moaned into his mouth, moving her arse back so he could touch more of her, and he took that as a signal to move things along.</p>
<p>His free hand moved between their bodies and opened the top button of her robes and Luna's hands joined him in removing her outer clothing.   They were still kissing when the robes landed on the floor of the room, and she broke the kiss to pull the blouse over her head, standing there in her skirt and a bra.</p>
<p>She paused, letting him enjoy the sight of her nearly topless body, and he smiled at her, saying, “Lovely as I imagined, Luna, but that's no surprise.  You are a beautiful woman inside and out.”  She blushed but a pleased grin crossed her lips at his compliment.   “Are you ready for me to see all of you, Luna?”</p>
<p>She froze for a second, but nodded, biting her lower lip nervously, her hands going behind her back to unhook the bra.  He said, “There's no need for that, let me show you a spell I learned for a situation like this.”</p>
<p>Luna looked at him curiously and he drew his wand and, concentrating on what he wanted it to do, murmured the command for the switching spell, and Luna's clothes fell off her body, landing in a pile next to her.  She jerked in surprise before smiling widely, “What spell was that? I've never heard of a spell that could take your clothes off without tearing them!”</p>
<p>Harry chuckled, “It's just the switching spell, I learned to use it last summer to switch your clothes with the air around you.  Handy little thing, isn't it?”</p>
<p>She nodded but then it seemed to hit her that she was completely nude in front of him while he was still fully dressed.  His eyes looked her over appreciatively, from the well kissed lips to her generous breasts, usually hidden by the uniform, to her soft belly and the thatch of soft blonde hair covering her mound.   He licked his lips and nodded, murmuring 'beautiful, simply beautiful, my love.”  He raised his eyes to look her in the face and saw the fear there and he realized just what he needed to do next.</p>
<p>Smiling encouragingly at her, he said, “Are you a virgin, Luna? Don't be afraid if you are, I'll teach you how to please me but I need to know.”</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and took a deep breath before looking at him and nodding.  “Then I'm going to make sure you treasure your first experience.   We have several hours before curfew, giving us plenty of time before we have to complete the binding.”</p>
<p>Her face lit up and she smiled, “Really?  I thought it would take longer for you to be ready after each time! That makes me feel a lot better!”</p>
<p>He laughed, “Someday, I'll tell you about the training that members of the Black family receive and how we improve our stamina and recovery time.  Trust me, I've gone several times in one night and my partners were always very satisfied!”</p>
<p>Taking control of the room, a large comfortable bed appeared behind them and he reached out for her hand.  Once she was stretched out on the bed, he stripped out of his clothing and her eyes widened at her first look at his hard cock.   He climbed on the bed with her and moved so that he was laying between her legs and said, “I may not know much about being a Master, but I do know this isn't something a Master would do for his slave, except for extremely rare occasions, but it is something a man would do for his lover, and that's what you are to me now, so relax and enjoy it.”</p>
<p>Spreading her legs, he slid down so that his face was directly above her pussy and he blew lightly, his warm breath rustling the soft down covering her.  She squealed happily only for the noise to turn to a gasp when he placed a soft kiss directly on her pussy lips.   He continued kissing along her inner thighs and she spread her legs wider, whines of anticipation and need coming from her throat.</p>
<p>He kept teasing her, his mouth touching her everywhere but where she was desperately wanting him, and he smiled.  He had driven Tonks and her friend Hestia crazy when he had done that to the two of them, at the end of his training, and they had far more experience than Luna had even dreamed of!</p>
<p>Finally, his tongue slipped out and he ran it along her moistening lips, drawing a pleased sigh from her.  The petals were starting to swell as her excitement rose and he sucked on each of them in turn before sliding his tongue inside her.  Luna jerked under his touch, her hips lifting off the bed as she tried to get more of him into her pussy.   He obliged her, his hands lifting her legs until they were over his shoulders and he went back to licking her.   </p>
<p>Luna's excitement was obviously growing as her sweet juices filled his mouth.  Harry swallowed happily and enjoyed the guttural noises coming from her mouth.  His tongue was brushing the quivering girl’s inner walls and she screamed in pleasure when it landed on her clit.  He paced himself, his magic listening to the reactions of Luna's body the way he was taught and, when she was right on the edge of climaxing, he shifted so that his lips engulfed her nub and sucked gently.</p>
<p>He lifted his mouth off of her after she came with a shriek, her body shaking and her hands beating on the mattress as she cried out, her head lolling from side to side as the sensations took her places that she'd never been before!</p>
<p>Harry lowered her legs to the bed and moved to the side, shifting so his arms could hold her as she drifted into her own little world.   When he saw her eyes clearing, he leaned over and kissed her, which she eagerly returned, before breaking away and smiling widely.  “That was.... that was.... Oh, Harry! Thank you! Thank you!  I never dreamed it would feel so good!  Even when I touched myself, it wasn't like that!”</p>
<p>He grinned, “And it's just beginning, Luna, things are only going to get better, I promise!”</p>
<p>She actually chuckled, “Oh, Morganna! I don't know if my body can handle that but I can't wait to find out!”</p>
<p>Harry laughed. “You'll soon get used to it, trust me!”  </p>
<p>Pulling his wand, he cast a contraceptive spell and nodded when she glowed blue for a second before pointing the wand directly at her opening and cast two more quick spells.   She was watching him as he cast and asked “What were those spells, Harry? I could tell they relaxed me but what did they do?”</p>
<p>He smiled, “The first one was a muscle relaxer, so that it doesn't hurt when I stretch you out, and the second softened your barrier so that it won't be painful when I go through it.   I promised you that you would enjoy yourself and that pain, ever if it's brief, would interfere with that.  Now, are you ready?”</p>
<p>She nodded quickly, “Yes Harry, and thank you for taking the time to do this for me.  That was the part I was really nervous about, having you take me when the magic of the binding might force you to be rough with me.”</p>
<p>He leaned down and kissed her, before saying “Rough can be a lot of fun as well, Luna, but not for your first time.  But we've got years to learn all the different ways we can enjoy each other.  For now, let me love you.”</p>
<p>She smiled, “Yes, please, Harry, love me like a girlfriend.  I'm already much happier about becoming your slave, now, but let me enjoy this first.”</p>
<p>Harry lifted himself so that he was leaning over her and he reached down to rub the head of his cock along her wide open lips.  She shivered happily at his touch and, when he saw in her eyes she was ready, he pushed forward smoothly until he was completely inside her body.</p>
<p>Her eyes widened in surprise and she gave a small gasp when he tore through her barrier but then she smiled as she adjusted to him for the first time.  He was pleased that the spells had worked properly since Luna was the first virgin he'd ever been with and he wanted to make sure she wasn't hurt, especially with what was going to happen later.</p>
<p>Harry held still until she was completely comfortable and then pulled back slightly and pushing forward.  He smiled as she started moving with him right away and leaned down to kiss her again.  Her mouth opened eagerly to him as his tongue claimed her mouth, her arms wrapping around him as he started moving faster and deeper into her body.</p>
<p>He could feel her magic reacting with his as he claimed her body and he shifted position slightly, letting him get even deeper.  She gasped against his mouth and he could feel her fingernails scratching his back as she lifted herself against him.   They soon fell into a rhythm as they moved together and Luna's gasps soon turned into moans and cries of pleasure as mini orgasms wracked her body.   </p>
<p>Harry could feel the pressure building and he looked directly into Luna's eyes, “I'm about to cum, love, are you ready to feel it? To know that when the time comes I will be putting our children into your body?”</p>
<p>Luna's eyes went wider than ever. He knew somehow that it was a deeply hidden desire of hers to be a mother and he could see the happiness shining out from her silvery eyes.  “Yes, Luna, you will be the mother of my children, showing that no matter what the outside world thinks of your status in my life, you will know that I love you!”</p>
<p>Tears of joy filled her eyes and, as he buried himself completely inside her, his release flooding her, she tightened around him as she climaxed as well.  Luna lifted her head and her lips sought his, kissing him with a passion that surprised them both, before she fell back on the bed and panted, the orgasm pulsing through both of them.</p>
<p>He lay on top of her, kissing her as he gently moved inside her, his cock softening slightly as the tension eased.  When she finally calmed down, Luna looked up at him and softly said, “Are you really going to give me your babies, Harry? Am I going to really be the mother of our family?”</p>
<p>The desperate hope in her voice meant that there was only one way he could possibly answer her and he said “Of course, you are, Luna, but not until we graduate. You will have the Potter heir and, if your father agrees, your second son will carry on the Lovegood name, would you like that?”</p>
<p>She was speechless for an instant, before she lunged up at him, kissing him and actually managing to roll them over so she was on top of him, still snogging the very life out of him!</p>
<p>The way she moved against him soon had him hard again and she gave a delighted wriggle when she felt him against her thigh.  “Wow! Already?  You weren't having me on, were you?”</p>
<p>A sultry look crossed her face and she said, “So what do you want next, my love? Do you want me to to use my mouth on you? I've never done it before but I did practice with some of Ginny's toys a couple of times.”  He blinked in surprise at the idea of Ginny having sex toys but then she said, “Or maybe you want to bugger my virgin arse? I knew it was going to happen so I made sure I would be nice and clean before I even left the dorm this morning.”   </p>
<p>He got even harder at the idea, which made Luna smile even wider, “You want my arse, Harry? To know that you are claiming something I had never even considered before I researched what we would do for the binding?   Or do you want to make me your slave while you are plundering my naughty rear?”</p>
<p>He didn't say anything but rolled over until she was under him and then moved her until she was laying on her belly.   Grabbing a pillow, he slid it under her hips and she lifted herself to give him easier access.  </p>
<p>“Please be gentle with me, I've never even had a finger in there before, even though Ginny tells me it feels really good. I was too nervous to do it.”</p>
<p>He leaned down and kissed the side of her face, saying softly, “I promise and I always keep my promises, you know that by now!”</p>
<p>She nodded and reached back, holding herself open for him.   He placed his wand at her tight ring and said, “This will feel a little unusual but I'm cleaning and getting you relaxed and lubricated. It will make things a lot easier for you because, I can tell you now, I absolutely love your arse and will want to be taking it on a regular basis!”</p>
<p>He pushed a little extra of his magic into the spells, wanting to make sure she enjoyed taking him in her arse, because he hadn't been lying. He absolutely adored her arse. It looked like an upside down heart and he knew that he was going to be enjoying it on a regular basis.   He couldn't help being an arse man. Tonks had been the first girl he had ever buggered and he had almost lost his mind from the heat and tightness! Fortunately Tonks had enjoyed being buggered as well so she didn't object when he wanted to keep 'practicing' the act.  Even Hestia, who didn't usually care for it, said that she had enjoyed herself when it was her turn. But now, it was time to put their lessons into effect!</p>
<p>Luna moaned as his magic prepared her and the little extra sent tingles of pleasure through the nerves in that part of her body, making her squirm on top of the pillow.   </p>
<p>Rubbing his finger around the ring of muscle, he suggested, “Reach between your legs and touch yourself, Luna, it will make it feel even better.”</p>
<p>She immediately obeyed him and her fingers were playing with her lips as he popped the tip of his finger inside her hole.   He let more magic trickle out of his finger and into her tunnel. Combined with the fingers she was pumping into her pussy, it soon had her crying out softly.   He took his time, allowing her to adjust to each finger as he stretched her until she was moving against his hand as he pushed all four fingers inside her.</p>
<p>When she was ready, he removed his fingers and used a wandless spell that Tonks had trained him on to clean them and put the bulb of his cock against the gaping hole.   She grunted when the ring stretched even further to allow him entrance but then sighed when his head pushed through and it tightened around him again.</p>
<p>Harry held still, making sure she was completely adjusted to the intrusion before he moved. She wasn't accustomed to being filled like this and he was careful to wait until she was ready.  It was strange that his magic was reading hers already and he could tell that she was starting to enjoy the fullness.  </p>
<p>Going deeper, he could feel her happiness at being able to take him so easily and also that her body was starting to react as well.  “You like this, don't you, Luna? You like that I'm taking your arse, that I'm going to be owning your body soon, having you in my bed every night, finding out all the possible ways to make you scream my name!”</p>
<p>He buried himself completely in her arse as he was talking and she couldn't answer him, only nodding her head as fast as she could.  Harry could feel her fingers inside her pussy as his cock filled her and she was moaning louder and louder with gasps and cries of pleasure as he claimed her arse.   </p>
<p>When she started pushing back against him, he leaned down and started kissing the back of her neck and her jawline, drawing a sigh of pleasure from her lips.  He concentrated and sent his magic into her skin where his lips touched her and her sounds of pleasure came more frequently and intensely.   </p>
<p>Harry started moving faster as he shagged her and she tightened around him as he pulled back, her body moving on its own as it responded to his touch and his magic.   </p>
<p>He knew that she was very close by the way her body was tensing up and he could feel her magic pulsing in time with his own. He waited until she was peaking again before he relaxed his control and his cock swelled, his seed splashing hot inside her.</p>
<p>He was still hard when he withdrew when Luna shocked him by actually rolling over and moving so she could take him in her mouth!   He couldn't believe that the girl who was a complete virgin less than an hour before would be taking him in her mouth after he buggered her!</p>
<p>She was enthusiastic but unskilled as she licked and sucked him, although he was happy she was being careful with her teeth!   Luna looked up at him as she used her mouth and he had to grin at the happiness in her eyes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was already tired from the events of the day, what with the disastrous date with Cho and then the tension of the interview with Rita then cumming twice with Luna. That meant that he couldn’t reisist very long once Luna started sucking him and he started to warn her “Luna! I'm about to....” before he erupted into her mouth.   </p>
<p>She didn't even blink, just swallowing everything he had, until the last burst filled her mouth and she pulled back, releasing him.  He watched as she finished swallowing and then, smiling serenely, wiped up the rest of his seed that had dribbled down her chin.   Harry was amazed at how innocent she managed to look licking her fingers clean!</p>
<p>She smiled up at him as she finished cleaning her fingers and said, “That was interesting, not quite as yummy as pudding but still quite tasty.  Thank you, Harry.”</p>
<p>He shook his head and pulled her into a hug, smiling softly.  “Thank you, Luna, for the wonderful gift you've given me.  But it's starting to get late and I'm going to need a few minutes to recover before being ready to finalize the binding.”</p>
<p>Her smile didn't waver, she just calmly said, “Then we should probably get started.  I'm not nervous about it any more, not after how wonderful you made me feel.  I think I'm actually looking forward to learning how to be your slave.”</p>
<p>Harry blinked in realization and he thought, 'Shite! She's right, I have no idea how to handle a slave, or even what my responsibilities are.  Damn it!'  He shook his head, 'Okay, you can think about that later. Right now, she's waiting for you to claim her.'</p>
<p>Pulling his wand, he pointed it at Luna and recited the oath.  He hadn't been expecting a reaction, other than possibly a slight glow of magic but, when he finished, a rope of magic streamed from the tip of his wand and circled Luna's throat!  The magic flared brightly, making both of them close their eyes against the light.  </p>
<p>When he opened his eyes again, Luna was touching her throat in wonder and he could see the outline of a collar around her neck and the words 'Property of Harry James Potter' flowing around inside it!  </p>
<p>He could also feel Luna clearly in his magic. He could tell that she was surprised but extremely happy with whatever happened.  She also was excited about having sex with him again which made him feel good, knowing that he had given her so much pleasure.</p>
<p>Clearing his throat, he asked, “Luna? Was that supposed to happen?”</p>
<p>She shook her head, “No, Master, it wasn't.  The collar shouldn't have appeared until after you finished claiming me and I was kneeling before you.  However, I can feel your magic wrapped up with mine. It's not a restricting feeling but more a loving, supporting feeling!  And I can feel you in my heart as well, you are starting to love me? That's not what I expected at all. It's so much better!  This is so wonderful, you've made me even happier than I thought I would ever be!”</p>
<p>Harry just smiled and pulled her into his arms again, feeling the connection between them, and they sat quietly for several minutes until the alarm chime went off and the pair reluctantly separated.</p>
<p>Once they were cleaned and dressed, and Luna cleaned her mouth, he kissed her and they left the room.</p>
<p>He walked her to her dorms, already thinking about how to move her in with him and if there were anything Umbridge could do to stop it?   He really needed advice and was mentally composing a letter to Sirius as he turned to make his way back to Gryffindor Tower.</p>
<p>He was so deep in thought about what he needed to write that he almost missed his name being called.  </p>
<p>Turning to see who was calling him, he froze when he saw Cho standing in the open doorway to an abandoned classroom.   She beckoned him in and he followed, looking around curiously.</p>
<p>When the door closed behind them, he was surprised that Cho wrapped her arms around him and hugged him tightly before letting go.  She smiled enigmatically at him and said, “Did  you know that I have a family invisibility cloak, Harry?  Well, I do and I happened to have it with me today.  I followed you and Hermione and heard everything.  I also heard a very interesting conversation between Hermione and Luna and I saw that Luna was walking strangely with a smile on her face. Did you enjoy claiming her?”</p>
<p>He blushed. This was not a conversation he was prepared for at all!  But he didn't even try to deny it, he just said, “If you heard the conversation, you know why I claimed her and, yes, I enjoyed it. I also made sure that she got as much pleasure out of it as I did.”</p>
<p>Cho grinned, “Lucky girl!  But, as interesting as your afternoon must have been, that's not what I wanted to talk to you about.  You see, after you left with Luna and Hermione, I stayed there for another hour or so, thinking and I realized that I'm not ready to date anyone yet.  I still need to deal with what happened to Cedric, although hearing what you said helped with that. Thank you, Harry.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded, not sure what to say to that, and she continued, “I care for you, Harry, I care for you a lot, and I would have happily dated you last year if you had asked me to the Ball before Cedric did.  But, well, you didn't and Cedric did.  So, um, would you be willing to give me time? I'm planning on a lot of meditation and guided dreaming to resolve my feelings and I hope to have a better grip on things by the end of the year.”</p>
<p>“If you don't mind that I've claimed Luna, I'm still willing to see if we can make a go of it, sure.  And, to be honest, with what the Umbitch is doing, I doubt I'd be much fun as a boyfriend, anyway.”  He grinned, “I just hope that the DADA Professor Curse gets rid of her sooner than the end of the year!”</p>
<p>She laughed, “We can only hope and, no, I understand why you are claiming Luna and I think I know you well enough to know you wouldn't hurt her, so it doesn't bother me.”  She paused, “In fact, the only thing that is bothering me right now is the fact that I broke down crying the last time we kissed.  I'd like to remedy that, if you don't mind?”</p>
<p>What could he say? He opened his arms for her and Cho flowed into his embrace, tilting her face up to his.   Their kiss was much better this time around and she was squirming in his arms by the time they broke for air.</p>
<p>Cho gave a shaky laugh, “Damn, Harry!  I'm going to need to change my knickers after that kiss. You do know how to motivate a girl, don't you?”</p>
<p>She turned toward the door before looking back and saying, “By the way, if we do start to date again, and you are interested, I wouldn't have a problem if Luna joined us in bed.  I always did think she was kind of cute!”</p>
<p>With a giggle at his gobsmacked expression, she slipped out the door and left him standing there.</p>
<p>His brain finally rebooted a few moments later and he started laughing, shaking his head in amusement.  Checking the time, he saw that he still had almost 30 minutes to get back to the tower and wrote a quick note to Sirius.   Calling Dobby when he finished, the eager elf promised to deliver it to Harry's dog-father right away, and disappeared.</p>
<p>He managed to get back to the tower with minutes to spare and made his way up to his dorm, where he fell asleep almost as soon as he hit the pillows.</p>
