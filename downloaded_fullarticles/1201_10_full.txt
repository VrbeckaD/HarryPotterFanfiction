    <p>“This,” Peter hissed from where he stood a few feet away from the thick, oppressive hedge wall, “is <em>such </em>a bad idea.”</p><p>Peter was standing with the weight of his body on the tips of feet, ready to sprint away at a moment’s notice. From where he stood eyeing the high hey, Sirius waved his friend’s concerns away. “You’re only saying that because you’re a Beta. Trust me, mate. This is a fantastic idea.”</p><p>James let out a sound of agreement from the back of his throat, reaching out with a finger to touch one of the wicked thorns that dotted the hedge before pulling it back with a hiss, sucking on the cut skin. “Dunno, Paddy, if that spell doesn’t work than we’re gonna be in a <em>lot </em>of trouble.”</p><p>"Don't be such a pussy, Prongs." Sirius said sassily, smirking as he began the climb. His breath caught when they finally managed to reach the top, though whether it was due to the beauty of the well-tended garden or the forbidden-ness of it all, he had no idea.</p><p>Parthenus’ Pool was a misshapen oval, a mossy green color with blossoming waterlilies and tall cattails interrupting its tranquil and startling clear waters. A ring of dark grey stones surrounded it and at its center was a wooden platform. There were a handful of bodies sunning themselves on or in the waters around it, but even though James elbowed him excitedly they were too far off for them to make any features out. The temple to Artemis Parthenus stood at the far edge, a simple belvedere pavilion of white marble, thin veins of grey and gold winding through the polished stone. Through the columns, Sirius could see a golden hind statue, its neck and body bedecked in strings of amaranth and primrose, while bushels of rowan, hawthorn, gorse, hazel and marsh marigolds were laid at its feet.</p><p>The smell of incenses was heavy in the air, hiding any other scents, and thick reeds of the stuff stood tall all across the well maintained lawn, burning sluggish but steadily. They all took a scent blocker potion at school, to keep them from really knowing their genders, and Sirius was disappointed that he couldn't catch genuine Omega scent. There were fabric chaupal tents set up here and there, brightly colored and fanciful, and plush and soft looking oriental rugs covered with piles of pillows dotting the lawn. James elbowed him again, eyes blown wide in surprise as he stared just below them.</p><p>Sirius followed his stare down and felt his heart skip before picking up in a gallop.</p><p>Regulus laid below them, as naked as the day he was born, his delicately pale skin exposed to the harsh sun. Reggie had presented as an Omega? Why had no one <em>told him?</em> Yeah, Sirius wasn’t exactly on speaking terms with his family, but he always had a soft spot for his younger brother. And he’d thought Regulus had felt the same fondness; so why hadn’t he told Sirius of his orientation? A surge of protective possessiveness roared in his breast and Sirius nearly caused them both to go tumbling from the hedge as he slapped his hand over James’ eyes, the other Alpha squawking, hands windmilling for a moment before recapturing his grasp.</p><p>James’ slapped his hand away, brown eyes livid. “What the <em>hell, </em>Sirius? I could have fallen; do you want us to be caught?”</p><p>“Stop looking at my brother.” Sirius snarled back, face livid. “Stop it – it’s not decent, you prick.”</p><p>James gave him an incredulous look. “What about anything we’re doing right now is ‘decent?’”</p><p>“That was before-”</p><p>The rest of his complaint was lost by the sound of a soft tenor ‘tsking,’ and they both looked down in time to see <em>Severus Snape </em>emerge from a nearby chaupal, as naked as the other Omegas in the garden. Would the day’s surprises ever end? Who would have thought that disagreeable Snivellus could possibly be an Omega? He was as tall and gangly as ever, but apparently his robes had been hiding not a stingy beanpole but the lithe pull of firm muscles, and long, lean legs that went on seemingly forever before ending in a plump, perfectly taunt, bubble-butt. For once his hair was pulled back in a loose braid that hung over one shoulder, revealing the graceful curve of his neck.</p><p>“You’re going to burn to a crisp, Reg.” Snape pointed out as he collapsed in an ungraceful pile next to Regulus.</p><p>“Mm,” Reggie agreed, stretching both arms out, hands clasped together in a full body stretch that left Sirius red with discomfort and James’ making an odd choking sound from his right. “I can’t help it though; the sun feels so good. I feel like a cat.”</p><p>“Cats don’t get sunburn,” Snape pointed out before reaching for a bottle of sun lotion. He upended the bottle, the white lotion forming thick, sluggish dots across his younger brother’s lower back that Sirius revolted mind couldn’t help but cast in a dirty light. Next to him James’ made another choked off sound while Sirius’ hands tightened to the point of pain on the thick branches, fighting the urge to turn and backhand his friend.</p><p>“James, I swear to Merlin-”</p><p>“Shut <em>up, </em>Padfoot,” James hissed, “you’re gonna get us caught.”</p><p>“You ready for tomorrow?”</p><p>“No.” Regulus said sullenly, resting his chin on his arms. “I tried to get Daddy to get me out of it, but he wouldn’t budge. Just went on and on and on about what a pleasure it was, what an honor, how grateful I should be to be chosen as the May Queen. As if this whole thing isn’t just the most embarrassing thing ever.” Snape let out a soft sound of understanding, his long fingers kneeding the sunblock in. “…I hope the King’s not Lucius.”</p><p>Sirius whole heartedly agreed. The May Chase was a tradition as old as the festival itself; unbound Alphas would chase after the May Queen, an Omega who had been chosen through a lottery, having to get by their court of equally unbound Omegas to catch them. The lucky Omega would then be blessed with good luck and fertility, and more often than not a marriage contract. Despite this, the current King of May and the May Queen, as well as their court, spent an inordinate amount of time together throughout the festival – with the ‘royal pair’ often alone. There were always rumors, of course, the type of rumors that always followed leaving unmated Alphas and Omegas alone together. And rumors or not, Sirius wanted <em>none </em>of it near his baby brother.</p><p>“You most certainly should be hoping it’s Lucius.” Snape corrected, stretching out on his back beside Regulus body, legs corking up into the air and crossing at the ankles. Sirius was torn between a fierce hatred for the Omega he already didn’t like suggesting such a thing and staring at the queerly enticing swells of Snape’s ass as they plumped with the movement. “At least with Lucius you’ll be safe. It could be Rodolphus.”</p><p>Regulus visibly flinched at the name, pressed in closer to Snape’s side, their shoulders rubbing against each other. “Yes,” his brother agreed, voice a whisper, “you’re right. Of course, you’re right.”</p><p>Snape sighed, leaning over to press his forehead against Regulus’ shoulder and their hair spilled messily together, the dark coloring making it almost impossible to tell apart. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have brought him up.”</p><p>Sirius’ mind was racing, trying to think of any conflict that could have happened between Rodolphus Lestrange and his brother, but was drawling a blank. The awful truth of it was that Sirius had taken to ignoring Regulus, even when he was in the same room, as looking at his younger brother was too much of a reminder of what he’d lost. As much as Sirius had fought with his family, as much as they represented everything he’d come to hate about pureblood society, they were still his <em>family. </em>The way they’d tossed him away so easily, like a pair of shoes that no longer fit, hurt.</p><p>There was a long silence and then a sigh as Regulus rolled over onto his stomach (Sirius thanked his lucky stars that Snape’s body interrupted the view of his brother’s privates), and a pale hand gently carded through the older Omega’s hair. “Not talking about him doesn’t make him go away.”</p><p>“You know…” Snape paused, before sighing again, “you should tell your brother what’s going on.” <em>Yes, </em>Sirius agreed, nodding his head despite the fact that neither Omega could possibly see him. “He’s the worst type of prick, and I doubt he can hold a thought in his head, but he’s got that Alpha protective streak a mile wide. You see how he is with his little ‘quartet.’”</p><p>A single, well-sculpted eyebrow rose on Regulus face, and in the moment he looked so much like a softer version of their sire, Orion, that Sirius felt his heart ache. “Did you just call my brother a good Alpha?”</p><p>Strangely breathless, Sirius wondered the same thing.</p><p>Snape sputtered soundlessly for a few moments, before whacking a laughing Reggie hard on the shoulder. “I said no such thing, you prat.”</p><p>Regulus’ laughter petered off. “…I can’t tell Sirius; he doesn’t even know I presented. After my parents disowned him, I was forbidden from any type of contact with him.”</p><p>“But surely-”</p><p>“I can’t risk being disowned, Sev.” The younger Omega interrupted, “the only thing worse than being an Omega is a poor Omega, why I’d be penniless, and-” Regulus’ cut off abruptly, his expression instantly contrite. Next to him, Snape had gone very, very still. “Oh, Severus, I…I’m sorry, sometimes I’m just as big of a spoiled brat as my brother.”</p><p>Snape pushed himself into a sitting position, one leg stretched out while the other bent upwards, and the older Omega let out a harsh laugh as he hugged his knee to his chest and when he spoke, his voice was just as harsh. “You don’t have to apologize for speaking the truth, Regulus. As one of those ‘penniless Omegas’ let me assure you that your statement is far from incorrect. Alas,” the Omega flicked at the damp end of his braid, “the Goddess didn’t even seem fit to bless me with good looks to make up for my empty bank account.”</p><p>“Oh, Sevie,” Regulus cooed, curling tightly around Severus, his arms wrapped tightly around his friend, “you’re not ugly. No, stop that. You’re not. Maybe you’re not a traditional beauty, but I think you’re stunning.”</p><p>“Regulus, please, don’t pander to me. I don’t need your pity.”</p><p>“Pander – I’m not pandering to anyone, Severus.” Reggie said with a sigh, sitting up completely. “Look, maybe you were a little rough when you first started school, but how could you not be coming from that house? But you’ve matured so nicely.”</p><p>“Reggie-” Snape started, voice unsure, but Regulus would not be dissuaded. As the two Alphas watched, he pushed the older Omega back until Snape was forced to catch himself on his elbows.</p><p>“Quiet, Sev. My turn to talk.” Regulus leaned forward, running a hand through Snape’s hair. “Your hair’s always been so fine, so baby soft, even before your heat, but now…and with that shampoo Cissy gave you to help with your hair’s…temperament, why…it’s like silk. And your nose-”</p><p>“You leave my nose out of this,” Snape said weakly, shivering as Regulus nuzzled as his prominent nose and chin.</p><p>“Why? It’s a fine nose. So what if it’s a little bigger than most? It’s practically Roman-esque. And it’s a Prince nose; a sign of your noble lineage. A much better heraldic quirk to be known for than incest, I can promise you that. And your grandfather has got one just like it.”</p><p>“It’s crooked.” Snape said quietly, so sad and forlornly, that Sirius felt the foreign feeling of guilt raise its ugly head because Snape’s nose <em>was </em>crooked; because Sirius had broken it just before the Hogwarts Express had pulled into London for the end of a term. Truth be told, the Alpha had never wondered why Snape had let it heal so badly instead of getting it reset. He’d been far too proud of the fact that he’d managed it without getting caught.</p><p>“And I promise that I’ll hold that against my brother in a way that only an Omega can until the end of time.” Regulus said softly, “but that doesn’t detract from the character it gives you. Besides, if it’s anyone’s fault it your beast of a father. Not even taking you to a doctor to get it set or looked at! And once you have a good Alpha you can go and get it straightened again. And anything else you want done. My mother has had a ton of work done.”</p><p>Regulus’ voice was almost cavalier, as if daring the weary looking Snape to disagree with him. It was a look Sirius was all too familiar with; once Reg had an idea in his head it was nigh on impossible to dissuade him of it. So, if he believed Severus Snape was beautiful, then it was so. The problem was that the more his little brother talked, the more Sirius was starting to see it too…It was hard not to, with all of Snape on display like it was. His skin was so pale, paler even then Regulus’ alabaster, and utterly without blemish. His tits were small, barely-there mounds found in all male Omegas, and peaked with pastel, rose-pink nipples that hardened under the breeze. His leg was still propped up, hiding the very last of his modesty from Sirius’ prying eyes, and the Alpha was stunned to find how disappointed he was by that fact.</p><p>“You’re beautiful,” Snape said quickly, almost blurting it out, and the older Omega reached out to brush his fingers across the apple of Regulus’ cheek, “you’re the prettiest one of us here. Potter's a fool not to see it.”</p><p>Sirius’ surprise breath echoed James’ and when he turned to stare at his friend, Sirius found James just as stunned, his eyes wide behind his glasses and his mouth parted in shock. Sirius felt an irrational spear of hatred at the sight – of watching his best friend all put <em>pant </em>over <em>his </em>baby brother…but there was another quieter part that wondered if such a mashup would really be that bad?</p><p>His attention was drawn back to the sitting Omegas (to Severus Snape a part of Sirius’ mind acknowledged disgruntledly) and as he watched Snape carefully finger combed Regulus’ short hair.</p><p>“James has never once looked in my direction, Severus,” Regulus said coolly, “and I don’t need you to tell me he’s more the fool for it.”</p><p>“What have we going on here?” A smooth, amused voice asked and Sirius blinked hard from where he’d been staring blankly at <em>Severus Snape’s </em>nipples to find his elder cousin, Narcissa Black, standing there, both manicured hands on her hips. Naked as the day is long, complete with a neatly trimmed bush <em>and would the day’s horrors never end?</em></p><p>“Cousin Cissy,” Regulus said with a heavy blush, “Severus and I – we were just talking-”</p><p>“About who the King of May may be?” Narcissa asked with a wink. “Exciting isn’t it? Who would have guessed, our own Reggie, the May Queen! You must be all a quiver wondering who your partner is going to be.”</p><p>“It’s been a point of conversation, of course.” Snape said evenly and Sirius felt the same cold dislike run down his spine he felt when it came to all interactions with his family. Everything was always so complicated; everything was always words that weren’t actually being said. He despised it.</p><p>Narcissa reached down, her long pink nails a sharp contrast against the pallor of Snape’s skin as stroked his chin. “My goodness, Severus, the year has been kind to you. You’ve always been so tall, but it seems now that the rest of your body has finally deemed to catch up.”</p><p>“Thank you, Narcissa.” Snape said, his voice colder and more contained than it was just a moment ago, much more like the voice Sirius was used to hearing him speak with and to the Alpha’s surprise he found himself regretting its presence. He wished that soft, calm tenor Snape had been speaking with before would return.</p><p>“Come, the day’s hot. Come swim.”</p><p>“In just a moment, Cissy.” Regulus said, nuzzling into the hand that gently stroked his hair, his expression warm and fond and so utterly <em>fake </em>that it caught Sirius off guard. “Sev’s just put some lotion on me and I don’t want it to wash off just yet.”</p><p>“Ah, of course. We Blacks do tend to burn so.” She leaned down, her breasts swaying with the moment, and pressed a kiss to his brother’s forehead. “I’ll see you both soon, then.”</p><p>She sashayed away, her hips twisting just a bit too much to be natural as she walked, and the two Omegas watched her walk away until she was close to the water’s edge. Regulus let out a moan. “She’s going to kill me if it is Lucius.”</p><p>“Yes.” Snape agreed, only to let out a shout when Regulus’ hands slapped him harshly.</p><p>“You’re not supposed to agree with me!”</p><p>“I will if it’s true.” Snape said with a grim smile. “If the King of May is Lucius and you mate with him, Narcissa and that terrible sister of her are going to make both of our lives <em>hell </em>until we graduate.”</p><p>A heavy silence fell between them, before Regulus interrupted it with a heavy sigh. “Oh, bother. You and your honesty policy, Severus, I swear.” His brother stood, arching in a way that made his rump stick out just <em>so </em>and Sirius looked away with a gag, even as James let out another one of those strangled sounds. “But what am I to do if it is him? Politely say no? Father has already informed me that isn’t an option. It….it’ll be what it is, Sev. And you and I will do what we always do, my dear.”</p><p>He offered a hand for the other Omega, linking their arms as they stood, and to Sirius’ surprise his attention was not held by the sweet, rosy little Omega cock resting between Snape’s legs but on his face – where the most weary, bitter, resigned expression rested. “We survive.”</p><p>Regulus gave him a wink, patting his hand. “Exactly, Sev. Exactly.”</p><p>The two young Alphas climbed back down, both reeling from their discoveries. Peter was waiting for them, anxiously bouncing from foot to foot. “Well? What did you see?”</p><p>James opened his mouth, then shut it wordlessly.</p><p>Sirius could relate.</p>
<hr/><p>The next day found Sirius a bundle of nerves. He tried to stay still, hoping to keep from annoying Euphemia Potter anymore than he already had. Sirius was nude from the waist up, his legs hidden behind a pair of baggy, burnt orange linen pants. They hung loose and wide on his legs, pulled tightly together by the leather straps. From where she was bent over, his best friend’s mother – and more of a mother to Sirius than his own had ever been – was painstakingly painting every inch of his exposed upper body.</p><p>“Sirius,” Euphemia admonished when he shifted again, causing the brush bristles to skate awkwardly across his flesh, “I know its ticklish, but do <em>try </em>to hold still.”</p><p>“Sorry, Mrs. Potter.”</p><p>The greying woman tutted but continued on. Sirius wished that it was the feel of the brush that was making him so twitchy. In reality it was the revelations of the night before that had set him on edge. His baby brother was the May Queen – was going to be exposed, unprotected, for all those grubby Alphas to touch and scent…for Rodolphus Lestrange or Lucius Malfoy to touch. The mere thought alone was enough to make a growl want to tumble from his chest, teeth gritted tight to keep it in. How was he supposed to be okay with this? How was Sirius supposed to be okay with the fact that his little brother – his sweet little Reggie – was about to be paraded about like a cow going to a meat market? It would be different if any part of Regulus had sounded like he was agreeable to the idea, but he couldn’t escape that frightened, forlorn expression on his little brother’s face.</p><p>…nor the one on Snape’s.</p><p>Sirius let out a long breath out of his nose, hands fisting by his side. Euphemia snorted, shaking her head as she pulled away. He thought he heard her mutter <em>‘impatient young bucks’ </em>under her breath and realized with a jolting horror that she thought his tension was due to the chance that he could get laid tonight. Goddess, the mere idea of James’ mother thinking any kind of thoughts along those lines about him made him queasy. Mrs. Potter turned, an ornate looking wooden mask in her hands. It was carved into the vicious snarling face of a wolf, so life-like Sirius felt it could have bit him. Euphemia smiled as she set it in place, a quick sticking charm ensuring it would stay. She stroked Sirius’ face, her expression prideful. “You look stunning, my dear boy. Quite well done on my own part, if I may so.”</p><p>Sirius turned towards a nearby full length mirror, feeling his breath catch in startled surprise. The first thing that struck him was that he looked nothing like himself; he looked older, if possible, and far more savage. His upper body was painted an ashy-brown, the dark foreboding color only interrupted by a blood red stripe that ran up his chest and spun over one shoulder, up the column of his neck and over his jaw and mouth. The upper part of his cheeks, his nose and eyes were painted a deep, dark black, only just visible under the mask. The wolf mask’s mouth was carved wide, allowing his red lips to be free amongst the violently looking carved teeth. His brown eyes seemed utterly black, almost without life from beneath the equally black wooden mask. His hair had been pulled back and high in a rough braid, his thick and coarse locks unwilling to truly be maintained by it and fell free in long, tangled tuffs. When he’d first seen the May Day outfits, Sirius had thought they’d look childish but all together…Sirius looked...primal. As if he could have stepped out of the paintings or tapestry of ancient celebrations.</p><p>He turned to look at Euphemia, mouth opening and closing several times in surprise. “Mrs. Potter…thank you. I know that this is supposed to be a mother’s job and I…I…” But Sirius couldn’t go on, swallowing around a suddenly thick throat.</p><p>Mrs. Potter just smiled, leaning in to give him a careful kiss on the mask’s side. “Be careful tonight, Siri, and do try to have fun-” she winked at him, slipping a potion that Sirius was far too familiar with in his hand, “- but not <em>too </em>much fun.”</p><p>As Sirius stared at the birth control potion, he kind of wished the ground would swallow him up. From in front of him, Euphemia let out a titillated gasp. “Oh <em>Jamie, </em>you look wonderful.”</p><p>Sirius looked up, mouth dropping in shock as his best friend stepped into the tent. He was clad similarly to himself, though his upper body was panted a deep, dark emerald. The green faded off to a deep ochre around his mouth, his upper face hidden by an intricately carved, leafy face. Upon his head rested a bird nest of a crown from which two enormous antlers jutted out. It took Sirius only a handful of moments to connect the leafy mask, the twig crown, before he was snarling and throwing him across the room, ignoring the startled shriek of Mrs. Potter.</p><p>“Sirius, just – wait! Damn’t it all, Siri!” James shouted, forearms straining as he fought to keep a snarling, furious Sirius from connecting with him. Suddenly Sirius was being thrown back by his nape, the strong and undeniable Alpha-presence of Fleamont Potter filling the small tent just before his booming voice started the younger Alpha out of his blind rage.</p><p>“Bullocks! Just what the hell is this all about? It’s a sabbat, you uncultured heathens! Have some respect!”</p><p>“You!” Sirius cried out, finger shaking as he pointed it accusingly at his friend. <em>“You want to fuck my baby brother!”</em></p><p>The silence in the tent was deafening.</p>
<hr/><p>It turns out, Sirius thought sourly from where he stood alongside James, refusing to even glance over at the beseeching Alpha’s form, that James had some sort of ‘good intentions’ about the whole thing. Hah! As if Sirius believed that for a moment. Apparently, James had begged and begged until – like the spoiled brat he was – his father caved and pulled some strings to get him the mantle of the King of May. James swore that he was doing this for Sirius, to protect Regulus. He swore up and down that it had nothing to do with seeing Regulus naked (and how that had made Mrs. Potter turn bright red with fury when she’d realized what they'd peeked at the Omega pool, even as Fleamont simply chuckled and went on about young Alphas being young Alphas. They were currently not speaking) that he wouldn't touch one hair on Regulus' hair.</p><p>Sirius wasn’t buying it.</p><p>Not for one moment.</p><p>And if the only reason why he wasn’t tearing <em>James Potter’s traitorous </em>throat out with his teeth was because…well, to be really frank he was less of an evil than Lucius Malfoy. It was what it was. There was a handful of Alphas in a circle, all age-mates or older, and the tension in the air was intense. A huge bonfire burned behind them, a massive buck made of wicker and stuffed with rabbits and does, precious herbs, vibrant flowers, and ale. James stood in the middle of it all, the attention loving whore, the Alphas spanning out around him a semi-circle. The stiff and unhappy form of who could only be Lucius Malfoy, decked head to toe in greys save for an almost frighteningly bright orange fox max, stood just to Sirius’ left.</p><p>If there was one good thing about tonight, it was that prick was unhappy.</p><p>The Omegas had been led out an hour before, all wearing various prey masks. They were scantily clad, heavily painted like their Alpha counterparts, and despite everything Sirius had felt a strange spike of pride when he caught sight of the May Queen; of Regulus. He was completely white; from the rabbit loin cloth, to the body paint, to the human-esque mask he wore. He had a complicated and heavy looking wreath that nearly hid all his hair, made of almost completely of seasonal blooms, and as he walked – calmly, collected, <em>gracefully </em>– past the leering Alphas, he seemed like some age-old Omega-Queen.</p><p>That was <em>his </em>little brother and Sirius felt his heart swell with pride and regret in equal measures. When this was over…Sirius didn’t know how, but he would try to mend things between them. When he’d left, Reggie had been an awkward preteen and now he was so…so…<em>so. </em>More than before, Sirius was aware of how much time had passed and he felt their separation more acutely than ever. A man moved towards the pyre, bringing a long, curled goat horn to his lips. Sirius tensed, hands curling by his side. In a moment they would be released, a wild group of barely-men, encouraged to hunt through the woods like the animals they’d once been until they found an Omega. Mating was not required, and bond marks (outside of the King of May and his Queen) fiercely discouraged, but as the day had gone on Sirius had come to understand with no small amount of growing horror that it was <em>expected. </em>Beltane was a fertility festival, after all. No one was even expected back until dawn. If it was allowed, Sirius would chase down his own brother and hide him away – but the May Queen belonged only to the King of May and such actions would not fare well. Especially regarding the rumors surrounding the Black family.</p><p>Sirius wanted to protect his brother, not ruin him.</p><p>“If you hurt him,” Sirius said, voice stony, “I’ll kill you.”</p><p>James’ head tilted ever so slightly to the side, the only sign he’d heard.</p><p>And then the horn blew.</p><p>Sirius growled, a feeling of hopeless rage giving him the energy he needed to sprint into the woods.</p>
<hr/><p>A half hour later found Sirius deep in the boughs of the forest, walking at a sedate pace as he struggled not to wonder about what fate had befallen his brother. He’d never forgive James for this. Never. He’d moved deeper into the woods once he stumbled upon one too many rutting pairs, cheeks red despite all his perverted reputation may have said otherwise. At seventeen and nearly the eldest in his grade, Sirius was no stranger to sex. But the thought of participating made his stomach sour. How could he even think of fucking someone when his little brother could be…when Regulus could be…he’d never forgive James Potter for this.</p><p>Sirius perked up when his ears caught the sound of a stream, his mouth dry and his skin itchy from the paint. A quick dip would do him well, maybe help him think past the swirling anger that threatened to turn his vision red. He bypassed a thick grouping of thorny bushes, eyes lighting up at the sign of a clear and fast flowing creek, but froze a second later.</p><p>An Omega was crouched just in front of him, drinking eagerly from the water. His wore a leather loincloth around his waist, one that rode up high as he crouched and gave Sirius a revealing view of thin, lithe thighs and a rather amble bottom. He was painted a deep golden color, silvery white hand prints dotting his body at random, and his hair was pulled in a loose braid decorated with white and yellow flowers. Downwind as he was, Sirius found himself taking a deep inhale before he even processed it.</p><p>The Omega scent was faint, but still tantalizing. Something warm and soft, maybe vanilla, with an almost deep sweetness to it. The Omega sat back on his haunches, wiping at his mouth and Sirius felt a startled breath escape him at the sight of familiar features cast gold before a hare mask fell back into place. At the sound the Omega – Snape – spun around on his feet, his dark eyes blowing wide in panic behind his mask. He started backwards, letting out a startled yelp when his ankle twisted awkwardly and sent him tumbling towards the water.</p><p>Sirius shot forward, catching a flailing wrist before Snape could fall completely. For the moment the pair stared at each other owlishly, the Omega’s body stretched in a strange dip, Sirius’ grip on his wrist and arm around his waist the only thing keeping him on his feet. Snape let out a strangled sound and all at once Sirius had a hellcat in his arms, the smaller figure fighting with everything he had to escape his hands.</p><p>“Will you – just stop a moment.” Sirius said, his voice strained as he fought to keep them both from tumbling into the water. “Hell, just <em>stop, damn’t!”</em></p><p>Sirius could count the times he’d used his Alpha-voice on one hand and it stunned himself into silence to hear it now, a violent snarl that had the Omega in his arms stilling immediately. Snape’s chest was heaving, his entire body trembling in Sirius’ grasp. Unlike what those trash novels of Regulus’ (that Sirius would never admit to reading) the sight filled him with anything but lust. He carefully righted them, keeping the lightest touch on Snape’s forearm until he was sure he was steady on his feet as he took in the frightened Omega’s visage. All he could think in that moment was of Regulus, alone – or not – afraid in the woods, and of that sad conversation between the two the day before. He let out a sigh, shaking his head. “I’m not going to hurt you, alright?”</p><p>Snape stared at him, shoulders hunching slightly as he crossed his arms. Holding himself, Sirius realized, pained. As much as he may not like Snape as a person, there was no part of Sirius that enjoyed this type of fear. No one should have to be afraid of being taken without their permission. The Omega’s eyes dropped. “You scared me.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Sirius said earnestly, quietly, “I didn’t mean to. I just wanted a drink.”</p><p>To prove his point he crouched down, lowering his mouth and taking several much needed drinks of the cool water. When he brought his head up Snape was still there, a pace further away than before. Sirius winced, something inside him feeling dirty at the sight. “I won’t touch you.” He assured quietly, standing slowly, every move telegraphed and on display for the flighty Omega. “I wouldn’t – to anyone – without their permission. I kept running into people, well you know, so I moved deeper.”</p><p>Snape looked away and Sirius wondered mildly if he was blushing underneath that paint. The Alpha felt his brows furrow at the sight of a sharp cut that was crusted with dry blood on Snape’s chin. Without thought he reached out, fingertip gentle as he ghosted over the ridge. The Omega tensed, but surprisingly allowed the touch.</p><p>“I had to run,” Snape explained to Sirius' questioning sound, voice a whisper, his small frame shivering despite the May heat. “An Alpha found me, the one in the Bear mask. He…wasn’t interested in just a drink.”</p><p>Sirius felt his lips pull up in an ugly snarl. One of the Lestrange brothers then, bears were on their family crest and they were all about that imagery. Sirius felt it suited the brutish family well. The rules of the Chase meant that everything was supposed to be with consent, but with no one in the woods to enforce them, it meant as little as the paper they were written on and the Lestrange family already had a rather notorious reputation. It seems his brother was right to be afraid of them. The idea made that kernel of rage flare brightly again, eyes growing dark and stormy at the thought of what could have happened as he mindlessly ran his thumb over the torn skin. The Lestrange brothers were the worst type; they still had a year left of school. Maybe Sirius could arrange an <em>accident. </em></p><p>The Omega was growing tenser under his touch and all at once Sirius came back to himself, aware that he’d been silently crowding Snape’s space, eyes locked on the place where the cut touched Snape’s lips. Sirius swallowed, that strange sweetly-heavy Omega scent so much stronger up close that it chased every breath, making him light headed.</p><p>This was <em>Snape.</em></p><p>What was wrong with him?</p><p>He let his hand drop, but strangely couldn’t bring himself to step back. Snape watched him wearily, bottom lip disappearing behind white teeth as he nibbled nervously at it. Sirius felt his eyes drawn to the action, hands flexing by his side. “You can stay with me, if you like.” He said suddenly, startling himself with it. Snape’s eyes blew wide in alarm, taking an unsteady backwards. “Not like that.” Sirius corrected quickly and the Alpha swallowed uncertainly, unsure of his words even as he spoke them, “we could just sit until it’s time to go back. Together. But not – not <em>together </em>together.”</p><p>Gods, what was wrong with him? When would this mouth vomit end?</p><p>Snape was quite for a moment. “Just…sitting?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Sirius was quick to agree, nodding fiercely. “If you’re with me, you won’t have to worry about running from anyone. I wouldn’t let anyone take you.”</p><p>That, at least, Sirius was sure of. The entire encounter had been almost otherworldly. He was standing on Beltane, hidden in the deep darkness of the woods and covered in body paint like a foreign skin, promising to protect <em>Severus Snape. </em>But he knew (at least in that moment) he meant it. Snape debated, emotions flashing across his eyes so clearly that Sirius marveled at it. Was Snape always like this? Had he always been so easy to read? How had he not noticed that before? The Omega gave a small nod.</p><p>“Just sitting.”</p><p>“Just sitting.”</p><p>They settled against an oversized rock that jolted out into the stream, letting their feet dangle in the cool water. A strangely comfortable silence fell between them and for the first time that night, Sirius did not get lost in his fears for Regulus’ virtue or his anger at James. Instead he was hyper aware of the sweet-smelling Omega at his side, of the soft breaths and occasional sighs he let out as they watched fireflies dance about the stream. After a few moments Sirius dared to stretch out, letting one arm rest behind – but not touching – Snape’s form as he leaned back on his hands. The Omega glanced at him for a moment before going back to watching the warm-light of the fireflies.</p><p>Sirius was unsure how much time passed like that, maybe an hour or more, when there was a sudden weight against his arm. His mouth parted in surprise as he gawked at the sight of Snape completely asleep. His head rested against Sirius’ shoulder, his mask an uncomfortable but bearable pressure against his skin. Thin, pale lips were parted just so, his face lax and gentle with sleep in a way he’d never seen before. Snape had been growing more and more relaxed the longer the night went on, but Sirius hadn’t expected…</p><p>But then again, unlike himself, Snape had no idea who he’d been sitting next to. Sirius was sure had he known, he’d never let Sirius come near him. That idea didn’t fill the Alpha with nearly as much glee as it used to. He let out a long breath, hand rising from the rock hesitantly before moving closer, securing the limp Omega more against his side. Sirius shifted his weight further onto his unoccupied hand and settled in for a long – and odd – night.</p><p>It wasn't nearly as much as a burden as he would have liked to think. Snape was warm against him, his chest rising and falling in an even, queerly hypnotizing rhythm. His scent was everywhere, inescapable, and eventually the confused Alpha gave in, tilting his head just enough that he could rest it against surprisingly soft hair and inhaled deeply. Snape let out a quiet sigh at the move, his head rolling further against Sirius’ arm and exposing the unblemished length of his neck to the Alpha.</p><p>Sirius took a harsh breath, half-lidded eyes tracing the vulnerable flesh. A sound startled him, his head snapping forward, lips pulling from his teeth in a violent growl that made his chest tremble at the sight of another Alpha watching them from across the stream. The Alpha – tall and well-muscled, his features hidden behind a grey boar mask – tilted his head to side in thought and made a move as if to step forward. Sirius’ hand flew up, wrapping protectively around Snape’s nape, curling the unaware, slumbering Omega further into his side, every muscle in his body tense.</p><p>But the Boar masked Alpha only tipped his head in a nod and retreated the way he came.</p><p>Sirius sat taut and aware, ready to flee with the Omega in a moment’s notice if need be, until he could no longer hear the Alpha’s heavy tread and then some. Next to him, Snape let out a disgruntled sound, nothing more than a breathy whimper, picking up on Sirius' anxiety even in his sleep. Sirius relaxed at once, hushing him as his fingers lessening their grip in Snape’s hair into something more of a hold, and returned to his silent vigil.     </p>
