    <p>"Oh come on, Credence! It'll be so much fun!" squeals Queenie, already half dragging him towards the door. Credence only manages to extricate himself from her grip with rather a lot of difficulty. "It's going to be an absolute disaster!" he complains, but he is quicky beginning to feel the excitement building. Ice skating was something he'd always wanted to try as a child, although he would never have dared ask Mary Lou to take him.</p>
<p>Jacob's smiling face appears in the doorway. "You won't be as bad as me, Credence, and you know Newt will only move away from the side if Tina drags him" This is very true - stories of Newt's absolute inability to ice skate have been common at every drunk storytelling session they've had. Credence is almost looking forward to seeing it. </p>
<p>He allows himself to be pulled from his apartment after grabbing a jacket, and follows Queenie and Jacob outside to their car, where Newt and Tina are already waiting. It's a bit of a squeeze on the back seat, but eventually they are off, all chattering excitedly. Tina goes ice skating often, when she can find the time during her police shifts, and they make her promise not to laugh too much.</p>
<p>"We may see Percival, when we're there. Now he's brilliant to watch - I'm not sure how he does it" she says. They have all heard lots about Percival Graves, her former boss. All Credence has gleaned is that he left his job after an undisclosed incident a year ago, and now spends most of his time at the local ice rink, if Tina's stories are anything to go by.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, he steps out of the car into the afternoon sun. It's that kind of weather where the wind is biting in the shade, but quite pleasant in the sunlight, and he relishes it after the icy chill of the last few weeks. Ahead of him, Queenie and Jacob are giggling loudly together, and Newt is whispering something in Tina's ear, a smile on both their faces. Credence feels a pang of longing for something like that of his own, but quickly squashes it. He has never been in a real relationship, and Mary Lou's dubious care has instilled in him a slight discomfort at the idea of being with another man, no matter how much acceptance he sees - or how much he desires it. </p>
<p>Queenie calls him over to join their conversation, and he puts the thought out of his mind. </p>
<p>Entering the ice rink, he is hit by a wave of cool air and the rush of voices. Behind the glass, the ice is incredibly smooth, shining under the bright lights. It's rather intimidating. Tina points them in the direction of the hire desk, and five minutes later they are all standing (some more confidently than others) a few metres back from the crowds around the just-opened doors. There must be at least a a hundred and fifty other people here, pushing to get onto the ice with varying degrees of patience. </p>
<p>Tina looks towards the crowd. "I don't know if you'll get to see Percival, actually. He prefers the quieter sessions". Credence nudges her. </p>
<p>"If you're not careful, Newt might start getting jealous".</p>
<p>"Oh shush, you" she replies, as Newt turns round with an enquiring look. They both smile innocently. </p>
<p>Once the crowd have all pushed their way onto the ice, the five of them step forward. Looking out at everyone else, there is a wide range of ability. About half cling to the wall, while others stumble and slide their way around without help. Still others glide more confidently, weaving in and out of the crowds of people. Tina steps easily onto the ice, turning to face them. Newt goes next, holding tight to the edge of the glass and then grabbing the wall. Queenie and Jacob step out hand in hand, choosing the brave route, and immediately wobble and slip over. They laugh as they brush themselves off, clinging to eachother as they make their way to the wall. </p>
<p>Tina beckons him forward, and he copies Newt, taking a firm hold of the edge before placing his skate onto the ice. It immediately slips out from under him, and he is suddenly very grateful for his death grip on the wall. Tina steadies him, and he finally gets both skates onto the ice. He looks towards Newt, who is determinedly and very, very slowly pulling himself forwards. When Credence does the same, he is surprised at how smoothly the blades glide over the glassy surface. </p>
<p>Ten minutes later, he decides that he's had enough of being stuck behind Newt, who has not picked up any speed whatsoever.   After looking carefully at how Tina moves, pushing and gliding, he digs in his right skate and pushes off onto his left foot. </p>
<p>He ends up almost doing the splits as his left foot races forwards and his right drags over the ice. Queenie and Jacob wobble to a stop near him and help him up, and for a while they move arm in arm, slowly but surely gaining some balance. They watch Newt stubbornly refusing Tina's attempts to pull him away from the wall, laughing and chatting. It's fun, and exciting, and relaxing, and overall a wonderful experience. He can imagine the child he used to be screaming in joy. </p>
<p>------</p>
<p>An hour later, the number of people on the ice has thinned to around a hundred. Credence can drift around the ice rink with slightly more confidence, and they have succeeded in getting Newt away from the wall, where he now clings to Tina instead. </p>
<p>He takes a moment to look around and see how Jacob and Queenie are doing. They are still gliding round together, and he is sure neither of them has yet let go of the others' hand. Something behind them catches his eye. There is a man, standing in the shadows beyond the ice rink, watching them. The man is almost completely still, only his gaze moving from person to person. They make eye contact for only a second, before the man snaps his gaze away, turning and retreating through a doorway. </p>
<p>Tina grabs his hand as they go past, pulling him more into the centre. For a while, she guides both him and Newt as they move more quickly around the ice, trying not to hit anyone. Newt is not completely successful and manages to knock an elderly man off balance, then falls over himself. They all offer embarrassed apologies and lift Newt back onto his feet. Credence forgets about the man in the shadows, and simply enjoys the time with his friends. </p>
<p>When they finally step off the ice, Credence is flushed and sweating, and his feet ache inside the skates. He's never been more happy. </p>
<p>They sit down on the crowded benches to remove their skates. With a start, Credence realises he is opposite the man from earlier, who is doing up the laces of his own skates. His hair is dark brown, with silver in the short sides, and he is wearing only a t-shirt and jeans against the chill. There is a thin scar about a finger long cutting through his left eyebrow, looking as if it narrowly missed his eye. The man does not look up until Tina says "Oh hello, Percival. I haven't seen you in a while. It's these terribly long shifts, and overtime out of nowhere, as you know" </p>
<p>The man- Percival - only nods once, barely making eye contact with Tina. She appears unperturbed, however, and continues talking. "I managed to convince this lot to come down with me, and I think they've quite enjoyed it". Credence, Queenie and Jacob all affirm this enthusiastically, while Newt grimaces slightly. Percival only nods again, silent. Tina still does not seem to think this is in any way strange, and says goodbye to Percival as she collects their skates and heads over to the skate return. </p>
<p>They all file out of the building into the much warmer evening, talking happily. It is not until they are in the car that Newt remarks "Rather a quiet man, wasn't he? I can't say that's what I expected from the stories you've told"</p>
<p>Tina is slow to reply. " He's just...after- well, what happened to him took a toll. He's still a brilliant man, just... different. Quiet, and withdrawn. For the first few months, he wouldn't speak at all. At least now I get the occasional sentence or two, on a good day". </p>
<p>Credence is left to ponder this as the conversation moves on, while the memory of those dark eyes stays with him.</p>
