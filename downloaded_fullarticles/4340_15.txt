  <strong>A Novice Novelist</strong>
</p><p>Hermione was unprepared for how emotional she felt getting off the Hogwarts Express without her friends. Ginny was babbling enthusiastically about embarking on her last year at school – even if it meant that she and Harry would see each other less frequently – but Hermione had never missed Harry and Ron more than at that moment. At the end of the war, the wizarding world had heralded the three of them as heroes for a new age and the job offers had come flowing in. At the end of the summer, and after having been exempted from needing to sit their NEWTs, the boys enrolled in auror training. A similar waver had been extended to her as well, and there were several tempting positions with the new Ministry, but she turned them all down, preferring to go back to school and finish her education – she needed proper qualifications if she wasn’t going to trade on her fame for the rest of her life.</p><p>Professor McGonagall was now headmistress and had made special arrangements for her return. She would have one-on-one tutorials in her examination subjects with individual professors with one notable exception – the potions master would make no allowances for her and she would have to attend his seventh-year potions classes. There was one other concession. In respect of her age and status, her mentor had thoughtfully arranged for her to have a single room with its own bath, and for this she was especially grateful. She was well over a year older than the current seventh-year students, and it felt even more than that, given the vast differences in their experiences, so the privacy would be most welcome.</p><p>It didn’t take her long to empty her trunk, but she still had to hurry and change into her uniform or she would be late for the sorting of new students. And that’s when she got a tangible understanding of just how much things really <em>had</em> changed. She hadn’t worn her uniform in nearly a year-and-a-half – it had been tight then – and now she found that the skirt wouldn’t close and the shirt buttons were dangerously strained. She wasn’t a girl anymore, and she had a woman’s curves to prove it. All she could do was wear her robe on top of some dark colored Muggle clothes – the gown was snug at the shoulders and too short, but that’s all she had. She briefly thought of transfiguring them, but experience had taught her not to waste her magical energies foolishly – with a long and tiring evening before her, she didn’t want to drain herself merely for the sake of some clothes.</p><p>Finally changed but now officially late, she hurried down to the Room of Requirement, which was serving as the dining hall and central meeting point until the Great Hall was repaired. Rounding the last turn in the corridor, she ran full on into her potions professor with a resounding <em>oomph</em>. She stumbled backwards and fell ungracefully on her backside. She stared up into his perturbed face as coal black eyes raked up and down her sprawled figure.  </p><p>In the dim and flickering light of the corridor she looked much the same as when he had last had any significant contact with her, which was that horrible night a year past, the night of Dumbledore’s death. Bile rose in his throat at being reminded of it so suddenly and vividly by the third member of the Golden Trio – she was ever the over-achiever, annoying him even before the Welcoming Feast had begun. He swallowed hard. “Ten points from Gryffindor for being out of uniform – and another ten for being <em>late</em>, Miss Granger,” he sneered as he stepped over her prone body, the bottom of his long robes dragging across her as he continued on down the hallway. Maybe he could get a house elf to put wine – or better yet, whiskey – in his dinner goblet instead of the always undrinkable pumpkin juice.  </p><p>“Lovely to see you, too, professor, and looking so well,” she muttered inaudibly. “No, no, I can manage,” she continued, struggling to her feet and rubbing her bum.</p><p>She slipped quietly into the back of the room and took a seat at the end of the Gryffindor table, trying to ignore the curious looks that were being sent in her direction. She smiled wanly at her fellow students, uncertain if they were staring because of her status or unusual attire. Someone called her name halfway up the table, and when she turned to see who it was, Ginny Weasley enthusiastically beckoned to her. Hermione smiled congenially but otherwise waved her off – it was going to be hard enough to get through the meal without having to make idle chit chat with Ginny’s friends.</p><p>Looking beyond her friend, she saw her head of house and potions professor come in from a side entrance at the front of the room. With his expression as inscrutable as ever, he took his usual seat while the new headmistress settled the Sorting Hat on its stool and then stepped to the lectern. Her welcoming speech was as upbeat as she could make it – expressing the hope that students would always be mindful of the many sacrifices that had been made on their behalf in the recent war and exuding optimism about the future. But with the memories bearing down upon her – from her own school days as well as the war – Hermione could not dispel the melancholy of the moment. She kept her head down until the headmistress was finished, at which point the dinner appeared to loud cheers.    </p><p>During the meal, Hermione let her thoughts drift as the students around her discussed various professors and speculated about what their classes would be like that year, but her attention was caught when they turned to the subject of potions. The general consensus was that Professor Snape was a first class prick, but also an exceptionally knowledgeable prick who was never – <em>ever</em> – be challenged or crossed. The conversation unsurprisingly transitioned to what he had done during the war, and several students expressed doubts that he had ever actually been on Dumbledore’s side – one even had the temerity to suggest that it would have been better if he had died in the Shrieking Shack like he was supposed to.</p><p>Hermione dropped her fork loudly on her plate and turned to glare at them – having kept to herself, they had quite forgotten that she was there.</p><p>“How dare you, how bloody <em>dare </em>you impugn the unstinting loyalty and <em>extraordinary</em> bravery of one of the finest professors this school has ever seen!” she seethed. “If it weren’t for him the whole lot of you – <em>and</em> your families – would now be bowing and scraping before Voldemort, <em>begging</em> to be allowed to kiss his scaly foot, you craven know-nothing little toads!”</p><p>They stared at her open mouthed as she continued to tick them off. “While you were all home with <em>mum and dad</em> – safely tucked up in your beds having your <em>cocoa</em>,” she sneered, “that man was risking his <em>life</em> to save your sorry arses – and the rest of the wizarding world to boot. What stinking ungrateful hypocritical warthogs you all are!”</p><p>As her voice grew louder, a wave of silence worked its way up the Gryffindor table and heads started to turn in her direction. He was the first to notice that something was wrong – as usual – followed by his senior colleague. The headmistress had seen that look on her student’s face before, and knew she needed to intervene quickly or more than words would soon be exchanged. She dabbed at her mouth and laid down her napkin as she pushed her chair away from the table.</p><p>“Need help, Minerva?” he jeered as she passed behind him.</p><p>“It’s fine, Severus – it’s <em>my </em>house and I will handle it,” she replied gruffly.</p><p>By now, everyone had noticed that something was up, and interested faces followed the headmistress as she made her way to the back of the room.</p><p>She stopped directly in front of her protégé and looked at her sternly across the table. “Is there something wrong, Miss Granger?” she asked as her gaze shifted critically to the students sitting around her.</p><p>Hermione suddenly realized that the entire room had gone quiet.</p><p>“No, professor,” she responded, suitably chastened.</p><p>“Good, because we wouldn’t want anything to disrupt what should be happy celebration – <em>would we?</em>” she asked expectantly, her gaze piercing Hermione and her immediate dinner companions. There was a quick chorus of “No, professor.” Minerva frowned at them and was about to turn away but caught herself. She looked again at her star student, who blushed and self-consciously tried to pull her ill-fitting robe closed – it barely met in the middle.</p><p>“Please see me after dinner, if you would, Miss Granger,” she sighed before turning on her heel and walking back to the head table.</p><p>The students involved cast angry and accusatory looks in Hermione’s direction, which she returned with haughty disdain. She wasn’t afraid of them, she wasn’t afraid of <em>anyone</em> anymore, not after having survived the worst war the wizarding world had ever seen. Nor was she desperate to make friends, as she had been when she first started at Hogwarts as an eleven year old. They could just sod off as far as she was concerned, and she straightened her back and continued with her dinner with the composure of someone who fought on principle and knew she was right.</p><p>“Five minutes into the new term and your students are already misbehaving, headmistress?” he mocked as she rejoined he colleagues at the table.</p><p>She wanted to tell him he had some nerve asking that question, but bit her tongue. She had extended considerable forbearance to him the past few months after learning his true role in the war, and he was slowly coming around in spite of himself – she wasn’t going to jeopardize that progress, but it irked her nevertheless.</p><p>“What were they arguing about?” Flitwick asked as she retook her seat.</p><p>“They didn’t say,” she replied tersely, shaking out her napkin and returning it to her lap. They might not have said, but she knew <em>precisely</em> what they had been fighting about, and was fairly certain that the man at the end of the table <em>also</em> knew. To his consternation, Hermione had defended him loudly and publicly to any who would listen to her in the days following the end of the war – it was one of the reasons why <em>The Prophet</em> no longer sought her out for interviews. He had complained bitterly to Minerva that he didn’t need a <em>schoolgirl</em> spearheading his defense, but he had done so in barely a whisper from his bed in the infirmary at the time. He would have bled to death on the floor of the Shrieking Shack if not for that schoolgirl, although Hermione had insisted he never be told that – she didn’t want him to owe anyone anything anymore. Under the circumstances, he had some nerve indeed.</p><p>The rest of the evening proceeded without further interruptions and the new intake of students were sorted and everyone eventually sent off to bed. Hermione stayed behind as instructed and waited patiently and a bit self-consciously as the headmistress had a few words with the ever irascible potions master, who didn’t even so much as glance at her when they were finished.</p><p>“Do you want to tell me what happened this evening?” her head of house inquired, finally turning to address her.</p><p>Hermione debated how to respond. The headmistress might want to know if one of her staff was being disparaged, but on the other hand, she wasn’t a snitch and was entirely certain that her potions professor was more than capable of dealing with a handful of ignorant, snotty-nose, self-righteous students.</p><p>“No, professor,” she responded resignedly.</p><p>“Well, if you don’t want to tell me what you were arguing about, perhaps you <em>would</em> be so kind as to inform me why you aren’t in uniform?”</p><p>“Nothing fits anymore except my tie,” she commented, extending her arms to demonstrate her point – the sleeves of her gown now hit above her wrists. “I didn’t want to expend the energy transfiguring them, so I sat at the back of the room. Professor Snape has already deducted points,” she mumbled, “and for being late because of it,” she hastily added.</p><p>“Yes, I’m sure he <em>has</em>,” Minerva commented, almost under her breath. “We’ve talked about this already, but let me make the offer once more. I can wave the uniform requirement if you want, just wear something discrete under some robes that fit you properly.”</p><p>“I appreciate that, professor, really I do, but I don’t want to stand out,” she gently explained.</p><p>“Very well,” Minerva replied, fully understanding her student’s position after all of the attention she had received immediately following the war. “We have a cupboard full of second-hand uniforms you can look through. We had better do it tonight, though, or Professor Snape will deduct more house points at breakfast.”</p><p>She picked up the Sorting Hat and led the way to a storage room next to her office – it was full of uniforms of every variety, some of which looked like they dated back to the sixteenth-century.</p><p>“Start looking through these,” she gestured, “I need to put the Sorting Hat to bed – it gets very cranky after an evening’s work.”</p><p>“I do <em>not</em>!” the Hat sputtered grumpily.</p><p>Hermione ran her hand along the hangers, finally stopping and pulling out a faded yellow garment from the Elizabethan era. She held it up to herself just as the headmistress returned.    </p><p>“I don’t suppose I could wear this one?” she asked cheekily as she fingered the ornate ruff.</p><p>“Only if you want to wear the colors of Hufflepuff,” her mentor replied with a smirk.</p><p>“I think I’ll pass,” Hermione giggled, putting it back.</p><p>They continued to go through the antique uniforms, commenting on each generation’s incarnation, until the headmistress paused at one from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. Running a hand down its front, she slipped if off the hanger and held it up to Hermione. It was a Gryffindor uniform, in mostly red and gold.</p><p>“You wouldn’t have been able to wear this a year ago,” she observed, “but you certainly could now – you’d look quite good in it, too.” She then searched for and found the Edwardian corset that went with it. Hermione looked at it in dismay.</p><p>“How on earth were students supposed to sit and work at their desks all day in <em>this</em>?” she asked disapprovingly, fingering the boned garment. “You certainly wouldn’t have been able to play Quidditch, and I doubt you could have ridden a broom, either.”</p><p>Minerva smiled indulgently. “They were very different times, my dear,” she said affectionately. “Witches were expected to as decorous as their Muggle counterparts back then – they weren’t allowed to slouch <em>or</em> play Quidditch.”</p><p>“Well that’s good, because they certainly wouldn’t have been able to,” Hermione interjected acerbically.</p><p>“And as for brooms,” her mentor continued, “only the loosest witches dared to sit astride a broom.”</p><p>“How did they . . . .”</p><p>“Sideways,” she interjected, “with one leg laid over the front of the broom – I think the closest term would be <em>sidesaddle</em>.”</p><p>“That sounds pretty dangerous,” Hermione observed.</p><p>“Oh it <em>was</em>, but it meant that the few witches who <em>did</em> ride brooms were among the most accomplished fliers around.” She smiled. “I was taught to fly that way as a young girl,” she said nostalgically.</p><p>Hermione stared at her head of house in admiration and briefly wondered how old she might actually be, but the moment passed quickly, and Minerva put the clothes back, moving on to the modern uniforms. Going through them, however, it became clear that they were all simply too small to fit.  </p><p>“The fact of the matter is,” she observed, “these are for girls, and you’re a woman, now. We’ll have to think of something else.”</p><p>“Well, I really don’t want to buy anything that I’m only going to wear for a few months,” Hermione replied, going from one hanger to the next. “How about this?” she asked, pulling out a white shirt.</p><p>“That’s a boy’s shirt,” Minerva said dismissively.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“It’s not going to fit very well,” she commented, pinning it to Hermione’s shoulders – it was indeed a bit big.</p><p>“It’s going to be hidden under a robe anyway – who’s going to know?”</p><p>She had a fair point, so they went through the boys’ uniforms and found three shirts and two pairs of slacks.</p><p>“I don’t much care for female students in trousers, but I think we can make an exception. As for robes, you can wear my old teaching gown – it ought to fit, and we can attach Gryffindor colors to it without too much trouble, I think.”</p><p>Suitably kitted out, the headmistress locked the storage room. “I haven’t gone through that cupboard in years,” she said, smiling indulgently at Hermione. “Who says we’re too old to play dress up,” she whispered conspiratorially, as Hermione grinned. “Now off to bed with you,” her mentor gently chided.</p><p>Hermione was still smiling when she turned a corner and again ran straight into her potions professor, not so hard as to bounce off and fall on her arse this time but her face was uncomfortably squashed against his coat.</p><p>Looking down at her, he knitted his brow and puffed impatiently. “Is this the way the term is going to proceed, Miss Granger? Hurtling into me at every opportunity like a bludger?”</p><p>“Sorry, professor,” she replied contritely, backing away and rubbing her nose.</p><p>He looked pointedly at the clothes in her arms.</p><p>“Professor McGonagall is lending me these for the year,” she quickly explained, hoping she wasn’t about lose yet more points and acquire a detention as well.</p><p>He continued to stare at her disapprovingly for a few moments more, frowning the whole time. “Very well, Miss Granger. Get to your room,” he scowled as he brushed past her, continuing on his rounds without giving her a second look. She sighed exasperatedly and tried to concentrate on the reasons why she had defended him at dinner.</p><p>No one commented directly on Hermione’s hodgepodge uniform, although her unflattering baggy trousers did attract a few snickers. Still, no one seemed to object to the lenience that was being extended to her, and she quickly, quietly, and without further fuss settled into her school work. Talking to her professors in one-on-one tutorials was stimulating even if the material they were covering wasn’t especially challenging, but after a couple of weeks of this regimen, she felt rather . . . well, <em>bored</em>, she reluctantly had to admit. She found herself missing the drama and adventure that had always been part and parcel of her earlier school days with Harry and Ron. She had been looking forward to spending as much time as she wanted on her classes without those kinds of interruptions, but instead found that she often had huge chunks of time on her hands. She supposed she could sit her NEWTs and be done with it all, but having committed herself, she wanted to stick with it – she was no quitter. Besides, she was filling some of that free time by tutoring Ginny, even if her friend was proving to be rather unreliable when it came to their agreed meeting times.</p><p>“I know, I know,” Ginny said breathlessly as she rushed into the dining room one afternoon and threw her knapsack down on the bench.</p><p>“You’re late,” Hermione commented anyway, “<em>and</em> you’ve missed lunch.”</p><p>“I just got finished with Professor McGonagall’s class. Rory Stuben transfigured me into a badger and had trouble reversing the spell. It took McGonagall until just now to transform me back,” she explained, clearly annoyed.</p><p>“Well, eat this,” Hermione replied, offering her the untouched sandwich on her plate, “and take some fruit for later.” As Ginny stood at her shoulder and tucked in, Hermione opened her friend’s book bag, which was already quite full. She took out two books and a magazine to make some room, but when she saw the weekly publication, she paused, holding it away from her as if it was contaminated.    </p><p>“<em>Witches Only?</em>” she barked in shocked surprise. “You read <em>Witches Only</em>?” she asked incredulously.</p><p>“Yeah, so?” Ginny mumbled.</p><p>“Ginny, no self-respecting witch reads that rag!” she exclaimed.</p><p>“Oh, <em>please</em>,” her friend choked out between bites.</p><p>“These things have absolutely <em>no</em> literary merit <em>whatsoever</em>!”</p><p>Ginny carried on eating as if she hadn’t heard her.</p><p>“They lack coherent plots and are <em>entirely</em> formulaic – stereotypically dark but brave and daring wizards,” she said scathingly, “beautiful but flighty witches who need <em>constant</em> rescuing, and cardboard supporting characters.”</p><p>Ginny snorted her disdain of her friend’s critique and looked away.</p><p>“Ginny, stories like these and the magazines that publish them undermine the confidence of young witches,” she went on, exasperatedly.</p><p>Her friend rolled her eyes.</p><p>Hermione continued undaunted. “The female characters in these stories are unable to protect themselves – <em>despite</em> being magical – and would almost certainly succumb to some horrible fate if the hero wasn’t around to make sure they didn’t enter dark and seemingly deserted manor houses alone, accept drinks or broom rides from strange wizards, or just go off generally on their own after having been specifically told <em>not</em> to do so. The only reasons these magazines sell,” she finished, lowering her voice, “is because of the sex.”</p><p>“What’s wrong with that?” Ginny smirked, refusing to be embarrassed.</p><p>“They put unrealistic notions into the heads of naïve young women,” she replied sharply.</p><p>“Have you read one?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I asked, have you ever actually read one of these?” Ginny asked, nodding at the magazine in question.</p><p>“Well, no,” she hemmed and hawed, “but . . . .”</p><p>Ginny cut her off. “I’ve got to run to Arithmancy,” she announced, dusting the crumbs from her clothes and stuffing the books and fruit into her bag. Hermione held out the magazine for her to put away.</p><p>“You keep it for a while,” she said, closing up the satchel and pulling it on to her shoulder. “It’ll certainly be more fun – and probably a <em>lot</em> more instructive – than <em>that</em>,” she said, wrinkling her nose at the potions book lying face down in front of her friend.</p><p>Hermione grimaced at the magazine in her hand as Ginny headed out, followed by the rest of the students who had dawdled with their lunch. She gathered her own books and parchments and headed to the library. She saw her potions professor reprimanding a student who had the misfortune of being caught in the hall after the bell had tolled and managed to scurry into the library without attracting his attention.</p><p>She quickly settled into what she was coming to think of as <em>her</em> corner. The table was really only big enough for one person to use, especially if that person spread out their work, as she typically did. She put her potions textbook on the reading stand, laid out a piece of blank parchment, and set to work. Ten minutes later and she found she had reread the same page five times and <em>still</em> couldn’t remember a single thing about it. Unable to curb her curiosity, she finally pulled out the magazine and, checking to make sure no one was watching her, hid it within the larger, open potions book. Resting her elbows on the table with her chin in her hands, she started to snort her way through the material.</p><p>Although it was the nineteenth installment of an ongoing story, there was a brief recap of the plot up to that point, not that she felt she had gained anything by reading it. The story was <em>exactly</em> what she expected it to be – utter <em>rubbish</em>. The female figure was a leggy, auburn haired – definitely <em>not</em> ginger – bimbo with boobs, but their idea of a dark wizard actually made her laugh out loud, to the disapproval of Madam Pince, who shushed her from across the reading room. <em>Dark wizard?</em> She could give them a dark wizard that would make their puny-arsed specimen curl up in the fetal position and cry for his mum.</p><p>When she finished reading, she slapped the magazine face down on the table in disgust – her kneazle could write something better than that – and resumed her work, her <em>real</em> work. But another ten minutes went by and she still hadn’t turned a page what for thinking about the story. The sex scene between the main characters was, she had to admit, rather . . . <em>arousing</em>, even if it was full of tautologies – just how many synonyms <em>were</em> there for <em>penis</em>, <em>clitoris</em>, and <em>natural lubrication</em>? And the ludicrous adjectives used to describe orgasms put Professor Sprout’s floral greenhouse to shame. She started to conjure various scenes and scenarios in her mind, piecing them together with witty dialogue, until she finally gave up on her book and started to jot down some thoughts on the still blank parchment in front of her. And then an idea struck her – a rather sneaky, daring, and rather exciting idea that might accomplish what she had set out to do only a few months before but had met so far with only limited success.  </p><p>She had always understood that the first rule of fiction was writing about what you knew, and what she knew – intimately, in fact – was the recent war, which had been peopled by the most incredible figures she had ever known. After some deliberation, she decided to keep to the general formula of such stories, at least to some extent, but with some marked deviations. She envisioned a spy thriller with a certain thinly disguised and highly masculine wizard at its center. Rather than being predictably moneyed, aristocratic, and respected by all, <em>her</em> character would be poor, misunderstood, and very – <em>very</em> – dark. She had no truck with unrealistically bold, adventurous, and action-minded heroes – oh no, hers would be disciplined, calculating, and meticulous in his strategy. He would hide behind a mask, move in the shadows, and dissemble obsequiously. Only when forced would he draw his wand, and then he would have no match – his bravery then would be breathtakingly audacious.</p><p>She imagined him paired with a young, conventionally beautiful but entirely <em>capable</em> witch who occasionally came to <em>his</em> rescue by applying her brilliant mind to the difficulties they faced. She would be a formidable force in her own right, and while they would initially clash – in part because he seemingly could not move beyond a long lost and unrequited love – mutual distain would transition into respect, evolve into admiration, and finally ripen into passionate love, all against the backdrop of political turmoil that would have the potential to tear them apart, literally and metaphorically.</p><p>They would both work for the Ministry of Magic, she decided, he as a potions master for the Department of Magical Health, and she as a professor with the Office for Magical Education. They would also be members of a secret Inner Circle collaborating with the Minister for Magic, who would be facing a long-standing political opponent. That rival would be working to see them and their friends and colleagues dead. He would have already killed two of their number – the woman their spy had secretly loved and her husband. Revenge and redemption would be the spy’s principle motivations for becoming a double agent.  </p><p>Hermione scribbled away the afternoon, completely fired up at the possibilities of rehabilitating her professor’s reputation by way of a piece of fiction, building sympathy and support from a previously disparaging public for the man who had in fact saved the wizarding world from unimaginable darkness. It was only when Madam Pince told her that she wanted to lock up in order to go to dinner that she reluctantly put away her parchment and quill – it had been the most satisfying four hours she could ever remember spending in the library, which was saying something. She handed the magazine back to Ginny without comment – her friend gave her a maddeningly knowing smirk – and spent the entire meal thinking about how she wanted to proceed. She stayed up late and finally finished the chapter in the early hours of the morning. She felt a bit sleep-deprived throughout the day, but was otherwise thoroughly invigorated intellectually by her project – it was the only thing she could think of during her tutorial with Flitwick, who seemed not to notice her inattention.</p><p>By the end of the week, she had three chapters under her belt – the principle and some of the secondary characters had been introduced and the early stages of the plot laid out. On a lark, and using an owl from the Hogsmeade postal service to hide her identity, she sent the chapters – along with a prospectus for more – off to <em>Witches Only</em> under the assumed name of J. H. Bailiff. Over the weekend, she continued to develop the plot and flesh out her characters, and when she sneaked off to Hogsmeade during lunch on Monday, a letter from the editor was waiting for her.</p><p>Since she didn’t have permission to be away from school, she didn’t linger in the street where someone might notice her, but headed straight back to school, reading as she went. She could barely contain her glee. The letter informed her that war stories were exceedingly popular at the moment and the magazine simply couldn’t get enough of them. They were prepared to postpone a handful of stories already in the queue and publish her work after the current romance finished its run at the beginning of October. Based on her proposal, the editor suggested a completed story of around twenty chapters to be published weekly, for which they would pay her five-hundred galleons in compensation. She was completely gobsmacked – the most she had ever made was £1,000 working as a receptionist for her dentist parents one summer, and this was more than <em>twice</em> that figure. If she was agreeable to the terms, all she had to do was sign the contract and provide a synopsis suitable for advertising purposes.  </p><p>After getting beyond the shock of the money being offered, she started to feel a bit nervous. She wasn’t worried about the length they were suggesting – the chapters didn’t have to be especially long, and there was plenty of material to work with – but she still had some concerns about whether or not the characters really <em>would</em> be sufficiently compelling. They stuck out to her, but then she was Muggleborn and <em>everyone</em> in the magical world seemed a tad bit nutter, even her best friends. While pondering this, she walked boldly and unthinkingly through the school’s open door, turned left, and bumped into the back of her stationary potions professor, who stumbled a few steps towards the three Hufflepuff sixth-years who were being told off for smoking in the boys’ toilet.</p><p>Whirling swiftly around, he glared at her ferociously. “<em>Merlin’s balls! </em>What <em>are </em>you playing at, Miss Granger?!” he exploded. “Off with you!” he said sharply to the students behind him, who didn’t wait to be told a second time. “I realize, Miss Granger that you have been accorded certain privileges,” he gritted out, “but buggering off to Hogsmeade whenever you feel like it <em>isn’t one of them</em>. Fifteen points from Gryffindor and detention, with me, tonight after dinner.” With that, he turned and struck out for the dungeons, his wildly flapping robes making him appear rather like the bat he was sometimes accused of being.   </p><p>She signed the agreement the instant she got back to her quarters.</p>
