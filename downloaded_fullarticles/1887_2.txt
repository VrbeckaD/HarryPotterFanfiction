    <p>On the evening of October 31st 1981, Lucius Malfoy was reclining in his favourite armchair with a glass of firewhiskey and a plate of small pumpkin pies left over from the children's Halloween party, he had almost finished reading Cantankerous Nott's 'Importance of the Preservation of Pure Blood.' As he was about to reach for his fourth pie, a hand snatched the plate away and his hand hit the mahogany table instead.</p><p>“It's nearly eleven, you shouldn't eat so late.”</p><p>“Cissa, one more. Only. Please?”</p><p>Narcissa rolled her eyes and begrudgingly handed her husband the smallest pie on the plate before placing the pies a safe distance outside Lucius' reach.</p><p>It was almost midnight when Lucius finally finished his book and decided to go to sleep. He only slept for three hours before a brief sharp pain on his left forearm woke him. This must have been a dream, as the Dark Lord's call is more like a slow burning sensation, however, before he could comprehend what had just happened and go back to sleep, a figure of a woman appeared beside his bead.</p><p>“Bella! What in Merlin-“</p><p>His cousin and fellow Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange quickly smacked one hand over his mouth and the other on his shoulder to keep his still.</p><p>“We need to go. NOW,” she whispered.</p><p>Lucius quickly looked over at his wife; Narcissa looked as if a hundred hippogriffs would not be able to wake her. He grabbed a long dark green cloak that would hopefully conceal his pyjamas and slippers, then swiftly followed his cousin with not a word more.</p><p> </p><p>This was one of the rare instances when Lucius Malfoy felt genuine fear; believing The Dark Lord would succeed in taking over wizarding Britain, Lucius had engaged in some activities which may not be looked upon favourably by the Ministry, and now that The Dark Lord has fallen, there was nothing preventing the damned Auror Office from initiating a full investigation.</p><p>“…He couldn't kill the Potter boy. When we arrived the house was practically destroyed and there was no sign of the Dark Lord, only the bodies of James and Lily Potter.”</p><p>Lucius caught sight of Severus Snape sitting alone in a corner, slumped against the wall, as if he had lost the will to live, his sallow skin even paler. At the mention of Lily Potter's name, deep ridges formed on his forehead and he closed his eyes, as if willing himself not to cry. Lucius walked over and gently patted his young friend's shoulder.</p><p>“How are you certain the boy survived?” Lucius demanded, there was no possible way a child of Draco's age could have killed The Dark Lord.</p><p>“We heard the kid crying as he was taken away by that half-breed,” Rodolphus Lestrange replied, “Bella and I considered killing him and the boy, but, alas, he is not ours to kill.”</p><p>“You will need a plan,” Snape said, “as Dumbledore believes me to be his spy, I am safe.”</p><p>“We fight. We have learnt from the most powerful wizard of all time, we can defeat the aurors and finish the Dark Lord's work!” Evan Rosier growled.</p><p>Half of the room showed their approval, whilst the other half exchanged worried glances. Lucius decided to speak for the latter half.</p><p>“I think that it is less than prudent to openly declare war against the Ministry.”</p><p>Cassius Crabbe, as well as many others, nodded in approval;</p><p>“My son has just turned two, and my wife is expecting another – do you honestly expect me to leave them behind and waste away in Azkaban?”</p><p>“Cowards! The lot of you!” Bellatrix spat, glowering at Cassius and Lucius.</p><p>“Perhaps you do not comprehend the severity of the situation, Lestrange,” Lucius hissed.</p><p>“Oh we comprehend perfectly, Malfoy,” Bellatrix's lips curled into a snarl, “you know as well as I that the Dark Lord has not been completely vanquished, and that he will return soon.”</p><p>“And you know as well as I that he asked us to. Keep. Them. Safe.”</p><p>The night went on thusly, arguments and the occasional hex on how to proceed, until it was decided that those who unfortunately found themselves captured and sentenced to Azkaban will go proudly, however they will not betray any of their fellow comrades under questioning.</p><p>It was almost six o'clock when Lucius returned to Malfoy Manor, he went immediately to his study where a bottle of McLaggen's Finest Firewhisky was always present. About to pour himself a glass, a sudden impulsiveness compelled him to drink straight from the bottle – four large gulps before heading to his bedroom.</p><p>“Cissa!” Lucius was surprised that his wife has woken so early, she was sitting in an armchair besides the window in a dark blue dressing gown, looking intently at the sky outside. 'I hope I did not wake you when I left?'</p><p>“No no, it was the fireworks that woke me – around four in the morning I think. I take it that the reason for your impromptu meeting was the same as the fireworks?”</p><p>And so Lucius recounted the events of the three hours past, however no amount of firewhisky could inspire enough courage in him to tell his wife that her beloved sister has decided to fight for the Dark Lord until her death.</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>The next day Lucius and Narcissa were eating breakfast as if everything was normal – that was their decided plan; to pretend they had nothing to do with the Dark Lord, when Dobby came in carrying the mail: a copy of The Daily Prophet and a letter sealed with the Ministry of Magic stamp.</p><p>
  <em>     Dear Mr and Mrs Malfoy,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>     Following the delightful events of last night, the Ministry is hosting a celebratory party tomorrow in honour of Harry Potter, 'The Boy Who Lived' and his spectacular defeat of You-Know-Who, ending a period of darkness and terror for the Wizarding World. As one of the Ministry's most generous supporters, we are inviting you to join us at 6 o'clock in the evening in the Atrium.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>     Best Wishes,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>     Millicent Bagnold, Minister for Magic</em>
</p><p>“It looks like we're going to a party Cissa,” Lucius said, placing the letter down onto the table and picking up The Daily Prophet.</p><p>“Slightly worse news; you cousin Sirius has been arrested for being a Death Eater and…” Lucius paused whilst finishing the article, “and for blowing up some muggles and Peter Pettigrew.”</p><p>Narcissa gently shrugged one shoulder, broke off a piece of toast and started buttering it.</p><p>“Sirius Black is no family of mine,” she vehemently said lowly.</p><p>Lucius would have believed her except for the fact she continued to butter the same piece of toast for two minutes now, her knuckles holding the butter knife white. “I hope he rots in Azkaban.”</p><p>Lucius and Narcissa, having arrived fashionably late, were instantly greeted with warm words from Cornelius Fudge, a Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, and with not so warm words from Alastor Moody, head of the Auror Office. Lucius was pleased to note the absence of the blood traitor Arthur Weasley, and returned to his conversation with Fudge.</p><p>“Shocking…absolutely shocking to see someone do such horrendous things…blood everywhere.”</p><p>“Yes, and I am sure that the entire wizarding world is grateful to you for the apprehension of such a violent criminal… certainly he must have been largely responsible for the numerous previous attacks as well?”</p><p>“Well we shall find out next week, during his trial, discover the monstrous things he has been doing under You-Know-Who, although he still claims inn- ah! Weasley! Glad you see you!”</p><p>Fudge's sudden exclamation was accompanied by loud grunts and the appearance of a lanky bespectacled redheaded man and a smaller redheaded boy, both wearing robes that had been roughly mended.</p><p>“Sorry I'm late Fudge, fireplace malfunctioned a bit – and three boys - you know how they can be!” Weasley laughed whilst wiping Floo Powder off his face. “This is Percy, my youngest, he's been begging me to bring him to the Ministry, wants to be Minister of Magic – don't you, Percy?”</p><p>The boy threw his father an irritated look as his face turned as red as his hair, whilst Fudge burst into laughter.</p><p>This was completely and utterly against decorum; no other families brought their children, yet everyone else was fawning over this redhead little brat as if he was The-Boy-Who-Lived himself.</p><p>“How dare you show your face here Malfoy? Do you have no shame?”</p><p>Lucius cursed internally; it seems his pleasant evening will be short lived.</p><p>“Pity you did not bring your entire family Weasley, I suppose today's food will be the best they've ever have the chance to taste.”</p><p>“Surrounding you are the families of those who died fighting You-Know-Who, whose deaths were caused by you and your Death Eater friends!”</p><p>Lucius rolled his eyes and sighed, he was already bored with this conversation.</p><p>“I do not plan on wasting my time listening to your unfounded accusations Weasley,” he drawled, walking away to find better company more fitting for a Malfoy.</p><p>The evening was spent, on Lucius' part, discussing with various high ranking Ministry officials, such as the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement Bartemius Crouch, on how You-Know-Who's downfall will affect the political landscape of wizarding Britain, whilst Narcissa utilised her time by offering her sincerest condolences as well as the occasional sympathetic smile and pat on the hand to the widows and families of those who died fighting You-Know-Who's.</p><p>When they finally returned to Malfoy Manor, their son, Draco, was fast asleep. As Lucius sat stroking Draco's little cloud of blond hair, he realised that for his beloved child there was no possible way he would allow himself to go to Azkaban.</p><p> </p><p>The Malfoy's pleasant lunch of venison pie and pumpkin soup was imprudently interrupted by Dobby the house-elf accompanying two men, one tall and black, dressed in rich purple robes, and the other, of a considerably reduced stature, was dressed in black and blue, however both were sporting silver badges with the engraved blue letters 'D.M.L.E'- Aurors. Narcissa stabbed at a piece of venison with her fork; with the Dark Lord gone, these Aurors think they have nothing to fear and they assume that they can act with such a complete lack of propriety –</p><p>“Gentlemen, to what do we owe this pleasure?” she asked, smiling courteously in the fashion her mother Druella had instilled in her since birth.</p><p>“We need you to come with us to the Ministry – and Mr Malfoy, you too. We have some questions to ask you.”</p><p>“Unfortunately that will not be possible, I am a busy man, and I ought to have received prior notice.” Lucius continued to eat as if there had been no disruption, Narcissa doing the same.</p><p>“We're not asking, Malfoy. Both of you are to come with us to the Ministry now.”</p><p>Five seconds of silence ensued, until Narcissa's cornflower blue eyes locked with Lucius's silvery grey ones, and simultaneously, they rose from their chairs.</p><p>“Dobby, fetch our cloaks.”</p><p>They followed the aurors in stony silence, Narcissa stealing worried glances at her husband, who continued to stare fixedly ahead, but gently squeezed her hand in reassurance. The quartet walked until they reached the black Ministry car parked outside the iron gates of Malfoy Manor.</p><p>Maybe they know Lucius is a Death Eater. Perhaps they found evidence of his participation in murder of those mudblood siblings and their parents? No, it was too soon; it has only been four days, the incompetence of the auror office meant that there was not enough time for them to gather sufficient evidence to arrest Lucius surely? Or maybe someone, some fool had cracked under questioning and betrayed Lucius? Narcissa inhaled deeply, she ought not to be thinking these things, it was imperative at this instant she hide her thoughts.</p><p>Lucius on the other hand, made no attempt to control his thoughts; he was furious at the fact that he and his wife had been dragged to the Ministry for no reason. He was a respected member of society and a dear friend of the Minister herself, how dare they do this to them as if they were common criminals?</p><p>The stony silence continued for the entire journey; for Lucius and Narcissa, this was a battle in itself; breaking the silence was a sign of weakness, and for the aurors, well, there was plenty of time to talk later in the interrogation room.</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>“Take a seat Mr and Mrs Malfoy.”The tall one said, pulling out two chair with his wand, and proceeded to sit on one of the chairs opposite them. 'My name is Kingsley Shacklebolt, and this is my partner, John Dawlish.'</p><p>The room was dark; a lone oil lamp being the only source of light. Clearly the luxury of an enchanted sky ceiling was not given to suspected criminals.</p><p>“Why are we here, Mr Shacklebolt?” Narcissa asked, one of her eyebrows raising slightly. “If we are to be so unceremoniously removed from our home there ought to be a good reason, no?”</p><p>“It is about your sister Bellatr-“</p><p>Narcissa almost jumped out from her chair.</p><p>“-ix Lestrange. Do you know where she is?” Dawlish asked.</p><p>Lucius and Narcissa both answered in the negative.</p><p>“Have you had any contact with her for the past five days?” he asked again.</p><p>Again, Lucius and Narcissa both answered in the negative.</p><p>Shacklebolt sighed and pulled out a file from a pocket in his robes, from which he took out two pieces of paper and laid them on the table; on one was a missing persons report, and the other, a photograph.</p><p>“Augusta Longbottom contacted me on the second of November, saying her son and daughter-in-law Frank and Alice did not come home from the Ministry party that night. As Frank and Alice were both members of the Order of the Phoenix, I thought little of their temporary disappearance, assuming they were on a secret mission.” Shacklebolt paused to point his illuminated wand at the photo. “I was wrong. The Longbottoms were found early this morning by the Order.”</p><p>The photo was of a man and a woman – Frank and Alice presumably- their faces, hair and clothes were covered in dried blood, their eyes were rolled back, exposing the yellowish whites of their eyes, and their mouths were agape, allowing their tongues to hang out.</p><p>Narcissa stole a glance at Lucius to see if he knew anything about this, however, judging by his expression of pure shock, he obviously did not.</p><p>“They were found in a hunting lodge belonging to the Lestranges.” Shacklebolt continued, carefully looking at Narcissa and Lucius for a reaction, 'if you know anything at all, you must tell us.'</p><p>If Lucius and Narcissa were astonished by this, their still and calm faced betrayed no hint of their true emotions.</p><p>“Narcissa and I, we have not been in contact with our sister for quite some time, and I can assure you that we had no knowledge of this appalling incident.”</p><p>“Are you quite sure, Mr Malfoy, that you had no inkling of an idea they might carry out such an attack?” Dawlish interjected. 'Where were you</p><p>Lucius bristled at this obvious backhanded accusation.</p><p>“If you do not have any evidence against us, my wife and I will like to go home.”</p><p>“One more thing. Do you know where they might be hiding? Any other homes here or abroad?”</p><p>“They have a small retreat in the south of France, in Montpellier. And a holiday retreat in Devon.”</p><p>Shacklebolt sighed, looking at his interrogates' stony faces, they were not going to get any more information from them today.</p><p>“You may go. Thank you for your time.”</p><p>As Narcissa and Lucius were making their way from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement to the Atrium, Narcissa caught sight of a woman, or rather, her headdress of a stuffed vulture. She was in her late sixties, and visibly distressed, however, it was difficult to see which emotion dominated; sadness or anger. Narcissa nudged her husband and nodded in the direction of the woman.</p><p>“If I'm not mistaken, that is Augusta Longbottom, is it not?”</p><p>“She must have found out about her son and daughter,”Lucius muttered.</p><p>They snuck quietly past Mrs Longbottom, her rage would certainly have turned from her present victim to them; the family of those who orphaned her grandchild, if she had seen them, behind them they heard her voice steadily grow louder and shakier.</p><p>“They were your responsibility Crouch! You should have looked after them! Why did you not listen when I told you? You should've searched for them on that day! They are dead because of your, your complete and utter incompetence – how dare you make excuses for yourself? Thought they were on a secret mission for the Order did you? Bartemius Crouch, if you do not find the monsters who did this, Merlin help me, you will regret being born!”</p><p>Lucius grabbed Narcissa's arm and they hastily made for the lift, eager to be far away from Augusta Longbottom's fury.</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>With a small pop, Narcissa and Lucius appeared outside the gates of their Manor, and they hurried through the iron gates towards the Manor; they had been away for almost two hours, and although Dobby was a more than adequate babysitter, Draco must be wondering where his mother was. There was no need for Narcissa to worry, as Draco's chuckles was heard all the way from the vestibule. A mass of ebony black curls conjuring green dragon shaped clouds for a laughing Draco greeted Narcissa and Lucius as they entered the drawing room.</p><p>“Bella?”</p><p>Bellatrix Lestrange turned around to face her sister, a large smirk spread across her face.</p><p>“You shouldn't leave Draco here alone, you know, when we arrived, he was crying. Honestly, how can you call yourselves parents?”</p><p>“What in Merlin's name are you doing here? You need to leave.”</p><p>“It's wonderful to see you too, dear sister,”Bella's voice saturated with sarcasm.</p><p>“We are serious, Bella.” Lucius interjected. “We were just called to the Ministry because of you and Rodolphus. Why would you do that? Why would you kill two of the most popular Aurors – the whole Department of Magical Law Enforcement is looking for you!”</p><p>“Look, Lucius, we didn't kill them, when we left they were very much alive,” Bella hissed. “All we wanted was to retrieve some information from them, about the Dark Lord. Rodolphus, Rabastan, me and the Crouch kid, we abducted the Longbottoms and we took them to our hunting lodge. We were using the Cruciatus curse on them but they told us nothing. But then,” Bella's eyes widened, and lowering her voice, she said, “they stopped. Just…nothing. It was as if the Cruciatus curse did not affect them anymore. It was as if they became unconscious, we waited a long while but they wouldn't wake up. Then the damned Order came.”</p><p>“Rodolphus, Rabastan and Crouch, where are they now?” Narcissa asked.</p><p>Bella turned her head toward the window, looking out at the wide expanse of forest on the Malfoy estate, where a tiny lone cabin stood.</p><p>“Merlin! You hid them here? Are you absolutely insane? This is the first place the Ministry will look!”</p><p>“Cissy! Please! We won't stay long – Rabs, he was injured when we were escaping, that half breed Lupin – all we need are some healing potions and food, then we will go.”</p><p>There was a few seconds of stillness before Narcissa nodded and headed for the pantry. When Narcissa was far away enough, Bellatrix beckoned Lucius to come closer;</p><p>“I fear we have a traitor in our midst, as for me, my money is on Snape.”</p><p>“Absurd. You know how loyal Snape is to us, he was the one who told the Dark Lord the prophecy.” Lucius refused to believe his friend was anything less than loyal; after all, he was Draco's godfather, he would never betray them like this.</p><p>“He spies on the Order pretending to be spying on us – who knows which side he's really on.”</p><p>“How can you be certain it was a tip off? To be sure, they did find you rather quickly, but perhaps the Order got lucky. It is not as if you or Rod were ever discreet with your previous escapades.”</p><p>As this moment Narcissa returned, holding a box with an assortment of breads, hard cheeses, pickles and dried meats.</p><p>“Here. These should last you a week or so. Dobby is preparing the potions, they will be ready shortly.”</p><p>Placing the box on the floor, Narcissa rushed towards her sister and hugged her tightly, Bellatrix stunned by the sudden sentimental act, chortled and half-heartedly tried to push Narcissa away.</p><p>“It's not like I shall be gone forever, we'll go into hiding for a few months, but the Dark Lord will be back soon, and we along with him. Don't try to contact me, don't put yourself in danger.”</p><p>With the all-purpose healing potions prepared, Bellatrix sauntered out, having placed the potions and the box of food in her small black purse. Narcissa hoped this was not the last time she sees her sister alive; everyone knew that under Crouch, aurors were instructed to 'kill rather than capture,' and the Unforgiveable Curses were encouraged. For Lucius, he comprehended the fact that this was just the beginning of a long series of questionings and accusations.</p>
