    <p>As Draco Malfoy got off the train, ready to get on a carriage that quickly led them to the castle, he heard voices behind him. The voices, though familiar, sounded as if they were in a fight. Draco knew that if he looked back now, he would either regret it, or he would laugh at what was going on. Instead of listening to the Malfoy part of his rational, he looked back and came to see a sight that he had not expected to see. There in front of nearly half the school stood three people he never thought he would see fight like they were now. <br/>Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and Harry Potter stood in front of the entryway of the train. The muggle born witch looked to be beyond angry, Weasley looked to be confused, yet slightly on the muggle born witch's side. As Draco continued to scan the three, he saw that Potter's back was rigid, obviously trying to hold in his emotions. Though he was unused to the sight of the smaller boy showing restraint, Draco hadn't expected less with the the scene, after all the three were friends. Continuing on past the 'Golden Trio' and everyone else., he saw that they were all watching, whispering, and pointing, as if something other than the fight was going on.</p><p>Draco would like to say that he was pleasantly surprised when he went back to Potter to see that the boys physical features had changed. He noticed some changes in the boy for he could not see Potter completely. Potters hair had grown, but not much. Just enough that his unruly curls were able to lay down and looked effortlessly tossed. Potter also seemed to have become more curvaceous, or more properly put, he looked as if he had finally ate properly for the first time in years and his body had thanked him properly. Draco sighed in defeat for he could not see any more changes. Draco gave a sigh as the yelling became louder.</p><p>Soon Potter was walking away and Granger started following behind him dragging the Weasley boy along with her. As they got closer, Malfoy was able to hear them better. And he began to listen in on what was being said between them all. </p><p>â€œI would greatly appreciate it if you would kindly leave me alone Granger." Harry said in a hiss. "I really don't need fake friends. And don't try to make up any excuses, after all I heard you talkin to Ginny and Parkinson about me. They say you're the brightest witch of the age, but you cant surely be that when you talk bout people when they are able to hear you."</p><p>Draco smirked at what the small boy had said waiting to see if Granger or Weasel would say anything in retaliation.</p><p>"Fake friends, please! We weren't even friends. We were all paid to interact with you. A hundred galleons a week to keep you clueless. And you bought it all. Pathetic. Truly pathetic. I bet you, even Malfoy was paid to be your school bully. Good luck with being a friendless, disgusting pouf." Hermione hissed.</p><p>Draco gave a growl of disapproval.as the growl ripped through the air, many people turned to look at him as if they could feel his anger. Then he saw the full face of the small boy. Potter had changed quite a bit over the summer. His face had become soft and round, as if to look slightly more feminine. His hair fell in soft waves around his face, no longer a dark chocolate brown, but a dark and beautiful black that looked to be soft. Draco also noticed pointed tips poking through his hair where ears would have been, telling Draco Malfoy exactly what he was. Then he saw the large tears that fell from the eyes that never changed. Emerald green eyes that held pain behind round glasses that made him Harry Potter.</p><p>Just at that moment, Harry had looked up at him, and Draco had lost it all. He did not care that he would be talked about later on. He was going to make sure that Potter was not to be seen by anyone else, and that the two so called friends of his would not see him look broken over the words the muggle born girl spewed. It didn't help that his inheritance called for him to follow the dark haired boy, and comfort him till no tear rolled down his face any longer.</p>
