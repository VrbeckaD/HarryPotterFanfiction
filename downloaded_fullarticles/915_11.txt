    <p>Harry swallowed and shifted his feet again, trying to bury his toes in the shag of the carpet. It might have worked too if his socks had been the same colour, but, unfortunately, they were quite the opposite; a cream rug and black socks made it hard to hide. Not that it stopped him trying. </p><p>He needed the distraction. </p><p>For Tom was across the room, sucking all the air out of it.</p><p>It didn’t seem to matter that the radio was humming a soft little song and that the sound of traffic could still be heard outside the window, despite the double glazing, the room was still too quiet. A stillness possessed it, a stillness that was commanded by Tom’s hand, and Tom’s hand alone, as though he were a Roman emperor deciding whether a man should live or die. </p><p>And Tom knew what control he held. </p><p>Though the influence that his presence demanded had never seemed to lose its novelty to him because that same smile always infected his mouth; the slightest curl of his lip when someone realised, they were lower down on the food chain. For most people, it was subconscious how obsequious they became in his presence, and those that possessed the self-awareness to understand the role they engaged in, continued to act it regardless. </p><p>Of course, there were only a select few that didn’t like Tom, and weren’t afraid to say it out loud; their names were on a list pinned to the fridge, and Harry didn’t like to ask what happened when, every so often, Tom would draw a line through one of the names with a red marker. </p><p>Those thoughts were interrupted by the sound of Tom’s metal spoon against the edge of his teacup. It clinked loudly and made Harry swallow again. Not that Tom seemed to notice, he just continued to stir, making whatever ridiculous amount of sugar he’d put into that cup slowly dissolve. </p><p>Harry took a long blink; it was oppressive being in here, crushing, like being trapped against the ocean floor and feeling the water start to leak into your lungs, and just knowing that you were going to die and there was nothing you could do.</p><p>That was what it was like being in a room with Tom when he was irritated. </p><p>When he opened his eyes again, Tom was still watching him with an intense enough look that Harry could either stare back with just as much fervour or, as he was doing, he could avoid it altogether. Just watching the floor and trying to bury his toes. Sometimes, he did stare Tom down, and sometimes he even won.</p><p>But that wasn’t the point tonight. </p><p>This wasn’t mere disagreement, rather, this was something that had been building for a week now. Harry had felt it for the first time on Tuesday, and he’d pretended that it hadn’t existed until Thursday, but now it was undeniable; this great presence hanging like a shadow over the entire room. </p><p>Tom had been too quiet all week, and his presence had become cold and somewhat uncomfortable to be around. Clearly, he’d been musing on something because that was how Tom functioned to do with anything that might just constitute itself as an emotion; he treated it like a pathogen that needed to be examined, understood, and cured.</p><p>Normally, that worked. </p><p>Normally, he would have snapped out of this mood by now. </p><p>But he hadn’t yet, so thee thing that was bothering him must have stitched itself right down under his skin; tautening his spine and straightening his neck and tightening his fingers, and shortening his temper, which made it all so much more suspicious that Tom was now ¬<em>oh so causally</em> lounging in the chair. His legs crossed and the teacup and saucer balanced on the arm.</p><p>He was still stirring. </p><p>It was the one sign that Tom was not as relaxed as he’d like to be; a compulsiveness that was always more apparent when he was irritated, whether he’d admit it or not. Regardless, he was still more relaxed than Harry would have thought he’d be; limbs looser and his smile, almost lazy on his mouth.</p><p>Ever so deliberately, and without lowering his eyes, Tom brought the cup to his mouth and swallowed slowly. Harry watched as his throat contracted and he found himself pushing his hands into the gap between the seat of his chair and the arm; desperate for a distraction.  </p><p>He lowered the cup and the clink as he set it down almost Harry wince. </p><p>“Do you know what I dislike, Harry?” Tom said softly; conversationally almost, as he leaned back, moulding his spine to the back of the chair and continuing to smile like a jaguar might if it had the capability. </p><p>Harry shook his head. </p><p>Still paying too much attention to the floor. The grains of the wood, and how they disappeared under the pale fluff of the carpet before reappearing on the other side. It was an interesting past time, but not one he would have engaged in had Tom not been watching him.</p><p>And he knew he was watching his every move, cataloguing it somewhere in the back of his brain to dig out later. Harry could feel his eyes as they burrowed beneath his skin and ate their way into his blood vessels. </p><p>“Well, I’ll tell you, shall I?” he said, starting to lean forward as though this were a much more intimate, and somewhat illicit conversation within their own home. “I dislike people who can’t respect personal property,” Tom murmured, “I mean, at best it’s contemptible, at worst… it’s appalling.”</p><p>The words, whatever they were, cut through all the other sounds of the room and went straight to the centre of Harry’s brain, and it all made sense. He knew what this was about. What all the seething that had become so wet with feeling it was dripping like Spanish moss from Tom’s every word, was actually about.   </p><p>Tom took another sip of his tea, his head tipped back and the crest of his throat on display. Harry could see it in his periphery, and he couldn’t help but take it as a promise of what Tom was going to do later; what he always did when he felt there was the slightest chance that something he had claimed as his own, might just slide like sand between his fingers. </p><p>Jealousy was not something that looked good on most people; but Tom wasn’t most people, and despite how <em>unintentional</em> this situation was, a small of Harry, somewhere deep in his stomach was glowing. An intense fuzziness spreading a warmth through his veins and right into his heart; just knowing that Tom could get irritated enough by someone’s innocent hands greeting him, that it would disrupt his entire week, was simply thrilling. </p><p>But when Harry didn’t reply or even offer his agreement, Tom stood up. The teacup remained balanced on the arm of his chair whilst he walked over; the sound of his shoes, at first, clicking hard against the wood of the floor, before they became quite muffled by the carpet. </p><p>He stood there, casting a shadow across the chair that Harry sat in, subsuming him in the process. And Harry kept his eyes firmly on his feet, in part, because he feared he might smile at the sweetest, but mostly because he doubted, he could face Tom’s smile without having his insides ripped down by the sheer ferocity of feeling.</p><p>“I want you to look at me, Harry,” he said, his tone still light, all things considered; though it was impossible to miss the intonations of control that threaded their way through; as though each and every word had been formed inside a perfect, objective, mould that would not let feelings leak into it. Of course, there was also the command laced between the letters, for this was not merely a request, but a demand politely worded.</p><p>And, because it was Tom, Harry would obey. </p><p>Slowly, ever so slowly, he raised up his chin, taking in the full length of Tom as he did so. He wetted his lips. There was a vehemence to Tom that usually wasn’t quite so close to the surface; something thick and dark lodged in his skin like fragments of glass. Normally this <em>violence</em>, for that was what it was in the purest sense, was kept shut away and reserved for only the most irritating of moments. </p><p>But now, it practically dripped from his skin</p><p>Tom leaned down and took Harry’s chin between his thumb and forefinger. His fingers were still warm from holding the teacup, and they held him firmly enough to leave behind pale indents. “I don’t like it when other people touch my personal property,” he murmured, bringing his face close enough to Harry’s that Harry could feel the heat of his tongue. “You understand that, don’t you, Harry?” </p><p>Harry just swallowed.</p><p>This close up, Tom was too intense for words to hold sway. There was a point where things become too strange or too grotesque or simply too handsome to describe, and now the point had been reached. Harry continued to watch though, even with his thoughts a mere mess of sensation and suggestion. The thoughts of what Tom’s hands would feel like, and how hot his mouth would be, and other, simple things, like how his eyes looked like black treacle moving in viscous swirls, sucking Harry in as a whirlpool does hapless ships</p><p>But Tom just smiled in a way that contained equal measures of seduction and cruelty. Though, he loosened his grip on Harry’s chin, and instead began to track his fingers down to his neck. “I don’t like feeling them on you,” he said, as he traced the jugular with the very tips of his nails. “Their fingerprints on your wrists, and their handprints on your back, and their kisses your cheek.”</p><p>Tom’s nails crossed to the other side of his throat and continued up the parallel line, scratching a pink strip into the skin. “I can smell their cologne on your collar after they get too close,” he murmured, his fingers dipping down to undo Harry’s collar.</p><p>“And I hate it.”</p><p>Without meaning to, Harry shivered and then squirmed; pressing himself further back into the chair as Tom leaned closer, his lips grazing the corner of Harry’s mouth. “Remember, Harry,” he said softly, his mouth so warm against the shell of his ear, “you’re mine to do what I will with, and I am not <em>willing</em> to share.”</p>
