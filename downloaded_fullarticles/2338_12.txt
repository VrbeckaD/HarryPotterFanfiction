    <p>      Harry had this gut feeling that something was terribly off since he stepped into the maze. The walls of thick vines stood high and oppressive, shrouded in a layer of fog that muffled the young Alpha’s acute sense of smell. Harry walked briskly with his wand ready at his side. He supposed that he should be nervous with the sinking feeling in his gut, but his Alpha instincts filled him with a stronger, almost euphoric urge to fight.<br/>      “Protego!” From a distance, he made out Cedric’s voice. This means that the cup must be close!<br/>      As Harry picked up speed, the walls around him rustled and suddenly came alive without warning. Alarmed, Harry raced toward the source of the sound like a Seeker to the Snitch. The narrow tunnel began closing in on him rapidly, as the thorny vines reached out to grab him. But Harry was faster. He tore through the tunnel just as the walls crushed together behind him, a jet of red light flashing right before his eyes.<br/>      “Expelliarmus!” The jet of light hit Viktor Krum squarely in the chest and knocked him into the air. The magic behind this simple spell was no doubt very strong, if the Krum sprawling unconscious on the ground was anything to go by. Harry wondered briefly if he would be able to fire a stronger disarming charm.<br/>      “Hello, Harry”. Cedric said. Even after a duel, he looked more composed than Harry, who emerged from the tunnel with cuts all over his body and leaves stuck in his wild hair. Cedric stood tall and handsome, with one loose strand of hair hugging the outline of his face elegantly.<br/>      “Hello Cedric”. Even though Harry could not smell the older Alpha thanks to the fog, his inner Alpha puffed up his chest and raised his wand.<br/>      The look on Cedric’s face turned serious as well, then his wand flicked in the air.<br/>      “Accio C..”<br/>      “Stupefy!” Harry yelled. His spell left a burnt hole in the ground as Cedric dodged agilely to the side, but Cedric’s summoning spell was stopped just in time.<br/>      “Nice try.” Harry teased, making Cedric chuckle gently. Moments like this made Harry think that they could have become good friends, but his Alpha brain was more preoccupied with stuff like winning the tournament and Cho’s floral Omegan smell.<br/>      “I couldn’t resist a good fight either when I just presented as Alpha”<br/>      “I’m kind of enjoying this Alpha thing.”<br/>      Cedric smiled knowingly and raised his wand as well. This time they attacked almost at the same time. Harry dodged quickly, but before he could find his footing a new spell flew right at him. Harry conjured the fastest shield in his life to counter that, and felt the force of the spell reverberating through his arm. Before his shield fully dissipated, Harry shot a stunning spell at Cedric in quick succession. Two jets of light, including the rebounded curse, flew at Cedric simultaneously. It would have caught any unexperienced dueler by surprise, but Cedric took advantage of the minute time difference between spells to dodge one and shield the other.<br/>      <em>I'm not fast enough.</em> Harry thought to himself, heart thumping from the exhilarating duel.<br/>      Cedric did not hesitate to attack again, forcing Harry to duck ungracefully. The dueling went on, with both teenage Alphas unwilling to budge an inch. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew from the depth of the maze and almost knocked Harry to the ground. The vines around them rustled again and creeped toward them impatiently.<br/>      The wind was attacking them from all sides now, pushing them towards the Cup and forming a swirling tornado as their arena. Realizing that it would only get worse, Harry started running toward the Cup while holding his shield in place. Against the leaves and rocks flying in his face, Harry saw that Cedric was sprinting towards the Cup just as fast – they could reach the Cup at the same time! An idea, or more accurately, an instinct, formed in Harry’s mind.<br/>      “Sectumsempra!” Harry shouted. It was one of the spells he found on the second-hand potions book, one that he had yet had the opportunity to practice.<br/>      The beam of light ripped through Cedric’s perfect shield and the next thing Harry knew, Cedric wailed and fell.<br/>      Harry’s mind went blank for a moment. “Cedric!” His foot steeled themselves inches away from the cup and carried him to the fallen Hufflepuff champion, who let out a pained groan at his touch. There was a long, bleeding gash on the side of his abdomen, where his spell had hit.<br/>      Harry racked his brains for a healing spell in panic and came up empty.<br/>      “Are you alright?” He asked stupidly.<br/>      “What did you say?” Cedric screamed at him through the deafening wind threatening to knock out the both of them.<br/>      Harry let out a sigh of relief. “Never mind.” He said, and fired Periculum at the sky.<br/>      Taking a deep breath, Harry braced himself against the wind and walked toward the shiny Cup which was rightfully his by now. His fingers closed around the cold metal, when he felt a hook grip his body and sent him reeling into nothingness.</p><p>      Harry fell, face first, into soft, damp soil. His heart sank, thinking that this must be another part of the Third Task, and he wasn’t so sure he could face another dragon or some other dangerous creature in this exhausted state. Fighting the disorienting feeling, Harry observed his surroundings. What he saw only made his heart sink further as a chill rose in his spine.<br/> He was in the middle of a dark, unkept graveyard, one that he had seen from his dreams involving Voldemort. Only now there was a large boiling cauldron in the middle. The headstone before him read, in dull letters, “Thomas Riddle”.<br/>      He didn’t need his Alpha instinct to ring any more alarms to know that he needed to get the fuck out of here, now. Harry scrambled up to reach for the Cup that lied innocently on the ground merely a few feet away.<br/>      “Get him.” A shrill voice ordered.<br/>      Ropes shot out of nowhere, wrapped around his wrists and ankles and twisted his arms behind his back. Harry threw his head back to see the attacker, and what he saw made him seethe in anger.<br/>      “Pettigrew” Harry spat out the man’s name like it was the vilest curse. He may be tied up on the floor like a pig for slaughter, but his Alpha scent crackled furiously around him.<br/>      Then Harry saw the thing lying in Pettigrew’s hands.<br/>      “Do it now!” The thing commanded. Harry’s scar burst into a searing pain that made him scream uselessly on the ground. It hurt so much, as though a knife repeatedly stabbed his skull. Through the red haze of pain Harry felt that he was levitated then tied against the stature on the grave.<br/>      The thing, Voldemort, was dropped into the cauldron with a plop.<br/>      “Bone of the father, unwillingly given..”<br/>      Harry watched in disgust as Pettigrew cut off his own hand screaming.<br/>      “Flesh of the servant…willingly sacrificed”<br/>      Holding the bloody knife, Pettigrew walked up to Harry. Harry cursed as Pettigrew made a trembling cut on his arm.<br/>      “..Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken..” drops of Harry’s blood fell into the cauldron<br/>      “The Dark Lord shall rise again!”<br/>      The sudden intense pain from the scar made Harry scream and bang his head against the stature. A few seconds felt as long as an hour under its torture. When it eventually subsided, Harry finally was able to breathe again. Through tears and broken glasses, he saw the Dark Lord rise in his full, terrifying glory.<br/>      Voldemort stood in the black mist of his new birth, looking over his long, slim limbs. Slender fingers caressed his noseless face and hairless skin. Those inhuman crimson eyes closed momentarily with relish, as mirth dances on his almost non-existent lips.<br/>      The oppressive aura of Dark Magic swept across the graveyard, Harry would have felt suffocated, if not for a faint pleasing scent in the air. Harry breathed deeply, trying to figure out what it was.<br/>      “My wand, Wormtail.” His voice was soft and smooth, and it tingled something in Harry in a strange way.<br/>      The rat, now cowering on the ground, offered up a grotesque white stick to Voldemort.<br/>      Voldemort swirled his wand, and the black mist formed a billowing black robe that hugged him from neck to toe. The sleeves extended over his wrists, baring the minimal around of pearl-white skin.<br/>      Watching as Voldemort effortlessly commanded magic to his will, Harry’s short life seemed to fly by before his eyes. He thought dearly of his friends, of Ron and Hermoine. He hated the thought of dying at 15, still a virgin. He hated how his death could break Sirius’s heart. The thought of that made his heart ache with hatred for the two men before him. He would regret having died without making Pettigrew pay for what he had done. The Alpha in him sneered and thrashed at the thought, ropes digging deeply into his wrists as he struggled.<br/>      Voldemort grew suddenly still, and sniffed the air suspiciously. Turning around, the Dark Lord turned his attention to Harry for the first time.<br/>      “Harry” The monster smiled maliciously “I have almost forgotten you were here.”<br/>      “Living inside a potato could do that to your memory span.” Harry said, surprising even himself when he actually managed to smile in Voldemort’s face.<br/>      Rage twisted Voldemort’s features. He moved towards Harry in his strange but not ungracefully way of carrying himself, like a snake slithering through grass. Cold hands abruptly seized Harry’s face, forcing his mouth to open.<br/>      “You have grown quite a tongue, Harry” Voldemort pronounced his name in a drawn out, seductive way “Fortunately you won’t need it for screaming.”<br/>      Harry’s mind did not register the looming threat against his tongue. He was hit in the face with the same incredibly arousing smell from earlier, only it had grown much stronger as Voldemort’s warm breath brushed against his face. It was nothing like the banal floral scent of Omegas he had met before. It stirred his yearning like a ripe, juicy fruit to a man on the brink of death from thirst. Yet at the same time it had a sharp bite, a fragrant note of spruce and winter, that made his Alpha mad with the need to fuck and take.<br/>      Harry was rock hard under his pants. He stared at Voldemort’s face with blown irises, amazed by how the scale-like skin around his ruby eyes shimmered in the moonlight.<br/>      Voldemort recoiled from Harry as if burnt. He stared at his own hand, where he had touched Harry, in what could be only described in disbelief, betrayal, fear. Harry took his reactions all in, from the widening of the eyes to the trembling of the thin lips. A silver of Harry’s own reason remained, appalled at this attraction and shocked that the most feared Dark Lord of the century was a sweet, unmarked Omega, whose scent was just begging to be fucked.<br/>      “This is not possible…the ritual was supposed to reverse it...” Voldemort looked lost, his voice broken.<br/>      Oh Harry couldn’t wait to hear what other broken voices the Dark Lord could make. Old magic began coursing through his veins, dulling the pain from his wounds and washing away his exhaustion while heightening other senses. Harry tugged determinedly and violently at the ropes that deterred his hands from having the Omega before him.<br/>      Pettigrew sniffed the sweetness in the air greedily. But confusion and fear easily won over arousal for the cowardly Beta as he questioned in a small voice, “Master?”<br/>      “Silence!” Voldemort stopped in his pacing and yelled “Crucio!”<br/>      Despite the light tremor in the Dark lord’s arm, the spell found it target. Pettigrew screamed in an excruciatingly annoying voice, before looking up cautiously in bewilderment at the how brief and…weak the cruciatus curse felt.<br/>      The air grew thicker by the second with Voldemort’s smell. Harry didn’t have to be an expert on Omegas to know that the new-born Dark Lord was spiraling rapidly into a full blown heat right before his eyes.<br/>      “You are going into heat, Voldemort.” Harry stated with a vindictive smile.<br/>      Voldemort bent over in pain and clutched his belly hidden under the dark robe. Harry knew that Voldemort had hurt himself, possibly with his sharp nails, for the faint yet tantalizing smell of blood that fueled the young Alpha’s fiery desire to lock the Omega in his arms and claim him as his.<br/>      “Crack” The rope against Harry’s wand hand fell off. He must have dislocated his thumb, but the pain was negligible compared to the insatiable want burning in his body. “Finite Incantatem” Harry aimed his wand at the remaining ropes and shrugged them off.<br/>      The Alpha’s musky, heady scent hung heavily in the air, with a hint of the smell of lemons and freshly cut summer grass. The darkest wizard of the century, ravaged by heat, struggled to stand upright before the Alpha. His long legs shook like that of a newborn fawn. As he moved and raised his wand at Harry, a trail of glistening liquid leaked between his legs and wetted the ground below.<br/>      “Avada Kedevra!” Voldemort shouted with desperation.<br/>      For some unfathomable reason, Harry did not try to dodge the death curse. Harry felt a punch where the spell hit him, and his nose warmed funnily. Harry wiped away his nosebleed with a triumphant smile, and stalked toward the Omega.<br/>      Voldemort’s legs gave out as he fell to the floor, a wild look on his face. His own body and magic had conspired against him and made the feared Lord a heap of wet, needy mess.<br/>      Harry took his time, approaching his prey with a deliberate slowness, crushing the Omega’s pride under his foot with each sure step taking him closer to Voldemort.<br/>      “Kill him, Wormtail!” The Omega called out as he struggled to stand, but his legs were weak, and ended up crawling away from Harry pathetically.<br/>      “Wormtail!” The Omega all but begged like his life depended on it. Jealousy lifted its ugly head in Harry’s chest.<br/>      “Sectumsempra!” Harry aimed at Pettigrew who still sat frozen in a shocked stupor. He was getting the hang of the curse. It cut the traitorous rat with such vicious force that he fell lifelessly without even time to scream.<br/>      Not bothering to check if Pettigrew was still alive, Harry grabbed a hold of Voldemort’s neck to make the Omega face him in a kneeling position.<br/>      “Kill me? So that rat or any Muggle passing by could claim you like this?”<br/>      Voldemort struggled weakly. Beneath the long robes, his body convulsed with a need that twisted his innards and overrun his senses. His face was held dangerously close to the tent in the boy’s pants, and the pure Alpha smell was so strong he felt empty to the point of painful.<br/>      Harry unbuckled his pants. His bulging cock jumped out and slapped Voldemort in the face with a lewd sound. The Omega whimpered loudly. A rosy pink climbed up his pale cheeks and reddened his ears, and his mouth opened instinctively to take what his Alpha had to give.<br/>      Harry almost couldn’t resist fucking Voldemort in the mouth when he saw the tip of that forked tongue tremble in the air, as if scenting Harry out. But he couldn’t risk Voldemort suddenly regaining consciousness and biting him. Instead, Harry slapped Voldemort’s face once more, and pressed his arousal to the scale-like skin around his eyes. Harry outlined the non-existent brows, the high cheekbones and the pliant, soft mouth with his cock.<br/>      “What would your followers think if they see you now, Voldemort?” Harry called the Omega’s grandiose name tauntingly.<br/>      Voldemort did not answer but moaned, his cheeks covered in precum and head swimming in the Alpha’s smell. Harry’s hand roamed from his neck to the collarbones, searching for the swollen gland hiding beneath the robes. Voldemort whimpered when his fingers brushed against a spot. Harry applied more pressure this time, and watched in enthrallment as the Dark Lord trembled and bucked his hips, climaxing from a mere touch at Harry’s fingertip.<br/>      The heavenly Omega smell flooded Harry’s lungs and made his emerald eyes see red. Unable to hold it in any longer, he pinned Voldemort down and hiked up his robe. One orgasm was nothing to satiate an Omega in the grips of heat, but it returned the Dark Lord to his senses for a brief moment. He struggled violently under the Alpha, spitting mad with mortification at what had just transpired. Blinded by rage and heat, curses flew hazardously from his wand without finding their target. But a raw magic pulsed around Voldemort, managing to catch Harry unaware and knock him forcefully to the side.<br/>      “You will regret this, Potter… I will skin you alive …”<br/>      Harry laughed. He might have found the threats scarier if Voldemort weren't lying on the ground ass naked and impossibly wet. Instead, his struggles and powerful magical aura only further excited Harry, for it would make it even sweeter when he finally claimed the Omega.<br/>      Harry’s laugh must have stung the Omega’s pride badly. When he utterly another killing curse, the Alpha dodged to the side with ease and snatched his thin wrist in a vice like grip. Harry peeled the bone white wand from Voldemort’s fingers. The wand zapped Harry's palm angrily, unwilling to obey just like its owner, but Harry bent it to his will just the same.“Reducto!” He cast the spell that broke the black robe into shreds before tossing the wand away.<br/>      Naked and disarmed, the last glimmer of hope left Voldemort’s eyes, but still he struggled futilely with weak kicks. Harry grabbed his pale ankles and forced the long legs to spread before him, revealing Voldemort’s genitals and the pink, wet hole.<br/>      “Try that again" Harry warned “I'll take you with me back to Hogwarts. Spread you over the Gryffindor table. Let the entire class see what a whore the Dark Lord really is.” Before Voldemort could react, Harry pushed his swollen cock against him and thrusted.<br/>      Harry had never felt more powerful than this moment, when the silky hole of an Omega greedily sucked on his cock. The feared Dark Lord, murderer of his parents, cried when he ripped his insides and slammed into his deepest, most secret place. Harry took a moment to control himself from the intense wave of pleasure washing over him. He gripped Voldemort’s thighs hard enough to leave bruises, to still the sensitive Omega’s spasms from another orgasm.<br/>      The thought that he already made his Omega come twice fed into the Alpha’s growing ego. He began pounding mercilessly into Voldemort in a manner typical of young, hot-headed Alphas.<br/> Relentless tides of pleasure crushed Voldemort. It was all he could do to clench his teeth and keep the desperate moans from escaping his mouth. He recalled a familiar ache he often experienced in his youth, an emptiness that only an Alpha could fill. He was stretched and filled to be brim right now, but this pleasure was equally if not more torturous. Voldemort thought he had freed himself from his biology a long time ago, with a potion that caused his unwanted organs to shrivel and die. He thought this new body made of pure magic would mark a new beginning, free from a humiliating past, but his old curse had come back to haunt him with a viciousness stronger than ever.<br/>      Tears gathered in Voldemort’s red-rimmed eyes with each thrust. Soon his face was streaked with tears. Harry fucked his tight hole until he was soft and sloppy with water, until he had tightened around Harry’s cock again from another irrepressible orgasm ripping through his body, and the cycle repeated itself.<br/>      “Your skin is so smooth.” Harry said under his breath, running his hand over Voldemort’s bare skin. Every inch of the monster’s body shimmered like white silk, and Harry could not get enough of the feeling.<br/>      “S, stop..” Voldemort half whined and half hissed. It was like what happened when he tried to steal the philosopher’s stone all over again, his skin was set on fire wherever Harry touched him, but this time it came from pleasure instead of pain.<br/>      Harry responded by pounding him even harder. Warm hands reached up to play with Voldemort’s already erect nipples. Voldemort gasped, shocked that the boy had discovered a new way to torment him. It was like a switch was flipped on inside of Voldemort, who moaned and cried with each playful twist or gentle caress. Harry’s mouth watered at the deliciously pink nipples against Voldemort’s pale chest. Giving in to his inner Alpha’s every urge, Harry bent down and took one in his mouth, licking and sucking as he pleased. Those legs had barely any strengths left to struggle after a thorough fuck. This freed Harry’s other hand to tug at the Omega’s weeping dick. It was hairless and cool to the touch just like the rest of the Omega.<br/>      Voldemort felt something explode in his abdomen when he came again, cum splattering all over his belly and his lower body twitching uncontrollably. He was so sore it hurt. Voldemort squirmed, trying to get a moment’s reprieve from the pounding, but his Alpha forced himself through his over-sensitive hole again and again without hesitation. Worse, the evil hand would not stop tugging at his dick, forcing shameful cries out of his mouth.<br/>      “No, please, Alpha!” The Dark Lord begged between ragged breaths “..too much!”<br/>      The hand rewarded his honesty by finally letting go of him. But it was far from over. A pair of lips pressed themselves against his gasping mouth. The oppressive Alpha scent wrapped tightly around Voldemort, until he was drowning in it. Harry chased down Voldemort’s forked tongue and sucked on his thin lips, devouring the addictive sweetness in the Omega’s mouth.<br/>      A twisted idea flitted across Harry’s mind.<br/>      “Look, Voldemort” he broke the kiss and whispered a lie in the shell of his Omega’s ear “Your servant is watching us.”<br/>      Instantly Voldemort went rigid under him. Crimson eyes widened in horror before Voldemort shut them forcefully and buried his face in Harry’s neck, nuzzling against the very source of Alpha hormones. Slender limbs wrapped around Harry’s body tightly, as if his presence were the only haven of protection the Omega knew.<br/>      Harry felt a knot forming in the base of his cock.<br/>      Without breaking the rhythm of thrusts, Harry pulled himself into a sitting position and Voldemort along with him. The Omega whimpered against him, as the straddling position made Harry’s growing hardness reach the deepest part of his body. Nailing Voldemort against him, Harry’s knot quickly ballooned and stretched the virgin hole to its limit.<br/>      Voldemort panted and moaned painfully as Harry poured his seeds inside his Omega’s secret chamber. But the pain soon shifted into a dizzying wholeness and pleasure, forcing Voldemort to climax one last time with eyes rolled back and a scream at the tip of his tongue. Harry, the good Alpha that he is, captured the tongue in his own mouth while caressing the Omega’s head and neck soothingly. Harry did not break the kiss until the knotting was close to be finished.<br/>      “What did you say?” Harry asked, panting. Then he realized that Voldemort was only speaking feverish gibberish, and in parceltongue no less.<br/>      “..Harry Potter..” Voldemort managed to say.<br/>      “I’m here.” Harry answered amusedly. The wizarding world’s boy wonder brushed Voldemort’s head to the side and sank his teeth into the swollen gland.</p>
