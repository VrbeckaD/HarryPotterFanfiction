    <p>
  <span>Snape’s eyes had caught the swish of your black cloak disappearing around the corner, that much you were sure of. He was incredibly observant, no detail escaping his notice, even in the darkness of the dungeons. Despite having been spotted, you didn’t turn back. Snape wasn’t one to punish one of his own, nonetheless a </span>
  <em>
    <span>prefect.</span>
  </em>
  <span> You stood still for a few seconds before hearing his stealthy footsteps move in the opposite direction of your location. You pulled your cloak closer to your body, shivering slightly in the icy air of the dungeons. The fire and calming sounds of the lake in the Slytherin common room now seemed so appealing compared to the quiet and cold of the castle, but you’d already forsaken any hope of feeling content there tonight. Steeling your nerves, you began to climb the stairs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Professor Lupin’s classroom wasn’t difficult to find, even in the darkness. Enough moonlight was streaming in through the windows for you to make out the shapes of the corridors, and you’d almost memorized the path by how many times you’d found yourself here over the first few months of the year. None of your previous Defense Against the Dark Arts professors held your attention quite like Professor Lupin did, and he always obliged your requests for extra practice and after-class visits to his office. A few times you had arrived at his office to find him in the company of Harry Potter, and you had to swallow the emerald-green jealousy that had risen in your throat. Thankfully, at night, you wouldn’t be interrupted. You fidgeted with your cloak for a moment more when you reached the door before pushing it open slowly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The classroom was dark and empty, but warmer. A fire was crackling in Professor Lupin’s office, and the door was cracked. You sneaked up the stairs before peeking into his office. It, like the classroom, was empty. You slipped inside, careful to return the door to its original position. The fire continued to burn as you examined Professor Lupin’s belongings. You’d been in his office before, yes, but always with him present. It would have been impolite to snoop while he was hosting you, but you couldn’t deny yourself the nosy pleasure when he was nowhere to be found. You slowly rifled through the papers on his desk, hoping to find something that would give you more of a glimpse into his personal life- he surely had a wife. There was nothing to be found, not even a personal note, among the homework and lesson plans that rested on his desk. Huffing to yourself, you began examining the creatures and books along the stone walls. Many of the books were worn, the letters cracking and peeling along the spines. Many of his belongings seemed to be heavily used, even his robes, which were always tattered and ripped. You made a mental note to purchase something more heavy-duty for him around Christmastime. Your thoughts had turned to what color robes you might like to see him wearing, if you decided upon those as a gift, when the door of the classroom opened and two voices broke the quiet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>You could make out Professor Lupin’s voice easy enough as you sunk into the shadows, not wanting the flickering light from the fire to reveal your location. There was another voice, a student by the quality of it, and somewhat familiar. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, I-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>You silently cursed as you caught the beginning of Professor Lupin’s next sentence. Of course, it was Harry Potter again. You had been so sure that Harry wouldn’t be in the way tonight, but you’d arrived to find the professor missing, and when he returned the Potter boy was with him. Though eavesdropping was normally one of your favorite pastimes, you found yourself tuning out the conversation as you sulked in the shadows. The fire seemed to be getting warmer, and you debated removing your cloak, but decided against it. You shuffled slightly further away from the flames, lamenting in your own thoughts when you heard the door of the classroom open and close once more. You waited with bated breath to hear if Professor Lupin would begin ascending the stairs or if you were alone once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would have expected more from a prefect.” Professor Lupin’s voice rang out, echoing off the stone. He sounded amused, and you felt yourself involuntarily shiver. “Eavesdropping is considered rude, and I don’t seem to recall inviting you to my office tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t eavesdropping, Professor, I swear.” You put on your most innocent-sounding voice, pouting slightly as you exited his office. He was leaning up against the desk at the front of the classroom, staring up at your position from the top of the steps. You dramatically draped yourself on the banister, meeting his eyes with your own. “I recall you informing me that I was always welcome, but does that only apply to daylight hours?” He smirked slightly, and you relished the way his eyes seemed to quickly slip along your body before he met your eyes again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I often forget that you are a Slytherin.” He left his spot by his desk and began making his way to the stairs. You quickly repositioned yourself, hopping up so that you were sitting on the banister. Something indistinguishable sparked in his eyes before it was masked by calm as he made his way up the stairs to you. “Eavesdropping and snooping might as well be in your house traits.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think your Gryffindor bias is showing, Professor Lupin,” you teased. He came to rest only two feet in front of you, leaning on the banister himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps,” he chuckled, seemingly relaxed. “Still, you would do well to not wander the hallways at this time of night. I am not always so accommodating.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know very well when to keep away from your office, Professor.” Your voice still carried a teasing tone, but you saw every muscle in his body freeze in an instant. His eyes turned cold, but you realized you had already broken the moment, backtracking now would do you no good. “My mother is a Wiccan. I keep track of the lunar cycles. You seem to fall ill conveniently close to the full moon. It’s also quite easy to spot when you’ve grown up with one your whole life.” He seemed to relax slightly at your last sentence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who?” He questioned. You could still see the tenseness in your shoulders. You sighed and scooted closer to him. He shuffled away in response, and you tried to keep your face composed even as your heart and self-esteem took a blow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My brother.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Born or bitten?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Born,” you confirmed. “Graduated three years ago. My father is relatively gifted with potions. He owns a shop in Diagon Alley and my brother is lucky enough to work there. But my brother wasn’t the best with taking his potions if my parents didn’t remind him.” You unfastened the button around your throat and let your cloak fall away from your shoulders, revealing the deep green dress that you were wearing. Professor Lupin diverted his eyes for a second before coming to rest on your face with new intensity, very pointedly making an attempt not to look at the rest of your body. Your confidence swelled again as you slightly repositioned yourself so you could hike up your dress and show him the outside of your right thigh. His eyes flicked downward before being seemingly transfixed by the scarred bite mark that lived there. “He got me when I was three,” you clarified. “But I’ve never turned. While my brother was born with lycanthropy, I seem to be naturally immune. My father and a few doctors from St. Mungo’s have been testing my blood ever since, hoping to find some sort of cure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Silence fell around the two of you like a thick blanket of snow, but it didn’t feel cold. It was more of a pensive silence. You smoothed your dress back over your thigh before hopping down from the banister, electing to lean back against it in a position similar to that of Professor Lupin. He didn’t seem to be stopping himself from examining your form anymore, his eyes sweeping from your exposed shoulders, to your hips, and down your legs before back up to your face again. Basking in his open gaze, you knew he was observant enough to know just how much you were enjoying his attention. The silence was broken after a few minutes by the chiming of the bell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Midnight,” Professor Lupin mumbled, moving from his position against the banister and pushing the door to his office open wider. “Well, you might as well come in.” You smiled slightly before following him, taking a seat in front of his desk as he began busying himself in the corner. “Would you like tea? Butterbeer?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t say no to firewhiskey if you have it, Professor,” you purred. His gaze from earlier hadn’t left your mind and you couldn’t help but test the limits. Slytherins were nothing if not ambitious, and you were no exception. You delighted in the small shiver that ran down his spine. “If not, tea is fine, sir.” The clinking of glasses and bottles answered you as you relaxed more in your chair, tossing your hair over your shoulders so they would be more exposed. Professor Lupin turned around with two glasses and set them on his desk, pushing one over to you before taking his own seat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will be the death of me.” You giggled in response, taking a sip from your glass and relishing the burn that spread in your throat. He took a long drink before continuing. “What made you find your way to my office tonight? Are the Slytherin dormitories not so inviting?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I find them very inviting, Professor. They’re quite warm for being in the dungeons and the sounds of the lake are quite relaxing. However, that Malfoy is insufferable. He struts around the common room like it’s his castle, going on about how very generous his father is to Slytherin house. Even those in my own year treat him like a king.” You took another sip of Firewhiskey before continuing. “Tonight, he began retelling the story of his </span>
  <em>
    <span>tragic </span>
  </em>
  <span>encounter with that hippogriff and I couldn’t stand it anymore. Listening to his dull voice isn’t how I imagined spending my birthday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, I’d almost forgotten.” A small smile played on his lips as he slid open one of his desk drawers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Another bar of chocolate, Professor?” A faint flush spread up his neck and over his cheeks, a heat that you felt gather in your own chest and smolder like the fire burning behind Professor Lupin. He did indeed pull out another bar of chocolate, but there was a small silver chain resting on top of the packaging. “Thank you,” you murmured as you accepted the bar and chain from him. Examining the chain further revealed that there was a small, clear charm attached that seemed to be filled with a white liquid that looked like melted opals. A small smile spread across your face as you slipped the necklace around your neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A charm,” Professor Lupin clarified. “The potion inside will cause the charm to heat up in the presence of those who care about the wearer, while it will become icy in the presence of those who bear ill will.” The charm felt pleasantly warm against your skin, and you rationalized that it was due to being in Professor Lupin’s hand, rather than his affections towards you.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Professor.” You blushed slightly. Your eyes roamed over his face. He looked especially gorgeous in the warm light of the fire, and his eyes fixed intently on yours weren’t helping your racing heart to slow. There was a strand of hair that was falling in front of his forehead, and you itched to reach over and brush it back. You’d come up here with grand plans of finding out if you had a chance with Professor Lupin, but the firewhiskey didn’t seem to steel your nerves. Your hand twitched around your glass as you fought the impulse to touch him. Finishing the last of your firewhiskey, you broke eye contact and looked down at the floor. “Um, I think I should be heading back down to the dungeons, Professor. I </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> have classes tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will walk you back down, incase you run into any of your other teachers.” He stood up quickly, and his eagerness seemed like rejection to you. You put on the cold and collected mask you often wore around some of the other Slytherins to mask your feelings, standing up from your chair as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The walk back down to the dungeons passed quickly, with neither of you speaking. You did cross paths with Snape, but he simply gave you a curt nod before walking past you. You finally stopped in front of the wall that opened into the common room. Without missing a beat, you gave the password. “Basilisk.” The wall melted away, revealing the entrance to the common room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goodbye, Professor.” Your voice even sounded cold now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Remus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My name is Remus.” With that, he turned around and walked away, leaving you to enter the common room and head up to your dormitory for bed.</span>
