    <p>Hermione was trying to stay calm, she really was. The Weasley family, plus her and Harry, were gathered around the table for breakfast like any other Saturday morning. This particular Saturday, however, was a little different. The Hogwart’s letters were due to arrive any minute now and Hermione was dying to know if she’d made Head Girl for her final year at the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Everyone knew she was a shoo-in, but as Hermione was wont to do, she was still afraid she wouldn’t get it.</p>
<p>Finally, finally, after thirty long minutes at the table, she saw an owl approaching in the distance. She reached for Harry’s hand, who was sitting closest to her, and squeezed harder than he thought possible.</p>
<p>“Hermione, you got this. Don’t worry about,” Harry said, trying to extract his hand from her death grip.<br/>
“Yeah, ‘Mione, don’ worry ‘bout it,” Ron told her around a mouthful of pancakes. Everyone else around the table nodded and murmured their agreement.</p>
<p>Molly Weasley let the visiting owl in the window. He stuck out his leg while Harry removed the parcels tied to him. Molly gave the owl a treat and he flew back out the window. Harry passed out the letters to Ron, Ginny, and Hermione. Everyone waited while Hermione opened her letter first. She glanced through the contents quickly until she saw it. Right there on the parchment, written in green ink. She had made Head Girl. </p>
<p>Hermione stood up quickly and announced to the room, “I got it!! I actually got it!” She was beaming with pride. She couldn’t remember the last time she had been quite this happy. </p>
<p>Ron, who had been sitting to her immediate left, stood with her and hugged her tightly, whispering his congratulations in her ear. “We all knew you’d get it,” he said with a smile. She turned to thank the rest of the table, who also offered her congratulations on her achievement.</p>
<p>“Well, now we must celebrate! Hermione, is red velvet still your favorite cake?” Molly inquired, getting straight to business.<br/>
“Molly, you really don’t have to. I don’t want to be any trouble,” Hermione replied.<br/>
“Nonsense, I won’t hear any more of it. You four go on to Diagon Alley and get your school stuff, and don’t come back before supper!” </p>
<p>Hermione, Ginny, Harry, and Ron finished their breakfast and went upstairs to get ready for the long day. Hermione couldn’t get the grin off of her face.</p>
<p>One Month Later</p>
<p>The four Gryffindor’s made their way through the Hogwart’s Express looking for an empty compartment.  Eventually they ran into Neville, who told them a few other eighth year students were in the very back compartment. The group thanked him and walked toward the back of the train. When they reached their destination, they found Padma and Parvati Patil, Luna Lovegood, Susan Bones, and Michael Corner sitting in the large compartment. They all greeted each other and shuffled around to make room for the newcomers. </p>
<p>“Harry, we didn’t know you were coming back! We’d heard you were starting Auror training immediately,” Parvati addressed Harry, with Padma next to her nodding her agreement.<br/>
“I wasn’t going to, but Hermione convinced me that finishing up school would benefit my career in the long run. So, here I am,” Harry replied with a shrug of his shoulders. </p>
<p>The Patil twins shared a look and moved their attention to Ron. “Ron, what are your plans after school?”<br/>
Ron glanced quickly at Hermione before answering. “I’m really not sure. I think I’ll start Auror training with Harry, unless I get an offer to play professional Quidditch,” he answered with a small, smug smile.<br/>
“It would be so cool to see you playing with a professional team! You should totally do that,” Padma replied.<br/>
Again, Ron glanced at Hermione, who was completely oblivious to his stare, before he answered. “Ah, we’ll see.”</p>
<p>The rest of the train ride passed in a blur, the group talked and caught up after their year apart. When they arrived, Hermione said goodbye to everyone, as she had to meet with Headmistress McGonagall to discuss her position as Head Girl before heading to the Welcome Feast. </p>
<p>Hermione walked swiftly to McGonagall’s office, eager to be in the Great Hall with everyone else. She gave the password to the gargoyle guarding the staircase and jogged up the stairs. The door to the office was open and Hermione nearly passed out when she saw who was already talking to McGonagall. </p>
<p>Draco Malfoy turned when he heard her approach and his face went even paler than normal. They stared at each other for what felt like hours but was really only a few seconds.</p>
<p>“Miss Granger, good. You’re here. If you and Mister Malfoy will have a seat, we will begin.”</p>
<p>The two sat down slowly, wary of what the other might do.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you have already figured it out, but to state the obvious, you two are the Head Boy and Girl of Hogwart’s. I’m sure this a shock but trust me when I say I have given these appointments the most thought I could have. You two are the highest performing students in the school and you were both prefects before the war interrupted your education. I hope you can set aside your differences and do the very best job possible.” She fixed them both with a very stern gaze, expelling any thoughts of complaining from their minds. “Now, any questions?”</p>
<p>“Um, will we be staying the Heads’ dormitory or in our House dormitories?” Hermione asked hesitantly.<br/>
“You will be staying in the Heads’ dormitory, as is custom of the appointment. You will share a living room, kitchenette, study space, and bathroom. You have separate bedrooms that can require a password to enter if you wish. Understood?”<br/>
“Yes, ma’am,” Hermione and Draco said together.<br/>
“You will have weekly meetings with all of the prefects. You can schedule those at whatever time is best for you. You will also have monthly meetings with the Heads of Houses. Those will be on the first Monday of every month, so be sure to not schedule your prefect meetings on that day. I am available by appointment if you feel you need my advice or help with something but do make sure it’s important. I am quite busy these days. Lastly, you will patrol the halls twice a week, as we are short on prefects this term. I believe that is all the time we have, so let us make our way down to the Great Hall.” She stood, gesturing to the students before her to follow suit.</p>
<p>The walk to the Great Hall was the most awkward experience of Hermione’s life. Her and Draco walked silently behind McGonagall, listening to her explain the extensive rebuilding the school had to have in order to open this year. When they reached the doors to the Great Hall, McGonagall gave them directions to their dormitory and the password for the portrait guarding the entrance.</p>
<p>“I hope we can all have an excellent year. Enjoy the feast!” McGonagall left the pair standing in the doorway as she walked to the front of the hall. They quickly realized they were alone and made their way to their house tables. Hermione sat down next to Ginny and put her head in her hands.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Hermione?” Ginny asked quietly.<br/>
“Draco Malfoy. That’s what’s wrong.” Hermione replied tersely.<br/>
“You don’t mean…”<br/>
“Yep. He’s Head Boy and I’m Head Girl and we have to live together for an entire year. But don’t tell Harry or Ron you know how they get. I’d like to enjoy my last Welcome Feast. I’ll tell them tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The girls fell silent as McGonagall stood to address the students. She welcomed everyone back to Hogwart’s and went over the basic ground rules that were told at every Welcome Feast. Then she did something out of the ordinary – she introduced the new prefects. Hermione’s stomach dropped, knowing what she was about to say next.</p>
<p>“The last introduction I’d like to make is that of our new Head Boy and Girl – Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger.” You could hear the collective gasp the students made over the first years’ applause, not realizing how strange this announcement was. Harry and Ron whipped their heads around to stare questioningly at Hermione, silently asking why she hadn’t told them already. She shrugged and mouthed that she would tell them later.</p>
<p>“This year, we’ll be giving House Points a little differently than normal. Any time a prefect, professor, or head sees you interacting positively with a student not in your own house, you both will receive two House Points. If they see you interacting negatively, you will both lose five points. I really want to stress the importance of House Unity this term. Go outside of your comfort zone, talk to students you wouldn’t normally talk to, and above all else, treat each other with kindness and respect. Now, it is time for bed. Prefects, lead your first years to their dormitories. Goodnight, everyone. Have a wonderful term.”</p>
<p>Hermione rose from the table and told her friends she would talk to them at breakfast the next morning. She waded through the crowd of students and hurried to her new dorm. Draco had not yet arrived at the dorm, so Hermione decided to take a quick look around. A few feet in front of the entrance was a kitchenette with a large table that Hermione assumed would also function as a study and work space. To the right of the entrance was the living room. It had a couch and a cozy looking armchair that would be the perfect reading chair for her. The furniture was situated in front of a blazing fireplace that was giving the space a warm glow. There was a small bookshelf sitting next to the fireplace, and Hermione noticed it already housed both hers and Draco’s schoolbooks. On the right wall was a door that she assumed went to the shared bathroom. There were another two doors next to the kitchenette that opened into the bedrooms. All in all, it was nice common room, Hermione decided. She heard the portrait hole opening and turned to see Draco climbing through.</p>
<p>“Granger,” Draco mumbled in greeting.<br/>
“Malfoy. How are you?” Hermione asked, trying to be polite.<br/>
“I’m bloody fantastic, thanks,” Draco replied rather sarcastically.<br/>
“Look, Malfoy, I don’t want to spend the year fighting with you. I’m just trying to be nice -”<br/>
“Granger, I really don’t fucking care alright? Just stay out of my way and I’ll stay out of yours.” With that, he stalked off to his room and slammed the door, leaving Hermione looking dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Hermione walked to her room and looked around. It was spacious, with a queen sized, four-poster bed in the center with a dark grey comforter. There was a chest of drawers with a door next to it leading to her walk-in closet. The room had two windows, one on each side of her bed, that looked over the Black Lake. She also had a nightstand next to her bed. The walls were a lighter shade of grey than her bedspread and the floor was covered in a plush, white carpet. She loved her room and wondered if Draco’s was decorated similarly. </p>
<p>Seeing that her trunk was sitting at the foot of her bed, she decided to unpack it now rather than wait until later. She put her clothes away and put a few pictures on her nightstand and chest of drawers. The pictures included moving ones of her and Ginny and one of her, Ron, and Harry, and non-moving ones of her and her parents. She looked at the latter dejectedly, sad that she couldn’t restore her parents’ memories after Oblivating them to keep them safe from Voldemort. </p>
<p>Quickly changing into her pajamas, which consisted of a tank top and pair of sleep shorts, she got into bed and read the novel she started at the Burrow before leaving for Hogwarts. It wasn’t long before sleep claimed her.</p>
<p>------------------------</p>
<p>Draco awoke with a start. The bloodcurdling scream that woke him was still ringing in his ears – wait, no, the screaming was still going, he realized. He got out bed and went to Hermione’s door. It was definitely coming from in there. He wasn’t sure what he was supposed to do. He didn’t really care, but he also realized he wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep with her screeching about like she was. He raised his fist and tentatively knocked on her door. </p>
<p>“Granger?”<br/>
“I didn’t take anything! Please, no! Harry, Ron!! Help me!” She was still screaming, apparently having a nightmare.<br/>
“Granger??” He asked a little louder, still no response.<br/>
“GRANGER!” He yelled, pounding on her door. The screaming finally stopped, he could hear faint sobs coming from the room.<br/>
“Granger, are you all right in there?”<br/>
Hermione opened the door, seeing Draco standing there. She saw his eyes travel down her body, lingering on her exposed legs, then shooting back up to her face.<br/>
“What do you want, Malfoy?”<br/>
“You were screaming in your sleep and I came to see if you were okay. Excuse me for caring, won’t happen again,” Draco replied, taking one last look at her long legs before turning back to his room.<br/>
“Wait, Malfoy, I’m sorry. I knew I had a nightmare, but I didn’t realize I had been screaming. I fell asleep before I could cast my silencing charm. I’m sorry I woke you.” Hermione looked down at her feet as she spoke.<br/>
“Why would you cast a silencing charm if you’re just going to sleep?” Draco looked at her, confused.<br/>
Hermione kept her eyes on her feet, avoiding his gaze. “I have nightmares practically every night. I don’t always scream, but it happens enough that I do it as a precaution, so I don’t wake anyone.”<br/>
“Oh, I see. Well, goodnight.” He gave her an awkward wave and retreated to his room once more. Hermione stood in her doorway for a few seconds before turning back into her room. She cast the silencing charm, got back into bed, and slept quietly until morning.</p>
