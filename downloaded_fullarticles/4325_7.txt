    <p>Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter it belongs to J.K. Rowling, if I had owned HP I never would have had Ginny and Harry be together, wayyyy too cliche, and just like gross, it just seems like he married his sister... sorry I just forgot to add !!! 





Ginerva "Ginny" Weasley knew she was beautiful. She had over half the population of the boys in Hogwarts in her pocket. They all called her beautiful, sweet, the best fuck they'd ever had. So she couldn't understand how Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, Savior Boy, wasn't attracted to her. She'd tried her best to seduce him, pressing up against him, her ample bosom rubbing against his arm, sitting in his lap, even inviting him to spend the night in her dorm! Still he refused! She wanted to get to the bottom of this, Harry was hers, her mother would constantly tell her stories the Boy Hero defeating Voldemort when he was one year old. The Dark Lord Voldemort had been killed that fateful night 16 years ago and the Wizarding World has been living peacefully ever since. She tucked the vial of amortentia back into her pocket. Her plan was in motion.<br/>

Harry Potter knew something was wrong the moment he drank his pumpkin juice. He figured out too late that his cup was poisoned and now all he could think about was Ginny. Her skin, mouth, body, eyes, everything. He didn't want to be away from her and had the most aggravating need to do whatever she wanted of him. And she'd just told him to go to DADA. He was unconcerned with anything else. He had tunnel vision of Ginny. So when Professor Mortis asked him to stay behind, he was reasonably agitated. He wanted to be with Ginny.</p><p>Professor Victor Mortis was very worried. Harry usually paid close attention to his classes. That was one of the reasons for why he loved this class. Harry would pay attention to him and would make little suggestive faces at him and it made his day all the brighter. Today he hadn't done that and it worried him. So he asked him to stay after class so he could speak to him privately as he knew DADA was the only class Harry had in the morning, and he had an hour to spare before his next class. "Harry are you ok?"</p><p>Harry was extremely anxious to get back to Ginny. He had a burning need to be near her and the professor was holding him up! He fidgeted as he answered," yes professor Mortis, I'm fine." </p><p>Unconvinced he added," you don't seem like yourself today. What's wrong? Has something happened?" He got closer and put a hand on his lover's face. Hoping to convince him to open up to him, but instead Harry flinched away from his caress. Hurt, he retreated into himself and straightened his posture. Obviously Harry didn't want his attention today. That wasn't so unusual. He and Harry weren't "official" so to speak. Harry hadn't yet accepted this side of himself, he was still 'working it out' as he said. </p><p>"Yes I'm fine professor. I appreciate the concern, but I really must go. Have a nice day."<br/>

Later during dinner, Harry sat next to Ginny looking adoringly at her and it made Victor grit his teeth because damnit! That expression was reserved for him and he was quite possessive of it. He abruptly stood up, startling some teachers, but he just couldn't handle watching HIS Harry looking so adoringly at someone that wasn't him. He stalked down the Great Hall ignoring all the stares making his way down to his chambers.</p><p>Harry watched Professor Mortis walk down the Great Hall, his heart hurting for an unknown reason. Then Ginny was there and nothing else mattered. He ate and laughed with his friends and Ginny. When dinner was almost over, a second year Ravenclaw gave him a piece of parchment. There, written in an elegant script, was the message; </p><p>Meet at usual place. Urgent talk. TMRVM</p><p>For some inexplicable reason, he felt rather possessive of the note, and knew exactly where this person wanted to meet. He hid the note from Ginny when she tried reading it. He said goodbye and moved quickly to where the stranger wanted to meet. </p><p>He went up to the second floor bathroom, Moaning Myrtle was nowhere to be found. He hissed out in parseltounge, "Open." And went down the pipe to the Chamber. Professor Mortis was leaning against the door with the snakes and looked up when Harry entered. He walked toward him and grabbed his face in his hands, dark brown and emerald immediately clashed. His chocolate colored hair fell in waves around his face stopping at his shoulders. His sharp angular features illuminated by the light of the torches on the stone walls of the chamber. His thin lips looming ever closer to his own face, and he was helpless to stop it. He knew he loved Ginny, but couldn't help his body's burning need to be touched by professor Mortis, feel his lips against his, wanting to unite their bodies so they were one.</p><p>Their kiss was intense and passionate. Like professor Mortis was trying to tell him all his feelings through this one kiss, and he somehow knew he was. The world fell away as the only thing that truly mattered was the man holding him. He knew if anything happened to him he would be destroyed. When they pulled away from each other, the fog that took hold of his mind since coming into the chamber cleared and he suddenly remembered Ginny waiting for him up in the Gryffindor common room. Shocked at himself and desperate to get away, he pushed his professor away from him and stepped back. </p><p>Professor Mortis, caught unaware by the sudden movement, staggered back, surprised. When he looks into his lover's eyes he sees the color purple swirling in his eyes for a few seconds before it disappears. He stills, his heart freezing, panic and fear settles inside him for he recognizes the signs of one of the most potent love potions. Amortentia. The word fits itself into his brain and suddenly he starts recalling the antidote to this poison. Wiggentree twigs, castor oil, extract of gurdyroot... If the potion is left in the system for too long, the effects could mess with the victim's brain. Victor sees harry running out of the chamber and decides to let him, he will have the potion ready for him tomorrow.<br/>
