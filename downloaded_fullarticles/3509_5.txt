    <p>Bellamy Blake met her for the first time in a compartment that held more than enough room to accommodate others. She sat by herself, reading a tattered copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, by Newt Scamander. Bellamy remembered seeing such a book from a store in Diagon Alley when the Auror, Marcus Kane, brought him around to gather supplies for the school year.</p><p>The girl had been already dressed in her pristine school robes and sported newly polished slacks. Her blonde hair already tethered upon her head in an unorthodox, wild-looking braid with curls peeling out every now and then from the sides. Bellamy wondered if the girl was a first year, same as him. They could be friends if they were. She would be his very first one. After he mulled it over in his head, he decides he’d like that.</p><p>“Can I sit here?” There was no point in saying ‘please’, there was enough space for them both.</p><p>Silence. He cleared his throat and repeated the request.</p><p>The girl’s eyes widened at his sudden interruption before rising above the book’s pages. “Pardon?”</p><p>“Pardon?” Bellamy couldn't help himself from snorting. What color were they? Her eyes. Were they green or blue? They looked in between even in this compartment’s lighting. “Who talks like that?”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. “I talk like that.”</p><p>“I guess, if you’re all into the fancy life…”</p><p>“What is THAT supposed to mean?”</p><p>“I just mean that it’s stupid.”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“See? That’s much better-”</p><p>The blonde girl shut her book with enough force to make it snap. “What do you want?” They were blue. Her eyes. He could see that now. Blue like ice. The kind of ice from bergs that sank ships at sea.</p><p>Bellamy gulped. He hadn’t meant to anger her. Okay, maybe he had. “I need somewhere to sit.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And there’s no one else in here but you.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“What do you mean ‘so’? I want to sit.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Oh, for bloody- forget this!”</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>Bellamy plopped down in the seat across from her, crossing his arms at the chest and leaning way back against the seat. His head turned, facing away from her, out to the window. At children saying goodbye to their families, parting away from them. He felt the heavy weight in his chest sink lower.</p><p>“Excuse me!”</p><p>He rolled his eyes, but from the periphery he could make out the blurry indignation of a face. Her mouth looked to be agape with an outrage so petulant, so childish that it came from…well a child.</p><p>“What now?” Bellamy sighed.</p><p>“I never said you could sit down.”</p><p>“Tough eggs.” He huffed, “You don’t own the train.”</p><p>“Neither do you!”</p><p>“Yeah, but I’m not the one whinging about where I can and cannot sit.”</p><p>“Whinging? W-what are you-”</p><p>“What’s the matter?” Bellamy sneered, “You know pardon, but you don’t know whinging?”</p><p>“I do too know what it means!” The girl retorted in a shrill voice. She looked shocked by him, as if he couldn't be allowed, no, as if no one had ever talked to her like this. Ever. Bellamy wondered if that was even possible.</p><p>“Then what does it mean?”</p><p>“It means …” She trailed off, biting her lower lip and eyebrows furrowed in concentration, “… I know what it means.” She mumbled. Her blue eyes darted back and forth from left to right, up and down. As if the answer were hidden here, somewhere in the compartment with them. “It means…”</p><p>“I’m waiting, princess.”</p><p>The blonde girl bristled at that, her shoulders trembling. “DON’T call me that.” She snapped back.</p><p>“Well if the crown fits.”</p><p>“You absolute-”</p><p>Bellamy pretended that he couldn’t quite hear her, put his hand over his ear and huddled in closer.</p><p>“Pig of a toadstool-”</p><p>Mimicking her furrowed eyebrows and biting his lower lip in mock concentration.</p><p>“Stupid, hairy, smelly-”</p><p>Judging from the increase of volume and tension in her words, he could tell he was getting to her.</p><p>“TROLL!”</p><p>He nodded in appreciation, as if her biting remarks were praises instead of insults. But then pretended that whatever he heard, he just now forgot. And then asked confusedly: “Pardon?”</p><p>The blonde girl treated him as if he were a grotesque. She turned her body sideways, as far from his side of the compartment as possible so that they were diagonally apart rather than across and buried her face in her book. She didn’t speak, didn’t even spare him a glance. He didn’t even get her name. There had been a smile he gave that was sad, but something told him that she hadn't seen it.</p><p>Bellamy felt the Hogwarts Express begin to move away from Kings Cross station, no doubt spewing tar black smoke from its pipes before chugging away. He saw the families waving at the children waving from adjacent windows. Neither he nor the girl participated. He wondered if they were similar, the ones without families of their own. Bellamy grimaced. He never gave Kane his letter.</p><p>The man who found him wandering the streets all those years ago, covered in his mother’s blood and calling for his sister, Octavia but to no avail. The man who fed him, bathed him, and dressed him when no other Order of Phoenix member would. The man who had been the closest thing to a father he ever knew, would ever know. Bellamy wrote a letter to give to him, but in his trunk, it remained.</p><p>There had been no words between them after they braved Platform 9 and ¾ and they merely shook hands and exchanged nods. Kane had even clasped his hand on his shoulder for a moment, squeezing firm, before releasing him to walk onto the train. There were no words between them.</p><p>Bellamy heard the word ‘traumatized’ being thrown around when Kane first brought him back to headquarters. Words like ‘broken’ and ‘orphan’ and the phrase ‘poor Muggle child’ soon followed.</p><p>He still remembered the words that poured out of his mouth after they fed him Chocolate Frogs and butterbeer to calm his nerves. He had finished the piggy back ride Octavia had asked of him, the braided pigtail he made for her swaying with every gallop. His mother had called them for supper, her smile a respite in the filthy flat they lived in. Then the people had come to his home in the night and ripped it all apart.</p><p>That was it. That was all he remembered. He didn’t know where all the blood came from or where Octavia was or why his mother had looked like that. He didn’t cry then. In front of their leader Thelonious Jaha and Kane, who eyed his monotone explanation and inflexible body with horror.</p><p>Before blacking out, he remembered saying: “They stole Octavia. I think they took her from me.”</p><p>Kane never told him how long it took for him to get better. They brought him to St. Mungo’s and there he stayed. He slept, ate, walked around the grounds, before repeating the endless cycle for weeks and weeks. It was like jail, but people were taking care of him inside of it. Sometimes they brought him to walk in the hallways and past the rooms where there were others. Just like him.</p><p>Bellamy knew he cried. Knew he wailed and shouted and covered his ears before retreating in the corner of whatever room he was in. One time, he had been outside, and he kept backing up until he fell into the pond they had there. They moved his room to a padded one, one without any windows.</p><p>Kane was the only one who visited. Out of everyone from that bunker in the ground where they brought him to talk about what happened. Kane brought books to read. It was what he loved to do.</p><p>Every week he came and every week he read to him. Bellamy looked forward to the visits. Listened to him speak in a low, but gravely voice. Sometimes he brought his wand out and made the pages of the book transform into paper characters of whatever he was reading. Kane looked to be pulling their strings when he made them dance and fight with one another. Bellamy whooped whenever there was an enormous battle and the paper figures, smashed against themselves until they became pages again. They bonded with the paper Kane made from the stories. Watched cities form. Watched alliances crumble into betrayal. Watched love blossom between heroes and hate fester among villains. All of it had been laid out in front of him in paper.</p><p>There were, what Kane deemed, ‘Muggle’ classics: Watership Down. Lord of the Rings. Treasure Island. Robinson Crusoe. Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.</p><p>But his favorite had been when Kane asked him for a recommendation. And Bellamy recommended the Iliad and the Odyssey. Because those were stories his mother used to read him before Octavia was born. Before he had to share her love with his little sister, a love that had been all his once upon a time.</p><p>Kane agreed. And then his stories and the paper figures became the legends and myths from mythologies of old. Of gods and mortals and the trials and tribulations born from their interactions. Of Achilles. And Hector. Ajax and Odysseus. Apollo and Artemis. Zeus and Hades. Prometheus.</p><p>Bellamy still had nightmares. Still woke up screaming and crying for hours and hours before the nurses found him and the orderlies restrained him for a goodnight draught. One time he sliced his arm open with a shard of glass from the mirror he broke to see if he could turn into pages too. Could join the adventures in all the stories.</p><p>Kane stopped coming after that. He didn’t know if it was because of what he did or because St. Mungos told him not to bother anymore. Bellamy missed him. Asked for him. Never a response.</p><p>One day, Bellamy asked the nurses for some paper. He wanted so much to have his mother and sister with him. Maybe, he thought, if he put his family back together again, Kane would return. And then he would meet his mother and then become his father. Octavia would finally have a dad.</p><p>When one of the nurses came to him with dinner, they dropped the tray they were carrying. The plates and utensils smashed and clattered on the floor. Beside him had been his paper mother cradling his paper sister on the bed they assigned. His family made from all the papers he asked for. He had forgotten how he had done it. He just wished for them to return and then there they were. Kane came later that night, with Jaha, after the hospital contacted them. The two men found him with his paper family and stared in disbelief.</p><p>Bellamy began living with Kane soon after, who told him all about Hogwarts. About how it was home for him for the longest of time and he prayed that it would be the same for him. Kane told him how he too was alone for a time, just like Bellamy, when he was very young. He had been angry and sad and lost as well. It was Hogwarts that got him through it. Not just the lessons he learned and the magic he saw. But the adventures he embarked on and the friends he made along the way. Those, in his mind, were the greatest victories in all of his youth. His friends.</p><p>The train took them through the English countryside now, there were voices and footfalls and laughter from other compartments. But theirs had been silent. Dead to the rest of the world.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>The blonde girl’s already tense figure became stiller, more rigid. From the safety of her tattered book, two blue eyes slowly rose above. Cautious. Hesitant. Even scared.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have teased you about all those things.” Bellamy looked at his hands, wringing themselves together, and chewed the inside of his cheeks. “It was rude.”</p><p>She opened her mouth but closed it all the same. Her face in full view now, away from the book. Her skin pale, but smooth. Very well kept, clean. Nothing at all like him. He knew that now.</p><p>“Be my friend.” Bellamy meant for it to be a question, but it turned into a statement all the same.</p><p>The silence between them in the compartment was wider than the farms and fields the train passed.</p><p>“If you want forgiveness,” the blonde girl said cautiously, closing her book quieter than she did the last time and placing it on her lap. She inched closer to the window he leaned against and she too leaned her body against it, so they faced each other, “I can give you that. You’re forgiven.”</p><p>Bellamy released a breath he didn’t even know he was holding. He smiled at her and tentatively extended his hand towards her: “Bellamy.” The blonde girl clasped his with her own.</p><p>“Clarke.” For some reason he imagined her hand to feel smaller than his, but it felt just the same.</p>
