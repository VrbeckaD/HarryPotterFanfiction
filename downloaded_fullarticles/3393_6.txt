          <div class="userstuff"><p>Albus is a good friend. He’s never particularly <em>cared</em> about that sort of thing, especially not as a child when his only friends were his siblings and his cousins, but he's struck by how good of a friend he is as he walks to potions with Scorpius because Albus is currently enduring a nose numbing jinx for Scorpius; he can neither smell nor sneeze, all because he’s allergic to Scorpius’ cologne.</p><p>He's not allergic to anything else, no food or flowers or even muggle plastics, but ever since Scorpius came back from his summer in France, Albus hasn't been able to spend a moment around him without sniffling and sneezing. The first couple weeks of term were challenging. He had to deal with his sudden allergy <em>and</em> he couldn't let Scorpius know about it; he'd been so proud of the cologne, said it was the same brand his dad used and that he'd picked it out himself, and Albus knew that Scorpius would stop wearing it if he even <em>thought</em> that Albus didn't like it, because however good of a friend Albus is, Scorpius Malfoy is an <em>infinitely </em>better one. So Albus downs a few allergy potions a day and it's solved, or close enough to it. Of course, the allergy potions have to be refreshed every few hours, and he hadn't the time to go back to the Tower to get another before class, so he'd just turned his wand on himself to cast the jinx -- it works just as well as a potion in a pinch, even if it stings a bit and lasts for less time. Still, Albus is a great friend, so he doesn't mind.</p><p>As they arrive in potions, they split off to their separate sides of the room. In most of their shared classes, they can sit beside each other, but the potions professor insists that the houses stay separated, which is not only annoying but also superstitious bullshit. Unfortunately, Albus doesn't make the rules and he has to partner up with Panju, but at least it's only potions.</p><p>The main upside of potions is that Albus is good at it. Albus hasn't put much stock in the “disappointment” thing since he was a first year, but he can admit that potions is about the only subject that he's truly <em>great</em> at; potions doesn't involve waving a wand or saying an incantation just right and it's too involved to give people time to <em>stare</em> at him. It's the one thing that people say his dad was good at that he can do too.</p><p>Which is why when Professor Hild says they're going to make a love potion but <em>“It's a very difficult potion, don't worry if yours doesn't turn out,”</em> Albus turns to Panju with a gleam in his eyes.</p><p>“We’re going to make the best love potion ever,” He says, and Panju grins back.</p><p>“I’ve watched my dad make love potions for the shop since I was a baby. We've got this.”</p>
<hr/><p>Albus and Panju manage to finish their potion first <em>and </em>Professor Hild compliments them. After most of the class has either finished to the best of their ability or, in the case of one Slytherin pair, made their potion explode enough that Hild didn't want them trying again, Hild calls for attention.</p><p>“You all did very well and now I want to show you something,” She says. She pulls a cauldron out from under her desk and opens the top and almost immediately, Albus’ nose starts to itch.</p><p>“What <em>is</em> that?” He mutters.</p><p>Panju’s eyes are sparkling as he responds, “I don't know, but it smells <em>amazing</em>.”</p><p>“This is amortentia. It's the strongest love potion in the world,” Hild says, beckoning them all forward. Most of their classmates trip over themselves to get closer to the pot, but Albus stays back, still wary. He sniffles quietly as she continues. “It smells differently for everyone, and often changes smells throughout your life. For example, when I was young, it smelled like my mother's soup and rain, but now it smells like my wife's shampoo and mango baby food. It's all about what <em>you</em> connect to love.”</p><p>“What do you smell?” Albus asks Panju, who's stayed near the back of the crowd with him.</p><p>“ Gran's soup, and soap and gunpowder,” He says, “Like my mum after she leaves her shift at the hospital and my dad after there's been an explosion at the shop. How about you?”</p><p>Albus, against his better judgment, takes a deep breath in. “Something flowery, like how the burrow smells, and-”</p><p>Albus is cut off suddenly, as the tingle in his nose finally resolves itself into a powerful sneeze. He sneezes thrice in a row, embarrassingly loud, aware of the eyes it draws to them.</p><p>“Did you forget your allergy potion?” Panju asks. Albus nods miserably. “Do you want me to spell your nose? You wouldn't be able to smell the amortentia, but it'd work.”</p><p>“Usually I'm fine in potions, though,” Albus says. He spots Scorpius at the front of the crowd, excitedly chatting with Hild, probably about something delightfully nerdy that he’ll share with Albus later. Albus fondly rolls his eyes. “It's fine, I'm sure it's just trace amounts lingering in the air, we are close to the Slytherin side of the room right now. It'll probably fade.”</p><p>Professor Hild raises her voice again, talking about the history of amortentia and the dangers of love potions, but Albus can barely focus for trying not to sneeze. Eventually, he falters and sneezes so loudly that Panju jumps.</p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p>“Yeah, sorry,” Albus says, rubbing at his nose, “I thought I’d be fine but his cologne is just so <em>bloody</em> strong.”</p><p>Panju is quiet for a bit. Then he looks at Albus, looking uncharacteristically serious, and says, “Al, I haven't been able to smell Scorpius’ cologne this whole time.”</p><p>“What?” Albus blinks in shock, “Of course you have, it's <em>all</em> I can smell, it's almost overpowering the amortentia.”</p><p>“Oh cousin,” Panju says, looking amused, “Dear cousin. Sweet, naive, baby cousin-”</p><p>“Get to your point, Panju.”</p><p>“Have you considered that maybe the reason it's able to ‘almost overpower’ the strongest love potion known to wizards is that it <em>is</em> the amortentia?”</p><p>Albus’ mouth drops open. “No. It's- it's gotta be something else, right? I would <em>know</em> if I felt like- well, you know. You’re supposed to be able to <em>tell</em> that you’re in love.” Albus turns to Panju, though he'd been arguing with himself, and shakes his head decisively. “No, I'm just super sensitive to it.”</p><p>“You're super sensitive to <em>something</em>, alright” Panju mutters. Albus hits his arm and Panju rolls his eyes. “Relax, Al, it's not that bad. At least you know. Though, I've got to say, not noticing even when it's<em> literally</em> the smell you associate with love is <em>next level </em>oblivious.”</p><p>“Shut up, I'm not oblivious,” Albus shoots back, but his mind is already racing. He's thinking of scrambling to write Scorpius letters as quickly as possible so he could get a response; he's thinking of firecalls that went on for <em>hours</em> until one of their parents made them get off the floo; he's thinking about how his heart raced when he saw Scorpius, gangly and dorky and utterly <em>adorable</em>, on the train platform; he's thinking of how his stomach flips whenever he and Scorpius bump hands in the corridors. He’s thinking about how he's spent half a year <em>hiding an allergy</em> so Scorpius would be happy. <em>Merlin</em>.</p><p>“I'm not oblivious,” He repeats weakly, mostly for himself.</p><p>Professor Hild puts the top back on her amortentia, to groans of many students. Albus vaguely registers that the urge to sneeze immediately disappears, but he's too busy panicking to appreciate it. She tuts, “I know, but it's not healthy to dwell on the things amortentia promises you. Better to go out into the world and experience things that you love in person, I think.”</p><p>As soon as she finishes speaking, Scorpius turns around and catches Albus’ eye, like he'd been attuned to Albus’ presence. Albus feels his face heat.</p><p>“You're all pink,” Panju says, singsong and saccharine. Albus flushes more, scowling.</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Scorpius weaves his way over to them. Panju, who’s kinder than Albus gives him credit for, casts a quick and mostly painless nose numbing jinx on Albus.</p><p>“I think that was my favorite lesson so far, even more than the History of Magic class where we got to read a restricted book,” Scorpius says.</p><p>“High praise,” Panju replies, his tone dry. <em>No one</em> likes History of Magic like Scorpius does but Albus still feels a bit offended on Scorpius’ behalf for the sarcasm. “But anyway, what did you smell?”</p><p>“Old books and my mum’s gardens,” Scorpius says happily. Panju shoots Albus an apologetic look and Albus can feel a sneer growing on his face. <em>It figures</em>, he supposes, <em>that Scorpius’ view of love would be books and home</em>; really, Albus doesn't know why he even <em>thought</em> that he'd be a part of- “Oh! And you, actually, Albus.”</p><p>Albus chokes on his tongue. “I- what?”</p><p>“Just a bit,” Scorpius continues, ignorant of the turmoil he's causing, “Like that terrible orange drink you like, and like your owl, and like the paper you use when you write me over breaks, you know, the minty paper?”</p><p>Albus does know. He used it at first because his mum only had scented parchment when he asked to borrow some to write to Scorpius, and James had made a joke about love letters and the floral parchment. Then, Scorpius mentioned how much he liked it, and Albus had been using his pocket money to get more ever since.</p><p>“That's a lot of Albus,” Panju observes, very nearly pulling off sounding innocent. Albus glares at him but only receives a sunny grin in response.</p><p>Scorpius seems almost shocked by someone pointing it out, his ears pinkening as he says, “I guess. Well, it's only fair.”</p><p>“Only fair?” Albus asks, heartbeat quickening.</p><p>“Of course,” Scorpius says, bumping Albus’ shoulder with his own. “You're my very best mate, of course my brain would connect you to love.”</p><p>“I- same,” Albus says, sure that he's red by now, “With the connection, that is. I mean, you were my smell too? And you're obviously my best mate too.”</p><p>Scorpius’ grin is blinding. He and Albus just stare at each other, Scorpius grinning and Albus mentally berating himself for <em>sounding like a bloody idiot, what the hell was that?</em> until Panju clears his throat. Scorpius clears his throat as well, nodding at Panju. “Well, I'll see you at dinner?”</p><p>“Yeah, see you then,” Albus responds. He and Panju head back to grab their bags. The moment they're in the hall, Panju bursts out laughing.</p><p>“Sod off!” Albus says, elbowing him. Panju just laughs harder.</p><p>“You two are <em>absolutely</em> perfect for each other. ‘You're my very best mate,’ he said, <em>Merlin</em>, it was almost too much!”</p><p>“You're the worst,” Albus says, walking a bit faster and leaving Panju behind. He has to go up to the Tower and put an allergy potion in his bag for dinner, anyway.</p><p>“Love you too, cuz!” Panju yells back.</p><p>Albus lifts his hand so Panju can see Albus flipping him off. Still, all while he travels through the castle, Scorpius’ words bounce around in his head. If Scorpius subconsciously relates him to love too then maybe… Maybe Albus can actually do something about this.</p></div>
