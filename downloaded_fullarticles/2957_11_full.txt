  <em>Clink. Clink. Clink-click-clackkkk-k-k-ACK!</em>
</p><p>With a whir and a snap, the sides of the cube fell into place, and a warm glow filled the room.</p><p>“Wow, Cho,” Harry breathed out. “You've done it.”</p><p>Cho turned the cube this way and that, admiring her handiwork. “Wasn't that hard, once you figured out there was a spell on the pins. Bit of genius there, Harry.”</p><p>“It just made sense.” Harry reached out to stroke one side of the smooth metal cube. The etched golden swirls and stars that covered the outside pulsed lightly, and Harry smiled. “Mrs Teaswell is going to be happy to have this back. It’s been in her family —”</p><p>“— for two hundred years, I know. She mentions it in every owl.” Cho rolled her eyes. “You think she’d trust us without checking in three times a week. We are the best, after all.”</p><p>Harry nodded in agreement, taking the small cube and holding it gently. He could feel the magic inside, now working properly: the imprint of two hundred years and generations of Teaswells. Harry felt the rush of accomplishment that came with a successful job, whether repair or discovery; it was a simple pleasure without dire consequences for failure. This wasn’t a Dark object that needed to be tracked down and destroyed. It was only a box for holding keys, that was to be used in emergencies by children that had been locked out of the house and were too young to use a wand to pass through the wards: the equivalent of a Muggle false rock for the doorstep.</p><p>The bell over the door tinkled lightly, and Harry set the cube down as he turned towards the sound.</p><p>“Welcome to Art and — oh, Gin, it’s you.”</p><p>“Don't sound so disappointed.” Ginny threw her practice bag down on the floor, Quidditch gear and bits of grass scattering out of the open end as she approached the counter. “Oh! Did you fix that weird box?” She peered around his shoulder, and Harry took the opportunity to pinch her.</p><p>“It's a key cube, not a box. And stop tossing your dirty equipment on my floor.” She pinched him back, and he yelped, then laughed. “Why were you practising, anyway? You won the game this weekend, take a break.”</p><p>“Gwenog doesn't understand the word <em>break</em>. We have to be back this afternoon. The semi-finals are next month, in any case. Got to stay on point.” She gave Cho a wink. “You ever get sick of this tosser, come try out.”</p><p>Cho rolled her eyes, but smiled. “I’m fine here. Keep winning, though; I bet a good chunk of Galleons on the Harpies to win the League Cup this year.”</p><p>“Nice to see someone is on our side. Ron still thinks the Cannons will pull it off. Disloyal sibling, that one.”</p><p>Harry made for the coat rack near the door. “Speaking of your brothers, I’m supposed to see Bill for lunch. He finally broke the curse on the chest I found in Devonshire this winter.”</p><p>“New site?” Ginny asked with interest. “Or old one, in any case.”</p><p>“Luna tipped me off about it. She was reading through old journals of an explorer who’d been hunting down… honestly, I can’t remember what animal. But he mentioned camping overnight near a cairn that isn’t on any current maps. Most of the stones are gone now, but there was residual magic, and I managed to get down into the concealed area.”</p><p>“What Harry is trying to say is he dug up a grave,” Cho said dryly.</p><p>“There weren’t any bodies,” Harry protested. “And the chest was cursed. If someone less prepared had come along, it would have ended badly.”</p><p>“So what was inside?”</p><p>“Only your brother knows. I couldn’t open it myself, the curse was a bit advanced for me.” Harry shrugged his jacket on. “You can come see for yourself, if you like. Cho?”</p><p>Cho shook her head. “No, I need to owl Mrs Teaswell so she can finally pick this up. I’ll see whatever spoils you’ve found soon enough.”</p><p>“Come on Gin, I’ll treat you to ice cream.” Harry held the door open and Ginny laughed.</p><p>“You’re the best ex-boyfriend around.” As she gathered her gear up, Harry glanced with pride at the framed <em>Prophet</em> article by the door.</p><p align="center">
  <em>Harry Potter Opens New Shop in Diagon Alley </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>After defying expectations and declining employment with the Aurors following his initial training, we have waited eagerly to hear what the next move would be for our no-longer-a-boy hero. Wonder no more, dear readers. Today his newest venture opens its doors right here in London. Art and Artefact will offer repair and disenchantment services for magical objects as well as restoration for portraits and tapestries. Do not be fooled by the name, as this is not simply a curio shop. Reports of Mr Potter’s daring exploits in ancient tombs and ruins across Britain and beyond seem to have been true, as he is also taking requests by appointment for research and expeditions. Joining him at the shop are Ms Cho Chang, recently certified as a Master Artificer, and Mrs Lavender Brown-Patil, formerly employed with Atelier Fameux in Art Restoration. We wish Mr Potter and his colleagues the best of luck.</em>
</p><hr/><p>At Gringotts, Bill had good news and bad news.</p><p>“Nice to see you again, Harry. Feels like it’s been ages. You too, Gin.”</p><p>“Quidditch,” she shrugged, as Harry simultaneously answered, “Work.”</p><p>Bill rolled his eyes. “Those excuses can only keep Mum satisfied for long. You’d better both be there on Sunday.” They nodded, chastised, and he continued. “The good news is that most of this stuff is just standard valuables. Jewelry, chalices, that sort of thing.” He gestured to a pile of shining gold and silver objects strewn over the table. “You can sell them in the shop as antiques, or donate them to a museum, although I’m not sure what historical value they have.”</p><p>“And what’s the bad news?” Harry asked, shooing Ginny back from the open chest. She stuck her tongue out at him. It was coloured pink from the strawberry ice cream they’d eaten at the reopened Fortescue’s.</p><p>“The bad news,” Bill sighed as he drew a gleaming sword out from a sheath, “is I have no idea what this says, and therefore no idea what it does.”</p><p>“Wow,” Harry breathed, reaching for the sword. He could sense a swirl of magic around the blade — nothing malicious, but powerful all the same, twisting through the steel. “Merlin, do you feel that?”</p><p>Bill frowned. “I didn’t feel anything. Do you think it’s a subtle curse?”</p><p>“No.” Harry couldn’t explain it, but the sword didn’t seem evil. “I’ll need to take this back to the shop, work with it a bit. Cho may have some ideas.”</p><p>“I’ve got to get to afternoon practice,” Ginny said, giving both Harry and Bill a quick kiss on the cheek. “Thanks for letting me see your shiny things! I like the sharp one best.” With a grin she was off.</p><p>“I’d best get back to work, also,” Bill said, levitating the hoard into the long chest. “The goblins don’t approve of me pursuing my own projects on company time. Bad enough I met you in my office on lunch. Anytime you have freelance work, though, I’m game. That chest was quite a challenge. Are you really coming to the Burrow this Sunday?” Harry nodded. “Just you?”</p><p>Harry’s shoulders slumped. “If that’s your way of asking if I’ve been seeing anyone, the answer is still no. I’m busy, Bill, you know that. You can tell Molly, as well.” Bill grinned with a blush, clearly knowing he’d been caught out checking up on Harry for his mum.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Harry. She just worries. You know you’ll meet someone right for you eventually, yeah?”</p><p>That was easy for Bill to say; he and Fleur were perfectly suited. Harry was far more pessimistic about his romantic prospects. Every date he went on seemed to fail, every possible relationship fizzled. The <em>Prophet</em> may have insinuated that Harry's bisexuality meant even more people had a chance with him, but to Harry it just meant that many more chances to strike out.</p><p>“Everyone I meet seems to think I’m someone I’m not. It’s hard to get to know someone else when they assume they already know <em>you</em>," he told Bill, unable to keep a wistful note from his voice.</p><p>Bill smiled sympathetically. “You <em>have</em> lived most of your life in the public eye. But you’re not doing yourself any favours. You travel all the time, you’ve plenty of opportunity to talk to new people.”</p><p>Harry gave Bill a weak smile. “How about I try harder with the people I already know, yeah? I’ll see you Sunday.”</p><hr/><p>The sword yielded none of its secrets back at the shop. Harry couldn’t shake the notion that there was an enchantment laid on the blade, but Cho didn’t feel anything.</p><p>“I don’t have your talent for sensing magic, Harry,” she said as she turned the sword this way and that. “No one does, really. And these runes are absolutely baffling. I’ve cross-referenced every dictionary I have, and there are some similar languages, but no exact match. Didn’t Luna point you to this site?”</p><p>So later after dinner, Harry found himself calling Luna on the Floo. She tended to work all night, so he knew he wouldn’t be waking her.</p><p>The fire flickered as Luna answered. “Oh, hello Harry. I didn’t expect to hear from you today.”</p><p>“Hey, Luna. How are you?”</p><p>“Oh, very well. I’m working on a new story about Mottled Marvellenes for the next issue of the <em>Quibbler</em>. Have you heard of them?”</p><p>“Er, can't say that I have. Look, I wondered if you found anything else about the Devonshire site in that journal, the one about the search for the, the…”</p><p>“The Vospul Bat nesting grounds?” Harry nodded as if he understood. “No, I’m sorry, Harry. There wasn’t anything else. Why, did you find the site?”</p><p>“I did. There were some small items, cups, rings, that sort of thing. And a sword engraved with runes I can’t understand. They don’t seem to be in any books.”</p><p>“Oooh, a mystery.” Luna smiled dreamily. “Why don’t you ask Draco for help?”</p><p>Harry blinked, sure he'd misheard. “I’m sorry, you mean Malfoy?” It felt strange to say that name again after all these years, the vowels rounding in Harry’s mouth like the words to a long-forgotten song.</p><p>“That’s the only Draco I know. Why, is there another? That would be interesting.”</p><p>Harry shook his head in confusion. Luna still spoke to Malfoy? He’d always assumed — not that he thought about Malfoy ever, of course not — that the other man had slipped off to live in whatever manner high society pure-bloods did, far away from Harry’s social circles. He’d nodded sharply at Harry once after his trial, a brief yet definitive thanks for the testimony, and then vanished from Harry’s life. Which was jarring, now that Harry considered it; Malfoy had been a presence for seven years, then suddenly just… wasn't. How would Harry speak to him after all this time?</p><p>“Why ask him for help? Is he some sort of expert on swords?” He imagined Malfoy fencing, a proper stuffy sport for a rich brat like him.</p><p>Luna cocked her head. “You didn’t know? Draco translates things. He’s helped me with a lot of old books. Naturalists sometimes like to write in code so they don’t give away secret locations of animals.”</p><p>"As like… a hobby?" Malfoy didn't need to work a day in his life after all.</p><p>Eyes wide, Luna stared at him in that way that made Harry feel as if he were a particularly interesting specimen of Wrackspurt. "As a career."</p><p>"Huh." Harry tried to picture it: Malfoy bent over a dusty book, blond hair falling into his face, tongue poked out like Hermione's when she was concentrating on a particularly challenging puzzle. His mental image made him blush hotly. “Don’t you know anyone else?”</p><p>“Sorry, Harry. Draco is the best because he studied with several different people instead of concentrating on one ancient language. He’s also an expert cryptographer.”</p><p>Expert was exactly what Harry needed, although he privately doubted Malfoy fell into that category. Luna was often too kind in her assessment of people. Still, if Harry didn't cover every avenue, he wouldn't feel as if he'd done a proper job.</p><p>“I suppose it won’t hurt to call him,” he said hesitantly, rather sure it would end up hurting somehow — his pride, or maybe his face if Malfoy was in a hexing mood. “The Manor, right? Do you have his Floo address?”</p><p>“Hmm, that’s very private, Harry. He's left the Manor. I do have his actual address, if you’d like to stop by. He prefers not to receive owls.”</p><p>Of course Luna would think it was less private to show up on Malfoy’s doorstep rather than just call him. “Fine, where is that?”</p><p>“In Surrey. I have it written down, give me a moment.”</p><p>“<em>Surrey</em>? Why does he live in Surrey? What happened to the Manor?” Luna simply shrugged mysteriously.</p><p>“That's not my story to tell. You'll have to ask Draco.” She smiled serenely. “I’m sure he’ll be just as pleased to see you. You have so much to catch up on.”</p><p><em>Pleased</em> wasn’t exactly how Harry would have described it. Still, he couldn’t ignore the small frisson of excitement that ran up his spine. As soon as Luna had mentioned Malfoy, Harry found his interest piquing as it used to. Last time they’d been face to face, Malfoy had looked so young and yet old beyond his years, and both exhausted and relieved. Had he changed much since then?</p><hr/><p>The address Luna provided was near Dorking, to Harry’s relief. Bad enough he had to return to Surrey; if Malfoy had ended up in Little Whinging he would have called the whole thing off. The street was well-appointed, but decidedly Muggle, which only added to Harry’s confusion as he approached the house and braced himself.</p><p>Knocking on Malfoy’s door shouldn’t be so hard. He wasn't intimidating, or threatening; he was only Draco Malfoy, coward and first-class snob, right?</p><p>The door itself was painted a light shade of green, and the mat out front read <em>Wipe Your Paws</em>. The knocker seemed handmade, a collection of mismatched ceramic flowers, but was sturdy enough when Harry used it. After a moment the door swung open but no one stood behind it.</p><p>“Come in,” Malfoy’s posh voice echoed from the knocker, startling the hell out of Harry. “I’m in the study just off the top of the stairs.”</p><p>The house was cosier than Harry would have expected from Malfoy, and strewn with even more books than Hermione’s own little library in the house she shared with Ron. The stairs were easy to spot, through the sitting room, and Harry ascended them cautiously. Why didn’t Malfoy come down to greet him? Did he not actually mind Harry traipsing through his home? Harry found himself growing more curious as he came to the top of the stairs and turned the corner into an office.</p><p>Malfoy sat at a desk in the corner, scratching a quill along one piece of parchment while surrounded by several others, including a pile on the floor. He didn't look quite as Harry had briefly imagined — there was no dust on any books, and no tongue to be seen — but his hair <em>was</em> loose and falling in his eyes. No longer pointed and pinched looking, the past few years seemed to have settled onto Malfoy’s angular face quite well. He glanced up, seemingly unsurprised to see Harry, then went back to whatever he was writing; he appeared nonchalant, but his foot was tapping nervously.</p><p>“Hullo, Potter,” he said without looking back up. “What can I do for you?”</p><p>Before Harry could get a word out, the pile of parchment seemed to explode outwards, scattering papers across the room. Malfoy didn’t budge, but Harry, already on edge, jumped about a foot in the air as a large reddish-coloured cat ran past his legs and into the hall.</p><p>“Was that a cat?” Harry asked dumbly. Of course it was a cat, he saw it with his own eyes. He just didn’t think of Malfoy as the cat-owning type.</p><p>“That’s Rhubarb,” Malfoy explained patiently, as if he saw this kind of scene several times a day. “He likes to hide under the parchment. Probably decided to check the food bowl for a tiny piece he possibly missed, not that he didn’t check an hour ago, and an hour before that. He’s never been one to be dissuaded by the concept of mealtimes. Now as I said, what can I do for you?”</p><p>Harry opened his mouth to reply but was interrupted a second time by a sneeze at his feet. It was another cat. Another one! This one was grey with white patches, and rather skinny. It looked up at Harry balefully, then sneezed again, this time on his trainers.</p><p>“Cardamom,” Malfoy said, anticipating Harry’s question. “He isn’t feeling well.” That was an understatement; the cat looked older than Crookshanks and was wobbling slightly. Having inspected the new house guest to his liking, the cat turned around and slowly made its way back down the hall.</p><p>“Are you busy?" Harry gestured to the parchment on the desk. "I can come back.” Malfoy arched a brow, and Harry finally noticed the <em>reading glasses</em> perched on the tip of his nose. Malfoy looked like a little old lady, in glasses, surrounded by scrolls and cats. Had he really become a mild scholar in the years that had passed?</p><p>“I wouldn’t have told you to come up if I was too busy. Are you going to get to it, or do you want to gawk at my cats some more?”</p><p>Nope, still Malfoy.</p><p>"I'm done with the cats," Harry grumbled, moving further into the room. Malfoy swivelled around in his chair and gestured for Harry to take a seat that he didn’t notice before, a plush green one in the corner. The entire room looked rather comfortable, in fact, from the chairs to the soft knitted jumper Malfoy wore — and to Harry’s discomfort, he was rather handsome in it.</p><p>"For the third time, what brings you here to interrupt my work?"</p><p>"I just <em>asked</em> if you were too—"</p><p>"I'm always busy, Potter. I'm in demand." Malfoy's face was smug, although it didn't make him ugly the way it did some men. "The level of my work is low enough that I may entertain whatever strange request you likely have for me, but make no mistake, I <em>am</em> working."</p><p>"I knew you had work,” Harry huffed. “I just didn’t think you actually… worked. Do you even have to?”</p><p>Malfoy flushed. “You think I spent all that time in my practicum, choking over dust in various libraries, to just lie about the Manor? I don’t even want to set <em>foot</em> there, I—” He stopped speaking abruptly, and Harry felt he’d been about to reveal more than he intended.</p><p>All he managed to say was, "Dust, eh?"</p><p>Malfoy looked at him strangely. "Yes, quite. Now get to it."</p><p>Right. Harry wasn’t here for a social call. “Luna says you’re a translator now. I need something translated.”</p><p>“I’m not a run of the mill ‘translator,’ Potter. If you’ve found some common book you need parsed into English, there are better people for the job. Less skilled people.”</p><p>Harry gritted his teeth. “This isn’t common. I don’t even know what language it is. Looks like runes of some kind, but Bill didn’t recognise them, and they aren’t in the standard references.”</p><p>Malfoy arched a brow. “Non-standard runes? You need to look further than translation books, then, into biographies. Many wizards historically developed their own systems of writing for taking notes.”</p><p>“It’s not notes on parchment. They’re on a sword.”</p><p>That seemed to catch his attention for real, and Malfoy leaned in, a swoop of blond swinging in his face. “A <em>sword</em> you say? Is it ornamental? Ceremonial? Functional or not? Is it—”</p><p>“I took a photo at the shop. Here.” Harry handed over the photograph, and their fingers brushed. He drew back quickly, but Malfoy didn’t seem to notice as he watched Harry in the photo show the front of the sword, then the back, looping infinitely. He studied it carefully for a long moment, and Harry thought he might have seen a hint of pink tongue peeking out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>"You should have brought a Muggle photograph."</p><p>Harry was sure his mouth must be hanging open. "Muggle?" <em>Who are you and what have you done with Malfoy?</em></p><p>"Yes," Malfoy continued, blissfully unaware of the crisis happening in Harry's head. "It's difficult to concentrate on the runes with your hands turning the sword this way and that. Nice polish by the way," he threw out casually, imploding Harry's world further.</p><p>"Thanks," Harry answered faintly. "I let Teddy paint them to match his."</p><p>"My cousin?" A strange expression passed over Malfoy's face, longing and regret and nostalgia all mixed up. Harry could only nod. There were decades of family issues hidden in that look, and it wasn't something he felt comfortable addressing. Still, it was one more facet of this new Malfoy to catch the light, slowly illuminating the person he'd become.</p><p>Malfoy shook his head as if to clear it, and turned his attention back to the photograph. “I’ll need to examine this in person. Placement of letters, intent of use, these things matter in decoding. May I handle the sword? It’s not cursed, is it?”</p><p>“You just saw a photo of me holding it, Malfoy.”</p><p>“Yes, but you are so often the exception to the rule.”</p><p>Harry blinked. “I — OK, yeah, I could bring it by.”</p><p>“I can come to your shop, if you like.”</p><p>“Would you really — how do you know I have a shop?”</p><p>“Everyone who has even glanced at the <em>Prophet</em> the past few years knows you have a shop, Potter. It’s lovely to see the papers never lost their enchantment with you.” Malfoy smirked, adding, “Also you literally just told me you took that photo <em>at your shop</em>.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. “Fine. Yeah, come by. I just didn’t think you’d want to. I’ve haven’t seen you in Diagon lately.”</p><p>"Merlin, Potter, I'm not a shut in. I leave the house. I just don't see any reason to socialise with old friends, or make new ones, really.”</p><p>It was probably for the best that Malfoy didn’t speak to anyone he’d called a friend in the past. “Just you and the cats?”</p><p>“Don’t let them hear you call them ‘just cats,’ you’ll end up with a hairball in your shoe.”</p><p>“Good thing I didn’t take them off at the door, then.”</p><p>“Yes, your ability to be a complete boor continues to astound me.” Malfoy waved in the direction of the door. “And now you’ve overstayed your welcome, so toddle on back to whatever deadly task awaits you this evening. Pulling teeth from a dragon or some such, I’m sure.”</p><p>“Jealous?” A strange glint in Malfoy’s eyes told Harry that he’d hit the mark.</p><p>“Just be ready for me tomorrow. I’ll come by at eleven.” He swung back around in his chair dismissively, sleek hair following his face a moment behind.</p><p>“Fine.” Harry rose to his feet and made his way back downstairs, mindful of any cats. He was annoyed that he needed Malfoy, but even more annoyed that the prat had turned out <em>cute</em>, and so many things about him now had Harry wildly curious. He couldn’t follow him around using a map now that they were adults — he’d just have to wait to see him at the shop.</p><hr/><p>Telling Lavender and Cho that they could expect a visit from Malfoy did not go exactly as Harry planned.</p><p>"So what you're saying is he's fit."</p><p>"I — <em>what</em>?" Harry sputtered. “Everything I told you, and <em>that's</em> what you conclude?"</p><p>Lavender giggled, looking up from the portrait she was retouching. "Most of what you told me was how he looked. Merlin, Harry, I know you like a pretty bloke as much as I do, but I never thought you'd go for Malfoy."</p><p>Harry leaned against the wall, crossing his arms sulkily. "I'm not 'going for' him. I just said he looked different."</p><p>"Yes, with, and I quote, a <em>Healthy glow, and his hair's grown out, kind of in his face.</em>"</p><p>The old man that Lavender was giving a touch up laughed under her brush. "You've got it bad, son."</p><p>"Oh, shut it," Harry grumbled. "What do you know? You haven't been shagged in a hundred years." The wizard made an indignant noise, and Lavender glanced at Harry with a smug smile.</p><p>"I never said anything about shagging. Interesting that's where your mind goes."</p><p>Harry pushed off the wall with a huff and stalked out of the room. "You'd better behave when Malfoy shows up," he threw out over his shoulder. Lavender shared a secret look with the old wizard. She would do no such thing.</p><p>Cho wasn’t any better. “I thought you gave up following Malfoy at school,” she noted dryly, using a small pick that she’d charmed with a permanent <em>Lumos</em> to probe around the inner workings of a music box.</p><p>“Not you, too,” Harry groaned. “Look, Malfoy supposedly knows his stuff, so we’ll have him examine the sword and that’s it.”</p><p>“Whatever you do, don’t you <em>dare</em> start hexing each other in here,” she warned, pointing the illuminated pick straight at Harry. “You’ll hit something volatile and blow us all to bits.”</p><p>“I’m not going hex him, and I’m not going to shag him!”</p><p>Cho went back to her work with a smirk. “Who said anything about shagging?”</p><p>A ring of the bell above the door put an end to their banter, signalling the arrival of the topic at hand. Malfoy was dressed in a silver trimmed travelling cloak, wearing what appeared to be snakeskin boots. It was a far cry from the comfortable scholar look he’d sported in his own home. Harry supposed the display of wealth was Malfoy’s own sort of armour, donned especially for venturing out in Diagon.</p><p>“Potter, Chang,” Malfoy nodded at them both. “Where should I hang my cloak?”</p><p>“Oh, er, there’s a hook on the door behind you,” Harry said, uncharacteristically nervous. This was <em>his</em> territory, he should be on more solid footing. This was all Lavender and Cho’s fault, for teasing him. Now he wasn’t going to be able to look Malfoy in the face without thinking of <em>shagging</em> him.</p><p>Underneath the cloak, Malfoy was more as he’d been at home — grey knitted jumper, pressed trousers. He approached the counter expectantly. “Well, let’s see it, then.”</p><p>“Ah, right.” Harry waved at the door, turning the sign to <em>Closed</em> with a wave. “It’s just back here.” He led Malfoy to a small office that was used as a storeroom, filled with various items obtained on his travels around the world. Malfoy glanced around, obviously impressed but trying not to show it.</p><p>“Quite the collection you’ve got here. I suppose the <em>Prophet</em> wasn't lying about all your adventures. This certainly isn’t your average repair shop, is it?”</p><p>“The <em>Prophet</em> isn’t the best source of news usually, but yeah, I see a fair bit of excitement. Unlike you.”</p><p>Malfoy bristled. “I already told you, I’m not a shut-in!”</p><p>“No, but I had no idea what you were doing these past years. Never heard one word about you.”</p><p>“Not all of us can be fame seekers like you, Potter.” Malfoy crossed his arms and began to lean back against the shelves, then jerked upright as he thought better of it; they were jammed full and looked about to tip over any moment. Harry had been meaning to clean up in here. He glared at Malfoy, and crossed his arms as well.</p><p>“It isn’t for <em>fame</em>. I don’t care if anyone else even talks about what I do!”</p><p>“In that case you’d have no customers.”</p><p>“The repair and disenchantment services are separate from my expeditions. People recommend me based on word of mouth, on results. Not any kind of fame.”</p><p>“What exactly made you decide to pursue this line of work anyway?” Malfoy asked, running his hand along an embossed silver plate. “I’d figured you as an Auror. Didn’t you start training?”</p><p>Harry looked away, not wanting Malfoy to see the discomfort on his face. “This was a better fit,” he said shortly, approaching a table. “Here, this is it.” He pulled back a cloth to reveal the sword. Malfoy whistled lowly, and reached out to tentatively lift it.</p><p>“It’s no Sword of Gryffindor, is it? Rather dull. Not well balanced, either.” Despite insulting the blade, Malfoy seemed curiously pleased to be holding it. He took a few experimental swipes at the air as Harry jumped back.</p><p>“I didn’t bring you here to go do battle with it! I just want to know what it says.”</p><p>“Right.” Blushing, Malfoy put the sword back down and leaned in close. “You weren’t lying, these are unusual symbols. They aren’t true ‘runes’ at all.” He felt in his pocket for something, and drew out a small pair of glasses, which he perched on the end of his sharp nose. “I can tell right away that whoever engraved them was used to writing in a rounder script, like Latin, and on parchment—”</p><p>“Wait, how?”</p><p>“By the way the strokes are constructed.” Malfoy pointed to one corner of a rune, but Harry wasn’t sure what he was supposed to be looking at. “Someone used to writing in an angular runic alphabet, like Anglo-Frisian for example, would have gone about this all differently. That means it’s likely of a later period, after Latin became common. Perhaps someone tried to make up their own runes based on an older script.”</p><p>“Why would they do that?”</p><p>“Plenty of reasons. Keeping secrets only among those who know the symbols, breaking away and starting their own community, amusement. And that’s before getting into the magical properties of creating alphabets — it’s like sigils, they can be imbued with power.”</p><p>Harry stared at the sword with a newfound appreciation. “Can you feel it, then? That sort of… pulse? I’m not quite sure how to explain it.” Malfoy stared at him strangely. “Right, guess it’s only me, then.”</p><p>“Perhaps you’re the one who needs to socialise more. You’re beginning to converse with your artefacts.” That hit a bit close to home. Harry clenched his fists as Malfoy continued to peer at the runes, stroking them this way and that. The look of wonder on Malfoy’s face had Harry softening a bit. It was obvious the prospect of a mystery to solve had piqued his interest</p><p>“Why’d you become a translator anyway?” Surely there was a story there.</p><p>“I’d consider myself more of a linguist. And because… translating something for the first time, or breaking the encryption on a code — it’s a puzzle, but all in the mind. Nothing to explode or harm me, like Curse-Breakers deal with. And nothing…” Malfoy bit his lip. “Nothing that harms other people.” Abruptly Harry thought of the Vanishing Cabinet that Malfoy had worked so hard to repair.</p><p>Now Harry thought he understood. Malfoy appreciated a challenge, but nothing too high stakes — his younger days had been filled with life or death decisions, after all.</p><p>“Do you think you can translate it, then?”</p><p>“Decipher, really. And possibly. I need to consult several of my own books. May I take this with me?” Harry gestured toward the sword with an open hand.</p><p>“That’s fine.”</p><p>Malfoy looked a bit surprised, as if he’d been expecting Harry to deny him, and wrapped the sword back up. “I appreciate your trust,” he said softly.</p><p>They emerged back out into the front room to find Lavender and Cho looking suspiciously idle. “Any luck?” Lavender asked eagerly. Malfoy eyed her with a wary expression.</p><p>“It’s going to take some research.”</p><p>“Will you and Harry be working together?” Harry made a face at her from behind Malfoy, trying to get her to shut up.</p><p>Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “No? Potter asked me for help precisely because he has no idea what he’s doing.”</p><p>“I know a bit,” Harry grumbled. “I could tell they were runes.”</p><p>“They aren’t, in fact. Were you listening?”</p><p>“Maybe he was distracted,” Lavender supplied. “It’s rather easy to catch his attention with something new and shiny.” She could have meant the sword, but Harry knew what she really meant, and aimed a rude gesture at her behind Malfoy’s back. He remained blissfully unaware and went for his cloak on back of the door.</p><p>“I’ll Floo the shop to let you know how it’s going,” he said politely, pulling the silver-trimmed hood up and hiding his distinctive hair.</p><p>Suddenly, Harry knew what would happen. Malfoy would take the sword back to his home, pore over it until he’d teased out whatever secrets it held, then return it and go about his way. Harry would have no cause to see him again. For some reason this didn’t sit right with Harry; he was still curious about so many things. <em>Why a neighbourhood where owls would be suspicious? And why the cats?</em> Harry found himself stepping forward.</p><p>“We could talk about any progress you’ve made next weekend, if you like.”</p><p>Malfoy shook his head. “I’d rather not put a time limit on it, these things have a way of being more complicated than expected.”</p><p>“No, I mean… Gin’s got a game, I have tickets. If you haven’t seen a Quidditch game for a while… Might be nice.” Behind the counter, Cho’s eyebrows flew up, but she remained silent.</p><p>Malfoy opened his mouth, and Harry knew from his pinched expression that the answer would be no. But just as quickly, he closed it, and almost shyly glanced away.</p><p>“I suppose I could stand some fresh air.”</p><p>“Great!” Harry nodded, perhaps a bit too vigorously. “I’ll stop by your place and we can Apparate together.”</p><p>As soon as the door closed behind Malfoy, Lavender giggled maniacally and darted back to her workshop. Cho turned to Harry. “What was that?! Did you just ask Malfoy out on a date?”</p><p>“What? No!” Harry reddened. “I just… I haven’t seen him in so long, it could be nice to catch up.”</p><p>“You were hardly friends, Harry.” As if he needed to be reminded.</p><p>“He seems different, that’s all.”</p><p>Cho rolled her eyes. “Seems like he grew into his arse, you mean.”</p><p>“That’s <em>not</em> what I mean,” Harry said firmly. He hadn’t even looked at said arse. If Malfoy had grown into his face, that was another thing entirely. “It might be good to have a working relationship with a translator, anyway.”</p><p>“Whatever you tell yourself to sleep at night.” Cho returned to the music box, but not before adding, “And whatever you tell Ginny when you show up at her game with Malfoy.”</p><p>Oh. Oh,<em> bollocks</em>.</p><hr/><p>Over the next week and a half Harry second-guessed his invitation to Malfoy until it was the only thing on his mind. What had come over him? The Saturday of the game he found himself reading <em>Wipe Your Paws</em> again, still filled with doubts and anticipation.</p><p>The doormat made more sense to Harry this time around. He used the ceramic flower knocker, and Malfoy’s voice issued forth again. “I’ll be right down.”</p><p>He appeared in the doorway with the same travelling cloak, although without the fancy boots, and an anxious expression. His voice didn’t give away any nerves, however. “I’m ready to leave if you are.”</p><p>“Yeah, course. That’s a neat trick with the knocker, making it talk like that. Why flowers?”</p><p>“Luna made it, you’d have to ask her. My voice is simply a projection spell. Since I can’t set wards to be open to certain guests, I have to rely on the door to tell me who is here. It’s an easy thing, just combining a remote viewing spell with the projection and <em>Alohomora</em>.”</p><p>“Why can’t you set wards?” Harry asked as Malfoy turned to lock the door behind himself, their proximity a bit close on the small porch.</p><p>Malfoy looked at him strangely. “I’m not allowed to. My probation?”</p><p>“Still?” Malfoy’s trial seemed like a distant memory to Harry. He’d been exhausted and depressed in the aftermath of the war, and only testified because he’d been requested to do so by Malfoy’s solicitor. He did remember how quiet Malfoy had been when he appeared before the Wizengamot, to everyone’s surprise pleading guilty. His soft grey eyes had widened when he heard the sentence of probation, but that had been his only expression aside from a nod and muted “thank you” in Harry’s direction before he was led away.</p><p>“Ten years term, Potter. I’m not allowed wards beyond basic Muggle-repelling charms, and I can’t travel out of the country. Can’t hold a Ministry position, either, but that’s no trouble as I’d never want one. I’m also not allowed to work with restricted substances or creatures requiring a permit.”</p><p>So Malfoy wasn’t allowed to leave Britain. Maybe that was why he seemed so jealous of Harry’s expeditions. “Is that why you didn’t go into Potions, then? I’d always imagined it was your favourite subject.”</p><p>“If the war had never happened, I wouldn’t have gone into anything at all. Dabbled in politics, maybe, but Malfoys don’t <em>work</em>.” The way he said ‘work’ with a sneer gave Harry the impression he was quoting someone else. Maybe Narcissa didn’t like seeing her beloved son living so far away and holding down a job like a commoner.</p><p>"At least it seems like you enjoy your job?"</p><p>"I do," Malfoy agreed.</p><p>“Any luck so far with the sword then?”</p><p>Malfoy froze. “I… I haven’t been able to come up with anything, no.” He seemed worried. Harry shrugged it off easily.</p><p>“No matter. Let's still enjoy the game.”</p><p>Draco faltered, hand still on the doorknob. "Are you… sure you want to show up with me? In public?"</p><p>Harry still <em>wasn’t</em> entirely sure, but not for the reasons Malfoy seemed to assume. “I don’t much care what people think of me, you know that. Come on.” He stuck his elbow out for Malfoy to tentatively grasp with warm fingers, and Side-Alonged them both to the game.</p><p>The Harpies’ pitch had two Apparation points, one for the public and one for invited guests of the team. Harry was allowed to use the latter, and noticed Malfoy eye him sceptically, almost disappointed, at their isolation, as if Harry had been lying. To prove him wrong, Harry tugged him by the wrist through a small crowd of other player’s friends and families.</p><p>“Come on,” Harry told him. “I should say hey to Ginny before we sit down.”</p><p>“You don’t have to manhandle me, Potter.” Still, he didn’t pull away.</p><p>Ginny was laying one final coat of polish on her broom, her mouth set in a determined line. Not for the first time, Harry was glad that he hadn’t gone into Quidditch professionally. The Harpies only signed female players, so he would have never been her teammate — and facing Ginny Weasley across a pitch was a tough challenge.</p><p>She caught sight of Harry and lit up. “You came! I wasn’t sure if you would, I thought you’d be…” Her words trailed off as she noticed Malfoy behind him, still held loosely by the wrist. Harry flushed and yanked his hand back.</p><p>“…busy trying to figure out that sword. I’m sorry, is that Draco Malfoy?” Her fist tightened slightly around the broom handle.</p><p>“Er, yeah. Just thought I’d say… uh, thanks for the tickets! And hello!” Harry smiled a bit too wide. Malfoy remained wide-eyed behind him, and totally still except for a small wiggle of the fingers that Harry thought might be an attempt at a wave.</p><p>Ginny’s eyebrows flew up. “Wait, are you here <em>together?</em>”</p><p>“It’s a plus one ticket,” Harry shot back defensively.</p><p>“You don’t think Malfoy is a negative?”</p><p>“I’m standing right here,” Malfoy complained, before snapping his mouth shut again. Apparently his snarky tendencies overrode even his fear of a Bat-Bogey Hex.</p><p>Ginny blinked, her eyes darting between the two men. “Right. Harry, can I talk to you a moment?” She motioned for Harry to follow her around the corner to the equipment room.</p><p>“What are you doing here with Malfoy?” she whispered urgently. Harry thrust his hands in his pockets and tried to look nonchalant.</p><p>“He’s working with me on the sword. Luna recommended him. He’s a translator now, did you know that?” He glanced at Malfoy around the corner to see if he’d taken umbrage at being called a translator again; it seemed as if Harry and Ginny were out of earshot, luckily.</p><p>“I see.” Harry realised that she didn’t look angry. She looked <em>intrigued</em>. “Because for a moment I thought you were on a date.”</p><p>“Why does everyone think I want to shag Malfoy?”</p><p>“Who said anything about shagging?” Ginny grinned wickedly at Harry’s blush. “You’ve got a type, Harry. “</p><p>“We really are working together,” Harry complained. “I mean, yeah, he turned out fit but I wasn’t — I mean — ugh!” Ginny had a way of extracting even his deepest secrets from him.</p><p>She cackled, then craned her neck to peek around the corner. “He’s alright, I suppose. Less pointy at least.” She sobered, turning back to Harry. “But can you trust him, Harry?”</p><p>Harry scoffed. “He lives in a house filled with books and never goes out. He has <em>cats</em>. I think he’s going to end up like Mrs Figg if he isn’t careful.”</p><p>“So this is what, charity? You’re one to talk about never getting out.” She pulled a face. “Oh no, you’re <em>bonding</em> with Malfoy about being anti-social and lost in your work, aren’t you? This is terrible. I’ll be invited to a wedding before the year is out.”</p><p>“Stop it!” Harry whacked her lightly on the arm; she stuck her tongue out at him. “I just want to know what makes him tick. He’s living in <em>Surrey</em>, for Merlin’s sake.”</p><p>“You’ve <em>always</em> wanted to know what makes Malfoy tick,” Ginny pointed out. “Honestly, this puts so much into perspective.”</p><p>“Don’t you have a match to play?” he grumbled. A shadow fell over her; Harry recognised it as her game face.</p><p>“I do.” She strode back into the hallway to fetch her broom. “You’d better be cheering for us, Malfoy,” she threw out over her shoulder as she went to join her team.</p><p>“Well, I’m certainly not cheering for the Wasps,” he muttered. “Potter. There you are. May we take our seats? That was quite rude to leave me unattended.”</p><p>“Why, Malfoy? It’s not like we’re on a date.” Harry's own awkwardness about that word was worth it just to see Malfoy turn a brilliant shade of red.</p><p>Their seats were in a prime spot, and as the match commenced Harry found it easy to ignore the strange looks he and Malfoy received from the other spectators in the box. Malfoy kept an eye on the action, but he also tapped his foot nervously, and Harry caught him glancing over surreptitiously several times. As the Harpies lead increased, Harry took a moment to finally sate his curiosity about all things Malfoy.</p><p>“Strange to be cheering for the same team, innit?” he asked.</p><p>Malfoy snorted. “As I recall, you and Weasley supported the Cannons in school. Unless that ghastly shade of orange was your idea of high fashion.”</p><p>“I’m more of a Bats man myself these day. Ron still hasn’t forgiven me.”</p><p>“Ballycastle? Middling at best. Although their Seeker is rather—” Malfoy turned away abruptly — “excellent on a broom.”</p><p>“He’s fit, yeah,” Harry responded easily, enjoying the pink spots on Malfoy’s cheeks. “That’s not why, though. I actually got to know the team while I was up north last year. They were expanding their pitch and dug into a catacomb full of animated skeletons.”</p><p>“Skeletons?” Malfoy forgot the game. “Real ones? People call you for that sort of thing? Were they cursed?”</p><p>“No, but the spells to enchant them hadn’t been used for about a thousand years. I’m not a Curse-Breaker, that’s a little delicate. I just deal with obscure and dangerous things in my own way.”</p><p>Malfoy snorted. “Brute force, you mean. You probably blasted those skeletons to bits.”</p><p>“Er…” Harry brought a hand up and ran it through his hair; the wind had already undone any small bit of style he’d managed. “I found the spell to stop them, but <em>Bombarda</em> was easier, yeah.”</p><p>The wind had mussed Malfoy’s blond hair as well, and it blew in his face attractively as he laughed. “I’d expect no less from you.” He gazed out over the pitch, towards the action but not really paying attention. “Is that exciting, then? Uncovering other people’s long lost secrets?”</p><p>“It’s challenging, and it’s satisfying when I win,” Harry answered truthfully. “I think I’d be restless if I didn’t have a job like that.”</p><p>“And why not an Auror?” Malfoy asked quizzically. “You said it wasn’t a good fit?”</p><p>“I didn’t feel like being sent out against people anymore,” Harry said quietly. “I’m good at solving puzzles, and I’m good in a fight, but this way it’s just me versus whatever crypt or cave or ruin with a rumour around it.” He didn’t bring up the impact that Dark artefacts had on his life, on his desire to see them destroyed or otherwise neutralised.</p><p>Malfoy regarded him seriously. “Yes, that makes sense,” he finally responded. A sudden loud cheer directed their attention back to the field, where the Harpies’ Seeker was diving towards the ground. Both Harry and Malfoy leaned over to see if the Snitch was about to be captured. Their shoulders brushed, and neither pulled away. Harry found himself leaning just a bit farther than he had to.</p><p>The Snitch, if it had ever been there, disappeared, and the Seeker rose back into the air. Both Harry and Malfoy sat back upright in their seats. Harry didn’t think he was imaging the the way Draco had shyly bitten his lip at their close contact.</p><p>Was Malfoy <em>attracted</em> to him? His friends’ teasing and his own appreciation aside, he hadn’t really considered it an option. <em>I just felt like spending some time around him, not asking him out</em>. But now that he’d noticed Malfoy’s reactions, he couldn’t <em>stop</em> noticing them.</p><p>Another close call with the Snitch, another moment they were leaned against each other. Both reached for a snack that Harry purchased, and their fingers brushed. When they moved aside for another spectator, their knees pressed together for longer than necessary.</p><p>Harry started going a bit mad.</p><p>“You must like secrets, too,” Harry offered, trying to restart the conversation. Malfoy startled at that.</p><p>“I — what do you mean?” His eyes darted back and forth.</p><p>“Just, translating things. That’s a puzzle. What’s the most difficult thing you’ve ever dealt with?”</p><p>Malfoy relaxed a fraction. "Anything that turns out to be in a language I'm not familiar with. I had what appeared to be a simple Greek inscription several months ago, but it made no sense. Turned out whoever wrote the grimoire used Greek letters, but was actually writing in Basque. It's an isolate language. Felt brilliant when I cracked it."</p><p>"What did you think I meant by secrets?" Harry asked curiously.</p><p>"Nothing," Malfoy answered evasively.</p><p>"I won't tell anyone about your weird cats," Harry teased.</p><p>"My cats are not <em>weird</em>," Malfoy sniffed. "They have perfectly understandable issues. All three of them were rescued."</p><p>"Wait, three? I only saw two, the reddish one and the old one."</p><p>"Saffron only shows herself to those she has judged sufficiently worthy."</p><p>"You <em>would</em> have a snooty cat, wouldn't you."</p><p>Malfoy only smiled, his lips curving up. Harry stared at his mouth for one long moment before turning back to the pitch. They spent the rest of the game in pleasant conversation; there seemed to be a very flirty undertone to everything Malfoy said, and Harry was only happy to return it.</p><p>The Harpies’ Seeker was eventually victorious, capturing the Snitch and putting the Wasps out of their misery. Harry stood to go, as did Malfoy.</p><p>“I suppose I’ll send an owl when I know anything more about the sword,” he said hesitantly.</p><p>“Is there anything I can do to help, anything at all?” Harry just wanted to see him again.</p><p>Malfoy seemed to mull it over. “You could draw me a diagram of, or at least describe, the site you found it at. Perhaps context clues will be of use.”</p><p>“I can do you one better!” Harry exclaimed, the idea coming to him in a flash. "Let’s go up, make a weekend out of it. You want to see my ‘adventurous life,’ yeah?”</p><p>“I…” Malfoy baulked, but Harry could tell he was tempted. “I suppose I could. I’m not prohibited from travelling within the bounds of the country. Is there much to see?”</p><p>“In all honesty, it’s pretty empty, but it’s still interesting,” Harry assured him. “And I didn’t go over the whole place in detail, so I’d like another look around.”</p><p>“Is it dangerous?” He sounded more excited than frightened, but still hesitated.</p><p>“Come on, Draco,” Harry grinned, taking a chance on his first name; the immediate blush was well worth it. “Live a little. The cats won’t miss you for a couple of days.”</p><p>“Days?” Malfoy — Draco — squeaked. “With you?”</p><p><em>Oh, yes. With me</em>. Harry still wasn’t sure if they were <em>really</em> flirting, or just teasing each other, but it was just so much fun.</p><p>“Scared?”</p><p>Draco’s eyes narrowed. “You wish. Next weekend, then?”</p><p>“Next weekend. And pack light,” Harry instructed. “You’ll see why when we get there.”</p><p>“Pack for what?” Both men whirled around to see Ginny hovering on her broom, still flushed from the match.</p><p>“I’m taking Draco out to the Devonshire site.” If Ginny was thrown off by the use of first names, she didn’t show it, but she did fix Draco with a vaguely threatening stare.</p><p>“I’m sure you’ll both have fun, and come back in one piece, right?” Draco nodded furiously, stepping behind Harry. “Good. I need to join the victory lap. See you Sunday, Harry.” She zoomed off toward her teammates and Draco breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>“You’re frightened of her,” Harry pointed out with amusement.</p><p>“Am not,” Draco huffed. “I just don’t fancy having bats fly out of my nostrils.”</p><p>“She won’t hex you if you behave.”</p><p>A glimmer appeared in Draco’s eye. “When have you known me to <em>behave</em>, Potter?” He scrunched his nose at the pointed look on Harry’s face. “Oh, don’t tell me you expect me to call you <em>Harry</em> now.”</p><p>“So I’ll see you on Saturday, <em>Draco?</em>” Harry couldn’t ignore the butterflies in his stomach; this was beyond meeting up to discuss mutual business, beyond a friendly outing at a match. This was a trip — and it felt like a date.</p><p>Draco made a show of appearing to mull it over. “I suppose I can make time in my busy schedule, <em>Harry</em>.”</p><p>“Cheers, then. I’ll see you at yours. Maybe I can meet that third cat.”</p><hr/><p>At lunch on Sunday (his second in as many weeks; Molly could be terrifying when she wanted to be) Ginny had grilled him mercilessly for details on his budding — friendship? — with Draco. Harry didn’t have much more to tell her. He’d talked more about himself during the game, he realised, and had learned very little new information about Draco’s life. He couldn’t shake the feeling that Draco was hiding something — a familiar enough feeling, given their history, but one Harry wasn’t happy to revisit.</p><p>Still, he’d promised a visit to the site, and he did rather enjoy Draco’s company. Maybe Harry would be able to uncover his secrets this time around.</p><p>Draco stood on his doorstep, a well made leather satchel over one shoulder under his cloak. Harry craned his neck to look past him into the comfortable looking home, trying to catch a glimpse of the elusive third cat.</p><p>“Saffron needs her beauty sleep,” Draco said, yawning. “Much like I do. Why did we have to leave so early?”</p><p><em>You don’t need beauty sleep at all</em>, Harry thought privately. “We can’t Apparate directly into the site. There’s an Anti-Apparition field surrounding it.”</p><p>“Placed by whom? I thought this site had been abandoned for a long time.”</p><p>“I never figured that out, actually. Once I had the chest, I thought it was best to get it open as soon as possible. There was definitely a strong energy around it.”</p><p>“Energy?” Draco frowned.</p><p>“You’re full of questions for supposedly being so sleepy,” Harry teased. “Come on, I’ll tell you all about it on our walk.”</p><p>“Walk?!” he tried to exclaim, but Harry was already holding him by the arm and pulling them away. They appeared with a <em>crack</em> in the middle of a moor. “We have to walk there because of the field,” Harry explained. “It’s five miles out.”</p><p>Draco looked mutinous. “Five miles? Why couldn’t we use brooms?”</p><p>“There are too many Muggle farms. The Statute is pretty strict around here. Wizards haven’t lived in the area for a long time.”</p><p>“I didn’t realise adventure would be quite so taxing. Are you <em>sure</em> we can’t use brooms?” he wheedled. “Just fly very low?”</p><p>“Nope. We’ve got a couple hours hike ahead of us.” Harry was already marching forward.</p><p>“Malfoy’s don’t hike,” Draco sniffed, a shade of his old spoiled self returning.</p><p>“Well, they do today. Look, are you coming or not?”</p><p>Draco sighed reluctantly, but he fell into step beside Harry as they set off for the base of a high tor. After several minutes of silence, Draco was the first to speak. “So, tell me more about this place.”</p><p>“Luna was researching some kind of creatures, and came across the journal of a magizoologist from the 14th century who mentioned coming across a cairn and a few standing stones in the middle of an Anti-Apparition field somewhere around here. He’d already hiked pretty far into the field and had to stay overnight. There wasn’t anything for miles on any modern map so she knew I’d be interested."</p><p>“Did you ever see any of whatever creature she was looking for?” Draco asked while glancing around nervously. Harry laughed to himself, recalling for a brief moment Draco’s fear in the Forbidden Forest when they were children.</p><p>“It was some kind of bat, and you know Luna. It probably doesn’t exist.”</p><p>Draco bristled. “Luna isn’t stupid. She may be a bit more credulous than some, but I assure you she is meticulous in her research. And if you are referring to Vospul Bats, they are <em>quite</em> real.”</p><p>Chagrined, Harry stopped walking for a moment. “I’m sorry. You know I respect Luna, right? I guess all those years of listening to Hermione brush her off made me a little doubtful. And I mean, <em>I’ve</em> never seen a Nargle or anything.”</p><p>“I’ve never seen a Nargle either, but Vospul Bats are well documented. They migrate to Scandinavia for the winter, but no one is sure where they breed in spring yet. The fact that they Apparate makes them even harder to track. Considering how valuable their guano is in certain potions, it would be a breakthrough to find their nesting grounds.” Draco took a deep breath. “Also, Luna is one of the only people who talked to me while I was completing my studies. She gave me a chance, and forgave me after… well. You know. I think I might be a hermit if it weren’t for her encouraging me to make connections with others in my field, or facilitating job offers for me. So you can see why I’m a bit defensive of her.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Harry quietly considered Draco for a moment. He wasn’t at all surprised at Luna extending a hand of friendship to Draco — that was just in her nature. But it must have taken a lot for Draco to overcome his pride and even his guilt to become friends with her, when he’d considered her an object of ridicule at school.</p><p>Harry inclined his head towards the hill. “Come on. Maybe we’ll see some evidence of bats to report back to Luna. I was here before in winter, after all.” Seemingly satisfied, Draco followed.</p><p>“So, tell me about the other things you found here. It wasn’t just the sword, right?”</p><p>“No, there was a chest, with a few rings and torcs, and silver chalices. The whole crypt was pretty empty, which was weird to me. If someone took the time to dig out the hillside and reinforce it with stone, why only leave one chest inside?”</p><p>“And there were no bodies?”</p><p>“No! Not even evidence of any. No bones, no mummified flesh, not even any wrappings that would indicate a body had been there once.” Draco shuddered visibly at the mention of bodies.</p><p>“Do you find those often?”</p><p>“What, bodies? Of course, I go into tombs. I’m always very careful not to disturb them. Sometimes a grave site will have to be moved because of Muggle development, but I let the local authorities handle that. I’m not a tomb robber.”</p><p>“Why did you take this chest, then? Or any relic? No judgement, it’s abandoned as far as I’m concerned. Just wondering.”</p><p>Harry had asked himself this very question. “When things are simply buried, and the owners are long gone, International Magical Law considers them up for grabs. It’s looser than Muggle law, actually. Wizards have a penchant for hiding magical objects in all sorts of places. It’s Muggles that mostly just bury things in graves.”</p><p>They scrambled over a Muggle fence that was probably meant to keep cattle off the neighbouring property, and Harry gestured around them.</p><p>“Some of this land might be mined someday. I actually asked the farmers for permission to hike through first, and they thought I was there to buy land. Got pretty excited about it, too. When I found the chest, I thought about what might happen in the future, and decided to take it.”</p><p>“I’m surprised no one found it already. An Anti-Apparition field doesn’t do anything to keep Muggles away, and it only makes travelling for Wizards inconvenient.” Draco wrinkled his nose and held up the edge of his cloak. “See? I’ve snagged the hem on that blasted fence.”</p><p>“That’s why I don’t wear anything fancy.”</p><p>“You could have told me it would be this <em>rustic</em>.”</p><p>“Would you have listened?” Harry asked, bemused. Draco pursed his lips, but didn’t argue, which was all the answer Harry needed.</p><p>Halfway through their hike they stopped under a single, lonely tree and ate lunch. Harry had planned ahead and packed sandwiches, fruit and a thermos of tea. He passed a cup to Draco, who stared at him patiently, not taking a sip.</p><p>“What’s wrong? It has a Warming Charm on, I promise.”</p><p>“I take two sugars. Please tell you brought some.”</p><p>“Oh.” Harry blushed. “I already put that in.”</p><p>“How did you know I took two sugars?” Draco asked suspiciously. Harry only shrugged. <em>I know because I’ve been remembering all the things I used to notice when I watched you at school.</em></p><p>After lunch they continued in companionable silence, only occasionally remarking on some aspect of the scenery. As they drew closer to the site, Harry started to feel uneasy.</p><p>“Do you… feel anything?” he asked Draco.</p><p>“No. Should I?” Draco caught sight of Harry’s worried expression. “What? What is it? Have you got us lost?”</p><p>“It’s not that. I just haven’t noticed any trace of the Anti-Apparition field.”</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes. “You can’t <em>feel</em> an Anti-Apparition field. You have to use a detection spell. Or try to Apparate, but that usually stings — hey!” He startled as Harry disappeared in front of his eyes, and began looking around desperately. “Harry? Where did you go?” When Harry failed to reappear, Draco grew more frantic. “Potter! You can’t just <em>leave</em> me out here!”</p><p>With a <em>crack</em>, Harry appeared once more, several feet away. Draco darted over and slapped him on the arm. “Don’t do that!”</p><p>Harry rubbed his arm with a wince. “That smarted.”</p><p>“Oh really? That’s nothing compared to the shock you’d get if there was still a field!” He paused. “Wait. Why isn’t there a field? Where did you go?”</p><p>“To the site. I got right up beside it. The field’s gone, though I have no idea why.”</p><p>“What powered it in the first place?”</p><p>“I never figured that out. Come on, I’ll Side-Along you there.”</p><p>“You mean we could have skipped all this <em>walking?!</em>” Draco’s indignant shout was cut off as Harry pulled him along to the site.</p><p>The entrance to the small underground chamber was hidden behind a riot of bushes and heather. “Come on, through here,” Harry instructed, moving a stone slab aside and making his way down the sloping entrance. Draco followed behind more cautiously.</p><p>“It smells <em>awful</em>. What is that?”</p><p>Harry peered into the darkness, confused. “It didn’t smell like that a few months ago.”</p><p>“And you’re <em>sure</em> there’s nothing dangerous down here?” Draco had his wand out, Harry noticed.</p><p>“Nothing at all. Would you mind giving us some light?”</p><p>“<em>Lumos</em>!” Draco’s voice was confident, and the a ball of light rose to the ceiling, lighting their way. The chamber was mostly hard packed dirt, with rough-hewn stones holding up portions of the wall. Harry pointed at a turn off the main tunnel.</p><p>“The chest was over there.”</p><p>“Not in the main area? That’s interesting. So it likely wasn’t the centrepiece. Why are there so many little dead ends here?” He gestured to the empty turns and niches they were passing.</p><p>“Could be more things were meant to be buried here, or those could be baffles. Usually a trick passageway in a place like this will have a curse or a trap, though, and there weren’t any.” They turned down the side passage that had once held the chest, ducking under the lower ceiling.</p><p>“There,” Harry said, pointing at a low stone dais partway down the narrow hall. “That’s where the chest was sitting.”</p><p>“Hmm.” Draco approached, examining the stone. “No carvings or anything of the sort, at least not on top. Let me see the sides.” The ball of light didn’t illuminate the floor very well, so Draco cast another <em>Lumos</em>, this time directed downward. “Here!” he said excitedly. “Look here!”</p><p>Harry set his wand on the stone and crouched down, looking where Draco was pointing, right at the base of the stone. “I didn’t see that before.”</p><p>“It’s very faint. It isn’t carved, see, just a bit of faded chalk. It’s Latin.”</p><p>“Can you read it?”</p><p>“Honestly. Why they didn’t teach Latin at Hogwarts I’ll never know. Yes, I can read it. It says <em>hīc pōne centrum</em>. “Place centre here.” It’s just an instruction, probably left by whoever built this place.”</p><p>“Centre? But this is where the chest was.”</p><p>“Usually the word <em>centrum</em> is used in magical literature to imply the focal point of a spell.”</p><p>Harry lit up. “The Anti-Apparition field! The focal point must have been here, where the chest was.”</p><p>“So <em>that’s</em> what ‘centre of power’ means,” Draco muttered to himself.</p><p>“Sorry?”</p><p>“Nothing, nothing. But yes, by removing the chest it looks like you broke the spell.” Draco reached down to gently brush some dirt away from the chalk markings. “Just think,” he said in a hushed voice. “Long ago, some witch or wizard touched this very stone, and now here we are.”</p><p>Harry watched Draco touching the stone reverently, and felt a rush of warm affection. As the smaller ball of magical light hovered near the ground, it occurred to him that it was much darker than he remembered. “Draco? Do you think you could direct the light over here, near my feet?”</p><p>The floor was bathed in light, and Harry noticed that the entire ground was covered in a dark substance. “What is that?” he wondered out loud. Draco nudged the ground with his toe, and a look of disgusted realisation came over his face.</p><p>“Guano. Bat shit. Ugh, it’s all over my shoes.”</p><p>“That’s new. I guess I didn’t seal the place back up very well. They must have come in through a crack in the door.” The conversation earlier came rushing back, and Harry gasped. “The bats! The ones Luna was looking for! You said they can Apparate!”</p><p>“Vospul Bats?” Draco eyed the guano with less disgust, and then gasped as well. “That’s why there was a field! It doesn’t keep people out very well, but kept out the pests! The Vospul Bats must nest in the hills around here, they don’t need an entrance to the caverns since they can just Apparate inside! Whoever built this place must have known they’d fill it with guano if they could get in.”</p><p>“And now they have,” Harry laughed. “Apologies to whoever built it. Luna’s going to be pleased, though. I can’t wait to tell her.” He tapped his foot on the floor. “Didn’t you say this stuff was useful in potions? Why don’t you take some?”</p><p>Draco frowned. “Vospul Bat guano is regulated and restricted. I’m not allowed to possess it.”</p><p>“Oh.” Harry flushed, looking away. “Sorry.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Draco answered, but he was clearly embarrassed. He paced away, looking around. “They certainly went to a lot of trouble just to protect some random valuables. You’d expect somewhere with protections like this to have more powerful artefacts, or bodies.” He stopped by the back wall, behind the dais. Harry hadn’t ventured that far before. “Look over here. In the back.” He peered closer at the wall, and Harry came up behind him.</p><p>“More chalk? What’s it say?”</p><p>“It says… <em>dēclīvis</em>.”</p><p>“What?” Harry leaned closer, bracing his hand on the wall beside Draco’s.</p><p>“Down.”</p><p>“Down?”</p><p>Suddenly the floor gave way.</p>
