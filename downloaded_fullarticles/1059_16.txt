    <p>It's the middle of the night, about 2 am. A familiar blonde-haired Slytherin lays peacefully asleep on his bed, a rare occurrence for him, usually if he slept it was at his desk, but even that was rare. All of a sudden he jolts upright, waking in a cold sweat. Bakugou wipes his forehead, barely coherently muttering, <em>"Someone hurt my Kirishima."</em> At that, he briskly got up, fixing his bedhead and putting on his robes.</p><p></p><div class="">

        <p>He races towards the nearest painting, it being just in the common room. He hurries over, asking the guy in the painting, <em>"Excuse me, have you heard of any redheaded Gryffindors getting attacked? It's urgent."</em></p>

      <div class="markup-2BOw-j">
        <p>The guy thinks for a moment, <em>"Actually I have, just outside the Gryffindor common room. What's the urgency?"</em> He questions.</p>

        <p><em>"My boyfriend, thanks!"</em> He says, practically sprinting out, his robes flowing behind him.</p>

        <p>Two older students, both male, start to press the cornered redhead closer and closer to the corner of the hallway. Kirishima tries to withstand the attacks the boys are pressing on him. The boys attack him, hitting him in the rib, him letting out a pained whimper.</p>

      <div class="markup-2BOw-j">
        <p>Laughing, they threaten him, <em>"Oh trust me you filthy mudblood, you're relationship with your</em> <em><strong>blonde haired Slytherin girl</strong></em> <em>isn't going to last."</em></p>

        <p>All of a sudden an angry Slytherin comes stomping down the hall, literally growling, <em><strong>"And what do you fucking uneducated assholes want with him. Oh, and I heard every don't try shit."</strong></em></p>
      </div>
      <div class="markup-2BOw-j">
        <p>The first guy turns, a look of pure terror spreading across his face. The other doesn't turn, only starting, <em>‚ÄùWhat, with the filthy mu-,"</em> He gets nudges, finally turning, the terror from the other spreading to him as well, coughing, <em>"-With this wonderful Gryffindor?"</em></p>

      <div class="markup-2BOw-j">
        <p>Bakugou glares at them, <em><strong>"I'm giving you 5 seconds to run, either way, you're getting your wizarding career ruined. Better take this chance to drop out before I completely get you expelled."</strong></em> He threatens, his face twisted into a look that's indescribable.</p>

        <p>The boys glance at each other, booking it back towards the Slytherin common room.</p>
