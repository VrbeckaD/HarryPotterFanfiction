    <p>Harry Potter was no stranger to stares. From the time he had entered Hogwarts he had been stared at more times than he could count. Honestly, the raven-haired boy had found the stares to be quite rude in the beginning. But now, due to a certain Slytherin's influence, he had started enjoying the stares. </p><p>"Harry!" The honey-sweet voice of said Slytherin echoed off the stone walls of the corridor. Harry turned to see Pansy Parkinson, his friend and fellow Prefect, jogging down the hall. When it became clear that the raven-haired beauty wasn't slowing down he sighed and adopted a stance that would allow him to catch the girl. She giggled as they spun around for a bit before the momentum from her jump slowed before finally stopping.</p><p>"Hi, Pansy. How was your summer?" Still, in his arms, Pansy slapped his chest and pouted before wiggling herself onto the floor. </p><p>"Well, you would know if you responded to any of my letters, Potter." She griped, turning away from him and crossing her arms over her rather well-developed chest. Harry blushed reminding himself that he and Pansy were friends and that's all he wanted to be. "See something you like?" Pansy's voice once again had cut through his musings. The blush on his face intensified as she burst out laughing. They heard some of the accompanying students join in before Pansy turned a growl on her full lips." If you idiots don't stop laughing now I will dock house points!" The thin girl glowered, her hands in fists on either side of her waist. Around them, the two Prefects heard mutters.</p><p>"Abuse of power."</p><p>"Spoilsport."</p><p>"Are you sure they aren't dating?"</p><p>Pansy sighed calling the boy's attention back to her. </p><p>"My summer was fine thanks for asking. Nott finally grew a pair and asked me to the Malfoy's ball." Harry blinked. no one had heard from the Malfoys since Narcissa and Lucius had divorced the previous fall. Then again two weeks later when Lucius had denounced the dark side in an attempt to get his wife back. Pansy noticed her friend's questioning look and decided to elaborate. " Draco, their only son, is finally coming to Hogwarts this year. It's a bit of a coming-out type of thing. Not that it's his official debutante ball, that'll be in the spring of course." His friend continued to prattle on about the ins and outs of old rich wizarding families. </p><p>"I wonder what house he'll be in."<br/>
"You should go with him."</p><p>The two spoke at the same time. Pansy blinked surprised more over the fact that Harry spoke rather than the fact that he clearly wasn't paying any attention to her. Harry was confused about where Pansy had been going. But he supposed that was his own fault for ignoring her as she was talking.</p><p>"Slytherin," Pansy said in response to her male counterpart's question. " Also, I was saying that I thought I could get Blaise to ask you to go if you wanted." Harry hmmed at her in response to both of her remarks. He did like Blaise and he was very handsome but Harry had always suspected that the other boy held a bit of a flame for Harry's first friend Ron. Who was now recently with Harry's other best friend, Hermione, the brightest witch of her age. The two had been in love since the second year so it had taken them long enough. </p><p>"Sure. I'll go with Blaise. A party is a party right?"</p><p>Pansy pumped her arm in the air and the two headed towards the Great Hall for dinner and the sorting.</p>
