    <p>The tent was set up strategically (or so it seemed) so that Luna could see it from her bedroom window perfectly. She heard the chatter of the two excited families and guests through her open window. Luna Lovegood lay on her bed, gazing up at the pictures of her friends on her ceiling; mostly staring at one in particular…<br/>
A soft breeze floated through the window, ruffling the curtains and filling Luna’s room with the crisp scent of summer. This was the time of year that Neville enjoyed the most. Luna grinned as she remembered Neville lying down in the grass, the hot summer sun hitting his face. He’d told her that that was the best he’d felt in a long time. That was five years ago, just after the Battle of Hogwarts. A lot had changed since then.</p><p>Luna sighed up at Neville’s painted face and read the words outlining his picture: friends…friends…friends. She knew now that those words were a far cry from the truth about her feelings towards Neville, they always had been. She never could bring herself to admit her feelings to Neville; their friendship was so effortless and perfect. The best she’d ever had. And yet she’d always wanted more…</p><p>Luna sat up on her bed and looked out the window at the tent. This is what she got for hesitating, for not trying to mess things up: Neville was going to marry Hannah today. Right outside her house. She was sure that Hannah had chosen the location just to spite Luna, since Hannah had always been jealous of Neville and Luna’s friendship. But a small part of her thought that Neville might have chosen the site to try to get Luna to attend the wedding, even when she’d flat-out refused.</p><p>FLASHBACK</p><p>“Why not?” Neville asked the hurt was plain on his face as he looked her in the eyes. How could she refuse to attend her best friend’s wedding?</p><p>“I just can’t,” replied Luna lamely. She knew that Neville wasn’t going to take that response, but she sure wasn’t going to tell him what she really thought.</p><p>“I thought I could count on you!” Neville’s voice rose. “How can you be so apathetic, Luna?! This is going to be the happiest day of my life and-”</p><p>“IS IT?!” Luna asked, tears coming to her eyes. “Is it really going to be the best day of your life, Neville? Do you even love Hannah?”</p><p>“I…I don’t-Yes…” said Neville, less angrily.</p><p>“Are you sure?” asked Luna, much more calmly now that she had her feelings under control again. Turning back into her old, caring self she calmly sat down on the sofa next to Neville and placed her hand gently over his. Neville calmed down immediately.</p><p>“I don’t know…I guess I’ll learn to love her. She likes me.”</p><p>“I like you too.”</p><p>“But that’s different. Hannah might be the only person in the world who could actually love me that way. Who else would love me? I’m not charismatic like Harry, or funny like Ron. I’m not even that good-looking. I’m just me. I can’t imagine any girl falling for just me.”</p><p>Luna almost broke down right there in Neville’s flat and told him her feelings. But she couldn’t. She would try, but the words got caught in her throat, unable to reach their intended recipient.</p><p>After a few minutes of silence, Luna sighed and got up. “So you’re sure you won’t come?” Neville asked hopefully.</p><p>“Yes,” said Luna firmly.</p><p>“I wish you could be there.” He looked like he meant it. Luna couldn’t bear to stay with him any longer. She said a quick goodbye and disapparated.</p><p>END FLASHBACK</p><p>Luna sat on her bed, wallowing in her sadness for a long while until an idea came to her. It might have been the Wrackspurts, but she didn’t care. This was that last chance she had and she was going to take it.</p><p>She rushed down the stairs and called to her father in the kitchen. “Daddy, I’m going out!”</p><p>“Have you decided to go to Neville’s wedding?” asked her father skeptically.</p><p>“Yes, I’ll be back soon!”</p><p>Hopefully this endeavour won’t cause Luna anymore heartbreak…</p>
