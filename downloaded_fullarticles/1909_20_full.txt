    <blockquote class="userstuff">
      <p>Back again! The world of Harry Potter just can't let me go. </p><p>Like most people, I have my issues with the Cursed Child, but there were so many things about it I found to be intriguing. I liked the idea that Harry wasn't the great father he always assumed he'd be, that Draco Malfoy was allowed in-canon redemptive qualities, and that Slytherins could be allowed to lead a story without simply being the scum of the earth.</p><p>Above all, however, I was captured by Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy. I loved the embittered middle child misunderstood by his father and his community; the optimistic son of a wicked dynasty who meets the world with an enthusiasm he knows can never be returned to him. Their friendship was what carried Cursed Child for me (it sure as shit wasn't Voldemort getting it on with Bellatrix Lestrange--don't get me started on how bizarrely out of character that was, and yes I threw a casual fix-it in later on). I am very much an Albus--a holder of grudges, a Slytherin despite the odds--but I wish I was a Scorpius. So I had to write them. At this point, I'm not sure who in this universe is left for me to tackle. Maybe--gasp--I'll have to return to original fic? The horror!</p><p>As always, the warnings all come right up front. There will be no individual chapter warnings. Just in case people are scrolling by, HEY YOU, STOP AND READ THE WARNINGS. This story deals with death. Violent death occurs several times in this story, including both murder and suicide. People who have read my stories know I don't shy away from that, but there's a fairly graphic death described, so if you're not comfortable with that, you'd best stop here. This story has some racial slurs (my very firm head canon is that the Potters are desi). There are mentions of domestic abuse, and one instance where it's shown. Like everything else I've written, this story has a lot of angst, and a lot of hurt feelings. </p><p>But! It's also a story where people love one another very deeply, even if they hurt each other. It's also funny, and sad, and hopeful. I'm really excited for all of you wonderful people to come along with me on this story, and I hope you give it a chance. There are two parts to the story. A chapter will upload each day, with a week long break between Parts One and Two. </p><p>So let's get started, shall we?</p>

    <p>I nearly choke on my toothbrush when an owl slams into the window.</p><p>            Gagging, I hang over the sink, trying to spit out toothpaste. I hear the owl struggling in the brush below the window, but she can wait. If she hasn’t killed herself after all the other times she flew into my windows, I don’t imagine this will be the one that does it.</p><p>            I slam the door shut, coughing, as my cat comes racing down the hall. Once I’m certain I won’t choke, I fix my face in a scowl and unlatch the window. Leaning outside, I say, “It’s too early for this, bird. It had better be an emergency.”</p><p>            I reach down and scoop Aedesia up with one hand. She’s a tiny white owl and I’d lay money that her vision is impaired in some way, but try telling her owner that. I plant her on the back of the toilet. She staggers a moment, then puts a foot wrong and falls on her back.</p><p>            Her leg pops up, offering me the message attached to it.</p><p>            Shaking my head, I untie the little scroll. I turn on the tap to clean out the sink while I read it.</p><p>            ‘I’m going to propose tonight. What do you think?’</p><p>            Rolling my eyes, I wave the scroll at Aedesia. “Bird! This is the literal opposite of an emergency. What do you have to say for yourself?”</p><p>            Aedesia croaks, batting her wings against the toilet as she struggles to right herself.</p><p>            “Ugh. Useless. I suppose you’ll make me find a pen now.”</p><p>            I have to go out into the hallway to get a pen, pushing Zamora back with my foot so she doesn’t attack the owl. She’s not pleased. Usually I let her have at whatever owl arrives on the premises. Really, that’s the most of my worries. The nice thing about a message like this is that I don’t panic over it, not the way I once would have. I’m actually rather indifferent to a message like this, which is a blessing.</p><p>            Once I’m back in the bathroom, door closed against my disgruntled cat, I put the scroll up on the wall and write out a reply. ‘Don’t be so bloody stupid. I’ll see you at lunch.’</p><p>            I sit on the toilet lid and go about tying the scroll to Aedesia’s leg. “Make sure you get this to him quickly. Very important stuff here.” I pull the knot tight, then sit back. “Off you go.”</p><p>            She stands there, looking at me pitifully. I raise a brow, shrugging. Aedesia lets out a mournful chirp.</p><p>            Sighing dramatically, I reach up, grabbing one of the bags of owl treats I keep by all the windows. “You’re a beggar,” I mutter, offering Aedesia a treat. She pecks at my hand, missing the food the first few tries. “Stupid blind bird.”</p><p>            I give her a begrudging pat on the head. If the worst thing that happens today is my best friend making an ass of himself, then I’m quite well off. Propose. What nonsense.</p><p>            Aedesia hoots at me expectantly. I hold out another treat and she leans for it. She overshoots and plummets. I manage to catch her before she can brain herself on the tiles.</p><p>            Stupid bird. I do give her the treat, though.</p><p> </p><p>The train goes too fast around a corner and I almost trip off my feet. I lose hold of my book and it goes flying, hitting an old woman on the calf.</p><p>            I’ve broken the great rule of British public transit. I’ve forced another human to admit that we both exist. The woman looks at me with the deepest affront. Clearing my throat, I bend down to pick up the book. “Terribly sorry.”</p><p>            She sniffs and faces forward again, but her disdain radiates through the train car.</p><p>            Cheeks warm, I lean back against the doors. I shove the book into my bag, wishing desperately that I had my headphones back. They were remarkably expensive, which means it’s taking awhile to get them fixed. In the meantime, I’m supposed to navigate the world without that added layer of protection.</p><p>            I hold onto one of the bars, looking up as the station is announced. I have a few more before I get anywhere near work. I don’t live in London; I’m up in Bedford. I apparate to Wexford Junction and ride the rest of the way. It’s just too difficult trying to apparate close to work. After that accident last year where two healers apparated onto the same spot near the hospital, there’s all sorts of protective spells in downtown London that won’t let you apparate in. Besides, I don’t mind the commute.</p><p>            Usually. If I have my headphones.</p><p>            Two opposing waves meet, people coming on and off the train. I’ve positioned myself where I always do. In the corner opposite whichever door people exit from. It’s harder to shove me about if I’m already as far back as I can be. I’m a thin man, and not particularly strong, and I like to be out of the way, regardless of the situation.</p><p>            It takes a moment, but the doors close, and we’re off again.</p><p>            I have to go to my parents’ tonight.</p><p>            See? If I don’t have music to listen to, I have to think about that. I already know I’ll be dreading it the entire day, and now I’ve started thinking about it at—8:20. Typical.</p><p>            At least it’s Friday. I’ll get through whatever horrors my family has waiting for me, then I can go out. Admittedly, I will be so exhausted by whatever they put me through that I’ll need a nap and several cups of coffee before leaving the house, but I can make the effort.</p><p>            Hypothetically. I do have to get through eight hours of work as well.</p><p>            I hear frequently that I’m a glass half empty kind of man. I’m not going to dispute it.</p><p>            I try my luck and have a glance around the car. I’ll have broken the rule if I meet anyone’s eyes, but without a book or music I’ll succumb to boredom. Plenty of them are people I recognize. We all take the same route to work every morning, five days a week. I’ve had this job two years now, and I certainly don’t know their names, but I know a lot of the faces.</p><p>            Another year. Then who knows what comes next.</p><p>            Well. There’s a sight.</p><p>            Two men, about my age, are halfway down the car, chatting. It’s not their faces I notice, at least not at first—they are rather attractive. No, it’s the buttons on their lapels. White on top, red on bottom, with opposing colours of text. The pins say <em>SQUIB RIGHTS</em>.</p><p>            I notice because I have the same pin on my jacket. I glance down at it to make sure it’s there. Yes it is. Clearing my throat, I look up at the ceiling, accepting that they’re both nice to look at. I’m just not the kind of man to approach another one on the Tube on a weekday morning. I’m amenable to being approached, however.</p><p>            Look casual. Oh, what am I even doing? What are the odds that some man on the train is going to see that we share the same liberal values and decide that we were meant to be? Slim to none, that’s what. I’m just prone to commute daydreaming is all.</p><p>            Fuck right off, I think he’s looking at me. I catch him studying me from my peripheral vision. I nonchalantly glance down the train car.</p><p>            He <em>is</em>. The one closest to me. He has a halo of auburn hair, and light blue eyes. He’s handsome, but not in a conventional way. Nose too big, mouth too small. But his face works somehow. He’s looking right at me.</p><p>            Rare that I pick up during the day. I might be able to get his number if I play this right. I give him a slight smile, then look away. Then I give him another quick glance, just so he knows I’m interested.</p><p>            And now I gaze down at the floor. Despite being a glass half empty man, a man who doesn’t like being around others, I’m adept at taking strangers home. Let him come to me.</p><p>            I don’t have to wait long. Here he comes. This Friday just became exponentially better.</p><p>            “Excuse me.”</p><p>            Be much smoother than you are, Albus. Raising my eyes, I smile.</p><p>            He’s even better close up. He has a spray of freckles across the bridge of his nose. I’ve always had a bit of a soft spot for pale men. We’d look good together.</p><p>            He opens his mouth and says, “Are you Harry Potter’s son?”</p><p>            Imagine all my interest being a massive switch on the side of a wall. Then watch that massive switch be slammed down and all the lights snapping off in the building.</p><p>            I turn my eyes away. “No. Sorry, mate.”</p><p>            He doesn’t seem to be getting the point. And the point is already a sore one. “Come on,” he says, thinking it’s a joke, “I’m sure of it—”</p><p>            I snap, “My parents were Death Eaters who died in Azkaban and the last thing I need on my morning commute is someone telling me I look like the man who put them there, so why don’t you fuck off back the way you came—”</p><p>            He’s already scrambling away from me. Good.</p><p>            Even better, my stop is coming up. Everyone is shying away from me like I’m rabid. Which I suppose I am, at least on that particular topic.</p><p>            The train stops and I join the tsunami of people flooding in and out of the car. We’re in the heart of London, so the place is mobbed. I just keep my arms in and set my jaw and plow forwards.</p><p>            I’m a few steps off the train when a large, burly man slams into me. I spin backwards and he growls, “Watch it! Fucking Paki.” And disappears into the crowd.</p><p>            I stand here, watching everyone around me tense up, then move away without saying anything. It would take so little effort. My wand is in my jacket. I wouldn’t even have to speak. When I get angry—really angry—sometimes I lose control.</p><p>            Instead, I do what I always do. I bury it deep, then continue walking. It’s just the cherry on the shit sundae, isn’t it.</p><p> </p><p>Like all employees at St. Mungo’s, I go in the back entrance. The receiving door for Purge and Dowse Ltd. is boarded over, looking untouched by the decades. I have to wait in a short line of people in lime robes. I get the occasional envious look. The healers have been lobbying for a decade to change the colours of their robes, but the Ministry always lands on them whenever they do.</p><p>            I have a sip of my coffee. One thing I’ll never do is drink the stuff on the fifth floor. St. Mungo’s coffee is notoriously terrible, and everyone likes to make jokes about how it puts people in the hospital—ha ha—but I know for a fact there was a secret inquest last year when five people were admitted for just that. I’ll stick with the Coffee Republic around the corner, thank you.</p><p>            The woman in front of me whispers to the wall, then walks through it. I step up, looking at the sign that says, ‘No entry.’</p><p>            “Albus Potter,” I murmur. “Records.”</p><p>            Nothing happens at first.</p><p>            “Look, there’s no need to be cheeky—”</p><p>            The sign transforms momentarily, saying, ‘Enter.’ Sighing, I walk through the wall and into the hospital.</p><p>            It’s busy, but not chaos like out front. Most of the healers come in at seven. It’s just administrative staff and specialists who come in at nine. People are saying hello to one another, saying how glad they are to reach Friday, making plans for later.</p><p>            I slip through them all without attracting any attention.</p><p>            I’m up on the fifth floor, behind the tearoom and shop. Records isn’t on any sort of sign for visitors. There’s a byzantine process to go through if you want to access the place, so we only see a few every month. I take a look at the lift. There’s approximately twenty people standing in front of it. Bugger it.</p><p>            I walk over to the staff stairwell, pushing open the door. Immediately, the portraits begin diagnosing.</p><p>            “Hartwell’s Disease,” one witch says with authority. “Explains the sallow complexion!”</p><p>            “That’s not the Potter boy, is it? Not nearly as handsome as his father.”</p><p>            “It’s not Hartwell’s, you old charlatan,” a wizard in hot pink robes counters. “It is clearly Bollard’s Vexing. Look at the pouches under his eyes!”</p><p>            “<em>Hartwell’s</em>!”</p><p>            “<em>Bollard’s</em>!”</p><p>            Trooping up the rickety spiral staircase, I reply, “I love coming this way. Being judged first thing in the morning really sort of defines the day, don’t you think?”</p><p>            “There’s no reason to be tetchy,” the wizard in pink says. “Make an appointment with a healer to take care of that Bollard’s and those pouches will vanish seconds. Don’t and your fingernails will fall off!”</p><p>            “I’ll take it into consideration.”</p><p>            “Don’t listen to him!” says the witch, her voice becoming quieter as I reach the next storey of judgment. “Be treated for Hartwell’s or your tongue will grow too large for your mouth!”</p><p>            I tune out the voices flooding together, telling me what obscure disease I must have, due to my knobby knuckles, my ashy complexion, my body, my face. The first few days it bothered me. But I went to a healer outside of the hospital just to make sure I wasn’t really dying. She took one look at me after I asked if I might have Rellington’s Bone Shedding Syndrome and said, “Let me guess—recent hire at St. Mungo’s?”</p><p>            I get to the fifth floor only a bit out of breath. For me that’s a minor victory. I open the door and step out into the Records Department.</p><p>            It’s well lit, I can say that much for it. The light shining in gives a good idea of how everything is covered in a fine layer of dust. Papers zip along the ceiling, folded into birds and airplanes. Most people keep their doors cracked open so that the memos can go in and out. I see people already behind their desks, some under a mountain of paperwork, which makes my skin itch just looking at it. Others have organized everything into neat piles. The only person who consistently has an empty desk is Nadine, the head receptionist. She’s a surly, ancient witch who everyone is too afraid of to ask how she accomplishes such a feat.</p><p>            I take a quick glance about. I’ve a few minutes before my shift officially starts. Any luck, Suzette will be on the other side of the offices and I can just get to work in peace.</p><p>            So I put my eyes down and walk towards my office.</p><p>            I’m about halfway there when Suzette inevitably says from behind me, “Albus.”</p><p>            Fuck. Next job I take, I really need to vet whoever’s in charge first. Turning around, I try to look innocent, but I doubt that looks realistic on my face. “Morning, Suzette.”</p><p>            Suzette’s head of the Records Department. She’s as tall as me, a solid woman with close cropped greyish blond hair. She has glasses on a chain around her neck, but I’ve never actually seen them on her face. She eyes me over, and I wait to hear what I’ve done to displease her already.</p><p>            She exhales through her nose. I don’t know if she gets some kind of pleasure from picking away at me, but she seems compelled to do it. “We’ve spoken about this.”</p><p>            “Spoken about what?”</p><p>            Suzette glances at my lapel. Ah, so that’s what we’re going with today. “I’ve told you, it’s inappropriate for St. Mungo staff to have accessories that are political in nature.”</p><p>            I look at my Squib Rights pin and say, “What’s political about equal rights? That’s a moral question rather than a political one, wouldn’t you think? After all, who’d want to align themselves with a political party that doesn’t believe we’re all equal? Sounds a bit Death Eater-ish, you ask me.”</p><p>            Her eyes narrow slightly. I irk Suzette because I’m not entirely under her control. My contract is with the Ministry, not her. She’s notorious for brow beating her employees into automatons who do things exactly as she pleases. Me, well—I’ve never been good about authority figures.</p><p>            “Nonetheless, it’s not appropriate for the workplace. Remove it, please.”</p><p>            I shrug. “If you like.” I take the pin and slip it into one of my pockets. “Excuse me, I’d better get to my desk—” She clears her throat slightly and I stop. “Yes?”</p><p>            “I’m still waiting for your monthly report.”</p><p>            “It’s not due until Monday.”</p><p>            “Albus, one should learn initiative. Not everything needs to be left to the last moment.”</p><p>            “Well, I’ll have it on your desk for Monday. Was there anything else?”</p><p>            She looks at my outfit. I’m in tight trousers, a jumper, old trainers, a denim jacket. I can tell that she would love to go into my lack of professionalism when it comes to how I dress, but Suzette knows not to criticize more than two things about me in a morning. After all, I’m good at what I do, and I keep excellent records.</p><p>            “No,” she says reluctantly. “Best get to work. Plenty to do.”</p><p>            I walk away. When I hear her do the same, I pull out my wand and tap one of my other pins. It transforms from a cobra to violent fuchsia letters asking, ‘Have YOU paid your HOUSE ELF?’</p><p> </p><p>I hate and love my job.</p><p>            Doing the same thing for eight hours a day, five times a week, can be monotonous. I don’t get on with my coworkers, but again, I rarely get on with anyone. Suzette is a massive pain in my arse. She’s the kind of person who calls everyone by their first name in an effort at camaraderie, but I swear the only reason she doesn’t call me Mr. Potter is because she couldn’t bear to have my sainted father’s name in her mouth when she looks at me. Much as I don’t mind my commute, it’s still two hours a day. I’m alone, forgotten, and my hands are always cracked and sometimes bloody from how dry the dust makes them.</p><p>            The good outweighs the bad, however.</p><p>            I’m on a three year contract with the Ministry of Magical Health. My job is to collate all admission records into quantifiable categories. Like every other department in the Ministry, they’re incredibly behind when it comes to data collection, and that’s led to some unfortunate incidences. I’m not a researcher—no, I just organize all the information so that the real academics can draw conclusions. I am here to do the grunt work. And I do it quite well.</p><p>            My office is one of the neater ones. I do a good sweep with my wand in the morning to get all the dust out, and another one at lunch, and again when I leave for the day. Everything lands in straight small towers of paper that fill the room over the course of the day. My door is closed, to prevent noise coming in. Or out, frankly, because I play music in here, and that’s one of the things Suzette frowns upon. I find that it helps me concentrate, so I don’t particularly care about her opinion.</p><p>            There is a small lift in the wall that brings me new stacks of admission forms. Twice a day, I send papers out to go into Permanent Records, and once a day reports to the Ministry. I keep my eyes on specific pieces of information for certain groups. The amount that comes through this room is staggering.</p><p>            Which is to say, despite being a lowly admin, I have access to the medical information of every single person who comes through St. Mungo’s.</p><p>            Over the past two years, I’ve seen the names of every person who’s come into the hospital. I know their ages, their addresses, their occupations, their entire demographics. I know their complaints. I’m not going to deny I get a strange sense of power from it. I do. I sit here in my office, away from everyone else, privy to the secrets of the entire magical population.</p><p>            I go through the papers at a punishing pace, because if I didn’t, I’d drown. The thing about witches and wizards is that they’re always injuring themselves in new and interesting ways, and there’s a reason St. Mungo’s is bursting at the seams. I let the details wash over me, setting an alarm so that I don’t miss lunch.</p><p>            Six-year-old boy, feet swelled to five times their size. Breakout of chlamydia in Barthaby’s Seniors Residence. Mother of six with turnip lodged in ear. Amateur Quidditch player missing both knees, claims she woke up without them. An auror under a Whispering Cloud, severe case, referred to the fourth floor and mind healing, probable self inflicted curse. A House Elf discovered unconscious and unable to rouse, obvious butterbeer abuse but denied by owner. Indigent Muggle accidentally brought to A&amp;E, claiming to be a wizard who lost his powers. Mute girl from Blackpool suddenly starts speaking in what’s apparently Balanta, is of Irish-German descent. Elderly witch with broken hip after broom accident. Splinching. Curses. Spell damage. An exploding liver.</p><p>            I start by taking in the entire document with a look, then I break it down into its various components. I tally off gender, age group, category of injury or illness, etc. To make sure my numbers are accurate, I copy each data piece off the paper, shrunken, onto a running scroll, one for each category. Anonymized, of course.</p><p>            I know the various studies that are being run by the Ministry, and any time I see a data set I think might interest them specifically, I copy them onto their own parchment for case studies. It would be a terrible amount of paper, but I shrink it all to such a size that it’s barely readable to the naked eye. I keep my eyes peeled for cases that might interest specific researchers. Davish Llewyn is doing one on self inflicted injuries as related to job stress, so I copy the admission package for the auror, save the man’s name and address, and put it in one of the stacks. There’s a whole team doing research on substance abuse in magical creatures, so the House Elf gets copied to them.</p><p>            I’m not the smartest man, or the most ambitious man—Slytherin be damned—but I’m very good at putting everything in its proper place.</p><p>            Working steadily, I flick my wand through page after page, copying text this way and that, not really absorbing the raw data. Admittedly, taking a pause here and there when I see something interesting, but after two years of reading people’s medical records, very little really surprises me. You can only hear about magical folk inserting things incorrectly so many times before it ceases to be titillating.</p><p>            Grandmother pranked by grandchildren, vomiting flammable bubbles. Family of four with an undetermined illness that’s turned them all turquoise. Potionmaker with elephant trunk. A man from Sierra Leone who woke up without his fingers.</p><p>            When I feel like my eyes will cross, I switch over to organizing the stacks. I go through the categories. For age, I separate by ten year groups. I have a document that keeps a running tally of the numbers. So far today I have 12 0-10s, 5 10-20s (no surprise, the 11-18s are all up at Hogwarts), 8 20-30s, 7 30-40s, 7 40-50s, 8 50-60s, 7 60-70s, 13 70-80s, 15 80-90s, 8 90-100s, and 5 100+. The groups that always get in the most trouble are the youngest and 70-90. Never fails. The children can’t control their magic and are more susceptible to disease; the 70-90s are old enough to not give a shit about making stupid choices or are over confident in what they’re still able to do. After they reach 90, their bodies have slowed enough to stop a lot of the madness.</p><p>            I go through stack after stack, organizing the data, then return to the admission reports. I’m always busiest in the morning, dealing with the overnight reports. I spend most of my morning on the admission packages, and only really dig into organizing the data in the afternoon, with one last go around of everything an hour before the end of the day.</p><p>            Toddler with three forks stuck up his nose. Attempted petty theft at Gringott’s, irreversible spell damage. Elderly wizard accidentally chopped off hand and reattached it, hand now green and gelatinous. Wizard with horse’s tail and carrot in rectum—</p><p>            Peter Highbellow.</p><p>            I pluck the paper from the air. Unconventional insertion might no longer be titillating for me, but sometimes it can be quite telling. Leaning back in my chair, I bounce slightly and read the admission form, this time focusing completely.</p><p>            Peter Highbellow, 33 years of age, residing in West Brompton, brought in just past midnight March 31. Presented with functioning horse’s tail, brown in colour. Twelve centimeter carrot with foliage attached protruding from patient’s anus. Patient obviously intoxicated and unaware of location. Found roaming streets of Chelsea and brought in by aurors. Once sobering potions were applied, patient denied anything was amiss and vanished both tail and carrot. Refused further care, discharged self at 1:45.</p><p>            Now, a few things jump out at me.</p><p>            First and foremost, Peter Highbellow is an accountant for the Department of Magical Education. What in the ever-loving fuck is he doing to afford a flat in West Brompton? The Highbellows don’t come from money, so I know he’s not living off an inheritance. Galleons to garters he’s taking the Ministry for everything they’ve got.</p><p>            Yes, there’s also the carrot thing, but I don’t find that nearly as curious.</p><p>            I bend back in my chair, looking out into the hall. Not a person to be seen.</p><p>            With a flick of my wrist, I copy the entire package. I put it into the upper drawer of my desk, then sit back up. There’s only a half hour til lunch.</p><p>            Auror with eagle wings. Velvet footstool suspected of being a missing grandmother unable to transfigure back to original form, turned out to just be a footstool. Man with a beard that attempted to strangle him. Spell damage, transfiguration damage, rare disease, and on and on and on.</p><p> </p><p>I’m first to the table, which gives me a slight, smug smile. The both of us are always inveterately early. If I’m not at a place five minutes before I need to be, I’m late.</p><p>            The day is typical London, overcast, dreary, except it doesn’t feel like rain. I’m a bit chilly in only my denim jacket, so I wrap my green scarf around my neck, then take my lunch from my bag.</p><p>            The park isn’t too far from the Ministry. A lot of their employees come out here for lunch if they don’t go to the cafeteria on site. There will be more of them here once the weather begins warming, but for now I only spot a handful of magic folk. I even know most of their names, though I make it a personal point of pride to never enter the Ministry unless under extreme duress. Except the cafeteria, of course. There are traditions to uphold.</p><p>            For lunch, I have a veg sandwich and an apple. And a wedge of cheese. I’ve tried being vegan but I passed out on the third day, so I think vegetarian is as far as I’ll ever make it. I have the same cup of coffee I’ve been working on for three and a half hours, and I give it a surreptitious poke with my wand to warm it up again.</p><p>            I unwrap my sandwich and take a bite, then get my book. I’m halfway through an old murder mystery by Rothilda Rupchic, and I already know that the ghoul did it, but it’s well written and I needed a break after rereading <em>King Lear</em>.</p><p>            I’m just getting to the chamber scene, which is always my favourite bit, having the protagonist reveal how they came to their ornate conclusion, when a trembling voice says, “Mr. Potter?”</p><p>            Sighing, I don’t bother looking up. “No.”</p><p>            She sits down anyways. I don’t lift my eyes from the book, but I do a lot of my looking from my peripheral vision. Middle aged, woeful face, holding a bag like my grandmother did, probably with half her possessions in it.</p><p>            “Mr. Potter,” she says, “my name’s Honora Glopshawl—”</p><p>            “I don’t care.”</p><p>            “My son—my Alastair—he’s gotten himself in a spot of trouble with the aurors. A misunderstanding—a terrible misunderstanding. He was just hanging out with some friends, you see—he had no idea what they were up to—”</p><p>            “I still don’t care.”</p><p>            “He’s a good boy—just in the wrong place at the wrong time, you see—oh, Mr. Potter, could you please talk to your father? He’s such a good boy, he only made a mistake, and he didn’t mean to, he’s only eighteen, if you could just tell your father—”</p><p>            I finally put down my book and look her straight in the eyes. “Madam. Let me make this perfectly clear. My father would give precisely zero shits about your son, regardless of whether I interceded or not. My father, despite his sterling reputation, cares about one thing, and it’s exactly that: his reputation. I’m not going to debase myself for no reason for a criminal. Whatever your son did, he can pay for it. It’s no concern of mine. Good day to you.”</p><p>            I pick my book up, turning the page.</p><p>            It takes a few seconds, but Mrs. Glopshawl says, “I heard, but I didn’t believe it. You’re terrible.”</p><p>            “The worst,” I agree, then wave her off. “You may leave.”</p><p>            She stands. She also takes the time to say, “Your parents must be ashamed of you.”</p><p>            I nod. “You’ve no idea.” I turn the page, as Gracille, the intrepid reporter from the city, begins to confront the suspects. Mrs. Glopshawl stands there another moment before I hear her toddle off.</p><p>            I’m well aware that people think I’m cruel. That I’m unapproachable. That’s for the best. When they thought there might be hope for me, I was mobbed by people who wanted access to my father. There’s been precious few people in my life who have seen me as I am, instead of a means to an end.</p><p>            “Making friends?”</p><p>            “Always,” I reply.</p><p>            Scorpius drops into the recently vacated seat across from me with a resounding thud. “Yeah, you draw people to you like honey brings flies.”</p><p>            “If this is your way of telling me I’m sweet, I’m flattered.”</p><p>            “No, on second thought, it was a misguided use at metaphor. Like flies to arsenic, maybe. Are flies attracted to arsenic? This metaphor really is falling apart.”</p><p>            I lay down my book. I give him my attention, as I always do.</p><p>            He’s in the grey today. Scorpius’ wardrobe is typically pristine. One of the traits he got from his father. He’s left the robes at the office, just clad in grey slacks and vest, a white shirt with snake cufflinks. “Have to look the part!” he told me cheerfully once when I asked why he dressed so well for his lowly position. “Dress like you’re going places, and you will!”</p><p>            “That was a simile.”</p><p>            Scorpius answers, “Don’t be pedantic,” but he doesn’t do it with a roll of the eyes like our other friends would. He knows me so well that all my sharp edges seem to just roll over him, rarely meeting their mark. He has his lunch in a brown paper bag, which he starts unpacking, so I continue eating. “Who was she?”</p><p>            “I’ve already forgotten.”</p><p>            “You forget nothing.”</p><p>            “I know. It’s a blessing and a curse.”</p><p>            “You don’t believe that for a second. You’re a dragon atop the golden hoard.”</p><p>            “Is this your subtle way of telling me you finally read <em>Beowulf</em>?”</p><p>            “It is not. I’ll get there eventually.” Once his lunch is unpacked before him, Scorpius folds his arms on the table and looks at me. “So?”</p><p>            Of our small group, Scorpius is the one who got the looks. Skin china-doll fair, silver eyes, corn silk curls. Cheeks always tinted pink. Delicate and handsome all at once.</p><p>            I take a bite of my apple and shrug. “So?”</p><p>            He drops his head a second. “<em>So</em>—I’m going to propose to Rose tonight.”</p><p>            Not missing a beat, I reply, “How will it be different from the other two times?”</p><p>            “It will be different because the time is right.” I raise a brow so high I can feel it encroaching on my hairline, but Scorpius is undeterred. “When I first asked her, we were barely out of Hogwarts. We were too young, she was right about that. Last time I asked, she was trying to get promoted, she had to focus on work, it wasn’t a good time.”</p><p>            “Scorpius.”</p><p>            “What?”</p><p>            “Should you say the obvious or should I?”</p><p>            “I don’t know what you mean.”</p><p>            “Oh no, of course not. It’s nothing to do with the fact that you’ve been going mad the past few weeks about how distant she’s been, and this certainly isn’t some last ditch effort to save the relationship.”</p><p>            “It is not,” Scorpius insists. Shaking my head, I keep eating. Scorpius pats his hands on the table as he tries to make his points. “She’s <em>always</em> said that we would be married—”</p><p>            “Not in years—”</p><p>            “That we just had to wait for the right time, and now that the bill is finally wrapping up—”</p><p>            “Oh yes, let’s hope for that, shall we? Let’s hope my bigoted, ignorant cousin pushes through her vile law so that you two can plan a wedding in peace.”</p><p>            Scorpius drops his head back on his shoulders, groaning. “Can we not get into this right now—” </p><p>            Leaning forward, I say, “Yes, let’s <em>ban</em> Squibs from Hogwarts, shall we? Let’s have an actual law pass through the Wizengamot creating an inferior legal class of humans. That’s not alarming at all.”</p><p>            “It’s not about creating a second class,” Scorpius says weakly.</p><p>            “It bloody well is. What’s she going to ban Squibs from next? St. Mungo’s?”</p><p>            “It’s not about—she’s not <em>banning</em> Squibs from Hogwarts, just from attending, which they already don’t—I can’t believe I’ve let you do this to me again, you’re baiting me—”</p><p>            “<em>I’m</em> not baiting you. I’m simply reminding you that your girlfriend is a bigot on the verge of disenfranchising an entire subsection of the magical community and that you don’t have the pluck to say anything about it.”</p><p>            “I am not here to take sides,” Scorpius says stubbornly. “Everyone has valid points, and we’re getting off track.”</p><p>            “You know, there’s a term for people who don’t take sides.”</p><p>            “Common sense.”</p><p>            “Coward.”</p><p>            Scorpius looks at me in consternation. I do feel strongly on the topic—Rose, despite being my cousin, despite having dated my best friend for seven years, despite being one of the brightest people I’ve ever known, is also power hungry to the point of damaging the magical community—but I do also enjoy winding Scorpius up.</p><p>            “I’m going to ask her to marry me,” Scorpius says.</p><p>            “Going to use the same ring you used the other two times?” I respond, having another bite of apple.</p><p>            Exhaling, Scorpius says, “Yes, it was my mother’s ring—”</p><p>            “Third time’s the charm, eh?”</p><p>            “Why do I get the impression you’re not taking this seriously?”</p><p>            “Because I’m not.”</p><p>            “Well, you should. I’m going to ask her to marry me, and she’ll say yes. The time is right, we’ve been together seven years, it’s time we should start having children—everything is in the proper place.”</p><p>            I don’t have the heart to state the truth. Rose has no interest in marrying Scorpius. She’s a rising star at the Ministry, already Junior Minister of the Department of Magical Education at the age of 24. She’s the daughter of the former Minister, a position—perish the thought—she’ll likely hold herself in ten to fifteen years. Scorpius, for all his striving, is still barely above an entry level position in the Department of Magical Housing. Not because he’s not good at his job—he’s brilliant—or because he doesn’t try—he tries harder than any person I know—but because he’s a Malfoy. And there’s no changing that.</p><p>            In the end, Rose will let him loose. My cousin is coldly logical. She’s taken this disgusting political position to distinguish herself from my aunt, not from any deep personal conviction. Rose will stay with Scorpius long enough to prove that she’s not swayed by opinions about her personal life, then dump him for someone more appropriate. My money has always been on Tim, the current Minister’s son, and Hugo’s friend. Rose will never marry Scorpius.</p><p>            I tell myself this whenever I worry otherwise.</p><p>            “Best of luck,” I say.</p><p>            “You know,” Scorpius says, “if you weren’t always so pessimistic about every little thing—”</p><p>            “I wouldn’t be me. Besides, I just told you, best of luck.”</p><p>            “You’ll have to be my best man, you know. You’ll have to make up with Rose.”</p><p>            I point to my Squib pin, back in pride of place on my jacket. “So help me Merlin, I’ll wear this as my boutonniere if I’m in the wedding party.”</p><p>            “You’ll be my best man, won’t you?”</p><p>            “Of course I will. I’ll also bring Rylance McTavish as my date,” I say, naming the head of the Squib Protection League. He’s quite fit. I’ve made the effort once or twice, but he continues to be straight, which is a tragedy.</p><p>            “That’s your prerogative. I’m not going to make a big show of it. Just her and I at home tonight. No fuss, just say, ‘Rose, I love you with all my heart, will you marry me?’ Earnest. Straight forward.”</p><p>            “Don’t want a repeat of the balloon fiasco.”</p><p>            Grimacing, Scorpius says, “No. I found one stuck in the attic last month, did I tell you? I had to set it on fire to finally bring it down. Rose was dreadful cross about it.”</p><p>            “I’ll just put it out there, but if she says no, there’s plenty of suitable women out there who—”</p><p>            “<em>No</em>,” Scorpius says strongly. “I don’t want other women. You know I don’t. I only want her.”</p><p>            It’s one of the most obnoxious things about him. Beyond the relentless optimism and built-in armour against my barbs, that is. Scorpius has never show an interest in anyone but my cousin. I’d say it was obsessive, but it’s not. He’s just in love with her, a kind, attentive partner who’s always put her needs above his own. The clueless bastard.</p><p>            “Fair enough. All the best, Scorpius, I’m sure it will be a stunning success.”</p><p>            He smiles. “Good of you to say that, even though I know you don’t mean a word of it. So—off to your parents’ tonight, then?”</p><p>            I drop my sandwich, and he grins at me cheekily. Narrowing my eyes, I cross my arms and say, “You sure you wouldn’t rather come with me instead? Act as my buffer?”</p><p>            “Yeah, everyone’s so comfortable when I’m there.”</p><p>            The truth is, Scorpius has been invited to several family dinners over the past year, but I’ve never told him about it. I’d rather keep him safe from my family, thank you very much. “I’m half tempted to wander into the infectious ward to see what I can pick up in the next four hours.”</p><p>            “You can only do that so many times before they catch on.”</p><p>            “To be fair, I only did it once. On accident.”</p><p>            “Albus.”</p><p>            “All right, it wasn’t an accident, but I didn’t know the rash would be that severe, did I.” Sighing, I say, “They’re all going to be there.”</p><p>            In surprise, Scorpius says, “What, Lily too?”</p><p>            “Yeah, I guess we’re giving that another go.”</p><p>            “Unexpected.”</p><p>            “I suspect Mum’s put a protective spell over all the valuables. I mean, the ones Lil hasn’t already stolen.”</p><p>            “How long’s she have this time?”</p><p>            “Three months. Right after James’ thing.”</p><p>            “What’s it like to finally be the most well adjusted of your siblings?”</p><p>            “I’ve always been the most well adjusted, only no one’s cared to notice before.”</p><p>            “You know what’s amazing? You said that with a straight face.”</p><p>            “Only time this face has ever been described as thus, mate.” I break the wedge of cheese in half and toss him a piece. Scorpius catches it, then begins picking it apart. “Any word on that promotion?”</p><p>            “Just around the corner,” Scorpius says with certainty. “The Minister’s secretary is retiring soon, and I have seniority. It’s all going to start happening, Albus. Mark my words.”</p><p>            I could tell him it won’t. I could tell him he’ll be passed over, like he has been for the last five years. Instead, I smile and say softly, “Cheers.”</p><p> </p><p>We’re about to part ways at the corner when Scorpius says, “I’ll owl you. When she says yes. I’ll want you to be first to know.”</p><p>            I glance at him, and see that under the surface, he’s a ball of nerves. The past two months, Rose has hardly been home, always at the Ministry. She’s never there for dinner, cancels all their plans, and when she is there, she hardly says more than two words to him. The last time we were all together was my uncle’s 50<sup>th</sup> birthday at the start of March, and she was positively cold to Scorpius.</p><p>            And Scorpius, he might be a relentless optimist, but he also works himself in circles. He’s tried scheduling dates, buying her books, making her dinner to have at the office, giving her space, anything and everything. To be frank, this is the nuclear option.</p><p>            “You don’t have to,” I say.</p><p>            “I want to. I want you to know the good news.”</p><p>            Stopping, I tell him, “But if it’s not good news—”</p><p>            “It will be.”</p><p>            “If it’s not, it’s not the end of the world. All right? She’s said no before. She might again.”</p><p>            “Not this time,” Scorpius insists. I don’t know if he really believes it or if he’s attempting to convince himself. He puts a hand on my shoulder. “You’ll understand. When you meet the right fellow, and you fall in love, it will make sense.”</p><p>            Making a fool of myself because I fell in love with the wrong person. Yes, I could never understand that. I look at his eyes, seeing how bloodshot they are. “You’re right. Send that stupid blind owl over, if you think she can find the place in the dark.”</p><p>“I don’t know why you’re always going on about that,” Scorpius says, pulling me into a hug. “She sees perfectly fine.”</p><p>            I pat his back, sighing. “Yeah, 20/20 vision, that one.”</p><p>            Scorpius steps away, giving my arm a light hit. “Don’t hex anyone tonight.”</p><p>            “You sure your father wouldn’t adopt me?” I ask with a weak laugh.</p><p>            “You wouldn’t want to be a Malfoy,” Scorpius says, walking away.</p><p>            I call after him, “You wouldn’t want to be a Potter!”</p><p>            I wait to make sure he gets across the street all right—he has a terrible habit of not looking both ways when he’s tired—then I turn back in the direction of St. Mungo’s.</p><p>            My eyes catch on a figure across the street. He’s nattily dressed in a green and purple suit, with a turquoise shirt. He sits on the side of a concrete statue, eating a sandwich.</p><p>            He catches my eyes, and raises a brow.</p><p>            I give him a slight nod, and as I walk away, raise my hand, showing him five fingers, then three. I turn around the corner, and walk to St. Mungo’s.</p><p> </p><p>The back door doesn’t give me any sass when I try entering the hospital. I step inside, and nearly into Healer Morrow.</p><p>            He gives me an irritated look, but I see that he’s being pursued. A young woman with curly brown hair, exhausted about the eyes, desperate. Patient family, make no mistake.</p><p>            “Please, <em>sir</em>,” she pleads, as I step around them. It’s 1:30, so there’s no one lined up for the lift. “Please, I know that with a little more time—”</p><p>            “Miss Vega,” Morrow sighs. I jab the button for the fifth floor, trying to mind my own business. More or less. I’m a terrible eavesdropper, and I know it. “It’s been months with zero sign of progress. He has to be moved to the Janus Thickey Ward. It’s not negotiable.”</p><p>            “It’s not the proper place for him! That place is for people who won’t get better—”</p><p>            “Miss Vega, we’ve spoken about this—”</p><p>            “I want a second opinion. I want someone else to look at him.”</p><p>            The lift is stuck on the third floor. I might be a snoop, but it’s almost unbearable, hearing a family member who refuses to listen to a healer. Not like they haven’t trained for years. And they don’t just ship people off to the Janus Thickey if there’s hope.</p><p>            “You’ve had second opinions. And third opinions, and fourth. In fact, you’ve had the opinions of the finest healers St. Mungo has to offer. Your brother has taken a bed downstairs for far longer than has been necessary. The ethics board has reviewed his case, and this is their decision. And mine. Now, if you’ll excuse me—”</p><p>            “Please—”</p><p>            “Your brother is being moved as we speak. You’ll find him on the fourth floor. Excuse me.”</p><p>            The lift finally begins coming down. I tap my toe. Don’t let her get on the lift with me. I’ve little patience for complaining about hospital procedure. I know it’s inexplicable at times, but I’m also strangely proprietary of the place after two years.</p><p>            The door opens, and I quickly step back. There’s a mass of cactus emerging from inside. A healer is floating it with her wand, covered in prickles. “Out of the way!” she yelps, and I press myself against the wall. She rushes past me, and I hear someone cry out. “I said, out of the way!” The healer bustles off.</p><p>            The girl with the curly hair is holding a hand to her face. She’s staring after the healer. When she lifts her hand, the cut on her cheek wells with blood.  </p><p>            I look at the open lift, then back to the girl. Fuck. “You should go to Admitting.”</p><p>            She looks at me. “Sorry?”</p><p>            “Whatever that was, you should get your cheek looked at.”        </p><p>            “No. No, I need to—” She stops herself. She doesn’t seem to know what to do.</p><p>            This is more involved than I like to be in anything to do with the hospital. Wiggling my ankle, I say, “Listen. Go to Admitting. Say that a healer just accidentally cut you and walked away without checking to see if she’d done any damage. Say you want to sue under Provision 736. 736, understand? They’ll have your face fixed in about ten minutes. Lean on them hard enough, you could probably keep your brother out of the Janus Thickey awhile.” I turn away, hitting the button for the lift again. The doors reopen, and I step inside. “You’re right, you know. He goes in there, he’s never coming out. They just leave people there to die.”</p><p>            The doors close.</p><p> </p><p>End of the day. I’ve cleared out every single pile of paper. They’ve either gone to Permanent Records or to the Ministry. When I come in on Monday, there will be a weekend’s worth of paper to go through, but I can worry about that later.</p><p>            I lock the door to my office—I do my own cleaning, so there’s no reason for the janitor to go in—then give a quick look both ways before making a quick escape to the stairs. Everyone else is chatting, talking about going out for drinks. I keep my head down.</p><p>            “Albus.”</p><p>            Fuck me sideways with a centaur’s dick. Can I please not just get out of here? “Yes, Suzette?”</p><p>            She’s giving me the same expression I got this morning. “I thought before you left I’d have that report on my desk.”</p><p>            “I’m sorry you’ve forgotten since earlier, but it’s not due until Monday. We discussed it this morning, remember?”</p><p>            “I thought our conversation might have inspired you to show some initiative.”</p><p>            “No, I was too busy clearing the deck before I left for the weekend. Pity no one else seems to have done the same.” I lean to the side, having a look down the hall into her office. “Late night, I see? Looks like you still have plenty to go through.”</p><p>            Suzette is studying me so intently I half expect her to try legilimens on me. Tough. I’m by no means a great wizard, but one thing I’m quite adept at is keeping other people out of my mind.</p><p>            Whatever she’s trying to find, she fails. Standing straighter, Suzette says, “I’ll expect the report first thing on Monday.”</p><p>            “As per my contract, the monthly report is due end of day on the first Monday of the following month. So I will have it for you by the end of the day on Monday.” I open the door to the staircase. “Have a good weekend.”</p><p>            The portraits immediately start diagnosing me, but it’s easier to ignore them. It’s a Friday. Yes, I have to be at my parents’ in an hour’s time, and yes, Suzette will still be passive aggressive on Monday morning, but for now I have a weekend to myself.</p><p>            Besides, I finished that report nearly a week ago. I’m only holding onto it to spite her.</p><p>            Enough of this place. I need to get to the Tube.</p><p>            I have an appointment in Gunnersbury.</p><p> </p><p>I find Sian on the outer edge of the wildlife reserve. He looks out of place, in his purple and green, absentmindedly eating something out of a paper bag. Every time I’ve ever met up with the man, he’s had something in his mouth. I don’t understand it, thin as he is. I’m not one to talk. I’m practically skin and bones.</p><p>            When Sian sees me, he gives me a two fingered wave, then goes back to whatever he’s studying. I follow his gaze to a few birds up in the trees. They’re picking determinedly at something.</p><p>            I sit beside him on the bench. “Bird watching?”</p><p>            “I think they’ve killed and eaten one of their own.”</p><p>            “They have not. Those are sparrows. They’re not carnivores.”</p><p>            Sian shrugs. “Sure look it.” He offers me the bag. Popcorn. It smells of chemicals masquerading as butter. I grimace and shake my head. “Suit yourself. Good of you to come out on a Friday.”</p><p>            “I’m supposed to be at my parents’ in a half hour, so it’s no trouble. Saves me having to make small talk.”</p><p>            Sian raises his brow, but doesn’t push the topic. He asked me once if I was interested in telling him about my family, and when I told him no, he never asked again. He puts the bag of popcorn down on the bench, then brushes off his hands.</p><p>            Without having to be asked, I take an index card out of my jacket pocket and pass it to him. Everything on it is shrunk so small that it can barely be read. Still, Sian is able to decipher it as if it were clear as day.</p><p>            I look up. There was a little snow this winter, but it melted weeks ago. All that’s left is brown, brown, brown. I’m not fond of summer, but I’ll be glad to have things green again.</p><p>            Sian reads silently beside me. I don’t ask him if he can use any of it. By this point, I know what will interest him and what won’t.</p><p>            “West Brompton,” he says. “How’s he affording that?”</p><p>            “Thought that might catch your eye.”</p><p>            Sian makes a sound from the back of his throat. “I can use the carrot bit as well, should it come to it. Imagine all the puns in the headlines. I hate puns.”</p><p>            “The lowest form of word play,” I agree.</p><p>            Sian slips the card into his pocket. “The others are worth a bit as well. You’re getting quite good at this, Albus.” He pulls out his wallet, and begins leafing through bills.</p><p>            I look at him flatly. “Sure you don’t want to just leave it on the night stand?”</p><p>            “Oh, cheer up, love. You’ve made quite the pretty penny today.” Sian holds out a small stack of paper money. “You wouldn’t have made nearly this much, gobbling down the preacher’s cock.”</p><p>            I take the money and count through it. It’s Muggle money. The Ministry doesn’t bother tracking Muggle bank accounts, not that I keep much in mine. I prefer to have my money where I can access it easily. Or destroy it, should the authorities ever come knocking. It’s smart to have a large reserve of paper money on hand, something I learned from Mr. Malfoy.</p><p>            Of course, if someone just decides to take it, you’re fucked.</p><p>            After the first ten bills, I pause. “What’s the extra for?”</p><p>            “My employer wanted to show her appreciation, like. A yearly bonus, if you prefer.”</p><p>            I consider declining, but that would be stupid. Sian and I are in unique position. I don’t know who he works for, and his boss doesn’t know who I am. I entered into this arrangement of my own free will, knowing what it would cost me if it went wrong. I’m in it for the money, so I’m not going to complain when extra comes my way.</p><p>            “My thanks to your employer, then.” I tap the money with my wand, disguising it as tissues, and stuff it into my bag. “Was there anything particular you’d like me to look for?”</p><p>            “Tis, but you’ll claim the moral high ground.” Sian smiles slyly at that.</p><p>            There’s very little moral high ground to be had here. “What if I didn’t?”</p><p>            Lifting his shoulders, Sian says, “There’s a woman at Gringott’s. Shelley Tieran. She brought her daughter in last week. I know someone who’s quite curious about the particulars.”</p><p>            I have few scruples and zero illusions about what I’m doing. I sell confidential medical information through a middle man to the highest bidder. I’m a crook, and there’s no way for me to justify what I’m doing. Nonetheless, I have a single line that I draw. I want nothing to do with anything involving children.</p><p>            I smile at him crookedly. “Ah. The high ground it is.”</p><p>            “Aren’t you the saint.” Sian picks up his popcorn again, searching through it for a good kernel. “My love to your nearest and dearest.”</p><p>            “Ugh. Don’t remind me.” I tighten the knot of my scarf, then push the hair back from my forehead.</p><p>            “You’re looking all right these days.”</p><p>            I look over at him. Sian gazes back, calm as always. “You know,” I tell him, “I used to be flattered by you saying that, until I realized you’d fuck anything with two legs.”</p><p>            Sian scoffs. “That’s a bit discriminatory, isn’t it? I’d fuck ‘em regardless whether they had legs or not.”</p><p>            “See you next month,” I say, standing up.</p><p>            “You know where I’ll be.” He snaps his wrist and the popcorn goes sailing unnaturally far, pegging one of the sparrows. It flaps into the air with an offended squawk.</p><p>            Shaking my head, I disapparate.</p><p> </p><p>I come out at the end of the lane. Once I have a look at my childhood home, I seriously consider turning around and checking out that bar in Brighton I’ve heard about.</p><p>            Only Mum peeks out the front window. She’s seen me, so it’ll be hard to escape now. She waves at me with a bright smile. Sighing, I wave back, then start down the lane.</p><p>            My parents have lived in the same house since before I was born. They bought it planning to have plenty of children, and I imagine they’ve kept it after we all moved out in the hopes that there will someday be grandchildren running about. They’re probably having the first pangs of worry about that. We’ve entered breeding age, but we’re all hopeless in our own ways.</p><p>            My hope is that they’ll convince Granddad to move in with them. They have the space, and they’re not far from Ottery St. Catchpole. None of us like the thought of him out at the Burrow by himself. But he’s dead set on never leaving, and I can’t say I blame him, not really. I’ve been in my house three years now, and I would kill the first person who tried to dislodge me.</p><p>            The front door opens, and Mum steps out on the porch. “Cutting it close,” she calls.</p><p>            “Don’t tell me I missed Dad quizzing everyone on what we intend to do with the rest of our lives. I’d be heartbroken; you know that’s my favourite part of these get togethers.”</p><p>            Mum takes a breath, fixing me with a look. “Are you going to be like this the whole time you’re here?”</p><p>            I nod, climbing the steps and opening my arms. “Only if I have to deal with my brother,” I answer as Mum wraps her arms around my waist. “Or my sister. Or my father. Or you, if you decide to really get going about the Harpies again.”</p><p>            “The coach this season is <em>abominable</em>,” Mum mutters against my chest. She steps back, giving me a good look. I don’t try to look more cheerful or more unhappy. I don’t pretend with Mum. I don’t pretend with anyone, really, but her least of all. We don’t always see eye to eye, but I know she love me. Mum settles on, “You look good.”</p><p>            Which is obviously a bold-faced lie. “Thank you. You look—like my mother.”</p><p>            Mum rolls her eyes and pushes me inside. “Oh Al. You and your silver tongue.”</p><p>            The door closes behind me, and I cringe. Only for a moment. Shucking my shoes, I say, “So? The fine china disappeared yet?”</p><p>            Crossing her arms, Mum says, “Promise me—”</p><p>            “I’m not making any promises.”</p><p>            “Albus—”</p><p>            “I’ll be here, I will do my best, but if you expect me to be kind, then we both know you’ll be disappointed.”</p><p>            Mum frowns, but she slips her arm through mine. “Do you know why you’re so sour all the time?” she asks, guiding me down the hall. “Your heart’s too big, and you’re afraid of it being broken. So hit them before they hit you.”</p><p>            “Nah. I’ve never won in a fight.”</p><p>            “You win all the fights you’re in.”</p><p>            “I mean physically. I’ve actually avoided most physical fights. I somehow avoided that Gryffindor quality of blundering into all situations flailing my fists.”</p><p>            “Cunning, cunning.”</p><p>            We look at one another. There are new lines leading from Mum’s eyes. I bend my head down, and we press our foreheads together. We gaze into one another’s eyes, smiling slightly.</p><p>            Mum is the closest thing I have to a safe place in this house. But she has to be that for everyone else too.</p><p>            I hear voices from the dining room, and tense up. Mum drags me forward. “Oh, it’s not that bad. Don’t be so melodramatic all the time.”</p><p>            “Yeah. Melodramatic.”</p><p>            She pulls me through the doorway, and there’s no running now. Everyone is seated at the table. The food is waiting to go on plates. They look at me, clearly waiting on me to start.</p><p>            “Good of you to join us,” Dad says. Then he does what he always does. He flinches. Like he knows he said the wrong thing to me, but can’t figure out why, and can’t think of what he should have said instead.</p><p>            I inhale, stepping towards the table. “Evening, everyone.”</p><p>            Same as always, I have one side of the table to myself. Lily and James are across from me. It’s tradition at this point. Stems from when we were kids, and James bullied me so badly that he wasn’t allowed to sit beside me at the table any longer.</p><p>            “Good to see you,” James says.</p><p>            I give a little nod, taking my seat. I’m not going to tell him it’s good to see him, because he looks like warmed over shit.</p><p>            “Al,” Lily says, looking uninterested.</p><p>            “Lily,” I reply, pulling my napkin into my lap.</p><p>            My presence has obviously created a pall over the proceedings. I feel like whenever I walk into a room with these people, the conversation stops. Like I’m some sort of blight visited upon them.</p><p>            No one says anything a second. Then Mum says, far too chipper, “Let’s eat, shall we?”</p><p> </p><p>My family is a paradox. I feel like I know them utterly. I also feel like we’re absolute strangers whenever we’re in the same room.</p><p>            Mum’s doing her best. She always does. She’s the glue that’s kept our queer little group even tangentially united. We might not care for each other, but we adore her. Any time the conversation flags, which is frequently, she changes the topic, or tells a story.</p><p>            She’s getting older, which frightens me. She’s not <em>old</em>, I don’t mean that, but I remember when her hair was all red, and she would do laps around the property at top speed. She was strong enough that I remember being little and she would lift all three of us at once. Only for a few seconds, but still. Now she’s gotten quite thin. Her short hair is shot through with grey, and the red in her hair is not as bright as I remember. She’s 49, same as Dad, and it’s hard to look at her and know that she’s going to just keep getting older. We all are, but with Mum, I guess I feel a bit differently about it.</p><p>            Mum reaches out, squeezing James’ shoulder. “Get a bit of that meat there, love. Put some colour in your cheeks.”</p><p>            He smiles wanly, and does what she says. That’s James in a nutshell. Follow literally any instruction given to him.</p><p>            She’s right, though—he’s pale. He’s usually somewhere between Lily and I when it comes to complexion, but he’s downright ashy, which is my purview, thank you very much. James looks the most like Dad, but lighter, more solid along the jawline. His hair is tameable, and he’s handsome, enough that he would use it as a weapon. He’s been knocked down a few pegs the last few months, though.</p><p>            I can’t help but take a glance at his arm. Or rather, where his arm was. Just an absence now, sleeve neatly sewed shut at the right shoulder.</p><p>            James is an auror. Was. Is. I’m not sure if he’s going back or not. We certainly haven’t spoken about it. Three months ago, his arm was cursed off. No spelling it back or growing a new one. He got a medal, and there were all sorts of headlines in the paper about a third generation of heroic Potters.</p><p>            Of course, I know the real story, but I doubt he’s aware of that.</p><p>            “How’s work been, Dad?” Lily asks.</p><p>            Dad has a mouthful of food. He glances at her, giving a little bit of a nod, and pushes his food around the plate.</p><p>            Wow. He must be pretty upset still if he won’t talk about work.</p><p>            Of course, he has good reason. We all do.</p><p>            Lily hesitates, then tries again. “Any interesting cases?”</p><p>            Dad shrugs. “Once you get to be Minister of the Department, it’s less about cases and more about budgetary requests. James—have you had any luck with the wand specialist?”</p><p>            Lily looks uncertain of herself, which is rare. She clears her throat and keeps eating.</p><p>            She looks better than the last time I saw her. She showed up on my doorstep a few weeks before her latest stint in rehab, bones trying to stick through her skin, hair dirty, expensive clothes soiled. I didn’t answer the door. I closed the curtains and went to bed. She’s put on some weight, and she looks beautiful again. Lily’s always been beautiful. She has Mum’s red hair, and Dad’s green eyes, and she has pale skin.</p><p>            People never believe we’re brother and sister.</p><p>            “Some,” James says. “I…was able to transfigure a rabbit into a sofa.”</p><p>            He glances at me, eyes narrowed. He expects me to make a cutting remark. Albus, the bitter middle child, crowing over his disabled hero elder brother learning to cast with his non-dominant wand hand. I don’t need to comment, however. I eat my roasted potatoes and stay disengaged.</p><p>            After years of rising to the bait, I’ve learned that my siblings—and my father—expect me to be petty. That allows them to feel superior or aggrieved, and I take much more satisfaction in thwarting them.</p><p>            Most of the time. Not always.</p><p>            “That’s good,” Dad says.</p><p>            “Excellent, James,” Mum adds.</p><p>            I can see that James wants to say it’s not good at all. That it’s a terrible embarrassment for the oldest son of Harry Potter to be struggling with a simple transfiguration spell. But James just nods, a tic pulsing in his jaw.</p><p>            Dad turns his attention towards me. Please, let it be something innocuous. “And you, Al? What’s new in your life?”</p><p>            I shake my head. “Nothing.”</p><p>            Dad looks at me the way he always does. Disappointed.</p><p>            Dad is…well, he’s Dad. He’s always been this way, and he’ll never change. When I was younger, I thought that maybe we’d have a different kind of relationship. There were even a few times when it seemed like he was going to really make the effort. Merlin knows I tried. But it’s never worked out.</p><p>            I know that people look at him and they see the saviour of the magical world. They see the famous Harry Potter. I just see my father. Greying hair pulled back in a ponytail to show off his scar, age lines on his brown skin, going soft around the middle from office work. I see the man who told me he wished I wasn’t his son, who asked me why I always had to embarrass him, who missed nearly every birthday because something more important at the Ministry came up.</p><p>            Scorpius was wrong—I do remember everything, but it’s not always a blessing. I remember everything, and I forgive very little.</p><p>            “Surely there’s something new,” Mum prompts.</p><p>            Stubbornly, I shake my head. “I work, I go home. I see my friends, I read. That’s about the extent of it.”</p><p>            “Well, how are your friends?”</p><p>            “Fine.”</p><p>            “What’s Hugo up to? Heading off on another trip?”</p><p>            “None that I’ve heard of.”</p><p>            “What about Scorpius?”</p><p>            I remember that at this moment, he’s probably proposing to Rose. I get a sudden, vicious wave of doubt. Then I shove it deep, deep down. “Oh, same old, same old. Best at his job in the department.” I glance at Dad. “But no one seems willing to give him a chance.”</p><p>            Dad studiously avoids my gaze.</p><p>            I look at Mum with a smile. “What about you? What’s the inside word on—Quidditch, is it? Is that the game you like?”</p><p>            Mum smirks at me. I’m hopeless at sports. I honestly do not give a fuck, despite being the product of two athletic parents. Mum says, “Well—between just us here at the table, they’re talking about trading Chester Barnes.”</p><p>            Mum goes off on Quidditch, which gives me the opportunity to check out.</p><p>            I can’t help but see it in my mind. Scorpius on one knee in the living room. Rose with her face in papers from work, obviously. Lowering them when she realizes what he’s doing. I know she’s going to say no, of course she is. Except in my mind’s eye, she says yes. She smiles, a wide, happy smile the likes of which we rarely see from her. I see him smile, with relief and joy. I see them happy.</p><p>            If he’s happy, then I’m happy. That’s how it’s always been. That’s just reality. Make the best of a bad situation.</p><p>            Lily’s jittering. I watch her carefully. She’s bouncing her leg under the table, staring off into space.</p><p>            She catches me looking and scowls. Like I’ve done something wrong. ‘What?’ she mouths. I arch a brow. Like she doesn’t bloody know. She’s got some nerve, pretending like everything’s fine and dandy, her being in this house.</p><p>            “I’ve been thinking,” James says suddenly.</p><p>            We all look at him.</p><p>            James swallows, then says to Dad, “The speech. If that’s—still a thing you want me to do. I’ll do it.”</p><p>            After a moment, Dad smiles. Really smiles. “Really?”</p><p>            “Yeah. Public speaking isn’t exactly my forté, but—it would mean a lot to me. To do that for you.”</p><p>            Lily raises her eyes to the ceiling, looking annoyed. Dad just looks happy. “I appreciate that, James. I can pass that on.” James nods, and goes back to his food. Dad watches him, affectionate.</p><p>            I look around the table. No one else looks confused. If anyone ever wonders why I squirrel knowledge away, maybe it has something to do with being perpetually out of the loop in this household.</p><p>            I’m tempted to not ask. Maybe it’s nothing, none of my business at all. But I hear plenty about how I don’t engage at family dinners. I should ask. It might be perfectly harmless.</p><p>            “Speech for what?” I pipe up.</p><p>            Oh no. Not again.</p><p>            Everyone sort of freezes a moment. Lily and James both look at me, but what makes my stomach sink is the way Mum and Dad look at one another. They’re having a silent conversation, only it’s happened so many times before that I can recite it from heart.</p><p>            Mum: <em>You said you were going to tell him</em>.</p><p>            Dad: <em>I forgot/hadn’t gotten to it yet/didn’t feel like it/just don’t like our middle child as much as the other two.</em></p><p><em>            </em>Mum: <em>Unbelievable, I cannot believe you did this again. You’d better tell him now, or so help me, Harry</em>.</p><p>            Dad: <em>Yes, Ginny. Sorry, Ginny</em>.</p><p>            Dad takes a deep breath, then turns to me, without actually looking in my eyes. “I’m sorry, Al, I thought I’d mentioned it to you.” Like hell. Dad says, trying to sound as if it’s unimportant, “They want to make a bit of a fuss this year for my 50<sup>th</sup>. Have a public…celebration, I suppose. Bit embarrassing. As if Harry Potter Day isn’t embarrassing enough.”</p><p>            “They’ve asked me to give a speech,” James says. I glance at him, seeing a flicker of the old smugness in him.</p><p>            Dad cringes, then says to me, “It’s not that big of a deal.”</p><p>            “What sort of celebration?” I ask.</p><p>            “Oh, they…want to have a bit of a celebration the night before, then…the next day, they’re going to dedicate a park in London.”</p><p>            “There’ll be a statue,” Lily says.</p><p>            I look around the table. My siblings look like they both pity me and also enjoy this latest jab. Mum is watching me, unblinking, waiting for my reaction, waiting for the moment when she can apologize. Dad’s still not quite meeting my eyes.</p><p>            “A statue,” I echo, trying to sound impressed. “Who else will be speaking?”</p><p>            “Just a few people.”</p><p>            Probably everyone. The Minister, clearly. Any surviving members of the Order of the Phoenix. My aunt and uncle. My grandfather. My brother. Likely my mum. All standing up in front of everyone, talking about what a great man my father is.</p><p>            I nod, pressing my lips together.</p><p>            Mum breaks, leaning forward. “I’m sorry, sweetheart. I thought you knew—we didn’t think you’d have any interest, getting up in front of a crowd—”</p><p>            I give her a tight smile. “Too right. Well! That sounds like quite the event. You must be proud.”</p><p>            Dad frowns. “Not partic—I mean, it’s an honour, of course.”</p><p>            A silence falls over the table. Mum is shaking her head slightly, glaring at Dad. I really want this moment to just be over, so I can add it to the pile of shitty things my father has done to me over the years.</p><p>            “So Lily,” I say. “How have you been staying busy?”</p><p>            I have no interest in my sister’s lies, but I also know that Lily will never miss an opportunity to talk about herself. She hesitates, wanting to see me degraded some more, but I know her too well. “I’ve been designing a lot,” Lily says, straightening up. She’s directing her answer at Mum and Dad, however. “I’ve had some new ideas for some very lovely robes.”</p><p>            “That’s wonderful, Lily,” Mum says.</p><p>            I feel Dad looking at me. I meet his gaze. I see the same things there I always do. Helplessness and regret. Like he sees me and doesn’t have any idea who I am or how I got this way.</p><p>            I look away.</p><p> </p><p>“Classic.”</p><p>            I don’t give Lily the satisfaction of looking at her as I leave the loo. “You and our parents have an installment plan to pay back all the money you’ve stolen from them?”</p><p>            That shuts her up. I find Lily grating at the best of times, but this last year—she crossed a few too many lines. Maybe Mum and Dad want to give it all another go; I do not.</p><p>            Mum meets me at the door to the dining room. “Listen, Al—”</p><p>            I shrug, leaning forward to kiss her cheek. “Dinner was lovely, Mum. Give my compliments to whoever made it.”</p><p>            She pulls a face. “What gave it away?”</p><p>            “Mum. You can’t boil cabbage. I know you didn’t make me tofu.”</p><p>            When I try to pull away, Mum catches my sleeve. I can see that she wants to apologize. But she also knows that a person can only apologize for the same mistakes so many times over the years before it’s only empty words. Mum smiles, guilty, and says, “Get home safe. Have some fun this weekend, will you? Don’t just stay home reading.”</p><p>            I love my mother, but she doesn’t know much about me. “I’ll do my best. Bye, Mum.”</p><p>            She lets me go, and I walk down the hall.</p><p>            Oh, for fuck’s sake. Dad is lurking by the front door, patting his hands together. This is why I only submit to one of these dinners every other month. The script for these things are written in stone, and my patience isn’t infinite.</p><p>            I ignore him, going to my shoes. Dad hesitates, then says, “Listen, Al—”</p><p>            “It’s fine,” I reply, crouching to tie my laces.</p><p>            “I kept meaning to tell you—I’ve just been busy—”</p><p>            “It’s fine, Dad.”</p><p>            “No—I should have said something sooner. I’m sorry.”</p><p>            “Okay.”</p><p>            I stand up, reaching for the door handle. Except Dad takes my shoulder, turning me to look at him. I don’t see myself in my father, the way I imagine some sons must. Dad’s skin is a deeper brown than mine, his nose not nearly as beaky, his beard full and distinguished looking. The only thing we ever had in common was our eyes, and I changed the colour to brown when I was eighteen and never bothered changing them back.</p><p>            “If you’re upset, I’d rather you just say it. I’d rather you tell me what you’re thinking, so I can apologize or make it right.”</p><p>            Touching. “The only thing I’d appreciate you apologizing for is lying.”</p><p>            Dad drops his hand with a grimace. “I wasn’t lying—”</p><p>            “You didn’t forget to tell me. You thought that if you just waited long enough, the information would make its way back to me and I’d get the hint. It’s very, very English of you.”</p><p>            “I knew you wouldn’t want to be involved—”</p><p>            “No, <em>you</em> don’t want me to be involved. This has nothing to do with anything I want, it’s about you, just like everything is. You don’t want me to get up and give a speech about you, because unlike everyone else, I would actually say what I really thought of you. I’d say you were a great man. I’d also say that great men are overrated.”</p><p>            Dad takes a breath, trying not to get frustrated. “I never claimed to be a great man.”</p><p>            “No, you just love it when everyone else says it.”</p><p>            “I’m not—Al, I’m trying to apologize. Would you please just let me apologize?”</p><p>            Snorting, I say, “Dad, that’s the problem with apologies. You think that just because you say you’re sorry, that clears the field until the next time you do the exact same thing. And you’ll apologize then too, and feel good about yourself until you do it again. We’ve been playing this game far too long, and frankly, it bores me. It’s beneath me.”</p><p>            I reach for the door again, and Dad says, “I want you there, Al—it would be important to me if you were there—”</p><p>            I’m losing my patience. “I haven’t wanted to be called Al since I was eleven years old. You’re the one who gave me this fucking albatross of a name; the least you can do is use it.”</p><p>            I open the door and walk out it before I get more irritated. If I get upset, I get mean, and then everyone blames me. Well, I’m sick of it. I’m so sick of being the bloody black sheep all the time.</p><p>            James is leaning against the fence at the front of the yard. He’s smoking a cigarette, and it looks unnatural in his hand, though he’s smoked on and off for years. I grit my teeth, walking down the lane. I just have to get to the end, past the barrier, then I can apparate.</p><p>            When I get closer, James doesn’t say anything. He waits until I’ve passed him before speaking. “Can’t you give him a break?”</p><p>            Lolling my head back, I turn around. “Were you at the same meal I was? Did you hear the same conversation?”</p><p>            “He knew you wouldn’t want to be part of it, that you’d just take the piss. Can you blame him?”</p><p>            “Yeah, you’re right, James. Dad’s perfect. He’s never made a mistake in his life.”</p><p>            I keep walking, and James says, “You know, at some point, you’ll have to stop pretending like your childhood was that fucking terrible. You’ll have to actually take responsibility for yourself, instead of blaming it all on him.”</p><p>            I start to laugh, the air a little sweeter once I pass the anti-apparition spell. “It must be terrifying, isn’t it.”</p><p>            “What are you on about?”</p><p>            “That little voice in the back of your head. The one that told you to do everything he ever said. The voice that told you that you could live up to the expectations of the great Harry Potter. I bet, for the first time in your life, that voice is gone. And you realize what I’ve known for thirteen years: there was never any pleasing him.”</p><p>            James scowls, getting to his feet. “He’s a good dad, a great dad, you’re just—”</p><p>            I raise my middle finger with a smirk and disapparate.</p><p> </p><p>I come out behind some brush in my backyard. I yawn. It’s been a long day, and even though it’s only just gotten dark, I don’t think I can go out again.</p><p>            That’s fine. My little brick house sits before me, welcoming, mine, my favourite place.</p><p>            Bedford was a calculated choice on my part. When I turned seventeen, I came into a little bit of money. Not a great deal. My parents had divided the last of my grandparents’ savings into three, for each of us when we came of age. James bought a motorcycle, which pleased Dad to no end. Lily’s disappeared into drugs in a few weeks.</p><p>            Meanwhile, I went to Mr. Malfoy and had him put it in a sensible savings account.</p><p>            I spent the next few years putting my money away, building towards a down payment on a house as I lived in cheap flats. I ended up on a brief contract collating data for the Ministry’s demographics section, and I was able to combine that with Scorpius’ knowledge of English housing. I settled on Bedford because it was a sizeable city, relatively close to London, the housing market wasn’t outrageous, the homes were beautiful, and in 1689 a mob of Muggles managed to kill three witch sisters, an anomaly in the Muggle witch hunts (most magic folk would just disapparate off the stake). Three hundred years later, witches and wizards are too superstitious to live in Bedford.</p><p>            Which is to say, I am officially the only wizard to live in a city of nearly 175,000 people.</p><p>            I walk across the lawn, not worrying about neighbours. There are walls high enough to block the outside world from my property, and big hedges out front that protect the house from onlookers. The house is at the end of a lane, a small tangle of forest on the other side. The only other people in the neighbourhood are families and the elderly. No one has much interest in a solitary man who only ever walks down the street to buy a fizzy drink from the store.</p><p>            I put my hand to the wood frame around the door. It’s spelled to open for me, and no one else. This is my sanctuary. The door opens, the lights automatically turning on inside.</p><p>            Zamora is waiting for me, flat face upturned. She lets out a reproachful, relieved mew.</p><p>            I crouch down, picking her up into my arms. Burying my face against her thick, fluffy grey fur, I murmur, “I missed you too, my beautiful, perfect girl.” She yowls, butting her head up under my chin. I push the door closed with my foot, petting Zamora’s back as she burrows against me. “Yes, I missed you. It was the longest day without my perfect girl.”</p><p>            I kick off my shoes, and walk through the kitchen, Zamora purring like a small motor in my arms. Being between these walls, I feel more myself. I don’t feel so defensive. This is my dominion.</p><p>            Zamora is wiggling, trying to get closer to me. She is the most perfect cat in the world, but not very cat-like in that she is quite needy and requires many cuddles. I don’t even pretend to be put out. I love it. She was the best birthday present I ever received.</p><p>            I walk into the living room. I leave it every day the way I want it to be when I come home. My favourite blanket is pulled back on the sofa. I have three books to choose from on the table. The lamps are lit, and the room smells like sandalwood.</p><p>            Zamora puts her face up against mine and wails. Petting her, I say, “Oh, I know. I know, my girl. Just let me change my clothes and I’ll feed you. How about some nice fish? I have a tin of that hidden away for special occasions. I know you’d like that.”</p><p>            She snorts, which I take as an affirmation.</p><p>            I walk through the living room, to the hallway at the front of the house. I’m going to put on pajamas, even though it’s not even eight o’clock. Zamora and I will curl up together on the sofa, and I’ll read with her soft, warm weight on me. Tomorrow I’ll sleep late, and I’ll go out, and I will have a very good weekend.</p><p>            There’s a knock at the door.</p><p>            I turn, staring dead eyed down the hall. I don’t know who would show up at my house on a Friday night. Oh no—my father. He’s got it in his head that he wants to keep fighting things out. Typical Gryffindor stubbornness.</p><p>            Well, I don’t feel like it. This is my house, and I get to say who does and doesn’t come in. Of course, the lights are on, so I’m obviously home.</p><p>            I’ll tell him to fuck off, then get back to my night in. I think I’ll listen to the Joni Mitchell vinyl I found the other day. Taking a breath through my nose, I walk to the door, and open it, holding Zamora with one hand.</p><p>            Scorpius stands on the other side. He has a bottle of something clenched in his right hand. He’s changed, into that jumper Rose gave him for Christmas, the red one that’s too harsh for his colouring. Scorpius looks dazed and lost.</p><p>            “She broke up with me.”</p><p>            I stare at him.   </p><p>            And, a rarity for me, I cannot think of a single thing to say.</p>
