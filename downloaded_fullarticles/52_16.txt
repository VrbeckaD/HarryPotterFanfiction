    <p>St. Anne’s Orphanage was a bustling hub of noise and general commotion in the mornings. Kids of all ages were waking up and making breakfast, checking the cork-board for their days chores and laughing with their friends. Taako still lay in bed, his blanket drawn up over his head and pillow thrown haphazardly onto the floor. His sleep the evening before had been restless as always, though luckily he hadn’t been woken up by a nightmare this time. </p><p>“Ko Koooooo!” He heard a voice call. Taako groaned and pulled the blanket up over his head, trying his best to ignore the voice of his sister as she tried to rouse him from his sleep. “You gotta get up!” There was a pause then as neither of the twins said anything, and then, without warning, the blanket was ripped off of Taako’s tired figure with a flourish.</p><p>“Lup!” Taako yelled, sitting upright now and glaring at his twin as she stuck her tongue out at him. </p><p>“C’mon, sleepyhead,” Lup teased, pulling Taako out of bed and throwing a bundle of clothes at him. “Get changed and then we can go down to breakfast,” she told him, stepping out of the room as Taako threw on the clothes she tossed him. A pair of black ripped jeans, a plain pink tee-shirt, and a grey hoodie. </p><p>After getting changed, Taako stepped out of the room to join Lup as they headed down to breakfast. Arriving in the kitchen, Taako opened the fridge and pulled out four eggs while Lup pulled out a frying pan, started the stove and began to heat the pan up. She moved over to the fridge to pull out some cheese and deli ham while Taako went ahead and started whisking the eggs to scramble. Working in sync, their scrambled-eggs-for-two were done in nearly no time and tasted wonderfully.</p><p>They ate in relative silence, listening to the bustle of their house mates going about their days. Taako couldn’t even begin to explain how much he hated the people here. There was so little respect for him and even less for his sister. The only people who seemed to tolerate the two of them were Anne, the headmistress of the orphanage, and Killian, a girl just a year older than the twins. </p><p>Killian was a larger girl, easily taller than both Taako and Lup, rowdy, and she started at some strange boarding school last year that Taako had never heard of before. Some place called Pig-Farts or something. Killian had returned from school seeming very happy with how things were there, but whenever Taako or Lup tried to ask her about it she’d never give them a concrete answer, always avoiding or dodging the question in some way. Taako had sneaked a look in her trunk but only found textbooks on charms? Transfiguration? He had no idea what any of that was so he shrugged and closed the trunk telling Lup that there was only a bunch of “nerd books” inside. Though he was still incredibly curious. </p><p>“Lup, Taako,” a voice called as the two were washing their dishes, both turned to face the voice and saw, standing in the doorway, Killian smiling by her side and three letters in her hands, headmistress Anne Crowley. “If you two will come with me and Killian please, there’s something we need to discuss with you.”</p><p>Taako shot a wary look at Lup as they put their clean dishes away and followed closely behind Anne and Killian. Lup’s hand found Taako’s as they walked and he squeezed it back tightly, unsure what this discussion would hold but fearing the worst nonetheless. </p><p>Anne’s office was cluttered and bright. The walls were a simple bright grey and littered with calendars and posters and photos of all sorts. There were two windows, each letting in a large bit of light and with disturbingly orange curtains which were drawn open. Anne gestured first the three kids to take a seat in the uncomfortable chairs in front of her desk as she sat in her own spinning desk chair with a rather pleased expression on her face. </p><p>“Your letters from school came in today,” she said, wasting no time in getting to the point as normal. Killian smiled wider at this news while Taako and Lup exchanged confused looks with each other. Faerün Public Middle didn’t send out letters. Anne handed each kid in front of her a letter sealed with an elegant wax seal and addressed in lovely emerald green ink. Killian opened hers immediately, beginning to pour over the contents with earnest.</p><p>“School?” Taako asked, examining the letter but not yet opening it. Lup was staring at hers in awe. </p><p>“Yes,” Anne supplied, addressing the twins now, “Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It’s a school of magic up in Scotland where tons of young witches and wizards go to get their education. Killian started there last year and I myself am a graduate.” </p><p>“Wait, what? Magic? You’re kidding right?” Taako continued on, not believing a word Anne was saying for a second. Magic was something out of fairytales, it wasn’t real this was obviously some ploy to kick him and his sister out for something they’d done and Taako was sure of it. </p><p>“She’s not kidding, Ko,” Killian reinforced, I went there last year and you should see the castle! It’s huge! And all the professors are wicked fun and eccentric. Especially the herbology Professor, Merle Highchurch. He’s also my Head of House!” Taako blinked at her in disbelief. Lup was still staring at her letter. “They dont believe us, Ms. Crowley,”</p><p>Anne just smiled and Taako watched as she pulled a long stick from somewhere in her desk. He looked at it dubiously but found himself gaping as Anne pointed it at a piece of paper on her desk and swished it, causing the paper to rise steadily into the air. He elbowed Lup in the ribs and she finally looked up exclaiming “bloody hell!” as she too noticed the very apparent use of magic before their eyes. </p><p>“Killian can tell you all you need to know about the school and the teachers, should you have any other questions just come to me. We’ll get your supplies later in the week,” Anne said, ushering the three out of her office. “Oh and one more thing,” Taako and Lup turned again to face her, “you must not tell any of the other kids about this. It is of vital importance that they remain none the wiser about your magic.”</p>
