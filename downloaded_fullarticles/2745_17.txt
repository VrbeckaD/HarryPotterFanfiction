    <p>Sirius had hardly been surprised when he woke up with his right cheek stuck with tears to the dining room floor. Waking up this way had happened more times than it probably should have in Sirius’ fifteen years on this wretched planet and it no longer startled him the way it once did when he was a child.</p>
<p>
The minute Sirius came to, he had pulled himself to his feet with nothing more than a slight groan and dragged himself to his room. With a hard-set determination, Sirius pulled his trunk out from under his bed and started to pack his things. The evening had started out relatively normal. Dinner had been served and there was little to no speaking. Unless Sirius felt like arguing with his parents or his parents said something that Sirius found hard to ignore, dinner could almost be considered a pleasant affair. Everyone ate their food, finished off dessert, and went to bed without a word. </p>
<p>
Sirius enjoyed those nights. While he wished he could chat with his parents and his younger brother, Regulus, as he imagined other families did during dinner, when dinner passed by without a screaming match with his mother or without Sirius becoming terribly injured, it was marked off as a good evening in his books. Unfortunately for Sirius, once the dinner plates had been cleared and dessert was in the process of being set, Sirius’ father pulled out an envelope from his coat pocket and placed it in front of Regulus. </p>
<p>
“This came for you today,” He said as Regulus stared down at the envelope. Sirius could make out the familiar handwriting on the front and it didn’t surprise him that the letter came from Hogwarts. The slight bulge coming from inside the envelope didn’t shock him either. He was sure he knew what it was. School was going to be starting up soon and there was no doubt in his mind that the envelope contained a prefect badge. His perfect little brother- a prefect. Sirius would never hear the end of it.</p>
<p>
Soon enough, Sirius’ assumptions were proven correct as Regulus held his breath and opened the envelope with a careful, practiced hand. His face was covered in apprehension and Sirius didn’t understand why. It’s not like they all didn’t know this was going to happen. Regulus did everything perfectly. At home, at school- he was the poster child for the perfect boy. He was the son every parent wanted and a pupil all teachers admired, even those not from his own house. </p>
<p>
Sirius would be lying if he said he wasn’t slightly jealous of the way people looked at his brother. When people looked at Sirius, they swooned and they gawked. He knew he was handsome. There was no doubt in his mind. He’s observed other boys and noticed their differences. He’s even compared himself to his friends and listened to the girls in the hallways just to hear what they thought his attractive features were. His smile, his hair, and oh did the girls love his eyes. Gray and mysterious. It wasn’t a common eye color after all and the girls just loved it. </p>
<p>
His brother on the other hand, didn’t get as much attention as Sirius did on his looks. While Sirius didn’t necessarily think his brother was ugly, Sirius knew that girls thought Sirius was more physically attractive than his brother- they all said so. It was one thing Sirius was more accomplished in than his perfect little brother. And as shallow is it may have seemed to do so, Sirius relished in it. </p>
<p>
The two also had quite different personalities. Sirius had spent his whole life trying to find that balance of pushing back against his parents and their hard-headed pure-blooded beliefs and shying away from getting too much negative attention. Regulus on the other hand followed every single rule their parents set for them to a T. He was well mannered and followed the old fashioned rule of “children are meant to be seen not heard” much better than Sirius ever could. Sirius could hardly stand it. </p>
<p>
Once he got to school, Sirius felt free from all the troubles and pressure he felt at home. Even though he was initially terrified at having been sorted into Gryffindor, it had felt like a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders. His sorting seemed to further prove to him that he was not like his family- something he had known all his life. But having it proven by the Sorting Hat made him feel like maybe there wasn’t something wrong with him like he had always thought. There was an entire table filled with people who were just like him and James ended up being one of those people. He was able to breathe for once and not worry about what his parents would do to him, at least until he went home for holiday. </p>
<p>
This caused Sirius to push the boundaries of, well, everything. At school, he behaved in ways he would never dare at home and his friendship with James only seemed to encourage this behavior. His devil may care attitude and his mischievous ways only seemed to enhance the attention he received from his dashingly good looks. The ladies loved him. And Sirius did love the positive attention. </p>
<p>
Regulus, however, was admired more for his brains and Sirius was ridiculously envious of that. His brother was expected to be smart. He didn’t mess around or goof off like Sirius did with his friends. Unlike Sirius, he knew his brother more respected by their professors and they expected more out of Regulus than they did Sirius. </p>
<p>
Sirius would never forget the day Professor Slughorn told him that he wished he would behave more like his brother. Sirius had quickly become hurt, having heard that his entire life from his parents. Hearing that same old tune at school quickly caused Sirius to lash out and insult the poor professor. Sirius had not only gained a months’ worth of detention for his words, but 50 points had been taken from Gryffindor, and he also had a terribly long and painful talk with Professor McGonagall. </p>
<p>
So when Regulus pulled out the prefect badge and a letter stating everything he needed to know for his future endeavors as a prefect, a familiar sense of dread filled Sirius’ stomach the way it always did when Regulus accomplished something that Sirius never would. </p>
<p>
“Dear, boy,” Sirius’ father said, “Your mother and I are incredibly proud of you. Well done, son.” Regulus received a clap on his shoulder, something Sirius never got from his father, and a proud look that Sirius had never once seen thrown his way. Not a second later, Kreacher had set out the dessert on the table and Sirius hadn’t waited a second before helping himself to some treats. </p>
<p>
“You know, Sirius,” His mother started coolly before Sirius had even taken two bites of his cake. Sirius knew that soon enough they would be at each other’s throats screaming at one another. Based off what Sirius heard from other kids at his school, and his experience with James’ mom, a mother was not meant to provoke their son into fighting with them. A mother, and a father for that matter, were supposed to support their children, even if they disagreed with their actions and their choices. Parents were supposed to help their children succeed in life. The only child Sirius’ witch of a mother, in both senses of the word, seemed to “mother” was Regulus. Sirius could accidently blow his head off making a potion and instead of mourning his death, his mother would probably throw a dinner party for finally being rid of the black sheep of their family. </p>
<p>
“Had you spent less time with your blood-traitor and half-blood friends causing trouble in school you could have become a prefect in your 5th year just like your brother.” The comment seemed off handed and if Sirius didn’t know his mother, the tone of her voice would have made it sound like she was merely making an observation. However, with the way she looked at him, he knew that was very much not the case. She was trying to provoke him and Sirius could see his brother tense up from the corner of his eye. He knew what was coming too. </p>
<p>
“Yes, Sirius,” His father chimed in. “As much of a failure as you are, a prefect from the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, would have been much more preferable for that muggle loving house of yours rather than that half-blooded prefect who you insist on being friends with.” Unfortunately, that was as much of a complement as Sirius could ever hope to get from his father. He might have said that Sirius would have been the better choice but his father had also called him a failure and was insulting one of his best friends and his house, which Sirius had a lot of pride being a part of. </p>
<p>
Sirius grit his teach and clenched his tiny dessert fork in his hand. Sirius didn’t say anything. It had taken everything in him not to jump to Remus’ defense and to defend himself as well and to tell his parents how much of a failure he wasn’t. And he would have succeeded had his mother not decided to continue the one-sided conversation. </p>
<p>
“Yes, that sickly boy,” She spat. “Whatever do you see in him? Not only is he a half-blood but he’s constantly ill. I don’t find it hard to believe you’d find it suitable to hang around such a disgusting boy, but Regulus here has told us all about your little escapades.” Escapades? Sirius quickly snapped his head over to his brother who was staring intently has his dessert. It was hardly even touched and the fork lay useless hanging off the plate. </p>
<p>
“We’ve put up with your horrendous behavior and your stupid little friends. We’ve been the laughingstock of all our peers because of you. You’ve disgraced us in many ways and we were being kind not throwing you out on the streets.” Sirius almost scoffed. Kind? They had not been kind. Sirius almost wished he had been thrown out. The streets would be a much better place to live than with these bigots. </p>
<p>
“But Sirius Orion Black, I will not tolerate having a faggot as a son.” And that was it. Sirius’ blood ran cold as his fork clattered loudly against his plate. </p>
<p>
 “I am not a faggot,” Sirius bit out. “Don’t call me that.” </p>
<p>
“Regulus said he saw you and the half-blood boy getting quite close in a corridor at school. He said it seemed like the two of you were going to kiss.” Sirius’ hands started to shake. “As I said, I have tolerated all kinds of inexcusable and unacceptable behavior from you Sirius but this is one thing I will not tolerate,” his mother said in a low voice. Then she laughed. </p>
<p>
“Not to mention that Potter boy- James, is it? He comes from such a respected pure-blooded family. So much wealth and power. It’s a shame the Potters are a lousy group of blood-traitors. Were they more like us, he’d be a much more suitable friend for you. Instead his family had to go turn their backs on the Dark Lord. Filthy blood-traitors disgracing their heritage-” </p>
<p>
“Shut up!” Sirius shouted. His chest was heaving and his ears rang. The sound of his chair scraping against the wood floor made his teeth hurt but all he could focus on was the pure anger he felt through every inch of his body. They could call Sirius a faggot all they wanted. They could say anything they wanted about him. But it was crossing a line to insult his best friend. “You know nothing about him. James Potter is the best friend anyone could ever ask for. He’s more of a brother to me than my own brother is and he has the best parents in the world. I’d much rather have been born a Potter than a Black. I hate everything this family stands for and I wish you all would just disappear.” </p>
<p>
Sirius’ breath was ragged but his rage slowly started to fade as he looked around the table and read the faces of his family. Regulus looked mildly sad and his father looked alarmed. But his mother, oh his mother, looked downright furious. Slowly his mother stood up from her chair and started to make her way towards Sirius. With each step she took towards him, he chest tightened more and more with fear. With each step she took, Sirius backed up bit by bit until he had no choice but to fall back into his chair. With each step, her wand got closer and closer to touching him. And when she was looming right over him at the foot of his chair, Sirius found that he couldn’t breathe. </p>
<p>
His mother had her wand on his chest and she started at him with a cold hard anger that he was all too familiar with. He tried to open his mouth and plead with her, to beg forgiveness, to say he didn’t mean what he had said. But he couldn’t make his mouth move. </p>
<p>
He couldn’t move a muscle as he waited for her to utter the word. The word that caused him to have scars across his body. The word that haunted his dreams and caused him to wake with his body throbbing in pain and his mind clouded with fear. </p>
<p>
Sirius could barely see her mouth move as she muttered, “Crucio.” And suddenly his entire body was engulfed in pain. Sirius hardly remembered anything that happened after that. </p>
<p>
 If he tried hard enough, he could remember flashes of pain and he could hear his own screams echoing through his head. But he tried not focus on that as he went through his closet and ruffled through his drawers pulling out all the clothes he could manage and stuffing them into his trunk. </p>
<p>
Sirius saw everything through a haze. His eyes were full of unshed tears causing his surroundings to blur. Every movement caused him to wince in pain. Even in the places where the curse hadn’t broken skin, he still ached. If Sirius was in a right state of mind, he would have flooed himself to St. Mungos or at the very least, clean the freshly made cuts. But he was on autopilot as he stuffed his robes in his trunk and clasped it shut. He hardly processed that he had put on his boots and climbed downstairs before he was walking towards the front door. He was moving so fast, too fast, to notice Regulus sitting on the sofa near the front door reading. He wouldn’t have noticed if Regulus hadn’t said anything. </p>
<p>
“Sirius?” Regulus sounded shocked. “Where do you think your going?” Sirius tried to imagine what this might look like to his brother. Sirius was tired and in pain and it likely showed. He likely had blood seeping through his clothes and he was sure to look a mess with his long hair getting tangled all around his head and the redness of his eyes from the tears the refused to fall. Not to mention he had his trunk clutched tightly in his right hand. </p>
<p>
Sirius surprised himself by his answer. From the second he got up, his mind hardly processed anything. He knew he was packing his things and he knew he was hurting- physically, mentally, and emotionally. He knew that he needed to get out of the house. But he didn’t think too much past that. Once the words, “I’m running away,” passed his lips, Sirius almost dropped his trunk in shock. He was running away. He was finally doing it. </p>
<p>
In the back of his mind, Sirius supposed he knew that was what he was doing all along. But to actually say it aloud and to his brother, nonetheless, made Sirius stop in his mindless pursuit to leave. Regulus, while seeming saddened by his words, didn’t seem surprised. </p>
<p>
“I’m not going to ask you why. I know you don’t like it here. I know you hate our family,” Regulus said softly. He sat up straight holding his place in the book with his finger. </p>
<p>
He looked like he wanted to say more, but Sirius cut him off. “Come with me,” Sirius said. He wasn’t sure what caused him to say it. Maybe it was the fact that he had no idea what he was doing and he didn’t want to be alone. Or maybe it was because he was scared and even though he and his brother hadn’t gotten along in years, having him by his side would be comforting. Or maybe he just didn’t want to leave his baby brother alone to the mercy of their parents despite Regulus’ admiration and obsession with the Dark Lord. Sirius just didn’t want his brother to get hurt. And maybe, just maybe, if he could convince Regulus to leave with him, he can talk him out of all this nonsense and he could have his baby brother back. </p>
<p>
“Please, Reg, come with me,” Sirius pleaded. It was suddenly important that Regulus go with him and never look back. Regulus looked startled. It was probably cause it had been years since Sirius called him “Reg”. It was a childhood nickname that Sirius stopped using once Regulus got sorted into Slytherin and showed their parents his interest in all their pure-blood radicalism. It had hurt Regulus’ feelings the first time Sirius called him by his full name and now it seemed to shock Regulus quite terribly to hear the old nickname after all these years. </p>
<p>
“Sirius,” Regulus whispered. “I can’t.” It almost looked like it pained him to say that. </p>
<p>
“Why not?” Sirius asked a bit harshly. He knew the answer. He wanted to hear Regulus say it. He wanted to hear the words come out of his mouth and prove to Sirius that the teenager sitting in front of him was not who Sirius wanted him to be so that Sirius could walk out the front door and not feel an ounce of guilt for leaving Regulus behind. But before Sirius could do that, he needed Regulus to say it. </p>
<p>
“You know why, Sirius.” </p>
<p>
“Tell me,” Sirius grit. </p>
<p>
Regulus took a deep breath. “Because I’m to be marked next year. I’m meant to serve the Dark Lord and I can’t abandon our parents for my blood-traitor brother.” What had started out as a confident reply had quickly dwindled till it was only slightly above a whisper. Sirius had to strain to hear the last words, but he understood perfectly clear what Regulus had said. Sirius wanted to cry. There was no hope for Regulus. It was too late. </p>
<p>
With his resolve reinforced, Sirius strengthened his hold on his trunk and straightened up. “Very well. Goodbye, Regulus,” Sirius said curtly and took the final steps to the front door. As he gripped the handle, Sirius almost turned to take one final look at his brother. He quickly decided against it, knowing how fast he could abandon his plans by one look from his brother. For Sirius, despite their differences and their growing apart over the years, still cared deeply for Regulus and was the only reason Sirius had not resolved to do this sooner. With a deep breath, Sirius yanked the door open and stepped outside. </p>
<p>
As the door fell shut behind him, Sirius could barely make out the broken, “Goodbye, Sirius,” Regulus sent his way. Whether Regulus meant for Sirius to hear it or not, Sirius did indeed hear it and it shook him to his core. It caused Sirius to stop in his tracks and bite back a sob. He had to do it, he had to leave. He learned on his first night at Hogwarts in a mortifying and terrifying conversation with James, Remus, and Peter that the way his parents treated him were not the way parents were supposed to treat their children. Sirius had thought it was normal for parents to punish their children for spilling their milk by the Cruciatus Curse. As Sirius learned that first night at Hogwarts, most kids did not. </p>
<p>
Sirius couldn’t live another second in Number 12 Grimmauld Place but he knew Regulus would be just fine. </p>
<p>
It was then that Sirius decided where he was going to go. He was going to the one place other than Hogwarts that he ever felt welcome. The one place other than Hogwarts that he felt wanted and cared for. It was probably the only place where he felt like he was loved unconditionally. Sirius stumbled his way in the dark of the night to the nearest curb. </p>
<p>
Sirius took a deep breath, stuck out his wand arm, and waited a second. Suddenly a purple triple decker bus appeared in front of him. His parents had never let him take the Knight Bus before since it was based off a muggle contraption. He had always been fascinated by it and had heard plenty of stories from his fellow classmates about their trips on the Knight Bus. There were other ways to get to where he wanted to go, but Sirius figured this would be the way to go if he wanted to piss of his parents, even if they never found out about it. And boy did he want to make them fume. </p>
<p>
“Well don’t just stand there,” Sirius snapped out of his thoughts to see the conductor standing at the top of the steps looking down at him. “Get on.” The conductor turned around and took his seat behind the wheel. Sirius slowly stepped onto the bus. “Where you off to then?” Sirius looked at the conductor and looked him over. He was scraggly and not very well put together. He was lounged in his seat with a look on his face that told Sirius that he didn’t really care much for his job. </p>
<p>
Sirius instantly worried if he’d made the right decision stepping on the bus. “Uh, Potter Mansion,” Sirius said, slightly unsure. </p>
<p>
“Potter Mansion?” The conductor questioned. “That’s an odd place to take the bus to.” </p>
<p>
“Can’t you get me there?” Sirius asked, wondering if he’d have to get off and find somewhere he can floo from. </p>
<p>
The conductor scoffed. “Of course I can. What sort of question is that? Now grab a bed, it’s gonna be a while, we’ve got more stops to make.” Sirius hesitantly made his way to the back of the bus. There were beds lined up all through the bus and there was a classic expansion spell set on it. It was definitely bigger on the inside. Every passenger on the bus was sleeping therefore there was no one but the driver to pay any mind to Sirius. He had been worried he’d be recognized. Still, Sirius took the bed right next to the back window. He didn’t want to take any risks of being seen. Setting his stuff down on the bed, Sirius barely had time to sit down and think about how nice it would be to have rest before arriving at James’ before the bus took off and he was thrown flat on his back from the force. </p>
<p>
What an odd way to start the end of the summer holiday, Sirius thought, as he lied down properly and made himself comfortable. What an odd way indeed.</p>
