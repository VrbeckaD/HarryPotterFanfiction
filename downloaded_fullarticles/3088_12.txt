    <p>The temperature in Port Angeles was a significant alteration in comparison to the heat of Phoenix. Marcus missed that much about it already, had for the time he’d been at his dad’s place before school started. As he’d discovered, what constituted cold in Arizona didn’t compare to the chill that swept Washington. Winter in Port Angeles seemed to mean grey skies and constant icy sleet, people preparing themselves against the worse weather probably still to come.</p><p>One of Alex Flint’s first typically practical remarks on his arrival had been, “I got you a truck so you can get to and from school, but you might want to get some snow chains on your tyres soon.” The surprise had obviously shown in his expression, because his father had flashed an amused smile. “You didn’t think I was going to have you move out here and not have a way to get about, right?“ It was a reminder that Marcus hadn’t needed; compared to Phoenix, Port Angeles wasn’t quite the middle of nowhere, but it wasn’t far off. Despite that, he’d been touched by the fact his dad had even thought of it. It hadn’t been a short drive from Seattle-Tacoma airport to Port Angeles; by the time they got home, Marcus had been exhausted and ready to crash in the nearest available spot. He’d called with his mom the next morning, texted her to let her know that he landed fine, and tried not to let the pang hit him of how much he missed her. <em>You left for a reason. You did the right thing</em>. His mother was a free spirit, always apt to wander, and he wasn’t about to be the reason that she felt chained in place. A week later and ready or not, school was starting up, and Marcus had transferred to Port Angeles’ local high school. <em>Joy</em>. To say that he wasn’t looking forward to it understated the matter. It had nothing to do with the school itself, and everything to do with being the new person in amongst a group of people who had grown up together. He’d been through it before when his mother decided to move them to yet another new place, and he didn’t relish having to do it again, even if he’d made the choice himself this time.</p><p>It meant that when Marcus finally got finished in the office and had received a brief, cursory tour, he moved towards his first class with utter reluctance, since he’d missed registration that morning due to his meeting to select classes. His transcripts had arrived from his old school, and he had a text from Adrian telling him <em>good luck, not that you need it</em> that made him smile a little before he took a deep breath and went in. He wasn’t late, but it felt like literally everyone else was there before him, because almost everyone’s heads turned to stare at him, including the teacher. <em>Why is everyone staring? Is it the tan or just my face? </em>It felt like he was some kind of new and exotic zoo animal, because people seemed to watch his every move. He was thankful that first class was English in light of that rather than something that would immediately require group work, and doubly grateful that he got sat next to a girl called Susan, whose kind demeanour set him immediately at ease.</p><p>At the desk in front of them, there was a quick-tongued and incredibly friendly boy called Terence, who took about five seconds to introduce himself and ask the first of what would be many questions that day. “So, you’re Chief Flint’s son, right?”</p><p>That had made Marcus immediately a little self-conscious. <em>Did everyone know I was coming or something?</em> He guessed that was what came with the territory when his father was the police chief in a small town like this. Everyone knew everyone. “Yeah, that’s me.”</p><p>Terence grinned at him, leaned back in his chair and turned his head, seemingly to be able to look at him better. “No idea why you’d come here when you lived somewhere like Arizona. What’s it like there? Must be hotter than here, with that tan you’ve got there.” Right after that, it felt as though he was being looked at even more closely, and that made him flush and shift in his seat. He didn’t do well with that. “Yeah, I mean, it’s a lot different.” Thankfully, Susan chose to intervene at that point and swatted Terence’s arm. “He’s been here all of five minutes, Terence. Try not to question him to death.” Her voice was dry, and it made Marcus grin a little, set back at his ease. When Terence eventually turned back around with a wink in his direction that left him wondering what was going on, she smiled at him. “Fair warning, the rumour mill is way ahead of you. You’re going to get this for at least the next week, so be prepared.”</p><p>As it turned out, that was an understatement, and it was Susan along with Terence that made the first couple of classes bearable, because people <em>stared,</em> and he didn’t know what to do with it. He got that a new person from out of town was maybe a bigger deal here in Port Angeles, but it left him nonplussed. <em>Surely they’ve had transfer students before?</em> Following on from that, lunch was overwhelming and noisy, a deluge of Terence and Susan’s friends surrounding him at the table with question after question about Phoenix and himself. He wasn’t used to it, didn’t know how to answer half of what he was being asked. Friendly though he was capable of being, he couldn’t check the gratitude when the conversation shifted instead to what everyone had been up to the previous weekend. Rather than talk, he could listen and get a feel for what life in Port Angeles might actually entail outside of school. Apparently, it was a whole lot of hiking even when the temperatures threatened to drop below freezing, which made sense given the nearby mountain ranges, and fishing, which he’d known from his father’s persistent love of it. It transpired that Terence’s parents owned the local hiking and camping supply store, a place that Marcus had passed once or twice since his arrival but never been in. He already had hiking boots from Phoenix, used to rich, rolling stretches of desert and late nights camping with his friends in warm temperatures. He had the feeling that meant something different here in Port Angeles. As it turned out though, the group he was with had all been down to the beach after walking by the creek, something they promised to show him before he’d even thought to ask.</p><p>After lunch, he had history, which both Terence and Susan took at a different time, and that meant heading there alone. What he hadn’t realised was it was at the opposite end of the building he was in, so remembering how to get there proved to take longer than he’d hoped.</p><p>The teacher seemed surprised to see Marcus at first as he stood uncertainly in the classroom doorway, and a few people’s heads turned in his direction. “Sorry if I’m late, but I’m new,” he said politely. <em>And this is incredibly awkward, predictably.</em> The teacher’s expression cleared after that, clearly putting together his appearance with previous information somewhat belatedly. “Ah, yes. You must be Marcus, welcome.” What had been a few people looking his way suddenly turned into almost everyone whispering and looking around at him with disconcerting interest. “Please come in, take a seat.”</p><p>Marcus scanned around for an empty seat. There wasn’t one at first glance. <em>Great</em>. Except then his eyes landed on the only empty seat in the entire room, next to an incredibly striking boy with pale blond hair, and he was directed there by the teacher, whose name he learned was Professor Binns. He sat down, directed a small smile at him before settling in and hunching his shoulders forward a little. It was almost a relief when class began, because at least then he could focus on the events of the French Revolution, taking notes (out of habit more than need) and very much try not to dwell on the fact he thought the boy next to him was striking. <em>Not what you need to be thinking about.</em> Despite that, he couldn’t help stealing glances every so often, and each one only seemed to give him a new detail that affirmed his first reaction. Although the hair had been the first thing he noticed, he caught briefly the colour of the boy’s eyes and a flash of high cheekbones, enough to make him curious and want another look.</p><p>Eventually, the teacher told them to discuss briefly the fall of the Bastille, which Marcus had already covered in his program in Phoenix a while ago and considered relatively basic. Despite that, he turned a little to the boy beside him after a moment’s hesitation. “Hi, I’m Marcus,” he introduced himself, a shy note to the words despite the straightforward address. “Sorry if I took up someone’s usual seat and they’re not here.” Because he honestly couldn’t imagine anyone not taking the invite to sit here, if they were asked.</p><p>It was a few lingering seconds before Marcus got any sort of reply, because during that time the pale-haired boy was looking at him as though he’d suddenly developed a painful headache. Before he could ask what was wrong, the expression was gone as quickly as it had arrived, leaving Marcus to conclude that his first observation of the other had been correct. <em>Devastatingly handsome</em> barely covered it now that he had the full view. <em>Don’t get your hopes up</em>. It turned out that was a good call a moment later when the boy spoke. “Hi,” he said, seeming to pause before he said it, as though he wasn’t sure whether to respond or not. That was odd, until the explanation that followed. “I always sit alone, unless I have a class with one of my siblings.”</p><p>Suddenly, it became quite clear that Marcus had invaded a space that was deliberately kept that way. “Oh. I get that. It’s easier to concentrate that way, or at least, it is for me.” It was a way to shift away from the fact that the boy obviously hadn’t wanted company of any kind. Even if he got the message, a disappointing one but nonetheless loud and clear, he didn’t have anyone else to ask his questions of. <em>Tough.</em> He cleared his throat a little. “Is today a recap, or is this the first time of covering this in class? I didn’t really get a chance to ask when I arrived.” That was an understatement, since the professor hadn’t seemed overly concerned with telling him what had already been covered in case he had to catch up.</p><p>At least this time, the other boy didn’t hesitate to answer him, eyes that were the shade of a pre-storm sky, dark enough to be grey fastening on him specifically. It was a nerve-racking sensation. “This is the first time they’re covering this in class. Apparently, this is what they see as challenging material. I’m pretty sure there’s one pair already discussing the band instead of the prison. They’d do much better describing the horrors of the French Revolution instead of teaching it as a victory of democracy.” The underlying tone to the words held something like annoyance, and for a moment Marcus was at a loss to determine whether it was directed at his question or at other people’s inability to comprehend the French Revolution. The question itself wasn’t unreasonable, so it had to be people being idiots.</p><p>“I already covered this a while ago, and if you don’t find it challenging, you probably know more about it than I do.” That was met with a shrug, and for a second Marcus was under the impression that was all that he was going to get, and that this would quite definitely be the first and last time they sat together. He was resigning himself to that fact until the other boy suddenly spoke again. “Every historical event has at least four sides, I think. What we learn in school is the one most fitting in our current society. Since we value democracy so much, this version of history zooms in on it. Plus, since it did establish a first form of democracy, albeit very temporarily, historians like to forget about the blood.”</p><p>The articulate way that the other outlined his thoughts on the matter only intrigued Marcus further, something that he knew was probably a mistake. <em>He’s made it very clear he doesn’t take to company, you’re not going to be an exception. </em>Slowly, he mulled it over, relieved to not be answering questions about himself for the first time since his arrival that morning. “I think overlooking the blood is a mistake,” he said, folding his hands on the desk in front of him. “You’re obviously right concerning the democracy, but the price paid for it shouldn’t be forgotten.” The other frowned a moment later, made Marcus wonder what he'd said wrong. “It’s always forgotten,” he said. “That’s how historians change history to make sure it can be taught in high school.” After a pause, the boy seemed to catch himself, as though he’d made a mistake. “Sorry, I have three older siblings. When they talk about something, I need to get myself involved to prove I know things too. I researched it a lot.”</p><p>That made sense, and Marcus was quick to respond. “You don’t need to be sorry. This might be the most refreshing conversation I’ve had all day.” And with someone who knew their own mind and didn’t seem to feel the need to cluster in a group to validate himself. Yes, that was quite different. Even if it would probably be the first and last time they sat together. “I mean, I’m an only child, so that’s different to anything I know. You must be pretty close with your siblings, but it doesn’t sound like you have anything to prove.”</p><p>When the corners of the other boy’s lips curled upwards, just a little, Marcus couldn’t help but be a little pleased. “I like reading and I have a good memory. I suppose that does help.”</p><p>Right after that, as though to lend credit to the words the other spoke previously, he could hear two people arguing about their favourite Bastille song and whether the band had broken up. Marcus rolled his eyes heavenward without thinking and then checked himself quickly, realising what he’d done. What he saw then was unexpected: a slight but definite grin on the blond boy’s lips, indicative of amusement. What was even more unexpected was what followed; an actual introduction. “I’m Draco,” he said. “Draco Lestrange. Do you want me to say <em>welcome to Port Angeles</em> or have you heard just about enough of that by now?”</p><p>It took Marcus a moment to place where he’d spotted Draco before, and when he remembered, it also took work not to redden a little. Casting his gaze around the tables during lunch, he’d spotted the family of extraordinarily attractive brothers and sisters together, all looking completely at ease. He hadn’t dared ask who they were at the time, simply watched from a distance out of interest despite the constant questions. Now he’d met one of them, and he wasn’t sure what to do with it. That left politeness, accompanied by a brief, uncertain smile. “Pleased to meet you.” When he asked about welcome to Port Angeles, though, Marcus wrinkled his nose without meaning to. Realising what he’d done and how it might come across, he hastily explained himself. “I don’t think a lot of people realise that I’ve been to Port Angeles before. I mean, my dad lives here.” The only reason he hadn’t been around for the past few summers was because his dad had flown to Phoenix instead and stayed in a rented house for a couple of weeks. It was good for him to get some vacation time in, so Marcus hadn’t protested.</p><p>Draco’s reply confirmed what had been mentioned to him only briefly. “I think the problem is that no one has seen you around lately. I get it. My family and I moved here a couple of years ago. People wouldn’t leave us alone, at first.”</p><p>It was a piece of information that Marcus filed away without quite meaning to. <em>So definitely not local or just from another city. Further out maybe.</em> “I guess it’s strange to me because I’m used to just being…not invisible, exactly, but part of things? Anything else just feels awkward.” He gave a slightly embarrassed laugh, because privately he could understand why people wouldn’t leave Draco and his siblings alone. “I don’t really stand out much, so it’s strange to have people offering to show me where everything is and asking questions.” He definitely hadn’t in Phoenix, anyway, and he had faith that soon enough it’d be the same here.</p><p>“People are trying to be nice. They’re also no doubt being repetitive and not very smart about what they say. You’re new, though, so they’re going to talk to you.” It was a relatively point blank response, and Marcus shrugged a little. “It’s meant well. I mean, everyone’s been nice, but at least four people offered to show me where the library was.” Including Terence. “You…can’t really miss it.”</p><p>It was clear that Draco understood that from his expression, because the library had a huge sign and was in plain view on entering the school. “I take it that you don’t like Port Angeles very much?”</p><p>Marcus shook his head a little, because that wasn’t the case. “I don’t dislike it. I chose to come here.” He paused before giving further explanation, startled to realise that he’d talked more to the one person who appeared to be mostly disinterested in him than he had to anyone who had asked numerous questions. <em>It figures. </em>“My mom and I moved around a lot before we settled in Phoenix, so it’s just jarring starting over and being the new person when I didn’t think that would happen again until college, maybe.” There was more to it than that, but he wasn’t going to get into it, with Draco or with himself. “I’ve had a couple weeks, but I think it’ll take time to get used to it. Was it the same for you?”</p><p>Professor Binns interrupted with the announcement they were going to continue with the class because it seemed that everyone had grasped the finer points of the discussion. That told Marcus what he’d already suspected: he hadn’t even been listening to any of the pairs. It did put an end to any further conversation, though, since the remainder of the class consisted of more taking notes and the teacher occasionally calling on people to ask questions when he thought they weren’t paying attention. As it turned out, most of the class wasn’t paying attention, and Marcus couldn’t concentrate either because he could feel how tense Draco was sat beside him. He also noticed that there was no attempt to take any notes; his notebook wasn’t even open.</p><p>When the class finally came to an end, Marcus didn’t have the chance to say anything more. As soon as the bell rang, Draco was out of the door without a backward glance. As he gathered his stuff into his bag, he couldn’t help but wonder what just happened.</p>
