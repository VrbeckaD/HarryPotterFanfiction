    <p><strong>A/N:</strong><br/>
</p>
<p>for those of you who read the first chapter when i first published this work, it was very different. I was unhappy with the chapter and had little inspiration to continue working on this story. However, I have rewritten the chapter, and decided to publish it here, since there are many of you who have wished I continue writing it. I actually published this newly improved chapter on it's own, but decided i'd rather edit it into this work, since the story line was similar.  </p>
<p> I hope you all enjoy!</p><hr/>

    <em>June 29, 1945</em>

</p>
<p>
  <em>Headmaster Armando Dippet,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>My name is Harry Potter. I am fifteen years old and from England. I am British by birth and I suppose by nature as well. I grew up in Palotin, a small village surprisingly close to London. Up until now I have been homeschooled by my parents. I have no brothers or sisters.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Two weeks ago my village was attacked by Grindelwald and his followers. Me and a local wandmaker were the only people to survive. I am an orphan now.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Due to my current status, I do not have a home nor a school to attend. My mother, Amandora Potter, and father, Edmund Potter, both attended Hogwarts. Their reasoning for not enrolling me when I was eleven is still a mystery to me. Regardless, they have spoken fondly of you and their time at Hogwarts. Attached to this letter you will find what my parents have taught me thus far, as well as my full record which I received from the Ministry of Magic.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I suppose it is rather clear that I am trying to enroll at Hogwarts, I hope that you will accept my application....</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Harry James Potter</em>
</p><hr/>
<p>
  <em>September 1, 1945</em>
</p>
<p>Harry Potter stood at the platform nine and three quarters, watching as students around him twisted through the large crowd at the platform. Steam from the engine of the Hogwarts express covered them all in white mist. He felt a pang in his heart as next to him, a little girl hugged her teary eyed mother before she boarded the train.</p>
<p>Harry had sent a letter to the headmaster of Hogwarts about two months ago. Surprisingly, he had received an acceptance letter as well as a long, letter full of pity and the headmasters condolences the next day. Arriving at Hogwarts had been the only thing on his mind that whole summer, and had kept him rather optimistic as he spent most of the summer locked away at a random hotel in Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>Truthfully he had been haunted by the events that happened at the beginning of the summer which had left him one, an orphan and two, homeless.</p>
<p>Breaking away from his thoughts, Harry quickly boarded the train as the conductor blew the whistle and went to find a (hopefully empty) compartment. The compartments and halls of the train were already full of other students, many of which were laughing rather hysterically and greeting each other after the long summer break. Many of them paid no attention to Harry, but some shot him a confused look, not recognizing the older student. To his relief, Harry found an empty compartment toward the end of the train and sat down, preparing himself for the long ride to Hogwarts.</p><hr/>
<p>Stepping off the train the castle was in plain view. It was huge and beautifully lit. To Harry, who had barely ever left his village-except to go to Diagon Alley occasionally- the castle felt like something out of a dream. A little dazed, Harry barely heard someone calling his name.</p>
<p>”Potter.”</p>
<p>Harry turned around, behind him, a girl about his age was walking quickly towards him. She was tall, with blonde hair and sharp features. “Harry Potter?” The girl asked once she had caught up to Harry.</p>
<p>”That's me, yeah,” Harry said, extending his hand for her to shake.</p>
<p>”Soren Finn, pleasure to meet you.” Soren said, shaking Harry’s hand firmly. (<em>Harry noted how mugglish her name sounded </em>).</p>
<p>”You too,”</p>
<p>Letting go of Harry’s hand, Soren motioned for the two to keep walking.</p>
<p>”Professor Dumbledore asked me to help you find your way to his office.” She explained.</p>
<p>”Great thanks a lot,” Harry said, smiling gently. The two walked in a slightly uncomfortable silence. From the corner of his eye, Harry studied her. She was pretty, with blue eyes and sharp cheekbones, Harry found himself wondering if she had a boyfriend.</p>
<p>”What brings you to Hogwarts?” Soren asked.</p>
<p>”The war,” Harry said truthfully, looking straight ahead at the students in front of him. He could feel Soren look at him.</p>
<p>”I’m sorry…” she said, and it sounded like she meant it.</p>
<p>”Its uh… okay…” Harry said awkwardly. “So what year are you in?” he asked, eager to change the subject before she started asking more questions.</p>
<p>”Seventh, so it’s my last year here…” she said, smiling.</p>
<p>”What are you planning on doing after you graduate?”</p>
<p>”I want to be an auror,” she said confidently, “but my parents are<em> encouraging </em>me to become a healer…”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“What about you? What year are you in?” Soren asked.</p>
<p>“Sixth.”</p>
<p>“Ah! You’re lucky then, you don’t have to worry about OWLS or NEWTS.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled. The walk to the castle wasn’t too long and Soren kept asking him polite questions to pass the time.</p>
<p>“What house do you think you’ll be sorted into?” She asked as they neared the front doors of the castle.</p>
<p>“I don’t know… I read about the houses in Hogwarts: A History-”</p>
<p>“-that book is horrendously boring” Soren interrupted.</p>
<p>“Right…” Harry said giving her a fake smile, “if I had to guess then maybe Ravenclaw or Slytherin…”</p>
<p>“Well i’m in Gryffindor,” Soren said a little too confidently in Harry’s opinion. “Maybe you’ll be sorted into our house instead, it’d be great to know you a little better. You could even tryout for our quidditch team so then we could see each other all the time…” Harry was beginning to get the feeling that Soren had little to no friends.</p>
<p>“Yeah that would be cool,” he said politely, as the students in front of them stopped in front of the entrance to the castle. The large oak doors opened loudly, and Harry once again felt an overwhelming amount of amazement and wonder as he walked into the castle. The sounds of laughter and quick footsteps echoed around the halls as the students made their way through the castle. Harry admired the numerous paintings of famous wizards on the walls whose eyes followed the students.</p>
<p>He felt a tug on his robe sleeve and turned his head to look at a smiling Soren, who nudged her head toward an empty hallway, “this way.”<br/>
The two broke away from the rest of the students and quickly made through the lantern lit hallways. They stopped in front of brown, wooden door and Soren knocked lightly. Harry was careful not to let his nervousness show as the door quickly opened to reveal silver bearded man with half moon spectacles.</p>
<p>“Ah Ms.Finn! Just in time,” he said kindly, opening the door more for Harry and Soren to enter. The office was small but very cozy, with a fire lit by a huge desk and shelves upon shelves full of books everywhere Harry looked.</p>
<p>“And you must be Harry Potter,” The professor said, gesturing for Harry to take a seat in front of the large desk. Soren remained standing.</p>
<p>“My name is Albus Dumbledore, I’m head of the Gryffindor house and teach transfiguration.” Dumbledore said as he sat down.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you,” Harry said politely.</p>
<p>Turning his attention to Soren, “Thank you for your help Ms.Finn, five points to Gryffindor. Now hurry back to the great hall so you don’t miss the sorting of the new students,” Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>“See you around Harry,” Soren said quickly before leaving the office.</p>
<p>”Now I can imagine you are exhausted and a little peckish after your journey here,” Dumbledore said, “so I’ll make this as fast as possible so you’ll have plenty of time to enjoy the feast.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded curtly.</p>
<p>“I do not mean to bring past trauma up but as I understand it your parents were killed after Grindelwald attacked your village?” Dumbledore asked softly.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“My condolences, we have recently had a noticeable amount of new students enroll at Hogwarts because of the war-” there was a slight pause as Dumbledore looked at Harry, who shifted uncomfortably in his chair. “- I’m sure you are aware of the support the school offers for orphaned students?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Harry said. All his books, quills, parchment and robes were paid for by the school -even though Harry’s parents had left him with some money- Harry had happily accepted the free supplies.</p>
<p>“Now then, hopefully Soren filled you in on everything you need to know about Hogwarts,”</p>
<p>“Somewhat yes, but I did read Hogwarts: A History before my arrival.” Harry said.</p>
<p>“Excellent! Though I do agree with most of the students about how the book is written in a boring manor, it is very useful.”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t say anything to this.</p>
<p>”Now I must remind you Harry, the house you will be sorted into will serve as a family for the years you spend at Hogwarts. If I am not mistaken you will be going into sixth year?”</p>
<p>”Yes,” Harry said.</p>
<p>”Wonderful, I’m sure you’ll make great friends,” Dumbledore smiled to which Harry politely smiled back.</p>
<p>“The book didn’t mention how students are sorted however,” Harry inquired.</p>
<p>”Ah! The sorting itself is always an aura of mystery to the new students,” Dumbledore said, his eyes twinkling, “we use a very ancient sorting hat, one which was used by the very founders of Hogwarts to sort the students.” From a shelf behind him Dumbledore pulled out a rather saggy hat.</p>
<p>Walking around the table, Dumbledore placed the hat onto Harry’s head. ”Lets hope this doesn’t take longer than a few minutes,” Harry heard him mutter. The large hat fell over his eyes and Harry couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>”Mr.Potter, aren’t you an interesting one,” a voice murmured in Harry’s mind, making him jerk forward slightly.</p>
<p>”I feel an overpowering amount of great intellect and ambition but also bravery and loyalty. There is a thirst, a thirst to prove yourself… I see great things before you, no matter the path, fame and glory. This is what you want, yes? Hmm, I believe Slytherin will serve you well… yes…”</p>
<p>Harry felt his heart pounding, the hat was silent for a moment before bellowing, “Slytherin!”</p>
<p>The hat was quickly lifted off his head. “I do wish Professor Slughorn was here, he is the head of Slytherin house.” Dumbledore said, smiling. </p><hr/>
<p>After having been sorted, Harry found his way to the great hall with the help of Dumbledore, who on their way there talked to Harry rather excitedly about his favorite muggle candies.</p>
<p>“This is the great hall, we have three meals here everyday. I suppose I’ll let you walk in yourself, it’d be rather awkward to be accompanied by a professor to your table…” Dumbledore said, smiling at Harry kindly.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Harry said to the professor before pushing the doors to the great hall open. Harry drank in the scene in front of him, the great hall was abuzz with energy. Four long tables filled the hall, one table for each house. The open ceiling was bright with floating candle and glistened with the night skies stars.</p>
<p>The hall echoed with voices and laughter. As he made his way to what he assumed to be the Slytherin table, (judging by the snake crests all the students had on their robes) he heard bits and pieces of many conversations. Some students turned to stare at him, and some whispered as he passed them.</p>
<p>Harry spent most of the feast sitting next to some fifth year Slytherins who kindly told him about the Slytherin house and some of the notable students in it. One girl, named Annäis, pointed out a sixth year prefect named Tom Riddle. He was seemed to be in deep conversation with the boy sitting across from him. “He is <em>gorgeous </em>,” Annäis said. Though Harry thought she might have not meant to say this aloud, he silently agreed. Tom had black hair and pale, white skin, sharp cheekbones and a strong jaw.</p>
<p>Almost as if Tom sensed he was being stared at, he turned to look in Harry’s direction, and their eyes locked for a second. Bright green eyes staring into intelligent, dark brown. There was a sudden power between them, one which made Harry’s skin prickle. Harry awkwardly turned to look away, but caught Tom smirking slightly, before nudging his friends who also turned to look at Harry.</p>
<p>The feast went by relatively quickly, and Harry was tired and quite ready for bed. The food in front of them disappeared quickly. The headmaster made a quick speech, and as Harry started at him, all he could think about was what the headmaster had said in his letter to Harry:  “ <em>These are dark times we live in Harry and I am sorry to hear how you have been affected, in the worst way… I welcome you wholeheartedly to Hogwarts… be careful…”</em></p>
<p>Harry was rather abruptly pulled from his thoughts as a hand touched his shoulder. Startled he quickly turned around to meet the gaze of Tom Riddle.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we’ve met before,” Tom said, “My name is Tom Riddle.”</p>
<p><em>I know </em>, Harry thought. “Harry Potter,” he said, shaking Tom’s hand. Harry noticed that other students were leaving the great hall, and there was a line of younger students behind Tom.</p>
<p>“You must be new then?” His voice was smooth and he articulated his words well.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Harry said, growing rather tired of that question.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m guiding these first years to the Slytherin common room. Seeing as your new you could walk with us so you don’t get lost.”</p>
<p>“That’d be great, thanks.” Harry replied.</p>
<p>Harry walked with Tom and the first years along the halls, down many stairs and to what Tom explained to the dungeons. Tom had quite masterfully captivated the younger students attention and told them all about Hogwarts, all the while also sternly explaining the rules of the Slytherin house.</p>
<p>“What year are you in?” Tom asked Harry conversationally once they neared the common room.</p>
<p>“Sixth.”</p>
<p>“Oh so you’ll possibly be sharing a dorm with me,” Tom said softly. Harry turned to look at Tom, who met Harry’s look with a small smile. Once again Harry felt the same pang of energy, sending a strange shiver down his spine. If Tom felt the same thing, Harry did not notice, but the other boy looked away and didn’t say anything else for the rest of their walk.</p>
<p>They entered the Slytherin common room through a concealed entrance, hidden by a painting of a dark lake. The common room was beautiful. Filled with dark green and silver chairs and couches and dark wooden tables and shelves, the room felt cozy and all the while perfectly represented the Slytherin colors. By some couches there was a fire burning, and students were gathered around it. The windows looked out into the depths of a lake.</p>
<p>Harry saw Tom join the group of students by the fire, who all turned to look at Harry. Feeling awkward, Harry decided to look for his dormitory. He headed down a narrow hallway dimly lit by lanterns. He neared the end of hall and climbed some stairs to find a few doors which had scrolls pinned onto them. He spotted his name amongst some others:</p>
<p>
  <em>Abraxas Malfoy</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Orion Black</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Montgomery Lestrange</em>
</p>
<p>And most notably:</p>
<p>
  <em>Tom Riddle</em>
</p>
<p>Harry opened the door. The dormitory looked much like the common room, except there were five beds with dark green tapestries. Exhausted, Harry quickly climbed into the bed which his trunk lay in front of, pulled the curtains closed and went to sleep.</p>
