<p>Skin</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Draco sighs as a tongue caresses his instep, his inner leg, moving towards his most sensitive skin. Fingers clenched in dark hair, Draco breathes, “<i>Harry</i>.” </p>
<p>“Mmm,” Harry hums, his tongue never leaving Draco’s skin. </p>
<p>“Please,” Draco begs as Harry laps at his hip. “Fuck,” he gasps as Harry mouths his balls. And when Harry swallows his cock, Draco can’t speak at all. </p>
<p>Afterwards, when he’s sated and spent, Draco clutches Harry close. </p>
<p>But Harry still caresses him, this time with hands which gently trace Draco’s scars. “Draco,” he whispers, voice thick with apology. </p>
<p>“I know.” Draco kisses him. “I know.” </p>
