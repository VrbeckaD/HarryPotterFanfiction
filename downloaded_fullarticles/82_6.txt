    <hr/><p>It was the third time in a week that Blaise had cancelled, and Draco was not having it.</p><p> </p><p>"What could be so important that you'd turn down a night at the races?" Draco asked through the Floo, not bothering to moderate his irritation. "”This is the fifth time already.”"</p><p> </p><p>"Dear me, is gambling not so fun without boring little old me?" Even set amidst flickering green flames, Blaise’s smirk was evident.</p><p> </p><p>Draco didn't plan on letting Blaise know that it had indeed been a lot more tedious without a handy companion to keep away the riffraff. It was inevitable that a single, wealthy wizard appearing alone at a social function would be besieged by a constant stream of callers at his box. "How I do enjoy seeing you lose,” Draco said instead. Smugly reminding Blaise of his losses the last time would surely do the trick to entice him to attend again.</p><p> </p><p>Flame-encased Blaise tilted his head sideways and eyed Draco speculatively. "Have you ever considered you might just have a gambling problem? To add to the list of all the other problems, that is.” </p><p> </p><p>"Nonsense." Draco dismissed that immediately. "I win far more than I lose."</p><p> </p><p>"That's what they all say," Blaise said, tilting his head backwards to regard Draco with what seemed like too much amusement. “You must agree, Malfoy, that all this racing gets a bit tedious after a while.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco did not, in fact, agree, as he was actually going significantly more often than just once a week. Nobody had to know that, of course. Not even Blaise. Nobody had to know that in addition to the gambling parlors and the racetracks that Draco had recently discovered the joys of fight night at the dragon pit.</p><p> </p><p>"You enjoyed Lisboa the other week.” Even to himself, he sounded as sullen as a toddler.</p><p> </p><p>"I guess it wasn’t too shabby," Blaise said, the admission sounding as reluctant as someone about to have an embedded wisdom tooth extracted. "But only every once in a while."</p><p> </p><p>"Precisely. So, tonight then?" Draco almost felt like rubbing his hands together in anticipation.</p><p> </p><p>Blaise seemed torn and then he took a deep breath. "It’ll have to be tomorrow. I have plans for tonight." At Draco's expression of betrayal, Blaise relented even further. "I'll even front the first round of bets."</p><p> </p><p>Draco muttered something noncommittal and watched suspiciously as his friend murmured something about having plans and hurriedly disappeared from the Floo.</p><p> </p><p>A horrible thought struck him as he stayed by the fireplace on his knees. What if Blaise had gotten a girlfriend? Draco could see more of his pastimes reduced to solo trips as a result. Not to mention the fact that Blaise was so easily persuaded that he would probably change into an entirely different (boring) person if he found a moralising girlfriend.</p><p> </p><p>That just wouldn't do at all.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Blaise’s actions didn't seem in the least bit furtive, which further suggested to Draco that Blaise was now in a public relationship. He stealthily followed him from the cafe where Blaise had been taking in his afternoon tea, suspicions growing stronger when Blaise didn’t look left or right or even seem to be aware that he was being followed. From his quick, sure footsteps, it appeared that this route towards Knockturn Alley was a familiar one. Draco continued stalking his prey until Blaise stopped in front of an old-fashioned wooden door with a ripped awning.</p><p> </p><p>Then he stepped out of the shadows and took off the silencing charms on his shoes and the Notice-Me-Not on his general person.</p><p> </p><p>"So this is where you've been sneaking off to?" Draco's whisper was a hiss against Blaise's profile. "Have you been holding out on me?"</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s grip on Blaise’s shirt collar prevented him from jumping into the air, though Blaise did squeak very satisfyingly in a high-pitched voice. "You scared the living daylights out of me.“ Blaise’s eyes narrowed. “Did...did you follow me here?"</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s expression was that of a man patiently explaining things to a very dimwitted audience. “After you so rudely canceled on me and then left the Floo without a word of explanation, I had to check where you were going.”</p><p> </p><p>“Because?” Blaise asked, his tone more amused than annoyed.</p><p> </p><p>“Just in case you’d gotten yourself into trouble.” Draco felt himself floundering as Blaise lifted an eyebrow in response. “Or,” Draco warmed to his subject, “if you’d gone and got yourself a girlfriend. You have appalling taste in women, and, as your best friend, it is my duty to look out for your general well-being.”</p><p> </p><p>Blaise raised the other eyebrow. “I have appalling taste in women? Says the wizard who dated Pansy Parkinson.”</p><p> </p><p>“I was young and decidedly more foolish.”</p><p> </p><p>“Age, Malfoy, doesn’t always bring wisdom.” Blaise peered right and left in a manner which was surreptitious at best and downright creepy at worst. “I’m going to need you to leave now.”  He pulled a silky piece of fabric out of his pocket. With a motion or two of his wand, the top of Blaise’s head and eyes were masked in black, revealing only two hazel eyes that glittered with excitement and his cleft jaw. It only emphasised Blaise’s grin, which was filled with anticipation. </p><p> </p><p>Draco frowned at his friend’s action and the mask itself. He wasn’t completely sure, but it seemed as though the small strip of fabric was imbued with an actual masking charm because it obscured more than just Blaise’s face. If Draco didn’t look closely, he would have sworn that the man standing before him was a regular chap with a square chin. Blink again, and masked Blaise reappeared.</p><p> </p><p>I’m not bloody leaving now," Draco said, sharply watching Blaise's every move. He hadn't released his grip on Blaise's coat either. Was it his imagination or had Blaise doused himself rather liberally with his very coveted cologne made from red panda musk? He purposefully sniffed. “And you stink.”</p><p> </p><p>Blaise seemed to be pressed for time, since he chose to ignore that insult as he straightened his lapels and shirt collar. "You are not coming with me. I found this place, and I'm keeping it to myself."</p><p> </p><p>All of a sudden, Draco was even more determined to follow his friend in. "Well, I guess I’ll go on my merry way then.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really?”</p><p> </p><p>“Really.”</p><p> </p><p>Not even the mask could disguise Blaise’s shock.</p><p> </p><p>Draco smirked at his expression. "Of course not! I’m coming with you.” He gave a triumphant laugh. “When have I ever been thwarted just like that? On top of everything, you're being so mysterious that I shall definitely need to see this place for myself."</p><p> </p><p>"I could obliviate you," Blaise muttered under his breath.</p><p> </p><p>"Do that. Please know that I do keep a diary, as well as a copy of my memories before I go out every day."</p><p> </p><p>"Paranoid bastard," was Blaise's almost inaudible reply before he sighed, cursing slightly under his breath. "Fine. Just--here." He waved his wand and Draco found his face draped with a soft cloth and something tickling the nape of his neck.</p><p> </p><p>Draco touched his face and looked around for a mirrored surface to check himself out but had to make do with Blaise’s resigned words. "You'll be recognised for certain if you enter with that hair of yours and then I'll be recognised. Anyway. Just keep your comments to a minimum and we'll be fine. If you get me kicked out of here, I will end you. Do you understand? Do not mess with me here." Blaise jabbed a pointy finger in Draco's chest.</p><p> </p><p>Draco knocked Blaise's hand away and adjusted his lapels before carelessly nodding his acquiescence. The bottom half of him wasn't nearly as nonchalant as he bounced slightly on the balls of his feet with impatience. He didn’t know what he had expected, but he was now absolutely certain that exceptional gambling awaited him. What other reason was there for Blaise cancelling three times in a single week?</p><p> </p><p>Blaise stuck his wand into a hole in the door as Draco watched with narrowed eyes. The hole shone with bright green light as Blaise's wand was recognised, and then there was the tell-tale sound of locks unlatching. The door fell open an inch, and Blaise moved quickly to grip the edge before pulling his wand out and stowing it away.</p><p> </p><p>Blaise flashed Draco another warning look—which Draco ignored—and then they stepped through.</p><p> </p><p>The room in front of them was a very unassuming place with fairly low ceilings and dim lighting. It was nothing more than a squarish area that acted as a receptacle to a doorway that opened up into a long corridor. Draco wasn't impressed. Compared to the Lisboa, this place was rather shabby. He was tempted to go back to his tracks for the evening. It was just that it hadn't been as fun without company lately, and then there was Blaise's uncharacteristic anticipation for what was to come.</p><p> </p><p>Draco scrutinised his friend's back as they walked through the corridor in silence. There was an air of heightened excitement from Blaise, and he was fairly straining forward. It had Draco wondering just what was so exciting about this place. The only thing he knew Blaise really enjoyed was—</p><p> </p><p>He grabbed Blaise by the back of his robes and yanked him backwards. "Is this place what I think it is? Did you bring me to another one of your questionable sex parlors?"</p><p> </p><p>Someone brushed past them in the corridor. "It's mixed tonight, boys. The all-male crowd is on Mondays and Thursdays."</p><p> </p><p>Draco froze, but the woman in black robes didn't spare them another glance as she continued down the hallway.</p><p> </p><p>Blaise shook himself free of Draco's grip. " Brought you? As if I could have prevented you from tagging along." He sounded disgruntled. "Now, come on . You're going to make me late."</p><p> </p><p>Then Blaise was off, and Draco had to speed up to keep up.</p><p> </p><p>Draco had been to sex parlors with Blaise a few times, and it wasn't his thing at all. All of them had been more luxurious than this place, decorated with a plethora of candles and billowy scented curtains. One had an enchanted room to make it seem like the guests had stepped in out of the London snowstorm onto a tropical island. There were a host of women who approached them to offer them drinks on a tray, with sinuous bodies draped artfully with transparent gauze of all colours. They had all been on display, but the half-naked bodies was natural in the context of the enchanted setting. Incense had billowed through the room, enveloping the guests in a hazy mist of fragrance--and possibly illusory or enhancing charms.</p><p> </p><p>Blaise had seemed to know everyone, which—well, that made Draco shudder at the implications. He didn't fancy sticking any part of his body anywhere that had previously been entered by Blaise.</p><p> </p><p>Further, it didn't help his distaste to find that the places Blaise liked to frequent employed mostly orphaned Squibs, who didn't know how to cross over into the Muggle world. Or maybe they had, and this was the place they felt most at home.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever his complaints, that place had had an aura of luxury of well-maintained wards at the very least. Even if it struck him as wrong to have amorous encounters tinged with such a professional and slightly tawdry air.</p><p> </p><p>This place, thought Draco as they passed into another room. It was large, but nevertheless looked like an interim lecture hall and felt distinctly improvised. It’d be just like Blaise, though, to have enrolled himself into some sort of class to better himself at the only hobby he seemed to have a fondness for.</p><p> </p><p>There was a wide open space in the center of the room, cordoned off with velvet ropes, possibly to give the room a sense of luxury. They failed utterly. There were chairs placed against the sides of the room, and two walls were completely covered with floor to ceiling mirrors, in the way of dueling rooms.</p><p> </p><p>As Draco stood there taking in the room, trying to act as though he knew exactly what was about to occur, Blaise had gone off to one side of the mirrored walls, where other men were gathered. Draco sauntered after him as nonchalantly as he could.</p><p> </p><p>“--schedule tonight?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re in luck, Black Mamba,” said a short, squat man wearing the same eye mask that covered up half of his face as everyone else. He was built like a bulldog and appeared equally pugnacious. “You’re paired off with Medusa herself.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco no longer thought it was a sex club. Black Mamba and—Medusa—well… It seemed more like some sort of underground dueling association, although the area for what was likely the arena could have been larger. Draco raised his eyebrows and waited for Blaise to respond.</p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, he didn’t seem put off by his fate. “Medusa, eh? Don’t mind telling you chaps that I rather fancy another go at her.”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s undefeated.” This time, a man with pale, freckly skin under his dirty-blond beard spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not that she’s undefeated that’s got everyone roused, mate.” The bulldog unlatched the snap of his robes to reveal a short, powerful build squeezed into black trews and a white shirt. He continued to disrobe further, disquieting Draco mightily. Soon, he was down to only his pants and stretching himself in all directions. His muscles rippled as he tried to pull his arms all the way around him, but could only make it part of the distance, given how bulky the sides of his chest were. “It’s the fact that she won’t have a go at any of us after.”</p><p> </p><p>Blaise was grinning under his mask. “Perhaps she just doesn’t fancy you, Baldie.”</p><p> </p><p>The bulldog scowled. “It’s Baldasarre .”</p><p> </p><p>“I think I rather like my chances,” Blaise said, turning to admire himself in the mirror. He undid his robes and negligently handed them off in Draco’s direction. Draco stepped backwards instead of reaching for them. The robes fell to the ground, and Blaise glared at Draco in the mirror. Draco shrugged, using his wand to levitate Blaise’s robes to a nearby chair. He didn’t bother to charm them folded.</p><p> </p><p>Then Draco watched with jaw slightly agape as Blaise also undressed down to his skivvies.</p><p> </p><p>All the men did, including the blond man whose mask didn't cover the top of his head, apparently called Leo, and another tall, well-built man with a light brown scruff named Curaidh.</p><p> </p><p>Draco stepped backwards warily to avoid being struck in the face by all the disrobing.</p><p> </p><p>Extreme gambling or dilapidated orgy parlor? Draco was at a complete loss as to what was happening here.</p><p> </p><p>The only thing he did know was that he did not enjoy being surrounded by undressing men. Just why were they all disrobing at the same time? He was so perturbed by this mystery that he almost missed what was happening across the room until he looked up to see three women in various states of undress.</p><p> </p><p>First, there was a dark-skinned woman wearing nothing but a brassiere and skimpy knickers. She kept tossing her long, straight black hair over her shoulders, and didn’t seem bothered by the fact that her breasts were very nearly exposed by her motions. His mother would have called her “big-boned,” which Draco thought an extreme euphemism. On the other hand, she was possessed of a giant set of tits and a large arse that some men undoubtedly thought attractive.</p><p> </p><p>There was a tall, slender woman with her hair tied up in a long, blond ponytail. She was wearing a white bra that seemed more decorous than the stringy bit that the dark-skinned woman wore, and her bottoms also covered more of her body.</p><p> </p><p>The final girl was average in height with short hair styled in a spikey sort of way and dyed a platinum colour with black tips. She kept flinging her neck from side to side in a manner that Draco rather thought would cause her to suffer severe whiplash.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s the Cockatoo,” said Blaise directly into Draco's ear.</p><p> </p><p>Draco glanced sideways, then skirted quickly away when he saw that Blaise was wearing nothing but his pants. “My dear fellow, what have we said about unmentionables etiquette? Kindly keep your distance.”</p><p> </p><p>Blaise rolled his eyes, a motion that was all the more exaggerated with the mask covering half his face.</p><p> </p><p>Draco narrowed his eyes at Blaise. “You know, you’re not nearly as incognito as you might think. I’d wager some of these people know exactly who you really are.”</p><p> </p><p>Blaise shrugged indifferently. “The anonymity spell on the mask only works if you don’t recognise the person underneath. I’m not bothered by it. I’m a good-looking guy. I want to give the girls something to see.” He preened a little, and Draco fought to keep his dinner down.</p><p> </p><p>“FIVE MINUTES REMAINING,” boomed a stentorian voice through the use of an Amplifying Charm that caused Draco to jump.</p><p> </p><p>He looked about warily, fingering the wand in his pocket. “What really is happening here? Surely, you don’t need to undress to duel.” He hated the way his voice rose uncertainly at the end of his sentence. He didn’t much like surprises.</p><p> </p><p>Around twenty people had gathered around the room, some standing about, others filling the handful of seats provided. Draco tried to infer which one of them would prove to be the most difficult opponent if he were suddenly set upon.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, I would tell you, but I really think I should just let you discover that for yourself.” Blaise’s white teeth flashed for a moment. “It’s far more amusing that way.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco folded his arms and tapped his fingers impatiently. “Well, and just which one’s Medusa? Isn’t that your opponent tonight?”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s not here yet,” Blaise replied, absently watching the rest of the room.</p><p> </p><p>“ONE MINUTE,” the voice boomed.</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps she won’t be here and we can leave early to make the--”</p><p> </p><p>“TEN. NINE. EIGHT. SEVEN--”</p><p> </p><p>A figure launched itself through the door. At the sound of THREE, TWO, ONE, the door’s outline glowed and sealed itself with an audible crackling sound. Then the door completely disappeared from the wall.</p><p> </p><p>Blaise grinned at Draco.</p><p> </p><p>Draco didn’t return his smile. </p><p> </p><p>He would have been more concerned by the door’s disappearance had he not been completely distracted by the last figure to enter the room. She was a small woman, completely dwarfed by her robes and a mane of bushy, untameable brown hair that was almost immediately charmed into multiple braids by its owner. The effect from afar looked a bit like the mythical snakes of--</p><p> </p><p>“Medusa,” Blaise said into Draco’s ear again.</p><p> </p><p>Draco grimaced and clapped a hand over his ear. “My one rule is that you maintain your distance as you're getting ready to stick it into your unfortunate victim."</p><p> </p><p>“Apologies, dear friend.” Blaise clapped Draco twice on his back, hard enough to make him jump. Draco pulled out his wand and pointed it in warning at Blaise, who held up both hands in mock surrender.</p><p> </p><p>Blaise moved away when someone approached him to speak, and Draco turned his attention to Medusa. Before it had been charmed, for a split second, her hair had reminded him of someone else he used to know. Brown, bushy, completely out of control hair--it couldn’t be Hermione Granger, could it?</p><p> </p><p>Draco could not imagine for a second that someone as uptight as Hermione Granger would deign to visit a place such as this. She had been completely uppity when he had known her, her nose always in the air whenever he passed within a foot of her as though he were the one beneath notice and not the other way round. She had never given him the time of day even on the rare occasion that he did speak to her, except to roll her eyes and give a great big condescending sniff before she would toss her big hair and walk away.</p><p> </p><p>It had always been like being thrown a gauntlet and not being able to pick it up. Either she was surrounded with a constant sentinel of blithering idiots, or Draco had always been left with a nagging itch that he could not even reach to scratch. It had been that infuriating. He would have never admitted it to anyone, but quite honestly, if the chance ever came to fuck her thoroughly, he would grab her with both hands.</p><p> </p><p>He watched as Medusa hurriedly dropped her bag in her corner while stretching out her muscles. Like Cockatoo, she also stretched her neck on each side and managed to extend her arms over her ears and lean at right angles at both sides before dropping her robes altogether.</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s mouth grew dry.</p><p> </p><p>No, it couldn’t be Hermione Granger. Not this woman who was lean and curved in all the right places. This woman had a small waist—completely uncovered now—so that he could see the tiny dip of her navel. Her legs were not as long as the other girls, but they were straight and slim. Her breasts might not have been as fulsome as the dark-haired woman called Leda, but they were taut and firm and high. Most enticing of all, Draco could see the pucker of her nipples through her top.</p><p> </p><p>Medusa wasn’t standing around posing and grinning. Instead her mouth was perfectly neutral, and her eyes stared off into space as she finished her stretches.</p><p> </p><p>He supposed he understood why Blaise was so stimulated by all this. All things sexual were Blaise’s game, with nary a thought for selectivity. The immediate state of undress by all the participants was right up Blaise’s alley, the horny bugger. Draco had heard of strip dueling and in fact had indulged in the game when mashed. But this--he had no idea what kind of dueling required all the participants to be in such a state of undress prior to dueling. Underwater dueling, perhaps? He gazed around surreptitiously but there was no water in sight.</p><p> </p><p>“ARE WE READY!” came the loudspeaker voice again, only this time the woman, someone wearing the short shift of ancient Spartan fashion walked forward, a wand at her throat. A thunder of lusty cheers met her greeting.</p><p> </p><p>The third wall rippled, and a large canvas unrolled itself from the ceiling. As Draco watched, words began to appear on the fabric, and then a chart formed. Eight names began to ripple inside the boxes, rearranging themselves to align with the correct partners. Medusa versus Black Mamba was the second pairing.</p><p> </p><p>“RULES!</p><p> </p><p>“TWO TEN-MINUTE ROUNDS TO A MATCH! Participants begin in swimwear, and if the garments haven’t been taken off by halftime, they shall be fully nude for the second.</p><p> </p><p>“A five-second pin is worth two points. Submission is worth five points. Forced orgasm is worth fifteen points. Most important of all, the winner gets to FUCK the loser any way they want! The only form of charmwork allowed are WANDLESS spells designed to defend yourself from a pin, and only ONE IS permitted in total per match. They also cost you a point a piece.</p><p> </p><p>“ARE WE IN AGREEMENT!”</p><p> </p><p>There was a hearty chorus of “ayes” and cheers before the first grouping went into the ring.</p><p> </p><p>Draco pulled himself together and went to confront Blaise. Blaise was, naturally, in the midst of adjusting the sizable bulge under his shorts. Draco determinedly fixed his eyes on Blaise's face. “Did I hear what I just heard? They had me until forced orgasm. Fuck the loser? ” What exactly was Blaise mixed up in?</p><p> </p><p>If Blaise hadn’t been topless, Draco would have liked to grab him by his lapels to shake him heartily.</p><p> </p><p>Blaise adjusted his mask and licked his lips. Draco shuddered and tried not to speculate about where that tongue would be later tonight. “That’s right. This is a sex fighting league. Totally off the books.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco was having a hard time trying to wrap his mind around the concept. His attention darted from the couple wrestling inside the ring to the woman named Medusa at the side of the room. Unlike the other participants, she didn’t seem to be egging the two on. She stood biting her thumb, shifting from one leg to the other, for all the world as though she were preparing for a speech, not to be in the center of attention in a sex fight.</p><p> </p><p>A sex fight.</p><p> </p><p>Sex fight.</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s brain seemed to be running in a loop.</p><p> </p><p>The two fighting in the ring were the buxom dark-skinned woman and Baldie. One minute in, Leda had pulled her own brassiere off up over her head and flung it into the crowd. She then crouched down, her hands out in front of her like claws, and feinted, right before she jumped onto Baldie. Her breasts swung wildly before she buried Baldie’s face with them. The two of them grappled like that for a moment, Baldie manfully remaining upright under the onslaught of the much larger woman.</p><p> </p><p>Except for Leda’s toplessness, the whole thing still seemed relatively-- modest , thought Draco, still unable to come to terms with it all. Then, Leda’s hand reached down to grab Baldie through his shorts and massaged him quickly so that he soon became visibly hard. A bead of wetness showed through the fabric of his pants.</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s eyebrows rose as Baldie threw Leda off before leaping on top of her, upside down so that his face was enveloped between her legs. There, in front of all the cheering onlookers, Baldie grabbed the crotch of Leda’s knickers, quickly jerking them to the side before tonguing her.</p><p> </p><p>He managed one lick before he was kneed off and flipped over Leda's shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Next to Draco, Blaise was clapping and hooting.</p><p> </p><p>Draco rubbed a hand over the bottom half of his face in his incredulity at it all. His heart was pounding like it never had at the racetracks. Sex turned sport. It was even more salacious when the pairing was decided not by choice but by random selection.</p><p> </p><p>He wasn't immune to the insanity either, although the current pair was doing nothing for him.</p><p> </p><p>Baldasarre was a funny looking man, and the fact that their sizes were so disproportionate, with Leda towering him by a head. Leda was someone that the majority of the population would consider attractive, with a flouncy air to go with those enormous breasts and heavy, rounded buttocks. She just wasn’t his type.</p><p> </p><p>He snuck a peek across the room at Medusa. She wasn’t cheering but was shifting restlessly from leg to leg, as if anticipating her turn in the ring.</p><p> </p><p>Draco felt a twitch in his pants at the mere sight of her dressed so scantily that it was an easy thing to imagine her completely naked. Which she would be before long.</p><p> </p><p>The thought made him rock hard.</p><p> </p><p>But no, he really shouldn’t stay. He had enough vices to keep him busy for the rest of his life. “I’m heading out,” he yelled to Blaise over the roar of the crowd.</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t!” Blaise shouted back without looking at him. “Door’s sealed until half-time!”</p><p> </p><p>Well, then.</p>
