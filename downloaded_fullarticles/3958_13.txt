    <p><strong>Draco looked up a</strong>t Potter from across the 8th Year common room, the two weren't really friends but they most certainly weren't enemies anymore. Potter gave half a nod as he walked in by himself, which was strange in and of itself because generally he was with Granger and Weasley.</p>
<p>The two didn't really talk, sometimes real late at night when neither could sleep or in passing during classes, but never directly. Draco was in need of his laugh, Potter had a great laugh. It was always real no matter who gave it to him. It was always real and full of happiness and Draco needed that right then.</p>
<p>"Potter," the Slytherin said standing up and edging towards him, Pansy glanced over to the two from her seat seeing Potter stop and turn to look.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"I have a joke for you." He said quietly, shrugging.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"A joke." Draco repeated the word, "surely you've heard one before." He added, unable to stop himself from spouting off. But Potter didn't seem to mind, instead he nodded and made the universal 'go on then' gesture. "It's a knock-knock joke, but you have to start it."</p>
<p>"What?" Potter ran his hands through his hair, before propping himself against the arm of the chair behind him, Draco waited patiently watching him relax into the seat. A few of the students that were all crammed into the 8th Year common room, looked up watching the two. "Alright. Knock-knock, Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Draco looked at him passively, "who's there?"</p>
<p>Potter stared at Draco before a smile spread across his face and then that laugh Draco was waiting for started from deep within his chest and his shoulders shook as it rang out. Draco grinned to himself, satisfied if he was honest, and took a step back, watching Potter laugh heavily into his hand before taking a deep breath as he started collecting himself. "That's a good one, Draco!" He said through his smile, looking up at Draco from his hunched over pose with his laugh, sagging forward slightly. "I love corny jokes, y'know?"</p>
<p>Draco did, of course he knew, he always knew what made Harry laugh. Corny jokes, whatever Muggle picture book he was reading at the time and most certainly when he watched the 1st and 2nd Years running away from him while muttering how he shouldn't have come back. Draco knew what it was that made Potter laugh, and he generally did his best to provide some form of laughter to the man in one way or another, he was far too serious all the time.</p>
<p>But what gathered his attention more than the question about the jokes was his name coming from those smiling lips, his name being said by Harry Potter with that smile and Draco knew he'd never want to hear it anyway else again. He wanted nothing more than to forever have his name be said by Harry Potter, Harry Potter and that smile.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I figured." Draco finally answered, grinning softly, "you'll be the first to know the next one I got."</p>
<p>Harry stood up from the slouched over seat, "you better." He smiled widely at the blonde, "I'll see you later, Draco." He said with a small wave and turned to leave the commons, heading to the stairs that lead to the boy's dorms.</p>
<p>"S-sure," Draco answered to his back, blinking a few times in shock before turning around to get back to his seat, seeing Pansy grinning at him. "Shut it." He snapped, slamming himself down and picking up his quill - his smile quickly back in place as he looked down at the assignment he had been working on.</p>
