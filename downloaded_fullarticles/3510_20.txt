  <em>“Naruto, you don’t have to do this.” Tsunade looked tearily at her grandchild-like subordinate.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Naruto simply smiled. “Yes, I do, Tsunade-sama. The bijuu cannot stay in this world.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The mirror, powered by chakra, with – apparently – a copy on the other side – glowed. Chakra would flow to Naruto, continuing to give him energy. Well, even if it hadn’t the bijuu reassured him that they could twist the energy and feed themselves, then him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Naruto shouldered his pack and stepped through the mirror, refusing to let any tears fall. As he did, he morphed into a purple-haired, punkish boy.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The mirror was sealed behind him, forming a small round thing.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Unbreakable, powerful in its own right.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Naruto did one last thing before letting himself fade into this world as a face. He sealed the mirror shut; it would give him energy even in its inert form. This way nobody could come after him, suspect he had been given new lease on life.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Only the loyal knew, the ANBU who had guarded his Hokage, his sensei and Iruka-sensei.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Naruto slid the mirror in the backpack and walked away, choosing a name that wasn’t normal but that fit his new persona.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Skull de Mort had arrived.</em>
</p><p>~:~</p><p>He pushed his bike into his garage, yawning as he felt the sores from his earlier antics ache.</p><p>His mirror had nearly been stolen; he was lucky to have caught the thief. He examined himself in his bathroom’s mirror, seeing his heavily pierced face and sighed, bracing himself and thinking, staring deep into the sink.</p><p>His mind was far away, speculating on what <em>might have been.</em></p><p>He closed his eyes after a certain amount of time and shook his head, washing his face and pulling his piercings out.</p><p>~:~</p><p>“So, <em>this </em>is the home of the Immortal Skull?” A man with a fedora gazed over the shitty apartment block. “Interesting.”</p><p>Said stuntman rolled his bike out, ignoring the French cursing and the plant that shattered over his head, kicking it on and rolling out of the place.</p><p>Renato Sinclair blended in with the scenery, letting the world hide him.</p><p>Hiding in plain sight.</p><p>“Hmm.” Renato stared at the plant, then strode in to the ‘Immortal Skull’s’ apartment.</p><p> It wasn’t filthy. In fact, it was too neat.</p><p>Renato was a professional; it didn’t take a genius to know that killing Skull <em>here </em>wouldn’t be too much of a challenge.</p><p>However, if rumors of his longevity were true, then Skull could <em>really </em>be immortal.</p><p>He spotted something that could <em>maybe </em>bring him insight into the other’s life.</p><p>A makeup mirror.</p><p>Renato smirked, then flared his Flames, slipping the mirror in his sleeve.</p><p>~:~</p><p>Skull tore the room apart.</p><p><em>Shit! I </em>know <em>I left it on the table! </em>He filled the room with his chakra – and froze.</p><p>An unfamiliar energy was in the room.</p><p>Like a chain reaction, the stuntman’s energy shattered the glass as his rage burned. Skull grabbed his keys and slammed his door, kicking his bike on and speeding out of it, following that energy with a focused rage.</p><p><em>How dare they take my way home.</em> Unknown to Skull, his energy fed off of that curious trail.</p><p>And a small, orange-purple Flame burned on his fingers.</p><p>~:~</p><p>The feeling of a Raging Element pulled Renato out of his daze as the ominous sound of a bike met his ears.</p><p>He smirked, pulling down his fedora and pulling in his Sun Flames, stepping onto the train calmly, watching as a bike screeched to a stop.</p><p>He tossed the mirror up in the air lazily as the train pulled off, winking at the man.</p><p>~:~</p><p>Skull growled. “Where is that train headed?” His glare at the woman made her stutter, but eventually Skull got the answer.</p><p>Skull considered his options as the woman babbled on about where the train was going.</p><p>This was going to be a harder stunt… But if he used the camera on his bike and his helmet, he could connect to the ring.</p><p>He grinned and sat on his bike, pushing the camera on and revving his bike.</p><p>“Here we go!”</p><p>~:~</p><p>“<em>Please welcome the live viewing – rare as it is – of the Immortal Skull!”</em></p><p>
  <em>A crowd roared with delight as two screens came on.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Sorry I can’t be there in person, folks. Someone kinda pissed me off – this viewing will be short but it’ll leave ya satisfied!” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The camera jumped, thudding on a track. The purple eyes that people rarely got to see up close glimmered with anger and amusement before it switched to an outside view – of a departing train.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“There’s the train I’m following.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The bike kept going forward, but Skull twisted around and showed a train behind him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Let’s see if I can’t outrun this train, huh?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Skull laughed, wild and free.</em>
</p><p>~:~</p><p>Skull raced down the track, feeling for that energy.</p><p>The trail started on another platform, so Skull had to wrench himself off and rev his bike, people clearing a path for him. Skull executed an amazing flip, wincing a bit as he felt the seat slam into him harshly underneath, and sped up the railing, following that energy until he was out, squealing to a stop.</p><p>“Show’s over, folks, got a guy to catch!” he announced to the cameras, shutting off both of them before racing off.</p><p>Taking a glance at his gas gauge, he swore to himself and sped into a gas station, flinging euros at the man, stating his pump number and pumping the gas into his baby. Before ten minutes had passed, Skull was gone again, speeding so fast no law enforcement had a chance in hell of catching him.</p><p>The trail stopped, the strange energy nearly suffocating Skull.</p><p>Skull looked around, taking off his helmet to look.</p><p>
  <em>Mistake.</em>
</p><p>His sense of alarm made him growl in frustration, readying himself to put his helmet on.</p><p>He fell backwards in the grass, eyes glazed over in a faux impression of death. Honestly, his eyes had just stopped working for the moment (well, most of his body had, anyway) because of the bullet easing itself out of his brain.</p><p>He slipped into unconsciousness anyway, unaware that the same man who’d shot him was standing over him, an interested light in his eyes.</p>
