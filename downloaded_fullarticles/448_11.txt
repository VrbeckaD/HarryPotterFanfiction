    <p>It was late at night and a light drizzle fell on Harry’s face as he made his way across the muddy Quidditch patch towards the locker rooms. He’d been flying for hours and enjoyed the easy happiness that came with exhaustion. Quidditch was one of the best things about returning to Hogwarts for an eighth year. Eighth years weren’t allowed to join the house teams, of course, but the friendly match with some Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws tonight was more than enough.</p><p>He flung open the door to the Gryffindor locker rooms, shook the rain out of his hair and began stripping out of his gear. He had continued with several rounds of finding the snitch after the others had retired for the night, so he was glad to find the locker room empty. He was about to pull his T-Shirt over his head when he realized he wasn’t alone.</p><p>“Malfoy!” Harry exclaimed. He had stupidly left his wand in his Quidditch uniform that lay on a nearby bench in a wet pile. It would take him way to long to arm himself if he needed to.</p><p>“Evening, Potter.”</p><p>“This is the Gryffindor locker room,” he pointed out, firmly pulling his T-Shirt down again to cover himself up.</p><p>“Yes, I am aware of that,” the Slytherin replied dryly. He was in the process of putting his school robes on, but didn’t seem embarrassed at all to face Harry with only black trousers on, his shirtless torso completely exposed. Harry stared, dumbfounded. Seeing so much of Malfoy’s skin was… strange. It shone creamy white in the warm glow of the locker room’s magical torches. The pale gauntness Harry had noticed in his features at Malfoy Manor last year was gone, replaced by a healthy color and sinewy muscles. In fact, his body looked positively flawless, except for several scars that ran the length of his chest.</p><p>“Admiring your handiwork, Potter?”</p><p>Harry felt the flush in his cheeks coming – from shame at what he had done. And maybe also for staring at Malfoy this way? Either way, he needed to say something – and quickly – so he blurted out the first excuse that came to mind.</p><p>“I just noticed…” Harry began stammering, “…your hair looks different.”</p><p>“Grooming spells are difficult without a wand – not that you would know. But I suppose I should be grateful I have the Savior of the Wizarding World here to point out when I don’t look my best.”</p><p>Malfoy shot him an annoyed look and turned away to slip into his shirt.</p><p>“No, it looks better on you this way. Less…”</p><p>Malfoy turned to face him again and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Awkward silence ensued.</p><p>“Well, this was educational,” Malfoy replied coolly. “Not all of us have the luxury of leading the busy and important life you do, Potter, but even I have better things to do than endure fashion advice from someone who clearly gets his hair cut by a troll.”</p><p>Maybe it was the good mood that playing Quidditch had put him in, but Harry couldn’t help it. He burst out laughing in spite of himself.</p><p>Malfoy grabbed his things and left, turning only to give Harry a confused look.</p>
