<p>        Ruby made her way down the train platform, duffle bag slung over her shoulder, re-reading the ticket in her hand to make sure she caught the number correctly.</p>
<p>        “Yeah, 9 ¾, it says right here.” she stated, dumbfounded to her family.</p>
<p>        “What? No way!” her sister Carmine exclaimed, trying to snatch the ticket out of Ruby’s hand. Ruby pulled it away as Carmine nearly knocked them both over in an attempt to get the ticket.</p>
<p>        “Why don’t we just ask for directions?” her other sister, Scarlet, asked. “This school has apparently been around for centuries, so someone around here has got to know something about how to actually <em>get</em> there.” She began to look around for anyone who seemed like a person of authority. She proceeded to snatch the ticket from Ruby’s hand, and run to the conductor who was just finished giving directions to an elderly couple.</p>
<p>        “Umm… Excuse me! Would you have any idea where we could find platform 9 ¾?” Scarlet asked. The conductor turned to her, his expression seeming frustrated.</p>
<p>        “Listen kid. I don’t know if you guys are in some sort of elaborate flash mob or something, because you are just about the 20th person to ask me that today. Now I’ve worked at this station for 10 years, and I can tell you <em>for a fact</em> that there is not, and has never been, a platform 9 ¾. Now please let me do my job.” He turned away from the shocked girl and she heard him mutter under his breath “I swear, I go through the same thing every year” Scarlet turned and sulked back to her family.</p>
<p>        “Chin up dearies,” the triplets’ mother said. “We’ll find it sooner or later.” She paused, tapping her toes and putting her finger on her cheek as if thinking deeply about their next course of action. “Well I say we ought to go to platforms 9 and 10, and see where to go from there” she announced finally, beginning to march in the direction of the platforms with the cart of Ruby’s new belongings.</p>
<p>        The last few weeks have been an absolute whirlwind for Ruby. A little while back she was preparing for a new year at her regular old person school, buying clothes, pens, binders, and other usual school things, when one morning a slightly shorter than average, brown haired man in a long robe knocked on their house. His hair was cut fairly short, and he had a rather long nose. His movements were over exaggerated, and his speech had a slightly forced theatrical tone to it. He explained to the family that magic was real, and that Ruby was a witch who had been accepted into a special wizarding school. Ruby had always noticed little strange things happening around her in the past, like doors slamming on their own, and ice cream melting almost instantly when she was upset, but she knew better than to label these things as <em>magic</em>, she wasn’t crazy! And yet here this man was, saying (rather overdramatically, even considering what he was talking about) that all this time she was gifted, and could do things than some people can only dream of doing.</p>
<p>        The man gave them a letter from the supposed “school”, and left stating that he was one of the teachers there, and that he hoped to see Ruby in his class. The letter contained information about various strange items, and equipment that was required for the school. The man had also left a note with directions on getting to a place where they could actually buy all of these things, much to the relief of Ruby’s mother, who hadn’t had a single clue on to where she could purchase dragon hide gloves.</p>
<p>        The trip to Diagon Alley was even more exciting. Although they had mostly believed the man about the wizarding world, it was different to actually be in it. The constant hustle and bustle of the crowded streets, people with wands in long robes walking frantically from store to store. Even Ruby’s sisters, who were originally quite jealous of Ruby’s new-found abilities, seemed to have a great time. Thankfully there had been people to give directions to all the clueless muggle parents, and they managed to get all of Ruby’s equipment and books within a few hours. Ruby’s favourite addition to her school supplies had been a green toad that she named Cornelius. She hadn’t totally understood what the purpose of every student having a pet was, but she wasn’t about to complain.</p>
<p>        The lost muggle family continued their way down the platform until they finally reached platforms 9 and 10. Ruby’s mom stopped and looked at the two signs. There was no sign in between them that read “platform 9 ¾”, and no arrow or direction anywhere around that would indicate where that platform might be.</p>
<p>        “Well… Now what?” Ruby pondered aloud. She began to worry that the train would leave long before she even managed to find it.</p>
<p>        “You know maybe this platform doesn’t even exist! Maybe this has all bee some sort of elaborate trick!” Carmine exclaimed angrily. Likely agitated from all of the walking around in crowded places that the family had done in the last few days.</p>
<p>        “It’s got to be here somewhere,” their mom said uncertainly. Glancing around frantically, looking for something or someone to help them.</p>
<p>        “Hey there! Are you guys looking for Hogwarts?” A voice came from behind them, startling Ruby. They all turned around to see a short chubby girl with a suitcase looking at them. She had long messy hair that covered one eye, and was wearing what seemed to be a Hogwarts uniform just like the one that Ruby had bought days before,</p>
<p>        “Umm… yeah! Ar– umm… D-Do you know how we can get to platform 9 ¾?” Ruby asked nervously.</p>
<p>        “Yeah! Come over here, I’m gonna show you something really cool!!” The girl nearly shouted as she grabbed Ruby’s arm and dragged her to the pillar with the signs for platforms 9 and 10 on it. “This is gonna blow your mind” She exclaimed, smiling wildly and excitedly. She turned towards a wall of the post, and without warning began racing straight for the wall of the pillar. Before Ruby could even process what was happening, the girl had vanished! The family stood totally still for a minute, blinking to try and process what had just happened, when suddenly the girl’s head popped through the wall.</p>
<p>        “Isn’t it cool? Come on, follow me! The train’s in here!” She called. The family didn’t budge, and just continued to stare in wonder. “Don’t worry, it’s <em>magic</em>” she smirked and popped her head back into the pillar. Ruby slowly began approaching the wall, and wearily tried to pass through it, squinting her eyes as she got close. She felt someone tap her shoulder and jumped slightly at the sensation. “You can open your eyes now, you’re here” she heard. Ruby obeyed and almost fell down from shock when she saw that an entirely new platform had appeared from out of nowhere, with a train and everything! She turned around to see that the rest of her family had followed her in, and all had the same exact reaction to her. She looked over at the girl that she had met who was grinning wildly at their excitement.</p>
<p>        “I’m Amethyst!” She said, reaching out her hand.</p>
<p>        “…Ruby” Ruby responded, shaking Amethyst’s hand. The group made their way to the train, and Amethyst helped direct them to where they unloaded their things, and the entrance to the First Years’ compartment.</p>
<p>        “Thank you so much for this Amethyst!” Ruby’s mom chimed. “I’m so glad we came across someone who knows about these things!”</p>
<p>        “Wait a minute… How <em>do</em> you know so much about this! It’s your first year, just like Ruby’s! Did they give you a special book that they didn’t give us?” Carmine questioned.</p>
<p>        “Oh, my sister is a second year, so I’ve seen all of this last year.” Amethyst replied.</p>
<p>        “Where is your family by the way?” Ruby’s mom asked, sounding slightly concerned. Amethyst scowled for a moment, then shook her head slightly and smiled her excided smile again.</p>
<p>        “I had to do something, so they went ahead. My sister’s probably already on the train by now.” She explained, gesturing to the second year compartment. “Anyway, we should probably get going if we want to get good seats!”</p>
<p>        Ruby nodded, excitement starting to fill her. She turned and said her goodbyes to her family, then followed Amethyst onto the train.</p>
<p>        “Oh sweet! And empty room!” Amethyst exclaimed, tossing her bag onto the shelf with ease. Ruby followed her lead, and put her duffle bag on the shelf above her, and relaxing into her seat. She had taken Cornelius with her into the train because she thought that he would get stressed with all of the luggage, and he was currently sitting comfortably in her sweater pocket. She reached her hand in and began to pet him.</p>
<p>        “So… Ruby right? Are you excited for your first year at Hogwarts!? I know I am! I can’t wait for defence against the dark arts classes, and transfigurations! I wanna learn to be an animagus! Wouldn’t that be the coolest? What house do you want to get into?” Amethyst started rambling excitedly. Ruby stared, trying to process what had just been said.</p>
<p>        “H-House?” She clarified.</p>
<p>        “Yeah, you know, what Hogwarts house do you want to be in?” Amethyst repeated.</p>
<p>        “Well… I’ve heard a little bit <em>about</em> the houses, but I don’t really know that much.” Ruby said apologetically.</p>
<p>        “Oh! Well they all have special qualities that make them different! Gryffindor is the brave one, Ravenclaw is the smart one, Slytherin is the cunning one, and Hufflepuff is the nice one! Everyone gets sorted into a house by the sorting hat as soon as they get to hogwarts!” Amethyst stated, looking back at Ruby for an answer.</p>
<p>        <em>Sorting hat??</em> Ruby thought. She decided that asking too many questions would become overwhelming, and that she would find out in due time. “Oh… umm… well… they all seem like really good qualities, so I don’t really care.”</p>
<p><em>        </em> “That’s fine! I don’t really know either!” Amethyst paused for a minute, seemingly deep in thought, but she snapped out of it, and went back to telling Ruby about the different magical aspects of Hogwarts. Ruby’s stomach dropped a little at the idea of constantly moving staircases, but the feeling was overcome with sheer excitement of all the other incredible things that Amethyst described excitedly.</p>
<p>        The pair continued to engage in conversation, and didn’t even notice that the train had left the station until a gentle knock came from their compartment door. It slid open to reveal a girl with long wavy hair. She wore an expensive looking cape, the hood of which was pulled down to partially conceal her face. Her mouth was stern, and emotionless. She was holding a brand shiny new old-style suitcase.</p>
<p>        “Is there room here for one more?” she asked. Her voice was smooth, and her accent eloquent. Ruby stared dumbfounded. The girl was very rich, or at least seemed to be.</p>
<p>        “Yeah sure come on in!” Amethyst smiled, and motioned for her to enter. The girl slid into the room gracefully, and gently closed the door. She hid her suitcase under an empty seat, and sat down beside ruby. Even her movements seemed pristine. Every move seemed calculated. They sat in silence for a minute when suddenly a white Persian cat leaped out from underneath the new girl’s cape, and onto Ruby’s lap. Ruby jumped slightly, and then almost flew out of her seat when a startled Cornelius hopped out of her pocket. She caught him before he could get away, and held him out of reach of the cat, who was now scrambling up Ruby to try and catch the toad.</p>
<p>        “I am so sorry!” The girl exclaimed, pealing the cat off of Ruby. “I have no idea why he did that! Is your toad okay!?!” She turned towards Ruby, her expression concerned.</p>
<p>After shaking herself slightly from the events that just took place, Ruby smirked “Oh Cornelius if fine! He can withstand anything!” She turned to the girl’s cat “They probably just got off on the wrong foot–or umm… <em> paw </em>. Why don’t I try a new introduction? This is Sir Cornelius III esquire, and what might I ask is this good feline’s name?” She looked at the girl questioningly.</p>
<p>        “Oh… umm… well I never really got the chance to name him… My parents just bought him for me, and I’m not that good at naming things.” She turned her head to the ground. Her hood had fallen off, but her bangs still covered her eyes completely, so it was hard to tell exactly what she was thinking.</p>
<p>        “Well why don’t I help you name him then?” Ruby asked, excitedly. “I love naming things! Hmm… How about Pat. Pat the Cat.” She smirked, waiting for a reaction. The girl turned towards her and looked puzzled for a moment, then a look of understanding hit her face, and she burst out laughing. Her laugh was crystal clear like the chime of bells, and her teeth were white as snow. Ruby was stunned, and really glad that she was the cause of that laugh. She turned to see that Amethyst was laughing too.</p>
<p>        “That’s a good one!” she giggled. The new girl finally calmed down, and turned back to Ruby.</p>
<p>        “Pat the Cat it is then.” She smiled widely. Looking down and patting the Persian’s head gently. Ruby breathed in to speak, but then realized that she had forgotten something.</p>
<p>        “Well, now that we’ve decided on the cat’s name, any chance we can get yours?” she asked. The girl’s face warped for a minute, and she seemed nervous.</p>
<p>        “Uh… Sapphire.” She finally said. Turning to watch the others’ reaction in anticipation.</p>
<p>        “Cool! Nice to meet you Sapphire! I’m Ruby and this is Amethyst”</p>
<p>        “Sup.” Amethyst said from her lounging position on her seat.</p>
<p>        “It’s nice to meet you to.” Sapphire said smiling, clearly relieved. The group fell into a comfortable conversation about their excitements of the new school, and Ruby began to feel more and more at home already.</p>
