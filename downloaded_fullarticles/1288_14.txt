    <p>            Jieun Min had long since left her family in Korea for a better life in Europe. She had spent years traveling only to settle down in Brighton along the coast. Not long after, she had received word that she had a nephew. <em>The poor boy</em> she thought, having grown up with her brother she knew first-hand how cruel he could be. There had also been whispers of the Dark Lord stirring, his followers becoming bolder. She knew the little boy would be raised in a household of hate and she wished she could help. As the years passed she found herself thinking about the boy more and more, she wanted to help the boy, show him that the world is not full of hate as he probably sees it, as she saw it. So imagine her surprise when two ministry officials had shown up at her door asking if she would take in the small 9-year-old boy. She had easily agreed, although she had been slightly nervous to accept the boy. Her brother was not a kind man, most of their family weren’t kind, and she was worried her nephew would be the same. However, she was pleasantly surprised when she went to pick up her nephew.</p>
<p>             <strike>Min Yoongi </strike>Yoongi Min was a small boy with soft eyes and petite frame, she almost couldn’t believe he was 9 he looked no older than 7. He was also very polite for a boy his age, always managing to say please or thank you. Old worries about a hateful little wizard had flown out the window, only to be replaced with different worries. Anytime she went to touch him, rather it was to hug him or just a pat to the head, he flinched away. He also had nightmares, bad ones where he would wake up screaming and begging for something to stop. What had her brother done to this boy, his own child? It would take Yoongi years before he would open up to his aunt and when he did she had been truly horrified.</p>
<p>             Min Yoongi was quite different from his parents. Rather than picking apart minds, he’d pick flowers, rather than torturing he liked to play make-believe, rather than being full of hate he was full of love, the list of differences went on and on. If he didn’t look like a perfect combination of his father and mother one would doubt he was a Min, to begin with. Because of this Min Yoongi’s parents didn’t love him, sometimes they had a hard time liking him as well. It wasn’t the boy’s fault, not really, his parents were just incapable of love. Of course, Yoongi didn’t know this, all he knew was that his parents were not afraid to make him behave by any means necessary. Despite this, Yoongi still loved his parents, what child didn’t?</p>
<p>            He was very young during the Second Wizarding War, he hadn’t understood why so many wizards had met in his house nor why they had skulls on their arms. He hadn’t been frightened of them necessarily, most of them were family anyway. What did scare him though were the <strike>noises</strike> screams, which he had been told later on were the muggles his parents had captured.</p>
<p>            He hadn’t understood a lot of things that happened during the war until much later. The first time he had even heard the word <em>Deatheater</em> was during the trials. It had been decided the trials would take place in Britain, seeing as they were recovering much better than the Korean Ministry which was still entrenched with Deatheaters. They lasted 2 long years and ended with his parents in Azkaban and him in the custody of an estranged aunt. During those 2 long years he and his parents, along with a few other notable death eaters, had been plastered on every single newspaper and magazine in the wizarding world. After his parents’ convictions he had been, for the most part, left alone and able to adjust to his new life with his aunt. At first, he had been frightened to meet his aunt, having no idea what she might be like, he hoped she would be unlike his father. And to his delight he found his aunt was very much unlike his father, she was the sweetest, most loving woman he had ever met. She cared for him in a way his parents had never bothered to. He could still remember first meeting her.</p>
<p align="center">~~~</p>
<p>
  <em>            The ministry officials, the ones that had been designated to him during the trials, were leading him out of the small room he had been sitting in while waiting for his mysterious aunt. Neither of his parents had ever spoken of her, though that probably happens when you become estranged, and he was afraid of what she would be like. Would she be scary like his mother, with cold eyes and an unforgiving face? Or unnecessarily cruel like his father, wasn’t she his sister after all?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>            Mr. Kim, one of the officials, gently placed a hand on his back, ignoring the flinch that came from the boy, and gently ushered him on. He was being led into a room that reminded him of the waiting room in the doctor’s office. The plastic chairs and white walls unnerved him, it even smelled like antiseptic in the room.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>It was clear his aunt wasn’t here yet, seeing as they were the only ones in the room, so one of the officials gently pushed him towards a seat. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Stay here Kim, I’ll get the paperwork,” Mr. Park ordered gruffly. Mr. Kim just nodded in response and took a seat beside Yoongi. </em>
</p>
<p><em>“I have a son about your age,” Yoongi jumps as the man’s loud voice echoes around the room. The man places a hand on his shoulder and Yoongi flinches. He retracts his hand with sympathetic eyes. “Sorry, I just… If you ever need a friend I’m sure he’d be willing. He’s a smart boy, he’ll be going to Hogwarts about the same time you will. Probably’ll be Ravenclaw that one, he’s too smart for his own good.” The man’s eyes shine with pride and Yoongi feels a tug at his heart, why did his father never look like that when talking about him? </em>Because he didn’t love you<em>, a voice whispers and Yoongi looks down ashamed. He wasn’t even good enough for his parents’ love. Realizing the boy wasn’t going to say anything Mr. Kim continued, “Well if you do go to Hogwarts find him, won’t you? His name is Namjoon, Namjoon Kim.”</em></p>
<p>
  <em>           Before he could respond the doors burst open once again and in came a middle-aged woman. She was short, with gray streaks in her hair and paint on her hands and clothes. Despite her frantic state, Yoongi could see the softness to her. Her eyes weren’t hardened, her cheeks were rounded out, and she smiled, this was his aunt? How? All the Mins he knew were punctual, hardened, and cruel. This lady was the opposite of his father. If not for the standard Min cat-like eyes and a gummy smile, which his father sported after coming up from the dungeons, he would’ve doubted she and his father were related. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Sorry, I’m late I forgot my bag that had all the papers in it so I had to go back to get it. I’m not usually this frazzled I swear! Just woke up late this morning and it threw off my whole day,” she spoke so fast it made Yoongi feel out of breath. “Anyway, I was told there was one more paper to sign and then we can go home?” <strong>Home</strong> that was a word he hadn’t heard in a long time, he recalled having referred to his house in Korea as the manor. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“That’s correct, my associate Mr. Park is bringing it in shortly,” as he finished the sentence, the doors opened and said man stepped back into the room, “Ah perfect timing Mr. Park this is Miss Jieun, she’s ready to fill out the remaining paperwork.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Wonderful, we just need a signature here, here, and here. Oh, and initials here please.” He chirps, noticeably more pleasant to the woman than he’d been to Yoongi a few minutes prior. Mr. Park reads over the paper again before handing it over to Mr. Kim to make sure everything had been filled out accordingly. At Mr. Kim’s nod, Mr. Park took the paper and disapparated. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Very well, it seems our time together was rather short-lived Mr. Min. Don’t fret I’m still your case officer so I will come around every few months to make sure everything is going smoothly. Of course, after a few years, it’ll become less frequent until it reaches the yearly visits and those will continue until he’s 18.” It took Yoongi a moment to realize that Mr. Kim was no longer speaking to him, but his aunt instead. After a beat of silence, he started again, “Well that’s it really. I’ll escort you out.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“No, that’s not necessary Mr. Kim. I found my way in, I’m certain I can find our way out. You must have other cases, don’t worry about us.” His aunt gave said man a firm smile. The longer Yoongi stared the more he saw his father in her. They had the same nose and cat-like eyes, the same stern stance, and the same smile they flashed when they knew they were about to get what they wanted.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Ah, well okay. If you’re certain you can find your way out.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>            And after a few more words reassuring Mr. Kim that they could indeed escort themselves out, they left. It was the first time since the trials started that he wasn’t with a member of some government and it felt weird, freeing but at the same time disconcerting. He knew he wasn’t a danger nor in danger but he couldn’t shake the feeling of dread.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>            As they approached the car, Yoongi couldn’t help but gape, sure it had taken a while for him to get used to muggle ways of transportation but this car was nothing like the sleek, expensive ministry cars he was used to. This was a beat up, rust covered, light blue(though it was hard to tell with all the rust) car. Yoongi couldn’t help but doubt if the thing would even turn on. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Sorry about the car, I don’t get to drive the bug as often as I’d like. Anyway, get in we’re going home.” There was that word again, home, would he actually find a home here? “Come on kid, you think too much. I can practically hear your thoughts from here!’’ She laughed and Yoongi decided he liked her laugh. It was high and sharp, like a whistle, and faded into a wheeze, he couldn’t help the smile that crawled across his face. He reached for the door handle and gave it a tug when the door wouldn’t open he pulled a little harder but it still didn’t budge. Annoyed, he gave it another firm yank and the handle flew right off. Gaping in horror as he stared at the dismembered handle in his palm. He heard his aunt coming around the car and tensed, waiting for the yelling to start, only to relax when he heard the laughter again. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Reparo!” his aunt mumbled and the handle flew out of his hand and back onto the car, “Be gentle next time, kid, she’s fragile,” she tutted, except the scold had no malice. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>This time Yoongi gently tugged on the door for it to fly open with a puff of dust. Coughing, Yoongi sat down and shut the door, it creaked all the way shut. The interior was not much better than the outside. Everything had a film of dust over it, except the driver’s seat and steering wheel, and the seats were torn in some places. Yoongi could’ve sworn he heard squeaking when he sat down. As unpleasant as the car was it still had this charm, the feathered dream catcher around the mirror and the postcards of tropical islands on the dash giving it a homely feel. He felt oddly comfortable, despite the spring jabbing him in the back. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The drive was long, they had long left the city behind and were traveling through miles of farmland. Where did his aunt even live? Besides the silence that crept into the car, suffocating him, the ride was going smoothly. He had learned that despite not inheriting the family’s tendencies toward evil they both shared a familiar tendency towards silence. His aunt hadn’t said a word to him since the whole door handle escapade and he was perfectly content with not needing to provide answers. Although he did have some questions he was dying to ask. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Come on kid, it’s been over an hour and you haven’t said anything. You’ve got to have some questions for me.” Yoongi was startled out of his daze, a little shocked at her bluntness, he turned to her with big eyes. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I- are you sure? I don’t want to be rude.” He spoke softly.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Don’t worry kid, I don’t get offended easily. Us Mins have thick skin.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Why are we driving to your house? Couldn’t we have apparated or used the floo network?” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Our home has strong anti-apparation wards and isn’t connected to the floo network for our safety. We wouldn’t want some wacko to find out where we live and try to damage the house or worse in the name of revenge. Now I know you have something else on your mind so go on, ask away!”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Okay well, I was wondering what happened that made you, you know…?”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Made me say fuck you to our family? Well, have you seen their wardrobe? Like seriously black polyester, what are they bat wannabes? Hot and uncomfortable is what they are, explains their bad attitudes if you ask me. Second, your father is a real dick, in case you hadn’t realized,” Yoongi couldn’t help but giggle at his aunt’s explanation, it was all true. “There was an argument yadda, yadda, yadda. Lots of disownment and in the end I left without looking back. Though I can’t say I regret anything, that family is toxic.” And Yoongi couldn’t agree more, he hadn’t realized it at the time but looking back it probably wasn’t the best to raise your son around You-Know-Who and his most loyal. They continued their trip in silence, though this time it was a comfortable one. Yoongi was grateful that his aunt was treating him as an adult, everyone else had walked on eggshells around him, always treating him as if he was a child who hadn’t been forced to watch his parents be arrested and charged. Like he hadn’t sat in the courtroom and heard the testimonies, the awful things his parents did. He might only be 9 but he grew up fast, it was his only choice. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Not long after their conversation, his aunt pulled onto a dirt road. As they reached the end Yoongi saw a small house. It was a large contrast to the manor but he thinks he prefers this house much more. Gone were the large grey walls and dark windows. Instead, his aunt’s house was only one story, painted white with blue trim and a matching blue door. There were seashells, rocks, and wind chimes everywhere. From where is he was standing next to the car he could make out two rocking chairs and a swing sitting on the porch. As they got closer he could hear the sound of waves. Looking past the house he gasped, he could see the ocean! He had never been this close to the ocean, he could even smell the salt in the air. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Come on Yoongi, let’s go inside. It looks like it’s about to rain.” And sure enough, when Yoongi looked up the sky was covered in heavy, grey clouds. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">~~~</p>
<p>            Yoongi had been so sweet and shy those first months, always apologizing for silly things or asking before he could use anything. It was endearing but also frightening, Jieun was afraid of what her brother did to the small boy. But with time the boy grew and became more comfortable, opening up about his life prior to the trials. They talked for hours about that life, so distant it almost didn’t seem real, like a bad dream. When Yoongi had enough talking for one day they would turn on the TV and watch reruns of game shows yelling out the answers when they could. Speaking of the TV, Jieun owned a lot of muggle tools which Yoongi was assimilating to. At first, Yoongi didn’t understand why she had them and when he had asked her why she needed them she replied with a stern, “Wizarding technologies are not always superior to muggle technology.” Over time he learned this was true; it was much easier to use a phone instead of an owl or take a car instead of using the floo network, which was overly complicated and often a little too finicky about pronunciation.</p>
<p>             But now he was almost 11 and recently received his acceptance letter to Hogwarts, his aunt was wary to see him go seeing as she knew how cruel children could be but she knew she couldn’t hold onto him forever. Yoongi was already small for his age and the son of two prominent deatheaters, he would have a lot to prove. She knew it was unfair for them to judge him, Yoongi was the sweetest boy she had ever known and nothing like his parents, but she also knew Yoongi needed to get a handle on his powers. Just yesterday he caused a small hurricane because he couldn’t find his headphones.</p>
<p>             Yoongi, on the other hand, desperately didn’t want to go to Hogwarts, he wanted to stay in the safety of his aunt’s small beach house. He had lived there for a little over two years and it had been the best few years of his life. His aunt loved him more than his parents ever could have, she treated him like her own son. He would be forever grateful for her love but despite her love for him, people still saw him as the son of deatheaters. He could still see the glares when they went to Diagon Alley or the whispers when they visited any of Jieun’s friends. He didn’t doubt for a second that Hogwarts would be any different. But after the whole hurricane incident, which totally wasn’t his fault, by the way, he realized he needed to get control over his magic before he hurt anyone, and if Hogwarts can do that then so be it. </p>
<p>             Yoongi knew his aunt wasn’t a fan of him attending Hogwarts either, but they both understood the necessity of the situation. So, there they sat at the dinner table eating the kimchi stew his aunt made him as a last meal. They had gone to Diagon Alley earlier that day to get the necessary materials for his first year at Hogwarts. While there a man had come up to Yoongi and spit on his shoes, a testament to how little the wizarding world changed since the wars ended. The boy had just stood there stunned, it wasn’t every day that a grown man spit on you. Instead of reacting, however, he just straightened his back and kept walking. His aunt was proud. He would learn to endure, he would have to.</p>
