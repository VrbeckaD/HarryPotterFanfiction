    <p>Harry screamed.  Maybe it more a roar than a scream.  He wasn’t sure he was in pain, but it was definitely more intense than anything he had ever experienced in his ass, and the whole thing felt a lot more tolerable when he made whatever noises he was making.  Hot-cold waves washed over his skin. Sweat pooled against the leather sling and more sweat rolled off him to form small puddles on the floor.</p><p> Maurus held Harry’s head tight against his chest with gauntleted hands, occasionally stroking his face or hair, sometimes putting a palm or fingers gently against Harry’s lips so he could lick or suck at them.  And down below, at his ass, Severus head was framed by the upturned V of Harry’s thighs, scowling in concentration as he slowly and methodically worked Harry’s ass open.</p><p>It was Harry’s first attempt at fisting, and both Severus and Maurus had warned him before he climbed up into that sling that he might not be able to take it all today.  At this point they had been at it for over an hour, and Harry had gone from biting his lips nervously, head up and eyes wide open to watch as Severus worked more and more lube up his ass, to roaring, screaming, and panting with his head dangling back against Maurus and his eyes squeezed tightly shut.  As Severus drew back a little, he saw a faint pink tinge to the lube on his hand and knew they had gone as far as they could for now.  He held up his hand to show Maurus, who whispered gently into Harry’s ear.  “We’re going to take a break, Harry.”</p><p>Harry opened his eyes, confused, and looked down at Severus, who had one hand on each of Harry’s thighs as he stood between him.  “Please don’t stop, Sir,” Harry gasped out, “I’m okay.  Totally okay.  I’m sorry I’m making so much noise.”</p><p>Severus shushed him, gently stroking the inside of his thigh with one hand, “It’s not the noise.  There’s a little blood.”</p><p>“No, I’m okay.  Please keep going,” Harry begged.</p><p>This time it was Maurus who shushed him, rubbing leather covered fingers through his hair and over his face.  “We can try again in a bit, Harry” Maurus rumbled close to his ear, his breath hot on Harry’s neck.  </p><p>“But I didn’t <em>say </em>to stop!” Harry exclaimed, pulling himself up in the sling to glare at Severus and Maurus.</p><p>“Not this again,” Maurus muttered, grabbing Harry just under his jaw and pushing him back down into the sling, not hard enough to choke, but firm enough to put the possibility in Harry’s mind.  Maurus gripped Harry’s throat a bit tighter for a second in warning, then let go.  Harry stayed put, closed his eyes and took a couple of deep breaths before opening them again.</p><p>“Sorry, Sir,” Harry said, relaxed once again into the sling and Maurus’ chest.  Severus pulled off wiped off his hands and arms, which were white with lube.  A few minutes later, seeing Harry was relaxed again, Severus went to wash and Maurus tidied up.  Once Harry was steady, they walked him to the bed and lay down together, Maurus on one side and Severus on the other.  It wasn’t long before Harry fell asleep and the two older men slipped out of bed into the living room.</p><p> “Have you talked to Lee yet?  Regarding joining our family?”  Severus poured out the last of the Bourbon, splitting it evenly between Maurus and himself before joining him on the sofa.</p><p>Maurus accepted the rocks glass, warming it in the palm of one hand for a moment before taking a grateful sip.  “He’s hesitant,” he finally said before taking his next sip and speaking again.  “He thinks it’s been too short a time since Master died, and is worried this would be a rebound relationship.  He is also not sure, once I get out my pent up top energy, if I’ll want to stay in that role or go back to being a slave.”</p><p>“And you?  What do you think?”</p><p>“I grieve Master, of course.  I’m positive, though, I can’t go that far under for anyone else.  I was a top before I met him.  Hell, I never even switched, if you don’t count the bottoming you do when you’re trying to learn a new skill.”</p><p>Severus gave half a grin.  “I remember.  You would never have noticed me, but I remember admiring you.  I used to fantasize you would notice me and beat the shit out of me.”</p><p>Maurus laughed.  “I could still beat the shit out of you, if you’d like.”</p><p>Severus looked down into the brown amber liquid remaining in his glass for a moment before taking a pensive sip.  “I think I’d like that, sometime.  I like being king of the hill here, but sometimes… well, sometimes I’d like to be on the receiving end of all that energy.  I’m a pretty heavy masochist when I get in the mood.”</p><p>“We should arrange it sometime, then.  What do you think you might be into these days?”</p><p>“I’ll have to think about it.  I wouldn’t mind some heavy humiliation with a good dose of pain, but we need to think ahead to our possible future relationship.”</p><p>“I’m not sure I could do a heavy humiliation scene with you, anyway.  We can stick with a pain trip.”</p><p>“I’m a little old school.  I like my top to be in charge, and for me it’s important to give up control.  No scat, bloodplay, permanent marks, any marks on my face or hand and, like we said, no heavy humiliation… although I do like the usual forms so we both know the roles we’ve taken, kneeling and such.  Within those bounds, though, I prefer an enthusiastic top to a carefully negotiated scene.”</p><p>“How do you feel about accidental blood or marks?”</p><p>Severus looked him in the eyes.  Maurus was thinking of something particular, he could tell.  “I’m okay with that.  You’ll see.  I’m not exactly a blank canvas.  I just don’t want to be branded, tattooed, or anything like that.  But I won’t be upset if you cane me and my skin breaks or if you whip me and accidentally cut too deep.”</p><p>Maurus nodded his understanding.  “Safewords?”</p><p>“I’ll call you Maurus if I need to talk to you out of role.  Red if things need to stop immediately.”</p><p>“Then I’ll call you Severus if I need to speak to you out of role, and Red if I need things to stop immediately.  Sex?”</p><p>“If it pleases you,” Severus cast an evaluating glance down at his own body, which he once again noted left a lot to be desired.  Always had.</p><p>“It would certainly please me in general, but that night you’ll have to earn my cock.  I won’t promise you that you’ll get off, though, even if I do fuck you.”</p><p>Severus smiled.  <em>This will certainly be a nice change!</em>  “Good.”</p><p>They both sipped their bourbon, wrapped in their own thoughts for a bit, before Maurus spoke up again, losing the slight bantering tone that had carried them through their negotiation.  “I’m anxious to get away from Lee.  Not that he’s doing anything wrong or inappropriate or anything.  He just grates.”</p><p>“Lee tends to rub people the wrong way.”</p><p>“Will you let me come stay here without Lee’s okay?”</p><p>Severus thought for a long moment before speaking.  “What was the understanding between you before Joseph was cursed?”</p><p>“That I would stay with Lee for a year, or until he and I felt that I had found a good next step.”</p><p>“And you agreed to that arrangement?” </p><p>Maurus nodded.</p><p>“I trust Joseph’s judgement, generally speaking.  He thought Lee would take care of you after he was dead, and despite how annoying Lee can be…”</p><p>“I was the one who chose Lee, Severus,” Maurus interrupted, “And you were the other option.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you choose me?” Severus asked more in curiosity than offense.</p><p>“By reputation, you’re a rather harsh Master.  I had never met you.  Now I’ve lived with you, seen the way you treat your boys, the way you treated me.  You’re different than I expected.”</p><p>Severus sighed, then continued.  “At this point, I think Lee’s right.  I can’t have my family be your rebound – it’s too disruptive.  But you can be here as much as you like, you can play with my boys as long as they’re agreeable, although the same rules apply for Harry as before.  But for now, I want you to stay with Lee.  Make sure you still like us as you finish grieving.  Use the time to work out your relationship with Draco.  And explore other people – go to the clubs, the parties, whatever.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”  Maurus didn’t like it, but he’d have to bide his time until Lee agreed, or Severus changed his mind.</p><p> </p><p>Harry shifted a bit in his maroon wing-back chair, delighting in the delicious pain that shot through his ass when he hit the right angle, reminding him of Severus’ hand working his ass the night before.  Across his immaculate, mahogany desk sat Head Auror Robards and Auror Jackson.  Robards had the look of a man about to go before a firing squad and determined not to cringe before the bullets.  Jackson, on the other hand, was pale and tremulous.  Both had crossed Harry recently, and now Harry was Minister of Magic.  Neither expected to leave the room with their job.  They were worried about what else the enmity of the Minister would cost them.  Robards thought he could tolerate whatever loss Harry could exact.  Jackson wasn’t so sure.</p><p>“Gawain,” Harry started with a gentlemanly smile, delighted to rub Robards’ nose in his ascendancy, “Thank you for coming today.  I expect your resignation by the end of this meeting.”  Harry took out some parchment, a quill, and ink and pushed them toward Robards, who ground his teeth momentarily before picking up the quill. </p><p>Harry turned his attention to Jackson.  “Auror Jackson.”</p><p>“Yes, Sir.”</p><p>“Please brief me in full on your investigation into how the neo Death Eaters got the potion into the victims.”</p><p>A half hour later, Jackson had finished the briefing.  In short, they had very little.  The potion was so widely distributed through the magical population that it was nearly impossible to trace.  It appeared more likely that an antidote was being given selectively to neo Death Eater supporters rather than limiting the scope of initial exposure.</p><p>“Focus on finding a trace for the antidote,” Harry ordered once Jackson had wound down.  “You could try using the data set I gathered to start.  If you get blood samples, I am sure Severus Snape would be willing to run them for us.”</p><p>Jackson’s jaw dropped.</p><p>“Problem?” Harry asked, assuming Jackson objected to Severus working on the case.</p><p>“I… uh… Sir… Minister, I mean… well.”  Jackson stopped spluttering and took a deep breath.  “I assumed I was going to be asked for my resignation.”  He pulled a somewhat crumpled piece of parchment from a pocket.  “I wrote it, um, here.”  Jackson passed it across the desk.</p><p>Harry picked it up and glanced it over.  “Do you want to resign, Auror Jackson?”</p><p>“No.  No, sir.  I like being an Auror.  I know you and I…  Well, I’m sorry for what I said.  I know that hardly makes up for it.  I didn’t imagine you’d let me keep my job.”  Jackson finally trailed off, not knowing what else to say.</p><p>“I’ll keep your letter in my desk, Jackson.  You have your job at my whim.  Do you understand?”</p><p>“Yes, Sir.  Thank you, Sir.”</p><p>“Good boy.”</p><p>Jackson winced at the diminutive, then blanked his face.</p><p>“You’re dismissed.  Both of you.  I expect another report Friday, Jackson.  You had best make some progress.  Robards, my secretary will call for some Unspeakables to escort you from the building.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry exited the floo, knowing he needed to get his clothes off quickly, and not due to any external requirement; everyone would understand if it took him a few minutes to get undressed.  He needed to do it quickly because his head was in a space completely unsuited to a slave.  He had spent the day gloating over defeated enemies and building up his own friends.  Ron was now Head Auror.  He had tried to promote Hermione within the legal group, but she had asked to stay in her current position.  She preferred having close contact with the members of the Wizengamot and had her eyes set on a political career.  Perhaps most intriguing, he now had access to the most secret projects the Unspeakables were working on.  The first file he had picked at random turned out to be about musical resonances in the contrails of certain curses.  Less than useful, but proof of his power to read whatever he wanted in that most secretive of divisions.</p><p>He made it to the bedroom and ripped off his formal robes, hanging them hastily in the closet.  He had his trousers halfway off when he realized he had forgotten to remove his boots.  At that awkward moment, Severus strode through the door with his robes billowing behind him and an absolutely furious look on his face.  He didn’t even glance at Harry as he ripped his robes off, flinging them on the floor, ranting, “Fucking students!  How hard is it to count five drops of dragon’s blood!  Not three, not seven, <em>five fucking drops of dragon’s blood</em>!”</p><p>Harry dropped to his knees with his trousers still around his ankles, bowed his head, and crossed his hands behind his naked ass.</p><p>“Get up and get those clothes out of here,” Severus ordered harshly, gesturing to the robes he had just thrown on the floor as he continued to peel off layer after layer as quickly as he could.  Harry started to get up and was about to take a step when he remembered his ankles were tangled in his half-removed pants.  He sat down on the floor again to pull off his boots.  “I mean <em>now</em>, boy!” Severus growled.  The clothing on the floor started to emit a caustic vapor.  Harry abandoned pulling off the second boot, instead sliding one leg of his pants off over the foot he had managed to bare, then hurrying over to grab the discarded clothing and run it out of the bedroom. </p><p>He ran down the hall with his slacks around one leg and one boot on, thinking quickly about where to take the clothing.  Banishing was always chancy with an unknown solution.  Instead, he held his breath and ran to the lab, where there was a stone box, well warded to contain explosions, vapors, and the other sequelae of potioneering gone awry.  Slamming the top shut, he ran back to Severus, who was frantically daubing a potion Harry didn’t recognize to his hands and face.  “Are you okay?” Harry shouted.  “What do you need?  What should I do?”</p><p>Severus daubed one more spot, then rounded on Harry.  “What should you always do, slave?” He demanded.</p><p>Harry froze.  “You’re joking.  You’re clothes are releasing poisonous gas and your face is burning, and you’re worried about our fucking greeting protocol?”</p><p>“The situation,” Severus answered in an icy tone, “had resolved itself.  There was no need to storm back into my room and yell questions at me.”</p><p>“I can’t believe you’re serious!” Harry muttered, running a hand through his hair and turning to steady himself against the dresser while taking his other boot and pant leg off.</p><p>“Don’t you dare turn your back on me,” Severus spat.</p><p>“I’m trying to finish undressing so I can get back to our stupid greeting protocol.”</p><p>“Go to the work room and wait for me,” Severus growled, turning to his closet abruptly and roughly ripping a fresh set of robes down from a hanger.</p><p>Harry paused a moment, stunned at the direction the conversation had taken, before turning and stomping out.</p>
