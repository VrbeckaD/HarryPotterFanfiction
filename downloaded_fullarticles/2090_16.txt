    <p>The end of the war had been a mess, as many who had been freed hadn’t deserved it, neither had those wrongly imprisoned. Through it all, the question of where Harry Potter was to go after the death of his young parents was settled and answered long before the Potters had been betrayed. Though her duty wasn't to raise Harry Potter, Minerva McGonagall watched over him. She felt it was her duty to protect her student’s son when she herself failed them. Through reports from Ms Figg and daytime snooping in her Animagus form, Minerva had come to the realization she could do truly do nothing about Harry’s situation. If anyone had the power to remove Harry from the Dursley’s custody, it was Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>Dumbledore looked up from his papers as if he had been expecting her the whole time. "Ah, Minerva, I am glad to see you. What seems to be the issue?" He waved to a chair. He glanced at a painting on the wall of Cornelius Fudge who was nervously twiddling his thumbs. Dumbledore frowned and flicked his finger. A black curtain fell over Fudge’s face and was silenced before Fudge could react. The curtained portrait had sunk into the wall now, there was no way Fudge could overhear their conversation now.</p><p>McGonagall sat down after the portrait had been dealt with.  “We need to get him out, Albus. Harry Potter must leave the Dursleys.”</p><p>“How will you try it? I have given you my answer before.”</p><p>“This can't go on Albus. You know just as well as I do that the boy has been abused since the day he arrived. I have enough for a case here, more than I did a year ago. You could bring it up, or maybe Doge or Augusta…”</p><p>Dumbledore glanced at her before taking the thick manila folder. He fingered through the journal entries, the photographs through the bushes, all of it.</p><p>“The Aurors? They know about this?”</p><p>“You said not to.  I know in regular circumstances this wouldn’t hold up in court, but as it is, Albus…”</p><p>Dumbledore took off his glasses and folded his hands on the long desk. “I cannot help you, as I could not help you before or indeed as I want to help you. This information is simply not valid.</p><p>“If I were seen as a more conservatively-minded figure, it would be easy for me to sway some to vote in favor of moving a future peer from a Muggle household to a Wizarding one. If I were, for lack of a better phrase, less honorable, I would be able to coerce my constituency. However, as neither are feasible, the Wizengamot cannot help us.”</p><p>McGonagall stood. “Then I shall do it myself without your help, but first I’ll need the counter-charm to reverse-”</p><p>Dumbledore raised a hand. “Steady, Minerva. As you said,” he gestured to the evidence, “circumstances such as these force me to realize that it was a mistake to trust Petunia’s judgement or the idea of her stopping her husband. You are right, it cannot wait any longer.”</p><p>Minerva was relieved. But how was it that she had been so easy to sway him, when it had been nearly impossible before?</p><p>“Before you ask, yes. This is to do with the protections we spoke about. He is indeed still protected, but now that he is of schooling age, I am more confident in the plan.”</p><p>“And Fudge?”</p><p>“As always, will know nothing.”</p><p>“If he did somehow find out though about this however...”</p><p>“Then it’ll make our work somewhat of a triviality in the great game. Mr Potter must be moved from the Dursleys and Petunia returned to her proper self before… it becomes inconvenient.”</p><p><em> It’s always inconveniences that he’s worried about </em>, Minerva thought. Dumbledore smiled and nodded as if he heard every word. They could hear Fudge’s portrait shuffle irritably beneath the black curtain, though of course he could neither hear nor interact with the outside world. “Do Floo when you decide to come for tea.”</p><p>“Ah yes, I shall.” Dumbledore winked. He waved open the black curtain and hastily put back on the ring. As Minerva was leaving, Dumbledore took a bright red envelope from one of the drawers and began to write an address. He folded his hands as he sent the message by his owl. Soon Fudge’s letter would arrive, and he wanted to get this out of the way before he forced himself to answer it.</p><p> </p><p>Harry padded into the Dursley’s immaculate kitchen early that July morning, wiping the sleep out of the corners of his eyes. “The post’s here, Aunt Petunia,” he murmured.</p><p>He placed the letters on the side of the island before shuffling over to the coffee pot. It was as ritual as any that Petunia reviewed the mail, for sorting catalogues from magazines, personal letters from Vernon’s Grunning’s reports. Vernon sniffed and turned the page of the paper as his cup was filled with coffee. Thankless as ever, Vernon tapped his foot, waiting for his daily rashers. Dudley tripped Harry on his way to the table, though Harry had caught himself on the polished countertop by the door.</p><p>The rest of the morning went much the same, with Harry avoiding Dudley and Vernon ho-humming at the morning paper’s editorials on Terry Field’s imprisonment. He snapped his fingers as soon as Harry cleaned off the excess grease. Petunia handed Vernon his post, looking at the strange, square red letter addressed to her, attached to a letter addressed to her nephew.</p><p>“None of that boy, just bring them here!” Vernon roared. Harry fought off sleep as he brought the sausages. His hand shook, the tip of the grease-covered cloth brushing on Vernon’s morning suit. Vernon looked at the invisible mar of uncleanliness, unordinary fifth that his nephew had seen fit to give him, and immediately tore into him.</p><p>Petunia picked up the letter idly as she tried to ignore Vernon. She knew he was like that, and better Harry than Dudley or her. As soon as her unpolished nails touched the wax, the small scarlet letter rose into the air and contorted itself into a set of eyes and a mouth. Instead of screaming, as this particular letter ought to have been doing, it simply smiled and whispered into Petunia’s ear before disintegrating.</p><p> </p><p>Not far away, underneath the London Underground, Mafalda Hopkirk of the Improper Use of Magic Office was in dire need of a day off. For the past eleven years, wizarding families had loosened their standards when it came to casting magic in sensitive areas of Britain and so she had to send out many notices. Many repeated notices. Her left hand quaked and tremored some days from overuse. She believed she was suffering from carpal tunnel. All she really could do was grit her teeth and try to bear the daily grind.</p><p>As she looked at the monitors that survey magical homes (ones with Floo connections), Mafalda saw a bright burst of red light somewhere in Surrey. She shook herself awake and tapped her wand against the monitor to make it replay. Mafalda rose from the chair quickly and went to search the records. Something was wrong.</p><p> </p><p>“-lazy, no good nephew!” Vernon was continuing his tirade. He stopped as he heard the red envelope disintegrating, watching it fall into a heap on the counter. “What on earth was that?”</p><p>Aunt Petunia had closed her eyes, clutching empty air where her fingers had been touching wax and scarlet paper. Her next three words were so mind-numbingly unusual that it bear not even repeating.</p><p>"Vernon. Stop it."</p><p>“What?” Vernon said.</p><p>Petunia’s mouth was pursed. “Potter, Dudley, to your room.”</p><p>“Aunt Petunia-”</p><p>“<em> Now </em>,” Petunia seethed, still looking at her husband with crossed arms. Harry bolted to the door, with Dudley scrambling after him. Petunia closed the door after Dudley’s foot crossed the sill.</p><p>"What was that, woman? Say that again," Vernon said, turning to his wife. Unfortunately for Vernon, inconsistencies with his world-order seemed to be needed to be explained to him, even as they might be quite rational. Vernon himself was astonished that Petunia’s pea sized brain would think of such disgusting rebellion against her husband.</p><p> </p><p>“Richards!” Mafalda Hopkirk yelled from her monitors. The blustering intern came in, seeing that his boss was bothered. She was known to be quite persnickety when she wasn’t happy. She put down a folder and swerved to her desk.</p><p>“Ma’am?” Richards rattled in fear.</p><p>“There’s been a sudden reappearance of Petunia Evans’ magical signature. Privet Drive, Surrey. I want a squad out tomorrow-”</p><p>The door opened. Albus Dumbledore smiled, smoothing his ruffled orange robes and tilting his glasses. Richards and Mafalda looked on in shock as Dumbledore took a seat in a conjured chair. Richards dropped the tea set he had been carrying. Dumbledore smiled at him sympathetically before waving his wand and setting it to rights.</p><p>“Chief Warlock, I-”</p><p>“Do not worry, Mafalda,” Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eye. “I am not here officially, though I <em> would </em>like to call in that favour, if I may please.”</p><p>“C-certainly, sir,” Mafalda said, straightening herself in her chair. Dumbledore smiled and took a letter from an inside pocket.</p><p>“Thank you. I trust you will be discreet, Ms Hopkirk.”</p><p>“Yes, sir. Good day, sir.” Mafalda said.</p><p>Dumbledore smiled again, “Might I use your Floo?”</p><p>“Oh, of course. Powder’s behind the statue…”</p><p>Dumbledore found the small pot. He threw in a handful of powder and winked at Mafalda and Richards before disappearing in a ball of green flames.</p><p>“Ma’am, I-”</p><p>“Shh, Richards…” Mafalda said in a near whisper. She dismissed him, and opened the letter, reading carefully.</p><p> </p><p>“Move!” Dudley hissed. He kicked Harry over and took his place in front of the keyhole.</p><p>"Stop tormenting him, Vernon," Petunia continued.</p><p>"And why should I?" Vernon said, "He's a freak! No better than Margaret Thatcher!" He gestured madly with his hands. “You said so yourself!”</p><p>"Because, Vernon, we agreed to take care of the boy! To give him a home!" Petunia screeched. “When they will find out about what we've done, what I've done…”</p><p>"You put him there as soon as he could walk," Vernon pointed out. “In that cupboard there.”</p><p>"And it was <em> wrong </em>."</p><p>"We did what we wished, isn’t that the way with parenting? He deserved it, the little freak-".</p><p>"Get out of my house.”</p><p>"- probably was sent here to curse us ever since we let him in- wait, what?"</p><p>"Get out," Petunia repeated.</p><p>"How dare you!" Vernon said as he ground his teeth, "I helped raise our son! I paid for this house!"</p><p>"I will not have my child raised by a monster," Petunia said, throwing off her wedding ring.</p><p>Vernon puffed his way over to the counter. Petunia opened a locked drawer and took out a small wand, aiming it at Vernon's chest.</p><p>"You... you're a freak," he said, ashen faced.</p><p>"Hawthorn and phoenix feather, 9 ½ inches, stiff," Petunia said, ignoring Vernon’s last statement. She flicked her wand and Vernon's fat legs started to dance their way towards the door. Dudley and Harry screamed, jumping out of the way as Vernon catapulted through the closed kitchen door. Petunia jabbed her wand, a stream of sparks wrenching open the front door.</p><p>Vernon was gripping onto the banister, trying not to dance out of Number Four. Petunia steepened the angle of her wand. Vernon gasped as his weight disappeared like a great cloud of smoke, his face exploding in wrinkles and moles, hair growing shaggy and mangy, suit into faded rags. Dudley screamed as his father literally turned into a stranger before his eyes.</p><p>"I'll telephone to tell them you've quit your job, Vernon," Petunia said nonchalantly, checking her nails while still having her wand pointed at Vernon, "And you already did sign those papers, so that would be the last I’d see of you."</p><p>"You can't do this to me, <em> woman </em>! I own you!" Vernon shrieked in a far different voice.</p><p>"I'm afraid I can," she said. Another shower of sparks sent a very different Vernon shooting out of the door and into the street of Little Whinging. Petunia closed the door before turning around, seeing her very frightened nephew and son.</p><p>“Mum, why-”</p><p>“Daddy and I had a bit of a disagreement, Popkin,” Petunia said with a small smile. She knew she was exaggerating. He knew she was exaggerating. “If I could talk to Harry for just a few minutes, that would be great.”</p><p>Dudley spared time to look at his mother fearfully before bolting up the stairs. Petunia pursed her lips, knowing full well she would have to sort that out sooner than later. For now, she had bigger problems. She felt a uniquely powerful headache coming on. Her wand clattered to the floor as she slumped on the cupboard. Her vision turned black as Harry came yelling for her.</p><p> </p><p>Mafalda put down her letter, her objective clear and plain as the purple lettering on the parchment. She rose and tapped one of the runes on the side of the monitor. The data from the last ten minutes on the all-seeing device was erased. She took her grey file and slid it into the compartment in the mantle of her fireplace. She was very nervous as what she was doing was illegal and morally irresponsible in every sense yet she knew in her heart it was right. It took her a while to get back to work, her eyes darting at the thin office door separating her from the rest of the office.</p><p> </p><p>As far as Ophelia Hall of Number Five, Privet Drive was concerned, life in Little Whinging had been thus far normal, thank you for asking. However as she was putting down her knitting to call her neighbour about a strange man wandering outside Number Four, she saw a wickedly fast ambulance with a grey M on the hood slide to and fro on the driveway. She clutched her chest as she saw Petunia being carried out on stretchers.</p><p>Ophelia reached for her phone, to call strange old Arabella at Wisteria Walk, when she saw that not only was Petunia being carried out by four nuns into a white ambulance, but that her stretcher wasn’t being wheeled out of the drive way at all- it was being supported by itself! She clasped her opal rosary.</p><p>Ophelia saw Petunia’s strange nephew and lovely Dudley climb into the boot of the ambulance with Petunia and two of the nuns, Dudley looking around to see if anyone was watching. A nun flicked a small stick, Ophelia not sure if it was a ruler or a conductor’s baton, and the door to Number Four had shut as well as the door to the ambulance. They drove off at breakneck speed, disappearing in a mirage. Ophelia clasped her chest and collapsed in her chair. She couldn’t wait to tell Number Six about this!</p><p> </p><p>Harry sat across from Dudley, who was numbly silent next to Petunia’s seemingly lifeless body. A Healer sat next to each boy, the one by Dudley trying to cheer him up by making bauble animals with her wand. Everytime he looked over, he flinched at the small display of magic. The one by Harry was silent as he was. She checked Petunia’s vitals once more before sitting back down. The van lurched as it entered the roundabout.</p><p>“Just about there,” the older Healer said.</p><p>“Is Aunt Petunia going to be okay?” Harry asked.</p><p>“She’ll be fine. A few days in St Mungo’s and she’ll be fine.”</p><p>Harry had never heard of St Mungo’s before. He looked out the window and saw that they were on the motorway going towards London. Harry stared as the van sped up to an impossible speed. The six lanes, trees, powerlines, everything disappeared into a blue fog. Harry shot up from his seat but was thrown back down as the ambulance skidded to a stop. Dudley looked green.</p><p>The Healers checked Petunia again before waving their wands and lifting the stretcher. The door opened into a large courtyard within an underground building. Workers in blue jumpsuits drove the car into the lot as more Healers rushed to help Petunia, Harry, and Dudley.</p><p> </p><p>They were helped into a separate room. Dudley was left with Petunia and given a Calming Draught. He fought off a Healer who tried to pull him away from his mother’s side. They let him be, and instead asked Harry to come with them. He looked for a moment at Petunia and Dudley before coming with the three Healers.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr Potter, these are representatives to Hogwarts. They requested to speak to you as soon as they were notified you were here.”</p><p>“Hello, Harry. Might I call you that?” an old man in a pink robe said, smiling through his beard. Harry nodded. “I’m Professor Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts School, and this is Professor McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress.” He gestured to a stiff looking witch who smiled briefly when Harry recognized her. “That will be all, Lucy.”</p><p>“Call if you need anything, Professor,” Lucy the Healer said. She left the room and closed the door.</p><p>“This must come as a great shock to you, Mr Potter,” Professor McGonagall said. “Why you are here, why we’re here for you.”</p><p>“It’s quite simple, if you’ll take a seat-”</p><p>“Am I in trouble? Are you taking me away?” Harry asked as he sat down.</p><p>“Oh heavens no,” McGonagall said quickly. “We merely wanted to give you your letter.”</p><p>“Letter?”</p><p>“Indeed. A letter was sent to Number Four just this morning from Hogwarts about the coming term,” McGonagall replied. “When we had been notified that Ms Dursley was… incapacitated, we thought it best if we delivered it ourselves.” She handed Harry a letter in a parchment envelope, a purple seal on the back of it.</p><p>“And to answer any questions you may have, of course.”</p><p>“I don’t understand,” Harry said, putting down the letter. “Why were you notified?”</p><p>“Why us of all people?” Dumbledore asked with a hint of amusement. “Why indeed. It seems you have had a rough time in the Muggle world, as far as schooling goes-”</p><p>“-Get to the point,” Minerva said sharply. Dumbledore looked over at her before acquiescing.</p><p>“As it stands Harry,” Dumbledore continued, “if Aunt Petunia happened to be incapable of taking care of you, it is a law of our Ministry that either they or the school you are set to attend will provide care for you.</p><p>“As it happens, I am quite fond of the school you are set to attend, as well as quite influential within it, not to mention the Ministry’s lack of… personal expenditures, shall we say.”</p><p>“But I don’t even know about Hogwarts, I don’t know why I’m here, or how-”</p><p>“Hogwarts is a school of magic. Your parents went there, the healers attending to your aunt went there, even we went to Hogwarts.”</p><p>“With varying degrees of success,” Dumbledore said. McGonagall looked at him sharply.</p><p>"Am I magical? Do I have magic?" Harry asked hopefully.</p><p>“You do indeed, Harry,” Dumbledore said, “As does your cousin.”</p><p>“Dudley?”</p><p>“Indeed,” Dumbledore nodded, “However, it was agreed he would attend a different school, given that your aunt attended a different school than your mother. Legacy is the name of the game when it comes to admissions, Mr Potter.”   </p><p>“Now that we’ve explained why we are here,” McGonagall said, “If you wouldn’t mind me asking why- Why is your aunt in St Mungo’s today, Mr Potter?”</p><p>“We only wish to get the full story,” Dumbledore said reassuringly, “Only tell us what you’re comfortable telling us.”</p><p>“Where do I begin?”</p><p>“How about starting with breakfast this morning?”</p><p>He told the two professors what happened at Number Four from breakfast that morning to up to when the nurses arrived. They listened attentively, as if Harry were the only thing that mattered in the universe. Harry stammered under the scrutiny, but seemed to relax as Dumbledore hummed and nodded with every turn of his story. He had their attention: he couldn’t have been crazy. All of this was real, right?</p><p>“The circumstances of you coming here, would you say, were agitated?”</p><p>“I suppose. I’d never seen anything like that between them. She’d been angry before, livid even. But nothing like this.”</p><p>“Do you know the current whereabouts of Vernon Dursley?” McGonagall asked.</p><p>“No,” Harry said curtly. A look passed between the two professor at his tone. Dumbledore nodded.</p><p>“Very well,” Dumbledore said. “You are taking this remarkably well, may I say.”</p><p>Harry shrugged. “I’ve been through stranger things.”</p><p> </p><p>The professors introduced Harry to the magical world by explaining Hogwarts, St. Mungo’s, the Ministry, and the wizarding world in general, as well as a few magic tricks. By the time Professor McGonagall had to leave, they were halfway through a box of shortbread, with empty tea cups and a plate with bread crumbs. Dumbledore continued to play Exploding Snap with Harry until Harry began to win. He held up his hands in defeat.</p><p>“Ah,” Dumbledore exclaimed as he wiped the soot off his orange robe. “Well, I thank you for a most wonderful evening, Harry.”</p><p>“You have to go too?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Unfortunately. Not everyone thinks spending time with young people is very productive. I say different, but I am not in charge it seems.” Dumbledore said. Harry smiled and nodded. Dumbledore patted him on the shoulder before leading him down the hall. Harry’s smile faded as he realised he was nearing Aunt Petunia’s room, back to a life that he didn’t want to live. Dumbledore smiled reassuringly and turned to face Harry in front of the door.</p><p>“You will be alright, yes?”</p><p>“I guess so...”</p><p>Dumbledore smiled. “Good. Professor McGonagall will see you tomorrow to pick up your school supplies. Farewell, Mr Potter.”</p><p>“Goodbye, sir,” Harry said. He watched Dumbledore leave for a moment before reaching to open the door.</p><p>When he entered, he saw Dudley sleeping next to Aunt Petunia. The wand she used to get rid of Uncle Vernon sat innocently on the nightstand, the equine hilt of it glinting in the lamplight. Harry sat awkwardly in the still room, holding an old copy of Witch Weekly in his hand, unwilling to believe still, after all that just happened, that the world he was now in existed.</p><p>“He got a Sleeping Draught from one of the healers,” Petunia said. Harry dropped his magazine and looked towards the bed. Petunia had stirred and looked very, very tired yet somehow not from lack of sleep.</p><p>“Oh, I-okay…”</p><p>“I’m sorry about- well,” Petunia fumbled with her words, pursing her lips as she tried to come up with an excuse. “I have something to tell you.”</p><p>“I know,” Harry said softly. “The Professors told me everything.”</p><p>Petunia was still. “You know?”</p><p>“Yes. You have magic, I have magic, Dudley-. But they also said that you weren’t you. All those years and-”</p><p>
  <em> I didn’t know my Aunt Petunia. </em>
</p><p>Petunia frowned.</p><p>“What happens to you and Dudley?” Harry continued, “Now that Uncle Vernon-”</p><p>“We’ll still be in Number Four,”Petunia said, “at least for a little while. I’ll have to see if I can get Dudley into Kasteel.”</p><p>“That’s where you went, the Dutch school?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>“I’m sorry-”</p><p>“It’s fine. It wasn’t you. It was…”</p><p>“Someone else,” Petunia finished. Another pause. “I hope you enjoy yourself, at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Will you be alright?”</p><p>“I’ll be fine, Harry, I’ll be-”</p><p>“Mr Potter, your bed’s ready,” a Healer said. They jumped in surprise. Harry looked back at Petunia, who nodded slowly.</p><p>“Good night,” Harry said awkwardly. Petunia just nodded again.</p><p>Harry followed the Healer into the other room. She bade him goodnight and closed the door softly. Harry turned on the lamp and saw that a large pair of pyjamas and a separate change of clothes, as well as a few books and a long box of Honeydukes’ chocolate had been left for him beneath a small purple-papered letter. Harry picked up the envelope and read the note inside.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Dear Harry, </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I thought you would enjoy a bit of chocolate before bed. Professor McGonagall provided the clothing- she told me that you would admire the fit of it. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Tomorrow, Professor McGonagall will take you to the Longbottom’s home. Your aunt Petunia has agreed to you staying at their house for the rest of the holiday and until she is better. As I have mentioned, you will be staying with Lady Augusta, an old friend of mine, and her grandson Neville, who is exactly a day younger than you are. Professor McGonagall will be escorting you to Diagon Alley in the next few weeks to arrange your school supplies for the coming term. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> All will be fine. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Good night , </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Professor Dumbledore </em>
</p><p><br/> Harry put the letter down and smiled. He put the letter on top of the box and onto the nightstand before changing into the pyjamas. Before his very eyes, it shrank until it was comfortably fitting. Harry climbed into the bed without a second thought, opening the box of chocolate and flipping to the first page of <em> The Tales of Beedle the Bard </em>.</p>
