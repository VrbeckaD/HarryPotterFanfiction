    <p>The moment Newt Scamander laid eyes upon Graves, he already knew that it was an imposter. Why? Well, the story begins twenty-one years ago…</p>
<p align="„center“"></p><p align="„center“">***</p><p>
  <em>December 1905, Germany</em>
</p>
<p>It was the Annual International Confederation of Wizards Ball, four days before Christmas Eve. Germany was the host this year and Neuschwanstein, the castle they picked, was covered in a deep layer of snow. All of the important wizards and witches were present, and those who were invited, but actually unimportant, tried their best to fit in. Much could be told about what happened, but considering what will happen twenty-one years from now, it´s not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>No, the important ones are two families that showed up to the festivities. One of them are the Graves´. Floyd Graves, Senior Auror at MACUSA and second in command to the Director of Magical Security, had been one of the first to receive an invitation. Being the descendant of one of the Original Twelve and holding a great deal of influence over the Magical Community in the United States, he was quite an important person. He was accompanied by his lovely wife, Audrey Graves, and his son, Percival. </p>
<p>Audrey Graves, compared to her husband and son, wasn´t as important or well known to the wizarding community. But it was quite alright with her. People tended to underestimate her, which suited the Irish witch perfectly. Her opponents usually didn´t know what happened when they found themselves captured by the female Auror.</p>
<p>Percival Graves was quite interesting. He was twenty-four years old and only a few cases away of being made Senior Auror. His intelligence and beauty were nearly enough to make half of the magical population swoon, men and women alike, and his power did the rest. Oh, his power. Still so young, but already an accomplished duelist and one of the most powerful wizards in the whole <em>world</em>. Floyd Graves was very proud of his son and convinced that he would one day be even more successful than he was. Yes, Percival was very interesting indeed, and his handsome features combined with his magical prowess were captivating a lot of attention.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other family significant to what occurred was a British one, the Scamanders. Priamos Scamander was Head Auror at the Ministry of Magic and therefore been invited to this ball. He only went because his wife insisted, though, he himself saw little use in such a stuck-up gathering. The Auror was accompanied by his aforementioned wife, Eleanor Scamander – who would never have been invited if it wasn´t for her husband, because, honestly, a Hippogriff breeder? – and his two sons, Theseus and Newton.</p>
<p>Theseus was fourteen years old and very proud of his age. Being excused from classes to attend such an event only boosted his ego and made him insufferable for his little brother. Newton, who preferred to be called Newt, was eight and six years younger than Theseus. Which was okay for him, he didn´t really care. As long as Theseus told him about his adventures and didn´t tease him too much.</p>
<p>These two families were attending the ball and neither would have been in contact with each other until the war, where Theseus´d meet Percival Graves, hadn´t there been this minor (major!) incident. Little Newt, bored out of his mind by fancy talking and watching the grown-ups dancing, decided to take a walk outside of the ballroom. Thus he left through the huge doors and wandered off, unnoticed by anybody – except for one pair of dark eyes.</p>
<p>Ever the perceptive one, Percival Graves watched the small figure walk out of the room, unsupervised. Which was kind of odd, given that the boy could hardly be older than ten. So he excused himself from his dancing partner, some French beauty whose name he´s already forgotten, and followed the little rascal.</p>
<p>Newt didn´t notice his shadow and had a tremendous amount of fun exploring the old castle, trying to unveil its secrets or imagining how princes and princesses walked around. He somehow ended up in a beautiful study with a fireplace and a smart chair standing behind an equally posh desk. The walls were decorated with carved wood and huge paintings. But Newt wasn´t interested in this stuff. No, he wanted to find secret places, maybe some sculptures of fantastic creatures – unicorns and dragons were always mentioned in such stories, right?</p>
<p>It was by pure chance that he found a secret compartment in the wall behind the majestic chair. The compartment contained a small casket emitting a soft and inviting golden light. Newt opened it and admired its content. Two delicate bracelets were lying inside, each made of twined strands of gold and platinum with small black opals and blue goldstones. Next to them were to rings, the smaller one golden and the bigger one platinum. They were plain, but there was something about them that made them magical.</p>
<p>Enthralled, Newt reached out to touch them. He didn´t notice the figure suddenly standing in the doorway nor the exclaimed “No, don´t!”. Percival Graves, trying to prevent the unavoidable, dove forward. His left hand touched Newt´s left one the moment they came in contact with the casket´s contents. There was a magical pulse felt throughout the whole castle and the two wizards in the study passed out.</p>
<p align="„center“"></p><p align="„center“">***</p><p>It didn´t take long for Mrs. Scamander to notice that her youngest son was missing. After commanding that both her husband and older son go look for Newt, she walked around the ballroom, hoping to catch sight of him. Not watching her step, she bumped into another person.</p>
<p>“I´m terribly sorry.” She apologized. </p>
<p>“No harm done.” The woman she dumped into immediately reassured her. “It´s fine. I don´t think we´ve been introduced; I´m Audrey Graves.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Scamander smiled at the beautiful dark haired witch with interesting grey eyes. “A pleasure. I´m Eleanor Scamander. I´d really love to talk to you, Mrs. Graves, but I am looking for my younger son, Newton. He tends to wander off on his own, always exploring and chasing after stuff…”</p>
<p>“Oh!” Mrs. Graves exclaimed. “I hope he´s alright. I´m actually looking for my son, too. He doesn´t seem to be here anymore.” </p>
<p>“Percival Graves?” Mrs. Scamander asked. “I´ve heard of him. His reputation as an Auror and his skills in wandless magic have reached the British Ministry, I have to say.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Graves smiled. “That´s my son. Maybe he and Newton left together?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Scamander laughed. “I doubt it! Newt´s only eight years old. He–”</p>
<p>A magical pulse made her fall silent and every other being, may it be wizard or house elf, stopped whatever they were doing.</p>
<p>“What in Merlin´s name was that?” Someone finally asked.</p>
<p>“I don´t know.” The German Head Auror admitted miserably. “Maybe we should investigate…?” He looked at the German Governor.</p>
<p>Said witch nodded. “Teams of two are to search the castle for the cause and report to their respective superiors. I don´t want anything to happen on my watch.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Graves and Mrs. Scamander exchanged a look. That their two sons were missing at the same time while some magical incident occurred, it couldn’t be coincidence. Without having to talk, they immediately went to get their husbands and met up at the same point.</p>
<p>“Both Percival and Newton are missing.” Mrs. Graves said. “There has to be connection.”</p>
<p>The two Aurors looked at each other. Mr. Scamander cast a tracking spell and set off to the implied direction, Mr. Graves hot on his heels. The two wizards followed the spell to a door, where it ended. They exchanged one last look and, wands pointed at the door, carefully opened it. The sight greeting them was unexpected.</p>
<p>Percival and Newt were lying on the floor, their left hands touching each other. Next to Percival´s head was an empty casket. At first, the Aurors didn´t notice anything strange. But then Graves took a closer look at their sons´ hands and frowned.  </p>
<p>“Did Newton wear a ring prior to this?” He asked.</p>
<p>“No, he didn´t.” Scamander answered alarmed. The British Auror stepped closer and looked at the jewelry his son was wearing. A delicate bracelet, a plain ring… He eyed Percival´s hand and gasped. “Merlin´s balls!” He whispered, horrified.</p>
<p>Graves, taken aback by such crude language, blinked. “What?” He asked. </p>
<p>Scamander gestured to the ornaments. “I know of this. This… If I´m right…” He shook his head. “I´ve come across such jewelry before, once, during a case. They had not been used, thank Merlin for that. But…” He trailed off.</p>
<p>“For God´s sake, spit it out.” Graves demanded.</p>
<p>Scamander looked at him. “It´s betrothal jewelry. <em>Magical</em> betrothal, irreversible and unbreakable. If either one of them tries to, ah, <em>cheat</em> on the other one, well, I don´t want to imagine what will happen.”</p>
<p>Graves had an appalled expression on his face. “You mean to say that Percival and Newton are engaged and have to marry one day? Because otherwise they´ll never–” He choked. “Mercy Lewis! Are you sure there´s nothing we can do?”</p>
<p>Scamander closed his eyes and touched the tip of his wand to Percival´s bracelet. After a moment he opened them again. “I am quite sure.” He replied quietly.</p>
<p>Gravely, Graves ran a hand through his hair, then gently nudged his son. “Percival, wake up.”</p>
<p>The young man groaned and blinked, slowly sitting up. He rubbed his eyes with one hand and froze. It was his left hand, the one with the ring and the bracelet. His eyes darted to Newt, wearing the same jewelry, then to his father and the British Auror, wariness in his dark gaze. </p>
<p>“What happened? What is going on?” He asked.</p>
<p>Graves sighed. “I´m so sorry, Percival.” He murmured and looked at his international colleague for help.</p>
<p>Scamander briefly hesitated, then started to speak. “I´m afraid this is betrothal jewelry–”</p>
<p>“Oh no, please, no!” Percival interrupted him, obviously knowing what the older man was talking about. “I read about it, it´s irreversible and binding…” His horrified eyes glanced at Newt before he closed them. “Mercy fucking Lewis–”</p>
<p>“<em>Percival Galahad Graves!</em>”</p>
<p>“– <em>he´s just a child!</em>” Percival hissed, glaring at his father.</p>
<p>“I know.” Floyd Graves whispered. “I know.” He glanced at the British Auror and looked down.</p>
<p>Scamander was kneeling next to his son, his lips pressed together as he watched his son sleep. Then, with a fluid movement of his wand, the bracelet and the ring disappeared. “I won´t tell him. At least not now.” He said quietly. “He´s too young.” A mirthless laugh escaped his lips. “He´s only eight years old, for Merlin´s sake!”</p>
<p>Percival blanched, looking sick. ‘<em>Eight years old</em>’ he mouthed.  This boy, his <em>fiancé</em>, was fucking sixteen years younger than him. <em>Sixteen</em>. And moral questions and everything aside, Percival was to wait who knows how long until he was able to have sex again? Assuming that Newt was inclined to have sex with him, once he was older… The young Auror looked down at the small form of his betrothed and clamped down his teeth. No, he wouldn´t throw up.</p>
<p>Mr. Scamander shoot him a look, half compassionate, half miserable. “Nobody should know about this.” The Brit said.</p>
<p>Graves nodded and picked up the casket, placing it inside the secret compartment which closed on its own. Percival was still sitting on the ground, shell-shocked. Floyd placed a hand on his son´s shoulder and squeezed it lightly. “Come on, Percival.” He said quietly. Percival stood up and followed his father.</p>
<p>They silently walked behind Scamander who was carrying his sleeping son. The young Auror ran a hand over his face and grimaced when he saw the damned jewelry. With a quick wave of his wand he placed a concealment charm on them. He really hoped that he´d be able to take them off. Knowing his luck, it probably wouldn´t be the case.</p>
<p>Mrs. Graves and Mrs. Scamander were already expecting them, Theseus waiting with them.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank Merlin!” Mrs. Scamander exclaimed and rushed forwards to take Newt into her arms. Her joy expired, though, when she noticed the expression her husband was wearing. “What´s going on?” She asked.</p>
<p>“We need to talk, privately.” Mr. Scamander said and took one of the glasses standing on a table next to them. “<em>Portus</em>. You and Mrs. Graves go ahead and take the kids with you. It´s a portkey to our house. Both Mr. Graves and I will check in with their superior and I need to brief my Aurors. We´ll be there as soon as possible, I promise.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Scamander looked into her husband´s eyes, searching for something, then nodded. “Alright. Mrs. Graves, Theseus…” Mrs. Graves stepped over from where she´d been standing with her son and husband and after a last glance, the four of them disappeared.</p>
<p align="„center“"></p><p align="„center“">***</p><p>It was nearly three o´clock in the morning when the three wizards arrived at the Scamander´s. After having found nothing suspicious, the ball had continued, only that some Aurors had to patrol. Excusing Mrs. Graves, saying that she was sick, both Graves and Scamander had taken the first shift and left the moment they were free to go, Scamander leaving his Aurors in his second in command´s capable hands.</p>
<p>Now, physically tired and mentally exhausted, all three of them stumbled a bit as they touched the ground.  They were greeted by the two witches. Theseus and Newt have long since gone to bed, sleeping soundly in their rooms.</p>
<p>“How about we talk tomorrow and you rest now?” Mrs. Scamander gently proposed. “I already prepared two chambers for our guests.”</p>
<p>“That´s good with me.” Mr. Graves said and smiled tiredly. “This won´t disappear on us.”</p>
<p>Percival shuffled uncomfortably. Mrs. Scamander smiled at the Graves´. “Follow me, please.”</p>
<p>After a restless night for the wizards who were all wondering how the hell they would explain this whole mess to the two witches, they all sat down for a late breakfast. Newt was already playing outside with the Hippogriffs and Theseus was doing whatever teenage boys did these days, even though it was obvious that he wanted to pester Percival with questions about Aurors.</p>
<p>“Now, what is going on?” Mrs. Scamander asked after her husband had cast a silencing charm.</p>
<p>“Percival and Newt are engaged.” Mr. Scamander said bluntly. His wife paled and Mrs. Graves was staring at him with an open mouth.</p>
<p>Percival blushed and ended the concealing charm with a wave of his hand. “Betrothal jewelry.” He explained softly. “I saw Newt leave the ballroom yesterday and followed him. When I caught him reaching for the jewelry, I wanted to stop him. Too late, apparently.” He grimaced. “Mr. and Mrs. Scamander, I am very sorry for what happened.”</p>
<p>Mr. Scamander sighed. “Call us Priamos and Eleanor. We´ll be in-laws, eventually.”</p>
<p>“Then it´s Floyd and Audrey.” insisted Mrs. Graves – Audrey – with a tight smile. “And there is no possible way to undo this?”</p>
<p>“No” Priamos answered. “I am afraid not.”</p>
<p>Percival tuned out, playing with his newly and unwillingly acquired ring. How in Morgana´s shady cave was he supposed to survive? He was twenty-four, for Merlin´s sake, and still hasn´t outgrown his horny teenage years. He had a <em>girlfriend</em> – Mercy Lewis, how the hell was he supposed to explain this to her? He sure as hell couldn´t tell couldn´t tell her what happened. His eyes wandered to the window and he looked out, an unhappy look on his face as he watched Newt playing outside.</p>
