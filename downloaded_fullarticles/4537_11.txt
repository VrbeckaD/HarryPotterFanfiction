    <p>"Come now Percy, you look like you're going to a funeral, not picking out a pretty play thing."</p><p>"An Omega is more than a pretty play thing Theseus. Its a lot of responsibility. And getting one now, just as we are about move! The timing is terrible" Graves grumbles.</p><p>Percival does want an Omega though. As much as he and Theseus love each other, their relationship needs one. There are some urges that only an Omega can satisfy. But are they ready? Work is hectic for him at the moment and the move means packing up the entire apartment. Theseus for all his attentiveness is preoccupied with returning home. An Omega will need a lot of attention, especially in the beginning. If they can't give it the love it needs, it deserves, Percival would rather wait a while longer. Despite what colleagues may think he is not a cruel man.</p><p>Sensing his hesitation Theseus softens "If we don't find the right one today we can wait until we are settled in London before searching. How does that sound?"</p><p>Though his mate sounds reasonable, Percival knows the Brit is determined to get a mate as quickly as possible. So he merely grunts in response.</p><p>Smirking at how ornery his mate can sometimes be Theseus swiftly pecks him on the cheek before pulling him along the bustling New York sidewalk.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The building, when they reach it, is somehow both imposing and shabby. Gothic architecture, badly in need of repair, adorns the outside of the narrow "Harlem Home for Omegas". The foyer is surprisingly clean and modern, at odds with the outside facade. A pretty Beta perks up when the two well-dressed Alphas enter.</p><p>"Good morning sirs and welcome to the Harlem Home for Omegas. How can I help you this morning?"</p><p>"Hello" purrs Theseus, relishing how quickly flustered the Beta becomes under his gaze.</p><p>"We are here looking for an Omega to take home" Percival cuts in abruptly, not in the mood for Theseus' flirtations this early in the day.</p><p>"Oh, well...you see..." The Beta rambles, obviously he is just easily flustered. "You don't seem to have an appointment and we have a policy to vet all prospective mates before allowing them to take an Omega."</p><p>"Understandable, myself and my mate would be happy to give you the necessary details required for the vetting process now. We are trustworthy fellows after all." Ever the smooth talker Theseus manages to charm his way past the receptionist and gets them into a manager's office.</p><p>"For such upstanding gentlemen such as yourselves we can make some allowances, at our own discretion of course."</p><p>Percival struggles to not roll his eyes. He wasn't going to point out that having a vetting process means very little if a simple bride can wave it. No, Percival wasn't going to argue against it if it meant he and Theseus could see some Omegas today. He feels a fleeting pang of guilt for the Omegas that would go home with less than desirable Alphas, who have enough money to by-pass the rules.</p><p>"We have a strict ranking system, I can bring you to see our Class A Omegas. They are pedigree, have had good upbringings and display optimal traits."</p><p>Walking to the Class A Ward Graves looks over to Theseus who looks close to salivating in anticipation. Graves has been content with their relationship and would have been satisfied with just the two of them for a while longer. It was really Theseus who longed for an Omega. They took turns submitting to one another, but Theseus was having a harder and harder time doing so. Graves could admit that their relationship needed a submissive Omega. He was just worried about adding a new mate to the relationship. They needed to find the right Omega, and Graves worried Theseus had not thought it through enough. But they were here now and might as well have a look.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The Class A Ward was bright and airy. White and sterile. The Omegas all wore the same white pyjamas. They all had the same look, petite, dainty, cherubic faces. Looking around Graves was bored, they were all beautiful but utterly generic. He feared Theseus would quickly grow bored with a 'prefect' Omega.</p><p>Looking to his mate he can see he is right. The fire in his eyes has died down a bit. Graves knew Theseus would be disappointed. He had built it up too much. He had decided two days ago that they were getting an Omega. And in those two days he had constructed many fantasies with their Omega but now he's facing the reality of actually getting one.</p><p>Wanting to protect his mate's ego Graves speaks "We don't have to rush into it Theus. We could ask friends if they know of any Omegas willing to be mated, like how you recommended Newt for Tina when she began looking. That could be an option for us." He can tell by the curl of Theseus' lips however that that is not in fact an option for them. Damn his mate was stubborn, he had a picture in his head and he was going to stick to it no matter what!</p><p>"This isn't all you have? There are more right?" Theseus asks the manager, trying not to sound desperate.</p><p>"We do. But they wouldn't be up to the standard of you gentlemen. They -"</p><p>"I want to see them anyway" Theseus cuts in impatiently, already heading towards the doors.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>They went through the B and C wards and Theseus was beginning to get angry. He thought it would be simple but instead it is terribly frustrating. The manager was grating on his nerves, making unwanted suggestions and pointing out Omegas that had no appeal. Not one scent stood out from the multitudes. How could that be? Thank god Percy was beside him, stoic and steady. Theseus doesn't know what he would do without his mate's solid presence.</p><p>He so desperately wants an Omega, not because Percy isn't enough. Good lord Percy is everything he could ever want in a mate. Its just Theseus knows that they would both love an Omega, a true submissive. He knows what Percy needs better than Percy does. He can just imagine, his dark, stoic mate dotting and loving on some pretty little Omega. He himself just wants a mate he can provide for, play a more dominating, caring roll with. </p><p>He and Percy are equals in everything. They're both Alphas, fought in the same war, both are from well-to-do families. The Alpha side of Theseus is roaring for an Omega to care for, a mate that he can lavish affection on, in a different way than with Percy. And he knows its the same for his mate, he is sure of it. That's why its so important to find the right Omega. What they have know is amazing, indescribable, and to think it could be even better!</p><p>"Whats through that door" he demands, pointing, even though its obvious which door he means.</p><p>"That is an intake room for new Omegas who are being introduced to these wards", the manager sniffs in disdain, its obvious what he thinks of the Omegas in these wards.</p><p>"Well I said I wanted to see every Omega you had" he knows how rude he is being but honestly, this Beta manager can fuck off, neither Alpha has asked for his opinion and he has no right to keep the Omegas he deems 'unworthy' out of sight. Both Theseus and Percival may be society men but they are no snobs. They learned in the war that being from a higher social class means nothing, all men die the same.</p><p>Unwilling to wait for the snooty manager Theseus barges through the door to the intake room, letting Percival follow him.</p><p>Its another sterile room, shabbier than the room in Ward A but still clean. All the cots are empty save for the one in the corner at the far end. An Omega is curled up tight in a ball facing away from the door.</p><p>Immediately Theseus feels a pull, even before he takes a breath. Inhaling is like being reborn. The scent is indescribable. All Theseus knows is that the Omega in this room is his, no two ways about it. He reaches blindly behind him, finding Percy's hand. He pulls Percy along, his mate must sense it too. But Theseus can't turn to see his expression. He can't tear his eyes from the curled up figure, fearing they might vanish.</p><p>The closer Theseus gets the stronger the pull. Instinctively he reaches out as soon as he gets close enough. There are no sparks no jolts at the touch. What there is is a spreading of warmth, from where his finger tips touch soft skin, a low frequency hum travels up his arm and spreads throughout his body. The feeling of 'rightness' of pure contentment settles into his bones. He lets out a soft sigh as he sits on the bed, settling himself next to the huddled figure.</p><p>Now that he has his hands on his Omega he can risk a glance at Percy. His mate has his gaze fixed on the Omega as well. His eyes wide in shock, mouth open ever so slightly. His tightly controlled Percy seems to be losing some of his renowned composure. Still holding onto Theseus' hand Percy reaches over with his other, resting it next to where Theseus is grazing silky skin.</p><p>When his mate makes contact and all three are connected its as if everything else dims. There is no sense of being in the ward, the very idea of busy Manhattan streets or smoggy roads in London are no where to be found. There is only the three of them and their connection. This is so much more than what Theseus was expecting but he will gladly take this euphoria.</p><p>***</p>
