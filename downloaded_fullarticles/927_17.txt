    <p align="justify">The owl from McGonagall was one of the most important pieces of post Harry had ever received, his acceptance to Hogwarts notwithstanding. He’d been woken by the clacking of her beak on his window, loud in the pre-dawn light. He stumbled out of bed, shoving glasses onto his still sleepy face, groping in the pockets of the jacket he’d slept in for a knut or two to pay her. Blinking away the sleep, Harry’s heart sped up at the Hogwarts crest pressed into the seal. The handwriting was vaguely familiar but there were few people from Hogwarts who would be writing to Harry. The address was clear – <em>Mr. Harry Potter, The Attic, The Burrow, Ottery St-Catchpole, Devon.</em> It was odd to see a Hogwarts letter still addressed in emerald green; he generally associated the colour with Dumbledore. Harry ripped it open and a sheaf of parchment fell out. As he flicked through the sheets, his jaw dropped open. Hands slightly shaking, Harry sat down, fumbling his way back to the first page – a letter addressed to him.</p><p align="justify">

</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Dear Mr. Potter,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>With the recent disruption to the school environment, the staff of Hogwarts have decided to offer students the opportunity to repeat one year of their schooling in order to maximise their future opportunities. Our records indicate you have not completed your N.E.W.T. studies at this time.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>If you would be interested in re-enrolling as an eighth-year student with a view to sitting N.E.W.T.s at the end of the coming academic year, we would be pleased to have you. A booklist is enclosed, along with information regarding your studies, accommodation and changes to school policies. If the provision of books, robes, a wand or other equipment is problematic, please contact the school as funds are available to support students who have been affected by recent events in the wizarding community.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Should you require accommodation earlier than the beginning of term, kindly send an owl as soon as possible to inform us of your travel plans. Please remember that all students, past and present, may rely on Hogwarts as a place of ongoing support, regardless of their situation. Should we be able to assist you in any way, contact any member of staff for an immediate response.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>We await your owl no later than August 31.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Yours sincerely,</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Minerva McGonagall</em>

</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Harry blinked and re-read the letter. Was it serious?</p><p align="justify">“Harry!”</p><p align="justify">At the sound of feet clattering on the stairs, Harry knew the others must have received similar letters. Ron and Hermione burst into the room, chattering excitedly, and he let them sweep him downstairs, where more of the Weasleys had collected in the kitchen. It was the most noise he’d heard here since the Battle; the loss of Fred had silenced the happy bustle of the house. Even the extra guests – Hermione and Harry returned to the Burrow immediately from Hogwarts – had not raised the noise level. Hushed whispers and choked sobs had become the norm; even now, weeks later, it wasn’t uncommon to walk into a room and find someone crying, either alone or in the arms of another. He sat and listened as everyone else spoke, watching shaking fingers clutch at parchment – Ginny’s, Ron’s, Hermione’s, George’s and his own. Everyone that would have been a student last year, plus George. Harry wondered if McGonagall had intervened there, given the colourful manner in which Fred and George had announced their departure from Hogwarts almost two years earlier.</p><p align="justify">From the sound of it, just about everyone was considering returning; only George and, to his surprise, Ginny, were talking about turning down the offer. It sounded as though she and George had been talking about continuing Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes together. While Ginny lacked George’s enthusiasm for jokes and pranks, she was far more business savvy than he.</p><p align="justify">As Harry watched her he realised they were already starting to take different paths. For him, there was no question about returning to Hogwarts. It was more of a home than anywhere he’d ever been, and right now, it meant comfort and a familiarity he needed desperately. The Weasleys were like family of course, but as they all grieved the loss of Fred, Harry felt the distance keenly. He had not known Fred as a boy, did not remember the family moments discussed as they tearily reminisced. He wondered if Hermione felt the same; perhaps her relationship with Ron made her feel closer than Harry felt. Either way, he wanted to return to Hogwarts for a while before…whatever came next.</p><p align="justify">+++</p><p align="justify">As it turned out, Harry returned to Hogwarts far sooner than he’d anticipated. The morning the letters had arrived, after the group had drifted apart, he and Ginny had ended up sitting alone at the kitchen table. He’d asked her about her plans with George, and as her quiet voice outlined their ideas, Harry knew he would never ask her to resume what they’d had. They were both broken, but while he wanted to go back to seek some comfort in the familiar before deciding what his life would hold, she was looking forward, seeking new challenges. When she stopped talking, he’d told her how great it sounded, and the look she gave him told Harry everything he needed to know. She knew they were over, too. He wouldn’t have to try and explain.</p><p align="justify">That day he’d written to McGonagall accepting his place at Hogwarts and asking how early he could arrive. Ron and Hermione hadn’t understood why he was leaving so early; in truth, he didn’t explain too deeply, not wanting to offend any of them by insinuating he felt excluded.</p><p align="justify">“Just need some time to myself, you know?” Harry said, and though they had nodded, he could see they really didn’t understand. He’d smiled lamely and turned to pack.</p><p align="justify">Two days later, Harry left the Burrow. He’d elected to spend a few days at the Leaky Cauldron, picking up what he needed in Diagon Alley and visiting Gringotts. It was remarkable how quickly the long crooked street had recovered, he thought, sitting at what had been Florean Fortescue’s Ice-cream Parlour. Florean had not returned after the War, and a nephew of his had taken over the business. Harry thought he would always like Florean’s sundaes better, but he didn’t tell Felix that. He sat at a corner table, eating his ice-cream slowly and watching people walk by. He’d cast a Disillusionment charm over himself, as was his habit when going out in public in the wizarding world. The attention he garnered was slowly dying down, but it didn’t hurt to be a little inconspicuous. All things considered, he’d rather not be famous for killing the man who had killed not only his parents but most of the people he’d come to rely on. Nothing would bring back Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, Dobby, Dumbledore, or the scores of others whose deaths were the result of Tom Riddle’s fear and arrogance. The last thing Harry wanted was to relive it with every person who passed him by.</p><p align="justify">+++</p><p align="justify">The day before he was due to leave – he’d chosen to Apparate to Hogsmeade before walking up to the castle – Harry gritted his teeth and braved Diagon Alley without Disillusioning himself. It was too difficult to catch the shopkeeper’s attention when he was Disillusioned; only a hard pinch to Felix made him focus enough on Harry to notice him. Harry felt himself shrink as curious eyes tracked him, the whispers following him down the street; he concentrated so closely on the booklist that he walked right into someone coming out of Knockturn Alley.</p><p align="justify">“Harry!” Harry braced for another onslaught of questioning, but to his relief it was the round face of Neville Longbottom that looked back at him.</p><p align="justify">“Neville,” Harry said with genuine pleasure. He’d not seen anyone since the day after the War had ended; all he knew about Neville was that he and his gran were both alive. “How are you?” They moved out of the traffic, finding a small nook to continue their conversation.</p><p align="justify">“Well, yeah,” Neville said, with the nonspecific answer everyone seemed to use nowadays. Harry always interpreted it as, ‘Terrible, but isn’t everyone? At least I’m alive.’</p><p align="justify">“Me and Gran are just straightening everything out at home. She hates to admit she’s getting older, and things recently weren’t easy.”</p><p align="justify">Understatement of the year, Harry thought wryly.</p><p align="justify">“Are you coming back to Hogwarts?” Harry asked. He was surprised at the shy grin that came over Neville’s face at the question.</p><p align="justify">“Kind of,” Neville said in his unassuming way. “Professor Sprout visited me last week. She’s wanted to retire for a while now, and,” his face grew even redder as he admitted, “she offered me a job. I’ll be helping her in the greenhouses and in a few years I’ll hopefully take over.”</p><p align="justify">Harry was filled with something he couldn’t identify for a moment, then realised it was joy. He was pleased for Neville. “Wow, that’s great,” he said, making an effort to grin broadly at the still blushing Neville. “What does your Gran think about it?”</p><p align="justify">“She’s proud as anything,” Neville said, the amazement evident in his voice. “Told everyone at her Walking Witches group. I can’t wait, it will be so good to just…” he trailed off.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” Harry said. A small part of him was envious of Neville, who appeared to have the ideal job just dropped in his lap. But seeing the shy pride in Neville’s face put paid to that. “Well I’ll be seeing you there,” Harry told him, “I’m coming back to do N.E.W.T.s.”</p><p align="justify">Neville’s eyes lit up. “Really? That’s excellent!” He hesitated. “Do you think you’ll take Herbology?”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, of course,” Harry said immediately. He hadn’t really thought about what he would study – he assumed he would pick up where he left off, which meant Defence Against the Dark Arts, Potions, Transfiguration, Charms, and Herbology.</p><p align="justify">“Great! Well I’m just off to try and find some Venomous Tentacula seeds, we used them all up, you know,” Neville said. Another Battle reference, Harry understood. People had become experts at Not Mentioning The War, and most people were equally good at Understanding What You Meant When You Were Not Mentioning The War.</p><p align="justify">“Okay, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, then,” Harry said. He and Neville parted ways and he felt much better about returning to school. At least there would be one friendly face he could talk to if he needed to.</p><p align="justify">Harry pulled out his booklist again and made his way towards Gringotts, avoiding Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes without thinking about it. He would need to start from scratch when it came to school supplies; it was a good thing his vault was so well-stocked. At least he wouldn’t need to buy a wand, though Ollivander had opened his shop immediately after Voldemort’s fall. He’d been quoted in The Quibbler as saying he felt at home nowhere more than in his shop, surrounded by old friends. Harry knew the feeling. He’d visited with the old man earlier in the week, talking of nothing in particular. Harry had shown him his repaired wand, over which the gnarled fingers had passed with a tenderness usually reserved for small babies.</p><p align="justify">“I am pleased for you, Harry,” Ollivander had said. “The two of you bonded so deeply, I doubt you would find satisfaction with any other.”</p><p align="justify">Harry had to agree. Right now, he was just pleased it was one thing he didn’t have to buy. As it was he had a long list: trunk, complete sets of robes, broomstick, quills and ink, books and equipment as well as potions ingredients to buy. And that wasn’t including the Muggle money he’d spent on new Muggle clothes and shoes and a new pair of glasses (he’d asked for the exact same frames as his old ones – it was one small thing he could keep the same). Most of the shops were happy to send his purchases on to Hogwarts, which would make his walk from Hogsmeade up to the castle far easier.</p><p align="justify">At Madame Malkin’s, his last stop, Harry arranged for his new robes to be sent to Hogwarts. As he turned towards Fortescue’s Ice-Cream Parlour, a movement caught his eye. Harry stepped towards the window, a wave of sadness coming over him as he stared into the window of Eeylops Owl Emporium. It would be so strange being at Hogwarts without Hedwig; he’d missed her more being back at the Burrow than any-time since she’d died. The familiar space accentuated her absence, he supposed, watching a barn owl stretch its wings restlessly. He turned away, the good feeling after seeing Neville now wiped out between the low level of anxiety he felt in the whispering crowd and seeing the owls. He’d go back to the Leaky Cauldron, make sure his brand new trunk was packed for tomorrow, and get a good night’s sleep. It was bound to be draining, returning to the castle.</p>
