          <div class="userstuff"><p>You were helping Newt feed the creatures in the suitcase. Forgetting the Erumpent was in heat, you walked over to feed it.   Behind you, you could vaguely here Newt asking you what you were doing. Ignoring his calls, you kept walking.  "Y/N, stop", Newt screamed.  "What?", you looked around,  kind of confused.  Newt produced a helmet and a shield.   "Safety first, what are you? Five? The Erumpent's in heat."  Then you remembered, you quickly put on the helmet, placing the shield in front of you".</p></div>
