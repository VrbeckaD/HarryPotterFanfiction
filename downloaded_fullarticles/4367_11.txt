          <div class="userstuff"><p>Danger</p><p>In a room full of people<br/>You are always the quiet one <br/>Not in a corner<br/>Not standing alone<br/>You stand in the middle and listen<br/>You walk through a crowd and hear what other people don't say<br/>Watching you is like seeing an ice cristal grow<br/>When someone speaks to you you shatter<br/>But when you speak to people you shine<br/>I hope to one day hear your voice <br/>Your enthusiasm for the little things<br/>The unknown most people don't care about<br/>But until that day I stay in my corner<br/>And watch you grow, praying that no one will break you and no one will be cut by your edges sharper than knives</p><p>I think I'm in love</p><p>I think I am dying<br/>_____<br/>When I am cold I think of you<br/>I think of your fire when you touch<br/>I think of your mouth when it spits<br/>I think of your feet when they burn<br/>No one I know got beaten down more often than you <br/>Just a kid and already a diamont<br/>And you shone so much people fought for it<br/>To my dispair that dimmed you down until there was just a flicker left<br/>One you can only see when someone else ignites<br/>I would turn into a forest fire just to catch a glimpse of your diamont in the dirt <br/>But I don't think I have to just yet <br/>Even if I tried to help you, you would get up yourself and fight</p><p>I wish I had your courage</p><p>I wish you wouldn't need it<br/>_____<br/>I couldn't write a song to your heartbeat<br/>No one can sing that fast<br/>I couldn't write a song to your body<br/>Worship these days is for gods and sex<br/>And maybe those are one and the same<br/>And if that were true it would make me sad<br/>But then I'd think of you <br/>Any part of you is good enough to cheer me up<br/>I don't say perfect, you would hate that<br/>Flawless is boring <br/>Love complicates things for me since I like to be objective <br/>But then again love is hard for everyone <br/>Sometimes I look in the mirror and imagine myself in your arms<br/>Not for obvious reasons<br/>Ugly and gorgeous don't match</p><p>I think I'm interested</p><p>I think I will be for the rest of my life <br/>_____<br/>Maybe I am not in love<br/>Maybe I am full of hate<br/>I think like I am you <br/>It eases the pain of the gaps in my everything <br/>Sometimes I feel so worn I fall apart <br/>Imagening to be a person without dents would shorten my time to heal <br/>But you are so flawed<br/>Behind your frown there are oceans worth of pain<br/>I can't imagine thriving very well in a place where my hair gets damp<br/>Maybe I am in love</p><p>I want to take your pain<br/>____</p></div>
