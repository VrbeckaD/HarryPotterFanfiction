    <p>     “Mr. Scamander.” Tina’s words come out as a whisper. All of the feelings she had been pushing away start to bubble to the surface and her eyes begin to water. She can’t help it. She feels too much for Newt Scamander to just hold it all in. She looks away to wipe the tears away with her sleeve, praying Newt doesn’t notice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>     He does notice. There’s a sharp shock in his heart as he realizes the pain he’s caused her over the past few months. He hadn’t meant to hurt her of course, everything just became so complicated. Grindelwald escaped MACUSA custody and all of a sudden trying to keep in contact with one another was a difficult task. Newt awkwardly shuffles from his left to his right foot and scratches the back of his neck, “Hello Tina.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>     Newt finally looks at her, <em>really looks at her</em>. She’s changed since the last time he saw her. Her hair is different, a bit shorter now. It’s the same color as it was in New York but somehow it seems so much darker, contrasting even more against her pale skin. Everything about her seems a little bit harsher these days.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>     There’s so much they both want to say, so much they <em>need </em>to say. But there’s a war going on; There’s no time for heavy conversations about the status of their relationship.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>     Tina breaks the silence first, “What brings you to Paris Newt?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>     “Theseus asked for my help,” he rubs the back of his neck hoping to release some of the tension there, “He said I could be of assistance since I helped with the capture of Grindelwald the last time.” Both of their voices are hushed, as if they are hiding from somebody; hiding from themselves.</p>
<p>     For the first time since he walked in a small smile spreads across Tina’s lips, “I’m glad he’s starting to see how important you actually are.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>     A warmth crawls through Newt’s body, she’s always been able to recognize the good in Newt, even when he couldn’t.</p>
<p>     He starts to blink, a nervous habit of his. “I can’t take all of the credit, you had a big hand in his capture too Tina.” Newt’s eyes catch Tina’s and it’s like they’re back on the docks at the edge of New York City. There’s so much emotion; too much. Tina looks away, it breaks her heart to think about what things were like back then.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>     A deafening silence settles between them. Neither of them quite sure what to say. It had been so much easier in New York all those months ago. But now, it’s like the whole world is engulfed in darkness. Wizard-kind was in a state of panic. With Grindelwald on the loose, nobody felt safe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>     And then Tina remember’s why she’s here in Paris, why she’s even in this empty conference room. “I’m sorry to cut this short, but I have to get going. I’m meeting with some other aurors soon.” Tina bit her lip, wishing she could stay and talk to him more.</p>
<p>     “Oh, of course,” Newt moves to the side to make room for Tina, “So sorry to have held you up.” She walks away but stops a couple of feet before the door. “Newt?” She turns around, clutching her hands in front of her. Newt’s eyes widen in concern. Tina walks back towards him and gently rests her hand on his cheek, “Please try to stay safe out there.” Their eyes meet again, and it’s like they can feel their walls starting to crumble. This is the Tina that Newt remembers. “I’ll try my best.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>     Tina’s heart warms and she feels another set of tears coming. She turns around before Newt can see and heads out the door. Back to reality; back to the chaos.</p>
