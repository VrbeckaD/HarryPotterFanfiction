    <p>Draco heard a commotion and poked his head out of the cramped office he shared with two other clerical assistants. Tired of pushing papers for the Wizengamot Administration, he welcomed a distraction. </p><p>He saw a few bedraggled Aurors making their way slowly past him, on their way to the Head Auror's office.  Raucous shouting and hearty congratulations surrounded them. </p><p>Draco unthinkingly sought out unmistakable green eyes and unruly black hair. He saw the exhaustion and the elation in Harry's expression and knew better than anyone how much Harry had suffered over this case. He ached with an impossible urge to share in this moment, to tell Harry that he understood, and to assure him that he deserved this success more than anybody.</p><p>“Nice job, Potter,” was the best he could manage when Harry was within feet of him. Harry made fleeting eye contact, barely an acknowledgment, and Draco's chest clenched with the pain of it.</p><p>He turned his back to Draco and called out. “You lot better come celebrate at the Leaky tonight.”</p><p>Draco wouldn't go. He wouldn't let Harry's indifference towards him torment him outside of the Ministry as well. </p><p>As things go, Draco found himself buying a round of pints at the Leaky Cauldron several hours later. When he turned away from the bar someone jostled him, and he fell straight into Potter. Amid a fluster of limbs and apologies, Potter managed a smooth “it's alright; no harm done” and turned to leave. </p><p>Draco crumpled inside. He would rather the biting remarks and unbridled enmity of their youth than this distant apathy. “Potter,” he said, grabbing his arm. “You've got beer all down your front. Just let me bloody fix it. I know you're pants at cleansing charms.”</p><p>Potter didn't answer immediately, his attention apparently caught by Draco's touch. Draco watched in shock as a blush diffused across Potter's cheeks. </p><p>“Alright,” Potter said finally, and Draco's heart soared.</p>
