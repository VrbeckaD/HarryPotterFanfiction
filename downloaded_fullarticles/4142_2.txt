  <em>Q: Dear Uncle Jay, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’ve fallen head-over-heels for a fine-arts major – but I’m a theoretical physics nerd. Any advice on getting his attention? I suck at art, but admire it. Do you think it can work, or should I stick to my own kind? </em>

<p>“He’s so smart, and kind, and he does this thing where he tilts his head…”</p><p>Jamie sometimes wondered how his life had come to this: playing sympathetic ear to a love-lost Greek god.</p><p>“…he’s studying robotics, and his project is this autonomous healthcare companion. It’s really cool, and I’m going to bless it – not too much but just a little sapience…”</p><p>His night had started ordinarily enough. Jamie had been quietly doing homework in his dorm at college when a laurel-bearing raven alighted on his window sill. Jamie had left his window open to the chill fall breeze in hopes a certain spirit would make an early appearance.</p><p>Not that Jack was his only supernatural visitor. Jamie might be just an ordinary, over-worked, over-achiever, odd-ball of an undergraduate on the mortal side of things; however on the other side he was minor celebrity. The Last Light, a mortal who Believed widely and deeply enough to see every spirit.</p><p>“Can your master wait twenty minutes?” Jamie asked the raven in Corvid. It was only polite.</p><p>The raven cocked its head in thought and then cawed, “Yes. Take an hour. Despite what Sunny-Boy might think it’s not the end of the world.”</p><p>Jamie snorted at the raven’s disrespectful nickname. But ravens were like that – The Raven had taught him mostly Corvid swear words to begin with. Jamie’s suspicions had only be confirmed when he scandalised North by asking him to attempt something impractical with a hedgehog.</p><p>Over the years his curiosity and friendly nature had earnt him a reputation as mediator and confidante. Despite being a protectorate of the Guardians (even as an adult), and definitely light-aligned – he was willing to hear less reputable spirits out. Jamie didn’t have the power to threaten to them, but it would be suicide to for them to hurt him.</p><p>Jamie quickly wrapped up his homework since “My presence was requested by a god” wasn’t going to cut it for an extension. Why he’d decided to do a double degree Jamie couldn’t say. It seemed like a good idea at the time. As had expanding his sounding-board service to the web and student paper. He had some Agony Uncle questions he needed to answer when he got home.</p><p>[Duty calls. Going to Mt O. Sorry to derail any surprise visit.]</p><p>The last thing Jamie did before standing to leave was message Jack about who he was going to visit. Standard operation procedure, ever since he started doing this. Jack couldn’t stop Jamie, but it comforted the winter spirit to know what his first believer was up to.</p><p>“Okay, how are we travelling?”</p><p>The raven broke into laughter before calming enough to croak, “To the roof Godspeaker.”</p><p>It was a standard instruction, but Jamie still shivered. It was a game in the spirit world minting new titles for people. There was power in names, and freely using someone’s name in the spirit world was crass bordering on criminal. Plus crafting ridiculous titles was kinda fun.</p><p>No one mentioned the raven on Jamie’s shoulder as he walked through the dorms and up to the roof. He wasn’t sure if the bird was enchanted, or magic itself, or whether people were just used to him being weird. He certainly wasn’t making a big deal of it, instead checking his phone after a text came in.</p><p>[No prob *✲ﾟ*｡✧٩(･ิᴗ･ิ๑)۶*✲ﾟ*｡✧ Over Scott tonite Call if u need me （*＾3＾）/～♡ ]</p><p>Jamie snickered at Jack’s texting. The elaborate emoticon thing had started only a three months ago, and Jack had yet to repeat himself. The lazy spelling – that was trademark at this point. The one time Jamie had questioned Jack’s literacy; the frost sprite had refused to communicate in anything other than modified (and correctly spelt) literature quotes for a week.</p><p>[Will do. Love you too.<br/>
[PS Who’s Scott? Should I be worried?]</p><p>But if Jack was going to continue to type badly, and in a non-autocorrect way, Jamie was going to poke fun at him. Yes, their brothers-by-choice bromance was pretty epic. Plus, being a little shit was a little brother’s prerogative. Not that Jack was much better.</p><p>Jamie really should have been expecting what was awaiting him on the roof. A flaming, golden chariot, with equally brilliant stallions. Actually they were basically horn-less rapidash.</p><p>“The Sun Chariot?” Jamie asked, “Isn’t this Helios’?”</p><p>“Time-share.”</p><p>Jamie raised an eyebrow at that but didn’t comment. Instead, he walked up to it and at the raven’s nod stepped up onto it.</p><p>“Hope I’m not going to pull Phaëton.” Setting the world on fire would be a tad awkward. Though Jack would take cooling it back down as a challenge.</p><p>“You don’t see the sun attached, do you? Doc might be twitter brained right now, but he’s not <em>that</em> stupid.”</p><p>Jamie let out a sigh of relief. He grabbed the reins and gave them a crack. The horses reared and broke into a gallop into the sky. Their whinnies were closer to roaring flames than normal, and sparks flew where their hooves trod on air.</p><p>All in all, pretty normal for pretentious supernatural transport.</p><p>[Yep He dreamy ♡｡ﾟ.(*♡´‿` 人´‿` ♡*)ﾟ♡ °・W Relopng 2 greta grn U cn b best bro]</p><p>[I’ll need a couple days to rent a tux. I hope you put a ring on it]</p><p>Despite standing up in an open chariot, Jamie didn’t feel the least bit endangered by their supersonic travel. He had faith the horses knew what they were doing, and that if something did go wrong he’d manage. Thankfully the chariot could travel a bit faster than dawn without the sun. Otherwise it would’ve been hours rather than minutes for it to reach Mount Olympus.</p><p>The Mytikas Peak and gorges around sparkled like stars planted on earth. Jamie looked down on the palaces of the Dodekatheon and saw the dark holes of those who’d faded. It was sad how little belief there was in the world these days.</p><p>The horses rode down towards a stately palace and alighted on a wide balcony. The stonework was ancient Greek but in between it all Jamie saw a surprisingly cosmopolitan mix of decorations. Actually it looked like Apollo was in a bit of a nipponophile phase.</p><p>Speaking of the god, there was a golden, Greek, youth sprawled on a sun lounge a little further along. Like many a spirit, his appearance was supernaturally exquisite. In this case Apollo was the perfect image of an athletic young man and could be anywhere between late teens to mid-twenties. Toned but not bulky, just a light dusting of hair, but still a softness to his face. However, Jamie had been exposed to enough glamours and allures that he’d built up an immunity. At this point he found “perfection” to be boring really.</p><p>“Hello, you asked for me?” prompted Jamie. Since the god’s attention seemed riveted on a glowing phone screen.</p><p>At the disturbance, the Greek looked up, dropped his phone and sprang up to hug Jamie. The poor mortal barely had time to react before the god had flopped back down on his sun lounge. Apollo waved for Jamie to lie down on a recliner that hadn’t been there a second ago.</p><p>“Right, right,” the old/young god started babbling, with copious gesturing, “I’m so happy you could make it! I, like, really need your advice. You’re good at that right? I need some advice, like,” here Apollo leaned over to whisper behind his hand, “<em>relationship advice</em>. Well you see it’s about a man. A mortal. And I just don’t know what to do!”</p><p>The god actually swooned, forearm over forehead and all.</p><p>Jamie took a moment to collect his thoughts (and check Apollo wasn’t going to start raving again). God and mortal, not unprecedented. In fact, Apollo had done it a few times in the past. With both guys and girls. Still basics first.</p><p>“Does he Believe in you?” asked Jamie, cringing at his suspicions.</p><p>“No,” groaned the god, “He’s a <em>scientist</em>.”</p><p>Well, damn. Jamie had suspected the first, but the second made things more difficult.</p><p>“What kind of scientist?” Please say paranormal researcher.</p><p>“Robotics and healing mostly,” replied Apollo, his mood (and the background music) lifting again as he got to explain why his crush was the “most perfect mortal ever”. Jamie honestly tuned it out a little, trying to come up with a course of action. A roboticist probably didn’t Believe in any spirit, and might not have since early childhood. Hopefully Apollo could do what Jamie thought was the best course of action. “…really cool, and I’m going to bless it – not too much but just a little sapience. It’ll make the prototype better right?”</p><p>“Yeah,” agreed Jamie, “Now. Are you able to cross the Veil?”</p><p>Crossing was a tricky task. A supernatural creature had to suppress all their magic – Jamie had heard it described as ontologically holding one’s breath – so non-believers could see them. North was the only Guardian able to do it – the others were too inherently magical. Though Jack might if he really worked at it. For spirits who had been around before the Guardians shifted at the end of the Dark Ages it was an each way bet. Their remembrance of walking with mortals sometimes got in the way of needing to actively appear to them.</p><p>“Not for long,” admitted Apollo, “Just a couple of hours.”</p><p>“Okay, that’s enough to give him your number or email in a café or something right? Nobody knows you’re a god on the internet, right.”</p><p>“…yeah.”</p><p>“Before you do that, I’ll send you a little primer I’ve written up. Plus some links to decent dating advice. Don’t want you scaring him off with sleazy pick-up lines.”</p><p>“Thank you,” said Apollo. Or more accurately gushed for ten minutes, with another picto-second hug.</p><p>“Why did you ask for my help, rather than Eros’?” asked Jamie, genuinely curious, “Is it ‘cause he’s family?”</p><p>“Cupid is no family of mine.” The bitter grief in Apollo’s voice was reflected by the light dulling and a sick feeling in the air. “He Faded long ago. I have no quarrel with those who hold his title now. I just… rather not deal with them.”</p><p>Jamie let the topic drop. He was curious, but not going to be jerk and push. He’d ask around when he got home. Instead he prompted Apollo to gush about his crush a little more, and threw a few more suggestions. They talked for another hour, before Apollo sent him on his way.</p><p>On the flight back to his college, Jamie checked his phone and was unsurprised by the dozen messages live-blogging Jack’s misadventures over Scotland. Apparently his epic romance with Scott had fizzled out. Despite Jack completing a series of ever more ridiculous tasks culminating in stealing the Stone of Scone.</p><p>[It 2 hvy {{|└(&gt;o&lt; )┘|}} so ༼ ಥ﹏لಥ ༽ ᵘgᵍʰ I dump Scott liek a cat 5 blzz ヽ(#ﾟДﾟ)ﾉ┌┛Σ(ノ´Д`)ノ]</p><p>[Good on ya. Don’t let anyone boss you around.]</p><p>[Jamie! U dun w godmodding?]</p><p>[Yes, on my way back to dorm now. Are you coming round?]</p><p>[No cn d00. ヾ(_ _。）The storm rage on ヽ｀、ヽ｀ヽ(*￣o￣*)&gt;ヽ｀、ヽ｀]</p><p>[Okay, good luck.]</p><p>It was late when Jamie got home but he had stuff he needed to do before he crashed. A little homework, and answer today’s Uncle Jay question. He powered through the first then flipped through his inbox for the second. Jamie grinned when he found a message resonate with the talk he’d already had that evening.</p><p>Satisfied with his work, Jamie shut down his computer, spun in his chair. And froze.</p><p>There was an arrow pointed at his nose.</p><p>His eyes crossed to focus on the point, then refocused back up the bolt to the archer. The spirit – it kinda had to be – was a guy in pink with wings. His hair was a riotous mix of bright reds, pinks and magenta, but his red-eyed stare was dark with threat.</p><p>“You have transgressed against me, mortal, and I shall have my due.”</p><p>Jamie gulped.</p>

  <em>A: Seems we have a case of opposites attract, NERD. I say give it a shot. If a “nerd” can admire art, why can’t an “artiste” appreciate physics? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>First thing to you need to remember is that neither of you are flat characters and just your labels. If all you see him as is an artist (and even worse, some stereotypical one) it’s not going to work. And also for your own sake remember you’re more than just a physics nerd. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>As for getting his attention, well, you’re going to have to venture out of your science cave. If he has an exhibition, go. If he’s answering questions talk with him about his art. If there’s no exhibition I’m sorry but you’re going to have to approach him wherever it is he caught your attention. I’m guessing the Student Union or a café of some sort? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>If you’re feeling brave, ask him out for coffee. If not, ask him anyway. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’m not saying ask him to be your boyfriend straight away. While one-coffee-date relationships happen, they’re prone to burn out. Get to know each other first. Might turn out you clash. As I always say, trust is the foundation of any relationship.</em>
