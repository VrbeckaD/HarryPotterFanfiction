          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Can you believe it’s only been five years? It feels like a lifetime ago.”</p><p>“Does it?” Harry said, distracted, searching the sea of prominent guests for a glimpse of platinum-blond hair. “Still feels like yesterday to me.”</p><p>And it really did. Especially this time of year, when everyone insisted on bringing it all up to the surface again.</p><p>“You can’t possibly mean that,” said the cheerful woman – <em> Sarah, was it? </em> – “We’re living in a brand-new world, full of possibilities – all thanks to you, Mr Potter.”</p><p>She smiled, raising her champagne flute with a wink and Harry dutifully mirrored the gesture.</p><p>“It was hardly a one-man feat,” he said tersely, wondering when his Auror partner had disappeared. Harry hadn’t seen him since before the speeches and he was starting to get worried.</p><p>“Oh, no need to be modest,” she said. “Everyone knows you’re a hero.”</p><p><em> Every year </em> , Harry thought, resigned. <em> What wouldn’t I give to be able to just be myse– </em> He nearly flinched as Sarah – <em> Sandra? </em> – took hold of his biceps. <em> And why must they always touch me? </em></p><p>“I’m sorry, er…” – <em> Sacha? </em> – “…but I have to– I need to…”</p><p>Harry didn’t even bother to come up with an excuse, didn’t even bother giving the vivacious woman a backwards glance as he left her standing there, in the middle of the Ministry atrium.</p><p>The door to their joint office was slightly ajar, a slit of light spilling out across the dark department floor. Harry pushed it open to find Malfoy seated on the floor, back against the wall, cradling a bottle of wine in his hands and looking worse than Harry’d ever seen him since the war.</p><p>“You know, too much alcohol can be damaging for your highly esteemed brain cells.”</p><p>Malfoy huffed and slanted his head to glance at his partner. “I hate this day.”</p><p>“Me too,” Harry said softly, walking up to him and sitting down by his side.</p><p>Malfoy offered him the bottle, some really posh and heady red wine, and Harry accepted it gratefully, taking a long swig before leaning his head back against the wall.</p><p>Yes, he hated it. But sitting here, next to Malfoy, somehow made it easier to cope.</p></div>
