    <p>The first time Hermione meets her, Bellatrix is wearing a calfskin mini skirt and a black tank top.</p>
<p>Hermione wants to be angry, but her legs are too long and cleavage too distracting. She was standing in the doorway, hair braided prettily over her shoulder, staring at Hermione blankly, and after too long passed, she blew a large, blue bubble and sucked it back into her mouth with a loud 'pop.' Her lipstick didn't smudge and her expression didn't change.</p>
<p>"We're atheists," she remarked.</p>
<p>Hermione blinked. "What?"</p>
<p>"You're spreading the word, aren't you? A Mormon or something." She shifted her weight to one leg, bare foot sliding up the side of her ankle and toes bending on the floor. She popped her gum again.</p>
<p>Hermione wasn't sure if she should be offended or not, because she was so <em>distracted</em>.</p>
<p>Bellatrix folded her arms under her chest.</p>
<p>"Holy hell," Hermione breathed, looking down the street to see if Remus or James were on their way.</p>
<p>"Oh," she said shortly. "You're one of his little freak friends, aren't you? Sirius'." She smirked. "You must be. The one that little grunt of a boy is always panting about."</p>
<p>"Is Sirius here, or?"</p>
<p>She stepped to the side- sort of, at least. She gave Hermione just enough room to brush by her, their bodies grazing over the threshold, before putting her arm up to block the way. Pushing the door closed, she said, "I'm Bellatrix."</p>
<p>Hermione blinked, attempting to meet her eyes but instead focusing on her nose.</p>
<p>"Sirius' cousin."</p>
<p>"Obviously," Hermione managed, feeling as though her heart was in her throat.</p>
<p>And it <em>was</em> obvious. She had seen photos of Bellatrix before, but nothing had prepared Hermione for meeting her. She and Sirius had the same heavily-lidded bedroom eyes, hers so dark they seemed to eat away at the dim light of the entry hall, and the same black, perfectly curly hair, thick and full and- this was all on <em>top </em>of being too good looking and alluring for their own good.</p>
<p>Hermione sucked a deep breath in, realizing that she was closer now. The air around them was sugary-sweet and dangerous, charged with so much energy that Hermione was grateful that Bellatrix had her crowded against the wall because her knees felt weak and head heavy.</p>
<p>It was a strange feeling, not being able to even breath comfortably in front of another woman, and as she attempted to work through it, she became increasingly aware of the gentle weight of Bellatrix's forearm on her shoulder, hand still pressed against the wall behind her. It only served to make matters worse.</p>
<p>Hermione jumped when Bellatrix popped another bubble. Her lips stretched into a slow, pretty smirk, and Hermione followed the quirk of her mouth to the dimple pressed into her cheek, eyes smoothing down her neck for good measure. She shifted, shoulders moving attractively, and Hermione swore mentally, flinching when Bellatrix's thumb drew over her cheek in a barely there touch.</p>
<p>"Don't touch me."</p>
<p>She chuckled, a soft sound in the back of her throat that made Hermione feel so small and fragile and desperate. "Keep your eyes to yourself then, little one."</p>
