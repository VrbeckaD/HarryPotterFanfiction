</p><p>Stare then Kiss</p><p> </p><p>T - "Luna. Stop that."</p><p> </p><p>L - "I thought it felt good to be looked at? It means you're worthy enough of their attention."</p><p> </p><p>T - "O-okay, but you're <em>staring</em>. It's making me uncomfortable."</p><p> </p><p>L - "But you're really beautiful, Theodore!"</p><p> </p><p>T - "Thank you. Ha! However, a little <em>someone</em> in this room is more beautiful than I am. Do you want to take a guess?"</p><p> </p><p>L - "A game, so exciting! Hm, Draco Malfoy? His eyes are really silver, and his features go wonderfully pleasant when he's genuinely happy. He also has the softest lips—Ouch, It hurts, Theo. I think you grabbed my wrist too hard."</p><p> </p><p>T - "Really Luna? <em>Draaaco</em> <em>Maaalfoy</em>? Soft lips? You want to kiss Malfoy now? Fine then. Do it."</p><p> </p><p>L - "Oh that's not nice, Theodore. Your face has been contorting in a lot of weird ways recently; must be the nargles again! Let me just wear these glasses— Yup, plenty! Come on, happy thoughts!"</p><p> </p><p>T - "Hmph! You like Malfoy's lips more than mine."</p><p> </p><p>L - "They <em>do</em> look softer than yours."</p><p> </p><p>T - "What?! Fine then, kiss his lips if you think they're so soft."</p><p> </p><p>L - "Theodore, you're so funny!"</p><p> </p><p>T - "What in the— Luna— I don't—"</p><p> </p><p>L - "His lips may look soft, but I already have sweetest, most loving and most tender ones all for myself."</p><p> </p><p>T - "Luna, that doesn't even make any sense— Oh."</p><p> </p><p>L - "There, now your face is beautiful again! Oh, it's rather red. You've been stuttering too. Are you feeling sick?"</p><p> </p><p>T - "N-no, Lovegood! You kissed me, that's all."</p><p> </p><p>L - "And you enjoyed it."</p><p> </p><p>T - "Sometimes I hate your bluntness."</p><p> </p><p>L - "Sometimes you love it too. The nargles are really confusing you today. I just remembered, Theo! You still haven't told me who is more beautiful than you— Oh."</p><p> </p><p>T - "Aren't my lips the best in the world?"</p><p><br/>

L - "So it's your lips?"</p><p> </p><p>T - "W-what? Luna, you're really—it's <em>you</em>, silly! "</p></div>
