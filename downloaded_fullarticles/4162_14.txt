“Yeah, a bit. But don’t worry, I’ll take care of you. It’s not my first time, after all.”<br/>
“Yeah, but it’s MY first time, scarhead!”<br/>
“Listen. It will hurt, you’ll feel it a lot. But I have everything nearby so it’s not too bad.”<br/>
“Will I bleed?”<br/>
“Not If I do it right.”<br/>
“What DO you do right?”<br/>
“listen, you little shit—‘<br/>
“Sorry! Sorry! Jeez, Louise, don’t get your panties in a knot, I’m really stressed. And you know my coping mechanism.”<br/>
Harry sighed. Of course he did.<br/>
“How was your first time?” asked Draco, almost shy.<br/>
“I was really nervous. I was shaking really bad and I cried.”<br/>
“Ah! You little bitch. . .”<br/>
“Shut up, Elsa.”<br/>
“I hate that movie! I don’t even look like her!”<br/>
“Not the point. My first time scared me a lot. But the dude knew what he was doing. And it went really well. So don’t worry.”<br/>
“You won’t laugh at me?”<br/>
“No.”<br/>
“And I won’t bleed?”<br/>
“No.”<br/>
“And if I cry, you won’t tell?”<br/>
“Not a soul. I’ll take real good care of you, babe.”<br/>
Harry loved how much it calmed Draco when he used his little nickname. He took the blond in his arm, feeling the stress float away.<br/>
“Do you trust me, Draco?”<br/>
“Yeah.”<br/>
“Well, then, let’s take off your shirt.”<br/>
“Take yours off too.”<br/>
“Of course I will.”<br/>
Draco moved from the warm embrace and took off his shirt with shaking hands. When he looked, Harry was already shirtless, to his great pleasure.<br/>
“Okay, Draco, you will want to lay down. I’ll go slow for you.”<br/>
Draco sat down on the bed and started to look everywhere to change his mind, not noticing that his leg was shaking like crazy until he felt a hot hand on his knee.<br/>
“Calm down.”<br/>
“For your information, I am always really calm.”<br/>
“I can see that. . .”<br/>
“Shut the fuck up, shit face.”<br/>
“Yeah, yeah. You ready, baby? I’m about to start.”<br/>
“I’m not sure if it’s a good idea, anymore.”<br/>
“I’ll be gentle. Take a big breath.”<br/>
Draco breathed in and held it. Suddenly, a loud buzzing sound filled the room. A hot hand pressed on his chest, urging him to lay on his back. The blond closed his eyes and let out a shaky breath when a sharp pain hit him on his left pec.<br/>
Half an hour later, the buzzing stopped, but not the pain. The warm hand left his chest and a soft pair of lips placed the lightest of kisses on the tip of his nose. He opened his teary eyes and looked at Harry.<br/>
"All done, beautiful!” said harry, handing Draco a tissue. “Do you want to see it?”<br/>
Draco wiped the tears out of his eyes, nodding at the same time. Harry smiled and took a mirror. He gave it to Draco, who hurried to look a this chest. He felt his heart stop before starting to beat again, like he just ran a marathon. Right there, on his pale skin, a heart was tattooed. It was asymmetrical and the curves were graceful and light.<br/>
Harry came next to him, posing his chin on his boyfriend’s shoulder.<br/>
“Do you like it?”<br/>
“I . . . I love it! It’s amazing! And you did it . . . freestyle, wow, it’s beautiful!”<br/>
“Not as much as you, you know.”<br/>
Draco laughed softly. Harry put a cream and a bandage over the irritated skin and the blond then leaned against Harry’s heavily tattooed body. He passed a finger on a tattoo similar to the one he just got.<br/>
“Hey . . . we got matching tattoos. . .”<br/>
“Yeah. Just like that Katy Perry song.”<br/>
“Do you know what would be best?”<br/>
“What?”<br/>
“Matching rings.”<br/>
“One day, baby, I promise, I’ll buy you a rock the size of our love.”<br/>
“Jupiter is not for sale.”<br/>
“I said our love, not your ego.”<br/>
The boys laughed and pushed each other lightly before laying down, cuddling like two penguins that were cold.<br/>
“Harry?”<br/>
“Yeah, babe?”<br/>
“I love you.”<br/>
“I love you too. Draco.”</p></div>
