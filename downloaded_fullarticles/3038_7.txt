    <p align="left">Newt has been in the hospital for three weeks. Percival visits him daily and talks until he loses his voice. In those three weeks, with thanks to Maurice Milton, over a dozen of Collins’ followers have been arrested and put behind bars. Most of them were found to have prior offenses or unpaid fines to supplement the <em>conspiring against law enforcement </em>charges they have now been pinned with. It feels damned good to be crossing names off the list and each man arrested seems more and more willing to sell out those still at large. Perhaps that has something to do with Percival’s merciless reputation and the way he stares down at each man in interrogation with cold black eyes that fill them with incomprehensible dread.</p>
<p>It is also possible that Percival has become a bit meaner lately, but no one is brave enough to say so to his face.</p>
<p>“You’ve become a lot meaner lately,” Picquery says bluntly to Percival’s face. She knows she is the only person who can tell him this without unleashing his newly increased ire. All Percival can do is scowl at her and wait for her to get to real reason she called him to her office.</p>
<p>“I’m not complaining,” she continues. “In the last three weeks we’ve dismantled almost the entire following of a gang that you’ve been after for months. I’m impressed, truly.”</p>
<p>Behind Picquery, the portrait of President Jackson is nodding somberly along with the conversation as if he has any real concept of what they are discussing. As a painting, Jackson misses out on a lot of contextual information and relies solely on what he witnesses in the office and on what Picquery choses to tell him. Percival does his best not to glare at the late President Jackson and sully the man’s good opinion of him, which has always been a point of pride for the Director.</p>
<p>“However,” says Picquery and now her expression is stern in a way that means she is very serious, “yesterday you made one of the Juniors cry and I know that crosses a personal line with you.”</p>
<p><em>Damn</em>. The Junior was Simmons, too, if Percival remembers correctly. She had quoted a date incorrectly in a report and Percival had lectured her on the importance of fact checking, because mistakes like these can lead to the wrong man being punished. He supposes he had gone on a bit longer than necessary and he can’t hear his own voice, so there’s no telling how harsh he might’ve sounded with her.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Percival agrees. He tries to make a point of always encouraging and teaching the Juniors, as they are still learning and adjusting. Once they’ve graduated to full Auror, he stops holding back because now they ought to know better. He should probably apologize to Simmons. “I’ll speak to her.”</p>
<p>Seraphina arches an elegant eyebrow at him and Percival rolls his eyes.</p>
<p>“<em>Gently</em>,” he insists. “I’ll speak to her <em>gently</em>. Honestly, woman.”</p>
<p>“Don’t <em>woman</em> me, Mr. Graves,” chides Seraphina.</p>
<p>“My deepest apologies, Madam President,” Percival shoots back.</p>
<p>“Save that for Simmons.” Picquery waves her hand dismissively at Percival. “That’ll be all, Director. Go back to scaring your criminals.”</p>
<p>“Right away, Madam President,” he says smartly and then turns sharply to ensure he has the last word. He checks his watch and decides to duck out a few minutes early for lunch. As Percival passes by the bullpen, he sees Simmons hunched at her desk with Quailfoot perched on the desktop beside her, heads bent close.</p>
<p>“Simmons,” Percival barks and watches the two women jump apart, Quailfoot with her hand to her heart. “With me.”</p>
<p>Simmons’s eyes widen and Quailfoot gives her arm a fortifying squeeze. Percival tries not to frown too deeply lest he give Simmons the wrong impression, he doesn’t want the poor girl to think she is about to be fired for making one easily caught error in a report. He maintains his brisk pace, watching from the corner of his eye as Simmons hurries out of the bullpen. He loses sight of her as she rounds the filing cabinets, but Daphne nudges his neck on the right side to assure him that the Junior is following at his heels.</p>
<p>Daphne bumps him again to let him know Simmons is speaking to him and glances at her over his shoulder. He catches <em>sorry </em>and <em>do better </em>and says, “You’re not in trouble in trouble, Simmons. You don’t need to apologize for anything.”</p>
<p>As they enter the atrium and approach the front doors of the building, Daphne shrinks and curls herself under the collar of his shirt, out of sight, but still able to perform her duty. Percival pulls a door open and holds it for Simmons and then resumes the lead out on the sidewalk. He takes her to Kowalski’s because it’s just far enough from the Woolworth building to make it unlikely to cross paths with any who might recognize them. The bakery has reached a peculiar balance where it is equally popular amongst no-majs and wizardkind and the two somehow blend seamlessly within the walls of the shop. Natural caution has witches and wizards tucking their wands away and temporarily freezing their animated accessories when out and about, so there is nothing to tip off the non-wizards. To all, the bakery is simply a bakery of unique and delicious treats.</p>
<p>Jacob is at the counter when Percival enters, holding the door once again for Simmons. The lunch rush seems to have just begun, because the line is thick and impatient, but Percival sees Jacob direct an assistant to set aside a niffler scone and an occamy Danish.</p>
<p>“Have you been here before?” he asks Simmons.</p>
<p>She is looking around in bewilderment, but some of her confusion lessens when she sees the display of erumpent loaves. She shakes her head, “No, but Verity has brought me bread from here.”</p>
<p>Percival nods. He watches Jacob step away from the register, leaving it to another assistant, and then the no-maj waves Percival up to the front. Percival ignores the scathing expressions from those still buried near the back of the line and guides Simmons to the front with a light touch at her elbow.</p>
<p>Jacob tends to get flighty and anxious when Percival is around—understandable considering their first meeting and the fact that Percival has come by maybe twice more since and always with Newt—but he’s a genial man and easily likeable. In the months that his bakery has been open, the place has evolved to include a little sitting area and a few simple teas and coffees have been added to the menu. Business is flourishing; Percival learns all about it from Queenie, beaming with pride and adoration for her tentative boyfriend.</p>
<p>“Afternoon, Mr. Graves,” says Jacob, setting down a pair of plates with the pastries sitting on little paper napkins.</p>
<p>“Mr. Kowalski,” Percival says in return with a slight nod. He reaches into his pocket for his wallet, grateful that he always keep a bit of no-maj currency on hand in case of emergencies, but Jacob waves his hands.</p>
<p>“No, no, on the house, Mr. Graves,” Jacob insists.</p>
<p>Percival smiles slightly. “Thank you, that’s very kind.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure, you know me,” says Jacob, rocking awkwardly on his feet. “How’s Newt?”</p>
<p>Percival’s smile slides away. “Better than he was,” he murmurs. “They think they have finally removed the last of it.”</p>
<p>The phrasing is vaguely cryptic, entirely bland so as to reveal nothing, but Percival knows that Queenie has been keeping Jacob up to date on Newt’s condition. He’s a smart man, he’ll understand what Percival is saying. Indeed, Jacob nods and his mouth pulls into a wry upturn.</p>
<p>“That’s. That’s good.” Jacob rubs the back of his neck. “Have a good day now, Mr. Graves.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mr. Kowalski.” Percival takes the plates and leads Simmons to the little tables by the window at the front of the shop. He can feel Simmons staring at him in amazement; irrefutable proof that your stoic, ill-tempered boss has an actual life outside of work always takes time to process. He sets down the plates and then seats himself, keeping the occamy Danish for himself and nudging the niffler scone towards the chair opposite him. Simmons sits hurriedly and then, catching sight of the scone, grins at the pastry with delight.</p>
<p>“It’s a niffler,” she says.</p>
<p>“Well spotted,” Percival says idly, cutting the Danish in half and then wiping the residual blackberry jam along the flaky side of the pastry snake. He takes a bite and sighs contentedly. Simmons glances around as if expecting this to some kind of prank or set up and then hesitantly breaks off a piece of scone and pops it into her mouth. Her eyes flutter blissfully.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of eating in silence, Percival wipes the corners of his mouth with his napkin and says, “I want to apologize for the way I spoke to you yesterday. It was a minor error in paperwork and I was unnecessarily harsh.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” shapes Simmons, eyebrows near her hairline in surprise. “That’s… You weren’t <em>that </em>bad…”</p>
<p>“I was an ass, Simmons,” Percival says frankly and the Junior’s eyes go wide, confirming that his Aurors have been saying as much amongst themselves these days. “I am aware of my reputation and what is said of me in the office, but I generally try to reserve the worst of my temper for the more experienced Aurors. They are at a point where I can yell at them for screwing up when they ought to know better and I won’t feel bad when I upset them. You, on the other hand, are still green, still learning the ropes of how MACUSA operates, and I should not have shouted at you like I did. I’m very sorry.”</p>
<p>Simmons bites her lip and nods earnestly. “Thank you, sir.” Percival watches her steel herself before saying, “Verity told me about when she got her hands messed up by that artefact at the black market raid. It was ages ago, but she still talks about it sometimes. About how you were real kind to her and made her wanna keep being an Auror. I, well, I guess I felt real let down when, yesterday, you were…an ass.”</p>
<p>Simmons immediately ducks her head, eyes nearly popping out of her head in disbelief at herself for <em>calling her boss an ass to his face</em>. Percival chuckles and that makes Simmons’s eyes bulge somehow further.</p>
<p>“Relax, you’re not in trouble. I’ll let it slide just this once because of unusual circumstances,” Percival assures her. “I hope that I’ve made up for contradicting what Quailfoot lead you to expect.”</p>
<p>Simmons manages a small smile. “You have, sir. Thank you. And I know things have been crazy at work, things have been crazy for a while, but lately it’s all been even crazier.” She shrugs and just like that all is forgiven. They finish their pastries in comfortable quiet. And then, just before they rise to leave, Simmons speaks up with a tentative question, “Newt… Is that the English guy Tina’s friends with? The one who got attacked last month?”</p>
<p>Percival swallows thickly. “He is.”</p>
<p>Simmons twists her fingers nervously together. “Are you and he…?” She trails off, too afraid to ask and risk offending her boss, but Percival arches a brow that dares her to go on. “It’s just that I see him go into your office a lot with lunch and I’ve noticed him a few times in the atrium and realized he was waiting for you when I saw you two leave together a coupla times. So, I thought, maybe, you were…”</p>
<p>Percival takes mercy and simply says, “Yes.” And then, before Simmons can even think about trying to ask more, says, “Come along now. Back to work.”</p>
<p>When they arrive back at the Woolworth building and have reached Investigations, Simmons immediately trots off to Quailfoot’s desk, likely to tell her everything that has just transpired. Percival doesn’t mind having a softer reputation amongst Juniors, because he knows it will change quite thoroughly once they are promoted.</p>
<p>In his office, Percival sifts through interrogation transcripts and checks that he has all known safehouses marked on his map of the city. He idly confirms that his information regarding Collins’s following is up to date and then heads down to interrogation to check Lynch’s progress with their latest arrestee. Collins’s lackies like to snarl and throw insults at Percival whenever they see him. Percival and his colleagues find great amusement in the way their faces scrunch up with offense when he fails to respond the way they want him to.</p>
<p>Presently, Lynch is interrogating a gaunt, rather frightening-looking woman who sits with rigid posture and her hands clasped atop the table. She doesn’t appear to be responding to Lynch or even looking at him and Lynch is clearly becoming increasingly frustrated.</p>
<p>“Director Graves, sir,” says Auror Ivan McCutcheon, who transferred from Boston with Strenburg, relief evident on his face. “We’ve been at this for hours, but <em>Mrs. Grundy* </em>over here won’t budge.”</p>
<p>Percival narrows his eyes at the woman thoughtfully. She has a wide, vaguely frog-like mouth and an upturned nose that give her a constant expression of displeasure. Though, considering the cause she has chosen to commit herself to, constant displeasure might just be the norm for her. Percival checks his coat pocket for his notepad and palms it, he’ll need to read what she says to him—if she chooses to say anything at all. Then he raps sharply on the door before letting himself in.</p>
<p>Lynch glances over and acknowledged him with a curt nod. The woman, however, stares at him and something uncomfortably like glee comes over her narrow face. Percival glances at her dismissively as he enters, focusing instead on standing by Lynch’s shoulder and taking up the sparse file they have on her.</p>
<p>“Ethel Umbridge,” he reads. “British native. Hogwarts graduate. Slytherin, I presume?”</p>
<p>He spares her another passing look, long enough to catch her mouth twisting smugly and making an <em>aw </em>shape. He assumes she has just corrected him with her actual House of Ravenclaw and replies with a disinterested, “Hm,” as he lowers his eyes back to the paper. He sits and taps the corner of his notepad on the table; Daphne grows half a foot under the collar of his coat, subtle, but enough movement to draw attention to herself. Ethel Umbridge wrinkles her nose distastefully at the occamy.</p>
<p>“So, tell me,” he says, leaning casually in his chair and resting his notepad on his leg, angled so he can see it where it is hidden under the table. Lynch could probably see it, too, if he cared to look over, but Percival is confident he’ll be able to hide in plain sight, so to speak. “Why does a British witch care about an American wizard with a grudge?”</p>
<p>Umbridge’s wide mouth and accent make her difficult for Percival to understand, but he’s become adept at reading written words very quickly.</p>
<p><em>You’re the cake-eater* he’s always whinging about, </em>she says. <em>The infamous Director Graves who spent six months having tea with Grindelwald.</em></p>
<p>Percival raises an unimpressed eyebrow at the woman and pointedly says nothing. Umbridge is undeterred by his lack of response, however, and goes on.</p>
<p>
  <em>Have you heard the rumors that Grindelwald has a, shall we say, similar taste as you, Director? When it comes to bedmates, I mean.</em>
</p>
<p>Collins’s followers seem to share a bewildering fascination with Percival’s sexuality. So far, there hasn’t been a single interrogation in which it isn’t brought up and they always, <em>always</em>, use the same no-maj slur. It’s getting very tiresome and Percival isn’t sure what they hoped to accomplish by repeatedly bringing it up. Alienation from his colleagues, perhaps? If none of his Aurors knew before, they certainly do now, but none of them have so much as blinked in response to this revelation. Why, it’s almost like none of them care; almost as though homosexuality or bisexuality is something the wizarding world doesn’t give a damn about.</p>
<p>Beside him, Lynch grumbles under his breath and the words appear on Percival’s notepad as, <em>Yeah, so you’ve fucking said, ya bluenose.*</em></p>
<p>Clearly, the rest of the department is getting sick of it, too. Percival sighs and straightens up in his chair.</p>
<p>“Very well, I have better things to do with my time.” He stands and smooths down the front of his jacket, keeping his notepad in hand. “Ms. Umbridge, you’re being deported. A Ministry official will be arriving this evening to collect you.”</p>
<p>As he steps to the door, he feels the notepad warm slightly in his hand, indicating that something further has been said. He glances at it while reaching for the knob—<em>It’s a shame about Scamander</em>—and his blood runs cold. Percival gives no outward reaction, just continues out of the room and shuts the door firmly behind himself. He nods curtly at McCutcheon and then strides briskly to the lift. He doesn’t bother going all the way back up to his office for his coat, he instead goes directly to the ground floor and makes immediately for the sanctioned Apparition point. He doesn’t use it often, doesn’t normally mind walking outside for a stretch before Apparating home from a discrete alleyway, but these are extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p>
  <em>It’s a shame about Scamander.</em>
</p>
<p>He Apparates directly to St. Agatha’s and marches to Newt’s room with such a stormy expression that Healers and visitors alike dodge out of his way. As he approaches Newt’s door, his heart begins to hammer in his chest as sudden anxiety burbles up and threatens to consume him. He doesn’t know what he’ll find on the other side of this door. It could be the same sight that has greeted him for three weeks or it could be something infinitely worse.</p>
<p>The rational part of his mind reminds him that he would have been contacted immediately if something good or bad happened. It also reminds him that Newt has been in stable condition for a while now and has, in fact, shown signs of improvement over the last four days.</p>
<p>Theseus Scamander, whom Queenie has been in somewhat regular contact with while she works on revising Rappaport’s Law, wrote Percival just the other day asking if it is possible to transfer Newt to St. Mungo’s. Perhaps the elder Scamander got tired of waiting for Percival’s reply (which he hasn’t written, because the thought of Newt being so far out of reach sometimes makes his hands shake too much to hold a pen) and used his right as a blood relative to authorize and enact the transfer. Perhaps the bed on the other side of this door will be empty.</p>
<p>Percival has to pause to take a few steadying breaths before he can make himself twist the knob and open the door. Heart in his throat, he steps inside and looks immediately to the bed and sees—</p>
<p>Everything exactly as it was the last time he visited. Newt is deep asleep, blankets drawn to his hips and fizzling bandages wrapped around his torso. He has regained much of his color over the past weeks, his lips are less chalky pale and his veins don’t stand out so starkly anymore. With the help of nourishing potions, Newt has lost little weight and, in fact, is not nearly as slim as Percival has seen him in the past when he is fresh from a stint in a jungle or a desert.</p>
<p>Relief washes over Percival and drags him down heavily into the chair at Newt’s beside. He lets out a long breath and presses his hand to his face before dragging his fingers through his hair. Daphne nuzzles the underside of his chin and blows a soft huff of breath against his cheek; he fluffs her plumage affectionately.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m losing my mind, darling,” he admits to Newt’s sleeping form. The Healers have supposedly decreased the intensity of the spell keeping him comatose and Newt’s breathing is no longer frighteningly shallow, but Percival is still not allowed to touch. “I just let one of Collins’s followers get to me and she barely even tried. She didn’t even threaten you. All she did was say your name and I dropped everything to come check on you.”</p>
<p>Newt’s fingers twitch on the bedspread. Little movements like this have been happening sporadically for the last five days, abrupt and brief flexing in his fingers and toes and subtle changes in his expression. The magizoologist at last has the appearance of simply being asleep and dreaming.</p>
<p>Percival busies his hands in Daphne’s feathers in an attempt to stop feeling the way they ache for Newt’s.</p>
<p>“Perhaps I should let Theseus transfer you to St. Mungo’s,” he muses dejectedly. “At least that way you’ll be far away from Collins and I won’t be constantly afraid one of his lackies will try to hurt you again.”</p>
<p>Newt’s eyebrows scrunch together, his expression briefly distressed, but then smooths out seconds later. Percival tries not to read anything into this seeming reaction, but it’s like being told not to think about kneazles. Percival sighs and changes the subject.</p>
<p>“Pickett is doing well, all things considered,” he tells Newt. “He stays with Tina primarily. I believe he got tired of sharing my attention with Daphne. Tina is burying herself in work, not that I’m one to talk, but having a companion in your pocket does help quite a bit. So, at least there is that.</p>
<p>“Queenie is upstate with Credence, getting him settled with my parents, and yes, darling, I made sure to send along an extensive copy of your notes on occamys. Darwin will be as well looked-after as Credence, I promise.”</p>
<p>Percival gazes at Newt’s face as if to memorize every detail of it, as if he is seeing the redhead for the first time or for the last time. He takes account of every freckle, most now faded by lack of sunlight, and traces the precise shape of his lips, that shallow cupid’s bow that he has always found so alluring.</p>
<p>“The Healer assigned to you says they’ve managed to counter the last of the hex Milton used on you,” Percival says to the slope of Newt’s nose and the elegant arch of his cheekbones. “Next week, if the wound responds to the suturing spell and stays closed, they’ll lift the coma completely and let you wake on your own time.” Percival’s eyes track the long lines of Newt’s neck, the dip at the base of his throat, and sweep of his collarbones. “I would very much like to be here when you do finally wake,” he says, “but I don’t dare to hope. Either you’ll be in England in your brother’s care or I’ll be out chasing another one of Collins’s damned followers.</p>
<p>“It’s September,” Percival says abruptly. “We’re about halfway through September now. October is a fine enough month, from a work standpoint, until you get to All Hallows Eve. Your <em>muggles </em>go a bit insane on All Hallows Eve and that makes quite a few of our lot get <em>ideas </em>about things. It’s always hell and it’s always a wonder the Statute of Secrecy stays intact. But, Newt, darling, please don’t make me suffer November alone. I’ve been holding myself together, but I do think that would break me.”</p>
<p>Last year, Percival spent the majority of November alone in his own bedroom with a ruined leg and ruined ears, slowly starving to death as Grindelwald’s magic left his system bit by bit. A cruel captor he may have been, but Grindelwald knew exactly how to keep a man alive while stripping him of life and identity. Percival spent six months wishing he would die, but November is the month he truly believed he would and realized how desperately he did not want to.</p>
<p>Newt sighs in his sleep and his face turns slightly towards Percival. In the many months he has known Newt and more so in the months they have been dating, Percival has become accustomed to his burgeoning habit of indulging Newt’s tendency to break the rules. He has even bent a few himself for the sake of Newt’s case and creatures and he does not feel guilty in the least for doing so—which is rather remarkable. So, Percival feels only his love and longing for Newt when he stands and gently cups a hand to Newt’s soft cheek. He feels only the aching void inside his chest when he bends over the cot and brushes his lips to Newt’s forehead and holds them there for a single, eternal moment.</p>
<p>“I love you, darling,” he whispers to Newt’s cool skin. “Please, wake up soon.”</p>
<p>Then he straightens up and leaves without looking back. If he looks back, he might stay in that chair and watch Newt’s face forever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">- - -</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Percival writes to Theseus that afternoon and the next morning, he stops by St. Agatha’s to say goodbye to his still-sleeping lover as a pair of Healers from St. Mungo’s prepare to transport him to London. He comes into work half an hour late with an expression like gathering storm clouds and a white-knuckled grip on his cane. His Aurors take one look at him and suddenly find something elsewhere that is very interesting; only Tina meets his gaze and holds it.</p>
<p>Tina bravely follows Percival to his office and plants herself in the chair across from him. She even has the gall to look at him with clear <em>disappointment</em>. From the breast pocket of her coat, Pickett peers at Percival with accusing beady eyes.</p>
<p>Percival waves his hand at his silver coffee set and it begins to brew enough to fill two cups. The smell of fresh grounds permeates the room and both Aurors take a moment to inhale the heavenly aroma; the moment passes unfortunately quickly. Tina sits firmly upright and speaks with clear enunciation and precise signs.</p>
<p>“You know Newt is going to be furious when he wakes up,” she tells him. “He would not want to be sent away.”</p>
<p>“Goldstein, I didn’t want him ‘sent away,’ as you so gently put it, either,” he replies curtly, “but for the sake of my own sanity, I had to. Collins’s toadies know precisely how much he means to me and I cannot risk them trying to hurt him again. I’d rather have Newt alive and furious with the decision I made than have Newt killed because I failed to make a decision at all.”</p>
<p>Tina purses her lips for a moment and then sighs heavily, her shoulders losing tension and her posture loosening. She says, after a few seconds, “I’ll keep looking after Pickett and the rest of his creatures. Queenie will be back tomorrow, so I’ll have her helping me again soon.”</p>
<p>Percival nods. “Thank you, Tina.”</p>
<p>“In any other situation, I would say you owe me.”</p>
<p>He raises an imperious eyebrow at his underling. “Really.”</p>
<p>Tina does not relent. “Yes, really. As one friend to another, you would owe me.”</p>
<p>The word <em>friend </em>hits Percival like a punch to the gut. He didn’t realize how much he needed that reminder—the reminder that he has friends, has people who have his back, people who will support him and help him—until Tina gives it to him. Despite himself and his agitation, Percival can’t help the small smile that creeps onto his face.</p>
<p>“Get back to work, Goldstein,” he orders and, judging by Tina’s brief expression of amusement before settling back into her work-face, his tone is not nearly as sharp as it would be if he directed those words at anyone else.</p>
<p>Tina rises, snaps off a crisp salute, and then turns sharply on her heel and marches out of the office. Percival rolls his eyes; she is possibly the only Auror who can get away with being insubordinate by being <em>too </em>subordinate. How is it she is his favorite?</p>
<p>Daphne wriggles into his lap and then grows to coil over his legs like a warm, heavy blanket and then stretches up to touch the tip of her beak to his nose.</p>
<p>Ah. That’s how.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">- - -</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The week drags by in an endless cycle of search and interrogation. Every new lead dropped by the lackies in holding was thoroughly investigated and found to be false, bringing everyone back to where they started. It was exhausting and frustrating and Percival is certain his hair is getting grayer from the stress.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a greasy sycophant called Thompson spills a new hideout location in the depths of Hell’s Kitchen and this is the lead that finally comes to fruition. Two more names are crossed off the list of known followers and now only two remain: Frank Wallace and Leland Collins himself.</p>
<p>On Friday, Percival receives an owl from Theseus dated two days ago informing him that Newt’s condition has greatly improved, he is nearly ready to be taken off the sleeping enchantments. This good news carries Percival through the morning and into lunchtime and stays with him while he stands by Tina’s desk and discusses tactics. Tina has assumed a sort of second-in-command role for the Collins Case and has risen to the task very impressively. Once all this is sorted and done, Percival is going to give her a well-deserved, hard-earned pay raise.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask Queenie to stop by on Monday,” says Tina, tapping her pen absently against the notepad open on her desk, “with your permission, of course. If we have her behind the glass while one of us talks to Thompson, maybe she can pick out whatever he isn’t telling us.”</p>
<p>“You’re sure he isn’t telling us something?” asks Sadie Strenburg. She is ever so determined to be Percival’s friend and he would never dare tell her that he is already a touch fond of her; not enough to make him biased or call her a friend, but enough to grant her his occasional favor. She is also, apparently, determined to be the most helpful person working this case and Percival can’t fault her nosiness when she actually is very helpful.</p>
<p>“These guys are always holding something back,” says Tina, distractedly staring at her notes.</p>
<p>“Ask Queenie if she would be willing…” Percival starts, but trails off when Daphne’s head suddenly jerks up from where it was resting on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Quite suddenly, she periscopes off his shoulder and when Percival cranes his neck to look up at her, he sees the crest of feathers about her head are raised defensively. Her beak is open in wide gape as she shrieks with such force that Percival can feel the vibrations of her voice against the side of his head where her body is pressed against his temple and ear. He glances briefly at Tina—who is staring, startled, past Percival—as he turns and—</p>
<p>Even before he finishes turning, Percival feels the heavy grit on his skin and tastes the bitterness on his tongue and fury flares within him. He cannot believe the sheer audacity of—</p>
<p>“Newt?”</p>
<p>Newt is standing several feet away, but it is undeniably him. Dressed in his blue coat and brown boots with his old Hufflepuff scarf hung unevenly from his shoulders. His red curls are wild and gorgeously windswept and his cheeks are chapped from exposure to the wind and it is him. It <em>looks </em>like him. But—</p>
<p>Percival knows the taste and feel of Newt’s magic. Newt’s magic is raw and unbridled like that of his beasts, it is brown earth and red clay and the sweetness of vegetation. It is warm and gentle and absolutely unbreakable.</p>
<p>Percival draws his wand.</p>
<p>This is not Newt.</p>
<p>The imposter takes a shocked step back, mouth dropping open and eyes widening with hurt. Daphne’s shrieks still buzz against the side of Percival’s head and he can feel Tina grasping at his arm, begging for his attention. But this is not Newt.</p>
<p>The fake Newt creeps cautiously forward in a fair mimicry of Newt’s rightward-favoring mannerism, but there’s a tenseness about his shoulders that give him away. If he weren’t so attuned to the magical signatures of individuals, Percival could almost believe this imitation, could almost explain away the tenseness as a result of recent trauma. But he is and he knows better. Percival points his wand steadily at the imposter’s head.</p>
<p>“Percy,” shapes the man wearing his lover’s face. Percival is proud of the way he does not flinch at that hated nickname and he is proud of how his extended arm and raised wand do not waver. He is also proud of Tina, who stops tugging on his coat and instead refocuses on calming Daphne.</p>
<p>“Percy, it’s me,” the imposter says again. “I’ve come straight from St. Agatha’s. I thought you’d be pleased to see me.”</p>
<p>It’s like the man isn’t even trying, hasn’t even bothered to do proper research and reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Daphne shrinks around Percival’s shoulders, no longer vibrating with screams and her beak finally closed, but her feathers are still fluffed with agitation. Her wings keep tickling the back of Percival’s neck and her talons have sunk through the layers of his clothing and are prickling his skin. She is upset by this creature who looks like Newt, but smells and feels all wrong and it is making her forget her training. Percival keeps his eyes locked on the fake Newt even as he uses his free hand to gesture for Tina to remove Daphne from his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Stealth and disguise were never your strong suit, Collins,” Percival says darkly. “You never had the patience to study a person long enough to fully embody them.”</p>
<p>Merlin help him, the bastard was still trying to maintain the act, pulling Newt’s face into something too wide-eyed and innocent, a caricature of confusion. “What do you mean? Sweetheart…”</p>
<p>“You must stop,” Percival interrupts, “you’re embarrassing yourself.”</p>
<p>The ruse drops from Collins-as-Newt’s shoulders and his lover’s face is pulled into a wicked smirk. “Yeah, okay, you know your onions. That’s on me for thinking I could pull off your little Brit bearcat*, but I’m understaffed right now and I had his blood on hand. It seemed like berries to me.”</p>
<p>The confidence rolling off Collins is incongruent with the situation he has placed himself in. He is surrounded by Aurors in a building you cannot Apparate in or out of and he has no backup. Something isn’t right.</p>
<p>“Does it still seem like berries?” Percival retorts, mind racing to deduce Collins’s plans, to unravel his thinking, because he can’t just be this stupid. “You’re surrounded. You have no way to escape and nowhere to go.”</p>
<p>“Details,” Collins shrugs. He has straightened out of Newt’s uneven posture and has stuffed his hands carelessly into the pockets of Newt’s jacket. He glances at the clock on the wall as he swaggers closer and seems to grow even more smug the nearer he comes to Percival.</p>
<p>“You ain’t gonna hex me,” he tells Percival with maddening sureness. “I’ve got your sheik’s face on and under all that gruff, tough bullshit you’re just a big pushover. Ain’tcha, Gravesy.”</p>
<p>Percival curls his lip. “What makes you so sure?”</p>
<p>Collins-as-Newt shrugs nonchalantly. “’Cause I’m wearing your boyfriend’s face and you wouldn’t do nothing to hurt him.”</p>
<p>“Stop right there,” Percival grinds out. “You are under arrest for conspiracy, attempted murder on multiple counts, illegal use of the Undetectable Extension Charm in a no-maj populated area—”</p>
<p>Collins rolls Newt’s eye exasperatedly.</p>
<p>“…the illegal importation of a dangerous creature, improper use of magic on a no-maj vehicle—"</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah,” Collins interrupts impatiently, creeping a few more steps forward.</p>
<p>“Strenburg,” Percival barks and Sadie darts out from around him, wand drawn with a hand binding spell on her lips. Collins flicks his wand in her direction and Strenburg’s mouth drops open in a shout as she is sent flying sideways. From the corner of his eye, Percival sees her impact the broad side of a filing cabinet and slump the ground, unmoving. He presses forward, twirls his wand in tight, precise circles and has Collins’s feet snapping together.</p>
<p>Collins is unbalanced, but he maintains the presence of mind to throw his weight forward directly at Percival, forcing the Director to either step back or catch him. Instinctually, Percival reaches forward and catches the other man. He sees a brief glimpse of a sharp smile that does not suit Newt’s gentle face and feels his stomach drop in dreadful premonition, but it’s too late.</p>
<p>Collins still has a hand in his pocket and he pulls it out in that instant to reveal a battered cigarette case. A Portkey.</p>
<p>“Shi—” Percival swears as the hook of Portkey travel sinks through his navel. He tries to rear back, to break contact between him and Collins, tries to rationalize that he is not physically touching the object and therefore safe, but the world begins to blur around him. A horrible pain lances down his right leg and he distantly hears the clatter of wood on marble and thinks it must be his wand, as it is no longer in his hand and then…</p>
<p>Harsh clarity. Focus slams into him moments before he is slammed to the floor. Groaning, Percival tries to lever himself up onto his knees and immediately crumples to his side as his right leg flares with fiery pain. His eyes water, his head throbs, and he is extremely disoriented.</p>
<p>Scuffed boots step into his line of sight. Newt’s scuffed boots. An automatic surge of relief rushes through him and then sours into fury when he remembers. Percival forces himself to sit up and throws out his hand, sending Collins-as-Newt careening through the air and crashing into a wall some ten feet away.</p>
<p>The back of his neck prickles. Percival lurches awkwardly to his feet and staggers as he turns to face Frank Wallace. Wallace is bulky and his eyes are small, squinty, and his magic smells like old leather and feels like sand running through fingers. His mouth moves, but he hitches up the corner of his mouth when he speaks and it makes him unreadable—particularly in this high stress situation.</p>
<p>Magic is centralizing around Wallace’s wand, gathering and forming into a body-binding spell, and Percival is quick to throw his own magic out to disperse the spell before it fully forms. Wallace blinks stupidly when his spell stops abruptly and looks at his wand as if it is responsible. Percival takes advantage of the distraction to swipe his arm hard to the side and magically launch Wallace in the same direction. Without his wand, Percival’s magic is less precise and the amount of adrenalin running through his system makes it easiest to perform simple, inelegant spells. Pushing and throwing and forcibly dispersing another’s magic are things Percival has been able to do wandlessly for decades.</p>
<p>Grit and bitterness rises behind him and Percival whips around to counter whatever Collins is sending his way—but the movement jars his leg. Percival shouts hoarsely as his right knee gives out and halfway through falling, Collins’s spell slams into his chest.</p>
<p>Paralyzed, Percival gasps for air as he stares at a high ceiling and a grid of rafters netted with cobwebs. He could be anywhere, he realizes, and he is without his wand or his occamy, in the company of his worst enemy. Newt is recuperating in England and Percival has no way of contacting his Aurors or his friends and Portkey travel is notoriously difficult to track. There is no saying how long it will take them to find him or even <em>if </em>they manage to find him.</p>
<p>Newt’s face hovers above his, grinning viciously in a way so unlike his magizoologist that it makes Percival’s stomach churn. He hunkers down on the balls of his feet, arms resting on his knees, and stares down at Percival while he pointedly twirls his wand in his hand. Collins speaks with Newt’s voice but his own American accent, “Oh, Percy, we are going to have so much fun together.”</p>
