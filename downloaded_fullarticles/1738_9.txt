    <p>“Are you sure that this is alright, Andi? I could shorten the trip or maybe take the two of you with me if you’d like to come?”</p><p>Voldemort was finally dead. The vast majority of the Death Eaters were captured. A deal had been made with the goblins, and Harry Potter was about to take the very first vacation that he had ever been on. The only problem that Harry had with this was that he did not want to leave his godson, Teddy, behind while he went off to America.</p><p>“Yes, Harry. I am absolutely sure that we will be fine,” Andromeda Tonks replied patiently, “You deserve a break after the war, and I can manage to take care of Teddy for a month without your help. While you have been an amazing father to Teddy, you’re still a young man! You need to go out an see the world a bit more and take some time to relax, and you can’t do either of those with Teddy and I along for the ride. Now you better get moving, or you’re going to be late for your flight.”</p><p>While there were international portkeys and even international floos, Harry had decided that this trip was going to be entirely muggle. He felt that it was high time to get back in touch with his muggle side, and to that end had managed to work towards getting both his A-Levels and his muggle driver’s license over the past year. The only magical artifacts that Harry even planned on bringing on this trip were his invisibility cloak (which his paranoia and PTSD wouldn’t let him leave the house without), his wands, both Holly and Elder, and Sirius’s shrunken motorcycle so he did not have to rent a car once he got to America.</p><p>“Alright. Alright. I’ll go. Just call me if you need anything. You and Teddy are more important than some vacation that I can always go on some other time,” Harry said, as he went out the door, shrunken bags in side of the backpack that he had gotten to seem normal to the other passengers.</p><p align="center">-----------------------------</p><p>After apparating to Heathrow Airport and going through security, Harry decided he had enough time to grab a bite to eat before queuing up to get onto the plane. With both the money that his parents had left him and the bounty that he had received for taking out Voldemort, Harry had more that enough money to get first class for the long flight from London to Washington D.C. After loading onto the plane, he noticed that he ended up sitting next to a woman a few years older than him of Israeli descent who was sorting through some files that he could see marked as “IS NON-CLASSIFI” with some of the letters on either end getting cut off due to the way she was holding them. She had dark hair that was tied back into a tight ponytail, and appeared to be wearing a tight shirt with cargo pants. As she became aware of Harry sitting down next to her, she started to put the files away. Harry’s work with MI5 cleaning up what was left of the Death Eaters after Voldemort’s fall left him with the knowledge that NCIS was an American governmental agency, but he did not know very much about them beyond that.</p><p>‘Might as well introduce myself,’ Harry thought, “This is certainly going to be a long flight if we’re just sitting in silence for 8 and a half hours.”</p><p>“Harry Potter,” Harry said, putting out his hand for her to shake, “Mind if I ask why you’re heading to Washington D.C.?”</p><p>“Ziva David,” the woman, Ziva, replied, her voice holding just the barest trace of her original Israeli accent, “I was actually just heading home. I was in London to see my father, and what about you? Why are you going all the way to D.C.?”</p><p>“Just taking a vacation. Hoping I’ll run into an old friend maybe,” Harry said, sounding wistful at even the thought of seeing his oldest friend. “I haven’t seen Kelly in a long time, but last I heard, her dad was moving to D.C. for work, so she might be there too.”</p><p>The two of them continued to talk for the rest of the flight, not seeming to notice the time that had gone by until they suddenly heard the pilot calling out that there were about to descend. As they went down, Harry pulled out a muggle pen and a piece of paper that had an old grocery list on the other side in Andromeda’s neat cursive.</p><p>“Let me give you my cell number. I’ll be in town for a while if you want to go and grab a drink sometime,” Harry stated, hoping dearly that he could manage to see his new friend again sometime in the future. “I’ll be renting an apartment over in Georgetown for the next month”</p><p>Ziva took the paper slowly, inspecting both the number that he had written as well as the grocery list on the other side, noticing the difference in hand writing between the two, assuming that the second set was Harry’s roommate.</p><p>“I’d love to go out some time, Harry,” Ziva smiled flirtatiously, leaving Harry sputtering on the water that he had just taken a sip of. Ziva bust out laughing, before going onwards, “In all seriousness, I’d enjoy spending some more time together. Friends are a rare commodity these days, and I would hate to lose one just after I got him.”</p><p align="center">-----------------------------</p><p>After Harry managed to navigate his way over to Georgetown he decided to call Andi and Hermione and let them know that he was safely over in America. The majority of the Weasleys had been against the vacation, feeling that Harry should stay close for the time being until there was more stability in Magical Britain, but Hermione was adamant that Harry needed time off in order to sort out his head. When Hermione asked him where he wanted to go on his vacation, he instantly knew the answer. While he hadn’t seen Kelly Gibbs in years, she had been his best friend throughout Primary School until her dad had gotten transferred to a different base away from England. When he told Hermione this, she instantly got to research and while she couldn’t manage to find where Kelly lived, the name Leroy Jethro Gibbs was distinctive enough that he could be found with ease. It appeared that Gibbs worked at NCIS now, and Harry would try and visit him in the morning and see where Kelly lived. ‘It would be so nice to see her again after all this time,’ Harry thought to himself as he finally managed to drift off to sleep.</p>
