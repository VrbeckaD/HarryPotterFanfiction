    <p>Harry Potter woke up to the sound of a baby crying in the next room over. It took him a minute to remember that it was <em>his</em> baby he was hearing, and the thought made him smile. He looked over to see Ginny still snoring softly beside him and chose not to wake her up. She hardly got enough sleep as it was.</p>
<p>He disentangled himself slowly from the covers, trying not to wake his wife, and crept across the room to the door that led into their nursery. Inside, his little boy, James Sirius Potter, was crying to the heavens. "For Godric's sake," he whispered to his son. "You'll wake your mum." And then Harry reached down to pick up his son and cradled him close.</p>
<p>That didn't last long. The boy stank like rotting flesh. Harry groaned and brought his son over to the changing station and began the task. It was his least favorite part of being a parent, but James made up for it with his adorable smiles, one of which he gave to Harry just then.</p>
<p>"You're lucky I love you so much," he said to the baby. "Because I would have left long ago with the way you smell!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Harry," said a voice behind him. "You're so good with him."</p>
<p>Harry grinned and picked up his little boy before turning to face Ginny. "He makes it easy."</p>
<p>Ginny rolled her eyes. "That's so corny."</p>
<p>"What can I say? I have to practice my dad jokes - and those come after cheesy sentiment."</p>
<p>"If you want dad jokes, spend an evening with <em>my</em> dad."</p>
<p>Harry shook his head quickly. "No way. I'd be there forever - we all know where the twins learned it from."</p>
<p>Harry realized what he'd said too late. Ginny's gaze dropped and she hunched her shoulders, looking more like a daisy than the strong girl he knew and loved. "Hey, Ginny, I'm sorry - I didn't mean to -"</p>
<p>"No, it's fine. I have to learn, you know? Everyone mentions them, and I - I have to learn to be okay with it. Here, let me take James. You're meeting Ron and Hermione today, aren't you?"</p>
<p>Harry took the out gratefully. "Yes. I'll see you later, sweetie." He pressed a gentle kiss to her lips and walked back into their bedroom.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"Harry, you <em>know</em> you can't say stuff like that to her!" Hermione glared at her friend and then turned her anger on Ron, too. "Tell him, Ron. She's your sister!"</p>
<p>Ron looked away. "Well, see, mate - it's just that Ginny took it so hard, and -"</p>
<p>"Guys, I know!" Harry yelled, startling the other patrons in the leaky cauldron. They grumbled to each other but turned back around when Hermione fixed her stare on them. Harry lowered his voice. "I know. I messed up, and I feel terrible. But we all miss them, you know? Everyone lost someone, and it's hard to hold a conversation where none of them come up."</p>
<p>Hermione looked sympathetic. "Harry. We've been over this."</p>
<p>Harry glared at her for a minute, warning her not to continue her thought, but Ron stepped in. "No, mate, we have. It's time you really heard us, now isn't it?"</p>
<p>"I've told you, it's not <em>about</em> that anymore. It wasn't ever!"</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione exchanged a look. "Harry," Hermione said gently. "You can't blame yourself. It isn't your fault. It's Voldemort's."</p>
<p>"That doesn't make it fair, though, does it? I mean, he killed them to get to me! And hurt everyone I love in the process."</p>
<p>"But Harry, what could you do about it anyway? I mean, it's over. The war's over. And we're all learning to live again."</p>
<p>Harry sighed and bit down hard on his lower lip, drawing blood. Dropping his voice so that his friends had to lean in to hear him, he gave them the truth. "I came back," he said. His friends exchanged a worried glance as he continued. "I came back, from the dead. And none of them will. They were innocents; I was not. But still, death is final for them. It isn't fair. I'd give my life for any of them in heartbeat."</p>
<p>Hermione smiled. "Like your mother."</p>
<p>Harry nodded slowly. "Yeah. I wish I'd gotten to do that. I think... I think it would be much more honorable than sitting here, alive, while people who fought <em>for me</em> are dead..."</p>
<p>"You can't blame yourself, Harry. No one blames you - you can't do it to yourself."</p>
<p>Harry sighed and buried his head in his hands. "I know," he muttered. "I just wish..."</p>
<p>When he didn't finish, Ron jabbed him in the arm. "What'd'you wish, Harry?"</p>
<p>"I guess I wish people could come back from the dead. I know, it's stupid. But I wish everyone could come back. My parents... Sirius and Remus... Fred... Dobby, Dumbledore, Hedwig, everyone."</p>
<p>Hermione pursed her lips. "Now don't you go getting any ideas, Harry. You remember the story of the three brothers, don't you?"</p>
<p>"What does that have to do with anything, 'Mione?" Ron asked.</p>
<p>"<em>Well</em>, it means that sometimes the dead don't really <em>want</em> to come back to life."</p>
<p>Harry stared at her. "You really think all those people wouldn't want to come back to life?"</p>
<p>"All I'm saying, Harry, is that even if they did, they might not be quite as you remember them."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Harry returned home with the thought on his mind. He knew he'd never attempt to bring anyone back from the dead - that was Voldemort-level magic - but he allowed himself to think, not for the first time, of what might be different in the world if all those people hadn't died.</p>
<p>In the future, he would sorely regret that thought. It was better when he didn't know.</p>
