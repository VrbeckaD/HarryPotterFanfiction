  <b>1951 November 26th</b>
</p><p dir="ltr">It was a brilliant idea to go to collage in England instead of America. Here no one really knew who the Xavier family was or that Charles didn't really have a sister so he didn't have to alter anyone's mind. He introduced Raven as his sister,who was now his ward after the recent death of "their" mother, and no one really cared because they didn't know who the Xavier's were anyways.</p><p dir="ltr">Charles decided to celebrate this accomplishment by going for a drink at the pub. "Raven would you like to go out for a bit? Have a look at the town?"</p><p dir="ltr">"A look that ends with you drunk and attempting to seduce some poor girl with your horrible pick up lines? I don't think so Charles."</p><p dir="ltr">"Suit yourself then, sister, suit yourself." Charles chirped back. Raven had seemed kind of down lately but he couldn't figure out why. They were supposed to be happy as they could be a family here without worrying that some old friend of Charles' mother would spot them and assume she was his girlfriend which had happened more than Charles would like to think. Raven always got this weird look on her face when someone came to tell his mother about the "fine girl" he'd been seen with so he assumed she found it awkward too. He never liked making his mother forget this happened and making the other person forget he'd never had a sister in the first place.</p><p dir="ltr">As it turned out his pick-up lines weren't so "horrible" after all as he spent the night with a redhead who's name he only found out was Lily Evans in the morning. He would have loved for her to stick around as Charles found it fascinating that her mind was like a fortress he couldn't get through but she said she was to leave after the weekend was over. No amount of convincing could get her to talk about what he was convinced was her mutation. Lily was very good in bed though and didn't seem at all upset she would have to leave within a few days. He even told her about his mutation and all his findings about them but she brushed it off. Charles shrugged, maybe she was just one of those women.</p><p dir="ltr">

</p><p dir="ltr">Lily Jane-Marie Evans-Potter screamed as she was told to push. "Not now! Not now! James he can't be born now! The prophecy! James--he can't!"</p><p dir="ltr">"Lily, Lily, it will be okay. We'll have the strongest protection but the baby wants to come out now," James Fleamont Potter tried to sooth his hysterical wife. Truthfully, he was worried too, the prophecy told of a boy born 'as the seventh month dies' who could defeat the Dark Lord. July was the seventh month of the year and it was almost midnight.</p><p dir="ltr">"If I can--" Lily panted, "--just hold out--" she screamed, "--JUST A LITTLE LONGER--" and dissolved into tears.</p><p dir="ltr">"Honey the baby needs to come out now, it's time. He wants out," James soothed. He was trying not to let how much this affected him show, Lily needed him to be strong for her.</p><p dir="ltr">"Don't you--" gasp "--PATRONIZE me James Potter! I'll have this baby when I damn well please!"</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe the prophecy wouldn't affect Harry because his father was a muggle? But James intended to be Harry's father as if he'd sired the boy himself and would that matter? Could the mutation the man told Lily about be the 'power the Dark Lord knows not'?</p><p dir="ltr">At exactly eleven fifty-nine, right before July thirty-first became August first, Harry James Charles Potter was born. Born as the seventh month dies indeed.</p><p dir="ltr">
  <b>1952 December 25th</b>
</p><p dir="ltr">They were celebrating Harry's first Christmas at Potter Manor. For whatever reason he would never accept baby candy from Peter. Oh well, the Potter's and their closest friends would assume it was a phase. They couldn't possibly know Harry was a telepath if couldn't tell them and didn't know how to project coherent thoughts yet. Lily did seem unnaturally in tune to her baby's wants and needs, getting up before Harry could even cry out his hunger to the world, changing his nappy before it started to smell, and getting toys before he could reach for them. Many of them sighed, Lily was such a natural mother.</p><p dir="ltr">
  <b>1953 October 31st</b>
</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Harry was right! Harry was right! Harry was right!</em> Lily thought wildly as she searched the baby's room for the emergency portkey. Her son had always refused to be held by Peter, refused any sweets given by Peter, threw the rat toy out of his crib anytime they tried to get him to play with it. <em>He knew.</em> It might seem silly to some but Lily Potter knew without a doubt that her son had tried to protect them. And what had they done? Lily sobbed as the portkey failed. Brushed his concerns off, reassured--reassured!-- that traitor that he would grow out of it. They were going to die.</p><p dir="ltr">Lily looked one last time at her son. Memorized his small face and eyes that were exactly like hers. "Harry mummy loves you--daddy loves you--you are so loved." She wished she had told that man--the mutant--that they had a child together. That he was a father. Perhaps in the muggle world--perhaps with mutants--he would be safe. But it was too late, too late, too late. She was going to die but maybe Harry didn't have too. She begged for Harry's life with no concern for her own. Voldemort offered, for whatever reason, to spare her and she denied him every time. Lily Potter could not live in a world where she stood aside and let her son die. It was that, the fact that she <em>could have</em> lived but did not, that pure love, the sacrifice, that made the most deadly unstoppable curse rebound back on the Darkest Wizard in history. For now, Lord Voldemort was no more.</p><p dir="ltr">
  <b>1958 July 31st</b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Natasha Romanova had just finished her fourth mission away from her handlers. She was her own handler now. Make no mistake however, the Black Widow was well aware the Red Room was still after her for her deflection. She couldn't regret leaving, on her own there were no punishments, no torture, and she could have her own personal preferences. Natasha didn't know what her preferences would be but she could <em>have them</em> and that's what was important. What if she ended up like the Asset? A weapon for someone to clean and use? It was better to be dead.</p><p dir="ltr">Her latest mission had been to kill the rival politician of a woman's husband, apparently her husband "lacked the balls to do hire her himself" according to the wife. Natasha did not care for the personal life of her clients but sometimes she wondered what it would be life to want a job so much you would kill for it. She killed because it was what she was trained to do, how she was raised and the Black Widows knew no other way. But these people were no raised to see human life as expendable, were not raised to kill. So why did they?</p><p dir="ltr">Natasha found herself at a park in Surrey after wandering around town. There nothing to do now that she was free. Before freedom all Black Widows reported to their handlers after a mission but now Natasha made her own rules and gave <em>herself</em> missions and there was no one to report to.</p><p dir="ltr">The bench she sat on coughed. Standing up rode straight the assassin surveyed her surroundings. "Who's there?"</p><p dir="ltr">Another cough and then "--Me." The Black Widow watched as a small boy pulled himself out from under her bench. He looked to be about three years old, with too large clothes and glasses to big for his face. His voice was soft and sad but sure of himself.</p><p dir="ltr">"And who is me?" Natasha asked.</p><p dir="ltr">"My relatives call me boy or freak or burden."</p><p dir="ltr">Well that was unhelpful. "What do your teachers call you?" She decided not to let the words "freak" or "burden" affect her, assassins weren't supposed to have emotions.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think Mrs.Brandon called me Harry. And Mrs.Figg thinks my name is Harry Potter."</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Thinks? </em>Natasha thought. Did that mean Mrs.Figg had told Harry that was his name. She looked at the young boy once more and for the first time he looked up at her. The Black Widow stepped back, startled by the coldness in his eyes. Those weren't the eyes of a child, those were the eyes of someone raised him the Red Room. Someone hurt badly by the world and desensitized to pain. He was also well-spoken for what she had assumed was a three year old.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm six." Harry offered up as if he'd read her thoughts. "I turned six today and Uncle Vernon kicked me out of the house so they could celebrate Dudley's birthday twice. I'm a burden so I don't deserve to be celebrated."</p><p dir="ltr">Something painful in Natasha's heart clenched. This boy with the cold eyes tugged at her, he could so easily be broken buy the world. Natasha had wondered earlier what could make those who were not raised to kill, kill. Now she knew the answer, you didn't need to be broken down with a specific purpose in mind. Those with cruelty in their hearts would break you anyways</p><p dir="ltr">"Would you like to come with me Harry?"</p><p dir="ltr">The change in the boy was instantaneous. A wide smile split his face and the dull green eyes shinned with light as if by magic. "Yes! Yes, please!"</p><p dir="ltr">The world had not completely broken him yet and Natasha Romanova was going to make sure it never did.</p><p dir="ltr">Â </p>
