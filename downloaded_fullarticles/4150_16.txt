    <p align="justify">It was the beginning of a new year at Örnsjö — school of wizardry and witchery — yet the train that would bring the many students to the location far away from non-magical people had yet to arrive. Teachers and others who worked at the school were all patiently waiting for all the students, some of them happy to get at least a couple more minutes of peace and some annoyed that the train <em>once again</em> was late. </p>
<p align="justify">Helena Ross, the rather annoyed Deputy Head of the school, was getting tired of the fact that it just <em>had</em> to happen every year and was also currently storming through corridors to get to the Headmaster's office. She had fixed it last year, the year before that, the year before the year before last year, and now she'd have to fix it again. The doors opened for her without her even having to say a word, they were used to her rushing into the office after her fifteen years as Deputy. </p>
<p align="justify">"Danarius, have you made contact yet?" It might have sounded like she was ordering around her boss, and she was one hundred percent ordering him around, but that was certainly not how Vector Danarius heard it. </p>
<p align="justify">"Of course! The only problem is that they haven't responded." It was said in such a calm and carefree way that it almost made Helena gape at him — <em>almost. </em>She sighed, loudly, and walked straight out of the room to avoid yelling at the man who paid her. </p>
<p align="justify">She couldn't take it anymore. No, the students would be late and she would do nothing to prevent it in the future, everything seemed to backfire no matter how hard she tried this time.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">It was truly going to be a <em>fantastic</em> year. </p>
