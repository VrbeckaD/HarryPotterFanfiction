    <p>"But why not!" An 11-year-old Teddy complained at his Godfather.</p><p>"I told you pal, I wish I could come and see you off but I need to work, your Dad's will be there, though!"</p><p>"But I don't care Dad's are coming, I want you to be there! Dad's are coming with me it's just not the same!" Teddy complained.</p><p>They had been having the same argument for days. He just couldn't get the time off work, everyone wanted September first off to see their kids off. Since technically Teddy wasn't Harry's kid, he couldn't get the day off.</p><p>"Jamie and Lily will come with you, right guys?" Harry said, looking at the twins on the floor.</p><p>"Yeah of course, but things are going to be rubbish around here without you!" Jamie said, looking up from his new potions book.</p><p>"Yeah, I know. But in 3 years time, you can go and join Teddy at Hogwarts okay pal?"</p><p>"Can we go visit Cissa and Sev today?" Lily asked.</p><p>"I don't see why not? I'll floo her and find out if she's free" Harry said, rubbing his daughters hair before walking over to the fireplace. He threw some floo powder into the fire and Severus' face popped up.</p><p>"Harry? What is it?" He asked.</p><p>"The twins wanted to come and see you and Narcissa, and Teddy too. But we wanted to make sure it was okay first," Harry asked, and he saw Severus' face screw up.</p><p>"I don't think that would be a great idea, Harry," Severus said, shaking his head and Harry furrowed his eyebrows in confusion "why not?".</p><p>Lily soon walked over and plopped down next to Harry, looking into the fire.</p><p>"Hey, Sev! Is Cissa there?" she asked, and Severus smiled brightly.</p><p>"Hello, my little Lilykins. No, she's in the other room. But I can get-" he said but he was interrupted by another voice.</p><p>"Sev? Mum wants to know who's on the floo" a very familiar voice to Harry said, and he automatically froze.</p><p>"No, it's okay I get it. We need to go. Send my love to Narcissa" Harry said, before quickly ending the floo call.</p><p>"Why can't we go, Daddy?" Lily asked and Harry looked at her sad face.</p><p>"Because Cissa and Sev have visitors right now. Why don't we go over to Auntie Hermione and Uncle Ron's? Go see Hugo and Rosie?" Harry said, smiling at all 3 children.</p><p>"But I want to go see Cissa and Sev!" Jamie complained.</p><p>"Well we can't now go get your coats and we will floo over to Auntie Hermione's. It's been awhile since you last seen her!" Hary said, shooing the children out the room and shoving the every growing problem of Draco Malfoy to the back of his head.</p><p>***</p><p>"Hey, guys? Why don't you go upstairs and play? I need to talk to Auntie Hermione and Uncle Ron," Harry said, smiling at his kids.</p><p>"Is this about why we couldn't go to Cissa's?" Lily asked and Harry nodded his head, soon Lily, Jamie, Teddy, Rosie and Hugo wandered upstairs and left all 3 adults sitting around the table, drinking coffee.</p><p>"So, what's going on?" Hermione asked.</p><p>"I went to take the kids over to Narcissa and Severus'. All I'm saying is I'm glad I floo'd first," Harry said sighing.</p><p>"He was there?" Ron said and Harry nodded in confirmation.</p><p>"Yeah, I heard his voice. This is the first time since-," Harry stopped what he was saying, having to think.</p><p>"Since our wedding," Hermione said and Harry nodded.</p><p>"Yeah, and even at that we avoided each other. Once in 10 years? That's it, not too bad I'd say," Harry said.</p><p>"You do know, that he never meant to hurt you-," Hermione started but Harry cut her off.</p><p>"I don't want to talk about him. I just wanted to let you know in case he told you," Harry said, lifting his mug to his lips.</p><p>"Harry, we've been over this. We are friends, you know that. But we hardly see each other with our-,"</p><p>"Hermione, I don't want to talk about that arsehole. He wasted over 6 months off my life. I hate him," Harry said, shaking his head.</p><p>"Harry mate, it's been 10 years, can you not get over him already? You have to admit you over exaggerated," Ron said and Harry shook his head.</p><p>"I told you, I'm not talking about this. Change the subject or I'm leaving," Harry said.</p><p>"Harry, you started the conversation?" Hermione said and Harry stood up.</p><p>"Harry!" Hermione said, clearly had enough of his tantrums.</p><p>"No, I've had enough. Can you take Lily and Jamie to the train station tomorrow? To say goodbye to Sirius, Remus and Teddy. I would take them but I have to work," Harry said, lifting his coat.</p><p>"Yeah sure, just leave them here and they can sleep here tonight. I'll floo Remus telling him to pick Teddy up tonight," Hermione said and Harry nodded.</p><p>He walked over and gave both a quick hug and placed a delicate kiss on Hermione's cheek before heading to the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>"LILY! JAMIE! TEDDY!" Harry shouted and all three came out one of the room's complaining, followed by Rosie and Hugo.</p><p>"Dad! We've only been here a little while! Can't we stay longer!" Jamie complained. Harry never got a chance to answer before Teddy spoke up.</p><p>"Yeah, please Harry! Just a little bit longer,"</p><p>"yeah please, Uncle Harry!" Rosie begged.</p><p>"I've spoken to your Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron and they said you two can stay here tonight since they will take you to the station. Teddy mate, your Dad will come and pick you up at some point tonight. They will want to spend your last night at home together!" Harry said, and smiled crossed every one of their faces.</p><p>"Thanks, Dad!" Lily said, jumping into his arms, followed by Jamie.</p><p>"No problem, now behave for your Auntie Hermione okay?" Harry said, placing small kisses on their foreheads before they all left except Teddy.</p><p>"C'mere mate," Harry said, opening his arms for Teddy, who happily jumped into them.</p><p>"I'm going to miss you," Harry mumbled into Teddy's hair.</p><p>"I'm going to miss you too Harry," Teddy said, never leaving his arms.</p><p>"You're like the brother I never had," Teddy said.</p><p>"And you're the brother I never wanted," Harry said teasing.</p><p>"Write to me, all the time okay. If you have any problems at school tell your Dads, or owl me and tell me and I'll floo in to see you. Owl me as soon as you find out which house you've been put in. I'll send Tempest okay?" Harry said, pulling away.</p><p>"Okay, I'll see you at Christmas yeah?" Teddy said and Harry nodded.</p><p>"You can bet on it pal" and with that, he turned around and walked away. He was nearly at the door when he turned around and saw Teddy coming flying towards him and into his arms.</p><p>"It's okay pal, I'm going to miss you too okay. Now remember, owl me, floo me, make friends, study hard, and make hell for Severus" Harry said chuckling and Teddy nodded, he pulled away, and waved Harry goodbye.</p><p>With that, Harry was away, and teddy was left to fend for himself at Hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizardry.</p><p>***</p><p>Hermione, Ron, Lily, Jamie, Rosie and Hugo walked through the barrier between platforms 9 and 10 to get to Platform 9 3/4.</p><p>Ron and Hermione were immediately surrounded by familiar faces, many have aged quite a bit since they last seen them, most people the used to go to school with but were a couple years older than them. Hermione looked around before she seen Teddy, Remus and Sirius standing.</p><p>"Look, kids, there's Uncle Remus, Uncle Sirius and Teddy, on you go!" Hermione said, and all the kids ran over and Hermione and Ron following behind them there was a chorus of</p><p>"Hey, Uncle Remus," and "Hey Uncle Sirius,"</p><p>"Kids, go say your goodbyes to Teddy over there, you will need to go home with Ron soon okay?" Hermione said and all the kids nodded walking away a little.</p><p>"So you were roped into train duty?" Sirius said and Hermione nodded.</p><p>"Yeah, apparently he is working," Ron said and Remus shook his head.</p><p>"No he is avoiding," Sirius said.</p><p>"Yeah we know that. He nearly went to Narcissa's yesterday when he was there" Hermione said and Remus' eyebrows shot up.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>"Nothing as far as we know, he floo'd first to ask and Severus said it wouldn't be a good idea, Draco said something in the background and Harry heard him, he freaked out and came over to ours. He was freaking out at ours then left the children with us and then went home. That's why Teddy floo'd home from ours yesterday instead" Hermione said, and Sirius shook his head in disappointment.</p><p>"I wish they would just make up, I'm sick of tiptoeing around them," Sirius said.</p><p>"It's been 10 years, I wish they'd just grow up. They both have kids for god sakes. Whereas they are acting like the kids. Do you remember our wedding? That was a disaster, we had to physically pull them apart because they were fighting out the back. I'm just glad the children never saw" Hermione said, and Ron gave a hug to comfort her.</p><p>"We better get going, we need to get Teddy into a compartment then go up to the professors compartment, the train is about to leave in 15 minutes," Remus said and Sirius nodded.</p><p>"Yeah, it was good seeing the kids, and you off course," Sirius said, giving Hermione a quick hug and shaking Ron's hand, Remus doing the same.</p><p>"Yeah, Ron's going to take the kids home but I'm going to wait on Draco, he shouldn't have to go through this by himself," Hermione said.</p><p>"Is Pansy and Blaise not coming with him?" Remus asked and Ron shook his head, "he didn't ask them too, he wanted to do it by himself, you know him, ever the arsehole," Ron said and both men laughed.</p><p>"Teddy! Come on, we have to go" Remus shouted and the children ran over, they said their goodbyes and Remus, Teddy and Sirius disappeared onto the train.</p><p>"Okay kids, Ron is going to take you home. I need to do something so behave okay?" Hermione said and all the kids nodded before heading off with Ron.</p><p>She stood by herself for about 5 minutes, looking around trying to spot Draco before she spotted the bleach blonde little boy standing next to his father.</p><p>"Draco, Scorpius," Hermione said, and both looked in her direction.</p><p>"Hey, Aunt Hermione!" Scorpius said, running and giving her a hug.</p><p>"Hey, little man, you excited?" she asked and he nodded fastly.</p><p>"Hey, Draco," she said, giving him a hug and he placed a delicate kiss on her cheek.</p><p>"What are you doing here," he asked her.</p><p>"I'm here to say goodbye to you of course!" she said, bending down to his height.</p><p>"You all ready?" she asked and he nodded.</p><p>"What animal are you taking?" she asked.</p><p>"I'm taking an owl, Dad say's their most practical. See," Scorpius said, pointing to a snowy white owl in the cage.</p><p>"What's its name? I used to know someone who had a white owl very similar to this," Hermione said, looking at Draco who just scowled at her.</p><p>"Oh, I haven't named him yet," Scorpius said, looking at the little owl.</p><p>"Well, what do you want to name it son?" Draco asked and he looked.</p><p>"Oh, I know. I want to name it...HARRY! After the boy who lived ya know?" Scorpius said and Draco choked his saliva.</p><p>"No way, pick another name Scorpius, and quickly, the train is about to leave," Draco said firmly and Scorpius scowled.</p><p>"No, his name is Harry and that's the end of it, I will see you at Christmas Dad, and you Auntie Hermione," he said,and with that he stalked away.</p><p>"He's very much like you," Hermione said laughing.</p><p>"Shut up," Draco said frowning, looking at the train that is pulling out off the station.</p><p>***</p><p>"Hey, all the other compartments are full. Do you mind?" Scorpius said to the blue haired boy who looked at him and smiled.</p><p>"No, not at all, in you come," he said and Scorpius smiled and walked in, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>"Hey, I'm Teddy," he said, putting his hand out.</p><p>"I'm Scorpius," the blonde boy said, shaking Teddy's hand.</p><p>"First time at Hogwarts?" Teddy asked and Scorpius laughed.</p><p>"That obvious huh?" and Teddy laughed alongside him.</p><p>"Yeah, me too. My Dad's work there and they said that it is fine, I won't have a problem, most people are really friendly" he said and Scorpius looked at him funnily.</p><p>"Dad's?" he asked furrowing his face.</p><p>"Yeah, my Dad is gay and he's married to another guy. That doesn't bother you does it?" Teddy asked, worry crossing his face.</p><p>"No, not at all. It's just I've heard of people being gay, I've just never met anyone being gay before," Scorpius said and Teddy nodded.</p><p>"So, you're pureblood?" Teddy asked and Scorpius nodded.</p><p>"Yeah, but I grew up muggle, you?"</p><p>"Half-blood. Both my parents were wizards but my Mum died right after I was born, in the war you know? But then my Dad got with my other Dad, and we've been like that since before I remember," Teddy said and Scorpius nodded.</p><p>"Yeah, my Dad didn't know about me until after I was born, he said that he slept with my Mum one night and you know reproduction works. Then my Mum loved me a lot, but couldn't handle the responsibility of being a parent.</p><p>"So he took me, and it's just been me and him since. But my grandparents look out for me a lot. But my Dad wanted me to have the decision if I wanted to be a wizard or not. So I grew up muggle, even though my Dad's a healer.</p><p>"I went to muggle primary school, then my Dad asked me if I wanted to continue at muggle school or come to Hogwarts. I decided I have lived muggle, it's time to live wizard then I'll decide later what I want to do. Plus I never really fit in anywhere in muggle school so?" Scorpius explained and Teddy nodded.</p><p>"I have a funny feeling we are going to be really good friends Scorpius," Teddy said smirking.</p><p>"Yeah, I agree Teddy" and with that. They were away to Hogwarts.</p><p>***</p><p>"Hey, Dad's!" Teddy shouted as they headed off the platform at Hogsmeade and both men turned around.</p><p>"Hey Teddy, did the journey go okay?" Remus asked and he nodded.</p><p>"I wanted to introduce you to someone. Where did he go," Teddy said looking around for Scorpius until he seen him walking off the train.</p><p>"Hey Scorp, this is my Dad's, Professor Lupin and Professor Black. Dad's this is Scorpius," Teddy said, and both men's mouth dropped open.</p><p>"Nice to meet you Scorpius," Remus said and the blonde boy smiled at the two men. The exchanged pleasantries until the younger boys were shouted away and the two men looked at each other.</p><p>"Do you know-" Remus said and Sirius answered quickly "yep. Should we?"</p><p>"Nope," Remus said and Sirius looked at him funnily.</p><p>"He will kill us for not telling him," Sirius said.</p><p>"It's our son, we can do what we like," Remus said, looking around to see there was no one around before placing a little kiss on Sirius' lips before they walked hand in hand to get a carriage up to the castle.</p><p>***</p><p>Meanwhile, Scorpius and Teddy were standing just outside the great hall, waiting to be taken in to get housed.</p><p>"So if your Dad's are married? Why don't they have the same second name?" Scorpius questioned.</p><p>"They do, it's Lupin-Black like me. But while they are here, they separate them so they don't confuse people," Teddy explained and Scorpius nodded.</p><p>"Oh, okay. That makes sense. What house do you want to get put in?" he asked.</p><p>"I don't mind, but both my Dad's were placed in Gryffindor, my biological Mum was Hufflepuff, my godfather was Gryffindor, my Dad's friends were Gryffindor, my Aunt and Uncle were Gryffindor.</p><p>"But my godfather said it doesn't matter where you are placed, just truth the sorting hat. It has your best interests at heart and it knows what it is talking about. What about you?" Teddy asked.</p><p>"All my family were in Slytherin. But I'm not sure, I'm not really bothered. My Dad says he will be proud of me no matter what. But he also says he hated being in Slytherin, simply because it made him do things he wasn't proud off during the war.</p><p>"So I'm kinda wishing not Slytherin. But anyway. I hope were housed together" He said as professor McGonagall walked out and spotted the two boys together.</p><p>"Oh Merlin help us," she muttered under her voice.</p><p>"Okay, the housing ceremony will start now," and with that, they all walked in.</p><p>***</p><p>"Edward Lupin-Black," Professor McGonagall said and Teddy turned around and looked at Scorpius.</p><p>"Wish me luck," he said.</p><p>"Luck, Edward" Scorpius teased and he walked up and sat on the little stool and the hat was placed on his head.</p><p>"Lupin-Black huh? Both fathers in Gryffindor? Although your Mother was in Hufflepuff? You would do well in Hufflepuff, but just in case GRYFFINDOR!" the hat said and the Gryffindor table roared with cheers and claps.</p><p>Teddy smiled at his two fathers, who were sitting next to each other smiling at him. He looked at his Uncle Sev who smiled brightly at him, and he walked down to the Gryffindor table and he was welcomed warmly. </p><p>"Scorpius Malfoy!" McGonagall shouted and murmurs were heard all over the hall. He walked up and sat down, the hat placed on his head once again.</p><p>"Ah, another Malfoy, son of Draco I presume?" He asked and Scorpius nodded slightly.</p><p>"All Malfoy's were placed in Slytherin? You have the potential to be a Slytherin. Oh yes, you do" the hat said. But soon started speaking again.</p><p>"Although you are cunning and very smart. You also have your Father and Grandmothers bravery, therefore, I think you will do better in.." the hat said. But stopped, and stayed quiet for a few seconds.</p><p>"GRYFFINDOR," it said and Scorpius smiled widely, and ran down and hugged Teddy.</p><p>Snape was shocked by this, and turned around and looked at Remus and Sirius who just raised a glass of juice at him, and he sighed loudly, looking down at his grandson who was sitting happily beside Teddy.</p>
