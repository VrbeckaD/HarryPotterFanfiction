    <p align="justify">The Great Hall smelled like pumpkin pie. Like soul cakes and raisin bread steaming delicately from dozens of plates spread across all five tables. The sweet scent of fruit wafted appealingly through the corridors as toffee apples were secretly exchanged for sugar-coated hawberries. And all around the dining hall there was candy. Lots of delicious, flashy, colorful candy.</p><p align="justify">The students were already sitting at their place, laughing, and joking, and cheering gleefully with a cup of drink in their hands. Some of them hummed to old Halloween songs, while most of them carried pumpkin-shaped baskets filled with Halloween sweets at their backs. Everyone seemed extraordinarily happy that night.</p><p align="justify">Everyone, except from Jooheon, who kept stirring a giant meatball mummy immersed in his own thoughts.</p><p align="justify">“Jooheon-ah...”</p><p align="justify">“...”</p><p align="justify">“Ya, Jooheon-ah!”</p><p align="justify">Jooheon jumped on his seat and raised his head. At his side, Shownu was staring at him, a friendly but impatient request in his eyes.</p><p align="justify">“Your legs,” the boy said. “Can you stop moving them? I’m trying to eat this.” He pointed to a cheese ball shaped like an eye that kept rolling around his plate. “But it just won’t stay still.”</p><p align="justify">Jooheon gazed alternatively to the jumping cheese ball, to the quivering table and his own trembling legs, before straightening in a quiet and composed pose. “Sorry,” he muttered, deep, and serious, and too self-conscious to lift his eyes from the little yellow and black ribbons on his tunic.</p><p align="justify">Fortunately, Shownu didn’t seem to notice. He just smiled and thanked him, then returned his attention silently to his food. Just when he was about to prick the cheese ball, however, Jooheon’s legs started moving on their own accord and the slippery cheese ball escaped his fork once again. Shownu ran a hand through his hair in desperation.  </p><p align="justify">“Hey, Jooheon, are you alright?” An ashy brown-haired head leaned across the table, accompanied by threads of sapphire and bronze, and a concerned frown on Kihyun’s forehead.</p><p align="justify">“Uh?” he blinked once, twice, focusing his small alert-rounded eyes on his friend. “Yes…!” he replied, smiling stiffly before taking a quick glance at his back. “I mean… Why wouldn’t I be?”</p><p align="justify">“You don’t look that fine to me.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m alright. I’m Fine. I'm perfectly fine!”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah... super.” And that was sarcastic Hyungwon, honoring them with a sarcastic snort.</p><p align="justify">Kihyun’s frown grew even deeper.</p><p align="justify">After too much struggling, Shownu finally gave up on the cheese ball hunt and grabbed a potato pancake from a large dish in front of him. </p><p align="justify">“He thinks a troll will appear in the dungeons.”</p><p align="justify">He didn’t have time to protest.</p><p align="justify">A choke sound, and suddenly, a violent rain fell upon their faces, showering them with pumpkin juice. A deep silence set on the table as Shownu stopped munching and blinked at the chaos, while Kihyun turned to his housemate and glared at him with wide enraged eyes matching a wide speechless grimace on his mouth. Jooheon just stared at them blankly.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry,” Hyungwon murmured, ears pink and a sweet apologetic smile on his lips, before discreetly putting down the jar he had been sipping from. “But really? A troll!?”</p><p align="justify">“Um, you know, that big magical creature. Big hands, big ears. Pretty much big everything. But not too handsome, if you ask me.”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, thank you, hyung. I think I know what a troll is.”</p><p align="justify">Shownu nodded, once, more to himself than to the rest of the boys.</p><p align="justify">“And why would you think something like that?” Kihyun asked him, forcing a sympathetic smile as he rubbed himself dry and attempted incredibly, amazingly hard, not to stick his own fork on Hyungwon’s leg.</p><p align="justify">“Cause it’s Halloween,” he claimed, as if it was the obvious answer. Cause really, it was.</p><p align="justify">Not for Kikyun, apparently.</p><p align="justify">“And…?”</p><p align="justify">“And you know,” the boy frowned and shifted on his seat, more anxious than embarrassed. “There’s this rumor… They say that a big troll will appear in the dungeons each year at Halloween night.”</p><p align="justify">And he could swear he was trying his best not to bolt out of the Great Hall and keep running until he was safely sheltered under his blankets.</p><p align="justify">“That’s nonsense,” Kihyun shook his head. Meanwhile, Hyungwon pouted his lips together trying -and failing- to conceal his amusement. </p><p align="justify">“But Minhyuk said...”</p><p align="justify">“Of course it was Minhyuk...” Kihyun sighed. “Listen. You can’t buy everything Minhyuk says, okay? He’s a Slytherin. And a very treacherous and nasty one.”</p><p align="justify">“Never trust a Slytherin,” Hyungwon stated. “Least a good-looking one.”</p><p align="justify">Kihyun rolled his eyes. “There’s no troll hiding in the dungeons, okay?” He rested a hand on his sleeve. “It’s more likely for Hyungwon to get his o.w.l. in Astronomy this year.”</p><p align="justify">“Yah! It was only once. And really, how can you expect me to have a stupid test at 3 in the morning and not fall asleep?”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, maybe you should try looking at the stars in broad daylight. See if the sun burns the few neurons you have left.”</p><p align="justify">Jooheon didn’t care about stars. He didn’t care about o.w.l.s, about naps in the Astronomy tower or Hyungwon’s fried neurons. And really, how could they even be chewing at their dinner so unconcernedly when there was the possibility of a big scary <em>thing</em> hiding somewhere in the castle? Maybe a slim possibility, but still...</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Still…</em>
</p><p align="justify">“What if a troll <em>does appear</em>, <em>without warning</em>, <em>in the dungeons</em>?” he blurted, emphasizing each sentence separatedly. And just then, the urge to flee straight to his room was near unbearable. “O-or maybe a huge snake will come out of the bathroom sink. Or the Grim…!”</p><p align="justify">“Oh my gosh. You’ve been sneaking again into the restricted section of the library, haven’t you?” Kihyun pointed an accusing finger towards him. “Was it Minhyuk’s idea, too?” he puffed. “Either way – that’s it! You’re not reading any other Harry Potter book. Ever. I want them back on my desk first thing tomorrow morning. Every single one of them.”</p><p align="justify">“But…”</p><p align="justify">“Listen. Trolls don't pop out of dungeons like that. Trolls are original from Scandinavia, okay? And they live in caves, or rivers, or thick forests –no, Jooheon, not <em>that thick forest</em>,” he cleared up, before Jooheon could even start panicking about the Dark Forest<em>.</em> “And even if they are unnaturally big and strong –and maybe a little violent and unpredictable… They have the intellectual capacity of a bug, and possess no magical powers in their own right. Do you ever listen in professor Hagrid’s class?”</p><p align="justify">“Um, sometimes...?”</p><p align="justify">And now that he mentioned it, maybe it made sense.</p><p align="justify">Indeed, it had been Minhyuk who had brought the whole thing up in the first place. He was walking back from Professor Sprout’s class when he’d bumped into his friend, resting negligently underneath an old tree.</p><p align="justify">“Did you know there’s a troll locked in the dungeons?” he’d confessed, almost enthusiastically. “And they say that at Halloween, the spell becomes weak, setting the troll free. I wonder if maybe this year we’ll get to see a glimpse of the troll. There’s less than a month left until Halloween…”</p><p align="justify">He didn’t believe it, at first. But then Minhyuk had pointed earnestly at the novel he was reading, and without even noticing, Jooheon was entering the school with a bag of Anjelica seeds and a stack of books piled on his arms. He was now finishing the fourth volume. And maybe he shouldn’t really take it at face value. After all, everyone knew that  it was Bulgaria, and not Ireland, who won the 422nd Quidditch World Cup…</p><p align="justify">“What about the basilisk?” he insisted, not fully convinced. “And the Grim?”</p><p align="justify">“You're forgetting about the Hungarian Horntail, too.”</p><p align="justify">And that was definitely not the right thing to say, because now Jooheon froze, eyes open like a baby owlet, and Hyungwon had a fork swinging dangerously in front of his immaculate nose as he waved his hands in a poor attempt to defend himself from a very red and very irritated Kihyun.</p><p align="justify">“For goodness’ sake, Hyungwon! You're supposed soothe him, not encourage him!”</p><p align="justify">“Okay! I didn’t mean that, I’m sorry!”</p><p align="justify">“If you’re not going to help, then why don’t you just keep your mouth shut!?”</p><p align="justify">“I know! My fault! I was just joking, okay? Relax!”</p><p align="justify">Kihyun still shot him a warning look out of the corner of his eyes before lowering the fork, fingers tightly pressed around its handle.</p><p align="justify">Jooheon buried his face in his arms, disheartened. He tried not to overthink it. There was no troll. No huge snake. No scary creatures waiting under the stairs to assault him. It was okay. It was safe.</p><p align="justify">But still he couldn’t help flinching every time some stupid kid dared to throw some Wildfired Whizz-Bangs outside, or one of those living bats swooping in low black clouds over the tables fluttered his wings too close for his own liking.</p><p align="justify">“Are you going to eat that?” Shownu asked eventually, pointing at the unfinished meatball with a perfectly innocent smile on his lips.</p><p align="justify">Jooheon just shrugged and shoved the plate towards him. “All yours,” he uttered. Then he flung his legs over the bench and rose from his seat. </p><p align="justify">“Are you leaving?” Shownu looked up with a puzzled expression.</p><p align="justify">“Where are you going?”</p><p align="justify">“The dorms.”</p><p align="justify">“Wait. You can’t go just yet. It’s Halloween night! We are going to Hogsmeade, remember? There’s a sweet eating contest in HoneyDukes, and we promised Minhyuk we were going to play trick or treat with him, and…”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, well… I think I’ll pass.”</p><p align="justify">“But...”</p><p align="justify">“Have fun without me. And don’t let Hyungwon eat all the snacks.”</p><p align="justify">“But… Hey, do you want us to go with you?”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, you should be careful with the troll. He might be waiting for you at any corner.”</p><p align="justify">Jooheon stopped for a second -maybe to put his hands around Hyungwon’s pale neck, maybe to accept the escorting proposal. He smiled instead. A beaming grin stretching from ear to ear and making his eyes disappear into two crescent moons before dropping abruptly to a cold and dreadful stare.</p><p align="justify">“Rest assured. If I happen to meet the troll, I'll make sure to show him the shortest way to the Ravenclaw Tower.”</p><p align="justify">With that, he swirled on his feet and marched hastily towards the entrance.</p><p align="justify">The silence still stretched a bit longer before someone muttered, “If a troll ever pops out in the dungeons, though, I hope he eats Minhyuk first.”</p><p align="justify">Hyungwon’s high-pitched laugh was the last thing he heard before fading through the lonely corridors.</p>
