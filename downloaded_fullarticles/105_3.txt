    <p>Amelia Tyler wakes at 05:00, as is her habit. She’s sliding on her usual compression shorts for her morning run when last night’s date sits up and glares at her.</p><p>“It is <em>dawn</em>,” Sarah complains. “Are you <em>mental</em>?”</p><p>Amelia hopes she is recalling the woman’s name correctly. It is her job to remember every detail in a given situation. However, when she has time off, she truly does leave her job behind.</p><p>It had also been deafening inside the clubs on the West End last night. Hearing had been secondary to acquiring the right sort of partner.</p><p>Maybe it’s not Sarah, but Samantha. Shit.</p><p>“I always get up this early,” Amelia replies, tossing her cotton camisole nightshirt directly into the laundry basket. She isn’t one for delicate lingerie even if she has reason for it, and cotton is more forgiving of bloodstains. “There is food in the kitchen. Help yourself to breakfast, but try to be gone before I get back. I’ve work to do today.”</p><p>“But it’s Saturday!” Sarah-Samantha finally tosses the sheet aside, revealing that she is so devoted to the frill that she slept in the same lace garters, panties, and silken lace camisole she’d been happy to show off the evening before. “And I thought—”</p><p>Amelia winces as she yanks the compression top over her head and twists it into place to support her breasts. No, no, no. She does not need the complication of someone who didn’t realize this was a one-night stand! “Look. If I lead you on, I truly didn’t mean to do so. I’m not looking for a relationship right now.”</p><p>Sarah-Samantha scowls at her for a long moment before heaving a sigh. “Fine. I was hoping for a bit more, but you didn’t once tell me otherwise. There had best be gourmet breakfast options in that kitchen, though!”</p><p>“There might be. My shopping is delivered, and the company knows I prefer items chosen at random.” It keeps her from establishing too many easily trackable patterns.</p><p>Sarah-Samantha—whatever the bloody hell her name is—pauses in the midst of buttoning a shimmering green shirt that is two sizes too small. Amelia will admit that fascination in how the ginger could possibly dance in that restrictive shirt had been part of last night’s appeal.</p><p>She had indeed been a grand dancer. She also had quite the talented tongue.</p><p>“You’re really going to leave me here on my lonesome, then.” Sarah-Samantha frowns. “You’re not worried I’ll rob you blind?”</p><p>Amelia lets out a gentle snort. “Darling, I work for the government. That would be a truly foolish thing to do.” She grabs her mobile phone, flat key, and ID card, and then pauses with her hand on the bedroom doorknob. “If there are scones lurking in my kitchen, save one for me, all right?”</p><p>“If there is fresh cream to go with those scones, you might not ever see your precious scones again,” Sarah-Samantha mutters.</p><p>Bugger. Amelia turns around and drops a chaste kiss onto the woman’s sulking forehead. “I did have a lovely time, and quite enjoyed your company. Alas for us both, I am married to my job.”</p><p>“In that case, I will declare you a nutter and be grateful to have dodged a bullet.”</p><p>Amelia makes an appropriate face in response and leaves her flat. In the hall, she tucks her key into the secretive fold pocket, straps her phone to her wrist, and clips her ID card to the top of her shirt before tucking it beneath so it doesn’t bounce along and annoy her. Then she slips out into the blue-grey light of early morning to begin her run.</p><p>The route is never the same. Never give an enemy anything. Make them work for it.</p><p>Some days it’s the local park. Some days it’s the walkways. Some days it’s Tower Hamlets Cemetery, which is always peaceful when the sun begins to warm the old stones.</p><p>Today it’s a bit of a gymnastics run to distract herself. She climbs fences and crosses private rear residential gardens, evading bright lights or the notice of people who might object to her running across their fancy cast iron bench that is never sat upon.</p><p>She’s checked with careful little applications of white dust and black coal powder. The dust is always undisturbed. A bench that might cost a military driver a month’s wages is only out in the weather for show.</p><p>Amelia has gotten better at hiding it, even smiling in response, but she never finds jokes about dodging bullets to be funny. She was shot twice during Operation GRANBY in Iraq. The first time, it was the fault of a twat who couldn’t properly clear a corner. Instead of front-line Support, Amelia was suddenly acting as lead infantryman for a squad down to half its numbers.</p><p>They gave her the Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Service to thank her for getting the rest of her idiots back to base in one piece. Amelia rolled her eyes, gave the wound in her arm just enough time to heal, and went right back out into the desert. Still front-line, still <em>only</em> meant to be Support.</p><p>Still meaningless when their commanding officer put his foot down on a mine. When everyone froze in shock, and Thomas was too shocked to yet begin screaming, Amelia went to work and effectively took over the bloody squad. The medical officer stabilized Thomas, and two of their youngest infantry soldiers were assigned to carry him back to base for an airlift to Medical. Thomas would ultimately lose the whole of his left leg, but not his life.</p><p>The others wanted to go back for proper reassignment. Amelia knew they had to go forward. She was not supposed to be leading this operation, but it was an intelligence mission, and she was the only standing member of the Intelligence Corps they had available. The others were a bit preoccupied by Iraqi codes and burning oil wells, among other significant problems.</p><p>The infantry and other Support soldiers decided to follow Amelia’s lead. They found what they were looking for. Sent the information where it needed to go. Interrupted an ambush that might have saved them an entire regiment.</p><p>For Amelia, the rest of the Iraqi conflict ran along similar veins. She was the “pretty little Intelligence lass” who became known for fearlessness, icy rationale and reasoning while under fire, and minor fits of insubordination that would ultimately save lives, and was thus quietly brushed aside.</p><p>She was never fearless. Those who claimed to be fearless were often the first to run. She was terrified, all the time, and even more so when her tour finally ended and she was allowed to return to London.</p><p>London meant reporting to her commanding officer in MI6 after a year-long stint in the field.</p><p>Instead of her report being delivered privately, Adams had company. Standing with her CO was a man in a clean and properly pressed uniform, one who seemed familiar. Before a briefing could even occur, he presented Amelia with her second commendation, the Distinguished Service Order.</p><p>Amelia was not inclined to speechlessness. She’d done <em>nothing </em>to earn that. Nothing!</p><p>She looked up and finally recognized the soldier as one of those she’d saved by holding the squad together the first time a mission soured on them. Adams informed her that her medal-dispensing soldier was a member of the royal family, and the reason she was in for a transfer and new assignment.</p><p>By the next morning, she was a high-ranking officer within the hierarchy of MI5, all because one of the Lascelles decided he wanted Amelia Tyler to coordinate and lead the security team that protected his wife and children.</p><p>Domestic security wasn’t exactly what she’d signed up for, but the weather was nicer than Iraq. Off-duty, the husband and wife were…normal. Entirely too normal. It rubbed her the wrong way, but Amelia was too polite to say otherwise. Their children, however, were delightful, and though she could not spend much time with them when not on the job, they helped the long hours pass.</p><p>Amelia Tyler met Queen Elizabeth II while holding her young charge’s hand to escort her to the toilet. Her Majesty swept down and all but kidnapped Amelia’s charge, exclaiming that it had been far too long since they’ve seen one another. Amelia, bewildered and not certain what to do when the abductor of one of her charges was the bloody <em>Queen</em>, followed a few paces behind and tried to appear as if everything were entirely normal.</p><p>By 1995, she was a frequent visitor to the Frogmore House thanks to the Lascelles. Then she became permanent staff when the Lascelles went overseas; MI6 was then on the clock for their safety, not MI5.</p><p>By the first of 1996, the Queen had made it clear that she was fond of Amelia Tyler’s person, methods, and results. Amelia made it clear that she was fond of the position, herself.</p><p>In February, she met her first magicians. Amelia was praised for handling the situation perfectly, for all that she’d known magic was real (and that this was not an elaborate prank) for all of five fucking minutes.</p><p>The next day, the Queen named Amelia Tyler as the head of a brand new branch of MI5, code-named Hadrian’s Wall. Amelia accepted the promotion with good grace, as was expected of her. Then she spent a good half-hour beneath her new desk to hyperventilate into a paper sack she found in the rubbish bin.</p><p>Afterwards, she got on with the business of trying to organize what would need to be a small, secretive, and ultimately quite powerful organization hidden within the bureaucracy of MI5. She also ordered the Lord Black to get a damned telephone. Owls are interesting creatures for spreading the post, but they’re not exactly a common sight in an office building.</p><p>Sorting through hundreds upon hundreds of personnel files, searching for those minds with the right sort of flex to deal with magic and magicians and bloody <em>owls</em> gave her a week-long migraine. It was far easier to invite Sir Lupin to the building, line up a set of candidates, and have the man perform blatant magic in front of them.</p><p>The ones who asked intelligent questions made it to the second round. The rest went back to their current jobs within MI5. That meant she needed something a bit more suitable than wand-waving to narrow things down.</p><p>“Sirius can turn into a Newfoundland,” Sir Lupin pointed out. “That’s about as impressive as one can get without introducing your new underlings to a dragon.”</p><p>“Can we?” Amelia asked, wanting to bury her face in her hands. She’d read the histories that Her Majesty suggested. She’d witnessed the naming of the war mages. For her, it was beyond obvious that magic was real.</p><p>Why did MI5 have to be staffed by so many stubborn realists who didn’t even believe in ghosts?</p><p>“Only when you’re ready to dispose of them,” Sir Lupin said, sipping at his tea. “I suppose he could bring his cousin, Nymphadora Tonks. She’s a Metamorphmagus, like Nizar, but she was born with the ability.”</p><p>“Two shapeshifters?” Amelia was intrigued; it might solve her difficulties, given that a magic-casting damned <em>war mage</em> was not enough for her candidates to fully give it a go on believing magic to be real.</p><p>“An Animagus, like Sirius—that’s mastery of the internal self, the mind. It’s hard to do, and it takes dedication to learn the magic. You have to be willing to confront who you are at the deepest level and not be frightened by what you see. A Metamorphmagus is a mastery of the external self. It requires a lot less navel-gazing, but Nizar says that it is far harder to learn. An Animagus is triggering an internal, automatic shift into a new form; a Metamorphmagus is relying on magic and memory to make a controlled change.”</p><p>“You sound like a school teacher,” Amelia commented, and regretted it when Sir Lupin flushed.</p><p>“Ah. Yes. I was. For a year.” His smile was far too sad. “I did enjoy it, but there are too many parents who would fear a werewolf in the classroom.”</p><p>“You’re a war mage,” Amelia pointed out. She wasn’t certain of all the details yet in regards to Sir Lupin being an honest-to-God werewolf, but she had come to know the man in the weeks since their first meeting. He was pleasant, not terrible on the eyes in the slightest, intelligent, and sharp-witted when he chose, though he often waited to act until success was a certainty rather than a gamble.</p><p>When Amelia first met with Lord Black in her new office, she looked to his cousin and knew at once that she was in deep trouble. Magical Auror Nymphadora Tonks had magenta-colored hair, fiery brown eyes, a beautiful quirk of a nose, a brilliant smile, and spun a wand in her hand as quickly as she shifted her appearance to resemble a punk-dressed man. Then she was back to being a gorgeous woman in street punk gear, and off they went to scare the hell out of Amelia’s second-round recruits.</p><p>A human abruptly becoming a black Newfoundland dog and a magenta-haired girl who promptly mimicked the appearance of every potential employee in the room was quite the convincing argument. Amelia did take pity on those who promptly wet their trousers, and allowed them to depart discreetly in order to clean up. The NDAs they’d signed would keep them from speaking a word about magic to anyone. If they violate the terms MI5 laid down, Amelia won’t be the one they will have to worry about.</p><p>Finally, Amelia had a team. They’re building an entirely new set of rules and policies to accommodate the many magicians of the United Kingdom, the war mages, and the private school of Hogwarts. She was coordinating with mundane and magical construction crews to build a modern magical prison that fit the standards of compassion in Britain. Tales of that medieval horror on its uncharted island off the British coast had chilled Amelia’s bones. The Queen was appalled and angry that such a prison still existed, standing in direct violation of Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights.</p><p>She still can’t stop thinking about Sir Remus Lupin and Auror Nymphadora Tonks. Sarah-Samantha was a desperate effort in trying to distract herself from a war mage and a magical police officer.</p><p>It didn’t work very well. Sometimes being bi is a complete pain in the arse.</p><p>Amelia finishes her morning run and sits down on the last walled garden that lines the street. The family who normally resides here is vacationing in France, and the invading squirrels certainly won’t mind if she lingers. While catching her breath, Amelia watches as a few rays of sunlight pierce through London’s perpetual damp.</p><p>It’s Saturday, sixteenth March. She plans for it to be a quiet day working with her minions as they continue the political processes they’ve put into careful motion.</p><p>She can’t introduce Her Majesty to Wizarding Britain until Wizarding Britain has a Minister elected to welcome her, but that election is only a fortnight distant. It doesn’t leave them with much time to plan.</p><p>Amelia frowns. She doesn’t like walking into any situation blind. She wants to meet with the candidates for Minister for Magic, but doesn’t know if any of the three would agree to it. Some awareness of who the Queen will be discussing policy with once the election is confirmed would be useful, and it’s her job to have that information ready for Her Majesty before the Queen even thinks to ask.</p><p>Whether the new Minister for Magic will speak to Her Majesty in private or not is irrelevant. The war mages are keen on making certain that Wizarding Britain remembers they have a ruler on the throne they are supposed to acknowledge. Her Majesty is pleased to step out into the Wizarding public to deliver that reminder personally—whether the new Minister likes it or not.</p><p>Amelia is about to drop down from the wall and finish her run back to her flat when her mobile rings. She flips it open, glances at the number, and pinches the bridge of her nose before answering. “This is Tyler.”</p><p>“Madam Tyler, there has been an incident.”</p><p>She breathes in, slowly, feeling war-honed senses come to life. “What sort of incident, Johnson?”</p><p>“The Lord Deslizarse called it in about five minutes ago. Once we confirmed, we called you.”</p><p>Amelia scowls. “I’m well aware that you are capable of following basic protocol! What sort of <em>incident</em>, Johnson?”</p><p>“Oh. Er.” Her assistant’s voice squeaks a little before he answers. “That would be a Level 2, ma’am.”</p><p>“Thank God it’s not a Level 1,” Amelia says, and then her eyes widen. “Fuck a fried rubber duckie, Johnson.”</p><p>Wizarding Britain has just announced that it’s at war.</p><p>Johnson makes a strangled sound that might have been a laugh. “I would prefer not to, ma’am.”</p><p>“Of course not.” Amelia rubs her forehead as she thinks. “All right. Send a car to my flat, Johnson. I need to get to Number Ten as quickly as possible to assess the situation.”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am. Would you like any of us to join you?”</p><p>Amelia considers it. “Two only. I’m a known face to all the war mages, but they’ve yet to meet most of you. I’ll call for further assistance if I think it necessary in dealing with their Ministry, but it’s more likely that I’m going to be sending you lot across the whole of Britain this morning to ascertain the collateral damage.”</p><p>She can all but hear Johnson grimace. “We’ll be certain to pack sack lunches, then. The car will be ready for you in twenty minutes, Madam Tyler. I will phone you updates if I receive them before you do.”</p><p>“Good. Take care, Johnson.” Amelia hangs up the phone and straps it to her wrist again. If she treats the run home as a sprint, she’ll have ten minutes at her flat to shower and change before the car arrives.</p><p>She hopes last night’s date left her a scone. It might be the last thing she eats for a while.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*          *          *          *</p><p> </p><p>When her colleagues among the M.L.E. are through interviewing Amelia Bones regarding the events of last night, the first person she expects to see is her own secretary, Ila Patil. Instead, she has a cup of hot tea thrust under her nose by a ginger in horn-rimmed spectacles. Amelia is too seasoned at her job to blink at him, revealing the surprise she feels, but does not hesitate to accept the tea. “Mister Weasley. I was expecting Ila.”</p><p>“She’s a bit busy moving your office, ma’am,” Percy Weasley replies, straightening back up. He has a stiff bearing that’s softened by the tired slump to his shoulders. It makes him appear far less pompous than is his wont. “I’ll be returning to help her shortly, but I was nearest the tea pot when the M.L.E. released you.”</p><p>Amelia doesn’t sip at the tea until she’s used wandless magic, perfected over her years in office, to make certain it is not poisoned or drugged. “Thank you for the tea, Mister Weasley.” Then the rest of his words catch up to her. “What do you mean, moving my office? I’ve just done that!”</p><p>Weasley presses his lips together. Then he removes his glasses to clean them, wipes his eyes, and puts them back on. It makes her realize that there isn’t a bit of pompousness left to him, not right now. She wonders when he finally left that unpleasant mannerism behind.</p><p>Last night, possibly. When so many were fighting for their lives against You-Know-Who’s people.</p><p>“Ma’am, the British Ministry of Magic is officially at war,” Weasley says. The stiffness in his shoulders is reflected by his voice. “By our own law, we <em>cannot </em>be without a Minister for Magic. With Auror Scrimgeour dead and Barrister Thicknesse…unfit…the job of interim Minister officially falls to you.”</p><p>Amelia stares at him. Then she says, “Bugger <em>me</em>.”</p><p>Weasley winces. “Yes, well. I don’t believe there is anyone in Britain who would be pleased to hear that right now, Minister.”</p><p><em>Except Thicknesse</em>, Amelia thinks, but shakes that thought away. “But the election—” she begins to say, foolishly, but Weasley shakes his head.</p><p>“There will still be the election, as scheduled, ma’am,” Weasley informs her, and then presses his lips together again. Nerves or grief, she doesn’t know. She does not yet know this particular Weasley enough to be certain she’s reading him correctly at all. “But that is a month distant. I apologize for being the bearer of such news, but you are needed now.” Weasley pauses. “I think having the recent head of the M.L.E. as a war-time Minister for Magic is quite possibly the best gift Wizarding Britain could receive, given the…the circumstances.”</p><p>Amelia sips at her tea again, setting her thoughts in motion and letting them stride along the multitude of paths she now has to consider. “Ila didn’t want to inform me, did she?”</p><p>Weasley’s smile is brief, but bright and guileless and <em>young</em>. “She’s just learnt that she’s to be Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic a month earlier than planned. She’s shuffling your office so as to…well. We’re all trying to distract ourselves for one reason or another right now, ma’am.”</p><p>“I see.” Amelia considers him. “Did you lose anyone last night, Mister Weasley?”</p><p>The grief is brief, but honest, before he adopts a polite mask. “Junior Auror Clearwater, ma’am. We—we went to school together, and dated for a time. The M.L.E. is hoping that I will be kind enough to inform her family.”</p><p>“And instead, you bring me tea,” Amelia notes, feeling a flare of sympathy. She had only Susan to lose, but Susan is safe at Hogwarts, and Amelia will see her the moment it is dubbed safe for the students to join their attacked or injured families. Others are not nearly so fortunate.</p><p>“As I said: we are distracting ourselves as best we can,” Weasley agrees. “After I visit the Clearwater home, I’ll be returning to your office.”</p><p>“Will you, then?” Amelia feels a moment of bitter amusement. “Inviting yourself to join my political ticket, are you, Mister Weasley?”</p><p>Weasley doesn’t deny it, which would have irritated her. She has not been blind to the fact that he has been quietly, expertly divorcing himself from Cornelius Fudge’s idiocy for some weeks now. “Ila Patil is an excellent secretary and will serve you well as an excellent Undersecretary, but she’s never done that job before. I have just been made redundant from that position by Cornelius Fudge’s unfortunate…murder.” Weasley swallows. “I can tell her what she’ll need to know. If you still require my assistance once she is aware of her duties, then that will be your decision to make, Minister. For now, it’s much less decision and far more necessity.”</p><p>“Quite right,” Amelia says in approval. His eyes widen in surprise before he masterfully hides it again. For a Weasley Gryffindor, he is quite good at certain Slytherin political traits. “Do not forget to give Ila coffee, Undersecretary Weasley. She’ll neglect it out of concern for all else.”</p><p>Weasley lifts his chin. “There is only one Undersecretary to the Minister, ma’am.”</p><p>Amelia snorts. “Not right now, there isn’t. I need the two of you more than I need to pay attention to the trivial limitations of job titles. Now, off with you. I doubt any of us will sleep today, so I expect you to return to show me where the absolute bloody hell my new office is.”</p><p>Weasley grimaces in momentary apology. “It’s the usual location. I apologize. We’re trying to do away with some of Minister Fudge’s choices of décor as quickly as possible. I know you might not care, but after the attacks, some of it is—it’s inappropriate.”</p><p>“I trust your judgment, Mister Weasley.” Amelia knows he has rarely heard that a day in his life based on the way he blinks as if slapped. “We will all do as we must.”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” he replies, and hurries on his way. As he passes by a crowd, he is briefly pulled into an embrace by Arthur Weasley, who looks a bit mussed and filthy. His son doesn’t protest; Amelia hopes that is a sign of a ridiculous family rift healing itself.</p><p>Then she finishes her tea and stands. Weasley is correct. There is much to be done, and she was just handed over the responsibility for the whole of Wizarding Britain. “Folstoy!” she calls, gaining the attention of the closest Auror to pass by. “Get me Slytherin. I need to speak with him.”</p><p>“Which one?” Folstoy asks, looking a bit bug-eyed. Honestly, the Slytherin siblings have been in the bloody paper, and still the Ministry is full of fools who think it a lark and a trick.</p><p>Amelia frowns. “Nizar Slytherin, Folstoy. Tell him it is regarding our war mage problem.”</p><p>Folstoy now simply looks constipated, but Amelia has no sympathy for him. “Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>When she is approached by the younger of the two infamous Slytherin brothers, Amelia feels unwanted trepidation. Their first—and so far, only—meeting had not ended well. She took responsibility for that failure of temper, and of thought, but aside from his random hints delivered via house-elf, has no idea of what he thinks of her.</p><p>“Madam Bones.” Nizar Slytherin has no remaining hint of his impeccable grooming, not after a night spent fighting in the worst of the skirmishes. He has dried blood from untreated wounds on his face and hands, his robes are torn and hanging open to reveal rather old-fashioned shirt and trousers beneath, and he smells like…</p><p>Well, Amelia isn’t certain what scent is clinging to him, but it is highly unpleasant. “Thank you for agreeing to see me, Professor Slytherin.”</p><p>“<em>Protectoris</em>,” he corrects, his normally hazel eyes shining like grey steel. “If you ask me to discuss the war mages, and we are using titles, then it is <em>Protectoris</em>, Madam, or <em>Bellum dux Magum</em>.”</p><p>“Then I unfortunately must be Minister,” Amelia responds, enjoying the expression of momentary bafflement that crosses his bronze features. “The British Ministry of Magic must have a sitting Minister for Magic in times of war. I’ve no choice in the matter. The vote next month will decide if it is a permanent placement.”</p><p>“I see.” Slytherin draws in a breath through his nostrils and releases it slowly from his mouth, a calming technique similar to the one Ila has been trying—vainly—to teach Amelia. “What is your war mage <em>problem, </em>Minister Bones?”</p><p>“That there are too few of you,” Amelia says bluntly. “Can this be rectified?”</p><p>Slytherin stares at her, rubs at his forehead with two fingers, and then shakes his head. “Do we need more war mages? Yes, and those who are excellent candidates are already on my very short list, Minister. Will it make Wizarding Britain’s populace possibly feel more secure to know that there are more of us? Maybe. Will it do any good in the war effort at the moment? Not at all.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because the irritating walking corpse ordered attacks <em>only </em>against Wizarding Britain!” Slytherin snaps. “Wizarding Britain as a whole does not recognize the war mages, so we are no more powerful now than we were yesterday. Even the attacks against non-magical families were individual efforts, not raids conducted on the orders of a war leader.”</p><p>Amelia frowns. “I don’t understand.”</p><p>Slytherin rubs his forehead again in the same place. She wonders if he is dealing with a headache, or if it is a sign of frustration. “It’s old magic, Minister, and it obeys very old rules. When there were war mages in number upon this isle, they made a pact with all of those who sat upon this isle’s many thrones. A king or queen of Britain cannot send a war mage to attack another who is not actively threatening their kingdom. We can only defend throne and land against acts of war. It was a safeguard meant to ensure those many rulers could not use us against each other in their constant bids for power and conquest. Those rules also exclude personal vendettas. By the old standards, Voldemort—” Amelia hates that she flinches at the name, “—is a war leader. Unless he commands a direct attack against the part of Britain that recognizes a war mage, as the Queen has recognized us, then it means nothing. If you want war mages who are useful as more than mere political tools, then you’ll need to convince Wizarding Britain to accept us for who and what we are.”</p><p>Amelia thinks she now has her own headache to contend with. “Thank you for giving me my second political nightmare of the day, one which immediately follows the first.”</p><p>“You’re welcome.” To his credit, Slytherin also seems frustrated.</p><p>There is one thing she has forgotten, and this, at least, she can easily remedy. “Thank you for last night. I do believe your timely visit saved my life.”</p><p>“Thank Salazar,” Slytherin says in a dismissive tone. “He is the one who insisted I refine what talent for Divination I have.” Then he shakes his head and looks at her. “My apologies; you are welcome. Please do not leave yourself in such a vulnerable position again, not when there is a fucking walking corpse wandering the isle who would happily see you dead.”</p><p>Amelia bites back a smile. “I will take that under advisement. Please be kind enough to send word when you have arranged for the titling of more war mages. If I’m to convince Wizarding Britain to become fond of war mages for more than just historical reasons, I would like to be able to contribute to your interesting news articles. To support them, of course.”</p><p>Slytherin raises an eyebrow. “To do so publicly before the election might damage your chances of retaining the Minister’s seat.”</p><p>“Those who would vote against my placement would vote against my placement regardless of my stance on war mages,” Amelia replies dryly. Then she pauses. It’s a self-serving question, but she has one family member left to her. She will ask. “If You-Know-Who were to attack Hogwarts, would the war mages be capable of responding?”</p><p>Slytherin’s grin is sudden, sharp, and quite bloodthirsty. “I am Hogwarts’ named Protector, Minister Bones. That would come into play before the war mage title had the chance to respond to magic and land. Of course, given that Her Majesty named Hogwarts’ land and village as part of my legal estates, Voldemort would then have to contend with both magics. Alas, but I do not think he is stupid enough to try.”</p><p>“Good,” Amelia says, even though she is chilled by what he has just admitted.</p><p>Nizar Slytherin effectively owns Hogwarts. She has no idea what plans he might undertake that could threaten the only school of magic in Britain.</p><p>Amelia has no idea how to ask questions of his intentions for the school, not yet. For now, she decides on diplomacy and gratitude. “My niece will be remaining within Hogwarts’ walls until this war is done and You-Know-Who is defeated. Thank you for ensuring her safety.”</p><p>Slytherin gives her a searching look before nodding. “Again: you are welcome. Excuse me, please. I need to collect certain individuals. I will send you word as to the names you will need to endorse by this afternoon. Return your chosen statements to me immediately.”</p><p>“Sunday’s paper?” Amelia allows herself a real smile. “You do not dilly-dally, do you?”</p><p>Slytherin simply looks annoyed. “Monday, actually. Besides, if you want inefficient allies, go find someone who can raise Fudge from the dead. I’m busy.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">*          *          *          *</p><p> </p><p>Ila Patil loves her job. She truly does. She was prepared for the leap from being senior secretary to the Head of Magical Law Enforcement to, potentially, becoming Senior Undersecretary to a Minister, if Madam Bones were to win the election.</p><p>She just wasn’t expecting it to be necessary to become Undersecretary right <em>now</em>.</p><p>“You’ll do fine.”</p><p>Ila looks up from her near-frantic shrinking of Amelia’s many necessary belongings for this transfer of office to find Percy Weasley standing before her, holding out a cup of coffee. “Uh?” is her elegant response.</p><p>Weasley takes pity on her, gently grasps her left hand, and pushes a coffee mug against her palm until her fingers close around it. “I know you’ve been awake all night. You need that.”</p><p>“Oh. Right.” Ila sips bitter coffee and tries to recall what the last five hours have been like. “Wait, you’ve been helping me the entire time, haven’t you?” she asks in startled realization.</p><p>Weasley smiles. “A bit. Well, actually, Madam Bones named us co-Undersecretaries until everything is straightened out and you know what your job will be like, so you might have to put up with me a bit longer—possibly even long enough to remember that I exist!”</p><p>Ila stares at him. Then she blurts out, “Oh, God, thank you!” and starts frantically drinking her coffee. When the mug is empty, she says, “I’ve no idea what an Undersecretary does! I thought I had the full month to study up on it!”</p><p>“An Undersecretary does whatever the Minister for Magic doesn’t wish to do, usually, but I don’t think Madam Bones is that type.” Weasley sounds amused and bitter, but Ila supposes that anyone working for Fudge would be less than pleased about the experience. Even the fact that Cornelius Fudge is dead does not change the fact that in life, he was a complete shite.</p><p>“No. I suppose…dealing with the press?” Ila has done that. “Records-keeping?”</p><p>“Only if you don’t hire minions to the lower positions to make certain the workload is spread out properly,” Weasley says. “And I doubt Madam Bones will be so, er, paranoid as to ban you from having your own necessary assistants.”</p><p>“He did <em>what?</em>” Ila sputters, outraged.</p><p>Weasley only smiles. “It’s done and over with. We’ll be able to do our jobs.”</p><p>Ila nods. Done and over with. Well, so was the peace she’d once been promised would be ever-lasting after You-Know-Who’s defeat in 1981. <em>He</em> has returned with a vengeance that makes her afraid for her entire family.</p><p>She glances over at Weasley, who has perched on the edge of the nearest barren desk. He is gazing at the wall, but with unfocused eyes, as if he is either tired or deep in thought. She remembers his thoughtfulness from their school days—when he was not being a pompous arse, at least. “Percy?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Ila glances down at her empty mug and makes a decision. “When we’ve a free moment, would you like to go for a coffee in Muggle London with me? After you get new spectacle frames, at least.”</p><p>Percy stares at her, baffled. “Are you—are you quite serious?”</p><p>Ila eyes the mug again. She could use more coffee already. “About the spectacles? Certainly. Those are very 1950s, Percy, and it’s 1996.”</p><p>“Oh. But, I meant about the…the coffee?” Percy responds weakly. It’s the least confident she’s seen him act since he was a firstie. It’s sort of cute.</p><p>“Yes, I do,” Ila says decisively. “If we’re going to work together for the next month, then we should know each other well. We can’t be arguing procedure or having ridiculous personality conflicts before the Minister and the whole of the Ministry, can we?”</p><p>Percy slowly nods. “Of course not. Well.” He adjusts the large horn-rimmed frames on his face. “If you’re so keen to update my sense of fashion, any suggestions?”</p><p>“Something that lets a girl see more of your face,” Ila suggests, grinning. “It’s far easier to get a date when someone can see more of what they’re in for.”</p><p>“Date. A date.” Percy blinks a few times. “I will take your suggestions under advisement, Senior Undersecretary Patil. Shall we get back to work? We might be able to complete the transfer before afternoon tea if we push for it.”</p><p>Ila nods. “That is a sound plan, Senior Undersecretary Weasley.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>Salazar can’t stop the wartime habit of keeping his eyes moving as he waits. He watches the traffic, the people passing by on the walkways—even the bloody rooftops. He doesn’t like standing here in the open, presenting as such an obvious target, but this is Downing Street. He would like to hope that Voldemort’s idiots have not yet grown the stones to attack the exterior of 10 Downing, or the public entrances to the Ministry of Magic, in broad daylight. The Death Eaters are traditionalists, ones who are much too fond of the International Statute of Secrecy. Even the ones who went rogue last night to attack non-magical citizens only targeted families who lived far enough away from other houses so as not to attract witnesses. <em>Malditos bastardos.</em></p><p>The government car arrives five minutes after his watch beeps an alert for the appointed time. He watches as Amelia Tyler emerges from the back, quickly flanked by two suited men and women from the new agency within MI5. They both bear the obvious bulges of pistols under their coats. Amelia forewent her preferred pencil skirt for trousers that match her suit top, but if she is armed, she is far less obvious about it.</p><p>“Madam Tyler. You’re late,” he says in greeting.</p><p>“My apologies,” Amelia replies. “I was not at home when the call came in, but I’m here now. I understand there is a situation.”</p><p>“There is. Come with me, and try not to mind the horror that is the more private hidden entrance to Britain’s Ministry of Magic.” Salazar turns and leads them along, passing 10 Downing Street and getting a brief nod from one of the undercover agents who always linger nearby. That one must be ending their shift, or they would never be so obvious about identifying themselves, even to a known ally.</p><p>“We’re going <em>into</em> the Ministry of Magic. Directly.” Amelia sounds surprised. It is not exactly something they ever discussed as a possibility.</p><p>Salazar has only to glance to his side to see Amelia. She is quick to be exactly where she needs to be, and he’s quite fond of that sort of efficiency. “Yes. I thought you’d prefer to see the chaos for yourself before we speak to the Prime Minister.”</p><p>Tyler nods. “While that isn’t how I thought this would be handled—yes. Thank you, Lord Salazar. Prime Minister Major will appreciate the lack of back-and-forth between our agencies if we bring him all that he’ll need to know at once.”</p><p>“Who did you bring with you?” Salazar asks as they cross a side street on the walkway. He veers left into a building that they normally cannot see, but his magic is holding the typical illusion at bay. Fortunately, they pass through without question, and he can release his hold on a very strong, very <em>old </em>ward that did not like being displaced, no matter how temporary the need.</p><p>“This is Ted Jenkins. I’m Jill Smith,” the woman says to introduce them both. Those are either very English names, or adequate false ones. Smith has short brown hair and a number of gun calluses on her square-shaped hands, marking her as former British military—as is the man, with his muddy eyes and a red desert tan on what used to be delicate northern skin. Bodyguards only; he thinks it safe to assume that Madam Tyler put the rest of her new department to work in assisting those non-magical families who were attacked.</p><p>“A bathroom, then?” Amelia asks in dry amusement when the door swings shut behind them. The line of commodes has the much older styling of carved wooden doors and panels for privacy, not to mention the pull chains that are finally beginning to pass out of common use.</p><p>“Agent Jenkins, Agent Smith, and Madam Tyler—please choose a commode, place one foot upon the lid, and pull on the handle hanging above you,” Salazar instructs.</p><p>“ON THE COMMODE?” Smith blurts in horror.</p><p>“How is that supposed to do—<em>anything</em>?” Jenkins adds, his jaw hanging open.</p><p>“Magic, you idiots,” Amelia says in blunt frustration. She immediately does as Salazar instructed and disappears in a flush of water. Salazar thinks again that Her Majesty chose well when she appointed Madam Tyler to head the United Kingdom’s Magical Liaison Department.</p><p>“Do we…are we traveling through the pipes? The water?” Smith asks, staring at the place Tyler had just stood.</p><p>“No. It is only a signal to arrange for your transport into the Ministry itself,” Salazar tells them, which is mostly true. It’s actually a fascinating dismantling and partial reassembly of many Port Keys, all of them working in tandem. He decides not to mention that the system wouldn’t work for them at all if he hadn’t arranged for their entry in advance. “Please hurry along. I’ve been awake all night killing idiots in defence of others, and we’ve a schedule to keep.”</p><p>It’s the last part that seems to break through their reluctance. <em>Recent</em> former military, then. Jenkins and Smith don’t hesitate to reach up to grasp the chain, place a foot upon the lid, and activate the system that causes them to vanish.</p><p>Salazar holds back a grimace as he does the same to join them. He despises this means of entry, but with an official declaration of war in place, the Ministry has activated the full might of its anti-Apparition wards. Not even a war mage can pass through them. Inconvenient, that, but even these wards will cease to impair him if Wizarding Britain ever gains sense enough to recognize the war mages as part of their world.</p><p>Granted, Salazar believes it might be easier to pick up the whole of Hogewáþ with his bare hands and walk her across the length of the isle. Nizar is much less pessimistic about their chances, but even he doesn’t think they’ll gain that recognition until the next generation of magicians controls the Wizengamot.</p><p>When he arrives at the edge of the Ministry Atrium, he finds the other three waiting for him. Amelia is watching the orderly chaos, the skin around her eyes tight with displeasure, but otherwise is putting on a great show of equanimity. Smith and Jenkins flank her, though Salazar suspects it is only their military training that is keeping them from gaping at the spectacle.</p><p>Magicians in varying states of dress—and styles of dress—are hurrying back and forth on their necessary tasks. Most are Ministry employees, but a great number of them are the volunteers who joined the M.L.E. during the night to help defend Wizarding Britain. Too many of them still sport injuries that have barely seen treatment, but St. Mungo’s reached capacity before dawn.</p><p>“They have no idea how to fight a war, do they?” Amelia asks in a quiet murmur. “Or are they simply out of practice, given the span of time between the end of the previous one and the beginning of this one? That is not an unheard of phenomenon.”</p><p>“A bit, but the Ministry did not do a very good job during the previous war,” Salazar responds, trying to keep the bitterness from his voice. He could not guide that war but for his work in shadow, and it was years of frustration—years of hoping that his little brother’s rather insane Gryffindor parents didn’t get themselves killed before they could birth Harry James Potter.</p><p>He does not have to do that this time. He is not going to stand as witness to magicians who falter on the battlefield and are slaughtered for it. Nizar will be at his side, and they’ve allies that know how to stand and fight against everything Voldemort might attempt. Such thoughts warm him as much as they terrify him, but that is a fact of war that has not changed since his very first battle, centuries upon centuries ago.</p><p>“How many casualties?” Jenkins asks, though his eyes are lingering on a pair of magicians whose wardrobe forgot that 1658 was quite a long time ago.</p><p>“Thirty-five known non-magical casualties,” Salazar answers, “but those are only the ones we’ve been able to confirm for certain. They were committed by rogue elements of Voldemort’s followers, not following a direct command.”</p><p>“Using the opportunity to sow chaos.” Amelia presses her lips together in restrained anger. “And given the average night of fatalities in Britain, it may be some time before it is known if the other causes of death were mundane.”</p><p>“There is nothing mundane about death.” Salazar glances at Jenkins. “Some of them are rather firm in their desire to continue to emulate their ancestors, if it’s the clothing that concerns you.”</p><p>“More that I found it baffling. Thank you for the explanation, Lord Salazar,” Jenkins says.</p><p>“What about the, er, magical casualties?” Smith asks. To her credit, she only stumbles a little bit, but her concern is genuine.</p><p>“A very large number of families were attacked, but there have been only eighteen confirmed casualties. Most of them held positions within the Ministry.”</p><p>Amelia nods. “And the enemy?”</p><p>Just mention of them makes Salazar wish to be holding his wand. “Fifteen arrests or deaths, all of them confirmed to be Death Eaters. I would prefer a higher count, but that is the trouble with raiding parties versus a battlefield.”</p><p>“Too many bloody unexpected variables,” Jenkins mutters under his breath. “I hate that shit.”</p><p>“Sirius?” Salazar asks when he sees the other man approach. At least the mania of battle has worn off a bit, and he looks more appropriately somber for the circumstances.</p><p>“Salazar. Madam Tyler. Guests,” Sirius nods at them.</p><p>“Your Grace,” Amelia replies in kind. “Are you injured?”</p><p>“Nope. Not my blood. Salazar, if you get it done now, you’ll have the opportunity to meet with Minister Bones. Otherwise?” Sirius lifts his hands into the air and shrugs. “God knows. I thought the Wizengamot was a madhouse. This is worse.”</p><p>“They confirmed her as interim Minister?” Even if it’s a temporary position until the election, that is a boon Salazar had <em>not</em> expected.</p><p>Sirius’s grin is sudden and sharp-edged. Miss Granger is correct; it does make him resemble his mad grandfather. “After we confirmed the new Wizengamot seats, yes. There will be a lot of unhappy Death Eaters once those new names become public knowledge. Several seats that Voldemort’s people held now belong to those who want nothing to do with him.”</p><p>“Ran out of family members, did they?” Salazar asks, amused.</p><p>Sirius snorts. “Several of them. Urith Avery was rather spitefully pleased to point out that she is the only Avery left who is not in Azkaban or happily deceased. Come along; if you’ll all follow me, I can take you right to her.”</p><p>They find Madam Bones in the midst of directing further chaos. Recognizable Aurors trained in basic magical first aid are helping other Ministry employees to create spaces for assisting those who are still injured. Ila Patil and Percy Weasley are assisting Madam Bones, and neither are afraid to raise their voices to make certain the right patient sees the right Auror, or to verbally flay someone and remind them to wait their bloody turn. The moment they notice Sirius, Salazar, and their guests, they completely take over the task, freeing Madam Bones from the responsibility.</p><p>Madam Bones wastes no time. She strides forward and halts in front of them. “Lord Salazar, thank you for your assistance. You must be our new representative from Her Majesty,” she says to Amelia.</p><p>Amelia smiles and extends her hand. “I am. Madam Amelia Tyler, Head of the Magical Liaison Agency within MI5, Her Majesty’s domestic Security Service. These are agents Jenkins and Smith, recent retirees from Her Majesty’s Armed Forces, who signed on with me during the formation of our new and necessary department.”</p><p>Madam Bones clasps Amelia’s hand in clear approval at both her manners and means of introduction. “Madam Amelia Bones of the Ancient House of Bones, Wizengamot member, recent head of our Magical Law Enforcement Division, and current interim Minister for Magic for the Ministry. It is a pleasure to meet you. I find myself glad that you’re willing to act as a go-between for myself and the Muggle Prime Minister, as I’m currently not certain when I would find the time to both meet with him, and to assure him that I am not Cornelius Fudge.”</p><p>Amelia raises an eyebrow. “Having experienced Cornelius Fudge for myself, I rather doubt Prime Minister Major would have any immediate expectations of such…manners. It’s the long-standing history of animosity between the two ministerial positions that will be difficult to navigate.”</p><p>Madam Bones looks resigned. “I’m aware of that difficulty, as well. Madam Bagnold, who held the position of Minister for Magic before Cornelius Fudge, did try to at least be less difficult than some of her predecessors, but I do believe Cornelius undid every single bit of progress she’d made before she resigned from her post.”</p><p>Amelia smiles. “Then we shall do our best to make things easier for you, for the Prime Minister, and for Her Majesty…and perhaps our war mages, as well.”</p><p>Madam Bones nods. “Let’s hope it is as easily spoken as done, then. Now: what do you need from me?”</p><p>Salazar alerts Jenkins and Smith of his departure with a gesture, glances at Sirius to let them know that the Duke of London will be remaining in their company, and slips away while Amelia and Madam Bones are engrossed in a discussion of necessary revisions of policy. He will rejoin Amelia when it’s time to move on to 10 Downing Street, but he isn’t needed for this.</p><p>He still wants to find it a bright spot that Cornelius Fudge is dead, and will never again trouble them with arrogant, pompous foolishness, but Salazar cannot forget the others who died with him—merely for the crime of living in the same house as the former Minister.</p><p>Salazar finds his brother in a small, private bathroom meant for higher-ranking Ministry staff, sicking up into a toilet. “You’re not usually one to sick up after a battle.” Not since the age of seventeen, at least.</p><p>“Fuck off.” Nizar grabs a daintily embroidered hand towel to wipe his face. “Tolerantu. I was starting to tire, and I can’t currently afford any slips.”</p><p>“Oh. That one.” Salazar tries not to make a face of disgust and does not succeed. Severus’s creation might be a good idea, but gods know he isn’t fond of the necessary vomiting afterwards. “Madam Tyler and Madam Bones are getting on well, so that is handled, and without further disaster.”</p><p>“Good. We’ve had enough disaster for the day. It will be everything else that might still bring more of it upon us.” Nizar retreats to the sink and rinses his mouth with cold water. “I assume you’ve already made the arrangements via telephone.”</p><p>Salazar retrieves the mobile phone from his pocket and holds it up. “Whenever we’ve finished at Downing Street, we’re welcome any time. It’s a bit more rushed on the introductions than Her Majesty would like, but she trusts our judgment.”</p><p>Nizar straightens up and scowls at the folded mobile. “How long have you had that?”</p><p>Salazar gives him an innocent shrug. “For a while. How else was anyone from the Underground to contact me while I was in Hogwarts?”</p><p>Nizar grants him that. “I suppose an owl or a Patronus would be a bit obvious, wouldn’t it? I want one, by the way.”</p><p>“Do you even know how to use a telephone?” Salazar counters, grinning.</p><p>“You push buttons and talk back at the person who answers. It isn’t that fucking difficult,” Nizar retorts.</p><p>Salazar nods. That was an accurate description, if a simplified one. “I’ll see what I can do.” He rubs at his beard, wishing for a shower that he has no time to indulge in. Even the idea of casting a cleaning charm is wearying. “While Her Majesty did say she would await us, and grant us the time we needed, I’d prefer to get this done as soon as possible.”</p><p>“Yes,” Nizar agrees, but he’s glaring at the mirror hanging over the sink. It is magicked to speak, but someone seems to have slapped shipping tape over the carved lips. “He has to know, Sal. That fucking noseless walking corpse has to <em>know</em> that to command a direct attack against non-magical Britain is to gain a war mage’s unwavering attention.”</p><p>Salazar nods. “We would certainly know otherwise after last night.”</p><p>“Why the fuck is that bastard only intelligent when it’s so fucking inconvenient for the rest of us?” Nizar growls.</p><p>“It’s a passing annoyance,” Salazar says. “You’ll be killing him soon enough.”</p><p>“No, I’ll be doing <em>something</em> to him soon enough. The cards still say he won’t fucking die.” Nizar runs his hands through his hair, breathes out, and nods. “All right. Now I can face people again and not stab them for daring to exist in my immediate vicinity. Does Minerva wish to join us?”</p><p>“Minerva thinks that we might be stacking the deck in the wrong direction,” Salazar responds. “She suggests it be Filius Flitwick instead.”</p><p>Nizar frowns. “Half-goblin dueling champion. Puts forward mixed-species rights and capabilities. Actually terrifying with a wand when he’s allowed to be. If you see Minerva before I do, please tell her that is an excellent idea. I assume Filius is fine with it?”</p><p>“He’s flattered, and a bit flustered, but I saw him in action during the night. He’ll make the sort of terrifying war mage that my old Court would have approved of.”</p><p>“Better old Castile and L<em>eón’s </em>ideas of a magical staff bearer than Myrddin’s,” Nizar says. Salazar has to agree; his Court would have had much more ease in comprehending the other three.</p><p>“Where is Severus?” Salazar asks, realizing that he is one of the few that hasn’t been seen since the madhouse of a fully staffed, half-panicked Ministry descended upon them.</p><p>“He took over some poor sod’s potions laboratory and conscripted them as an assistant, whether they were willing or not,” Nizar says. “He’s been working to replenish healing potions that are running low, both here and at St. Mungo’s.”</p><p>“Gods. I hadn’t realized—” Salazar feels an intense frustration for the fact that he cannot be everywhere at once. “He’ll need help with that.”</p><p>Nizar merely smirks. “I thought you’d be unable to resist, but it is true that another brewer at work would be a wise idea. Kingsley has been trying to contact other potions-makers and apothecaries, but most of them are still dealing with the attacks. I can handle the trip to Frogmore on my own, Sal. Everyone else is desperately needed here.”</p><p>He nods. Minerva is chivying her old co-workers in one M.L.E. department into being both useful and efficient about it. Nymphadora Tonks would be with the Aurors, at least until Nizar collects her. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black are off explaining to Kingsley, Madam Marchbanks, and new Head Auror Moody that while they were fortunate not to fight werewolves in battle yet, that doesn’t mean they <em>won’t</em>. The Ministry’s current methods for dealing with a werewolf will only drive more of them to join Voldemort. Even if they can’t yet change the laws, an announcement that it’s being considered would be beneficial to all except the walking corpse.</p><p>Before this morning, Salazar would have held no hope that such consideration would even make it to the Wizengamot to be discussed…but Death Eater deaths and arrests have tipped the balance of power in their favor. He doesn’t yet know if it is also enough to win Madam Bones the election, but he is not above bribing the undecided.</p><p>“Damn!” Salazar swears as he realizes a forgotten task. “I’m supposed to accompany Madam Tyler to Number Ten.”</p><p>“Oh, no, the horror. She might have to do the job to which she has been appointed without a magical escort,” Nizar says in a dust-dry voice. “I can make Sirius accompany her. He’s the Magical Duke over London; it would be an <em>insult</em> to the Prime Minister if he wasn’t present.”</p><p>“You’re right. I’d forgotten that, too.” Salazar forces himself to relax. Fighting and bloodshed bring out the worst of his paranoia, his unwillingness to allow loved ones from sight, but everyone involved are more than capable of taking care of themselves. He will manage; he has done so for a very long time now. “All right. I’ve some overseas contacts who might be able to help with the potions resupply, but I’ll find my own lab to confiscate in the meantime. Anything is better than waiting for our supplies to run out.”</p><p>Nizar takes an extra moment to towel the dried blood from his face and hair, makes certain his hands are clean, and then turns to face Salazar. “Come here, <em>pendejo</em>.”</p><p>Salazar steps forward and embraces his brother. “No foolishness, <em>hermanito</em>. You will survive what is to come.”</p><p>“You will, as well, or I’ll be having words with your idiotic corpse.”</p>
