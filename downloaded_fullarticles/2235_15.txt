    <p>It always came back to the Shrieking Shack.  Severus was beginning to lose count of how many times he had almost lost his life in the barely standing building.  And here he was again, not exactly risking his life, but close to.</p>
<p>They had spread out flattened cardboard boxes to make things a bit easier, but they did almost nothing to cushion his groaning back.  Magic could do many things, but easing the ravages of old age was a difficult one to pull off, given their already limited resources. He refused to complain. If she didn’t, neither would he.</p>
<p>His companion lay close by. It was January and unsafe to light fires. Hermione had done what she could with Arithmancy, and his camping stove was on most of the day, but that didn’t help much as frost crept over the boards patched haphazardly over broken windows. Their wands were being monitored. All of the old Order’s wands were being monitored. The moment they cast so much as a Scourgify, Aurors would be down on them – that was if they were lucky. So they lay within touching distance in a half-hearted hope they might share body heat, without the embarrassment of actually sharing body heat.</p>
<p>Normally it didn’t matter. Severus was out like a light the moment his head touched cardboard. But distilling Dittany allowed for no let-up, and five hours crouched over a cauldron was taking its toll.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had fallen asleep. Or perhaps he was teetering on the edge. Either way, he was sure he wouldn’t have noticed if she hadn’t gone so still. It was a strange mark of having been in this kind of situation for far too long, but he took notice when Granger stopped breathing.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes. The moon must be full. Silvery light snaked between the boards, enough to cast the room in shades of grey. Her eyes were shut, her body strangely still. And then that held breath released, long and slow.  A couple more breaths hitched ever so slightly.  Severus narrowed his eyes. His gaze swept down over the cocoon  of Granger’s sleeping bag. She was holding herself stiffly, laying on her back with her arms tight at her sides.</p>
<p>And in a moment she seemed to melt, air whispering from between her lips, her body going limp again.  He still wouldn’t have been quite sure if she didn’t then bring her hand up, slipping two fingers into her mouth. There was a scent on the air at once painfully familiar and strangely exotic; one he had not smelled for longer than he would care to acknowledge.</p>
<p>His body made its automatic response, heat tingling through him, blood rising to the surface. It would be the same for anyone; with anyone. It had nothing to do with Granger herself.</p>
<p>She was perfectly quiet again. Her mouth made no noise, doing whatever it was doing to those two fingers.</p>
<p>
  <em>Tongue sliding between them, tasting, sucking…</em>
</p>
<p>It was then that Hermione opened her eyes. She saw him seeing her. Both of them breathed. Breathed again. Her fingers slid from her mouth, saliva or <em>something</em> catching the dim light, before the hand vanished back into her sleeping bag. He wished he could read her expression, but he had spent the last two weeks trying his best to avoid her, apparently succeeding despite their close quarters.  Was that a smile? It was gone before he would be sure, and she turned her head away, shifting into sleep.</p>
<p>Severus lay awake a little longer. The reflex to over-analyse was an occupational hazard of being a decent spy. He was, of course, a spy no longer, but old habits die hard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After more than several minutes’ internal debate, Severus had determined that, yes she had; and, so what? They were both adults. God knows, these things had happened often enough in school dormitories. Why shouldn’t she? No one could blame her for releasing the tension.</p>
<p>Severus adjusted himself – his mind attempted to pick at why this brief moment of voyeurism had had quite such a strong effect on him, but he brushed it away – and closed his eyes. But it was a long time before sleep came.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>These were the ways in which they filled their days.</p>
<p>Severus had a small camp stove and a rationed supply of gas cannisters. He would brew what he could, mostly first aid potions, or those for severe trauma. They were the ones most likely to be used. One of his many personal ticks now was that he always carried Essence of Dittany – and pressed a vial on to anyone else if he could.  It had, after all, saved his life on this very spot.  Severus liked to set up his stove on his own blood stain. It made Granger wrinkle her nose, but it’s as well to remember one’s mortality, and one’s determination to survive.</p>
<p>She did something with Arithmancy.  He knew that he should know more than that, but their close quarters had always made him uncomfortable. He knew it was for a reason, but that didn’t make things different. He had been her teacher, she had saved his life. There was a debt owed, and Severus hated it.  She spent the days with her head in a book, her little beaded bag producing an apparently never-ending supply. She would trace numbers in notebooks, sometimes on the ground. It was thanks to the Arithmantic wards that their presence was largely guarded.  Only their contact in Hogwarts actually knew where they were.</p>
<p>Apart from that, they waited.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The following day passed no differently to any other. Severus applied a balm to his back in the morning, trying to ease away the discomfort of another night on the floor. Granger primly turned her back, allowing him the privacy to deal with being old unobserved.  He had offered her some of the balm one of the first mornings. Her smile hadn’t been exactly mocking as she refused, but he hadn’t offered again. <em>Fine. Let her suffer, then.</em></p>
<p>Severus brewed in his little cauldron. Hermione read and scribbled. No footsteps came from the tunnel.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until they unrolled the sleeping bags that Severus realised how preoccupied his mind had become with the brief intimacy of last night. He lay on his side facing her, as he always did. He closed his eyes. He matched her slow, steady breath. He pretended.</p>
<p>After a surprisingly short time, he heard her shift. Had it been this way every night? Had she barely waited for him to fall asleep before…</p>
<p>The light wasn’t as good as the previous night, but that just meant Severus could watch without her noticing. Not that she seemed wary of him, anyway. Her eyes remained closed, her breathing shallow and sleepy. But her arm shifted inside the sleeping bag, skimming against the nylon, and there was an unmistakable wriggle of her hips.</p>
<p>Severus himself had chosen to leave his hand inside his sleeping bag instead of pillowing it beneath his head. Fingertips brushed the hardness in his underwear, and he ground his teeth, consciously working to keep his breathing steady. How did she do it? He was certain of what she was doing, but her breathing remained utterly normal. He studied the sleeping bag for any sign of movement. Was that a movement, where her groin must be? A rhythmic shift? Or was he seeing what he wanted to see?</p>
<p>Studying her face was more interesting. The swift peak of her tongue swiping over her lips, leaving them parted. He had to listen closely, but surely that was her breath catching.</p>
<p>The sound of a wet slide caught his own breath. He curled his fingers along his own hardness again, making his cock jerk. It took willpower to keep still, to keep breathing, to keep watching her. A wet catch again. His mind cruelly filled in the gaps, filled his imagination with a hot, wet slit, twitching and needy, desperate for…</p>
<p>She held her breath again, and when his gaze returned to her face he could swear that her eyes were open, that she was looking right at him. A short, stuttered out breath as her body stiffened, an almost imperceptible movement at her groin. When she breathed in again it was a deep gasp for air and a whispered, hoarse out breath.</p>
<p>Severus couldn’t remember the last time his cock had been so hard.</p>
<p>He saw her blink. So she was watching him. Looking at him while she got herself off. As her body loosened she didn’t bring her fingers to her mouth this time, but he saw a gesture that might be wiping them. She blinked again, and Severus had the distinct feeling she was waiting for his move.</p>
<p>His options were limited. What he wanted to do was—</p>
<p>
  <em>Spread her legs and slide home, see if she can stay so calm and quiet when my cock’s inside her—</em>
</p>
<p>Take himself to another room and wank like his life depended on it. They only used this room. If he left, it would be obvious what he was going to do. Something within Severus, some last controlling piece of the bastard he had always been, wouldn’t let him do that; wouldn’t let her know just how aroused he was by the merest hint of a masturbating woman.</p>
<p>He rolled away from her. She might be happy to wank out in the open where anyone could watch her, but if Severus were to be degraded into tugging himself off over an ex-student he was damn well going to have some privacy. He also waited until her breathing evened, though she’d proved to be a master at faking sleep. He contented himself with illicit strokes along his shaft while he waited, meaning that when he finally took himself in hand it took only a few tugs before his own breath stopped, and he bit down hard on his lip to keep quiet. Surely it hadn’t been that long since he’d last taken himself in hand, but he came hard enough that colours bloomed behind his closed eyelids.</p>
<p>Left with an unpleasant mess and no way to covertly clean it up, Severus settled down for a sticky, uncomfortable night’s sleep.</p>
