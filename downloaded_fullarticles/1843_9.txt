    <p>ONE:</p>
<p>“Hurry up or you’re going to miss the train, you stupid bitch”</p>
<p>The first thing I heard this morning. Pleasant right? No. But this is my life, and by now, I’m used to it. The snide comments and demeaning insults.</p>
<p>Welcome, stay at your own risk.</p>
<p>I’m a Hogwarts student, you see. If I miss the train, there’s a chance I don’t go this year, and well, I need to go. I can’t stay here. I mean, physically, sure. But mentally, I can’t stay within a mile of this place. I’d go nuts. My parents are muggles, they don’t understand how I ended up like the ‘freak’ that I am. They say it was a birth defect, that it was because I’m a mistake. I never knew why they hated me so much until I received my first letter. My Hogwarts acceptance letter.</p>
<p>We weren’t the richest of families to start with. My parents are drunks. Every penny we had went into their addictions. I worked every summer to get money for my textbooks, but it was never enough.</p>
<p>I have a friend at Hogwarts. I never had any until I went there. Her name is Hermione. We met during first year and bonded almost instantly over our love of the taste of chocolate. She is one of the closest people I know, and I’m glad to have her. But even with her, every day is a struggle for me. Especially in the summer. You see, my grades slipped last year. A lot. And this made my parents a considerable amount angrier at me. They hit me a couple of times. A couple of times a day that is. </p>
<p>That’s why I’m so desperate to escape, because I don’t think I can survive here.</p>
<p>I dragged my feet out of bed, padding my way along the floors, to the bathroom, where I took a quick shower, before dressing myself in a hoodie and some baggy leggings, and grabbing my things. I put my hair up in a simple ponytail and dragged my bags downstairs. My father was waiting at the bottom. He looked me up and down, before sneering and snatching my bags from my hands.  The only one left, was my owl. Aerin. I watched as he carelessly threw my things into the car, before yelling at me to get in.</p>
<p>The car journey was silent, the sound of my father’s heavy breathing the only thing I could hear. I could hear the restraints in his lungs, from smoking. They were going to give up soon enough. He recklessly pulled into a space in the parking lot and turned to me with a sinister smile.</p>
<p>“Sweetie, I’m sure you can get your own fat ass onto the train, Now get out.”</p>
<p>Although I was used to it, the tone of voice that he used made hairs stand up on the back of my neck, and tears sting the back of my eyes. I climbed out struggling to carry all my things and made my way into the station. I grabbed a trolley, to put everything in, and made my way to the platform. The wall between 9 and 10. The platform 9 3/4. I took a deep breath and began to run towards it. I never truly got used to the feeling of going through that wall. It still makes me feel nauseous. I passed through it and gave my luggage to the people by the train, before getting on. I still had a small bag with me. It had my uniform in it.</p>
<p>“Alessia! Come over here!” I heard a familiar voice call. I spun around on my hell, becoming instantly lightheaded, and ended up face to face with Hermione. “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m fine. Just dizzy. Probably spun around too fast.” I chuckled light-heartedly, though I knew it wasn’t the case. I hadn’t eaten in about three days, and it was beginning to catch up to me.</p>
<p>“Let’s go find Harry and Ron, they’re probably on the train already.”</p>
<p>I’d been friends with Hermione for a while, but Harry and Ron weren’t really my friends. More like people who sat with me because their friend did. They’re friendly, sure, but not my friends. We wouldn’t go into Hogsmeade together, giggling like schoolgirls, or sharing a liquorice twirl between us. </p>
<p>Soon, we boarded the train, and I began to zone out. I wasn’t listening to the conversations going on around me. I was trying to silence the voices in my head. The ones screaming constantly.</p>
<p>“-Alessia?” I heard Hermione say, but I missed the first part of the question.</p>
<p>“Huh, sorry, I was kinda out of it”</p>
<p>“I asked if you wanted anything from the trolley?”</p>
<p>“Oh, um, I’m okay, but thanks.”</p>
<p>She nodded at me, giving me a ‘We’ll talk later’ kind of look. It worries me, because I can’t tell her about my parents. I’ve always had excuses for things, but I could tell she was getting worried now. Excuses weren’t going to cut it. I felt tears well up in my eyes, and made an excuse to leave, stating that I was going to change into my robes, before exiting the carriage. My breathing became laboured, and was coming out in short puffs, and I had to bite my lip to prevent a sob from escaping. I changed into my robes, and pulled a face wipe out of my bag, to stop it from looking like I had been crying, before returning to the others. </p>
<p>Only, when I returned, Harry was lying across the seat. Someone was giving him chocolate. They told the others they had to go talk to the driver and made his way out.</p>
<p>“Who was that?” I asked Hermione, and her eyes bored into mine.</p>
<p>“Professor Lupin- “She hastily responded, before her eyebrows furrowed, and she sped up her words as she finished “Have you been crying?”</p>
<p>“I wiped my face with a wipe, had dirt on it, from - uhm- gardening with my mum.”</p>
<p>“Oh okay. “She responded uneasily, and I could tell she didn’t believe me.</p>
<p>Luckily, we reached Hogwarts before she could question me any further. I was gladder than I think I’ve ever been to arrive here, and that’s saying something. I pretty much ran off the train, the fresh air filling my lungs almost instantly. I felt fatigue take over my body, and rushed towards the carriages, that take us from the station to the castle. </p>
<p>We went into the great hall for a short assembly, and I was joined by Hermione, Ron and Harry. Dumbledore introduced the first years to the castle and greeted Professor Lupin as Defence against the dark arts teacher. The entire time I could feel my eyes becoming heavy, and knew that if I didn’t sleep soon, I’d collapse</p>
<p>We then went back to our dormitories and common rooms for the rest of the day. I went straight to my bed and fell asleep almost instantly.</p>
