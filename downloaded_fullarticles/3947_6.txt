  <strong>Prologue</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Draco turned away from the notice board to grin at Greg, who looked back with an equally excited, if slightly more dazed, smile. Dueling club. Draco’s father had already taught him a few possibly (probably) less than legal curses in preparation for learning how to duel but had always held back from letting him practice even a single curse, much less have a go at dueling with anyone himself. He glanced back at the parchment pinned up on the notice board.</p>
<p>  “It’s on tonight after lessons, we’ll have to tell Vince, he never thinks to check the notices himself.”</p>
<p>  Greg nodded slowly “Who do you think will teach it?”</p>
<p>  Draco looked at him in surprise, impressed that Greg had thought of such a question himself.</p>
<p>  “I’m not sure” he responded, thinking. His eager grin slowly transformed into a scowl. “It better not be bloody Lockhart.”</p>
<p>  Gagging noise sounded from behind Draco and he turned to see Nott grimacing as if he was throwing up on the floor and smirked in agreement at his reaction to thoughts of the vile defense teacher.</p>
<p>  “Theo! Are you okay? Shall I take you to the infirmary?” Greg piped up, worry colouring his voice and raising the pitch, although it was still deep for a second year.</p>
<p>  Draco rolled his eyes as Nott started chuckling.</p>
<p>  “No, Greg he’s fine, just demonstrating what will happen to us all if Lockhart teaches the dueling club tonight.”</p>
<p>  Greg flushed and Draco studied him with concern. Everyone knew Greg was thick, almost as thick as Vincent, but he wasn’t so thick that he didn’t recognize his stupidity and get embarrassed by it. And that, thought Draco, that mile-wide disparity was the foundation for his and Greg’s entire friendship. Sure, the boy was loyal and constant and even gentle but those traits were somewhat too Hufflepuff for Draco’s liking. What Slytherins really admired was power and it was this, the tentative power that Greg found in recognizing his own weakness and rising above the petty mocking that Draco found some kind of delicate respect in and motivation to preserve. Pity was a luxury afforded only to the strong, and stupidity (in a sense vastly different to ignorance) could make a person truly vulnerable.</p>
<p>  “Oh, I’m er sorry. I’ll go tell Vincent about it then… see ya later, Draco.” Greg retreated from the common room, his face bright red while Nott was still laughing. Draco shot him a rueful glare.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Later that night, the hall was packed with what seemed like almost the whole school, the air tense as everyone waited for whichever teacher would be leading this mysterious dueling club. Draco glanced around the room as he waited beside Greg and Vincent as Blaise had expressed no interest in furthering his dueling capabilities. He scowled when he spotted Potter walking in with his faithful sidekicks.</p>
<p>  Millicent sidled up next to them, sneering at Hufflepuff first years that she shoved out of the way with her large frame. Draco rolled his eyes, she really was an annoyance.</p>
<p>  “Hey Draco, still hanging out with the school dunces I see.” He could usually put up with her and the rest of his house-mate’s jeering of his closest friends, ones that had not the comprehension or wit to defend themselves, but he was tired of the blank expression on Vincent’s face when he looked over at Draco, waiting for his reply. He gritted his teeth as he turned to face her.</p>
<p>  “Hey Millicent, still acting as the school bitch I see.” He snapped. Her eyes widened fractionally but she just chuckled, casually shoving his shoulder with the force of a small mammoth so that he had to struggle not to stumble backwards.</p>
<p>  “Lighten up Dray, they know I’m only kidding.” Draco refrained from angrily voicing that <em>they </em>were right here and were perfectly capable of carrying out a conversation themselves but just turned back to the stage, craning his neck to see if any teachers had arrived yet.</p>
<p>  He groaned loudly when he saw Lockhart walk up on to the stage but smirked when Snape followed him up and heard Millicent release a similar sigh of relief. He was close enough to see the rage lurking behind Snape’s cool demeanor when Lockhart introduced him as his ‘assistant’ and cheered with the rest of his house when he blasted Lockhart off his feet in the demonstration. After that the two teachers came around pairing students up to practice and Draco practically trembled with excitement until he realized that it probably wouldn’t be much of a challenge if he was up against Greg or Vincent. He saw Snape breaking Potter and his cronies up and leered at them briefly until Snape called him over to go and pair up with Potter.</p>
<p>  “You guys can go together.” He said distractedly to Vincent and Greg before walking over to Potter, smirking when he saw Millicent do the same as she went to meet Granger.</p>
<p>  He stood to face Potter as Lockhart began the countdown for them all to begin dueling and drew out his wand, amused to see that his presence had wiped the smile from Potter’s face.</p>
<p>  “3….2…”</p>
<p>  Draco slashed his wand down with an <em>Expelliarmus</em>, but it was weak and did little except knock Potter backwards a few paces as Lockhart finally reached “1.”</p>
<p>  Potter’s eyes darkened and Draco felt his blood cool.</p>
<p>  “<em>Rictumsempra</em>!” Potter yelled, making Draco double over as invisible fingers tickled him unceasingly.</p>
<p>  “Disarming spells only!” Lockhart called out but Draco ignored him, aiming his wand at Potter and forcing out a “<em>Tarantallegra</em>” between hysterical giggles.</p>
<p>  Potter’s legs starting jerking violently beneath him and Draco would have chuckled if he hadn’t already been out of breath and wheezing from uncontrollable laughter. Potter raised his wand again but Snape was already sweeping over and cast a “<em>Finite Incantatem</em>” to stop their respective charms.</p>
<p>  Draco glanced around the room when he felt the invisible fingers retract themselves and was finally able to stand. It looked like his and Potter’s fray wasn’t the only one to get out of hand. Draco smirked to see Millicent holding Granger in a painful looking headlock but Potter quickly leapt up to free his friend.</p>
<p>  “I think I’d better teach you to block unfriendly spells” Lockhart said nervously “Let’s have a demonstration- Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how about you?”</p>
<p>  Snape swept over to him “A bad idea, Professor Lockhart” he smirked “Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest of spells. How about Malfoy and Potter?”</p>
<p>  Draco’s gaze snapped over to Potter, slightly worried, but he made his way into the center of the hall, the crowd shrinking back, presumably afraid of catching any misaimed charms. But Draco knew that neither of them would miss.</p>
<p>  Lockhart moved towards Potter, speaking to him in confident tones and probably failing to teach him how to block Draco’s spells as Snape bent closer to Draco’s ear.</p>
<p>  “Why don’t you hit him with a <em>Serpensortia</em>?” Draco smirked back at him in return. He’d never actually cast one before, but he was certain that he could and that it would shake Potter up adequately, too.</p>
<p>  Potter surveyed Snape and Draco’s matching smirks nervously and asked Lockhart to demonstrate the blocking spell again.</p>
<p>  “Scared?” Draco murmured under his breath, only just loud enough for Potter to hear.</p>
<p>  Potter’s eyes flashed. “You wish.” He muttered back.</p>
<p>  They stood across from each other and only now, as Lockhart began the countdown once again did Draco see the anger and pure hatred that shone from Potter’s clear-eyed gaze. It sent a small shiver down his spine, the expression new on this gentle face but glaringly familiar in the disdain painted clearly upon it. He raised his wand anyway, pushing the crawling fear that look had instilled in him to the back of his consciousness.</p>
<p>  “…1!” Lockhart cried and Draco raised his wand, quicker than startled dust and bellowed “<em>Serpensortia!</em>”, and a black snake exploded from the end of his wand, freezing Potter in place. Satisfaction welled in Draco’s belly.</p>
<p>  But then Lockhart shot something at the snake and it flew towards the crowd, hissing at a frightened Hufflepuff, coiling its body, preparing to strike and Draco wasn’t pleased anymore, he was feeling sick at the memory of stories that his spell had conjured in his mind.</p>
<p>  Potter approaching the snake made it worse, called to mind the dark figure of his imagination with high-pitched laughter and decay sewn into his very voice. And then he spoke. Potter slurred something to the snake sounding very much like a hiss and the snake fell back to the floor. Draco slowly backed away, his senses numb and his limbs sluggish with fear and distress as the Hufflepuff ran out of the room. Potter stepped back as if physically pushed by the shocked faces now baring down on him. Draco was relieved when Snape strode in front of him to eye Potter himself, effectively blocking the other boy from his sight.</p>
<p>  Harry was a Parselmouth. Just like- just like- Draco couldn’t bring himself to even think the name, but icy tendrils of fear he had never experienced before were already crawling around his spine, coiling in his stomach, pumping through his veins. What had just happened? He wasn’t sure- it felt like a divination, it felt like a recurrence, it felt like nothing would be the same again. He took a deep and shuddery breath; his father had taught him well- words once spoken and long forgotten thrumming through his ears. <em>Hell is empty </em>he thought. But he’d always known that.</p>
