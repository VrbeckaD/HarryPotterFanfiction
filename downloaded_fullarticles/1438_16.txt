  <span>May 1978</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus Snape couldn’t help but feel nervous as he waited outside of the Great Hall. All of the seventh years were waiting to be let in, for it was their turn to take the Soul Finder Potion. It would determine if he had and who his soul mate was and he just knew deep in his gut that it would be Lily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Beautiful, kind Lily. He just knew that once it was proven that she was his soul mate she would finally accept his apology for what had happened after the O.W.L.s in fifth year and he would finally be able to prove his love to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus couldn’t help but think what he could have done differently that warm June afternoon two years ago. Maybe he should have just let James and the fucking Muraders continue to torment him and if he refused to take their bating, maybe they would've gotten bored and left him alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was far too late to change what had happened then, he would just have to use this opportunity to get his fondest wish and the woman he loved with all his heart and soul. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus couldn’t help but look over to where Lily and the Marauders were standing and he felt and pang in his chest as he saw James gather her into his arms and kiss her temple. It should be him with her, not the pompous git James Potter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He seethed as they laughed at a joke that Sirius was telling and he felt his back stiffen when he saw them looking toward him. Severus could only assume that the joke was at his expense. It was confirmed when Sirius ran a finger down his cheek to simulate a tear and he sniffed exaggeratingly, before mouthing ‘Snivellus’ with a snicker.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus felt his pale face flush when Lily looked up at him, sniffed and turned away burrowing into the arms of James. Peter was laughing with Sirius and Remus looked at him with a sympathetic look to his eye. But Severus didn’t want or need the werewolf’s pity. He clenched his fists and seethed silently. He knew they would all be eating crow when it was proven that Lily was his soul mate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just then the doors to the Great Hall opened and the Headmaster Albus Dumbledore came out with the heads of houses standing on either side of him. His blue eyes were twinkling as he surveyed the amassed students before him. He began to speak, “Before we go into the Great Hall to find out who your soulmate is, there is a bit of information that you need. Once you take the potion you’ll fall into a bit of a trance and you’ll be able to see the aura of your soul mate if they’re present. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If they’re not in the Great Hall it means one of several things. They’re either not yet of age and you’ll have to wait until they are, they’ve already left school, in which case you’ll be urged to seek them out and they, you or in some very rare cases, they might not even be born yet. But never fear once this potion is in your system it’ll remain there and dormant until you find your mate.” he paused and looked out over the eager faces of the students before him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His eyes seemed to twinkle even more as he thought how he loved this time of year as he gets to play matchmaker, even if it was vicariously. Sure it was the potion that did all the work, but he could still feel a sense of satisfaction when his predictions of who would be matched came true. There was always a betting pool as to who would be matched that year in the staff room. The stakes ranged from nightly patrols to detentions, he was happy to say that he’d won for ten years running now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In the very rare case that the potion indicates that you don’t have a soul mate, don’t despair. Love can still be found, you just have to keep looking. How you’ll be able to tell if your soulmate is out in the world or not yet born is simple, a band of color will form on your left ring finger. If it is blue, they have already left school and you’ll find them in good time. If they aren’t yet born the circle will be green and will change to purple once they’re born. In the event that you don’t have a soul mate, no circle of color will form at all. Now, I need you all to line up before your head of house and we’ll commence with administering the potion.” Dumbledore finished and clapped his hands to indicate that the students line up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus shuffled over to stand at the end of the line before his head of house Horace Slughorn. The rotund wizard smiled benignly at the students in his house. There were several that were in his ‘Slug Club’ and he was hoping that his predictions of who’ll be matched would prove correct. His eyes then fell on Severus and he had to quickly suppress a grimace, even though he knew that the soul finder potion didn’t take into account that person’s appearance, Slughorn felt that it should account for something and felt sympathy for whichever witch or in some cases wizard ended up with the skinny pale-faced young man.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once all the students were lined up, they all proceeded into the Great Hall and the doors closed behind them. In front of the high table was a long bench and a large bubbling cauldron, steam was falling over the sides and onto the floor where it lingered like fog. Beside the cauldron was a line of beakers waiting to be filled with the potion, they were lined up just as the students were.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now, before we begin, are there any questions?” Dumbledore asked the students. No one raised their hands. “Right, now each of your heads of house will be administering your potions, once you take it you’ll go sit over at your house table. Once everyone has taken their potion the incantation will be spoken to activate it and we’ll know who is matched. Good luck, everyone! And remember, love always finds a way.” Dumbledore then turned on his heel and sat in his seat at the high table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The heads of house then went to stand behind the table with the cauldron and began to fill the first beakers. Then one student from each line went up the dais and took their potion. Most were rather surprised at the pleasant taste of the potion as most were absolutely horrible and were whispering to each other what it tasted like to each other as it was different for everyone. This procedure continued until all the students and taken the potion and was sitting at their house tables.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbeldore then stood up and taking out his wand murmured an incantation, “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Quaerite et invenietis animabus et alia media,” </span>
  </em>
  <span> and a glow began to rise from the seated students.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus felt his head go a little foggy and he looked at his left ring finger waiting for the circle of color to begin to form. His heart began to pound as he saw a shadow begin to form, become richer in color as the minutes passed. “Please be blue, please be blue,” he murmured. But his stomach dropped as the circle shown as a bright green. His eyes stung, Lily wasn’t his soul mate. He had hoped that she would be, in fact, his soulmate wasn’t even born yet. His head then snapped up when he heard a loud whoop across the room and saw Lily, his beautiful Lily being snogged silly by that arrogant prat James Potter and everyone else laughing and clapping and kissing their soul mates.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were a few people with tears and glum expressions, he was among them. Hell, even the fat lump of Peter Pettigrew had a ring of blue on his finger, though it was really faint.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just then, Severus felt someone grab his hand and looked up to see Sirius Black looking at the ring on his finger and a mocking smile curled his lips. He leaned in close to Severus and murmured, “Always knew you would be likely to rob the cradle, no witch alive and in their right mind would take you as their mate. I wonder how long you’ll have to wait for her to be born? If she’s lucky maybe she’ll die in infancy and you’ll be waiting forever.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus snatched his hand out of Sirius’ and stood up from his seat. He looked down at Sirius’ hand and noticed he didn’t have a ring around his finger. Severus smirked, “I may be robbing the cradle as you put in, Black. But at least I know I’ll have a soul mate out there somewhere, unlike you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius scoffed, “No witch will ever tie Sirius Black down. I’m glad that I don’t have a soul mate. More witches for me to love.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Severus could tell by looking in Black’s eyes that his words affected him. He just didn’t want to show it, for everyone wants to find their soulmate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, well once you give them fleas, you’ll be hard-pressed to find anyone that will give you the time of day. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have better things to do than to continue this pointless verbal sparring session. Have fun with your multitude of women Black.” with that, Severus turned and walked out of the Great Hall and back to his dorm room. He didn’t bother to look back and see if Sirius had a rebuttal to his cutting remarks. If he had, he would have seen the gobsmacked look on Sirius’ face at him standing up for himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once within the safety of his bed, with the curtains drawn and silencing spell thrown up for good measure, Severus was able to finally let the tears come, mourning the loss of the one he thought was his other half. He vowed that even though he had a soul mate out there somewhere he would always love Lily. Whoever his soul mate was she would have to work hard to make his heart thaw. </span>
