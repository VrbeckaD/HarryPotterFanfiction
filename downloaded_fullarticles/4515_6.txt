    <p>When Nico first traveled to Rome, Italy, he didn’t suspect he would shadow travel right into someone.</p><p>And yet, here he was, on the ground after ramming into a brown haired, green eyed man.</p><p>“What the hell! Watch where you’re going!” The man yelled in Italian.</p><p>“Sorry, sorry.” Nico replied, also in Italian and considered the man’s eyes for the first time. And a sense of Déjà vu washed over him because <em>he recognised those eyes</em>.</p><p>So, Nico stood up, held out his hand and said “Hello. My name is Nico di Angelo. I’m sorry, but have we met before?”</p>
