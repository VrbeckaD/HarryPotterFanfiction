  <b>Thursday, September 1st, 1977</b>
</p><p>The sun rose lazily over the rooftops of Cokeworth, the warm light of the late summer dawn transforming the city from a dark drab grey into a slightly less dark, but frankly no less drab grey. This was normal.</p><p>The streets were more or less deserted save for the street cleaners that were taking advantage of the early hour to keep the city neat and orderly. This was also normal.</p><p>And in the bedroom on the second floor of 55 Ash Street, Lily Evans decided that it was time to cut her losses and wake up properly; now that the sun was up, her best efforts to fall back asleep seemed more futile than they had for the previous several hours. This was decidedly not normal.</p><p>Lily Evans was not someone that could be described as a “morning person,” unless that moniker was prefaced by “definitely not a.” She’d even made Alice cry once, when she’d dared to take Lily too early from her sleep. Today, however, found her awake at 6:05, an hour that she usually declared “too early for any decent human being to be conscious.” The reason that she was up so early was simple; today marked the date of her final return to Hogwarts and in light of such an occasion, Lily Evans could not sleep.</p><p>It felt a little like standing at the edge of the very high diving board at the pool that she’d played at years ago, as a primary schooler. Staring into the water below, she had been seized with the realization that some future version of her would have to jump, that she couldn’t turn back now that she’d climbed all the way up the ladder. It felt a little like that, only instead of having a high dive in her future, she had job applications, and Head Girl responsibilities and, most terrifying of all, the prospect of leaving Hogwarts for the last time.</p><p>Every dive begins with a step, and so, burdened with the inevitability of seventh year, Lily finally prepared for the day. Her eventual descent into the kitchen was met with far more cheer than she thought appropriate for the hour. “There’s my lovely daughter,” her father said from behind his newspaper, “Coffee’s on.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Lily said, gratefully.</p><p>David Evans did a double take. “Lily? I thought you were Petunia. Has something happened? Is there a fire? Are we all about to die?”</p><p>“He’ll be here all week, everyone,” she deadpanned to a non-existent audience.</p><p>“You are up early though,” David noted, folding up his paper and fixing her with a Dad look. “What’s up?”</p><p>Lily slumped into her chair. “I just can’t believe that this is all happening right now.”</p><p>“Yes, the stock market’s pretty upsetting to all of us these days.”</p><p>Lily groaned. It was too early in the morning for this. “It’s my last year at Hogwarts and it’ll be strange going back and not staying with my friends. I’m not sure what to expect. But the stock market is upsetting too, I suppose.”</p><p>“Oh right. The Head apartments.” David frowned. “I’m not sure how I feel about your living with an unknown boy, Lily. Can I write Professor Dumbledore, do you think, and lodge a complaint? Or at least ask him to make sure that the Head Boy is highly unattractive?”</p><p>“You’re really not that funny, Dad. And besides, I think I know who it’s going to be, and we’re just friends. Promise.”</p><p>David looked sceptical. “I’ve heard that before. Who do you think it is? Severus?”</p><p>Lily shook her head. “I doubt it. And besides, we’re not friends anymore. We had a big fight last year and it made me realize how awful he’d become.”</p><p>“Well, I’m sorry that that happened, but he was always a bit of a weird kid, wasn’t he?”</p><p>“Dad!”</p><p>David shrugged. “He was never very nice to Petunia, even back when the two of you got along. Your mother and I put up with him because we thought you needed a friend that understood better than we did the kinds of things you could do, but I can’t say that we were happy it was him.”</p><p>Lily was taken aback. “I didn’t know you felt that way about Sev.”</p><p>“You never asked,” David said cheerfully. “So who’s your preferred candidate, then?”</p><p>“It’s probably Remus,” Lily said, thankful for the change of subject. Her dad teased her, but he always knew when and how to draw back. “He was prefect, he’s dead smart. If it weren’t for his idiot friends, there’d be no question.”</p><p>“Why would his friends impact his chances?”</p><p>“He’s one of the Marauders,” she explained, “I’ve written about them, I must have. There was the Noodle Incident from a few years back?”</p><p>“Oh, right. They sound like a good time. And one of them keeps asking you out - James, was it? Your mother and I enjoyed those letters; you should invite him for dinner some time.”</p><p>Her parents must have cracked - perhaps the stress of raising two daughters had been too much, or maybe it was the surprise of finding out that one of them was a witch that had caused their judgment to decay so precipitously. Honestly. They liked Potter, but had never liked Sev? “What?”</p><p>“All the boys that Petunia brings home are so boring and stuffy, and it looks like this latest one is going to stick around. I was really hoping that you would bring home a boy that I could have fun bullying a little. Grilling him on his ‘intentions with my daughter’ and insinuating that I own a shotgun and all that.” David sighed dramatically. “You’re really denying me one of the promised joys of fatherhood.”</p><p>“I am not bringing Potter home,” Lily said hotly, “Especially not as a boyfriend. He’s an immature prat who takes pleasure in humiliating me in front of everyone.”</p><p>David’s brow furrowed. “I didn’t know you were being bullied at school. Should I actually write to Professor Dumbledore?”</p><p>Her dad’s sudden sobriety cooled Lily off, letting her choose her next words a little more carefully. “It’s not that bad, I guess. He just keeps asking me out and making an enormous spectacle out of it. It’s embarrassing to be put on the spot like that and he won’t take no for an answer. I’m not being bullied.”</p><p>“You don’t like him back?”</p><p>“He doesn’t really like me, he just likes the attention and making a big show out of things.”</p><p>David nodded knowingly. “I see. Coffee’s ready, by the way.”</p><p>As they sipped their coffee (black for Lily, three sugar cubes plus milk for David) conversation shifted to tamer topics: what courses she was taking, plans for the winter hols, whether or not Vernon actually needed tusks to be legally considered a walrus. And before she knew it, the morning had passed and she was at Platform 9 ¾, flanked by her parents. Petunia hadn't come out to wish her good luck. Lily wasn't surprised; after all, her sister hadn't joined her on the station once, but it still hurt to know that she’d become so far from the girl that she'd grown up laughing and playing with.  </p><p>“Bye mummy. Bye dad.” She gave her parents a smile, trying to reassure them that yes, their baby was going to be okay, that yes, she would be safe. She was going to school, not to war.</p><p>Still, leave it to parents to worry.</p><p>“Be safe, darling” choked out Elizabeth Evans. She was tearing up, finally letting the tears that had been threatening to fall for the last twenty minutes slip down her cheeks. “Write us as often as you can.”</p><p>Her dad, of course, had to throw the morning’s conversation into her face. He pulled his daughter in closer for a final hug and whispered into her ear. “Tell James that your mother and I are very excited to meet him.” He pulled away from her with a laugh, fending off the indignant swat that Lily aimed in his direction. “Only kidding dear. Just... Be careful.” His eyes were twinkling with mirth. “I know how boys are around the girls they fancy.”</p><p>Blushing furiously, Lily turned to stomp off into the waiting train. She made it in safely, dropping off her trunk and turning to head into the carriage, only to-</p><p>Oof.</p><p>She had turned straight into the chest of Remus Lupin. She brightened. Finally, someone tolerable. “Remus!”</p><p>“Lily” he returned, with a smile. “How's my favorite redhead?”</p><p>She looked around. “I dunno... Didn't Molly Prewett graduate last year?”</p><p>She laughed, dodging the kick he aimed at her shins. “I'm doing great, Remus.” She grinned. She'd kept her badge a secret during the summer; she'd wanted to tell him in person. She rummaged around in her purse, before pulling it out triumphantly. “Look! I made Head Girl!”</p><p>Remus didn't even register shock or surprise. His eyes crinkled into a familiar smile, pulling one of his unexplained scars tight across his cheek. “I thought you might have gotten that, Lily.”</p><p>Her smile widened. “So? Let's see yours then. This'll be brill, Remus.”</p><p>Remus’ smile only grew. It was threatening to overtake his entire face. “Oh, no, it's not me” Remus said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Really? But I thought- I didn't mean-”</p><p>He cut her off. “Don't worry about it. Really. I'm not upset about it at all. It just looks like Dumbledore has a sense of humor.”</p><p>Lily was about to open her mouth to protest, to ask what he meant, to ask who the Head Boy was, when her answer came in the form of a bespectacled, laughing, black-haired boy who bounded into the corridor.</p><p>“Evans! Fancy meeting you here.”</p><p>Potter. She sighed, and turned to face him, doing her best to put a polite smile. “Hello, Potter,” she said.</p><p>The boy tsked. “And here I thought you’d greet your co-Head with a little more enthusiasm, Evans.”</p><p>“Oh very funny,” Lily replied. “I assume you overheard Remus and I?”</p><p>James didn't say a word, he simply reached into the pocket of his robe and pulled out a shiny badge in scarlet and gold with the letters HB embossed on it.</p><p>Lily's eyes widened. Emotions flitted through her mind until she settled on betrayal. Yes, she decided. Betrayal seemed about right. She felt betrayed, like the position that she'd worked for had become cheapened by her partner, that the fact that Potter, of all people, could be Head Boy diminished her own accomplishments. “Y- you-”</p><p>He grinned. “Yeah, Remus had a point. Dumbledore does have a sense of humor.” He glanced at his watch. “We should probably get going, we have a meeting with the prefects in... two minutes. Best to make a good first impression.”</p><p>After saying goodbye to Remus who left in search of Sirius and Peter, the two made their way to the head of the train, opening the door to the first carriage where they found that, despite nominally being on time, they were the last to arrive. Twenty-two prefects all but filled the carriage, chatting with their housemates about their summer or Quidditch or what have you, but turned when Lily and James walked in.</p><p>“Erm,” said Priyanka, one of the Hufflepuff prefects, “What is he doing here? Not that I mind, I’m just-” she cut herself off, cheeks flushed.</p><p>“This is a prefect meeting, Evans, can’t bring your boyfriend just because you’re Head Girl,” one of the Slytherins - Horatio? Octavio? - sneered.</p><p>“He’s not my-” Lily began.</p><p>“We’re not-” James said.</p><p>“I wouldn’t-”</p><p>“I’ll have you know-”</p><p>“Wait, James, are you Head Boy?” Marlene McKinnon, the Gryffindor sixth-year prefect asked, cutting the pair off.</p><p>James mouth clicked shut and he nodded, holding up his badge.</p><p>The carriage erupted into noise.</p>
<hr/><p> Once the furor over Potter’s appointment subsided, the meeting went quickly and smoothly. The prefects seemed more or less competent, and besides seeing Mulciber and Bellatrix Black there (it had somehow slipped her mind that Slytherins would have prefects too) there had been no real surprises. Potter had, for once, remained quiet, seemingly content to scowl back at the Slytherins and let Lily run the meeting. She'd given each house's prefects their passwords, assigned a rotation for castle patrol, and bade them all find their friends. The meeting had been pleasant enough that she found herself smiling as she watched the last of the prefects say goodbye and leave, even as she realized that she was now sitting in a Hogwarts Express carriage alone save for James Potter.</p><p>“I think that went well,” the boy volunteered as the door clicked shut.</p><p>“'Course you do,” she said with a laugh. “You didn't do anything.”</p><p>He grinned at her. “Sure I did. Kept Mulciber in line, didn't I? The great prat was too busy staring at me and muttering obscenities under his breath to try anything.”</p><p>She frowned. The two Slytherin prefects were notoriously blood-obsessed; she'd had altercations with both of them in the past over her own Muggle heritage. The idea of working with them, the idea that they had power unnerved her.</p><p>Either James was more perceptive than he seemed or she was less subtle than she thought she was, because he turned to her and put a reassuring hand on her shoulder. “Don't worry about it. They won't try anything stupid just because they're prefects. If anything, it's easier now for us to keep an eye on them.”</p><p>On any other day, she would have jerked her body away from his hand, pulling her shoulder out of his grasp, but for some reason, today she really didn't mind. It was comforting, and besides, this was the longest they'd spent in each other's presence without a fight or a proposal, really. It was almost nice – this was a side of Potter that she hadn't seen before, one that almost seemed to be a person instead of a hormonal troublemaker. Pleasant, mature, something of a laugh.</p><p>“Thanks Potter,” she said, more sincerely than she’d meant to. Suddenly a little flustered, she decided she had to leave. “Well, I’ll see you around, I’m going to go find my friends bef-”</p><p>She had only just stood up and turned to leave the carriage when her efforts to escape were abruptly cut off by a firm squeeze on her rear. With a yelp, she turned and pushed James to the floor before stepping backwards, hands outstretched in defense.</p><p>Eyes wide, James began to sputter, “Wait, Evans, that wasn’t what it looked like, I-”</p><p>“Oh save it,” Lily said disdainfully, “I knew you were the same idiot as before.” And with that, she stormed out of the carriage, too irritated with the boy who was still in a heap on the floor, to apologize when she bumped into Peter Pettigrew and the rest of the Marauders.</p><p>The trio of boys shared an exasperated Look. It was Remus who finally pushed the door to the carriage open and poked his head inside. “Really, James? You were setting a record there, thirty-six minutes. Couldn’t have held out for the round forty?”</p><p>Sirius pushed the blonde boy inside before stepping in himself and closing the door behind Peter. “What did you do this time, mate? Couldn’t hold back from reciting that-” he shuddered dramatically, “-poem that you wrote her last spring?”</p><p>“It wasn’t my fault,” James said, his voice sour, “I think Mulciber jinxed my shoelaces together during the meeting; as soon as I tried to get up, I fell right into her. And I’ll thank you to not make fun of my creative endeavours.”</p><p>Sirius’ face darkened. “We did see him coming down the corridor, didn’t we? Smug face that he had on, I should have known he’d done something. What do you think boys, fancy seeing if Mulciber’s as handy with the Giant Squid’s tentacles as he is Prongs’ shoelaces?”</p><p>James shook his head. “Just leave it. It’s not worth it.”</p><p>The shocked silence in the carriage was nearly palpable.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Remus asked eventually, “It is against the rules to attack another student, and this certainly counts.”</p><p>James snorted. “As if we haven’t done far worse to him before. I mean it, it’s not worth it.”</p><p>Sirius shook his head. “Cor, but this new you is boring.”</p><p>“Yes,” James said sadly, inclining his head, “Maturity is a heavy cross to bear.”</p><p>“Yeah, and you’re the only one bloody getting anything out if it,” Sirius grumbled, but he and the rest of the Marauders joined James in a moment of contemplative silence without further complaint.</p><p>“What I still don’t understand,” Sirius said eventually, “Is why she got so angry because you tripped. Does clumsiness bother her that much? Because if so, I feel like she’d have offed Peter years ago.”</p><p>“I, uh, may have tried to stop myself from falling by grabbing onto her,” James admitted.</p><p>“What, you mean you pulled her hair? I could see how that’d make her mad,” Peter said.</p><p>“Er, no,” James said weakly, “I-” He trailed off, making vague grabbing motions towards James’ behind.</p><p>Sirius, James, and Remus began to laugh, partially at how forlorn James looked as he mimed groping James, but mostly at the absurdity of James’ situation.</p><p>“This is the worst,” James complained, “She thinks I’m some perverted creep, and you lot think that’s funny? I’m the victim here.”</p><p>“Maturity’s working wonders,” Remus gasped out, “thirty-six minutes and you’ve already made second base!”</p><p>And with that, three Marauders collapsed into helpless laughter as James, terribly unamused, wondered what he’d done wrong in a past life to have such awful, awful friends.</p>
<hr/><p>Meanwhile, Lily was seeking solace in her friends' compartment. She threw the carriage door open violently enough to awaken Alice and to thoroughly startle Mary. Julia turned happily, not at all surprised by Lily's sudden entrance. But then, not much really surprised Julia.</p><p>Alice removed her head from Mary's lap with a start, the latter wincing at the sudden return of blood flow to her limb. “Wha' happened?” she asked blearily. “Someone fall off the train?”</p><p>Mary narrowed her eyes at her friend. “In all of history, have you ever heard of someone falling off the Hogwarts Express, Al?”</p><p>Alice shrugged, her grey eyes totally innocent. “Dunno. First time for everything, I suppose.”</p><p>Mary sighed. “Go back to sleep, Al. You make more sense when you're sleep-talking.”</p><p>Alice seemed to take this at face value, returning her head to its position in Mary's lap. “'f you say so. Night everyone. Night Lily.”</p><p>Lily smiled in return and took the seat opposite the pair. Mary began running her fingers carefully through her best friend's short brown hair before narrowing her eyes at the redhead. “So, Lils. What's got you in such a snit?”</p><p>She scowled. “Dumbledore made a mistake. The Head Boy is a disaster.”</p><p>Julia, a rather tall Asian girl with a face set in a permanent goofy smile piped up. “Oh, you found out it was James, then?”</p><p>Lily stopped short, turning to look at the girl sitting next to her. “You knew? Why didn't you tell me, instead of letting him spring it on me like that?”</p><p>Julia's smile faltered at her friend's irritation. “My daddy is friends with Mr. Potter” she responded. “He and his wife came over for dinner last night, so I only learned yesterday.”</p><p>Oh. Well, that made sense. Lily sighed. “I'm sorry for getting angry, Julia. He's just still a prat is all. It’s not such a big deal, I guess I just spent so long assuming that it would be Remus that it was more jarring than it should have been.” A sudden realization dawned on her – in her frustration with the selection of the Head Boy, she'd forgotten entirely that the two of them would be co-habitating. “Oh Merlin, I have to live with him. I take it back, this is going to be unbearable.”</p><p>Mary looked at her steadily for a few seconds, before asking “Not to... change the subject or anything, but don't the Heads usually patrol the train? I just remember last year, having that slimy git Macnair leering his way up and down the corridor.”</p><p>The world was out to get her for something she’d done, she was sure of it. “Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Ugh. I'll go find Potter and tell him to quit slacking off and we'll start patrols.”</p><p>Once the door had clicked shut behind the vanishing Head Girl, Mary turned to the girl across from her. “You didn't hear about that last night. You owled me about it a week ago, and told me not to tell Lils about it. What was that about? I thought you made it a point to never lie.”</p><p>Julia smiled happily. “Yes, but this is for a good cause, and you know how I feel about those.”</p><p>“Explain?” Mary asked, confusion coloring her face.</p><p>“James being Head Boy isn't all I learned at dinner that night.”</p><p>Mary perked up, leaning forward as much as she could without disturbing the girl fast asleep in her lap. “Oh?”</p>
<hr/><p>Potter was going to give her whiplash at this point, he really was. She'd run into him about twenty seconds after leaving her carriage to find him already patrolling the train. She had barely opened her mouth to warn him off of trying to grope her again when he cut her off with - of all things - an apology.</p><p>“Evans, I’m so sorry for what happened earlier, but it wasn’t my fault, I swear on my cat’s life.”</p><p>Lily blinked, caught off-guard by his eagerness to apologize. “You have a cat?”</p><p>“Yes, but that’s not the point. Somebody jinxed my shoelaces together and when I tried to get up, I tripped. Please, please believe me.”</p><p>It wasn’t the best explanation ever. In fact, it was pretty ridiculous as they go, but he looked so sincere and his apology so genuine. And it was probably best if they could start the school year on at least civil terms. “On your cat’s life, you say?”</p><p>He nodded furiously. “Yes. Look, I couldn’t even get the knot out afterwards; I had to cut them apart.” He pointed to his feet. Indeed, there was a nasty snarl hanging off of one shoelace, the end frayed where it had been severed.</p><p>Lily groaned. “It was probably Mulciber, wasn’t it? He was staring at you and muttering the whole time. Figures he’d be pants at nonverbals.”</p><p>“Yes! Exactly what I was thinking!”</p><p>Lily smirked. “So much for keeping him in line, hmm?”</p><p>“Oy, I’ll have you know I can be quite intimidating when I want to be. I was just trying to be on my best behavior,” James said primly.</p><p>With that, the pair began to walk the corridors, ensuring that their fellow students had a smooth ride back to school. James’ uncharacteristic behavior continued as they patrolled. He was behaving, no, weirder than that - he was acting like an actual, responsible authority figure. Of course, her first instinct had been suspicion. She'd tried asking him what he was up to, what prank he was pulling, even if it was Remus using Polyjuice Potion in an attempt to win some sort of affection for James from her, but he'd just laughed it all off, and continued to patrol with surprising earnestness, making sure that First years knew when they had to change into their robes and telling off a pair of especially rowdy Ravenclaws.</p><p>He was seriously confusing her – it was hard to match up any mental images of the immature prankster that she'd dealt with the six years previous with the boy next to her telling off a couple of third years for playing Exploding Snap in an enclosed space.</p><p>The pair continued their patrols with no incidents other than a pair of fourth years who had tried to smuggle a pair of doxies in an owl cage into the school, and a nasty pang in Lily's chest when she saw Severus sitting with Avery and Mulciber, heads bent over, clearly discussing something vile. Still, as Potter reminded her, “Talking isn't really against the rules, Evans,” though he did throw a withering glare at the back of Mulciber’s head.</p><p>All in all, it was a surprisingly pleasant couple of hours later that the train screeched to a halt. Already changed into their robes, the two Heads directed the first years to Hagrid, and the rest of the students to the carriages that would take them to the castle. Lily hastened to join her friends, hopping in and plopping herself down next to Julia.</p><p>Mary smirked at the new arrival. “So? How were your rounds, Ms. Head?”</p><p>“Pretty nice, actually. Potter seems to have mellowed, or else he's trying something. Either way, it's a nice change of pace, but I'm not going to look into it too much. Still, if he's going to make an effort to get along, I can too.”</p><p>“Lily, as much as we all love you, nobody believes that you're capable of getting along with Potter, no matter how much he’s ‘mellowed’ since the prefect meeting,” Mary noted drily.</p><p>Lily responded as maturely as she knew how (by sticking out her tongue) and the topic of the Head Boy was dropped. Alice quickly filled the silence with enough conversation for all four of them, chattering happily about her summer trip to Venice and all the dashing Italian boys she'd met.</p><p>“Alice,” Mary complained as they left the carriage, heading through the great double doors of the Entrance Hall. “Don't you ever get tired of talking? You're either talking or asleep. It's a wonder you're able to get any boys interested in you at all.”</p><p>Alice grinned cheekily at her best friend. “You're just jealous, Mare-Bear. Don't worry, one day you'll find a guy who's interested in the silent, surly type, and you'll go off and have cranky, mute little children together.” She laughed, linked a scowling Mary's arm in hers, and marched into the Great Hall with a smiling Lily and Julia close behind.</p><p>Surprisingly, the Marauders didn't try anything too outrageous during the Welcome Feast that year. While years previous had been marked by sudden hailstorms, floods of expanding gravy, and the release of a pack of nifflers, to name a few of the more memorable events, this year was unsettlingly calm. Lily found herself on edge throughout the meal, whipping her head around at any sudden noise, and jumping when the food in front of her disappeared and turned into dessert. She looked around at her schoolmates and found that she wasn't the only one perturbed by the uncharacteristic calm of the meal. Edgar Bones, a fifth year Hufflepuff, looked like he'd been thoroughly doused in EverItching Solution, and most of Slytherin House looked about ready to be sick with anticipation of something horrid.</p><p>Still, the meal ended and nothing had exploded, expanded, disappeared, or mysteriously gained sentience, so Lily decided that her first meal as Head Girl was a rather unprecedented success. She made sure that each house's prefects had each of their first-years accounted for, and was about to head to the Gryffindor Tower when she remembered that not only was she not staying with her house-mates that year, but she also didn't really know exactly where it was that she was staying.</p><p>She swore.</p><p>Alice frowned at her. “Lily! There are children around.”</p><p>Lily looked around distractedly – the first years had left, but the second and third years were awfully small. She sighed. “Sorry, I just... It just sort of sunk in that I'm not living in the dorm with you guys anymore.”</p><p>Mary snorted. “You don't see us complaining... Now James is the one who has to deal with waking you up. We should send him flowers. And maybe reserve him a bed in the Hospital Wing.”</p><p>Lily just glared at the blonde before marching off in search of James.</p><p>The three seventh year Gryffindor girls looked at the Head Girl's receding figure. “How long d'you give them?” asked Mary.</p><p>Julia frowned. “What am I giving them?”</p><p>Mary rolled her eyes. “I mean, how long do you think it'll take for our plan to work?”</p><p>“Oh!” Julia brightened. “Um. Three months? I bet we're going to be really good at it.”</p><p>Alice frowned and looked between her two friends. “I'm missing something, right?”</p><p>Mary just grinned, rubbing her hand affectionately over the shorter girl's head. “Don't worry about it Alice. Just something we discussed while you were asleep.”</p><p>Alice pouted. She hated being left out of a good secret.</p>
<hr/><p> Lily found the Head Boy with the rest of his Marauders, lagging behind the crowd heading to the dormitories. She marched over, calling out “Potter!” as she did.</p><p>For some reason, at the mention of one of their names, the entire group felt the need to turn around. Sirius raised an eyebrow. “Hey Prongs! Looks like it worked, she's got the hots for you already!”</p><p>She flushed at the statement and stepped forward, ready to lambast the boy for his words, but Remus beat her to it, swatting Sirius in the back of the head. “Stuff it.”</p><p>Was it her imagination, or did James shoot a nasty look at Sirius, before turning to her? Whatever. “What's up, Evans?” he asked.</p><p>She frowned, not quite sure how to word her question in the presence of his friends. “I just- Ugh. D'you know where our dorm is?”</p><p>He pulled a slip of parchment out of the inside pocket of his robes. “Yeah, I asked Dumbledore right after the Feast ended.” He unfolded the note, and showed it to her. “Says it's on the floor above the library, behind a statue of Grendel the Really Old.”</p><p>Peter scratched his head. “We know where that is, don't we? We hid in a broom closet near there from Filch that one time in third year?”</p><p>Sirius grinned. “Right, mate, we'd... What was it... Charmed the dungeons pink, was it?”</p><p>Peter cut in. “Nah, that was the Halloween prank. We were hiding from Filch because we transfigured Mrs. Norris into a doormat, and he didn't realize until he'd rubbed his boots on her twice, remember?”</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes. Typical. You could count on the Marauders to know where pretty much anything or anyone in the castle was, but they had the most childish reasons for knowing what they did. “So, James. You remember this too?”</p><p>James looked uncomfortable. “Um. Well. Yes. Yes I do.”</p><p>“Of course you do. Well?”</p><p>He balked. “Well what?”</p><p>“Are you going to show me the way?”</p><p>James glared at his “friends”. Were they really laughing at this? “Yeah, absolutely Evans. Just head up the north staircase, and I'll catch up in a mo’.”</p><p>Lily frowned at the still laughing Marauders before accepting James's offer and leaving the Great Hall. The four boys watched her go, until James angrily snapped “Really? It's hard enough trying to act responsible around her without all of you lot going and reminding her that we're really not.”</p><p>Sirius snickered. “We? Prongsy, Moons, Wormy, and I are paragons of maturity.”</p><p>Peter nodded. “Yeah. Moony already acts like an old man.”</p><p>“It's just so difficult to misbehave around him that we might as well give up.”</p><p>“He's such a killjoy.”</p><p>“We might as well start calling him Professor Lupin at this point, insufferable do-gooder that he is.”</p><p>Judging by the look on his face, Remus was anything but amused. “James” he said drily. “Seeing as how I am regrettably not a Professor yet, would you be so kind as to give these two detention for general idiocy?”</p><p>“Aah, Prongsy would never do that to his best mates” vowed Sirius. “We mean far too much to him to waste away in detention.”</p><p>James' expression was even less agreeable than Remus'. “Boys,” he managed, forcing the words out around a clenched jaw. “This is my last year here. I have one more year to win Evans over. Don't fuck this up for me. Okay?” He shot his friends a filthy look and left, jogging to catch up with the Head Girl.</p><p>Sirius turned to Peter and raised an eyebrow. “If he's like this now, how whipped will he be, d'you reckon, if she actually decides to give him a chance?”</p><p>Peter gazed at James' back with a mournful expression. “It'd be worse than that time Filch caught us spiking the faculty lounge's pumpkin juice.”</p><p>Sirius winced. “Mate, I think I still have scars from that. Remind me why we got caught for that one?”</p><p>Peter snorted. “Prongs saw a note that Evans had written McGonagall about our Halloween prank that year, and was convinced that the fact that she'd used his name meant that she was secretly in love with him. He had to stay to read the whole thing, didn't he?”</p><p>“... Prongs is a right git, isn't he?”</p><p>“Yeah, but imagine how bad he'll be if they don't end up together.”</p><p>“Point taken, Wormy, point taken.”</p><p>Remus just sighed and shook his head. “You two are impossible. Remind me why we're friends again?”</p><p>Sirius grinned. “You're secretly madly in love with us?”</p><p>Remus flushed.“Oh you wish. Grow up, you stupid tosser.” He too turned and stalked off, muttering darkly as he made his way towards Gryffindor tower.</p><p>Peter and Sirius watched as he stormed off. “We're really getting good at this whole “drive people off” business, aren't we, Padfoot?”</p><p>“It's good practice, Wormy” said Sirius sagely. “With as many admirers as I've got, it takes real finesse to keep them at arm’s length, sometimes.”</p><p>Peter looked at the other boy for a second, before thoughtfully admitting, “You know, maybe they've got a point. You really don't take anything seriously at all, do you?”</p><p>Sirius made a noise that, coming from anyone else, would be called a giggle. This was Sirius Black though, and he was<em> far </em> too manly for anything less than a chuckle, so Sirius chuckled. “It's all part of my charm, Wormy. All part of the charm.”</p>
<hr/><p> “Evans! Hey! Evans!” She'd moved quickly, or James had been talking longer than he'd expected to. Either way, she'd made it a lot further than he'd anticipated, and he'd ended up having to run to catch up to her. “I- Look, I'm sorry that my friends are a bunch of gits, okay? And I'm sorry again for the train. So so sorry.”</p><p>She turned around and shrugged. “Eh. I overreacted, I guess. I'm sorry as well. I guess I should be used to it by now.”</p><p>He looked warily at the girl in front of him. “You're... You're sorry? Geez, Evans, I was expecting a lot more than that.”</p><p>Another shrug. “I mean, you apologized first. And I saw you making an effort to be less of a git just then, so it’s only fair that I do the same, right? I mean, we're living together. We're gonna have to learn to get along somehow.”</p><p>He must be dreaming or something, because really, this was not Lily Evans in front of him. “I... Don't get me wrong, Evans, that sounds great and all, but this is pretty sudden. Where's this coming from?”</p><p>She grinned. “I noticed that the Marauders didn't try to pull something big tonight. At first I thought maybe the lack of a prank was the prank, you know, make us all wary over nothing, but then I figured that that was too clever for you.”</p><p>By the way he was looking at her, a casual passerby might have expected Lily to have sprouted a third arm, or perhaps grown purple tentacles in place of hair. She swiped nervously at her cheek, uncomfortable under his eyes. “Do I have something on my face? What's wrong? Is it my hair?”</p><p>James just shook his head. “I just... Wow. You've hated me for so long, it's just such a quick turn-about. I'm a little spell-shocked.”</p><p>Lily laughed derisively. “Hated you? You give yourself far too much credit, Potter. If anything, you just irritated me. Hating you would have taken up too much of my spare time.” She grinned cheekily at him. “You weren't worth it.”</p><p>Honestly, if it wasn't for that grin she'd flashed him (the first smile of hers that she'd directed towards him in the six years that he'd known her, and yes, he was keeping track) he probably would have been heartbroken right there. “Well, give it time. I'll win you over soon enough.”</p><p>“Win me over to what? Hating you?”</p><p>“Y'know, I bet you could hate me a lot quicker if you started calling me James. Familiarize yourself with the enemy and all, yeah?”</p><p>“You are really bizarre, Potter.”</p><p>He just shrugged. “Well, you're putting up with me, so that's enough progress for one day, I guess. I'll get you to call me James tomorrow.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes and chuckled. “Good luck with that.”</p><p>“Luck is for the weak” James scoffed. “Marauders make their own.”</p><p>“Oh really? I didn't think you lot paid attention in Potions nearly enough for that.”</p><p>The banter continued as the pair made their way to their new lodgings. Once the initial shock of a Lily Evans receptive to conversation had worn off, James found that she was surprisingly easy to talk to, even if her sense of humor was, perhaps, a little drier and more subtle than that of his fellow Marauders.</p><p>There was a moment of discomfort when the pair reached a statue of an ancient, wizened wizard and realized that neither of them knew the password. The two looked briefly at each other, about to ask if the other new the password, when the statue spoke. “The Head Boy and Girl, I presume?” he rasped, in a feeble voice. “Well then. Select a password, and I'll show you in.”</p><p>Lily looked at James. “Any suggestions, then?”</p><p>“Felix Felicis?” He shrugged. “You're right, all I know is the name.”</p><p>She almost laughed. “This is what you call making your own luck? Pathetic, Potter.” She turned, and addressed the statue. “Felix Felicis.”</p><p>The statue bowed slightly, wincing at the gesture and stepped aside, the wall behind it melting into a door. “Your rooms.”</p><p>“After you then, Lily,” James offered gallantly.</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes. “Be still, my heart” she laughed, pushing the door open and stepping inside.</p>
<hr/><p> “Mare? Julia?” Alice asked as the three girls settled into their beds for the night. “What was all that in the Great Hall earlier on?”</p><p>Mary glanced at the third girl in the room. “Julia? It's your story.”</p><p>Julia grinned happily. Letting Alice in on their plans would make it so much more entertaining and Alice could help! She had all kinds of useful experiences. “Okay!” She paused, chewing on her lower lip as she tried to figure out where to begin. “Well,” she started, “My daddy moved back to Wizard London after momma left, and he met Mr. Potter at work. And they both liked their chips with mayonnaise, so they became friends, and now Mr. Potter comes over for dinner once a month, and sometimes he brings Mrs. Potter, but never James for some reason, and we never go over there, and I think it's because Daddy doesn't like that they have so many house elves.” Julia paused to take a breath. “And so he was over last week, and we were eating chicken, and then Mrs. Potter asked if I knew who Head Girl was, and so I said yes! It's my friend Lily! So she asked if that was Lily Evans, and I asked how she knew Lily, and she said that she didn't, and that confused me, because how did she know Lily's last name, so I asked her that. And she said that James talked about Lily all the time at home, and didn't know why Lily didn't like him back, and that he wrote her poetry but didn't send it, which I think is silly, because if you write somebody poetry, you obviously want them to know how you feel, so he should have sent it, but I didn't say that.”</p><p>Mary laughed. “Tell her the best part, Jules.”</p><p>Julia's smile widened. “Well, after we ate blueberry pie and Mr. Potter cleaned off the stain where he dropped pie on the tablecloth, they got up to leave, and as they were leaving, Mrs. Potter asked me if I could please point Lily in the right direction so that she could have a non-mopey son back, and Mr. Potter agreed, but said that it might be harder to keep James from messing things up than it would be to get Lily on the right track. And I didn't really know what they meant, so I asked Mrs. Potter why I couldn't just buy Lily a map or a compass, because that would be easier, and she looked confused, but my daddy just laughed and told me that he'd explain later.” Julia smiled happily, having completed her explanation of that night's events.</p><p>Alice looked confused, a rather common state for anyone who spoke to Julia for too long. Mary, however, was well-versed in Julia-logic, and was able to clarify. “Basically, the Potters want us to play match-maker for Lily and James.”</p><p>Alice's squealed in surprise, and her eyes crinkled with glee. She bounded over to Mary's bed, throwing the girl into a tight embrace. “This is going to be the best year ever!” she shrieked.</p><p>Mary grinned contentedly. “Yeah, Al, yeah it is.”</p>
<hr/><p> In the Head's dormitory, things were surprisingly comfortable. Lily and James had arrived to find a set of rooms not that unlike those found in the Gryffindor common room. Their (admittedly smaller) common room was furnished with squashy armchairs and had a small fireplace set against the left wall. The back wall had two doors which lead to the two bedrooms, each of which had another door which opened into the joint bathroom. Lily despaired at the single shower while James turned slightly pink when he realized that they were sharing the facilities.</p><p>However, once the initial shock of their shared living space wore off, the two decided that all things considered, their situations could be worse. The dorm was spacious enough that they could ignore the other when necessary, but small enough that it felt rather homey. Both were, by nature, relatively neat and tidy, and as James pointed out, neither of them were Slytherins, so they had that going for them.</p><p>They reached several ground rules rather quickly, Lily insisting that the Marauders could<em> not </em> use the dorm as a party-house, and James replying that rules, like formal-wear, were stifling, thank you very much. There was all the awkwardness that would be expected of two teenagers forced to live with a member of the opposite sex for the first time, but it wasn't insurmountable. Their interactions were pleasant enough that Head Boy and Head Girl bade each other good night feeling as excited about the coming school year as they had been upon waking.</p><p>Lily lay awake in bed for a period thinking of her responsibilities as Head Girl, her classes, her friends, and the looming threat of N.E.W.T.s and of career placement before eventually succumbing to sleep.</p><p>James lay awake even longer thinking of Lily.</p>
<hr/><p>This isn’t a love story - not exactly. This is a story about heartbreak, and about losing friends, and about how cruel children can be, intentionally or not, to those that they hate and to those that they love. This is a story about friends and enemies, and about choices between right and wrong. But most of all, this is a story about two promises that Lily Evans made to herself as that she did not keep.</p><p>This story will not have a happy ending.</p>
