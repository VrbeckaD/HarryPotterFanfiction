    <p>“Do we really have to do this?” Ron sighed as he sat down at the table. The pensieve was set up and waiting.  </p><p>Harry and Hermione were already seated, had been for ages, doing that thing they sometimes did, where their thoughts seemed to fly side by side, tossing one point or another back and forth in sighs and glances. (It was related to the thing that he did with Harry, but not the same. He and Harry talked when they did it, and it was always a shorter exchange, just because Ron favored solutions over brooding in all but the direst of circumstances.)  Ron’s question brought them out of their silent conversation.  </p><p>“We don’t have to,” Hermione replied, “not if you’re against it, but I thought-” </p><p>“It’s not me,” Ron interrupted. “It’s you two.  You’ve both been so quiet since you set that thing there. I’m fine. I don’t care one way or another, but clearly you both do. I don’t want anything that hurts my best friends.”  </p><p>“We’re getting married in a week,” Harry pointed out, a smile making its slow dawn on his face before he laughed at his own silliness and continued. “We’re at least your fiancés. I want to do this. I never want to hide from you. I want to know anything you want to tell me.”  </p><p>Hermione took Harry’s hand in hers even as Ron nearly upset the small table in his dive for a kiss. It’d been about a year, but the novelty of being allowed to kiss Harry had yet to fade, for either of them.  Harry grinned when Ron pulled away. He turned to Hermione.  </p><p>“Do you still want to do it?” Harry asked her.  </p><p>“Of course,” Hermione replied. “I want to know what you were like. I want to have you there in my memories, in so many ways.”  </p><p>Hermione paused, collecting her thoughts before taking one of Ron’s hands in hers and smiling as Ron completed the triangle, taking Harry’s free hand in his, out of habit.  </p><p>“I think that I needed you before I had you,” Hermione said softly, “before the troll walked into the bathroom, before you had each other even. I think that we all needed this love before it was ours. I want to know that for sure; I want us to remember it always.”  </p><p>“Alright, then.” Ron said. “Memories that we haven’t shared before, because my best friends – don’t correct me, you’ll never stop being my best friends- are melodramatic gits. Who’s up first?”   </p><p>“I’ll go,” Hermione said decisively, pulling her hands from theirs. “This was my idea.”  </p><p>Harry and Ron nodded and watched as she brought her wand to her temple and pulled out a strand of memory, bright and shining. She swirled it into the Pensieve and looked happier to have it out. Ron shared a glance with Harry, but together they let themselves lean forward and down, until they fell, mind and heart, into the memory. Hermione followed, just a breath behind them. </p><hr/><p> </p><p>They found themselves outside; in a playground at a muggle school.  It was a bright day on the edge of spring, and children had left sweaters in the grass at the edge of the playground or hanging on fences. Several were sprawled out, looking at the sky and taking joy in the rare sunny afternoon.  </p><p>Harry and Ron wandered around, looking for Hermione’s face in the group. They heard her first; a high smaller version of her voice, and they turned and walked towards it, while the older Hermione followed, watching.  </p><p>The younger version was sitting with three or four other girls in a patch of shade around a tree, rambling about something she’d read as they played with loops of string that seemed to be laces from their shoes. </p><p>“This is a Cat’s Eye figure, I read all about them. People all over the world play games just like this, can you imagine it? And they've played them for ages; a thousand years, millions of girls all playing games like ours! Fascinating!”  </p><p>Hermione watched her fiancés’ faces, noting with some pleasure how Ron’s smile had gone soft and warm, and the brightness of Harry’s eyes as he tried not to laugh. She could relive this now. These people loved her.  </p><p>“It’s not,” one of the girls said suddenly, grabbing harshly at the string twined around Hermione’s fingers. “It never is. Why can’t we talk about something fun? You never make any sense at all, they're just too nice to say.”  </p><p>“I thought it was fun,” Hermione said, now sounding quite uncertain. “I didn’t mean to-” </p><p>“Stop talking,” another girl said suddenly. “You always talk  and it doesn’t mean anything. Especially in class. You’re a teacher's pet.”  </p><p>One by one the other girls joined in, and the younger Hermione looked more and more confused and hurt, until finally she stood and walked away, not seeing how the bag she’d left hanging on a low tree branch disappeared, or feeling it's weight as it reappeared on her back. She sped to a run.  </p><p>The older Hermione took off after her, and Ron and Harry ran too.  </p><p>“I’ve met acromantula that were friendlier than that lot,” Ron said.  </p><p>Harry shrugged and focused his eyes ahead, “kids are terrible sometimes, especially when they don’t understand. You weren’t exactly extending a hand in friendship when you first met her.”  </p><p>“I’m going to spend my life with her, I think I can be forgiven a few weeks of being terrible. None of them can say that,” Ron shot back.  </p><p>“They aren’t the point,” Hermione called back to them. They were running through hallways in the school until they came to a stop at the doors of the library. “Not the whole point, anyway.” </p><p>Young Hermione stood in the library and took a deep breath. A smile formed on her face, a sad one that made Harry think about times both dire and mundane. That was the smile she’d grow up to wear when she talked about her parents, in the forest of Dean. It was the smile she'd someday wear after meetings with the older, more intractable ministry officials. </p><p>“That’s it,” Hermione said, fascinated. “That is the moment when I looked on everything I loved; the library and what it meant, on my house with all its books, my parents who loved that I loved knowledge too. In this moment I saw all of that and decided that those girls, who I’d thought of as my friends for years, didn’t matter. They didn’t understand, and they wouldn’t let me explain or apologize. They could not properly see me, so they didn’t matter. I was nice enough after that, but I knew what I knew, and if other people had a problem with that, I tried to remember that they didn’t matter either.”  </p><p>The memory froze and Hermione looked up at Harry and Ron as it changed.  </p><p>This time Harry recognized the room, but Ron pointed out Hermione standing beside a wall of flames. They were in the troll room, in the long corridor of tests that had guarded the sorcerer’s stone. </p><p> “Ok, so what’s this?” Ron asked, watching the memory of Hermione take several deep breaths, only to gag a little at the smell of the troll.  </p><p>“I could have lost you both here,” Hermione said distantly. “Ron, you’d been knocked out and I had no way to know if that chess piece had hurt you more badly than we’d seen. Harry, I’d just seen you walk through fire into still more danger, possibly right into Voldemort’s hands. And what I said to you? About friendship and bravery being more important than books and cleverness? I’d felt it for ages, I just hadn’t known how true it was, how brilliant it could be… I’d trusted Ron to get through the chess game and then you trusted me to get through the riddle, and go back to help Ron. If this day had been different, if we hadn’t been who we were, we’d have died, and so would a lot of people. Voldemort was within the wards of Hogwarts, even without the stone it could have been terrible, but you both saw me. You let me explain, even after my panic with the devil’s snare. You let me see you. That mattered. Our friendship saved everything.”  </p><p>The Hermione in the memory crossed the room and went off to see to Ron. The three let her go, as Harry and Ron looked at the present-day Hermione in awe. She left the memory and the other two followed, still staring at her.  </p><p>She leaned forward and kissed Harry, finding in his touch a home that could not be shaken, a heat that could never be chilled, and a light that was her sun.  </p><p>She kissed Ron and was met with challenges she’d never put to rest, a tempest that could not fail to leave her breathless, and the fire that fed her soul.  </p><p>“My life,” she said finally, “could have been fine, and nice, and short without you two, but it’s this instead. Every day, you save me, every part of who we are matters.”  </p><p>Harry and Ron seemed dizzy with that, and they took long moments to process what she’d said before Ron spoke.  </p><p>“So which of us is going to have to follow that,” Ron said, “because I vote Harry.”  </p><p>Hermione swatted half-heartedly in his direction and Harry laughed.  </p><p>“Just for that I think you should go next,” Harry said. When Hermione nodded her agreement, Ron groaned, but got to work preparing his chosen memories.</p>
