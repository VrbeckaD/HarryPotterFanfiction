    <p>
  <span>Bellatrix has a wand at Sirius's throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Moony, take Harry and run," Sirius says. Harry can see Remus moving towards him, and he knows how this ends - with green light and death and him as the only survivor. And this is all, ALL, his fault. He fell for the trap. He led his friends here.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Bellatrix has a wand at Sirius’s throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No one should suffer or die except for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You have a ‘saving-people’ thing… </span>
  </em>
  <span>Hermione’s voice in his head. Maybe he does. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Definitely he does.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because Bellatrix has a wand at Sirius’s throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And that is Not Acceptable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry flips his wand in his hand, holding it hilt out towards Lucius Malfoy. “Allow everyone in this room to go, alive and free with no further harm, and I'll surrender to the Dark Lord.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Harry NO!" come several voices in unison. Harry tunes them out. He has to save Sirius.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And the prophecy?” Lucius asks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry opens his left hand to show that he is the one holding the orb. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Accepted," says Lucius. He takes too long steps forward and grasps Harry by the wrist. “Bellatrix, release your cousin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry can see that Sirius charges towards them as soon as he’s released, but the world swirls and he feels as if he’s being sucked through a straw. </span>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>When he lands in a crumpled heap, he vomits up all over a marble floor, but the sick is vanished away before he can really register. Lucius plucks his wand and the Orb out of his hands, and strides away, in a swirl of robes. The other Death Eaters are popping in around him, and walking away.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>They’re just going to leave me here? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry wonders. At least it isn’t a dungeon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he’s too proud to remain on the floor, like a piece of baggage. He drags himself to his feet slowly, and follows his captors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Probably to his death.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At least he saved Sirius first.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry Potter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knows that voice, from so many dreams. From the night in the graveyard. From the Chamber of Secrets. From the trapdoor in first year.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Never before has that voice had the power to do what it’s doing now… to draw him forward, to where Lord Voldemort is sitting on a throne-like chair and fall to his knees. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You did not understand when you offered your surrender, did you, Harry Potter?” The Dark Lord says, his voice amused, as he reaches out and strokes Harry’s face. “There is Old Magic in the word Surrender. You no longer wish to fight me, do you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry struggles with the answer, but finally all he can say is, “No, my Lord.” He looks up, into crimson eyes, feeling his own eyes fill with tears. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m not a Death Eater! I’m not!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are not,” the Dark Lord says. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Legilimency</span>
  </em>
  <span>. “You cannot fight against me. That does not mean you will fight for me. Yet.” His fingers stroke Harry’s scar, and it somehow feels like… warmth? Safety? Surely not. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lucius, you have pleased me. Take our guest and have him cared for. Allow him anything he wishes except for his wand. Allow him to send an owl to his friends, if he wishes,” the Dark Lord says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, my Lord.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry Potter, I will see you soon.”</span>
</p><p> </p>
