          <div class="userstuff"><p>Queenie was excited to celebrate the holiday. She and Tina always enjoyed Chanukah but it was extra special this year because she had Jacob and she was pretty sure that Tina was harbouring some feelings for Newt.  She lit the menorah on the table with her wand and began to cook latkes on the stove. When everything was set, she called Tina,  Jacob and Newt to the table.  She was ready to begin the first of eight days of Chanukah.</p></div>
