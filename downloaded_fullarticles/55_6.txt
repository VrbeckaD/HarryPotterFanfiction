    <p>Jackson Wang. 7th year Gryffindor, House Prefect, Beater and Quidditch Captain was most definitely not having a panic attack.</p><p>Now if he could only convince his body of that.</p><p>Today had started off bad and had snowballed to worse. Between waking up late, missing breakfast, and somehow getting caught in between whatever prank war Peeves and the Bloody Baron had going on Jackson found himself in Transfiguration unable to perform a simple spell. Okay it might have been Advanced Transfiguration, and a decidedly not simple spell, but it was one that he had done countless times so after the third or fifth or fiftieth time of it not working Jackson knocked the cup over in frustration.</p><p>“Wr. Wang are you finished?” Jackson looked up sheepishly at Headmistress McGonagall who stared him down tight lipped and disapproving. </p><p>“I’m really sorry Professor.” Picking up the cup Jackson stared at it feeling the tell-tale signs of tears prick at his eyes. “I’m really sorry.”</p><p>“Minus five for the outburst Mr. Wang,” Jackson hung his head low trying not to hear the hourglass in the wall take away the house points. Squeezing his eyes closed he tried to calm his racing heart. “Mr. Wang,” Headmistress McGonagall’s voice was close enough she could whisper, “Jackson.”</p><p>“Yes ma’am?” Jackson didn’t look up. If he did he would start crying and he didn’t want to do that in front of the classroom while they all stared at him.</p><p>“Take your bag, you are excused for the day.” Jackson nodded clenching his teeth. “You need to take a break Jackson. I don’t want to see my star pupil burn out before he’s graduated.”</p><p>“I won’t let you down ma’am,” Jackson slung his bag over his shoulder. “I’ll take a nap during my free period and makeup my work tomorrow.”</p><p>“That’s my boy,” Headmistress McGonagall smiled smally. For as waspish and unforgiving as the woman was she truly wanted to see her students succeed.</p><p>Jackson had made it out the door with his head held up and about half a hallway down before the little control he had left shattered and he found himself nearly on his knees trying to breathe past the constricting pain in his chest.</p><p>
  <i>Meow!</i>
</p><p>Jackson blinked. Sitting in front of him was a ball of orange fluff with big green eye purring loudly.</p><p>
  <i>Meow!</i>
</p><p>The cat stood up to wind between his legs purring louder. Jackson closed his eyes a moment to take a steading breath and when he opened them again another three cats had appeared.</p><p>“What the hell?” The four cats all looked up at him expectantly. “I don’t have any treats for you, I’m sorry.”</p><p>“You look like shit.” Jackson could only blink in surprise. Leaning on the wall next to him a man in Hufflepuff robes had a cat on his shoulder, one in his arms, and what looked to be a kitten in a pocket. “You keep taking on more stuff, I’m surprised you lasted this long.” Jackson wanted to laugh but the remnants of panic was still clawing at him. “You look like you need some tea. C’mon.” This was the Hufflepuff, Jackson realized, that everyone had dubbed ‘the Hogwarts Cryptid’ for his uncanny ability to be surrounded by no less than ten cats at any time and have no end of food. “Can I?” Jackson looked down at the hand held out in the air between them. Tentatively he uncurled the fingers clutching at the front of his robes and took it. “Jackson right?”</p><p>“Yeah,” the cat on the Hogwarts Cryptid’s shoulder sniffed the air a few times before making the small jump to his. “Oh?”</p><p>“That’s Jasmine. She’s a third year’s cat but likes to hang around with us,” the man smiled. “She doesn’t usually take to strangers. It took me a few days to get her to let me pet her.” As if just to spite the man Jasmine rubbed her head against Jackson’s cheek. “Ready?” </p><p>“Yeah,” Jackson let himself be lead down the corridors, blushing slightly as he realized the man still held his hand firmly in his. Every so often Jackson found that the Cryptid - he really needed to learn this man’s name - would glance over and give a soft smile. “What’s your name?”</p><p>“Jaebum,” as they turned the corner a few cats broke off from the group only to be replaced by a waiting set. “You can call me JB.”</p><p>“Where are we going JB?” Jackson liked the feel of the man’s name on his tongue. It wasn’t a secret he was gay, a particularly embarrassing incident in his third year had outed him, so while he was mostly definitely checking out the Cryptid of Hogwarts that everyone failed to mention was hot as fuck, he tried to keep his eyes on the floor in front of him.</p><p>“We’re going to the kitchens. Though Twinky will have my head if I bring the cats in again,” JB frowned. “Too many kids with allergies to allow them in where the food is stored you know?”</p><p>“I didn’t even think of that,” Jackson almost tripped when JB stopped suddenly. “A painting?”</p><p>“Most people don’t think about it. I certainly didn’t.” For the first time since they started walking JB pulled his hand away. With a heart broken look JB set the cat in his arm down, took the kitten from his pocket and stepped close making Jackson’s heart thud in his chest. “ - the pear.”</p><p>“What?” Jackson couldn’t hear past the rush of blood in his ears. He knew he was blushing because even as JB removed Jasmine from his shoulders a sly smile worked its way across his face.</p><p>“I said,” JB leaned into whisper into his ear, “to get in you <i>tickle the pear</i>.”</p><p>Jackson swallowed thickly before answering breathlessly. “Right. Tickle the bear.”</p><p>“Pear,” JB pulled back slowly looking up and down Jackson’s face. “Tea is getting cold.”</p><p>***</p><p>“What the fuck.” Jackson circled the Gryffindor dorm for the thirty-fifth time, much to Youngjae’s amusement. “Oh my god he’s so hot what the fuck. How did no one tell me?”</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve seen you this fucked up since the time we met up with Namjoon in Hogsmead,” Youngjae laughed.</p><p>“We DO NOT talk about the Hogsmead incident,” Jackson ran his fingers through his hair. “I’m still not entirely convinced he’s forgiven me for outing us.”</p><p>“Trust me, if Kim Namjoon hated you, you would know it,” Youngjae laughed. Namjoon went to Beauxbatons, though with his brain he could go to any magical school in the world and they would throw flowers at his feet. Namjoon preferred the quiet of Beauxbatons to the noise of Durmstrang and the string of cursed shit that happened at Hogwarts. “So tell me about your date with Mothman.”</p><p>“You’re hanging out with the American too much. What’s his name? Mark?” Jackson snorted.</p><p>“I’m dating Mark,” Youngjae shot back haughtily.</p><p>“I thought you were dating Jinyoung?” Jackson turned tilting his head.</p><p>“I’m…” Youngjae seemed to shrink a bit, eyes darting around, “I’m dating both of them.”</p><p>“Oh thank god,” Jackson sighed in relief. “I thought something happened with you and Jin and I was going to spend the whole year hearing about it. HEY!” Jackson nearly fell over when a pillow connected with his head. </p><p>“You’re terrible now tell me about your date with Mothman.” Youngjae accept his pillow back as Jackson sat down.</p><p>“He’s really fucking hot,” Jackson fanned himself.</p><p>“You say that again and we’re no longer friends,” Youngjae hit him in the shoulder with the pillow again making them laugh.</p><p>“Okay. So his name is Jaebum and likes to be called JB,” Jackson leaned back on his arms. “He’s apparently adopted nearly every cat on campus except these two that just won’t budge and it drives him crazy.”</p><p>“I will bet money those are Bambam’s,” Youngjae grinned. “Bambam? Sixth year Slytherin? White hair?”</p><p>“OH!” Jackson knew exactly who the younger meant now. “The ‘Thai Weasley’ that McGonagall is always bitching about.”</p><p>“Slughorn loves him,” Youngjae snorted. “But I’m pretty sure that’s because he’s a protege at potions. Anyway his cats don’t like anyone but him.”</p><p>“I’ll have to pass that on to JB when I see him again,” Jackson grinned then stopped a little melancholy. If it took seven years to meet him this time what were the chances of seeing him again? “If I see him again.”</p><p>“I swear to god if you spend this whole year pining I will actually let Jinyoung murder you,” Youngjae glared. “I can already see it. Ugh. Put a silencing charm up when you go to bed. For me.”</p><p>“That was on-”</p><p>“It was more then once you menace,” Youngjae glared.</p><p>“Okay fair,” Jackson let himself drop onto the bed. “He’s a little...odd. But like, a good odd. We spent most of the time talking about the cats and how he’s failing everything but Care For Magical Creatures and Herbology. He didn’t make me talk about anything. I dunno it was just. Nice to not be Golden Boy Jackson Wang.”</p><p>“He’s failing...the year just started. We’re not even a month in,” Youngjae pinched the bridge of his nose. “Yugyeom was right.”</p><p>“That’s the really fucking tall Hufflepuff right? Afraid of owls because of the noises?” Jackson searched his brain. There were only a few people that he hadn’t met over the years here and while it meant he met everybody it also meant he met <i>everybody</i>. Despite his best efforts some people just didn’t stick, but their habits or idoscycies did.</p><p>“Yeah. I told him about that silencing charm idea you had and he about cried. It makes breakfast so much easier for him now that he can put a little bubble around himself and close his eyes,” Youngjae smiled. “He’s also dating Bambam so naturally he’s got the entirety of Slytherin in his back pocket and doesn’t even know.”</p><p>“Oh he knows.=,” Jackson finally remembered the face to the name. The two had been dating since third year? Probably third year. “Just because he’s a Puff doesn’t mean he’s not a sadist. You know the shit he pulls in Potions? Where if you fuck around you get paired with him and then the asshole does all kinds of stuff to sabotage and kill you?”</p><p>“Mark got paired with him the other day and I’m pretty sure that took five years off his life,” Youngjae fell over laughing. “He complained for hours after we got out.”</p><p>“Anyway speaking of Mark I hear he made seeker like, two days into the school year,” Jackson frowned. “I’m going down to the pitch next week to watch them practice. I want the cup since this is my final year.”</p><p>“He’s going to kick your ass and I’m living for it.” Youngjae smiled at his scandalized look. “Hey now, I can support both you and him.”</p><p>“We’re your house!” Jackson pressed a hand to his heart with mock indignation.</p><p>“And you wrote the cheers for all of the house so bleh,” Youngjae stuck his tongue out. It was true, in his first year Jackson had written Quidditch cheers for each of the houses and that was a bone of contention for a while considering the level of competition the game inspired. Jackson just wanted everyone to have fun and after a few years any grumbling that remained was kept within the small groups that didn’t like him anyway so he didn’t worry about it.</p><p>“Tomorrow is an early morning and I have to go cryptid hunting,” Jackson smiled.</p><p>“Silencing charm or I will kill you,” Youngjae glared. “Better yet, I’ll put it up. <i>Silenco</i>.”</p><p>***</p><p>Jackson sat at his desk definitely, for sure, absolutely not pouting.</p><p>He was brooding. There was a difference no matter what Jinyoung said.</p><p>Jackson had rolled out of bed early that morning to try to hunt down JB in the many corridors of the school but to no avail. Determined to find the other Jackson again missed breakfast and searched right up until he had to sprint down the corridor to get to class on time. Walking into potions he slipped into the only open seat which was next to none other than the white haired Slytherin Bambam. Despite his best efforts to stay quiet they only got about halfway through the class when Bambam got annoyed.</p><p>“If you sigh one more time I'm going to dump this firedrake oil on you,” Bambam grumbled next to him. “Why is the golden boy pouting?”</p><p>“I'm not pouting I'm brooding,” Jackson sniffed grumpily. Letting the silence stretch out for a few minutes longer he caved. “How does one find the Hogwarts Cryptid?”</p><p>“Ah,” Bambam nodded his head solemnly. “Yuggie,” Yugyeom perked up from his desk at the sound of Bambam's voice, “how can the golden boy find the hobo?” The smile on Yugyeom’s face crumpled to an annoyed flat look.</p><p>“Don't be pissy,” Yugyeom huffed rolling his eyes, “just because cats like JB doesn't mean you have to be rude.” Bambam made an ugly noise arching an eyebrow. The two leveled unimpressed looks at each other until the Hufflepuff blinked in confusion and looked back to Jackson. “Why are you looking for JB?” Under the suddenly interested stares Jackson flashed crimson. He hadn't thought of a good excuse for why he needed to know.</p><p>“Oh my god this is amazing,” Bambam nearly vibrated in glee, “I take back everything I said on the train. This is year is going to be amazing.” By this time Mark and Jinyoung, who were seated next to them, had turned to see what was going on and from the look on Jinyoung’s face both Ravenclaws had already figured it out.</p><p>“They say if you want to find the Cryptid you must follow the cats.” Mark supplied from the desk next to them getting a solemn nod from everyone surrounding them.</p><p>“I <i>hate</i> all of you!” Jackson groaned burying his face into this folded arms.</p><p>“Mr. Wang,” at the sound of disapproval in Slughorn’s voice Jackson contemplated splashing himself with the firedrake oil, but decided third degree burns would mean a night with Madame Pomfrey and not JB. “Would you like to be paired with Mr. Kim for the rest of the day?”</p><p>“No sir,” Jackson smiled pointed not looking at Yugyeom grinning maliciously.</p><p>“Then pay attention.” Slughorn turned his attention to the currently blonde American, “for your comment Mr. Tuan, you will be paired with Mr. Kim tomorrow.” Jackson had to dig his nails into his palm to keep from laughing at Mark's distressed face. Maybe if the seeker got blown up before the Quidditch match they'd have a shot at the cup.</p><p>During the next few days Jackson didn't have time to think about the Hufflepuff that no matter how hard he tried seemed to elude him. Quidditch was beginning to start up and the afternoons were filled with classes that were followed by nights filled with running drills.</p><p>Jackson had nearly given up when a week after his encounter, a puff of orange caught his attention. </p><p>
  <i>Follow the cats</i>
</p><p>“Oh fuck it why not,” Jackson picked up his bag and began following the orange cat. Three hallways later he stumbled upon another few acts and was delighted to see Jasmine among them. “Hey there pretty girl,” kneeling down Jackson rubbed his fingers together to coax her closer. “Remember me?” Jasmine purred rubbing her head into his palm. “Do you know where your buddy is?”</p><p>“So that's what you were doing,” Jackson jumped when JB materialized next to him.</p><p>“How do you do <i>that</i>?” Jackson held a hand over his heart beating wildly in his chest. “You really are Mothman.” That got a full body laugh from JB.</p><p>“Jinyoung threatened to deck me of I didn't talk to you,” JB smiled at him pointing up.</p><p>“Why?” Jackson stood up seeing Jinyoung and Mark leaning over a rail three floors up, Mark obviously laughing as Jinyoung pulled him away.</p><p>“You've been following my cats,” JB’s mouth curled into soft smile making Jackson blush realizing he had been caught. “I've been following you.”</p><p>“The fact we're still alive means Jinyoung got accepted into that Healer program at Saint Mungo’s,” Jackson grinned rubbing the back of his neck and looking at the ground.</p><p>“So,” JB leaned in so close Jackson could feel the older's breath on his lips, “what can Mothman do for you?”</p><p>“I...” Jackson was lightheaded and he grasped for words, “tea?”</p><p>“Just tea?” JB's smile grew tilting his head he leaned just a bit closer and Jackson felt himself tremble. “Meet me in the kitchens for lunch. Remember how to get in?”</p><p>“Tickle the pear,” Jackson leaned forward a bit.</p><p>“Good boy,” JB cooed. The words were like lightning through Jackson's body and whatever stray bit of blood he had left pooled immediately into his gut. “Goodbye Jackson.” And just as quick as he appeared he was gone leaving Jackson with a racing heart and tent in his pants.</p><p>Distantly he heard the bell toll. He was late for astronomy.</p><p>“FUCK.”</p><p>***</p><p>There were only two classes between him and lunch. Jackson felt like they took the collective seven years he'd been there to get through. The moment McGonagall released them Jackson stuffed everything into his backpack and ran down to the kitchens. When he arrived JB was nowhere to be found. Figuring he had gotten out before the other he sat down and waited.</p><p>And waited.</p><p>And waited.</p><p>“Mr. Wang sir,” Twinky approached looking sad, “lunchtime has ended sir. You must be getting to class.”</p><p>“Oh,” Jackson said softly fiddling with the tea cup and looking at the full one across the table. “Okay. Thanks Twinky.”</p><p>Gathering his things Jackson exited the kitchens running face first into a warm body once he closed the painting behind him.</p><p>“Oh thank Merlin I caught you,” Jackson blinked up at a frazzled looking JB. “I'm so sorry.”</p><p>“What took you?” Jackson knew he sounded small. He had been stood up plenty of times but despite knowing next to nothing about JB being left alone had hurt.</p><p>“Trelawney was on some kind of bender and didn't let us leave,” JB looked more and more flustered running his fingers through his hair, “then McGonagall came in and it got worse,” Jackson smothered a smile, “and then the fucking <i>stairs kept moving</i>.” </p><p>“JB?” Jackson chuckled catching his attention.</p><p>“Yeah?” JB finally looked back at him.</p><p>“Can I kiss you?” Jackson didn't have a chance to be nervous because JB stepped forward cradling his face and kissing him first. The soft brush of lips made his whole body feel like jelly and just as Jackson thought he would melt onto the floor JB pulled back an inch to catch his breath.</p><p>“Fuck, I've been wanting to do that since fourth year,” JB kissed him again. This one was much slower, the hands on his face sliding back into his hair and all Jackson could do was clutch at the front of JB’s robes trying to remember that some point they’d have to breathe. “Tomorrow. Lunch. I'll walk out of class if I have to.” Jackson blinked up at him. “If...if you’re stil-” Jackson smiled into the kiss he pulled JB into.</p><p>“Yeah. I still want to,” Jackson felt like he was lighter than air. “We’re so late for class.”</p><p>“I’ve been later and Hagrid thinks I’m the best thing since Charlie Weasley,” JB had a faint blush on his face and that did funny things to Jackson’s heart. “But Binns is going to make your life miserable.” Jackson groaned burying his face into the shirt without thinking about it. Being a naturally tactile person, Jackson never really thought about touching other people unless they asked specifically for him to not touch them. Most of the Gryffindor students had been his cuddle buddy or pillow at some point or another and became so desensitized to it that Jackson could flop on any of them in a class room and they would continue to go about their day. The hands in his hair slipped out only for strong arms to wrap around and pull him close making him all but purr in contentment as he moved his face to rest in the crook of JB’s neck. “Let’s skip.”</p><p>“We can’t skip,” Jackson gumbled looking up with a glare. “Quidditch captain AND Prefect here. They’ll have Filch hang my by my toes.”</p><p>“What if I make it worth it?” JB’s sly smile was back and it made Jackson’s heart kick against his ribs. “Damn,” JB’s face scrunched up as the clicking of heels on the floor echoed.</p><p>“Mr. Im,” McGonagall’s voice was heavy with disapproval, “Mr. Wang.”</p><p>“Damn,” Jackson whispered in agreement before stepping back.</p><p>“Lunch is well over is there any reason you two aren’t in class?” The high arch of her brow made Jackson feel like he was two feet tall, “I didn’t think so. Go on.”</p><p>JB had been right. Professor Binns was mighty upset when Jackson came skidding into class a half hour late. As penance he was assigned an essay twice the length of the rest of the class. When the bell tolled to release them Jackson sat at his desk a few moments longer replaying that afternoon with a dopey smile on his face. </p><p> </p><p>The next two weeks had Jackson feeling like he was on cloud nine. Every morning at breakfast JB would wander over from the Hufflepuff table to the Gryffindor table and hold his hand where everyone and their owl could see it. The first day that JB had leaned over to kiss him goodbye in the middle of the great hall left him sitting dazed at the table feeling all kinds of soft while everyone around him laughed.</p><p>While the weather was still warm enough they decided to take their lunches outside under a large tree where they could spread out their food and share it with the ever growing army of cats that seemed to follow JB at all times. On weekends in particular, if Jackson wasn’t running drills with the Quidditch team, he and JB would take their homework down by the Black Lake and spend the day in the sun with each other.</p><p>On a particularly warm Saturday Jackson and JB sat in their normal spot with Jackson laying his head on JB’s lap as the older pet his hair with one hand and fed bits of ripped chicken to the orange cat - Pumpkin Spice - with the other.</p><p>“Does anyone ever get upset their cats like you?” Jackson stretched out a hand to wave at the Giant Squid that came up to inspect the army of felines along its shore. A long tentacle breached the top of the water to wave back before it sank back beneath the surface and the squid was gone. “I mean other than Bambam.”</p><p>“Nah. My first year there were some issues but I’ve never really paid attention to people so by the time I realized people were upset they were already over it,” JB picked up more chicken to feed Jasmine who had resumed her spot on Jackson’s stomach. “I think Bambam is only pissed off that they like me more,” JB’s face was smug.</p><p>“He is rather prickly on the subject of cats,” Jackson chuckled. “Yugyeom keeps saying that he should focus on the fact that his cats like him and not you.”</p><p>“I figured the sphinx was his when she about took my eyes out,” JB pouted making Jackson laugh delightedly. “Even Mrs. Norris likes me.”</p><p>“You’re the cat whisperer,” Jackson reached up to pull JB down for a kiss. “I’m still calling you Mothman though,” JB rolled his eyes but grinned. “Thanks for adopting me too.”</p><p>“Thanks for liking me more than Bambam,” JB gazed down at him. Jackson gently lifted Jasmine off his stomach so he could roll over and crawled to straddle JB’s lap. “Still can’t believe the golden boy is interested in me.”</p><p>“Coming from the Cryptid who is infinitely more interesting than me,” Jackson carded his fingers through the black hair. “I had Madam Pomfrey run tests on me. Results came back clean but I have the parchment in my bag if you’re interested.”</p><p>“Funny I had the same idea,” JB ran his hands up the backs of the jean clad thighs. “Clean and parchment is in my bag.” Jackson contemplated it for a second before shrugging and settling himself down.</p><p>“I trust you,” Jackson whispered against his lips. JB gripped both hips tightly as Jackson ground against him.</p><p>“Jackson,” JB broke away from the kiss to mouth at the line of his neck and shoulder. “Are you my good boy?” Jackson felt himself flush crimson. “I noticed the last time I said it you turned a pretty shade of pink,” JB sounded smug. “So are you?” The moan that left Jackson’s mouth carried a small yes. “My good boy.” JB palmed the front of Jackson’s jeans getting another breathy moan. “You’re so sensitive,” the words were a soft coo and while it might have been an insult from anyone else, coming from JB they sounded like their own form of praise. Burying his head into JB’s neck Jackson rolled his hips into the warm palm. “God Jackson you’re so beautiful.”</p><p>“JB,” Jackson was so close and the man had barely touched him. Jackson might have been embarrassed if JB hadn’t kept moving his hand, murmuring praise.  </p><p>“Do you wanna cum baby?” JB turned to whisper the words directly into his ear, “out here in the open where everyone can see that you’re mine.” The hot rush of embarrassment flooded him making his whole body throb. “Can my good boy follow orders?” Jackson nodded his head frantically. “Let go for me baby.” Jackson gasped bucking up into the hand as he came, face flushing even redder. “Good boy Jackson,” JB kissed the exposed neck, “so good for me.”</p><p>***</p><p>After that day Jackson felt there was positively nothing that could bring him down. Not being paired with Yugyeom as punishment for not paying attention in class, not Binns lecturing him about the importance of being on time, not even Youngjae who laughed every time he saw Jackson with a dopey smile on his face. </p><p>Naturally it couldn’t last.</p><p>“Jackson,” JB chewed on the inside of his cheek and suddenly Jackson felt the world shifting a bit, “can we talk?”</p><p>“Are you going to break up with me?” Jackson held his breath already feeling the prick of tears.</p><p>“What? No!” JB looked startled, and Jackson nearly cried in relief. He did cry in relief, his whole body sagging as the tension bled out all at once. “C’mere,” Jackson wrapped his arms around JB trying to calm his racing heart. “I didn’t even think of how it sounded when I asked, I’m sorry.”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Jackson tightened his arms. “I’m a lot of emotional labor you would think I’d be used to the breakup talk.”</p><p>“Whoever said that is full of shit,” JB sounded angry for the first time since Jackson had met him. Usually the man just floated along letting things fall where they may. “I did want to talk to you though. About me.” Jackson pulled back wiping his eyes. “Would you be okay with an open kind of relationship?”</p><p>“A what?” Jackson frowned a bit. “Like dating other people?” </p><p>“Yeah,” JB motioned for them to sit on the bench against the wall. “We kinda...fell into this without talking a lot,” Jackson nodded his head. “It’s not that I’m bored of you or anything like that. It’s just, I’m po -”</p><p>“Polyamorous right?” Jackson leaned against the wall a relieved sigh escaping, “oh my god I thought this was going to be so much worse.” A small manic laugh bubbled up and he was unable to stop it from exploding out.</p><p>“You’re taking this much better than anyone I’ve ever dated,” JB was frowning as Jackson continued to laugh. “Why are you laughing?”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Jackson wheezed, “I’m just so relieved.” </p><p>“They’ve really done you dirty haven’t they,” JB sounded hurt. </p><p>“I’m high energy and most people can only stomach my neediness for a few weeks before they run away,” Jackson smiled even though the string of people that came to mind all felt like a punch to the gut. “I don’t care that you’re poly. Is there someone who’s caught your attention?”</p><p>“Not at the moment.” JB moved to kneel in front Jackson and cup his face, “I just wanted to be honest with you.” Jackson turned his head to kiss a palm. “I would still talk to you about it and you’re welcome to see other people also. It wouldn’t be a one way street.”</p><p>“I love you.” Jackson didn’t even think about the words. They fell out of their own accord but they were no less true and the revelation to himself created a new spark of joy. “Oh my god I love you so much,” JB starred up wide eyed. “You don’t have to say anything. I just wanted to be honest with you.” At the sound of his own words coming back JB pulled him down and kissed Jackson like the sky was falling.</p><p>“How the fuck are you even real?” JB kept their faces cradled close pressing small kisses onto his lips.</p><p>“Says Mothman,” Jackson giggled even as JB snorted at the name.</p><p>“This went worlds better than I thought it was going to,” JB’s whole body seemed to relax. “I figured you were about to break up with me.”</p><p>“I take it I’m not the only one of us whose been done dirty,” Jackson hadn’t really given much thought to that until now. How many people had trampled on JB’s heart that the Hufflepuff was skittish to talk about this? As it was, JB still hadn’t fully looked him in the eye. “Listen, as long as you talk to me and don’t just leave me hanging I’m okay with it.”</p><p>“Really?” JB let out a shaky breath but finally he smiled again. “You’re so good to me Jackson.”</p><p>“Of course I am. I’m your good boy remember?” Jackson pulled them both up off the floor, “Tea?”</p><p>Lacing their fingers together they both walked towards the kitchens trailing the hoard of cats behind them.</p>
