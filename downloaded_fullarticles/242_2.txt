    <p>The post boy arrived at the servants door at the back of the house during lunch. </p>
<p>"Hermione, take this to her ladyship.  Quick girl, its important."</p>
<p>Hermione dropped her spoon into her bowl, standing up suddenly from her seat at the kitchen table in the servants dinning room, and made her way over to Ms. McGonagall.  The older woman stood at the main door to the servants area.  She held the white envolope over to Hermione, shaking it alittle to encourage haste in the young girl.</p>
<p>"Yes Mam." She replied, taking the letter into her hands.  She couldnt help but glance down to the envelope to read the information.</p>
<p>'Lady Malfoy<br/>
Malfoy Manor'<br/>
Was written in a neat and delicate handwriting in the middle of the envelope.  Turning it over in her hand she glanced at the return address.  It was his.  His education address. Not that she even needed to see the return address to know who the letter was from. No,  she was very familiar with his written hand, the large initial curl of the 'M' in Malfoy and his usual long and delicate 'y'.  Over the years she had become accustomed to his letters.</p>
<p>It had in fact been a few years since she had arrived here but Hermione could still remember her first day at the Malfoy estate.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>She remembered meeting Ms. McGonagall in the villiage not long after her parents had passed away from a disease. She could remember clearly the feeling of hunger and the rumbles inside her belly, the longing for food of any substance and the cold weather as she sat by a path in the local village begging for a penny or two.  Her clothes hadnt been washed in so many days, her hair was a tangle of mess and she was covered in dirt from the soles of her shoes to her fingernails and up to her face and hair.  She remembred the feeling of being alone and afraid. </p>
<p>Sitting in the cold and damp she had been reaching out her hand and begging. Begging for any coin or any help from someone.  Coins and help didnt usually come, however one this particular day as Hermione raised her hand and pleaded the woman passing by for coins, she was quickly met by a harsh stare and stern words.</p>
<p>"My girl, if it is coin you want, you may indeed work for it."  The woman had many wrinkles to her face, her hazel eyes behind a small pair of glasses and salt and pepper hair pulled up into an updo which hid behind her very strange hat.</p>
<p>Never had anyone said much to the small dirty girl as she begged.  Hermion could only stare at the woman and nod dumbly.  She was so desperate for some money to buy food, just even a little to help the ache in her belly.  She couldnt say no to the woman.</p>
<p>The older woman motioned for the girl to follow her.</p>
<p>"Well come along then.  Where are your parents?"</p>
<p>At the mention of her parents Hermione's eyes began to water.</p>
<p>"They, they are no longer here Miss."  The girl dropped her head.</p>
<p>"Very well. Make hastse, I do need to get back and you look like you need some food in your belly."  The woman looked Hermione up and down, taking in the thin body, dirty old clothes and largely tangled mess that was her hair.</p>
<p>As they walked the woman broke Hermionie out of her thoughts. </p>
<p>"You will receive food and board, two pennies a week and the last sunday of every month off.  I am the housekeeper at the Malfoy estate, you may call me Ms McGonagall."</p>
<p>Hermione just nodded.  Anything was better than the void she had just lived in since her parents death. </p>
<p>It took almost an hour to walk to the estate and when Hermione seen it for the first time she just couldnt believe her eyes.  Never has she seen such as beautiful big building, the grand brick work, the bearutiful shade of colour in the bricks and even the view around the estate was incredible.  Despite being so hungry she still could appreciate the beauty all around her.  It was everything that her life was not. </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Hermionie made her way up the servants stairs which led to an empty coridoor.  She knew where the Lady of the house would be at this time of the day.  In the Parlor of course.  Making her way to the room in question she opened up the first door and stood in the eve before knocking on the second door. </p>
<p>She was met with a soft reply.</p>
<p>"Come in."</p>
