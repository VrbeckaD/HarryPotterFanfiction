    <p>Harry raced down the corridor. He couldn’t allow himself to be found by Draco. He wouldn’t.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was Saturday during their 8th year and the so called “Ice prince of Slytherin” had challenged him to a game of “hide and seek” (they don't want to call it that because they think it's childish) and the winner would pick a prize of their choosing. He immediately agreed without thinking about what he was getting himself into.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With a time limit of only 3 hours, he sped past the Great Hall towards the staircases, hoping they would lead him somewhere where the handsome, blond boy wouldn’t come across his path. Surprisingly, the stairs understood him and was soon led to a corridor he had never gone down before. Harry noticed that there was only one door, no paintings, at the end of the passage. He cast a quick lumos and silently crept towards the single entranceway. He managed to get in undetected and let out a sigh of relief. He thought Draco would have a hard time finding him so he pulled out his map.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good” Harry chanted as he tapped the middle of the parchment. As the ink flowed before him, Harry started to hunt for himself so he knew where he was. He laughed as he realized he was a couple corridors away from the dorm he had been assigned to share with Draco. He promptly shut his mouth when he saw that the pale boy was in the passageway that contained said dorm. It appeared that the castle was not on his side as he noticed that she was inevitably leading Draco closer and closer to his hiding spot.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco laughed. He thought Harry would want to play so he had made the stakes high on purpose. When he said anything, he meant anything. He shook his head and gave Harry a 10 minute head start.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As soon as those 10 minutes were over, Draco broke into a run, hoping he would find The Boy Who Lived before time was up. By the time Draco reached the moving staircases, he was praying he could encounter Harry before the clock stopped ticking. He didn't realize it but Hogwarts has listened to him and was controlling the staircases so he would be able to find the one that meant so much to him, for some reason.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco broke into a run as he realized he was close to their dorms. “Harry wouldn't be that stupid to hide in our dorm, would he?” The young boy wondered. He stepped into his dorm but little did he know the one that he was looking for was closer than he thought.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry let out a loose laugh as he realized how Draco didn’t know how close he was. He was surely going to win now. Draco would completely miss his corridor and end up at the other side of Hogwarts when time was up, 1 hour and 45 minutes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m going to sit back, relax, and watch Draco make a huge fool of himself.” Harry thought as he twirled his wand between his fingers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>BANG!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Shit!” Harry cursed as the sound came out of his wand. Draco was surely going to find him now.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Just as Draco was about to leave the dorm, he heard a loud bang! He instantly swiveled around, searching for the source. The blond boy noticed a secluded corridor not too far from where he thought the noise came from. He started creeping toward it, having a good feeling about what was about to come next. He might finally get what he wanted after all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Soon, Draco found himself in front of the only doorway in the whole passageway.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em> Alohomora </em> .” Draco recited, unsure of the room’s contents. He stepped in, casting <em> Lumos </em>since there were no sconces or torches. It didn’t seem like there was anything in the room but Draco could feel some sort of presence. It wouldn’t hurt to look right?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked around frantically for a hiding space when he heard Draco call out the opening charm. As the door started to open, he cast a silent disillusionment charm and hoped it worked so that Draco wouldn't bump into or notice him. Harry shoved himself into a corner and tried to hold his breath as Draco walked past him. The brunette got so distracted trying to keep himself away from Draco's line of sight that he didn't notice the silver-eyed Slytherin creep up beside him.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco laughed internally. He didn't think Harry was stupid enough to not cast the disillusionment charm properly or notice that he was tip-toeing towards him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, well, well,” Draco drawled, enjoying the look of surprise on Harry’s face,”it looks like I have won, and I say we should meet here 1 week from now, same time. Don’t be late.”</p>
