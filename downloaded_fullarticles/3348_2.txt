    <p>Harry James Potter and Juliette Lily Potter, twins, sit together in a small, wooden crib. Harry, older by six minutes, gurgles loudly and pats his sister’s face. Juliette, upset by this, smacks him as hard as a one-and-a-half-year-old can.</p><p>In the other room, Peter Pettigrew sits. Peter isn’t much, too scrawny and cowardly, but he <i>is</i> good with kids. Which is why, when the Potter parents head out to eat for the night, he’s the one asked to babysit. He goes through his regular duties with both children, killing time and shoving his guilt to the side.</p><p>A knock startles him from his thoughts and he forcibly shoves any misgivings out of his mind. He opens the door and scrambles into a low bow. “My Lord.”</p><p>The man, known only as Voldemort, sniffs in disdain. “Rise, Wormtail. You’ve done enough groveling for tonight.” Peter does as told and begins to lead Voldemort through the Potter household.</p><p>Up the stairs, past unmoving photographs of a smiling family, into a small bedroom.</p><p>Now, had Voldemort been a wiser man (maybe one not so broken as he), he may have noticed the chill he got from being in the room. May have acknowledged it as something other than the cold fall air and considered its origins may be more malevolent.</p><p>But, Voldemort is neither wise nor sane and, as any who have met him will say, his pride would never allow him to consider anything a threat.</p><p>He stares consideringly at both children. One, a bright-eyed and dark-haired child, stares him down in a way… unbefitting of one so young. The stare chills him more than the fall air and so he turns to the next child.</p><p>The opposite of her brother, Juliette is light-haired and dark-eyed and sobbing. </p><p>Voldemort has three options here. One, kill the boy with the unnerving (almost killing curse green) eyes. Two, kill the girls and stop the annoying, hiccuping sobs coming from her. Three, leave now and pretend the prophecy never happened.</p><p>Of course, in Voldemort’s eyes, there’s only one answer. So, he turns and points his wand at the boy. He hesitates for all of a second, wondering if he’s making the right choice (a part of him- some deeply buried part- screams that he’d never hurt a child and that he never should’ve stooped this low, but that part is quickly silenced by a sharp hiss from the actual body holding the wand). </p><p>“Avada Kedavra,” is said, almost reverently, by the Dark Lord. The spell hits its mark and he assumes his job is done. This is proven to be wrong when the light shoots itself towards its castor.</p><p>“Wait-” his cry is cut off by his own death- bright and painful and <i>burning</i>. </p><p>A hooded figure watches from a dark corner, smiles, and then disappears from view.</p>
