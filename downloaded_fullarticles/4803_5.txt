    <p>Dr. Rose Granger-Weasley was miserable.</p><p>She <em>hated</em> these high-society luncheons with the burning passion of a thousand suns. The only reason she was here was as a favor to her mother.<br/>
“So, there I was, staring evil down…” A soft blip interrupted Ron Weasley’s story. Everyone immediately turned to stare at Rose, and Hermione Granger sighed. “Rose…”<br/>
Rose stood. “Ah, an actual emergency. Apologies, everyone.”</p><p>Hermione held out her hand, and Rose handed over her phone.<br/>
“Who is Scorpius?” Hermione asked.<br/>
“Albus’ boyfriend. Panju described him as ‘cherubic’.” Mentioning Panju was a bit of a low blow, but Hermione handed her daughter’s phone back anyway.<br/>
Twenty or so minutes later, Rose dashed up the stairs to 221B Baker Street. “I got here as fast as I could!”</p><p>Albus was bathed completely in blood, and was standing on a bath mat in the middle of the room while Scorpius scrubbed at bloody footprints on the floor. There was a draft from the open, no, <em>broken</em> window.<br/>
“Hello, Rose.” Albus remarked miserably.<br/>
“Why are you covered in blood?” She demanded. “Never mind, the message was correct.”<br/>
Albus turned to Scorpius. “What did you say to her?”<br/>
“I said, do you have any way to get blood out of wood? And then I gave a smiley face, so it’s all alright.”<br/>
Albus nodded. “Good tactic.”</p><p>“Point blank asking that is not a good tactic.” Rose huffed. “How did this happen, anyway?”<br/>
“I thought you didn’t care.” Scorpius said.<br/>
“I changed my mind.”<br/>
Albus gave a long sigh. “Well, <em>first</em> Scorpius decided he was going to get a job, and I told him he didn’t need to, and he insisted, because apparently the chip-and-pin machine had refused him, and I told him to take my card and he said that wasn’t the point, then a man burst in and tried to force me to take the case and Scorpius threw a bucket of blood I had for experiments at him, and now we have no groceries and a looming conversation about my account.”</p><p>“Was the bit about me getting a job really necessary?” Scorpius asked, looking up from a particularly stubborn footprint.<br/>
“That’s the most important part!” Albus huffed.<br/>
“It’s not exactly <em>relevant</em>, though.”<br/>
“It most certainly is. Do you want to make something of it?” Albus asked excitedly.</p><p>Scorpius cocked his head. “What…?”<br/>
“Er… nothing.”<br/>
“Albus, it seems like you’ve been badly trying to rile me up recently…”<br/>
“What? Pssh, no. Not at all.” Albus did, however, lean forward.<br/>
“Cold water helps.” Rose said to Scorpius. “And cleaning fluid, maybe? Mrs. Figg might have something good.”<br/>
Scorpius snapped his fingers. “Thank you, Rose.” He then disappeared down the hall.</p><p>“Seriously though, what was all that about?” Rose asked.<br/>
Albus sighed. “That day a few weeks ago when Scorpius moved in… we ran into James and <em>his</em> brother. Scorpius’ brother made him so mad that he kissed me. It was quite enjoyable, actually.”<br/>
“Why not just say that you want to kiss him?” Rose asked.<br/>
“<em>What</em>?! Are you crazy?! I-I-I can’t…! That’s not how it’s done! Besides, he apologized profusely so it was an act of passion in the moment and thus he doesn’t think of me like…”</p><p>“Wow, you are terrible at this.” Rose said. “Wait, was that your first kiss?”<br/>
“No.” Albus huffed. “Of course not.”<br/>
Rose crossed her arms, smirking. “Then who was?”<br/>
Albus pinched the bridge of his nose. “If you <em>must</em> know, it was Allan Bradshaw.”<br/>
“I thought you hated him.”</p><p>“Our rivalry was based mostly in unresolved sexual tension.”<br/>
“You were <em>twelve</em>. What sexual tension?”<br/>
Albus rolled his eyes. “Never mind, you wouldn’t understand.”<br/>
Rose rolled hers as well. “Imagine that.”<br/>
Scorpius burst into the room with an enormous amount of cleaning supplies, mostly in a large plastic bucket. “I feel like a housewife from the 1950s.”</p><p>“We’ll just call you Mildred then.” Rose replied.<br/>
Scorpius made a face. “<em>No</em>. That name is <em>terrible</em>.”<br/>
“Dude, your name is <em>Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy</em>.” Rose snickered. “Mildred isn’t nearly so bad.”<br/>
“Hyp… how do you know his middle name?” Albus asked as Scorpius glared at Rose, then at the bloody footprints, muttering curses under his breath.</p><p>“Because I’m dating a cute girl in Human Resources. So you’re probably getting that job you applied for.”<br/>
Albus paled. “You already applied? To St. Bart’s?”<br/>
“Well, why not? I had my residency there, after all.” Scorpius smiled. “And I can’t say that I’ve ever had to clean up bloody footprints there. Now… I think you’re fairly dry, go shower. And burn those.”</p><p>“But I <em>like</em> these.”<br/>
“Well, they’re completely ruined, same with the bathmat. Come on, I don’t want to live surrounded by bio-waste. And Mrs. Figg draws the line at bodily fluids.”<br/>
Muttering darkly, Albus stepped off of the bathmat, which Scorpius tossed into the fireplace. “We will discuss this job business when I get out.” Albus said.<br/>
“Alright, looking forward to it.” Scorpius smiled.</p><p>Rose swore she saw Albus’ pupils dilate, before he hastened away.<br/>
“So, you and my cousin... basically I heard about the kiss.”<br/>
Scorpius flushed. “O-oh? You… did? From James, I guess?”<br/>
“No, from Albus.”<br/>
Scorpius turned away to stare at the floor. “I… my brother makes me quite emotional.”<br/>
“I mean, so do mine, but I’ve never kissed a girl because of Panju pissing me off.”</p><p>Scorpius’ ears began to turn red. “I lost control for a moment, and I am so sorry… I got carried away and—”<br/>
“Don’t <em>worry</em> about that. Worry about the fact that the son of an MI-6 operative has a major crush on you.”<br/>
“Who…?” Scorpius blinked owlishly.</p><p>“Albus.”<br/>
“Really? Wow. I had no idea that Albus had a parent in MI-6.”<br/>
“No one ever mentioned it? Wait, that’s not the important part.”<br/>
Scorpius blushed. “Diggory mentioned <em>MI-5 </em>once and Albus got mad… but you’re right, that’s not important. He likes me?”</p><p>Rose passed a hand over her eyes. “One of these days, I’m going to introduce you to Hugo, so he, Panju, and I can take it in shifts to help you two nerds woo each other.”<br/>
“Oh, I’m sure that you and Pryansh are very busy… who’s Hugo?”<br/>
Rose held up three fingers. “Child one: Panju. Or Pryansh, but it feels weird to call him that. Child two, with Mum this time: me. Child three, still with Mum: Hugo Richard Weasley. He’s about Lily’s age, she’s Albus’ sister, but Hugo works as an engineer in Leavesden. He comes down to London every once in a while.”</p><p>“Who does?” Albus reentered the conversation, wearing a dress shirt and slacks.<br/>
“Hugo.” Scorpius said as Rose squinted at Albus. “How did you get clean so quickly?”<br/>
“I don’t think he dried off.” Scorpius noted as Albus’ shirt began to cling to his body<br/>
“<em>Dude</em>, what the… why do I have to be here for your weird seduction attempts? Go put on another shirt and dry off, you look like a stripper.”<br/>
Albus and Scorpius both glared at her.</p><p>“I don’t think I need to.”<br/>
“It’s unseasonably warm today.” Scorpius said. “Water might help him cool off…”<br/>
“If it was so warm why did he take a flash-dip?” Rose asked, unimpressed.<br/>
Scorpius blushed again. “Well, I feel warm…”<br/>
Rose passed a hand over her eyes. “Dear God, at least go into the other room. I don’t even want to <em>think</em> what will go through Mrs. Figg’s head if she walks in and finds Scorpius on his hands and knees and Albus wearing a <em>very</em> transparent shirt <em>in the living room where anyone could see</em>.”</p><p>Scorpius blinked innocently. “Why would that be construed badly, Rose?”<br/>
“Right, maybe <em>you</em> are attributing meaning to it.” Albus snorted.<br/>
Rose pinched the bridge of her nose. “This looks like the beginning of a pornographic video, and <em>I</em> am the one who needs to back off?”<br/>
“Yes, get your mind out of the gutter.” Albus ordered, before Scorpius finally managed to get the bloodstains out. He then carried the bucket full of dirty water into the kitchen, and dumped it into the sink, before returning for the bottles of solution that he had poured into it and scurrying downstairs.</p><p>“Is your floor radioactive now?” Rose asked after counting just how many bottles he had.<br/>
“Don’t be ridiculous Rose, we now likely have the cleanest floor in all of London.” Albus huffed, collecting his laptop from the desk.<br/>
Rose looked the room over. “<em>Right</em>. Anyway, if my mum calls, please pretend that you were, or are, actually, dying.”<br/>
“Why?”<br/>
“Because I don’t want to return to high society.”</p><p>“Well, we’re busy. Penelope Nott sent me an email asking for help.”<br/>
Rose leaned over to look at the computer that Albus had retrieved. “Nott? Didn’t you hate… that’s not your computer background.”<br/>
Albus nodded. “Correct, it’s Scorpius’.”<br/>
“Did Nott email <em>him</em>?”</p><p>“No, she emailed <em>me</em>. Why would she email him?”<br/>
“I don’t know. For the same reason you can’t use your own computer?”<br/>
Albus frowned at her. “Don’t be ridiculous, Rose.”<br/>
“Is that my computer?” Scorpius asked as he returned.</p><p>“Mine was in the bedroom.” Albus replied.<br/>
“Are you poking around my emails? Please don’t. Hey, how did you guess my password anyway?”<br/>
“Trial and error, mostly. I got through most of the figures in Greek Mythology before coming to Atlas.”<br/>
“The keys are worn down, though.” Scorpius pointed out.<br/>
Albus tutted. “No, that’s not reliable. I’ve seen you—you type a lot. A and S are both relatively common keys. Also, clean this. You must have brought half the dust of Afghanistan into the flat via your computer screen.”</p><p>“What’s the significance of Atlas?” Rose asked.<br/>
“It’s my brother’s middle name.” Scorpius shrugged. “I haven’t gotten ‘round to changing it yet, I’ve had that computer for quite some time.”<br/>
Albus stilled at the mention of Orpheus, and Rose shot him a patented Look of ‘don’t you dare use this to your advantage’.</p><p>“This is… about Orpheus… but you have a bad relationship with him currently.”<br/>
“Yes, well, I’m not the most technologically advanced person… didn’t you say you had a case for us?”<br/>
Albus snapped out of his thoughts. “Yes. I do. Come, we’re going to the bank.”<br/>
Scorpius went to fetch his coat. “If this is about me getting a job—”<br/>
“I <em>told</em> you, you <em>have</em> a job; you’re my doctor/assistant.”<br/>
“That’s just a circle of money being rotated between us.”</p><p>And so they lightly squabbled all the way to Gringotts Bank of England.<br/>
“Gringotts? I have an account there.” Scorpius then looked at Albus warily. “Were you snooping through my personal information?”<br/>
Albus clicked his tongue in distaste. “I wouldn’t need to. I have no interest in where you have your money located, I can share my card with you so you don’t need… no, not that way.” Albus laced his fingers with Scorpius’, and led the other man up the escalator to the traders’ area.</p><p>“Albus Potter? I have an appointment.” He said to a receptionist.<br/>
“One moment please… yes, she’ll see you now.” The receptionist smiled. Albus did not let go of Scorpius, and Scorpius walked alongside him so as to not appear like a chastened toddler.<br/>
“By the way, I think it’s very sweet of you to bring your husband along.” The receptionist smiled.<br/>
“Oh, we’re not married.” Scorpius said quickly.<br/>
“Oh? Boyfriends then?”</p><p>“We live together.” Albus supplied. Scorpius nodded.<br/>
The receptionist did as well. “Ah, that’s sweet then. Go on in, she’s waiting for you.”<br/>
Albus still did not let go of Scorpius’ hand, but Scorpius held the door for him.<br/>
Penelope Nott was sitting at her desk, typing furiously. “Well, sit down.”</p><p>“This isn’t a proper greeting for an old friend.” Albus pointed out.<br/>
Penelope looked up. “We’re acq… oh, hello. Wasn’t expecting to see you here.”<br/>
“<em>You</em> emailed <em>me</em>.” Albus huffed, while Scorpius waved.<br/>
Penelope pointed a pen at Albus. “<em>Not</em> you. Scorpius, what are you doing here?”</p><p>“We’re together.” Scorpius replied.<br/>
Albus nearly choked, and Penelope frowned. “Scorpius, you can do <em>so</em> much better than Potter. I have some friends—”<br/>
“No, no, no, not like <em>that</em>.” Scorpius said hurriedly. “We’re flatmates.”<br/>
“Is <em>that</em> what they’re calling it now?”</p><p>“Not the point.” Albus snapped. “Unless you called us here so you and Scorpius could gossip about your baby and your lack of a husband.”<br/>
Penelope stood, clenching her teeth. “Potter, keep yourself out of my life. I don’t mind your <em>observations</em> most of the time, but bring my son into it and reveal very personal information that I was debating telling one of my oldest friends <em>myself</em>, and we’re going to have a problem.”<br/>
“Like I said Nott, <em>you</em> emailed <em>me</em>.”</p><p>“Okay, why don’t we all just calm down and noticeably not murder anyone?” Scorpius asked. “We can deal with Penny’s life later—let’s get down to business, yeah?”<br/>
“Fine. What are you willing to offer me?” Albus asked. Penelope pulled a check out of her pocket and handed it to him. Albus grasped it warily with two fingers, glancing at Scorpius as he read it. “See? You don’t need a job.”<br/>
Scorpius smiled exasperatedly. “Albus, no. I’m going back to work, and that’s final.”<br/>
Albus scoffed, then handed the check back to Penny. “I’ll take half, then. Money is of no concern to me.”</p><p>“No, it wouldn’t, being a <em>mortal</em> concern.” Penelope sneered, before turning to Scorpius. “Listen, tell Mrs. Bryerly, the receptionist, that I said you two could have the good cocoa if you want some.”<br/>
Scorpius lit up. “I know you’re just trying to get rid of me, but I rather <em>would</em>!”<br/>
As soon as he was gone, Penelope leaned back. “I can tell when people want something. Out with it.”<br/>
“Your charm must be the reason you’re not sequestered away in human relations.” Albus snorted. “I want that picture of Scorpius on your desk.”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll bite. How did you know it was a picture of him?”<br/>
“the same way I know your child is incredibly young—observation. With the picture, your eyes darted down to it for a split second when you noticed Scorpius. Since you are <em>old friends</em>, I can only assume it would be <em>of</em> him instead of <em>relating to</em> him, like a picture of Orpheus Malfoy would be. You know how I work.”<br/>
“I’m better at making deals, but yes, I do. And no, you most certainly cannot. You are being hired in a professional capacity by <em>Gringotts</em>, not by <em>me</em>. And you most certainly cannot indulge your weird obsession with him with my blessing.”</p><p>“It’s not weird!” Albus hissed. “No weirder than <em>your</em> obsession with your baby’s father!”<br/>
“Wh… have you two had <em>sex</em>?!”<br/>
“No, but we actually live together!”<br/>
“Your situation is completely different from mine! You’ve known him… what, three, four weeks? I knew Ces… I knew my baby’s father for years before we ever did <em>anything</em> romantic!”</p><p>“Oh, yes, you’ve been tragically following after him like a lost dog.” Albus rolled his eyes. “Wait, is this the same one that you liked so much during university?”<br/>
Penelope crossed her arms and glowered. “Honestly Potter, at the end of the day, I can’t hate you any more than I already do. But when you get bored and inevitably hurt Scorpius, that’s where I draw the line. Do you want the case or not? You said I know how you work, can’t you accept that I would know what kind of cases you should be summoned for?”</p><p>Albus stared her down with an air of an exceptionally proud bird. “I still want that picture.”<br/>
“You mentioned Orpheus, go bother him.” Penelope stood and opened the door, revealing Scorpius looking at the screen with the receptionist.<br/>
Scorpius straightened, and smiled. “Hey, all done? By the way Penny, your son is really very cute. Can I be his godfather?”<br/>
“You’re Catholic, I’m Protestant.”<br/>
Scorpius sighed while Albus tucked away that bit of information. “Pity, I thought he’d take after his father.” Penelope stiffened, while Scorpius brightened. “No matter, we’re always free to babysit.”</p><p>“What? No we aren’t.” Albus hissed as Penelope led them to the elevator. After a few minutes of listening to an instrumental version of the ‘Pina Colada Song’  they finally arrived at their destination.</p>
