    <p>Harry Potter:<br/>
You are usually the one comforting him after a nightmare. You just hold each other close and lay there in silence. There is no need for words. You both just want to know that the other is there to protect you.</p><p>Ron Weasley:<br/>
Lots of small sweet talk to ease each other out of it. When you wake up startled and sweating from the horrific visions in your head, he tries to remind you that hes there. Sometimes he lists his favorite things about you, and sometimes he starts reminiscing. He’s not sure what to say all the time, so sometimes he’s just babbling under his breath, but it makes you smile either way.</p><p>Fred Weasley:<br/>
He distracts you from your bad dream with laughter. He tickles you and jokes with you, trying to get you to crack a smile. He believes that your bright smile can chase away all the bad things that haunt you.</p><p>George Weasley:<br/>
Like Fred, he’ll be silly to try and get you to smile, but if he sees that you are really shaken, he’ll shower you with kisses and hold you in his arms. Maybe even care you to the bathroom and draw a warm bath for you, or go to the kitchen and make your favorite snack.</p><p>Neville:<br/>
He wants to talk you down. He’ll listen to every gruesome detail you can remember so that they can exit your mind. He doesn’t mind it transferring to him, he’ll gladly take on all the pain for you.</p>
