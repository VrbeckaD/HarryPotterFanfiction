  <em>June 1932</em>
</p>
<p>Newt wakes up to muffled crying. </p>
<p>Sitting up in bed, he looks around the dark room, and spots the clock, sighing. </p>
<p><em>Two am</em>, He thinks. <em>Back to scheduled programming.</em></p>
<p>He quietly slips out of bed, not wanting to wake up Tina. Looking at her, she seems to be sleeping soundly, but Newt knows that neither of them have slept soundly for a while now. </p>
<p>But, duty calls. So Newt slips out of the room and goes across the hall into another bedroom.</p>
<p>“Now now, little creature, we don't want to wake your mummy, do we?” Newt whispers, walking towards the crib in the room. </p>
<p>Newt looks into the crib and sees the scrunched up and crying face of his son. He reaches in and scoops up the infant (not even a month old yet), and starts to rock him in his arms. The child's eyes open, and upon seeing his father, quiets down.</p>
<p>Newt smiles. “Maxwell Phineus Scamander,” he says. “Did you know you're named after both of your grandfathers? Maxwell Goldstein and Phineus Scamander…”</p>
<p>He sighs. “I wish they could've met you.”</p>
<p>Max sniffs, still crying a bit, but somewhat placated in his father's arms.</p>
<p>“Did you wake up for no reason?” Newt asks, bouncing the child in his arms, a smile on his face. “You're not hungry are yo-” Newt’s face falls when he feels something <em>warm</em> on his arm. “Oh <em>Merlin’s beard</em>.” he mumbles, quickly moving the infant to the changing station in the room. </p>
<p>Newt quickly changes the infant, something he's still not completely used to, and breathes a sigh of relief when it's all finished.</p>
<p>“All of my years taking care of magical creatures, and you, my son, are the hardest to take care of by <em>far</em>.” </p>
<p>He picks Max up again, leaning him against his shoulder and walks back to the crib. He lowers a now dozing off Max back into it.</p>
<p>“At least I never had to change diapers on a Nundu,” Newt says, tucking his son back in. “But I wouldn't trade it for the world.”</p>
<p>Quietly slipping out of the room, Newt walks back to his own and quietly slips into that room. </p>
<p>Crawling into bed, he feels Tina stir next to him. </p>
<p>“...he alright?” she asks sleepily. </p>
<p>“Just needed a change,” Newt responds. “We should be good until the morning.”</p>
<p>Tina snorts, turning on her side to face Newt. “Knowing that boy, he'll wake us up again for no reason before dawn.”</p>
<p>Newt places a chaste kiss on Tina’s forehead. “Then let's sleep while we can.”</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>
  <em>November 1932</em>
</p>
<p>“Remember we're going to your mother's tonight for dinner,” Tina says as she and Newt make their rounds while Max takes a nap in the shed (with Dougal watching over him). </p>
<p>“Ah, yes. I forgot about that.” Newt turns to Tina after feeding the Occamies. “I'm assuming we have to go?”</p>
<p>Tina rolls her eyes, walking towards Newt, the Niffler in her arms. “<em>Yes</em>, Newt. Amelia would kill us if we didn't.” Tina catches the Niffler as he tries to go for her necklace. </p>
<p>Newt nods. “I just like being at home with you and Max,” he says. “And I've got to start finishing up the editing for the manuscript which means I'll be meeting with Mr. Worme… a <em>lot.</em>”</p>
<p>“Well, after the book is done you'll have more time at home,” Tina says, smiling. “And once he's old enough, we can take Max on our trips.” </p>
<p>Newt smiles. “And when you start back in the field, I can work from home.” </p>
<p>Tina smiles as well, her heart swelling with love for her husband. They had talked about that- what they'd do when Tina went back to work, that is. Newt knew that she would want to go back as soon as possible; staying at home was never something for her. </p>
<p>“Only if that's alright, Newt.”</p>
<p>“Tina,” Newt says, cupping her face in his hand, “of <em>course</em> it is. No one could ever keep you from your job, you know. And I'm not going to be the first to try.”</p>
<p>Tina laughs. “It won't be for a while, though. I still have to be home.” </p>
<p>“You- you're okay with this, right?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Having to stay at home all day… you don't mind- you don't regret this, do you?”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Tina says, moving both of her hands to take Newt’s hand still resting on her face. “Of course not. It- it's hard, I will admit. A little easier now after a few months, but it's something I'm still getting used to… taking care of Max, being at home all day- I never thought I'd be doing something like this, that I'd have a kid to take care of, but I don't regret it, Newt. At all. I love Max, so much. I don't think I'm quite cut out for it if I'm being honest… I just hope I've been doing alright.”</p>
<p>“You're doing a wonderful job, love,” Newt quickly says. He leans forward to kiss Tina. “I just want <em>you</em> to be happy- if there's anything, and I mean <em>anything</em> I need to do, tell me.”</p>
<p>“You're already doing so much,” Tina says. “Understanding that I want to go back to work when I'm able and supporting and understanding that- Newt, I couldn't ask for anything better.”</p>
<p>“Well, it's 1932,” Newt says, shrugging. “It shouldn't be uncommon for a husband to stay at home with kids and his wife to be at work.”</p>
<p>Tina laughs. “Yes, well, there are <em>plenty</em> of people who think otherwise.” She kisses Newt’s cheek. “I'm just lucky enough to have you.”</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>“So, is there a book release date yet?” Amelia asks Newt at the table. </p>
<p>The whole family is there- Theseus, Maggie, and Annie, Queenie and Jacob plus their brood in addition to Tina, Newt, and Max.</p>
<p>Newt nods, waiting to speak after chewing his food. “I think so, yes.”</p>
<p>“Finally!” Amelia exclaims, clapping her hands together. “Oh, that's great news!”</p>
<p>“Wasn't it supposed to be out almost a year ago?” Theseus asks Newt, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Er, yes, but there was… September last year,” Newt looks down, “which pushed some trips back and then I rescheduled a lot more when-” Now Newt looks at his son, sitting in between him and Tina (who had gone to the bathroom) in a highchair. Smiling, he finishes his sentence. “When we found out about Max.”</p>
<p>Newt looks back up at his family. “But now it should be released soon. Especially because Max is almost six months old now, so we're a little more flexible with things.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to have a book release party for when it comes out?” Queenie asks.</p>
<p>Newt grimaces. “I'd rather not…” </p>
<p>“Why not?” Amelia asks. </p>
<p>Newt shrugs. “It's the third edition- I doubt people would want to go to <em>another</em> release party for the same book, and things are busy as it is.”</p>
<p>“Oh, if you're too busy I could plan it, Newt!” Amelia says. </p>
<p>“Plan what?” Tina asks, walking back into the room. She takes Max out of his highchair, placing him on her lap when she sits back down. </p>
<p>“The book's release party,” Amelia says.</p>
<p>“Oh, no, Amelia, there's no need-” </p>
<p>“Of course there is! I'd be happy to throw a little get together- not as big as the previous ones if you don't want.”</p>
<p>Tina and Newt look at each other, sharing a conversation in one look.</p>
<p>“Well… if it's small,” Newt eventually says, looking back at his mother. </p>
<p>Amelia claps her hands together. “Lovely! Now, I'm going to go get dessert.” She gets up, and upon leaving the room, Newt groans.</p>
<p>“Oh, come on, Newt,” Theseus says. “Let her have this.”</p>
<p>Newt rubs his temples, his elbows on the table. “I know, it's just… <em>so much</em> has been happening I didn't want to think about more things.”</p>
<p>“Max still keeping you up?” Jacob asks.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, yeah,” Tina says. </p>
<p>“He'll settle into a better routine soon, don't worry,” Queenie says. </p>
<p>Tina looks down at the boy in her lap who, in turn, looks up at his mother, smiling and babbling. Tina kisses his head, smiling as well. </p>
<p>“Well, it's definitely a lot of work,” she says. “And Morrigan I miss being on active duty, but I think it's worth it.” </p>
<p>“You're welcome back whenever you're ready, Tina,” Theseus says. </p>
<p>“Thank you, Theseus.” Tina looks down. “I feel like I should come back sooner than I planned… things aren't looking so good.”</p>
<p>Everyone is silent, all knowing what's going on outside of Britain. The only sound comes from the soft babble of the two year old twins and Max. </p>
<p>•</p>
<p>That night as Newt and Tina get ready for bed, there's a quiet solemnity in the air. </p>
<p>It's only when Newt climbs into bed next to Tina that that feeling breaks as she puts her book down and leans into him.</p>
<p>“What if it gets worse?” she asks quietly.</p>
<p>“I- I honestly don't know, Tina.”</p>
<p>Tina sighs, shutting her eyes. “You're going to want to help, <em>I'm</em> going to want to help… Newt, what about Maxy?”</p>
<p>Newt moves his arm up and around Tina’s shoulders and starts to rub circles into her back.</p>
<p>“Well, I'm sure Queenie and Jacob would look after him.”</p>
<p>“But-” Tina chokes on her next words. “But what if- what if we don't come back?”</p>
<p>Newt kisses Tina’s head. “We will come back, love,” he says. It's silent for a bit except for the couple's breathing. </p>
<p>“And I'd be able to stay home and be a consultant if that's better,” Newt says, almost whispering. </p>
<p>Tina looks up at Newt, meeting his gaze. She stares at him for a bit, before shaking her head.</p>
<p>“This is all- all <em>balled up</em>!” She sits up, throwing her hands in the air.</p>
<p>“Tina-”</p>
<p>“We shouldn't have to go off and fight in the first place! All because of Grindelwald, and those- those Muggles! It's not fair, Newt! We have a <em>family</em>- we have a <em>future</em>! </p>
<p>“And if I were the one to leave to fight and you stayed, well… what would people think? That I'm not capable of taking care of our son? That I'm just thinking of myself, leaving you at home?” Tina can feel the hot tears streaming down her face.</p>
<p>“They sure as hell wouldn't think that about you if you were the one out on the front lines!” </p>
<p>Tina stops, breathing heavily. She looks at Newt, an almost pleading look on her face. </p>
<p>Reaching out, Newt runs his thumb across Tina’s cheek, wiping away some tears.</p>
<p>“Tina… I don't know if you realize this, but I'm a dunce at dueling spells- they would need <em>you</em> more than <em>me</em>.”</p>
<p>That at least gets a small, sad laugh out of Tina. Newt smiles. </p>
<p>“And who <em>cares</em> what others think about me staying home instead of you,” he continues. “We both know you wouldn't be thinking of only yourself, and you are <em>more than capable</em> of taking care of Max.”</p>
<p>“That doesn't stop the fact that it's going to happen.”</p>
<p>“Yes, well, as it looks now, it does seem like this is going to blow up into something very big… no, it's not fair. But if- <em>when</em> we go out to fight, we'll be doing it for other's futures; for Max’s future.”</p>
<p>Tina closes her eyes and holds onto Newt’s hand that's still on her face. She nods. </p>
<p>“You're- you're right.” Opening her eyes, Tina gives Newt a sad smile. “I just don't want him growing up in this world climate.”</p>
<p>Newt nods. “Yes, I don't either.”</p>
<p>Tina nods, biting her lip. “Was- was this a good idea?” </p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Raising a kid right now… it doesn't seem fair to Max. Was this a mistake? I love him <em>so much</em>, Newt, but I don't want him to <em>suffer</em>.” </p>
<p>Newt leans forward and kisses Tina’s forehead. “He won't,” he says. “We both love him so much, and we will make sure he won't suffer. I think- <em>Merlin,</em> Tina, Max is the best thing that's ever happened to me, besides meeting you.”</p>
<p>Tina snorts. “Sappy.”</p>
<p>“Maybe, but it's <em>true.</em>” Newt smiles. “I don't regret any of this. These past few years- they've been- they've been <em>great,</em> Tina. And now- now we have a kid! A <em>kid,</em> Tina!” </p>
<p>Newt smiles, almost laughing a little, which in turn causes Tina to laugh. She falls into Newt, their foreheads colliding and their arms around each other. </p>
<p>“Do <em>you</em> think it was a mistake?” Newt asks it so quietly, Tina almost doesn't hear him. </p>
<p>But she does, and she immediately shakes her head. “No,” she says, “not at all.”</p>
<p>She leans forward, connecting their mouths in a kiss. </p>
<p>As they're both laying down to go to sleep, though, a loud wail rings throughout the house.</p>
<p>Both groan. </p>
<p>“I got it,” Tina mumbles, rolling out of bed. </p>
<p>Newt hums in agreement, falling back down as she leaves the room. He's getting back into a comfortable position when he hears Tina yell.</p>
<p>“Mercy Lewis!”</p>
<p>Newt springs out of bed, going to the room across the hall.</p>
<p>“What's wro- oh.” Newt stands in the doorway, looking on at the scene in front of him.</p>
<p>Tina, with Max held out in front of her. Tina, with <em>throw up</em> on her night shirt. Newt tries to hold back a laugh, but still smiles.</p>
<p>Tina rolls her eyes at him. “This isn't funny, Newt,” she says. “Could you, I don't know, help me maybe?”</p>
<p>“Of course, love.” Still smiling, Newt walks into the room and takes Max from Tina. As he situates the child in his arms, Tina pulls out her wand and cleans off her night shirt.</p>
<p>“I think he's sick,” Newt says.</p>
<p>Tina raises an eyebrow at him. “You think?” </p>
<p>“Well, what do we do? I don't think the potions we have are the best for an infant.”</p>
<p>“Um, maybe Queenie would know? Or your mother?”</p>
<p>“It's nearly 11- they're probably sleeping by now.”</p>
<p>“Oy vey, you're right.” Tina starts pacing.</p>
<p>The couple's attention is suddenly drawn back to Max when he sneezes loudly and starts coughing. </p>
<p>“Well we have to do something!” Tina exclaims. </p>
<p>Newt snaps his fingers. “Oh! I have a recipe for a potion that works with young children. I could whip one up quickly.”</p>
<p>“How do you know a potion for young children?”</p>
<p>Newt blushes. “It, uh, it's also for Mooncalves.”</p>
<p>Tina just rolls her eyes and holds out her hands, a small smile on her face. “Well, go make it! I'll take Max.” </p>
<p>Newt nods, handing the child over. </p>
<p>It's not long before Newt is back with a small vial of potion.</p>
<p>“Okay, this should prevent a fever and make him feel a little better.” Newt gives the potion to Tina, who is still holding Max. </p>
<p>She opens it, and can tell by the smell that it's probably disgusting.</p>
<p>“Okay Maxy, this is probably going to taste very icky but it'll make you feel better,” Tina says, lifting the vial to the baby's mouth. </p>
<p>Max jerks back with a loud “BAH!” and starts crying the moment a drop of the potion touches his tongue. </p>
<p>“Oh, I know I know,” Tina says softly, bouncing him in her arms to try and calm him down. “Please drink the rest…”</p>
<p>Max’s crying subsides, and Tina brings the potion back to his mouth as he sniffs (from crying or being sick, neither Newt or Tina knows). </p>
<p>Eventually, Max finishes the potion, and his eyes immediately start to droop close. Tina gently puts him back in his crib. </p>
<p>When she doesn't move away from it, her hands still gripping the railing, Newt walks forward and snakes an arm around her waist. </p>
<p>“How about we go to bed?” he asks, leaning his chin on her shoulder. </p>
<p>Tina shakes her head. “I want to stay with him,” she whispers. </p>
<p>“He'll be alright, love,” Newt says. “We'll be able to hear him if he wakes up again.”</p>
<p>“But he's never been sick before.” She turns her head to look at Newt. “I- I want to make sure he's alright, Newt.” </p>
<p>Lifting his head up, Newt cups Tina’s cheek in his hand. </p>
<p>“Tina-”</p>
<p>“If- if it's not a cold, then… then I want to know.” Newt sees a tear escape Tina’s eye. “My- Queenie and I just thought my parents had a cold, or the flu, but, but-”</p>
<p>Oh. <em>Oh.</em> And suddenly, Newt understands. He pulls Tina into himself and hugs her tightly as she starts to cry. </p>
<p>“I can't lose him, Newt.” Tina whispers so quietly that Newt can barely hear it. </p>
<p>“We can move his crib into our room,” Newt suggests after they stand in silence for a bit. He feels Tina nod against him. </p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Waking up, Newt turns on his side to face Tina. Instead of being met face to face with her, though, he sees that she's asleep sitting up with her back on the headboard.</p>
<p>And Max in her arms. </p>
<p>Smiling to himself, Newt sits up next to her. He notices Max isn't actually asleep, but is happy in his mother's arms nonetheless. Seeing his father, the baby smiles and makes some unintelligible noises. </p>
<p>Tina, on the other hand, <em>is</em> asleep. Newt reaches forward and tucks a strand of hair behind her ear. At the same time, though, Max sneezes. </p>
<p>Tina's eyes flutter open, and seeing Newt smiling at her, she smiles as well. </p>
<p>“Good morning,” Newt says. </p>
<p>“Mmh. Morning.” Tina moves around in the bed, and seems to notice Max in her arms for the first time. “He sneezed,” she says. </p>
<p>Newt nods. “Another dose of that potion and he should be alright.” </p>
<p>Tina nods as well. “He was coughing and making noise during the night and I- I wanted to be closer to him… to make sure he's really okay.”</p>
<p>“There is nothing wrong with that, love,” Newt says. “As long as you slept alright- that doesn't seem like the most comfortable position.”</p>
<p>Tina shrugs. “I've had to sleep in worse conditions on long missions.” Max sneezes again, causing him to sniff and start crying. </p>
<p>“I'll get more of the potion ready,” Newt says, swinging his legs over the bed and getting up. He quickly kisses Tina on the temple before putting on slippers and leaving the room. </p>
<p>•</p>
<p>“Oh!” Tina exclaims at breakfast. </p>
<p>“Is everything alright?” Newt asks, his cup halfway to his mouth.</p>
<p>“I was supposed to go in for a briefing,” Tina says. “Even though I'm not going to be back for a little longer, Theseus was telling me that it would be helpful for me to still know what's going on.”</p>
<p>“What's stopping you from going?” </p>
<p>“One of us needs to stay home with Max,” Tina explains. “Especially now, just in case, because he's still kind of sick. And your mother has something today and Queenie said she's gonna be busy with the bakery.” Tina chews on her lip. “Newt, what should we do?”</p>
<p>“I can take care of him today, Tina, don't worry about it.”</p>
<p>“But the book, you need to be at the Ministry and don't you have a meeting in Diagon Alley-”</p>
<p>“I'll take him with me.” Newt shrugs. </p>
<p>Tina just stares ahead at Newt. “Is that- is that a good idea? Are you even <em>allowed</em> to?” </p>
<p>Newt shrugs again. “No idea.”</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>“And you're sure you have everything?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have the case set up just like his room.” </p>
<p>“Okay…”</p>
<p>“He'll be fine, Tina.” Newt kisses Tina quickly. “You have nothing to worry about.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know,” Tina says, shaking her head. “I just haven't really been away from him for a whole day before.” </p>
<p>“Well, I think we will survive, won't we?” Newt looks at Max in his arms. </p>
<p>“Mababada.” </p>
<p>“See? He agrees.” Newt smiles, looking back at Tina. </p>
<p>Tina leans forward to kiss Max’s head. He lets out a happy giggle at the contact.</p>
<p>“Be good today, okay?” Tina says. “You're going to some very important meetings with your father.”</p>
<p>Max makes some more unintelligible noises as Tina ruffles his hair. </p>
<p>“I'll see you later,” she says, turning her attention to Newt. She places a lingering kiss on his lips before stepping into the fireplace. </p>
<p>“I'll miss you, Maxy!” she says before throwing some powder down and saying her destination. She's engulfed in green flames, and is gone by the time the fireplace dies down.</p>
<p>Max just looks on at the now empty fireplace, a confused and scared expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Mumababa?” he asks, almost actually speaking. But Newt still understands- the baby has been saying syllables similar to “mummy” and “mama” for a while now.</p>
<p>“Mummy is fine, Maxy,” Newt says. Max looks up at his father, still looking worried. “She just had to go into work today.”</p>
<p>Max looks back at the fireplace, pouting. He hasn't been away from Tina for this long ever. </p>
<p>“We'll see mummy later, don't worry.” Newt sighs. “But for now, <em>we</em> have to go, too.”</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Newt walks through the Ministry, case in one hand, and the other hand (and arm) holding tightly onto Max. He nods at people he knows in recognition as he passes them, but other than that he's in somewhat of a hurry to get to his office. </p>
<p>Max buries his head into Newt’s neck as he walks through the halls fast. </p>
<p>“I know, Maxy. It is busy, isn't it? We're almost there, though.” He rubs his son's back as he approaches one of the elevators.<br/>
“Morning, Mr. Scamander,” the wizard operating the elevator says as he enters. “And Mr. Scamander,” he adds, nodding to the child in Newt’s arms. </p>
<p>Newt chuckles. “Good morning, Bellamy. He's a little overwhelmed this morning,” Newt says, nodding towards Max.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. Well, Beasts Department or MLE offices?” </p>
<p>“Beasts, please.” </p>
<p>Newt is soon walking towards his office, but as he passes the front desk, the secretary gets his attention. </p>
<p>“Mr. Scamander!” </p>
<p>Newt turns around, stopping. “Yes? Is everything alright?”</p>
<p>The secretary nods. “Yes- you got a letter, though.” </p>
<p>Newt takes the letter being held out to him. “Thank you, have a good day.” He continues to his office.</p>
<p>“Alright, Maxy. Let's get you situated.” Newt works quickly, transforming his office to be baby proof. Soon everything is in place, and Max is on his mat on the ground, playing with Pickett. </p>
<p>“Okay, this letter…” Newt looks at it and sees it's from Mr. Worme’s office. Confused, he opens it.</p>
<p>
  <em>Mr. Newt Scamander,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Our meeting today had to be rescheduled to 11; I hope that works out for you. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>My schedule has been filled, and I am very busy. (No doubt you are too.) Because of this, if you're not able to make the meeting, it would unfortunately be awhile until another can be scheduled.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>So sorry about the short notice,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Augustus Worme</em>
</p>
<p>Newt looks up from the letter and to the clock. </p>
<p>
  <em>10:45</em>
</p>
<p>“Merlin’s beard-” Newt shuffles around his desk quickly, knocking a few things over in the process of trying to get his stuff together. Max looks up at the commotion.</p>
<p>“There's been a change of plans,” Newt says, walking to the front of his desk. He picks up Max swiftly, causing the child to giggle. </p>
<p>“Pabada!” </p>
<p>“Yes, it's exciting, isn't it?” Newt hurries out of his office and back to the elevators. </p>
<p>Finally in the main lobby of the Ministry, Newt hurries through the throng of people, keeping Max close to him. He's soon at the exit that leads to the streets of London. </p>
<p>“Well, shall we go to Diagon Alley, little creature?”</p>
<p>“Daaag!” Max exclaims. </p>
<p>Newt chuckles. “I'll take that as a yes.”</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>After hurrying to the Leaky Cauldron and through the wall in the back, Newt finally makes it to the publishing house. </p>
<p>He runs in just as the clock strikes 11.</p>
<p>“I'm here to… to see Mr. Worme,” Newt says, trying to catch his breath. </p>
<p>“Yes, and you are Mr. Newt Scamander?” the witch at the desk asks.</p>
<p>Newt nods. “Yes indeed.”</p>
<p>The witch raises an eyebrow at Max. “And you're bringing a child to your meeting?”</p>
<p>“My son,” Newt says. “My wife had to go into work and he's been sick so we just wanted to keep an eye on him-”</p>
<p>“Mr. Scamander, usually other people aren't allowed in on meetings without further notice.”</p>
<p>“And usually I get further notice if my meeting time changes, but that doesn't always happen apparently.”</p>
<p>The witch looks taken aback as she presses her lips in a line. “Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Scamander, but I don't think we can allow-”</p>
<p>“Newton!” </p>
<p>A booming voice resonates throughout the room, and Newt, as well as the receptionist, look towards the source of the voice.</p>
<p>“Mr. Worme,” Newt says. </p>
<p>“I am so sorry about the quick timing change,” Worme says, walking further into the room. He notices Max in Newt’s arms. “And who is this?” he asks. </p>
<p>“My son, Max. Sorry, it's out of the blue, but I have to take care of him today-”</p>
<p>“I told Mr. Scamander our rules about bringing others to meetings,” the receptionist interjects. </p>
<p>Mr. Worme chuckles, shaking his head and looking at the witch. “I'm sure we can make an exception, Romilda.” He turns back to Newt. “Right this way, Newton.”</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>“Well we sure had a busy day, didn't we Maxy?” Newt asks his son as he starts dinner, Max sitting in a highchair near him. </p>
<p>“We'll definitely have a lot to tell your mummy about your big day,” he continues. </p>
<p>They then hear the fireplace roar to life, and Max’s head immediately turns to the source of the sound. </p>
<p>“Mmmma?” he asks. </p>
<p>“I do believe so,” Newt says, scooping up the child and going to the living room. </p>
<p>As the fireplace comes into view, so does a slightly disheveled (and not too happy looking) Tina. After brushing soot off of her clothes, she looks up and genuinely smiles, seeing Newt and Max. </p>
<p>“Hello,” she says. And Newt can tell just from that one word that she is exhausted and something is definitely not right. </p>
<p>“Hi,” he says in response, tilting his head a bit to silently ask <em>is everything alright?</em> Tina just gives him a lopsided smile, code for <em>later.</em></p>
<p>“Mamamaba!” Max exclaims, reaching out for Tina.</p>
<p>Really smiling again, Tina moves forward and takes her son into her arms.</p>
<p>“Hello little creature! You're almost speaking now! Just adding a few extra syllables, I'm afraid.”</p>
<p>“Bibibiba!” </p>
<p>Newt smiles, looking at Tina and Max. “I was just making dinner,” he says. “It should be ready soon, and then Max and I can tell you about our adventure today, can't we, Max?”</p>
<p>“Adadadaaa!” </p>
<p>Tina gives a warm smile at this. “That sounds lovely.” </p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Later that evening, Newt comes into the living room after having put Max to bed. He sees Tina reading on the couch, and sits down next to her. He immediately puts an arm around her and presses a kiss to her head, which she leans into. </p>
<p>“Mmh, he asleep?” Tina asks. </p>
<p>Newt nods. “Should be.” </p>
<p>They sit in a somewhat comfortable silence for a bit. </p>
<p>“Tina… is everything alright?” Newt asks. </p>
<p>Tina closes the book she had stopped reading already and puts it down. </p>
<p>“I- I don't know.” is her response. </p>
<p>“What happened in the meeting?”</p>
<p>“It was mostly briefing about everything, but then they were talking about how there's a shortage of experienced Aurors right now.” Tina looks at Newt. “Theseus pulled me aside and asked me to come back earlier than originally planned.” </p>
<p>Newt at first doesn't know what to say, but then he nods. “Are you?”</p>
<p>Tina diverts her eyes towards the ground and responds with a small nod. “I- I have to, Newt.” She looks back up at him. “Are you alright with that?”</p>
<p>“<em>Merlin</em>, Tina, of course I am,” Newt says. “I would <em>never</em> stop you from going back… I’m just worried about <em>you.</em> I want to make sure <em>you're</em> alright with it and not just going back because of being guilt tripped or anything.”</p>
<p>Tina shakes her head. “There was nothing like that,” she says. “Theseus said I didn't have to- and I wouldn't just yet if it weren't for things seeming to heat up. All he said was by the New Year it would be beneficial for me to be back. So there's still Hanukkah and Christmas, and then I'll be back at work.” </p>
<p>Tina chews on her lip. “I'm just worried that I shouldn't leave Max yet. I don't know if he still <em>needs</em> me to be around.”</p>
<p>“Well, he did miss you today, but other than that he did pretty well.”</p>
<p>Tina nods. “So going back to work wouldn't… wouldn't make me-” Tina sighs. “I'm not a bad mother if I go back to work, right?”</p>
<p>“Oh Tina, of course not.” Newt cups Tina’s face in his hand. “You are a <em>wonderful</em> mother, and going back to work wouldn't change that at all.”</p>
<p>Tina nods. “Yeah I just… I don't know… I worry.” </p>
<p>“I know, love. But there's nothing to be worried about.” Newt leans forward and kisses Tina. </p>
<p>Tina smiles into the kiss, which turns into something a little more heated. The couple eventually ends up lying <strike>next to</strike> on top of each other and pressing soft kisses into each other's neck and face. </p>
<p>“So, your meeting was good?” Tina asks eventually. </p>
<p>“Mmhm,” Newt says, nodding. “Just a few more revisions and then it should go into print in February at the latest.”</p>
<p>“That's great, Newt!” Tina exclaims. “And… you're okay staying home with Max?”</p>
<p>“Of course I am, love. I won't have much to do, anyway, except… plan more trips.” His statement is more of a question.</p>
<p>Tina smiles, leaning into her husband. “Hmm, I think more trips sounds wonderful.”</p>
