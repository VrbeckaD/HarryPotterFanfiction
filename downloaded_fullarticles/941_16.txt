    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Murray of twenty two Seaside Drive were not at all normal and had no idea that this was the case. Everyone expected that they were involved in something very strange and mysterious and people in the neighborhood gave them very strange looks each time they passed by. Mr. and Mrs. Murray were entirely unaware that people saw them this way. </p><p>Mr Murray was the owner of a company that made typewriters. In his day he had been very wealthy but as typewriters were no longer selling so well, his once wealthy estate was nearly impoverished. Mr Murray was a lean and tall older man with graying hair. Mrs Murray was half his age and beautiful with nut brown hair. She had long delicate fingers which she used to make the most unique and original halloween decorations anyone had ever seen and hung them for display all over their grounds. The Murrays had one daughter called Ella and in their opinion she was quite ordinary though they agreed that she was alright as far as daughters went. </p><p>The Murrays no longer had everything they wanted. They were living off of savings from years ago and worse than that, they were keeping secrets. Mr. and Mrs. Murray were keeping secrets from each other and from their daughter and their daughter kept secrets from them. They all feared that they would somehow reveal their secrets to each other. Mr Murray didn’t want his wife or daughter to know that he had come from a special family but that he himself did not share their special abilities. Mrs. Murray didn’t want Mr Murray or Ella to know that she’d had the most unusual childhood and had special abilities of her own. And Ella didn’t want her parents to know that sometimes she wasn’t herself at all. </p><p>When Mr and Mrs Murray woke up that sunny Monday morning the day our story starts, there was nothing about the lovely weather to suggest that all of their secrets were about to be exposed. Mr Murray drank his tea in usual stoic silence and Mrs Murray continued her knitting of yet another ghost doll. Mrs Murray worked on her project happily content that Ella was still asleep in her bed. </p><p> Neither of them noticed the small red fox that scurried past the kitchen window. </p><p>At half past nine Mr. Murray got to his feet to head off to the manor library. He did not kiss his wife goodbye or even speak a word to her. Such affection was not the manner of their relationship. He did not stop by Ella’s room to say good morning. He went straight for the library and took his favorite chair in the window. </p><p>A half an hour passed before Mr.  Murray noticed anything was amiss. In the distance a small red fox ran across the open field. Mr Murray put down his book momentarily to watch the creature duck for cover under a tree. He resumed his book. The sound of hounds distracted him long enough to look up and see horses and riders in red coats rushing across the neighbor’s estate. He despised fox hunts. The abominable practice shouldn’t be legal. Even so there was little he could do to stop it and so he resumed his book. </p><p>It wasn’t until the fox left the shelter beneath the tree and ran straight towards his own manor that Mr Murray realized something was truly amiss. A fox shouldn’t be seeking a human residence as shelter. He set the book aside and got to his feet, leaning on the window sill to watch, a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. </p><p>“Jeremiah?” His wife’s voice in the doorway of the library interrupted his agony at the scene before him. </p><p>“Later Sophia,” he waved her aside without even looking at her. “Something is wrong out there.” </p><p>“Something is wrong in here!” she replied, anger and worry in her tone. It was unlike Sophie to have strong emotional reactions to anything. “Ella isn’t in her bed.” </p><p>“What?” Jeremiah gripped his cane as he turned to face his wife. Sophia’s face was pale and panic stricken. He had never seen her afraid before. “I know where she is,” he said, barely able to hold his own weight enough to remain standing due to the great horror he felt. </p><p>“Where is she?” Sophie asked, confused and worried. </p><p>“Out there…” he said, gazing at the little fox who ran for its life towards their manor.</p><p>“What do you mean, she’s out there?” Sophie didn’t understand and didn’t believe him. </p><p>Jeremiah didn’t have time to explain it to her. He made his way to the side door of the house as fast as his weary legs and cane could bring him there. </p><p>“Where is she? What did you mean she’s out there?” Sophia called after him as she followed him out the door. </p><p>The horses had stopped in the distance, their riders knowing better than to cross onto his land but the hounds were not yet reined in. The little fox was still three hundred yards away with a number of hounds close on her tail. She was terrified and Jeremiah didn’t wait fer her to come to him. He headed off into the field in her direction. </p><p>“Where are you going Jeremiah? Where is our daughter?” </p><p>He couldn’t answer her. She would never believe it even if he did explain it. No one would unless they had been raised as he had, unless they had seen the things that he had seen. All he could do was try to save her and if he could do that, he could show her the truth for himself. Anything less was a lost cause. </p><p>Jeremiah met the fox in the field as she fled the hounds. As he expected the poor creature jumped right into his arms. He shouted at the hounds to back off and being well trained beasts they did and turned and ran back to their masters. He carried the frightened fox back to his wife who stood watching the whole affair with her arms crossed. </p><p>“What is the meaning of this?” Sophia asked. “Where is Ella?” </p><p>“This,” he said placing the fox on the ground, “Is Ella.” </p><p>Sophie was about to argue with him but stopped when the fox began to change form. She changed from being a fox into the form of a three year old human girl with freckles and nut brown hair. </p><p>“I don’t expect you to believe in such things, but a long time ago I was cursed,” Jeremiah explained. “A blood curse. I and all my children can take the form of a fox and someday we will not be able to become human again.” </p><p>Sophie looked to be both angered and shocked. “Obviously I have to believe it. I just saw it with my own eyes.” She picked up the child from the ground and hugged her. “Why would you keep this from me?” </p><p>“For the same reason you keep your secrets from me. I know you have them, I just don’t know what they are.” </p><p>“Nor will you,” Sophie said, and she spun on her heel and carried Sophie back into the manor. </p><p>***</p><p>Nearly nine years had passed since the day when Jeremiah Murray had revealed that he was cursed. The Murrays did not talk about that day. They did not talk about the changes that two of them were able to undergo. They did not about the secrets that Mrs Murray held and they did not talk about the curse. The Murray Manor had hardly changed at all. It was still a large stately two hundred year old house decorated with various ghosts and ghouls year round. Only the addition of numerous more ghastly decoration showed how much time had truly passed. </p><p>The only other changes in the house were in Ella’s room. The room no longer held baby toys but instead held books, bright colored clothes, and an easy bake oven packed away in her closet somewhere. Ella loved to read fanciful tales as much as she loved to wear happy colors and more than that she loved to bake. </p><p>“Wake up Ella,” her mother opened the curtains and let the sunlight stream in. “It’s time for school.” </p><p>Ella let out a groan. “Do I have to go to school?” </p><p>“Yes,” her mother said simply. “I won’t have you grow up to be stupid.” It was the same answer she always gave and she left Ella to let her get dressed. </p><p>“Yeah, but you don’t care if I grow up to be weird,” Ella muttered as she threw back the covers and got out of bed. </p><p>Ella went downstairs for breakfast with her parents in the big formal dining room. Her father drank a cup of tea with his toast and scrambled eggs while mother had orange juice and oatmeal. Ella sat at the far end of the overly large table to her own plate with a muffin, yogurt, and two slices of bacon. It felt so empty to her in the huge dining room. The table had space to seat sixteen people and her parents never had guests. She wasn’t sure her parents had any friends to be guests anyway. They certainly weren’t friends with each other. They always spoke so formally and politely that Ella knew it wasn’t genuine. There was no love. Not like in the movies. </p><p>“I had the strangest dream last night,” Ella spoke up from her side of the room, making another attempt to fill the unending silence of her home.  “I was out in this field and there was this bird. It was so fast and I ran to get a better look at it and-” </p><p>“That was not a dream,” her father cut short her words. “Sometimes such incidents seem like dreams but they are not. We are not to speak of that, remember?” </p><p>Ella felt herself grow red with embarrassment. She hadn’t realized that her dream wasn’t truly a dream. Sometimes it was difficult to tell the difference. Mother was picking at her oatmeal with her spoon, Ella looked down at her food. She had disappointed her parents yet again. They didn’t want her to talk about how she was different and yet they were the strangest people in the whole neighborhood. The Murrays were freaks. Ella hated her life and hated the idea of returning to school and being reminded of it over and over again. </p><p>Ella grabbed her school bag and shouldered it over her dark green school uniform. She wished she could wear her favorite yellow shirt and floral leggings but that wasn’t going to happen. </p><p>From the moment she arrived on the school grounds the trouble began. Ella was minding her own business walking to class when Fiona and Hilary wandered by and muttered, “Freak.” </p><p>Ella ignored them. She always ignored them. When they called her a freak, she said nothing. When they scattered away from “Haunted Girl” everytime she approached and they pretended to be afraid of her before breaking out laughing, she pretended it didn’t bother her. When they made excuses not to be partnered with her in projects and they stole her books and made a point of spilling lunches on her homework, she once again did nothing. It wasn’t that she wasn’t angry or that she was too much a coward to fight back. It was simply that they were right. She was a freak. Her house did look haunted. Why fight the truth? </p><p>On this day when Fiona and Hilary called her a freak, something happened, something she hadn’t expected. The water bottles that the two bullies carried suddenly exploded, shooting water into both of their faces. Ella stopped short at the sight of the screaming girls, their hair now a mess, their faces wet. She had no idea how this had happened but it had to be a coinicidence, didn’t it? </p><p>The day wore on and before it was over Fiona and Hilary slipped up behind Ella and poured a carton of milk over her head. By the time she got home she her eyes were red rimmed from crying and her clothes and hair smelled of sour milk. </p><p>As Ella came through the front door she found a pile of mail on the welcome mat. She picked it up to bring to her father in the library and slowly rifled through the letters as she walked and stopped when she saw that one of the letters was addressed to her. She never got mail. This was certainly odd. Ella set the stack of mail aside on a nearby table in the hall and began to open her own letter. </p><p>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</p><p>Headmistress Minerva McGonagall</p><p>Dear Ms Murray, We are pleased to inform you that you are accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. </p><p>Ella scanned through the rest of the letter detailing the dates and supplies. She read it three times. There couldn’t really be a school for Wizards could there? But then, she shouldn’t be able to have such strange dreams. And the thing with the water at school today, what had that been? </p><p>Her father emerged from the library and crossed to her slowly. He was becoming more feeble in his own age. “What’s in the mail?” he asked as he reached her. </p><p>“I got this,” she passed it to him, confused as ever. </p><p>Her father looked over the fancy letter with it’s thick paper and perfect manuscript. “So it came,” he said with a sigh. “I always wanted one of these.” </p><p>“What is it?” </p><p>“What is what?” her mother said, on her way out of the dining room. </p><p>Jeremiah passed the letter to Sophia. She grew pale and silent on reading it. “Jeremiah, there’s something I have to tell you.”</p>
