    <p>Harry slowly walks through the corridor making his way towards a hidden passage heading towards the tower. Harry was exhausted from quidditch practice after Oliver decided to push Harry really hard while letting the rest of the team have the afternoon off. As he walks along, Harry doesn’t realize he’s been steered away from the passage into one of the castles unused wings, until a mysterious warmth brushes Harry’s left side. Curious, Harry swivels and follows the warmth into one of the seemingly abandoned classrooms. Enveloped by the glowing warmth, Harry doesn't notice the door glow as it starts swinging shut. The door softly closes, gleaming brighter as an unseen ward is activated trapping Harry in the room. </p>
<p>The room looks like a cosy hideout furnished with maroon armchairs and a few desks scattered the abandoned classroom. Around the room bookshelves are seen pressed against the walls, with papers strewn across different surfaces of the room. A full bed pushed into the far end of the room with bed tables on both sides, the bed has black covers with maroon pillows. With a few low lamps around the edges of the classroom, there are many shadows scattered around that prevent certain parts of the room from being seen.</p>
<p>While Harry is surrounded by the enchanting warmth he doesn't register the two figures slowly encircling him, looking over his tired and tense body like predators. The enchanting warmth slowly starts to fade away making Harry blink as he notices the figures in front of him. "Fred? George?" Harry states puzzled as he looks around the unfamiliar room, "Where are we?" George and Fred grin in sync "Why, dear Harry-" The first twin begins, " we've decided that since you've been working so hard these last few week-." The other continues. "you deserve sometime to relax and enjoy yourself." Both twins finish. Harry stares at the twins for a moment, "How do you propose I do that?" he asks confused. </p>
<p>"Well, we've recently come across a few items-" One of them begins, "that might be a pleasant experience for you!~" The other finishes with a sweet tone. "Such as....?" Harry trails off. "First off we have this potion to help calm your mind down as we can tell that it's just racing." The twins speak in unison, one of them holding a murky gray filled vial. Harry nods his head while looking at the potion, thinking about how much his mind has been trailing away from the task on hand. Harry tilts his head staring at the twin closest to him "What else do you plan on giving me?" The twin purses his lips together, "You'll just have to take this potion first. Then we'll move onto the next item, okay?" Finally willing to give into the feeling of relaxation, Harry takes the phial from the twins and quickly brings it his lips swallowing the liquid as fast as he can. Blanching at the quirky taste Harry suddenly feels a little far away almost as if he's floating as he leans on the twins a little bit. The twins slowly help Harry sit down on one of the plush armchairs, while grinning at each other ready for the next phase of their plan.</p>
