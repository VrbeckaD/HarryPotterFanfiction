    <p>The gentle rocking of the train car had done its job on her companions. The other students in her compartment were fast asleep and Elizabeth was alone with her thoughts as she looked at the letter that she had read over and over again.</p><p>She sniffled as a tear ran down her cheek and she hurried to stop it from falling onto the parchment. A quick wipe of her hand and the offending moisture never managed to join others that had already managed to get past her defenses. Albus had made good on part of the promises that he had made to her at the end of the last term. He had written, just not in the frequency that he had promised, and she had looked forward to the arrival of his owl to drop off his correspondence before taking her return letter back to him. She missed him terribly, even though they had seen each other several times, the most recent being at Diagon Alley when he had joined Lily and their parents to buy school supplies for the coming term.</p><p>Elizabeth had known that this would come, that she would make this trip to Hogwarts and that she would do it without the company of her closest friends. This term would be much different than the ones before it as both Albus and Rose had finished their studies and had moved on with their lives. It seemed strange not to see them on board the train while the boy that she loved told horrible jokes about Malfoy and the other Slytherin. Nothing that would get him into trouble, but enough that it would have irritated the members of that House had they overheard the jokes that they were the butt of.</p><p>She missed him terribly, even though they had seen each other several times, the most recent being at Diagon Alley when he had joined Lily and their parents to buy school supplies for the coming term. One dreadful difference on the alley had been the change in proprietorship of Ollivander’s. Garrick Ollivander, the wizard who had sold countless wands to countless witches and wizards, had died over the summer and now a family member ran the shop. The wizard lacked the humor of the older man as well as his knowledge of wand lore and many customers left the shop wondering if they truly had been chosen by the correct wand.</p><p>Elizabeth didn’t need to worry about this, however, and she ran her fingers over the reassuring hardness of the wand that lay in her robes. She didn’t believe that she would need it on the ride to school but it never hurt to have it handy. The young witch thought with pleasure about the hours that she had spent that day talking to Albus as they walked hand in hand and exchanged kisses. It was quite obvious to the witch that ran the shop which sold components for potions that no love potion was needed for these two young people; they had already found their love.</p><p>As she thought about her missing friends she realized how much time had passed since she had been forced to leave Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. It seemed as though it had been only yesterday that she had gotten onto the Hogwarts Express as a frightened second year. It hadn’t been the trip that had bothered her but instead the fear of beginning her studies at Hogwarts after the disgrace at her previous school.</p><p>She had met Rose and Lily, who had swiftly moved to comfort her fears and made her feel at ease. It had also been Rose who had dealt with Scorpius Malfoy when the pale boy had started to antagonize Elizabeth. A quick jab to the nose and a foot to the backside had sent the Slytherin boy on his way. After that she had been able to summon the courage to deal with Scorpius herself, and had done so on many occasions.</p><p>Scorpius Malfoy, the one that her father had, at one time, wanted her to marry. She could remember many arguments with her parent about her disdain for the boy and his family. The time that she had spent going to school with him had been tumultuous to say the least and the boy had been involved in many plots against her, several of which had nearly gotten him permanently expelled from the school.</p><p>The train jostled just a bit which made her glance up at the clock and her eyes widened as she realized that she was five minutes late in starting her rounds. Elizabeth looked down once again at the Prefect’s badge that was pinned to her robes. Lily had stepped aside and allowed her friend to resume her duties after the truth about Elizabeth’s troubles last term had come to light.</p><p>She could still see Lily’s face as her best friend had removed the badge from her own robes before pinning it to the robes of another. Elizabeth knew that it had to have been bittersweet emotions that were coursing through Lily at that moment and would not have been bothered had Lily decided to keep the badge. In fact, she had argued strenuously for Lily to do just that but the other girl had insisted.</p><p>The passage of the new Prefect for Ravenclaw reminded her that her rounds had begun and she rose reluctantly from her seat, but not before reaching down to caress Tiger. The cat slept through the affection and she remembered to close the door to the compartment behind her to contain him. He was making the trip with her once again, as he had since her first trip to Hogwarts, and she was grateful for this bit of normalcy.</p><p>It was not long before she was nearing the door which would take her to the car which housed the members of Slytherin House. She knew that that car was always unpredictable and needed a firm hand to bring to rein. A brief smiled crossed her face as she remembered here the term before this one.</p><p>Scorpius, incensed by her presence in the car belonging to Slytherin, had challenged her to a duel and had ended up paralyzed for the remainder of the trip. The boy had remained in that state until Elizabeth released him and had spent a bit of time with a nose that was painful from landing face first on the floor.</p><p>There was no chance of that this term, however. After being disciplined at the end of the last term for his part in a plot which could have led to the death of another student the boy had decided not to return to school. He had, or so he had so vehemently stated, learned enough that there was no need to come back. He could learn anything that he needed to from his father or grandparents. Elizabeth actually felt very sorry for him as she knew that he had to be grieving for his mother.</p><p><em>‘Dragon Pox, I pray that no one that I know or love ever has to deal with it,’</em> she thought to herself.</p><p>She opened the door to the Slytherin car and found that not much had changed here. Venomous stares greeted her, but they paled in comparison to the greeting presented by Scorpius’ cousin Alexis, who rushed forward to block the progress of the older girl.</p><p>“What you doing here, Blackwell? Did the mighty Gryffindor lose her way and wander some place where she knows that she’s not welcome?”</p><p>“Alexis,” Elizabeth began after taking a deep breath, you’re very fortunate that I’m not in a bad mood. Otherwise, if I were, Slytherin might start the new term with a deficit in points again. As it is, I’m just doing my rounds and have no desire to debate with you.”</p><p>“So, you’re afraid that you would lose if we did, aren’t you?”</p><p>The smaller girl fluffed up a bit as she stretched to her full height in an attempt to intimidate Elizabeth. The attempt wasn’t successful and the mood didn’t last long when Elizabeth responded.</p><p>“No, Alexis, that’s not it at all. I just feel that debating with you would be rather like dropping this train on a Flobber Worm, a lot of overkill for not a lot of satisfaction. You haven’t learned yet that if only you would think before opening your mouth people might consider what you have to say valuable. As it is all that you can manage is a lot of bluster!”</p><p>Alexis felt her jaw drop as the insult that she had been dealt brought gasps from the other Slytherin who had gathered around them to watch. The girl, uncertain about what to say next, suddenly drew more attention to herself by reaching into her robes where her searching fingers found her wand. This did not go unnoticed by the other Slytherin or Elizabeth, who suddenly cleared her throat before speaking again.</p><p>“Are you really sure that you want to do that? I really don’t want to not only beat you in a duel, but also have you expelled permanently for attacking a Prefect. Alexis, I really wish that we could just get along because this doesn’t do either of us any good. Can’t we just forget about this arguing and just go to school without conflict?”</p><p>The comment brought more gasps from the gathered students as they watched the confrontation. None of them had ever expected this sort of response from the Prefect that many of them had had harsh dealings with in the past.</p><p>For her part, Alexis wasn’t certain just how to respond to what had just been said to her. Thoughts ran through her mind as her hand withdrew from her robes and she nodded numbly. Elizabeth smiled at the progress and then turned to leave the car while the students within it gaped in astonishment at what had just occurred in front of them.</p><p>Elizabeth made another stop just after leaving the car to buy a treat from the trolley pushed by the ancient witch. She chewed happily on the Licorice Wand while making her way towards the car occupied by Hufflepuff students. As she opened the door to the car her ears were assailed by enthusiastic shouts of encouragement.</p><p>The crowd gathered around the door to a compartment offered a clue to the location of the disturbance. She pushed her way through the crowd, ignoring the initial glares of irritation what changed to fear when it was realized that another Prefect had arrived on the scene to deal with what was transpiring. A younger Prefect had been attempting to break up the disagreement vocally and having little luck with it. She backed away when she recognized the older girl and stood meekly while the situation progressed.</p><p>The sixth year Prefect stepped forward into the compartment while the spectators scattered in the hope that she hadn’t gotten a good enough look at them to identify them. While they may have escaped the pair of first year boys who were fighting on the floor was not so fortunate. She reached down to seize the arm of the boy on top and pull him away from the other boy only to have him round on her in anger. He was about to lash out at her when he noticed the badge on her robes. Immediately the fight went out of both he and his fellow combatant and they were silent as she addressed them.</p><p>“This is not the sort of behavior that we permit or tolerate at Hogwarts or here on the Hogwarts Express. I don’t care who started it, I don’t care what started it but once you have been sorted your House will lose twenty points which means that they begin the term with a deficit. Can we ride the rest of the way to school without further problems?”</p><p>“Yes, Ma’am,” both boys answered as they gazed at the floor of the compartment.</p><p>“Good, because if I find out about any more problems with you two there won’t be any need to get off of the train. Professor Leeds will send you right back to King’s Cross without a second thought.”</p><p>“Yes, Ma’am.”</p><p>“Now, we only have about an hour before we arrived at Hogsmeade, I suggest that you change into your robes. It wouldn’t do for you to walk into the Sorting Ceremony dressed in those clothes!”</p><p>“Yes, Ma’am.”</p><p>Elizabeth started to walk away and then stopped to turn back to the pair.</p><p>“Please forget the Ma’am if you would. My name is Elizabeth and I much prefer that it be used.”</p><p>Both boys nodded and then watched as she turned once again to walk down the companionway and then out of the car while the younger Prefect stood silently.</p><p>‘<em>Obviously,’</em> she thought, <em>‘I have a lot to learn about this job.’</em></p><p>The scene now behind her, Elizabeth hurried to find her friends in the Gryffindor car. The task was not particularly hard for the pair sat in a compartment talking with several other students from their House. All looked up as the Prefect stepped into the doorway.</p><p>“I should have known that I would find all of you conspirators together,” she announced as she tried to display an anger filled countenance while she spoke to them. The reaction displayed in response to her attempts at feigned anger was poor attempts to not laugh and the compartment was soon filled with the laughter of all of them.</p><p>She settled down into an empty seat in the compartment and immediately felt at home. Her friends were here and her presence was more than welcomed as she joined into the conversation.</p><p>“Have you been to the Slytherin car yet?”</p><p>The question, coming from Lily, brought her back to the present and she nodded before stunning all present.</p><p>“I actually got out of there without taking points from them.”</p><p>“You mean that my sister behaved herself for once?”</p><p>“I didn’t say that,” she responded to Ariel. “She tried really hard to get the House into a lot of trouble but didn’t know how to respond to kindness. She was still speechless when I walked out of the compartment.”</p><p>The group of girls within the compartment laughed once again before Elizabeth continued.</p><p>“The new female Prefect from Ravenclaw is in for trouble if she doesn’t show others that she’s not afraid to act.”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“She tried to break up a fight by yelling at the people who were fighting. There was so much noise that no one could hear her and she wouldn’t step up to break up the fight. She looked almost afraid to deal with it.”</p><p>“She won’t last long if she can’t do what she needs to! Professor Leeds will take her badge in an instant and find someone else to be the Prefect.”</p><p>Elizabeth looked at Lily once again and then rose to step out of the compartment.</p><p>“Lily, can I talk to you for a moment?”</p><p>The other girl nodded and then rose while the others in the compartment continued with their conversation. The pair of sixth year girls walked to a quiet area of the car where they sat down to talk.</p><p>“Elizabeth, I know what you want to say and I meant what I said. I was glad to be a Prefect temporarily, but you’re back and the badge belongs to you. I had enough headaches while I wore it, I don’t want anymore.”</p><p>“Are you certain?”</p><p>“Elizabeth, you’re my best friend and I would never lie to you. I don’t want to be a Prefect again, there’s too much drama involved. You also don’t make many friends doing that job.”</p><p>“Okay, but remember, if you ever want it back just ask.”</p><p>“Don’t hold your breath, Elizabeth. I may have wanted it once before, but not now.”</p><p>The girls hugged and then rose to walk away with Elizabeth continuing on her rounds. She wondered about Meredith Weasley, as she had yet to see or hear the girl and doubted very much that she was on the train. She knew that the girl had gotten into a great deal of trouble at home over her part in the plot the term before and wondered if Meredith’s parents had decided to send her elsewhere to study.</p><p>She reached the end of the train and began her return trip to the Prefect’s car where she knew Tiger waited. They would arrive at the platform in Hogsmeade soon and she wanted to gather her things in in preparation for them to be transported to the castle by the elves.</p><p>Try as she might, the girl couldn’t keep the promise that she had made to others for herself. While many had put Gabriel Koeppler out of their minds she knew that she could never do so. It was true that she had managed to defeat and destroy the ancient wizard, but she knew that he would likely haunt her for the rest of her life.</p><p>Her compartment appeared before her and she opened the door to step into the space. Tiger sat patiently on one of the seats while he waited for attention from his owner. She settled down onto the seat next to the cat and ran her hand over his long fur while he purred and rubbed against her lovingly. He climbed into her arms and she buried her nose into his fur while they enjoyed each other’s presence. The girl gently kissed the animal before he lifted his head to brush the top of it against her face.</p><p>She must have drifted off to sleep because it was not long before she was being shaken to wake her. The male Prefect from her House was shaking her gently.</p><p>“Elizabeth, we’ve arrived at Hogsmeade and have to get ready for platform duty.”</p><p>The girl nodded and then, after planting a kiss on the top of the head of the cat, placed Tiger back into his cage and then locked the door behind him. He would be in her dorm room when she arrived and she felt certain of his safety. The young witch hurried to her assigned door and waited for the platform to quit moving past her. The movement outside finally ended and she pushed the door in front of her open before stepping out onto the platform and holding it open for the students who were beginning to file out.</p><p>She marveled at the memory of her own first steps out onto this platform as she heard the booming voice of Hagrid calling for the indicated students to assemble. She knew that soon those students would be soon riding the boats across the lake to the castle while the older students would ride the carriages than many thought were drawn by nothing save magic. She knew this not to be true for she had seen what drew the vehicles and she knew why she could see them, she had seen death.</p><p>When the train had finally emptied, Elizabeth pushed the door that she held closed and then walked away to join the other Prefects as they prepared to board carriages. She smiled at Edward Parkins, the male Prefect for her House, as he helped her into the carriage and quietly took her seat as he climbed aboard. Their carriage was soon moving up the winding road towards the castle that was Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p><p>She sat in her seat while she admired the image that the lights of the castle were reflecting in the lake. It was not the first time that she had been taken in by the beauty of what she was seeing and she knew that it would not be the last. A voice speaking her name called her out of her thoughts and she roused to see Emily Baker, the new Prefect that she had assisted, trying to get her attention.</p><p>“Elizabeth, I just wanted to thank you for helping me with that fight on the train.”</p><p>“Don’t mention it, Emily. Just don’t be afraid to call for help if you need it.”</p><p>“I’ll remember that.”</p><p>Elizabeth nodded and then turned her attention to the nearing castle and back to the boats that were still crossing the lake. The older students would be seated in the Great Hall before the first years entered and those memories were still frightening. She could still see the scene when she had entered for the first time and faced the multitude of eyes that seemed to be focused only on her. Then she had faced the Sorting Hat and the terror that she had felt at possibly being sorted into Slytherin. Thankfully she had been sent to the Gryffindor table and her friends.</p><p>When she arrived at the Great Hall she hurried to meet with Lily and Beatrice to walk to their customary places. Even though she was sitting in her normal spot Elizabeth was saddened, for she missed her absent friends and knew that things would never be the same at Hogwarts. She glanced down at the ring that Albus had given her as a promise and lifted it to her lips where she kissed it tenderly.</p><p>“I miss you, Albus.”</p><p>They had no sooner settled into their places when the doors opened and Professor McGonagall entered leading the terrified new first years. Elizabeth watched silently as a single thought went through her mind.</p><p>“Here we go again!”</p><p>For some reason, as she watched the new students file to the front of the Great Hall, a strange emotion filled her and she couldn’t explain what it was or why she felt it. All that she knew was that she felt as though something was missing and she wondered what she was going to say good-bye to.</p>
