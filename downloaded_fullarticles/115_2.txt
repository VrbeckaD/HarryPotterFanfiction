    <p>"You're staring." James stated.</p><p>"Again." Remus turned the page of his current read, leaning back against the pillar, facing the vast grounds.</p><p>Sirius sighed and watched you talking with your friend. It was probably something you loved because you had a big smile on your face and your eyes were crinkled at the corners like they did whenever you were excited.</p><p>Your Ravenclaw robes swished around your feet as you walked quickly now, catching up with your friend who was groaning at your words. She gave you a look but you only laughed good naturedly, throwing an arm around her shoulder.</p><p>Sirius Black was smitten.</p><p>"That's really creepy, you know? Instead of staring at her, why don't you just go say hi and <em>actually</em> talk to her?" James asked, bemused, as Sirius scrunched his face.</p><p>"And make a fool of myself? No thanks. I'd rather just watch her." </p><p>Remus closed his book and leaned forward. The look on his face clearly meant he was annoyed and James was willing to bet that it was Sirius' stupidity.</p><p>"Just..." he pinched his nose in frustration.</p><p>"Try? Please? It's getting really old seeing you all lovestruck and mopey about it." </p><p>"But I'll just fumble and she'll think I'm an idiot or something!" Sirius protested.</p><p>"Since when does <em>Sirius Black</em> fumble?" Peter asked in genuine surprise which made James and Remus crack up.</p><p>"Since the pretty Ravenclaw stole his heart," James said and Sirius pouted, looking away from them to catch a glimpse of you but unfortunately, you had already left.</p><p>—</p><p>You were in a frisky mood after walking around the grounds with Mia, your roommate, and trying to convince her to tutor you. DADA was a subject you always had difficulty with because it was more practical and you could never perform a spell perfectly.</p><p>As a Ravenclaw, you were naturally determined to be good at everything and this was no exception. But Mia didn't want to teach you because according to her, you were <em>good enough</em> and should focus on divination which you positively sucked in.</p><p>"Mia, come on! I'll even get you your favorite sweets from Honeydukes!" You whined.</p><p>She glanced at you for a moment before going back to combing her hair. Ignoring your huffs of frustration, she told you to ask someone else.</p><p>"Fine! I will then!" You stormed out from the room in a foul mood, wanting nothing more than to punch a tree. But luck seemed to be against you as you bumped into someone and lost your balance, falling on the floor.</p><p>"As if this was left…." You grumbled, ready to apologise to the person, coming face to face with Remus Lupin. He was a brilliant Griffindor, having a warm personality and you actually felt bad on bumping into him.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Remus. I guess this just isn't my day," you sighed and he chuckled, brushing off your apology and standing up, helping you as well.</p><p>Wait a second. Remus was amazing in DADA, as were most of the Marauders, so you could definitely risk a chance at asking him to help you. He's a fairly helpful guy so you hope he won't reject your plea. </p><p>Your eyes flickered to three other boys that were always together with him and see them watching you with a hint of surprise on their faces. Giving them a smile and a curious look, you turned to Remus and turned on your puppy dog eyes.</p><p>"Remus, can I ask a favor from you? Please don't refuse before hearing me out!" </p><p>He looked behind him awkwardly and you wondered why before he gestured for you to go on.</p><p>Smiling in relief, you told him about your difficulties in DADA and how Mia wasn't helping you and by now, you were pretty desperate for someone to help you because as someone who remained in the quiet most of the time, you were already out of your comfort zone, asking Remus.</p><p>"I would love to help you out but the thing is, my mom is sick and I was planning to go visit her this weekend…"</p><p>Your shoulders dropped and a concerned look covered your face.</p><p>"It's not serious, is it?" You realized a little too late and by then, the Marauders except Sirius were laughing hard while he looked at them annoyed. You sent an apologetic look his way before turning to Remus once again.</p><p>"No, no, she's just down with a little cold and I wanted to make sure everything was okay." He smiled.</p><p>"Speaking of Sirius, I remember him saying that he had nothing to do on the weekends and well, he's also not bad at those spells so if you'd like, maybe he can teach you?" </p><p>You blinked at Remus' sudden change in topic and thought about it. What Remus said was true so if he was up for it, you couldn't see why you should refuse.</p><p>"Well, if you don't mind it?" You asked Sirius and he quickly replied.</p><p>"No! No, uh I don't mind at all, really. I'm yours anytime you want, darling," he said and you saw Peter and James stifle their laughter.</p><p>You smiled in mirth, eyes twinkling with mischief and Sirius swore you knew exactly why they were making fun of him. But the next moment, you thanked him and said that you'll discuss the time and place later. </p><p>And just like that, you were gone and Sirius felt as if his heart was going to come out of his chest, with how hard it was pounding. He only hoped that he wasn't blushing like a fool too.</p><p>—</p><p>"Remus, what the hell?" Sirius paced around in their room, grumbling about how he didn't even get a heads up. </p><p>Remus rolled his eyes.</p><p>"Oh, come on. I did you a favour. You should be thanking me. I don't really like the tone if this is you doing that," he jokes and Sirius sighed for the upteenth time that day.</p><p>"You'll be fine, Padfoot. It's not like you're bad at DADA and this could actually make her see you as a friend," James said.</p><p>"Friend?" Sirius frowned.</p><p>"Or something more," Peter quickly added, not wanting to hear him rant about you anymore.</p><p>"Yeah! So cheer up and prepare for your date."</p><p>"It's not a date, Prongs. Though, I'll ask her if she wants to go to Hogsmeade with me next weekend."</p><p>"Not a date? You two will be alone, all by yourselves, with no one to interrupt–"</p><p>"Oh my God, it's a date." Sirius panicked and Remus threw a dark look at James for making him start once again.</p><p>—</p><p>"Thank you for agreeing to this once again, Sirius," You said, as soon as you walked into the Room of Requirements. Sirius had been surprised when you suggested that and you jokingly said that even a Ravenclaw like you had a few tricks up your sleeve.</p><p>"It's okay. I really did have nothing to do today. I'd much rather spend my time with a pretty girl," he winked and you feel your cheeks flush.</p><p>"Well, aren't you charming?" </p><p>"Only for you, darling."</p><p>You laughed and he smiled at the sight.</p><p>"Okay, okay let's start," you said.</p><p>You told him about how your spells never hit perfectly and how you still can't produce a patronus for more than a few seconds. He seemed to catch up on your insecurities because he assured you that it just takes a little practice and you'd definitely see the difference.</p><p>The room had already created an empty space for you to practice, with a few stray boxes lying around. You turned to Sirius with a determined look and he immediately understood. You were in class.</p><p>"Alright, blast this box for me." </p><p>He put an empty box, at the far side of the room in front of you and walked to where you were standing, studying your posture.</p><p>"Confringo!"</p><p>The spell landed a little to the left and missed the box, causing you to frown. </p><p>"See? This is what I'm talking about. I can perform the spell but it doesn't always find its target," you said and Sirius cocked his head to the side, <em>like a puppy</em>, you noticed. </p><p>"Well, I think you need to loosen up a little."</p><p>You raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"I'm sorry?" </p><p>"I didn't mean in a bad way! I just meant your body is too stiff. I think you're trying to concentrate too much into making the spell right that it's causing you to tense up when you cast it." He quickly remedied.</p><p>"Here I'll show you. Position yourself as if you were going to cast the spell but don't say it."</p><p>You did as he asked and pointed your want towards the same box. You heard him moving around before his hands settled on your shoulders.</p><p>"See? The muscles here are tense. Relax."</p><p>His voice was so close, his body too close that you couldn't <em>possibly</em> relax even if he asked you too. A quick whiff told you that you liked his cologne, <em>very much</em>. Before you could say anything, he moved in front of you and put his hand on yours in which you held the want, shaking his head.</p><p>"Too tight. Loosen your hold a little so that it feels natural to hold your wand," he said, fingers moving to ease yours. </p><p>After he was satisfied with your posture, he looked at you with a smile, causing you to crack one of your own. You were pretty sure your cheeks were red, on fire with his close proximity and he could probably see that.</p><p>"Okay, let's try this again."</p><p>You took a deep breath and spoke the incantation. This time it landed squarely on the box, engulfing it in an explosion.</p><p>You turned to Sirius with a grin and the one he gave back almost made your heart stop.</p><p>You practiced your spells for another two hours and now you could proudly say that you did much better than before. Even your patronus was able to have a solid form for more than fifteen minutes and you couldn't be happier.</p><p>Sirius was elated to see you improving and enjoying your lessons. He goofed around, making you laugh and to his pleasant surprise, you also replied cheekily, making him laugh all the more. He could easily say that the time spent with you was the best he had in a long time and he genuinely had fun with you.</p><p>"Thank you so much, Sirius!" You gushed and he couldn't keep the damn blush away.</p><p>"You've already said that eight times now, darling," he said but you shrugged dismissively.</p><p>"Well, I am thankful so I'll say it however much I want." </p><p>He really tried to keep the smile off his face but it seemed that with you, he forgot how to control himself.</p><p>"Anytime you need help with any subject, you can ask me. I'd be happy to give you a hand," you smiled.</p><p>"I'll keep that in mind." He winked.</p><p>—</p><p>"Sooo, how did it go?" James asked.</p><p>Sirius was back in his room, after dropping you off at the Ravenclaw common room entrance and ever since then, it seemed as if there was a happy cloud around him.</p><p>"Perfect." He sighed dreamily.</p><p>"Thank Merlin you actually talked to her because if I had to hear one more time about how perfect her eyes were, I would have barfed," Remus said.</p><p>"Well, I have <em>you</em> to thank for that. If it wasn't for your quick thinking, I might still be a lovesick bachelor like James here."</p><p>"Hey!"</p><p>"So, we take it that she said yes?" Peter asked, curiously.</p><p>"Yes for what?" Sirius frowned.</p><p>The rest of the Marauders exchanged exasperated glances before Remus spoke up.</p><p>"For Hogsmeade? You know the <em>one thing</em> that you actually <em>wanted</em> to ask her?" </p><p>Sirius paled and everyone else started laughing.</p><p>"Good luck finding another opportunity." James cackled.</p><p>"Moony!" Sirius turned to Remus but he was already shaking his head. </p><p>"Don't look at me. I did my part already."</p><p>It was the next day the Marauders came to know that Sirius' scream of frustration could be heard all the way across the Ravenclaw dorms.</p>
