    <p>Hermione Granger sat in the Gryffindor common room with her two best friends, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. The past few months had been pretty rough for everyone. They quickly realized getting back into their normal lives wasn’t going to be so easy. Hermione was especially worried about Harry. When they lost Sirius during their battle at the ministry four weeks ago, Harry lost the only true family he had left. Well, other than the Dursley’s, but they don’t exactly count. Ron told her Harry’s nightmares were back again. Harry would whine and cry in his sleep all night. He’d wake up every morning drenched in sweat. Their group of friends were exhausted and scared. Even with the summer holiday coming up, the Gryffindor common room didn’t feel much like celebrating. </p>
<p>There was a rumor going around that there was going to be a huge announcement at dinner tonight.  Hermione hoped it would be something positive that would distract them from the horror they had witnessed that was still very fresh in her mind.</p>
<p>Ginny Weasley and Neville Longbottom descended from the stairs into the common room. The pair noticed Harry, Ron, and Hermione sitting around the fireplace and walked over to join them.</p>
<p>“Are you guys ready to head to the great hall for dinner?” Ginny asked. </p>
<p>Harry looked up, startled by the new arrivals, and nodded.</p>
<p>“Alright, as long as I don’t have to sit next to Ron while he pigs out on turkey legs again,” Harry said, forming a small, still sad smile on his face. </p>
<p>“Hey!” Ron shouted, “those things are bloody delicious!”</p>
<p>Hermione giggled. Even in the wake of tragedy her friends still had enough spirit to joke around. Perhaps there was some hope after all. </p>
<p>The crew of Gryffindor pals continued to joke about Ron’s eating habits as they made their way to dinner. They joined their friends Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan, who were already sitting at the Gryffindor table.</p>
<p>“What do you suppose is the big announcement from Dumbledore?” Seamus asked. No one answered him at first. They looked around at one another to see if anyone had heard anything about it. By the looks of it, none of them had the foggiest idea.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Neville proclaimed, “Maybe they’re cancelling our OWL exams. Kinda like when they cancelled end of the year exams second year.”</p>
<p>Hermione gasped loudly, “NO, NOT AGAIN!”</p>
<p>The group of friends exploded with laughter. Their joy echoed throughout the great hall. It felt good to see a slight glimmer of happiness from her comrades again.</p>
<p>After the great hall was packed full of students, Professor Albus Dumbledore stood up and made his way around the teachers table to the podium. Professor McGonagall picked up her glass and gave it three sharp taps with her fork, signalling for everyone to quiet down.</p>
<p>“Good evening,” Dumbledore began. “I know everyone by now has heard the rumors bustling about the school and you are all wondering what big announcement I have planned for you all tonight. I promise I will get to it shortly, but first I wanted to say how proud I am of each and every one of you. This year has been especially difficult for a lot of you, and yet you persevered and made it to the end of term. This year has been filled with a lot of tears, fear, and anger,” Professor Dumbledore paused for effect, “however, it has also been filled with tons of laughter, courage, and strength.”</p>
<p>He paused briefly for another moment and smiled. He turned around and looked at his fellow teachers and colleagues, receiving reassuring smiles in return. He then looked back to us again without breaking his smile. </p>
<p>“I want you to take a moment to look at the people you have chosen to sit next to tonight,” he said, “I want you to think of all the amazing memories you have made with them. Not just this year, but in years past as well.”</p>
<p>Hermione looked around at her friends. She thought of all the Sunday mornings she spent with Ginny gossiping while they strolled the Hogwarts grounds. She thought of all the silly outbursts made by Dean and Seamus in the middle of class, not at all worried about what punishment was sure to follow. She thought of the times she would help Neville with his Potions homework so he wouldn’t get humiliated by Professor Snape. Not any more than usual at least.</p>
<p>Finally, she looked at her two best friends sitting beside her. Hundreds of wonderful memories with them filled her head and heart. She first met Harry and Ron on the Hogwarts Express, which would eventually lead them to their very first adventure together at Hogwarts as first years. She fixed Harry’s glasses and told Ron he had dirt on his nose. Other memories that she thought of included Harry and Ron saving her from a troll, brewing polyjuice potion (she didn’t want to think too long on that particular memory), time-travelling with Harry, playing lots of games of Wizard’s Chess with Ron (and, to much of her annoyance, losing every time), watching in agony and pride as Harry competed in the Triwizard Tournament, and cheering him on in all of Harry’s Quidditch matches with her friends. There was also all the times the trio had saved so many lives on countless occasions. Trouble always seemed to find them, even when they weren’t looking for it.</p>
<p>She has been through a lot with her boys. Just like Professor Dumbledore said, they’ve shared a lot of laughs, tears, and memories-both good and bad. However, after everything they’ve done and experienced, she wouldn’t change any of it. She can definitely say, without hesitation, if it wasn’t for those two rascals, her Hogwarts experience wouldn’t have been the same.</p>
<p>“The definition of friendship,” Dumbledore began again, “is a state of mutual trust and support between allied nations. At the beginning of your first year of Hogwarts, you are sorted into your houses. We always tell you that your house is like your family while you are here. This is where you will ultimately find your biggest support system, your best friends. However, sometimes you may be lucky enough to also find friends outside of your houses.”</p>
<p>Hermione turned around and looked at Luna Lovegood, a Ravenclaw who was someone her group of Gryffindors had become very close to this year. Ron still wasn’t quite sure about her. She’s very odd, and it does take some time to get used to her quirks. Just past Luna she glanced at the Slytherin table. She could see Draco Malfoy and his little group of admirers scoffing at Dumbledore’s speech. His father had just been sent to Azkaban for assisting in the attack at the Ministry. Hermione was sure that if Draco Malfoy continued on the path he was on, he would likely end up just like his father. </p>
<p>Malfoy noticed Hermione looking at him. He glared at her and mouthed the words “filthy mudblood” at her. She glared back and then turned back around to face her friends. There was no one she despised more in this room than Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>Dumbledore began pacing as he continued to speak. </p>
<p>“Although it is possible to find friendship outside of your house, it is not always easy or convenient. So, with a little help from Professors McGonagall, Sprout, Snape, and Flitwick, I devised a plan for you all this summer. It is called ‘The Friendship Initiative.’”</p>
<p>The Gryffindors looked at one another, confusion on their faces. </p>
<p>“Please tell me this doesn’t mean we have to do homework over the summer,” Ron whined, trying to be discreet.</p>
<p>Dumbledore gave Ron a small, knowing smile and continued on with his speech. </p>
<p>“Each student has been paired up with a colleague from a different house than their own. Students have been paired based on their compatibility. This includes hobbies, interests, goals, aspirations, and desires. One person from each pair will spend 5 weeks with the other at their home over the summer. Guardians were notified earlier this week and all accommodations have been arranged and agreed upon. Your assignments will be hung up in your common rooms in the morning. A list of rules will also be posted for you to familiarize yourselves with. Any questions you may have can be directed to your head of houses or myself in the morning.”</p>
<p>Loads of questions ran through Hermione’s head, but she was sure that, come morning, most of her questions would be answered. Or, she’ll have about 20 more questions on top of her pre-existing ones. </p>
<p>“Don’t forget to study hard this weekend for your end of term exams that begin on Monday. Fifth-years, your OWL examinations also begin on Monday. By this time next week, the school year will be over, and you all will be packed and ready for the train ride home. Now, who’s hungry?”</p>
<p>As soon as Professor Dumbledore finished his speech, food appeared on the tables. Everyone started buzzing about who they hoped to be paired with all while filling their plates with delicious food.</p>
<p>“Do you think they’ll pair boys and girls together?” Dean asked, wiggling his eyebrows up and down, seduction clearly hinted in his voice.</p>
<p>“If so, we know who Harry wants to be paired up with!” Ron teased.</p>
<p>Harry elbowed his best friend in the ribs. </p>
<p>“Ha ha, very funny. I hope you get Millicent Bulstrode or Pansy Parkinson!”</p>
<p>We all knew who Ron was talking about undoubtedly: Cho Chang. They had shared an intimate moment together earlier in the school year. Ginny, on the other hand, did not join in on the laughter. Hermione knew Ginny had a crush on Harry. Ginny shared that with her at the beginning of the school year. Of course, unbeknownst to Ginny, she has known of Ginny’s crush on Harry since he saved her in the Chamber of Secrets three years ago. Harry is completely oblivious.</p>
<p>“Who do you hope to be paired with, Hermione?” Neville asked.</p>
<p>Hermione shrugged, “I don’t care as long as he or she is kind, intellectual, and likes to have fun. If we are going to be stuck with one another for 5 weeks I want to enjoy the experience.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, I’m sure reading the entire public library’s collection is fun for everyone!” Ron exasperated, rolling his eyes as he said it.</p>
<p>Hermione shot daggers at him with her eyes. </p>
<p>“For your information, Ronald, there are tons of things I enjoy besides reading!”</p>
<p>After Ron and Hermione calmed down, everyone continued to enjoy their feast and each other’s company. About 30 minutes passed and the great hall slowly started to empty. Hermione took one final bite of her apple tart and stood up to leave with Harry and Ron. </p>
<p>“After breakfast tomorrow do you guys want to study for our Transfiguration exam together for a little bit? We can go outside and sit by the Black Lake. The weather is supposed to be nice tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Harry agreed, “I promised Ginny I’d have one last Quidditch practice with her tomorrow afternoon before studying fully takes over our lives the next few days.”</p>
<p>Hermione smiled. Harry had no idea about Ginny’s infatuation with him. It was only a matter of time before he would be wrapped around her finger. Hermione didn’t know how she knew, but he’d come around sooner or later.</p>
<p>The trio of friends spent about an hour in the common room playing wizard’s chess and talking more about Dumbledore’s initiative before they headed up to bed. Hermione lay in bed thinking about how much fun this summer was going to be and, hopefully, gaining a new friend in the process. Eventually she drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>----------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next morning, Hermione woke up and grinned with excitement. She couldn’t wait to see who everyone was paired with. She quickly got dressed, brushed her teeth, and attempted to comb her hair. After battling her curls for five minutes, she gave up and headed downstairs. There was a small group of people gathered around what Hermione assumed was the pairings list. Above that list were the rules that Dumbledore promised would be posted.</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <b>The Friendship Initiative Rules</b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Paired students will live together for 5 weeks (35 days) starting on July 8th and ending on August 12th.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. Upon returning home in August, you will have about 3 weeks until the next school year begins. You are to write a short essay about your experience with your classmate. What are some good qualities that you learned about your classmate? What did you enjoy about the experience? This essay will count as 20% of your grade for each class next year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. You must spend a minimum of 5 hours a day with your chosen classmate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4. No magic may be used during your time together, even if you are already 17 years old.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5. No changes can be made to your assignment. All pairings are final.</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>“LUNA LOVEGOOD?!?!?!” Hermione was startled by Ron’s screech. “I HAVE TO LIVE IN LUNA LOVEGOOD’S HOUSE FOR 5 WEEKS?!?!”</p>
<p>Ron huffed and puffed while making his way to one of the armchairs and plopping down with a dramatic groan. Hermione shook her head at her friend. <em> It’ll be good for him </em> , Hermione thought, <em> maybe Luna will teach him not to be so tense all the time.  </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Neville approached the list and looked for his name. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>Longbottom, Neville (Gryffindor) will host Abbott, Hannah (Hufflepuff)</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hannah’s nice,” Neville reported. “Since she was in Dumbledore’s Army with us I got to know her a little bit. This will be a fun few weeks I think.” Neville seemed nervous. <em> Maybe he likes her </em>, Hermione thought, but he’s always nervous. Harry walked up next. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>Potter, Harry (Gryffindor) will be hosted by Finch-Fletchley, Justin (Hufflepuff)</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ll be living with Justin Finch-Fletchley. I haven’t really spoken to him since second year. I know we’re on good terms, but it’ll be a little strange at the start I think. I’m just glad he’s not coming to the Dursleys!”</p>
<p>“Let’s see,” Ginny said as she approached the list. She used her finger to trace the lines of names until she found hers. When she read her assignment, Ginny noticeably tensed and didn’t move for a few seconds. Suddenly, she dropped her hands and walked over to Hermione. </p>
<p>“Hermione!” Ginny whispered frantically. “I got Cho Chang. How am I supposed to spend 5 weeks with the person who my crush has a crush on?!”</p>
<p>Hermione smiled, “Oh please, Ginny. You’ll be fine. She’s really nice. Whose house?”</p>
<p>“Mine,” she retorted. “My mom will probably fall in love with her, too,” she said, rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>Hermione was about to reply when she heard her name. “Uh, Hermione?” Neville said, again with a nervous tone. “Have you seen who you’re paired up with?”</p>
<p>She raised an eyebrow at him. Based on his posture and lack of eye contact, she knew this couldn’t be good. </p>
<p>Hermione walked gingerly toward the list. She copied Ginny’s movements and used her finger to search for her name. When she found it, she wanted to scream just like Ron, but kept her cool just long enough so she could run up the stairs and scream into her pillow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>Granger, Hermione (Gryffindor) will host Malfoy, Draco (Slytherin)</strong>
</p>
