    <p>"You have volunteered to protect the goblet during the time of the tournament. Is this correct?" Asked the goblin king in front of the door of the deepest vault in existence.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Yes, your Majesty." Replied the robe draped figure stepping from the shadows to the side of the vault.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Very well, I do hope your skills will be unnecessary though." The king responds as he opens the Unnumbered vault.<span> </span></p>
<p>"As do I, my liege, but I also had hoped this madness would not touch my ancestor's immortal child once more." The figure said trailing the king with a long sigh.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Indeed, the cup," said the king opening an old solid mahogany box, "but, the choice has been made. Come back in an hours' time to collect the artifact and your team."<span> </span></p>
<p>"I only require one other, and I request William Weasley do to his skill. I will take the hour to pack and meet back at the main meeting chambers with William." The figure said bowing nearly folding in half.<span> </span></p>
<p>"I will be sure he is informed." The king said with a slight nod as they parted ways some levels up from their original location.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Of course." The figure replied with a jerky nod before hopping a cart to the lobby.<span> </span></p>
<p>
  <b>-Later, Main Meeting Room of the King-</b>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>"Lady Slytherin, I'm honored you chose me to accompany you on a mission." Bill Weasley said coming up to the figure leaning against the frame of the door to the kings main meeting chamber.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Greetings, William, it's good to see you again." Salazar greeted flatly with a calculated look in her eyes as she inspected him from his rough dragon hide boots, somewhat dirty robes (she supposed he probably had been working till recently but still.), scared face, and his mid length scruffy flaming red hair, "you were chosen for your specific skills. Do Not Fail Me."<span> </span></p>
<p>"Of course, but may I ask the mission. Collectors usually don’t bring outer level employees on their teams. No disrespect meant of course, it is as I said a great honor to be chosen." He replied, looking somewhat confused but confident.<span> </span></p>
<p>"You will learn it soon; King Jareth will fill you in while I secure the artifact for transport." She said as the doors open and she enters the room.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Your majesty." Both said bowing Salazar once more bowing almost in half, while Bill goes to the respectful 90° bow at the waist.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Salazar, Mr. Weasley, your mission will not be an easy one, for you, Mr. Weasley, I have every confidence in you Salazar it will be one of the easiest missions you’ve had in many years." The king said with what for a goblin passed as an impish grin at Bill making the ginger shiver in discomfort, Salazar giving a ghost of a polite grin as she approached the box to check the protections for strength and potency, the king filling Bill in, in a vague sort of way do to the nature of collector missions.<span> </span></p>
<p>"William, could you see if there are any other protections that could be enacted on this?" Salazar inquired levelly after the king finishes.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Yes, of course." Bill replied as he started inspecting the existing protection and seemingly only strengthening them, "Done, it's as protected as it can be, my Lady."<span> </span></p>
<p>"Very well," Salazar replied, sounding much like a goblin, placing the box into a pouch at her waist, "we shall be on our way. May your gold flow and your enemies tremble." She continues bowing to the king walking away from them, causing Bill to bow hurriedly and rush to catch up with Salazar.<span> </span></p>
<p>"So, where are we going?" Bill asked excitedly.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Hogwarts, do be a good little lion and stay out of trouble while we're there." She said dry as the Sahara, artfully canting an eye brow at him.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Of course, ma'am, I would never imagine doing anything to cause your or Gringotts embarrassment or trouble." Bill rushed to assure.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Good," Salazar replied with an amused grin, "an Mr. Weasley, if you ever call me ma'am again, your body will go mysteriously missing never to be found." She continued after turning and slowly moving closer, lightly tapping his cheek after, before turning and continuing her journey to the floo's. Leaving Bill to gulp and rush, once again, to catch up.<span> </span></p>
<p>
  <b>-Hogwarts, Staff Meeting-</b>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>"I really do not want to be back here." Salazar mumbles to herself quiet scowl on her face.<span> </span></p>
<p>"This is amazing it's going to be great to be back even if only for a year." Bill enthused as they entered the staff room for the meeting held every year before school.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Severus, may I?" Salazar inquired gesturing to the seat just to his left.<span> </span></p>
<p>"And who might you be?" Asked Severus not looking up from his potion magazine.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Come now, Sev, don’t you recognize the voice of your second-best friend?" She asked striking liker her houses symbol and snatching the magazine causing a hush in the room as Severus spun angrily around.<span> </span></p>
<p>"You Little," Severus began before seeing the figure in Slytherin green and black faintly smirking at him with an eyebrow raised in challenge, "Lady Slytherin, do sit. It's been far too long old friend." He said pulling the chair out for her.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Thank you, Sev, here's your magazine back." She said as she sat and placed the magazine in front of his seat. "You all should close your mouths, you'll catch flies like that." She continues as if she had only just noticed the others existence.<span> </span></p>
<p>"Indeed, and we do still have a meeting to conduct." Dumbledore said with his genial smile shooting that grandfatherly look at Salazar causing her to grind her teeth. "This year we will be joined by Alastor Moody for Defense, and a couple of our alumni for the tournament Bill Weasley and Salazar Slytherin." He announced happily, Salazar looking contemplatively at Moody feeling something off with him. What followed was the most tear inducingly boring meeting she had ever had to sit through.<span> </span></p>
