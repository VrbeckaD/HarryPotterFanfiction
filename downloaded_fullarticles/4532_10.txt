    <p>They had shared Potions right after breakfast and Draco couldn’t help but drift out of the conversation that Pansy was determined to have with him, and wander aimlessly a few paces ahead where Potter, Granger and Weasley were deep in what looked like a very animated discussion. They always looked so happy around each other, so grounded and at ease. Neither Pansy nor Crabbe and Goyle ever looked as at ease around him; perhaps because Draco himself could never breech that carefully constructed hierarchy that trapped them and their families before them, but no matter…</p><p>Hermione – Granger – laughed and so did Potter, their eyes glued to Weasley’s freckle-spattered face. Draco bristled.</p><p>Pansy, familiar enough with his impulses to know when he needed to be leveled out, clasped her fingers tight around his wrist seemingly sending all her strength into keeping him by her side, but even then her hold was easy enough to break, especially after the cool look he shot her.</p><p>Draco picked up the pace, lucky for his height as it allowed him to do so with an appearance of utmost idleness. Crabbe and Goyle were left to stumble over their massive feet to catch up with him.</p><p>“What was it, Weasley?” He drawled venomously, “Have you told them how much your father makes at that joke of a job?”</p><p>“Shut up, Malfoy!” Hermione – Granger – and Potter snapped in unison, their faces immediately losing all the warmth.  </p><p>What baffled Draco the most is that he clearly was the injured party here, he clearly was in the right. He had met them first, both Potter and Granger, and thus had reserved the rights for them. One might even say he had the dibs, but Draco wasn’t raised to be that crude.</p><p>Either way, it was the three of them together in Diagon Alley before their first year. It was him and Potter in Madam Malkins’, chatting about the new Nimbus 2000 and their shared passion for quidditch while their respectable parents were off running errands. And if Draco did exaggerate here and there, well… He was nervous. He didn’t want to be lonely at school. Sure, he had Pansy and Crabbe, and Goyle, but they never did – at least the latter two – make him feel quite accomplished enough.</p><p>Hermione – Granger – did. He ran into her at Olivanders’, her starry hazel eyes and great bushy hair catching him off guard as she stumbled over the threshold on her way out of the shop. He told her to watch it, as he saw his father do on occasion, the lack of elegance being among the greatest sins he found in an uncivilized society. She said sorry and smiled at him brightly showing her rather large front teeth. Oddly enough, his first thought has been that despite the teeth and the hair, and the clumsiness, something about her took his breath away.</p><p>“Did you get your wand then?” He breathed, unable to help himself as his eyes landed on a long slim box she’s been clutching close to her chest.</p><p>“I did,” She beamed, “Have you? Are you going to Hogwarts for the first time as well? I took a quick flick through ‘Hogwarts: A History’ at that bookstore down the street – the Flourish and Blotts, and it sounds absolutely brilliant!”</p><p>Draco stuttered momentarily taken aback by the force of her enthusiasm. He had to admit, he’s never met anyone (except possibly himself) who was quite so assertive. His next idea was to get his mother to buy him this ‘Hogwarts: A History.’ Of course, he’d heard more than enough about the school from his parents… He didn’t immediately realize how could it be that this sharp, obviously curious girl didn’t.</p><p>“Yes,” he managed finally and not without dignity, “I am going to Hogwarts this year and I am going to get my wand now. My father says that Olivander is the best wandmaker on the market at the moment, but if he’s unable to offer us a worthy wand, there’s my great grandfather’s one, that is singularly potent.”</p><p>“Oh,” the girl breathed, her bright eyes growing bigger and rounder, “Your parents are wizards, aren’t they?”</p><p>Draco took that as a personal insult.</p><p>“Of course, they are.” He scowled, “I’m Draco Malfoy.”</p><p>“Hermione Granger,” She beamed, unlike Draco - perfectly unsuspecting.</p><p>He wasn’t sure why, but he really didn’t want to ask about her heritage. Something in him recoiled from finding out whether she really was what he suspected her to be. Somehow, the notion didn’t sit right with him. From what his mother had told him he imagined mudbloods to be filthy, ill-bred mob, not at all as radiant and fascinating as this Hermione Granger.</p><p>“Do you know what house you’ll be in by any chance?” He asked carefully instead.</p><p>“They are four, aren’t they?” She mused, almost to herself, “Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and…”</p><p>“Slytherin,” Draco cut in darkly.</p><p>He had this feeling, something he never experienced before, a sense of foreboding defeat and deprivation, that left him bitter and touchy, and restless.</p><p>A hand laid heavily upon his shoulder.</p><p>He didn’t need to look around to know to whom it belonged.</p><p>“Who are you talking to, Draco,” Lucius Malfoy’s sprawling velvety voice raised from behind him, making Draco stiffen and collect himself.</p><p>“Nobody,” he managed, though his own voice sounded dejected and grim, “I was just going in.”</p><p>He couldn’t quite make himself meet Hermione’s eye though, opting instead to study a grimy dusty glass over her shoulder.</p><p>As he moved past her and into the store however, lost amongst the jingling of the doorbell, he was sure he heard her say “I’ll see you at school then,” in that same determined and confident manner.</p><p>It was in that same manner now that she told him to: “Leave Ron alone!”</p><p>But that wasn’t right! It was Weasley who stole them from him, it was Weasley who sabotaged him, his payback was rather mild and perfectly fair, if you think about it.</p><p>“Why, Weasley, how noble of you to hide under you girlfriend’s robes! How’s the view from down there, I bet her knickers are as filthy as her blood?” He felt the words sting even as he said them.</p><p>It was bitter, desperate and it kept burning through his spine and through his throat, and through his whole being, almost as if saying those words equaled scorching them into his own skin.</p><p>Potter drew his wand so fast, Draco’s eyes barely registered the movement, but his own reaction was even faster, instinctive. And before Harry – Potter – could utter as much as a syllable, he hissed:</p><p>“Virtutem dividito,” the spell alien on his tongue.</p><p>He’s red so many tomes through the summer, so many dark crooked spells, so many devious curses - all crammed in his father’s secret library - that he wasn’t sure what was the meaning of which anymore. They just kept flashing through his mind, escaping via the only means available – himself.</p><p>Whatever Draco might’ve been thinking he didn’t expect what happened next. There was no flash of color, nor any immediate damage, it was almost as if the air itself had shifted around the two of them, condensed and slithered between them, and then - just as suddenly - dispersed, knocking the air out of Draco’s lungs and filling them with something else entirely. Potter swayed too, stared at him with what looked like disbelief for a sheer, fleeting moment, and then collapsed like a puppet whose strings were snapped off.</p><p>“What have you-” Hermione breathed, her face horrified as she starred between him and her best friend, lying unconscious on the floor.</p><p>Before he could reply however, there was a wave of shuffling in the crowd and a booming voice raising over the heads.</p><p>“Step away, step away,” Slughorn prompted good-naturedly, his wide form creating a ripple in the mass of students around him, “Goodness gracious, what happened here?”</p><p>This time Draco was the first to get the words out, somehow managing to make them sound light and almost genuine, despite his hands shaking so violently, he had to hurriedly shove them into the pockets of his robes.</p><p>“Potter was showing us some new bit of magic, but I’m afraid he wasn’t quite up to the task, professor.”</p><p>“Merlin’s beard,” The potions’ master exclaimed anxiously, “Well, don’t just stand there Witherby, take him to the hospital wing! Blaise, my boy, assist him if you will?”</p><p>Blaise scowled, but Draco could barely conceal his grin at the tender shade of old porridge that Weasley’s face had adopted in contrast to his ears that were glowing like ambers. </p><p>“Alright,” Slughorn breathed, “The rest of you, follow me, please.”</p><p>“Professor,” Hermione – Granger – stepped forward, her voice sounding shrill and unfamiliar, “Harry was my partner, so I… I… May I be excused, I’d like to go to the Hospital Wing with him?”</p><p>It was a rare thing, her willingly turning down an opportunity to learn, but it wasn’t exactly all new, Draco thought. She always did put Potter - and Weasley, he had to admit however reluctantly - first. What he wouldn’t admit to himself no matter what however, is how much he wished to be on their place at that moment.</p><p>“Nonsense, Miss Granger,” Slughorn waved her off though not entirely unkindly, “Madam Pomfrey is a perfectly capable healer, you’ve absolutely nothing to worry about! As for your partner,” He looked around momentarily in thought, before his eyes landed on Draco, “Draco here is currently without partner as well, I’m sure he’ll be happy to assist you. Won’t you, my boy?”</p><p>“Of course, sir.” He replied politely, even as his shaking hands balled into fists in his pockets. Him and Hermione – Granger – together, just as it was supposed to be all along. Almost as it was supposed to be, he corrected himself, accepting her steely glare. </p>
