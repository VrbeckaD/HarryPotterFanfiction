  <strong> Prologue </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>July 2008</em>
</p><p>"What do you mean, you're leaving?" Hermione asked her as soon as Hanna had stopped talking.</p><p>Hanna and her two best friends Ron and Hermione were sitting around the dining room table in Grimmauld Place. It was about a week after the final battle.</p><p>"It means I'm leaving the Wizarding World, Britain altogether actually. I can't stay here anymore Hermione. I don't belong here anymore."</p><p>"But...you're you! I mean, blimey Hanna, you've defeated You-Know-Who." Ron protested.</p><p>"And lost my magic in the process..." Hanna muttered.</p><p>"What? What do you mean?" Hermione asked her with wide eyes.</p><p>"That I can't use my wand anymore...or any wand..." Hanna explained.</p><p>"So, what? You're like a squib now?" Ron asked her with his usual tactfulness. Hermione glared at him for a few seconds before turning towards Hanna.</p><p>"Not like a squib, no. My magic is still there, I can feel it, but it's different. I can't cast spells anymore but I can make potions – which is a little unfair because I was never good at potions – and I can do other things too that I couldn't do before."</p><p>"What kind of things?" Hermione asked, a familiar look in her eyes.</p><p>"Hum...well, I'm like, very agile now."</p><p>"How agile?" Ron asked her.</p><p>"Olympic gymnast agile?" Hanna replied a little sheepishly.</p><p>"Blimey, Hanna." Ron exclaimed, his eyes as wide as saucers.</p><p>Hanna nodded. "I know, freaky right? I'm also much stronger than I was – not supernaturally strong or anything but much stronger than my small build would naturally allow. And you know I was always a fast runner, well now... I'm much faster – once again, not supernaturally fast like, I don’t know, superman or Flash but…well…fast like a professional runner I guess. And my stamina has really improved as well. And I can jump really high. Oh and, you know the fact that we all have muscle memory? Well, my body can kind of like, replicate anything that I see, even just once. I also have infrared vision and heightened sound recognition skills (I looked that up by the way). Basically, though my hearing is the same – it's not enhanced or anything – I can recognize pitch, tone and rhythm changes and this way I can 'read' what people are feeling, tell if they’re lying etc. Oh, and I also have an enhanced sense of touch and I can feel vibrations in walls and the ground and I can smell things with my tongue much more potently than I can with my nose, so much that I can basically taste the smells in my mouth."</p><p>"Hanna...that's...that's amazing." Hermione said, a look of awe in her eyes.</p><p>"I don't know if I can really consider it amazing. All my life, I've always felt different. I've never fit in anywhere. In the muggle world – beside the obvious reasons like the strange accidents that happened around me that I couldn't explain – it was because my aunt, uncle and cousin made sure I never had any friends and that everyone would see me as nothing more than a freak and a troublemaker. Then I found out that I was a witch and I thought...maybe I'm not so different after all, maybe I finally belong somewhere, and instead, I found out about the fact that I was the only one who had ever survived the killing curse and because of that everyone in the Wizarding World knew my name, and then I found out that I was the one destined to kill Voldemort and then I found out that I was the first human horcrux ever created and I had to die because of that but then, of course, I came back somehow, and now this. I guess my relatives were right...I really am a freak."</p><p>"Hanna, no! Don't ever say that!" Hermione protested immediately.</p><p>Hanna just shrugged in response and added, "There's another thing as well. I can use legilimency now. Or at least I think it's legilimency. When Snape tried to teach Occlumency he said that the mind is not a book that you can just read. Well, I don't actually read minds, it's more like I see pictures, scenes in a person's mind, their immediate...memories...I don't know if ‘memories’ is the right word. Like, I know that Ron is hungry because he just imagined himself eating a steak and you plan on going to Hogwarts this afternoon to search for books about wards because I just saw you imagining being in the Hogwarts library."</p><p>Both Ron and Hermione looked at her flabbergasted.</p><p>"Do you have to concentrate to receive these 'images' or they just...come to you?" Hermione asked her.</p><p>Hanna shrugged. "A bit of both. It's like your minds are TV channels. I receive all channels at the same time but I can only see one at a time."</p><p>Hermione nodded. "Fascinating." Then with a frown she asked, "What do you think caused this change?"</p><p>Hanna shook her head in confusion. "I don't know. Though I have a theory."</p><p>"What kind of theory?" Hermione asked her.</p><p>"Do you remember in second year? Well, technically you weren't there because you were petrified but, anyway, I'm sure you know that I almost died because of the basilisk fang that got stuck in my shoulder and that the only thing that saved me were Fawkes' tears. Well, I read about it and I found out that phoenix tears are not actually a cure for basilisk venom. They can counteract it but they can't really destroy the venom from a person's body."</p><p>"Are you saying that you still have basilisk venom running through your veins?" Hermione asked, horrified.</p><p>"Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying. I think the venom and the phoenix tears mixed together with my blood. And that's what caused this change in my magic. It would also explain why the basilisk venom didn't destroy the soul piece in my scar, because it got mixed in with the phoenix tears."</p><p>"But if that were true, wouldn't it have happened earlier?" Ron asked this time.</p><p>"Maybe, but I think it has something to do with the fact that I was a horcrux. We know, of course, that horcruxes are incredibly difficult to destroy. I think that the soul piece inside my scar protected me from the effect of the venom and tears mixed together. Now that I'm not longer a horcrux, this mixture of venom and tears spread all over my body and..."</p><p>"And change your physiology." Hermione finished. "It makes sense."</p><p>Hanna nodded. "Yeah. Anyway, the why I'm like this is not important right now. What's important is the fact that I can't stay here. Nobody can know that I can't cast spells anymore, that my magic changed and became something else. I can imagine what's going to happen to me. The death eaters still alive won't waste such a great chance to kill me and even if they don't succeed, I'm sure the Ministry would love to treat me as a second-class citizen, like another magical creature who doesn't have the same rights as witches and wizards."</p><p>Ron and Hermione looked at each other at that and sighed, knowing that she was right.</p><p>"Where will you go then?" Ron asked her.</p><p>"Among the Potters holdings there's a flat complex in Hell's Kitchen, New York. I'll go there and choose a flat for myself. I want to start afresh. I think I'll take the GED and then apply for college. I hope I can get into NYU or even Columbia."</p><p>"What do you want to study?" Hermione asked eagerly.</p><p>"Criminal Justice. You know I've always wanted to become an Auror. Now I can't do that but I could work with the muggle police or something. I want to protect and defend the people that can't protect and defend themselves. What better way to do that than by catching the bad buys and bring them to justice?"</p><p>Hermione smiled at her. "And you'll be absolutely brilliant at it Hanna, I just know it. This is exactly the kind of thing you are suited for." Hanna smiled at her in thanks.</p><p>"So, you're going to live as a muggle?" Ron asked, a frown on his face.</p><p>Hanna shrugged. "I don't see what other choice do I have. And anyway, I think I'll be okay. I'm used to living as a muggle and even though I hated living with the Dursleys I don't hate life as a muggle. I'm free from them now and I'm free from Voldemort, I can do whatever I want now, be whoever I want. It's not like I don't have enough money to live off the rest of my life as I please. Technically I can decide not to work a day in my life and still live comfortably."</p><p>"So, you can access your vaults even if you live as a muggle and in the States?" Hermione asked.</p><p>"Yeah. Turns out Gringotts has branches all over the world and connections with muggle banks too. They will move my money to a New York muggle bank and still get a percentage of it like they would if I still had my money in the vaults at Gringotts here."</p><p>"That's pretty neat!" Ron exclaimed.</p><p>"Yeah. And let me tell you, I'm lucky I'm not short on money because I saw the price of the Universities in the USA and they're really expensive. Gringotts will also help me with the right paperwork and stuff. You know, ID's, green card, medical history and health insurance, the schools I attended etc. I'm also going to change my name so nobody will connect me with the 'girl-who-lived'."</p><p>"Wow, you really thought of everything. And what name are you going to choose?" Hermione asked.</p><p>Hanna smirked slightly at that. "I was thinking…Electra Black. Electra is after all my second name and well, Black is, of course, in honour of Sirius. What do you think?"</p><p>"I think it's perfect. Well, Hanna…goodbye then and good luck! We'll miss you of course, but we get it!" Ron nodded as well. "And of course, we'll come visit you!" Hermione hugged her tightly and then it was Ron's turn.</p><p>Hanna left on a plane towards JFK from London Heathrow three days later. Only her two friends, Andromeda and Teddy were there to see her off. More than a year would pass until they saw each other again.</p>
