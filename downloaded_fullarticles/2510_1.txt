    <p>Streaks of sunlight illuminated the floorboards as you laid among the mess of covers in the bed of Charlie’s small cabin. The woods around you made daytime deceptive, darkness and cold almost a constant unless the sun broke through the trees at just the right angle. You had no idea how long you had been in bed, naked and wrapped in each other’s arms. Charlie was humming a soft tune beside you, his broad chest proving to be the most excellent of pillows, as he lazily ran his fingers along your scalp, a true sign of his contentment.</p><p>Whether it was the pines of the Romanian wilderness or the man holding you that was producing that alluring rich fragrance, you couldn’t be sure. But it had been filling your nostrils all weekend, just the perfect amount of masculine and inviting. You couldn’t imagine having to leave him, the man you had loved with your whole heart since he helped sneak you into the forbidden forest when you were hardly teenagers. He had been your rock all these years. Almost a decade now you had spent by his side, loving him and allowing him to love you in return. Not a single bone in your body was willing to move from your spot right beside him, hopefully to stay forever.</p><p>Charlie leaned over to grab the small orb beside the bed. He began tossing it in the air, so similar in size to the snitches he was such an expert at catching back in school. It seemed too natural in his hands, dwarfed by his rugged, calloused palms, though light and nimble against his fingertips.</p><p>You laughed as you watched him roll it down his knuckles and bounce it upward, catching it between his thumb and index finger. When he saw your curious eyes, he asked, “Where’d you get this little guy anyway?”</p><p>“Moody,” you responded, snuggling further into his side, enjoying the feel of his warm skin against your bare torso.</p><p>“Ah,” Charlie coughed, showing off one more tiny trick for your eager eyes.</p><p>Even after all this time you still loved those hands and all the wonderful things they could do. You were having a hard time deciding whether you wanted to hold them or let them roam your body.</p><p>As your hand came down to rest on his hip bone and felt the flesh of his upper thigh, a part of his body that only your hands had ever that the privilege of exploring, you were reminded of the first time you felt his bare skin against your own.</p><p>You could almost feel the warm waters of the prefect bathtub warming your toes as you recalled testing the temperature the night of Charlie’s birthday, 1988. Your robe had clung loosely to your shoulders as Charlie sat lounging against the porcelain, allowing the bubbles to cover all but his head. You had felt his eyes, intent and burning, as he watched you, waiting for the fabric to drop from your skin, to expose your body to his eyes. You had thought such a gaze would make you feel anxious and embarrassed, but it didn’t. You felt alluring, desired, and more than anything, loved.</p><p>You had let the cloth fall as you sunk down, leaving you only visible to his inspection for a moment before you too were buried in the bubbles. You had watched Charlie try to suppress a smile, biting at the corner of his lip as you swam to his side. You had expected your boyfriend to respond like a horny teenager, to take you and ravage you at his first convenience. And you remembered thinking you wouldn’t have minded. But that wasn’t your Charlie.</p><p>Yes, he was sixteen. Yes, he was stressed and pent up from his new role as Gryffindor quidditch captain. And yes, he desired you. He wouldn’t have asked you to date him, to come home with him for Christmas, to share this bath and to help you sneak into his bed if he didn’t. But Charlie was a different kind of boy, the kind you liked very much.</p><p>“Thank you for trusting me,” he had said when you came close enough to hear. He had leaned over as you took your seat beside him, resting his head on your bare shoulder. You felt his thigh brush against yours but nothing more.</p><p>“I’d trust you with my life, Charlie Weasley,” you remembered joking as you ran your fingers through his hair, brushing out the knots you found, so common these days from all the flying.</p><p>Charlie had sighed, his lips brushing your neck as he did so, “I hope it never comes to that.”</p><p>“It already has,” you laughed, thinking about your adventures in the forbidden forest and all the ways he had helped you with the cursed vaults since you first met.</p><p>Charlie’s arms had come around to hold your waist. You recalled trying not to gasp at the shock of his hands upon your bare flesh, denoting a new level of intimacy from which you could never come back. Charlie didn’t seem to notice you flinch, only sinking deeper against you side.</p><p>“You’re beautiful, by the way,” he had mumbled, alerting you to just how tired and worn out from his week he truly was. But his words had had you smiling. You had snuggled even closer to him, causing the water to slosh over the sides as you allowed your hands to roam his body just a little before you heard him snore, fast asleep against your shoulder.</p><p>You were pulled from your thoughts by Charlie passing you the small orb. He grabbed at your waist and nuzzled into your shoulder once he was able. But his gaze was pulled from your neck to the ball now resting against your palm, glowing a vibrant red.</p><p>“Y/N, is there something you are forgetting?”</p><p>You stared at your remembrall. “In case you forget your duty,” Alastor had said when he gifted you the tiny object. You felt your heart fall into the pit of your stomach.</p><p>You tried your best to breath as the orb slowly returned to clear, “I have to go to work.”</p><p>Charlie let out a loud, long sigh as he threw his leg over your hips, holding himself to you tightly.</p><p>“Just another hour, please, my love?” he begged, “I won’t see you again until Bill’s wedding. At least let us enjoy each other a few more minutes.”</p><p>You felt the hollow begin to expand in your stomach, moving with conviction towards your throat, consuming you from the inside.</p><p>“I can’t, Charlie. All Aurors are on high alert. You know my work is important right now.”</p><p>“I know,” he reassured with a kiss to your collarbone. It seared you, like a brand you wished not to bear, like a lie upon your flesh, proof of love you did not deserve.</p><p>The remembrall felt so heavy in your palm, the weight of your choice manifesting itself so acutely. You tapped at his hip bone and Charlie got the message, lifting his leg to allow you to stand.</p><p>As you began to pull on your pants, Charlie rolled onto your spot on the bed and spoke one more.</p><p>“Be safe, yeah? Promise me you’ll be safe. I don’t know what I would do if any harm came to you.”</p><p>“Charlie,” you begged as you buttoned your jeans, “This is war. You know I can’t make such a promise.”</p><p>“I know,” he breathed as he moved to sit on the end of the bed, “I just wish it didn’t have to be you putting yourself on the line. You should be safe. You should be here. With me, all the time, in my bed, in my arms,” he pulled you by the waist into his embrace at the last words. “I can’t stand waiting for the owls to let me know you are okay.”</p><p>“This is much bigger than us, Charlie,” you sighed into his arms. You tried your hardest to memorize the feel of his embrace; the way his chest hair tickled at your shoulders, how his muscular arms caged you with such a natural ease, the feel of his warm breath against your ear as he sighed, squeezing you even tighter. But you knew the memory would fade. It would have to. It must. You’d die of longing if it didn’t.</p><p>“Yes,” he tread, “But what are we fighting for if not each other?”</p><p>And there was your opening.</p><p>You pulled your head from his chest and looked him square in the eyes.</p><p>“Maybe the thousands upon thousands of muggle borns who will die if we fail at this!” you scoffed, crossing your arms and making it very clear that he had offended you.</p><p>“I know, but I’m sorry. I’m selfish. I want you safe,” he said, trying again to pull you into his arms. But you stood strong.</p><p>“We will never be safe, don’t you understand? Not until all of this is over. Not until this war has ended and he’s defeated for good this time. Regardless of what you might want, I can’t be safe. I thought you understood that,” you breathed as you began pacing the room. It was only when you crossed your arms over your chest that you realized you still hadn’t put on a shirt.  </p><p>“I understand just fine, Y/N,” you could hear Charlie’s voice raising despite how much he tried to control it, “I understand more than most. You, the love of my life, constantly throw yourself at danger like you’re some immortal and I am stuck a whole continent away just waiting for whenever you decide to send word that you’re okay. I am acutely aware of just how unsafe you are. But you don’t have to be. Not every battle is yours to fight, love. Please see that.”</p><p>You whipped around at those last words, glaring at Charlie.</p><p>“Then who? Who, Charles? Who is going to fight for them? For the muggles who don’t even know they are in danger? For all the creatures enslaved? For the muggle borns who are hiding out of fear for what might happen if they even go to the store or school or down the road? For the half-bloods and blood traitors who’ve managed to piss off the dark lord more than once? Blood traitors like your family, like you? Do you expect me to not fight for you?!”</p><p>“No, no, no,” Charlie was sitting on the bed shaking his head, watching as you grabbed through the covers to try and find your shirt, “Goodness, no. Of course not. I would never– I would never ask that of you. Merlin, Y/N–”</p><p>“And how do you think I feel, huh? Not knowing if I’ll be able to send that owl your way? Thinking I may never come back to you? I need to know you support me in this. I’m doing this for us, for you, so that there might actually be a future for us to share when this all is over!”</p><p>“Y/N, I know. I know this is hard for you, too,” Charlie spoke to you but his head was in his hands, his words garbled by the flesh of his palms, “I know you are making a big sacrifice here but can’t you just sit one out? Can’t you stop for a minute? If we win this war and I don’t have you on the other side, we won’t have won at all.”</p><p>“Charlie,” you huffed as you tried to get your arms through your sleeves, “I’ve spent my whole life prepping for this war and I will see it to its end. And it may kill me. You have to come to terms with that!”</p><p>“I know, love. I know.” Charlie stood, grabbing you by the arms, his fingers encircling your forearms, and bending forward to look you in your eyes. “I just can’t watch anything bad happen to you. I can’t. I love you, Y/N. I love you so much.”</p><p>You felt the tears pricking at the corners of your eyes at just how desperate he appeared before you, wanting to see you calm and happy once more. But you couldn’t give him that.</p><p>“Then I will make this easier for you, Charlie. You don’t have to watch me anymore. I love you, too, but if you can’t handle this, then maybe you can’t handle me.”</p><p>You stepped out of his grasp and threw on your coat. The collar was folded oddly and the sleeves were bunched but you didn’t care to adjust it. You needed to leave before you lost your nerve.</p><p>“What? Are you serious?” Charlie asked as he reached once more for your arm but you flicked yourself away.</p><p>You grabbed your bag that sat at the end of the bed, dragging it behind you like a physical barrier separating your body from Charlie’s.</p><p>“Goodbye, my love,” you choked through your tears as you opened the door to his cabin, stepping out among the fallen leaves that carpeted the small clearing outside Charlie’s home.</p><p>As you stormed into the forest, tears clouded your vision to the point of near blindness. You loved that man whose heart you just broke in two. Loved him more than words could say, beyond this war and your job and every other living human being. You felt like such a hypocrite. You’d fight through fire, through storms, through hundreds of death eaters to save that man from harm.</p><p>And that’s exactly what you were going to do. A broken heart was better than a body broken beyond repair. At least he’d be alive. At least he’d be safe. Even if it meant you’d never be able to hold him in your arms again. But that was the price you had to pay, the greatest price you could think of to help see this war find a peaceful end.</p><p>Somewhere deep in the back of your mind, you found yourself thinking that death seemed pleasant, at least more pleasant than surviving this war and having to watch Charlie love another or, even worse, never open himself up again. After all, apart from Charlie, you wondered if you really had anything to live for at all.</p><p>You heard Charlie call your name from the door of the cabin as he began to run after you. But you did not turn. You did not give yourself one last look. You didn’t deserve it.</p><p>You stumbled over your feet, your chest so constricted that you didn’t think you’d be able to breathe again. You just needed to get away, a few steps further, a few paces further. But hearing your name, so desperate on his lips once more behind you had you collapsing forward in complete despair.</p><p>Just as the crunch of leaves behind you grew unbearably loud, Charlie undoubtedly within arms reach, you found the strength to pull yourself away for good. Like a snap of the fingers, you apparated to the place where the portkey waited and began your long journey back to London.<br/>
image</p><p>A few hours later, the journey a complete blur, you walked into the headquarters of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Moody sat at the head of the boardroom table surrounded by Tonks and the rest of the team, all clearly waiting for your arrival to begin the latest meeting.</p><p>“Did you do as I asked?” Moody questioned.</p><p>Your tears had dried up somewhere in Germany, now your face only showed stern conviction.</p><p>But at Moody’s words, you pictured again the look on Charlie’s reddened face as you had stomped out of his cabin, the pleading in his eyes and the tears coating his cheeks. You heard once more in your mind the strained gravel of his voice as he whispered for you to not do the one thing you knew you had to do. And you felt yourself breaking all over again.</p><p>“Yes,” you confirmed as you swallowed down your tears. You passed the remembrall back to Moody. A look around the table confirmed that none of your coworkers were aware of your mission, though Tonks seemed to sense that you were upset if the way her hair dulled to a dusty rose as she examined your face was any indication.</p><p>Moody regarded you for a moment and then nodded. “Good.”<br/>
image</p><p>Back in Romania, the sun was setting. The light that had shone through the window as Charlie held you throughout the morning was long gone. Flashes of moonlight occasionally peeked through the trees, but Charlie was unaware. He had yet to dress. He had yet to eat. He had yet to accomplish any task that did not revolve around longing for you.</p><p>His fingers gripped your pillow, digging deep into the feathers as if strength along could manifest your form beside him once more. Breathing was labored still, even though he was fresh out of tears. He felt nothing now but emptiness, the first time in ten years.</p><p>Occasionally his eyes would roam to the bedside table, to the two objects he pulled out of the drawer, glaring reminders of how he had failed to support you. He would reach over, allowing the fingers to caress them, so delicate and precious. He studied the objects closely, ones he had planned to give you during this trip but had failed time and time again to find the courage to do so.</p><p>On the table sat a small golden arrow, a clock hand, adorned with your face and name in cursive letters along the stem, letters he had fantasized about sitting beside his own on his family clock someday soon, and a ring made of delicate gold metal that he had forged himself in the dragon fire, a promise he planned to make to be by your side forever, no matter what cost.</p>
