    <p>Hogwarts loomed in the distance, somehow rebuilt despite having been ground zero for the war not a year ago. There weren’t many students, especially new ones, but a number of old faces had returned, all as gaunt as the next, watching the silhouette of the castle with apprehension. How many friends and family members had been lost on those grounds? Hallowed grounds. </p>
<p>Though not many, a few first years conglomerated together as they were ushered in the hall. Ready to be greeted in the great hall as many others had before them. McGongall had been solemn in her address, but had welcomed them all, Fawkes at her side to demonstrate that anything could rise from the ashes. As such, she had concluded what had been a rather stark dinner compared to the boisterous conversations the Great Hall had once heard. It had been too soon since the room had been used to identify bodies. Far too many of the returning students could see the thestrals though.</p>
<p>The one bit of silver lining was with how few students there were in each grade, there were some actually checking in with classmates from other houses. Returning prefects were watching the students carefully, like they all seemed to think something would happen. Before anything did happen, for ill or for good, the feast was over and the first years were getting led to their common rooms by the prefects. </p>
<p>Amidst the waves of students abound, two figures would make their way to the tower reserved for the Head Boy and Girl for that year. Two seventh years to uphold the standard for their fellow students, to help the staff maintain order.</p>
<p>Perhaps getting his certificate the easy way would have been best, as his mother suggested, but Draco knew that there would be obstacles ahead, even if he had turned. His trunks had been brought to the quarters he would call home for the next year, and he had been curious to see who would be head girl alongside him. The trunks outside of either door showing that both of them had arrived.</p>
<p>Hermione felt that the first night back had felt...empty. She had Neville to talk to but it was odd without Harry and Ron. She and Ron had broken up over the summer, their fling during the war being just that. A fling. They had thought they were dying and she was pretty sure there were no hard feelings. And now that she was nominated Head Girl by McGonagall she felt a little bit better about coming here to get her education continued. And she had arrived to the quarters she shared with the Head Boy last it would seem, his trunks already in his room.</p>
<p>The suites for Head Boy and Girl were rather large. There was a common room for them with a fireplace, a couch, two arm chairs, and a table. But the decorations didn’t even give away what houses the pair of them were in. It would be a mystery she supposed. So she opened the door to her side of the suite, her room, and brought her trunks in so she could start unpacking.</p>
<p>Rather than keep up the mystery of all of this, she opened the door to their shared bathroom in case they would like to get to know each other a little better. Another swish of her wand had her books going onto the bookshelves in alphabetical order by author and publication date under each author. Her clothing flowed into the closet, the dresser, and was neatly put away. Everything had its place. </p>
<p>Mother had of course sent a care package, which sat on his desk, surrounded by books he wasn’t ready to shelve. Mostly because they hid the box of sweets and treats he knew was just another attempt to apologize. The constant push and pull he had with the woman that had birthed him. </p>
<p>Her parents were still in Australia. It was a way for her to try and keep them out of things while they settled. Hopefully by the time she graduated it would be safe for them to return. Her things were shelved and in typical Hermione Granger fashion, she moved to her desk to start organizing her parchment and her quills. </p>
<p>Ever since the war she had been trying to focus on anything other than the nightmares. Her sleeves were normally long sleeved, hiding the scar from the word that had been carved into her forearm. </p>
<p>Incapable of staying in his room any longer he stepped into the shared bathroom to wash his face. He noted that open door and paused. Knocking on the frame he announced his presence, hoping, no praying this wouldn’t be a harder year than it had to be.</p>
<p>At the knock to the door frame she smiled a bit and spun around and then froze. "....Malfoy? But....oh Merlin...."</p>
<p>He’d taken a step in, and then a few more as she organized her desk. A part of him recognized that level of anxiety. He’d rearranged his desk and shelves the entire week she’d been in his house, especially the nights she screamed. </p>
<p>He paled at the way she spoke his name. It was instinctive, the way he hardened, closed his mind and detached himself. “Wasn’t expecting you either, apparently pity earns titles these days,” he drawled dismissively. “Guess I can finish unpacking,” he shrugged. They had nothing to say, or rather what could he possibly say to her after the last year?</p>
<p>At that change to his demeanor she crossed her arms over her chest as she half sat back on her desk. Glad that the long sleeves covered the scar that she'd received in his home. If anything, Hermione's anxiety about school had gotten a little worse. But it was more like anxiety in general got worse after the last year on the run. </p>
<p>"Apparently it does," she said just as dismissively to him but she sighed and pushed her hair out of her face. It was a little frizzy, not having reapplied her hair potions to it after the train ride. "...We'll just have to learn to work with each other I suppose....McGonagall clearly wants to show unity after.....everything," she murmured, using that word instead of something else.</p>
<p>He paused at the threshold. It was easier to keep his back to her. “We can do rounds in turns,” he said carefully. Obviously she didn’t want to be near him and he couldn’t really blame her. Not after, everything. That seemed easy enough. “It’s not like we plan to sneak around dark corners,” he scoffed, recalling that elder Weasley boy and the blonde Ravenclaw’s torrid affair.</p>
<p>A slight snort left her at that and she rolled her eyes. "I'd rather not lose house points from McGonagall....she'll expect us to actually work together, Malfoy.....we'll figure it out," she muttered with a sigh and looked back to her desk but just nodded her head. "...Play it by ear for later. And no....I don't think we'll have the problem that Percy had...." That had been an interesting time for all the Weasley children in the castle. It had just been so...odd. More odd now that Percy was home and one of the twins was....gone. That thought actually brought a shadow over her expression but she shook her head and turned back to her desk. </p>
<p>Why did she have to be so stubborn? Of course she wouldn’t take the easy way out, which was aggravating to say the least. “I guess that’s one thing we agree on,” he said in regards to house points. The way she spoke his name had the small hairs on the back of his neck rise, but he ignored it, appearing cool no less. </p>
<p>"...Did more of the Slytherins from our year return than the Gryffindors did?" She had to ask. There were so few from her year in Gryffindor. Their “seventh” year class was combined with Ginny’s. The older students were given an out and many of them had taken it. </p>
<p>Of course they wouldn’t have that problem, he rolled his eyes. “A few,” he murmured. Blaise had returned, Pansy as well, but beyond that, none he would have been caught speaking too.</p>
<p>A slight nod of her head was her answer to him. They agreed, which was odd all things considered and unlike Ron she didn’t outright hate Draco. But that didn’t mean she liked him either. At least not anymore. Younger her was someone else entirely. </p>
<p>That roll of his eyes that she could hear in his voice, years of being teased and tormented by him making it obvious, she smiled faintly and nodded. “....Same. Not too many left from our year that wanted to come back.....makes our jobs manageable at least....” There was a wistful tone to her voice but it covered up a lot of pain. Too many of her friends were dead and gone and the rest didn’t want to face her again.</p>
<p>Draco shrugged. Most of Ravenclaw had returned, and if he were being honest, they were the ones to watch for. "Can't imagine why," he responded sarcastically, a coldness to his tone. </p>
<p>After having had the Dark Lord living under his roof, he wasn't exactly a fan favorite now that he had lost and was dead, people were so easily swayed, so easy to turn. He had no friends, he knew that now, Blaise being the only exception to that. The only one that hadn't been at his side simply because of his status. "Guess I'll meet you later," he said quietly.</p>
<p>Hermione turned to look at him and rolled her eyes. "Oh yes, because it's such a mystery. I realize. No need to be a prat about it," she grumbled. A bit more quick to anger than she had been before. Everything that she had been through did leave her technically one of the "heroes" of the Battle of Hogwarts. But she didn't feel like a hero. </p>
<p>"Let me know when you're ready to go on the late night rounds we need to go on....I'll likely be up." Doing homework. As always. It gave her something to focus on.</p>
<p>What had she really expected? She was grumpier, but it didn't matter. He was colder than he'd been, and he didn't rise to her anger. Not like he would have in his younger years. He nodded. "Just need to finish unpacking," he spoke in a low tone, something cold but not the snarl it would have been in the past. Just detached, as he seemed to be lately, as he had been during the war. A place in his head he could hide, one of many tricks he had learned in Occlumency. </p>
<p>On that he went to his room and closed the door. Back pressed to the hardwood, his eyes snapped shut and he breathed. His wand at the ready he sent everything to sort itself, to go to where it should be and books and clothes zoomed with the anger he couldn't allow himself to show. Where he could be cold and calculated, in moments like these even the simplest spell could be volatile.</p>
<p>That was....he hadn't snapped at her. Hadn't called her a name. That was something she wouldn't have expected from him at all. Closing her own door once he was gone she took in a slow breath. Working alongside Malfoy and the other two members of the Trio weren't here. Ginny was around somewhere, now in her year because of all of the seventh years that wanted to return redoing their seventh year. But she wasn't even sure how to react to Malfoy anymore. </p>
<p>Absently she rubbed at the scar that was hidden by her long sleeves and flicked her wand, sending the last few items back to their proper places before she sat on her bed. What was this year going to have in store for her <i>now?</i></p>
