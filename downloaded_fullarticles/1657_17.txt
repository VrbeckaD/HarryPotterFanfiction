    <hr/><p>Dean Thomas yawned as he removed the kettle from the heat. He poured the hot tea into two waiting teacups. The newly delivered copy of <em>The Daily Prophet</em> lay unfurled on the worktop, enabling him to glean the day's headline:</p><p align="center">
  <em>Hogsmeade Celebrates Ten Year Anniversary of The Battle of Hogwarts</em>
</p><p>Saucers in hand, he brought the cups to the sitting room where his guest, Luna Lovegood waited.</p><p>"Thank you, Dean," she said, accepting the proffered drink, all the while keeping her attention focused on the drawings lain across the coffee table. "These illustrations are amazing. They'll make a great addition to my book."</p><p>He took his seat. "It was easy; your descriptions were meticulous. Although, taking a picture would've been easier."</p><p>"A camera can't 'see' Blimmers. That's why it's been so hard to prove their existence." She took her fist sip, followed by an approving nod. "Besides, it gives me a reason to visit you."</p><p>Dean snorted.</p><p>"You've been busy," she said as she now regarded the many paintings, crafted by his hand, that adorned the walls. "It feels like we're having tea inside a gallery…. You should sell these."</p><p>"One day I may work up the nerve, perhaps when I run out of wall space."</p><p>Luna's focus was then drawn to a large book that rested on the corner of the table. It was weathered and held together with twine as a result of it being overstuffed with an assortment of loose pages. She opened it and began to peruse the sketches within. "And what of these?"</p><p>"There's nothing special in there," he said. "They're private."</p><p>That did not stop her from satisfying her curiosity. "What's so un-special about them?"</p><p>"They're my... <em>meditations."</em> He brought the cup to his lips and blew on the hot liquid. "And you're just going to keep flipping through them, I see..."</p><p>"Ex-girlfriend privilege," she said plainly. It did not take her long to raise an eyebrow. "Why are the subjects of all your 'meditations' women?"</p><p>He shrugged. "It was just something I fell into."</p><p>She smiled at a sketch of her from years ago walking along a beach. "I remember doing this at Shell Cottage… You were watching me?"</p><p>"I was always watching." He smiled. "It's still one of my favourites."</p><p>Luna blushed, and she turned the page. The next drawing made her frown. "Pansy Parkinson?"</p><p>"Don't ask—and it's not what you think."</p><p>She turned the page. Her frown persisted. "Pavarti and Padma… at the same time?"</p><p>"This is why I didn't want you flipping through it."</p><p>She turned the page. "I don't recognize her… What house was she in?"</p><p>He regarded the subject. "She's not from Hogwarts. She's a muggle."</p><p>"She's pretty." Her big blue eyes blinked in his direction. "Another blonde with blue eyes… do I detect a theme?"</p><p>"Nonsense. If you had rainbow-coloured hair, I still would've fancied you."</p><p>Luna's eyes widened at his sudden inspiration. <em>"Oooo!"</em></p><p>Dean grinned. "So, are you jealous yet?"</p><p>"I don't know what you mean," Luna said in her default aloof demeanour. "Especially when most of the drawings so far are of me, by a substantial margin." She smirked. "That means <em>you</em> think that I'm the prettiest."</p><p>Dean snorted. <em>Same old Luna...</em></p><p>She turned to the last page. This one made her pause. "The eyes… they're spot on." She illustratively held up the drawing of Bellatrix Lestrange, showing her head rested on a pillow with an expression of dreamy contentment. "You never did talk about what she did to you."</p><p>"She hurt me"—he shrugged—"there's nothing more to say on the matter."</p><p>"But, there <em>is,</em> Dean. It's kept you from moving forward." She reached out and took his hand. "It kept <em>us</em> from moving forward."</p><p>"I regret that." He kissed her hand.</p><p>"I feel like I've abandoned you."</p><p>He shook his head. "No, you were great. You kept me sane at an insane time."</p><p>"I miss you."</p><p>"I miss you too."</p><p>Luna sighed. "I better stop… before I see someone in here that I can't unsee." She closed the picture book and let it rest in her lap.</p><p>"They we're all platonic. Cross my heart."</p><p>"<em>We</em> weren't platonic, Dean."</p><p>He amended himself, saying, "Except for us" while keeping his eyes averted.</p><p>Luna regarded him with a sideways glance. "If you say so." And she returned the book to its spot on the coffee table. "I have to go; I'm having brunch with Rolf."</p><p>He paused from taking another sip. "Again?"</p><p>"Yes. He asked for a follow-up interview about my book."</p><p>"Somehow, I doubt his intentions."</p><p>Luna smiled. "Feel free to tag along… if you're jealous." She rose from the couch and collected her new Blimmer portfolio.</p><p>Dean joined her. "Hardly. I just want you to be careful, that's all." And he escorted her to the door.</p><p>She took his proffered arm. "I track category five Wizard killers for a living, Dean. I think I can handle Rolf—unless you care to supply me with another reason why I shouldn't go?"</p><p>Made uncomfortable, Dean cleared his throat. "No. Your book needs the exposure. Besides, I'm meeting with Seamus and Neville at Diagon Alley before the parade." He grinned. "Maybe I'll see you there?"</p><p>Luna nodded. "Give Neville and Seamus my best, would you?" Saying her goodbyes, she kissed Dean on the cheek and left.</p><p>Dean closed the door behind her and returned to the picture book. He opened it to revisit the effigy of Bellatrix, regarding her haunting gaze, a reminder of his promise—or, rather, her curse—to never forget her. Frowning, he snapped the book shut.</p><p>Inspired randomly upon further introspection, he made haste to the threshold, opened the door and peeked into the hallway outside. Hopefully, she wasn't out of earshot yet:</p><p>"Luna! Do <em>not</em> rainbow your hair...! I mean it!"</p>
