    <p>Anne nervously tapped the top of her suitcase that sat in her lap. It was frayed and the handle was crooked but that was all that she had from the orphanage.</p><p> </p><p>Only hours ago had she been told she was not in fact plain old Anne Shirley, but rather Anne Shirley the witch. She'd read stories of witches from times passed, read of the horrors they had faced. But Armando Dippet, who she had learned was headmaster of Hogwarts, a school for people just like her - kindred spirits perhaps? - had told her that she would be safe and cared for with this new family. The Cuthberts.</p><p> </p><p>Armando Dippet had accompanied Anne on the train to the Cuthberts. They lived in the countryside, away from the muggle world. Immediately Anne knew there would be scope for the imagination there.</p><p> </p><p>A woman of about 50 met them at the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr Dippet.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ms Cuthbert.” Armando bowed his head. He was a man of tradition, after all he was over 200 years old. Anne had wanted to ask him just how he managed to live so long but the opportunity never came up. “This is the orphan I had contacted you about.”</p><p> </p><p>“Anne Shirley,” Anne curtsied, looking up at the lady. “But please, that's Anne spelled with an 'e’. It's much more romantical that way, don't you think?”</p><p> </p><p>“Alright. Anne with an e. You may call me Marilla.”</p><p> </p><p>“I'm sure you'll fit in well here with the Cuthberts.” Armando made way to leave. “I believe you received your Hogwarts letter?”</p><p> </p><p>Anne rummaged through her suitcase, holding up the crumpled letter.</p><p> </p><p>“Heavens child.” Marilla scoffed at the utter mess of Anne's suitcase. “You'll need to learn to be a lot tidier than that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I will Ms Cuthbert- I mean Marilla. If it means you'll keep me here, I'll do anything.”</p><p> </p><p>“I look forward to seeing you at Hogwarts, Miss Shirley.” Armando disappeared right before Anne's eyes. Marilla explained it was something called apparition, which she would get the opportunity to learn in a few years.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you apparate Marilla?” Anne sat at the kitchen table as Marilla made the tea.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't waste my time with such ridiculous forms of transportation.”</p><p> </p><p>“I'd love to fly. Just imagine being in the air! But it isn't quite the same as a bird! Oh how lovely it would be to be a bird.”</p><p> </p><p>“That's enough idle chatter.” Marilla said, after Anne had asked many, many questions.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I'm just so excited.”</p><p> </p><p>Just then Marilla’s brother, Matthew, stumbled into the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>“Matthew, this is Anne.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hello.” Matthew was a quiet man, only a few years younger than Marilla.</p><p> </p><p>“Matthew? Oh you're just like I imagined!” Anne leapt up to meet him. He didn't know what she had meant, but hoped it was a good thing.</p><p> </p><p>“I can't wait to learn everything about magic. I expect you know ever so much and can do so many wonderful things.”</p><p> </p><p>“We don't possess magic.” Marilla said curtly. “Our parents did, but for some reason we were born without it.  As a result we were shunned from the magical community, but Mr Dippet has been a loyal friend all these years.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, oh how awful!” Anne put her hand across her chest. “I had no idea.”</p><p> </p><p>“There now,” Matthew gently patted her shoulder. “We've had each other. And now we have you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Matthew, I believe we will be kindred spirits. I know what it is like to be alone.” Anne smiled, and wrapped her arms around him in a hug.</p><p> </p><p>He hesitated for a moment before returning it.</p><p> </p><p>“Off to bed with you.” Marilla waved a tea towel and Anne laughed. “We have an early day if we're to go into town and get you supplies for school. I've got a pattern for the robes but we'll have to buy a wand.”</p><p> </p><p>“A wand?!” Anne shouted. “I don't know how I'll possibly be able to sleep tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>“You'll try.” Marilla waved her off up the stairs.</p><p> </p><p>Anne didn't sleep a wink that night, certain that when she awoke she would be back in that orphanage.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Anne was up at daybreak, dressed and ready for the day.</p><p> </p><p>“Slow down, Anne. You'll choke on your food.” Marilla watched in horror as Anne practically inhaled her breakfast.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry Marilla. I'm just so excited.” She put down her fork.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, we'll go to Diagon Alley shortly.”</p><p> </p><p>Marilla cleared the table just when an owl hit against the window. Anne jumped up, terrified for the poor thing.</p><p>Marilla sighed and opened the window for the owl to hop inside.</p><p> </p><p>“I've told you to be careful.” Marilla scolded the owl. It was holding a letter in its talons.</p><p> </p><p>“Is he ok?” Anne rushed to the owl, gently petting its head.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. The silly thing never learns. But we've had him for years, and besides, a <em> good </em>owl costs far too much.” Marilla didn't look up from the letter as she spoke.</p><p> </p><p>The letter was merely Armando asking how Anne's first night had gone, and a reminder of everything they needed to get for Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>Matthew had to stay behind at the farm, so just Marilla and Anne made their way to Diagon Alley. They had to take a cart to where the nearest entrance to Diagon Alley was. Anne watched in awe as Marilla tapped a pattern on the bricks of a wall, and the wall then opened up to a secret street.</p><p> </p><p>The street was alive with colour and sound. For the second time Anne had been speechless. But Marilla didn't give her much time to stare as she lightly pulled Anne by the arm and they pushed through the bustling crowds. It was busy, seemingly everyone was out today getting their equipment for Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>The first stop was Borgin and Burke's, the bookshop. Marilla was talking to the man behind the counter, trying to find second hand versions of the textbooks. Anne allowed herself to wander around the store, her heart full at all the books she'd never even heard off. Her eyes caught a strange boy sitting by himself towards the back of the store. He was tall, but seemed around her age. His hair was a dirty blonde colour and his clothes were not the neatest. He had his head bent down as he scribbled something, but as Anne got closer she saw he was in fact sketching.</p><p> </p><p>“You're really good at drawing.” She said, and the boy looked up, eyes wide. “I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.”</p><p> </p><p>She crouched down next to him and he closed his sketchbook.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't really let people see my drawing…”</p><p> </p><p>“You should, you have a gift.”</p><p> </p><p>The boy shook his head. “My parents don't think so. They told me going to Hogwarts should straighten me out, get me to focus on the real things.”</p><p> </p><p>“You're going to Hogwarts too?” Anne smiled warmly and held out her hand. “I'm Anne Shirley.”</p><p> </p><p>The boy looked at her hand before hesitantly shaking it. “Cole Mackenzie…”</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps we'll see each other?”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe.” Cole smiled, seeming a little more comfortable.</p><p> </p><p>“Anne?” Marilla called throughout the book shop.</p><p> </p><p>“I have to go.” She jumped up. “But it was a pleasure to meet you Cole. I hope we'll be good friends.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marilla and Anne squeezed their way through the crowds, arms full of textbooks cauldrons and any other equipment Anne needed. But there was one final stop. Ollivanders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Ollivander family has been making wands for over a thousand years.” Marilla explained as they approached. “Every wizard in our family had a wand from Ollivanders. Well... except Matthew and I…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Behind the counter was a man slightly older than Marilla, but begin him was a younger boy maybe a few years younger than Anne. He seemed to be teaching the younger boy about wand types, but looked up when Anne and Marilla entered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Marilla Cuthbert? And who might this be?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mr Ollivander, this is the girl we've taken in. Anne Shirley. She's here to get her very own wand for Hogwarts.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ollivander looked intently at Anne, as if trying to study her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, Garrick.” He turned to the young boy, “What wand do you suggest?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy - Garrick Ollivander - followed his father's behaviour and stared intently at Anne. She felt uncomfortable under such a gaze.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps a cedar wand?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Anne was promptly handed a smooth wand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Give it a try.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked at Marilla and then waved it. But a bolt of light shot out the end and bounced off the walls causing everyone to duck.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm sorry!” Anne immediately handed the wand back. “I don't know what I'm doing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It's alright.” Ollivander laughed as he took the wand back. “The wand-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Chooses the wizard.” Garrick finished, smiling up at his father.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Exactly. He's going to take over the shop when I'm old.” Ollivander had a proud smile on his face, before searching for another wand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Try...redwood. To match that hair.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Anne scoffed at this, her hair a rather touchy subject. But she took the wand and something inside her just knew. She could almost feel the power she didn't know she possessed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, that's it.” Ollivander smiled. “Your wand has chosen you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marilla paid for the wand and they made their way back through Diagon Alley. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We better make haste, Matthew will be wandering where we are.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Marilla.” Anne said as they reached the wall they came in. “I've never had such lovely things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marilla didn't know what to say, she felt her heart melting. She had been hesitant about taking in a child, but Matthew had convinced her. And getting to know this girl, Marilla knew she was destined for greatness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She settled for “Come on, now.” but hoped Anne knew how much she was starting to like her.</span>
