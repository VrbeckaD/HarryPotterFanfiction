  <em>*Chime*</em>
</p>
<p>"Jim."</p>
<p>"Ignore it."</p>
<p>
  <em>*Chime chime*</em>
</p>
<p>"Jim..."</p>
<p>"Just ignore it, Spock."</p>
<p>"Ughnn...."</p>
<p>
  <em>*Chime Chime Chime*</em>
</p>
<p>"I cannot concentrate with that..."</p>
<p>James Tiberius Kirk sighed as he leaned away from the chest of his beautiful boyfriend, the chest that he'd just been kissing.</p>
<p>"Fine." He pulled his shirt back on enough to look presentable and went to the computer to answer the call.</p>
<p>"Jim, at least put some pants on."</p>
<p>"Hello, you've interrupted the great Captain Kirk, how can I help you?"</p>
<p>If it wasn't beneath a Vulcan to facepalm, Jim knew Spock would have at that moment.</p>
<p>As it was, he went so far as to close his eyes in pointed meditation so he wouldn't pinch the bridge of his nose. Jim felt like it was a victory.</p>
<p>Apparently, Pike had no compunctions about facepalming at Jim's dramatics and sighed deep into his hand.</p>
<p>“Jim, what am I going to do with you?”</p>
<p>“Admiral Pike!” Jim replied with enthusiasm, leaning forward in his desk chair. Pike was, after all, one of his favorite people. “What brings you to be interrupting my wonderful night?”</p>
<p>It was so hard for Spock, who was slowly buttoning his shirt back up, to not sigh. Why was he with this man again?</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I don’t come bearing good news,” began Pike, looking down at the PADD in front of him, “What do you remember about Billie Jean Miller?”</p>
<p>Jim reflected for a moment, looking to the ceiling in an attempt to access that part of his memory. He came up blank, so shrugged. “I’ve got nothing, who is she?”</p>
<p>Pike let out the sigh Spock was repressing as if their moods were connected but only the fully human admiral could give in to those urges.</p>
<p>“She’s the mother of Harry James P. Miller.” Jim waited for more since the name meant nothing to him. Funny that the kid’s middle name was the same as Jim’s fir--- “Your son.”</p>
<p>Jim froze.</p>
<p>His world was totally blank. Or white. Or blank.</p>
<p>SON?</p>
<p>HE HAD A SON!?</p>
<p>“WHAT!” Jim stood up and Pike turned away from the screen.</p>
<p>“Jim, put that thing away.”</p>
<p>… … …</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This has to be a mistake,” Jim pleaded, having finally put on some pants. Spock had vacated the room after Jim had managed to reboot his brain and function once more. “I can’t have a son, no way! I mean, I’m---...” ‘Well, Jim,’ his subconscious interrupted his verbal statement, ‘You’re more bi than gay, aren’t you?’ “I’m… fucked. </p>
<p>“Yup, Jimbo, you are.” Pike looked like he wanted to reach through the screen to comfort the starship captain, but clearly couldn’t. That technology didn’t exist … yet. “When Child Services contacted Starfleet, we ran all the necessary tests with the information we have on file. Harry is your son.”</p>
<p>Jim literally choked on his spit and coughed. Hearing those four words again was detrimental to his health! “I can’t have a kid!! I’m… I’m a Captain!”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t be the first Captain with a family, son.”</p>
<p>Jim looked like he was going to cry when Pike called him that. That’s probably why Pike did call him that. “What… Happened to … His mom?”</p>
<p>“Accident. She has no family left, from what we can see. That’s why they contacted us.” Pike poked a bit at the PADD in front of him and Jim’s own PADD chimed. “Your name is on the birth certificate.”</p>
<p>Slowly, Jim picked up his PADD and looked over the rather old fashioned birth certificate that appeared on the screen. There it was. James Tiberius Kirk listed as Father. Neither said anything as Pike sent over a few other things for Jim to look over, including a picture.</p>
<p>Blond hair.</p>
<p>Green eyes.</p>
<p>There was no denying that jaw.</p>
<p>This Harry kid was his son.</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>… … …</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Captain on the Bridge!”</p>
<p>“New orders,” Jim said as he sauntered to his chair, none of his prior distress showing on his face. “We’re returning to Starfleet. Sulu, book a course for the closest Starbase for refueling, then it’s back home, boys.”</p>
<p>Several surprised eyes turned to look at the captain as he lowered himself into his seat.</p>
<p>“Jim?” Spock probed, turning towards Jim.</p>
<p>“I’ll explain later, for now, let’s get going.”</p>
<p>“Yes-sir,” Sulu finally found his voice, turning towards his console to do as he had been directed.</p>
<p>It took Spock the longest to turn back around, but eventually, he too returned to work.</p>
<p>… … …</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“A son?” Bones asked, incredulous for all of a heartbeat before reconsidering, “Well, I’m not surprised.”</p>
<p>“HOW CAN YOU NOT BE SURPRISED!” Jim flew up from his chair, starting to pace all over again. Bones had just got him to sit down too. They were in Bones’ cabin, sharing a drink--or at least trying too.</p>
<p>“Jimmy, you do remember what you were like before Starfleet, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s… That’s besides the point!”</p>
<p>“No, that’s exactly the point. I’m shocked that you don’t have a legion of little blond-haired menaces running around.” Bones picked up the PADD that held Harry’s picture. He really did look like a Mini-Jim. But with Green Eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh god, what if I have a legion of blond-haired menaces!?” Jim grabbed his hair with both fists, tugging in despair.</p>
<p>“Woah! Calm down, Jim!” Bones shot to his feet, gently easing Jim’s fingers from his hair. “If you really had a legion of kids, the moms would have come forward already, what with you being the man who saved Earth. Twice. Not to mention the Kelvin baby.”</p>
<p>The scowl on Jim’s face was mighty impressive. He was struck with the random, odd thought of his legion of children manning the Enterprise with him at the helm, but the wonderful idea quickly turned into a nightmare when he remembered that they’d all be tiny, sticky, and break all the things.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no. That would be a NIGHTMARE.</p>
<p>“Ugh, I can’t believe Pike is making me go pick up the little devil!” Jim fell backward onto Bones’ bed, whining like the child he had just inherited.</p>
<p>“Is that why we’re going back to Earth?”</p>
<p>Jim let out an explosive breath and nodded. “We’ll be at dock for a few months while they outfit the ship to house families. They’re going to ask Sulu if he wants to bring his family on, as well as Harry, and a few other people too. I think that Smith person in the Science department…” His rambling continued, a sign of his stressed-out state.</p>
<p>“Jim,” Bones tried to interrupt. Keyword: Tried. “Jim,” He tried again. “Damnit, Jim, PAY ATTENTION!” Bones brought out his ‘dad’ voice, as Jim liked to call it since it always brought him to attention the way he figured it would when a Dad would talk to their kid. Like how Pike sometimes talked to hi-- wait, what?</p>
<p>“Damnit, Jim, I already said pay attention.”</p>
<p>“I am paying attention!”</p>
<p>“What did I just say?”</p>
<p>“.... Pay attention?”</p>
<p> “Before that?” Bones’ glare could skin a cat.</p>
<p>“.... It’s not as bad as you think?”</p>
<p>“... Lucky guess.” Jim sighed as Bones eased himself onto the bed next to him. “Jim, it’s going to be okay.”</p>
<p>“How can you know that?” Looking up, it was clear to see the desperation on Jim’s face. “How can you know? Bones… How can I look after a kid when I’m still just… a damned child myself? Don’t you always say that? That I’m a fucking child?” Slowly, Jim’s hands returned to gripping his hair tight, “How can I be ‘dad’ to Harry when I never had one…?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Jim…” Bones clasped his friend on the shoulder, giving it a hard squeeze. “Don’t worry so much Jim. You don’t have to have a father to be a father. Besides,” Bones gave Jim’s chin a tap, making him look up, “We’ll all be here to help.”</p>
<p>The look on gratitude was clear to see and Jim, being Jim, just tried to laugh it off. “Yeah. At least I know what not to do: Be like Frank. Also the common sense basics of ‘feed the kid,’ ‘ensure the kid is clean,’ ‘make him brush his teeth’ and ‘wash your hands’ that kind of stuff.”</p>
<p>“See?” Bones gave Jim a hard pat on the back, “You know half the stuff already. You’ll do great Jim.” Then Bones had the audacity to ruffle Jim’s perfect hair! Jim gave a shout and batted away Bones’ hands, grumbling all the while.</p>
<p>Bones was just happy that he had stopped Jim’s mind from spiraling, the way it could do sometimes after…</p>
<p>… … …</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It had taken them a bit longer to get back to Earth than they had anticipated. Two months had passed since Jim had first learned that he had a 5-year-old kid. The first month had been spent freaking out, and the second month had been spent dealing with the emergency that had happened on the way home.</p>
<p>Now they were back on Earth, even though it had only been a year since their 5-year mission had started. Considering Harry was born in ‘56, he must have been conceived right before Jim joined Starfleet… But Jim honestly couldn’t remember Billie Jean at all.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>The Enterprise had been docked in orbit so it could be fitted with the alterations. Scotty was heading the operation, naturally, as if he would let anyone truly harm their beautiful lady. The ship also had to be stocked with better resources because of the families that would be joining them.</p>
<p>A total of 10 families had agreed thus far, including the Sulus who they would be picking up at Yorktown after Ben settled some work conflicts, with an additional five potential candidate families.</p>
<p>It would take at least three months to implement all the changes, which felt like forever.</p>
<p>At the same time, Pike had made Jim promise he would meet with Harry and take him home for the first time. Spock, the bastard, had bailed on him to go meet with his own father.</p>
<p>“Don’t make such a long face, Jimmy,” Bones said from just behind him. Good, ole’ reliable Bones. Jim knew he could count on him. They were both wearing their dress uniforms since they were on the Starfleet base. Stupid regulations. “Wouldn’t want to frighten your son with such a scary look.”</p>
<p>When Jim’s face didn’t change, Bones poked him in the cheek, “Your face will get stuck that way if you don’t stop.”</p>
<p>“Shut up. You’re an asshole,” Jim retorted, tugging at his collar. “Why did we have to meet here?” He whined, unable to decide how to walk. He'd take a couple of quick steps, freeze, almost turn around, then determinedly move forward. Eventually, when he'd had enough of being laughed at by his friend, he just matched Bones' pace and did his best not to turn tail and run.</p>
<p>“Because your kid has been staying with Admiral Pike while we were making our way back to Earth. Also, we work here,” the ‘ya idiot’ was implied.</p>
<p>Jim pouted. He actually pouted. Bones smacked him on the back of the head and shoved him forward.</p>
<p>For Bones’ sanity, it was thankfully only a short distance until they reached Pike’s office. Jim hesitated outside the door, but he steeled his nerves and went inside.</p>
<p>“Ah, Jim. Late as usual.” Pike’s greeting wasn’t a shock, though Jim’s eyes were locked onto the tiny head of blond hair that had whipped around to face him when the door had opened.</p>
<p>Green and blue were locked together and the new father and son assessed one another. Bones and Pike both looked between them as if it were a tennis match, though probably one of the dullest in history since nothing was happening.</p>
<p>Then, finally, Harry stood up from where he was playing on a PADD, brushed off his pants, then smiled.</p>
<p>It was the same smile as Jim’s. His heart melted just a little bit.</p>
<p>“Hello,” Harry was staring at Jim’s feet. Before Jim could respond, Harry continued, “I’m Harry James P. Kirk. I’m so happy to meet you, Papa!” Then the blond menace launched himself at Jim, latching onto his legs.</p>
<p>“P-... Papa!?”</p>
