  <b>Chapter One: Prison Break</b>
</p>
<p>On Day 123 (or 124, or 125--he’d certainly lost track of a day or two in this perpetual doldrum), the prison bars opened of their own accord. He sat cross-legged on the floor of his cell, playing the game where he counted his breaths until he reached one thousand, when the reluctant groan of metal bars stopped him at four hundred seventy eight. </p>
<p>His muscles tensed. Constancy was a constant here. The inevitability of the morning sun ushering in his breakfast through the slot by the window and of eating alone, bathing alone, sleeping alone meant that he didn’t need to account for changes such as this. But now--the open bars, baiting him or inviting him or perhaps even punishing him. He didn’t know.</p>
<p>His survival instinct screamed at him to run, but he couldn’t trust his instincts. Not when he couldn’t even remember his own last name.</p>
<p>His first name had come to him about a month in. He awoke one morning uttering a single word: <em> Teddy </em> . Over and over again. He bathed under the spicket, the water beating his scalp and shoulders in tiny, ice-cold beads, <em> Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, </em> until he looked up at the pockmarked ceiling, wiped the water from his lashes, and knew.</p>
<p>“Teddy,” he said aloud. “Me.”</p>
<p>From there, the flashes came. He called them flashes because he couldn’t be sure they were memories; they weren’t long enough to be memories, or even dreams. They came in lightning bolts of sights and sounds. As he performed his evening routine of push ups against the cement floor, a flash of piano music came, ethereal and proud. As he tidied up after dinner, sliding his plate into the slot by the window sill, a flash of yellow and black came, woven into the fabric of a scarf.</p>
<p>They struck with intensity and longing. They struck without warning.</p>
<p>And most came with a vision of a single, glowing face framed in striking blond hair.</p>
<p>He felt like he knew this person, this face, but how could he know her when he--<em> Teddy </em>--was the only person in the entire world?</p>
<p>He sometimes pondered the likelihood of a world outside the four walls of his cell, but he couldn’t fully imagine it. He had been forged in this cell. It held him as a womb and on the day he opened his eyes, he became its only child--a human experiment, to learn and to grow and to breathe… alone. All he could remember resided in his cell. The cold, gray walls and the metal bars. The distant creaking of pipes and the inner workings of the cell as it shifted and danced around him almost imperceptibly. If the cell had created him, surely the cell itself held life. He could feel it. A quiet undercurrent.</p>
<p>So how could he leave? How could he get up and walk out of the only home he had ever known, even if the minutiae of living threatened to overwhelm in a moment’s breath? To leave his benevolent creator, who fed him and held him every day of his life, would be the ultimate betrayal.</p>
<p>But he also knew, deep inside of him, somewhere out of bounds, that he had lived before. And that life--whenever and wherever it had been--had been spectacular. It had something to do with the face from his flashes. The face that made him burn from the inside out.</p>
<p>As he contemplated his options, another flash struck. This time, it was a vision of a male figure, running through the hall of the prison, screaming in an echoing refrain.</p>
<p>“Save yourselves!”</p>
<p>The figure had hair caught between brown and blond, and a triumphant expression hung from his aristocratic features. Teddy marveled at how the flash kept going, now almost in slow motion, until he realized it wasn’t a flash at all but reality playing before him and he leapt up before consciously commanding his muscles to move. He took one step toward the exit and found himself, once again, hesitant.</p>
<p>His hesitation was all it took. The figure vanished, but not before turning to look over his shoulder, his eyes connecting with Teddy’s, pleading. He left only the echo of “Save yourselves” pounding through the prison like a headache.</p>
<p>How long Teddy stood there, he couldn’t tell. His world had shifted. He could feel it in the patterns and vibrations of his cell, which had altered, perhaps irreparably. He tried to make sense of this new reality, and felt anger humming in his veins. Anger at constancy for its failure.</p>
<p>He might have stood there indefinitely if it weren’t for the second flash--<em>no</em>, Teddy rebuked himself, <em>this is real. </em>And he was right. The voice that snaked through the prison this time did not pound but trill. A woman’s voice. Warm. Hesitant. And very real.</p>
<p>“Hello?” it called. “Is anyone else here?”</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to respond. Nothing came out. His tongue felt dry, his throat weak with disuse.</p>
<p>“Hello?” the voice called again, this time much closer.</p>
<p>Teddy managed to creep towards the mouth of his cell. He reached out for the open bars, his fingers just barely grazing them as the woman stepped into view wearing a matching gray jumpsuit and faraway expression. Her auburn hair hung in scraggly braids just above her waist. She saw him and attempted a smile.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it,” she breathed. He saw her fold minutely into herself. “I can’t--”</p>
<p>“Shit.” Another voice joined the cacophony. Teddy put his hands over his ears, his anger swelling at the disruption. It was too much, all at once. He wanted it to stop.</p>
<p>A man stepped into view, markedly younger-looking than Teddy felt himself to be, though equally as disheveled. He had long, honey-colored hair and thin, uneasy eyes. His mouth hung open as he surveyed the scene, taking in Teddy and the auburn-haired woman who seemed to curl even more inward.</p>
<p>“Shit,” he said again, stopping in the middle of the hall, at least six feet from the woman. “All this time, I thought I was alone.” He laughed--actually laughed--and Teddy felt his frown deepen. “Did you lot hear me talking to myself? I suppose it wasn’t to myself if you all were--I mean, did you hear me?”</p>
<p>The woman began shaking her head, shaking it and shaking it, until finally the man added, “What do you reckon?” He pointed in the direction of the fleeing figure and the woman stopped shaking her head to turn and look. Teddy looked, too. As he looked he could almost feel the remnants of the man’s warning as he fled from the prison. They clung to his skin like spider’s silk.</p>
<p>“Should we follow?” the woman asked. Teddy caught her gaze. Its intimacy struck him; she was asking him and him alone in a silent vote for his leadership.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure he wanted it.</p>
<p>“No,” Teddy said, firmly, surprised at the strength in his own voice.</p>
<p><em> Save yourselves </em>.</p>
<p>He contemplated bolting for the exit, leaving the two of them standing there stupidly to gape after him. Perhaps they’d follow, or perhaps they’d stay to… To what? To die? They deserved it, the intruders, for disrupting his home, his kingdom, where everything had a time and a place and it didn’t include these strangers.</p>
<p>But the thought burst like a bubble stretched thin under the weight of the sun, and the realization that he wasn’t the sort to abandon anyone hit him square in the chest.</p>
<p>He shook his head, not knowing where the realization had come from or if it was even true, only that he knew what he had to do, so he said, “We should check for others,” and he didn’t care if they followed him or not, only that this was right and leaving was wrong.</p>
<p>If Teddy expected dissent, he would have been pleasantly surprised at the nods he received from his two, sudden comrades. But he hadn’t been expecting dissent because he hadn’t been expecting anything. His mind still reeled from the explosion of sound and <em> change </em> still unfolding in the hall. He moved automatically. He felt separate from his body as it lead the woman with auburn hair-- <em> Calliope </em>, she introduced herself, though she quickly followed with, “I feel more like a Cal, but I don’t know why.” Teddy grunted in solidarity. He didn’t know why either, or where, or when.</p>
<p>They checked the hallway in vain, then turned down another, darker hall. Their footsteps dragged and shuffled. Teddy watched the others move and felt oddly <em> itchy </em>. They moved like him, as if the effort of moving shocked them just as much as the unreality of being among other things that moved.</p>
<p>The younger man introduced himself as <em> Lysander </em> and the revelation seemed to lift his demeanor, so Teddy reluctantly gave up his one and only secret, too.</p>
<p>“I’m Teddy,” he said, pressing his palm against the rough brick wall. Cal tapped on a pipe and Lysander peeked around a corner. They both nodded in gratitude as they accepted his name, then fell into a busy silence. Conversation seemed hardly sustainable when none of them had done much talking in the last 123 (124? 125?) days.</p>
<p>Then it struck Teddy. Had they all spent equal lengths in this prison? Had they all been isolated in their cells? Had they all seen the flashes? Had any of them seen something significant? A life, perhaps, outside of these walls?</p>
<p>And <em> why were they here? </em></p>
<p>Suddenly, Teddy yearned for nothing more than conversation. His willingness to share his solitary experiences surprised him, but more than that, he wanted to know the secrets of this place, and the life that slumbered just beyond the gray brick walls of his cell. He wanted to know all of this, and more--until he turned the corner and stumbled upon an open but clearly inhabited cell.</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly, almost calling out for the others, but compelled, somehow, to stay quiet.</p>
<p>His posture softened as he approached the cell and the figure inside. <em> She </em>--he noticed the feminine curve of the figure immediately--knelt on the floor with her head in her hands, sweeping locks of blond pouring over her wrists and elbows and knees.</p>
<p>Teddy sucked a breath in through tight lips.</p>
<p>“H-hello?” he offered.</p>
<p>Her head tilted back, lips slightly parted as her gasp hit the air with a hiss.</p>
<p>And he knew. He knew with a surety that struck like lightning, though he hadn’t known until this very moment. And so he whispered, calling out to her,</p>
<p>“Victoire?”</p>

  <b>PROJECT PROPOSAL</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>AZKABAN 2.0</b>
</p>
<p><b>Date: </b>2 Feb 1998</p>
<p><b>Project Requestor: </b>Emmanuel Brandt, Unspeakable, Space Department</p>
<p>
  <b>Statement of the Problem or Need:</b>
</p>
<p>The Second Wizarding War has brought into light the issue of alliances. Some breeds of creature and dark beings have joined the army of Death Eaters in supporting He Who Must Not Be Named in his mission to overtake the world, both magical and Muggle. One such dark being is the dementor, the guardians of Azkaban Prison, who have until now been neutral. The dementors of Azkaban have been persuaded by promises of power and esteem to join He Who Must Not Be Named and, as such, have fallen out of our bounds.</p>
<p>In light of this shift, the current structure of Azkaban Prison is called into question. The prison can no longer operate under the jurisdiction of a being so easily swayed. We cannot feel confident in placing dangerous criminals in the hands of beings who may, at a moment’s notice, release said criminals. It would be a disaster for the Ministry and a safety hazard for the world-at-large.</p>
<p>
  <b>Project Deliverables and Beneficiaries:</b>
</p>
<p>The end result of this project would be a space-saving, completely self-sufficient prison structure safe from the influence of dark beings and/or persons. All current functionality of Azkaban Prison (as a structure) would still exist.</p>
<p>
  <b>Special Provisions:</b>
</p>
<p>I. SPACE: The new Azkaban Prison structure would hold an infinite number of dark wizards and criminals, without the need for guards. A small department of supervisors would suffice to oversee operations.</p>
<p>The most innovative spellwork and charms, as explained in Anastasia Petteridge’s text <em> An Analysis of Universes: Experiments in Space and Time </em>, would be utilized to create a self-contained unit, accessible through a portal of sorts, similar to the veil in the Death Chamber (under the jurisdiction of the Department of Mysteries). Criminals would pass through this door and emerge in the realm of Azkaban 2.0, wherein they would be sorted into a cell and there remain until their sentence has been served in full.</p>
<p>This new framework would eliminate the need for a new, physical structure and would save space--not to mention it could be expanded without limit.</p>
<p>II. TIME: Within the prison, time would operate at a speed of 2:1 in relation to the outside world. As such, a one-year sentence in Azkaban 2.0 would equate to six months in the outside world. The individual’s experience of time would be of a year’s passage, but the subject would age by only six months. This would allow criminals to serve multiple life sentences within the constraints of real time</p>
<p>Days will self-regulate at exactly 24 hours and the prison’s mainframe will run a backdrop of sunrise and sunset, at a constant, neutral temperature.</p>
<p>III. THOUGHT: Two items are up for consideration in the department of Thought: (1) the inner-workings and logarithms of the prison itself, in order to make the project self-sufficient, and (2) control over the minds of the subjects, to limit instances of attempted escape or subversion.</p>
<ol>
<li>The prison must be programmed to operate without intervention. This includes the implementation of routine: the feeding of prisoners, the cleaning of cells, the implementation of days and nights, etc. The programming would allow the prison to think for itself in terms of operations, and to ensure that prisoners are kept isolated and contained.</li>
<li>The prisoners themselves would be erased of all memory upon entering the prison. Without memory or any tie to reality, their sentence could be served without incident.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  <b>Project Risks:</b>
</p>
<p>We run the risk of a tear in Space and/or Time, and thus this project would require experts in both departments (including experts in the department of Thought) working together to ensure nothing but the utmost care and consideration goes into the planning, design, and implementation of Azkaban 2.0.</p>
<p>Several trial runs would need to be conducted to ensure all operations are in working order.</p>
<p>Ethically, our trial runs would require willing and able participants. The isolation and memory erasure could be considered akin to torture, though in the punishment of criminals and dark wizards, such features are to be expected.</p>
<p>
  <b>Time Factors:</b>
</p>
<p>The time frame for planning, design, creation, testing, and implementation is anticipated to be between 20-30 years.</p>
