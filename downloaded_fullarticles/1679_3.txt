    <p>Harry watched on, jaw clenched and hands balled into fists as everyone celebrated the fact that he was put in Magical Suppressors for allegedly being a flight risk to the Wizarding community; he looked at everyone's faces to see his so-called best friends basking in the fame of getting him convicted.</p><p>He watched on as Snape smirked in triumph, Dumbledore looking on with a disappointed yet smug look on his face and a smattering of people which included some Slytherins, Luna Lovegood and Neville Longbottom looked at him with sadness and pity in their eyes.</p><p>Harry had to snort at the fact that he had just defeated Voldemort barely 24 hours ago before they decided that he was too powerful to continue walking around doing as he liked.</p><p>He really wasn't that surprised, they've turned on him so much that it was to be expected. He was still wondering how Dumbledore and Snape managed to fake his death so well but he didn't really care enough to try and figure it out.</p><p>"Harry James Potter!"</p><p>He merely rolled his eyes as Fudge eyed him smugly, reading from the scroll in his hands.</p><p>"You are hereby sentenced to death by the Veil for your crimes against the Wizarding World and for being too immersed in the Dark Arts pass the point of saving!"</p><p>Harry scoffed at that. Trust Dumbledore to fabricate some mumbo jumbo about him being Dark. The old bastard really wanted to relive his glory days by getting rid of Harry, but what can he expect after the man left him with the Dursleys and put him through all those trials?</p><p>Lucky for him, he had seen this coming so he'd already emptied every damn thing he had in Gringotts with the promise that it would go right back in under a different name.</p><p>Of course he wouldn't have been so prepared if it wasn't for the help of Luna who as it turned out had some Seer ability and was able to warn him a couple weeks before. Harry really was glad that he'd befriended the girl because he really couldn't have been more luckier than he was.</p><p>As he looked on at the faces of those who betrayed him, he couldn't help the small smirk which flitted across his face. He couldn't wait to let them pay. Ginny looked sad but Harry knew it was because she hadn't managed to steal his money after failing countless times to dose him with Love potions. George looked at him blankly, as if it was his fault that Fred died.</p><p>Did they think him to be a fucking God or something? Like he could prevent everyone dying. It was war for crying out loud. Even gentle Hagrid wasn't looking at him and if he hadn't had weeks to prepare himself then it would've hurt but right now, Harry couldn't wait to get thrown into the Veil.</p><p>Luckily for him, after he had offed Voldemort, he had received the Slytherin vault by right of conquest and found something inside the vault which would help him have revenge on everyone. Well, almost everyone.</p><p>Harry's eyes connected with beautiful Hazel ones and he couldn't help reassuring him with a small smile which wasn't returned. He knew how much his beloved was hurting right now but it would be for the best in the long run.</p><p><em>'I Love You,'</em> He mouthed slowly and receiving the same in return before the other turned his face away. Harry could see the tears flowing down his face as he held his distended stomach carefully and his heart clenched painfully.</p><p>It hurt to know that he wouldn't be there for his child's birth but as he was being hustled towards the Anti-Apparition Wards, he knew that he'd try his best to have this all again but in a better scenario. He didn't want his child to grow up in this mess. He'd receive help from Draco and the other Slytherins when he'd explain his plan to them.</p><p>Surprisingly, he got on better with them than he ever did with the Gryffindors. They didn't force him into anything he didn't want nor try to tell him how to live his life. As much as a little shit Malfoy was, he was simply insulted that he rejected his handshake and offer at friendship more than anything.</p><p>His last thought as he was whisked away to the Ministry was:</p><p>Some Wizarding Families really were better than others.</p><p align="center">

</p><p>He hardly stumbled as he appeared in the Ministry because of the bruising grip on either side of his body from Tonks and Kingsley.</p><p>He simply allowed them to mistreat him as they entered the elevator along with Fudge and practically half of Wizarding Britain who wanted to see 'Dark Lord' Potter thrown into the Veil like the scum he is.</p><p>Harry really couldn't wait to be thrown in. His plan should work out without a hitch as he'd practically memorised the tomes which he had found in both Slytherin and Gryffindor vaults. Wasn't that a surpriseâ€¦ He was related to two of the founders and he couldn't be happier, now, he had more ownership over Hogwarts than Dumbledore or the Ministry. With Luna on his side then they would pretty much control Hogwarts. The Hufflepuff Heir wasn't really important as both Harry and Luna could win him or her in any ownership battle as Slytherin, Gryffindor and Ravenclaw had more influence than them.</p><p>He had found two separate books in the Slytherin and Gryffindor Vaults which were in-depth information about the Veil buried under layers upon layers of Blood Wards. They needed people who had the blood of all the founders to access but Harry and Luna managed to narrow it down to both of them so that they could override the Hufflepuff blood being needed. It was a tedious task but necessary and boy were they elated at their discovery.</p><p>He barely grunted as he was slammed into the Elevator and everyone purposefully dug their elbows into his sides.</p><p>How childish.</p><p>They had to commission the help of Gringotts of which the Goblins were still very salty that he and his ex-friends had managed to break into the bank, but he had simply paid for the damages done and he was rather surprised that it didn't cost more, but then again, Wizarding money had a higher rate than Muggle money.</p><p>That was how Harry realised that he was being robbed every time he bought anything as everyone knew he grew up in the Muggle world. He was a bit angry but knew that he would get his revenge.</p><p>As the elevator stopped on the floor of the Department of Mysteries he felt a fluttering in his stomach. Of course he was nervous, who wouldn't? Normally Wizards and Witches would be thrown to death in here but he was lucky enough to know how to avoid the same fate.</p><p>He had found the schematics of creating the Veil and now understood why Magical Creatures despised Wizards and Witches. Harry was ashamed to even be the same species as Wizards and Witches. They were simply despicable for what they've done to create the Veil. He swore that he would try his best to make sure that Magical Creatures were treated better.</p><p>Harry didn't know what he would do if anyone sacrificed his beloved or their unborn child just to create something like the Veil. He would probably go on a killing rampage and of that he was certain.</p><p>He ignored the ton of crap coming out of all the traitors and Fudge's mouth and instead focused his attention on the Veil and couldn't help the way he smiled. Who would've thought that being sent to his death was actually a good thing.</p><p>His hands clenched and he smiled as he felt the pulse in both hands. These Magical artifacts embedded in his hands and Magical core were the keys to survive the Veil. They would help to circumvent the power of the Veil to send him to the past insteaf off to Purgatory. Harry shuddered at even meeting some of the nutcases in there if he didn't have the Artifacts.</p><p>He didn't want to go to an alternate dimension because everything would still be the same in this dimension and Harry refused to have his beloved be a single parent or have his friends suffer anymore than they had to. He knew what he was getting into and he couldn't wait.</p><p>He sighed softly as he was pushed towards the Veil by Kingsley. He inwardly snorted. As if he couldn't escape these suppressors. They were commissioned for the average Wizard and Witch, so why haven't they got it through their thick heads that Harry was far from average?</p><p>It worked in his favor but Harry couldn't help but be disgusted with how stupid the majority of Wizarding Britain was.</p><p>He was standing right in front of the Veil before Kingsley forcefully turned him around to face everyone.</p><p>"Any last words Potter?" Fudge asked pompously amidst camera flashes.</p><p>He ignored him and instead focused on beautiful Hazel eyes and smiled.</p><p>"See you soon!" Without another word, he wrenched himself out of Kingsley's grasp, unapologetically throwing him into the Veil. He then broke the shackles before throwing himself backwards into the Veil, quickly activating the Artifacts before anyone could so much as react.</p><p>The last thing he saw was his beloved's tear stained cheeks.</p><p>
  <em>'I Love You.'</em>
</p><p>He smiled at that.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>XxXxXxXxXx</strong>
</p><p>Harry closed his eyes as the Magic of the Artifacts surrounded him and he thought about returning to his Eleven year old body. The book specified that he had to think hard about what he wanted or the Artifacts would simply dump him anywhere.</p><p>
  <em>'I want to be Eleven again.'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>'I want to be Eleven again.'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>'I want to be Eleve-'</em>
</p><p>He was abruptly cut off as he felt searing hot pain envelope his body as he was wrenched in every direction possible before a bright white light surrounded him and he lost consciousness.</p>
