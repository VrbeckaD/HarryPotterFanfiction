    <hr/><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>                Upon opening her eyes, Sirina “Ri” Potter-Black found she’d been reincarnated once more. She’d found that her reincarnations tended to go one of two ways. One: she was born, lived until her brain was developed enough to start gaining her memories slowly, until she was entirely herself again. Or two: some sort of life-threatening event forced her core soul to intervene and use magic and flames to reawaken her entire self at a young age.</p><p>                Thanks to the vaunted “Potter luck”, the second option happened far more often than she’d like. Mainly because that meant more life-threatening situations. As she stared down at her tiny hands laying in her lap on the hospital bed, she was guessing this was one of the latter times when she’d fully awoken young. She recognized the hospital right away from the clues the room and the bed gave her. The machines next to the bed, and hooked up to Ri herself told her she was not in the wizarding world, or with any version of her Dursley ‘relatives’. The off-white leaning towards light blue walls and the light gray leaning towards purple tiles on the floor told her she was in Konoha’s hospital. When Sarutobi Hiruzen, Hokage of Konohagakure walked slowly into her room and tried to give her a gentle smile, Ri full-on snarled at the old man. She wasn’t surprised, though. Her tiny hands clearly stated her current body was very young. Maybe five years old, if that. So of course the old man was still alive in this world.  Not that Ri was unhappy to see her “<em><span title="“Gramps/Old man">Jiji</span></em>.” She did love him after all. No, she snarled for a different reason altogether. The reason: she knew her life was going to be horrible until at least after she graduated the academy.</p><p>                True, Ri had only lived this type of life once before, but she knew what life was like as “Naruko” Uzumaki. It said something that both lifetimes she’d awoken early. In her defense, her first incarnation as Naruko she’d gone pretty much how the original Naruto’s world did, excepting that she was a girl (not that Ri knew this). This time she had no intention, whatsoever, of living that same life again. Not even when she’d already been reincarnated.</p><p>                “Naruko?” The Hokage asked in a grandfatherly tone. Ri glared right at the old man.</p><p>                “Save it, <em><span title="“Gramps/old man">Jiji</span></em>. Those idiots almost killed me again! I’m <em>sooooo</em> not putting up with this!” She snarled. The old man in question blinked, a bit taken aback.</p><p>                “Naruko,” He started to ask, but Ri cut him off.</p><p>                “Naruko is a dumb name. I refuse to be called the feminine version of fish cakes.” She informed him.* The old man’s eyebrows flew up towards his hairline, but he seemed to decide to humor the child. Well, he decided to humor her after checking to ensure she was in fact Naruko. He shuddered as his chakra touched her and encountered both Naruko’s soft blue chakra and the corrosive chakra of the <em><span title="“demon/energy beast">bijuu</span></em>.</p><p>                “Oh? And what would you like to be called?” He asked softly.</p><p>                “Ri. Uzumaki Ri.” She declared grandly. The old man looked subtly to the ANBU hiding in one of the upper corners of the room, and Ri smirked to herself as the ANBU signed back he didn’t know why the change had taken place. No intruders and no suspicious or indeed any visitors other than nurses and doctors since this particular ANBU’s watch began.</p><p>                “Very well….Ri.” The Hokage agreed. “I am glad to see you feeling better. I’ve come to escort you home.” He told her softly. “I thought we might get ramen on our way.” He suggested. Ri looked at him thoughtfully with her head tilted to the side. She knew he expected her to cheer, and maybe even hop from the hospital bed. But Ri really didn’t feel like it.</p><p>                “Could we pick up some fruits, veg, rice, and beans instead? Maybe even some meat?” She asked hopefully. The Hokage frowned at her. Apparently ‘Naruko’s obsession with Ramen was already a fixture in this world. Of course, that could be because no one else she could afford would let her eat in their restaurants. <em>“Stupid prejudiced sheeple.”</em> She grumbled to herself.</p><p>                “Don’t you want Ramen?” He asked her while signing to one of his guards to fetch a Yamanaka. Ri wanted to roll her eyes, but refrained because she shouldn’t know ANBU sign language. Instead Ri shrugged.</p><p>                “Ramen’s nice, but I can only get one meal with you. If you go with me, I can get a whole week’s worth of groceries that won’t go bad. And no one will sell me bad food, ‘cuz they won’t want to do that in front of the Hokage.” She replied truthfully just as Yamanaka Inoichi entered the room silently. Both men frowned at her words, even Inoichi who only heard the tale end of her explanation.</p><p>                “Ri, you’ve taken a bump on the head recently. That’s how you got into the hospital. So Inoichi here is going to check your head to make sure we didn’t miss any damage.” Sarutobi informed his young ward. This time Ri couldn’t help but roll her eyes.</p><p>                “Yeah, sure. If by ‘taken a bump on the head’ you mean an angry civilian decided to bash my head with a shovel.” She retorted sarcastically, but nevertheless she turned her eyes to Inoichi. To her surprise, however, a moment later the blond man was screaming on the floor, clutching his head. She turned to look questioningly at the Hokage, but the ANBU watching her from the corner of the room caught her and placed her into a hold with her arms held behind her back. All of this took place in mere seconds, and then Inoichi quieted.</p><p>                “Not her fault.” He panted. “Fox apparently protects her mind. Definitely it’s chakra that attacked me.” He informed the Hokage and ANBU. The Hokage frowned at the man’s words, watching the man pull himself together and up off the floor.</p><p>                “Fox? What fox? Why would a fox be in my head?” She questioned, in (pretend) innocence. The Yamanaka winced, but the Hokage didn’t miss a beat.</p><p>                “Fox is a codeword, my dear. It simply means he wasn’t forced to say you are who you appear to be.” The Hokage informed her gently. Ri frowned at him, but kept her silence. She had to hand it to the old man, he was a pretty good liar. If she’d really been five, as her body suggested, she probably would have believed him.</p><p>                “Do people sell you bad food often?” The Hokage asked quietly, looking very sad.</p><p>                “Why do you think I like getting Ramen so much?” She retorted, and the old man winced. “I know you can’t always come shopping with me, but I figured it couldn’t hurt to ask this once.” Ri added softly. The Hokage nodded shortly.</p><p>                “Let’s go, Naruko. We’ll get groceries <em>and</em> ramen.” He promised. Ri sighed internally, but gave him what he expected.</p><p>                “Yatta!” She exclaimed, and jumped from the bed. “And I <em>told </em>you, my name’s <strong><em>Ri</em></strong> now!” She added with a scowl as she grabbed his hand and jumped up and down next to her <span title="“Gramps/old man"><em>Jiji</em> while they left the hospital.</span></p><p>                “My apologies, Ri.” Sarutobi chuckled as they entered the street.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>                Ri had to admit, shopping with the Hokage was certainly an experience. Not only did they give the pair good, un-expired food, but they actually lowered their prices instead of raising them! Ri couldn’t help the fact that her mouth remained dropped open almost the whole time. As the Hokage set groceries on her counter, Ri looked up at him and gave him her most innocent puppy-dog pout.</p><p>                “<em><span title="“Gramps/old man">Jiji</span></em>? Do you think instead of body-guards I can have someone to get groceries for me?” She asked innocently. The old man chuckled, but Ri could hear how forced the chuckle was. She was glad to note he wasn’t glossing over how not a single of the shops workers would acknowledge Ri was even there. Even when she held out money to pay for the groceries, they would only acknowledge her if the Hokage made a point of it.</p><p>                “No, Ri. The bodyguards stay. You need them, as yesterday and the shovel incident proved.” The Hokage sighed. Ri gave him another innocent look.</p><p>                “But <em>whyyyyyy?</em>” She whined. “Only one of them even does his job. The others don’t care if people hurt me. It’s not like it’s the first time I’ve been hit by a shovel.” She added petulantly. Suddenly killing intent filled the room.</p><p>                “<strong>What</strong>?” He demanded flatly. Ri made it a point to huddle on the floor and start babbling apologies. Although she <em>could</em> have easily withstood that amount of killing intent, no normal five-year-old could have. Instantly Sarutobi Hiruzen reigned in his killing intent.</p><p>                “I’m sorry, Ri. I’m not mad at you.” He promised, and then he knelt next to her and helped her stand once more. “How do you know only one of the ANBU do their jobs? Are you sure they aren’t just missing a few things?” He asked gently. Ri shook her head.              </p><p>                “I’m usually watched by Dog, Monkey, and Goat in shifts. And I know ‘cuz I can spot them real easy, ‘specially if they’re looking at me. And I don’t get hurt when Dog watches me. Not ever. He even stopped me from tripping down the stairs the other day, and that was my fault!” She responded instantly with a little huff.</p><p>                “And what guard is watching you today?” He asked calmly, but Ri could tell the man was somewhat stunned by the way his eyes had widened as she rattled her summary off.</p><p>                “Well, it <em>was</em> Monkey in the hospital, but right now it’s Dog. And he feels angry.” She added thoughtfully as she felt his chakra radiating from him.</p><p>                “A natural sensor.” The Hokage breathed in amazement. Ri could practically <em>see</em> the wheels turning in his head, putting together all the times her younger, memory-less self had mentioned things she could ‘sense’. It was true Ri was a natural sensor type, so she wasn’t worried about fulfilling a lie. It just happened to help her with what she wanted to accomplish.</p><p>                “How about I assign one of your guards to do a grocery run once a week, and replace both Monkey and Goat?” He offered calmly.</p><p>                “Yatta! Fresh groceries every week!” She exclaimed before doing a little dance around her kitchen. “Fresh groceries for Ri-chan!” She chanted loudly while she jumped around. A sense of both amusement and sadness wafted off both Dog and the Hokage while she did her strange jump-fest. Suddenly a thought hit her.</p><p>                “Can I try them out, see who the good guards really are before you permanently assign them, <em><span title="“Gramps/old man">Jiji</span></em>?” She demanded. More amusement wafted off her <em><span title="“Gramps/old man">Jiji</span></em> and Dog.</p><p>                “I don’t think so, Ri.” <em><span title="“Gramps/old man">Jiji</span></em> replied with another chuckle, though this one was less forced.</p><p>                “But how do you know they’ll do a good job like Dog, and not a bad one like Monkey and Goat?” She demanded, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>                “Because I’ll be assigning three special ANBU to you. Would you like to meet them?” The Hokage replied as his eyes practically lit up with an idea. Ri considered that.</p><p>                “O-kay.” She sighed at last. “But I reserve the right to whine at you if I end up in the hospital again ‘cuz they don’t like me like almost everyone else.” She added petulantly, but dropped her arms. Her <em><span title="“Gramps/old man">Jiji</span></em> made a couple ANBU signs, and Ri bounced up and down on her toes, smiling secretly to herself as she interpreted what he said:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p> <em>Summon ANBU: Weasel, Crow, Tiger*</em></p>
  <p>
    <em>Message: Get Here Yesterday, new long-term mission, stay hidden on arrival</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>As soon as Sarutobi’s fingers stopped flicking, one of his own guards vanished from her awareness in a shunshin.</p><p>                “Hey <em><span title="“Gramps/old man">Jiji</span></em>?” Ri asked, lacing her hands together behind her head and giving him a grin.</p><p>                “Yes, Naruko?” He asked absently, and she scowled at him.</p><p>                “It’s <em>Ri!</em>” She reminded him, and she sensed confusion from Dog up on the ceiling. Then shook off her grumpy and continued “Will you teach me the hand talk?” At her words the Hokage looked at her in surprise.</p><p>                “Hand talk? Oh, you mean the signs ANBU use to communicate? Sorry, but those are only for ANBU and Hokages.” Sarutobi laughed. Ri pouted at him.</p><p>                “But what if one of my guards wants to tell me something?” She protested.</p><p>                “Then they’ll use words.” He replied patiently, and Ri pouted again. Then she sensed four chakra bodies enter her awareness again.</p><p>                “There are four new people, <em><span title="“Gramps/old man">Jiji</span></em>. Did you want me to identify them, too?” She asked cheekily.</p><p>                “Can you?” He replied, looking startled.</p><p>                “Uh-huh.” She agreed. “There’s the ANBU who left after your hand-talk,” She began, and felt both Dog/the Hokage’s amusement and the four ‘new’ people’s confusion. “He came back, and then there’s …”Ri’s brain froze for a moment as her brain helpfully reminded her that she shouldn’t actually know whatall the masks were, being only a five-year-old civilian. The masks were made to be hard to identify for people who didn’t know the codenames that go with them.</p><p>                “..Well, I don’t know their real names, but there’s the one I call ‘pointy dog-face, but not dog’, and also ‘bird’. Oh, and ‘boy cat’. Cuz there’s two cats, but only one of them’s a girl.” She continued. She hoped she’d come up with an explanation quickly enough, but looked up hopefully at <em><span title="“Gramps/old man">Jiji</span></em>.</p><p>                “I guess the ability to sense chakra doesn’t give you the ability to know their codenames, huh?” Hiruzen mused with a chuckle.</p><p>                “<em><span title="“Gramps/old man">Jiji</span></em>? What do you mean about sensing chakra?” She wondered, hoping he’d give her a nice explanation for others.</p><p>                “Nothing you need worry about for now, Ri.” He tried to placate her. Ri scowled at him but fell quiet.</p><p>                “And at least two of them were correct, although I’m not sure bout the ‘dog-but-not-dog’.” The hokage laughed as he signed for the three new people to come down into view. Then, one-by-one he introduced them.</p><p>                “This is Tiger, or ‘boy cat’.” He began with a laugh. Ri winced internally, having a feeling she was probably being glared at from behind a porcelain mask. “This is crow, or ‘bird’ as you called him. And this is Weasel.” He finished. Ri bowed politely to the three ANBU members.</p><p>                “Please take good care of me.” She intoned formally. All three of them blinked behind their mask, and the feelings of curiosity and confusion echoed off their chakra. The Hokage looked please at Ri’s manners. Turning to the ANBU, he ordered clearly.</p><p>                “Some of Naruko’s…” he started to say, but Ri cleared her throat meaningfully. “Apologies, some of <em>Ri’s</em> guards decided that they did not wish to follow the Hokage’s orders.” He informed them flatly, and Crow winced. The hokage nodded seriously. “Obviously they have been relieved of their mission, amongst other things. You three are now being added as her guards along with Dog. Dog will be the mission leader for as long as you four are her guards. At least once a week one of you will be responsible for getting groceries for Ri, including everything a growing girl needs. There will also be periodic clothing shopping, and shopping for supplies. I will also have one of you make sure the landlord is paid each month and that the man is keeping up with fixing anything broken. The shopping will eventually include supplies for school when she starts at the academy next year. I will supply the money for these things, so one of you will see me once a week.” He added sternly. All three of the visible ANBU bowed solemnly. The Hokage nodded to them once more and turned back to Ri.</p><p>                “Ri, if for any reason you do not get groceries or other supplies you need, come straight to me and let me know.” He ordered her.</p><p>                “Yes, <em><span title="“Gramps/old man">Jiji</span></em>.” Ri replied in a more subdued tone than usual.</p><p>                “Now, I’m sorry Ri, but I need to get back to my office. Unfortunately paperwork waits for no one, not even the Hokage.” The old man sighed regretfully.</p><p>                “Yes, <em><span title="“Gramps/old man">Jiji</span></em>.” She replied in an even more saddened tone, and the Hokage bent down to give the girl a hug and kiss on the cheek before he left. He was almost out of the apartment when he turned back to the three ANBU still standing in the middle of the living room.</p><p>                “I expect you to take this time to find out what types of things Ri would like in her groceries so that some of that can be included in the necessaries like vegetables, meat, and so-on. Also, please find out if she is short on any basic necessities right now like toothpaste or toilet paper. I trust I don’t need to tell you that Dog will assign shifts?” The Hokage mused before he turned forward and left the apartment altogether. Ri looked up at the ANBU that remained, not including the Hokage’s guard who left with the old man. The ANBU still in the room, including Dog, looked down at Ri. She cocked her head to the side.</p><p>                “I like Veggies, Fruit, and meat. Sometimes I like ramen, but I’ve been told it’s not very good to have it too often if I want to grow into a big and beautiful Kunoichi.” Ri informed the ANBU. Then she went into one of her kitchen drawers and pulled out some parchment and a pen. She held out the items.</p><p>                “I’d make the list for you, but I don’t know how to read or write yet.” She informed them cheerfully. “Do they teach that at the academy?” She added cheerfully. The ANBU looked at each other hesitantly, except for Dog who dropped from the ceiling to crouch down by Ri and took the proffered items.</p><p>                “<em><span title="“Gramps/old man">Jiji</span></em> said I can’t learn hand-talk, so if you want to talk to me, he said you can. If you need to ask something or tell me something.” Ri added helpfully. Dog handed the parchment and pen to Crow, who sat cross-legged at her traditional table.</p><p>                “Veggies, Meat, Fruits, a few cup ramen. Anything else for food? Any desserts you like?” Crow asked calmly.</p><p>                “Um…”Ri mused as she rocked on her toes. “I like to make my own dessert, sometimes. I could use flower, rice, red beans, pudding, and barbecue sauce. Fish isn’t bad…um…I don’t like sushi.” She rattled off before taking a breath. “I need both toothpaste <em>and</em> toilet paper, and I could use a toothbrush, too. I also need cleaning supplies, cuz I’m almost out. It would be nice if the kitchen sink was fixed so I don’t have to use bathroom water, but I’ll live if it isn’t.” She added just as quickly.</p><p>                “Need new clothes?” Crow asked calmly. Ri looked down at her pants, which were a size too small and only came down to her mid-shins now. They had drowned her when she got them. Her shirt was also getting a little short and tight as well, she noted with a stretch.</p><p>                “Um…are you sure I can get clothes too? That’s an awful lot of stuff!” Ri replied immediately, doing her best to imitate Hinata when the girl was younger by poking her fingers together and staring down at them shyly.</p><p>                “You can. Hokage’s orders.” Dog replied immediately.</p><p>                “That’s right, Hokage’s orders. We could get you some thing beside orange, if you like?” Crow immediately agreed. Ri scrunched up her nose and shook her head.</p><p>                “No, it has to be orange!” She protested. She could practically feel the curiosity dripping off the other four people, so she added. “Technically it’s supposed to be amber, with accents in purple, indigo, and/or white.” She corrected. “Oh, and the Uzumaki spiral so it stands out, of course.” She added as she felt their curiosity rise.</p><p>                “Why those colors?” Tiger asked her.</p><p>                “’Cuz those are my colors by Clan tradition! <em><span title="“Believe it!">Dattebayo!</span></em>” Ri replied. “And I can’t tell someone who’s not clan any more than that!” She added sternly to their unabated curiosity.</p><p>                “And who told you your clan traditions?” Dog asked in a bit of a growl, likely thinking some had lied to her. Ri grinned cheerfully at the old man.</p><p>                “Kaa-san told me.” She replied, looking up at Dog seriously. He crouched once more.</p><p>                “Ri, your Kaa-san died just after before you were born.” He said seriously.</p><p>                “Yes. That’s why she’s a ghost who only visits me when I dream. Or have really bad tummy-aches that make me sleepy.” Ri replied, rolling her eyes as though it ought to be obvious.</p><p>                “Then what’s your Kaa-san’s name? Does your otou-san ever visit?” Dog asked gently.</p><p>                “My Kaa-san’s name is Uzumaki Kashina, the former Uzumaki princess. That’s why I’m the current Uzumaki princess and get body guards from ANBU, just like a princess! Otou-san doesn’t visit, because Shin said Otou-san was naughty and used a bad ritual so he’s in time-out. Kaa-san was sad when Shin said that…but she didn’t argue. I can tell you his name, though! Kaa-san said I get my blond hair from Otou-san! Kaa-san said Otou-san’s name is Minato, but she wouldn’t tell me his family name. But since I have Kaa-san’s clan name, I know Otou-san must not come from a clan like Kaa-san.” Ri babbled, and she had a feeling she’d overwhelmed the poor men listening to her. She cursed her babbling child-ness. Although she was truthfully (in soul) much older than five years old, her body was only five and so it sometimes made her act…well…childish. Including spouting more information than she really should. Or wanted to. Apparently at least Crow kept up with her babbled explanation, though, for he asked her gently:</p><p>                “And who is Shin?” At his question, Ri made a face.</p><p>                “Shin is just what I call him. Kaa-san said his real name is <em><span title="cutsy age misunderstanding. It’s actually: shinigami (also, Japanese Death God)">Shingummi</span></em>, and he’s the one who put the monster in my tummy that makes my tummy hurt sometimes. Kaa-san also said that’s why sheeple like the people in Konoha don’t like me. Cuz they’re afraid of my tummy-monster. That’s why she comes and talks to me when my tummy hurts. She helps make the monster be good and go back to sleep.” She babbled. She cursed her running mouth, knowing that everything she said would be reported to the Hokage soon.</p><p>                “I see.” Dog stated flatly. “Groceries have already been taken care of for this week, so Tiger can take care of getting the regular supplies, while Crow and Weasel help put all the groceries away. When the groceries are away, Crow and Weasel will take her to get clan-appropriate clothing. If they give you trouble, inform them you report directly to Hokage-sama.” Dog ordered flatly. “I will discuss regular shifts and other details with you later. Tiger, Weasel, Crow. You three will all be responsible for teaching Ri to read and write before the academy. Since Hokage-sama has not prepared other teachers, we will take over that job. Weasel, you excel at aim with thrown weapons. I will expect you to pass that skill on to Ri. Crow, you will teach Ri how to access her chakra and work on chakra control. I expect her to at least be walking up trees and on water before the academy, given your excellent control over your own chakra. Tiger, I expect you to teach Ri the basic katas for taijutsu, and also work on physical conditioning. I need to report to Hokage-sama.” Dog finished. The other three ANBU bowed to him, and then both Dog and Tiger shunshin-ed away.</p><p>                Crow and Weasel both moved into the kitchen and began to help her put groceries away. Ri helped when they didn’t know where something went, but overall she sat on the counter where Crow put her when she kept getting in their way. When they were finished Weasel picked her up and gently placed her on his hip. Crow checked that the front door was locked (it was). Then they both body-flickered to the market street. Ri thought about protesting about being carried, but truthfully her little legs were tired after shopping with her <em><span title="“Gramps/old man">Jiji</span></em>. Instead she clung onto Weasel like a little monkey. Both Weasel and Crow seemed to know where they were going, so Ri assumed they were going to a clothing shop they were familiar with. For a short time she watched the dirt passing under their feet, nostalgically missing cobbled roads and lack of dust. It was better to watch the ground, or even close her eyes, than to watch the people around them. People who glared at her if they saw her. With those thoughts she did close her eyes and tuck her face into Weasel’s side until she heard the jingle of a bell and felt the coolness of being inside. Then she opened her eyes and found herself in what looked like a seamstress’ shop.</p><p>                "<em><span title="Welcome to the store/Come on in!">Irasshaimase!</span></em>" A woman called from the back as she bustled out from what was, presumably a storeroom or office. The woman saw the ANBU first, and then she spotted Ri and her smile faltered slightly. “Orphans cannot afford custom clan clothes, ANBU-san.” She scolded the ANBU, her mouth trembling slightly.</p><p>                “Orphans who are the last member of their clan can. Besides, the bill goes to the Hokage. Hokage’s orders.” Weasel replied flatly in a monotone.</p><p>                “H..hai.” The woman replied, looking slightly friendlier. “And what clothes will the…will <em><span title="“young lady">ojou-sama</span></em> be getting?” She asked Weasel, focusing on him as the one in charge.  Ri replied before either ANBU could relay her earlier words.</p><p>                “Ri-chan needs the Uzumaki special, as layed down by Mito-<em><span title="“Grandmother/old woman">obaa-sama</span></em>!” Ri chirruped cheerfully at the woman. The woman seemed to light up.</p><p>                “Oh! It’s been so long since we’ve had the Uzumaki special ordered!” The woman exclaimed excitedly. “Do you know your colors already, <em><span title="“young lady">Ojou-sama</span></em>?” the woman asked, seeming truly excited as she went over to her sales counter and opened a book. Ri nodded but waited until the woman’s pen was ready.</p><p>                “Ri-chan’s main color is amber.” Ri replied cheerfully.</p><p>                “And your second color, <em><span title="“young lady">Ojou-sama</span></em>?” The woman prodded. Ri hesitated.</p><p>                “Ri has two secondary colors*. Indigo and purple. They must be evenly divided secondary colors.”</p><p>                “Couldn’t decide? What bout the spiral? Still the traditional red and black?” The proprietress inquired happily, likely counting the money in her head for all the unique clothing soon to be ordered.</p><p>                “I thought about just doing white and black, but if it’s not red and black, it’s not really the Uzumaki spiral, is it?” Ri replied.</p><p>                “Ah.” The woman agreed. “Very well. Amber main colors with secondaries of indigo and purple, with the traditional red and black Uzumaki spiral. And the bill goes to the Hokage. I can do one outfit for you right now, but the Hokage will have to approve the expenditures before I can make any more. We’ll need the money for the rest of the cloth and special requirements.” The woman addressed both Ri and Weasel.</p><p>                “Understood.” Weasel agreed before setting Ri on her own feet and gently pushing her towards the woman. When Ri reached her, the woman showed Ri to a small dressing room where she took measurements and discussed other options with the young girl. In the end the woman told them to send someone in two days time to pick up the first outfit, at which time she would let them know if payment had been approved by the Hokage.</p><p>                Ri, tuckered out by all the things her young body had been asked to do that day, collapsed against Crow’s side as soon as the woman released her. Both Crow and Weasel radiated amusement to Ri’s senses, which she ignored in favor of raising her arms up to Weasel in the universal child language of “pick me up please.” Weasel obliged her and placed her on his hip once more. Then both men flickered straight from the shop to Ri’s apartment. Weasel carried Ri all the way to her room, where he left her to change.</p><p>                “Teeth and toilet too.” Weasel ordered sternly.</p><p>                “H-Hai.” Ri yawned and stumbled off to do as ordered, noting it was now nighttime with some surprise as she passed a window. When she was done taking a bath and getting ready for bed, Ri came back to the kitchen. To her surprise Crow was stirring something in a pot, and Weasel appeared to be writing something down at the table. Ri joined Weasel at the table and peered over at what he was writing.</p><p>                “What’cha doin?” Ri asked Weasel, trying not to yawn in the middle of her words.</p><p>                “Writing down some titles that we should get you to teach you reading.” Weasel replied easily. “I have some at home that are no longer in use that I can grab, so I’m making myself a note to pick them up and bring them by tomorrow.” He added, noting her interested look.</p><p>                “Soup’s done.” Crow called from the kitchen. Ri heard the sound of bowls being dished out, and then Crow carried out four bowls of soup like a pro. As he laid the bowls on the table, it was like he’d rung some sort of silent secret ANBU dinner bell. Both Tiger and Dog appeared via shunshin and joined them at the table, Tiger leaving his bag of supplies on the kitchen counter as he came. When every one was seated, the ANBU all said:</p><p>                "<em><span title="I receive this food">Itadakimasu,</span></em>" and began to eat. Ri looked up curiously at Dog.</p><p>                “<span title="I receive this food"><em>Itadakimasu?</em> Why did you all say that?” She asked, pretending to be the five year old who’d never been taught manners. The five year old they all thought she was.</span></p><p>                “It is how you say thank you to the person who made the meal, and/or to the god or gods if you are religious. It is also good manners. You should always say <em><span title="I receive this food">Itadakimasu</span></em> before you eat, Ri.” Dog replied seriously.</p><p>                “And you should say ‘<em><span title="Thank you for the feast">gochiso sama deshita</span></em>’ to show your thanks after eating.” Weasel added seriously. Ri actually hadn’t been aware of that last part, so she stored it away for later. As soon as she was done eating, she repeated</p><p>                “<em><span title="Thank you for the feast...?">Gochiso sama deshita…?</span></em>” Hesitantly, watching Weasel from the corners of her eyes. The teenage man nodded to show she’d done it right, and Ri beamed at him. “And thank you all for helping me today. I really appreciate both that and any other help you offer.” Ri added shyly, rubbing the back of her head. Then she realized her hair was still wet and made a face. “Ew…wet hair.” She explained to the curious ANBU.</p><p>                “Time for a brush and braid before bed while you study a little.” Dog declared. Then he pulled a book out of his vest and passed it over to weasel.</p><p>                “Good. I don’t have this one at home.” Weasel declared. Then Weasel opened the book and placed it on the table in front of Ri. She looked down and he began to instruct her in the beginnings of Hiragana. “We’ll work on Katakana later on, after you’ve got a good grasp on Hiragana.” Weasel explained to Ri. While he began to go over the characters with Ri, having her repeat them as he went over them, Dog went into the back hallway and came back with Ri’s hairbrush. It took a second, but she also noticed a hairband in his other hand as he got closer. Then he was sitting behind her, brushing her hair gently. Ri almost fell asleep as the brush gently scratched her scalp and down her back. Dog seemed to notice she enjoyed when he brushed all the way to the ends of her back, which scratched not only her scalp but also her back. He huffed a laugh and started to do it that way every time he stroked the brush through. By the time he stopped brushing, Ri felt more like a puddle than a girl. Then she felt him gently tugging on the hair. In a few moments a slightly heavier bundle of hair was laid gently on her back.</p><p>                “There. A nice bedtime braid.” Dog declared. “Perfect for pups who roll in their sleep a lot.” He added a little wickedly while Ri blushed. She went to swat at him, but he’d already jumped out of her reach.</p><p>                “Creepy! Watching a girl sleep!” She exclaimed playfully. Crow snorted but didn’t otherwise comment.</p><p>                "Orders are to watch you." Dog replied calmly. Then he addressed the other ANBU. “I had morning watch, so Weasel will have evening watch tonight. I’ll post a schedule before I go to bed. For both watches and training. Tomorrow morning will be Crow and Tiger until afternoon. Ri’s most energetic in the late morning and early afternoon, so Tiger should do the taijutsu and conditioning then. Crow, you will probably find that after breakfast or in the early evenings are good times to work on chakra and control. The other things can be worked in anywhere.” Dog ordered. As he talked aloud, Ri watched him sign additional orders to the other ANBU:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Report at shift change if nothing urgent</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>before he waved at Ri. “Weasel and I will see you tomorrow night, Pup.” Dog informed her before he vanished in a shunshin once more.</p><p>                “I wish that jutsu didn’t make me feel like the person vanished. It’s creepy. Like they stop existing. It’s not like they leave slowly. Just…POOF! Gone!” Ri grumbled. Crow laughed and tousled her hair. Then Weasel drew her attention back to Hiragana until she fell asleep over the book. With a sigh the ANBU picked her up and carried her to bed. Gently he tucked her in and jumped up to a corner of the ceiling to continue his watch. Crow retreated to the roof to keep watch outside. It looked to be a long, and hopefully quiet, night for the two shinobi. Still, Crow and Weasel both privately thought it was a nice break from the regular ANBU duties they did not cherish. So they settled in to watch motionlessly through the night.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><hr/><p> </p>
