    <p>
  <span>“This is some sort of party?” Albus was standing in the sitting room, begrudgingly allowing his mother to fuss over his robes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Some sort, yeah.” His dad was sitting at the table, already drained from the socializing they had yet to do. “More of a networking opportunity I think. Political something or other.” He was gazing off into the distance like he was imagining war rather than what promised to be a rather elegant get-together.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How come I have to go?” Albus wriggled away when his mother tried to fix his collar. “I don’t want to talk to Mr. Malfoy’s friends.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You go to Malfoy Manor all the time, why are you complaining?” James marched down the stairs awkwardly, apparently not understanding how to walk in dress robes. “It should be perfect for you, your little Slytherin snake den full of Slytherins and… snakes, I suppose.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus shook his head. “That the best you got?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James shrugged. “I could make gay jokes.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Spare me.”Albus sighed, smoothing his robes one last time and half heartedly attempting to make his hair look like he’d at least brushed it. He did brush it, incidentally, it just wasn’t showing. “But really, is there a reason we have to go?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Malfoy invited you,” Harry grumbled, giving a pleading look to Ginny, who shook her head.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re going so you can meet all the other children.” She scanned James up and down, grimaced, and gave up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Children…” Albus frowned at the word. He was nineteen in three weeks, it had been quite a while since someone had called him a child.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You know what I mean.” Ginny beamed as Lily trotted in, looking like the picture of grace in her pink dress. “You look lovely, dear. Now, Albus, you’re going to behave.” She cast a stern glance his direction. “I want you to try to make friends. Don’t just disappear somewhere with Scorpius, you need to show that you care.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus didn’t respond. He knew the reason they wanted him along. Now that Harry Potter was high up the chain of command at the ministry, Harry Potter needed to finally claim his Slytherin son. It looked good, Albus figured, to the politicians, most of whom were Slytherins themselves. Look, Harry Potter is middle of the road. Harry Potter isn’t so different from us. Harry Potter must have done something right, one of his kids turned out conservative, so it seems. He’s a Slytherin, so he’s a conservative. That’s how it works. Albus was trying not to be bitter, but it was sort of difficult not to be, seeing as how his friendship with Draco Malfoy’s son was suddenly a point of interest, and a valuable political tool. He was trying not to be bitter- it wasn’t his dad’s fault. It’s not like he wanted to play political games, it was just becoming more and more required.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When the family was finally ready to disapparate, Albus was ready to call it a night. He felt like he’d run a marathon, and his dad looked the same. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The air changed texture when they arrived at Malfoy Manor. Like an enchantment was making it a perfect 23 or so degrees, with just the right amount of humidity. Come to think of it, there probably was such an enchantment. The gates swung open to let them in, and Albus and Harry quickly fell behind the rest of their family, subconsciously trying to stay outdoors for as long as possible. It couldn’t last, and the high arch of the entryway opened grandly, announcing them as the Potter family to the stares of every millionaire in the room.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Speaking of millionaires, Scorpius came dashing around the corner and nearly tripped over his feet trying to slow down when his aunt shot him a look of warning. “Sorry! Okay. Sorry. I’m sorry.” He cleared his throat and corrected his posture. “Mr. and Mrs. Potter, welcome to our home.” He shook Harry’s hand, then Ginny’s, and nodded to each of the Potter children. “Please, follow me to the grand ballroom, my father would like to greet you himself.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus tried not to laugh. He </span>
  <em>
    <span>did</span>
  </em>
  <span> try. He failed. “What are you doing?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius shifted his weight, apparently debating whether or not to break character. He let out a strangled sound of frustration and sighed, relaxing his rigid stance. “I’m trying to be polite. It’s not working, is it?” He averted his eyes from Albus’ parents, trying at least to look respectful. “Do you- ah, I mean… I’m…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus schooled his expression, not wanting to cause the poor kid any more stress. “It’s okay, just follow your script.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius looked at him gratefully before snapping back into his role. “Please, follow me.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The grand ballroom was just down the hall. The doors stood open, spilling golden light onto the flagstone. Inside, people were milling about sampling food and wine. Scorpius’ father stood in the middle of it all, chatting with ancient wizards with a carefully placed expression of polite interest. It broke a bit when the Potter family approached him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A very short and round wizard dressed in red guffawed happily, glass of wine in hand. Albus thought he looked like a mushroom. The man shook Harry’s hand, introducing himself as Albertus Magnus. “Very good to make your acquaintance, Mr. Potter. This is my lovely wife Amanita, too lovely for me, don’t you think?” He chortled, looking his wife up and down. She was indeed beautiful. She had golden hair set in intricate plaits that curled just above her shoulders, delicate features, and was probably still in her thirties. “Give us a twirl, Amanita, there’s a good girl.” He nodded proudly, and turned his gaze to Ginny.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They stood in awkward silence for a moment before Draco shot Harry a look that stated very clearly, </span>
  <em>
    <span>say something now, idiot.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ah! Yes, right. This is Ginny, she’s my wife.” He tilted his head at her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus watched as a flicker of annoyance crossed Draco’s features. “Ginevra Potter, Senior Quidditch Correspondent for the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Daily Prophet.” </span>
  </em>
  <span>He paused, allowing Albertus Magnus to kiss her hand, a gesture Ginny didn’t seem to appreciate at all. Draco ignored it. “The three Potter children; James Potter the second, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Very nice to meet you all.” Albertus Magnus smiled warmly, shaking James’ then Albus’ hand. Skipping over Lily, Albertus gently shoved his wife forward to talk to Ginny while he focussed his attention on Harry. “Of course, I know the famous story of Harry Potter,” he chuckled. “Very impressive, of course, very impressive. Only natural you should be heading the Auror department. Ever thought of making a bid for Minister?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve…” Harry looked strapped for words. “I’ve… that’s not my goal, no, I very much enjoy my work with the Aurors.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albertus seemed a bit put out. “What a shame, I’d like to see you in that seat.” He regained his smile and turned to James. “And James Potter! How good to see you out in the world, getting to know all the movers and shakers, so to speak. What are your plans, son? Where do you see yourself going?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus smirked as he watched James struggle for a response. “I… I like making things and stuff, so… I dunno, I figure I’ll just work in my uncle's joke shop for a bit.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The expression on Draco’s face was too much. Albus had to turn away so as not to laugh.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius tapped him on the shoulder and whispered, “He won’t talk to you, you can probably slip away.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus nodded furtively and took a step back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wait, what should I do?” Lily whispered, looking to Scorpius in stunned desperation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius grimaced apologetically. “You’re expected to stay with your mother and make small talk with the ladies. James has to stay with your father, tell him to say he’s thinking about postgraduate school or something. Don’t tell the truth, they don’t want to hear it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily scowled. “How come Albus gets to leave?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius looked a bit surprised, like he was confused why he had to explain. “You’re the dowry and James is the heir. Albus doesn’t matter, he’s not expected to do anything.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m the </span>
  <em>
    <span>what </span>
  </em>
  <span>and </span>
  <em>
    <span>excuse you?!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>She fumed, the tips of her ears turning red.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I…” Scorpius shrunk under her gaze. “It’s just that… You know.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They didn’t.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius stared at the ground. “You’re supposed to be given away. To some other Pureblood family.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily huffed. “I’m not a pureblood.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius’ eyes widened. “Shh! Don’t- just… don’t say that out loud. I know you’re not, and they know you’re not, but your father’s famous and powerful so they’re sort of… giving you permission. To be Pureblood, that is.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s disgusting.” Lily flushed deeper, anger contracting her eyebrows.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius just shrugged. “It’s how it is. It’s already… I… You’re already going to be treated differently because you’re poor-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re not,” Lily interjected.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well…” Scorpius looked around pointedly at their surroundings. “James is going to have to learn a trade, isn’t he? He’s not just going to take over his father’s accounts like I am. If you were like us, only Albus would be presumed to learn a trade. You would be married off to some surname with money. That’s just how it is. Or… it’s how it is for them. For us.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I hate that.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Everyone does.” Scorpius shrugged and tugged on Albus’ arm. “Let’s go.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus gave Lily an apologetic look and politely excused himself from the conversation. Nobody noticed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius stopped several times on their way out of the grand ballroom to greet guests and exchange names with various people around the room. Albus felt like he was invisible. Nobody so much as looked at him. It was great.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Once they were free, Scorpius sighed with relief and leaned against a wall. “Good. I can relax for a minute. Almost everyone on the guest list is here, I shouldn’t have to do this much longer. Then I can come find you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus frowned. “Come find me? Where am I supposed to go?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius glanced down the hall. “If you wouldn’t mind being with the other second sons, I can introduce you to them. Otherwise you can go to my bedroom, that should be empty.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus must have looked as annoyed as he felt, because Scorpius defended himself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I can’t just leave, I’m supposed to stand by my dad. He’s already being lenient by letting me walk on my own, I at least have to greet the guests.” He looked at Albus pleadingly. “Half an hour more, tops.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus nodded. It was better than being with the high society. He remembered suddenly, “Oh, I’m supposed to meet the other children.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius smiled encouragingly. “Good! I’ll introduce you. They’re mostly fine, you might tolerate them alright.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With that glowing recommendation in mind, Albus followed Scorpius down the hall. Down some stairs, around a few corners and out of the way, a small library was tucked between a dense row of angry looking portraits with blond hair. Albus looked around. He’d never been in that part of the manor before.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is this the Potter boy, then?” One of them sniffed. “Not much to look at, is he?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus scowled at it, trying not to get offended by a portrait.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, no, this is the other one,” a bony woman in an ornate frame looked over her spectacles. “The good Slytherin one.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is that so?” The first hummed his appreciation. “Well, I suppose a good one can come out of mudbloods every now and then.” He smiled tightly like Albus was supposed to feel complimented.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mudbloods, is it now?” A grouchy looking man with a long nose and sharp edges glowered behind glasses so thick they blurred out his eyes. “In my day we called them Muggle Scum. Changing tradition to accommodate this filth. From whom did you steal your magic, eh ‘Mudblood’ boy?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus didn’t respond and stalked through the door, refusing to acknowledge them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sorry, my family’s rather unfriendly.” Scorpius looked far more upset than Albus was. He couldn’t meet his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus shrugged. “I live with a portrait like that. Ever thought of putting curtains over them? It’s what we do.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll mention it to my father.” Scorpius rubbed his eyes, exhaustion rounding his shoulders. “Oh.” The two became aware of the handful of silent eyes staring at them from various lounging locations around the library. “Hello, everyone.” He gestured awkwardly at Albus. “Albus Potter, second son of Harry Potter. Ah… to James Potter the second. You all… you all know what Mr. Potter does, so I guess I don’t have to explain.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A murmur of interest rose from the room. Albus waved. “Hi.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius bit his lip, eyes flicking between the room and Albus. “I… Okay. I guess…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You can go.” Albus released him, and Scorpius nodded shortly before dashing away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A lanky young man with light brown hair cropped tightly at his shoulders stood. He spoke with what sounded like an Italian accent. “Albus Potter. Anthony Aspergillus, son of Timothy Aspergillus, nice to make your acquaintance.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus shook his extended hand. “Er- yeah. Yeah, good to meet you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Anthony smiled broadly. “First time at one of the Malfoy parties, eh? Bored yet?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Entirely.” Albus smiled weakly. “I’m not really sure what I’m supposed to do.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Anthony clapped him on the shoulder. “Lot of the younger child, you don’t have to do anything. Good, isn’t it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus shrugged. “Beats what James is doing.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The other people in the room nodded wholeheartedly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That it does, mate.” Anthony gestured for Albus to sit, then plopped down next to him. “You’re on the circuit now.” He chewed on a fingernail. “So you’ll get to know everyone here. I’m sure you know some of us already.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus looked around. A few of his housemates caught his eye and he grimaced. Great. It was going to be hard to make friends when a large portion of the group already hated him. He wished Scorpius would come back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What are you doing here, Potter?” Solomon Zabini, a Slytherin one year ahead of Albus. They’d never really spoken. In fact, Albus was a bit surprised to hear his voice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” Albus scowled at him. “I was invited.” What a strange question. “Better question, what are </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>doing here? I come here all the time.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve never seen you at one of these events before.” He rose from his place in an armchair, and Albus stood to match him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve never seen you at Malfoy Manor before,” Albus countered, suddenly feeling the need to prove himself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is my first time here.” Zabini looked around. “Not bad, but I do wish we could leave this library without being forced to join the party, it smells of mothballs in here.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus began putting things together, and a feeling of dread washed over him. “So, I’m going to have to go to more of these? And not at Scorpius’ house?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Zabini nodded. “Welcome to high society.” He sat back down, sighing dramatically. “I come to at least one of these atrocities per month.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus’ stomach dropped. One per month? That was going to get very old very quickly. He already felt like he’d been there for hours. “That’s…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We make it fun, though,” Anthony said, picking up a bottle from its hiding spot and putting it on the table. “We have our own parties.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Slowly, Albus smiled. So, they weren’t going to be stuffy like their parents. Maybe it wouldn’t be as bad as he feared. “Okay, I’m game.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Speaking of,” Zabini waved everyone over to the tea table. “Let’s play.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Play?” Albus sat down at the table, nervous at the sudden shift in the mood.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s a bit childish,” a young man Albus recognized as Josiah Nott said. Nott was a year Albus’ minor, and he was often the subject of Albus and Scorpius’ silent spite. He was an outspoken blood supremacist, and often talked about the day he’d reform the Knights of Walpurgis.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, it’s just that nobody asked your opinion, Nott,” Anthony shot. Albus instantly gained some respect for him. Anthony seemed to notice, because he cast Albus a wild grin and poured him a drink.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus wasn’t exactly a stranger to alcohol, but he’d never gotten drunk in the way they did that night. Drinking games. Games for drinking. Games as an excuse to saturate their blood with alcohol.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I never dated a Gryffindor,” someone announced. Nobody drank.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I never had a one night stand.” Several people around the table raised their glasses in smug salute.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I never woke up in a different house than I fell asleep in.” One of them looked sternly at another, who drank sheepishly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus didn’t really understand the game. It’s not like you had to tell the truth, nobody was enforcing anything. It seemed like a loosely stitched idea at best.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You </span>
  <em>
    <span>do </span>
  </em>
  <span>have to tell the truth,” Anthony frowned at him, and Albus realized he’d spoken aloud. Slowly, a smile spread across his face. “Watch.” He turned to Nott. “I never cried in public after getting dumped.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shock flashed across Nott’s features before he managed to get control of himself. He gripped the edge of the table tightly, but was unable to resist the compulsion to drink to that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus laughed. “Are you serious, Nott? Ha.” He smirked with Anthony. “So, why does that happen?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Veritaserum,” Anthony explained as he pulled a small vial from within his robes. “Don’t worry, it’s not that much. It wears off within two minutes if you don’t keep drinking it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus took the vial from him, inspecting it briefly before handing it back. “I gotta say, I’m a bit nervous now.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Anthony elbowed him. “Oh yeah? What have you got to hide?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Something shuddered through Albus’ brain, and the urge to answer overwhelmed him. “I-I, once I-I-” He struggled to keep himself from talking.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ah, shit, sorry. Don’t answer.” Albus relaxed as Anthony laughed. “I forgot. I’m drunk. Forgive me.” He was cracking up, head in his hands.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His laughter was contagious. Albus laughed with him, and the tension was diffused. Anthony was alright. Nott, on the other hand, was glowering with terrifying intensity. It made Albus a bit nervous. His nerves were realized when Nott leaned back, smirked, and raised his drink to Albus.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I never had a wet dream about a friend.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Several people around the table drank, choking on their own surprise. Albus was one of them, which shocked him into coughing back up the entire mouthful.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Nott sat back smugly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Terrified, Albus tried to rationalize his way out of it. He hadn’t asked about a specific friend. He hadn’t even said best friend. It could mean anyone, nobody would think anything of it. Right? Right. He calmed his expression, though his heart was the speed of a hummingbird’s. It was fine. He willed himself to calm down. It was fine. It was fine. It was- people were staring at him. Why? Albus’ heart jump started again. It wasn’t his turn, was it? No. It wasn’t. So why-</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His housemates. People who’d known him in school. Albus shrunk away from their gazes, unable to deny the fact that they knew. He’d only had one friend, hadn’t he? They knew that. Albus racked his brain for a name, any name, that could get him out of it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Nott, still smirking, nodded his head towards the door. “Hello, Scorpius.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus nearly gave himself whiplash turning to look. He scanned Scorpius’ features for any sign that he’d seen what had happened. He couldn’t find any, but he couldn’t prove a negative. “Hi, you’re back. Are you staying? We’re playing a game. I’ve never played before, it’s a little unnerving. Have you played this before? Do you know what this game is?” He was babbling, much to Nott’s amusement.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Come join us, Scorpius, we were just talking about you.” He shot a look of defiance at Albus.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus felt like he was falling off a mountain. “We were just playing a game, not a great game, bit silly really. Delphini! Remember- no, Albus that’s not a good choice.” To his horror, he realized he still wasn’t able to lie. “Nevermind, Scorpius I was just- ugh shit I was just thinking about... Delphi and- shut up, that’s worse-” Albus grimaced, unable to keep the anxiety out of his voice. “Delphi and all of that shit we got up to back in school with her, remember? I didn’t mean I ever-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Nott leaned over the table to announce, “I never fell in love with a schoolmate.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus wanted to scream. His hand shot out for his glass and he drank. He slammed the glass back down nearly hard enough to break it. “Wow! What’s in this whiskey, huh? Pretty good, I think I’ll keep drinking.” He raised the glass to his lips again, hiding the deep flush on his cheeks as he quickly drained every drop. It hit him like a brick wall. All of the sudden, he was very clearly and very seriously drunk. He steadied himself against the tea table and struggled to make eye contact with Scorpius through his terror and inebriation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Like a godsend, Anthony seemed to get what was going on. Discreetly, he flicked his wand in the direction of Nott’s throat, making him choke for a moment as he realized his voice was gone.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius looked concerned. “Are you okay?” He quickly strode across the room to stand ominously over the spot Albus was sitting. “I’ve never seen you drunk before.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Horrified, Albus realized he still couldn’t lie. “Actually, I’m pretty far from okay. Nott decided to let his innate dickheadedness shine through his apathetic exterior, so now everybody-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Heavy blunt force collided with Albus’ side. “Whoa, sorry!” Anthony spoke loudly. “Sorry, Albus that wasn’t something I wanted to do.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Deep appreciation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, Scorpius!” Anthony continued, speaking at a very high volume. “How’s the party going, mate? Going well? Party going well?” He didn’t pause for a response. “Great! That’s good. Are you done, then? Managed to wriggle away yet?” He laughed awkwardly as Albus regained his balance. “Good of your father to let you go, isn’t it?” Anthony’s expression shifted from forcedly good natured to horrified. “I guess it’s for the better since your social skills are shit, gods, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I-” He fought against his own tongue and lost. “Guess a bunch of Purebloods would rather not think that Draco Malfoy could produce an asperg-Merlin, Albus, help. Is that why you walk funny, huh? Like you’ve taken a blow to the head. Does that have- I’m so so sorry!” He smacked his head down on the table. “Albus, help- but I suppose it’s important you make an appearance since your mother-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why don’t we leave now, mate?!” Albus shouted over Anthony. “Getting a bit stuffy in here, isn’t it?!” He stood sharply and nearly blacked out. “Shit, I can’t… I’m way too drunk. Fuck you kindly, Nott, I’ll see you in he-... Hell is just an allegory the ancients invented to keep us in order. Once you’re dead, you’re dead. I won’t see you anywhere, but I assume you understood the sentiment. My father would certainly disagree, but he prefers to maintain the delusion that someday he’ll meet his parents in heaven.” Albus buried his face in his hands. “Merlin, this is embarrassing.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you all take veritaserum?” Scorpius looked completely befuddled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A chorus of drunken voices responded, “Yes.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius nodded slowly and took a deep breath. “I… okay. That’s… Okay.” He stared at his shoes. “I won’t talk to you for a bit, then. Want to go, Albus?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, but I’m truly afraid of what all you’re going to put together-” A flash of pain.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll punch Nott in the face for you, Albus!” Anthony yelled, apparently having demonstrated such on Albus’ leg. “Hear that? I’m telling the truth! I’m gonna hit him and see if I can make him cry like that time his girlfriend dumped him in front of all of us at a Hallows Eve party!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus stayed silent and followed as Scorpius led him from the room. He felt awful. Both from the excess of alcohol and the things they had said. Their footsteps echoed way too loud in the flagstone hallways, and Albus desperately wanted to fill the silence. At least it was beginning to fade. By the time they reached Scorpius’ bedroom, alcohol was overshadowing any bit of veritaserum that might have been left. He felt sick.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is it gone?” Scorpius’ expression was impassive.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not sure.” Albus frowned, trying to think of a test. “This is definitely a good night for me.” He nodded. “It’s gone.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius took a deep breath and sat down on his bed with a sigh. “Good. I’ll try not to think about that too hard.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you.” Relief and love bubbled up in Albus’ heart. “I’m sorry about that.” He looked around for a place to sit down, as standing was becoming too great a challenge. It felt a bit strange, but he conceded to sit on Scorpius’ bed next to him. It wasn’t strange, though, was it? They sat like that all the time. Right? Nothing felt normal.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not upset.” Scorpius shrugged, flopping down on his back. “It’s pretty hard to justify being offended by the truth.” He blinked up at Albus. “You’re pretty drunk, huh?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right pissed.” Albus tried shutting his eyes to make the room stop spinning, but it only made things worse. “How much longer is the party? Am I gonna have time to sober up before I see my dad again?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius checked his watch. “Ah… Well, you could always spend the night.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay.” Albus looked at his hands. They were a bit wobbly. “I might.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Actually, I think I still have some of your things here.” Scorpius glanced at his dresser cabinet. “Clothes and stuff.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, okay.” Albus nodded, trying to remember why he felt anxious. “Brilliant. I mean… Yeah.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They were silent for a long time. Albus wasn’t sure whether it was awkward or not, but regardless, he couldn’t think of anything to say.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, you just drank with them?” Scorpius looked nervous.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Er- yeah.” Albus frowned. “Why?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius shrugged and kicked his feet. “They get a little crazy sometimes.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do they?” Albus laid down next to Scorpius, staring at the plaster of the ceiling. “How so?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius took a deep breath. “You know, I’m not really sure. I always leave first. Sometimes they sneak out to the grounds and play battle tag. One time they set a topiary on fire. My dad just about had a fit.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That actually sounded pretty fun. Albus smiled, imagining it. He figured he’d probably get an opportunity to join in at some point, assuming his dad was going to keep dragging him to things. “We just sat there,” Albus assured. “Playing drinking games.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh.” Scorpius stretched his arms over his head, popping his back. “Ah, I’m glad I get a break from the party. I’ll have to go back down and say goodbye as it’s ending, though.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay.” The silence returned, definitely awkward that time. Albus searched his brain for anything to say that would distract him from how horribly poisoned he felt, but his thoughts were too fuzzy to even remember proper English syntax, and it just got worse with every passing second.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius seemed to notice. “Are you okay? You look like you’re going to be sick.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, almost certainly.” Albus tried to smile. “But I think that if I lay here very very still, I may be able to postpone that for a while.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Probably unwise,” Scorpius mused, looking him over. “You’ll just let more of it make its way into your bloodstream. I’d get it over with now, if I were you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus pretended he didn’t hear that. It sounded rather unpleasant, and he prefered to maintain the delusion that he would wind up okay in the end.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re just going to make tomorrow’s hangover worse.” Scorpius seemed to read his mind. “My dad doesn’t keep hangover potions because he says it would discourage moderation.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus figured he was right. He groaned and gingerly sat up. “Alright. Be right back, then.” He grabbed his wand and an empty glass from Scorpius’ side table, and shuffled off to the washroom.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>*******</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius was trying hard not to think about it. Out of respect for Albus and for the sake of their friendship he was trying not to think about it. It had been pretty obvious, though. Especially the way he had struggled to cover it up. Scorpius groaned, rolling over to lie face down on his bed. He wished the party was over. He wished Albus hadn’t come. Events such as those that he had to endure were bad enough without all of his father’s friends’ sons being a bad influence on Albus.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Scorpius!” A booming voice announced his name as his bedroom door was slammed open.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Grandfather!” Scorpius sat bolt upright under the furious gaze of Lucius Malfoy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lucius’ walking stick clicked across the floor as he approached his grandson. “Is there a reason you’ve abandoned such a lovely party?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As if to make a point, Albus chose that moment to walk out of the loo, looking absolutely wrecked. “Scorpius, I have to say, mate-” He caught eyes with Lucius and froze in terror.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lucius looked Albus up and down and sniffed. “Mr. Potter. How nice to have you in our home.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus nodded weakly. “Er- yeah. Right. Thanks.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Under the curl of his lip, Lucius nodded curtly to Albus and returned his gaze to his grandson. He gestured for Scorpius to stand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius obliged quickly, smoothing out his robes and hoping his lack of eye contact came across as respect rather than fear.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lucius looked him up and down, glanced briefly around the room, and folded his hands over the silver head of his walking stick. “Explain,” he said coolly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius couldn’t find words. He stood there gaping for a long moment before any sort of sentence made sense. “I didn’t mean… I’m not running away, I just… Father said it was okay if I just greeted everyone and then returned at the end to say goodbye.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did he now? Perhaps I’ll have to have a word with Draco.” Lucius’ eyes flickered briefly to Albus. “Where, I wonder, are the other boys? Surely Mr. Potter isn’t the only boy your age who has been brought along tonight. I do believe, for example, that Mr. Theodore Nott arrived accompanied by his two sons. I don’t suppose they’re hiding in your shower as well?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, sir.” Scorpius stared down at his shoes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, then.” Lucius gestured out the door. “I suggest the two of you return to the festivities. Lest these good people begin to think you’re up to something.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius didn’t dare look back at Albus before he followed his grandfather out the door. He didn’t dare look anywhere but the flagstone until someone began fussing over him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Scorpius, wherever have you been?” Narcissa Malfoy straightened his robes and tightened his tie. “People will begin to talk.” She tilted his chin up and fixed his hair. “Don’t hold your shoulders so tightly, now. Proudly back, like a Malfoy. Good boy.” She smiled. “Eyes up, eye contact is important. Do you understand me?” She put her hands on his cheeks and forced him to look at her. “Now, try to walk with a certain amount of grace. Remember you’re representing your family.” She looked him up and down, not seeming impressed. “Keep it in your mind that everything here will be yours someday, and everyone here respects you for that. Keep a certain amount of confidence, but make sure you show proper respect to your superiors.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, ma’am.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His grandmother tutted. “Don’t look so worried. You’re going to be fine. Lucius-” She waved him over. “Where’s Draco?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“In the ballroom.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“There, now. Off to the ballroom with you.” Narcissa pushed Scorpius along.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius struggled to maintain all the points of good posture he had been told to. He tried to make his feet fall in measured steps. He tried to look people in the eye when they greeted him as he passed by. He felt ridiculous. His grandparents trailed along behind him, and he only hoped he was absorbing some of their gravitas. He glanced behind him, half-hoping to see Albus following him. Would have been stupid of him to do so, probably, being as drunk as he was, but Scorpius still would have liked the company.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His dad seemed a bit surprised to see him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You decided to come back to the party?” He walked over to meet Scorpius as he entered the room.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Grandfather said I have to,” he whispered, giving a subtle gesture to Lucius.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco took a deep breath. “We have to listen to him, then. Don’t let him catch you next time.” He forced a measured expression when Lucius approached them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco. I found your son hiding away from this lovely party you worked so hard to put together.” He folded his hands over his walking stick.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m sure he was just entertaining the other boys,” Draco responded, nodding at Scorpius.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“One of them in particular, but I’d say he was highly entertained.” Lucius’ expression turned cold.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco cast a suspicious look at his son, which Scorpius ignored.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I did speak with the other boys.” He glanced over his shoulder again, still vaguely hoping that Albus would be there to rescue him. “They’re fine. They don’t need me.” He tried to shut up as more and more people passed by to make polite conversation. Scorpius was terrible at polite conversation. He invariably stumbled over his words or rambled on for far too long about topics that interested only him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The night dragged on at a snail’s pace, but eventually the guests did begin to leave. As soon as his grandparents’ vigilance slipped, Scorpius darted away. His heart pounded wildly with anxiety as he tried to remain inconspicuous. He felt as if his grandparents were waiting behind every corner, ready to ambush him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He checked his room first. A good call, as Albus was still there, passed out face first on the bed. He’d apparently found out where Scorpius stored all of his forgotten items, because he was wearing his favorite Ilvermorny shirt, which he’d picked up on a trip to America in seventh year.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius didn’t want to bother him, so he just sat quietly in his favorite armchair and picked up an old book he’d read a thousand times. Eventually either Albus would wake up and want to go home, or his parents would come looking for him at which point Scorpius would have to explain the situation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’d practically memorized the book he was reading, so he didn’t notice that he hadn’t turned a page in ten minutes. His mind just kept telling him the story as he stared blankly at the same sentence, ears at attention in wait of the sound of the door opening.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Despite this, he didn’t notice they weren’t alone until Harry spoke.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Albus?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius leapt to his feet. “Mr. Potter! Hello.” He snapped his book closed and tossed it onto the chair, edging in front of his bed so maybe Harry wouldn’t notice exactly how gone his son was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry just looked confused. “Is he asleep? Are those his clothes?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“...Yes…” Scorpius answered both hesitantly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry didn’t look any less confused. “Where did he get those clothes?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He’s here a lot…” Scorpius tried to think of a way to change the subject. Truthfully, Albus rarely had his parents permission to spend the night at the manor, and he almost always just snuck out. “You know, I wouldn’t mind if he spent the night. I wouldn’t want… I mean, it seems a shame to wake him.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry was silent for a long moment before his expression turned dark. “Tell me he’s drunk.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That sentence didn’t completely register with Scorpius. “He…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry held up a silencing hand. “Just tell me he’s drunk so I can go home and tell Ginny.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius must have taken too long to respond, because the look on Harry’s face changed from dark to frightful.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is he safe?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius’ breath caught in his throat. “Safe?” He felt like he was missing something important. “He’s…” He needed to say </span>
  <em>
    <span>something, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry was becoming increasingly more concerned. “He’s fine.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright. As long as he didn’t do anything too bad.” He looked at Scorpius seriously. “I trust you.” Harry nodded, cast a lingering look at his son’s unconscious form, and turned to leave without another word.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Suddenly, Scorpius’ world was very dark. There could be unexplained and potentially dangerous things about the life of Albus Potter, and that was a terrifying thought. Anxiety boxed his ears and clouded his thoughts. He wanted answers, but confusion and anxiety glued him to the floor where he stood. For entirely too long, Scorpius stood staring blankly at the wall. Nothing registered with his brain until-</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why is Albus Potter in your bed?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius leapt to attention at the sound of his dad’s voice. “Er, well…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“His father seems unduly concerned that something has happened to his son, and I recommend you lock your door if that’s the case. You wouldn’t want your grandparents to discover anything unsavory.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Right. Grandparents. Maintain appearances. Was something actually wrong with Albus? Maintain appearances. Close the door. “Yes, sir.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco nodded once, cast a curious glance to Albus, and closed the door. Scorpius locked it with a flick of his wand and sat down on the bed. He should change out of his dress robes. He should shower. He should go to bed. He should definitely do something, but he really didn’t remember what was supposed to be done.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Albus?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mm?” So he wasn’t that deeply asleep.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you okay?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Never better.” Sounded sarcastic. Must be sarcastic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you need anything?” Scorpius was pretty sure he wouldn’t know what to do if anything was actually wrong, but it seemed like the thing to ask.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lay down.” Albus’ voice was muffled by pillows and slurred by alcohol.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I need to get ready for bed.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do that then lay down.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius nodded, mostly to himself, and set about his nightly rituals. His brain was buzzing with social adrenaline and concern, and consequently all of his thoughts were silenced. Not terrible. Uncomfortable, but not terrible.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After cleaning up and washing the scent of the party off his skin, the smell of alcohol on Albus’ was stronger. More noticeable. He lay down in bed, trying not to think too hard. That was the theme of the night, wasn’t it? Don’t think too hard. Follow tradition, don’t think too hard. Ignore strange confessions, don’t think too hard. Forget what felt strongly like real-life foreshadowing. Don’t think too hard.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Don’t think at all. Go to sleep, don’t think at all.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Scorpius extinguished the light.</span>
</p>
