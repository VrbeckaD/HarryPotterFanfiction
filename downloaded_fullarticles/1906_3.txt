    <p>The man "woke up" feeling <em>different</em>.  He felt oddly energized and instantly aware he wasn't himself.  No, he was in the guise of none other than Barty Crouch Jr. as if that made complete sense.</p><p>Clearly he was dreaming, but he couldn't be more delighted.  He always liked imagining himself a Wizard.</p><p>Judging from his locale of a stone brick walls and lack of happiness sucking demons despite the cold and how he had both eyes and both legs he figured 'Barty' just had his soul eaten up. </p><p>Finding the twig he was delighted as he felt the power of the mighty stick, the sheer rush of warmth and  power in his hands...  He was amazed that he could feel anything in a dream, much less something as spectacular as that! "Surprisingly vivid, but still it's nice, and I'm not just talking about you." He told the thing in his hands.  Also he found his wand.</p><p>He hoped for and was lucky enough to remember where 'he'd stashed his invisibility cloak pulling the thing out and on with a grin even as he hurriedly set about packing having no idea how long it would take.  Thankfully this was a dream, a simple command of "Pack." Had everything in the office and his quarters flying into his trunk effortlessly.</p><p>Shrinking it was just as simple, he hadn't realized how much useless knowledge of Harry Potter he'd picked up as he muttered "Reducio." The trunk seemed almost to fold in on itself down to the size of a wallet, an "Accio." summoning it to his hand barely remembering a feather-light charm at it.  He couldn't remember the incantation but willing the heavy trunk to not end his dream he found ample motivation to cast it silently.</p><p>Quickly pocketing the trunks he threw on the invisibility cloak before stalking out of the room. </p><p>His first thought was the kitchens to find himself an elf but that was rejected almost immediately.  For some reason he felt a deep hatred towards the little beasties despite how useful they were.  Then again, considering how Dobby nearly killed Harry trying to save him and how freaky the little things looked maybe it wasn't so unexpected.</p><p>Similarly the Room of Requirement was rejected as well knowing that it was a dream he didn't care about acquiring wealth.  Beside, he had magic and invisibility, he could take whatever he wanted.</p><p>Though at present he didn't much fancy a fight as fun as that might be,</p><p>Luckily he remembered more, the third floor wasn't far and the ugly statue of a one-eyed humpbacked witch even easier, a quick "<em>Dissendium." </em>and a tap on it's noggin with his wand had her stepping aside with an ugly glare.</p><p>It was a simple matter to dig out his tiny shrunken broom out of his shrunken trunk with another accio spell quickly growing it to size.</p><p>Bit of a harrowing trip to be sure through the narrow tunnels but far faster than walking like some sort of <em>Muggle</em>.</p><p>He shuddered theatrically.</p><p>The candy shop was empty and dark.  Into his trunk it's contents went, a surprisingly tasty blood-flavored lollypop in his mouth. "I wish all my dreams were this vivid...  What do they call em? Lucid dreams?"  He muttered exiting the candy shop, the shriek of alarm spells sounding.  His alarm was probably going off in the real world he thought with annoyance.  He'd power through it as long as he could.</p><p>In the spirit of prolonging it he thought about where he could go, one location popping up vividly, and with a spin he too popped away.</p><p>He popped back into the oddly spinning world in front of The Leaky Cauldron.</p><p>Nipping in for a bit he silent accioed a few bottles of Butter-Beer and Fire-Whiskey into the softened wall and floor, shouts of surprise and one particularly scruffy man getting hit on the head with it even as the bartender rushed towards his drinks.  Barty was only able shrink a few but figured it'd be enough as he ducked out of the alley one Butterbeer in hand, the cap twisting off with a wand tap and a wish for it to be gone.  It flew off hitting a Muggle and he couldn't help but laugh.</p><p>Then he took a drink of the Butterbeer.  It was... Not that great. Carmely and buttery sure, but not that spectacular.  You could buy a tastier drink at any Starbucks or grocery store.</p><p>He dropped it even as he took out a bottle of Fire-Whiskey unshrinking it even as he briskly waked away. Witches and Wizards pouring out into Muggle London searching for the missing booze to his amusement but he paid it no more attention.</p><p>He took a swallow of the liquor without hesitance expecting a cinnamon-flavored-whiskey.  What he got instead was burning pain coming from his mouth and throat as he puked fire. It burned bad on the way in and worse on the way out worse than any alcohol ever had burned in the history of ever.  In the drink's defense he felt buzzed as he coughed and wheezed but he left the bottle where it fell even as it refused to break, as if even hell would not accept it into it's domain.</p><p>He drank a Butterbeer to wash the heat away, nearly draining the bottle dry. </p><p>He walked about trying to think of what to do, enjoying his buzz now that it wasn't threatening to burn down the city.</p><p>Discarding the Fire-Whiskey as he went was rather amusing.  To see the delighted faces of the homeless as the find a bottle of hootch was heart-warming, and to watch them becoming shabby dragons for an instant was utterly hilarious.  More than one even went back for seconds, though one preformed a surprisingly indoctrinate exorcism on the bottle.</p><p>Still, just giving homeless people fire-water was getting dull.  Then he saw <em>it</em> and knew this was what he'd been searching for.  The neon signs, the backlit  silhouettes of women in risque poses, it was the same anywhere truly.</p><p>He wasn't much for strip clubs while awake but he hardly had to pay, he was invisible!</p><hr/><p>"Last night there was a terrible tragedy, one I've not seen the likes of in my entire life as long as that's been...  Not during the war nor during my tenure here have I ever before heard of such a vile act... Please keep calm as I tell you this, I know you will be angry, sad, and confused, but please, don't panic." The Headmaster said in a dead-tone of voice as he addressed the students who were listening in rapt attention.</p><p>"Someone robbed Honeydukes." He concluded to the expected horrified silence. </p><p>Someone angrily said "Albus!" reminding him of the other news.</p><p>"Oh yes, there was something more wasn't there?  Hm... Ah, right, that French guy, Where's-His-Nose has also returned and killed that strange sparkling student."  He waved it off as unimportant, after all how big a threat could a man unable to smell or taste be?  Besides, it wasn't as though the sparkly student had been killed with a stake, he'd be back on his feet in no time.</p><p>"Also to end things on a more pleasant note I do have some good news for you all!  If you've ever stayed awake for a few moments in History of Magic, (yes I'm speaking about you Ravenclaws and Miss Granger), then you'll know we were hiding magic from the muggles.  Everyone should at least know that you weren't allowed to cast magic before you became seventeen and that was the reason why.   Don't worry about that anymore, they know."  The students didn't seem all that relieved by his good news save perhaps Harry Potter.  Such a good lad, a more pleasant smile was hard to find despite all the adversity in his life. Rather reminded him of his old friend <span class="ILfuVd NA6bn"><span class="e24Kjd">Jack Napier</span></span> over in Gotham come to think of it.  He wondered whatever happened to the ever pranking man-child... Hm.... He bet Gotham had candy still...</p><p>"Minerva, an important matter has come to my attention and I'm afraid I'll have to let you finish off the school-year in my stead." He said firmly as he quickly made a turkey leg into a portkey, and with a wand tap activated it. Candy-ahoy!</p>
