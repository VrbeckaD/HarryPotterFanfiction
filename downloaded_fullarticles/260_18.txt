    <u>Earth: April 13, 1991: Deserted Wasteland Somewhere in Africa:</u>
  </b>
</p><p>A battle was waging in the middle of a deserted wasteland. A green insect-thing was in a power struggle with a young boy with blonde, spiky hair. The boy was sparking with bio-electricity, and his left arm was broken. A green man with pointed ears named Piccolo was trying to help Gohan beat the monster.</p><p>Cell suddenly smiled, and shifted control of the blast to his left hand, pointed his index and middle fingers at Piccolo. An orange beam of energy shot out in a corkscrew manner, impaling the Namekian. He fell lifeless to the ground, purple blood quickly coating the ground.</p><p>Gohan was devastated and lost control. Cell's blast pushed forward and overwhelmed the fighter, obliterating him in seconds. The others tried to get away, but were all killed in the Android's glee.  Before he could get on with destroying the planet, though, there was an elderly voice that spoke with power untold.  "I never thought I'd use this spell, but... you cannot be allowed to live!  Avada Kedavra!"  As the insectoid turned to the voice, there was a flash of green, and he fell, lifeless.<br/>

</p><p>Harry and Cedric had both been transported to the Little Hangleton Graveyard by a portkey set by Bartemius Crouch Jr. The two young Wizards looked around, before Harry started yelling in pain from his scar burning. He was barely able to see as a short, portly man came out of the shadows, and sickly green light was shot at the older boy, killing him instantly, without leaving a mark. Harry was then dragged to the center point and was tied and gagged to the giant gravemarker. The portly man, Wormtail, then started a ritual to bring back Voldemort. He took a bone from the grave Harry was standing on ("Bone of the father, Unknowingly given, you will renew your son"), cut his own hand off ("Flesh of the servant, willingly sacrificed, you will restore your master"), and took a sample of blood from the young guest ("Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you will revive your foe"), adding each one separately.</p><p>After all that, Voldemort returned, more snakelike than he was before. He told the story of how he had lost his power at the hands of a one year old boy, and how now, he was going to prove that it was an error, and luck that saved Harry, by killing him then. He ordered Wormtail to free the boy, and give his wand to him. Immediately after that, he was put under the Torture Curse for a few seconds. He shakily got up when it ended, and after being asked if he wanted a repeat, was put under the Imperious Curse, which he broke free of. After that, they played a twisted game of hide-and-seek, before Harry got up and faced Voldemort, and they dueled for real. Voldemort casted the Killing curse, while Harry chose the Disarming Charm. This caused priori Incantatum, due to Harry's and Voldemort's brother wands.</p><p>After being told what to do, Harry broke the connection, and escaped with Cedric's body, back to Hogwarts, where he warned everyone of the danger, but very few believed him.</p><p>

</p><p>Harry looked at Voldemort as he approached. The 21 year old wizard smiled, and raised his wand, but was struck with a Wandless spell before he could react. He was pushed back, but stayed on his feet. His training with Goku-Sensei helped him stay upright, and he sent a blast of magic back at the Darkest wizard of his time. Harry then followed up with a Sectumsempra, which missed the target.</p><p>Voldemort raised his wand and sent a dark curse at Harry, which he couldn't dodge. He screamed in pain as his body was cut by invisible daggers, causing him to lose a lot of blood. He staggered and tried to send another blast of magic, but only caused his reserves to run dry, and he collapsed. The Dark wizard then laughed.</p><p>"AVADA KEDAVRA!" The dark curse sailed toward the unconscious boy, who seemed to vanish mere seconds before the spell hit.</p><p>He appeared near Goku's house, where he rested for a few days. After that, Goku helped him train further. Teaching him the really advanced techniques, like the Kamehameha, Kaioken, and Spirit Bomb. They trained for when they would meet up with Cell and Voldemort.</p><p>

</p><p>Cell, who had been revived by the Dragon Balls some time ago, and Voldemort were going to where Goku and Harry were presumed to be, while Harry and Goku were going to where Cell and Voldemort were presumed to be. They met up in the middle, and stared each other down.</p><p>"Harry, I'll take Cell while you handle Voldemort." Harry nodded, and faced the Snake-faced man.</p><p>"Voldemort, It's over! Today you die!"</p><p>"I think not, Harry Potter. Today you die! Crucio!" Harry screamed as he was hit with the Cruciatus Curse. Goku faced Cell while this was going on, and transformed immediately to Super Saiyan 2. He charged at Cell, and went into battle, but found he was losing. Dumbfounded, he looked at Harry, and saw that he too was losing.</p><p>Coming up with an idea, he grabbed Harry and before he was struck with the Killing Curse, departed with Instant Transmission. They appeared near a cluster of Black-Starred orbs.</p><p>"These are the Black-Star Dragonballs. They can grant any wish. ARISE DRAGON!"</p><p>As he finished the command, a blast of yellow light issued from the seven balls. Once the light faded, a giant, red dragon hovered before them.</p><p>"SPEAK YOUR WISH!"</p><p>"I wish that Harry here and myself were transported back in time 30 years."</p><p>"OKAY!"</p><p>The Dragon's eyes glowed red, and the two were enveloped in gold light. When the light faded, the two bodies collapsed. The dragonballs lifted up, and scattered themselves around the galaxy. A year later in this timeline, the planet exploded, killing whoever was still alive.</p><p>

</p><p>Voldemort walked up to the door of Godric's Hollow, and blasted it down, seeing Lily run up the stairs. He smirked as James stood, wand in hand.</p><p>"Stand aside and you may live, Potter." James smiled, and stood his ground.</p><p>"No. You'll have to go through me to get to lily."</p><p>"Very Well. AVADA KEDAVRA!"</p><p>"STUPEFY!" The two beams met in the middle, and a power struggle ensued. For a while, the beam never wavered, but soon it started moving toward James. Slowly at first, then picking up speed, before it hit the father hard, killing him instantly.</p><p>Smirking, Voldemort moved to the stairs and ascended them. He headed for Lily's room, and blasted the door down.</p><p>"Stand Aside, you silly girl, and you shall keep your pathetic life."</p><p>"No!"</p><p>"I said Stand Aside!"</p><p>"No! Take me! Please!"</p><p>"Very Well. Since you won't stand aside. AVADA KEDAVRA!" The green beam of light struck the mother down where she stood, but he didn't notice the slight glow that enveloped young Harry.</p><p>"AVADA KEDAVRA!" The beam of light struck Harry, and then rebounded on Voldemort, ripping him from his body. The spirit fled, and young Harry started to cry. From the Shadows, a young man in a red gi appeared, and took Harry away.</p>
