    <p>All our Tomorrows, begin with Yesterday</p><p>					Chapter 1</p><p>They thought that they would have more time.  They thought that the war would be won by the side of the light and that they would be able to live their lives, together.  They never thought that it would come to this.  This final option, the final play in their once overflowing arsenal of knowledge and forbidden magic.  But nothing is forbidden when the “Dark Side” wins.  Everything is up for grabs when there is nothing left to lose.  When you have lost everything at the age of thirty-nine, twenty-three and twenty.  </p><p> </p><p>Life was a cliché when you were fighting for the “Greater Good” that you had never truly believed in.  When that “Greater Good” did nothing but killed off everyone that you loved. It was a line, nothing but a lie spoken by the one that thought he was better, that he knew it all.  That he knew how it would end, how it should end.  The leader of the light was fallible, but hardly anyone realized this until it was too late.  Until this was the only option.</p><p> </p><p>It was dark where they were hiding.  They couldn’t risk even the smallest of lights, so they spoke softly by the light of the moon.  He lay with his head in her lap, his body shaking with the tremors left behind from the last bought of the cruciatus curse that he had been struck with months ago.  </p><p>The Dark Lord had perverted the curse and made it almost impossible to recover from.  He was alive with his facilities remaining, because of the witch that held him close and the best friend that was lost as he helped them. escape.  He could feel her fingers, softly threading through his hair, knowing that this was about the only touch that he could currently bear.  All his nerve endings felt like they were on fire.</p><p>Tears streaked down his face; he knew that he did not have much time left, but he couldn’t bear to leave her alone.  Alone in the world that they could not save.  That she would continue to suffer in without him, without them.  They only had one shot at this.  He knew that she would never leave him, could never leave this world to chance.  Their world should not have ended this way, but there was no one left to save here, only then, only when.  </p><p>“Will he be able to come back with us?” He whispered softly while looking into her eyes.  </p><p>“He is holding on Severus, his vitals aren’t good, but they will hopefully allow for him to travel with us.” She admitted, softy tracing his eyebrows with the tips of her fingers.</p><p>“We will lose her, though won’t we?” He asked his eyes gliding softly over the roundness of her stomach.</p><p>Her eyes were glistening as she moved her shaking hand to caress the swell of her abdomen.  It wasn’t very pronounced as they had been without adequate food for months, but it was noticeable on her small frame.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, my love, we will lose her, but we would have lost her in the end anyway, one of them would have taken her and either made her a weapon against us or killed her as a way to defeat us.”</p><p>“It’s not fair. It’s not fair that this war is taking everything from us, that we must do this again because one old man wouldn’t listen and a rat wouldn’t leave the dead alone, because the government was corrupt from Moody on up to Crouch and Fudge.  You had no childhood and I had no life before you and he came into it and showed me how to love and how to be loved.  What will I do if I lose that?” Severus whispered as she continued pulling her fingers through his hair.</p><p>“You will never lose that!  I won’t let that happen!  You will Always belong to me and me to you.  He would be agreeing with me now if he knew your doubts.  This is not the end for us Severus, we will never be over.  In this life and our next we will be together.” Exclaimed Hermione determinedly. </p><p>“And if she is meant to be, she will join us too someday.” She said kissing his brow softly.  “We must have hope.”</p><p>“No Krum this time.” Severus growled before dissolving into a wheezing cough.</p><p>“Severus.”</p><p>“No Krum, he was your first.”</p><p>“And you were my last my love, but you are right.  No Viktor.” She smiled with a sigh for the wizard in her arms.<br/>
The shadows got darker and the blackness seemed to hum as his weight got heavier in her arms.  With the beckoning of the dawn, she slowly moved to lay his head down beside her.</p><p>“It is time?”</p><p>“It is time, close your eyes and when you open them again, the world will be new once more." She said with a sad smile</p><p>He looked at her, her beautiful brown eyes glossy but determined.  They shone with love for him and he would never doubt her again.  It was only through her careful planning and massive research skills that they even had this chance.  He had to believe that they would be together again, either in the past, which was their hope or into the beyond, their next life, he was determined to find them once again.</p><p> </p><p>“In this life and our next Hermione, I will always love the both of you.” whispered Severus, the crooked smile that she loved so much gracing his lips before he closed his eyes, leaving their future in her tiny, capable hands.</p>
