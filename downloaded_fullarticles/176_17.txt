  <em>The world was burning around him. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>He was clutching on to the edge of the bridge, pieces of stone breaking off and crumbling, not quite supporting his weight, and he clung on desperately, not quite knowing what he was doing except for an inborn instinct of survival that allowed him to keep his grasp on the bridge. </em>
</p>
<p><em>A grunt a few feet away from him caught his attention as the straining figure of his brot- of Thor was using Mjolnir to pull himself up, already halfway up on the bridge. Thundering footsteps brought the arrival of Odin, whose gaze swept over the two hanging over the bridge, and without a second’s hesitation, ran over to Thor who was already halfway up on the bridge. Loki felt something burning in the back of his throat, and to his utter horror, the same burning was etching its way up his throat to the back of his eyes, and he fought the urge to start blinking furiously. The same figure bent over his brother glanced over in his direction, filled with an intense emotion that Loki couldn’t quite place, along with something that he was intimately familiar with - </em>disappointment.</p>
<p>
  <em>Something deep in his heart twisted, and he looked over to Thor who was scrambling over to where he was, half stumbling, half crawling in his haste, desperation etched in his figure - “Brother!” - and Loki smirked half-heartedly, and in the moment their eyes met, Loki knew Thor saw - and understood, albeit reluctantly - what he was about to do, and was about to swing Mjolnir in his direction to fly over in time. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Loki ignored the tears fighting their way out of his eyes and down his cheek, smirking one last time at his brother, he looked over at Odin who was standing where Thor once was, unmoving and indifferent at Thor’s sudden pleas for help, and Loki clenched his fingers once more, closed his eyes - and let go. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The fall was blissful and oddly calm in a way he never thought possible, and with peals of lingering laughter and two vibrant eyes brought up to the front of his mind by a sheer will of force, he let a smile grace his lips - the sort that he hasn’t smiled since his death, and opened his arms to the cold yet soothing darkness. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I’m coming, Haraldr. </em>
