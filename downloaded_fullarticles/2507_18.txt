They were wrapped around him, blinking their way through their colour patterns.</p><p>“You could help, you ungrateful twat,” Harry muttered, only managing to get himself more tangled. He stilled, then looked over with wide eyes. “Hang on, you just called me Harry!”</p><p>Draco frowned. “It’s your name, unless there’s something you’d like to tell me.”</p><p>Harry shuffled over, his steps awkward from the lights he’d managed to wrap around his legs.</p><p>“It’s the first time you’ve called me that!”</p><p>Draco frowned as Harry got closer, bringing all the bright lights with him. “Surely not.”</p><p>When Harry reached him, he kissed him so suddenly and so forcefully that Draco unbalanced and went tumbling to the ground, arms full of Harry and all the stupid lights with him.</p><p>“It is,” Harry breathed, looking down at him, blinking lights in his hair. He looked like some kind of crazed Christmas spirit. “<em>Draco</em>.”</p><p>Draco shivered. “That’s the first time you’ve called me that.”</p><p>Harry grinned. The lights made his teeth look multi-coloured. “How does it make you feel?”</p><p>
  <em>Breathless.</em>
