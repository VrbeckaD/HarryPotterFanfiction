</center><p>Harry stifles a yawn as he walks down the street. His boots press into the thin layer of snow that had settled over the pavement during the night, and Harry pulls his cloak more snugly around his neck. </p>
<p>“It’s too bloody early,” Harry mutters, his breath coming out in vaporous puffs. </p>
<p>Susan gives a noncommittal grunt from beside him, though Harry knows she’s running on as little sleep as he is. They had been out at all hours the night before running down a fugitive. The Dark wizard hadn’t gone quietly, and it had been a battle for both of them to bring him down—an exhausting but satisfying ending to months of hunting.</p>
<p>It was already technically morning by the time Harry had got home to sleep the night before. When the call came in that they were needed at a crime scene in Horsa’s Rest, it was before sunrise, and Harry felt as if he’d only just laid his head on his pillow. </p>
<p>The early morning sky over Gravesend is a hazy orange, covered in a dense layer of clouds threatening to rain and turn what little snow there is to slush. Hidden behind the overcast sky, the dawning sun provides no warmth and only faint light which has turned the snowscape a uniform and bleak grey. </p>
<p>“Should be up here,” Susan says and gestures to a side street. </p>
<p>Normally they would Floo into Horsa’s Rest, rather than take the street entrance, but none of the shops are open yet. They turn down the side street, eying the stone walls and stopping when they come upon an old relief of a hippocampus rearing out of ocean waves. </p>

  </p>
</center><p>Harry shifts his gaze up and down the alley, but it’s rarely trafficked and at this time of morning it’s dead quiet. Susan taps her wand to the edge of the sculpture and casts, <em>“Aguamenti.”</em> </p>
<p>The water spills from her wand, travelling through the lines of waves in the relief until it’s all outlined in the rippling train of water. The carving comes to life, the waves rolling and crashing and the hippocampus diving below them and rearing back up out of the water. The sculpture stills and goes lifeless, and the stones beside it melt away to form a narrow passageway. </p>

  </p>
</center><p>Harry follows Susan through the entrance, which closes and leaves them in near pitch black but for a faint blue light at the end of the tunnel. The passage goes on for a while, and the further they go the more the air becomes chill and damp.</p>
<p>Upon exiting, the tunnel opens up to reveal a wide market. Magical shops of all sort line the street on either side, divided by a wide split in the middle which opens up to show the Thames rushing beneath them. </p>
<p>Harry and Susan press forward into the river district, and Harry’s gaze catches on the only other person out at this hour, an older wizard further up the street from them. He seems not to notice their presence, hunched against the cold and moving briskly on his way. </p>
<p>“I think it’s down Havering?” Susan says, squinting at the street signs.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Harry agrees, looking away from the wizard to help get their bearings. “Think it’s on the other side.” </p>
<p>Susan hums and leads them across one of the bridges, over the roar of the river to the other side of the thoroughfare. After a minute of walking, they find Havering Street and follow that before coming to an unnamed side street where they can see three wizards. Based on their navy coloured robes, Harry picks them out as the two responding officers from Magical Law Enforcement Patrol and a civilian.</p>
<p>“ ‘Bout time you lot showed up,” Officer Bryant says on their approach. Harry furrows his brow. He’s never been fond of Bryant or his partner, Peterson, standing several feet away talking to a tall wizard who has his back turned to them. </p>
<p>“Floos are closed this early,” Susan points out dryly. She’s never much liked them either and Harry knows she isn’t any more keen to deal with them on this frigid January morning than Harry is. “We were told there’s a body,” she says, moving straight to the point. </p>
<p>“Down there,” Bryant says, jerking his thumb over his shoulder, presumably, to the alley behind him. “We sent the second vic, a Charles Goodwin, to St Mungo’s. Peterson’s talking to our <em>witness.”</em> </p>
<p>Harry narrows his eyes at Bryant, then looks past him to the wizard talking to Peterson. His arms are crossed defensively, and he is almost pressed to the building next to him. Peterson is leaning into his space with a hard expression on his face and speaking in an unfriendly tone that rankles Harry. </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>
    <img width="80%" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/459028323801235457/521492354264203266/Draco_-_Horsas_Rest_4.png" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1692840" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1692840" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/>
  </p>
</center><p>Bryant turns and moves toward his partner. Harry and Susan follow, walking up to Peterson and the witness. His hair is an almost white blond that reminds Harry of—</p>
<p>“Malfoy?” Harry blurts as the wizard turns and locks eyes with him, all forward momentum halting at the sight of him.</p>
<p>“Potter,” Malfoy breathes, looking as surprised as Harry feels. His lips part and he stares at Harry wide-eyed for a moment, then his eyes dart to Susan and he regains his composure. “Bones.” He greets her with a tight nod, which she returns. </p>
<p>It’s been years since Harry last set eyes on Malfoy and he does a cursory once over, taking in the way his features have matured, just as sharp but less cartoonish now that he’s grown into them. His pale hair is a bit longer than Harry remembers, parted and waving to his left in a natural way that looks too effortless to actually be effortless. </p>
<p>Malfoy’s nose and cheeks are flushed pink from the cold, and his hands are tucked tightly under his arms. He’s wrapped in a cream wool scarf and thick, black winter robes that stretch over broad shoulders and flow down a lean frame. </p>
<p>Susan seems to be doing her own assessment of Malfoy, and when Harry shifts his gaze to her, she looks up at him. They share a meaningful glance. Years of working together has created a finely tuned understanding between them of how they think and act together. </p>
<p>“We’ll take it from here. Give us your report by the end of the day,” Harry dismisses the officers. Usually there would be a ‘please’ in there, but not this morning, and not for Peterson or Bryant. </p>
<p>Peterson clicks his tongue irritably but closes his notepad and tucks it and his quill into one of the pouches hanging from his belt. </p>
<p>“And we’ll take any evidence you collected,” Susan adds. Bryant doesn’t look happy about it, but he pulls a labelled vial and a wand from his robes and hands them to Harry. </p>
<p>“Wand belonged to the dead guy,” Bryant grunts and then they both turn to leave. </p>
<p>“Aurors,” Peterson mutters contemptuously, loud enough that he knows Harry and Susan will hear him. The crack of their Disapparation echoes up the empty, snow-covered street. </p>
<p>Harry turns his attention back to Malfoy and he notes how some of the tension has left his posture. Malfoy is eyeing Susan curiously, but his gaze snaps to Harry when he addresses him.</p>
<p>“Didn’t know you were back,” Harry comments, sliding his hands into his pockets to warm them. </p>
<p>“Should I have made an announcement in the papers?” Malfoy shoots back irritably and hugs his arms more tightly to his chest. </p>
<p>Harry shakes his head and answers calmly, “Just surprised to see you here.” </p>
<p>“Well, here I am,” Malfoy says impatiently. “The other officers already took my statement. Can I go? I’m getting rather tired of standing out in the cold, repeating myself.”</p>
<p>“Not yet,” Susan tells him. “We’d rather hear from you what happened. You witnessed the event?”</p>
<p>Malfoy’s gaze shifts to Susan and he sighs shortly through his nose. “No, I didn’t. I was walking down the street and saw movement from the alley. Charles was dragging himself—”</p>
<p>“Charles?” Susan asks. </p>
<p>“The—the victim. The one that’s alive,” Malfoy clarifies, glancing from Susan to Harry. </p>
<p>Harry nods and prompts him to continue. “He was dragging himself?”</p>
<p>“Yes, dragging himself from the alley.”</p>
<p>“Was he injured?” Harry asks. </p>
<p>“No. I don’t know, not that I could see. He’s a cripple, he’d lost his prosthetic leg in the fight,” Malfoy explains brusquely. “He saw me and called for help. When I saw the body, I called you lot and then the two oafs—excuse me, the two officers showed up. That’s all I know.”</p>
<p>“And you didn’t see anything else?”</p>
<p>“No. Exactly what I said,” Malfoy answers. “May I go now?” </p>
<p>Harry glances to Susan, and she gives a minute shake of her head. He purses his lips, but he knows she’s right and they can’t let Malfoy go without interviewing him more thoroughly.</p>
<p>“It’d be better if we could get an official statement from you now, while it’s fresh,” Harry says. Malfoy opens his mouth to argue, but Harry presses on over him. “I know you’ve been stuck out here in the cold, but if you’ll give us a moment, we can do it in the Ministry over a hot cup of tea, alright?” </p>
<p>Malfoy watches Harry warily for a moment, looking between him and Susan, and then answers, “Fine. But be quick about it, would you?”</p>
<p>“Sure thing, Malfoy,” Harry says with an amused smile. </p>
<p>Harry and Susan move past Malfoy toward the alley. In the alley they come across Dennis taking photos of the crime scene. Dennis looks up from his camera and grins when he sees Harry.</p>
<p>“Hiya, Harry,” he says.</p>
<p>“Hey, Dennis,” Harry says with a more reserved smile. “You done here?” </p>
<p>Dennis glances around the scene, then nods. “Yeah, I think so.”</p>
<p>“Great, send us the photos as soon as you’ve finished processing them,” he says. </p>
<p>Dennis hesitates, glancing between Harry and Susan, then he nods and Disapparates.</p>
<p>Harry looks down the alley at the male body twisted and lying face-up on the pavement, then glances down the alley and around the area while Susan moves forward to get a closer look. </p>
<p>The street is still eerily devoid of people, everything a hazy blue from the snow and the dim light through the overcast sky. His gaze moves down and follows the footprints in the snow, tracking a pair that come up the street and into the alley from the opposite direction they had. They look like they originate from the building on the corner of the street with a bright pink sign that reads, ‘The Siren’s Song,’ and Harry takes them as belonging to the victims. </p>
<p>As Malfoy said, there is one long track that looks like someone dragged themself through the snow. Three more pairs of footprints move through the crime scene, probably the officers and Dennis, though the snow is the most disturbed and hardest to read in the area around the body. The last set of footprints comes from the other side of the street in a long, running stride, which must be Malfoy. </p>
<p>Susan is next to the body, running her wand over it with the usual forensic spells. Harry notes the victim to be a skinny, white, brunet male who is probably in his thirties. His clothing is cheap and worn, and his features are weathered in way that gives the impression that he’s lived a rough life. From the pained expression frozen on the victim’s face and the way his appendages are curled inward, the cause of death is easy enough to guess without forensic charms. </p>
<p>Harry can feel Malfoy’s presence behind him, and he glances over his shoulder to find Malfoy staring at the body with a hollow expression. Harry watches his Adam’s apple bob, then his eyes flick over to Harry and his mouth tightens minutely. </p>
<p>“He was Cruciated,” Malfoy says quietly with a short nod toward the body. “Tortured to death.”</p>
<p>Susan looks up from her work and eyes Malfoy suspiciously. “Thought you said you didn’t see what happened.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t,” Malfoy snaps defensively. He darts another glance to Harry and furrows his brow. “It’s a very distinct looking death. Not the kind one would forget easily.” </p>
<p>Susan doesn’t look happy with his answer, but it’s true, and Harry is not surprised that it’s something Malfoy is familiar with. </p>
<p>Harry moves into the alley and Susan continues her work analyzing the corpse. There are scorch marks around a damaged area of one of the walls, and Harry inspects it a moment before drawing his wand. He points it at the damaged area and casts, <em>“Resono Incantato.”</em></p>
<p>The mark glows a faint orange at first, which then shifts and billows outward explosively—most likely a <em>Confringo.</em> The glow extends out from the wall like a tail, showing the trajectory of the spell that originates from their dead victim. </p>
<p>The ground near him is covered in hundreds of shards of wood, and Harry crouches down to get a better look. He reaches into his robe to his evidence pouch and pulls out the vial Bryant handed him. It has several wood shards in it and is labelled, ‘Unidentified wood near dead vic.’</p>
<p>Harry squints at them, then puts the vial away again to test them later. He glances over to Susan, who is still analysing the corpse.</p>
<p>The body is glowing a sickly yellow from Susan’s <em>Resono,</em> the colour seeming to ooze and bubble out of it, confirming that their victim was Cruciated. A string of yellow tendrils curl out from the aura, creeping to where Harry is standing. </p>
<p>Harry frowns and hums, looks down at the ground to the track of their victim dragging himself out of the alley, which starts right about where the <em>Crucio</em> originates. </p>
<p>“Our other victim?” Harry says, and Susan nods at him. </p>
<p>“He was Imperiused,” Malfoy supplies from the entrance of the alley, frowning and crossing his arms over his chest. </p>
<p>Susan looks to Malfoy, then back at Harry and says, “Like the others.”</p>
<p>“Except not quite,” Harry says with a nod toward the body. “No bodies at any of the other robberies.”</p>
<p>“Maybe they’re escalating?” Susan looks thoughtfully at the body, then around at the scene. “Should have got the full story before sending Bryant and Peterson off.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather read it in their report than have to talk to them before my morning coffee,” Harry mutters, and Susan snorts and shakes her head, but it’s an agreeable sort of way. </p>
<p>He waves away the echoes of the spells with a <em>Deletrius</em> and moves next to the body, crouching down to rifle through the pockets of their victim’s robes. Susan watches, and when Harry comes up empty-handed, he shakes his head at her. </p>
<p>“Robbed then? Nothing on him, no jewelry, not even a Knut, like the others,” Susan says and Harry nods. “Bryant and Peterson didn’t have any of his personal effects?” </p>
<p>Harry shakes his head then gestures at the victim. “His robes are open too. He would have been buttoned up in this weather.” </p>
<p>“The officers might have done that, searching him.”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Harry says. He turns back to look at Malfoy and asks him, “Were his clothes like this when you found him?”</p>
<p>Malfoy blinks and looks from Harry to the body. “I—I don’t know, maybe? I think so.” </p>
<p>Susan frowns and Harry hums, looking back to the body. “Well, we’ll check the photos,” he says. “What time did it start snowing? You remember?” </p>
<p>“Hmm, about four?” Susan answers thoughtfully, scrunching her brow. “Half past, actually. It started right after we left the office.” </p>
<p>“Yeah,” Harry says, nodding slowly. It sounds about right. “His robes are wet, so they were out sometime while it was snowing. After four, before dawn. Looks like they came from the strip club down the street, maybe they left around closing?” </p>
<p>Susan nods in agreement. “Smells like he was drinking. Let’s take a look.”</p>
<p>Harry and Susan stand and leave the alley, following the pair of tracks down the block to the entrance of the strip club.</p>
<p>“Tracks are pretty clear, mustn't have snowed for long after they left,” Susan comments.</p>
<p>Harry looks at the sign posted next to the door declaring their hours. “Opens at nine, closes at six in the morning.” </p>
<p>He tries the door, but it’s locked as expected and no lights are on inside. They’ll have to come back later to question the employees. </p>
<p>Back up the street, Malfoy is still standing next to the alley with his arms crossed, looking more peevish than ever. Harry looks down at Susan and meets her gaze. Susan frowns at him, and Harry raises an eyebrow. She huffs and rolls her eyes. </p>
<p>“I took the last one,” Harry reminds her. Neither of them like delivering bodies to the morgue, so they’ve taken to switching off who has that duty.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah,” Susan mutters. “Dealing with the coroner might be preferable to dealing with Malfoy anyway.”</p>
<p>Harry snorts out a laugh, and they head back toward Malfoy and the crime scene. Before getting there, Susan tells him, “Don’t start without me.” </p>
<p>Harry nods and she moves back into the alley, drawing her wand and conjuring a body bag that encloses the corpse in itself. She grabs the handle of the bag and Disapparates with a loud crack that echoes through the alley.</p>
<p>Once she’s gone, Harry puts up a ward and conjures a warning sign at the entrance of the alley to keep people out. </p>
<p>“Are you done?” Malfoy asks impatiently. “Or are you going for a peep show while you’re here?” He jerks his chin toward the strip club.</p>
<p>“Nah, I’ll come back for that later,” he jokes dryly and Malfoy rolls his eyes so hard Harry wonders that he doesn’t hurt himself doing it. A warm feeling of nostalgia curls in his chest at the sight, and Harry is briefly thrown back to eighth year and the many times he’d deliberately said something irreverent to get this reaction out of Malfoy.</p>
<p>Harry wonders if it shows in his expression, because the tense lines in Malfoy’s face ease as he watches him. </p>
<p>“Side-Along?” Harry asks and holds out his arm in offering. </p>
<p>Malfoy looks down at it and frowns, but then he puts a hand on Harry’s forearm and says, “Fine.” </p>
<p>Harry moves his hand over his thigh and summons his wand to it from his thigh holster. He imagines the Apparition point at the Ministry clearly in his mind, and then Apparates them there. </p>
<p>The familiar, tight, nearly-unbearable sensation of Apparition lasts barely a few seconds, with Harry feeling like he’s fused to Malfoy where they’re touching, before they appear in one of the Apparition booths in the Ministry. </p>
<p>The booth is slightly too small for two grown wizards to be Apparating in together, and Malfoy bumps into Harry’s shoulder and jostles him. “Sorry,” he mutters. </p>
<p>The door to the landing booth slides open, but Harry stops Malfoy from exiting by gripping his wrist when Malfoy tries to walk past.</p>
<p>“You need a visitor’s badge,” he says and gestures at the button next to the door.</p>
<p>Malfoy makes an irritated noise, but he pushes the button and the booth is filled with a tinny female voice. </p>
<p>“Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and the purpose of your visit.”</p>
<p>“Draco Malfoy,” Malfoy says, hesitating and glancing at Harry before finishing, “Witness interview.” </p>
<p>“Thank you, visitor,” the monotone voice responds. “Please take the badge and attach it to your robes.”</p>
<p>The badge falls down into the dispenser with a metallic clank. Malfoy picks it up and fumbles with it a moment before he gets it on his robes. </p>
<p>Once Malfoy is situated, Harry moves out of the booth and into the Atrium. Malfoy takes a few quick strides to catch up. Floos flare to life on either side of them with witches and wizards starting to filter in to work.</p>
<p>As Malfoy keeps stride beside him, Harry sends a curious look his way. He watches how Malfoy’s eyes rove over the entrance floor of the Ministry, catching on the new fountain which had replaced the Magic is Might monument after the War. </p>
<p>The fountain has a wizard, a witch, a goblin, a house-elf, and a centaur standing in a ring back-to-back, protecting a pair of Muggles in the centre. It had been put up as a symbol of magical beings standing together equally and protecting Muggles. Harry wonders if this is the first time Malfoy has seen it—if this is the first time he has been in the Ministry since the trials.</p>
<p>Malfoy’s brows furrow thoughtfully as he takes it in, and then his gaze moves away and zeroes in on the security checkpoint they’re heading for at the far end of the Atrium. </p>
<p>“I’ll have to take your wand while you’re here,” Harry tells him. Malfoy’s eyes snap to his and his mouth pinches in a frown. “Standard protocol.” </p>
<p>Malfoy’s expression is calculating. “And I take it you’ll be testing it for any Unforgivables recently cast? Like a <em>Crucio?</em> Or an <em>Imperio?”</em> he asks. “Even though <em>I</em> was the one who reported the crime?”</p>
<p>“Even so,” Harry says with a nod. “You were found with a victim murdered by Dark Arts. You know we have to. It’s—”</p>
<p>“Standard protocol, I know,” Malfoy cuts him off. </p>
<p>As they approach the security checkpoint, the bored looking security officer perks up from her slouched position and greets Harry with a friendly smile. “Good morning, Auror Potter.” </p>
<p>Harry casts around for her name and comes up with it before his pause gets awkward. “Good morning, Samantha.”</p>
<p>“Escorting a visitor?” she asks, eyes cutting over to Malfoy. </p>
<p>Harry nods, then looks at Malfoy and jerks his chin in gesture. Malfoy steps up to the security witch, and she waves a thin golden rod over Malfoy’s front and back. When she finishes with that, she sets the Dark Detector aside. </p>
<p>“Wand, please,” she requests politely. </p>
<p>Malfoy pulls his wand from his robe and hands it to her. Harry notices the moment Samantha reads the name on Malfoy’s visitor’s badge. Her expression shifts from open to distrustful and her eyes drop to Malfoy’s arm. She’s not looking to the wand held out in his left hand, but at his covered forearm. </p>
<p>It all happens in the span of a breath, and then Samantha takes Malfoy’s wand and sets it on the wand measuring device, which looks like a single silver scale on top of a small wooden box. The box whirs and vibrates, then a piece of paper drops out of a thin slot at the bottom.</p>
<p>“Twelve and a half inches, Dwarf Beech, horned serpent horn, and it’s been active for five years?” Samantha asks cooly.</p>
<p>Harry turns a surprised look on Malfoy, but Malfoy ignores him. “Correct,” he answers her, holding her eye contact defiantly. </p>
<p>The security witch looks to Harry and he says, “I’ll be taking charge of his wand.” </p>
<p>She nods and hands the wand over to him, then impales the wand’s identification slip onto a brass spike on her desk.</p>
<p>Malfoy’s expression is the same lofty and unbothered one he wore walking down the halls of Hogwarts in their eighth year. Harry carefully tucks Malfoy’s wand away into one of his evidence pouches, then tilts his head in gesture and they head to the lift. </p>
<p>“You don’t use the Hawthorn wand anymore?” Harry asks curiously.</p>
<p>“No,” Malfoy answers curtly. Harry watches him, the obvious question written in his expression, until Malfoy gives in and explains, “I outgrew it. It doesn’t suit me anymore.”</p>
<p>Harry hums a curious note. As they wait for the lift, he lets his eyes run the length of Malfoy’s form and take in how he has changed from the boy Harry once knew. The ride up to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement is a silent one. </p>
<p>Harry casually exchanges greetings with his co-workers as he walks through the department, heading to the interview rooms on the far side. Malfoy appears to be ignoring the many pairs of eyes staring at him and walks beside Harry with his nose tilted up imperiously. </p>
<p>“Make yourself comfortable, I’ll just grab that tea for you,” Harry says after leading him into Interview Room Three. “How do you like it?”</p>
<p>Malfoy looks at the cheap, uncomfortable chairs in the room disdainfully. “Do you have any Matcha?”</p>
<p>Harry has to pause and think, trying to imagine the hodge podge mix of teas stuffed in the pantry of the break room. “Probably not,” he eventually answers.</p>
<p>“Rooibos then?” Malfoy asks, and Harry nods. “No sugar, splash of milk.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” he says and leaves Malfoy in the interview room, shutting the door behind him. Rather than the break room, Harry heads for the Auror Department and into his and Susan’s office. He hangs up his cloak, then checks his inbox for Peterson and Bryant’s report, and he isn’t surprised to see it hasn’t come in yet. Harry glances at the few messages that are in his inbox, but there’s nothing too pressing. </p>
<p>Harry collapses into his desk chair and leans back as far as it’ll go. He pushes his glasses up and rubs his hands over his eyes, then down his face. Stubble scrapes under his palms, and he only then realises that he’d forgot to shave in the morning rush. Now that he thinks about it, Harry realises he didn’t shave yesterday either.</p>
<p>With a loud yawn, Harry stretches his arms up, then threads his fingers together and cups the back of his head in his hands. He closes his eyes and starts to relax, letting his mind wander over the case and Malfoy as he waits for Susan to get back from the morgue. Harry can’t help thinking how strange it is to see him now after all this time with no contact, and at a crime scene of all places. </p>
<p>It’s odd. The whole thing is odd, really. It looks like another hit in a string of robberies he and Susan have spent the last three months investigating, but it’s also different. And Malfoy’s presence isn’t just strange, it’s suspicious. Harry knows that’s what Susan is thinking, and what Peterson and Bryant thought. Still, it irks him to think about Malfoy doing the right thing by reporting a crime and then getting blamed for it because of his history.</p>
<p>Malfoy’s sudden return to England is not something Harry had been anticipating, especially after his mysterious disappearance during eighth year. He appears to be in good shape, but Harry can’t stop the flood of questions, chief among them being—where has Malfoy been for the last eight years, and what has he been up to?</p>
<p>The door to their office bangs open and Harry cracks an eye to watch Susan storm in. She rips her cloak off and throws it onto the coat rack, glaring all the while. It’s been at least thirty minutes since Susan left with the body, and Harry knows she spent the majority of that time stuck in a conversation with their overly-chatty coroner, trying to escape from him.</p>
<p>“That's it!” she snaps, spinning to face Harry and throwing her hands up in frustration. “I’m getting him a damn kneazle!”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh,” Harry says skeptically, fighting a smile. He’s lost count of how many times she’s already made this threat.</p>
<p>“I really am this time! It’ll be—it’ll be a late Christmas present,” she says with a determined frown.</p>
<p>“Isn’t he Muslim?” Harry asks, dropping his arms and sitting up in his chair.</p>
<p>“Right—for Eid, then,” she says impatiently.</p>
<p>“Think you missed that one too.”</p>
<p>Susan groans irritably and looks heavenward in her exasperation. “Well then it’ll be a, ‘If I have to listen to one more word about autolysis I’m going to puke’ kneazle.”</p>
<p>“He’s probably lonely down there,” Harry says.</p>
<p>“Hence the kneazle. Maybe if he has company, he wouldn’t talk everyone’s ears off all the time,” Susan says. “If he wasn’t such a nice guy, I’d just tell him to put a sock in it.”</p>
<p>“But those puppy dog eyes.” Harry knows only too well how easily their excitable and extroverted coroner can reel a person into a long conversation they never wanted to be a part of in the first place.</p>
<p>“Those puppy dog eyes,” Susan agrees with a knowing nod. She puts her hands on her hips, inhales deeply and then sighs. After a moment, she levels a look at Harry and furrows her brow. “Malfoy’s not what I expected.”</p>
<p>“Me neither,” Harry says with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>Susan pauses then says, “Coffee?”</p>
<p>“Coffee.” Harry gets up and follows her to the break room. Luckily, someone has already put the pot on and it doesn’t take long before Harry is finally having his first sip of morning coffee. Susan seems just as relieved to get the much needed shot of caffeine. </p>
<p>Once he’s downed the cup, Harry checks the kettle and finds it already filled with hot water. He digs through the tea pantry, finds a box of Rooibos, and then makes Malfoy a cup.</p>
<p>Susan follows Harry to Interview Room Three and once they enter, Malfoy’s head snaps up and he watches them with an annoyed expression.</p>
<p>“Took you long enough,” Malfoy says, accepting the tea from Harry and hesitantly sipping at it.</p>
<p>“Good?” Harry asks.</p>
<p>Malfoy frowns but says, “Fine. Can we get this over with?”</p>
<p>“You’ve some place to be?” Susan asks and sits down at the table across from Malfoy. She pulls out a roll of parchment and a quill.</p>
<p>“Don’t we all?” Malfoy asks with a raised eyebrow. </p>
<p>Susan leans back in her chair and doesn’t answer. Harry steps back from the table. He crosses his arms and leans against the wall, letting her lead the interview for now. </p>

  </p>
</center><p>Malfoy glances between them, then huffs. “I have work to do.”</p>
<p>“Where do you work?” Susan asks, flattening the parchment over the table and then setting the end of her self-inking quill to it, ready to take notes.</p>
<p>“I have my own workshop,” Malfoy says, leaning back and crossing his arms. “Is this relevant?”</p>
<p>“We just want to know what happened,” Harry says placatingly.</p>
<p>Malfoy’s gaze slides to him and he frowns. “Then ask me about what happened.” </p>
<p>“Alright, then walk us through it,” Susan prompts him. </p>
<p>Malfoy looks back to Susan. “As I said before, I was walking down the street when I saw one of your victims, the one that’s still breathing obviously, crawling out of the alley.”</p>
<p>“What time was that at?” she asks.</p>
<p>“Twilight,” Malfoy responds initially, then pauses and thinks about it. “Half past seven, about.”</p>
<p>“Okay, go on.” She nods.</p>
<p>Malfoy reaches forward to pick up his tea and take a sip before continuing. “So, the wizard is pulling himself out of the alley, he spots me and starts shouting for help. I run over to him, and I ask him...something. I don’t know. What’s happened? Are you hurt? Things like that. He tells me he was Imperiused, his friend needs help. He doesn’t know if his friend is alive or dead. I go to check on him, and…” </p>
<p>Malfoy pauses and his expression becomes distant. Harry notes that his tone and his hands are steady, and this is the first outward sign of being bothered by it all. </p>

  </p>
</center><p>Malfoy swallows and continues, “He was definitely dead.”</p>
<p>“You checked him?” Susan clarifies.</p>
<p>“No,” Malfoy says and shakes his head shortly. “No. It was obvious. The—his position and the stillness of him. It was clear he was already dead. I backed off, checked on Charles—the one who was still alive. He was laying in the snow, crying. I helped him up, but he said his prosthetic leg got destroyed in the fight.”</p>
<p>“Did he say anything else to you?” Susan asks. </p>
<p>“Yeah,” Malfoy says and nods, glancing between her and Harry. “He said he killed his friend. That’s when I called you lot.”</p>
<p>“And, to your recollection, did he say anything after that?”</p>
<p>“Of course, he was blubbering all sorts of things—Oh Merlin, what have I done? I didn’t mean to; I wasn’t in control; why did he fight back? He told me whoever Imperiused him wanted all their money and valuables. He said earlier that night they’d won big at gambling and had a lot of money on them.”</p>
<p>Susan glances to Harry and they share a brief look. </p>
<p>“And his friend fought him when he tried to take it?” she asks.</p>
<p>Malfoy shrugs. “I suppose. I don’t know. That’s what it sounded like.”</p>
<p>“Anything else?” </p>
<p>“Like what?” Malfoy shoots back at her impatiently. </p>
<p>“Did he say or do anything else? Did you do anything else?” she responds evenly.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, he kept repeating more of the same. I just sat with him until the officers arrived,” Malfoy says. He pauses, then adds, “I guess I healed a goosebump he had on his head. He said he’d fallen and the blow had knocked him out of the curse.” </p>
<p>Susan hums acknowledgement and scribbles notes on her parchment. When she’s finished, she looks back to Malfoy and says, “Okay, so you say you found them at dawn—”</p>
<p>“Before dawn, seven thirty,” Malfoy corrects her. </p>
<p>“Right, before dawn,” she says, marking it on the paper. </p>
<p>“You were across the street from them?” Harry asks, moving forward and sitting at the table next to Susan. </p>
<p>Malfoy watches him with a furrowed brow and answers, “Yes.” </p>
<p>“You didn’t hear any screaming or anything to indicate what was going on before then?” Harry asks. </p>
<p>Malfoy glances between Susan and Harry, then shakes his head. “No, I didn’t hear anything.”</p>
<p>“But you must have been nearby when it was happening,” Harry says. “Had you been in one of the shops?”</p>
<p>“No, I wasn’t in any of those shops.”</p>
<p>“Because they were all closed at that time,” Harry agrees with a nod. “Unless you had also come from the strip club?”</p>
<p>Malfoy’s mouth drops open, and he stares at Harry in shock. Harry quirks an eyebrow at him as if to say, ‘Well?’</p>
<p>“I don’t know what it is you think you’re implying, but I most certainly was <em>not</em> in that place or any such establishment,” Malfoy fumes, his tone and expression openly offended and all Harry reads in it is truth. “And you bloody well know I wouldn’t have been.”</p>
<p>“Why’s that?” Susan jumps in, shooting Harry a curious look.</p>
<p>“Because I’m gay, Bones. Ask your partner, he knows.” </p>
<p>Susan tilts her head at him in question, but Harry waves her off—he’ll explain later. “Relax Malfoy, I’m not trying to imply anything. You’re a smart man, and you know how this looks. We’re trying to understand exactly what happened.”</p>
<p>“I’ve told you what happened,” Malfoy snaps. </p>
<p>“I know, and we appreciate your cooperation helping us figure this out,” Harry says in a calm and amiable tone. “I just want to know what you were doing there.” </p>
<p>“I was taking a walk,” Malfoy says.</p>
<p>“A walk?” Susan asks, her hand stilling briefly over the parchment.</p>
<p>“Yes, a walk,” Malfoy repeats irritably. “I like to go for walks in the morning. Is that a crime? Are you going to arrest me for that?”</p>
<p>“No,” Harry says. “It’s just a strange place for a walk. Not really a good part of town. That street is only known for its nightlife.”</p>
<p>“Well I didn’t know that,” Malfoy says defensively, crossing his arms over his chest. “I was merely exploring the area.”</p>
<p>“Exploring? You’re not familiar with it?” Harry asks. </p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“But you’re staying nearby?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Malfoy answers tersely. “I have a property just off the river, on the outskirts of the town.”</p>
<p>“How long have you been there?” Harry presses. </p>
<p>Malfoy glances down at the parchment Susan is taking notes on before looking back at Harry and saying, “About six weeks.”</p>
<p>“And you moved from…?”</p>
<p>Malfoy gives Harry an annoyed look, sitting forward and unfolding his arms to put a hand out palm-up. “Is this really relevant?”</p>
<p>Susan looks up from her parchment and says, “It’s all helpful, Malfoy. If you would.”</p>
<p>He looks at her and sighs, running his tongue over his bottom lip. “France,” he eventually answers.</p>
<p>It’s the same vague answer he’d given Harry after leaving Hogwarts, and Harry is as disappointed in his answer now as he was then. “Why did you move back to England?”</p>
<p>Malfoy’s eyes snap back to Harry and he says, “Because I thought it was time. Because I thought maybe I could walk through the streets again without being ostracized or berated or unjustly accused of crimes I didn’t commit.” His tone becomes more heated by the second and he’s looking at Harry in pure righteous fury.</p>
<p>Harry holds up his hands placatingly. “We’re not accusing you of anything, Malfoy. We’re just trying to get the facts.”</p>
<p>“What <em>facts?”</em> Malfoy spits. “I’ve already told you everything I know. Several times. Now you’re just fishing.”</p>
<p>“We do the same with anyone associated with an Unforgivable. Especially a murder,” Harry explains. “I know you can understand why we have to get all the details possible. Your honesty now will go a long way toward clearing your name.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know I needed to clear my name,” Malfoy says with a shake of his head. “But I should have known the moment I called the Ministry that you would try to pin this on me. Once a snake, always a snake, right? Well, I’m not going to Azkaban for something I didn’t do. <em>I </em>reported the bloody crime!” </p>
<p>“We know,” Harry says, keeping a calm and level tone even in the face of Malfoy’s wroth. “We’re just trying to understand what happened and you are our only witness—the only person who can help us figure this out. Please, Malfoy.” </p>
<p>Malfoy watches Harry for a long moment, his brow scrunched and his sharp gaze assessing. Finally, he releases a short sigh through his nose and waves a hand in assent. “Fine, just—let’s get this over with. What do you want to know?” </p>
<p>“Do you know either of the victims?” Susan jumps back into the line of questioning. </p>
<p>“No,” Malfoy answers curtly.</p>
<p>“You’ve never met either of them before?” Harry reiterates. </p>
<p><em>“No.”</em> Malfoy says again more firmly. </p>
<p>“So, you were taking a walk this morning when you found them both,” Susan prompts him.</p>
<p>“Yes, I was taking a walk—”</p>
<p>“From which direction did you come?” Harry cuts in, and Malfoy shoots him a glare.</p>
<p>“From the East side,” he says, and Susan writes it down. “I was walking up the street, heading West. I saw the one crawling out of the alley, calling for help.”</p>
<p>“What time was this?” Susan asks. </p>
<p>“About seven thirty in the morning, before dawn,” Malfoy says again, his tone strained with impatience. “I ran to help. The one in alley was dead already. The cripple was distraught. I helped him up, calmed him down, healed his goosebump and called the police. That’s it.”</p>
<p>The room goes silent for a moment except for the scratch of Susan’s quill on the parchment, and then she stops and looks up at Malfoy. “And that was the last spell you cast?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Malfoy says and nods. </p>
<p>Susan looks to Harry, and he reaches under his robes to get Malfoy’s wand from his evidence pouch. </p>
<p>“And we can test your wand and see that this is the last spell you used?” she asks after Harry holds up the wand in question. </p>
<p>“By all means,” Malfoy drawls and waves a hand magnanimously. </p>
<p>Harry draws his own wand from his thigh holster and then puts it tip-to-tip with Malfoy’s wand. <em>“Prior Incantato,”</em> he casts clearly and gently pulls his wand away from Malfoy’s, drawing out his last spell. </p>
<p>A thread of green magic is pulled from Malfoy’s wand, then it disconnects from Harry’s wand and spreads out to form a convex bowl. It shifts to a richer, bluer shade of green, almost aquamarine as it forms into the shape of a human forehead with a large bump on it. The magic drops and ripples over the goosebump, which then shrinks and dissipates completely. </p>
<p><em>“Deletrius,”</em> Harry murmurs and sweeps away the ghost of Malfoy’s last spell. </p>
<p>“Satisfied?” Malfoy asks, crossing his arms and sitting back in his chair. His gaze sweeps back and forth between them. </p>
<p>Harry and Susan both look at each other to confirm that they’re both finished. </p>
<p>Susan looks back to Malfoy and says, “Would you be willing to submit your memory into evidence to assist in our investigation?”</p>
<p>Malfoy’s eyebrows both go up and he looks between them as if appalled by the question. “Really?” he asks. “After you’ve already interrogated me?”</p>
<p>“It would be helpful,” Harry says. “Unless you’ve got something to hide.”</p>
<p>Malfoy narrows his eyes at Harry, his lip twitching like he wants to curl it up into a sneer but he’s fighting the urge. “Fine,” he says and holds out a hand expectantly. </p>
<p>Harry reaches down into his evidence pouch, pulling out an empty vial and handing it to Malfoy. Malfoy takes it and holds out his hand again, and Harry gives him his wand. </p>
<p>Malfoy unstoppers the vial, holding it ready in his right hand with his wand in his left. He closes his eyes and then touches the tip of his wand to his temple, slowly drawing the memory out. The wispy, silver strings stretch out and then break off and flutter down, hanging off the end of Malfoy’s wand. He guides the memory gently down into the vial, then pushes the cork back into the top. </p>
<p>Harry takes the memory and Malfoy’s wand from him. He taps his own wand to the vial to conjure a label on it, and then he tucks them both away safely into one of his pouches. </p>
<p>Malfoy watches Harry, then glances to Susan and says, “Is that it then? Anything else? Maybe a bit of torture while you’re at it? Or are we going straight to the wrongful arrest?”</p>
<p>“You’re not under arrest, Malfoy,” Susan tells him and stands up, collecting her scroll and quill. “We’ll contact you if we need to speak to you again on this matter. Thank you for coming down and giving us your cooperation.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t have much of a choice, now did I?” Malfoy says waspishly. </p>
<p>Susan’s mouth thins, but she doesn’t say anything back. She starts to leave the room and Harry moves to follow her.</p>
<p>“Potter, may I have a word?” Malfoy asks, freezing Harry in place half out of his seat. </p>
<p>Susan looks back at him and Harry catches her gaze, then he nods at her and sits back down. “Sure, Malfoy.” </p>
<p>Malfoy watches Susan leave and close the door behind her, and then he turns a glare on Harry.</p>
<p>“You’re an arsehole, you know that?” Malfoy spits, and Harry’s brows draw up in surprise. “Witness statement, my arse. That was nothing short of an interrogation.” </p>
<p>Harry fights down a smile. “You were at a crime scene where Unforgivables were cast. What did you expect?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know, maybe a little human decency?” Malfoy asks sarcastically. “Maybe not being railroaded because of my history?”</p>
<p>“You’re not being railroaded,” Harry says and Malfoy scoffs. “You’re not. We would treat anyone with the same level of suspicion. It’s standard protocol.” </p>
<p>Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Really? Those questions were all standard protocol? None of them were you taking a jab at me?” </p>
<p>“It’s all important to the case and establishing your innocence,” Harry answers evenly. </p>
<p>“Of course,” Malfoy drawls, sounding the opposite of convinced. His mouth pinches and he looks down at the table as his fingers tap out a nervous rhythm on it. After a moment he glances up to Harray and says uncertainly, “I thought we’d moved beyond the petty fighting in eighth year, Potter. I thought we’d—I thought we were friends.” </p>
<p>Harry hesitates, reading the unusual display of insecurity in Malfoy’s skittish body language and the way his eyes dart between Harry’s. </p>
<p>“We were,” he agrees with a nod. “But it’s been a long time, Malfoy. If you want me to remain on this case, I have to be objective. I can’t treat you with favouritism. And I do want to remain on the case.” </p>
<p>Malfoy’s brow scrunches as he watches Harry and considers his words. </p>
<p>“Do you want someone like Peterson or Bryant investigating this? Because I don’t,” Harry says. “I want to give you the benefit of the doubt. I’m probably the only person here that does.” </p>
<p>Malfoy is quiet a moment, and then the corner of his mouth tips up in a small smile. “Should you be telling me that?”</p>
<p>Harry shrugs and grins. “Probably not.”</p>
<p>Malfoy snorts and shakes his head. </p>
<p>“Are you innocent?” Harry asks him.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Malfoy huffs.</p>
<p>“Did you answer all our questions honestly?” </p>
<p>Malfoy hesitates for a split-second before he answers, “Yes.”</p>
<p>Harry hums, not entirely believing that. “Then you have nothing to worry about,” he says with a shrug. He pauses for a moment, then adds, “Unless you’d like to tell me now what you were really doing out there.”</p>
<p>Malfoy’s smile turns sharp. “I thought the interview was over.”</p>
<p>Harry eyes Malfoy a moment, giving him one last opportunity to explain, then he pushes away from the table and stands up. “Yeah, it is. We’ll be in touch.”</p>
<p>“Actually, Potter. One more thing,” Malfoy says, and Harry looks down at him. “Terrible circumstances though they may be, I’m glad I bumped into you. I was actually planning to contact you.” </p>
<p>“Yeah?” Harry asks, his interest peaked. He had wondered and maybe hoped that if Malfoy ever returned to England he would reach out. He’d always felt that their friendship in eighth year warranted at least a, ‘Hello, I’m not dead.’</p>
<p>“Yes,” Malfoy says crisply. “I would like to arrange a meeting at the Bonds and Vows Office to repay that little life debt you have on me.” </p>
<p>Harry furrows his brow. “Life debt?”</p>
<p>“Yes, naturally. You know, the Fiendfyre incident in sixth year?” Malfoy explains unnecessarily. </p>
<p>Harry sighs quietly through his nose. “Of course I know what you mean, Malfoy. Don’t worry about it. You don’t owe me anything.” </p>
<p>“No, I want to pay it back,” Malfoy says firmly. “How does Friday at six sound? Or perhaps lunchtime would work better? It won’t take long. Can you take a break at noon?”</p>
<p>“Er,” Harry says uncertainty. “Yeah, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Perfect.” Malfoy claps his hands together and stands. “I’ll meet you there at the office. You know the way? Level Seven.”</p>
<p>Aside from his disappointment, Harry isn’t sure if he should be spending time with the wizard who is at best a witness in his case, and at worst their number one suspect. Especially for something so unnecessary. Harry saved Malfoy’s life that day because it was the right thing to do, not because he was expecting any sort of compensation from him. </p>
<p>“Look, Malfoy, you don’t owe me anything for that. It wasn’t—”</p>
<p>“Oh, I know, Potter. And I’m sure you’d love to lord it over me the rest of our lives,” Malfoy drawls.</p>
<p>“I really wouldn’t,” Harry cuts in.</p>
<p>“Good. Then we’ll just take care of it on Friday,” Malfoy says. “Noon, sharp.”</p>
<p>Harry gives a short sigh and shoves his hands in his pockets. “Fine, I’ll be there.”</p>
<p>Malfoy gives a pleased smile, then turns and leaves the interview room. Harry follows after him, and as soon as they step out, he feels like everyone in the department is staring at them. He glances over and sees that Susan is among them, watching them from the doorway to the Auror division. Harry holds up his pointer finger, asking her to give him another minute. </p>
<p>Harry catches up with Malfoy at the lift. They wait in silence for a moment, and then Harry breaks it. </p>
<p>“Are you back for good, then?”</p>
<p>Malfoy looks over at him, hesitating and saying, “That’s the plan. Unless you decide to throw me in Azkaban instead.”</p>
<p>Harry smiles. “It’s still on the table.”</p>
<p>Malfoy clicks his tongue irritably and bumps his shoulder against Harry’s. Harry fights back a grin. It’s almost ridiculous how easily the familiar gesture takes him right back to eighth year, and Harry has to tamp down the urge to bump him back.</p>
<p>When they get past security, Harry returns Malfoy’s wand to him. </p>
<p>Malfoy scrutinises it for damage, then he looks at Harry and says, “Well, I’d like to say it’s been a pleasure, Potter, but it really hasn’t. I’ll see you Friday.”</p>
<p>“Sure, Malfoy,” Harry says with a small nod, and Malfoy turns on his heel and stalks away. Harry tracks him to the Apparition booths and watches until he disappears.</p>

  </p>
</center><p>When he gets back to his office, Harry shuts the door behind him, goes to his desk and drops into his chair. His and Susan’s desks are pressed together, facing each other, and she watches him from her own desk. </p>
<p>Harry stretches and yawns, feeling the weight of his exhaustion come down on him as soon as he’s off his feet. </p>
<p>“What was that about?” Susan asks him.</p>
<p>Harry peeks one eye open to see her watching him. He rubs a hand over his stubble and says, “Nothin’. Just Malfoy reminding me I’m an arsehole.”</p>
<p>Susan snorts. “He’s not wrong.”</p>
<p>Harry makes a hurt noise and throws a hand over his heart. “Betrayed by my own partner.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, ‘cause I know better than most what an arse you can be,” she says and Harry can’t fight down the grin stretching across his face. </p>
<p>Susan smiles and shakes her head, and then after a moment her expression turns serious.</p>
<p>“Is that really all he wanted?” she asks.</p>
<p>Harry shrugs. “Mostly. He’s not happy about how his witness statement turned into an interrogation.”</p>
<p>“What did he expect?” Susan huffs. </p>
<p>“That’s what I said. Guess he was expecting me to be friendlier, because of our history.”</p>
<p>Susan furrows her brow. “Is there something going on between you two?”</p>
<p>“No, of course not,” Harry scoffs. </p>
<p>“Malfoy seemed to suggest otherwise,” she says and raises an eyebrow at him. “What did he mean about you knowing he’s gay?”</p>
<p>“He came out to me as gay in eighth year, and then I had my big bi realisation. We bonded over it.”</p>
<p>“You mean like…?” Susan makes vulgar gesture.</p>
<p>“No!” Harry snaps, and he laughs at the expression Susan is making. “I was dating Ginny then, anyway.”</p>
<p>“Really? All I remember is you breaking up with her that year,” Susan says meaningfully.</p>
<p>“She broke up with me,” Harry corrects her.</p>
<p>“Because you were shagging Malfoy?”</p>
<p>“No, goddamnit Sue,” Harry says and laughs. “And you call me an arse.”</p>
<p>She wiggles her eyebrows at him suggestively. </p>
<p>“We never fucked, swear to Merlin,” Harry says and crosses his heart for good measure. </p>
<p>Susan smirks and hums. “Did you want to?” </p>
<p>Harry pauses, caught off guard by the question. “I don’t know… Not really?”</p>
<p>“You don’t know?” she asks skeptically. </p>
<p>“No, I was still messed up over Ginny, and confused with my sexuality,” Harry says and shakes his head. “I was a kid. I didn’t know what I wanted.”</p>
<p>“And now?” Susan asks, her tone and expression more serious. </p>
<p>Harry levels a flat look at her. “We’ve had no contact for eight years. There’s nothing there.” </p>
<p>Susan regards him carefully for a long moment, and then she nods and flips her dark blonde plait over her shoulder and pushes up her glasses. “Alright. How do you feel about his interview?”</p>
<p>Harry hums thoughtfully and switches gears back to the case. “He read as honest to me. Mostly, anyway.”</p>
<p>“He was consistent with the details,” Susan says with a nod. “But taking a walk? In that neighbourhood? Before dawn?” </p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s a weak excuse. Still, I don’t know that it implicates him.”</p>
<p>“You don’t think it looks suspicious?” she asks. </p>
<p>“A bit, sure, but I don’t know that it’s enough to make him a suspect,” Harry says, then narrows his eyes at Susan. “You don’t agree? </p>
<p>She shakes her head. “I think he looks very suspicious right now. A man like him just happened to stumble across a crime scene like that?”</p>
<p>“A man like him?” Harry echoes incredulously.</p>
<p>“Yeah, a man like him. You know his history, Harry. Better than most,” she argues. </p>
<p>“You’re right, I do. I know what he did during the war was under duress, and I know hasn’t been involved in that since,” Harry says defensively. </p>
<p>“Do you? I thought you said you haven’t had contact with him in eight years?” Susan points out and leans forward to plant her elbows on her desk. “You don’t know where he’s been or what he’s been up to all this time. Now he shows up in London, at a crime scene, and won’t explain why?” </p>
<p>Harry sighs irritably, but he knows she’s right. “So you think he did it, then?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but I’m sure as hell going to be looking at him with a critical eye,” Susan says.</p>
<p>Harry frowns, but gestures at her to continue. He takes off his glasses and tries to wipe them clean with his shirt as he listens.</p>
<p>“He may be telling the truth, but I think he’s omitting things,” she begins slowly, eyes drifting away from Harry as she thinks. “He didn’t seem shaken at all by that scene; the most emotion he showed when he thought he was being mistreated. Regardless of what he did after the war, we know he has cast Unforgivables before—that he’s capable of it.”</p>
<p>“That’s circumstantial,” Harry says, sliding his glasses back on. “And he could have any number of reasons for not telling us why he was in the area.”</p>
<p>“For a murder case? Of someone who’d been Cruciated to <em>death?”</em> Susan asks incredulously. “I don’t know about you, Harry, but if I was found with a body like that, I’d tell the investigators anything they wanted to know to clear my name. Especially if I had a history like him.”</p>
<p>“That’s the thing, though,” Harry says. “His history with the Death Eaters is precisely why he is nervous to work with us. It makes him look bad and he knows it. Did you notice his tell? He was more concerned about being arrested because we wouldn’t believe him than anything else.”</p>
<p>“Of course I noticed. His only concern was with getting sent to Azkaban. He’s selfish. He doesn’t give a shit about the victims or helping solve this case.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s selfish, but he still came and spoke with us, even after being harassed by Peterson and Bryant. He didn’t have to do that. He could have clammed up, called a solicitor, refused to come here,” Harry reasons.</p>
<p>“Because he trusted you,” Susan points out. “I don’t think he really cares about the victims or the outcome of the case. His demeanor was strangely unaffected, he has a history of violence, and I think he’s hiding something. Pair that with the fact that this is <em>Draco Malfoy,</em> an ex-Death Eater, a man who had Voldemort living in his house, and yeah I think he looks really suspicious.”</p>
<p>“He was a kid. That was out of his control,” Harry says in a hard tone and throws his hand out in a frustrated gesture. “None of that means he’s our guy. You’re putting him in a box because of the War.”</p>
<p>A muscle in Susan’s jaw flexes as she sets her expression stubbornly. “It’s enough to make him a suspect. When do we <em>not </em>consider a suspect’s history?” Susan argues in an equally firm tone, meeting Harry’s hard gaze with her own challenging glare. “Why are you trying so hard to defend him?”</p>
<p>“Because I’m don’t think judging him by his actions in the War is the same as judging someone by their criminal history, and I want to make sure we don’t get focused on him for the wrong reasons,” Harry asserts. “I want to make sure we’re looking at the evidence, and not at his Dark Mark.”</p>
<p>Susan narrows her eyes at him. “Except you want him to be innocent because you’re friends. If evidence comes out against him, will you be able to look at it objectively? Or do you think you should recuse yourself because of your personal relationship with him?”</p>
<p>Harry scowls. “I already told you there is no relationship. So, no, I don’t think I should leave this case. In fact, I think it’s a good idea for me to stay on specifically to make sure this case is investigated objectively. Death Eater or not, he still has rights and I’m going to see that they don’t get trampled on because of his history,” Harry says hotly. He raises his eyebrow at her pointedly and asks, “Can <em>you</em> be objective while investigating a Death Eater, or do <em>you</em> need to recuse yourself?”</p>
<p>They stare each other down. Susan’s face is turning red in anger, and she’s glowering at him so thunderously that Harry thinks it’s a wonder she hasn’t set his hair on fire with a bout of wild magic. </p>
<p>Susan lost almost her entire family to Voldemort and his Death Eaters, and he knows how seriously she takes her duty in upholding the law and serving the people justly. He knows it’s a low blow, but Harry isn’t happy about having his motives called into question when he has always dedicated himself to protecting the innocent and seeing that justice is served, whatever form that may take.</p>
<p>“My only interest is to get to the truth, so our victims can see justice,” she says tersely, her fists clenched on the desk in front of her.</p>
<p>“And that’s exactly what I want,” Harry counters.</p>
<p>“Good,” Susan snaps.</p>
<p>“Good,” Harry echoes.</p>
<p>They watch each other for a moment longer as the tension slowly dies down between them. </p>
<p>Harry breaks eye contact first to look at his watch. </p>
<p>“To St Mungo’s?” he asks. </p>
<p>“Yeah,” Susan says and nods, and they both get up to leave. </p>
