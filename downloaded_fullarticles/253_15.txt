    <p>Oliver almost collapses onto his bed, shoes and all, after Ginny and Luna's wedding. </p><p>Not that it hadn't been a beautiful wedding- albeit he might be a <em>bit </em>biased, him being the wedding planner and all, but Molly Weasley was a <em>force </em>to be reckoned with, especially when it came to her only daughter's wedding. The past months had been a flurry of screaming at caterers, flower shops and enough cake to feed a small country. But the tears welling in Ginny's eyes, and the beam on Luna's face had been completely worth it. Oliver might have sniffled a little too, when they had their first slow dance as wife and wife, but he'd never admit it.</p><p>It's hard work, it's honest work. Oliver enjoys it. He loves love. He loves helping people in love. It pays well, well enough for Oliver to have a large apartment in the middle of Brooklyn and on-demand sports on his television.</p><p>No, Oliver doesn't mind this job at all.</p>
<hr/><p>It's only a few days from then that Oliver takes it all back, burying his head in his hands. </p><p>"They're not that bad anymore!" Percy argues, his face looking sheepish. "I mean, they're so happy and in love, I <em>had </em>to refer them to the best wedding planner in New York City!"</p><p>Oliver looks up from his hands, glaring at Percy, who cowers a little. "You're just saying that to make up for this absolute <em>shitstorm </em>I'm about to get into."</p><p>Percy waves his hand. "Semantics. You're being dramatic." </p><p>Oliver's mouth drops open, and Percy winces. </p><p>"You referred <em>Daphne Greengrass and Graham Montague to me!" </em>Oliver all but shrieks, earning them a few strange looks from around the coffee shop. </p><p>Percy worked at a big, fancy law firm in Manhattan, where he dallied with the richest and most influential of New York. That's where he interacted with Daphne, and her NFL husband Graham, on a near daily basis.</p><p>Percy mumbled something incoherent under his breath, and Oliver shoots daggers at him, daring him to raise his voice. Frankly, Percy's never had fantastic social skills with anyone that wasn't an authority figure, so he repeats himself.</p><p>"I <em>know </em>Graham was a complete asshole to you in unive-"</p><p>"He called me slurs on a daily- no, <em>hourly </em>basis." Oliver reminded him sourly. "And Greengrass wasn't much better. So was anyone that associated with that stupid football team."</p><p>"Okay, yes, I get it, big basketball versus football rivalry." Percy backs off, holding his hands up innocently. "If you don't want to take it, then you don't have to. I'm just going to say that yes, they were dickheads in college, but I <em>swear </em>they've grown up. Really, Daphne's quite nice. I'll remind you that Greengrass' father is on the city council, and Graham's dad literally owns the firm. It's <em>literally</em> called Montague Inc. It'll be the wedding of the century, elite flying in from all over the world to celebrate and see a wedding that <em>you </em>planned. Not only would you make a <em>fuck ton </em>of money off of this wedding, you'd also get a <em>fuck ton </em>more business opportunities. And if Graham or Daphne are assholes to you again, I'll yell at them myself, big shot parents be damned." </p><p>Oliver is quiet for a second. Then another. Percy is anxious, waiting for Oliver to comment. </p><p>Oliver sighs. "They need to make an official booking with me to begin a consultation." </p><p>Percy claps his hand eagerly, like a child on Christmas Day, and Oliver rolls his eyes as a smile finds its way onto his face, the anticipation of a big project frazzling his nerves.</p>
<hr/><p>Graham Montague and Daphne Greengrass have grown up. </p><p>The first thing they do before they sit down is shake his hand. </p><p>"I just want to say, Mr Wood, that I apologise for treating you the way I did in university." Daphne says quietly, gripping his hand. "I hope we can put our past differences aside- you're one of the best planners in the state, and this is a big day, but I do understand if you have some doubts about working with us." Graham nods, his eyes apologetic and soft.</p><p>"It's all in the past." Oliver dismisses. "Please, call me Oliver. You two make a beautiful couple- please, sit. Tea, coffee?"</p><p>Daphne Greengrass is the same beautiful blonde heiress that she was in college, but she now emanated class, her Chanel No. 5 perfume wafting in the air, her posture absolutely perfect, face schooled into an absolutely unreadable expression. Graham's always been big, being the football player he is, and he fills out his sharp, tailored shirt and slacks quite nicely. </p><p>Oliver wasn't lying- they <em>did </em>make a beautiful couple. </p><p>"So, you've been together since university, correct?" Oliver jots down on a notepad. "How long have you been engaged?" </p><p>Daphne lays a hand softly on Graham's. "Six months." </p><p>They chat amicably for a few more minutes, Oliver getting to know his clients better, before they begin wedding related business.</p><p>"Give me some quick ideas, visions, rough estimate of number of guests, a date, really anything related to this wedding."</p><p>And so their two hours went, Daphne and Graham feeling more comfortable as the clock ticks on. Oliver has a few pages of notes, a brainstorm that would look like a mess to anyone that wasn't him, but his initial apprehension is fading away into a tingly feeling of excitement. </p><p>"If you could set a time with me to introduce your maid of honour and best man, and perhaps your families if you wish, we can get started any time within the next week." Oliver says warmly, shutting his notebook with a snap. Graham and Daphne are smiling, looking at each other happily, and Oliver really understands that they <em>did </em>mature.</p><p>Maybe Percy wasn't such a shit friend after all. </p>
<hr/><p>The wedding in March. This leaves Oliver just under three months to plan this wedding.</p><p>It's not impossible. It'll be hard, a wedding of this magnitude, but it's not impossible. Oliver's managed worse. Besides, he had his trusted Angelina, Katie and George working with him as well. </p><p>Challenging. Not impossible. Oliver kept this in mind as he started organising contacts. </p><p>The day comes that Oliver is meeting Graham's best man and Daphne's maid of honour. They meet in Oliver's office again, discussing guest lists and scheduling meetings for tailoring, dress shopping, cake tasting, catering, music- Oliver realises, there's a <em>lot </em>to get done, <em>fuck- </em></p><p>Challenging. Not impossible. </p><p>Graham and Daphne walk into his office hand in hand, looking excited, if not a bit nervous. Behind them is a petite woman with dark hair and a face <em>very </em>similar to Daphne's, and a tall, dark, cleanly dressed-</p><p>
  <em>Oh. </em>
</p><p>Oliver knew this man. </p><p>He should've predicted that Marcus Flint would be Graham Montague's best man. </p><p>Marcus Flint looked as much as the surly, grouchy man that Oliver had known in university, this time with an expensive watch and a sharply tailored suit, looking all the big and intimidating lawyer was supposed to be. His face was sharper, his teeth still crooked, but he'd cleaned up. He cleaned up <em>well. </em></p><p>Oliver doesn't flinch. Nor does Marcus. </p><p>"This is Astoria, my sister and maid of honour." Daphne introduces, and Astoria gives a shy smile, waving her fingers politely. "And you know Marcus." </p><p>"I do." Oliver says simply. "Pleasure to meet you, Astoria. Please, have a seat." </p><p>Once they were all settled, Oliver began the process of getting to know the maid of honour and best man. It was important that he was able to work well with them- they'd be dealing with a lot of the wedding planning, as well. </p><p>"I'm a doctor." Astoria says, and Oliver likes her- she's soft-spoken, but obviously a strong, independent woman. </p><p>"I'm a divorce attorney." Marcus announces bluntly, and Oliver double-takes. Graham chuckles slightly at the reaction</p><p>"Is it bad luck?" He asks, with humour, and Oliver, smiles too, glancing at Marcus, giving him a once-over.</p><p>"No, no- just, er, quite uncommon, I suppose." Oliver reassures him. "I hope we don't get the same clients, then, Marcus." </p><p>Maybe it's a trick of the eyes, but Marcus' mouth twitches upwards. </p>
<hr/><p>Oliver blanches at the guest list. </p><p>"300 people!" Oliver waves the papers around while Angelina winces. "300 people!" </p><p>"Okay, deep breaths, Wood." Angelina says soothingly. "Venue first."</p><p>"Already been decided." He shoots back. "Montague's are good friends with the Warringtons. They're getting the ballroom at a <em>dirt </em>cheap price."</p><p>Angelina's eyes widened. "Like, <em>Warrington-Hotel</em>-Warringtons?" </p><p>Oliver nods and she squeals in excitement. </p><p>"Oh, Oliver, that place is <em>beautiful!" </em>She claps her hands. "It's <em>so-" </em></p><p>"Schmoozy?" Oliver interrupted. "Gaudy? Over-the-top?" </p><p>"Well, I was going to say fancy and dreamy, but it definitely can be those things too." She said. "Who's helping with the guest lists, then?" </p><p>"Well, <em>you're </em>going to be dress hunting with Daphne, Astoria and George, and Marcus is going to be here with Katie and I." </p><p>Angelina pouted. "Guest lists are way more fun." </p><p>"That's because you like hearing all the gossip about the guests. Shoo! George is already at the boutique- you're meeting them there in a half hour- Angie, what use is the group calendar if you don't even <em>read it-" </em></p><p>"Hush, Ol." She flicked him. "I'm going. Don't miss me too much." </p><p>"Send Katie in before you leave, woman!" </p>
<hr/><p>Marcus arrives looking a little more frazzled than Oliver was used to seeing him- which honestly didn't mean much, because the appointment last week was the first time Oliver had seen him in years. But his tie was loose, his jacket in one hand and a sleek leather briefcase in another. His top button was unbuttoned. </p><p>Oliver doesn't know how to feel about this arrangement, really. </p><p>"Sorry I'm late." Marcus mumbles hastily, setting down his briefcase and jacket haphazardly. "Work." </p><p>"You're only ten minutes behind, bud." Katie says, amused. "How're ya doing, Flint?" </p><p>Marcus' eyes widen as he recognises Katie. "Bell?"</p><p>She grins. "The one and only." </p><p>"Ah." He says faintly. "You look well. Is there anyone else that I was an idiot to in university that you work with, Wood?" </p><p>"Angelina and George are dress hunting with Daphne right now." Oliver says cheerfully. The way Marcus' face scrunches is comical. </p><p>"Fuck." He curses, than flinches. "Sorry!" </p><p>Katie looks at him in awe. "Who are you and what have you done with the <em>neanderthal </em>I knew at school?"</p><p>Marcus winces. "I deserved that." </p><p>Oliver snorts. "You deserve much more than that, Flint, which is why you're doing guest lists with us. By the time these hours are over, you're going to want to throw yourself off the Empire State." </p><p>Marcus lifts his chin, the challenging rival that Oliver knew in university. "Can't be any worse than the case I just had to close- bring it on, Wood." </p>
<hr/><p>"Pansy <em>can't </em>sit at the same table as Chang. Chang wrote that <em>scathing </em>article about the Parkinsons in the Times, remember?"</p><p>Marcus looks like he's ready to rip his hair out at this point- it's fun to watch, really. He'd had to fill them in on every piece of drama that plagued the many Upper East Siders that would be attending the wedding- not that Oliver and Katie didn't know their fair share of it. </p><p>"Okay, where do we put Hannah Abbott?" Katie says, pulling a pen out of the knot of hair on her head. Marcus groans</p><p>"Nowhere near Longbottom. I had to do their divorce case two months ago." He grumbles. Katie gasps. </p><p>"I knew were a lawyer, but you're a <em>divorce attorney?" </em>Katie all but shrieks. "You're in enemy territory!" </p><p>"Wait a minute." Oliver grouses. "We planned their wedding! They barely lasted half a year!" </p><p>Marcus waves a hand. "Not my issue, Wood. Abbott was being shady, Longbottom wanted her to sign a prenup after a few months of her ransacking his credit cards, she refused, had a meltdown. She sued him, he sued her, Augusta Longbottom filed a restraining order- <em>ugh</em>, I don't even want to get into it." </p><p>"That wedding was gorgeous." Katie mutters. "I busted serious ass booking that venue." </p><p>Marcus shrugs. "Sorry." He says, not sounding very sorry at all. Oliver glares at him, and Marcus rolls his eyes in return.</p><p>There. That was the asshole Oliver knew from university. He knows that this reformed, cleaned up Marcus Flint is an <em>act. </em></p><p>"I'm going to run to Starbucks, my treat. Americano, no milk, no sugar for Oliver- Flint, do you want anything?" </p><p>Marcus looks at Oliver strangely. "Uh- I get the same thing. Thanks, Bell." </p><p>The silence between them is awkward, stilted, and Oliver is tapping his pen against the table nervously. He's about to crack a <em>god-awful </em>joke, just so there's <em>something </em>to break the quiet, but Marcus beats him to it.</p><p>"Look, Wood." He blurts, cringing at himself, then straightening up again. "I'm sorry. I was an asshole to you in school."</p><p>Oliver smiles awkwardly. "Well, I wasn't exactly an angel to you either." </p><p>"I always provoked it." Marcus admits guiltily. "You would've never acted up if I hadn't started it. I was shit to you from the beginning." </p><p>Oliver pauses for a second, then nods. "Yeah. But it's in the past. Don't worry about it." </p><p>The silence comes back. It feels even thicker this time. </p><p>"How come you didn't go pro?" Oliver breaks the silence this time. Marcus' face darkens, and Oliver realises he's touched a nerve. </p><p>"Folks didn't think football fit in with the Flint culture." He says casually, but his pained eyes betray that it's not casual, not at all. "It was just a hobby."</p><p>"Nobody's the draft first-pick as a <em>hobby." </em>Oliver snorts.</p><p>"Well, why didn't <em>you </em>go pro?" Marcus challenged. "You were the best player in the NCAA." </p><p>Oliver's heartstrings twinge slightly. </p><p>"Tore my ACL." He says ruefully. "I can't even run for more than a half hour without collapsing." </p><p>Marcus looks slightly saddened at that. "I'm sorry." </p><p>Oliver grins. "Don't be. I got over it years ago. And now I have this business. I get to work with my friends and watch people fall in love. It's great." </p><p>Marcus doesn't lose the sad eyes when he quietly says, "must be nice."</p><p>Oliver pretends he doesn't hear him.</p>
