          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco allows Al to visit over the summer which helps but Scorpius still dreads their return to school. His mother's death has been all over the papers. Al's aunt Luna had reported it with respect in a small side column but the Prophet had created a gossip filled hell. He wishes he could stay home. The common room is like a sanctuary but he notices Al watching him more and before he knows it he is surrounded by Weasleys forcing him to be social with them and they are not Slytherins. In part he wants to strangle Al but mostly he is grateful. Ginny Potter sends them baked goods like his mother used to and it makes sleep return to him, if slowly.</p></div>
