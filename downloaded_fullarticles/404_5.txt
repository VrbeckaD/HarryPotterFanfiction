    <p>Chapter 1</p><p>Now Harry Potter would never consider himself to be brave. Anyone that talked about him would beg to differ, they would say that he was the bravest and most courageous person that they had ever met. Depending on who you asked it might have been considered an honorable thing or maybe a foolish trait. Harry Potter would have considered it to be a bit of both. He was too stubborn to ever give up or in and he was really not as brave as people thought. Half the time he was scared and had no idea what he was doing he was simply reacting. He had to think on his feet he had to act or he would simply not be there anymore. </p><p>So when he figured it all out, the truth about Snape and how he had a little fragment of old Voldaworts soul in him it certainly scared him as much as it grossed him out. He knew what it meant. He knew what he had to do. And he had stepped into the forest with two of the relics that supposedly were from death himself. He was comforted by his family and friends that no longer were and prepared himself for the inevitable end.</p><p>It didn’t hurt. The killing curse, that was. It was instant and Harry could only be slightly happy about that. He expected to see his parents and friends waiting for him. Perhaps that was more of the religious sort of nonsense that he had learned from his time with Muggles, but he has not expected to find himself in a very white version of kings crossing. Well perhaps that was incorrect the background had a slightly green tint to it, near the edges where there was less distinction of exactly where he was. </p><p>The only definite color to the room seemed to be his clothes, but even they were a bit dulled, grayed out by the space around him. The place was far too bright it was so bright that it was disorienting. He had never noticed such different colors in white until he entered this place. </p><p>There were no trains to this Kings Crossing. The tracks were there or rather the pits that would have led to them were empty and the only furniture to the place was a bench that had a horrid creature seemingly under it. He peered at it and he could make out those features that he had come accustomed to in his nightmares. It looked like Voldemort….</p><p>The flesh to the thing was shriveled in and it looked like it was bleeding horribly as the flesh seemed to be peeling away from it in certain places. It cradled itself and had its eyes were closed in what must have been agony as it breathed heavily in and out. </p><p>“You can’t help.” Said a familiar voice. “Harry.”</p><p>Dumbledore was there in white robes that barely were different than the background around him. He looked much like he had in life. Harry looked around himself to see if he could see anyone else there but them and the withering away piece of what could have been Voldemort's soul. </p><p>“You wonderful boy you brave, brave man. Let us walk.” </p><p>That friendly voice was a welcome one despite his somewhat disappointment in the other for keeping so many secrets from him and for lying to him about what he was. Even with all of the truth out, even with how things had ultimately ended Harry Potter could not blame the other for what he had done. So he followed the wiser old man and they started to walk.</p><p>The environment seemed to warp around them. </p><p>“Professor where are we?” Harry could not help but ask. </p><p>“I was going to ask you that.” Dumbledore motioned for Harry to follow and they started walking. “Where would you say we are?” </p><p>Harry looked around himself and nodded slightly stating his first assessment of the place. “It looks like Kings cross only without the trains and much cleaner.”</p><p>The platform around them seemed to be endless and the bench with what was left of Voldemort's soul was far behind them. </p><p>“Kings Cross it that right?” Dumbledore looked around himself, his gray beard seeming to shine in the brilliance of the lighting. “This is how they say your parting.” </p><p>The old man turned to him as he explained. So he really was dead then, he had figured as much. Perhaps this place or the world had just been imagined by his dying mind.</p><p> </p><p>“I expect that you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than by fate, that being in Godric's Hollow all those years ago.</p><p>He nodded, “It's true isn’t it, that part of him lived in me?”</p><p>“Yes it did,” Dumbledore said did thus in past tense as confirming that the decaying husk of a soul was soon going to be gone as it had truly been destroyed when Harry himself was killed. </p><p>“That part of him was destroyed by none other than Voldemort himself,” Domboledore confirmed for Harry as if he could hear his thoughts, who was he kidding he was probably dying and his mind was conjuring all of this. </p><p>The space was losing that color and the floor that made up the platform was becoming less defined. </p><p>“You were the Horcrux that he never meant to make Harry.” They were so close to the light now that nothing was really visible beside the man walking beside him. Harry tried to focus on Dumbledore's face as he talked. They came to a stop at another bench that came out of what seemed nothing but mist and Domboldore sat down onto it and shifted his robes as he sat. Even now he still had a grace about him in his movements, just as he had when he was alive. </p><p>“I have to go back don’t I?” Harry asked looking around himself. Because he figured that if it was possible that he would have to go back. He knew that his friends could probably do it. Kill Voldemort as it was, but they could always use help, and if he could help he figured that he owed them enough to make that happen. </p><p>“That is entirely up to you Harry,” Dumbledore said as softly as a summer breeze. </p><p>“I have a choice?” Harry said more to himself than the professor as he held onto his knees and faced the swirling mist. He kept sight of the others robe in the off chance that if he looked entirely away from him he would lose his guide.</p><p>“Yes.” was the one-word reply that made Harry look back into the wrinkled but kind face. “Were in king’s cross you say?” </p><p>The dark eyes shifted towards where the tracks were. “I think if you so desired that you would be able to board a train.” </p><p>The way he said it made it sound like a suggestion and not a casual statement, even if his voice did not change all that much from its rather soft and gentle tone.  </p><p>“Where would it take me?” Harry asked unsure that he wanted to board one. Slightly nervous about what would happen from there, but equally as curious and in need of knowing.</p><p>

“On.” Dumbledore seemed oddly amused by his reluctance. His eyebrows quirking ever so slightly and his lips twitching with a smile. With that, the old man stood and left him sitting on the bench. He was standing in the near blinding light and all that could be seen of him was his silhouette.  </p><p>Harry stood up and followed him from the bench. Yet he seemed unable to get closer to the other. </p><p>“He still has the elder wand.” Harry felt the statement slip from his lips. </p><p>Dumbledore then turned. “True.” His voice was softer than before.</p><p>“The snake is still alive,” Harry confessed. </p><p>“Yes.” The old man said just as soft as before. </p><p>“I have nothing to kill it with…” He trailed off hoping for advice, this one last time so that if he made it back he would know what to do. </p><p>“Help will always be given at Hogwarts.” Dumbledore started his iconic line that he often told Harry. “To those that ask for it, I always prided myself on my ability to turn a phrase words are in my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of inflicting injury and remedying it. I would, in this case, amend my statement to this, help will always be given at Hogwarts to those that deserve it.”</p><p>He moved closer to Harry as he said it as if to make his point and then drew back again. “Don’t pity the dead Harry. Pity the living, and above all, all those that live without love.”</p><p>He seemed to be trying to leave. </p><p>“Professor my mother's Patronus was a doe same as professor Snapes that's curious isn’t it.” He called out trying to stall the other to better understand everything. </p><p>The professor shook his head. “No, if I think about it, it does not seem that curious at all.”</p><p>So it was true then that Snape had loved his mother...</p><p>He seemed to try to smile again at Harry, he was fading it seemed and the mist was coming to swallow him up. “I will be going now, Harry.”</p><p>“Professor,” Harry called out desperately. “Is this all just in my head?”</p><p>“Of course it is in your head,” the older man shook his head. “That doesn’t make it any less real does it?” He after that turned into the light and he started to be swallowed up by it so that all that was left was his fading form. “Don’t miss your train, Harry.” </p><p>There was the sound of a whistle and it was ear-splitting as a train screeched to a halt on the tracks there were many car doors and they all swung open to him. He didn’t know which car to get into but he assumed that it did not matter as it was all part of the train. He boarded the closest open car to him and the doors shut behind him. </p><p>The room instantly went black and there was the sound of something being banged on fiercely. He opened his eyes, they felt hard to open. They felt as if they were crusted over. He forced them open and blinked several times the area around him was dark and he squinted his eyes he could not see anything. He noted that his glasses were not on, and he was not in the forest but rather his room and his scar was burning. </p><p>It was his old room. The cracked wall to Dudley’s second bedroom. Hedwig hooted from the side of the room. He could not see her as much as he heard her. He could just make out the old furnishings. </p><p>“Shut up Boy!” The unmistakable voice of Uncle Vernon filled the air, the door rattled under his fist before giving a very large huff and stalking back towards his room with loud thunderous thuds. </p><p>Harry reached for his glasses that he had always kept on the old faded nightstand and placed them on his face. </p><p>There was something so off about this, it felt as if he had been asleep of ages and yet he had so many things buzzing in his head in such detail that it could not have been a dream. He could see the books that were from last year stacked up on his trunk that was in the far corner. They were his third-year books. </p><p>Letters from his friends lay by the window sill with dates and the week's post. He blinked at the paper. He had read this one and he was fairly certain that one could not read when they were in a dream. There was a letter from Ron over the one from Hermione. Ron’s was about the big quidditch games going on and Hermonie’s just the basic letter about how she was. His Flying with the Cannons book almost tripped him as he made his way towards the closet door that had a mirror inside of it. He yanked it open to see himself, a boy again. A boy that would be in his fourth year of wizard’s schooling at Hogwarts. </p><p>He looked at himself in shock because looking back at it perhaps round glasses was not the best look for him. He took in a couple of deep breaths. He had to stay calm if he was going to work his way out of this one. </p><p> </p><p>He rubbed at his scar it was still burning.</p><p>It was burning as if someone had taken a red hot poker and placed it against his head. He started to Occulate, following the vague lessons that Snape had given him and his own practice in the months that he had been wandering the wilderness. </p><p>The burning lessened and he took in several breaths. </p><p>He sat back onto his bed rubbing at the scar and then at his face. He could not dismiss it as a dream if he could do magic that he had learned in a different time and place. It was sometime in the summer before his 4th year meaning that he would be headed to the World Cup as it were with the Weasleys he could not remember the exact date but he did know what would happen at the cup.  </p><p>He rubbed at his face again. Messing with time was one of the biggest warnings the Wizarding World ever gave him. It was messed up enough that he and Hermione had traveled back through it to help Serius. </p><p>Sirius… He was still alive. He had the letters to prove it. They were from Padfoot and they came every so often from random places of the world. </p><p>He could mess with the time frame a little he supposed as he now knew what lie in wait for him. He knew what he was and the task that he would eventually be put onto. He knew for a fact that he did not have to go to the ministry of magic, because his godfather was not in danger unless Harry would directly put him in harm's way of going. </p><p>He supposed that if he did not go through that the ministry would never believe him that Voldemort had returned. But then that was a year away and the thing he should be focusing on was the fact that this year was the year that Old Voldie would be trying to at least become living flesh again. </p><p>He knew one thing for certain he would try to avoid that part altogether, the mad man would find some other way to come back, he always did like the wart or cancer that he was, but it would at least help with the slander to both his and Dumbledore's name. Things would go smoother fifth year if Umbrage never came into the equation. </p><p>He rummaged through his drawers for a calender he was going to really have to contain himself if it wasn’t close to that quidditch match. He pulled it out and found that there was, to his relief, only two more weeks until school would start. His eyes flickered to his books that were school-related. He knew most of the things in there. He could refresh just a bit to make sure that he didn’t just become all-knowing. </p><p>He rather was all-knowing now though…</p><p>He could possibly have some real fun with this. </p><p>He shook his head that would probably be really irresponsible of him. Fred and George would definitely take the opportunity.</p><p>Thinking about them hurt because that brought back memories of the battle and all those that had died. This time though they wouldn’t have to. Harry could get the diadem early, he never would have to go there and put the rest of the castle at risk…  </p><p>He could do better this time. Save those that he had failed to save, perhaps turn those away that had not yet fallen down the path to evil. There were people that were worth trying to save. Even that git Malfoy didn’t deserve to have the dark lord living in his home. </p><p>He really could master all the things that he would need to know outside of classes as his assignments would all be pretty easy. Then again, he didn’t really have to much fun the first time around. He had tried to get along with most of the Gryffindors and keep himself alive. At least this time he wouldn’t have to worry as much about the tasks as before and he already knew most of the traps that awaited him. </p><p>He could definitely have more fun or he could do the responsible thing and become the brightest wizard of his age.  He had learned enough to get by last time but he could really read up on some things and become a lot better at dueling and potion-making. </p><p>Oh, man wouldn’t that be funny to see Snape’s face when he suddenly was really good at making potions. He would probably accuse him of cheating but then he could do it right in front of his face. He could see those thick eyebrows scrunching already and that large nose scrunching with annoyance. It didn't matter if Snape was on their side. He still was a real bastard to Harry and tormented others.</p><p>Okay so maybe some shenanigans would be good. A healthy mix of both betterment of himself as a wizard and messing with the timeline just enough to have a great time and save those that he could but not cause too much lasting damage. </p><p>That was possible right?</p><p>Okay so all he had to do was survive and keep things the way that they were save maybe the accusations of him putting the dark mark in the sky at the quidditch cup. He could do that. </p><p>He picked up a quill after he looked over Padfoot's short letter just to check-in and to let him know that he was doing alright and that the Dursleys were not being too horrible to him. It was this summer where the connection to Voldamort would start, well start to act up as they would form a link. He was pretty sure that was what was causing his scar to burn now that he thought about it.<br/>
Yes this was the summer that it had all started… the dreams of what Voldamort was doing in the shadows. He had written Sirius a letter about his scar burning. </p><p>No need to mention that this time…</p><p>Right…? </p><p>He debated if he should send it with that attached before deciding to screw it and send it anyway, just as he had last time. It would help to have Sirius to talk to at least, and talking about his problems last time with someone that was an adult that wouldn’t laugh at him about such things or dismiss them without telling him the truth was something that he really missed after his godfather had died.</p><p>He nodded and easily got the window open and Hedwig out of her cage. He gave her a few good pets because he had missed her and if felt like they were reuniting. He was grinning like an idiot holding her up. He would have to be a bit more careful when he was reunited with other people that he had seen die or he really would cause suspicion. </p><p>Hedwig made her way to the sill as Harry creaked it quietly open. “Find Sirius.” He whispered, before adding “good girl.” as he tired the letter loosely to her leg.</p><p>He eventually went down for breakfast forgetting that this was the summer that the diet for Dudley had started. He nearly snorted as he took the grapefruit. He would have to eat some of the food stored under his floorboards. </p><p>He gave a wonderful smile as he watched Dudley try to eat such a thing. Uncle Vernon looked at him with one of his more menacing looks but it did not bother Harry in the slightest. What were they going to do lock him in his room again all summer?</p><p>Yah that one had worked out really well for them. He ate his slices merrily knowing that he was going to have some birthday cake after this. </p><p>Uncle Vernon ate one of his slice muttering to himself about diets and schools not making proper sized uniforms. </p><p>The doorbell gave a loud chime and Uncle Vernon took his muttering with him to the door. There was words exchanged none of which that Harry could overhear before Uncle Vernon returned with that beat red color flowering his cheeks, his ridiculous mustache crinkled with his large scowl. </p><p>“You living room.” He pointed at Harry barely grunting like a pig out the sentence.</p><p>He followed him to the living room smiling as Dudley was lightly scolded for trying to take Uncle Vernon’s grapefruit slices.  </p><p>“So.” Uncle Vernon started. “So.” he repeated as he mumbled to himself. </p><p>“So what?” Harry was getting tired of this already, he had done nothing wrong he supposed other than somehow time traveling back to his past self and waking up a bit disorientated in his bed. He must have picked the wrong train car now that he thought about it. Maybe if he picked one that was closer to the engine he would have woken up at a later date. </p><p>The man scowled at him and gave a very frustrated grunt. “This just arrived.” He held up purple letter. </p><p>Ah, it was that letter.</p><p>Without much further hesitation he read the letter that the Weasleys had sent him. He smiled knowing that his ticket literally out of here was coming around a bit sooner than he remembered it. </p><p>“Look at this.” He held up the envelope and Harry laughed, because one the expression on his uncle’s face was priceless and also because the envelope was covered every inch of it in stamps and he could just imagine Arther putting as many as he could on the thing from some collection that he had in his garage. </p><p>“I would say that she put enough stamps on.” He regained his composure. </p><p>“The postman noticed.” The man glared at Harry.</p><p>“Well of course he did, there is quite a lot of beautiful stamps on it.” Harry acted as if that was the only mistake that was made. </p><p>“He seemed to think that it was funny.” Vernon continued hotly.</p><p>“I am sure that he did.” Harry nodded vigorously. “Because I would find it a bit funny as well. No harm it was a prank you could say.” </p><p>The older man seemed to turn redder by the suggestion. Harry was sure it was because he had not thought of that. He decided to just get the show on the road so he asked pointedly “can I go then, I mean it would be in your best interest and all. I would be gone the last few weeks of summer and you won't get woken by my nightmare about dark wizards murdering me and people I care about in my sleep. Or you could keep me here for the rest of the summer that’s fine too. My Godfather is planning to take me to school this year.”</p><p>Now that was a lie but it was worth watching his uncles face turn a wonderful shade of purple as he was fighting with Harry’s very obvious disrespect and the idea of getting Harry and his odd friends and relatives as far away from his normal family as possible. </p><p>“Who is this woman anyway?” Vernon looked at the card trying to gather some sort of thought since the man had never really had an original one it must have been very difficult. </p><p>“You know her or rather have seen her before.” Harry answered innocently enough, “She is my friend Ron’s mother and the one that usually picks him up from the Hogwarts train.” </p><p>“Quidditch he muttered what the hell is that rubbish.</p><p> </p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. “It's a sport that is played on broomsticks, I don’t think you bothered to look at some of my school's letters home to you, but I play it.” </p><p>Vernon cut him off with another animalistic noise. “Fine alright its a freak sport.” </p><p>“Well, its about on par with football or baseball in popularity,” Harry added brightly. </p><p>His uncle managed to take in a couple of wheezed breaths. “What does send us an answer in the normal way mean?” </p><p>“I think she means by an owl which would be very normal for people like her and me.” </p><p>Petunia who had made her way into the living room looked faint by the word normal being used in the same sentence as owls. </p><p>He looked so pissed that. “You will not say that sorta thing in this house, why after all that we have done for you.”</p><p>Harry stood at that. “You have done a wonderful job of making me miserable from the moment that you took me in. Why I am sure that you let me cry in the cupboard when I was little. Trust me You have done plenty but none of it has been really good has it?” </p><p>Petunia looked like a gaping fish and Vernon looked as if Harry had just threatened to blow up the house.</p><p>“How dare you.” the man hissed.</p><p>“How dare you.” Harry repeated back mockingly. “You know in a way you should be grateful that I exist because I am pretty sure that is the only thing keeping the protective spell that were placed on this house up.” </p><p>He made his way to the stairs as his uncle made a move to follow him. “Protective spells?” he blundered.</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry said making it to his door. “They were put up to protect you from the man that murdered my parents because he is still out there wanting to murder anyone that has any blood in them that is related to them. Which includes your wife, and Dudley.” </p><p>He shut the door as he heard the sound of something similar to a bowling ball pop down on the stairs causing them to creek. Yah he was not coming back here next summer of that he was certain.</p><p>After a very long time, he heard Uncle Vernon’s voice it was slightly cracked. “Go to this cup thing, just get out of the house.” </p><p>Harry smiled a little to himself perhaps his tactic was a bit meaner than the one that he had used all those years ago, but it was no less effective and addressed some of the things he had been bottling up forever. </p><p>He let the Weasley’s owl have the lettered reply that he would be delighted to go. Pig giving him one last look before zooming out like the little spazz it was. </p><p>Well, this was going to be a fun Sunday of that he was sure. </p><p>That night he dreamed of the war, and all the horror to come. He woke and while his scar was not burning the lingering dream was still painful. That was what would happen if he failed this time around. He sucked in a few breaths and went about getting his things ready to go as soon as his friends came for him he could leave and not hopefully ever come back.</p>
