</p><p>A figure, lone and dignified,<br/>He stood and wondered why,<br/>Why did father do this,<br/>Why did so many have to die?</p><p>Why did all those students<br/>Have to fight and die and fall?<br/>And why had he considered<br/>Even fighting there at all?</p><p>Now he stood at the iron gates, <br/>His hands upon the bars, <br/>Hesitant and wistful, <br/>Weighed down by mental scars.</p><p>The quiet seemed too much for him, <br/>How much can one man bear? <br/>His father gone, his mother weak, <br/>And now it hurt to care.</p><p>But then across the way he saw, <br/>A head of deep brown hair, <br/>And as the figure closer came, <br/>He saw her standing there.</p><p>She walked right up to him and then, <br/>Saying not a word, <br/>Through the bars she placed her hand, <br/>As if his heart she heard.</p><p>She took his hand and held it fast, <br/>He grasped it in his own, <br/>Did she know she had his heart, <br/>This queen upon her throne?</p><p>But as she turned towards him, <br/>Her face began to change, <br/>And soon the whole scenario<br/>Began to twist and fade.</p><p>He sat up straight in bed and felt<br/>the sweat drip down his skin, <br/>Then fear entrenched his heart;<br/>How could he possibly win?</p><p>Footsteps in the lonely house, <br/>Echoed in the halls, <br/>Sending shivers down his spine<br/>And trembling within the walls.</p><p>Sleep just would not come to him, <br/>His brain was fully wired, <br/>He tossed and turned, his mind awake,<br/>But his body torn and tired.</p><p>Why couldn't he forget her?<br/>Why couldn't he just sleep?<br/>Why did he have to see her face?<br/>Why was he in so deep?</p><p>She was a lowly muggle born,<br/>And he a pure blood,<br/>And yet he felt his heart skip beats<br/>And dizziness came in floods.</p><p>The next day, he strode out with purpose,<br/>The Manor left behind,<br/>He would find his beauty,<br/>To ease his tainted mind.</p><p>He found her, sprawled out on the grass,<br/>Engrossed in a rather large book, <br/>He stood there still and looked at her, <br/>From his quiet little nook.</p><p>A twig behind her crackled, <br/>And the brown haired girl looked round, <br/>His heart leaped inside him<br/>As she found the source of sound.</p><p>Their eyes met and locked together then, <br/>The silence deafened him, <br/>All he could hear was his thumping heart, <br/>All she could hear was him.</p><p>She sat back down and offered him<br/>a patch of woodland grass,<br/>He took his seat as if he sat<br/>on sharpened, shattered glass.</p><p>But minutes turned to hours as they sat and talked together,<br/>And when she finally stood to leave, <br/>He wished they had forever.</p></div>
