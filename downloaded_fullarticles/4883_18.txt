    <p>Chapter One</p>
<p>It was all so simple really; tracking down a man who just so happens to be a well-known figure to the public, and have a simple chat with the man. It would have been easy if the man was just a rich CEO, his company making millions with their gadgets and things alike but no, this man had to be more than that. He had to be a superhero, and not just any superhero; he was Ironman. Tony Stark was indeed the man she was trying to track down, and given her gifts and role in the magical community, you would think it would be easy for a powerful witch to track down a rich man, but no. She even had an insider, well, more like a friend that worked with the rich man, but she didn't want to bother him as this was her problem, not anybody else's.</p>
<p>She did expect to get into the building with no fuss. She had a stolen, well borrowed, key pass that allowed her to enter through the double glass doors of the building. However, what she didn't expect was to be apprehended by security the moment she walked through the Stark- sorry Avengers Tower, their thorough and completely advanced surveillance system picking up on her magic, which she cursed under breath when she realised she forgot to cast the masking spell that would hide her magic. She then cursed again when the lights and computers began to go astray at the presence of magic, the technology reacting to her magic. She really should have used her invisibility cloak, but she wanted to keep her magic secret, not scare the man.</p>
<p>She allowed the small security team to take her away; the team leading her to a disclosed room that was on the fourth floor of the building, and the guard holding her patted her down, fiddling with her charm bracelet, taking the key pass off her and pulling the humming stick that was buried in the inside of her boots. The guard frowned at the stick before looking around as the lights flickered before looking to her, and the woman shrugged, muttering about how a girl must protect herself even if it is stick. She didn't mind them taking her wand away, for she knew how to use wandless magic, and she was glad it wasn't the Elder Wand or otherwise there really would be a problem. But the wand was tucked away safely in its costumed made box inside her trunk that had been shrunken to a charm on her charm bracelet.</p>
<p>The guard shook his head, pocketing the wand and continued his pat-down, but wary of the woman. When he was satisfied he couldn't find anything else, he led the woman to an interrogation room, where he led her to a chair, gesturing to her to sit, and she did, sighing as she did. The guard had then informed her about the situation, telling her that the security cameras and sensors had picked up on unusual activities that involved her, and that it was a crime to use a key pass that wasn't hers. She frowned, just wondering how in the world did they pick up her magic when really it was supposed to shut it down as magic didn't react well to electricity</p>
<p>But then again, it had been a while since she was in the world of technology and she had been informed that there were some who worked with the muggles in the hopes of mixing magic and technology. She didn't know much, as she had been deep undercover in Russia, tracking down an underground terrorist wizard group that had been threatening take over the world like their idol, Mr Who-Gives-A-Rats-Arse-What-His-Name-is or more accurately Voldemort had years ago. Hermione Granger, Head Auror and her boss, had been against using her best friend to go undercover and bring them down, but if past events were anything to go by, the Girl-Who-Lived knew what she was doing and knew how to keep herself safe.</p>
<p>During her moment of internal thinking, she didn't notice that the guard had left, and she was now alone in the interrogation room. She looked around, seeing grey walls and a small camera in the corner, and she was sitting on a grey metal chair, at a grey metal desk with another grey metal chair on the other side and she knew that soon she was to be thoroughly questioned. She gripped her black leather jacket, taking it off, and placing it on the chair, and pulled on her white silk blouse. She also wore black leather pants, along with her black knee-length heeled boots and she looked like a biker, which was true as her godfather's Harley was resting in its shrunken charm form on her wrist.</p>
<p>She then played with her raven coloured unruly hair, trying to neaten it by putting it into a bun, but given its state and the fact that it had been under a large motorcycle helmet, the best she could do was a messy bun but at least it was out of her face. She checked her arms and hands, looking for signs of her scars, but sighed in relief when she found none, the glamour spell still in place. The lights flickered again and placing her hands on her lap underneath the table, she closed her eyes, and summoned her ring. The silver band with an emerald stone appeared in her hand, and she quickly put it on, before leaning back and crossing her arms. The lights stopped its flickering, and she breathed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the door opened and she looked at the figure walking in. A burly man who looked like he was in his forties walked in, dressed in a black suit and had curly hair. From her intel, she knew the man was known as 'Happy', Tony Stark's bodyguard and driver. He walked in, holding his gaze with her, before resting near the wall, his hands clasped and back straight. Then, he walked in. The man, the legend and all-around philanthropist, Tony Stark, dressed in a suit, and wearing a pair of black sunglasses. If there was a word to describe the ooze of charm that the guy was giving off, she would say that he was a flirt, a 'people' person.</p>
<p>Actually, the more accurate word that Sydney Potter should use to describe the man would be…father.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll keep this short. Who are you, why are you here and what exactly did you do to my technology? My computers were, until seconds ago, playing up and now suddenly they are working. Just moments before JARVIS picked up on unusual activity involving you and about you, but now you look normal. So, who are you?" He demanded, his voice sharp but curious.</p>
<p>She then noticed him giving her the once-over, checking her out and she rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't do that if I was you." She said simply.</p>
<p>"Do what?" He shrugged, oblivious.</p>
<p>"Check me out. I know I'm a pretty girl, but given what I'm about to tell you, you might want to not check me out." She uttered.</p>
<p>He scoffed. "And just what do you want to tell me?"</p>
<p>She smiled, standing up and holding out her hand. "Hello, Mr Stark. My name is Sydney Potter and congratulations, I'm your daughter. Mazel Tov, Daddy, I'm a girl."</p>
<p>She had expected shock, of course…but she didn't expect the man to faint, nor his bodyguard to faint as well.</p>
<p>"Okay…maybe next time Potter, a little more subtlety…."</p>
<p>0*0*0*0*0</p>
<p>How this come to happen, you ask? On the eve of her 25th birthday, Sydney received a parcel. Not just any parcel, but an elderly owl had delivered a birthday present shocker. It delivered a dairy, along with a letter from her dearly departed mother, explaining the mysterious life of the dairy. Apparently, her mother had kept a dairy during the time she was pregnant, and had it revealed that James Potter was in fact not her father as everyone had believed, but billionaire Tony Stark was. Apparently a very young Tony Stark met a very young Lily Evans while she was in Malibu suffering a broken heart and had a remarkable affair with her. The gist of it was, that Lily had just broken up with James, went on a holiday to the US, and Tony Stark declared her his for the entire time she was there. When she came home to England, James had begged for forgiveness, married her and eight months later, baby Sydney was born. But Lily knew that James was not the father, and kept a dairy, so that one-day, Sydney would know herself.</p>
<p>Fast forward to twenty-five years later, a panicked Sydney had decided to confront the man once and for all, and tell him that he didn't need to do anything. So far, Sydney was the only person that knew, as she didn't even tell Hermione. She knew that once she did, Hermione would go berserk.</p>
<p>"You know, it's annoying when someone stares at you and you don't say anything back." She muttered, crossing her arms as she leaned back into the plush lounge that Happy had escorted her to.</p>
<p>They had moved from the small interrogation room to a much more modest office on a higher floor. By higher, it meant the top floor of the Tower, and she tried not to think about just how high she was. It was silly, her fear of heights, given her skill with the Firebolt and having ridden dragons in the past. The office was in fact Tony's, with a glass desk, chairs, a long wooden table, plush lounges and ceiling to floor windows that overlooked the vast city of New York.</p>
<p>"Well, it's annoying when your illegitimate child turns up telling you you're a father and hasn't done the paperwork to prove it." Tony snapped, pacing backwards and forwards in front of her.</p>
<p>Happy stood near the door, his hands crossed in front of him and sighed. "It's annoying how the two of you look so much alike, apart from the eyes."</p>
<p>Both Sydney and Tony were quick to defend that they did not look alike, which only made Happy even more convinced that the woman was indeed his boss's daughter.</p>
<p>"And you act the same…funny that."</p>
<p>"Does someone want to keep his job?" Tony darkly threatened, causing Happy to wave his hands up, giving up on the topic and leave the room.</p>
<p>There was silence, before Sydney could no longer bear it. She reached inside her jacket pocket, pulling out a photo, and a photocopy of her mother's entry about her biological father. She held up the photo, and watched as he stared at it, his face changing as her recognised the woman in the photo.</p>
<p>"This woman, is my mother Lily Evans. Sure, it's not much, but I have a photocopy of an entry that she wrote about you, and about how you are my father, and not James Potter, the man I believed was my father." She informed him, standing up and giving him the photo, along with the dairy entry. "Look, I'm not after anything except answers and perhaps truth. I don't want your money, because I have plenty of it myself, believe me. I just want to know if perhaps my mother is telling the truth."</p>
<p>He gulped, taking the photo and staring at it. It was true that he knew the woman in the photo. After all, it wasn't every day you find out that magic existed. Yes, he knew about Lily being a witch, and about magic. It then made him wonder about the woman standing before him. If she was indeed a witch, then it would explain JARVIS's readings that he had picked up on the woman the moment she entered the building, and how it mysteriously disappeared, making her normal as she could be. How she got her hands on an Avenger's key pass however, was a different story. He also knew that the woman standing before him could also quite possibly be his daughter. It wasn't free of sin week he had with Lily, with them spending their days in bed, round after round. He was then convinced that Sydney was telling the truth, and given her looks, her age and her manner, he was quite sure that if he was do a DNA test, he would find that they would be a match.</p>
<p>"Yes, I recognise the woman. I also remember the week we had, and it is quite possible that there is truth in your words. And I know what you are."</p>
<p>Sydney frowned. "Sorry? I'm not following."</p>
<p>"Magic right? It's why Jarvis picked up on you and how the readings diminished. You're witch like your mother, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Just…okay…how…Oh this was so not how I thought this conversation was going to go." Sydney stammered. "Before I confirm anything, just how do you happen know about magic?"</p>
<p>Tony snorted. "Because I'm Tony Stark, and Ironman….and your mother saved me, exposing her magic to me. And then took pity on me and gave me a week of a lifetime, before your- sorry, James came to Las Vegas and begged for her to take him back."</p>
<p>Sydney frowned. "That wasn't mentioned in the dairy."</p>
<p>"Maybe because she thought she rid the memory of it. But she didn't, and I remembered everything. But didn't tell anyone because really, who would believe the words of a playboy who did drugs and drank everything and everyone on sight? I'm not proud of my younger days…wait, I am but semantics…but I was young, foolish and your mother saved me. Taught me to be a better version of myself." He murmured.</p>
<p>"You only knew her for a week." Sydney pointed out.</p>
<p>"And a week was long enough to see that being the young playboy was not enough. I had to be more if I was to get anything I wanted. Your mother showed me that. Now, not that I am not enjoying our conversation, perhaps this would be a discussion to have with your mother…and me, with your mother." Tony remarked. "So, I assume your mother doesn't know you're here even though you have her diary?"</p>
<p>"She's dead…She died a year after I was born, along with my f- sorry, James, the man I thought was my father." Sydney told him.</p>
<p>He gave a look of pity, and understanding. "I see…Then I am sorry, for your loss. I too lost my parents, so I understand how you feel and why you're here."</p>
<p>"I see. So, am I? Your daughter I mean, given the time and date and events?" Sydney queried.</p>
<p>"Well, there is a DNA test to do, but I know your mother, I can confirm that I was with her during the conception and you have my nose, and you look a lot like me except your eyes. I know those emerald green eyes anywhere. It was what made me interested in your mother. Her vibrant green eyes." Tony stated.</p>
<p>Sydney nodded. "Well…then, let's do it…DNA test…seems simple. Though I am of magic, but you know that of course, and you have resistance to memory spells if my mother had tried to use one on you and it didn't work. Knowing her, she would have used a powerful memory spell. So let's do it then."</p>
<p>Tony approached her, watching as she tried to keep herself calm. "While it's great that you'll agree to the paternity test, I'm sensing that there is something else."</p>
<p>"Look, I appreciate the honesty and your cooperation in this conversation. I did come here wanting to know why my mother kept it a secret. But…Everything I've gone through; this whole thing just doesn't make sense. I thought that I was the child of James Potter, and Lily Evans. And now, I find that I am not their child and everything that I went through in my teenage years just doesn't add up. Voldemort chose me because I was his equal but in actual reality I am not. How can this be?" Sydney mumbled, sitting back down on the lounge.</p>
<p>Tony frowned, wondering what the girl was talking about. "Okay, you're gonna have to be a bit more specific. Who is this Voldemort and what exactly did he do?"</p>
<p>Sydney looked up at Tony. "He was a wizard, a mad wizard that raged war on our community when I was younger. He also killed my parents, all because of some prophecy that I was his enemy. But if you are my father, then everything I went through to bring him down, was for nothing. I was groomed, you see, to defeat him all throughout my teenage years. People I came to love turned out to be working for a wizard I'd had admired before I realised he was using me as pawn in a very big game of chess. But I went on to defeat Voldemort anyway, because it was the right thing to do. I was only seventeen when I went into a massive war with him."</p>
<p>Tony blinked, not sure if he should believe the woman or not. It was hard to believe that a young girl at seventeen would go into a war, but if he knew anything about magic, it was that it was possible. He knew little to none about magic, only that it existed and that there was a massive secret society full of magical beings, and from what Lily had told him in their trysts together. But if there was indeed a war, then the magical community was even more powerful than he thought, covering it up. He then remembered an event a few years ago, before he ever became Ironman, where the country of England was going through series of events that terrorised the nation. It made sense now to find out that there was a war, a magical war.</p>
<p>"Well, I defeated an army of ugly aliens and nearly died releasing a nuke bomb into outer space. It's not the same, but I kinda get it. You do these things because it's the right thing to do, but really, why do you them? For what purpose? Somethings doing the right thing isn't as all as its cracked up to be." Tony voiced, sitting down on the lounge next to her. He then, slowly, clapped a hand on her shoulder and she gave him a look. "Look, I get that we still have a lot to work out, but don't overthink on things that happened in the past. You have the future and it's a bright future. Let's just take this as one day at a time. I assume you brought luggage or a car with you or something?"</p>
<p>Sydney nodded, before sighing. "I did, but your security team took my wand, not that I need it now. Most magic I can do is wandless, but it would be nice to have my wand back."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll get onto that. Until then, you'll stay here, at the Tower."</p>
<p>She shook her head. "You don't have to do that. I have a room at the Hilton just down the road."</p>
<p>He sighed. "I'm afraid I have to. Until we can get to the bottom of this, you know doing the test, you would benefit in staying here. Not only that, any unusual activity that gets picked up, the team finds out. This is the Avengers tower, and every member would have gotten some sort of alert about you. It's a thing I put in place. You're lucky I got to you first or otherwise there would have been problems. So, you'll stay here. Don't worry, the tower is way better than any Hilton."</p>
<p>Sydney opened her mouth, before closing it in defeat, nodding her head. It would be ideal for her to stay there, given the circumstances, but she barely knew the man, even though he was likely to be her father.</p>
<p>Tony clapped enthusiastically. "Excellent! Shall I show you to the guest room on my floor? It's really—"</p>
<p>"MAN OF IRON, I HAVE COME TO ASSIST YOU IN APPREHENDING THE THREAT!"</p>
<p>"Thor, really not the best way to enter…"</p>
<p>"Oh great…"</p>
<p>"Men."</p>
<p>Both Tony and Sydney stood up quickly as the team known as the Avengers burst through the double doors of Tony's office, heading straight towards the duo. Sydney blinked as she saw the man known as Captain America walk in, his hands gripped tightly on his shield, and the red-haired assassin known as Black Widow aka Natasha Romanoff, held her gun at the witch, frowning at her, with the man wearing glasses looking apologetic at her. But her gaze was drawn to the muscled man dressed in a silver and red armour, swinging a hammer in his hand, ready to attack. Suddenly she stumbled backwards as a man appeared hanging from a rope from the ceiling, and she tilted her head in confusion, just wondering where in the world he had come from.</p>
<p>"Stand down, you guys. She's not a threat." The man spoke, looking to her as he walked past. She then saw his face and recognised him immediately. After all, it wasn't every day you see the man who married one of her closest friends.</p>
<p>"And you would know how?" The red-head woman asked. She was still looking at Sydney, confused as the woman was really familiar to her.</p>
<p>"Well, they don't call me Hawkeye for nothing. I've been in the dents, keeping an eye on them and trust me, she's not a threat. Well, she won't be, if I know anything about her." Clint Barton aka Hermione's husband.</p>
<p>"Clint. Funny running into you here. I didn't think you'd be here, considering you're supposed to be on holiday and finally doing that thing that you've been putting off." Sydney muttered.</p>
<p>Clint smirked. "Yeah, that thing will have to wait, especially after you explain to a mutual friend of ours about a certain dairy."</p>
<p>Sydney groaned as she realised what he was saying. Should have known better than to leave the dairy at home where her best friend would just so happen to come across it. But it was her fault really, as she decided to leave it behind instead of taking it with her. She had photocopies of various entries, but the dairy itself was back in her room. And given her behaviour ever since she gained it, it was no wonder Hermione had taken it upon herself to see why Sydney was reacting the way she was.</p>
<p>"Wait, you know each other?" Tony stammered, pointing between the two.</p>
<p>"Yes…" Sydney and Clint both said.</p>
<p>"How?" The Captain asked.</p>
<p>"Mutual friend…" The duo answered together.</p>
<p>Natasha then gasped. "Oh! That's where I know you from. Gentlemen, this is Sydney Potter. Miss Potter, what in world are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"Should I tell them, or do you want to tell them? They are going to find out eventually." Clint stated.</p>
<p>"Wait, she knows you too? Okay…this is ridiculous…" Tony sighed. "Yes, I was going to tell everyone but I had hoped to confirm it before I announce that I have a daughter."</p>
<p>There was silence…it was so quiet that you could almost hear the traffic below on the busy streets of the city.</p>
<p>"You have a daughter?"</p>
<p>"The Girl-Who-Lived is the daughter of Tony Stark?"</p>
<p>"Wait, she knows about me?"</p>
<p>"Oh this isn't going to end well…"</p>
<p>"CONGRATULATIONS, MAN OF IRON, ON YOUR RECENT ADDITION!"</p>
<p>It was like a bomb had gone off, as everyone began to talk. The Captain fired questions at Tony, Sydney growled at Clint for telling his best friend about magic, with Natasha stating that she was an assassin and she kept secrets for a living. The man with the glasses, who Sydney had yet to find out his name, sighed and rubbed his forehead, making it out that he did this every day. And Thor, well…was Thor.</p>
<p>Sydney then gasped as she was lifted into a tight hug, only to realise it was Thor.</p>
<p>"(What a beauty that has stumbled into our humble abode). It is an honour, milady, to meet you. I am Thor, Prince of Asgard." Thor introduced himself, bowing as he kissed her hand, before he frowned at the surge of incredible electricity that passed. He stared back at her, but Sydney was too in shock to acknowledge him.</p>
<p>"(Oh fuck me merlin, of course the lady Fate gives me the God of bloody Thunder as my bloody soulmate!)"</p>
