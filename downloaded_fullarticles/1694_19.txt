          <div class="userstuff"><p>Lily sulks while following Tuney home. In the park, she had acted polite like mum asked, but the results are less than satisfactory. The boy had insulted her, but Lily, under Petunia’s watchful care, couldn’t afford to retaliate the way she wanted, since it would lend her in certain trouble after the flight from the swing. Lily loves her sister, but she is such a telltale sometimes.</p>
<p>“Will you hurry, Lily?” asks Tuney impatiently. “That strange boy might still be following us.”</p>
<p>“He said he wasn’t though” answers Lily while catching up with her sister in a jog.</p>
<p>“People like him lie, Lily” says Tuney pursing her mouth like she had just tasted something like a lemon, “didn’t you see? He was spying on us from behind the bush, and didn’t even have the decency to stay hidden.”</p>
<p>Lily isn’t so convinced, but knows better than to argue with her sister when she gets that expression. Also, arguing is usually boring: it ends with everyone holding onto their own opinion and a lot of time that could be used to <em> do </em>something spent in talking. “Anyway, we shouldn’t tell mummy and daddy,” says Lily, “they’ll just get uselessly worried.”</p>
<p>“It’s not uselessly, we’re being stalked!” answers Tuney.</p>
<p>“He said he wasn’t following you anyway, so I get to choose!” says Lily, and before her sister can retort in any way, she adds “I’ve been grounded for a whole week Tuney! If I have to spend one more day inside this month I’m dying!”</p>
<p>“You’re so dramatic!” says Petunia in a huff, but she looks placated. Lily smiles the whole way home, victorious.</p>
<p>“You look like you had fun Lily” says mummy when they get back. Lily nods. “I love it outside” she says and her mother laughs.</p>
<p>However, thoughts of the strange boy don’t leave her mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s sunday morning when her mother finally decides she can go outside on her own again. “If you cause trouble, I’m grounding you again” says mummy in a warning tone and Lily goes through the effort of looking properly castigated. Tuney is watching Lily sceptically from the kitchen door, and Lily blows a raspberry her way before leaping out the door with a shouted “bye!”</p>
<p>She starts heading for the park out of habit. However, her mind flies to the strange boy of the other day: if he really had been following her around, maybe he’d like to play with her. Lily likes playing with other people better than playing alone; other people, though, don’t seem to think the same about Lily. The girls say Lily is always dirty like a boy, and the boys say Lily is bossy, which to Lily means they’re jealous that she’s stronger than them. So Lily usually goes on adventures alone, and tones herself down to play with her sister. The boy, though, looked like he didn’t mind hiding in bushes or getting dirty, and would probably be a good adventure mate if he liked following people around and acting like a spy.</p>
<p>Lily stops in her tracks, decision taken: she’s going to find the boy and ask him play with her.</p>
<p>Since he’s supposedly stalking her, she starts turning around in jerky motions. “Come out, if you’re here!” she shouts, but her only result is getting an amused glance by a lady with a stroller passing by. She starts running around then, looking behind lampposts and houses, but it doesn’t take much time for Lily to realize he isn’t around. She sits down on the edge of the pavement with a huff. Maybe the boy really wasn’t following anyone around. Or maybe he thinks Lily and Tuney are obnoxious now that he actually talked to them. <em> If you wanted us to be nice, you could have not sprang out of a bush calling people insults </em> Lily thinks affronted.</p>
<p>Under the gaze of another confused passerby, Lily hugs her legs and drops her forehead on her knees. Her hair sticks on the nape of her neck as she tries to concentrate. Tuney had somewhat recognized the boy, had called him… the something boy who lives somewhere by… somewhere by the river. Lily jumps up from the pavement and starts running. At least she knows the river: it runs across basically the whole of Cokeworth, but it’s something. Now that she thinks about it, searching for someone based on what little she knows is kind of an adventure in itself, like that of a detective.</p>
<p>She reaches the river in record time and a bit out of breath. While looking at the river’s slowly moving water, she feels the wind caress her skin and she lets it suggest her which way to go. When a sudden gust of wind blows and points downstream, but to the other side of the river, Lily starts jogging in that direction at a more sedate pace, searching for a bridge. In the meanwhile, she keeps trying to remember what her sister had said.</p>
<p><em> The surname was short and started with… s </em> . But Lily couldn’t remember what followed. She repeated the alphabet in her head, then started: <em> sa, sb, sc </em> … reached the n, she finds it sounds right. <em> It was sn- </em>“Snake!” she shouts. A lady walking a small dog lifts it hurriedly and looks around, worried; she glares at Lily when she sees nothing, and Lily fights the urge to blow her a raspberry, going instead for a guileless smile, before running ahead.</p>
<p>Now she also remembers that Tuney said at something’s end, by the river. She doesn’t think she even knew the meaning of the something, but it can’t be that important.</p>
<p>She finally finds a bridge and crosses it. An elderly lady is feeding bread crumbs to pigeons, and there are <em> so many </em>. Lily laughs running through the pigeons, making them fly all over and also startling the lady, who’s now glaring. “I’m sorry,” says Lily, not feeling sorry at all, “I’m searching the Snakes by the end of the river. Do you know where they live?”</p>
<p>“Go bother someone else with your nonsense, you insufferable pest” says the lady, glaring harder. Lily glowers right back and takes off with a huff. <em> I may have worded it wrong, but still </em> she thinks sullenly.</p>
<p>After a block or so, she spots someone else she could ask directions to and approaches. The middle-aged man is seated on a lone gangly chair in front of an even more gangly building and looks like he would rather be back in his bed sleeping rather than outside sunbathing. A forgotten cigarette is burning itself away in his calloused hand; Lily likes cigarettes and gets distracted watching the smoke draw pretty shapes in the morning sun.</p>
<p>“Are you lost kid?”</p>
<p>Lily’s eyes refocus and she jerks her head up to look at the man’s face. Despite how spent he had looked before, his expression lights up now that he’s smiling, and Lily smiles back.</p>
<p>“I’m not lost,” says Lily, “but I need directions”.</p>
<p>The man snorts, amused. “And where do you need to go?”</p>
<p>Lily thinks at how to word her question this time. “I need to find the Snake boy, who lives at something’s end by the river” she declares.</p>
<p>The man looks confused for a few moments before a flash of realization lights his eyes and he laughs a hearty laugh. “You mean the <em> Snape </em> boy, maybe?” he says.</p>
<p><em> Ah </em>, thinks Lily looking at the man with wide eyes. “Yes, him!” she answers.</p>
<p>“He’s a lucky boy, to have such a pretty girl look for him” he says, and pats her on the head when she quacks a protest. “He lives in Spinner’s End, in the last house nearest to the river…” Lily nods scowling, face red for the compliment, while he tells her the way. “Thank you!” she calls when he’s done. The man drops the now finished cigarette on the pavement and waves at Lily with a last smile. She turns and starts walking the path the man suggested with a new spring in her steps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reaching the right street takes little time, but once there Lily has a moment of hesitation, as there is no name written near the doorbell of the last house by the river. However, Lily is no chicken. It’s not like she hasn’t rang wrong doorbells before: at worst she’ll get scolded, or the house’s owners will call her parents and tell them…</p>
<p>She rings the doorbell before she can continue that line of thought. At first nothing happens, so she rings again, miffed at being ignored. She starts to think there’s no one home when she hears a man shouting from inside the house, loud enough that Lily can catch bits and pieces of what is being said.</p>
<p>“Why… sunday <em> fuckin' </em> morning… kill this b…” Lily hears the voice says.</p>
<p><em> Darn, </em> she thinks, thorn between the instinct to run and wanting to know what will happen. She stands there, awkwardly half-crouched, until she hears the sound of footsteps coming from the side of the house, and here the Snape boy is, staring at her like he can’t quite believe his eyes. <em> I found you! </em> Lily thinks and the satisfaction at her success is enough to make her forget the screaming man inside the house for a moment.</p>
<p>"Why are you here?" the boy asks. <em> Is he rude on purpose or is he just like this </em> Lily asks herself shooting him an offended glare. Going by the flush rising on the boy's thin face, it’s probably the second.</p>
<p>"... instead... screaming… the door… you <em> minus habens </em>!" screams a second voice, probably the Snape mum, much closer than the other. The Snape boy takes that as a cue to shake his embarrassment off. "We need to go!" he says and gestures for Lily to follow.</p>
<p>They run together towards the riverbank and the boy is already out of breath by the time they reach it. "You don't run much, do you?" Lily asks, watching the boy bend over with his hands on his knees while he tries to breath in deeply. In answer, he sends her a baleful look, blushing again. "I <em> walk </em>" he says and Lily raises her eyebrows sceptically, but doesn't comment again as she studies the boy. His hair is a bit cleaner than it was the other day, but he’s missing the coat, which is a pity, because it looked very much like a superhero’s cape and Lily liked that.</p>
<p>When the boy finally catches his breath, he straightens up and they spend a few moments staring awkwardly at each other. The Snape boy’s gaze looks unsure and almost fearful. <em> Maybe he thinks I’m angry about being called a witch </em> thinks Lily. <em> You know what, I actually </em> am <em> angry. </em></p>
<p>The boy’s eyes widen at Lily’s sudden frown, but he isn’t fast enough to dodge when Lily kicks out, and her foot connects with the boy’s shin, hard. He lets out a startled whimper and shifts his weight away from the hurt leg, but he’s scowling too now. <em> Better </em>, thinks Lily.</p>
<p>“That’s for calling me a witch!” she shouts, and the boy scowls harder and looks like he’s about to rebut when Lily shushes him. “Now what’s your name?” she asks.</p>
<p>The Snape boy looks taken aback at that. “Why?”.</p>
<p>“Just tell me!” she shouts, and the boy reluctantly gives in.</p>
<p>“It’s Severus” he mumbles.</p>
<p>“What? That’s way too difficult” says Lily.</p>
<p>“Well, I can’t just change it, can I?” says, sounding miffed, the boy with the way too strange name. <em> I’m never remembering it, let alone saying it </em>thinks Lily, mind working hard to find a suitable replacement. “I’m calling you Sev” she sentences after a few moments and the boy looks at her like he doesn’t really know what to make of her. It’s a look Lily gets a lot.</p>
<p>“Alright?” he answers and Lily takes that as a cue to get to the point of her visit.</p>
<p>“Anyway, since you were watching me play the other day, you must want to join me” says Lily, doing her best imitation of Tuney’s ‘I guess I can grace you with my presence in this one occasion’ voice. She actually isn’t so sure, but a bit of bravado never hurts when it comes to people, especially when they can prove her wrong so easily. “Since today I have nothing to do, I can give you a chance, I guess”.</p>
<p>The Snape boy- <em> Sev </em> Lily mentally corrects herself- is looking unsure again, but there’s something so hopeful at the back of his eyes that makes Lily regret talking so haughtily.</p>
<p>“Also, my name’s Lily” she adds abruptly and shots her hand forward. Sev stares at her hand long enough that Lily starts thinking she might have made a mistake when the boy raises his own hand and takes hers hesitantly. “You handshake with your right hand though” says the boy, blushing again, and it takes Lily a few seconds staring at their intertwined hands to realize she has offered her left.</p>
<p>She scowls. “Shut up” she says as she squeezes the boy’s hand until he cries out in pain, “I’m left-handed”. She softens her grip but doesn’t let go, and the boy is blushing even more now.</p>
<p>“But a handshake’s still done with the right hand anyway” he mutters, looking at spare grass at their feet.</p>
<p>“It’s our secret handshake, then” she says and when the boy doesn’t protest she turns around still holding his hand and starts walking along the riverbank, further out of town. “Let’s go now.”</p>
<p>“Go where?” he asks.</p>
<p>“I don’t know yet,” answers Lily, “but you can come, right?”</p>
<p>She turns around to look at the boy walking behind her and Lily sees him smile for the first time: it’s a small smile, and hesitant, but it’s warm with a touch of mischievous, so she likes it immediately.</p>
<p>“Yeah” he says, and Lily smile back.</p>
<p>They’re going to have amazing adventures together, she can already tell.</p>
