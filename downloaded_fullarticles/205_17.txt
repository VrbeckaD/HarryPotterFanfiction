    <p>Curt Mega huffed along the path of his new home that him and his mother decided to move across to for his new school. Now don't get him wrong he didn't mind moving for a change with the complications with his dad and his magic outbursts when he was younger that could have caught some attention from some muggles near his close-knit area, but moving to a countryside next to London in a cottage without anyone to talk to until he started his new school...was pretty boring even for an 11 year old.</p><p>"Mommy?" Curt called pulling his suitcase across the mud and rock tiled ground watching his mom unlock the door. "In a minute Curtis, your doing great helping me with these bags!" Mrs Mega smiled to him as she swung open the wooden door hearing a small creak come from the hinges. </p><p>Curt trailed along quickly grunting as he pulled his heavy case along into the house with Mrs Mega helping him as he did making sure he didn't injure himself in the process. He's never moved into a cottage before and compared to something he would put as "Modern" for his old home this one relied more on the vintage side. The cobblestone and wooden walls, wooden floorboards, a few vines here and there in the corners, stone and wooden exterior and a fireplace next to an old TV. It was cosy he can give it that but in a way it felt too...different.</p><p>"Mommy I don't feel well" Curt said catching Mrs Mega's attention as she turned around kneeling down to him. She grabbed his hands before feeling his forehead giving a small smile of relief. "Are you feeling little butterfly's in that stomach of yours Curtis?" Mrs Mega asked earning a small nod from her son. Homesickness was the worst possible thing for a child to get which meant 24/7 cuddles and cookies until she can get her's back into a comforting space.</p><p>"It'll be a good thing for you Curtis, you'll make a lot of new friends and I heard there's a secret attic upstairs that you could use as your new secret hideout" "It's a headquarter mom! Not a hideout!" Curt whined crossing his arms hearing his mom sigh. "Don't you start raising that tone with me Curtis, you'll be right at home here before we get ready for your new school tomorrow" Mrs Mega said pulling away her bags to find her room.</p><p>The movers weren't coming with many of their stuff until next week so until then Curt had to make due with a duvet and his old blanket that already needed to be washed. With a defeated groan Curt walked around the vintage household hearing the small creaks of the floorboards press underneath his shoes whilst he looked around. Maybe they accidentally rented a cabin instead due to the smell of firewood starting to fill his nose as he opened his room door.</p><p>Like the corridors and other rooms Curt's looked exactly the same with the smooth wooden floorboards and wooden walls. He spotted a large window by his desk on the left of his bedside which showed the outside of the country with the small view of the city of London that contrasted out of place to the country side of where he now stood in. The bed looked unfinished with it's wooden build and plucked pale duvet but at least it was better than sleeping on the floor or in the car.</p><p>Curt placed his suitcase onto his bed looking up from the ground to see a small entrance in the ceiling to a secret attic his mom was telling him about constantly since their trip here. It had a small piece of string that connected to the entrance, swinging side by side from the breeze entering the room which almost hypnotized Curt with curiosity. Whatever could be in there could be special. Maybe left over treasures or gadgets like one of those James Bond movies. But the only problem was...it was too high for him. Curse having a tiny body.</p><p>"Mommy! I found the attic! I can't reach it though!" Curt called jumping up trying to grab the string with a grunt watching it swing in a taunting manner.</p><p>Mrs Mega walked in with her unpacked fabrics from her arts and crafts box that rested gently in her hands as she watched Curt jump up and down to reach the attic. "You want to check out the new headquarters?" Mrs Mega asked with a smile walking over to the string that earned an ecstatic nod from Curt.</p><p>She grabbed the string giving it a swift pull causing the entrance to the attic to fall down revealing a set of wooden stairs that hit the floorboards with dust emerging no longer after. Mrs Mega coughed at the sudden impact of dust filling her nose while she watched her son excitedly climb up the staircase without hesitation entering the attic. "Careful Curtis! There could be some rats!" Mrs Mega called.</p><p>Curt pushed himself up inside the attic looking around to see an almost large room of the attic that was held up steadily with wooden planks with an array of cobwebs and boxes everywhere that had looked as if they haven't been moved for years. </p><p>It was perfect.</p><p>He explored with a curious gaze making his way towards the boxes that had already been open that gave him the opportunity to look inside. Nothing much was found. Just old books and a few spiders that crawled across it's hard covers in gold writing. A creak was heard from behind him as Mrs Mega came up into the attic looking around with a hum. "Looks like a nice storage place but it could use some redecorating" Mrs Mega hummed spotting the boxes. "What's in here Curtis?"</p><p>She peeked inside almost screaming at the sight of spiders crawling inside that made the abandoned books into their own home in cobwebs and caught food. "Curtis could you-" "Yeah!" Curt exclaimed grabbing one of the dusted and cobwebbed books from the box brushing off a spider from the cover. He handed it to Mrs Mega hearing her gasp in surprise at the front cover giving a gentle smile whilst she flipped through the book.</p><p>"There was a half-blood family here and have hidden away their books, guess we really aren't alone here Curtis" Mrs Mega chuckled as Curt frowned looking at the book beginning to scrunch up his nose in confusion. It just looked like another book about a boring man who was apart of a sea thing that involved a whale.</p><p>"But...it's just a normal book? Why would people like us want that?" Curt asked earning another chuckle from Mrs Mega as she tapped the book. "Flipotis Metromonius" In a quick second the book's words began to jumble themselves around with the cover changing into a blood red along with the picture of the author suddenly moving.</p><p>"It...It moved mommy!" Curt exclaimed in excitement looking as the words finished moving around becoming a new novel on 'muggle studies and the magic arts'. "But how did you-" "Curtis I've been a witch for a very long time and sensing magic on a normal book is like a dog sniffing out a bone! It just comes naturally and soon you will be doing the same as you get older into a strong young man" Mrs Mega smiled beginning to shake Curt's hair with her free hand with Curt letting out a sound of resistance as she messed up his hair.</p><p>Mrs Mega looked once inside with a huff at the mess that blocked the other books away. "Luckily we have some books for your new school so now we don't have to worry about buying more for your new classes...they look new thank god" Mrs Mega huffed in relief beginning to head down to Curt's room. "I thought you were going to make my headquarters mom?" Curt pouted as Mrs Mega peeked back her head into the attic.</p><p>"One thing at a time Curtis, you have a suitcase to unpack for your room then I'm making some soup" Mrs Mega said heading down earning a dramatic groan from Curt. Why was packing away everything so boring? He could just stay here the whole afternoon making a new headquarters dreading each hour for school. The kids might bully him for him being an only american in a British school that has to wear stupid uniforms.</p><p>"Curtis!"<br/>
"Coming mommy!"</p><p>Dinner was pretty quiet that had the only sound of Curt playing with his soup letting it constantly drip off his silver spoon. He admittedly was scared and maybe even a little homesick from home that was miles and miles away from where he is now. It didn't yet feel like a home even with the cool attic he now has in his room. Mrs Mega caught attention of his worry like a mother always would placing down her newspaper with a sympathetic sigh.</p><p>"Curtis honey? You need to touch your food sometime...Is it too much soup?" Mrs Mega asked as Curt shook his head biting his lip. "Is it about the house?" Mrs Mega asked causing Curt to shrug in response. "Is it school?" Mrs Mega asked causing Curt to take a moment before nodding placing down his spoon. He was given a sympathetic gaze hearing his mom close her newspaper pushing her soup to the side.</p><p>"Talk to me sweetie, it's not the end of the world and you'll fit right in with children who can perform what you can" Mrs Mega encouraged. Curt rested his chin on the palm of his hand with a shrug. "The kids...might not like me and they might turn me into a ferret or something if I do something wrong! I don't want them to see me like dad did" Curt explained in worry as Mrs Mega walked over to his side on the table beginning to grab his hands.</p><p>"They are not like your father, he was a bad man and those kids are not going to turn you into a ferret otherwise they'll have to answer to your mother!" Mrs Mega stated proudly earning a small smile from her son. "You can get your own wand like me and they'll be many children who will be feeling the same! You don't have to go alone Curtis" Curt nodded at her words feeling her pull him into a hug rubbing his back "You've done so well coming over here and it'll get better I promise" Mrs Mega said until she broke the hug.</p><p>Curt slowly got out his pinkie with a small smile. "Pinkie promise mom?"</p><p>Mrs Mega gave Curt a matching smile getting out her pinkie with a nod connecting her pinkie to his.</p><p>"Pinkie promise with my heart"</p><p> </p><p>That night Curt was tucked gently into his new bed with a kiss to the forehead before Mrs Mega left to do some arts and crafts to herself before heading to her own bed. Curt looked up at the ceiling seeing the cracked pale exterior that earned a sigh. It could be worse Curt Mega...it could be a haunted house where you can't escape and every wall is covered in scary hands coming to grab him from his bed. Maybe he could get used to this.</p><p>He turned to the window next to his bedside seeing the darkness of the fields and trees move in sync with the bellowing winds that sung through the branches and the grassy lands. The bright lights of London were not far from his vision that glowed against the contrast of the darkness around his new home.</p><p>Curt slowly got out of bed carefully moving towards the window hoping that the floorboards wouldn't creak loud enough for his mom to catch him out of bed. He closed in to the window slowly placing his hand on the window staring closely at the large buildings and it's array of lights. Was the school in there? Or was it somewhere further away from the countryside that'll take years to get to. All he knew from his mom was that he had to take a train...probably magical that flies across the clouds where muggles couldn't find them. That just sounds stupid now that he thinks about it.</p><p>He just hopes, heck even wishes that this year won't be as scary as he's been dreading every second of it to be.</p><p>Maybe he might even make some friends.</p>
