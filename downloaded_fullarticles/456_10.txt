    <p>The soft hissing laughter was the first thing that entered Harry’s disoriented mind, long drawn out syllables filled his thoughts and brought him back into his body.</p><p>
  <em> Shit! Voldemort</em>
</p><p>As if the snake faced bastard had read his thought, which considered was a possibility, Voldemort hissed with barely contained mirth. A cool hand stroked Harry’s brow in a tender way sending a shudder through his body.</p><p>“Ahh Mr Potter,” there was a dramatic pause and Harry almost told him to just get on the Aveda Kadevra,” I see you have decided to join us.”</p><p>Harry’s body caught up with awakening mind and the cold metal encasing his wrists informed him that he was restrained. A momentary flash of panic filled his chest and he took a slow breath to calm his thundering heart. Almost afraid to open his eyes, Harry cautiously took in the room surrounding him, his glasses thankfully on his face. The disorientation wearing off and he looked at the somewhat smiling face of his arch enemy. Red eyes assessing him and Harry steeled himself for whatever was coming, his heart becoming chilled at the possibilities that raced through his mind. A flash of blond hair alerted Harry to Lucius Malfoy’s presence, the haughty blond sneering in his usual arrogant way.</p><p>
  <em>Wanker </em>
</p><p>Voldemort threw back his head and laughed, catching Harry by surprise. Loud and raucous, the laughter filled the room and Lucius frowned at the strange behaviour of his master. Voldemort seemed to compose himself, flashing vivid red eyes at his right hand man who cowered at the look, Harry almost smirked but the cool bite of steel broke the imagined camaraderie. Realising that he was suspended standing, he wiggled his toes, barely brushing the floor and the uncomfortable ache that now made its presence known in his shoulders told him he had been in this position for a while.</p><p>“Now…my dear Harry,” Voldemort’s voice washed over him and he couldn’t help but look into the shining eyes, “I think that we should become better acquainted.”</p><p>Those spoken words were devoid of any malice yet Harry’s breath stuck in his throat and he struggled to swallow the lump that had formed. Inquisitive eyes watched for any reaction and Harry forced himself to meet the gaze, the stare seeming to pierce his soul. A brief strange expression crossed Voldemorts’ face, his eyes suddenly unsure and surprised.</p><p>
  <em> What does he see?</em>
</p><p>Harry tried to follow his own train of thought, looking for any inkling to what the Dark lord may have garnered from staring into his eyes. His ruby eyed nemesis shivered and shook his head slightly as if trying to clear his own thoughts, turning to regard Lucius in a cool manner.</p><p>“So Lucius,” he practically purred the name and the blond preened under the seductive tone, Harry’s brain froze as he realised that he thought that Voldemort sounded seductive, “What have you brought me…by way of convincing Mr Potter that surrender is the only option?”</p><p>Lucius’ stormy grey eyes lit up and he gestured to the table with elegant flourish, almost like the magicians glamorous assistant revealing the next trick. A bizarre image filled Harry’s mind and for a second he wondered if he finally cracked under the pressure, in his minds eyes shining brightly was the image of Lucius in a slinky silver dress. Voldemort froze and whirled to look at Harry, leaving him in no doubt now that the man could read his thoughts. A Snapelike arch of his eyebrow and mirth in the blood red eyes, Voldemort offered a sly smile. Like a private joke shared between friends, Voldemorts’ face revealed that he was amused by Harry’s wild thoughts.</p><p>“My…my Harry…ssssuch ssstrange ideasss.” the parseltongue hiss flowed from Voldemort’s mouth and caressed Harry’s’ skin. Reminding him of a secret he had not even revealed to his closest friends, parseltongue turned him on, blushing furiously Harry lowered his gaze. Mortification raged through his body and he thought back to how he ended up in this predicament.</p><p>
  <strong>Flashback</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “Yeah well…you can just…I don’t know …piss off…that’s it piss off!” Harry shouted and stormed toward the forbidden forest. Ron’s words echoing in his head and his blood boiled as he stomped nosily. </strong>
</p><p>
  <em><strong>Why shouldn’t I have a life!!</strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Ron’s voice echoed in his brain and he shook his head as if trying to dislodge the train of thought.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <strong>“Harry, with the war you can’t risk getting caught.” </strong>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Hating the words but knowing in his heart that his red headed friend was right, Harry found himself standing on the edge of the forest, the eerie night sky illuminating the depths within. His green eyes scanning and feeling strangely drawn into the hidden recesses.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “Maybe I am addicted to danger?” Harry mused as he crossed the threshold between safe and deadly, heart hammering in his chest but something seemed to be calling him to follow.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <strong> Is that why I keep having such strange dreams?</strong>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <strong> Harry stopped for a moment, looking up at the tree obscured night and let out a small sigh. Mentally berating himself for not having the nerve to talk to his friends about his dreams and the yearnings he had felt lately. Aware that all of his friend felt the pressure and longings of being nearly seventeen, sex on everyone’s minds.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <strong> After all its only natural…we all think about sex.</strong>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <strong> “Yeah…like my friends dream about men and snakes.” Harry muttered and stormed further into the forest. His mind full of the debauched pleasure that invaded his dreams, a faceless man touching him and whispering filthy things into his ears, a large snake undulating against him as the hissing parseltongue uttered words drifted over his writhing body.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> The night was ominously quiet and Harry was fascinated by the plume of his breath that fanned out before him on every exhale. Frozen to the stop as a twigged snapped behind him, his last thought was how could he be so stupid before complete darkness overtook him.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> End of flashback </strong>
</p><p>Silence reigned in the room, not even a ticking of an ominous clock there to break it. Slowly ,Harry lifted his eyes to stare into glowing orbs, Lucius standing behind, watching with confusion. Harry broke the stare and looked at the instruments that adorned the table, heart beating faster at the sight. Several floggers made from leather lined the table, needles shining in the torchlight of the dungeon, a strange plastic cage like device and other phallic shaped objects littered the table. The lump in his throat bigger as he recognised some of the objects.</p><p>
  <em> Oh god…they’re nipple clamps…is that a chastity cage…oh fuck that’s a dildo.</em>
</p><p>Voldemort and Lucius watched as Harry realised what they intended to do to him, panic washed over and Lucius smirked as he struggled with the cuffs.</p><p>“Lucius…you may go.” Voldemort softly spoke but the tone brooked no argument, for a moment it appeared that the blond was about to say something but he must have thought better of it, closing his thinned lips and nodding to Voldemort before skulking from the room.</p><p>“Now…we can discussss thossse sssstrange ideassss.” Voldemort whispered as he stalked towards Harry.</p><p>The air in the room seemed to change suddenly charged with a strange kind of energy, Harry’s heart was beating wildly in his chest and his traitorous cock perked up at the rush of blood. The heady scent of arousal permeated the room and Voldemort froze on the spot, his face bewildered and his red eyes looked down to take in the sight of Harry’s rapidly firming shaft. A look of triumphant knowledge flashed within the red depths and Harry opened his mouth to speak, clamping his lips back together when he realised that there was nothing that he could say to diffuse his humiliation. Instead he closed his eyes and prayed for either rescue or immediate death, a soft hissing chuckle reached his ears and he slowly and with great reluctance opened his eyes to look at his nemesis.</p><p>“My My Mr Potter, what a turn of eventssss.” there was a hint of amusement in the tone but also something else, something that Harry couldn’t quite identify.</p><p>Warm breath washed over his face as Voldemort inched even closer, the red eyes almost hypnotising as he looked at him. Harry felt a strange urge to lick his lips and blushed at the thought, a sly smile twitched the corners of Voldemort’s lips. Thin lips moved closer almost close enough to touch his, suddenly moving away and Harry mentally berated himself for feeling the brief sting of disappointment.</p><p>
  <em> What’s happening to me?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> Drugs?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>that’s it he must have drugged me!</em>
</p><p>“You bastard!” Harry shouted, his indignation sharpening his tone and Voldemort hitched an eyebrow sparking Harry’s outrage even more, “You fucking drugged me… you sick fuck!” narrow fingers suddenly clenched his throat ending his tirade and Harry gasped at the sensation.</p><p>Struggling to breath as the pressure against his windpipe increased minutely, glowing red eyes fixed on his and Harry wheezed, struggling against the chains holding him in place. The clinking melodic and haunting as Harry felt his pulse racing and his heart hammering in his chest, Voldemort pressed harder and his thumb rubbed his Adam’s apple in what almost felt like a tender gesture. Harry’s vision began to grey and his mouth filled with saliva, spilled its contents. The warm liquid running down his chin and Harry whimpered as Voldemort shocked him by lapping at the spit and trailing his tongue along Harry’s chin. A satisfied hiss echoing in the dungeon and Harry’s allowed the darkness to overcome him, the last thought in his mind.</p><p>
  <em> Kiss me </em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Fingers grasped his skin, hard and biting, Harry found himself allowing the dream to take hold. Sense memory overwhelming him, remnants of past pleasurable dreams invading his mind. Lips pressed to his and a tongue lapped against his lazily. Harry relaxed into the kiss, comfortable with the way the fantasy would play out, heart beating faster at the prospect of what would come next. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Be mine…my little slut.” hissed words, indiscernible to anyone else but forming perfectly in Harry’s mind, gasped and begging acceptance on his lips. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Sharp bites peppered his flesh and Harry let out a soft moan as the harsher bites followed the almost loving nips. The hard hands gripped him , digging into the tender flesh on the inside of his thighs, Harry automatically spread them and his cock firmed to the point of pain. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Touch me…please….please Master.” a soft pleased chuckle his only response, the fingers abruptly removed and Harry whimpered with disappointment.</strong>
</p><p>His own rasping breath the first thing he heard as he slipped back into the conscious world. Harry shivered and moaned at the combined feeling of the cool dungeon air chilling his naked skin and his raw throat burning as he swallowed.</p><p>
  <em>I’m naked! </em>
</p><p>Frightened to open his eyes and panic rising rapidly, he opened his fevered green eyes to take in the room. The ceiling was the first sight to greet him, struggling against his restraints and realising that he was now chained at the hands and feet in a reclining position. Sharp nails scored along the flesh of his arms and he twisted his head to take in the smiling vision of his red eyed tormentor.</p>
