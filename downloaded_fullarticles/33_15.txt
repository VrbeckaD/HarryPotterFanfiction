  <b>PROLOGUE</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>         The only sound in the dark hallway was the insistent ‘clack-clack’ of two sensible heeled shoes making their way briskly across the stone. A tiny dry cough punctuated the echoing steps as dust swirled in the chill air.</p><p> </p><p>         With the swish of a wand the heavy oak doors opened and the footsteps made their way into the empty chamber. Robes whispered along behind as two cloaked men hefted the large package between them and brought it to the center of the room.</p><p> </p><p>         “<em>Hem hem</em>.” She glared at them imperiously and motioned to the left with a stubby finger. Biting back grumbles the two men shifted the tall, awkward package so that it faced her.</p><p> </p><p>         “Will that be all, ma’am?”</p><p> </p><p>         In a high, girlish voice she said, “You are dismissed.”</p><p> </p><p>         “Yes, Headmistress.”</p><p> </p><p>         Dolores Umbridge inhaled deeply with a smug grin on her toad-like face as if drinking in the perfume of her newest title. Her hand trembled slightly as she ran her fat fingers along the edge of the cloth, then gripped it tightly and pulled it to the floor.</p><p> </p><p>         She whispered to the dark room, “I show not your face but your heart’s desire.”</p><p> </p><p>         Smoothing the front of her loud pink cardigan she cleared her throat with another “<em>hem hem</em>” and stood expectantly in front of the Mirror of Erised. The mirror stood blankly at first, its dark surface impenetrable, until her reflection began to form, surrounded by fawning dignitaries and the Minster of Magic’s badge pinned on her coat.</p><p> </p><p>         She smiled darkly and muttered, “Soon.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <em>New Hogwarts Headmistress part troll?</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Recently instated Hogwarts Headmistress Dolores Umbridge, also Minister of Education at MOM, is just a regular witch with homicidal tendencies and a toad-like complexion.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>OR IS SHE?</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Recent news from one of our sources has revealed that Umbridge may in fact be part troll, a vicious breed of dangerous beasts commonly found in dungeons, caves and exacting tolls below bridges.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>“She is a halfblood troll trying to pass herself off in decent society and failing. Have you seen those ugly cardigans she wears?”</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Umbridge's reinstatement to the position after her summary dismissal ten years ago came with the sanction of Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge himself (see: “EXCLUSIVE: Fudge called out a hit on Stubby Boardman!”), after the death of former Headmistress Minerva McGonagall.</em>

  <em>Students and former alumni of Hogwarts gather at the school this weekend to mark the eighth anniversary of the end of the Great Wizarding War and for the annual memorial of former Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, war hero, who gave his life in the famous duel against the Dark Lord.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>         “Luna, she's as nutty as ever, isn't she?”</p><p> </p><p>         Hermione looked at Neville over the top of her copy of the Quibbler with a wry smile, before folding up the paper and placing it back into her bag. “She certainly has a flair for the dramatic.”</p><p> </p><p>         “I heard she's on another one of her expeditions.”</p><p> </p><p>         “Not more Crumple-Horned Snorkacks?”</p><p> </p><p>         Neville grinned. “No, it's with the 'Help Save Nessie' society.”</p><p> </p><p>         Hermione wanted to laugh out loud, but found herself stifling her mirth and surreptitiously checking to see if the door to their compartment was shut all the way. It had been years since she'd ridden the Hogwarts Express, and the atmosphere inside the train had changed dramatically since her school years. The students inside were quiet and subdued, most sleeping or whispering quietly amongst themselves. Instead of the Prefects that normally patrolled the train aisles, she saw students with the Hogwarts Inquisitorial Squad badges instead.</p><p> </p><p>         Neville similarly had been quiet on the train, his lips set in a thin, firm line as he kept a wary eye outside their door. No students had been harassed so far on their ride, but he disliked the tense atmosphere just as much as they did.</p><p> </p><p>         He had convinced Hermione to come on the train with him this year for the memorial as Umbridge had placed a stringent checkpoint on all Apparition spots into Hogsmeade this year. While that woman couldn't actually do much in the way of barring Hermione from stepping into Hogwarts, they both thought it would be better to try and avoid as much confrontation as possible. She was here in the Professor's compartment as Neville's guest, as he was Professor Sprout's assistant.</p><p> </p><p>         “It's too bad Harry couldn't ride in with us,” Neville said, his eyes still trained outside on the corridor as he watched a seventh year with an Inquisitor's badge walk by.</p><p> </p><p>         “You know Harry...he goes up to Hogwarts early every year to make sure the preparations for Dumbledore's memorial are done properly.”</p><p> </p><p>         A dark cloud passed over Neville's face at the mention of their former mentor's name. “It's not right, you know...it's not right what they're doing. I never thought I'd have Fudge to thank for anything except that he's let you keep your wand-”</p><p> </p><p>         “<em>Neville</em>.” Hermione hissed, shooting him a glare that shut him up quickly. She was touched by the sentiment, but the Hogwarts Express was no place to be airing such grievances. He was going to be the next Herbology professor soon, and she wasn't going to let him jeopardize his position; especially now. The students at Hogwarts would need as many protectors as they could get in the following school years, and Neville and Harry were only two.</p><p> </p><p>         He looked sheepishly to the floor. “You're right, sorry. You'll be okay, Hermione...I shouldn't forget that you can take care of yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>         Embarrassed by the unabashed show of confidence, she couldn't think of a reply and instead said, “We're pulling into Hogwarts station. Let's go.”</p><p> </p>
