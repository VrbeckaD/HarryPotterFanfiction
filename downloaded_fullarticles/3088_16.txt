    <p>Hermione could feel herself flagging, but she pushed forwards, darting across the courtyard as she ducked nasty curses and flung back her own at the Death Eaters.  After Harry's little stunt, coming back from the dead (and <i>Merlin</i> how it had scared her, seeing his limp body in Hagrid's arms, she was going to give him a piece of her mind for that, later), the Death Eaters were scrambling too, and the rest of the Order seemed to have gained fresh energy.  Seeing Neville destroy Nagini had hearted them all, too.</p><p>Voldemort was finally mortal again, though only a few new that little tidbit.  </p><p>They just had to give Harry the chance to face Voldemort directly, and destroy him once and for all.  Then, they could rest.  She just had to keep going, just a little bit longer.  Block the pain and heartbreak from her mind, of the dead lying as though asleep in the Great Hall beneath the enchanted ceiling.  Victory was so close she could <i>taste</i> it.</p><p>"Hermione!" a voice screamed behind her.  She flung herself to the side, rolling across bruising stone as a green curse zipped over her head right where she'd been standing.  Pushing herself back to her feet, she had a brief glimpse of Ron's white face and wide eyes, fixed on something to her left.  She spun around, and a sickly purple curse slammed into her chest.</p><p>Distantly, she was aware of Ron screaming again, but it fuzzed away into static as the whole world slowed to a stop.  Golden sand erupted from the device around her neck, the thin silver chain snapping as she realized with muzzy horror that the curse had impacted directly against the time turner she wore constantly, concealed beneath her clothes.  It had come with the books she had summoned a year ago (an entire lifetime ago, it felt) from Dumbledore's office, mixed into a pile of strange odds and ends that her spell had attracted.  She'd held onto it even after banishing the rest back to the Head's office, a vague and foolish plan half formed in the back of her mind that she hadn't even told Harry or Ron about.</p><p>Now, her mind struggled, sluggish and thick, to formulate some plan of escape from the growing cloud of dust that surrounded her, beginning to flash in a neon rainbow kaleidoscope of color.  She had no idea what curse had hit her, and her brain didn't want to work quite right.  <i>I can't leave,</i> she thought, arms reaching out as though to push through the cloud and barely leaving her side, muscles growing as heavy as lead.  <i>Harry needs me.</i></p><p>The thoughts didn't help.  She was frozen, everything outside the cloud that engulfed her gone from her sight.  Without warning, a jerk like a Portkey snapped into existence behind her navel, and she screamed.  The cloud of glowing dust collapsed in on her, and everything went black.</p><p align="center"> HPHPHP</p><p>She floated for an eternity.</p><p>If there even <i>was</i> a "she," or a concept such as floating.</p><p>Nothing existed, and everything was, and consciousness slipped in and out of grasping not-fingers like sand.</p><p><i>Please</i>, came a voice in the dark.</p><p>Her voice?</p><p><i>Please,</i> it begged again.  <i>I don't want to die.  I'm not ready to die.</i></p><p>
  <i>Please, just let me go back.</i>
</p><p>There was no answer from endless void to the accidental traveler's lonely cries.</p><p>It was dark, and it was quiet, and time stretched on either side of her like warm toffee just barely holding together between sticky fingers.</p><p>A little more pressure, and it would break.</p><p>She, for there was definitely a "she," kept doing the thing that felt like floating.</p><p>Why was she floating?  What did it mean, the tension shivering in the strands of time surrounding her?</p><p>A hole appeared, a tiny break in the pattern, ripples against the smooth surface bulging out and weakening everything around it.  Like a moth to a flame (<i>like a what to a what?</i>), she was drawn to the break.</p><p>It grew with her approach, a gaping black chasm that churned with sickening unnaturalness.</p><p>Time wasn't supposed to break and bend.</p><p>Holes were not meant to grow in accommodation of those who traveled too far.</p><p>The edges of the hole were jagged.  Each edge shone like the blade of a knife, sharp and dangerous.  Not right.</p><p>As she dropped towards the growing hole, the entire thing split in two, a new and unblemished band of time growing out towards the beginning of eternity from the one before her.  It drifted into the distance, joining into an infinity of other bands, structures that warped and rivers that flowed as smooth as silk all stretching forwards and back in their own eternities.</p><p>The strands behind her, the origin of the hole, snapped forwards, enveloping her in something impossible.</p><p>She opened her mouth and screamed, memories and consciousness slamming back into her with the force of a car hitting a brick wall.</p><p>And Hermione Granger landed hard on the rough stones of a courtyard warmed by midday sun, took in her surroundings with shock that quickly overwhelmed her exhausted mind and body, and promptly passed out.</p>
