  <strong>I. A moment's respite </strong>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Percival? Have you seen my - oh.”</p><p>Newt stills in the doorway to the shed, sweaty and dirty and tired, with his sleeves rolled up and his trousers stained with god knows what. His heart gives a little lurch, painful in a good way because the sight before him is so very beautiful. Percival is reclined in the hammock Newt strung up at some point or another in the corner of the shed. His eyes are closed, smokey black lashes fluttering against the alabaster of his skin, teasing like butterfly kisses. Those pale lavender lids twitch as he dozes. One of his powerful forearms is draped across the flat plains of his stomach, the other trailing out of the hammock until his index finger drags against the smooth floorboards. The obsidian of his hair gleams in the soft sunlight trailing in through the windows, splashing across his face and body and bringing the web of spider silk thin scars that reside there into existence.</p><p>He is so very beautiful, in his fitted dark pants and bare feet and soft, cream coloured shirt with the sleeves rolled up and the top two buttons undone. He is so very beautiful and it makes Newt’s heart ache.</p><p>Magic glimmers in the air around the hammock, gentle and so quiet one has to be looking for it to see it at all. Newt notices it because he’s trained himself to look for things out of the ordinary. This magic is woven into the fabric of the hammock, enchanting it to rock back and forth at a languid pace, soothing Percival off into sleep.</p><p>Newt smiles, crossing the threshold and creeping over to the dozing man. He kneels down beside the hammock, reaching out ever so slowly to intertwine their fingers together, callouses against callouses, scars against scars. The familiar slide makes Newt warm and tingly and he’s sure the smile on his face is positively ridiculous. The contact wakes Percival, he’s such a light sleeper sometimes, and he rolls his head to look at Newt with sleepy brown eyes. A smile pulls at Graves’ lips, just as dozy and handsome as the rest of him.</p><p>“Hi,” Percival murmurs, voice rough with sleep. Newt huffs out a laugh, squeezing the other’s hand gently. He caresses the back of it with his thumb.</p><p>“Hello to you too. Did you have a nice nap?”</p><p>Percival nods, blinks, yawns, and then stretches. He groans, deep and content, drawing himself into his body. Newt finds himself distracted by the way the Auror’s muscles play beneath his shirt. He’s so caught up in imagining the pull and stretch of those powerful pectorals and the valleys of his abdominals that he misses the arm wrapping around his back until it’s too late. Newt shrieks, wriggling as he’s hauled up into the hammock. Less so because he doesn’t want to be there and more so because Percival’s fingers have landed on a particularly ticklish area that has Newt squirming.</p><p>He nearly upsets the hammock; they rock wildly for half a moment before Percival has the bearings to still them. Newt ends up on his front, chest against Percival’s stomach, his lower half between the man’s powerful thighs. “Really, Percival, you could have asked,” Newt huffs, but makes no attempts to move. Instead, he rests his head against the soft cotton of Percival’s shirt and listens to the strong thudding of a strong heart beneath the skin. When Percival speaks, the sound resonates through his ribcage and directly into Newt’s ear.</p><p>“You’re here now.”</p><p>“I am. But I can’t stay long, I have other things to do.”</p><p>Not that Newt wants to do them at this moment. He would much rather remain pressed flush with Percival, listening to the man breathe, the soft rasp of the air in his lungs as it comes and goes; it’s like his own personal lullaby. The hammock begins to rock again, back and forth, back and forth. Newt suddenly feels very sleepy. Percival cards his fingers through Newt’s sweat damp auburn curls, the rough pads of his fingers massaging his scalp, easing away the tension that sometimes grows at Newt’s temples. The magizoologist goes boneless, exhaling loudly in the sudden quiet. It draws a chuckle from Percival.</p><p>“Stay,” the Auror commands, gently, “Everything else can wait.”</p><p>Newt hums, eyelids growing heavy. He can feel himself slipping away and wonders if he really wants to fight it. “Stay,” Percival says again, as if sensing Newt’s uncertainty. His other hand comes to rest on Newt’s back, heavy and warm and comforting. Newt does as he’s told. He knows that eventually they’ll have to get up; he has chores to finish and editing to do and Percival inevitably has to work, but for now they have this.</p><p>A moment’s respite.</p>
