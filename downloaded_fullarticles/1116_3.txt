    <p>In the span of a few hours, the whole school was thrown into an uproar. I stood at the top of the staircase, wondering when it had all gone wrong as students crashed into each other amidst their rush to get out of the building.</p><p> </p><p>"We're too late." Mas clicked her tongue next to me, visibly annoyed that our initial plan had been foiled. "They're going to ambush us anytime soon, those greedy bastards."</p><p> </p><p>I rubbed my temple, feeling the migraine coming up. Izaya's plea for us to save the entire school seemed like a far-fetched idea now that the situation had taken a worse turn. The least we could do was to avoid our own selves from breaking apart.</p><p> </p><p>I took out my wand and held it on my throat. As soon as I spoke, my voice came out loud and strong like a speaker. "Everyone, can you calm the fuck down?"</p><p> </p><p>Some of the students actually stopped to stare at my vulgar words, but more ignored me. Sighing, I threw up an explosive spell that sparked fireworks in the air which immediately got everyone's attention. Hundreds of confused faces searched my own, questioning.</p><p> </p><p>"Look, kiddos. I know you all don't want to die, and to be frank, neither do I." I said point-blank, not wanting to sugarcoat my words. "So stop running around like headless chickens and listen to me, you dipshits."</p><p> </p><p>I explained in a short, compact explaination— that the upper years were working together to form a protective shield around the Great Hall in exchange for the missing professors. Students up until fourth years would stay inside, and the other three years would be on standby.</p><p> </p><p>"But we're just students... We can't just... YOU can't just order us to fight a bunch of Death Eaters!" A Ravenclaw student yelled out, followed by a wave of murmured agreements around him. I narrowed my eyes at his blatant cowardice and answered coldly,</p><p> </p><p>"Then stay behind with the kids and stay the coward you are." </p><p> </p><p>There were a rush of footsteps coming from behind, and I turned to face Mila, a prefect from my own house. "Huda, the preparations are done."</p><p> </p><p>"Alright. If you can direct these students over there, it would be greatly appreciated."</p><p> </p><p>Mila didn't complain as she ushered everybody to the Great Hall, and her gentle attitude finally got them to soften up. Mas let out a snort next to me as the large group slowly trickled away from the area. "You look annoyed, Huda."</p><p> </p><p>"Of course. Those lower form kids talk big about duels and all, but when it comes down to it they're just petty. Selfish kouhais." I almost spat the words out as we walked down the hallway towards the courtyard, where the fountain was at.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, your anger makes you stronger so please stay this way."</p><p> </p><p>Scattered outside and chanting various spells to add protective layers to the dome above us were my other friends. Some of the particular students who were more gifted at hexes were still going on strong, like Idris and Aiman. </p><p> </p><p>I approached Wafa, who was being flanked by Bedah and Hanan. She was crouching in front of various apparatus that were bubbling over the edge. The liquid smelled absolutely vile. "What's... what's that?"</p><p> </p><p>The three of them turned to me with disturbing smiles. Wafa gave an uncaring shrug of her shoulders. "Oh, you know. Just experimenting on some new potions."</p><p> </p><p>"You... don't tell me you're going to bunch acid on them!"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh no, not acid." Bedah interjected, her eyes shining with knowledge that was expected of a Ravenclaw. "Just a mixture of mercury and other sorts of liquid. It won't be enough to melt throughout skin, but we can at least blind them."</p><p> </p><p>The usually kind, tame Hanan nodded in agreement as she added another splosh of green liquid that caused a small explosion. </p><p> </p><p>See, this was why a Ravenclaw shouldn't be shoulder to shoulder with a Slytherin. They're just evil beings. I wouldn't be thinking up poisonous concoctions to throw at my enemies, Hufflepuff or not.</p><p> </p><p>"Faris sama, your chant is all wrong!"</p><p> </p><p>"I mean, if a wrong spell can still get them..."</p><p> </p><p>From the other end of the courtyard were the legendary trio, busy with chiding each other as they practiced; Faris sama, Eikram and Fariq. Known for being the absolute pranksters of the school, they were idiots with good brains which meant their skills with Charms were top notch. Faris sama was bad with memorising spells, but even if he flubbed them it usually still ended up useable.</p><p> </p><p>Nah, let's not even bother them. I didn't want to become their practice target.</p><p> </p><p>"Huda." Farha joined me, her concern visible on her pale face. She must had been exhausted from setting up the shield. "Are you okay? With all that problem with Izaya..."</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know. On one side, her betraying us wasn't exactly that unforeseeable. But it was too convenient." I told her my observation, trusting in her instincts as the journalist of the school. "It just seems... weird. Izaya admitted to telling those Death Eaters our schedules. That didn't explain how they managed to round up all the professors and capture them."</p><p> </p><p>"You mean... There's someone else?" Her voice was quiet as she repeated my suspicion, and she tucked a finger under her chin in deep thought. "It's a possibility. Maybe they ratted her out on purpose so that we would let our guard down from the inside."</p><p> </p><p>"That's what I thought, too. Problem is, I just can't suspect anybody..."</p><p> </p><p>An explosion from the outside halted our conversation, and we looked up to see the dome glowing blue. Someone from the outside was beginning to attack. Silence enveloped the courtyard for a few seconds, before everyone took place with wands ready in hands.</p><p> </p><p>"I hope Ali and the others are already there." I muttered to myself. While the ones over the courtyard were responsible for blocking access into the building, the rest were at the bridge connecting to the school, where the Death Eaters would have to pass through first. </p><p> </p><p>Our batch had the strongest duelists all around. Mas and Fariq would also belong there, but we would end up dead if they weren't here to provide backup. Ali, who was leading the first team had the highest reputation at the school; he was an arrogant Slytherin, though he wasn't unfair and unkind. </p><p> </p><p>During the first great war that involved Harry Potter, Slytherins were cast aside because they were considered evil. Times had changed, and now all four-coloured robes stood together in unity.</p><p> </p><p>"As long as there's a tattletale among us, we would never win. They're only going to provide information that would weaken us." I stated, feeling the lump in my throat as the severity of the situation finally crashed down on me.</p><p> </p><p>I felt Farha's eyes on me as she waited for a clear response. I casted my eyes downwards as I asked her a simple question. "Tell me, Farha. If you're trying to observe everyone from a single spot, where would you be inside the school?"</p><p> </p><p>She chewed on her lips and without a second thought answered me. "At the rooftop, where the bell tower is. It got a bird eye's view throughout the school."</p><p> </p><p>"Then that's where I'll be heading." I exclaimed without even thinking about it, my legs already carrying me away. A sharp tug at my arm stopped me immediately, and Farha was glaring at me fiercely.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm going with you. You're going to get yourself killed if you go alone, with the state you're in."</p><p> </p><p>The arm she was holding was visibly shaking. I hadn't even noticed I was trembling. The sheer shock from Izaya's betrayal still hung at the back of my head, and it was a presence that was weighing down on my conscience.</p><p> </p><p>I nodded. "Alright, then let's hurry up."</p><p> </p><p>We disappeared from the courtyard in a jiffy, to catch the actual suspect that had orchestrated today's performance.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>(3rd P.o.V)</p><p>The fight had erupted at the bridge, as Huda had predicted. Ali lead the group with a precise coordination— one strike of his wand could send a few Death Eaters to tumble from the bridge into the deep ravines below. </p><p> </p><p>"We can attack them as long as they're outside of the dome! Get as many of them as you can before the shield dissipates!" </p><p> </p><p>A shield disabled attacks from the outside momentarily, but retaliating from the inside was possible. Ali kept that in mind as waves after waves of spells shot past him towards the incoming Death Eaters. He had some of the best duelists under him, but they were still students.</p><p> </p><p>They were bound to have their limits. And the Death Eaters kept coming.</p><p> </p><p>Nabilah and Shareiz were still going on strong, their combined force even stronger than his strength alone. Shareiz was good at disarming his enemies, which he then passed the finishing job off to his girlfriend. The jinxes that Nabilah specialized in were especially... messy to deal with, proven by the Death Eaters that became her victims. Ali flinched as a Death Eater that came too close shrieked loudly, his arm twisting backwards and letting out a painful crack.</p><p> </p><p>Well, best not to deal with an angry woman, he thought to himself. First love she might be, he wasn't sure if they were ever a perfect partner.</p><p> </p><p>"Confringo!" A blast whizzed past the side of his head, enough to trim his sideburns. Before he could turn around, Iqra stepped up next to him. Despite their obvious height difference, her menacing glare was more than enough to make him feel intimidated despite the fact that he was towering over her.</p><p> </p><p>"Get yourself together, Ali." She warned him coldly before going away to take down more Death Eaters. </p><p> </p><p>His exhaustion was getting to him. Spells began to overlap inside his head, and everything seemed to blur together. He'd contributed a lot to building the dome earlier; he should be resting.</p><p> </p><p>There's no time to rest, he firmly told himself, pointing a wand at a group of Death Eaters that were getting too close for personal space. "Incarcerous!"</p><p> </p><p>His aim missed by a few inches, and the wizard he'd been trying to hit roared in laughter. He winced as the men surrounding him join in, the laughter a blatant insult to his deteriorating skills. </p><p> </p><p>"How rude." </p><p> </p><p>He shifted his attention to his side, where Mierani stood. Her signature magic crackled into life a sheet of ice formed a wall in front of her. She knocked on it with her wand, shattering it into pieces that flew by and cut through air as they disarmed Death Eaters.</p><p> </p><p>It was a clever way to store energy. As expected of the third best duelist in the batch. Mierani's significant other, Bazil, was still inside guarding the Great Hall with others like him who weren't tactically offensive, but even without his presence she could do well on her own.</p><p> </p><p>Forget about Nabilah, all the girls in his batch were scary as hell. Ali looked up into the sky, questioning the author's morality and when she would show even the men could be badass.</p><p> </p><p>He took a few steps back as more of his batch mates came forward, whipping asses. He crouched down and took deep breaths to regain his strength, and that was when he heard the damning sound of the shield beginning to crack under pressure.</p><p> </p><p>Ali!" Shakir called out to him, Amirul following closely behind. They were always joined together at the hips, these two— "We're going to hold them back as long as we can. You should retreat first with the others."</p><p> </p><p>Ali gave a firm shake of his head. "No, we're not leaving. What will happen to the two of you then?"</p><p> </p><p>"We're going to apparate." Amirul said calmly, his eyes trained on the waging war in front of him. </p><p> </p><p>Of course. Shakir would definitely earn them enough time to retreat with his powerful defensive spells, and time was awfully precious. Even if the Death Eaters managed to break through again, Amirul could just whisk them away somewhere else.</p><p> </p><p>Ali weighed in the decision, feeling his lips. He heard the dome finally caving in as a hole enough to fit a man formed, and knew the answer.</p><p>"Don't push yourself too much."</p>
