    <p>November 1942</p><p>The problem with Sirius Black being a spy, thought Lily Evans as she turned into the bitter head wind, was that he was just too obvious. She leaned forward and lifted herself up from the bicycle seat to get more strength behind her pedalling and keep up her speed. It wasn’t a particularly ladylike way to ride a bike, but Lily wasn’t exactly a lady.</p><p>She began listing the supposed arguments for Black clearly being a spy, as explained to her by her colleagues at Bletchley Park. First, there was his supposedly Italian mother, the source of his slightly disreputable good looks. Other versions of the story gave him an Italian grandmother, or possibly even his great-grandmother. While perhaps one of these facts was true, Lily also knew that Italian wasn’t on the fairly extensive list of languages he could speak. It was pretty flimsy as a piece of evidence, but nonetheless his ancestry was a mark against his name.</p><p>The other side of Black’s family counted against him as well. His father was a well-known MP, and while his Party had quietly attempted to usher him off to the most distant of the back benches, his ill-considered comments about the Nazis had not been forgotten. Orion Black’s statements that “the Germans have got the right idea about the Jewish problem” and “that Hitler fellow is a leader with a proper backbone” were frequently quoted over the tea cups at Bletchley as damning evidence of the son’s duplicity.</p><p>Lily could not remember Black himself ever making any such statement herself. As she turned the corner and the wind whipped her hair into her face for a moment, she tried to think of any statement he had made which was remotely supportive of Hitler or antisemitic. He was certainly full of cutting insults, but she could remember none of them ever referring to a person’s race.</p><p>The third point, and the only one which had any merit in Lily’s opinion, was the matter of money. Black was undoubtedly an extravagant man, and she could easily believe he was living beyond his means. He wore expensive clothes and cologne, could always procure whatever strictly rationed food his friends, acquaintances, women he was attempting to charm and even his landlady were hankering after, and rode around on his Vincent Black Shadow. Not that Lily had the faintest idea about motorbikes, but anybody who spent more than a few minutes in Black’s company knew all about his Vincent. He never shut up about the damned thing and rode around the village and surrounding countryside day and night as if there was no such thing as petrol rationing.</p><p>He obviously came from a wealthy family, but there were rumours that he was in some sort of trouble with them and had been cut off from his allowance, possibly even disinherited. Lily heard a lot of idle gossip and was sure that much of it was rubbish, but she’d heard that particular rumour from someone she considered reliable.</p><p>The problem with that piece of evidence, Lily thought as she reached the gates of the Park, was that it went against points one and two. If he didn’t get on with his family, then surely it was unreasonable to assume he shared their political views. And yet, once the news spread around Bletchley Park that Black had been arrested, it seemed that every second person Lily spoke to considered it no surprise to them that he turned out to be a spy. They would quote the three points, along with other damning pieces of evidence such as ‘I never liked him’, ‘I always knew there was something off about him’ and ‘you can never trust a man who wears his hair too long’. Thus was Sirius Black condemned.</p><p>Lily genuinely had never liked Black. She could, in fact, wax lyrical on the things she thought were wrong with the man – his arrogance, his loudness, his temper, the way he would fawn over those he wanted to impress and bully those he didn’t. As far as she was concerned, he was an obnoxious, spoiled, selfish brat. But she was quite sure that none of it pointed to him being a spy.</p><p>Lily dismounted from her bike and began pushing it towards hut 6. It was starting to rain and she was grateful that she was nearly there. She left the bike leaning against the side of the hut and walked inside, unbuttoning her coat and removing her scarf and gloves. The hut was cold, and she might put them on again later, but for now she was warm with the exercise.</p><p>“Ah, it’s the lovely Miss Evans.”</p><p>“Go away, Potter.”</p><p>A woman like Lily should never speak to a man like James Fleamont Potter in such a manner, but after well over a year of his hopeless attempts to court her and her equally hopeless attempts to put him off, she had realised she could get away with saying almost anything to him. She was starting to enjoy seeing just how far she could push him.</p><p>“My dear Miss Evans, how the sweet sound of your voice brings music to my day.”</p><p>It was comments like that which made her wonder whether he was genuine or mocking her. Lily’s northern accent, acquired from the streets of Cokeworth where her father was a manager at the mill, was considered quite hilarious by the polished debutantes who worked in the quiet of the Registration Room. Lily worked in the busy, noisy decoding room, with a group of girls who were  more middle class and less condescending but, even there, her accent set her apart. She spoke like the children she had grown up with, boys and girls whose fathers worked in the mill if they were lucky or, if not, didn’t work at all.</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes and walked past him, her mind still thinking of Potter’s friend, Mr Black. Potter would agree with her that Black was an unlikely spy. He’d made his opinion clear when Black was arrested, but it hadn’t held much sway, given that the pair were best friends. Lily didn’t think there was much point in taking her concerns to Potter. For a mathematician, he was remarkably illogical, really only intelligent when it came to tasks like code-breaking. She needed someone who could consider the evidence, not just their personal loyalties.</p><p>As she settled down to her desk in the decoding room, she put Black out of her mind. She had a stack of messages to test and should could not afford any errors. So, for the next few hours, she gave her whole attention to the strings of letters, typing them into the Typex machine and checking for recognisable German in the resulting text. She knew that a lot of the women hated the decoding room, which was dimly lit and cold as well as being noisy, but Lily didn’t mind. This was a far more worthwhile use of her typing skills that being the secretary to some man who patronised her and tried to grab her bottom as she passed. Potter might declare his undying love at every chance, but he would not stand for any man laying a finger on the women in his hut.</p><p>Lily only thought of Black again when she went to get a cup of tea with Mary and Marlene, known as the Scottish twins as their surnames were MacDonald and McKinnon, although neither had ever been to Scotland. Another young man apparently believe himself in love with Mary, and Marlene was responding with wide-eyed disbelief at his attempts to win her over. Lily passed on Potters comment about her voice bringing music to her day, then tuned out the rest of the conversation. She was frustrated by the trivia which seemed to be the focus of their lives, as if the most exciting thing that they could ever imagine was their wedding day.</p><p>And she couldn’t stop thinking about Black. It troubled her, to have her thoughts so occupied by a man she disliked, but she just couldn’t believe that he was a spy.</p><p>The most compelling fact in Black’s favour, she thought, was that if Sirius Black was going to be a spy, he’d have done it properly. He wouldn’t have made himself obvious and got caught with stolen papers tucked into the pages of a disreputable men’s magazine. He’d have made sure that he was utterly above suspicion and would have got away with it for years.</p><p>Black was not like a lot of the other men at Bletchley who tended to be good at only one thing. He was not, for example, like Potter, who could do remarkable feats with codes and cribs and ciphers, but couldn’t organise himself to comb his hair or match his socks. Black was good at everything he turned his hand to. He’d initially studied languages at Cambridge, but then decided that the mathematics his friends Potter and Pettigrew were studying seemed more interesting, so he had switched. He had turned out to be an excellent cryptanalyst and had an encyclopedic knowledge of Luftwaffe call signs. He also played the piano and had memorised a wide selection of popular songs, accompanying any young man or woman who fancied themselves to have a decent singing voice.</p><p>So Lily was quite sure that Black would have been just as good a spy as he was cryptanalyst, accompanist, conversationalist and everything else that he did.</p><p>She looked around Hut 2, where various groups of men and women were drinking their late night tea in an effort to keep themselves awake, and wondered who she could take her suspicions about Black to. The obvious choice was Severus Snape, her friend since childhood,, but he loathed Black and she doubted his impartiality as a result. Besides, they’d grown apart since he’d been working up at the main house, with Riddle and his group who were responsible for Bletchley security. It appeared to her that Severus, now he had a posh accent and posh friends from his posh school, considered himself better than Lily. He’d gone off to that school with little more than his scholarship and the clothes he was wearing, while Lily, from a nice family and just as bright at school, had studied typing and worked for the odious Mr Fudge until Severus had got her the job at Bletchley. </p><p>Hearing Potter’s laugh across the room, she looked across at his table and wondered whether there was anyone else among his and Black’s friends that she could talk to. She ruled out Pettigrew immediately. She’d long ago figured out that his work wasn’t worth the paper it was scrawled on. It was full of errors and generally of little use, and she wondered how he’d ever got a degree at all. The Prewitt brothers, twins who finished each others’ sentences and made indiscreet comments about girls they were seeing, were also out, since anything told to one was immediately told to the other, as well as to their sister who would then tell half the Park.</p><p>The one that Lily’s mind kept coming back to was Remus Lupin. She didn’t know much about him, apart from the obvious – he didn’t say much and he’d been badly injured in the Blitz. His face was a mess of scars and he walked with crutches. She could see him now, crutches leaning against the side of the table as he sat talking to Dorcas Meadowes, one of the few women who worked as a cryptanalyst. Dorcas was a quiet girl who never bothered to wear makeup or do anything with her hair, but she was smiling as she talked to Lupin.</p><p>Most of the girls avoided Lupin, as he didn’t look like much of a prospect, with his shabby clothes and injuries, but Marlene and Mary had both been out with him on occasion, generally to concerts but also to the pictures. Although neither had any particular fancy for him, both had commented that he had good manners and was very cultured, able to quote Rupert Brook and Wilfred Owen along with Shakespeare, and with a great knowledge of English music.</p><p>There was one thing holding Lily back. She’d made a comment about him to Severus, and he’d warned her against him. He’s not what he seems, he’d said, you should steer well clear. And Lily had, until now. After all, Severus was keeping company with Tom Riddle, Lucius Malfoy and Evan Rosier, among others. He was hardly in a position to pass judgement on who Lily should be talking to.</p><p>As she left her cup on the tray and returned to the noise of the decoding room, Lily’s mind was made up. Lupin – she would talk to Lupin.</p>
