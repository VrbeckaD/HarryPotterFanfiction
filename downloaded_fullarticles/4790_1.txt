          <div class="userstuff"><p>Step one, step two, step three, step four,<br/>I walk up to the house, and open the door.</p><p>Step five, step six, step seven, step eight,<br/>I’m here, I’m here, but minutes too late.</p><p>Step nine, step ten, I step no more.<br/>I see my best friend, dead on the floor.</p><p>With a heavy heart, I take step nine,<br/>On the kitchen table, a half-bottle of wine. </p><p>Step ten, step eleven, they come too fast,<br/>I look back and see a life, consigned to the past.</p><p>Step twelve, step thirteen, my heart beats hard,<br/>It’s for me, on the table. A birthday card.</p><p>Fourteen, then fifteen, I collapse to my knees,<br/>A tear on my cheek, but nobody sees.</p><p>I get to my feet, then take seventeen,<br/>Steps on the carpet, meticulously clean.</p><p>Eighteen,then nineteen, the tears flow free,<br/>I’m so sorry James, it should have been me.</p><p>Twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, step again,<br/>Forgive me, my Lily, forgive me, my friend.</p><p>Twenty-four, twenty-five, I count in my head,<br/>I step with my feet, weighted with lead.</p><p>Twenty-six, twenty-seven, I arrive at the room.<br/>The scent of magic speaks only of doom.</p><p>I step once more, my foot edges in,<br/>This cost too much to be called on a win.</p><p>Twenty-nine comes next, and I see him there,<br/>Voldemort is gone, though it doesn’t feel fair.</p><p>Thirty, I stop. My grey find her green,<br/>Left open by the curse, still fierce and keen.</p><p>I collapse to my knees, and I feel dread grief,<br/>The sob of a child, a life still brief.</p><p>In the corner I see, crouched there is the cat.<br/>A hatred burns in me for that bastardous rat.</p><p>In my arms, I take Harry, still crying for mum.<br/>It pains me to think that she’ll never come.</p><p>I begin my walk down, and take step thirty-one,<br/>The rest follow suit, as I cradle his son.</p><p>James Potter is there, Lily Potter above,<br/>And lying with her, he who never knew love.</p><p>Hatred burns through me; my tears hurt my cheeks,<br/>The seconds feel like hours, the minutes like weeks.</p><p>Hagrid is here, he bursts through the frame,<br/>He’s crying, I notice, and I do the same.</p><p>I collapse on his shoulder, and the tears flow thick,<br/>He takes Harry from me. My stomach feels sick.</p><p>And then only darkness. I collapse on the floor.<br/>I dream once more, of walking through that door.</p></div>
