    <p>I have a lot of ideas.  I also have a problem finishing what I start.  What happens when you combine these two things?<br/>Lots of shiny WIPs in all shapes and sizes!</p>
<p>These stories vary in length, subject, and relationships  I will include a brief description with each one, so you can see what I was trying to accomplish with it.</p>
<p>There is no smut in any of these stories, but some of them do contain scenes of violence, references to past rape/non-con, or other things that might make a reader uncomfortable.  I will post warnings in the summary of each chapter.  The summary will also contain an identification of any relationships.</p>
<p>None of these works have been edited, so they may contain inconsistencies, contradictions, or spelling and grammar errors.</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least: the world of Harry Potter--its people, places, things, and ideas--belongs to J.K. Rowling.  I own any original characters.</p>
