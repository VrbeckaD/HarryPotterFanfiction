    <p>You sat in the Gryffindor common room, staring at the dying embers in the fireplace, while your (e/c) eyes glazed over for a couple minutes.<br/>"_______?" You looked to see Fred standing in the doorway.<br/>"Yes, Fred?" You'd always have this subtle way of figuring out which twin was who, which always amazed the Weasleys. It was the holiday season, which meant that the Yule Ball was really close, but you doubted you'd go. Fred drew in a nervous breath, before speeding through his question.<br/>"Would you go to the Yule Ball with me?" Your head snapped to him in shock.<br/>"Me?" He nodded.<br/>"I've...um....had a crush on you since first year..." A pink powdering settled over his cheeks and yours had turned a rosy color.<br/>"O-Of course I'll go with you. And...I've actually been crushing on y-you since the first train in first year, when you shared your sweets with me..." He smiled and tilted your chin up to place a passionate kiss to your lips, which you returned, wrapping your arms over his neck.</p><p>-timeskip-</p><p>It was time for the Yule Ball and Fred was standing at the bottom of the steps wearing a midnight blue suit with black dress shoes and his hair was neatly combed down. He was pacing slightly, nervousness racking his body. George put a hand on his brother's shoulder.<br/>"What're ya so worked up about? I'm pretty sure your date won't care what you look like, as long as your night is good. That is...did you bring a date or are you alone?" Fred was about to answer, when they heard the clacking of heels on the tile of the stairs and looked up. You were wearing an ankle length light (f/c) dress and (f/c) heels. On your neck you wore a silver pendant and you wore gold and silver bangles on your wrists. Silver snowflake earrings dangled from your lobes, as jeweled beads decorated your hair. For make up, you did very little. A little mascara brought out your eyes and a little blush was dusted over your cheeks, as your lips were painted with a light pink lip gloss. Stepping down a stair, you smiled at his gobsmacked expression, flashing your pearly white teeth. Your hair, which is normally up in a high ponytail, was down, going to your waist and flaring out slightly at the end. The room had gone silent, as everyone stared in your direction, even Dumbledore had stopped, awestruck. Not even he had seen you with your hair down. There were whispers around the room from people wondering who was your date and some were trying to guess. You finished your decent and turned to Fred, who'd given a slight gentlemen's bow, extending a hand to you.<br/>"May I have this dance, young Miss?" Going along with him, you grasped his outstretched hand.<br/>"Of course, kind Sir."</p><p>Soon, the rest of the room broke from their shock and the music resumed. George patted his brother on the back.<br/>"Fred, are ya gonna introduce me to the lovely lady?" You elbowed him.<br/>"George, I know I don't have my hair up, but really?" He laughed and went back to his date. The music became slower and you laid your head on his chest, a quiet sigh of pure happiness leaving your lips. You two stopped dancing for a moment, but no one else noticed. Pulling him down by his shoulder, you sealed his lips to yours in a sweet kiss, his returning it without hesitance. When you both broke away, you pulled him over to sit down, where George waltzed up with devious grin on his face.<br/>"I saw you out there." Fred looked to you and back to his brother.<br/>"So? She's my girlfriend."<br/>"Eh?! And when were ya gonna tell me?"<br/>"We knew you'd flip out. We've been dating for a couple weeks," you smiled, holding Fred's hand in yours. After the festivities ended, Fred brought you back to the common room and you kissed his cheek, before going into the girls rooms to change and get to bed.</p><p> </p><p>-timeskip-</p><p>Two years later, you were walking with your hand intertwined with Fred's. It'd been a year since you both had graduated from Hogwarts and you'd been helping him and his brother at their joke shop in Diagonal Alley since then. Coming upon a cliff, Fred rubbed his hands up your upper arms lovingly. He pulled you closer to it and you found yourself peering out to see the magnificent lights of the small town you worked in.<br/>"It's gorgeous..." You felt your boyfriend shift to be looking straight at you.<br/>"______, you've brought an even greater light into my life than I thought possible. You're smart, funny, nice, and I love you with all my heart."<br/>"I love you too Fred, but what's wrong?"<br/>"Nothing, it's just that..." He got on one knee and pulled out a blue velvet box, opening it.<br/>"Will you marry me?" The ring was simple, yet beautiful. It had a gorgeously crafted diamond embedded into a white gold band and on the interior was engraved, the word 'forever'. You gasped, tears leaking from the corner of your eyes.<br/>"Yes! Of course yes!" He stood with a wide grin and slipped the ring onto your left ring finger and doing the same to himself with a silver wedding band. He then lifted you up and twirled you around, dipping you down to capture your lips in a short kiss. He didn't set you down afterwards, though. He opted to bridal carry you back down to the shop and to spread the word to his family.</p><p> </p><p>-timeskip....again.....sorry-</p><p>Another year later, you were married and happy, then the Battle of Hogwarts happened. You'd arrived with the twins, helping defeat Death Eaters right and left like mad. Running through the destroyed interior of the castle to find anyone that would need help. Outside of the Room of Requirement you saw Fred fighting a man wearing a black cloak and skull mask. Off to the side there was another man, but you didn't see him at the moment. Running to your husband, you helped him fight off the first man, as the second shot a spell that made the environment around you two to explode. Stone and shrapnel ripped at both of your bodies, but it was over quickly. He was laying face up and you were face down, both of you in massive pain. Painfully, you both turned your heads to the left to look at each other.</p><p>You moved your left hand to intertwine its fingers with his left, clasping tightly as they laid in the space between your bodies. Streaks of tears poured down your cheeks and a thin line of red poured from your lips, as did his.<br/>"Fred, I'm so happy I met you on the train nine years ago....I love you..." With some difficulty, the redhead lifted your joined hands up to kiss the back of your hand softly, before dropping his arm back to were it was.<br/>"I'm h-happy too. I love you too ______. Re-Remember the Yule Ball?"<br/>"Yeah?"<br/>"You looked like that to me everyday I knew you...." A light smile crossed both of your faces, as the life left his eyes and they fluttered shut for the last time. Your eyes began to dim, as your hair, which had nearly grown to the floor and was tied up in a French braid, became lifeless and dead. The last thing you saw before your eyes dimmed completely and fell closed, was the blurry form of Molly Weasley running towards you and Fred.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>~Extended Ending~</p><p>You and Fred watched from heaven as George named his fraternal twins. He had had a boy and a girl, both with Weasley red hair.<br/>"Fred II and ______ II. In memory of their fallen aunt and uncle." A tear trickled from his cheek, only to be brushed away by his wife, Angelina.</p><p>You leaned against Fred, a small smile on your lips and a couple tears leaving your eyes, as you both walked back into the light to hopefully wait the long while before you both would meet your families and friends again.</p>
