    <p>Draco knew exactly what Sam was playing at. It wasn’t the first time that someone had taken him home, stared at his dark mark. Told him that it wasn’t his fault. That he didn’t have a choice. That they knew who Draco Malfoy <em> really </em> was.</p><p>Sure, there were wizards out there who still hated him. They had every right to. It’s not as if Draco was a good person after all. He hadn’t tried to stop horrible things. He had done horrible things.</p><p>And yes, in the end, he had helped. If you could call it that. He handed Potter his wand. More like he threw it at him. And that had helped Potter kill the Dark Lord.</p><p>Scarhead had made sure everyone knew that. Precious Potter had gone in front of the Wizengamot, the press, the Minister of Magic himself and had announced that Draco <em> bloody </em> Malfoy had helped him save the day. That he couldn’t have survived, that they wouldn’t have won, if it wasn’t for him.</p><p>So, in some way, he had Potter to thank for the chiseled man who was currently nestled between his thighs. After all, if these slags couldn’t get their hands on Golden Boy, Draco was practically the next best thing.</p><p>Draco threw his head back into the mattress as Scott attempted to suck his cock, his lips tightening around the head, gagging slightly as he tried to take down Draco’s length. Draco winced as he felt dry fingers tug against his bollocks, before they began to venture south.</p><p>He grabbed his wand and cast a <em> solutam </em>, irritated that once again, he would have to prepare himself if he wanted to get properly laid tonight.</p><p>“Just fuck me already,” Draco whined as he frustratingly fisted the sheets below him.</p><p>Excited by the invitation, Steve released what little hold he had on Draco’s cock with a swift pop.</p><p>“You want this, baby? I’m going to make this so good for you.”</p><p>Draco swallowed hard, hoping the internal cringe he was feeling wasn’t showing clearly on his face. Seth didn’t seem to notice.</p><p>“You’ve been through so much, baby. I’m going to take care of you,” he moaned, his breath uncomfortably hot against Draco’s ear as his cock fumbled to find the slickened hole.</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes before taking his own hardened length into his lubricated hand, stroking his cock methodically. He wanted to just get fucked, and then floo the fuck out of there. By the time Sean’s hard member breached the first ring of Draco’s arse, he was already on the edge, rubbing his thumb against his slit as the man above him rutted erratically.</p><p>“Yes, baby, you like my dick? Like how good it feels?”</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut, hoping to block out the moonlight as well as the sounds of that word, <em> baby </em>, from his ears.</p><p>He wasn’t a baby. Draco Malfoy didn’t need someone to coddle or hold him. He certainly didn’t need a daddy. What he needed was a nice, warm shower. Possibly some beans on toast.</p><p><em> Merlin, </em> this was taking too long.</p><p>Draco began pumping his cock harder, trying to focus on the fumbling length that was jutting in and out of his arse, completely missing his prostate with every thrust.</p><p>If it wasn’t for Harry fucking Potter, Draco wouldn’t be in this mess.</p><p>He thought back to Potter that day, in the courtroom, dressed like he was still on the run in those muggle jeans and that ratty grey t-shirt, the same thick black glasses surrounding those stupid green eyes, as he just stared down every witch and wizard in there. Like he was daring them to go against his wishes, daring to see what he would fucking do if they sent the Malfoys to Azkaban after he saved the entire wizarding world.</p><p>Draco moaned as he felt his bollocks tighten, the first waves of his climax finally crashing over him. His moan must have encouraged Shane along, the brute now clawing against Draco’s lithe hips as he followed Draco over the edge.</p><p>He sighed in relief, casting a quick cleansing charm over his chest and arse as the man above him withdrew. Draco felt a heavy arm drape over his waist, trying to pull him against the fit chest.</p><p>“I just want to hold you all night, baby,” Sid declared before he stuck his tongue in Draco’s ear.</p><p>Draco shuddered, disgusted by the wetness that breached his inner ear canal. He was no longer able to obtain his composure.</p><p>“Yes, well, thank you, Stu, but I really must be going,” Draco grimaced as he twisted out of the other man’s grasp. He grabbed his trousers and headed for the warm flicker of the floo. He barely heard the other man’s groan before he picked up the powder and called out his destination.</p><p>“Stu? Baby, wait, it’s Sh -”</p><p>--</p><p>“He called you what?” Pansy asked incredulously the next day at lunch.</p><p>“Baby.”</p><p>“Well, that’s disgusting,” Pansy sighed as she lifted her mug of tea.</p><p>Draco stabbed his salad angrily with a fork before dragging it to his mouth. “And that wasn’t the worst part,” he spat, his mouth full of lettuce. “He also said,” Draco paused to swallow his food, “that he wanted to take care of me.  Hold me all night.”</p><p>“Don’t want to snuggle, Draco?”</p><p>“The last thing I want is some sweaty bloke suffocating me while I try and get my eight hours.  And I can take care of myself, been able to for quite a while, thank you very much.”</p><p>“Hmm,” Pansy rolled her eyes. “You really do know how to pick ‘em.”</p><p>“Pot meet kettle,” Draco responded with a flippant hand. “It’s not like you’re finding all of these diamonds. You just seem to bring home the rough.”</p><p>Pansy shot Draco two fingers. “Yes, well, I may have just polished off a very desirable specimen if I do say so myself.”</p><p>“Oh, please. Do tell me about how you’ve miraculously uncovered the perfect man.”</p><p>“Men, actually. One for me, and one for you, darling.”</p><p>Draco couldn’t help but sigh. Pansy’s set-ups were usually highly attractive, with the personality of a bologna sandwich. Bland and horrible, unable to keep a decent conversation despite usually being able to perform an adequate blowjob.</p><p>“I am not signing up for another one of your blind dates, Pans.” he shot her an incredulous look.</p><p>“It’s only blind if he doesn’t wear his glasses,” she muttered quickly before adding, “You owe me one. Remember that date with Chad?”</p><p>“I would prefer to forget, actually. Although my crotch still hasn’t forgotten what hot soup poured on ones trousers feels like.”</p><p>“Great. It’s settled, I’ll see you tomorrow night at the Leaky.”</p>
