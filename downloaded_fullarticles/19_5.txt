    <p>“Kiss each other.”</p><p>The Weasley twins recoiled as if struck. Hermione immediately let out a breath of relief. They had boxed her against a wall with their lanky arms, faces so close to hers that she could almost count each eyelash, and it was <em> overwhelming. </em> Their breaths had smelled of mint because Hermione had mentioned her penchant for mint during an earlier conversation; it reminded her of her parents and her parents were dentists, straighten and whiten and pull and <em> don’t look at me like that, they’re just doctors. Think of Madame Pomphrey or Phillipus Aureolus Theophrastrust Bombastus von Hohenheim or —  </em></p><p>“Excuse me?” </p><p>“You heard me,” Hermine crossed her arms, chin up as she tried to ignore her pounding heart, and the blood rushing to the tips of her fingers and toes, making her lightheaded. “Kiss each other.”</p><p>Fred and George goggled at her. Hermione tapped her foot impatiently. </p><p>“You two kept arguing about who gets to kiss me first, and that isn’t fair.”</p><p>“How — “ Fred sputtered.</p><p>“How isn't that fair?” George finished.</p><p>Hermione sniffed, her cheeks a voracious red. “There’s two of you and only one of me.”</p><p>In reality, she was stalling. What if her breath smelled? What if her lips were chapped? </p><p>What if she was <em> bad? </em></p><p>She had seen people kiss: her parents, movie actors, that annoying couple back home who loitered in the library for private time. She had also read about kissing, a subject impossible to escape in the wild and wondrous world of literature. </p><p>But reading and noticing doesn’t mean she can do it. What if she’s worse at kissing than she is at <em> flying? </em></p><p>Fred and George’s lips thinned. They still looked unconvinced. </p><p>“Which means,” Hermione quickly continued. “I have to deliver <em>two </em>kisses while both of you only give <em>one</em>.”</p><p>“Why don’t you give us both two then?” George asked.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes.  “Because then I’ll be giving four while you two only give two. So no matter how many kisses I provide,” Or rather, they take. “It will never even out. So both of you need to kiss. For fairness.”</p><p>“For fairness,” Fred clenched his fists.</p><p>“For fairness,” Hermione repeated.</p><p>She thought incest was supposed to be common in the wizarding world. Hermione had thrown herself into research after being called a mudblood and traced the family trees of all the bloodlines in England. Brothers coupled with sisters in the Gaunts and a plethora of cousins married cousins within the Blacks and Malfoys. Even the Weasleys were part of this incestual, genome stew; Fred and George had no right to be acting this way.</p><p>Hermione sniffed. “I won’t kiss you unless you kiss each other first.” </p><p>The ultimatum stilled Fred and George and the air surrounding them all. Hermione grew aware of the sweatiness of her palms, the scalding blood gushing through her veins, the lightheadedness that filled her skull and threatened to lift her off the ground. Her heart pounded as if to break through her ribs and escape.</p><p>Fred’s knuckles were bone white, nails undoubtedly digging into the soft flesh of his palm. George’s slightly depressed left cheek indicated he was gnawing on the inside of his cheek. Their blue eyes were stormy, and both clenched their jaws, causing a small ripple across their skin. </p><p>Their tics were fascinating, simultaneously revealing their similarities and differences. </p><p>Hermione’s breath hitched. </p><p>Fred, ever the more daring twin, ever the more bold twin, ever the <em> older </em> twin, darted forward. He moistened his lips with a quick flick of his tongue and pressed them against George’s mouth. No, not pressed. He <em> brushed. </em>He brushed his lips against his brother’s, soft and quick and almost not there, impossibly light and gentle. </p><p>He drew back, cheeks flushed, and snickered. “You call that a kiss, Forge? You’re going to make Hermione <em> weep.” </em></p><p>George, equally red, threw his head back and laughed loudly. “I’m saving my energy for her. Can’t you tell, <em> Gred? </em>”</p><p>Hermione allowed them to snip at each other. Jokes were how they coped. This was no exception.</p><p>Eventually, she cleared her throat, lightheaded with excitement. “My kiss?”</p><p>Fred and George beamed and bounded over.</p><p>The tension was ignored.</p>
