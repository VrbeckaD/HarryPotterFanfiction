    <p>Draco was beautiful. He always had been. He was tall and willowy, like most of the others in his family. Draco was graceful, each of his movements looked like the beginnings of a dance. He had a strong jawline and daring grey eyes. He was the most beautiful person Harry had ever seen.</p><p>This caused Harry to question their relationship. Why would someone so perfect want to be with him? When they had started dating Harry made sure he didn't get too attached, he was sure it wouldn't last long. Draco would get bored with him. But five years had passed, and they were married now. It made his thoughts spiral. Of course he wanted to be with Draco, but the real question was; Why would Draco want to be with him? </p><p>Harry was tall, not as tall as Draco and not nearly as graceful. While Draco was all angles and edges, Harry was all curves. The youthful roundness of his face, his (as Ron so lovingly put it) sausage fingers. Everything about him was so childlike. He had to fix it or Draco wouldn't  love him anymore.</p><p>So he started small. He opted for salads instead of big meals. He ate more vegetables. He drank more water. But after weeks of doing that he still looked the same. He still looked unworthy of Draco's love. So he started making bigger changes to his diet. No bread. No sugar. Nothing unhealthy. No eating before 10 and after 5. And most importantly, never eat more than 500 calories. Harry knew logically a man of his size needed more food than this. But he decided Draco's love was more important than a few meals. It was hard (Draco cooked the best pasta he had ever tasted), but Harry knew he had to keep going.</p><p>And it wasn't just his eating that had changed. He started lying. He didn't mean to. But Draco pestered him with questions about food and it was easier to tell him he ate with Ron than that he didn't deserve to.</p><p>Every skipped meal meant he was getting skinnier. He didn't know when he had started to want to be skinny, but once he had felt his ribs protruding from his stomach, there was no going back. </p><p>But today Draco had made Harry's favorite pasta, and Harry was feeling uncharacteristically good about himself (he had lost 5 pounds). So he grabbed himself a plate and ate with Draco. He had kinda zoned out though, then one serving became three and Harry couldn't stop himself.</p><p>"Well someone's hungry today." Draco chuckled, effectively snapping Harry out of whatever daze he was in.</p><p>Harry made a few quick observations. Firstly, most of the pasta was gone, and due to the fact that Draco could usually only finish a plate or two, Harry came to the grim conclusion that he was the one who had eaten it all. Secondly, Draco loved using copious amounts of cheese in his pasta. Harry must have eaten at least 2000 calories in one sitting. And lastly, Harry felt horrible. His stomach was turning uncomfortably and he was starting to feel a layer of sweat covering him. He had to get this food out of him.</p><p>"I'm going to shower." Harry said abruptly and turned and went to the bathroom before Draco could respond.</p><p>Harry had been forced to go through health training to be an Auror. He knew the easiest way to make someone throw up (albeit he was only supposed to use it when someone had eaten something poisonous). After turning on the shower, Harry stood over the toilet and bent forward so he wouldn't miss the bowl (cleaning up regurgitated fettuccine didn't sound fun). He pushed his fingers to the back of his mouth and wiggled them slightly. After gagging a few times he felt the pasta coming back up his throat. He quickly moved his hand and heard the noodles splash into the toilet. He opened his eyes and saw that it was only a small portion of what he had actually eaten. He thought this would be faster. He sighed and put his fingers back in his mouth.</p><p>...</p><p>When Harry returned back to the kitchen to help Draco with cleaning (he liked to do it the Muggle way) he found that Draco was already finished.</p><p>"You took a long shower" Draco said knowingly while sipping his tea. He always had a cup after dinner.</p><p>"Uh, yeah." Harry replied. What if Draco knew what he had done. </p><p>"Harry take a seat. We need to talk." </p><p>Harry's heart skipped a beat. This was it. Draco was done with him. He knew it would come one day. He was stupid to think this would last.</p><p>"Harry I'm worried about you." Draco said softly. He had set down his tea and grabbed Harry's hands.</p><p>Harry didn't know what to say. He was worrying Draco. He was burdening him.</p><p>"You never eat with me anymore."</p><p>Harry shrugged nonchalantly. "I ate with you today."</p><p>Draco ran hand through his hair. "Before today when was the last time you sat down with me and ate a full meal."</p><p>Harry looked at him confused "Just yesterday I-"</p><p>"Salad is not a full meal. And it definitely isn't all you should be eating in a day." Draco cut him off.</p><p>Harry stared at him dumbfounded. He couldn't remember the last time he had eaten with Draco. A little part of him was happy, happy he had stayed in control for so long. But a big part of him didn't want Draco to think any of this was his fault</p><p>"And I called Ron." Draco started "He says you haven't even called him in the last month, much less ate lunch with him."</p><p>Harry opened his mouth to respond, but then closed it. His carefully crafted world was falling apart. Draco would never want him if he found out what he was doing to himself. Draco liked things that were practical and elegant. Harry wouldn't be surprised if he dumped him on the spot.</p><p>"Harry, look at me." Draco grabbed his hands. "What's going on? You never want to touch me anymore and your lying to me. Harry if you didn't want to be together anymore then-"</p><p>"No." Harry snatched his hands away from Draco as if he was tainting him. "No Draco it's not like that." His voice had cracked midsentence. No wonder Draco didn't want him.</p><p>"Then what is it Harry? You never eat and we haven't-" Draco cut off midsentence. He had started putting the pieces together.</p><p>Harry kept his eyes on the tiles l of the floor. "Do you-" Draco started. "Do you have a problem with your body?"</p><p>Harry didn't like that. He didnt like the way Draco made the idea sound heinous. "Maybe I do." Harry said defensively. "Maybe I'm tired of being ugly and fat. Is that really so wrong?" He grumbled</p><p>And Harry was ready for Draco to agree with him. He was ready for Draco to tell him he was right and that he should keep going. But then Draco did the unthinkable. He reached across the table tilted Harry's chin up and kissed him. </p><p>When they parted Draco shook his head a mumbled "You're an idiot."</p><p>"I know." Harry said sadly.</p><p>"Harry, you were never fat or ugly. And even if you were it wouldn't matter, because I love you."</p><p>"I just wanted to be better for you." Harry said.</p><p>"Come here you idiot" Draco said extending his arms for a hug, "You're already perfect."</p>
