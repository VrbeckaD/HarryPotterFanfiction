.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius Black flew away from Hogwarts with an unsteady heart and a heavy mind. Things didn't sit right with him.  He had been listening to the kids when they spoke to him. Dumbledore had ordered them to mess with time. Dumbledore who if Fudge was to be believed was now Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. Harry was so small. Harry had wanted to live with him, Sirius Orion Black, escaped convict. NOT visit or stay for a while no he'd wanted to move in right away. He'd been running away from home when Sirius had first met him.  </p><p>Obviously something was wrong there. First Sirius would fly Buckbeak to Uncle Alphard's island. No, no that was to far away by hippogriph. Well if Harry wanted to live with him then Sirius would just have to make it happen legal or not, and the girl with all the hair whose name he still couldn't get right had given him the perfect idea.   </p><p>Instead he'd head toward Eduardus's estate, It was closer and that particular Ancestor had been 'disowned' mostly so the family could save face. He had after all been a very successful serial killer. Part of how he'd done it was the use of time turners. Their were still some at his Estate. Eduardus had evented and built several designs of his own that modified the possible uses of a time turner. The entire place had been kept up in secret no one except the head of the family and his heir were ever informed that the place even existed.  </p><p>Sirius aimed Buckbeak for a small town just outside of London. The old house wasn't much just a modest farming home but with a good few acres attached to it. Enough for Buckbeak to be comfortable. Knowing he'd need a disguise and to get heathy he immediately called for all of the Black family elves loyal to himself.  </p><p>He set them to gathering supplies and cleaning as needed. The Ritual rooms needed scrubbed down and set up. Sirius had access to a whole room full of time turners he could go back with Harry before he escaped prison and cross over to another country.   The bedrooms and kitchen needed to be sanitized first so they could actually live here. It took two days of intense work but the house was finally livable.  Food was gathered from the greenhouses or purchased discretely from magical farms, and stored were appropriate. Books on healing from dementer exposure were found and purchased. </p><p>Along with texts on healing magical children in abuse cases. Just in case his worse fears were confirmed. After reading the books and giving it a good bit of thought Sirius had the family books brought to him and found someone he thought he could trust if they gave him a vow. Belvina Black a fourth cousin of his was a potions mistress who'd not been a death eater nor did she have any particular love of the law or ministry. Once he'd taken verataserum and answered her questions, She willingly gave him a vow to keep his secretes and to help heal not only him but his godson as well.</p><p>Belvina was happy to help Sirius, at first for the opportunity to get one over on Narcissa. The snobby bitch had been going on and on for years now how she would be inheriting the Black family vaults and Estates. Her haughty attitude had been grating on Bel's nerves for years of holiday dinners her parents had forced her to attend. </p><p>However the more she got to know Sirius the more she liked him and wanted help for his sake alone. Still she did have a personal stake in Sirius getting his name cleared. Bel hade been dodging marriage offers, dates, and salacious offers for the last fourteen years. If she could help Sirius and eventually clear his name he might help her stay single for life. </p><p>She had recently confessed this and after being pressed told him why. She had never in her life experienced any sexual attraction to any person ever. Not even slightly. The thought of getting sweaty and naked with another made her want to hurl. So she happily and dutifully helped Sirius research and prepare for taking charge of his health and life. </p><p>Sirius scrubbed himself down so many times that he'd turned wrinkly and all his skin was pink.  He shaved all the hair off his body and washed two more times, just in case.  When he was as clean as he could possibly be he walked naked to the first ritual rooms and began the first of ten purifying rituals he'd chosen to rid himself of the taint of Azkaban.  </p><p>The first ritual had involved bathing in goats milk. It had turned a nasty brownish black by time he was done and he'd had to repeat the ritual two more times before the milk stayed whitish and only then had he been able to move onto the second ritual. Rituals one, three, and seven all had to be repeated for maximum effect. Which Sirius hadn't really anticipated so it took him longer than he thought it would to begin his recovery. In between rituals he ate large meals with medicinal draughts and drank healthy shakes laced with nutrient potions curtesy of Belvina. </p><p>0000000000000000000000000000000000</p><p>Three weeks after Harry and Hermione waved good bye to a man and his hippogriph, a shaggy dog made it's way through empty yards and dark paths towards Private Drive in Surrey. His spiked collar was enchanted to keep him under people's radars. So long as he didn't go around attacking people than anyone he passed would view him as unimportant and would forget about him as soon as they looked away. He would stay around the neighborhood and do some reconnaissance before Harry came home.  </p><p>Padfoot waited in the hedges in number fours back yard until the fattest child his poor eyes had ever seen, snuck in leaving the door open behind him.  For his godson Sirius would risk anything.  He followed his nose to a small cupboard under the stairs, strange that his scent would be so strong there. Sirius went up to the second floor and hit jackpot. </p><p>The Hogwarts Express had arrived only that afternoon. Vernon Dursley had left to pick him up and the kid should be home soon. Sure enough a car pulled into the drive and doors could be heard opening and closing from here. Then voices arguing came into the house and closed the door a purple faced Vernon was screaming that there would be changes that they would no longer be so lenient or forgiving of his freakishness not after what he'd done to Vernon's poor traumatized sister.   </p><p>Padfoot sat on top stair and shifted into Sirius canceling the notice me not charm on his collar as  the collar itself shifted into a strange spikey necklace.  "Well you were partially right their will be changes." He said softly just loud enough that Harry, Vernon, and Petunia heard him. </p><p>"Who the devil are you!" Vernon shouted. "You've no right to be in my house I'll call the police!" </p><p>Sirius threw his head back and laughed. "I've already disabled your phone, and my name is Sirius Black." He watched as their eyes widened and they stepped back. Petunia was mouthing the words 'mass murderer'. "Yes, that Sirius Black." </p><p>Sirius sat down on the stairs stretching his legs out. "Come here Hadrian let me see how my favorite nephew is doing."</p><p>"Hadrian?" Harry questioned.</p><p>"Nephew?" Petunia squeaked.</p><p>"Yes, Harry your proper name is Hadrian. How did you not know that?" Sirius replied before turning to Petunia. "Yes Petunia, my nephew, Mr. and Mrs. Potter adopted me when I was sixteen, legally only mind you. So while we aren't blood related we are still family." </p><p>Harry raced up the stairs to give Sirius a hug. The man smiled and gave him a tight squeeze before settling Harry on the stairs beside him tucked neatly into his side. </p><p>"Now Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, I do believe we have a business arrangement to discuss. You see Dumbledore needs Petunia's blood to help power the security measures he has around the place, so good news for you, I can't kill you." Petunia put her hand over her heart rather dramatically and all but fainted as she sat suddenly on the hall chair. Vernon in a rare moment of intelligence realized that promise didn't include himself and edged his body into the corner and closer to the door.</p><p>"What kind of business deal?" Vernon asked. "We can all be reasonable here."</p><p>"I'm glad you asked." Sirius told him with a smile. Sirius snapped his fingers signaling his house elves and a with a pop a small table with contract parchment and a fountain pen appeared before the Dursley's. "This is magically binding contract. I'll summarize it real quick then shall I? Just state if you agree after each point.</p><p>"I agree." Vernon nodded relaxing slightly this wasn't so bad Vernon negotiated contracts all the time.</p><p>Point one: Hadrian needs to 'live' in the house with petunia for a set amount of time to recharge your security features. During that time I will send Hadrian all the food he requires and one of my house elves will keep the house and yard clean and looking good. Don't worry no one will see them or ever know that they are here. "</p><p>"I agree." again this wasn't so bad, he would see the boy less and wouldn't have to worry about spending any money on him.</p><p>"Point Two, the room you have for him now is too small for a growing boy so you will renovate it into a guest bedroom, and Hadrian will live in the attic. I will work on it so that the attic looks perfectly normal we can use the side space for storage I'll fix it up so its safer. And the rest we can turn into a sitting room and a bedroom. I can bring over a bathroom in a wizard space closet so that neither Hadrian or I will need to use your water supply while here. When Hadrian turns seventeen he'll move out taking all magical items with him and the space will be yours for what ever you want. " </p><p>Free renovations on the Attic, much less time to see the freak. "I agree"</p><p>"Point Three, While Hadrian needs access to magical things and items for your safety and peace of mind we will agree that neither Hadrian nor myself will use any spells or active visible magic while on your property."</p><p>"I AGREE!" Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon shouted in tandem with each other.</p><p>"Point four, I will provide Hadrian with all medical needs, school supplies, and clothes  mundane (muggle) or magical that he may need. So that at no time will he be a strain on your resources."</p><p>"I agree" Vernon told him immediately.</p><p>"Point five, the Dursley family as a whole will swear a magical vow via this contract not to tell hint or write to any one about the location of Sirius Orion Black, or any thing overheard by Sirius Orion Black while he is in your home."</p><p>The agree came a little slower and little shakier this time but come it did. "I agree."</p><p>"This is great five points and not a single disagreement." Sirius declared happily. </p><p>"Point six. I want to spend more time with Hadrian in the magical counties and conclaves. So Hadrian will come home every holiday to spend with me. All I need from you for this part is for you to write to Hogwarts administration board request home visitation forms and Fill them out for Hadrian to turn in. I'll pick him up and he'll stay with me you will not actually see him during these times.  Every summer including this one; once the wards have charged  your family will go on vacation somewhere you can say your taking Hadrian with you to anyone who asks but in reality Hadrian and I will be going our separate ways so you will have your family vacation and we will have ours."</p><p>He wasn't unhappy with this request and he and Pet had been wanting to visit Majorca again. He supposed being able to brag about his vacations would do their reputations some good.  They hadn't been able to have a real summer vacation since the freak had started that freaky school, for fear he'd bring home something odd that any potential baby sitter might find.  That and they'd had no way to explain the damn owl.  </p><p>"I agree." Vernon said after a moments pause.  "But I want a guarantee that we won't see him. I want you to promise we'll be safe and healthy. That none of your nonsense will harm any of us or infect our Dudley."</p><p>"Perfectly reasonable requests I agree, I'll even go one further and help Dudley get healthy now.  That way his school nurse wont have anything more to gossip or to complain about when he goes back to school and Dudley will be able to eat all he wants."</p><p>"A vacation every summer will get expensive how do you expect us to pay for it." Petunia asked nasty smirk on her face. </p><p>"I am not going to reward you for being horrible to my nephew." Sirius roared at her.  "You can use the money I know for a fact Dumbledore sends you every month. Money that you have never used on him before."  Sirius took a deep breathe to calm himself down which only partially worked.  "You need to be alive P'tuney." Sirius' voice took a disturbingly childish quality. "Alive doesn't mean intact. I could carve out your eyes, split your tongue so I never have to hear your shrill voice again. YOU can live with out your limbs. You can LIVE while permanently disfigured because some unnamed person probably me took a knife to your plain assed face!" He ended up yelling at her. Petunia burst into sobs. "I'm trying to be reasonable here.  Vernon am I not being reasonable?"</p><p>"You are!" Vernon quickly yelled, while frantically bobbing his head up and down.    </p><p>"You see everything can be worked out if we just keep calm and talk it out." Sirius told them brightly. "Now I'll have final say on all things pertaining to our nephew, and you get to look good because of it."  </p><p>"You two can call your son out from kitchen where he's been listening in and you three can sign the contract full names please, then Hadrian and I will sign it."</p><p>Vernon drug Dudley out from behind the kitchen door and all three of the Dursley's signed the contract it glowed a soft golden color until Hadrian and then Sirius had signed it too, when it flashed white and then stopped.  It looked like any other piece of paper after that. Sirius rolled it up, snapped his fingers, and Harry watched in awe as the document, table, and fountain pen all disappeared as easily and quietly as they'd come. </p><p>"Come along Harry, We've work to do up stairs then." Sirius told him happily. </p><p>Harry watched as Padfoot grabbed up Harry's trunk and began whistling as he made his way up to the attic.  Sirius paused at the top of the stairs and waved his hand negligently toward the downstairs hall table where the telephone sat.  "Your phone should work again"  He turned to Harry gave a wink and whispered. "because I never did anything to it to begin with. Wouldn't know how to if I'd wanted so I just bluffed."</p><p> </p><p>0o0o0o0o0o0o0</p><p> </p><p>The attic could only be accessed as far as Harry knew by pulling down a rickety old ladder from the ceiling at the end of the hallway there was nothing else down that way but a linen closet that aunt Petunia used to store cleaning supplies in but hadn't bothered using since she'd moved Harry out from under the stairs. Sure enough Sirius who was quite tall already had to jump to grab the chain attached to the attic ladder, which came down with a clang and a clatter that made Harry feel sure the whole lot of it was about to fall apart. </p><p>The attic itself was filled to the brim with boxes and trunks and bags that had been piled up everywhere. "Some of this stuff is rightfully yours you know." Sirius told him looking around "It's from your grandparents house and should have gone to your mother."  </p><p>Sirius took a deep breathe and told Harry "Your mum and dad were already in hiding so your aunt tried to have the will contested claimed it was an old will and should have all gone to her.  Only thing was your grandparents had made changes to the will and refiled just a month before they died. So that sort of blew up in Petunia's face." </p><p>"Your mum found out about two weeks before she died, she snuck out to her childhood home and made a few changes. When your mum died Petunia tried to claim it all any way and then found your mom had charmed all the boxes against Petunia opening them." Sirius laughed "Guess the cold hearted shrew never realized that all she had to do was let someone else sort through it all! You won't have to worry though Harry part of the contract I conveniently forgot to go through had her relinquish all claims to your mums inheritance."</p><p>"Sirius?" Harry asked unsurely. "If we can't use magic is it not going to take a long time to clear all this away?"  </p><p>Sirius smiled and gave his godson a wink. "One the actual contract only said you and I wouldn't use magic down stairs without reason. I'm also setting up some wards up here that will stop our using magic from being detected. Two we never promised not to have the house elves use magic."  </p><p>"But the ministry can detect house elf magic and I'll get in trouble!" Harry exclaimed. </p><p>"No you won't. A house elf can mimic their masters magical signature and I suppose if that master was under age and in a muggle neighbor hood they might get in trouble, for the most part house elf magic is untraceable." Sirius frowned as he lectured. "Why did you think that anyway?"</p><p>So Harry told his godfather all about Dobby, and that led to his second year which led to Sirius gathering Harry up in arms and promising to wrap him silk lined dragon hide and to never let him out of his sight again. </p><p>0o0o0o0o0o0o0</p><p> </p><p>The house elves set up a small wizard tent, while they talked, for them to use tonight. Dinner was delivered to the tents living room. The elves cleared their plates when they were done and left them to their discussions. The elves organized themselves made a schedule and got to work cleaning and sorting they didn't open the boxes belonging to Harry just set them aside for later. They did open all the others, the old toys, and children's clothes were repaired, cleaned, and dropped off at a local orphanage. </p><p>Soon most of the Dursley's old stuff had been gifted to charities all that was left was seasonal decorations and the unfished side of the attic had been repaired, and only needed flooring. They moved the ward stones and the wood Sirius and Belvina had gathered, shaped and put into bundles the other day to the unfinished side for Master Black to work with in the morning.</p><p>They had finished earlier than anticipated what with ten of them working together so they'd also cleaned the house until it was sparkling, mowed the lawn, weeded the garden and washed the car and the outside of the house. They got some rest and then started on a breakfast consisting of a large amount of fruits and yogurt and one scotched egg a piece with toast and marmalade.</p><p>One large pile was set up downstairs for the muggles with a potion in the form of a very healthy green shake from Belvina for Dudley to help turn his fat to nutrients his body could process. The smaller pile was set up in the living room of the tent for their Masters. This one had no special potions yet but they knew that could change. </p><p>When Sirius finished breakfast the first thing he did was move the boards for the walls and began to separate the attic space into different rooms. He laid down the ward stones were he needed them than moved the pile of boards meant for the flooring; positioning them in pattern he wanted the new flooring to be and used a spell to put them in place. He soon had four distinct rooms in place.  </p><p>The largest room was set off to the left side and shelving was added to store all of the Dursley's left over junk. A sliding barn door separated it from the rooms Harry and Sirius would be using.  The room the stairs came up in he set up as a den. He banished the rickety stairs and the hatch door it was attached to. For now at least that meant their was just a giant hole in the floor.  </p><p>The house used to have a fire place the Dursley's had stopped using and boarded up so Sirius just sent cleaning charms up and down the chimney, sent a muffling charm down the shaft and summoned up all the brick which he than used to build a large fireplace for Harry's use. He turned the bricks color varying shades of off white and had fun planting the occasional dark grey brick into the mix. </p><p>The second room he did was a study/owlrey this room had a small circular window set into it that Sirius enchanted to open and close for mail owls and set up Hedwig's new much more elaborate stand and cage nearby. He placed the boxes from Lily's family in the corner there and placed a large desk they could use for lessons and to sort it all so it could be either used put away until Harry was older or given away or junked depending on what it all was.</p><p>The last room Sirius turned into a large luxurious bedroom the bed itself was large enough to fit several people an ornate wardrobe sat beside it. Bookshelves were put up and all the books the house elves had found either in storage in Harry's old room and in his trunk were placed on them. </p><p>One of the broken racing bikes which had been repaired and had its coloring changed was hung on the wall for Harry to use later as he wished. His racing broom was hung up on the other side. With several red and gold banners proclaiming Harry's house with a purple outlined Hogwarts school emblem in the middle of them. </p><p>A fixed up fish tank was set up to the side and Sirius sent the house elves shopping to purchase some exotic magical fish, their food, preferred water, and some neat decorations for it. The had also saved and repaired several board games that were stored on the shelves. Sirius sent them for some of the things he knew were in his and Regulus's old rooms like the floor length enchanted mirror, some wizarding children's books, and board games, a wizarding wireless Network Radio, and a full set wizard's primer used by parents and home tutors to teach pure-blooded kids before Hogwarts. Sirius made sure the primers were clear and fresh and set them on the desk for Harry to start using today.  </p><p> The House elves delivered to him a load of scrape metal he'd rescued from the junk yard and cleaned up. Sirius walked over towards the hole in the floor where the old stairs and door used to be and pointed his wand at the metal. It began to twist and melt together. Writhing around until it began to take a spiral shape. Sirius gently lowered it to the floor and stuck into place on both ends. He then sent shined up darks stained boards to fit themselves on top of the metal so you were walking on wood not the metal part. He then added some railing around the attic floor so no one would accidently fall down the stairs. </p><p> This morning Sirius had given Harry an adventure book, the first part of a series James Potter had once adored and told him to read out loud and not to leave the tent. He wanted the changes in the attic to be a surprise for him. Now, Harry stared in awe at his new rooms. It was amazing, awesome, phenomenal, he couldn't find the right words if he tried. He had his own bike! There were clothes in a new wardrobe that; while still hand me downs from Dudley, looked brand new, fit, and Sirius said they would be going shopping for more once Harry had been looked over by Belvina, who, it turned out was a distant relative of Sirius's that he trusted and wasn't a criminal and so could be seen with Harry and padfoot. A dog couldn't take a boy shopping after all. </p><p> </p><p>0o0o0o0o0o0o0</p><p> </p><p>They had started early and so the Dursley family were just setting down to breakfast when Sirius and Harry came down.  </p><p>"I had forgot to tell you my dearest lady Belvina Black will be coming by today." Sirius announced "She's traveling by car and is not wanted for any crimes so she shouldn't set any of your neighbors talking, but if that squib from down the street asks tell her she's a distant cousin of yours that came here to reconnect with the family"</p><p>"Squib?" Vernon asked</p><p>"A person born to a magical family, but whom cannot actively use magic themselves. Sort of like Petunia's sister in reverse." Sirius told him. "The one I think Dumbledore had spying on you has a small army of cats around her."</p><p>"What's this?" Dudley face scrunched up as he whined. "And Why won't the lid come off my plate?" </p><p>"That herbal medicine is part of my deal with your parents." Sirius told him. "It's all natural and will slowly start to turn your fat into nutrients good for your growing body, or baring that, bits your body can pass out of it's system. I suspect you will be allowed to eat only after you drink your shake!"</p><p>"Dudley darling just think!" Petunia said quickly "With this you can eat all the sweets and cakes you want without worrying about that stupid diet!"</p><p>"oh." Dudley made a face gagging a little as he downed the shake, before quickly removing the lid from his food and shoveling everything could reach into his mouth not even slowing down to notice it was all healthy.  Eventually he came to his scotched egg and took the time to gather some toast to place under it as he ate. </p><p>Vernon grumbled about the lack of things he would have preferred to eat but noted it was an improvement over Dudley's diet. Vernon clearly didn't want Sirius mad at him and he wasn't about to do anything that might set Black off.</p><p>0o0o0o0o0o0o0</p><p>Belvina had never driven a car nor really wanted too before Sirius had come barreling into her life. Learning had been a true pain anyway and not just the driving part or lessons but the getting a car bit. They had to take great care to not arouse suspicion from the Auror office or anyone else and withdrawing then converting the amount of money needed to buy a muggle car would draw attention they couldn't afford. </p><p>So they'd gone traipsing through muggle garbage heaps for what they needed. An old classic that people wouldn't wonder why they were still driving it let alone keeping it in good shape. A positively ancient Rolls Royce someone had long ago crashed; had been pulled out and Sirius had quickly begun repairing everything broken and restoring it to it's former glory.  </p><p>They'd then modified and charmed all the bits that belonged to its underneath. If anyone went looking it would appear normal. However, the seats were very comfortable, and their car would never need petrol. It would also very easily be able to navigate traffic and most forms of law enforcement would find it hard to spot. They would therefore never need to give the driver a ticket or run the license plate through their records.  </p><p>Which was very good because while she had learned to drive she had also learned that she hated it. So they'd taught one of the house elves to do it for her. Putting strange looking stilts on its feet so it could reach the petals while it sat on a booster seat. A glamour and a few charms and any passing motorist would see a perfectly normal looking man with forgettable features as her chauffer. </p><p>Sirius did have a muggle bank account that was good and had several thousand pounds in it, in addition to several stashes of money and items he'd made during the war for emergencies. They would use it for clothes for herself, Sirius and most importantly Harry. She had gone shopping with Sirius in muggle London a few days before to gather a handful of fancy outfits for herself. So when she met Harry, and his relatives, she would look the part. </p><p>They had also raided 12 Grimauld Place for his mothers gaudiest and chunkiest jewelry sets. They systematically dismantled them and melted the gold into ingots. Most of the jewels were sold loose as were the ingots. The rest she remade into elegant bits that the muggles would appreciate. After all why bother to buy muggle jewelry when she could just make it herself from what she already had.</p><p>Belvina stepped out of the car on Private Drive observing the identical rows of houses, all neatly numbered. Their lawns all trimmed the same length, flower beds in full bloom. New cars parked in the driveways, all similar models in similar colors, of white, gray, and tan. It was disgusting. Belvina suddenly had the strangest urge to pull out her wand and start shooting color changing charms in various random directions. She shuddered violently and made her way quickly up to number four; where she rang the bell.</p><p>Mrs. Dursley answered the door and had to gape. The woman before her was wearing a black designer skirt suit with pink edging soft pink eight inch Jimmy Choo pumps, a pink Lois Vuitton shoulder bag, and designer sunglasses. The sun glinted off her gold chocker it's beautiful ruby glinted merrily. Her black hair was perfectly coiffed and her eyes a strange violet, Petunia noted faintly, as her pale pink lips stretched into a false smile.  </p><p>Petunia had never owned an outfit that expensive and she had wanted to so badly it burned. She had grown up poor and married up into middle class. Vernon and she had worked hard to gain both wealth and in their neighbor hood at least a certain degree of prestige. A part of her though she feared would always be that little nothing of a girl who'd been so envious of others wealth. </p><p>"Hello, Mrs. Dursley I presume?" The stranger stated with an upper crust accent "I'm Belvina Black I do believe you should be expecting me?" </p><p>"Yes, of course." Petunia said mechanically "come in, he's waiting for you upstairs." and because her pride wouldn't let her say musty attic she added  "Third floor." as if it had always been as such. Petunia watched as the woman disappeared up the stairs, her husband and son gaping as they too allowed their eyes to follow her as she went her hips swinging and emphasizing her perfect hourglass figure. Petunia hated her, she decided, as much if not more than she'd hated her perfect, pretty freak of sister. </p><p>0o0o0o0o0o0o0</p><p>"You must be Hadrian." Belvina noted as Harry stared at her open mouthed. </p><p>"But, your pretty!" Harry exclaimed. Belvina laughed. </p><p>"Made me sound like some ancient ole maid did he?" She asked gesturing towards Sirius who was leaning against the wall and grinning madly. </p><p>Harry blushed. "Yes, well no not exactly." Harry rushed to explain "He was talking about all your masteries and how smart you are!" Harry gulped and rambled on. "The only people I know with that many masteries are my professors and they're all old and wrinkly, or mean and greasy like Snape."  </p><p>Belvina laughed again. She smiled kindly at Harry and gestured for him to sit beside her. "Well Harry, Sirius told me you were a bit under weight. We also had some concern about your scar." She began gently.</p><p>"When Hagrid took you from Godrics Hollow he gave me the impression that you would be seeing a healer. However it appears that they were so concerned with getting you to a location safe from Death Eaters that they neglected your health other wise." Sirius told him. "We just want to make sure that you really are okay."</p><p>"I want you to lay back on the couch and I'm going to run some scans over your body using crystals." Belvina told him. "This method will tell me more about your body magic and soul than any other way."  Belvina grimaced "Healers don't usually use this method because of all the useless information it brings up as well." She opened her purse began moving out way more than she should have been able to fit. "But in this case your scar is so old and with no previous scans to consult it's the best way to determine what it really is and if anything was left behind that might be negatively affecting your health or environment." </p><p>Harry laid down so she could get started. In the mean time he told them about his parseltongue ability and where Dumbledore guessed it had come from. Belvina sighed. "Silly old men." She continued.  "Parseltongue is a hereditary gift one of your parents must have been able to speak it and the other had to be a carrier at least." Belvina sighed again. "We can probably figure out which was which if we investigate a little." She told him. </p><p>"Your mother grew up in a muggle city not a lot of snakes there unless she visited the zoo, she wouldn't have known until she was older and encountered the magical kind at Hogwarts by then she might have known better than to talk about having parseltongue or just not known it was important. Your father on the other hand grew up at Potter manner and it's gardens would have been warded against anything dangerous like most snakes. If your father's family spoke it they would have known to keep it quiet and would have emphasized that to James growing up. Our best bet is to simply ask your Aunt Petunia and if she doesn't know we can scan her and see if she has the latent ability. If your mother could speak it than Petunia has to be a carrier at least."</p><p>She hummed and asked him who had gone over personal hygiene with him and if he'd had the talk his body was a few months away from officially hitting puberty, it'd happen sooner once he finished the potions regime she was going to recommend him. </p><p>Harry told them no one had and what he knew about cleanliness came from the boys in his dorm. Sirius and Belvina than talked to him about the importance about good hygiene, different types of shampoo, conditioner and soaps, their uses and what might works best for Harry. They then to Harry's absolute horror gave him 'the talk'.  </p><p>Belvina told him the medical terms for his changing body the how's and why's. Sirius concentrated on how it would effect him personally. Sirius covered gender identities and sexual preferences. He had just started on common kinks, when Belvina announced she'd finished the scan and wanted to talk about what she found in his scar. To Harry's immense relief. </p><p>Their was some nasty residue in Harry's scar it was also partially active and transmitting some of Harry's magical energy to the originator, in this case Voldemort the creepy wraith. The good news is it's not attached to Harry in any permanent way. It also meant the thing was taking up physical space inside Harry and affecting his ability to think. He also had a baby block on his magic no one had thought to remove. A few extra strong cleansing rituals would do the trick, which fortunately they already had experience in. </p><p>He was going to need to go through a flush though because he had basilisk venom and phoenix tears in his blood stream still that had settled in after his shoddy medical treatment post chamber incident. They'd do the flush first, it shouldn't take more than a day. Then over the next week they'd do the rituals for ridding him of dark and foreign residue.  </p><p>Once that was done He could begin taking potions to increase his appetite one every morning when he wakes up and then nutrient boosters before every lunch and dinner. They'd fix his body of the slight malnutrition he was suffering in two weeks tops at which point he was due another growth spurt. They would buy his new clothes then they decided since their was no point in buying new clothes when he'd outgrow them before he even had time to wear most of them.</p><p>Their was a potion Belvina had made to cure her own bad eyesight and she thought she could adjust it to help Harry but she wanted him and Sirius to think it over first since their was a slight chance it could make his eyes worse instead. Harry was all for it arguing that his eyes couldn't possibly get much worse. Sirius wasn't so sure and said he'd need time to think it over.  They had a light lunch and Belvina asked Harry what he wanted to do that day since they wouldn't start the flush until that night. He probably would be cooped up while that happened and she suggested he enjoy some sunshine while he still could.  </p><p>Harry was reluctant to leave them though but when Sirius guess his problem a solution was quickly reached. Sirius transformed into Padfoot, Belvina put a leash on him, Harry grabbed his new racing bike and they all walked to the park. As it turned out Harry had never been taught to ride a bike so Belvina taught him while Padfoot barked encouragement and chased after him. Harry couldn’t remember ever having a better day. He knew what his new patronus memory would be, and wondered if his mother had lived if she would be a little like Belvina.</p>
