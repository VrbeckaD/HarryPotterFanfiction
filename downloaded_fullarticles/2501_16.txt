    <p align="justify"> </p><p>The Doctor pushed his way out of the TARDIS, smelling the air, he murmured, “America, New York, I’m gonna call it, 1920s.”He pushed his way out onto the street. Noticing a large group of people gathered at the bottom of the bank stairs, he moved closer so he could hear.</p><p align="justify">“This great city sparkles with the jewels of man’s invention! Movie theaters, automobiles, the wireless, electric lights – all dazzle and bewitch us!” The woman who stood on the stairs above them cried out, “But where there is light, there is shadow, friend. Something is stalking our city, wreaking destruction and then Disappearing without a trace…”</p><p align="justify">The Doctor furrowed his eyebrows, this was why the TARDIS took him here. A man tripped over another man’s case as he attempted to get to the bank.</p><p align="justify">“I’m so sorry – my case –” the man with the case apologized, he was British, an oddity in New York.</p><p align="justify">“No harm done.” The man who had tripped hurried past the crowd and into the bank.</p><p align="justify">“You, friend!” The woman pointed at the man with the case, “What drew you to our meeting today?”</p><p align="justify">“Oh…” the man seemed startled to find himself at the center of attention, “I was just – passing…”</p><p align="justify">“Are you a seeker? A seeker after truth?” The woman asked, clearly trying to pull him further into her cause. The man hesitated.</p><p align="justify">“I’m more of a chaser, really.” The Doctor smirked, a Quidditch joke, this man was a wizard.</p><p align="justify">The woman seemed confused, but chose to address the crowd. “Hear my words and head my warning, and laugh if you dare: <em> Witches live among us!” </em>The three children she was with began handing out leaflets. “We have to fight together, for the sake of our children – for the sake of tomorrow!” She turned to the man with the case, “What do you say to that, friend?”</p><p align="justify">Suddenly, the Doctor saw something move out of the corner of his eye. He turned to find a small, furry black animal, looking not unlike a cross between a mole and a duck-billed platypus, a Niffler. He was sitting on the steps of the bank, hastily stashing a beggar's hat full of money into his pouch.</p><p align="justify">Both he and the wizard pushed their way past the crowd, the wizard murmuring, “Excuse me,” as he left.</p><p align="justify">The Doctor and the wizard pushed their way into the elaborate bank, “You gotta keep a closer eye on your niffler.” The Doctor murmured, scanning the room, the man seemed to jump, but a soft smile appeared on his lips.</p><p align="justify">“Newt Scamander, you?”</p><p align="justify">“I’m the Doctor.”</p><p align="justify">“Pleasure.”</p><p align="justify">“Can I help you, gentlemen?” A bank employee said, making his way towards them,</p><p align="justify">“No, no, just inspection.” The Doctor said, flashing his psychic paper, “We’ll be out of your way in just a moment.”</p><p align="justify">“Of course, sirs. Thank you.” The man said, “You may wait there for the manager to arrive and show you around.”</p><p align="justify">“Brilliant.” The Doctor said, pulling Newt over to the bench the man had motioned to. “Right, now your niffler is going to try to find the place with the most gold possible, which’ll be the vaults. So we just need to get down there –”</p><p align="justify">“Hi, what brings you here?” The Doctor and Newt turned to see the Muggle man who had tripped over Newt’s case earlier.</p><p align="justify">“Oh, same as you.” Newt said uncomfortably, trying to spot the Niffler.</p><p align="justify">“You’re here to get a loan to open up a bakery?” The man asked, the Doctor too preoccupied to answer, and Newt too preoccupied to listen just said, “Yes.”</p><p align="justify">“What are the odds of that?” The muggle murmured, “Well, may the best man win, I guess.”</p><p align="justify">“The Doctor spotted the niffler and darted away, Newt on his heels with a polite, “Excuse me.”</p><p align="justify">“Come on, we’ll go to the vaults and try to meet him there.” The Doctor said, as he and Newt began to make their way across the bank. Just as they were about to descend the stairs, the Doctor and Newt heard a voice, “Hey, English guys! I think your egg is hatching!” The Doctor and Newt spun around to see the Muggle man from before holding an Occamy egg that was beginning to crack.</p><p align="justify">“What else have you got in that case?” The Doctor asked, as Newt made the split-second decision of pulling out his wand and summoning the man and the egg towards them, and the three of them Disapperated.</p><p align="justify">The Doctor, Newt, and the Muggle Apparated into a hallway. Newt gripped his wand in his mouth as he cupped the Occamy egg delicately. The Muggle man stared at the Doctor, then at Newt, then at the egg. He looked from his feat to the place they were standing moments earlier.</p><p align="justify">“Oh, he is beautiful…” The Doctor marveled, looking at Newt, whose face was full of affection and wonder.</p><p align="justify">“Come on.” Newt whispered, and he and the Doctor began to descend, leaving a very confused Muggle following behind.</p><p align="justify">“But what? I was – I was over here. I was – I was over there?”</p><p align="justify">“Newt lay his case on the ground, opening it up. “In you hop.” He said as he placed the Occamy into the case.</p><p align="justify">“Bigger on the inside. Not to perfection I might add…” The Doctor murmured, “Undetectable extension charm? Not the most ideal, but not bad.”</p><p align="justify">“You say that like there’s a better way.” Newt laughed slightly, before continuing to mutter to his case, “Come on, settle down. Dougal, don’t make me come down there.”</p><p align="justify">The case was snapped shut as the Doctor and Newt spotted the Niffler squeezing his way into a vault.</p><p align="justify"><em>“Alohomora. </em>” Newt said, unlocking the vault. The Doctor turned to address the footsteps heard behind them.</p><p align="justify">“Oh, so you’re gonna <em> steal </em> the money, huh?” a bank employee looked at the Muggle,</p><p align="justify">The Doctor whipped out his own wand. It was quite a work, Ollivander's, Maplewood, Phoenix core, ten inches, flexible, but firm.</p><p align="justify"><em>“Petrificus Totalus.” </em> The man stiffened and fell back, flat on the ground, “ <em> Obliviate.” </em> The Doctor murmured, erasing all memories of magic from the man’s head.</p><p align="justify">“Mr. Bingley!” the Muggle cried out.</p><p align="justify">The Doctor followed Newt into the vault where he had just finished retrieving all the gold from the Niffler’s pouch.</p><p align="justify">“What’s going on down there?” A voice from upstairs called out. Clearly they had made a ruckus.</p><p align="justify">The Doctor seized Newt and the Muggle and Apparated them outside on a side street.</p><p align="justify">“For the last time you pilfering pest,” Newt said, closing the case with the Niffler safely inside, “Paws off what doesn’t belong to you!” He turned back to the Muggle, “I’m awfully sorry about all that –”</p><p align="justify">“What the <em>hell</em> was that?” The Muggle demanded.</p><p align="justify">“Nothing that need concern you.” Newt said, “Now, unfortunately, you’ve seen far too much, so if you wouldn’t mind – if you just stand there – this will be over in a jiffy.” Newt stood, wand extended,</p><p align="justify">“Newt,” The Doctor said, not wanting to Obliviate the poor man.</p><p align="justify">Suddenly, the man seized the cases (Both Newt’s and his own), and hit both the Doctor and Newt over the head with them, dropping one and running for the busy streets.</p><p align="justify">The Doctor hit the ground painfully, but pushed himself back up, then helped Newt up.</p><p align="justify">A woman began swiftly and casually walking down the side street, the Doctor smirked at her, “You know, you don’t have to stalk people. You could’ve just asked.” The woman froze.</p><p align="justify">“What – I –”</p><p align="justify">“You know, for such a super secret spy, you’re a terrible liar.”</p><p align="justify">The woman grabbed the Doctor and Newt roughly and swiftly Disapparated them.</p><p align="justify">“Who are you?” The woman demanded.</p><p align="justify">“I’m the Doctor, and this, here, is Newt.” The Doctor smiled,  “And you are?”</p><p align="justify">“Full names.”</p><p align="justify">“The Doctor, Newt Scamander.”</p><p align="justify">“What’s your real name, Doctor?”</p><p align="justify">“Just, the Doctor.”</p><p align="justify">“Doctor is not a name!”</p><p align="justify">“John Smith, then.” The woman gave a curt nod then looked at Newt.</p><p align="justify">“What’s that thing in your case?” The Doctor exchanged a look with Newt, who pulled his case a little closer to him.</p><p align="justify">“That’s a Niffler.” The Doctor responded for him.</p><p align="justify">“Sorry,” Newt said awkwardly, “Er, you’ve got something on your –” he moved his finger to point out the mustard still on the woman’s lip, but she moved away.</p><p align="justify">“Why in the name of Deliverance Dane did you let that thing loose?”</p><p align="justify">“I didn’t mean to,” Newt said, “He’s incorrigible, you see, anything shiny, he’s all over the place –”</p><p align="justify">“You didn’t mean to?” Tina said anger in her voice, but it was laced with the slightest foundation of fear.</p><p align="justify">“No.” Newt answered.</p><p align="justify">“You could not have chosen a worse time to let that creature loose! We’re in the middle of a situation here! I’m taking the two of you in.”</p><p align="justify">“Why is it such a bad time?” The Doctor asked, “What’s going on?”</p><p align="justify">“And where are you taking us?” Newt inquired.</p><p align="justify">The woman produced a badge from her pocket. Her name was Porpentina Goldstein and the ID card was from the Magical Congress of the United States of America, or MACUSA.</p><p align="justify">“Oh, brilliant.” The Doctor grinned, “This must be where all the action happens. Brilliant, take us there.”</p><p align="justify">Newt eyed the Doctor, clearly beginning to have the slight suspicion of madness.</p><p align="justify">“So,” He said to Porpentina, “You work for MACUSA? What are you, some kind of investigator.”</p><p align="justify">Porpentina hesitated, then nodded, as though she were much more confident than she evidently was. It was a half-truth.</p><p align="justify">“At least tell me you took care of the No-Maj?”</p><p align="justify">The Doctor and Newt both raised an eyebrow, “What?”</p><p align="justify">“The No-Maj! No-Magic – the non-wizard!”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, sorry, we call them Muggles.” Newt said.</p><p align="justify">“You wiped his memory, right?” Porpentina asked, “The No-Maj with the case?”</p><p align="justify">“Um –”</p><p align="justify">“That’s a Section 3A, Mr. Scamander, Mr. Smith, I’m taking you in.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, brilliant.” The Doctor smiled as Porpentina grabbed him and Newt by the arm and they Disapparated again.</p>
