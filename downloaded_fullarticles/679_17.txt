    <p>As Harry stepped through the barrier he looked down at the letter clutched in his hand, and let out a silent prayer to whoever the mysterious Professor Snape was, for sending him it. A few days before, he had come to the realisation that though Hagrid had been a great guide and introduction to the wizarding world, he had left out allot of things. Primarily, how to find and get onto the magical platform, and train, that world take him to his new school. Luckily, the day before he was to leave for said new school, an owl had arrived at the Leaky Cauldron, carrying a letter for him. It had explained that after talking to Hagrid, the sender had found that the lovable giant had forgotten to explain how to get onto platform 9 3/4. The writer had then taken the time to explain in detail how to board, and then personally apologised for the giant's mistake. </p><p> </p><p>Now that he was on the platform, Harry began to search for the bright pink hair that the professor had told him to look for. Catching a brief glint of pink through the heavy crowds, Harry made his way towards it, glad that the people around him preferred to move out the way, instead of getting a trolley to the shin. As he broke through the crowds, he found himself at the back of the train, face to face with possibly the most beautiful young woman he had ever seen. Looking up to the top of her head, he found that the pink hair belonged to her. He also noticed that perched on her left breast (which was quite full and round) was a small badge that read 'Prefect'.</p><p> </p><p>The older girl was about a head taller than him, and he guessed she was likely in her 6th or 7th year at the school. As she looked down at him, a large friendly smile spread across her face. Taking a step towards him, she held out her hand for him to shake, which he did.</p><p> </p><p>"Wotcher! You must be Harry. Uncle Sevy told me you may need some help, was he right"?</p><p> </p><p>"Umm, maybe? I'm guessing this 'Uncle Sevy' is the Professor Snape that sent me the letter"? he said, holding up he folded paper.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah that's him. He floo'd my mum last night, asking if I could meet you hear and help you get situated. I'm guessing you're Muggle born"?</p><p> </p><p>"I don't think so", Harry said, wracking his brain for what Hagrid called him the other day. "I think I'm a Half Blood. But I was raised Muggle by my Muggle relatives. At least that's what Hagrid said".</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, okay. Speaking of the big doofus. Uncle Sevy asked me to apologise in person for Hagrid's forgetfulness".</p><p> </p><p>"That's alright. He did seem to have allot on his mind", Harry said, shrugging his shoulders. "Anyway. Do I just get on or what"?</p><p> </p><p>"Oh yeah, sorry. Yep, just get on the train, find a compartment with space, and get comfy. There is space underneath and above your compartment's seats where you can put your trunk and other stuff. Though I'd recommend under, as above may be too high for you to reach without a charm. Though if you ask a certain gorgeous prefect to help, I'm sure she wouldn't mind using a charm to help levitate it up", the last part was said with a a raise of a brow, an upturn of the lips, and a cock of a hip, which altogether caused Harry to blush profusely and stammer out that he could manage.</p><p> </p><p>Laughing to herself, the girl put a calming hand on Harry's shoulder and lightly pushed him towards the train. "I'd come with and help you find a compartment, but as a prefect I need to help out out here. Though I'll make sure to come and see how you're getting on when everyone else is in their compartments".</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled and waved to her as he pulled his trunk onto the train. Before she could turn around and walk, he called out.</p><p> </p><p>"Wait, I never got your name".</p><p> </p><p>"Smacking herself in the forehead, she rolled her eyes and sighed dramatically, "sorry, must have been around Hagrid too much. My names Tonks, but you can call me Dora if you want", the last was said with a wink, as she spun on her heel and stalked off down the platform with a sway of the hips.</p><p> </p><p>Harry blushed again, before snorting at her antics and walking off down the train, pulling his trunk behind him.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>As Harry settled down in his previously empty compartment, having slid his trunk under the bench, and let Hedwig out of her cage to go and perch on the luggage space above, a slight knock came from the compartment door. Pulling the string on the window shades so he could see who it was, Harry then pulled the door open to let in a girl who looked about his own age.</p><p> </p><p>"Hello", she said. smiling slightly. "Is it alright if I sit in here with you? I have already tried several other compartments, but the other children in them just sneered at me and told me to 'go away'. Though in less polite terms".</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned at hearing this, he looked her up and down and realisation dawned. "Let me guess, are you Muggle born"?</p><p> </p><p>The girl stiffened and began to slowly edge back out the compartment.</p><p> </p><p>Holding up his hands in a placating manner, Harry spoke gently. "Whoa, don't worry, I'm not like all those others. I'm only a Half blood myself, my mum was Muggle born. I suppose someone told you to watch out for some of the more vocal Pure bloods"?</p><p> </p><p>The girl's features seemed to soften slightly, before she smiled demurely and stepped back into the compartment, closing the door behind her. "Yeah, the witch that came to my house to explain things to me and my parents said pretty much the same".</p><p> </p><p>"You had a witch come to your house"?</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, she works at Hogwarts, Deputy Headmistress McGonagall".</p><p> </p><p>"Oh yeah, Hagrid told me about her". By this time they were both sat opposite each other.</p><p> </p><p>"Who's Hagrid"?</p><p> </p><p>"He's the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. Though I think that's just a fancy way of saying he looks after the land".</p><p> </p><p>This last proclamation caused the girl to laugh, covering her mouth with a hand.</p><p> </p><p>"She suddenly perked up and put out a hand to Harry. "I just remembered, I'm Hermione by the way, Hermione Granger".</p><p> </p><p>Harry took the offered hand and shook it lightly. "Harry Evans".</p><p> </p><p>Hermione blanched, her eyes going wide. "<em>The </em>Harry Evans? Your mum being <em>Lily Evans</em>? The-Witch-Who-Stood?</p><p> </p><p>This time Harry was the one that blanched. "The-Witch-Who-Stood? I've been called The-Boy-Who-Lived, but I didn't know my mum had a title".</p><p> </p><p>"Well of course she does", Hermione said, practically gushing at this point. "You might have been the one to kill Voldemort, but your mum was the one to stand up to him, to put herself between you and him. It's said that he offered to spare her if she stepped aside, but she refused. It's also rumoured that with her death, she placed a protection charm on you, which was actually what killed Voldemort".</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled. He was beginning to get annoyed with all the attention he was given in Diagon Alley for supposedly killing Voldemort, even though it was much more likely his mother had been the one to do it. Finally hearing his mum get recognition for her heroism brought him deep joy, and he realised in that moment, that no matter what, he'd owe Hermione Granger for life, for what she was saying about his mum.</p><p> </p><p>"I take it she's a hero to you"?</p><p> </p><p>"Of course!" Hermione exclaimed, "a Muggle born witch that was known to be the greatest witch of her time. As well as standing up to the most powerful dark wizard in a thousand years. Refusing to step aside due to nothing but pure love for her son? I wish to be half the witch she was when I'm her age".</p><p> </p><p>Finally taking a breath, Hermione looked into Harry's face and noticed tears in his eyes. "Oh Harry, I'm so sorry", she said, crossing to his bench and placing an arm across his shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>"It's alright", he managed. "Thank you".</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>Half an hour later, the two of them were brought out of their conversation about what magical books they had read, by the train pulling forward, finally leaving the station.</p><p> </p><p>"I can't wait to get there", said Hermione, practically bouncing in her seat with excitement.</p><p> </p><p>Harry chuckled at his new friends childlike exuberance, "neither can I".</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, their attention was drawn to the door, as a knock rapped on the window.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked through the window to see two girls stood there, peering in. Looking over at Hermione, he raised an eyebrow in question, getting a shrug in return. Turning back to the door, he waved his hand at the two girls, signalling for them to enter. As they pushed the door open and came in, Hermione slid across the compartment to sit next to Harry, leaving space for the two new girls to sit together.</p><p> </p><p>The first girl to enter was slightly taller than the other. She had long thick auburn hair in complicated braids reaching her bottom. Harry observed that she was also quite pudgy, but he would definitely not call her fat. He could tell that with time, the pudge would fill out and turn into beautiful womanly curves. She had large hazel coloured eyes, and her pale face was covered in freckles. He also noticed that even though she was likely a first year like himself and Hermione, she had already begun to sprout quite prominent breasts, which caused him to blush slightly.</p><p> </p><p>The second girl to enter only came up to the first's shoulder. She was also much slimmer, giving proof to her young age. She had straw blonde hair in two pigtails which reached her shoulders. Her eyes were a deep blue and sharp, she had a slight upturned nose, as well as a sharp jawline and cheekbones. Harry could only describe her looks as elfish, but also cute.</p><p> </p><p>The red head had a broad smile as she entered, causing both Harry and Hermione to also smile. "Thank you for letting us in, the other cariages are becoming quite crowded and we didn't want to bother the prefects in asking them to add another one".</p><p> </p><p>"That's alright", said Hermione. "The more the merrier".</p><p> </p><p>This caused the other two girls to giggle and Harry to laugh.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm Susan by the way", spoke up the read head. "And this is my best friend, Hannah Abbott".</p><p> </p><p>Hannah smiled shyly and gave a small wave as she sat down next to Susan.</p><p> </p><p>"Hello, my name is Hermione Granger, and this is Harry Evans".</p><p> </p><p>Hannah stilled in shock, her jaw hanging open. Susan managed better, her eyes widened slightly before she blinked the shock away, elbowing Hannah in the side. "Well, it's nice to meet you. Hermione, I'm afraid I don't recognise your surname. I'm guessing you're Muggle born"?</p><p> </p><p>Hermione again froze, but Susan's bright, warm smile managed to stop the worry from creeping in, showing that she was merely curious. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, my parents are both Muggle dentists".</p><p> </p><p>Hannah's eyebrow rose, "what's a dentist"?</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled at the obviously Pure blood's non-existent knowledge on Muggle things. "A dentist is kind of like a doctor for teeth".</p><p> </p><p>This just caused Hannah to look even more confused. "What's a doctor"?</p><p> </p><p>Susan snorted before elbowing Hannah again, "Han, a doctor is the Muggle term for a healer or mediwizard".</p><p> </p><p>"Ooohh. Okay".</p><p> </p><p>This caused the other three to burst out laughing.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>"So what Houses do you guys think you'll be in"? asked Susan, opening another chocolate frog. "I know I'll probably be in Hufflepuff, my whole family has been for generations. Except for a few distant aunts and uncles".</p><p> </p><p>"I'm likely the same", said Hannah, who was munching on some Bertie Botts every flavour beans.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm probably going to be Ravenclaw", said Hermione, "though I hope to be in Gryffindor, like Professor McGonagall, I really liked her when she came to see me".</p><p> </p><p>"Same with Hermione", said Harry. "Though I hope to be in Gryffindor, like my mum".</p><p> </p><p>"Auntie Amelia says that we don't get to choose our own house, unless we are eligible for more than one, then we can choose".</p><p> </p><p>"Did your aunt say how it's decided"? Asked Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>"Not really. Though she did say that it depends on our personalities, she's supper hardworking and all about being part of a team, so she was a obvious Hufflepuff. You're super smart Hermione, so as you say, you'll probably be Ravenclaw".</p><p> </p><p>They were all brought out of their conversation by a disembodied voice;</p><p> </p><p>'We will soon be arriving at Hogsmead station, make sure you are wearing your robes. Also leave all your luggage on the train, it will be taken to your dorms upon the sorting of your houses. Thank you, and have a good day'.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione practically leaped from her seat, grabbed Harry's robes, and shoved them in his hands before pushing him out the compartment. "Get dressed in the toilet, and no peaking". She said this as Susan and Hannah began pulling their own robes out of their travel bags.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes muuum", Harry said, getting a tongue stuck out at him from Hermione, and giggles from Susan and Hannah.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
