    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alfred Pennyworth has seen a lot of things in his life. Of course, Alfred also works for a man who dresses up as a bat at all hours of the night, to fight the crime which overruns their city years. This tends to allow things of a…curious nature into their converted, underground bunker more times than not.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Which is probably how Alfred notices the young man stumbling through the street with a fixedly unfocused expression on his pale face. A trembling hand latched onto a drooping shoulder in a manner that resembles the way Master Bruce might hold onto his Batwave. It doesn't take a moment for Alfred to determine that the youth is injured and that it is most likely the result of felonious intents.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The young man is perhaps in his mid to late twenties, but short - much too short, and swaying as he passes Alfred. Alfred tentatively reaches out, his fingers brushing against the man's arm and the reaction is immediate, if not stilted from injury.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Green eyes - the likes of which Alfred has never seen, snaps up to Alfred’s face with a new, fresh panic writ into his body and expression. His gaze flickers about and although the butler is about as nonthreatening as one can be in Gotham, nothing about the young man settles. </span>
</p><p class="p2">'Excuse me, my good sir, are you terribly alright?' Alfred asks, only to frown now that he is closer and notices the red sluggishly bleeding through trembling fingers. 'Great Scott! You're bleeding!’</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The young man grimaces and leans away from Alfred in a way that screams of wariness. 'Yeah, I noticed that too,' an English accent replies with a notable slur. 'Seems like I walked into a bullet.’</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alfred raises an eyebrow dispassionately as an odd sense of familiarity overcomes him. He is achingly used to this, having had to deal with much the same sort of attitude addressed to him by Master Bruce when dealing with many deep tissue wounds.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Instead, however, it’s a stranger who is suffering and the more Alfred looks at the young man, the more odd it becomes to him. It’s a bland, grey day, but silent. This sort of hour is the best time to be out and about with many of the more dangerous criminals yet to awaken from time spent terrorising the night.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Most likely, this young man was either immensely unlucky or he’s been targeted. If there is a price put onto his head then he’s in the wrong place to start with. Gotham is a place people go to <em>die </em>in that type of situation, not escape.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'And an ambulance was not called?' Alfred asks sternly. The man obviously walked away from the crime scene, whether that was due to the danger has yet to be established, but he doesn't seem to be in a rush.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There are many reasons why people won’t call the authorities or want to be seen to be involved with certain people, or even parts of town; Gotham is unfortunately that type of place. Why that would bother an Englishman who isn't from around here, Alfred can't say.</span>
</p><p class="p2">The man's eyes are glazed as they flicker to and from Alfred's face. 'Ain't got no phone,' he states obstinately and yet, Alfred knows instantly from raising a very intelligent individual into adulthood that there is at least an omission in those words.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Still, this man needs treatment.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Without a second thought, Alfred readjusts his grip on the young man’s surprisingly muscular arm and starts to guide the youth in the direction of where he knows a hospice to be located. It will be a bit of a walk but it's better than nothing.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man's breath is rasping and he's worryingly weak footed, even at Alfred's slowed pace. Perhaps having been inflicted with more than one injury? Like a bullet to the upper chest isn't enough.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Where -' the man coughs a spluttering sound, 'where you goin'?'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man’s struggling and yet experimentally tugging on his captured arm, as if curiously confused as to what's happened with it. Of course, it could be the blood loss. Alfred doesn't smell any alcohol on the youth and from what he's seen of those eyes, he isn’t been partaking in any narcotics.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'I am taking you to a doctor,' Alfred informs the young man briskly, but still looks back with one of his more stony expressions when the man starts to more adamantly pull away.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'N-no. Not - can't -'</span>
</p><p class="p2">'Sir,' Alfred addresses him firmly to silence the protests. He's used to arguing the importance of medical attention, just not to anyone who is not his charge. 'From your own admission you have been shot. You could be bleeding internally as we speak. I insist on a doctor.'</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'No hospitals!' the man hisses, in a way that makes him sound more animal than human. He stops walking entirely then, stubbornly digging in his heels and skidding them both to a halt. It is evident that while he has no strength to speak of, he's far heavier than his thin form and short statue would imply.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alfred stares. He is not frightened like he should be, as he looks at hazy but narrowed eyes and gritted teeth. The man could be a criminal for all Alfred knows and his behaviour and his type of injury should elicit suspicion.</span>
</p><p class="p2">But Alfred is not the least bit intimidated; has seen all sorts in his life and although it could speak more of his own arrogance than this man's innocence, he truly does not think there is any threat to be had here. To that end, even if the man is non-violent (regardless of how he may have gotten his injury in the beginning), he still refuses a hospital. Really, Alfred is going to get an earful from Master Bruce.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Very well,' Alfred concedes reluctantly before he about turns, probably jostling the young man by forcing him to move, and crosses the street after pausing to let a couple of cars pass. Compromise is key to child rearing. What is fortunate is that they only have to pass a few houses before they arrive at the entrance to an alleyway.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It is just as well that Alfred - much like Master Bruce - knows this city like the back of his hand. It is perhaps irony that they already weren't far off from Park Row.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Shouldn't be far,' Alfred informs the man though they will have to be quick. Park Row - or "Crime Alley”, as it’s more ambiguously known - is not the place to dawdle. 'Nearly there now, sir,' he encourages again when the man all but trips on an empty beer bottle, trying to soothe his obvious unease. This is not the type of place he relishes adventuring through.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man grunts a response but doesn't say any more until Alfred has dragged his sorry arse up to the door of the clinic. Run down as it is, Alfred doubts it looks at all impressive or reassuring but beggars can't be choosers.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Up we go now, sir.' The stairs are fortunately stone but shot all to hell from a few years back. A gang war had begun, turned violent from one member getting killed by another and the revenge just grew: flooding out into the streets. Luckily, the bullets never penetrated the walls; this clinic is a safe space in ways that churches are not. Even criminals know not to bring anything but bodies here.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alfred rings for service on the intercom Master Bruce has anonymously paid for, along with the keypad and electronic door which are the only things about the clinic outside the proud, glass and metal nameplate that aren’t falling apart.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>'Yes?'</em> a voice responds through the intercom, as its inhabitants know not to outright open the door despite the truce. You can never be too careful.</span>
</p><p class="p2">'Hello, Doctor Leslie. It's Alfred,' he informs her, shifting his grip on the man who is starting to tilt sideways. 'I've got another patient for you: man says he's been shot.'</p><p class="p2">'…not my benefactor?' Leslie asks for conformation. She is a close friend of the family, having worked with Master Thomas back in those more illustrious days when there seemed to still be hope for Gotham City. Now, after the tragic murder of Thomas and Martha, and in the new era of crime, Leslie has rededicated her life to the less fortunate.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'No, you've seen the news.' Master Bruce is set to be given an award not long from now (one that Alfred hopes not to miss. Master Bruce would notice and he does so tend to worry). Besides that, it is far too early for Batman to be up and about. Leslie, needless to say, knows of Master Bruce's nightlife. It has been a necessary decision Alfred made after Master Bruce came back to him one night so broken that Alfred could not fix him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Of course. I'll buzz you through.’</span>
</p><p class="p2">There's the obnoxious noise of the alarm being disarmed with the unlocking of the doors, something which Alfred has heard too many times already. Alfred wastes no time in opening the door and pushing the young man through, though he does stumble over the edge of the door frame before he can right himself.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They are still in the entranceway and Leslie is already stepping out from behind her desk which slopes on one side and is held up by nothing but sellotape, protruding nails and good fortune.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She is a good woman of average height and weight, dressing simply and practically but always with her doctor's jacket. She hurries to them and her quick, sharp eyes are already running over the two of them before she focuses on the young man, who is slumped into Alfred's side.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Hello,' Leslie greets with a sympathetic smile which only highlights the lines time has started to carve into her face. Her black hair is stubborn, but also beginning to pepper itself with white strands from stress and long nights. 'I'm Leslie Thompkins, call me whatever you're comfortable with.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man seems to study her for a minute before he inclines his head in acceptance and just as soon, she is leading them back through to the stairwell and away from the louder bottom floor. The steps are steep and broken; a health hazard all their own, but it would cost a small fortune to have them repaired, especially in this part of town; something Leslie can ill-afford.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Leslie glances to Alfred and between them, they help the young man up the stairs. The last thing either of them wants is to have him trip and fall, and further injure himself before Leslie can sow him back together.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Thankfully, they reach the top without incident though the man is further exhausted by the exercise. A number of closed rooms are ahead with different locked units outside each one, functioning as medicine cabinets. On each door is a whiteboard where Leslie can write names, instructions and whatever other information she or any one of the few helpers she has may need to know.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At the end of the hallway is another set of stairs which leads to the attic. One half of the space up there is for patients that are in need of a quiet recovery, while the rest is used for equipment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Styled more like a common hospital, there is little privacy though there have been attempts with curtains stabled to the ceiling and Chinese screens that have seen better days. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Leslie shows them though to the second room down. The door creaks open as she pushes it aside for them to enter. 'These are for my In-and-Outs,' Leslie informs the man as she takes one arm and Alfred the other, to help him up onto the examination table. She settles him while Alfred closes the door. (Living with Master Bruce may have, conceivably, made him paranoid.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Alright, show me this bullet wound,' Leslie asks patiently as Alfred turns back around. The man blinks at her for a moment before Alfred clears his throat.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'We can still take you to a hospital…' Alfred trails off and that's enough for the man to start the arduous task of undressing. He sheds a rather beaten up leather jacket - military styled, that is shrugged to sit stiffly behind him before Alfred moves it to the side so that it is not in the way.</span>
</p><p class="p2">Next is a long-sleeved, black shirt that the man gets held up on as he struggles to undo the buttons. Leslie is always careful not to intrude on her patients space, but when the fiddling continues for too long, she reaches forward to help. Valiantly ignoring how the man stiffens as their fingers brush, she pauses only long enough for him to relax before completing the task.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Ah, there we go,' Leslie mutters and gently pulls the two sides of the collar away from the man's chest and down his shoulders so that it is free from his form. The both of them hiss when his torso is laid bare for them to see.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The bullet wound is, in a word, gruesome. There is no obvious burn marks and it is too big for that to be the point of entry, which means that this man was shot from behind. The blood trails down his chest, paving a path along his abdomen to sink below his waistline.</span>
</p><p class="p2">Perhaps more telling is the mass of bruises that decorate the man's skin. It seems like someone has tried to paint this young man purple. With their fists. Leslie glances at Alfred in a silent enquiry but Alfred has no answers so he merely shakes his head.</p><p class="p2">The man certainly has the physique of a fighter, with the tightly built muscles that are wired into his rather petit form. Still quite streamlined and nothing like a bodybuilder, but…perhaps a martial artist or something of the like. That does not reveal the man's temperament, however; what he was trained in, or how he got into this condition to begin with.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Clumsily, the man taps below the bullet hole and through gritted teeth, bites out: 'exit wound.' Leslie nods - she would have guessed that within a second of seeing it - and rounds the examination table, skimming between its edge and the tight space between the table and the wall, to see the entrance.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Alfred, can you push my tray over?' Leslie asks and without question, Alfred hums in agreement and goes to pull over the metal cart so that it is by the side of the examination table, and easily accessible. Leslie is looking closer at the man's back while sanitising her hands. Once finished, she absently puts on a fresh pair of gloves, of which she keeps a packet attached to the belt around her waist.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alfred goes to stand to the side of the head of the table, watching as she feels up and down the man's spine for a moment; searching for damage, before nodding. Leslie comes back around to face her patient. 'We'll need to sow this up for you,' she tells him as she reaches for a fresh cloth from her trey and hands it to Alfred.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He's worked with this woman many times due to Master Bruce's constant need for medical attention, so he doesn't pause before he's reaching around the man's back and pressing the cloth against the wound while Leslie does the same for the front.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alfred looks at the man's discomforted side profile while Leslie asks: 'can you tell me if you're feeling any nausea or dizziness?'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man's eyes crinkle but he slowly nods. 'A bit,' he admits reluctantly. 'But…I think that's the concussion.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'You hit your head?' Leslie demands, lips pursing as the man again wordlessly agrees.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">‘Well,’ the man begins after pausing in thought, ‘tech-noc-ly, someone did…that for me,' the man replies with a shaky smile. 'No worries though, Doc, I know I'm not bleedin' inter-nelly,' he states with what seems to be a numb tongue. 'Some bloke just thought it'd be funny to play Whack-A-Mole with me as thah mole. Jus' gimme some stitches. Need - without the holes, when I get - get shouted at.’</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That is the most Alfred has heard this man say, but he finds himself becoming more bemused.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'You have medical experience?' Leslie enquires, probably wanting to know if she can trust the man's word, while she sorts out the equipment she'll need with one hand. The sanitiser, cotton, needles and dissolvable thread is all put onto a clean tray that she places onto the examination table, near the man's thigh.</span>
</p><p class="p2">'Yeah. A lot.' The man snorts without elaborating.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'A lot in providing it or needing it?' Leslie asks shrewdly with a cocked eyebrow.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'What's the - the defiance. Difference?' the man retorts and stills a shrug he was halfway through performing, before remembering he’s been shot. 'I've taken a few causes - courses; best teacher is experience though, and I've been in and out of - hospitals since…ever.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Abuse is the first thought in Alfred's head, it would make the man's height make some sense, though he knows he shouldn't speculate on something like that.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'The bullet was through and through,' the man says without waiting for a reply and Alfred realises that he is probably impatient to get some actual medical aid. 'And…no pain killas. P-please,' he adds just as Leslie is reaching for a syringe.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Leslie looks back, blinking in surprise. 'Why -?'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'I need some…a-aware-ness so - to stumble home,' the man replies as Leslie gently removes her cloth so she can set about cleaning the outside of the wound to avoid later infection. The cloth meets its end in the waste bin. 'If…if it makes you feel more com-footble; I'm - I'm allergic.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She dabs the area with the cotton carefully and when she's satisfied, throws that cleanly away too. 'It's not about my comfort,' she rebukes but doesn't reach for the syringe. She is a doctor - was once at the forefront of medicine - but she has learnt different ways of handling patients, with this clinic. Most are criminals, scatting outside of the law or not able to afford health care, and it requires her to oftentimes listen to the patients' wants over their needs, to avoid putting them in a worse position.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Alfred, take this young man's hand,' Leslie requests as she prepares the rounded needle.</span>
</p><p class="p2">'Of course,' Alfred says agreeably and presents his free hand to the man who doesn't seem to know what to do with it. 'Sir,' he prompts.</p><p class="p2">After a brief pause of hesitance, the young man interlinks their fingers. 'Jus' don't throw your medical expanses - expensive - expenses at me, if…if I break something,' he huffs, each single word a difficulty. 'You A-Americans and your health care.'</p><p class="p2">'I am not an American.' Though Alfred lives in America fully now, he does not - and never will - think of himself as American.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Green eyes flash in distress as steel pierces the man's skin with the beginning of the first stitch. He stills a violent jerk and his neck stains, his veins becoming visible through the column of pale flesh. For all that he appears to be in pain and even with his earlier warning, Alfred feels barely a spasm of it directed towards his hand, with with the man's fingers tense, yet refraining form taking a firm hold of his ageing hand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Y-yeah,' the man responds, a bit breathlessly as his chest stalls for one, two heartbeats. 'Figured.'</span>
</p><p class="p2">Leslie has a no-questions-asked policy when it comes to her patients. She treats anyone who comes to her for help but this man, now that he is off the street, doesn't show any signs of antisocial behaviour. In all honesty, he is far more talkative than what you'd expect from someone with a hole in their chest.</p><p class="p2">With that in mind, Alfred allows himself to ask: 'what part of England are you from?'</p><p class="p2">'Surrey,' the man replies after a few steadying exhales as Leslie continues her work. 'Was more up Scotland way before I got goin' with me - my career.' And with his eyes he indicates the dog tags that are hanging low and painted red from his blood on his chest. 'Served for a bit.'</p><p class="p2">Alfred glances at it. </p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"> <b>"POTTER</b> </span>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"> <b>HARRY</b> </span>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"> <b>DMLE - 31 07 80S</b> </span>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"> <b>HALF-BLOOD</b> </span>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"> <b>NEUTRAL"</b> </span>
  </p>
</blockquote><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'That…is not an ordinary dog tag,' Alfred states in perplexity after squinting enough to read the small, thin bit of metal. Though it is nice to know the man's name - "Harry Potter" - that is obviously not the man's social security number which is usually printed on a service man's dog tag. The last two lines don't make a lick of sense either.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter tenses. 'Please stay still,' Leslie scolds, glancing up for a moment at the two of them to show a hint of her disapproval, before going back to giving the wound her full attention.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter ignores her and stares soundly at Alfred with an amount of startling clarity. 'You can see it.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alfred raises an eyebrow in question. 'Should I not be able to?'</span>
</p><p class="p2">Potter shakes his head, a tired movement that barely manages to shift his hair. 'What does the last line say?'</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'…"neutral",' Alfred reads after pausing. 'I do believe, however, that that is a…curious religion, Mister Potter,' he comments, knowing that is what should be in its place.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'It's not -' Potter stops himself, hesitates as his eyes flicker to Leslie. 'Does…does the word "squib" mean anythin' to you?'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And that's all Potter needs to say for Alfred to understand. For him to remember his grandmother and her sad, sad eyes and his grandfather's fury that was only equal to his sorrow every time he glanced Alfred's way.</span>
</p><p class="p2">'Ah,' is all Alfred can say. 'So, you are…'</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Well, a half-blood. What else could that have meant? Alfred thinks to himself with suddenly itching skin.</span>
</p><p class="p2">Potter's eyes are still looking at him, though and he does not seem to regard him with any malice. 'Yeah.' He nods simply. 'Don't know how much sense this'll make tah - to you, so tell me to cork it if, yanno.' He stumbles on his words as he blinks slowly, obviously struggling to stay awake. 'Bur I was on'na case. Got a bit distracted when the prick I was tryin' to apprehend injured a sardine - civilian. Then, cuz I'm lucky like this, I managed to get myself sent here on an international portkey.'</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Luckily, Alfred knows enough; probably more than a lot of second-generation squibs, that is. He's been told quite a bit about the Ministry and portkeys from cousins, as his grandparents struggled to share their world with him. If Potter works for the Ministry - which is what it sounds like - then he is probably part of their police department, chasing a criminal. What doesn't make sense, however: 'The bullet wound?'</span>
</p><p class="p2">Potter's mouth twists with bitterness even as his brow furrows. 'Er…he wasn't…"native".'</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Which is to say…not a Pureblood? Well, either way. 'Do you have a way to get home?'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter nods after a second. 'Yeah. Should be fine.' Alfred doesn't quite believe it if the way he says it - so tiredly - is any indication.</span>
</p><p class="p2">'Alright, sweetheart,' Leslie announces, in the process of cutting off the excess string from the needle. 'Just your back left to sow up.'</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter grimaces. 'Fun.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It’s fortunate that their short conversation, to Leslie, was probably double Dutch that she's put down to English colloquialisms or Potter's concussion. Not to say that Leslie isn’t becoming aware of the more…unusual aspects of life through Batman's adventures, just that she didn't pick them up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Almost there,' Leslie promises as Alfred removes the cloth he's been keeping on the entrance wound all this time, and hands it back to Leslie so that she can dispose of it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'S'okay.' Potter smiles crookedly in reassurance as he takes a steadying breath. 'I've had worse.' Which is frankly unsurprising from the amount of scar tissue Potter is sporting, if disheartening with how young he appears.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Leslie doesn't comment though and quickly gets to work. Stitching the entrance wound takes less time and once she is finished, she removes her gloves for a new pair, in order to bandage her patient.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Alright, sweetheart,' Leslie says as she puts temporary plasters on the back and then the front of the wound after moving around the examination table again in order to reach Potter's chest. 'You're done.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter takes a shuddering breath. 'Thanks, it's appreciated.' He smiles then, slightly crooked and a bit strained as he tilts his head towards her. 'What do I owe you?'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Your continued good health,' Leslie states without missing a beat and wards off whatever response he says. 'Now, you'll have to keep this clean - but do not wash the wound directly. And if you don't want to stretch it out or pop a stitch, you'll need to avoid exercise.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Something about Potter's face softens, the defence wired into his body smoothing all his sharp lines. He becomes something indescribably younger. 'Got it, Doc.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Humming, Leslie leans forward and tilts Potter's head toward her and then downwards, which tenses the man back up again. She looks over his scalp, gently shifting hair out of her way by running her fingers through that thick mane of long, black tresses. 'Ah - found it,' she mutters. 'Oh, hon. What'd you get hit with?' Leslie asks with noticeable sympathy as she starts the process of cleaning the wound.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alfred doesn't have a very good view from the angle he's positioned in, but he can tell that it is causing Potter some distress. 'Dunno,' Potter responds carelessly. 'Could have been the butt of the gun, the wall, the edge of the dumpster,' he lists with an air of nonchalance that Alfred knows all too well. 'Prat liked attacking from behind, didn't really care what he hit with. When I haunt - hunt this guy down, I'm throwing the book at him.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Leave the book throwing until after you can see straight, okay, champ?' Leslie grins, though Alfred knows that she doesn't understand the context of this not-so proverbial book.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'As if to say that there aren't four of you?' Potter asks rhetorically, perking up with awareness as he allows himself to settle into the clinic's wall as his eyes mockingly widen. 'Well, colour me surprised.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Leslie snorts as she begins to clean around the wound with more cotton-wool that goes straight in the bin afterwards. Potter winces at the beginning before he steadies himself. 'To take care of the concussion, go home, get someone - a partner, a family member, a friend you can drag in - to wake you up in the morning to check on you. Avoid bright lights and try to keep from doing anything strenuous. If you seem impaired in any way, you have to get to a hospital. Concussions aren't as easy as a through-and-through bullet wound. Got all that?' Leslie questions as she reaches for the bandages.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'I dunno, is this going to be on the test?' Potter asks with a deadpan face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'If it were, I'd fail you,' Leslie responds as she wraps Potter's head in bandages until there is a white halo encircling his  hair, with the shorter ends stuck up quite ridiculously as they flick in every direction while the longer ends trail down his neck and shoulders without a care.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter dramatically wipes his eyes as Leslie steps back to inspect her work. 'Breaking my heart, Doc. Here I've been such a good patient…'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Leslie rolls her eyes, no doubt enjoying this visit far more than who would typically call upon her. 'A good patient isn't a patient at all.'</span>
</p><p class="p2">Potter tsks, though his exhaustion still shadows his face and makes his every move slow. 'You won't be saying that the next time someone pukes on your shoes.'</p><p class="p2">'Get dressed, mister,' Leslie commands, amusement clear in her tone.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Oh, I see how it is. You check out the goods and you think that's all I'm got - good for,' Potter sniffs while Alfred wonders how the man can have so suddenly found his sense of humour. With a bullet wound and a concussion, even Master Bruce is liable to be broody. People cope in different ways.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter is obviously in pain because even with the current light mood, as soon as he goes to shrug his shirt back on, he grimaces, his eyes clenching as his nose wrinkles.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Really,' Leslie chides and comes back over after pushing the cart away from the bed now she is finished with it. 'Take it slow,' she says as she takes control and eases the fabric back up his arms until the shirt has settled over the man's slumped shoulders. Carefully, she goes ahead and does the buttons up again. 'There, test is over.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Failing grade?' Potter questions as his hand trembles when he forces his palm over his chest.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'A for effort,' Leslie smiles before giving the man space. 'I'll leave the jacket to you,' she says which prompts Alfred to pick the heavy leather jacket up, unfold it and drape it over Potter's shoulders.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Thanks,' Potter nods, glancing from Leslie to Alfred with quiet gratitude that shines through even if his tone is somewhat gruff. He takes Leslie's advice of slowing down, pulling one arm through a sleeve at a time. Once he's tugged the zip up the front, he's looking up at them again with bright green eyes. 'Really, Doc, what do I owe you?'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Leslie just smiles. 'Alfred, dear, help our friend here get back onto Main,' she orders as she silently aids Potter off of the table and patiently waits for the man to steady himself before letting go. 'I'm sure you two gentlemen will find something to talk about there.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Which is a nice way of Leslie saying that she knows they had been having a rather private conversation right in front of her, though Leslie seems rather unbothered by it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Kick a guy to the curb, why don't you,' Potter sighs but the grin on his face doesn't quite fit with the pallor of his kin or the sweat trickling down his temples. He offers his hand, however, with a soft 'thank you.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Leslie's face softens as it's rare someone is so courteous. 'Peace, child.' She takes his hand, gently folding the fingers together as she lightly shakes it while trying not to jostle the man.</span>
</p><p class="p2">Carefully, Leslie and Alfred help the man back out and down the stairs, where he almost goes arse over tea kettle as he becomes dizzy and almost falls. Luckily, between the two of them, they are able to stop Potter's descent and get him to the door no worse for wear.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She buzzes them out as Potter says goodbye. 'I'll remember this, Doctor Leslie Thompkins,' he promises, which could be read as threatening if it weren't for his tone of voice and the kindness glowing from his face like a beacon. 'If you ever need anything, call this number.' With some difficulty he takes a rather crumbled card from his back pocket and hands it to Leslie.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Just avoid Whack-a-Mole from now on, champ,' Leslie laughs, but she takes the card, glancing at it before it disappears into the void that is her pocket.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter smirks weakly. 'No promises,' he responds as Alfred readjusts the hold he has on Potter's arm and starts to help the two of them down the stairs. The door shuts behind them and although Alfred tries to take his time getting to the floor, he knows that being caught in this alley would be anything but ideal.</span>
</p><p class="p2">'You have a phone, Mister Potter?' Alfred asks as they reach the last step, glad that he has kept himself in good shape so that carrying a good portion of someone else's weight doesn't tire him out.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'I was raised outside of the Wizarding World,' Potter replies without hostility, thankfully. Alfred didn't think that Potter was the type, not from what he’s learnt in the clinic, but people surprise him sometimes and it is very rarely good when they do. 'In my department of the Ministry, I wouldn't be able to keep my job without being able to integrate into both worlds. And - er, Harry's fine.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alfred merely quirks an eyebrow. 'It was good of you to offer your aid to Leslie, I shall hint to her not to throw your number away,' he says instead before changing the subject again as they emerge from the alley, seemingly unfollowed. 'You were rather vague, but you are in quite a state. Are you sure you will be capable of getting back to England, Mister Potter?'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter sighs. 'Well, MACUSA will have to be informed that I accidentally portkeyed into America with a wanted criminal, but they should be willing enough to help me back to England.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'MACUSA?' Alfred finds himself asking, though he has long grown out of the little boy who wanted to learn about the other world he wasn't quite apart of, which didn't want him and never will.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'The American Ministry.' Potter shrugs. 'I've worked with them quite a bit, and we have an alright relationship. They're pretty picky with…er, teamwork, though.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Not that much different from the American government, then, Alfred knows. 'Where can I drop you off?'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'I'm not anywhere near any magical settlements,' Potter states which is…disheartening. 'But I have nowhere to be for hours and…you feel a bit antsy, like you have somewhere to be? I can follow you that way and go it alone once I know you're safe.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hm, seems that Potter is very much a police officer. 'My charge is being gifted an award from the mayor and is set to give a speech, if we hurry we might be able to catch it,' Alfred allows if only because he now knows that Potter is harmless and because Alfred is late.</span>
</p><p class="p2">Potter blinks before that crooked smile is back. 'What is the afford - award, for?'</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'His rather sizeable donations to numerous charities,' Alfred says because he is very proud of Master Bruce, even if his work as the Batman often leaves his alter ego acting nothing like the man Alfred has seen grow up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They walk and stumble through twenty minutes' worth of a journey before the city pulls back from stone and metal to show the city park. It isn't quite as green as it should be, half the plants are dead or have been trampled down, but it is the closest thing to vegetation Gotham has, even with the menace which was Poison Ivy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Through the trees, the temporary stage is visible as are the television cameras and the security in the form of the police with the commissioner standing off to the side, looking vigilant and tense, though cordial, with the mayor on one side and Master Bruce on the other.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The crowd is rather big for this type of thing, with about twenty or so individuals. The Gotham occupancy rarely come out for such an event, it's too much of a risk for most when it is going to be on the television anyway.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Quite the shindig,' Potter comments as they enter the park and start to swim the tide of the crowd to get a better view. It seems like they are right on time as the mayor has just taken the stage and is adjusting the mic when they reach the front. Immediately visible, Alfred can feel Master Bruce's eyes on him - blue like the clearest sky - flickering between Alfred and his guest.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Master Bruce's eyes narrow in askance but Alfred merely shakes his head. It's fine, he says silently and Master Bruce's shoulders relax as the mayor starts his drivelling speech.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Master Bruce has just been called onto the stage when it happens; a customised van drives into the park, mowing down plants, a food cart and nearly several people. Alfred turns just in time to see it screech to a halt as the crowd instantly starts to panic. It's easy to see why, with the Joker standing proudly on the roof.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>Oh. Oh no,</em> Alfred thinks as every muscle in him stiffens. The clown's twisted face and yellow eyes are distorted in a grotesque farce of hysterical laughter as he stares down at them.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Yo! Bruce-y, Commish! Two of my favourite people in one place for a party, and no one thought to invite poor old Joker!' The Joker sobs into his arm as the people shifts amongst themselves, terrified of drawing attention to themselves. Alfred, himself, tightens his grip on Potter.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Joker's two goons step out from the van, walls of dumb muscle, but very dangerous in ways the Joker rarely brothers with. 'But I figured if you can't join them…' The demented clown pulls out what appears to be a water gun in his infamous colour scheme from behind his back. 'Get them to join you.' The Joker's laughter has always made Alfred feel rather sick but it's doubly so now when the maniac is pointing a weapon in Alfred's direction.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Joker's long spindly white finger is just about to pull back on the trigger when Potter is suddenly moving, freeing himself from Alfred's gasp. He reacts just in time to see Potter pull a knife from the sleeve of his jacket. Potter barely winces as he flexes his arm - pulling at his stitches and irritating his bruises, no doubt - in order to throw the blade.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It flies through the air like a bullet until the knife buries itself into the plastic of the gun's chamber. 'Scatter!' Potter demands and the crowd is all too quick to obey, what with the commanding presence of his voice and the sudden strength of his form that has come to radiate outwards, just as Potter gains the ire of a psychotic clown.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'No! No! <em>No!</em> That wasn't meant to happen!' the Joker shouts as he throws down the gun and lets it clatter off of the roof of the van. He somersaults to the ground, wildly pointing at Potter while Alfred takes the better part of valour and retreats to where the police are beginning to arm themselves. 'Who the hell are you! I didn't invite you to this party.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Harry Potter, at your service,' Potter introduces himself, bowing in a way that is just as theatrical as the Joker without the unhinged quality. 'I do believe this was VIP only.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Joker's eyes narrow but after a second, the anger that he’s been projecting sinks inwards - internalised. He shrugs, his heinous smile stretching further. 'This is my city and it's Bat's bedtime right now. No one else is aloud to play hero!'</span>
</p><p class="p2">'Pity,' Potter comments, his stance shifting into something more defensive as the commissioner demands the Joker step back and surrender. It goes ignored, even as the safeties are released. 'It's no fun for you without an adversary though, is it?'</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Ah well, me and Bruce-y are old time friends.' Potter's impressive eyes shift at the announcement, tilting his body a little to put Bruce and the commissioner further behind him. A protectors’ instinct. 'Seems to me like this was an important day for him and I couldn't have him thinking I didn't care, now could I?'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'How…kind of you,' Potter responds as the police run to secure a perimeter around them.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'But I think this celebration's gotten a little full,' the Joker remarks as he whistles. 'Punch, Judy - show time.'</span>
</p><p class="p2">That's all it takes for the two goons that've happily been watching the confrontation to come forward with animalistic roars. Punch grabs at a nearby tree, ripping a bulky branch off from the base that a normal man wouldn't even be able to lift. As soon as Punch has a handle on it, he's lifting it like a javelin and hauling it in the direction of the officers. It travels with such speed that it nails a few men too slow to properly get out of its path.</p><p class="p2">The commissioner is swearing and just calling for back up when Judy smashes into Potter, his giant fist slamming into the block Potter has put up. It's like a clash of the titans though Judy is heads taller and should have easily had Potter on his knees, especially with his injuries.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter withstands, however, and is quick to retaliate with a quick kick that causes Judy to stumble, curling inward as he does. The look on Judy's face is a mixture of pain and shock. 'What're they feeding you?' Potter asks as he delivers another, more rounded kick to Judy's head, one that Judy is too slow to respond to. It nails the man on his cheek and sends him flying a short distance before he crashes into the ground.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter huffs a breath, hiding pants of exhaustion as he attempts not to slump forward. It's this lapse of attention that enables Punch to grab Potter from behind in the second that Master Bruce yells out his warning: 'Hey! Behind you!'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter's feet dangle as Punch lifts the man from the ground, with one of his arms choking Potter by clutching at his neck, and another curling around Potter's abdomen like a boa constrictor.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alfred can almost <em>hear</em> Master Bruce's hands clench and unclench as he struggles not to intervene. It is not in his nature to stand by and watch even when it means risking imprisonment, but there is nowhere for Master Bruce to escape to, not with the mayor using him as a shield, an officer at his side and the commissioner standing in front of him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The commissioner is not as restricted as he takes aim and tries to shoot Punch, but the bullet just embeds itself into hulking muscle, useless, as Potter tries to lash out, grasping anywhere he can reach as his face turns red.</span>
</p><p class="p2">'Now, now, look who's the last one on the dance floor,' the Joker coos as he flutters his eyelashes. He skips forward with unholy glee until he is a few feet away from Potter. The clown leans in, seemingly to examine Potter's face as his struggles are stilled as Punch squeezes him harder.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'I don't think I've ever seen you before…' the Joker ponders. 'I'd remember that face…those eyes…' the madman leans in closer to Potter's face. 'So serious, though. You'd look so much better with a smile.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alfred feels his stomach drop as the Joker reaches into his pocket to pull out some other toxin in the shape of another, smaller water gun.<em> 'Ngh-'</em> Potter tries to speak but the words doesn’t quite escape Punch's iron grip.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Joker snaps his fingers and Punch loosens his hold an inch or two. 'Ever so sorry, what was that? Punch got your tongue?'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Not -' Potter pants, 'not today.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Joker blinks and has just opened his mouth when the impossible happens. Potter grabs onto Punch's shoulders, holds on tight so that when Potter throws his weight down, the beast is bent over Potter's slight form. Booted feet stamp onto the ground, and with that miraculous anchorage, Potter manages an over the shoulder throw. It shouldn't have been possible -</span>
</p><p class="p2">The Joker doesn't have time to scramble backwards before he is flattened by his own crony, both unconscious as their heads smash against the concrete from the force Potter manages to apply. Though Potter has undoubtedly gotten out of that headlock by the grace of god, Alfred thinks that Potter's weak gesturing after is what keeps them faint on the ground. Even if Potter only waves his hand over them for a moment.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The backup the commissioner called can just be heard as Potter stands for a moment victorious, before the trembling in his legs almost has him toppling over. Master Bruce rushes towards him, most likely in a mixture of trying to help and being needed as Alfred follows close behind.</span>
</p><p class="p2">'Steady,' Master Bruce says as he carefully catches Potter by the tops of his arms. Alfred can see Master Bruce glance at the pile of murder and wickedness, assessing for the spilt second it takes him, before he's readdressing Potter like he never looked away. He leads them back as the police quickly take over, injured or not, from the commissioner's orders.</p><p class="p2">'Careful of his shoulder, Master Bruce,' Alfred warns as he steps close to his charge's side. Master Bruce gives him a flat look but his hands stay cupped firmly around Potter's arms.</p><p class="p2">'I think I need to sit down,' Potter says quietly, the rest of his energy sucked out of him. He appears a drooping flower rather than the tiger he has just shown himself to be.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Of course,' Master Bruce replies agreeably, voice concerned but layered with caution. 'This way.' He leads Potter to one of the park's benches and eases the man down until he is sat, back resting against the wooden planks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'I do believe that Leslie is going to be a mite irritated when she learns you did not heed her advice to rest,' Alfred finds himself saying while keeping half an eye on the squad cars that come barrelling into the park.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Or you could jest - just, not tell her,' Potter suggests with a weak tilt of his lips, weakly rubbing sweat that starts to trail down from his hairline away with the back of his hand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'You've met the resident doctor?' Master Bruce asks, fishing for information he can't ask yet with all the present company.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter nods and Master Bruce frowns further. 'I -'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Seems like you've had it pretty rough, son,' the commissioner's voice remarks as he walks into their space from the left. There's a tired curve to the man's spine; quiet, something that he isn't able to combat no matter how strong his shoulders are. It comes from being one of the only things holding their city together for so many years, for having the integrity and honour that so many have tried to rob him of, through attempted deals and payoffs and threats.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter's green eyes trail up to the commissioner, but Alfred has the feeling that he heard the man coming long before he made himself known. 'I think I gave as good as I got.' Potter smirks, tame fire burning in his gaze. 'Thanks for the backup, though.'</span>
</p><p class="p2">The commissioner snorts, knowing how little good he has done in the short moments the confrontation lasted. 'You're stronger than you look.'</p><p class="p2">'Hah…yeah, I get that a lot,' Potter mutters, shifting minutely and grimacing instantly.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Try to stay still, the medics are on their way.' The commissioner bends to place a palm flat on Potters injured shoulder but the man barely responds. Alfred probably only notices his intake of breath because he was expecting it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Ah, I'm fine. A lie down and I'll be as gone - good, as knew,' Potter responds quickly, obviously not wanting to get tied down in any records in a country he has no place being.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The commissioner looks set to argue and although Alfred knows very little of this man, Potter has gone out of his way to protect a crowd of people he didn't know whilst suffering from wounds that would put him at a disadvantage in combat. He deserves something for his trouble.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Not to worry, Commissioner Gordon, I would prefer my nephew be treated privately,' Alfred intervenes. Master Bruce doesn't bat and eyelash and neither does Potter, who simply inclines his head. Competency is simply glorious. Maybe that's why it is so hard to find.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The commissioner inhales, running his fingers through his hair. 'At least allow yourself to be checked over.' Potter smiles but it isn't agreeable and the commissioner can tell, however he doesn't press the issue as he turns to Master Bruce.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Commissioner,' Master Bruce sighs, knowing where that look is heading, the man doesn't even need to open his mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p2">'Wayne,' the commissioner returns without his usual tact but then, they have just all suffered the performance of Gotham's psychotic clown, short lived though it was. 'I have to keep insisting, Mister Wayne. You draw these freaks to you like moths to light and we both understand the consequences if anything happened to you. You need some kind of protection detail -'</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Commissioner -' Master Bruce tries to interrupt because the commissioner has no idea how impossible that suggestion really is. However well intentioned, they have been dodging the commissioner's propositions for a long time.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Actually, that's why I'm here,' Potter cuts in. He's straightened slightly, but he is looking directly at the commissioner as he talks. 'I've just gotten out of the Armed Force and…needed to get away, so Uncle Al offered me a place.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Commissioner blinks as Alfred tries not to glance over at Master Bruce or twitch at the nickname. Potter seems to be attempting to help with what he's picked up as a tricky situation. 'You…?'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Harry Potter,' Potter introduces himself with a worn grin but his gaze is steady. 'Mister Wayne's bodyguard, or I should be, in the next few weeks.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'This is…a surprise,' the commissioner says as he looks between them. He stares longer than necessary but seems to nod to himself before commenting, somewhat glibly: 'Some interview.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter laughs. 'One extreme to the next is pretty normal for me.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Stories form in words, hide in conversations. Master Bruce has become particularly good at hearing people's history in ways Alfred knows few people can.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Military?' the commissioner questions, obviously trying to make a connection with the dog tags hidden beneath Potter's jacket.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Afraid my file's classified, Commish,' Potter answers with a slow blink and Alfred can tell that he won't be able to keep this up for much longer. 'But I promise I won't cause you half as much trouble as I did for Queen and Country.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Son, my daughter tells me that every day.' The commissioner's lips twitch as his officers restrain the Joker and his muscle, dragging the men in to their armed van in the background. It has become so commonplace that it isn't even noteworthy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter snorts but he seems to be sinking further into the bench. 'She sounds angelic.'</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The commissioner huffs in laughter as his pager sounds. Behind the times, that, but the commissioner likes to keep things. He can be quite a sentimental man. 'Ah. As nice as it is to meet you, I think I've taken up enough of your time. Mister Wayne, I'm glad you've finally decided to start protecting yourself. Mister Potter, thank you for your assistance today, one of my men will be around for your statement soon, but make sure to get some medical attention,' he orders sternly. 'Gentlemen,' he nods as he turns to leave.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter sighs, seemingly becoming one with the bench. 'Bodyguard?' Master Bruce questions pointedly glancing between Alfred and Potter, having stayed quiet up until that point and Potter cringes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Er…' Potter trails off.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">'Well, Mister Potter,' Master Bruce begins as he shrugs off the polite, gormless expression he has been wearing that is just as much a mask as the bat's cowl. 'How funny it is that I wasn't told of an oncoming hire. Please, do introduce yourself.'</span>
</p>
