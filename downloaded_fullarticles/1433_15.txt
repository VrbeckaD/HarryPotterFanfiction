He could have <em>killed </em>me!”</p><p>“And yet, you seems pretty undamaged, if I may” said Dumbledore with a spark of amusement that made Severus’s fists clench with rage.</p><p>“I’d be dead if that bastard Potter hadn’t pissed himself with fear” he spat out.</p><p>“Yes, I must agree that Mr Potter intervention has been indeed quite providential” said the Headmaster, delighted. “Who would have thought I’d see the day James Potter saved your life!”</p><p>Severus looked at him bewildered.

If the Headmaster thought it’d be enough to make Severus accept that madness, he was utterly wrong.</p><p>He hold his piercing gaze with defiance. “When everybody we’ll learn what he is –”</p><p>“Oh, but no one outside this room is going to find out, of course” said Dumbledore with amusement. “Unless you wish me to inform Miss Evans of your compelling ambition to get out of the friendzone...”</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
