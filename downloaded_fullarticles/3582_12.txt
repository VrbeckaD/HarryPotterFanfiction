    <p>We are all born as half a person. There is an emptiness that manifests in our form as we meander through life in search of the one <em>thing</em> which will fill our glass. Be it an object, a person or a beat; there is one experience that will complete us and leave us to feel at peace in a world of hurricanes.</p>
<p>For most, that thing is love.</p>
<p>The dainty hills and sinking bunkers which characterise the golf course at Ivory Falls Country Club epitomise a setting of romance. The water hazards gently caress the edges of the rough, dampening blades of grass with the kisses of their current. Flagpoles hang limp in the silence of the night, not a lick of breeze haunting the summer dusk. Trees whisper and frogs sing the notes of love as individuals allow the essence of July to colour their skin and warm their eyes.</p>
<p>July. Summer. A season for love and a season for new emotional endeavours. There is a sense of escapism to summer, an idea that one can blur the lines between their reality and fantasy by soaring the skies and landing on a sandy beach a continent or two away. For a miniscule moment their life back home is clouded and they shed a skin of stress and exhaustion.</p>
<p>New beginnings.</p>
<p>You can find a sense of belonging in bars tucked in the corners of city centres. Strangers can meddle with dalliance as they peruse the rim of a cocktail glass, the gleaming sun grazing their skin while lazily lounging by a pool. Every person you meet feels like taking a book from a library and opening a dog-eared page, delving head first into a narrative you don’t know the start of but are enthused to learn more about.</p>
<p>Love overbears, though. A love for vacation, a love for the momentary escapism that comes from drizzling fingertips through granules of sand. Love found in a foreign language or love found for another person. A love for love. Summer love.</p>
<p>The intermingling of elation and fluttering kisses characterises summer love. Every day is a honeymoon phase in a honeymoon location, clear skies juxtaposing the not-so clear skin of the teenagers who often fall heavy into the abyss of summer love. In a trope often trivialised by popular culture teenagers fall for each other among whispering inky skies and echoing waves, enticed by the sense of uncertainty and the finite expanse of time which encircle their romance. Whether falling in love over dance lessons or melodising their fling between shifts at summer work, teenagers in every scope of life seem destined to toy with summer love.</p>
<p>But this destiny isn’t calculated. While fate may have plucked her strings to set events into the order they needed to take, the tumultuous journey of summer love comes from miniscule margins of time and the alignment of random circumstances.</p>
<p>There are a pure set of coincidences which can lead two halves of a whole to unite. A silenced phone, a broken traffic light. A cancelled flight or a missed connection subdued by locking eyes over the edge of a coffee shop counter. For every rushing businessman late for his train there is a soothing stationmaster leading him to the correct platform. For every hungover university student stumbling into a store there is a playful chemist passing headache tablets to them over eruptions of giggles.</p>
<p>But, most importantly, for every blonde-haired ray of sunshine working a summer job in a country club there is a son of a wealthy lawyer, etching poems into a notebook, as he waits to board his flight to Ivory Falls.</p>
