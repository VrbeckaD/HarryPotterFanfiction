    <p>
  <span>“Look who just got made Head Boy!!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Peter stared at James in adoration as he brandished his gleaming badge for the Marauders to see. Sirius rolled his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Guess they'll give the job to just about anyone these days!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily giggled at Sirius’ joke, enjoying the embarrassed grin plastered on her boyfriend's face.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The five Gryffindors were sitting in the drawing room of Potter Manor, discussing the upcoming school year. They had all just received their letters from Hogwarts, filled with book lists and necessary supplies. James and Lily each received an extra letter informing them of Dumbledore's choice in Head Boy and Head Girl. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I wonder why Moony didn't get the position… he was the Gryffindor prefect, after all…” Peter turned to Remus, expecting him to know the answer. Remus shrugged.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Iunno. Guess I'm not popular enough? Anyway, I'm still a prefect, it's not like I lose that or anything…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius had to suppress a grin as Remus spoke. He knew exactly why his boyfriend wasn't Head Boy, but he’d been sworn to secrecy. Padfoot promised to never tell anyone that Remus was chosen for the position before he turned it down. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I think Prongs'll make a good Head Boy. He'll make the rules and Moony'll enforce 'em!” Sirius chimed in playfully, wrapping his arm around Remus’ shoulders.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don't worry, Remus. I'll keep you safe,” Lily said, winking playfully.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius made a whip-cracking sound, accompanied by a gesture, resulting in Remus and Peter doubling over in laughter.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, like you're any better, Pads!” James said defensively, his face flushing. Remus gave a sarcastic laugh.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Ha...Yeah. I've got him </span>
  <em>
    <span>so </span>
  </em>
  <span>whipped. Wrapped around my little finger.” He rolled his eyes as Sirius laughed. “I can't keep my damn dog on his leash half the time!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“But you love me!” Sirius purred, nuzzling against Remus.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Sod off…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The five friends joked and teased, reveling in each other's company. This was the first time all summer that the Marauders were together, and the four of them had unanimously decided that Lily made an excellent addition. Although Remus wasn't ready to share his biggest secret with her, James’ girlfriend was welcomed into the group with open arms; the first time she relentlessly mocked James had solidified Sirius’ approval.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Man… I've missed this…” Peter sighed as the laughter began to die down. “I'm so ready for school to start…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Tell me about it…” Remus murmured under his breath. The full moon was fast approaching, and Remus was not looking forward to another night locked beneath his parents’ home. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“When school starts, though, it'll be our last year…” James said sullenly, looking around the group. He wasn't ready for their adventures to end. He wasn't ready to leave the family he had built.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So?” Everyone turned to look at Lily. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You don't get it, Evans. You're not a Marauder…” Sirius scoffed, realizing that Lily wasn't truly a member of their group.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What, you're gonna graduate and suddenly not be friends anymore? What kind of nonsense is that? Finishing Hogwarts means starting your </span>
  <em>
    <span>lives</span>
  </em>
  <span>! It means getting your first flat! Living together! Getting jobs, </span>
  <em>
    <span>real jobs</span>
  </em>
  <span>, that you </span>
  <em>
    <span>love</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” Lily turned to look at Sirius. “Leaving Hogwarts is just the beginning…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Nobody spoke; the boys all realized that Lily was right. Just because they graduated doesn't mean that they won't still be together.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I guess so…” Sirius eventually muttered. “I guess we'll always be friends… we'll always be Marauders…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily smiled at Sirius. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You and Remus could get a place together--”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Woah woah woah…” Remus put his hands up in the air, exaggerating his motions. “You think I wanna live with </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span> prat?!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Fuck off!” Sirius pushed his boyfriend playfully, still blushing from the notion of moving in with Remus. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And Lily and I could be your neighbours!” James joked playfully, squeezing his girlfriend and giving her a kiss on the cheek. Her face flushed bright red as she looked down at the floor.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“James, we've barely been together a month… I think that's a little presumptuous…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James smirked at the Marauders. They knew that he had every intention of marrying Lily; his entire life, he'd only had eyes for her.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So it's settled!” Sirius laid down on the couch and swung his legs up onto Remus’ lap, much to the werewolf's dismay. “Once we graduate, we'll all be neighbours or living together!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What about me?” Peter finally spoke up. No one had mentioned his name. Nobody said anything about wanting to live with him. He looked desperately at James, a pleading expression on his face. “Where… where will I live?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James smiled kindly at his friend. Since starting to date Lily, it had been hard to remember that their group no longer had even numbers. He had been making an effort to ensure that Peter felt included, and this situation was no exception.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Wormy, you'll be our flatmate! Lily and I in one room, you in another. That is, until you find a girl to move in with!” James grinned as Lily continued to blush. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Or a bloke. I don't judge…” Sirius teased, nudging his boyfriend with his heel.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Or a bloke!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Peter looked down at his hands, still unsatisfied with his friends’ responses. He hated that the Marauders were pairing off and dating. In his mind, it broke the group apart. James noticed Peter's expression and tried to change the subject.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oi, why don't we all stay here tonight? Wormy didn't get to come with on our muggle camp-out… why don't we light the fire and sleep in the den together?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily nodded, directing her attention to Peter.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah! We can all be in sleeping bags and everything! Indoor camping... I like it!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Peter shrugged.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, I guess… I'd have to ask Mum if that's alright…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“She'll be fine! She loves my parents!” James’ family was well-known in the wizarding community and Mrs. Pettigrew was ecstatic that her only son was friends with the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Potter Boy</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don't think my parents'll be too thrilled…” Remus knew his father would never let him spend a night out of the house this close to the full moon. He always got particularly cautious when the moon was a few nights away.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“We'll get Dad to talk to ‘im… I think it'll help to know you're with wizards…” James was trying to imply that if a werewolf related situation were to arise, there was an adult wizard capable of handling it. Lily raised an eyebrow at Remus, wondering what the boys were referring to.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Iunno, I guess…” Remus shifted slightly in his seat, trying to figure out what to say to Lily. “Dad just gets worried about my… </span>
  <em>
    <span>illness</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Especially since it's a magical thing, not a muggle thing…” Lily nodded in understanding, knowing not to press the issue. Remus’ </span>
  <em>
    <span>illness</span>
  </em>
  <span> or </span>
  <em>
    <span>condition</span>
  </em>
  <span> was an off-limits topic, and she wanted to respect his wishes.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So? We're all spending the night?” James leaned forward excitedly, looking to his friends for their nods of approval.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Let's do it!” Sirius put his fist up in the air and the others murmured their agreement. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Cool, I'll let Mum and Dad know!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James got up and went upstairs. When he was gone, Lily turned to the rest of the group.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey, you don't think he was serious about moving in with me, do you?” She spoke in a hushed whisper, trying not to let James hear.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No, Evans, </span>
  <em>
    <span>I'm</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius. He's </span>
  <em>
    <span>James</span>
  </em>
  <span>…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Shut up, Pads. Don't worry, Lily. He was probably just joking around.” Remus was lying, but he didn't want Lily to panic about James moving too fast. For a moment, Lupin thought he saw a flash of disappointment in her eyes, but it disappeared too quickly for him to be sure.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Good. Because that would be </span>
  <em>
    <span>ridiculous</span>
  </em>
  <span>, asking someone he just started dating to move in with him. It's such a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Potter </span>
  </em>
  <span>thing to do…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Padfoot grinned, digging his heels playfully into Moony. It </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> a very 'Potter’ thing to do.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James chose that moment to come back downstairs, five sleeping bags floating along behind him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“They say it's no problem. They'll even talk to Mr. Lupin for us!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Guess we're having a sleepover!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Evans, </span>
  <em>
    <span>chicks </span>
  </em>
  <span>have sleepovers. Guys just… hang out.” Lily rolled her eyes at Sirius as she stood up to help James magically move the couches and set up their sleeping area.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The five friends settled in and found their places around the fireplace. It was a warm summer night, so they didn't want the stifling heat from a muggle fire; Lily created a magical flame for the sake of atmosphere. Once they were all lying down, they chatted through the night, discussing classes, future pranks, new book lists, anything to do with their last year at Hogwarts. They were all excited, eager to return to school and the home that they created. The night trailed on and the talking died down as the group began to doze off.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Mmm… Wormy… maybe I'll talk to Marlene for you in September…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, Lils… that's a good idea… how does that sound Worms?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Peter didn't answer. He was already snoring. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Anyway… g'night boys…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“G'night, Lily…” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Night, Evans…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The room fell into near silence, the only sound was the crackling of magical flames. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius began to scooch over to Remus, wiggling his sleeping bag as he went. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What are you doing, Pads?” Lupin whispered.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It's been so long since we've spent a night together…” Sirius muttered, the mischief evident in his voice.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Sod off, Padfoot…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus could hear Lily's giggle from across the room.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“C'mon, Reme… I wanna fool around…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No, don't be an idiot.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius started to whine.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“C'mooon, Moons. It's been, like, two weeks since we've last seen each other.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Bugger off, Padfoot. Nobody wants to hear you!” James called from across the room, garnering another giggle from Lily.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Good night, Sirius.” Remus’ tone was final, leaving no room for argument. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius huffed and muttered under his breath.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Fine… night, Moons…” </span>
</p>
