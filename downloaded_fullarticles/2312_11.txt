    <p>It had been two months since Ron had packed his stuff and moved back into his parents' house. He felt humiliated as the rest of his siblings had flown the nest years ago, and so had he for two years. Hermione and Ron had moved in together after only a year of being in a relationship. He had no idea what they were thinking at the time but they were so in love, neither of them stopped to think what they had got themselves into. Hermione was even more surprised than Ron. She usually thinks with her head in situations like this but she was infatuated with the idea of spending her whole life with Ron, getting married, having children. She had never cared about this before until him. </p><p>The first week was almost like a dream. It was magical to go to sleep at night and wake up next to each other every day. They loved it. But things started to turn south rather quickly. Ron had never seen an issue with the way he did chores around the house. Or rather the way he <em>didn't </em>do them. He would either just use magic to wash the dishes, do laundry, fetch the mail, or just forget to do it altogether. He used Accio for pretty much everything which infuriated Hermione greatly.</p><p>She often used the silent treatment on him before Ron got irritated enough to ask her what was wrong. </p><p>"Oh, everything's fine Ronald." She only used his full name when she was pissed with him. "It's nothing."</p><p>Ron sighed audibly. "Hermione... stop doing that, I swear to Merlin. Just tell me what's bothering you."</p><p>"Oh, like you don't know!" She snapped, wheeling round to face him. "You're being lazy as usual, that's what!"</p><p>"Jesus, Hermione." Ron was used to her outbursts by now and he would retaliate but he had no energy for this today. It had been a long day at work. "What's wrong with using Accio for a few things?"</p><p>"I think you'll find it's more than a <em>few </em>things. I haven't seen you get up out of that chair for hours. And those dishes are still in the sink. They're still dirty."</p><p>"I'm tired, Mione. It's been a long day."</p><p>"Oh, I'm sure it's been a long day joking around with your brother in that stupid little shop of his. I'm sure it's so very tiring. Nothing compared to being the literal Minister for Magic!"</p><p>Something snapped in Ron's brain. He hated it when Hermione dug at George's joke shop like that. He thought she at least accepted the idea that he had a successful business and it was working for him. But ever since Fred died, Ron was very sensitive to Hermione's insults. "What did you just say?"</p><p>"You heard me," she raised her eyebrows, almost inviting him to yell at her.</p><p>"You don't fucking talk down to my brother like that!"</p><p>"I'll talk however I want."</p><p>"He's grieving!" Ron yelled so loud that Hermione was worried that the neighbours would hear. Not that it would be new to them that they had an arguing couple next door. "He lost his twin brother! And I lost my brother! I don't think you get to have an opinion on that, do you?"</p><p>Hermione fell quiet. Anger was still bubbling up inside her but she couldn't retort. She couldn't begin to understand how hard it was for Ron and George after losing Fred. She had lost her parents but at least they were still alive and she knew where they were. "I- I'm sorry."</p><p>"Yeah, of course you are. You always say that."</p><p>"So do you."</p><p>"Hermione, I'm too tired for this."</p><p>"Fine."</p><p>They didn't speak to each other for at least a few hours and Ron busied himself by doing the dishes by hand. Not to appeal to Hermione in any way but to just give him time to think. However blinded by love they both were, this couldn't carry on. They've had arguments almost every day about the same things over and over. He didn't know about Hermione but it was exhausting. He couldn't do it anymore.</p><p>After coming to an agreement, the two of them decided that they should take a break. Ron would move back to the Burrow and Hermione would stay in their apartment as she had nowhere else to go. Neither of them cried over it which possibly meant that this was the best decision for them both. Hermione called Harry after Ron had left and it was then that she started crying. She said she was a bad person, she was controlling, and she didn't deserve someone like Ron. Harry, used to being the therapist for his two best friends, told Hermione that Ron had his flaws too and they just weren't right for each other in this way.</p><p>"You're not a bad person, Hermione. Hell, I wouldn't still be friends with you if you were." Hermione laughed through the tears and Harry continued. "Sure, you are a bit controlling and you have very strong opinions on things but that isn't a bad thing. You just need to learn how to keep it to yourself sometimes. Just let things go."</p><p>"I guess you're right, Harry," Hermione sighed. "I just can't let things go though. It's really hard."</p><p>"Yeah, I know..." Harry still couldn't let go of the years he spent being used as bait for Voldemort and all the losses he has had to go through to come to this stage in his life. "Hey, how about you see a therapist? It's worked wonders for me."</p><p>"Hm, that might not be half bad. Thanks, Harry. You're the best."</p><p>"I know," he laughed. "Well, I gotta go, Hermione. Luke keeps tugging on my sleeve. I think he wants something."</p><p>"Okay," Hermione smiled. "I'd love to come visit someday. Luke is so cute."</p><p>"What about me?" Harry asked jokingly.</p><p>"You too, Harry. And Ginny. I haven't seen her for ages. Tell her I miss her, alright?"</p><p>"You got it. Okay, well, see ya Mione."</p><p>"Bye, Harry."</p><p>"Take care of yourself. I'd like to hear all about your therapy sessions when you next come round."</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>Hermione smiled to herself. Maybe things would get better for her. Finally.</p>
