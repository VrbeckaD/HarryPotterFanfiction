    <p align="left">The note was intriguing. Unsigned, from an owl he didn’t recognise, it just asked him to go to his local pub at five o’clock on Tuesday. Well, the rest of the gang weren’t around, so why the heck not, he thought. He was old enough for a legal drink, and he had the same right to sit in his local for a few hours nursing a pint or two as anyone else did.</p>
<p align="left">Because it was a Muggle area, he wasn’t sure who or what to expect, but he figured they’d be in Muggle attire. He wasn’t expecting the witch who came to speak to him to look so much like, really, a <em>witch</em>. Sure, she wasn’t wearing robes or the pointy hat, and she didn’t have her wand out, but there was still something distinctively <em>magical</em> about her.</p>
<p align="left">Peter fingered his wand underneath the table. There was a war on, after all, and he wasn’t really sure what to expect. What he was confident of, though, was that he would be able to defend himself. The gang had taught him enough to do that.</p>
<p align="left">Thinking about them, he wouldn’t have minded having one of them with him. James or Sirius, preferably. Remus was great, but he wasn’t as confident in himself as the others were and might panic in a fight.</p>
<p align="left">Kind of like Peter was.</p>
<p align="left">The witch saw Peter and made a beeline for his table, making subtle movements towards the tables nearby that he recognised as that white noise spell that Snape had come up with. He wondered how she knew it.</p>
<p align="left">“You came,” she said, her voice a little breathy, like she’d been running and wasn’t used to it.</p>
<p align="left">He kept hold of his wand. “Who are you?” he asked. “And what’s this about?”</p>
<p align="left">She smiled, a somewhat disconcerting smile. “Power,” she said.</p>
<p align="left">He was sceptical. “Power?”</p>
<p align="left">She nodded. “Power is a great thing, Peter. Something that is bestowed on great wizards.”</p>
<p align="left">“Oh.” He couldn’t hide his disappointment. “Then you’ve got the wrong person. I’m not great.” He picked up his half-empty pint and took a sip to mask the expression on his face.</p>
<p align="left">The woman was watching him. “I think not.”</p>
<p align="left">He shook his head. “You want power, you need to talk to James. Or Sirius. Look, did you want me to owl them or something?”</p>
<p align="left">“I need to talk to you, Peter Pettigrew. You have power. You just don’t realise it yet.”</p>
<p align="left">“Right.” He raised his eyebrows at her. “Go on. Tell me how I’m supposed to have power.”</p>
<p align="left">“You have all the elements we are looking for,” she said, that unnerving smile returning to her face. “A good mind. The ability to learn difficult tasks and perform complex spells. The trust of Albus Dumbledore.” She lowered her voice conspiratorially. “And, most important, the ability to go unnoticed.”</p>
<p align="left">He rolled his eyes. “Unnoticed? Yeah, that’s me.” He hadn’t meant to sound so bitter, but it was true. Everyone noticed James and Sirius. People even noticed Remus. But him? He was an afterthought, someone allowed to tag along but never invited in their own right. “But how does someone unnoticed have power? Isn’t that, like, an oxymoron?”</p>
<p align="left">He was proud of knowing that word. Proof he wasn’t as stupid as so many people thought. And, of course, he couldn’t be stupid, could he? He was an Animagus, after all. Not everyone was able to pull that kind of magic off when they were just in fifth year.</p>
<p align="left">The woman laughed. “But the unnoticed have all the power, Peter. Don’t you see? You can go anywhere and no one will tell you to leave. You can listen to any conversation and no one will move away to stop you overhearing. You can find out <em>anything.</em>”</p>
<p align="left">“And how is that useful?”</p>
<p align="left">She shook her head and looked at him fondly. “You still don’t get it, do you, Peter? We want you to become a spy.”</p>
<p align="left">“A spy?” He was still sceptical. “To spy on who?”</p>
<p align="left">She smiled again, and her face was changing as she did so; she had clearly taken some Polyjuice Potion that was wearing off. A haughty-looking woman was emerging, hooded eyes cold, lips painted the colour of blood.</p>
<p align="left">“Isn’t it obvious?” she asked, her long red fingernails caressing his arm. “We want you to spy on Albus Dumbledore.”</p>
