    <p>“Hayley, can I have a triple measure of my usual, please?”</p><p>I walked over to the dark-haired man who had become a sort of regular over the last few months. He had never asked for a triple measure, so of course I was curious. With my eyebrows raised, I reached for a bottle of the finest rum my uncle had in this pub, and walked over to Albus Potter. Albus was slouched on the stool with his head in his hands as I brought the bottle over. I let my eyes rake over his frame and tried to get a gauge of his mood.</p><p>“Triple? Do I dare ask why?” I asked, reaching for a large glass and pouring – a very generous – amount into the glass. I was purely guessing I had poured the right amount, I didn’t have time to actually measure the alcohol, but Albus didn’t seem to care as he reached for it before I could offer to put a mixer into it. He raised the glass up to his lips, downing half of it before coughing loudly and gagging at the taste.</p><p>I watched him in amusement.</p><p>“Oh god, why do other people make this look so fucking easy?” Albus spluttered in complaint as he wiped his mouth. I could see that his eyes were watering and took pity on the man in front of me, reaching for a carton of pineapple juice, and pouring it into the glass as well. I added a curly straw because I was nice, and I knew Albus would love it.</p><p>“Because they’re all alcoholics and have a taste for the stuff,” I replied, wiping the bar with my hand before leaning my elbows on it and watching Albus. He was reaching for the glass again, downing it quickly, and still wincing afterwards. Maybe I had poured too much in.</p><p>“It tastes like I’m going to die.”</p><p>“Then it’s working. What’s the problem that triple shots seemed to be the only answer?”</p><p>Albus just shook his head sadly, wiping the edges of his mouth with his fingers. I heaved a sigh, still leaning on the bar and staring at him as I waited for him to answer. It had been a slow day at the practically empty pub – and the only one on shift - I had nothing else to do with my time apart from wait for him to stop being difficult.</p><p>I wasn’t sure how much I could help, as I didn’t really know Albus aside from his regular appearances here, either with friends or on his own. He quickly became one of my regulars over the weeks, since a mutual friend named Clint Barker had introduced us to each other.</p><p>Our first meeting would forever be stuck in my mind, if only for the peculiar way in which he had introduced himself.</p><p>“Hi, I’m Albus Potter, and I’m gay,” Albus had told me straight away, slurring slightly as he thrust a hand out for me to shake. I had raised an eyebrow at him, before taking it and grasping it firmly.</p><p>“Hello, I’m Hayley Tretton and I’m fat.”</p><p>Albus had frowned at me, a questioning look puckering at his brow as he opened his mouth to – I assumed – ask why I had mentioned that.</p><p>“Sorry, I thought we were stating obvious facts about ourselves,” I replied to him.</p><p>He laughed loudly at that and it had broken the ice between us, he admitted later that night that I was the first person he had properly come out to, and he just got excited about it.</p><p>I didn’t really put much thought into if I would ever see him again, but he ended up becoming a semi-regular patron here, one that I didn’t mind serving. He was never rude, a hilarious drunk, and a great tipper. It was why I actually cared when he seemed upset. Like right now.</p><p>“Just tell me, and maybe I could help you out with it,” I suggested, “instead of moping around here for a while, getting drunk off Ebenezer’s Golden Rum, and becoming so sloshed that you tell me anyway. We can avoid the middleman all together and then you can go back to drinking your pain away.”</p><p>Albus deliberated for a while, playing with the empty glass in front of him and I wanted to shake him for being dramatic.</p><p>“My cousin is getting married to my best friend next weekend.”</p><p>“What a whore.”</p><p>Albus snorted, green eyes flicking up to meet mine, before shaking his head slowly.</p><p>“You don’t even know her. But, it’s a correct assumption.”</p><p>“Was that not the end of the story?” I asked, watching as the only other customer left the building. I glanced down at my watch and saw that it was half an hour until closing, and made the executive decision to close the pub. I pulled my wand from my pocket, waving it in the direction of the door so that it would lock itself, and the sign in the window would turn to state that we were closed.</p><p>“Far from the end of the story,” Albus told me, a heavy sigh escaping his lips. “I have been in love with my best friend since I was sixteen, and I thought that maybe he felt the same way, but neither of us made any kind of move. He began dating my cousin Rose and it wasn’t long before they were engaged and planning their wedding.”</p><p>Well, that situation seems fucked up, no wonder Albus is miserable.</p><p>“Huh, that seems like quite a pickle.”</p><p>Albus snorted again.</p><p>“That’s not the kicker. I’m best man at the wedding.”</p><p>Now, that was worse than I imagined.</p><p>“You’re the best man at the wedding of the man you’re in love with?” This was all kinds of fucked up, it was like one of those problems you read about in the ‘Dear Trelawney’ pages of the Prophet. You don’t believe that any of the nonsense written is real, but you’re entertained that someone’s life could be that pathetic. Albus’ life would probably win the five Galleon prize that the paper offered.</p><p>Albus nodded, noticing that I was pulling a face at his words. “Don’t look at me like that. My cousin Rose is a horrible and evil person, and doesn’t deserve someone as wonderful as Scorpius.”</p><p>“I’m not judging if you say she’s a horrible person I believe you.” I held my hands up in defence, I felt sorry for him, but I was judging him a tiny bit. Was his cousin that bad a person?</p><p>He downed his drink, pushing the glass away from him and running a hand over his pale face. “Not only do I have to watch the love of my life possibly marry the worst person in the world, I also have to deal with my family – who still don’t know I’m gay – realise that I don’t have the girlfriend that I had been telling them about for months.”</p><p>This story was just getting better! It was like a train wreck waiting to happen. It was turning into one of those clichéd novels that I read continuously. They were my guilty pleasure, and I wasn’t sure how I was going to cope with having a real life one just within my grasp that I couldn’t be a part of! I needed to go to this wedding.</p><p>“Do you actually have a girlfriend?” I asked, hoping that I didn’t sound too hopeful. He would think I was weird.</p><p>“No, I made her up because they wouldn’t get off my case about being single. I didn’t want them to keep setting me up with all of these women.” The hope was building in my chest, but how could I go about telling him that I should be this fake girlfriend?</p><p>“You could always tell them that you’re gay. They might stop,” I suggested, moving away from where I stood to pick up a cloth and attempt to clean the side. I couldn’t just stay in here all night without doing something, my uncle wouldn’t be happy when he opened up in the morning.</p><p>“Or, they could just start setting me up with men instead. I don’t want that. I don’t want to even come out to them yet, I’m not ready at all.” It was a statement that I found weird considering how quickly he came out to me, who was a stranger at the time. However, confession to a stranger was probably a lot easier than telling a family member. It was bizarre to think he was hiding it when I’ve only ever seen him be open about it.</p><p>“Does anyone know that you’re gay?” I asked him, wondering how he had been able to keep the information from his family. It made me sad that there was possibly no one that he was close to that knew.</p><p>“Just my brother James, he’s known for a while.”</p><p>“He must be a good brother if he hasn’t spilled the beans on you.”</p><p>“He is he’s the best. He got me through the major panic attack I had when I realised that I was in love my best friend.”</p><p>I placed my cloth down on the side, unsure what to say in reply to that, but thankful that his brother seemed like a decent person.</p><p>“I just don’t know what I’m going to do,” Albus put his head in his hands again as I refilled his drink, grabbing for a glass to pour one for myself before I waved my wand to clean around us. “They’re going to realise when I don’t turn up with anyone.”</p><p>“You could always tell them that you’ve broken up with her.” It seemed like an easy thing to do, it would save a lot of hassle. Although, I couldn’t help but plead in my head that he would ask me. I wonder if I could give him a look to show that I was interested. Was there even a look for that? Was it a smoulder? Should I pout?<br/>Wait, Albus was talking again. I tried to keep my face neutral even though I wanted to shake him and demand he take me to be his girlfriend.</p><p>“- Then they would try setting me up at the wedding, and my cousin Roses’ friends are horrible people – just like her. Rose will also take this as me trying to ‘upstage’ her wedding if I announce that I’ve broken up with this woman that no one has ever met.“</p><p>“I’ll do it,” I offered quickly before I could stop myself. I jumped up onto the bar to sit down; he looked up at me so quickly I was worried that he had cricked his neck. “I’ll pretend to be your girlfriend.”</p><p>“I couldn’t ask you to do that,” he replied quickly, shaking his head as he looked at me, but I could see the pleading in his eyes. I was fucking in there! I was going to make sure I would get front row seats to this.</p><p>“You didn’t ask me, I offered,” I told him, shifting where I sat on the bar, moving my feet up so that they weren’t in the way of the mop that was cleaning the floor behind the bar.</p><p>“Would you really do that for me? You don’t even know me.”</p><p>Would it be rude if I broke out into a wide grin right now?</p><p>“What is there to know? You’re Albus Potter, you drink in the pub I work at, and you need my help.”</p><p>Albus looked up at me, his eyes wide with sadness and an adorable puppy dog look on his face that I knew would end up being the downfall of his future boyfriend. If I hadn’t already agreed to do this, I would have given in on that look alone.</p><p>“It’s for the entire weekend; it’s not just one night, Hayley.”</p><p>Score! I was getting a weekend away. I was coming out of this deal a winner.</p><p>“I’ve already agreed, Albus, you don’t need to try and entice me anymore. You’ve made the sale!”</p><p>“You make it sound like I’ve brought you.”</p><p>I went silent for a while, realising that this does make it seem like he’s hired me and wondering if this makes me sound like a prostitute.</p><p>“It’s not going to be a fun weekend, it’s all going to go to shit, and I’m warning you now. I can give you money for doing this; you’re going to miss work.”</p><p>“Honey,” I said placing my hand on his arm and squeezing it in reassurance. “This wedding is going to be the biggest train wreck I’ve ever seen. As long as you get me front row tickets, I will do it for a slice of wedding cake.”</p><p>Albus smirked. “I can definitely get you a slice of cake.”</p>
