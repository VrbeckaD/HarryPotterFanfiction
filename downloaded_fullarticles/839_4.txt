    <p>The Order of the Phoenix’s headquarters travels around, ever since Grimmauld Place was made unusable with Snape’s betrayal. It’s probably safer than having one place to meet in, but it’s definitely a pain in the arse, having to figure out the encrypted coordinates to the newest safe-house and the password to allow himself in. Charlie, who is always exhausted these days, can’t quite appreciate the value of the added security when all he wants to do is sit down and have a cuppa and close his eyes and turn off his brain—<em>after</em> reporting in, of course.</p>
<p></p><div>
  <p>He hates the war.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Well, nobody <em>enjoys</em> war, unless you're completely mad, which he isn’t. But the war is bloody awful. A long and grim slog through suspicion and murk and fear that never quite goes away. He never thought you could be unendingly afraid. He thought it was something that, like other emotions, one could get used to, so that it lost its grip on you. But this war has taught him that fear has many faces, and many claws, and never lets you go. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>And the bloody <em>waiting</em>. What he wouldn’t give for some <em>action</em>, instead of skulking around and spying and speaking cryptically with maybe-allies, maybe-traitors, maybe-refugees, maybe-Death Eaters, and everyone in between. He misses being free to say whatever he bloody well thought. He misses the greatest threat to his life being accidentally getting roasted to a crisp by a dragon, rather than torture and death, the torture and death of someone he loves or knows, and the fall of the Wizarding World as he knows it. At least dragons make sense. At least dragons are never less than what they appear to be—dangerous, beautiful, worthy of respect and care and admiration. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Merlin, he's tired. But he’s reported in to Kingsley, and he’s not being sent out immediately, so he makes his way to the kitchen. The house is quiet. It’s very late—or really early, depending on how you look at it. Mum and Dad are asleep at the Burrow, the other Order members in the safe house are either out, talking to Kingsley over the latest information gathered by Charlie and others like him, or sleeping. Or drinking. Or shagging. Those are the three most popular options, these days.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>So it's a bit of an unwelcome surprise to find someone in the kitchen already. Charlie doesn't want to talk. He doesn't want to smile at anyone and make nice, like Mum raised him to do, doesn’t want to see anyone or be seen by anyone and have to—have to be a decent person rather than a lump on a log like he wants to be. The girl—woman, he corrects himself, when she turns around at his entering, she can't be much younger than him—is Asian and pretty and unfamiliar, which altogether means nothing, ultimately.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>She's <em>there</em>, which is enough to make him want to frown. He stifles it with difficulty. Isn’t her fault, that he doesn’t want to see anyone. She has a right to the kitchen, same as him. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“‘Lo,” he grunts, eyeing the cup in her slender hands. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I made tea,” she says, her voice quiet and soft. “Want some?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He nods and she summons a wand with an elegant wave of her wand and pours him a cup of tea that smells heavenly, just then, and then hands it to him. Their hands brush—her hands are cold, for all that the mug she’s holding is steaming. She sits at the table, stares down at her mug, and apparently dismisses him entirely from his thoughts.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He doesn’t mind at all, sits himself, across from her, and sips at his tea. It’s perfect—not too sweet, not too strong, definitely not the weak swill he’s been making do with lately. HE sighs in appreciation and she blinks, glances his way, but doesn’t say anything. For a long while, they sit there and drink and don’t say anything, and Charlie feels himself unwind slowly, as the heat of the tea permeates the parts of him that have gone all knotted and icy in ways that, he’s sure, are entirely metaphorical but certainly feel physical. And because he’s enjoying not thinking, he lets himself idly study the witch across from him.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>She’s quite pretty, in an undeniable but quiet way. Round faced, rosebud mouth, dark eyes, dark-lashes, and glorious hair, glossy and dark as her eyes, draped over her shoulder and escaping from its loose plait in fine strands. Her hands are pretty too, fine boned and long-fingered. But not soft—there are tiny scars over the back of one hand, visible calluses on the inside of the other palm where it lies slightly uncurled on the tabletop. She’s a worker, this woman, whoever she is. He takes in the slight slump of her shoulders, the shadows under her eyes.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>She looks at him then, and he doesn’t look away, lets himself be caught staring. She doesn’t look away either, studies him in return, which is only fair. He wonders what she sees, what conclusions she comes too. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“You’re Charlie Weasley,” she says.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He nods, not quite up to speaking just yet, and downs the last of his tea, letting it slide in a rush down his throat and spread through his chest.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Bill has scars, and everybody knows the twins. Penelope was dating Percy, so I saw them together quite a lot. He was always in our tower—never seemed to want to be seen around the Gryffindors. Ron was Harry’s friend. And Ginny’s the only girl.” She says all this without any sort of inflection, like she’s just remarking on the weather, and where it might have come across as rude or abrupt from someone else just sounds…casual from her. An observation.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I’ve no idea who you are,” Charlie says, amused and vaguely charmed by this explanation of how she knows him through the process of elimination.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Cho Chang,” she says. She stands fluidly, takes his empty mug from his hands after a questioning glance and sets them both in the sink. A quick incantation later and they’ve washed and put themselves away to dry.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Good night,” she says, and leaves just like that, nothing more said. </p>
</div><div>
  <p><em>Huh</em>, thinks Charlie. </p>
</div>
