          <div class="userstuff"><p>“DAD! DAD! DAD! DAD! DAD!” </p><p>“Oooof, that’s Daddy’s tummy, son!” Harry groaned as Orion leapt onto him knees first.</p><p>“BUT IT’S CHRISTMAS!!! PRESENTS! PRESENTS! PRESENTS!” Each word was punctuated by a painful bounce, and Harry struggled to breathe.</p><p>“He’s your problem, Potter.” Draco rolled over and tried to bury himself under the covers.</p><p>“With that load of gifts under the tree? I’m sorry, love. You’re the one that spoils him. You have to suffer too.”</p><p>“DAAAAAAAD!” Orion launched himself across to his father, “Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!”</p><p>As his son pulled the blankets off his face Draco glared at him and said, “‘Rion! What is the first rule about Malfoys?”</p><p>Orion sat back on his heels, rolled his eyes, and recited,  “Malfoy’s are dignified, respectable, and always in control.”</p><p>“Good, I love you. Please lie down and wait quietly for your daddies to wake up.” Draco buried himself back under the covers with a huff.</p><p>“Ri? What is the first rule about Potters?” Harry smirked. </p><p>“Annoy Malfoys!” And with that, two Potters attacked.</p><p>“POTTER, I SWEAR!!!!” </p><p>Draco found himself drowned in dark hair and kisses by his family.</p><p>“I...want…” he breathed out trying to maintain a scowl and failing miserably as he giggled, “to see this…rule!” Draco was breathless as his husband and son tickled him. “OK! You Win!”</p><p>“Stand down, son,” Harry winked at ‘Rion. “Why don’t you run down and put the kettle on. Dad and I will be down as soon as I find my glasses and we grab our slippers.” </p><p>‘Rion ran down the stairs as quick as a flash, squealing and excited to see what Father Christmas brought him.</p><p>“No peeking till we get there, mind!” Draco called after him. “You are terrible, Harry. Also, I don’t remember this first rule about Potters…You are clearly corrupting our son.” he grumbled.</p><p>Harry kissed him. “Oh! Do you not? I’m fairly certain I wrote it into our vows. I’ll have to try to find it. I could read it to you if you want?”</p></div>
