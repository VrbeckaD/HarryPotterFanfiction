  <strong>HARRY</strong>
</p>
<p>“I just feel so <em>horrible</em>,” Draco said, making sure his voice carried so that Harry, Ron and Hermione could hear it all the way across the Great Hall, “For the students who have to stay here over spring break because they’re not <em>wanted</em> at home.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Like anyone would want to go to your home, Malfoy,” Harry muttered. “No one wants to watch your father drink mimosas and impulse-buy expensive art.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron snorted into his pudding, but Hermione pulled a face. “Why do you let Malfoy get to you, Harry? It’s not like he’s coming up with anything new.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That’s what I’m saying!” Harry protested, his voice at a normal volume now. “Voldemort’s dead, we’re all back at Hogwarts, and he’s still on. The same. <em>Bullshit</em>.”</p>
<p>           </p>
<p> “You always have to have a problem with Malfoy.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked at her incredulously. “He tried to kill all of us! Several times!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And he also saved your life!” Hermione’s left hand twitched, and Harry knew she was thinking of the <em>Mudblood </em>scar carved into her skin, one which no amount of potions and elixirs had ever managed to remove entirely. “Maybe it’s time to put all this aside.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fat chance, Hermione,” Ron mumbled around a mouthful of kippers. “Malfoy’s a whiny little bitch, and always has been.” He took a massive swallow and continued. “I wouldn’t put it past him to finish his master’s little mission posthumously.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m shocked you know what posthumous means, though since you’re using it incorrectly, it really can’t be helped.” Hermione said nastily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Can the two of you stop bickering? I’d like some peace and quiet.” Harry glared down at his pancakes. A part of him looked forward to spending the break alone, but the other part wanted to listen to Ron and Hermione bicker some more.</p>
<p>It would be so lonely without them. He wasn’t sure he could handle all that silence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron and his family were doing a retreat, a personal trip to talk about ‘family matters.’</p>
<p>Harry knew it was about Fred’s death, reconciling with Percy, trying to heal from all of the wounds that were still fresh after Voldemort’s defeat, even though it had been nearly a year. But it still stung when Ron had awkwardly said he wasn’t invited—the Weasleys had always considered Harry family before, what was so different now?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s just that Mum—she doesn’t want you to feel guilty. And I know you will.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well-it was for me that Fred died.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No it wasn’t. It was for all of us. For a better future.” Ron repeated the words his therapist had taught him with the same monotone voice Harry had come to recognize.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry’s therapist had told him that it would take time for his friends to fully forgive him. That even though they knew it wasn’t his fault, the link between him and their dead family members would remain. It was an invisible line, tethering him to their loved ones. For a while, all they’d see was the death he’d brought.</p>
<p>“It’s not that they think it’s your fault, or they blame you.” She said. “It’s just that grief can be irrational.”</p>
<p>“I don’t blame them,” Harry colored in the picture they’d given him, keeping his eyes down. “I <em>am </em>responsible.”  </p>
<p>“The survivor’s guilt is normal, too. But there is no way of knowing if your choices would have kept more or less people alive. You defeated Voldemort in the end, and the Wizarding World is at peace. That is what matters.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So Harry hadn’t protested when Ron had explained the Weasleys’ plans. He hadn’t pushed Ginny when she’d said she needed time, time to be by herself and work through the trauma she’d experience fighting the Death Eaters at Hogwarts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He hadn’t even looked disappointed when, after Hermione had heard that Ron was going off with his family, she’d tentatively stated that she wanted a holiday away with her parents as well. “We always wanted to go to Italy as a family,” she’d said, “We’ve never been. Now seems like a good time, since—”</p>
<p>“They aren’t Obliviated in Australia for their own protection,” Harry said harshly.</p>
<p> When would he stop feeling the cost of this war? When would he stop seeing all the lives he had interrupted, all the families he had torn apart?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Voldemort tore them apart. </em>He reminded himself. <em>I just stopped him. </em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>But sometimes he wondered what might have gone differently that day on the Hogwarts Express, if Ron hadn’t sat in his compartment. What might have changed, had he taken Draco’s hand? Would he still have so many people to burden? Would he have been better off with the Dursleys, who’d never have done a thing for him?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Would Fred still be alive?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione’s phone dinged, and she swiped across to check it. “Corona virus has spread to the UK” she said aloud. “Well, we already knew that.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Surely wizards have a cure for this sort of thing,” Harry had heard about the virus from Hermione, but most of the students sneered at Muggle technology, and were woefully uninformed on non-Wizarding current events. Only the Muggleborns really kept in touch, but Harry got the impression that their reiteration of Muggle News hardly earned them social points.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even though Voldemort’s followers were imprisoned or dead, and Shacklebolt had announced a new era of resistance to the prejudices of the old regime, the ideas Voldemort had helped to perpetuate still remained in some capacity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“From what I understand, most wizards are naturally immune to Muggle diseases. But these travel advisories will be particularly inconvenient.” She drummed her fingers on the table. “I wonder if I could cast some sort of protective charm on Mum and Dad,” she mused. “Perhaps the library…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s probably not that big of a deal,” Ron said. “The Muggles will find a solution eventually. It won’t affect <em>us.”</em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>Harry looked down the table to a group of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor first-years. They were typing away frantically on their phones, looking anxious. One of them coughed, and the others all jumped, looking around nervously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry felt a strange sense of foreboding curdle in his stomach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Potter!”</p>
<p>Harry knew that voice anywhere, even though he wished he didn’t. “What do you want, Malfoy?”</p>
<p>“My mum wants to know if you’d come home for Spring Break. A chance to toast the hero and all. We know you’re <em>all alone </em>for the holiday.” He bit off the end of the sentence, and Harry didn’t doubt that he was mocking him. The way Malfoy told the story of that final duel, Harry had essentially gotten in on pure luck.</p>
<p>He was somewhat right, but that didn’t stop him from being infuriating.</p>
<p>“Why? Is she tired of having a coward for a son?” Harry rose to his feet, clenching his fists at his sides. “Does she want to trade you for a son who doesn’t run away at the first sign of a fight?”</p>
<p>“How dare you—"</p>
<p>“Potter. Malfoy. My office. Now.” McGonagall appeared at their sides, her hair swept into its usual austere bun.</p>
<p>“Professor, we weren’t—“Malfoy began.</p>
<p> “I would rather neither of you waste my time with dishonesty.  I have known the two of you far too long to not know a duel when I see one. My office. <em>Now.”</em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>McGonagall’s office, the Headmistress’s Office, always left Harry with a pang of repressed memory. The late nights ensconced here with Dumbledore, sifting through clues for the Horcruxes. The night Voldemort had returned, and he’d told the details of the encounter to Dumbledore in excruciating detail…the attack on Mr. Weasley that Harry had thought was his doing, only to learn later that Voldemort had seen it as an opportunity to manipulate him…when he’d thrown all the instruments across the room after Sirius’ death, doing whatever he could to quiet the roaring inside of him…</p>
<p>McGonagall had shared the password with him (“Fawkes”) at the beginning of the year, but he wasn’t interested in reliving all of those memories. He just wanted to have a normal year at Hogwarts, for once. He just wanted to be a first year again, where his biggest problems were Snape giving him bad marks on his Potions exam and winning the next Quidditch match.</p>
<p>But there was no going back.</p>
<p>And the office did have small changes. There was the portrait of Dumbledore, snoozing delicately in a high-backed chair. The Order of Merlin, First Class, which Minister Shacklebolt had bestowed upon McGonagall for her courage at the Battle of Hogwarts (McGonagall never polished it; she had been so disgusted with the Ministry’s initial response to Voldemort’s return that Kingsley had to practically beg her to accept it in the first place), the Sword of Gryffindor in its crystal case, and a few portraits of cats that gamboled about good-naturedly, hunting various squirrels and birds through the paintings, the antithesis of the sicky sweet kittens that had adorned Umbridge’s office.</p>
<p>McGonagall conjured two severe-looking, high backed chairs. “Sit.”</p>
<p>Harry and Malfoy sat, neither looking at the other.</p>
<p>“The war is over.” McGonagall said.</p>
<p>“No thanks to him,” Harry muttered.</p>
<p>Draco opened his mouth furiously, but McGonagall interrupted him. “Mr. Malfoy’s testimony put a good many of his associates in prison. And I seem to recall that he played a vital role in your defeat of Voldemort.”</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. Malfoy was an opportunistic weasel, and always had been. McGonagall was mad if she didn’t know that.</p>
<p>“You are both poised to be leaders of the community, following your graduation from this school. Potter, you have already expressed your ambition to become an Auror. And Malfoy, Professor Slughorn tells me that you have a talent for politics.”</p>
<p><em>For wheedling his slimy way out of his own messes, </em>Harry thought. No matter what McGonagall said, he considered it an absolute injustice that Malfoy wasn’t serving time in a jail cell right now.</p>
<p>He hadn’t forgotten that night on the lightning struck tower. Malfoy had lowered his wand, but he’d let the Death Eaters into the castle. And Dumbledore had fallen and broken, like a doll. All that brilliance and wit, thwarted because he’d chosen to believe the good in someone who didn’t deserve it.</p>
<p>McGonagall had accused Harry of being too suspicious of Malfoy; everyone had. And look where it had led them.</p>
<p>McGonagall seemed to have guessed the nature of Harry’s thoughts, because she gave a deep sigh before continuing. “You could do a great deal more good if you worked together. The war is over, and we are on the same side. Are we not, Mr. Malfoy?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Professor.”</p>
<p>“Good. Mr. Potter?”</p>
<p>Harry bit his lip. Who was she to lecture him like a child, after what he’d done? He could probably walk into the Auror office now and be handed a job, why did he even bother—</p>
<p>“Potter, do not disappoint me.” Her voice had that edge to it, and Harry found himself agreeing before he could stop himself, “Yes, Professor McGonagall.”</p>
<p>“Good.” McGonagall sat back. “Now, over the break—”</p>
<p>“Minerva! Sorry to interrupt—” it was Neville Longbottom, his round face anxious. “I have some information to share with you. He was holding an iPhone, and he looked drawn and anxious.</p>
<p>McGonagall surveyed Harry and Malfoy, calculating. “Very well. Enjoy your break. You may go.”</p>
<p>“What’s up?” Harry asked Neville as he walked in and took the seat Malfoy had just vacated.</p>
<p>“This corona virus.” Neville looked from McGonagall to Harry and back again, clearly unsure how much he should divulge. “It’s spreading.”</p>
<p>“So? Muggle diseases can’t bother wizards, right?”</p>
<p>Neville gulped. “Well, that’s the thing—it’s—spreading to the wizarding community. Several members of Puddlemere United have fallen ill after visiting a local pub.</p>
<p>“But that’s impossible.”</p>
<p>“The Center for Magical Diseases and Infections thought so too,” Neville said, “But it’s happening. Kingsley has ordered the school to send children home. Immediately. “</p>
<p>McGonagall sighed, running a hand across her face. “Very well. I will send a message to the students’ families that they can be expected tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>“Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey are working on administering immune boosters, but it looks like it won’t be enough for everyone. We’ll have to give it to the first years first.”</p>
<p>McGonagall was already writing. As they watched, she signed with a flourish, then waved her wand. The message disappeared in a cloud of flame.</p>
<p>“What about students who are staying here?” Harry asked, ignoring the mocking glance Malfoy shot him. “Where will we go?”</p>
<p>“You should be fine here within a limited population,” Neville said.</p>
<p>“Hogwarts will always be a safe place,” McGonagall agreed. “Though I can’t imagine families won’t want to see their children now more than ever. Has anyone—how severe are the symptoms?”</p>
<p>“The old and the immunocompromised are having the hardest time with it,” Neville said. “The casualties are--concerning.”</p>
<p>Draco stiffened, but said nothing.</p>
<p>“We ought to prepare for the worst. Gather the teachers here, and you may stay as Head Boy. Potter and Malfoy, you are dismissed, and not a word to anyone.”</p>
<p>“Professor, if I might have a word?” Malfoy looked curiously flushed, his eyes bright in the light. “I have a request to make of you.”</p>
<p>“Can it wait?”</p>
<p>“No, Professor.”</p>
<p>McGonagall eyed him for a moment. “Very well. Potter, back to the Gryffindor dormitory. And do not repeat everything you heard in this room. The last thing we want is for students to panic, is that clear?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Professor.”</p>
<p>Harry left, his mind racing.</p>
<p>What was this new disease? How dangerous was it? And what would happen to the school if it continued?</p>
<p><em>We didn’t close when there was a basilisk roaming the halls, </em>Harry thought. <em>Surely they won’t close because of this. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, Harry told everything to Ron and Hermione.</p>
<p>            They’d been able to handle the secret of Voldemort’s immortality. Harry was pretty sure they could deal with the spread of a virus.</p>
<p>            “Looks like we’re cancelling our trips, then.” Ron glanced at Harry. “Do you want to come home with me?”</p>
<p>            “Or me,” Hermione interrupted.</p>
<p>            “No, it’s fine.” Harry felt curiously adrift from the both of them. He’d already accepted that he’d be spending the break alone, and he wasn’t sure if he was ready to change everything. Ready to face the Weasleys, who were supposed to be spending the holiday grieving. Or Hermione’s parents, who wanted only to reconnect with the daughter they’d thought hadn’t existed for nearly a year…</p>
<p>            The Dursleys had already sent him a note, “<em>Virus spreading. DON’T COME HOME.” </em>Which might have been touching had it not been for the fact that they were probably more concerned with their own self-preservation than his own.</p>
<p>            “I’d rather be here, anyway. You know that.” Harry was sort of looking forward to his time alone. At least he’d be able to visit Dumbledore’s grave in private, without a thousand eyes watching him. He could sneak down to the kitchens and see if the house-elves would let him experiment with a few recipes (he’d gotten very into cooking these last few months; it was a side effect of a childhood spent with food scarcity)…</p>
<p>            “I have some studying to catch up on,” Harry said, which made Hermione pull a skeptical face. “Really! I’m so behind!”</p>
<p>            “Harry, you saved the Wizarding World. It’s not like they’re going to fail you. Besides, what if this thing lasts long? You don’t want to be here by yourself!” Ron was more earnest than the situation demanded, and Harry knew that he just still felt bad about uninviting him to his family’s.</p>
<p>            “No, there’s no need to derail your plans over me. Really.” Harry forced a smile against the heaviness that descended in his chest. “Just write to me, okay?”</p>
<p>            Hermione touched the back of his hand with hers, a gesture they’d gotten into after Ron left, a way of checking in with the other. <em>I’m here, </em>the touch said. <em>Are you okay?</em></p>
<p>            Harry tapped the back of her knuckles. <em>No, but I’m going to be fine. </em></p>
<p><em>            </em>He turned back to Ron’s chess game. “Come on. Let’s play.”</p>
<p>            “I don’t know why the two of you bother with this.” Hermione wrinkled it nose. “It’s absolutely barbaric.”</p>
<p>            “You’re just upset because I’m better than you!” Ron smirked, directing one of his knights to begin beating up Harry’s bishop.</p>
<p>            “How did Malfoy react?” Hermione asked suddenly. “Learning that wizards are susceptible to a Muggle disease must be the Ninth Circle of Hell for him and his family.”</p>
<p>            Harry shrugged. He hadn’t really thought about Malfoy. Any more than usual. Today.</p>
<p>            Malfoy <em>had</em> seemed anxious at first, but that could have been anything. He probably just hated being in Harry’s presence. Harry was pretty sure that they were allergic to each other. Having Malfoy’s eyes on him too much always made him itch. Even looking at his dot on the Marauder’s Map did it—like the hatred was yawning across their entire magical distance. He was so <em>irritating. </em></p>
<p>            “I bet he’ll lock his doors and stay inside, and set one of those ridiculous peacocks on the Muggle postman.” Harry said. “Maybe he won’t come back at all.”</p>
<p>            “A Hogwarts without Malfoy,” Ron said. “What a lovely thought.”</p>
<p>            And Harry couldn’t explain the twinge in his chest when Ron said that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <strong>***</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>DRACO</strong>           </p>
<p>Draco didn’t speak until Longbottom had left the room, casting a suspicious glance over his shoulder as he went. The last thing he needed was <em>Longbottom </em>telling tales.</p>
<p>“Professor, I am concerned about the virus. With my mother’s illness—”</p>
<p>            McGonagall tipped her head to the side. “What are you suggesting, exactly?”</p>
<p>            “Is there a chance I can stay home after break—I don’t want to have to isolate from my own family—”</p>
<p>            He could see McGonagall tuning him out as he went on.</p>
<p>He didn’t know why he bothered. None of the teachers ever took any of his requests seriously.</p>
<p>            Never mind that his mother was pale and sickly, red splotches standing out along her skin. Her Healers never left her room with anything but somber expressions, and his father—</p>
<p>            His father didn’t leave her side, didn’t say a word to Draco. Just kept her thin hand between his own, watching her every breath and movement like he was afraid they were her last.</p>
<p>            Truthfully, Draco had been glad to go to Hogwarts for the spring semester. He hated being in the house when they were like that. It was as though he were intruding on the living dead.</p>
<p>            And he hated himself for feeling that way.</p>
<p>            Apparently, his mother’s condition was genetic, so they thought he might develop symptoms, especially if he was exposed to her. Something about magical immune systems and the transfer of antibodies, other jargon Malfoy never bothered to listen to.</p>
<p>            It never mattered to him how to Heal. He knew he would only ever be good for the opposite.</p>
<p>            It was all such a fucking joke. His parents needn’t worry. No disease, magical or otherwise, would ever affect him again.</p>
<p>            Voldemort had made him a vampire against his will, in the final moments of the Battle of Hogwarts. The Dark Lord had been raving in the Forbidden Forest, his mind already half-broken from the destruction of his Horcruxes, waiting frantically for Potter to arrive, and he’d wanted ‘a bit of fun.’</p>
<p>            Malfoy had tried to run,  but Sanguini was so fast.</p>
<p>            He’d looked into those liquid eyes and it had all faded to blackness.</p>
<p>            And when he’d woken, he was so…hungry.</p>
<p>            And now he had to stay in a huge population, just to blend in, just to make sure no one came after him with wooden stakes or pitchforks, fake it and smile and act like everything was fine for the rest of his immortal existence.</p>
<p>            It was exhausting to pretend to be better than your nature; it was why he’d joined the Death Eaters in the first place. Not betraying Potter had made his skin crawl.</p>
<p>Being a vampire only amplified what had always been there.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy was finally the monster he always knew he’d be.</p>
<p>            His mind flashed to those first few moments on the battlefield—he’d turned suddenly on a crowd of Death Eaters, nobodies, expendable to Voldemort and everyone else, useless fodder for the armies.</p>
<p>            He’d thought no one would notice.</p>
<p>            But Aunt Bellatrix was always drawn to the smell of blood.</p>
<p>            “You could learn a thing or two from Greyback,” she chortled when she found him, guzzling at the neck of one of the Death Eaters, their blood staining the front of his collar. “He knows how to kill without being too messy.” She flicked her wand, and the body slumped against him, dead.</p>
<p>            Draco pushed it away in disgust.</p>
<p>“Don’t act so scandalized!” Bellatrix. “The sooner you embrace your nature, the easier it will be.”</p>
<p>“No! I—I won’t.”</p>
<p>But Bellatrix only laughed, that laugh turning into a snarl as she spotted more enemies ahead.</p>
<p> When he was certain that she’d left, he bent his head to the man’s neck and  drank again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            He couldn’t help it. It had to be human blood; nothing else worked. He’d even tried a few rats, a deer, a bear. Nothing else satisfied him.</p>
<p>            Eventually, he’d managed to control it. He’d snuck the books up to his room, the ones from the depths of his father’s library, done even more research at Hogwarts. He knew the rules: spell a piece of jewelry to walk in the Sun. Don’t get too upset, or your fangs will show. Stay in big populations, where you won’t be noticed. Replenish the blood when you’re done. Wipe their memory. Heal the bitemarks. Disappear.</p>
<p>            He’d even raided a few Muggle hospitals, and he still had some bags stashed in a refrigerated, concealed section of his trunk. A simple Undetectable Extension Charm, and he had enough blood to last him weeks.</p>
<p>            Only, he was near to running out. He’d been planning to raid a few Muggle hospitals over the break, but now…</p>
<p>            “Is there any chance I’ve been exposed to it?” Draco asked.</p>
<p>            “Yes,” McGonagall said. “It seems that you could be, were you to be in a place heavily trafficked, like Kings Cross station, recently.”</p>
<p>            Malfoy sneered, not even bothering to deny it. He knew they’d had someone following him. Thomas was always so sloppy. “Well, I can obviously get around that—”</p>
<p>            McGonagall flicked her wand and froze him where he was. “Test him.” She called, and Longbottom sauntered back in, looking smug.</p>
<p>            “Told you Dean was right,” he crowed.</p>
<p>            “I’m seventeen. What I do is my own business.” Malfoy said. Though his limbs were immobile, he could still speak. “I don’t have to explain anything to you.”</p>
<p>            “Perhaps not.” McGonagall said, and her voice was almost sympathetic as she continued. “But they will not have the answers you seek.”</p>
<p>            Neville muttered a charm, tracing it over Malfoy’s body. “He’s certainly been exposed.” Neville said. “But—I don’t think he’s actually contracted—”</p>
<p>            “Enough! Of course a filthy Muggle virus wouldn’t take hold of me,” Malfoy tried to move, but the spell held him fast. “Just clean me and let me go home.”</p>
<p>            Neville muttered a charm, and Malfoy’s skin glowed for a moment.  “There. All traces obliterated.”</p>
<p>            “We’ll do similarly on the students as they leave,” McGonagall sighed. “Though I think it might be best to get them out of the castle as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>            “I can be out of the gates by the morning.” Malfoy said. “I’ll send word to my family, if you’ll just—”</p>
<p>            McGonagall flicked her wand, and Malfoy felt himself able to move again, but her glare froze him all the same. “You aren’t going anywhere, Mr. Malfoy.”</p>
<p>            “I should be with my family. I can Apparate away from any Muggles who—”</p>
<p>            “You have already been exposed. That means you continue to be contagious, particularly if you develop symptoms. Mr. Longbottom has removed the traces from your skin, but your cough, your saliva, will all contain traces of the virus for the next few days.”</p>
<p>            “You can’t keep me here—” this was ridiculous, Draco knew the virus couldn’t take hold in his system; he was immune, he was immune to everything—“My mother—Professor—”</p>
<p>            “Your mother is much safer with you here.” McGonagall finished in her clipped voice. “We are united on this, Mr. Malfoy. Your father has already informed me that should you arrive at their door, he will simply send you back here.”</p>
<p>            Draco slumped in his chair, defeated. “I need to see them.”</p>
<p>            “You need to think of someone other than yourself, Mr. Malfoy. You will spend the night in your dormitory. The other Slytherins are being moved out and checked for exposure as we speak. We may be able to head off the virus with a few antiviral spells, as long as it has not taken hold in their systems—”</p>
<p>            “I’m to stay here alone?”</p>
<p>            “You are to stay here for the duration of the break, and longer if necessary. You are dismissed.”</p>
<p>            “But—”</p>
<p>            <em>“Dismissed, </em>Mr. Malfoy. I shall keep you apprised of the situation.”</p>
<p>            Malfoy got up, grinding his teeth.</p>
<p>            What if his mother got sicker? What if he was here, and she—and he didn’t get to say goodbye?</p>
<p>            This stupid school, Potter and his friends. No one ever cared what he felt. No one gave him the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>            He didn’t have a single person he could ask for help.</p>
<p>            He was all alone.</p>
