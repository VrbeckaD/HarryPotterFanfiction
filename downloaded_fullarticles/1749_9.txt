          <div class="userstuff"><p>"You've got to see this!" Draco screamed as he bounced into Harry's room. </p><p>Harry looked at him with wide eyes and took a step backwards. </p><p>"Come on!" Draco couldn't contain his excitement and didn't understand why Harry looked so scared. "Don't you want to see your birthday cake?" </p><p>"Thereâ€™s a birthday cake? For me?" His eyes widened even more and a little smile appeared in the corner of his mouth. </p><p>"Of course! When I turned eight there was a big cake too. Mine had snitches, but yours has owls. I know you love them because you always pet Helga," he added, proud of himself for having noticed that. None had known what Harry liked, but Draco knew; he wasn't Harry's best friend/big brother for nothing! </p><p>He grabbed Harry's hand and dragged him to the kitchen. There they looked at five house-elves decorating a cake as big as them. </p><p>"The Dursleys never gave me anything for my birthday," Harry whispered. </p><p>"Father says that your family is bad so that's why you're living with us now. Here you'll have presents and parties!" </p><p>"Really?" Harry's smile grew, and Draco felt some warm feeling inside him. </p><p>"Yes! I'll let you my friends because you don't have any yet, and we'll play together. It'll be great!" </p><p>Harry looked happy after hearing that. Draco threw a protective arm over his shoulders, and swore to himself that Harry will always have the best birthdays.</p></div>
