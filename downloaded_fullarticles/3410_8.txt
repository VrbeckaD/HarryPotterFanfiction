    <p>Harriet woke up to her Aunt screaming and pounding on her cupboards door.</p><p>"Wake up, Freak!" Her Aunt shrieked. Harriet simply got up without complaining and went into the kitchen to start breakfast. Her scar has been bubbling with pain lately for some reason. Her scar is like multiple lighting bolts shooting down from the sky and they are pure silver. Harriet's Aunt always complains about how freakish her scar looks. So after a year of searching for makeup products to cover up her scar, they finally found the right product to cover it up. For some unknown reason, the makeup always would work everywhere but her scar. She shutters at the memory of what her Uncle did after she said it was like magic. But she knew she had magic, she knew. Weird things always happen around her like stuff setting on fire and blowing up. She was bleeding for weeks after the incident. Aunt Petunia was screaming about something in the background about uneven curtains which made Harriet's eyes roll. Her Aunt always liked things in perfect order, no matter what it was, it had to be perfect in every way. Harriet really never cared about things being neat like her Aunt because she never had things of her own to keep neat. Harriet was just about to finish breakfast when her Uncle came down, that fat cow. She rushed over to put food on his plate.</p><p>"Good morning," Harriet said sweetly like always. Her Uncle was never in a good mood in the morning so it was wise to be on his better side if he had one that is.</p><p>"Good morning Freak," Her Uncle replied grumbling. Dudley came down a few minutes later, grumbling about how little sleep he got because he stayed up late playing video games. This week was the last week of school and Dudley was turning 11 in a few days. Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon have been showering him with praise and gifts non-stop. She always was never given any gifts or allowed to be out when the holidays were around. After awhile she stopped caring and realized that they will never like her. Both Uncle Vernon and Dudley were done with breakfast so she finished cleaning and got ready for school. Everyone hated her, they bullied her and teased her about everything she did. It was all because of Dudley and his group. Piers always teases her about her wearing bras and frilly panties even though she doesn't. She didn't wear bras because she had a very flat chest and she wore boxers too big for her. Her Aunt would only buy them when she went shopping for Dudley. Harriet put on a baggy, light blue sweatshirt and gray, baggy jeans and ratty, old tennis shoes. She never even tried with her hair but she covered up her scar with makeup. She grabbed her school bag filled with books. She always completed all of her homework months ahead and had perfect grades. Harriet loved to learn because it was something she could do by herself and for herself. She quickly jogged to school, avoiding Dudley and his gang. When she got to school, she went immediately to the library to return books.</p><p>"Morning Ms. Haack," Harriet spoke quietly as she walked up to her. Ms. Haack is an older woman in her mid 60's who loves science. She wore little purple glasses that had jewels on them which stood out from her gray hair, gray eyes, and gray clothing. </p><p>"Good morning Harry," Ms. Haack sang sweetly.</p><p>"How were the books about nuclear war and origami?" Ms. Haack asked as she saw the books she was returning.</p><p>"They were very interesting. Thank you so much!" Harry said while bouncing on the balls of her feet. Ms. Haack chuckled as she checked in the books. Ms. Haack always had a soft spot for Harry. She knew Harry lived in a bad home and it made her heart ache to see Harry be so grateful over the littlest things. </p><p>"We just got a new series of mystery novels this morning," Ms. Haack said excitedly as she held up three books. Harry gasped as she examined the book covers. Ms. Haack gave the books to her to look at. Harry slowly grabbed one of them and turned to the back to read the summary. </p><p>"Do you want them?" Ms. Haack asked as Harry read the summary excited. Harry looked up and smiled really wide as she nodded. Ms. Haack smiled back as she checked out the series of book. The warning bell rang which meant 10 minutes until classes start. The two quickly said goodbye and Harry dashed to her English class. English was a yes and no subject for her. She loved writing, reading, and truly understanding the book by stripping it down and analyzing it. But she hated learning grammar and how to write. She huffed when she saw Piers and Dudley waiting outside of the class. They both saw her and smirked.</p><p>"Where were you? Sucking off a professor to get good grades?" Piers taunted.</p><p>"No," She mumbled. She ran into the room to avoid them but Dudley grabbed her by the hair. She yelped in pain and stumbled back with Dudley's hand still in her long hair. Piers groped her flat chest and snorted when he couldn't grab anything. She whimpered when he dug his nails into her chest. </p><p>"You like that don't you? You bloody freak!" Piers shouted. Dudley turned her to face him and punched her under her right eye. She shouted again and fell to the ground. They both spit on her and went into class and shut the door as the final bell rang. Harry started to cry silently as she curled up in a ball on the ground. She stayed there for awhile until she stopped crying. She got up and went into the nearest girls bathroom. She walked in and checked to see if anyone else was there, no one was there. She went to the mirror to see a large bruise already starting to form. Harry stared at herself in the mirror. She had long, wavy raven hair with deep blue eyes that also had green near the pupil. She was very petite with no curves and barely made 4'6". She had very pale skin and plump pink lips. Also, she had the longest eyelashes she has ever seen. Harry didn't want to go back to class, during classes at the end of the year you only would watch movies or talk about the summer. Movies were boring to her because she wanted to read instead and the books were always better. She never had anything to talk about for plans in the summer but it didn't matter because no one never called on her. Plus she always envied that kids got to go on trips with their parents. 

Harry frowned at this, she never knew her parents. Her Aunt said they died in a car accident because they were drunk and high. Her dad was a raging alcoholic who was addicted to drugs while her mom was a prostitute who slept with every man she saw. But Harry knew what really happened that night, Voldemort killed her parents and tried to kill her. The reason why it didn't work was because she is magic itself. It has been written since the beginning of time, she is the creator and destroyer of magic. The reason she knew it was of Mr. Feose. Mr. Feose works by her house as a potion maker. They met when she was 4, he was quite scared when an unsupervised toddler walked into his shop with almost no clothes on. He fed her, gave her clothes, and read her stories. Over the years, he let her work for him and she made a few galleons each week. She is so advanced at potions, he fears that the professors at Hogwarts will be scared of an 11 year old having the knowledge of a 40 year old. He was the one who told her about the wizarding world, her parents, and the prophecy. Harry was very thankful for him teaching her and being like a father to her. </p><p>"Well I have no other place to go, I will go to his shop then," Harry sighed and left the school unnoticed.</p>
