    <p>“Stop it,” said Narcissa. “Just take a deep breath.”</p><p>Remus did as he was told and glanced at himself in the mirror.  His eyes traced the long scar on his face. “I don’t know if I can do this.”</p><p>“You’ve done much more difficult things than this,” said Narcissa. “There’s nothing to worry about. Augusta and Molly and I have got it covered. Regulus, too.”</p><p>“I know,” Remus sighed, fidgeting with his light green robes. “But what if-”</p><p>“No!” cried Molly. “No what-if’s! Remus Lupin, you look bloody fantastic and you are going out there whether you like it or not!”</p><p>Remus appreciated the tough love, but it didn’t make his stomach feel any less queasy. Both women could tell he was still very nervous.</p><p>“Remus, look at me,” said Narcissa. He did. “Do you want to marry Sirius?”</p><p>“Yes,” said Remus without hesitation.</p><p>“Try that again,” said Narcissa. “Do you want to marry Sirius?”</p><p>Remus quirked an eyebrow in confusion. “Yes, I do?”</p><p>Narcissa looked unconvinced, crossing her arms.</p><p>“I do!” cried Remus, unsure how he could make her believe his words. To his surprise, Narcissa smiled.</p><p>“Now, how hard were those two words to say?” she asked.</p><p>Remus nodded in understanding. “It’s not hard to say. It’s being in front of all those people that’s going to be hard.”</p><p>“It’s okay to be nervous,” said Molly. “But you’ve worked too hard to give up just because there’ll be a few extra faces.”</p><p>“A few?” Remus repeated. He’d seen the guest list, and there were far more than ‘a few’ people on it. Sirius’ coworkers, Hogwarts professors, all of their friends and family (none of whom were actually blood-related to Remus). Hell, the Minister herself was out there! </p><p>“Remus?” said Molly. “Are you still with us?”</p><p>Remus nodded, trying to keep himself from getting dizzy. </p><p>“He did eat, didn’t he?” asked Molly worriedly.</p><p>“Yes, I made sure he ate every last bite of his breakfast,” Narcissa assured her.</p><p>“Good,” said Molly. “We don’t want him fainting halfway to the altar.”</p><p>Remus sighed. “How long until it starts?”</p><p>“Fifteen minutes,” said Narcissa. “I’m going to go check on the children.”</p>
<hr/><p>“Sirius, it’s going to be fine,” said Regulus. His brother, dressed in soft blue robes, was pacing back and forth.</p><p>“How do you know?” asked Sirius, his eyes wide. “Have you ever been married?”</p><p>Regulus gave him a look. “Sit down. Breathe. You. Will. Be. Fine.”</p><p>Sirius sat down. He breathed in, but too fast, choking on nothing.</p><p>Regulus shook his head as his older brother gained control of his breathing. “Brother, you are an enigma. You spent six years in Azkaban. You’ve fought a dozen battles against dark wizards, running in, wand blazing. There was never a question of your courage.”</p><p>“I’m a Gryffindor,” said Sirius. “Courage is a by-product.”</p><p>“And yet, as brave a Gryffindor as you are,” Regulus continued. “You’re sitting here terrified at the prospect of marriage.”</p><p>“It’s not the marriage I’m afraid of!” cried Sirius. “I know I want to spend the rest of my life with Remus.”</p><p>“Then what is it, Siri?”</p><p>Sirius sighed. “I don’t know… the wedding? The people? What if I mess up? I mean, all of our friends and family and other important people are out there.”</p><p>“It’s just a ceremony, Sirius,” Regulus said. “And if you do mess up, just laugh at yourself. Go with it. No one is going to mind. They’ll probably join in and that’ll just make everything more interesting.”</p><p>“What if…” Sirius began, and Regulus waited. “What if Remus doesn’t show up?”</p><p>“He’s right down the hall, Brother,” Regulus assured him. “And he’s just as nervous as you, but Narcissa and Molly are giving him a pep talk, just as I am for you.”</p><p>“This is a pep talk?” asked Sirius. “I feel like I’m going to fall over.”</p><p>“Well, don’t,” said Regulus. “You’ve got less than ten minutes to get it together.”</p><p>Augusta appeared just then. </p><p>“I’m going to go check on the children,” said Regulus. “I’ll see you soon.”</p><p>“Thanks, Reg,” said Sirius, sighing. He glanced at himself in the mirror. A pointless endeavor. He knew he looked handsome. He knew Remus would look even better. But he still wanted to transform into Padfoot and curl up under the vanity.</p><p>“Honestly, Sirius,” Augusta tutted. “This is going to be the happiest moment of your life. Everything is perfect.”</p><p>Sirius nodded, knowing she was right. He checked his watch, just as Augusta called out to the hallway.</p><p>“We’re starting in five minutes! If you’re not ready, you’d better be in ten seconds!”</p>
<hr/><p>Kitty studied the bottles and brushes and tiny containers in awe. How could make-up come in so many shapes and sizes and colors? How was she supposed to know what went where? </p><p>She glanced over at Harry, who was dressed in green robes to match Remus and fiddling with his bowtie for the umpteenth time. He wouldn’t know anything about make-up. </p><p>Slumping in her chair, Kitty studied herself in the vanity mirror. Her straw-colored hair was perfect. Her blue dress was perfect. Her face was… plain. </p><p>Where were Ruth or Maddy when you needed them? She’d only recently begun calling her that. Maddy. It sounded much nice than Mei. </p><p>The door opened just as Kitty reached for what she thought was lipstick.</p><p>“Right, face time!” cried Ruth, appearing behind her. “Oh, you don’t want that, Kitty. It’s not your color.”</p><p>Kitty glanced at Ruth and Maddy in the mirror. They were both dressed in light blue gowns, their hair done in elegant curls. Neither of them had make-up on, either.</p><p>Maddy picked up a container of powder. “It’s been so long since I wore this stuff. I’ve forgotten how.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, ladies,” said Ruth, who’d noticed Kitty’s lack of knowledge as well. “I’ve got you covered.”</p><p>Thirty minutes later, all three of them looked like perfect angels. Maddy had relearned the basics, and gave a reluctant Harry a simple foundation.</p><p>“There, now you won’t wash out in photos,” said Maddy.</p><p>“It feels weird,” Harry told her.</p><p>“You’ll forget it’s there in ten minutes,” she assured him.</p><p>“How is everything?” asked a voice at the door. They turned to see Narcissa. “Oh, you all look lovely!”</p><p>“We try,” said Maddy. “How is Remus?”</p><p>“Nervous,” said Narcissa. “But ready. Have you heard from the other groom?”</p><p>“He’s about the same,” said a deeper voice behind her. Regulus appeared behind her shoulder. </p><p>“Daddy!” cried Kitty, running to her father. “How do I look?”</p><p>“Like the best flower girl in history,” said Regulus, hugging her. He glanced at Ruth, and couldn’t help but smile.</p><p>“I take it I look good, too?” said Ruth.</p><p>“Beautiful,” Regulus said quietly. It took Kitty clearing her throat for the both of them to realize they were staring at each other. </p><p>“We’re starting in five minutes!” cried Augusta’s voice from the corridor. “If you’re not ready, you’d better be in ten seconds!”</p><p>“Kitty, Harry, do the two of you have any questions?” asked Narcissa.</p><p>“Nope,” said Kitty. Harry shook his head. </p><p>“Then let’s get lined up,” said Narcissa.</p><p>They walked down the hall to the entrance of the wedding hall - cherrywood double doors. They’d rented a lovely event hall near the beach, which had a large outdoor patio where the reception would take place. </p><p>Maddy and Ruth slipped inside to inform the officiant, a friend of the Minister, that they would be ready in five minutes.</p><p>Then they waited. The first to arrive were Minerva and Pollux, who were to take the place of Sirius and Remus’ parents. Pollux had grown close to his grandson and grandson-in-law-to-be, and Minerva had always been a mother figure to both of them. It seemed only fitting. </p><p>A few minutes later, Sirius and Augusta arrived. Sirius hugged his niece and godson, but looked around nervously. </p><p>“He’s coming,” whispered Narcissa. Just as she said this, Remus and Molly turned the corner.</p><p>“Remus,” Sirius whispered. </p><p>Remus’ face broke into a grin and embraced him. “Sirius… we’re finally here.”</p><p>“Oi! No snogging until the vows are done!” Regulus ordered. </p><p>The door to the hall opened and Ruth peeked in. “Oh, good. You’re all here. Hurry and get in your order. There’s a lot of guests here waiting.”</p><p>They did as instructed. First was Pollux, then Minerva. Behind them was Narcissa and Regulus, and then Molly and Augusta. Harry, holding two golden bands on a small cushion, came next, followed by Kitty with her basket of flower petals.</p><p>And last would be Remus and Sirius. Somehow, it seemed fitting that they walk down the aisle together. After all they’d been through, being separated for so long, they wanted to start their new life side-by-side.</p><p>A romantic melody echoed from the hall, and Ruth and Maddy swung the doors wide open. One by one, the party strolled toward the altar. </p><p>Minerva and Pollux sat down in their respective seats. Regulus, Narcissa, Molly, and Augusta took their places on either side, facing the guests. Then Harry proudly marched down, standing in front of Narcissa on Remus’ side. Kitty skipped to her place next to Regulus, tossing flower petals behind her.</p><p>And then the music changed, and the crowd rose to their feet, turning to face the doors.</p><p>Sirius looked at Remus.</p><p>“Ready?” he whispered.</p><p>“If you are,” he replied.</p><p>And, arm in arm, they stepped over the threshold.</p>
