    <p>They were all dead her friends, family, classmates, professors, even her enemies all were dead. The war took them away from her and it was entirely all that meddling old goat's fault. If only she could go back in time. So, she could correct all the wrong Dumbledore had made from the fake prophecy he made Riddle and her. If only she didn’t listen to that foolish old man then none of this would have happened. Harriet truly wished that she could go back in time with her family and friends to fix everything they could. However, she didn’t know that the Magic was listening to her pleads as she watched her chosen child cry to the heavens. She would also send back Severus Snape, Percy Weasley, and her familiar Hedwig back along with her.   </p>
<p>Tears streamed down Harriet’s face as she looked down at her crystal cross pendant. It was given to her by Percy during her fourth year in the now destroyed Hogwarts. He said it was a reminder that no matter how he acted or timeline he or she was it would protect her. It was a reminder of how much he truly loved her. Harriet knew that Percy was planning to propose to her if they both survived the war. She cursed herself for surviving alone in the seemingly endless war. Harriet heard a soft feminine voice in her mind. “Your wish shall be granted, my child. Along with your journey, you will have Severus Snape and your soul mate Percy Weasley as well as your familiar with their memories of this war. Beware that not everything is as it seems the ones that you thought were dead aren’t truly dead.” Slowly after the message, the world around her turned black as her pendant started to glow.</p>
<p>Once Harriet had awoken she noticed something was off. She was eleven again and in her cupboard under the stairs. Harriet quickly looked down to her relief she still had the crystal cross pendant that Percy gave her. Harriet also notices that she was wearing a pretty white spring dress and white high heel shoes. They actually fit her instead of Dudley’s normal cast-offs she usually wears. She silently started to recall the voice that spoke to her. ‘It must have been Lady Magic.’ She thought to herself at least she won’t be only one to return to this time. Quietly she got out of her cupboard and went into the kitchen but was lost in thought. She had gotten a sharp glare from Aunt Petunia. ‘It’s about time you woke! I want everything perfect for my little Duddykins.’ Aunt Petunia told her as she snapped out of her thoughts. She had started to cook bacon for the two large men in the household hoping that she’d be able to eat some herself. Sadly that wouldn’t happen because of how those two can eat. Of course, after breakfast, Dudley failed to count his presents, again. It was a little funny to watch again.</p>
<p>Petunia’s face turned into a scowl when she remembered that she had no one to take in the girl. “Vernon, what are we going to do about her?” She pointed to the little red-haired devil. “We have no one to take her in. Vernon looked at her lost as he had no idea what to do with the girl. Petunia turned to the girl and saw that her brown eyes were twinkling. “Well?” Knowing the girl was up to something. Her freak of niece never answered her because she skipped to the telephone and was dialing an unfamiliar number.</p>
<p>“Girl what do you think you’re doing with our telephone.”Vernon bellowed loudly. He looked at her as if she would contaminate the telephone. Who on earth could that Freak possibly call? Then his face turned a deep purple when he noticed that the freak was wearing something he thought was too pretty for her.</p>
<p>Harriet waited for the potion master to pick up his cell phone. Severus was his dad and he was married both to James and Lily. They had both found out what Dumbledore did to them in the third year of Hogwarts. The Weasley’s was there to console both her dad and herself. She was grateful for that.</p>
<p>Severus was talking to Percy about how to help Harriet when his cell began to ring. Percy had stopped mid-sentence so he could answer his cell. He gave Percy an apologetic look before pressing the accept button. “Hello? Who am I speaking too?”</p>
<p>“It’s me, Harriet. Um, Daddy do you think you could pick me up?” Harriet answered the potion professor in a small quiet voice.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I can’t because of Dumbledore.” Severus sighed he hated hearing his daughter shy yet scared quiet voice. “However, I can buy your school supply and Hedwig early along with some new clothes.”</p>
<p>“Daddy I’m scared. I did accidental magic.” Harriet confessed as she saw her Uncle’s face was purple.  “Th-they hate me when I do it and hurt me too.” Thankfully the Dursley family couldn’t hear what she was saying.</p>
<p>Severus scowled when he heard this. “I’ll send Percy to pick you up. I want you to stay with his family until it’s time to go to Hogwarts.” He sighed softly and quickly explained himself. “It’s not because I don’t want you. Trust me there is nothing in the world that I want more. However, my house is currently in an unlivable state even for me.” He smiled when he heard his daughter’s quiet laughter. “Before I hang up I’m giving Percy some potions to give those we trust their memory of the war back to them.” His daughter was happy with what he said. Once he hung up he told Percy what was going on. Severus was grateful that Percy agreed and told his mom beforehand that he might bring someone over to the Burrow. Silently he was praying to give his little girl a childhood she deserves.</p>
<p>Once Harriet finished that call with her Daddy she turned around. “I’ll be picked up by someone and I’ll be out of your hair.” She smiled softly knowing that the Dursley’s would like that. Though Harriet was still a bit wary of her Uncle’s temper. “He should be here in an hour. So possibly before Dudley’s friend comes over I think.” Her Aunt gave her a sharp nod an looked like she swallowed a lemon. Dudley just looked happy that he didn’t have to deal with her.</p>
