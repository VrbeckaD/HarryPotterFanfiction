    <p>I said in the summary of my ao3 page I’d like to write requests… but i didn’t get any jet! So I thoug about making it official now!</p><p>See, last night I had a rough time before going to sleep. And once in bed i thoug…<br/>
“it would be nice to have a reassuring fic or something…”<br/>
But I didn’t think I would find anything like that.<br/>
“may as well write it myself”</p><p> </p><p>How would a fic like that be? Well, it would be an experiment…<br/>
A few years ago I was hyper in the Gorillaz fandom, for example (I even had a crush-thingy going on with 2-d)<br/>
I had then a quite disgusting nightmare were a handfull of huge spider-grasshopper creatures chased me, cornered me and attacked me in my room…<br/>
And then I woke up. I looked arround and passed my hands throu my hair and tried to calm down… but I was afraid I would have a bad dream if I managed to sleep again…<br/>
So I decided to daydream. I concentrated very hard… and 2-d was lying in bed behind me. He was half-zombie, and he yawned, but still he rolled up and pass his arms across my waist to tell me (with sleepy voice) that it had been just a dream and I could calm down. I did have a nice rest after that.</p><p>Imagine that scene with your fandom crush. Think of it being Sam Winchester or Tadashi Hamada, and I will be happy to write it the best I can!</p><p> </p><p>So, in this fanfiction I am going to be making requests. The nature of each story will be indicated in the tytle and summary of each chapter, and there may be fluf, confort, angst, porn… whatever you ask for.</p><p>The only problem Is the fandoms… wich fandoms could I write of?<br/>
Well anything that i know, like supernatural, Good Omens, Harry Potter, One Piece, Teen Wolf, Gorillaz, BGS, FBAWTFT, ROTG, HTTYD…</p><p>Em, the list can be quite long and still I may be able to write of shows I don’t follow closely…</p><p>Just ask for whatever and i’ll answer whether i can or not write it and try to do my best.</p><p><br/>
</p><p>PS: I can write in spanish or english, and I can write explicit material, but it must be specified in the request</p>
