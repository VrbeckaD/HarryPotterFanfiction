    <p>Hermione gave one cauldron a stir, then quickly moved to another, taking care to stir this one counter-clockwise.  She brushed a stray hair from her face and moved to another cauldron where she placed three scarab beetles and began to stir again.</p>
<p>Being a Potions apprentice was challenging.  Who was she kidding?  It was downright miserable.  It would have been simply challenging if her master, Severus Snape, weren't such a grouse.  Demanding perfection at every turn, he harped when things weren't exactly as he wanted them, even if they were done right.  The man was never satisfied.  Hermione huffed.</p>
<p>It was Christmas Eve, and she'd thought she might have a reprieve.  She wasn't that fortunate.  Severus had snapped and yelled all day, even more so than usual.  He'd piled work upon her, and she feared she wouldn't get home until nearly midnight.  Not that it mattered.  She was going home to an empty apartment in Hogsmeade.  Her parents had never really been the same since their memories had been restored.  Their knowledge of their true past was sketchy, and they would often forget things.  They had forgotten they had a daughter for six months.  No matter what Hermione had tried, their memories could not be reestablished.  They were just beginning to accept her once again. Hermione feared that if she showed up on their doorstep in Australia they'd treat her more like the milkman than their daughter.</p>
<p>
  <i>"Come to Christmas dinner, Hermione!" Harry begged.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>"Oh!" Hermione chewed her lower lip.  "I can't, Harry."</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>"Why not?  Don't tell me you have a date?"</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>She looked to the floor.  "No, I just want to celebrate alone."</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>"You do realize that's self-defeating," Harry said with a smirk.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>"Harry, I really appreciate the offer.  It's just that..."  She looked away.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>"You feel like the odd man out?"</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Her eyes met his.  "Yes.  You are all paired off so nicely, and I'm just there.  The kids keep you all busy, and I feel left out.  It's a family holiday, Harry.  I really don't have any family."</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Harry pulled her into a hug.  "Of course you do, Hermione. We're your family."</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>"I know," she said into his coat.  "But this Christmas, I don't want to be the afterthought."</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>"Hermione!"</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>"I know.  I know you don't mean it.  It's just how I feel.  Please don't be upset.  I'm not offended at all.  It's just the natural way of things."</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Harry made sure she was looking right at him. "You're welcome, always.  You know that."</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>She smiled.  "I do.  Of course, I do."</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>"Well, if you change your mind, there will be plenty of goose to go around."</i>
</p>
<p>She'd pondered his invitation over and over again.  She just couldn't bring herself to be subjected to all that holiday cheer without someone special to share it with.  It would be best if she celebrated alone.  Unfortunately, at the rate she was going with these potions, she'd be ringing in the New Year instead of celebrating Christmas this year.</p>
<p>She finished the Mandrake Draught and began to bottle it.  She shook her head, knowing that Poppy still had a case of this in her stores.  Severus had just given her this task to keep her busy.  As if she weren't busy enough having to brew a Memory Potion and Draught of Peace at the same time.</p>
<p>"This is the life you have chosen," he'd harped.  "If it's too much for you and you can't take the stress, perhaps another field would be better for you."</p>
<p>She frowned.  Since surviving the war, she'd thought Severus Snape might become a better person.  Granted he was a hero and all, but he certainly didn't act the part.  The closest thing to a smile that ever graced his lips was an evil smirk.  He never paid anyone a compliment, the students still turned and ran when he came down the hallway, and because of his surly attitude, he had no friends. Hermione was the only one he ever spoke to, and that was only because she was his apprentice.</p>
<p>Severus stalked up behind her as she moved to the memory potion, causing her to jump slightly.  He gazed into the cauldron as she stirred it.</p>
<p>"It's too thick."</p>
<p>She glanced at him.  "It will thin when I add the jobberknoll feathers."</p>
<p>He removed his wand and vanished the potion.  "It is too thick.  Even if it thins, it will still remain too thick.  Start again."  Turning, he stalked away.</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas to you, too," Hermione said under her breath.</p>
<p>Severus spun around.  "What did you say?" he challenged.</p>
<p>She looked up and gave him a level look.  "Merry Christmas, Master Snape."</p>
<p>He sneered at her.  "Christmas... a waste of time!  It's only a reason for people to slack off all day."</p>
<p>She looked at him curiously.  "Certainly you want to celebrate, sir."</p>
<p>He got a faraway look in his eye.  "Nonsense.  I have nothing to celebrate.  I am surrounded by dunderheads, and you are constantly jabbering at me, asking infernal questions that a know-it-all like you should already know.  Name one thing that I should be thankful for!"</p>
<p>"You're alive," she muttered crossly.</p>
<p>"It would be better if I weren't."  He turned then and disappeared into his private lab.</p><hr width="9%"/>
<p>Severus stormed into his lab and threw himself into the chair behind his desk.  </p>
<p><i>Merry Christmas indeed.  The nerve of that woman.  What is there to be merry about? </i> </p>
<p>He marveled at the stupidity of everyone.  They all pranced around with smiles on their faces and happy wishes to one another.  Wishing meant nothing.  Doing, that was where the action was.  He'd done.  Oh, he'd done.  He still did.  Did he get credit for his works?  No, never.  </p>
<p>He slaved in that stupid Potions classroom, trying to instill a good work ethic in the dunderheads he taught.  They ignored him, made fun of him, laughed at him, and took his subject for granted.  His mind raced to the last episode of sheer stupidity he'd encountered.</p>
<p>
  <i>"Professor Snape?" </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Severus wheeled around to see Timothy Bell looking at him in fear.  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>"Do I add the porcupine quills now?" the boy asked shyly.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Severus' eyes raked over the lad.  He was extremely pale, slightly stooped over, and looked sickly.  He'd noticed the child limping around the castle, but had not given it much thought.  Now a fleeting question shot through his mind, but he was too absorbed in the retort that was to fly out of his mouth.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>"What did the instructions say on the board?"</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>The boy squinted and looked puzzled.  Severus huffed.  "Do you want your cauldron to melt around you?"</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Timothy's eyes grew wide.  "No, sir," he said in wonderment.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>"Then add the quills after you take it off the fire like it says on the board.  Does the English language escape you, Mr. Bell?"</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>The boy shook his head.  Severus leaned low.  "Then. Pay. Attention. To. Detail."</i>
</p>
<p>A disaster had been averted that day, but during the very next class, the boy had added more bulbadox powder than necessary, causing a cloud of blue smoke to fill the classroom.  That was just one example of the idiotic antics he had to suffer through in the classroom.</p>
<p>"Insufferable wastes of space," he muttered under his breath as he opened his Potions diary and began to scribble notes in it.</p>
<p>Time passed slowly.  Severus took great care in recording his findings and accomplishments for the day.  After a long while, Hermione straggled into his lab, her hair a mess.  He glowered at her for disturbing his concentration.</p>
<p>"I'm done, sir.  I'll be leaving now.  Merry Christmas," she said.</p>
<p>"I suppose you'll be wanting tomorrow off?" he groused.</p>
<p>"Um, yes sir..."</p>
<p>Severus frowned.  "If you intend to be serious about your apprenticeship, then you must be willing to work even when all are wanting to play."</p>
<p>Hermione stuttered, looking at him in slight shock.</p>
<p>Severus heaved a great sigh, as if the entire world were out to get him.  "Very well, but be here all the earlier the next day."</p>
<p>Hermione grinned and turned eagerly.  "I will, Master Snape!  Happy holiday to you!"</p>
<p>She'd rushed out before he'd even had a chance to object about the idea of him having a happy anything.  Gazing after her, he frowned deeply.  Creases that were hidden previously lined his face, which appeared worn and haggard and quite severe.  He returned to his scribbling.  His frown turned into a scowl as he heard a knock on his door.  Couldn't everyone just leave him in peace?</p>
<p>"Severus?" he heard a voice call from the doorway.  He rolled his eyes.  That voice belonged to the person he wished would just disappear.</p>
<p>Harry Potter rushed in with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Hello, Severus!  Merry Christmas!"</p>
<p>"What's so merry about it?" Severus grumbled.</p>
<p>"Why, it's the most wonderful time of the year!"</p>
<p>"According to whom?" Severus countered, glaring at Potter.</p>
<p>Potter stopped short, obviously not quite sure how to proceed.  He decided to smile wider, which only made Severus want to hex him.  He refrained.</p>
<p>"I wanted to invite you to Christmas dinner tomorrow, Severus."</p>
<p>Severus' eyes narrowed.  "Is this some sort of joke?"</p>
<p>Potter's eyes narrowed in response.  "Hardly!  Ginny and I would love to have you.  You should know that by now, we invite you every year."</p>
<p>Severus looked back down at his diary.  "I must decline."</p>
<p>Potter stepped over to Severus' desk and leaned over it.  "Come on.  It'll be fun.  Just this once?"</p>
<p>Severus' head snapped up, and he glowered at Potter.  "No."</p>
<p>The younger man straightened up.  "Well, the invitation stands.  You are always welcome."</p>
<p>Severus ignored him.  Potter began to shift from foot to foot.  "I'll just be going," he said finally.  "Happy Christmas, Severus."</p>
<p>Severus didn't even look up when the other man left.  He was relieved that the Boy-who-was-now-a-man-but-should-have-died-a baby had finally departed.</p><hr width="9%"/>
<p>Severus made his way down the hall to his doorway.  Looking up, he was startled to see the Bloody Baron's head where his doorknob should be.  His hand drew back in alarm, and he frowned down at the man's head, which was unusually bloody tonight.  The ghost grimaced at him.  Severus scowled and reached through the transparent head to open his door.  Muttering to himself, he closed the door behind him, stalked to his favorite wing-backed chair by the fire, and settled in for the evening.  He conjured up a mug of cocoa and opened his favorite Potions text, set on reading until his bedtime.</p>
<p>He'd only read a few paragraphs when there was a loud crashing sound from the hallway.  He looked up to see the Bloody Baron move through his door, a terrifying look on his face.  In an instant he was floating over Severus, his blank eyes seeming to bore into him, despite their vacancy.  His gaunt face scowled at the man seated below him.  Severus' eyebrow arched at the menacing figure.</p>
<p>"Severus Snape!" the ghost cried.</p>
<p>"Yes?" Severus said calmly.</p>
<p>"I am here to warn you!"</p>
<p>"Of what?" Severus said in a bored tone.</p>
<p>The Baron cried out, a low wail leaving his silver mouth.  He spun around Severus' armchair and came to rest in front of him once again.  This time, however, he held a large chain in his hand, which wrapped itself around his body.  Severus felt fear flare up in his chest.</p>
<p>"Do you wish to end up like me?" he asked Severus in a gravelly voice.</p>
<p>"Whatever do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I let my temper flare and rule over me, much as you do.  Like you, I had few friends, and like you, I spent my life foolishly."</p>
<p>Severus' eyes grew wide.  "Whatever do you mean?  You were a masterful Slytherin in your day."</p>
<p>"There is more to life than cunning and a cutting remark!  I let the worst of me overcome my better senses.  I let hatred and anger rule me.  Now, I am bound to the Earth, never able to rest."</p>
<p>"Baron, why do you insist on telling me this now?  Surely, others know of your plight!"  Severus eyed the Bloody Baron in fear.  Never had they had such a conversation, and although Severus knew that the Baron had come to a terrible end, he'd never truly thought about his existence as a ghost.</p>
<p>"My deeds bound me to an existence imprisoned in this castle.  I am unable to leave it and must remain until the end of time.  There is no rest for me; I have no peace.  I am doomed to this existence that has no meaning, no happiness, all because I gave no happiness to anyone when I was alive."  </p>
<p>The ghost came to within centimeters of Severus' face.  The dour man could feel the chill coming off the Baron.  He shrank back.</p>
<p>"Do you wish to become like me?" the Baron asked darkly.  </p>
<p>"No, of... of course I don't!" Severus replied adamantly while shaking his head vigorously back and forth.  His eyes were wide with dread when he looked to the ghost who was merely a breath away from him.</p>
<p>The ghost pulled back and floated above Severus once again.</p>
<p>"You will be visited by three spirits this night.  Your fate will be decided at the end of these visitations."</p>
<p>"What will these spirits do?" Severus asked.  A look of foreboding came over his face.</p>
<p>The ghost glowered at Severus.  "What they do is up to them.  I urge you to pay attention!"</p>
<p>The Bloody Baron lifted up the chain that now hung down from his body and scraped on the floor.  "If you wish to escape my fate, you will pay dire attention!"</p>
<p>With that, the Baron floated through Severus' door.  Snape sprung from his seat and ran to the door, flinging it open.  He looked up and down the corridor, but the Baron had disappeared from sight.  Severus' breathing was coming rapidly, and he took some deep breaths to steady himself.  Closing the door behind him, he turned in puzzlement to return to his seat by the hearth.  Then a bright light assaulted his vision.</p><hr/>
