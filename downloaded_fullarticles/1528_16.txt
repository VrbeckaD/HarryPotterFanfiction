    <p> </p><p>“Come on ‘Mione, you can’t possibly expect me to want to go into <em>that</em> place do you?” Harry complained.</p><p>Hermione shook her head all but dragging him along, “You promised me you would take this seriously!” she said.</p><p>“I am taking it seriously. But how in the bloody hell is knitting supposed to help with my therapy?” Harry asked. Hermione sighed, shaking her head as she pulled him towards the small yarn shop at the end of Diagon Alley. It was a cozy looking shop from the outside. With a small black cat sitting in the window, beside a display of several large balls of yarn and knitting needles that were currently knitting by themselves.</p><p>“Just come on,” Hermione hissed, pulling him through the slim white door and into the shop. A bell tinkled overhead and the shop keeper turned towards them. Harry sucked in a breath, while Hermione gasped.</p><p>“Welcome to the Knitted Dragon’s Lair,” Draco Malfoy said. Whoever either Harry or Hermione had been expecting to own such a shop, Draco was never at the top of their list. Hermione smiled, elbowing Harry in the ribs.</p><p>“Ow, what the hell was that for?” he hissed.</p><p>“Be nice,” she said under her breath. Harry rubbed his ribs, and looked around the rest of the shop, trying not to stare at the blond in question. He hated how bloody good he looked.</p><p>“We were wondering if you could help us find…” Hermione began.</p><p>“No playing with the yarn Harold,” Draco said.</p><p>Harry turned, looking rather guilty as he held up a ball of yarn. Draco moved past him, holding a spray bottle, and sprayed the black cat who was currently batting a ball of yarn in the window</p><p>“Sorry, what were you saying?” Draco asked turning back to Hermione then.</p><p>“You named your cat after me?” Harry asked suddenly.</p><p>“His name is Harold, last I checked Potter, yours was not,” Draco replied.</p><p>“Harold is typically the long-form from which Harry comes,” Harry said.</p><p>“Is it? Hmm? I don’t suppose I ever knew that.” Draco said with a shrug.</p><p>“Yes well, all this talk of the etymology of names is lovely, however, I was hoping you could help us with a good beginning yarn.”</p><p>Draco eyed Hermione then. “What sort of weight would you like?”</p><p>“Erm,” Hermione looked sheepishly at Harry, then at Draco. “I’m not sure.”</p><p>“Well, what sort of project are you hoping to make?”</p><p>“A blanket maybe?” Hermione asked. “Or a jumper? Molly was always great at jumpers.”</p><p>“That’s a bit adventurous for a first timer. Blankets are easier but a bit tedious for your first time out.”</p><p>“What would you suggest then?” Harry asked.</p><p>“A scarf is always a good place to start. I find a heavyweight yarn is always good for a beginner. Something in a wool, size 12 needles maybe. They’re thick, <em>but </em>it makes it easier to see your mistakes.”</p><p>“Perfect,” Hermione said with a smile.</p><p>“Right what colors were you wanting, we have a wide variety of both magical made and Muggle made wools that come in an array of colors.”</p><p>“What would you suggest?” she asked.</p><p>“Well it’s your project, you have to like the color. I’m partial to a bit of an emerald green myself, or a nice dark purple. We also have some blends of colors if you want more of a rainbow scarf.”</p><p>Harry couldn’t help but stare at Draco as he spoke, it was strange to think of how quickly he had turned his life around. Less than a year ago, he had been on trial for his life for being a Death Eater and now, here he was, owning a shop in Diagon Alley.</p><p>“Or if you’d like we have a few crimson and gold, I’m sure you two would be very familiar,” Draco said.</p><p>“No that’s… perfectly fine. Um, do you have anything in a blue perhaps?” Hermione asked.</p><p>Draco smiled, and showed her to where the heavy wool yarns were, and where she could find the knitting needles she was needing. Harry hated to admit it, but Draco was actually helpful, if a bit snobbish about yarn which he hadn’t quite expected but then it <em>was </em>Draco Malfoy after all Harry supposed. Harry sighed, standing at the front of the register when he heard the bell tinkle again, “Oh dear, I’m not late for the knitting club am I?” asked an older woman’s voice from behind him. Harry turned.</p><p>“Er… no he’s helping someone find some yarn,” Harry replied.</p><p>“Awe, how lovely. That’s our Draco, always helping out his customers,” she said with a kind smile. Harry would have laughed, the thought of Draco helping anyone seemed almost absurd, but he did seem different. The woman sighed then, “Such a lovely shop isn’t it?”</p><p>“Yes,” Harry said with a smile as he looked around. It was surprisingly Muggle, save for the knitting needles that were knitting of their own accord in the shop window.</p><p>“It’s just too bad you know,” the woman said. “After all he’s been through, and the grief the Wizengamot put him through for this shop,” she said with a tsk. “He’s worked so hard to show he’s a different person, and at least twice a week someone throws a brick through his shop window,” she shook her head. “Not that the Ministry cares a lick what happens to him. But I do wish he had someone to help him. Like that Muggle boy, what was his name…” she trailed off and Harry looked around,<em> Hermione and Draco had been gone an awfully long time,</em> he thought. </p><p>“Oh I can’t remember,” she said. “He was such a lovely young fellow. Looked a bit like you actually. Draco always lit up when he came in. I think they were a couple you know. None of my business really. Only one day the boy stopped coming round, Draco would never talk about it. He never talks about anything to do with his personal life. You know that sort of thing. But…” she sighed. “I do so wish he had someone to look after him. Besides old Harold over there.”</p><p>Harry merely smiled nervously entirely unsure of what to say. Just then, Draco and Hermione returned, carrying several large balls of yarn each in a variety of colors. And two sets of needles. Harry stared at Hermione.</p><p>“Hello Gertrude,” Draco said with a smile at the women who was standing behind Harry’s back.</p><p>“I’m not late for the knitting club am I?” she asked.</p><p>“Nope, in fact, I was just about to close up shop after this purchase so everyone can get here. Ethel rang and said she’d be here in a bit, she needed to stop for a bit of petrol.” Gertrude nodded. “The chairs are all set up in the back though, you’re welcome to sit down.”</p><p>“Petrol?” Hermione repeated, as Draco rang up her purchases.</p><p>“Knitted Dragon’s Lair serves both Muggle and Magical customers,” Draco said.</p><p>“Oh,” Harry said.</p><p>“I rather prefer the Muggles ironically,” Draco said quietly. “They ask fewer stupid questions. Right well, that’ll be two hundred and seventy-one galleons, and three knuts.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes widened. “Bloody hell ‘Mione did you buy the whole place out?”</p><p>“Hardly,” Draco and Hermione said in unison.</p><p>“A knitting club sounds fabulous though, do you suppose we might be able to join you next time? You know, once we’ve got our skills together?” Hermione asked.</p><p>Draco shrugged, “If you wanted. We hold them twice a month, the first Saturday and the third Saturday. Most of my clientele are Muggles so I’ll ask you kindly not to knit with magic. That does sort of defeat the purpose.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “Yes of course, thank you again,” she said. Draco bagged up the last of her purchases and handed the bags over to her and Harry.</p><p>Harry swallowed, taking the proffered bag, and turned around, not sure what to make of the whole experience.</p><p>“Did you know Malfoy was gay?” Harry asked when they had stepped out of the shop.</p><p>“No, what gave you that impression? Just because he owns a yarn shop?”</p><p>“No, the lady back there. Gertrude, said there used to be a Muggle boy who came in the shop, she said she thought they were together or something. I wonder whatever happened to him,” Harry left out the bit about how he looked like him. He didn’t really know what to make of that. It was odd enough that Draco had virtually named his cat after him, let alone might be dating his doppelganger.</p><p>Hermione shrugged. “I wouldn’t be all that surprised,” she admitted. Harry considered this. He wasn’t entirely sure what to do with the information exactly, but it was interesting all the same.</p><p>“Come on, let’s get back home, I’m eager to start learning this,” she said. “He made it sound rather fun.”</p><p>“Had a good conversation with Malfoy did you?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Yes actually,” Hermione said with a smile. “He’s rather sweet when he’s not calling me a mudblood.”</p><p>At this Harry laughed. “Draco Malfoy, sweet. What a horrifying thought,” he said, and with that, the two of them apparated away back to Grimmauld Place.  </p>
