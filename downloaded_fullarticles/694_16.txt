          <div class="userstuff"><p>“And what’s this cute little fella called?” Peter asked, watching as the leafy creature ran along the back of his hand.</p>
<p>Hermione smiled, leaning in. “Oh? Him? He’s a bowtruckle. Cute, isn’t he?” She held her hand out to take bowtruckle from Peter, but he turned to hold onto him a little longer.</p>
<p>“He’s adorable,” Peter said, grinning. “Gives little Groot a run for his money.”</p>
<p>Hermione laughed, having had met baby Groot, she could whole-heartedly agree. Bowtruckles were precious.</p>
<p>“Can we keep him?” Peter asked, looking at her with hopeful eyes.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not,” Hermione said, shaking her head. “He belongs with others of his kind.”</p>
<p>Peter pouted, but gave the Bowtruckle to Hermione before turning to look around the rest of the Animal Sanctuary. “What else is there to see?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I love your fascination with magical animals,” Hermione said, smiling. “Luna told me she had a new creature that she just brought in. We can head towards the Care Center to see what it is.”</p>
<p>“Magical animals are just so… magical,” Peter said, shrugging.</p>
<p>“Peter, you’re from space,” Hermione countered. “Space animals are just as cool.”</p>
<p>“Not the same,” he said with a shrug. “Now, show me some other cute things.” </p>
<p>Smiling, Hermione took his hand and lead him towards the Care Center to meet Luna and whatever else she had taken in.</p></div>
