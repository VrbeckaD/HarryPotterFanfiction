    <p class="MsoNormal">Harry felt a squeeze to his hand as
he sighed for what felt like the millionth time that day. His left hand, arm
really, was lying across his stomach trying to subtly keep it from sight. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /??????????????></p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Draco, everyone’s staring at me.”
Harry whispered as the pair made their way down the street. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">With a slightly amused laugh, he
replied, “No one is staring at you, Harry.” </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“They <i>all</i> stare at me <i>all</i> the
time.” The raven huffed and tried to pull his hand from his husband’s grip. The
blonde tightened his hold though and quickly led them to the side of the alley
so they were out of the way of other shoppers. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Draco pulled Harry close so that he
wouldn’t have to shout over the babble of the crowd of parents and students
shopping for Hogwarts supplies. “They’re looking at you because you’re Harry
Potter, not because of this.” He said gently and laid a hand on the shorter
boy’s slightly protruding stomach. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“How do you know?” Harry asked.
“Everyone knows what your father was and what he did. What if they think you’re
like him? That all of this is against my will?”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">The blonde almost laughed. “That’s
what you’re worried about? What they’re thinking of me? I thought you were
talking about them thinking you’re fat or that you’re afraid of what they think
of you for being pregnant at seventeen.” He replied. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Harry’s face paled drastically and
he hid it against Draco’s shoulder where he mumbled something unintelligible. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“I’m sorry, I didn’t quite catch
that.” Draco said with a small chuckle.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Harry turned his head so that his
mouth wasn’t covered. “I said: I hadn’t thought of that.” He reiterated. “But
you’re right; they probably do think I’m a trollop.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Draco wrapped his arms around
Harry’s waist and held him tightly. “Of course they don’t think that, Harry.
More importantly, you don’t think that, do you?”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">The following silence was answer
enough. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Harry?”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“I didn’t before. B-but now…” Harry
trailed off with a sniffle. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">With a soft sigh, Draco said, “Look
at me, Harry.” The brunette pulled back just enough to look up at him with
watery eyes. “Do you love me?”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Of course.” Harry’s voice was
thick from holding back his tears. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“If this,” He touched Harry’s baby
bump, “hadn’t happened, had we just stayed boyfriends throughout the rest of
school and then got married afterward, would you eventually have wanted a
child? Especially knowing we could have our own?” He asked.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Harry nodded.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Exactly.” Draco stated with a
small smile. “We’ve just gone a little out of order, is all. There’s nothing
wrong with that. Ten years from now, what’s the difference?”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Another sniffle preceded Harry’s
answer. “Nothing, I suppose.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Draco gave him a quick kiss. “We’re
married and we’re both adults. If anyone has a problem with how we live our
lives, they can go crucio themselves.” He said with a smirk. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Harry smiled at that and Draco
rewarded him with another kiss. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Better?” The blonde asked.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">With a shrugged, Harry replied, “I
guess. But I still don’t like them staring at me.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Come on, love.” Draco said as he
once again took Harry by the hand and began down the alley again. “Just ignore
them like you always do and you’ll forget about them.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Harry sighed again but allowed his
husband to maneuver them toward their destination. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">~!~</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“What’s wrong with the robes I
already have?” Harry whined as they entered the shop. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Draco closed the door behind them
before answering, “For the billionth time, there’s nothing wrong with them. But
you’ll need to buy new ones every few weeks if you don’t get maternity robes.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“I don’t <i>want</i> maternity robes.” The pregnant boy grumbled as he sat in a
chair across from the door to wait for Madam Malkin. “Can’t I just wear yours?”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“You really want to parade around
the school in Slytherin garb?” Draco asked with a chuckle as he crossed his
arms and leaned against the wall next to his seated husband.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Harry scoffed. “I don’t really
care. I just don’t… never mind. Just forget it.” </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Harry?” Said brunette anxiously
crossed his arms and turned his head away. Draco moved to sit in the seat on
his husband’s other side but Harry looked away from him again. “What’s really
bothering you?”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“I’m just frustrated.” He sniffled.
“Everything upsets me and I don’t know why.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Draco said nothing, just pulled
Harry against his chest and held him until he relaxed.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">After a few minutes of silent
comfort, a soft, female voice spoke from the doorway on their right. “Are you
ready now, Mr. Potter?”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">The young man in question glanced
up from his makeshift pillow. “I guess so.” He huffed dramatically and made no
move to get up.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Come on, there’s nothing to be
upset about.” Draco prodded and attempted to get Harry on his feet. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“I’m not upset; I just don’t
feeling like moving now.” To make his point, he wrapped his arms Draco’s middle
and clasped his hands behind the blonde’s back.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Remember, you made me do this.”
With a bit of careful maneuvering, Draco managed to get a good hold on the
smaller body lying on his and lifted him up. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Harry squeaked and moved his arms
around Draco’s neck, fearing he might fall. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Draco carried Harry into the next
room and set him on a stool where Madam Malkin took his measurements. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Once that was finished, the woman
left the room and came back with a set of robes in hand. “Try these on in the
dressing room and then we’ll go from there.” She instructed as she handed him
the clothing.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Harry nodded and took the hanger
from her. He headed over to a wall with three doors, a sign that read ‘Dressing
Rooms’ hung above them.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Do you want me to come in with
you?” Draco asked, having followed him across the room.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“I can still dress myself, thank
you very much.” He then went into the nearest room and practically slammed the
door in his husband’s face.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">While they waited, Draco and Madam
Malkin made small talk. It was nearly twenty minutes before either of them
realized how long Harry had been in there. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Harry?” Draco called as he knocked
on the door. He jiggled the knob to check if it was locked. Seeing that it was,
he pulled out his wand and cast <i>alohomora</i>.
</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">When he heard the telltale click,
he opened the door to see Harry sitting on the floor, half naked, and sobbing.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Wha… Harry? What’s wrong?” He
dropped to his knees before pulling the door closed behind him. “What
happened?”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Harry sobbed loudly and pressed his
face into the robes that were clutched in his hand. From somewhere in the
fabric, Draco heard a muffled reply between sniffles and sobs. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Draco gently pulled Harry’s hands
away from his face and took the robe from him, setting it aside. He then drew
his husband into a hug and waited for him to calm down. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“They don’t fit.” Harry finally
replied in a hoarse voice.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Are they too big?”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Harry sniffled. “Too small.” </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“That’s ok, love. There are others
you can try on.” Instead of soothing him, this only seemed to upset Harry even
more.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“I don’t want to.” He mumbled in
reply.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Come here.” Draco sighed and
maneuvered Harry onto his lap so that they were sitting back to front.<span>  </span>He rested his hands on Harry’s naked belly
and his chin on the brunette’s shoulder. “There is nothing wrong with the way
you look. And you aren’t fat like you seem to be thinking lately.” He kissed
Harry’s bare shoulder. “You’re beautiful, but if you really don’t want
maternity robes, you don’t<i> have</i> to
get them.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Harry turned around and wrapped his
arms around his blonde husband’s neck. “Thank you, Draco.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“You’re welcome, Harry.” He kissed
him on the cheek. “I love you.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Harry gave Draco a watery smile and
wiped his hand across his eyes. “I love you, too.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Draco got to his feet before
helping Harry up as well. “Why don’t I take these back to Madam Malkin while
you get dressed?”<span>  </span>He picked the
maternity robes up from the floor. “Then we’ll go home and do nothing for the
rest of the day. Sound good?”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Sounds good.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p> </p>
