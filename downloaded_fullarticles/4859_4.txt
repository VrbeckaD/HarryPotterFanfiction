    <p>Seraphina Picquery is expecting to find Percival Graves as she found him three weeks ago: unwilling to speak and staring right ahead like his mind was anywhere else but in the present. She understands; being held captive by a dark lord and being tortured is not something easy to forget, also Graves has always been a man of action so being stuck in a hospital must be a nightmare for him.</p>
<p>But instead of finding him frozen, lost in his own mind, Seraphina watches as Percival Graves talks (growls would be a more accurate description) with the british magizoologist. She stops right at the entrance, but doesn't step in, she doesn't want to interrupt.</p>
<p>"Mr. Graves, I brought you a sandwich! I heard you complaining about the food here and I thought-"</p>
<p>"I wasn't complaining," Graves huffs, crossing his arms over his chest. "Also you shouldn't sneak food in, that's against the rules, Scamander. But who am I kidding? You're the last person to care about rules..."</p>
<p>Oh Mercy Lewis... Seraphina wants to facepalm herself because that man surely has no idea how to say a simple thank you, does he?</p>
<p>Newt Scamander looks flustered and is about to apologise, but Graves waves his hand and the sandwich floats towards him. He eats it anyway and tells the other wizard is delicious which makes Scamander smile in response. The frown on Graves' face doesn't fade away, but Seraphina swears she sees the corners of his lips quirking up.</p>
<p>The magizoologist is the first one to notice her and he immediately rises from the chair he's sitting on and takes quickly something off of his shoulder to put it inside his right pocket, Seraphina rolls her eyes but doesn't say that she knows he has that bowtruckle with him.</p>
<p>"I have to go," he mumbles, looking at Graves and then at her. "Nice to see you again, Madam President."</p>
<p>"You too, Mr. Scamander," she says as she watches him go. Then she turns back to Graves and sits on the chair Newt has left. "So... Do you like our new consultant magizoologist?"</p>
<p>The man groans like he's being tortured and puts a hand on his face. Seraphina would've been mortified if it wasn't for the fact that she knew him pretty well to know he loves to be overdramatic.</p>
<p>"He's too... much," he finally blurts out to her amusement and even better he seems to be regretting his choice of words.</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?" Seraphina asks, her brow twitching up, curious.</p>
<p>Percival Graves takes a deep breath and Seraphina prepares herself to the ramble that's about to come.</p>
<p>"He's reckless, doesn't care about rules, wants to pet anything that moves even if that thing has fangs the size of his head, even if it breathes fire or even if it's about to kill him. And that's just what I got from Goldstein's stories and his own excited babbling. He doesn't pay enough attention to his surroundings, his hair looks like he just woke up, his freckles are-"</p>
<p>Wait a minute, since when does physical appearance has anything to do with professionalism? And since when does Percival Graves notice those kind of things?</p>
<p>"What about them?" She asks.</p>
<p>"They're distracting," he growls, annoyed. And Seraphina is almost in shock to hear him talking like that; does Graves know what that sounds like? He probably doesn't. "And he brings Pickett even though is clearly forbidden to bring any kind of creatures to a hospital."</p>
<p>"I heard one of the healers gave him permission," she comments, reminding herself to thank Queenie Goldstein later for all the information she has given to her the past days.</p>
<p>Graves almost bares his teeth at her when she mentions that.</p>
<p>"That fucking bastard," the Director mumbles to himself, but Seraphina hears anyway, it takes all her strength not to laugh at the grimace that appears on his face. "That's because that idiot of Rogan has no idea how to say no to Scamander. He's been trying to flirt with him for weeks, the fucker. That's highly unprofessional of him."</p>
<p>"Why is that? Scamander is not his patient."</p>
<p>"He shouldn't try to flirt with him in front of me- in the hospital I mean..." Graves shakes his head, like trying to forget an unpleasant memory. "Everything is going to be different once I return to MACUSA."</p>
<p>"Is it? How so?"</p>
<p>"Well, Scamander needs someone to keep an eye on him all the time, at least the first days to make sure he doesn't hurt himself... And he still carries that case with him, we cannot take more risks."</p>
<p>Seraphina nods, tapping her lips with his fingers; her expression serious even though she wants nothing more but to chuckle because that ridiculous man has a big, no a huge crush and he has no idea.</p>
<p>"All the time, huh?"</p>
<p>"It's necessary."</p>
<p>"Of course it is," Seraphina says and allows herself to grin when Graves glares at the exact spot where he last saw Scamander. "So... How about Goldstein? She can take care of-"</p>
<p>Graves huffs, irritated.</p>
<p>"She's biased. It's not going to work. Besides, those two spend too much time together already." He frowns and Seraphina thinks that maybe is not that he just frowned but more like he hasn't stopped since she arrived.</p>
<p>That man doesn't seem to know the meaning of relax.</p>
<p>And just because she has always been a tease, Seraphina decides to make Graves growl one more time by suggesting someone else.</p>
<p>"Okay. But how about Fonta-"</p>
<p>"It has to be me," Graves tells her, serious.</p>
<p>"Why? As Director of Magical Security you have plenty of responsibilities already."</p>
<p>"I know, but I'm the only one capable enough to... handle him."</p>
<p>Seraphina stares into his dark eyes, looking for an indication that wizard is joking and he actually knows what's going on. Sadly, Graves seems to believe his own words.</p>
<p>She has the brief thought that man is going to die alone if he doesn't figure things out or if he doesn't learn soon how to do feelings.</p>
<p>"So you'll become his personal shadow then?"</p>
<p>"If that's what it takes," Graves looks so determined Seraphina decides not to tell him yet what's going on.</p>
<p>She pinches the bridge of her nose and sighs. Why are men so complicated?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It's just the second day that Graves is back at his office in MACUSA and it's like he hasn't left.</p>
<p>True to his word, Graves keeps Scamander close and Seraphina is not surprised when he hears some of MACUSA's staff saying the Director doesn't trust the new consultant at all. She doesn't blame them, Graves has never been good at feelings.</p>
<p>"Hey, next time when you stare at him for more than ten minutes please don't narrow your eyes," Seraphina says when the two of them are walking down the hallway and they find Scamander talking excitedly to Goldstein about something. "Otherwise he'll get the wrong impression."</p>
<p>"I wasn't staring at him," Graves huffs, turning his head towards her, even though he looks like he wants to look back at Scamander more than anything.</p>
<p>"Of course you weren't," she sighs.</p>
<p>Three more days later she hears them discussing about something, but by the way Scamander is talking it's probably about a creature.</p>
<p>"She's harmless!" The magizoologist insists for the third time.</p>
<p>Graves rubs his temples and closes his eyes.</p>
<p>"You're going to kill me one of these days, Scamander."</p>
<p>Seraphina chuckles then because she knows none of them can listen.</p>
<p>The amused smile vanishes when she finds out that the Director of Magical Security has sighed a permit for Newt Scamander to keep a... Nundu?</p>
<p>She looks at the permit, just to make sure she has read correctly and then serves herself some of the firewhisky she had reserved for especial occasions. She's aware that definitely doesn't count as 'especial' but she needs something strong to drink at the moment.</p>
