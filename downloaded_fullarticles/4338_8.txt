<p></p><div class="storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy"><p>A shadow, hidden in the dark, watched a young man sitting on the grass. That alone wouldn't have been so interesting, no it was the fact that the person was sitting there by himself. Okay even that is not so spectacular right? Just a boy who wanted to be alone for some time. But considering that the young man was Harry Potter it was pretty interesting. The Potter heir was almost never seen alone in all his time at Hogwarts. But that had changed in the last two weeks. Ever since his name had come out of the goblet everything had changed.</p><p>The house of the kind had started to show their malicious side, the smart ones had become nothing but gossipers, his own house didn't believe him. And as if that wasn't enough his best friend had called him a cheater. The only hope the boy had, his other best friend, had also started to distance herself.</p><p>Harry Potter was truly alone.</p>
<hr/><p>The shadow watched with interest as Harry pulled out a piece of parchment and began to scribble down something .After a few minutes he seemed to have finished his note because he packed the parchment away and just laid in the sun.</p><p>The Shadow formerly known as Pansy Parkinson argued with herself if she should talk to the young man. Even if Pansy would never admit it she was always intrigued with the mystery that was Harry Potter. Just as she was about to decide the decision was taken from her.</p><p>Pansy could hear voices coming from the castel. She the heard the footsteps and the persons shouting were none other than her housemates Draco Malfoy,Blaise Zabini and Daphne. At first she didn't understand what was going on but as they came nearer she began to progress what they were saying.</p><p>The Slytherins were searching for Blaise's snake. She must have escaped from the dungeons once again and it seemed that she was somewhere around here.</p>
<hr/><p>Harry was just trying to relax for a few minutes before he would have to face his peers again. Then he heard the voice of Draco Malfoy and some other Slytherins approaching and knew his rest was over. As it seemed they were searching for someone. He wondered who the person was that they were searching for because he couldn't remember to ever have heard the name was still searching for a face to the name as he heard a small hiss from a few meters beside him.</p><p>,,<em>Stupid humans ...Want to take me back inside the cold. Don't they know I need the sun to live.</em>''</p><p>Harry wanted to laugh. Not only had a Slytherin snake a snake as pet, no he also didn't know how to care for the it. If he didn't pity the snake - The animal, he would probably find it so he just looked to where he assumed the snake to be and started talking.</p><p>,, <em>h</em><em>ello ... eh ... snake ''</em></p><p>The snake was by his side in nothing more than a moment.</p><p>,,<em> You ... you... speak can understand me.''</em></p><p><em>,,Yes'' </em>Harry answered</p><p>The snake was quiet for a moment. Then she looked nervous - as far as snakes can look nervous - at him.</p><p>,,<em> Could you ... could you ... talk with my human and explain to him why I need to go outside?''</em></p><p>Harry didn't know what to do. On one side he wanted to help the snake but on the other side he really wasn't in the mood for more insults thrown his way. I the end his need to help people, and snakes, won. He stood and held his arm out to the snake. She happily wrapped herself around it. He sighed and stalked in the direction of Malfoy,Zabini and Greengrass.</p>
<hr/><p>Draco Malfoy wasn't having a good day. Not only was Harry Potter the only thing the pupils of Hogwarts would talk about, also his friend Blaise had managed it yet again to lose his pet snake and now he had to help search for it.</p><p>Then he saw said Gryffindor coming towards him.</p><p>,,What do you want Potter?'' the other boy didn't flinch,didn't blink, no he just looked at him. Then he spoke with such a melodious and still confident tone that Draco couldn't help himself but be jealous.</p><p>,,I heard you shouting for someone. Is that someone possibly a snake ? ''</p><p>,,Yes ''blurted Blaise out ,,Have you seen her ? ''</p><p>Harry just showed them his arm. Around it was comfortably wrapped a snake. Blaise wanted to take the snake but she just hissed at him, well it looked like she was hissing at him, when in reality she hissed at Harry to remind him that he said he would talk to "her human".</p><p>Harry tried to calm her and answered her in Parseltongue .</p><p>,,<em>Calm down.I didn't forget it. Actually I will talk to him right now, okay?''</em></p><p>The snake nodded and Harry turned his head to look in the unbelieving faces of the three Slytherins He waved his hand in front of their faces.</p><p>,,Hey, you okay? ''</p><p>The Slytherins snapped back to reality and just nodded.</p><p>,,Well '' Harry said ,,Your snake asked me to pass along a message. She said that the Castle is too cold for her. She needs the warmth of the sun. You should probably go outside with her more often or at least apply a heating charm.''</p><p>The Slytherin just nodded. Harry let the snake slither over to Blaise,nodded his head and turned to walk away. He was already a few meters away when he heard something he never thought to hear from a Slytherin.</p><p>,,Thank you ''</p><p>It was nothing more than two words. It was nothing special and still he felt the warm feeling in his heart.</p>
<hr/><p>Pansy smiled as she saw them talking. For some people it may seem like nothing but to the her it was a big step.<br/>
Maybe there was Hope for her ...</p></div></div>
