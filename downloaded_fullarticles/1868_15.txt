  <strong>Prologue: An Agent and a Spy Walk Into a Bar</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>February 1, 2007; Washington D.C.</em>
</p><p><em>Very</em> Special Agent Anthony “Tony” DiNozzo was drawn into the bar by the sounds of low saxophone and steady bass.</p><p>He’d wandered far from his normal haunts, seeking a bit of something – anything – to get him out of his own head, out of his cover identity, out of his mask as Jeanne’s boyfriend to get information on her arms-dealer father, out of the role of Gibbs’ faithful St. Bernard, and let him just <em>be</em> for a moment before he forgot who Tony was under all the rest of the crap that’d been piled on him in the last year or more, ever since a rogue Agent from Mossad managed to kill his partner and another wormed her way onto his team.</p><p>Inside the low-lit bar, he found a scattering of the usual suspects: older beta gentlemen and their ladies with a love of jazz, an obligatory alpha wannabe-mobster in the corner, the jaded bartender polishing glasses, nothing to surprise and exactly what he was looking for.</p><p>Even, with a single glance at a tall drink of water posted up on a barstool nearest the stage, a distraction better than any glass of cognac and jazz for the night.</p><p><em>Omega</em>, his alpha instincts whispered at a single scenting of the bar as Tony went over to the bar and gave his order, raising his glass in silent salute to the male omega who was quite the picture.  He had his elbows leaning back on the bar behind him, one foot clad in red-soled leather hooked on the barstool’s lower rung as his far-leg dangled down putting him in a near-arch showing off every line of his lithe, elegant body with the long torso of a male omega necessary to provide the internal room for two sets of sex organs.  Almost too pretty for classical handsomeness, he was the – smoking a cigar and letting smoke all-but-fall from his lush lips – androgynous perfection that belonged to the rarest section of society, the sought-after omega.</p><p>And no matter what propaganda the conservative politicians tried to spout, the most <em>dangerous</em> section of society as Tony well knew from both his career as a detective and as a federal agent.</p><p>Ari would have taught him that when he shot Caitlin cold and played with all of them at NCIS for nearly a year if nothing else.</p><p>If this was one of Tony’s normal haunts or a place he’d ever been before in his life, he would instantly be on guard.</p><p>As it was…all he saw was more temptation than any self-respecting unbonded alpha would turn away from even if he wasn’t in the market for a distraction for the evening.  If an omega like <em>that</em> couldn’t get him out of his own head – from the top of his rich crimson head to the bottoms of his Louboutins – then nothing could.  Hazel eyes caught his own jade green gaze, not an ounce of anything but confidence dripping from them in wordless beckon.</p><p>Far be it from Tony to keep a beautiful omega waiting.</p><p>Trailing one hand down the edge of the silk-smooth wood of the old bar rail, Tony stopped just an inch too close into the omega’s space.</p><p>“Tony.”  He introduced himself, leaning in even closer to brush his breath against one ivory-shelled ear that glowed even in the dusk of the bar.</p><p>Hazel eyes dancing between green and gold under the lights lifted.</p><p>Red-heads were usually his boss, Gibbs’, kryptonite but if any of his ex-wives had looked like this Tony could see why.</p><p>“Hariel.”  The omega tapped out his cigar in the crystal ashtray on the bar.  “Charmed, I’m sure.”  Rising to his feet, the omega, Hariel – a bit of an atypical name even if the unisex nature of it was as expected as the lush British accent was not – stood, smirking a bit with a wicked glint in his eyes as Tony failed to move back, pressing that long, lithe body against his own runner’s form before moving around him, only looking back at a watchful Tony when he was three paces away.  “Well?”  Hariel asked, smirk moving into a full-on wicked grin.  “Aren’t you coming?”</p><p>“Not yet.”  Tony tossed out a grin of his own as he fell into step just behind that lean form.  God.  He <em>loved</em> a confident omega, especially the type that wasn’t looking for the Mr. Right Alpha trope that society tried to brainwash them into but operated on a first-name-only basis.  “But I have high hopes.”</p><p>Omegas like Alphas were more instinctual, more need-driven than their Beta counterparts.</p><p>Traditional thought said that such was why early bonding was the best “solution” to said needs.</p><p>Traditional thought was boring and also the reason why in a lot of countries both omegas and beta females had to fight for equal rights under the law, making <em>traditional thought</em> as much of a fucker as the assholes that tried to advocate for it in the halls of congress.</p><p>Following behind an omega that moved with a trained elegance Tony’d seen on both Ari and his beta sister who was now a permanent member of Tony’s team Ziva, made him glad he’d never been one for tradition even as he followed said omega all the way to a five-star hotel, a bedroom, and silken sheets that led to perhaps one of the best nights of his life.</p><p>A night cut far too short with a single phone call in the morning.</p><p>“DiNozzo.”  Turning he glanced back over his bare shoulder at the rumpled form of Hariel, a form that had taken more effort than he’d thought to make look so thoroughly debauched from the reddened marks on ivory skin to the bedhead of crimson hair that turned a bit dark fiery auburn in the early morning sun.</p><p>“We got a case.”  Gibbs’ grouchy voice came over the air.</p><p>“On your six, boss.”  Tony sighed, taking one last glance over his shoulder before he hung up his phone at the click from Gibbs doing the same.  Moving quietly through the room he collected up his clothes, glad that he kept a go-bag in his car even though he’d have to catch a cab back to where he’d left it last night.</p><p>Returning to the bed after he’d dressed, he debated with himself for a long moment before making a decision and crossing back to Hariel’s side.  Placing his palms flat on the bed beside the redhead’s pillow, he leaned down and pressed a kiss to one smooth ivory cheek, then the elegant curve of a shoulder.</p><p>“Thanks, sweetheart.”  He whispered his goodbye, then turned from the room and was gone.</p><p>…</p><p>003, operative and analyst for Her Majesty’s Special Intelligence Service, also known as Hariel James Potter, wasn’t your normal Omega, even for one that had been specially recruited from his graduating class at Oxford to join the SIS.</p><p>That Hariel was also Lord Potter despite his Omegan status was solely thanks to a single piece of legislation that had been signed into law in the UK in 1972 called the Equal Inheritance Act which prevented courts and institutions of law or estate executors from preventing an Omega or female Beta from inheriting based on their primary and secondary genders.</p><p>Still, it hadn’t been his status as Lord Potter that had drawn the eye of the indomitable M, nor had it been his degree in Business and Forensic Accounting, nor his time as a Royal Marine Cadet or with the RAF’s university air squadron as he tried to decide whether to join the Royal Marines or the RAF after college.</p><p>It was surviving three attacks upon his person before reaching eighteen years of age.</p><p>Hariel found himself recruited along with his cousin Caelum by the SIS before either could blink, both serving first strictly as analysts as they worked to protect the country their families had a long line of serving, before a year into their service a double-oh slot had opened and M had moved Hariel into the opening as a fully-vested operative.</p><p>He was a spy and a killer.</p><p>Odd, some would think for an Omega, but <em>not</em> when one considered that as an Omega he possessed the drive of a male to protect those he loved and the ferocity of a mother to do the same.</p><p>Channeling those drives into his work had done a great deal to keep himself sane when the society he moved through in his civilian persona looked askance at unbonded Omegas of his and his cousin’s ages.</p><p>His latest run-in with such had driven him to a smoky jazz club Caelum had found for him, his cousin slotting into position as Hariel’s handler a year after he’d been made 003.  DC society wasn’t the same as that of the bluebloods he dwelled among in London but at the same time it was all the same.  A charity event was doing double-duty for Hariel, tracking a target and brushing up his Lord Potter persona all at the same time, though a few of the weak-willed and weaker-chinned beta males and alphas that had made passes at him had made him wish he wasn’t playing <em>himself</em> so that he could take his preferred painful response to importuning hands that patted his arse or lingered on his hands or arms.</p><p>The bar offered a few things in particular Hariel required when he wanted to unwind: a decent selection of Scotch, mellow music – jazz, blues, or otherwise, and while quiet had enough of a clientele to leave the <em>possibility</em> for a discrete liaison away from the judging eyes of high society on the table.</p><p>He’d brought his own cigars.</p><p>Though, this being the States, he thought he’d have more of a challenge regarding the latter when a few wrinkled noses, but the snicker from the barkeep when he’d brought over a dusty crystal ashtray made him think that this particular establishment must have some sort of protection regarding anti-smoking laws.</p><p>Perhaps being billed as a private club or some such.</p><p>Hariel leaned back against the bar in a flaunting show of his lean omegan body, smirking to himself at the glares <em>that</em> got him from the same nose-wrinklers as before, slowly working his way equally between a highball of Scotch and his cigar, letting the music roll over him and relax him to the point that he was about to call it a night after dismissing more than one alpha or beta who’d approached him since he’d posted up near the stage when a fine bit of Alpha wandered in from the cold February night.</p><p>Arching a brow, Hariel let his eyes drag from the tips of Italian-shod feet to the messily-ruffled brown hair, inspecting the long – and strong – legs of a runner and the broad shoulders under fine tailoring that spoke of an active sort, sport of some kind, while the sharp gaze that took in the bar in a single glance was all training.</p><p>A mix of military and either criminal or law enforcement or Q could send him out on his next op with only a water pistol.</p><p>His face was almost too pretty for an alpha and that body was just what the doctor – or handler – ordered for a bit of mutual decompression if Hariel was reading him at all correctly, with a confidence as the alpha moved towards him that spoke more of an arrogant assurance in his own charms more in line with Bond than the raw animal sexuality of Trevelyan.</p><p>All the better.</p><p>James might not be Hariel’s cup of tea – he’d leave <em>that</em> morass of issues for Q, thank you very much – but he couldn’t deny 007 was a sexy bastard of an alpha.</p><p>Another cut from the same cloth should be <em>more</em> than capable of wearing Hariel out.</p><p>And when Hariel woke to the irritating sound of a softly-buzzing cell phone in the wee hours of the morning, with a pleasant, languorous ache in his muscles and a lingering buzz of bliss in his head, he’d say that Tony had been <em>more</em> than up to the job of stress reliever, though he was a bit put out that any ideas of another round had been squashed before it could really be entertained.</p><p>Listening even as he kept up the façade of sleep, Hariel was pleased to overhear enough to know that he’d been right: law enforcement, and to gain a last name to go with the first – if Tony was his real name.</p><p>Definitely Italian then with a name like Tony DiNozzo, even if the looks and the clothes hadn’t given it away along with his slipping into Italian endearments when his blood was up.</p><p>Hariel nearly gave himself away with a happy purr when Tony leaned in and kissed him goodbye.</p><p>Too bad that the charity event was over and he was due back in London.</p><p>He wouldn’t mind another go around with Tony, even if he had to “accidentally” find himself at one of the other man’s favorite haunts or three to accomplish it.</p><p>Little did either of them know that their night together left them with more than fond memories and a languorous release for a night.</p>
