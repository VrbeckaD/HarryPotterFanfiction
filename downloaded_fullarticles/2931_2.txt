  <span>Beep Beep Beep</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry reached out trying to slap the incessant noise blaring next to his head. After smacking the alarm clock, Harry sat up in bed and looked around. It was still unusual waking up in his own space. After defeating Voldemort, Harry needed space. His own space, so could figure out who he was without the pressures of being the Golden Boy, Chosen One, or any other name he was being called by his adoring fans. “Fans” he thought. Yeah right, no one in all this time, except maybe three people had cared enough to learn who he really was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was weird not having to reach for glasses every morning. With the Horcrux in his head gone, Harry’s eyesight had cleared up within a few weeks. He had then found a small apartment, told his friends he would see them for eighth year, and started spending the summer figuring things out. His apartment was small and humble, but to him it was perfect. No one in the neighborhood knew who he was and he could explore the small town in peace. Lately, he had found himself spending hours in the local library. Harry distanced himself from the wizarding world, barely even using his magic. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry began his day with a hot shower. He had actually found some products that could tame his hair and begun wearing it in long curls. Today was both nerve-wracking and exciting. All his life, though he never told anyone, sometimes he just wanted to be feminine and even to be seen as a girl. Some days he was fine being Harry. Now he was free to explore. He had gone shopping, for the first time loving his petite frame, as it allowed him to find some really cute feminine clothes. Lately, they were feeling more feminine, and today Raven was going to make her first appearance out in the world. Harry had been practicing, He got his ears pierced, bought makeup and had practiced over and over until he had a look that he liked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After spelling off what little body hair they had, Harry rubbed the nice smelling body lotion they had found all over. They loved how soft their skin felt and how pretty it smelled reminding them of the flowers in Petunia’s garden. Some of their only good memories from back then were in that garden. Harry then pulled a fluffy robe on and sat at the vanity in their room. It was time to start the small transformation into Raven. Brushing out their long hair, which now had emerald tips thanks to the local salon, they let it hang in curls framing their face. They applied a soft smokey eyeshadow that made the green in their eyes pop even more. Raven took care to apply their makeup. It wasn’t heavy and greatly accented his more feminine features like his lips and eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After doing their makeup and hair, Raven began to dress. They found they liked a bit of a goth/punk look no matter which gender they were presenting as that day. Today was a mesh long sleeve shirt under a tight tee with a band that Raven really liked on it. A knee length skater skirt under which were pulled thigh high socks. Lastly, knee high converse were pulled on and zipped up. Being short and petite Raven didn’t worry about a bra or trying to create the appearance of breasts. They still looked incredibly feminine without them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once dressed, Raven moved to the kitchen and ate a simple breakfast of fruits and cereal. Today was also special for another reason. They had discovered that the library held a LGBT club for youths in the area. Having never known anyone who was out of the closet at Hogwarts, at least not personally, they were excited to meet teens their own age, maybe even learn how to fit into that world. It had been wonderful getting away so far this summer, but they were getting lonely now that they had figured out a few things with help from the library books.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To be honest, they were getting more help than that. Harry wasn’t stupid and once settled, had found a mind healer they could trust. The two of them met three times a week right now. Harry still struggled to open up about the childhood of abuse and neglect they had lived. More recent events like school, and his exploration of his identity were going much smoother. It was progress though and Sarah made it easy to go at Harry’s pace. She treated the teen like any other patient not caring about their fame, just caring about how to help them unburden themself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shaking their head at the memory, Raven gathered up her purse and the leather jacket she had found in a second hand shop. It was battered a bit but they fell in love with it as soon as they saw it. It had patches sewn all over it, and fit their style no matter how they were expressing themselves. They took a deep breath and headed out towards the center of town. It was a beautiful day, not too warm and for once not raining. Raven took their time, pulling out a muggle music player and popping in the ear buds as they walked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The heavy beats helped boost their nerves and soon they were smiling and waving hello to people as they passed. So far no one was giving the young lady any weird looks. Raven’s confidence was growing realizing that people just saw her as she wanted to be seen. It was freeing for the first time in their life. Raven breathed in deep, feeling more weight lift off their young shoulders. Maybe, just maybe she could make this work. They wondered how their friends would react when they returned to school. Raven didn’t know, but it was time for them to stop hiding who they were and live for themself not everyone else.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before Raven knew it she was standing in front of the library steps. “Well guess it’s time for Raven to make some friends and see if at least some part of the world will accept me.” Raven plucked up her Gryffindor courage, put her music back in her bag, and began climbing the steps. Once inside she went up to the librarian at the desk. A nice older lady, with greying black hair, who looked up as Raven approached. “Excuse me?” Raven used the voice they had practiced with. “Can you please tell me which room the LGBT club meets in?” Upon receiving directions and pleased their voice sounded so natural, Raven made her way quickly to the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Arriving shortly she found she was a few minutes early and took a seat towards the back. A pair were up at a table along the side of the room. It looked like snacks and drinks were being provided for the meeting. The boy and girl nodded to Raven, but let her be as they sat down. Soon the room was filling up with more teens and even some who seemed younger. Raven was surprised. They never once thought they could have been that open that young. Their “family” certainly wouldn’t have liked it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Teens and kids mingled around the room. Raven realized they weren’t the only one sitting by themself. Must be more new people she assumed. As the time got closer to 10am, an older teen went up to the podium at the front and leaned against it. He cleared his throat loudly. “Ok everyone please take a seat so we can get started.” The room got quiet as everyone took a seat. Raven breathed a sigh of relief as no one chose to sit right next to them. They were not sure if they were quite ready for that. Raven glanced up front as the boy began speaking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello everyone, for those of you who are new I am Jason, president of our queer little group here.” eliciting a few chuckles “My pronouns are He/him, I am bi and trans. This is usually how we introduce ourselves while here. Now you don’t have to tell us your orientation or if you are trans or not, but a name and pronouns at least makes sure that we all respect each other’s identity. Would any of our regulars like to introduce themselves, and you new faces, don’t be afraid to speak up as well. This is an accepting space, a safe space to be yourself.” Jason then sat down and different teens, and kids around the room began standing up. Raven tried to remember all the names and faces, but realized just like school this would take time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Raven sat there chewing on their lip. they wanted to say something, but how would the room react. Would they be laughed at and mocked. So far after every introduction was met by applause but what if they were weird and freakish even for this group. Even after one person who Raven could not figure out their gender, stood up and introduced themself as agender, they were still nervous. Finally, the last person sat down and there was silence for a couple minutes. Jason stood up “now if that is everyone the topic for today…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“WAIT!” Raven shot up. Then realizing how loud they had been and that everyone was staring, blushed and looked down sheepishly. “Sorry.” with an encouraging nod from Jason they began to speak. “Hi, umm sorry, I have never been to something like this ever. Umm, my name...Well my real name is Harry and I was born a boy. Sometimes I feel like a girl and then I am Raven. Sometimes, I feel in between and use either name. I don’t know what pronouns I should use, I guess maybe it changes. I don’t know this is all pretty new to me. Umm, I guess I have been attracted to both boys and girls, although hearing from some of you I may need a new term for that as well. I go to a boarding school in Scotland, and was finally free this summer to start figuring myself out. I was hoping to get help here.” Raven was red faced as they caught themselves rambling. They looked around the room and quickly sat down almost ready to flee the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The room applauded, and that forced Raven’s head up. They were receiving smiles from almost all the faces in the room and Jason had a grin that made their stomach do flips. Raven nodded graciously before turning their attention back to Jason. “Pleasure to meet you Raven. There are many in this room who would be willing to help you figure things out myself included. Now then, the topic for today is expression. How we express our identity, and how little it matters what society thinks. Society does not get to dictate how we should look, or how we fit into so-called ‘normal’ gender roles.” Jason then introduced a guest speaker. A professor who would talk about the psychology of expression and what it meant. Jason came and sat by Raven as the speaker began. They nodded at his unspoken question for consent to sit next to them. They again felt a flutter as Jason smiled sweetly at them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The rest of the meeting went smoothly and Raven picked up quite a bit of info. Afterwards there was time to mingle. At first they felt nervous, but Jason offered to lead her around which she gratefully accepted. There were others like them in the group. Genderfluid was the term Raven learned worked best for their situation. Also, it was fine for them to switch pronouns, or they could use the gender neutral pronouns of they/them. Raven’s heart was soaring, they felt so accepted with each new person they met. Now they had terms to help describe how they felt. Finally, she was beginning to feel more comfortable with how they felt inside. It was nice and spread warmth through them...her, today was a her day.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Raven” Jason was searching for her attention. “We have to give up the room now. Usually a few of us older ones go out and get lunch after the meeting. Would you like to join us?” Raven nervously shook her head no, not quite ready for that. “Ok I know it can be hard stepping into a new group. How about coffee or tea tomorrow just the two of us. Come however you feel comfortable and we can get to know each other.” Raven blushed at this but nodded. “Ok then, see you tomorrow at 2. Oh and Raven, you’re really pretty.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she stood there in shock, Jason smiled and slipped away. In a daze, she began walking back home. Had she just been asked on a date? Jason was really cute. Oh Merlin, what should she wear. What if she felt like Harry tomorrow? Would Jason still find them pretty then? Did they want him too? Raven realized she was in for a long night as all these thoughts swirled through her head. She smiled, at least the rest of this summer should be interesting.</span>
