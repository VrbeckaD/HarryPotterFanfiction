    <p>The evening sun cast a golden hue on the green hills of the small town. The hills led into a shroud of tress, thick with secrets, even the sun only able to pierce the thickness with but a few beams at its highest point. It was a boundary young Newt Scamander was barred from entering – as had been the words of his mother. More times than not, his brother, Theseus, had come after him, to ensure he obeyed their mother’s warning. Newt’s social awkwardness and sometimes-overly-direct responses had pushed him away from having human companions, instead leading him into the comfort of various creatures and beings, much to both his mother’s and brother’s discontent.</p>
<p>Though their mother had a love of creatures, even raising hippogriffs, having her youngest son only seek the company of magical creatures was a bit concerning.</p>
<p>Even still, Newt found himself searching the outdoors for different creatures, sometimes finding injured creatures and nursing them back to health. When he was eight and had found an abandoned and sick kneazle kit, he brought it home, asking his mother to help take care of it and nurse it back to health. The poor kneazle failed to make it through the night and Newt cried for three days, unable to understand what he had done wrong for the small animal to lose its life. His mother tried to explain how some creatures were beyond help, no matter how much they tried, but Newt failed to understand and wound up in his brother’s room, locking himself in a closet. Theseus had come home for his Christmas holiday from Hogwarts and was able to coax his brother out. Or rather, he had coaxed himself in. He went into the closet and sat with his younger brother for several hours,</p>
<p>Newt had always disliked physical contact from anyone since he was able to talk and walk. Even being touched by a stranger would send the small child into a round of hysterics; so when Theseus found himself sitting next to his brother in a dark closet, he could not even reach out to him, in fear of sending his sibling into a panic. Instead, he had distracted him with various spells he had learned at school: lights, fireworks, creature silhouettes.</p>
<p>It was the latter that had Newt laugh.</p>
<p>After a few more magics, Newt fell into his brother, hugging him.</p>
<p>It was a reaction that had the older Scamander draw back.</p>
<p>Newt hated physical contact, so much so that he actively pulled away from their mother when she would try to hug him.</p>
<p>While Theseus had always felt responsible for his younger brother, it was on that day when his protectiveness began turning into possessiveness – something he had not even realized at the time. So when it he was home on holiday from his first year training at the Ministry, his mother was home to greet him, while his younger brother was notably absent. With his first time being home since being brought on, his mother had a million and one questions, wanting to know every detail. There was over an hour’s worth of questions.</p>
<p>Outside of the home, the sun was beginning to fall below the hills. The shadows being cast through the windows drew his mother’s attention.</p>
<p>“Setting already? I wonder if Newton wants to help with rounding the hippogriffs for supper.” She looked to her oldest son, who glanced around and raised his brows. “Oh! He’s probably still out in the field – you know your brother.”</p>
<p>Theseus laughed as they got up from the wooden table. He followed his mother out the front door, it creaking on its hinges as it swung opened and slammed closed. Out on the front porch, she called Newt’s name. A few minutes passed and neither one of them heard any from of rustling, no movement of grass or weeds to hint of the child’s arrival.</p>
<p>Releasing a sigh, she turned to her son. “Theseus, would you go find your brother? He always lights up whenever you’re around.”</p>
<p>“He hasn’t changed in the least,” Theseus chuckled, his mother smiling.</p>
<p>“Not at all. Though I do wonder why he’s stayed out so late. He knew you were coming home today.” She looked to him. “You don’t mind, do you?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “Finding my rat of a little brother? Of course not.” He laughed at the look his mother gave.</p>
<p>With her disapproving look, he stepped off the porch, walking down the dirt path and veering off into the weeds. Even though Newt knew not to go beyond the boundary of the forest, he would still occasionally venture into the wood, usually garnering new cuts from various animals and creatures he would try to interact with. As Theseus made his way to the opening Newt was known to frequent, he recalled the time he found his little brother befriending a grindylow by the edge of the river, which became aggressive anytime Theseus had come too close. It was Newt who had calmed the creature down, said goodbye and approached Theseus, smiling up at his older brother as he walked passed him to return home. The grindylow spat water at Theseus before disappearing into the murky water.</p>
<p>Pushing passed the last bit of brush, Theseus’ expression fell when he failed to see Newt.</p>
<p>The only other place he knew his brother to venture was the wood itself, the place even Newt knew he was barred from entering. The mere thought of his little brother crossing the threshold into unparallel danger drove Theseus into a panic – the type of panic those at the ministry attempted to drive him towards to see how he would react, though still unsuccessful. While simulations could be thrown at him left and right, nothing brought more fear into his heart than the well-being of his younger sibling.</p>
<p>His train of thought brought him to the threshold of the forest, the unending darkness strewn before him.</p>
<p>“Newt!” he called out, hoping to garner a response from somewhere other than within – or a response at all. “You know you’ll be in trouble with mum if you don’t come home now!” He waited for some form of response. Still, there was nothing. Every instinct pushed him into the forest, sensing his younger brother was in the wood beyond.</p>
<p>The setting sun barely pierced the veil of trees of the forest, leaving it dark and foreboding. He took out his wand and cast <em>Lumos</em>, illuminating the darkening dirt path that cut through the forest and curved from view. Shining the light near the ground, he could make out small shoeprints. There was no doubt in his mind they were Newt’s and all reasoning left him. He called out his brother’s name again, this time yelling as loud as he was able. With his attention on the prints, he took off down the path, just short of running, his wand moving between the indentations and the path ahead.</p>
<p>He stopped short when the footprints ended suddenly.</p>
<p>High-pitched cackling echoed around him and he turned sharply, shining the light behind him, only to see nothing but darkness. “Newt?” There was the echo of more cackling coming off the path. Despite his better judgement, he stepped off the last bit of safety there was of the wood, his boots crunching on leaves and twigs. There was more cackling, this time louder, becoming clearer and more apparent as he crept forward. As the light at the tip of his want casted shadows against the trees, his eyes caught the pale illumination of a face in the distance. “Newt?” He inched forward, listening to the sounds around him while being acutely aware of what was to his front. He could hear more cackling, followed by the sounds of scratching.</p>
<p>The light fell on the familiar form of his ten-year-old brother.</p>
<p>What should have been met with air of relief was replaced with fear and panic.</p>
<p>Newt was sitting on the ground with his back against the truck of a tree. His eyes were closed, head fallen to the side, a small, stick-like object was protruding from above the collar of his shirt. Yet, it was not his unconscious brother than had his heart drop, but the creatures that were crawling on him.</p>
<p>Three erklings were surrounding him.</p>
<p>One was crawling up his shoulder, another on his leg and the third was staring at him, its yellow eyes and sharp-toothed grin filled with nothing but nightmares. It was a split second before it shot a small projectile towards him. In an instant, he jumped off to the side, casting <em>flipendo</em> and sending the creature flying backwards. The reaction garnered the attention of the two others and they abandoned his brother, one coming towards Theseus as the other fired another dart. He cast <em>protego</em>, the dart bouncing off the shield and shooting into a random direction as the one charging him slammed into it, releasing a high-pitched squeal.</p>
<p>“<em>Ours</em>,” the one who had fired the dart spoke in a haunting voice, mimicking human speech.</p>
<p>“No.” Theseus pointed his wand at it. “Mine.” Before it had a chance to attack, Theseus summoned <em>diffindo</em>, slicing the erkling into two. The one that had charged at him recovered. Seeing its brethren now in two pieces, it stared at Theseus, made a hissing noise and ran off into the darkness of the surrounding forest.</p>
<p>Once the threat was subdued, Theseus lowered his wand, his heart pounding viciously in his chest. He stumbled to his little brother, falling in front of him as his shaking hands reached up to grab Newt’s cheeks. Seeing the dart in his brother’s neck, he pulled it out, grimacing as a small line of blood trickled towards the collar of Newt’s shirt. His eyes burned as he focused on Newt’s face.</p>
<p>“Newt? Wake up, Newt, come on, now.” He ran his hands through his brother’s hair.</p>
<p>Newt’s eyes scrunched and he released a groan. With squinting eyes, he found his brother’s face, smiling weakly at the familiarity.</p>
<p>“The—seus,” he trailed out, his lips curving upwards. “The music was pretty.” It was the only thing he said before his head fell forward, caught by his older sibling.</p>
<p>Theseus pulled him forward, wrapping his arms around him.</p>
<p>“I’m sure it was, Newt.” He stood up, bringing his brother with him and allowing Newt’s head to rest on his shoulder. Back on the path, he followed it out, having to rely on the sounds of his shoes on the dirt as the sun had completely set. Once back under the sky, he shifted his hold on Newt, who groaned and pressed against him.</p>
<p>Back at his mother’s home, she stood up from where she was sitting on the porch.</p>
<p>“Found him asleep in the field,” Theseus said before his mother could ask.</p>
<p>She smiled as Theseus passed her into the house. “I’ll have to round up and feed the hippogriffs myself, then. Unless you’d like to assist your poor mother.”</p>
<p>“I’ll consider it.”</p>
<p>He ascended the wooden steps leading to the bedrooms. The comment his mother gave had him chuckle. He rounded the corner and walked to the end of the hall to Newt’s room, the door creaking as he pushed it opened with his foot. Newt’s room was filled with sketches of various creatures Newt had either seen or read about. The drawings were crude, clearly drawn by a child, but each creature was still identifiable. In a large mason jar by the window, a small lizard was resting under the dirt and twigs placed inside its enclosure and Theseus had to wonder how long Newt had been housing the reptile.</p>
<p>Newt shifted as Theseus laid him down on the bed. Pulling out the quilt from underneath him, he tucked Newt in, setting his hand on his head and running his fingers through his brother’s knotted hair. Leaning down, he laid a kiss on Newt’s forehead before turning to leave. The sound of rustling covers had him stop by the door. He looked over his shoulder to see Newt sitting up, his eyes forward and knees curled to his chest.</p>
<p>Theseus inhaled and approached his sibling, whose face was a light shade of pink. He knelt down, watching him, waiting. If he had learned anything about his little brother, it was that Newt would talk when he wanted to or if he wanted to at all. The silence lasted for a few minutes. Theseus’ attention darted around the room while Newt’s stayed on the one spot on his bed.  </p>
<p>“Are you…mad at me?” Newt’s quiet voice pierced the veil.</p>
<p>For a moment, Theseus wondered if he heard wrong, but as Newt fell quiet again, he knew an answer had to be given. He sighed and dropped his shoulders. The bed shifted when he sat next his brother, who visibly tensed. “I could never be mad at you.” Newt’s eyes darted to him, though he made sure to avoid his face. “You scared me, though, by doing something you knew you weren’t supposed to do.”</p>
<p>He watched as Newt started playing with a loose thread on the quilt. “I didn’t mean to….”</p>
<p>“I know.” He set his hand on top of Newt’s head, ruffling his hair, much to Newt’s annoyance. “You make me mental, but I’d never let anything happen to you.”</p>
<p>He wrapped his arms around Newt’s shoulders and pulled him to where his head was against his chest. Newt tensed, but did not try to get away, instead staring at his brother’s left arm. “Did you tell Mum?”</p>
<p>“Nah. She doesn’t need to fret over nothing. She’s too old – her heart might give out.”</p>
<p>He smiled when he heard Newt snort.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t nice.”</p>
<p>For the first time, Newt pressed into him, gripping his shirt. Theseus wrapped both arms around Newt, holding him close as he set his chin on his head and closed his eyes. After a small while, Newt’s breaths started to become deep and slow, his body relaxing as he slipped into sleep. Theseus held him tighter and kissed the top of his head. It was in that moment when he finally admitted to himself that Newt was his and no one else’s. He was the only person his little brother trusted, the only one he would willingly touch and cling to – Newt was his and he would be damned to lose him.</p>
<p>Newt was his - only his.</p>
