<p>Harry settled into his desk chair in his study, his two trunks expanded and dumped on the desktop. He had spent a fun lunch with the twins at their store, sharing a meal and chatting about their latest exploits and experiments. They had needed to get back to the shop and he had needed to unpack, so here be was, staring at his NEWT results. Harry hesitated for a moment before cracking the wax seals and unrolling it.</p>

<p>Es in Herbology and Arithmancy.</p>
<p>Well… Harry slumped back in his chair. This was what he had expected. When he had stepped back and looked at his skills, he knew he wasn't perfect at those two subjects. Except, he was a little disappointed.</p>
<p>Shaking off his encroaching petulance, Harry set aside his results, turning to his trunks instead. Opening his main trunk, he extracted all of his writing supplies. Setting the parchment and quills in their different cubbies in his desk.</p>
<p>Checking through the rest of the suitcase, he finished in the library section. It was time to set up his library. Waving his wand, he removed all of the books that were currently in the shelves, clearing a space in the middle of the room to stack them all neatly. The books in his trunk joined them next.</p>
<p>"Dobby?" Harry called, the little elf popped in with a smile and a bounce.</p>
<p>"Yes, Master Harry?"</p>
<p>"Will you please take this trunk and unpack my things? Most of my clothes probably need to be cleaned, and any potions ingredients can go down into the lab."</p>
<p>"Of course Master Harry, Dobby will do right away." The little elf popped away with the trunk.</p>
<p>Turning back to the second trunk on his desk, Harry cracked the lid with a sigh. He wasn't even sure all of these books would fit. Looking around, he realised he would need to separate everything by topic before any other method was used. Thankfully, Hermione had given him a list of different spells she used to sort all of her books. The girl still hadn't figured out where Harry and Neville were disappearing off to and he was itching to see her expression when she realised what she had missed out on.</p>
<p>Waving his wand once more, all of the books in the trunk began sailing out to settle in neat stacks on the floor.</p>
<p>With a swirl of his wand, making sure to encompass the small mountain of books before him, Harry chanted <em>liber generis subiecti</em>. Amazed, he watched the books carry out an intricate dance in his office. Floating around the room they whirled and twirled around each other, the magic assessing the content of each book before arranging them in piles by subject that reached almost to the ceiling.</p>
<p>Looking around the room, he acknowledged that he was definitely going to need more space. The bookcases had been half full when he had taken over the room. He had gone through those books, sending the ones he didn’t want to the main library, but still, there was not enough space by a long shot.</p>
<p>“Raff!” He called.</p>
<p>“Yes, Master Harry?” The little elf appeared with a pop.</p>
<p>“I seem to have a space issue.” Harry gestured to the shelves and to the mountain of books taking up most of the room.</p>
<p>The elf gazed around with wide eyes. “Master Harry gives Raff today and tomorrow. Return tomorrow night and study will be ready.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Raff, let me know if you need anything.” Harry smiled as he gathered up the empty library trunk and left.</p>
<p>He went to the sitting room, calling for Dobby and asking him to give the trunk back to Severus. Next, he called for Amor, their other house-elf, to bring him tea. Settling in for the night, Harry slowly translated a parsel text on defence while sipping tea.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Severus was almost giddy. He was leaving Hogwarts. No longer would he have to tolerate moronic students. While he was now willing to admit he enjoyed teaching NEWT students, teaching the younger years was the bane of his existence. Not only would he now be able to start his own business, brewing and experimenting as he pleased, but he would also no longer have to keep his marriage a secret. Granted, Severus was not an affectionate man, but the forced distance over the past year had made him appreciate the blessing that was his husband.</p>
<p>Teachers were required to remain at Hogwarts a final night after the students had departed. They were expected to attend a final breakfast in which they would debrief from the year. Last night he had packed everything he owned away. Leaving the paperwork necessary for his position in his empty office for the next Potion Master to take up the mantle. He only hoped they were better than Slughorn was.</p>
<p>Unable to wait, he called for Dobby to come and collect his things so that he would be able to simply walk out after the final staff meeting of the year, of his life. He arrived at breakfast at 7 am on the dot, the other teachers joining him over the next half an hour until finally, Minerva graced them with her presence. He ate in silence as the other teachers discussed the year. Severus had realised very quickly this year that his opinion was both unwelcome and unwanted. As the meeting was winding down, Minerva finally turned to him.</p>
<p>"Severus, I trust you have left the necessary paperwork somewhere accessible?" Her nose crinkled slightly in disgust at having to speak to him.</p>
<p>"Of course, all of my notes on the existing students, their grades, my previous curriculums and exams are all in the office waiting for the next Potion Master. Should any issues arise or my replacement requires assistance, they are welcome to owl me. If that is all you require of me, I have an appointment." Severus set aside his napkin.</p>
<p>He could see she was at war with herself. As the year had gone by, her revulsion at his presence had increased exponentially, to the point where she obviously loathed being in the same room as him. On the other hand, the opportunity to inconvenience him was almost too good to pass up.</p>
<p>She frowned a little petulantly. "Yes, thank you, Severus. You may leave." The woman immediately turned back to the conversation with the rest of the staff, dismissing him harshly.</p>
<p>He pushed aside all possible reactions to the behaviour. Rising gracefully, he left the hall. Walking to the ward line, he used the time to cast aside the negative emotions inspired by the meeting, focusing on the husband waiting for him at Prince Manor.</p>
<p>Disapparating with a crack, he reappeared in the entrance hall. Checking the dining room and the sitting room, he was bemused at the lack of his husband. Checking the time he realised it was only just 9 am. It was possible that Harry was having a lie in to celebrate his graduation instead of going for his usual early morning run.</p>
<p>Making his way to the bedroom, he eased the door open to find the room quiet and dim. A lump in the middle of the bed suggested he was right in his guess. A thrill of excitement ran through him; sleepy Harry was one of his favourites. The man was always pliant and responsive. Unfortunately, with his propensity for early morning runs, Severus rarely got to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Stripping off quickly, he slid into bed, curling up behind Harry who was sprawled out, half on his side, naked. His skin was sleep warmed and supple. Sneaking a hand over one bare hip, Severus was overjoyed to find the other man was already sporting morning wood.</p>
<p>Harry thrust a little into his loose fist, sighing and shifting to expose his delectable arse even more. Severus had to suppress a moan, summoning their lubricant to slick up his fingers he began to prepare his husband. Working him open as gently and quickly as he could, Harry was moaning and rutting into the mattress by the time Severus slid home in one long smooth glide.</p>
<p>Severus curled around the other man, lying on his side, chest to back, top legs fitted together and pressed to Harry's chest. Tucking one arm under his head, the other snaked over Harry's waist to press a hand over his husband's heart. Unable to resist, Severus buried his crooked nose in the mass of black hair splayed out over the pillow as he rocked in and out.</p>
<p>This was perfection. This is what he had been missing all year. The smell of Harry on his pillow, intertwined with his husband. He had missed lazy mornings and quiet intimacies. Severus smiled when Harry tangled his fingers with the hand over his heart.</p>
<p>"Good morning love." Severus murmured in his ear, nosing along the shell.</p>
<p>Harry moaned loudly in reply, hand gripping his harder, so Severus lengthened his thrusts.</p>
<p>"Yes…" Harry sighed as the pair shifted further over onto his stomach. One knee was still pressed up as Severus began to thrust in earnest. Leaning down, Severus littered kisses along Harry's shoulders, tangling their hands together once more.</p>
<p>He revelled in just being able to exist in the moment. Without pressure or purpose beyond the two of them. There were no classes to get to, no mealtimes to adhere to, no societal rules to which they had to conform. There was just them.</p>
<p>Severus didn't chase his orgasm, instead letting it gently build, cresting and crashing over him, taking Harry along for the ride. Unwilling to separate from his husband, he cast a gentle cleaning charm on Harry, so that he wouldn't have to lie in a pool of cooling come. The pair resettled on their sides, spooned together with Severus' slowly softening cock still deep inside Harry.</p>
<p>"I love you too." Harry sighed dreamily and Severus could not resist a chuckle.</p>
<p>He was lucky that Harry did not expect more from him. That simple acts of love and affection were seen for what they were so that he need never be uncomfortable in expressing the genuine affection he felt. Pressing a kiss to the curve of Harry's shoulder, he tucked his nose into the soft hair in front of him and allowed himself to drowse away the morning, blissful at finding his home.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Harry and Severus spent a lazy day curled in bed together, taking their time to reacquaint themselves. It was creeping up on dinner time when Raff popped into their room.</p>
<p>“Master Harry, your study is ready.” The little elf bowed before popping away.</p>
<p>Having forgotten about the work being done to expand his study, Harry lurched up, throwing on a dressing gown and darting from the room. He missed Severus’ exasperated amusement as he also slowly rose and followed behind, tying his own robe closed.</p>
<p>Dashing down the hallway, Harry skidded to a stop at the door to his study, throwing a grin over his shoulder at Severus who was just rounding the corner. Opening the door, Harry stepped in and stopped.</p>
<p>Where once before the room had been one storey, it was now two. There was still a wall with floor to ceiling windows, a beautiful stained-glass design filling the top half, the bottom half now had French doors that opened out onto a small patio. The large desk faced towards the door which shared a wall with the generous fireplace. The landscape above had been removed and instead the wall above was covered in shelves. The remaining two walls were also covered in bookcases and all were heavily ladened with books. There was a curved railing running around the walled sides of the room which supported a sliding ladder so that you could reach the highest shelves.</p>
<p>It was beautiful. Absolutely perfect. Hermione was going to be so jealous.</p>
<p>He felt Severus move up behind him, cuddling up against his back as they both looked around the room in awe.</p>
<p>“I think your study is nicer than mine. Perhaps I should have Raff do something like this with mine. I have just been putting all my extra books in the library but it is getting overfull and I like the idea of having a study similar to this.” Severus mused as he nosed at the shell of Harry’s ear.</p>
<p>The younger man shivered in his embrace, turning in his arms to share a luxurious kiss. Hope filled his heart, they had a chance, they could fix the world, get their revenge on Dumbledore, and restore the balance that had been lost over the year. He was not alone any longer and together, they could win.</p>
