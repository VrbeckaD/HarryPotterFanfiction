    <p align="justify">Poppy Pomfrey knew she was in to deep now, she had crossed the line that had been drawn in the sand, she had to carry out what Albus Dumbledore ordered. Not only did it make sense, but she personally owed him as well as her father. Her father had been a wizard scientist that had worked for Dumbledore under the protection of the Nazis during the second world war. The experiments that her father had carried out had just born fruition. She had transplanted the magic core of an illegitimate half-blood boy from a prominent dark family into a light families squib baby boy. Poppy knew just as everybody in magical society that the only proper legitimate bondings in the magical society were between wizards and witches. Other magical creatures and muggles bondings to witches and witches did not count, and offspring from such unions were considered illegitimate.</p>
<p align="justify">The three powerful deities of the Magical World had finally enough. Lady Magic, Lady Fate and Lord Death weren't willing enough to accept how Dumbledore and his cronies played with the fates of wizards, witches and creatures. Neither the man nor his sick assistant know any shame. Not even from magically crippling his own son, recoiled Albus Dumbledore. He never wanted another magical male being be more powerful than himself. Only Albus Dumbledore should be the one, who be glorified by generations to come. The victims were justified by his mantra of the Greater Good.</p>
<p align="justify">But even then they were bound by the eternal rules, only a direct descendant of Dumbledore could bring justice to his victims. Severus Snape was originally destined to balance out the odds and to heal magic. With his stolen core, the task has been given over to his daughter Hermione and her best friend Harry Potter. However it has been decided that a plea from the young girl to Lady Magic would ensure that all victims of Dumbledore and his evil crony Poppy Pomfrey would receive their magic back, with a better protection around their magical cores and that all those that willingly destroyed the cores of magical children will not only lose their magic, but will face eternal damnation and punishment.</p>
<p align="justify">No member of the Prince Dynasty has known that Dumbledore used an illegal mix of potions and dark spells to ensure that Eileen Prince would willingly sacrifice her virginity to the old coot. And the first-born of this union had been personally blessed by Lady Magic, Lady Fate and Lord Death. Should Severus Snape been killed via magical means, the backlash would destroyed Wizarding Britain. Within a timespan from only five years all humans would lost their magical abilities forever, only the creatures would be allowed to keep it. The only humans who would be allowed to keep their magic would be the blessed ones, who have the gained the favour of Severus Snape or are his direct descendants.</p>
<p align="justify">Poppy wasn’t a fully qualified medi-healer, she had been thrown out of the course after the first year, the reasons given was that she hadn’t managed to complete the academic course work and her attitude towards groups of patients namely the poor, squibs and those with creature blood. Dumbledore had come through for her and employed her as Hogwarts Matron, where with advice and guidance from Dumbledore she had flourished and was well respected. The transplantation procedure of a magical core was tried again twice more over the years, one was the transplanting of two thirds of Bellatrix Black magical core into the Weasleys eldest son William, and the other was a failed attempt of transplanting Harry Potters magical core into Neville Longbottom after Voldemort’s defeat, but something stopped the transplant from taking place and had even managed to transplant half of the Longbottom’s core into Harry, making Neville Longbottom almost a squib. Dumbledore had been furious with the result, and relations between the Longbottom Matriarch Augusta was never as cordial to Dumbledore as before the failed transplant had taken place.</p>
<p align="justify">The Goblins who weren't pleased with Dumbledore's meddling has guided by Lady Magic performed a ritual that allowed them to figure out how many children were victims of this procedure. And when the children that has been gifted with those magical cores visits Gringotts for the first time, a Goblin would take them aside and after a test informed them about the truth. Frank Longbottom was devastated to hear, that he had been implanted the magical core of another boy, who had lost almost his complete magic as a result of it. He wanted to meet him, but it was denied again and again. As long as he didn't reach his majority and his family will sever all ties to Albus Dumbledore he wasn't deemed worthy to meet this special child.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> Dumbledore had decreed it was for the greater good, the magic gift was too good for the Snape half breed boy, it was better that he was just a muggle. Snape’s mother had gotten herself pregnant and had eloped from the Princes family. She had married the first muggle she could and had a baby boy, who even at the age of six months had shown great magical promise. Eileen Snape nee Prince had approached Albus, she had been given the chance to return to the bosom of her family and marry an older wizard, but she couldn’t bring along her illegitimate half breed son, so she had approached the boys natural father, one Albus to many names Dumbledore, and he had handled the situation for her, he had informed her after the tests had been carried out that their son Severus was a squib that had no magical core, and that the outbursts of accidental magical had really been Eileen wanting her son to be a powerful wizard, there were reported instances and cases of this happening. Eileen had then left Severus with her muggle husband and returned to the bosom of her family and divorced Tobias Snape.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> Lady Magic was displeased how Eileen Snape was willing to cripple her own son, only to get the chance to return to her family and abandon her son to a muggle. Knowing to well that she lied to him about his parentage. The blood adoption which she has done without his consent changed the looks of the little boy permanently, but this didn't interested the shallow woman at all. It has been decided that for her part in that crime, Eileen Prince will never be able to carry another magical child. Every child born by her will be squibs. The punishment would only be lifted, when she owned up her misdeeds in front of the Wizengamot, Gringotts and her family and informed them about the true identity of Severus' father.</p>
<p align="justify">Severus Snape had a good childhood, he was an intelligent child that excelled at school and was the apple of his fathers and step mothers eye. He attended the state muggle school and had managed to obtain his degree, before joining the Metropolitan Police, where through hard work he had risen to deputy chief constable. His father had enjoyed a drink, supported Manchester United football club and had a love affair with Steam trains especially the Great Western Railway, his step mother often said that she could understand Tobias liking his drink (always within his limits and he was never violent) and someone had to support Manchester United, but to love Steam Trains especially the Great Western Railway was just wrong!</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> Severus did wonder about his birth mother who wouldn’t, but really life for him was so good he didn’t miss her that often. He did have a dream where he met her and she broke down and begged him to forgive her. In the dream Severus had asked why she had abandoned him and that no he would not give her a kidney to save her life, as she was nothing to him, Eileen in his dream had spent years trying to find him and was distraught that she had left him and his father without a backward glance. The meeting place was always the same, it was in the restaurant of Harrods food hall.</p>
<p align="justify">“Please my son, have mercy with me. I know that I have wronged you greatly, but I did it for the Greater Good.”</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> “You got to be kidding me, Ms. Prince. No, I won't call you by that title, as you didn't deserve it. How could you have done something like that to your own flesh and blood?”, cried Severus angrily.</p>
<p align="justify">“You have dared to taken, what wasn't yours to take. And with that crime you have damned not only me, but Wizarding Britain. I do hope, that you're proud of yourself. I will never forgive nor forget what you have done to me.”</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> “Please, Severus. I do not want to harm you, but your father.”, began Eileen.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> “This man is not my father. He is only my sire. My father is Tobias Snape, the man who raised me with love and strictness. A man who has done everything for me and my stepmother to ensure that we will have a better life. I have to thank him for never abandon me as you have done it. Was it worth the prize, Ms Prince? Knowing that you damned your own flesh and blood? Magic is my birthright and thanks to your and his meddling it will be dying.”</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> “D-Dy-Dying?”, stuttered Eileen.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> “Indeed, it would have been my duty to free magic and to heal the damages which Albus Dumbledore had caused over the past decades. Thanks to your meddling this task has fallen to my daughter. My young, innocent Hermione have not only to face dark wizards but should shoulder a task, that can cost her life.”</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> “I was destined to became the greatest Potions Master of Britain and would be able to heal dark curses and even lycantropy. But as you have destroyed the major part of my magical core, it will never come true.”</p>
<p align="justify">Severus had in time married a dentist and they had a daughter called Hermione, Hermione for Severus was a happy mistake, to his wife Hermione was not a happy mistake and she resented Hermione for the missed opportunities that she caused her. Things had come to a head when Hermione had been invited to go to Hogwarts school, as she was a witch and needed special training to control her magic. Nobody in Severus or his wife’s family could understand where Hermione’s gift had come from, and then his wife had decided that Hermione was the spawn of the Devil for being a witch. However Severus, Tobias and her Grandmother, the stepmother of her father encouraged the young girl to honed her magical talents. Hermione’s mother had left them when Hermione had started at Hogwarts. Divorcing Severus and marrying a ministry worker, they had both emigrated to pastures new, helping people that needed it.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> The only thing the Dr Granger left her daughter was her surname, Hermione full name was Hermione Snape-Granger, but over the years it had been shortened to Hermione Granger. Nobody minded and Hermione just accepted her lot in life, she had found out quite quickly that magical society was prejudicial towards inferior people. Muggle born, squibs creatures and even half-bloods were only tolerated by the echelons of light magical society, she trusted Voldemort and the dark supporters more than Dumbledore and his light side and that was saying something really. As Voldemort had been trying to kill Harry every year since he had started at Hogwarts. She had become Harry’s and the Weasley twin’s friends, she was very wary regarding the other member of the Weasley family especially the two youngest children Ginny and Ronald. She knew that Ronald had help with his school work and his grades never reflected the effort or work he put into them, and she had worked out that the only reason that most of Ronald was Harry friend was the money he was being paid by Dumbledore.</p>
<p align="justify">Hermione had tried to be a true friend to Harry, especially the last year with the Tri-Wizard-Tournament, and now Dumbledore had decreed that Harry’s friends couldn’t write to him. So she had gone to her hero her father, and he had managed to find out where Harry lived during the holidays with his mother’s family.</p>
<p align="justify">Apparently her father had asked one of his subordinates to deliver the letters to Harry personally, and when the officer had gone to deliver the letters all hell had been let loose. Harry and his cousin Dudley had been removed from the family home and his aunt and uncle had been arrest and charged with child abuse and attempted child murder of one Harry Potter. Investigations had been carried out into how such horrific child abuse could not be detected by the proper authorities. It had subsequently been found out that all investigations into reported abuse of Harry Potter had been subverted by someone very high up in magical society. This person had not only allowed the abuse of Harry but had condoned it. Harry and Dudley had been fostered with Hermione and her family for the rest of the summer.</p>
<p align="justify">Then the Dementor attack had happened near Harry’s old home, two muggle boys had been given the kiss by a Dementor on the same day that Harry and Dudley had been taken into care. The two boys had been old friends of Dudley, Hermione was just glad that Harry and his cousin had been nowhere near where the dementors attacked. But that hadn’t stopped the Undersecretary to the minister of magic from summoning Harry to a hearing in front of the full Wizengamot for using magic in front of muggles. Her father had flipped and his anger towards the magical society had plummeted to new lows, and the level of anger hit tsunami level, when it was decreed by the Undersecretary that Harry had to still answer the summons. Her father had managed to contact Sirius at the order of the Phoenix headquarters, Grimmauld place and they were now sitting in the living room waiting for Albus Dumbledore to arrive and apparate them to Grimmauld place.</p>
<p align="justify">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p align="justify">The doorbell rang and Severus answered it, he would wait until the renowned headmaster Dumbledore had entered the living room before flaying him alive. God help the man if he had been the one to leave Hermione’s friend with the Dursleys all those years ago, it had only been fortunate that Harry and his cousin had grown to like each other, that Harry had survived in that abusive household. Dudley had tried to find ways of ensuring that Harry ate something every day, and when he could Dudley tried to help out with his cousins chores. They were lucky to find Harry when they did, any more time and the teenager might have died. Severus had sent the three children upstairs into Hermione’s room when the door bell had rung, what he had to say to Dumbledore should be said in private or more appropriately he felt under caution in one of his units interview rooms.</p>
<p align="justify">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Hermione was sat with Harry and his cousin in her bedroom listening into the conversation that was about to start downstairs. The teenager’s had managed to secret into the room one of the Weasley twin more sought after products, their expanding ears, which allowed people to listen into private conversations.</p>
<p align="justify">Hermione bedroom, like most teenagers was a mess. Her father hadn’t got round to making her a proper teenager room, the wallpaper was still the same from one that she had picked out with her father when she was nine, when she thought she was all grown up. The walls were now covered with different posters, wizarding posters and muggle pop posters battled it out together to be the most prominent. Her bookcases held her favourite muggle children books and games that had enthralled her till she went to Hogwarts School. Hermione sighed and joined the two boys for a quick round of poker, after all she always tried to increase her pocket money allowance when she could and counting cards wasn’t really illegal was it. And she had learned her poker face from her father. Not even a Slytherin could win against Hermione's poker face.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry had impressed her quite often over the years. As at the end of the first year the headmaster wanted to steal the house-cup from Slytherin he stood up and vetoed against it.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> <em>“Do it, and I transfer to another school, Headmaster”, had Harry hissed coldly. “Hogwarts is not the only magical school in the world. And do you think I'm naive? Hogwarts is one of the worst schools where you can get a magical education. The international test scores has shown it clearly. “</em></p>
<p align="justify"><br/> <em> “Mr. Potter sit down at once, as your Magical Guardian I do not condone such behaviour.”, admonished him Dumbledore sharply.</em></p>
<p align="justify"><br/> <em> “I don't care.”, replied Harry cheekily. “You have shown again and again that your not the best man for this job. “</em></p>
<p align="justify"><br/> This was the first time that Dumbledore had to do what Harry wanted, he couldn't risk to loose his pawn. But it was the start for him to look into darker spells and controlling potions.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> Hermione knew her parents especially her mother had a hard time with her magical gift, she had listened to conversations between her parents over the years. Her father she knew loved her unconditionally but her mother only saw her as an inconvenience, and since the visit by professor McGonagall her mother had further withdrawn from her, until she ignored her most of the time. It had been a relief when her parents finally divorced and her mother had emigrated to pastures new. Now she knew she had the unconditional love of her family and although her father’s temper was legendary, he never hit her and tried to treat her like an adult. Hopefully this weekend they could all visit her paternal family and be spoilt rotten.</p>
<p align="justify">Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p align="justify">Harry had been amazed when he and his cousin Dudley had been put into the care of Hermione’s dad, first thing they had done when he had finally been allowed to leave hospital was go clothes shopping. Both Hermione and Dudley had made vomiting noises and signs when they had been dragged in to old Marks and Spencer for his clothes, Harry didn’t care that they weren’t cool, they were his very own new clothes.</p>
<p align="justify">Everything suddenly stopped as Severus led Dumbledore into the living room, they all wanted to hear Severus lay into him, there was a muttering (why couldn’t adults talk louder) They heard from the living room voices , and one of them was Harry’s Godfather raised voice, they were astonished when they heard Severus say to Dumbledore:</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> “Do you think, I'm stupid. You were never the Magical Guardian of Harry Potter. And it doesn't matter as the forced participation in the Tri-Wizard-Tournament had him automatically emancipated. Try another one of your tricks and I'll guarantee you will be faster in Azkaban as you can say Quidditch.”</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> “To not try to deny it, you are a meddlesome old man, who thinks he is the second coming of Merlin. Enough is enough. I have a magical restraining order against you. Every time you overstep your boundaries you will get a shock from this collar. And neither of the children will ever be alone with you. Should you want a meeting, than his Head of House has to be there, too. Or his Godfather Sirius Black! Choose, old coot. I am not willing to risk their life for any of your hair brained schemes. This is the only warning you will get, old man. I would advise you to use common sense, but you have already proven that you don't have it at all.”</p>
<p align="justify">Dumbledore blustered and tried to persuade the adults present, that he had only being thinking about the greater good, that Harry had to be placed with his relatives in order for the blood wards to protect him. It was when he started to parrot out again about the prophecy concerning Harry and Lord Voldemort and how it hadn’t been fulfilled yet, that Severus had enough of the arrogant man he was just about to take Dumbledore to task when Sirius spoke again:</p>
<p align="justify">“Forget it Dumbledore, I have had enough of your lies and half-truths, you had kept me imprisoned on false charges so that you could place my Godson with those abusive muggles and denied my mate access to them for ten years. There was a time when I as well as everybody I knew thought you could do no wrong, but now I see clearly that you are what the old Roman and Druid Magi called a Mullas Lord. So from this day forth I rescind the offer of Grimmauld place as the Headquarters of the order of the Phoenix and any members are not welcome into my or any Black properties”</p>
<p align="justify">Dumbledore smiled and his eyes twinkled as he said “ Sirius you are forgetting who is the secret keeper for Grimmauld place, and I can override your orders. Believe me I only do things for your and Harrys good, now why don….”</p>
<p align="justify">Sirius laughed his trademark laugh and interrupted Dumbledore, ”Oh I forgot to mention Dumbles….You are no longer my secret keeper, Andromeda here is. I had her reinstated into the Black family including her Husband Ted. The Goblins and Andromeda have managed to update and cast new wards around the different Black Properties especially Grimmauld place. In fact this morning I HAVE TRIED EVICT YOUR HANGERS ON THE WEASLEY FAMILY except for the twins, who have decided to leave their family due to conflicting demands between them and my Godson Harry. Believe me DUMBLEDORK you and your order of the idiotic chickens are no longer welcomed in my house, the only reason that the Weasley’s family are still at Grimmauld place is that the Weasley family has more sticking power than the charm that stuck my mother’s portrait to the wall…..Thanks to your meddling over the years you have managed to ensure that the Weasley’s have more rights to stay in my home than I or my family does! But be assured I will evict those parasites, eating my food and running my elves to the ground….how dare you old man decide what of my ancestral home can be kept.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Sirius” Dumbledore started with those twinkling grandfather eyes looking at Sirius reproachful “ Molly is only trying to ensure that Grimwald place is renovated and that any dark artefacts are disposed off….after all to have such dark artefacts in the reach of children is so dangerous….my boy, it was all for your own good, you have been so ill and despondent, that Molly under my instruction and advice was only trying to assist you….”</p>
<p align="justify">Sirius just exploded “PLEASE TELL ME DUMBLDEORE, HOW GIVING ME POTIONS BEHIND MY BACK AND NOT FORGETTING THE CURSE THAT YOU MANAGE TO CAST ON ME DURING MY FIRST YEAR AT HOGWARTS THAT MADE ME SEE YOU AS MY FATHER AND THAT AFFECTED MY PERSONALITY DETRIMENTALLY WAS FOR THE GREATER GOOD AND WAS FOR MY BENIFIT……Well just to inform you Dumbledore, the Goblins have been instructed that all renovations and new furniture and interiors will be coming from your personal vaults.”</p>
<p align="justify">Dumbledore inwardly smirked to himself, no matter how much Sirius thought that the renovation of Grimwald Place would cost him, it wouldn't in fact cost him a Knut. He was never charge by the wizarding merchants for his purchases and services he used, it was after all one of the perks of being the most renown light lord After all. Everybody was so grateful to him for leading the British wizarding society all these years, and he was such a decent and nice old person who deserved the little luxuries in life, especially after sacrificing his life for everybody else.</p>
<p align="justify">"You're wrong old man - the Goblins will be the ones who ensure that you <em><strong>have to pay </strong></em>all from your own vaults.", smirked Severus. "You should really read the letters, when they will be send to you on time. Sirius, it's time."</p>
<p align="justify">And before Dumbledore could react, had he been hit with the Petrificus Totalus spell and Severus placed the collar on his neck.<br/> <br/> "Well, I have the great pleasure to inform you, that I'm the only one who can remove it from your neck. And before that can be happen, the Goblins will be ensure that nobody has tempered with my free will. You should leave, as long as your name isn't completly tarnished, yet. And when only one of your students get a papercut, then you will be evicted from your posts, Headmaster. This is your last warning."</p>
<p align="justify">With that Severus escorted out Dumbledore of the house, and quietly climbed the stairs to Hermione’s room.</p>
<p align="justify">The three teenagers were so engrossed in listening to the conversation taking place in the living room, that they were taken by surprised when Severus opened Hermione’s bedroom door, and he wasn’t pleased to find out that they had been eavesdropping on the adults conversation. The three teenagers quietly trooped downstairs to the living room where they found Sirius and a couple sitting in the living room. Introductions were made and Hermione and her friends were introduced to Sirius cousin Andromeda and her husband Ted Tonks.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Andromeda outlined the basic plan for them at present, both her and her father would be moving to Grimmauld place where Sirius, Remus and the Weasley’s twins now lived. Andromeda had been reinstated into the Black family and Andromeda was now Sirius secret keeper, it quickly became apparent to Hermione that the Tonks had very little good to say regarding Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore or his order of the phoenix. Andromeda snapped her fingers and said a name loudly, an old elf appeared called Kreacher and he quickly with another elf called Dobby packed up everybody belongings and took them to Grimwald place. Then the Tonks and Sirius apparated them to the Harry’s Godfathers home Grimmauld place.<br/> When everybody was sat in the front parlour of Grimmauld place it was explained to them why Sirius had invited them to move in with him and his mate, it was so that they will be better protected. The Death Eater had already gotten the necessary information about Harry's friends and their family to their Dark Master. It would endanger their lives, when they do not move to a more secured and better protected location.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> And Sirius has heard rumours that Voldemort had always lusted after dark haired and dark eyed males. Severus would be the epitome of that obsession and Voldemort wouldn't give up until he had the dark man into his clutches. Of course this information hasn't been shared with Severus, yet. Sirius and Remus wanted to learn more about him and not drive him away from the Magical world. And they would not only lose him, but Hermione, Dudley and Harry, too. Nobody of them would be willing to take that risk.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> They have only find a way to convince Severus that it will be the best solution for them. It wouldn't be easy as Severus was rather stubborn and not willing to bow down for anyone.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> Dumbledore hadn't liked it, but they had already prepared the required evidence, included the memory as Dumbledore himself cast the Fidelius over the House in Godric's Hollow. It was only a copy, but it would destroyed Dumbledore’s political career, when he only overstep one boundary regarding Harry and his friends.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/> At least with them at Grimmauld Place it would be interesting holidays. No one knew, what their first visit would trigger. Harry would get dreams about the past and Hermione will be getting a visit from Lady Magic who explained about the plea, that she and Harry have to do, when she wanted to help the victims of Dumbledore's cruelty.</p>
