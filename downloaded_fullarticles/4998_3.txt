    <p dir="ltr">“Are you ready now?”</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">21 months, to date, under his teacher’s tutelage, he knew to look for the nuances in the words and breaths taken that indicated his teacher’s worry and weary acceptance for his student’s decision.</p><p>23 months since the day Voldemort’s body was no more than a sack of heavy bones and flesh, no more the soul that was bound to his forever.</p><p>21 months since he had, quite literally, found his teacher and been accepted as a suitable student - not for the lack of trying so hard it could <em>almost</em> compare to the time he spent hunting down the horcruxes. He still remembered the days he was perpetuated with fear every moment in his teacher’s presence. He had had to survive being hunted by said teacher before an impasse made him a newly accepted student.</p><p dir="ltr">21 months since he had been enlightened that being a Master of Death was a duty that entailed more than he’d ever expected.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Never had anyone in history of Magic had any being successfully owned all three Hallows at any one time, so there were no precedents for Harry’s situation. However, many much like his teacher, understood the intricacies that came with the power of wielding all three Hallows, and it was not the tools that made the Master, but the tools that the Master used to master Death.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Death is the inevitability of time and space essentially, as all life ends in death and only with death can new life be born. The tools combined gave a Master the ability to manipulate said time and well, dimensions, not space per se, and hence able to evade Death.</p><p>The stone is a link to the other realms and time. The wand a conduit to access and direct the Master’s power. The cloak to mask one’s presence from travelling between time and space, within voids.</p><p>Individually, the items are each with sought-after abilities, but together, they become an invaluable doorway to incomprehensible possibilities. They are the tokens that channel their Master’s will.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">His teacher was wise, but one can only extrapolate and guess intelligently so far, and hence they’ve prepared as far as he could.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">He lifted his head from his closed-eyed contemplation and met the blood-red eyes of his teacher. There was a time that seemed a lifetime ago, the colour brought fear to his veins, so close they were to a pair that used to haunt his dreams when he was but a school boy. Now they were warm as those pumping through his heart with hidden affection he knew was there.</p><p>Who knew he’d end up growing to care for a cold-blooded vampire.</p><p>“As ready as we will ever be, Aur.”</p><p>He ducked the expected swipe to the head, as the bloodsucking tutor chastised him for his informality. He startled though, when a cool long-fingered hand swept through his hair in a .. gentle … caress. He looked back up into those crimson eyes, contrastingly serious and light-hearted.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">“Whatever may be, young one, remember that Death is no enemy, and you may always seek my counterpart out.” His thin lips curved up and a hint of fangs flashed in the moonlight. “I have faith in my omniscient power that transcends dimensions.”</p><p> He felt the familiar presence in his mind, treading the open path into his mind that he allowed for only a select few.</p><p> <em>Indulge an old man, little one, and try not to get yourself killed, alright?</em></p><p dir="ltr">His own lips twisted up in a smile at the vampire’s sentimentalities. For all his penchant for sweet terms of endearment, the centuries old man had an odd difficulty with being straightforward when it comes to emotional topics.</p><p>
  <em>I will miss you too, Aurelius.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hmm, I will pray well we meet again in countless other realms, dear one.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Cupping the hand that now rested on his neck in a familiar hold, thumb on his jugular, he gave the familiar ring resting on those knuckles one last kiss farewell, and stepped back into the circle, surrounded by the seven ceramic bowls containing different representations of Death.</p><p dir="ltr">He took a deep breath, and nodded to his teacher, who spoke the final parting words.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">“May Fate and Fortune favour you.”</p><p dir="ltr">“And may Death be forever on your side.” He responded.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Wand in hand, cloak draped over his shoulders in a modified cowl, and the stone resting on his breast, close to his heart. Harry took in a breath, gathered his magic and spread himself through his tokens.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Exhale.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">He channeled his intent, and pulled and pulled harder on his magic than ever before.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Inhale.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">His vision seemingly diminished, as black and white contrasting colours competed for space and time, wiping out any sight of his teacher or the room he’d come to know as “safe””, as unknown silhouettes danced in and out with reaching skeletal arms.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Goodbye.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Exhale.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">============</p><p dir="ltr">HIs first trip was to Gringotts.</p><p>Appearing on the corner of the street in an alleyway across the bank from another place in another time seemed to have worked more smoothly than he’d expected. Sure, it had taken far too long and far too much effort to replicate any time soon, but seeing he was not bleeding anywhere, Harry considered it a great start.</p><p>The building did not look any much different from his time, ignoring the blatant holes that it suffered in the war that is. Whether it looked any cleaner or less intimidating, he couldn’t tell.</p><p> </p><p>Fortius Quo Fidelius<em>, Strength Through Loyalty.</em></p><p>Looking up at the golden engraved words, he wondered how his first trial in this time and place would go.</p><p dir="ltr">Goblins were notoriously testy creatures whose respect are difficult to gain, but once they have accepted you, they were unlikely to ever disappoint.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Time to test if the bonding to a Vampire Lord would withstand the literal test of time and space.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The lobby was quiet and sparse, the chandeliers overhead giving the place a muted gold that complemented the architecture of the wizarding bank. Striding across the marbled floor, Harry approached the nearest counter, and there he paused, waiting without impatience.</p><p>The goblin behind the desk was frowning, unsurprisingly, at the parchments that lay before it, a moue of distaste upon its face. Harry watched as it dipped its quill every now and then to seemingly cancel or underline something. It seemed that he’d have to wait until the goblin was done with his particular document at the very least.</p><p>Harry tilted his head minutely, sensing an odd feeling as he continued to spot further familiarities in the goblin before him. If one added in a tad more warts, slightly more roughened skin…</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The goblin finally looked up. “Yes?”  </p><p> </p><p>Inclining his head in a respectful nod, Harry stepped up to the till.</p><p>“Good … day,” Harry paused as he suddenly realised he did not know the exact time. He blinked once, before continuing.</p><p dir="ltr">“I wish to open a permanent vault, and perhaps verify my bloodline, if possible. It would be greatly appreciated if such an arrangement could be done in the next immediate convenience.”</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The goblin seemed to crank up the intensity of his stare, if possible. Harry merely stared back impassively, not bothered at all. He’d lived with a vampire - he was well-trained.</p><p>“Vault making requires prior arrangement. Inheritance Verification can be carried out immediately. Follow me.”</p><p>The goblin glared at him as if blaming him for wasting his time in walking, and led him down the dimly lit corridors to stop before an office door, with metal embossed words on the frosted glass. <em>Bodlach</em>.</p><p>“Bodlach will aid you in setting up your own vault, but as a word of warning, treat him with respect or suffer your wealth.”</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Harry smiled wryly. “I will be sure take your words to heart. Thank you for sparing the time to guide me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harry paused and decided to go ahead anyways.</p><p dir="ltr">“May Fortune and Fate be in your favour ... Griphook.” He suppressed a grin at the look of shock on the goblin’s face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The goblin soon schooled his features back into that of disgruntlement, though noticeably less harsh and more suspicious.</p><p>“And may your wealth be ever bountiful, Mister…”</p><p>“Evans.” The goblin gave him one considering nod, and left him to each their own business.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">After a knock, a no-nonsense voice bid him to enter.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The goblin perched high behind the sturdy desk regarded him through practical glasses, equipped with several specialised enchantments, Harry noted.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">“Are you familiar with the process of opening a vault here at Gringotts?”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “I’ve read briefly of them, however i am not intimately familiar with them.”</p><p> The goblin seemed to withhold a sigh.</p><p>“You wish to set up a Family Vault?” A nod. “To open a Family Vault, the process is much more intricate, but no more tedious than any other at Gringotts. It only differs depending on the owner’s wishes for their Vault.” As the goblin spoke, a stone basin was summoned from the shelves beside and placed upon the desk, along with a long parchment spread out beside.</p><p> “To ensure that the Vault continues in your Family, it would require your blood to imbued, as well as your magic. Since you are also looking to trace your lineage, we might as well do that first, before opening any new Vaults. It would save the hassle of imbuing any additional bloodlines after.”</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Bodlach, the goblin, then stood, and withdrew an ancient knife from the desk drawers, indicating for Harry’s arm. Harry complied with no hesitation - contrary to what he’d earlier said, he was fully prepared for the entire process. Now to only see if their efforts had gone to waste.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">With a swift cut to his forearm, the goblin directed his flow into the basin, passing a hand over his wound to stop the blood flow when sufficient blood had been collected. With precision, Bodlach lifted one edge of the parchment, and allowed it to barely touch the surface of the blood. All this while, not one word was uttered by either parties, but Harry could feel the rise in magic as it took hold in the parchment and blood.</p><p>Slowly, the blood seemed to seep further into the parchment, rising up and forming neat words that were written in swift strokes of red. Apparently sensing an unseen signal, Bodlach abruptly lifted the list out of the bowl and lay it flat out between them. They both leaned over as a list of crimson slowly descended.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The scarlet words read:</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Descendent of the Peverell line</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Descendent of the Potter line</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Descendent of the Aurelius line</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">Ah, it was all to plan then. He was successfully a descendent of his tutor’s long extinct line, which was long dead - not counting the “dead” vampire in this world. Harry was also not surprised by the Peverell line, having discovered it when finally checking through his Vaults after the War. </p><p dir="ltr">Slightly amusing, considering how the descendent of one who greeted Death like an old friend also met the same fate, but ended up very differently.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Harry refocused on the parchment. The list seemed to be continuing, ink spreading, forming another line of words.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Heir to the Red Lord of Vampires.</em>
