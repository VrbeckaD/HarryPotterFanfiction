  <b>A couple of things to note about this fanfiction:</b>
</p><p>- <u>Disclaimer</u>: I do not own any of the LOTR characters, nor do I own the Harry Potter Universe. All rights are reserved to J. R. R. Tolkien and J. K. Rowling, and this fanfiction is simply for entertainment, not for profit.</p><p>- This fanfiction is mostly going to be in the point of view Legolas Greenleaf, who is a friend of Frodo Baggins, the 'Boy Who Lived.' Rather than tell the main story over, I'll be writing in Legolas' perspective to show what he and the rest of the Fellowship would do and are willing to do for Frodo.</p><p>- There is some Sindarin language within this chapter. If you are on a computer, you will be able to hover over the word to see what it means. If you are on mobile, I will provide the translations in the beginning notes.</p><p>- Although they are first years, I assumed there has to be a ‘proper age’ to which each race could enter Hogwarts so that it coincides with their ability to learn. I figured that they would all know quite much entering already, seeing as an Elf’s lifespan is incredibly long, as well as Dwarf and Hobbit following foot. ( Not nearly as long, but you get the gist. ) So mentally, they all are the ‘same age’. That’s why it may seem that they all are very knowledgeable. </p><p>- In this Alternate Universe, both Middle-Earth and what we call our Earth exists. There are many hidden passages into Middle-Earth for non-muggles, though the main one is Platform 9¾.</p><p>- Non-muggles within this universe are all inhabitants of our Earth, which is purely occupied of the race of Men. I figured that Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits and all other races are all very familiar with the subject of magic. This does not mean, however, that the race of Men cannot attend Hogwarts. ( Take Hermione Granger, for example. )</p><p>- This story will mainly be about the romantic interactions of <u><b>Gimli and Legolas</b></u> ( AKA, Gigolas - The best ship name ), through of course, slow burn. Although side ships will not be ignored, I’d like them to be the main focus.</p><p><b> TRANSLATIONS </b><br/>- Ada : father.<br/>- iôn : son.<br/>- Im iest na gar- i er : I wish to have that one.<br/>- Legrin : swift.<br/>- Nín iôn : my son.<br/>- Im ceri- : I do.</p><p><b> OTHER PLACES TO REACH ME: </b><br/>- aplacetoland on tumblr<br/>- shaelyndraws on instagram</p>

    <p>The Shire was most normally a peaceful place. Hobbits lived in serenity, delved within their gardening and growing knowledge, and pride of making rather fine meals. They were a quiet people, though on this night in Autumn, everything seemed all too short of undisturbed.</p><p>Drogo and Primula Baggins ( née Brandybuck ) were the proud parents of young Frodo Baggins, who was just a babe at the time. They were hidden, their location primarily unknown aside from few friends and family, and planned to keep it that way. Lord Sauron had attempted to recruit the two of them three times now, wishing to lure them in and to join Sauron’s Army. He understood that Drogo and Primula were skilled non-muggles, strongly willed and quick-witted. Yet, Sauron began to grow tired of their denial, and instead decided to take up the two of them himself.</p><p>Drogo and Primula Baggins were murdered on October 31st. Frodo Baggins was in his crib, wailing as it occurred, although as time passed he would realize he was much too young to recall his parent’s death. In protection of Frodo, Primula had attempted to fight back, but it proved fruitless, for she soon suffered the same fate as her husband.</p><p>Sauron’s attempt to murder Frodo was not as successful. Frodo had survived the attack, and not only so, cast the One Ring off of Sauron’s finger from the recoil. Lord Sauron fled, leaving Frodo alive and the Ring for taking.</p><p>The neighbor next door had come over after the fact to check what all of the obnoxious sounds had been at such a time at night, but was left horrified at the scene they stumbled upon. Instantly had they ushered Bilbo Baggins over, Frodo’s uncle, and told him the news.</p><p>Bilbo had made the abrupt and easy decision to take care of Frodo Baggins, and raise him as his own.</p><p>To this day, however, Bilbo had not told a soul of his finding of the One Ring, for even he was unsure of the power it possessed.</p>
<hr/><p>“Erh—Uncle Bilbo?” Frodo’s voice called from outside, though the Hobbit had stepped into Bag End, looking down at a letter in his hands. It was an envelope of parchment paper, with a wax seal at the back. “What’s this?”</p><p>Bilbo was busy inside the living room, though he glanced up when Frodo came in. It took him little to no time to realize what he had in his hands, and he smiled.</p><p>“I think this must be for you. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. You’re a professor there. I do think they wrote the wrong name.”</p><p>“No, my dear Frodo. That is yours.”</p><p>“Mine?”</p><p>“Yes. Your very own letter.” Bilbo exhaled, pushing the seat from the table next to him with his foot for Frodo to sit. “Come. Sit down. I have too much to share with you.”</p>
<hr/><p>The Sorting Hat. It was of the most frightening of experiences for a first year student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. <i>What if I’m a Slytherin?</i> And perhaps a short <i>gasp</i> before the, <i>or a Hufflepuff?</i> However, as many parents had always reassured their beginning witches and wizards, Hufflepuffs were very courageous – Take Newt Scamander, for example, the quiet man with a love for misunderstood beasts. Even Slytherin was nothing short of fine, as any house was, and should be.</p><p>Thranduil Greenleaf, however, had other viewpoints of the houses. As Professor of Charms, with flowing waves of silver strands and a cold, sturdy set of pupils, he taught his core curriculum with a strict, far-reaching inclination. It was only expected that he acts in such a way, due to the fact that Charms was indeed significant, and would appear on their O.W.L. exams in further years. He had not let that fact be dismissed, most especially to his entering first years, for although it may seem he could be ill-intentioned at times, he only wished for his students to do well. And of course, among those students, was his very own kin, Legolas Greenleaf.</p><p>Legolas was far gentler around others in comparison to his father. He would listen deeply to those who spoke to him, nod along to what they were saying, or perhaps even reply with piece of advice. His hair was similar to his father’s, without flaw and with a center braid at the back, tucked behind a set of pointed ears to make it evident to others his race. Not many, however, would be able to mistake an Elf, especially due to his creamy complexion and undying spread of knowledge from his lips. Many Elves were placed into the house of Slytherin, not for their poor personality, for no Elf owned such, but instead for their cunning personality, and sharpness at subject. Thranduil Greenleaf had been placed into Slytherin, and his father Oropher Greenleaf before that. He was expecting his son to be placed into the might of the Slytherin house, by Merlin’s beard, he convinced himself he <i>knew</i> Legolas would be elected into it. Thranduil was notorious amongst non-muggles with the fact that he thought himself as high and mighty – Disliking dwarves and the poisoning minds of men ( at least to him ), Thranduil had always told of Legolas to <i>watch</i>, for any man or dwarf would be quick to betray someone even as close as a brother just for a simple coin.</p><p>Legolas believed little of his father’s words, nodding along and pressing a smile of understanding, but it was what Legolas was most delighted to do – To meet <i>other</i> races, seeing as he had spent most to all of his life around the Elves. To see the Dwarves, Men, to spot a Hobbit in plain sight and see that they truly are as short as suggested. Legolas was young, for an Elf, and although he had been learning for quite some time, it was finally his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Not only so, but he had heard that a certain Frodo Baggins was to appear as a classmate of his year, the very Hobbit who had survived Lord Sauron’s attack after murdering Frodo’s parents just before. Legolas would be a liar and a fool to say he <i>wasn’t</i> interested in meeting the Boy Who Lived, for he had so many questions, and so many left unanswered – Especially due to the fear of asking his father.</p><p>But first, supplies. It was what any Hogwarts student would need, and although Thranduil wished for he to go out and buy everything for Legolas himself, his son <i>insisted</i> that they spend the day in Diagon Alley so that they could build off each other’s opinions, especially in choosing a pet. A wand was a given, seeing as the wand <i>chose</i> its master, and Legolas was only that much more excited to step into Ollivanders Wand Shop.</p><p>He had decided to enter Eeylops Owl Emporium first, his father following shortly behind, a hand brushing his son’s shoulder as they walked in. The birds were hooting contently, attempting to catch the eye of any nearby witch or wizard, or perhaps their new owner. Legolas’ bright eyes of blue scanned the store, where the occasional feather fluttered to the ground, or an owl would squawk dramatically when a student reached out to pet the bird through the bars of the cages. Before Legolas could even <i>begin</i> to choose his owl, however, he caught sight of another Elf, standing by the cage of a dark-feathered owl, finger upon his chin with his head at a slight tilt. He had long blonde hair as well, a bit more beige compared to Legolas’. And next to him… A <i>Dwarf</i>! An actual Dwarf! He was short, with a mane of red curls and an ever-growing start of a beard, admiring the same owl that the Elf was. So, Dwarves <i>do</i> start growing facial hair rather early, don’t they? Another interesting fact, and something Legolas intended to keep in mind. Legolas’ veins flooded with elation, and he breathed in a bit.</p><p>“Well, go on.” Thranduil grinned, bending down for his voice to meet Legolas’ ear in a soft whisper, tone light and friendly. “Go say hi.”</p><p>Legolas smiled. His feet started to bring him towards the Dwarf, though they hesitated in their tracks when Thranduil spoke up once more.</p><p>“After all, having Elven friends is a wise choice. I’m proud of you, my son.”</p><p>Legolas blinked, and swallowed the hesitation. <i>Okay</i>, he thought, <i>No Dwarf, then.</i> Maybe he could catch a swift word when his father was to glance away, or pull the Dwarf towards the back to catch at least some form of conversation. No… No, then that would be odd, wouldn’t it? Yes, it would…</p><p>He hadn’t realized he had finally approached, his eyes upon the Elf, and when he turned, he eyed Legolas for a moment, before smiling.</p><p>“Hello.” Legolas greeted, not entirely shy, for he was a very open Elf.</p><p>“Hi.” The Elf greeted back, bowing in return to the greet. “My name is Haldir. What’s yours?”</p><p>“Legolas.” He said, bowing as well, though he fumbled with the material of his outer clothing, a soft brown in comparison to the Elvish silk he wore underneath, which poked out as shimmering flaps at his collar, moreover serving <i>as</i> the collar. “Legolas Greenleaf.”</p><p>Haldir seemed impressed, and he glanced over to Thranduil, who was occasionally casting a glance over towards his son in mere interest to see if he was, in a way, fitting in. “You’re Thranduil’s son.” He said, eyes moving back to Legolas.</p><p>“I am.” Legolas said. He could have sworn the Dwarf peeked from Haldir’s side, as if he was unintentionally eavesdropping. Legolas didn’t mind. He wanted to know the Dwarf as well, however, in fear of his father…</p><p>“My father has told me <i>much</i> about you. You are a very noble family. I’m eager to take his Charms class.”</p><p>“Erh—Yes, he’s—”</p><p>“Excuse me,” Haldir said suddenly, cutting Legolas off, but it had taken him a moment to realize Haldir had turned to the Dwarf, a sudden vibration of annoyance within his tone. He was speaking to the ginger, an eyebrow raised, lips sneered. “You aren’t thinking of <i>buying</i> this owl, are you? Because obviously, I was going to.”</p><p>The Dwarf tilted his chin up to the Elf, blinking. Now that Haldir was out of the way, he had only now realized how tall the Elves were compared to them. Legolas wondered if Hobbits were shorter, as he had been told. “Well, I mean, I had been looking—”</p><p>“But I said <i>I</i> was going to buy it. After all, you may not even be able to afford it, will you?”</p><p>“Dwarves do own much wealth.” Legolas said as neutrally as he was able to, tilting his head slightly.</p><p>Haldir chose to ignore Legolas’ words. “You’re all beard and no brains. Step away from my owl.”</p><p>The Dwarf rose a tousled brow. “I wasn’t <i>planning</i> on buying the bird, anyway. I have a pet of my own.”</p><p>Legolas hid a smile. He admired the Dwarf’s fierceness.</p><p>“A pet? I’m surprised you aren’t one yourself.” Haldir chuckled bitterly. “What is it, anyway? A rat?”</p><p>The Dwarf shrunk a bit. Legolas could tell the Dwarf felt ashamed because Haldir was right.</p><p>Haldir laughed triumphantly. “Oh, it is! How sweet. Does he sleep between your feet when you sleep?”</p><p>“Haldir!” A voice came from the other side of the store. It was Haldir’s father unmistakably, and he offered Legolas a small smile before turning with a look of disgust from the Dwarf. The Dwarf had coins within his palm, and before Haldir turned, he smacked them from his hands, and towards his father. The coins clattered down onto the wooden floor below, some spinning, and others rolling towards Legolas’ feet.</p><p>The Dwarf sighed, mumbling something under his breath, and he bent down to pick them up.</p><p>Legolas assisted without hesitation, bending down to grasp a couple of the coins. “If it means anything,” He started, “I think a rat is a very noble pet.”</p><p>The Dwarf searched for some hint of sarcasm within his voice or expression but found none. He stood up a bit, and although he was standing up straight, Legolas was at eyelevel with him when knelt down. He glanced away, reluctant to answer. “It’s a rat.” He murmured. “Is it anything short of pathetic?”</p><p>Legolas smiled a little bit. “I don’t think it’s pathetic.” He said truthfully. He took a gander over at his father, who was in deep conversation with the shop owner. His pupils shifted back upon the Dwarf. “I’m Legolas.”</p><p>“Erh—Gimli.” The ginger greeted. Legolas extended his hand, handing to Gimli the coins he dropped. “Son of Glóin.”</p><p>“Of Glóin?” Legolas beamed. “Your father – He is good friends with Thorin Oakenshield, no? Hogwarts’ Potion’s professor?”</p><p>Gimli nodded. “Yes.”</p><p>“He’s a very respectable Dwarf, or… so I’ve read.”</p><p>“You must read a lot, then.” Gimli pointed out. “Listen… Legolas, you—You needn’t be kind to me. If there’s one thing I dislike more than a discourteous nature, it’s pity.”</p><p>“Pity is a gift of the wise and noble. There is nothing wrong with it.” Legolas said. “But I show no pity for you, Gimli, Son of Glóin. I offer you friendsh—”</p><p>“<i>Legolas!</i>” Thranduil hissed, for his conversation with the storekeeper had come to a halt when he spotted Legolas speaking to the Dwarf. “Come here.”</p><p>Legolas turned to Gimli with an apologetic look. “It was nice to meet you, Gimli. Perhaps I will spot you within the castle.” And he stood, moving back to his father, who was glaring disapprovingly towards Gimli.</p><p>“What did he want?” Thranduil said, a hint of distaste in his voice.</p><p>“Nothing, <i><acronym title="Father">Ada</acronym></i>, he just dropped his coins. I was helping him.” Legolas said truthfully.</p><p>Thranduil’s eyes met Legolas’. “He doesn’t need your assistance. He’s close enough to the ground to grab it himself.”</p><p>Legolas glanced away. “I was simply trying to make friends.”</p><p>Thranduil exhaled. He feared this would occur, since it wasn’t <i>always</i> likely that other races befriended one another. But it wasn’t entirely unexpected. “Have you chosen an owl,<i><acronym title="son"> iôn</acronym></i>?”</p><p>Legolas had barely had time to even glance upon any of the owls, aside from the one Haldir had claimed so viciously. He picked up his chin, eyes trailing the store, before he caught sight of a somewhat smaller bird, seemingly a horned owl with large orbs of yellow-ochre and a brown-speckled coat. “<i><acronym title="I wish to have that one.">Im iest na gar- i er.</acronym></i>” Legolas said in Elvish tongue, gesturing towards the owl.</p><p>Thranduil nodded. “Wonderful. May we have that one, please?” He turned towards the shopkeeper, who nodded as he went to retrieve the owl from the shelf. “What shall you name him?”</p><p>Legolas thought for a moment, glancing up at his father. “How about Arod?” He smiled.</p><p>“<i><acronym title="Swift.">Legrin.</acronym></i>” Thranduil repeated with a soft smile. <i>Swift</i>, in common tongue. “Let’s hope he holds up to the name.”</p>
<hr/><p>After retrieving his books, his wand ( which happened to be ten-and-three-quarter inch vine wood, dragon heart-string ), and the remainder of his supplies, Thranduil arrived with his son at the train station. Legolas had always dreamed of entering Platform 9¾ at King’s Cross Station, with cart in hand and freedom to enter the wall without hesitation.</p><p>And so, he did. In an instant, he entered the bricks, quite literally – But instead of hitting face-first into the exterior, he went right through, and was welcomed by the bustling of witches, wizards and worried parents ushering their children onto the train upon Platform 9¾. Thranduil was right behind him, and he turned his son towards him with a smile. Kneeling down, he found Legolas’ eyes. “<i><acronym title="My son.">Nín iôn,</acronym></i> be safe. I have a couple of things to take care of before I arrive at the castle. Go. Make some good friends.” He said and leaned forward to place a gentle kiss to Legolas’ forehead.</p><p>Legolas nodded, bowing slightly, and he smiled, before turning and grasping all of his things, stepping onto the train. He squeezed past a couple of Elves, mumbling a soft excuse me, and soon enough the train took off. He had just enough time to glance from an open window and wave goodbye before it left the station, and he returned to searching for an empty cart, or perhaps, even one with a possible friendship inside.</p><p>He started down the small hallway where door after door lay carts, though most were full, some of first years, others of second and third, and so on. Legolas had finally reached a cart with just one boy inside, with shoulder-length hair and a snowy owl resting humbly in its cage next to him. <i>Might as well try,</i> he thought to himself, slowly opening the door, and offering the boy with a smile. “Hello. All of the other carts are rather full… It is all right if I join you?”</p><p>The boy looked up, revealing a slight glow to his cerulean irises. He nodded. “All right.”</p><p>Legolas thanked him quietly, stepping inside and setting his things atop, before situating himself within the cushioned seat across from the boy. “I’m Legolas.” He greeted after a moment of silence.</p><p>The boy nodded, smiling a little bit. “I’m Aragorn.”</p><p>Legolas blinked, returning the smile. “Elessar? Aragorn Elessar?”</p><p>Aragorn nodded. “Son of Arathorn.”</p><p>Legolas bowed his head. “I’ve heard much about you. You are noble, Aragorn, for even my father is fond of you.”</p><p>“Your father?”</p><p>Legolas nodded. “Yes. Thranduil Greenleaf.”</p><p>Aragorn rose an impressive brow. “He is the Charms professor, is he not? Amongst the most respectable of the Elves?”</p><p>Legolas smiled. “Well—Yes, as many say.”</p><p>Aragorn paused. “Why are you speaking to me, anyway? I’ve been told it’s more common for Elves to speak to their own kind.”</p><p>Legolas smiled. “That’s not entirely true. At least not for me.” He said softly. “It’s very nice to meet you, Aragorn.”</p><p>Aragorn nodded. He opened his mouth to speak, but there was a sound of someone dropping something outside, with the clatter of books and seemingly other items, before the head of a Dwarf popped up by the window of the door to the cart. His hair was disheveled, ginger, and—Gimli. That was Gimli.</p><p>Legolas couldn’t help but laugh, and he stood, opening up the door. “Need a hand?” He offered, bending down to grab some of Gimli’s books.</p><p>Gimli huffed, though he laughed slightly as well. “I need about four.”</p><p>“It seems as if I’m always picking up after you.” Legolas teased lightly, helping Gimli bring his things into the cart and placing them on the above shelves. Gimli took a seat next to Legolas. “Gimli, this is Aragorn. Aragorn, Gimli.”</p><p>“Aragorn? Son of Arathorn?”</p><p>Aragorn chuckled, extending his hand. “Hello, Gimli.”</p><p>Gimli shook it with a firm grip, though any Dwarf’s normal grasp could be powerful. “It’s good to meet you. I never expected to be meetin’ too many at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“I’m sure this is as interesting as it’ll get.” Aragorn said, half-teasing.</p><p>After another moment, there was another sound outside—Much louder than Gimli’s, books, the tips of quill pens, papers, and… Bodies, all falling, most likely tripping.</p><p>“Ah! Pippin, you’ve got my sleeve!”</p><p>“Well, that’s not <i>my</i> fault is it? For Merlin’s sake!”</p><p>“Would you two quit whining? We’ve yet to find a cart that isn’t full!”</p><p>One of the voices must have reached up to grasp the doorknob, for it slipped soon after, and the door to their card slid open, revealing not one, nor two, but four Hobbits – They must have fallen, for they were all atop each other, trying to wriggle out of their tangle of body parts, books and bags. Four sets of eyes immediately looked up into the cart, where Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli looked right back at them, confused for a moment.</p><p>“Hello!” One of them said, grinning a little bit. He had light brown hair, blonder than brunette. Dirty blonde, to say the least. “Sorry to, erh—Disturb you. We’re just… We—”</p><p>“Shut it, Pippin.” The other one grumbled, with the same color hair as to who they would assume to be Pippin.</p><p>“Oh—Sam, you’re on my leg…”</p><p>“Sorry, Mister Frodo…” The other Hobbit said, who had a hint of ginger in his hair and was a bit heavier than the other three.</p><p>Legolas thought for a moment. “Frodo? Frodo Baggins?”</p><p>Aragorn and Gimli’s eyes were tied now simply to Frodo, as were Legolas’. Frodo had a head of dark curls, with a set of azure irises to match. The Hobbit glanced between the three of them, and once Sam had finally gotten back onto his feet, Frodo stood, brushing himself off. “Yes. That’s me.” He said. “Is it all right if we…?”</p><p>“Come in.” Aragorn said warmly, standing up. “Let us help you get your things in.”</p><p>Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn assisted in placing their things atop the shelves or under the seats, and once they were all squeezed in, they looked at each other, expecting one of them to speak up.</p><p>“My name is Legolas.” The Elf finally said after a moment, offering a smile to them all. “Legolas Greenleaf.”</p><p>“Aragorn.” The boy greeted.</p><p>“And me name’s Gimli, son of Glóin.” The Dwarf bowed his head.</p><p>“Frodo.” He said timidly, a brief smile on his lips. “As you know.”</p><p>“I’m Samwise Gamgee.” The ginger Hobbit spoke up, his smile friendlier, and a bit more long-lasting.</p><p>“I’m Meriadoc Brandybuck, but I’m mostly called by the name of Merry.” One of the other’s spoke up, a crooked smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>“And I’m Peregrin Took! But please, call me Pippin.” The dirty-blonde Hobbit said, his smile energetic.</p><p>They looked around at each other again. Somehow, all of their eyes ended back on to Frodo. “D’ya really have the scar?” Gimli said after a moment, curiosity getting the best of him.</p><p>“Erh—Yes, I do.” Frodo said, reaching up to brush his curly bangs from his forehead and show to them the jagged scar, even if Sam, Merry and Pippin have seen it loads of times before. He slowly removed his hand. “To be truthful, I… never quite knew what it meant until recently.”</p><p>“But your uncle… He’s Bilbo Baggins, is he not? The Professor of History of Magic?” Legolas questioned.</p><p>“Well… Yes. But he was trying to protect me from it all. He kept everything very vague, that is, until I opened my very own Hogwarts’ letter in the mail. We sat down and had a very long talk after that.” Frodo exhaled.</p><p>Aragorn tilted his head. “It must be very hard for you, Frodo.”</p><p>“Overwhelming, yes.” Frodo leaned back into his seat, where he was squeezed next to Gimli and Sam. “Yet I’ve found this is the most entertainment I’ve experienced since Bilbo’s birthday party last year.” He said, and then smiled. It was obvious that positivity was laced within Frodo’s personality.</p><p>“Oh, that is a most common discussion among dinner.” Legolas laughed. “Is it true that one hundred and twenty people attended last year?”</p><p>“One hundred and forty.” Frodo corrected. “I do believe that this year, it’ll be hosted at Hogwarts.”</p><p>Gimli looked a tad excited. Merry and Pippin must have just received the news, for they were just as elated. “Hogwarts? At <i>Hogwarts?</i>” Merry questioned, Pippin staring with wide eyes over at Frodo.</p><p>Frodo laughed a little bit. “Yes. At Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Well, it is this month, is it not? I think it’s a good start to the school year.” Samwise pointed out.</p><p>Their conversation was halted when the sound of a slight squeak-and-roll was evident within the hallway, and an old, white-haired and stubby Dwarf opened up their door. “Anything from the trolley, dears?”</p><p>They all looked at each other again, and without hesitation bought about as much as they were able to from the candy-filled trays of Chocolate Frogs and Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans. They laughed and told stories, Frodo sharing with the rest of them stories of Bilbo’s life and adventures, and how Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins did indeed  have <i>something</i> going on there… It caused slight laughter from Merry and Pippin, and a miniature smile upon Gimli’s features.</p><p>And then, after so many hours, some of them had fallen asleep. Frodo had tucked his face into Sam’s shoulder, snoozing lightly, while Merry and Pippin continued to stuff themselves with chocolate. Aragorn had his head rested against the cool glass surface of the window, eyes closed, yet it was evident in some way that he was not within slumber. Legolas was thinking to himself as the sky was drained of blue and was replaced with darkened colors and stars, indicating that they would be arriving soon. </p><p>“What house d’ya think you’ll get into?”</p><p>The voice was slightly unexpected, for Legolas had expected Gimli to be at rest, but when he turned to look down at the Dwarf next to him, he was still certainly wide awake.</p><p>“Me?” Legolas smiled, looking down to his hands in his lap. “Well… <i><acronym title="Father.">Ada</acronym></i> expects me to be placed in Slytherin.”</p><p>“Ada?” Gimli questioned, tilting his head.</p><p>“It means father.” Aragorn spoke up, peeking an eye towards the two.</p><p>Legolas’ head cocked in interest. “You speak Sindarin?”</p><p>“<i><acronym title="I do.">Im ceri-.</acronym></i>” He smiled a bit, before shutting his eyes again. “I’m rather friendly with the Elf Arwen, son of Elrond. He’s Professor of Ancient Runes at Hogwarts. She taught me quite a bit of the Sindarin language.”</p><p>“Merlin knows how any of the professors tolerate each other.” Gimli pointed out, turning back to Legolas. “Anywho, what house?”</p><p>“Well, my f—”</p><p>“I care little about what your father thinks. What about you?” Gimli asked.</p><p>Legolas’ gaze returned out the window. “I’m not sure. I’m not exactly hoping for anything. I know the Sorting Hat will take care of where I need to be.”</p><p>“Well, it sure won’t be Slytherin.” Gimli said. “You don’t have a mean bone in your body, from what I’ve seen.”</p><p>Legolas smiled, though it was hidden from Gimli, due to the fact his head was turned. “Thank you.”</p><p>And then it was quiet again, and Aragorn might just have fallen asleep this time.</p>
<hr/><p>The train came to a screeching, hooting halt, which had awoken Frodo and Sam from their brief nap, and Aragorn from his rest. Legolas had still been awake, much too enthusiastic, and rather hungry. Thranduil had always told Legolas of the wonderful first dinner at the Great Hall, and how excited he would be to see his son walk up those steps and personally be placed into the house that the Sorting Hat wills so. He had gathered his things, the four Hobbits, Aragorn and Gimli doing the same, but they were only grateful when they found that their bags would be taken care of and brought to their dorms after they were placed into their houses.</p><p>Legolas walked with Gimli and Aragorn, the Hobbits scurrying close next to him. The Elf had caught a glimpse of their feet – No shoes and very hairy, calloused – And he was satisfied with the fact that what he had read had not lied to him. He shouldn’t be shocked, but he enjoyed the element of surprise. Sometimes.</p><p>They had filed into the large, dark wagons with four metal wheels, though they seemingly pulled themselves. As they followed the trail along the river, they had finally caught sight of the castle – Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Legolas was sure he would never forget this moment.</p><p>Upon reaching the steps of the castle, they were let out and guided in through the front door, down a wide, warm and comforting hallway, before finally entering the Great Hall. It surely lived up to its name. Four enormously long wooden tables were stretched out in the main area, where towards the very back of the room another long table was visible, horizontal from the students’ tables, full of each and every professor. Legolas spotted his father, but his expression was unreadable from such a distance.</p><p>Most of the students were situated in their chairs already – Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff students that were in second year or higher were instead watching the first years eagerly, who, now Legolas realizes, had been guided in by a tall, blonde woman, or rather an Elf, with a pale complexion and waves of golden hair. Her expression was neutral, though underlying features held sternness within.</p><p>And then, another man stood up. He was old, yes, very old – But still in good health. His beard was long, reaching below his chest, and he wore a pointed hat of grey, similar in color to his streaky-white curls. He had robes of tattered grey as well, and of course, who could possibly mistaken this as none other than Gandalf the Grey? Gandalf, the very headmaster at Hogwarts, with a staff in his right hand and a welcoming essence within his eyes.</p><p>“Welcome back, my students, and welcome my first years, to another year at Hogwarts.” He said, pausing briefly to allow cheers. “Now, I’m aware you’re all very tired and hungry, but do remember, this is most important for any first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry—Dinner will be served promptly after the Sorting Hat has finished placing the students. Be patient. It is well worth it, for it was you, a year or many years ago that would be sitting in this exact same spot. Professor Galadriel Epessë will be calling out the names, so my first years, do pay attention.”</p><p>It was silent for a moment. Thranduil’s eyes were eager, anticipating Legolas’ sorting, though it would take time with the amount of first years that had been welcomed into Hogwarts. Bilbo Baggins was situated next to the main, empty seat at the table, presumably belonging to Gandalf. He was beaming over at Frodo, who offered his uncle a small smile back. </p><p>And the names started.</p><p>“Éowyn, daughter of Éomund.”</p><p>It was noiseless. Everyone stared around the first year crowd, where in the center a small girl was trying to get through, with hair of light blonde, though an expression of confidence. Not a pompous nature, but self-assurance.</p><p>She sat down, and the hat was placed upon his head. The expression upon the old material twisted and turned, seemingly speaking to himself to decide. And then, in a loud, roaring voice:</p><p>“Hufflepuff!”</p><p>The table of yellow erupted in over-enthusiastic cheers and audience, to where Éowyn was smiling happily. The hat was removed, and she stood, laughing gently to herself at the cheers as she started towards the Hufflepuff table.</p><p>Galadriel continued to move down the list.</p><p>“Boromir, son of Denethor II.”</p><p>Silence again, and then – “Gryffindor!”</p><p>And more cheers, just as loud as Hufflepuff.</p><p>“Faramir, son of Denethor II.” – “Hufflepuff!”</p><p>“Arwen, daughter of Elrond Peredhel.” – “Ravenclaw!”</p><p>“Frodo, son of Drogo Baggins.”</p><p>As Frodo’s name was called, there couldn’t have been a room so full of people that was so very speechless. Frodo started up the stairs, a bit self-conscious at all of the pairs of eyes upon him, though he figured he should get used to it. He sat down within the stool, and as he felt the hat upon his head, his face flushed. It was deathly quiet, and he squeezed his eyes shut, and then –</p><p>“<i>Gryffindor!</i>”</p><p>And just like that, the silence broke, and the Gryffindor table had howled and bellowed delightfully, banging the table and stomping their feet, clapping their hands ardently.</p><p>Frodo couldn’t help the grin on his face, and Bilbo looked proud from his seat, clapping as well.</p><p>The list continued, and it got much better from there.</p><p>“Samwise, son of Hamfast Gamgee.”</p><p>Samwise’s father was indeed the Herbology professor at Hogwarts. Their family was proud of their plants, and most certainly their gardening.</p><p>“Gryffindor!”</p><p>“Tauriel, daughter of Mirkwood.” – “Ravenclaw!”</p><p>“Gimli, son of Glóin.”</p><p>Legolas patted his back from where he was, smiling as people stepped out of their way to let him through.</p><p>“Gryffindor!”</p><p>Clapping and cheers ensued, more table-slapping and feet-thumping.</p><p>“Haldir, son of Halmir.” – “Slytherin!”</p><p>Although many Elves had already been called up, <i>all</i> of them had been placed into Slytherin so far. All of them. It wasn’t an exaggeration, at all. And Legolas was starting to wonder if that was his fate, too.</p><p>“Meriadoc, son of Saradoc Brandybuck.” – “Gryffindor!”</p><p>More names were called and continued. Many Ravenclaw, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and…</p><p>“Aragorn, son of Arathorn.” – “Gryffindor!”</p><p>Cheers, and laughter and smiles. That’s what mainly filled the Great Hall, and Legolas was starting to dread his name being called.</p><p>“Éomer, son of Éomund.” – “Ravenclaw!”</p><p>“Peregrin, son of Paladin Took II.” – “Gryffindor!”</p><p>The first years were thinning out to their tables, and it was only Legolas, and a couple of other students left – He glanced around nervously. All of the friends he had made were placed into Gryffindor, and nearly every Elf was placed into Slytherin, aside from Arwen, who was most happily cheered on by her now-fellow Ravenclaw students.</p><p>“Legolas, son of Thranduil Greenleaf.”</p><p>Legolas inhaled, and similarly to Frodo, every single set of pupils within the room were glued to him. As he walked up the steps and towards the stool, he felt as if his feet were much too heavy compared to their lightweight nature, that they echoed within the Great Halls as if he were the only one in the room. He took a seat upon the stool, met with thousands of eyes staring at him, and his group of newfound friends all situated at the Gryffindor table together.</p><p>Legolas swallowed. He realized he didn’t fit into Slytherin. He would never make friends with anyone in that house. He closed his eyes shut. <i>Not Slytherin… Not Slytherin…</i></p><p>“<i>Gryffindor!</i>”</p><p>And the hall was silent. A majority of people within that room were expecting Legolas to be placed into Slytherin – It was extremely unlikely for any Elf to even be considered as a Gryffindor… But here he was, and after another moment, the room was filled with deafening cries of joy.</p><p>As Legolas walked towards the Gryffindor table, he had a wide smile upon his lips. He took a seat next to Gimli, resting his elbows upon the surface of the table as he received pats-on-the-back and words of encouragement, but as he looked over at his father… It was certain that Thranduil was <i>not</i> happy. Legolas’ smile fell slightly, and he glanced away, but his mind was temporarily cleansed by the sudden display of food in front of him and on his plate. The sight of Gimli <i>at</i> the sight of food lifted Legolas’ spirits quite easily.</p>
<hr/><p>“I think it’s just pure luck that we’ve all been put into Gryffindor.” Merry babbled as they entered their Gryffindor common room. It was late, and all of them were ready for some much-needed rest.</p><p>They started up the stairs, all seven of them, feeling somewhat triumphant after just being sorted. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli had found they were all in the same dorm, and in a separate one, the four Hobbits together as well. The first dorm in the hallway was the Hobbits’, and so they said their goodbyes and goodnights. Once the door was shut, the three of them started down the hall, and after finding their own room, stepped inside.</p><p>It was a circular room, with four or five beds against the wall so that they were all facing the center rug. Red and golden drapes served as curtains and privacy amongst the beds, and there was a window between each bed, moonlight shining through the class. One student had already come in, for the three of them easily assumed they’d be sharing with one other person.</p><p>The boy looked up from where he had chosen his bed. Brown hair and eyes, with a curious expression.</p><p>“Hello.” He greeted.</p><p>Aragorn bowed his head, and Gimli nodded. Legolas, however, spoke in return.</p><p>“Hello. You’re Boromir, right?” The Elf asked.</p><p>He smiled and nodded. “I am. If I’m not mistaken, you’re Legolas.”</p><p>Legolas beamed, and nodded. “And these are my friends, Aragorn and Gimli.”</p><p><i>Friends.</i> The word brought a blossoming flower of tenderness within his chest. He had friends. Perhaps Boromir would be their friend, too.</p>
