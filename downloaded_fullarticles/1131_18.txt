    <p>Hermione bit into her sandwich and taped on an icon showing a battered cauldron on her phone in boredom.</p>
<p>The Leaky Cauldron was a popular app among students where they could exchange ideas anonymously.</p>
<p>Most of the time jokes, lecture notes and pictures of cats and food were shared, but there were questions concerning dating, health and sex, too.</p>
<p>It was the best way to stay updated on campus even though Hermione wouldn’t be caught dead admitting that.</p>
<p>All in all, the app provided a decent distraction for Hermione when she was waiting for class as she hadn’t made that many friends since the beginning of law school, mostly because she considered most of the other students arrogant, rich prats.</p>
<p>Ron and Harry, with whom she had spend most of her time during her previous school career, were both training to become policemen and therefore weren’t attending university with her. She still thought it was a waste of their talents, but if it made them happy she wouldn’t protest.</p>
<p>Hermione scrolled through the app, her lips curling upwards occasionally when she read something funny.</p>
<p>She was usually just interested in jokes and news, but something entirely different caught her attention that day.</p>
<p>At first, she had scrolled past it, but after a few seconds of hesitation, Hermione scrolled back up to the post reading: “I’ve recently discovered I’m into BDSM. Is anybody else into it and wants to talk about it?”, the sandwich in her other hand momentarily forgotten.</p>
<p>Hermione wasn’t exactly a prude, or at least she believed she wasn’t, but she wasn’t into that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>No, she just wanted to read the replies because of scientific interest. She had always asked herself how and why people enjoyed pain and domination and now had the chance to find out, she reasoned with herself. Her curiosity was completely professional – she might come into contact with this in her career as a lawyer, at least that’s what she told herself.</p>
<p>Hermione looked around cautiously to make sure there wasn’t even the slightest chance that anybody could look over her shoulder and catch her reading the post and finally tapped on it.</p>
<p>Several replies were from people who said they were into it too and one suggested to make a group using another anonymous app, a messenger called Owlpost, to talk some more about their interests as the character limit in The Leaky Cauldron made a real discussion almost impossible.</p>
<p>Hermione bit her lip when she realized that she wouldn’t learn anything if she didn’t join the group.</p>
<p>On a whim, she opened the app-store on her phone and downloaded Owlpost, repeating to herself that she did it because of science while she waited for the installation to finish.</p>
<p>Luckily, the internet on campus was rather fast, giving her almost no time to change her mind.</p>
<p>Hermione stared at the starting screen demanding to either log in or create an account for several minutes, contemplating how she should call herself so nobody would recognize her.</p>
<p>Anything even remotely related to books and cats – two things she was known for – was therefore completely out of question.</p>
<p>At the end she settled on Persephone, remembering the myth she had read just the previous day, and took a deep breath before finally successfully signing in.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long and Hermione found and joined the BDSM group from the LC-post, rising her eyebrows when she saw that the group had already about 30 members.</p>
<p>Hermione was studying the various profiles when she noticed that somebody had directly addressed her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>THE</b><b>Prince</b><b>C</b><b>harming:</b> <b>@Persephone</b><em> Welcome. Mind to introduce yourself?</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione frowned at her phone, not sure what to reply. Nobody had mentioned anything about the members having to introduce themselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone:</b>
  <em> I thought this was an anonymous group?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Casssanova: </b>
  <em>Relax, Princess</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Casssanova: </b>
  <em>What he meant is just stuff like gender, age &amp; preferences – both in partner &amp; kinks. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Casssanova:</b>
  <em> We just want to get a general idea. Nobody is going to ask stuff by which they could identify you. Unless you want to hook up with somebody. Than feel free </em>
  <em>to</em>
  <em> – but do it in a private chat. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Casssanova:</b>
  <em> We’ll send you a screenshot with our data so you can get the general idea about us too, but we don’t want creeps so please go ahead</em>
</p>
<p><b>Red:</b> <b>@Persephone</b><em> Don’t </em><em>let </em><em>Cass intimidate you. He talks a lot &amp; is the founder of this group</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione blinked, surprised by the fast text-flow. The group couldn’t exist longer than a few minutes and they had already managed to organize themselves. She sighed and set to type her answer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone:</b>

<p> </p>
<p>Hermione read the long list with more interest than she would ever admit, shifting uncomfortably in her seat when she realized that the descriptions of those anonymous people were enough to make her wet.</p>
<p>Hermione let her phone become dark for a moment in order to think about what to do next, finally noticing her abandoned half-eaten sandwich on the table in front of her. She sighed and put it back into her bag, before reaching for her phone again with the intention to leave the group and deinstall Owlpost. It was just too awkward.</p>
<p>When Hermione opened the app, she was surprised to see a new message from THEPrinceCharming and opened it, curiosity winning over common sense.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming</b>: <em>You are new to this kind of thing, aren’t you? </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione glared at her phone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone: </b>
  <em>Actually, I am not really into BDSM. I was just asking myself why would somebody be into that and it seemed like a good way to find out. I am not judging </em>
  <em>&amp; I want to understand.</em>
</p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>You sure? That’s what Cass said too, and now look at him. He started a group and is rather happy with it.</em></p>
<p><b>Persephone:</b> <em>Are you trying to tell me what I think and feel?</em></p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming:</b>
  <em> I’m trying to help. So much denial hurts. But seriously, what did you feel when you read about it? About our interests?</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione stared at the screen at a loss of words. How dare this guy, who called himself Prince Charming of all things, patronize her like that?</p>
<p>But then, she had been kind of aroused, still was, if she was honest to herself. So maybe he had a point, Hermione contemplated. But she would have known that for some time now, if that were the case, wouldn’t she? After all, she was far from a virgin.</p>
<p>Hermione was glaring holes into her phone, when somebody cleared their throat next to her.</p>
<p>She looked up to see her classmate Jenny standing next to her, amusement all over her face.</p>
<p>“It’s rare to see you so absorbed into something, that you are about to miss class. You are lucky I passed by.”<br/> Hermione looked on her watch at that and almost shrieked. “How it is already that late?” she asked as she hurried to gather her things and followed Jenny to their next lecture.</p>
<p>Despite herself, Hermione had trouble concentrating the rest of the day thanks to the Prince’s question, mulling it over and over in her head.</p>
<p>As soon as the professor ended the last lecture of the day, Hermione jumped up from her seat and dashed for the door, eager to answer. The last two hours after she had decided that she would stay in the group and talk to the Prince had been pure torture as her curiosity had been killing her.</p>
<p>In her hurry, Hermione didn’t notice that she wasn’t the only one eager to get out and collided with another student, both their things scattering on the ground as she bounced of her classmate and fell to the floor.</p>
<p>“Watch where you are going, Granger,” Draco Malfoy sneered at her as soon as they both caught themselves, looking frantic as he searched for his phone.</p>
<p>Hermione glared at him instead of responding as she gathered her things, as if to dare him to help her. But just as expected neither he nor his friends did and they disappeared as soon as Malfoy found his phone and Hermione thanked the two other students who had helped her, still glaring after him.</p>
<p>If there was someone she truly hated in her year, it was Draco Malfoy, rich brat extraordinaire and the most arrogant prat she had ever met. He was the epitome of the lawyer kid cliché, threatening everyone who as much as looked at him the wrong way with letting his father sue them.</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head to rid herself of the angry thoughts, deciding that she wasn’t in the mood to waste even one more second on the likes of Draco Malfoy as she had almost reached her home, where she could finally check her phone undisturbed.</p>
<p>When she opened the Owlpost, another message from the Prince was waiting for Hermione.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>Did I scare you? Wasn’t my intention. I just wanted to offer you my help, but sometimes I can be a bit pushy, so sorry. I just understand that you can be a bit uncomfortable with coming to terms with this – I was when I first noticed. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione smiled at that, feeling reassured in her decision to stay and inform herself a bit more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Persephone:</b> <em>You didn’t scare me. Some people just can’t spend their whole day in front of a screen. </em></p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone: </b>
  <em>But I have to admit, that I am intrigued. As I don’t know where to begin, it would really be great if you could help me to get informed – that is if the offer still stands.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The reply came immediately, as if he had been waiting for Hermione’s response.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>Of course. Where do you want to start? Have you any ideas? What do you like?</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione bit her lip once again, contemplating the question. What did she like? Normal sex hadn’t been that exciting for her and thinking about it, Hermione had to admit that she had always liked when Ron took charge and things got a bit rougher. Unfortunately, that hadn’t been too often and their unsatisfactory sex life along with several other things had lead to their break-up two years ago, even though they managed to stay friends afterwards.</p>
<p>Hermione took a deep breath a typed in the first admission of many.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone: </b>
  <em>I think I might be into giving up control.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco let out a low whistle when he read the new message from Persephone and Blaise shot him a questioning look from where he was lounging on the sofa of their shared flat.</p>
<p>“Your little group is actually proving to be quite interesting,” Draco grinned and Blaise rose one of the perfectly sculptured eyebrows over his mismatched eyes.</p>
<p>“That girl, Persephone. Wants me to teach her about BDSM,” Draco explained.</p>
<p>“And you are so giddy, because?”</p>
<p>“I want to teach her? Help her?”</p>
<p>Blaise ran a hand over his face. “You know, if you want to be a decent human being you could start with the real life – not that,” he gestured vaguely towards Draco’s phone.</p>
<p>Draco stood up from his armchair and glared at Blaise. “You know that this is different.”</p>
<p>Without another word, Draco walked to his room and shut the door behind him before letting himself fall onto his oversized and way too comfortable bed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming: </b>
  <em>That’s a beginning. Why do you think that? What do you like about it? Have you some experience with it? Any questions?</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco let his phone fall onto his chest and closed his eyes, waiting for the soft buzz indicating that she responded. He had been half asleep when it finally came, but Draco perked up immediately and picked up his phone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Persephone:</b> <em>My ex and I had make-up sex a few times where he was harsher and more demanding and looking back, I really liked it. I don’t know why. It’s just good to not think during sex? </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco smiled at that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>You know that there is this theory that women who are way too controlled in their lives are submissive during sex because they need to let go? Do you think you might be one of them?</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This time, the answer came much faster.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Persephone:</b> <em>Definitely. My friends tell me all the time that I have trouble letting go. You might really have a point.</em></p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone: </b>
  <em>But how about you?</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco ran a hand over his face, considering how to answer that. She was being brutally honest with him even though she had no idea who he was. Considering that he wasn’t planning to ever meet her – no matter how much he might come to like her – he didn’t see a reason to not return the courtesy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming: </b>
  <em>The same theory says that men who lack control over their lives are more often dominant than not. I am the prime example for that.</em>
</p>
<p><b>Persephone:</b> <em>Oh. I am sorry to hear that.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A crooked smile appeared on Draco’s face when he read that. “Not as sorry as I am,” he muttered under his breath.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>Don’t worry your pretty head about it. Do you have any questions? Or something you want to talk about?</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The response was immediate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Persephone:</b> <em>It is somehow reassuring that you called my head pretty – it shows that you truly don’t know who I am.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco smirked at that and set to respond even though he saw that she was still typing. He sent his response a second before her next message arrived.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>Are you so a</em><em>fraid</em><em> of me? Jk, it’s all completely anonymous. There’s no danger for you from my side – I don’t want to be recognized either.</em></p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone: </b>
  <em>But yes, I have a question – several to be honest. But let’s start with the basics. How do people usually find out their limits? Or what they really like?</em>
</p>
<p><b>Persephone:</b> <em>It seems we have something else in common. :)</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco rolled over on his stomach, contemplating the question.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>You try it out, watch porn, masturbate and imagine things, sext. You can rule out things based on how much the image of it turns you on and th</em><em>e</em><em>n try it out. Thanks to safewords you can stop anything you don’t like anytime, so yeah. You know what safewords are?</em></p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone:</b>
  <em> I’ve read about them. They are words you usually don’t use during sex that signal that you are uncomfortable, right?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone:</b>
  <em> and I’ve never done that.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco frowned at the screen. The last two messages confused him a little.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming: </b>
  <em>I thought you were new to this kind of thing? </em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming:</b>
  <em> What haven’t you done?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone:</b>
  <em> I am reading about it right now – I don’t want to bother you with every little thing. I’ll ask if I don’t understand something but the basics are easily found online.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone:</b>
  <em> Watch porn, sext…</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the last message, Draco’s jerk-personality kicked in and he couldn’t stop himself from typing the first thing that came to his mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>Do you w</em><em>an</em><em>t to</em><em> try out sexting? ;)</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had already tipped “jokes” and his finger hovered over the send-button when the reply arrived.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone:</b>
  <em> Yes</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco stared at the screen of his phone, not believing what he was seeing. Only when his phone buzzed again, he realized that he hadn’t moved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <b>Persephone:</b>
  </em>
  <em> But you take the lead.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco took a deep breath, asking himself what the fuck he was doing, before he started typing again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming:</b>
  <em> Fine. But I need to know if there is something you already know that you like or don’t like.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone:</b>
  <em> I am not entirely sure. Maybe start with the basics?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming:</b>
  <em> Fine. Let’s start with some simple rules: You’ll call me Sir and set a safeword. I know I can’t hurt you like this but if this gets too awkward or I suggest something that really isn’t your cup of tea, it’s better to stop than to force yourself into it, possibly ruining all of your future experience with this kind of thing. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming: </b>
  <em>And I am not really getting into BDSM-stuff. I’ll include only a few elements because I have no idea how to do it properly in text form.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming:</b>
  <em> RL is way better</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming:</b>
  <em> TBH I haven’t tried this like this before either. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco wet his lips, waiting for the reply with anticipation. He really didn’t sext much, preferring sex or masturbation to porn, but this could be an interesting experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Persephone:</b> <em>It seems it will be a new experience for both of us, then.</em></p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone: </b>
  <em>Yes, Sir. I choose yellow and red as my safewords.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco smirked at the sight of the basic traffic-light system and set to type.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming:</b>
  <em> Fine with me. Now tell me, princess, what are you currently doing?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone:</b>
  <em> I am lying on my bed, studying.</em>
</p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>What a good girl. But you should put away your school things now and pay attention to me. Will you tell me what you are wearing?</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco ran a hand through his hair. He felt like an idiot writing those things, but how else was he supposed to get into it? Persephone was probably laughing over how stupid he sounded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone: </b>
  <em>Nothing now ;)</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco’s breath hitched and he felt his cock stiffen in his pants. He certainly hadn’t expected that answer. For a girl sexting for the first time in her life, she was good. He could tell so much after just a few sentences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming:</b>
  <em> Good. Very good. Now get to your knees and spread your legs, so you are sitting on your feet, </em>
  <em>your arms crossed behind your back so you push your breasts forward,</em>
  <em> displaying everything as if I were there to admire your beautiful body. I would tell you to close your eyes and bind them, but how would you read this if I did?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming: </b>
  <em>Imagine me there, in your room with you. Standing in front of you, still fully dressed, admiring you </em>
  <em>as you kneel at my feet. </em>
  <em>I slowly unfasten my belt and step around you to bind your hands with it.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone:</b>
  <em> As you wish, Sir. I follow every of your orders. My nipples harden under your gaze and I squirm slightly.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco reached absentmindedly for his cock and softly began stroking it over his cotton trousers. He would never wear something as plebeian as sweatpants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming:</b>
  <em> I command you to open your mouth and put your tongue out as I tuck my already hard cock from my trousers.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone:</b>
  <em> My eyes widen at the sight of your large cock and I feel myself becoming wetter and wetter </em>
  <em>in anticipation.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco glanced down at himself with a smirk. The girl’s reaction was spot on, considering two of his exes had done exactly the same the first time he stood in front of them in the nude.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>I run with my cock over your tongue and your cheeks, teasing the both of us as you wait patiently for me.</em></p>
<p><b>Persephone:</b> <em>I am positively dripping by now, not too far from begging you to let me taste your magnificent cock for real.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco inhaled sharply at that, tucking out his dick from his pants. They hadn’t even started properly as far as he was concerned and she was already making him really aroused.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming: </b>
  <em>I see how much you want this and step forward, letting your wet, warm mouth wrap around my cock.</em>
</p>
<p><b>Persephone:</b> <em>I take in as much of your </em><em>length</em><em> as I can, doing my best to not gag as I please you. I let my tongue slide over the underside of the length as it pull back slowly and circle my tongue over the tip, before taking it all in again. I hum in content.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco groaned, speeding up the movements of the hand around his cock. It seemed Persephone really liked to give blowjobs and Draco found the imagine in his head really sexy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>My hands run through your hair as I start fucking your face, forcing my cock deeper and deeper with every thrust.</em></p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone:</b>
  <em> I close my eyes, suppressing the tears that come involuntarily, taking in as much as I can.</em>
</p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>When I feel myself getting close, I stop and </em><em> pull </em><em>you up to kiss you passionately before</em><em> ordering you to turn around</em><em>, your face on the floor and your arse in the air</em><em>, so I get a good view of you.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>I run a hand over your back, my fingers touching you only so slightly before I withdraw and slap your arse. First one cheek, then another.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone: </b>
  <em>I moan every time your hand comes down on my bare flesh, counting the slaps.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming:</b>
  <em> When we reach 10, I slap your pussy for good measure before I tug my cock out again and </em>
  <em>slide into you with one easy movement.</em>
</p>
<p><b>Persephone:</b> <em>I moan when you finally fill me, </em><em>desperate for release. </em></p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>I pound into you, pulling you up by your hair so your body is flush against mine and I can put a hand around your neck, squeezing.</em></p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone: </b>
  <em>I see stars as you hit the sweet spot inside of me, pinching my hard nipples and limiting my air. </em>
</p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>I bite your shoulder before I command you to come for me </em><em>and finally touch your clit.</em></p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone: </b>
  <em>I cry out as I fall over the edge and my walls clench around your cock. Thank you, Sir.</em>
</p>
<p><b>THEPrinceCharming:</b> <em>I continue fucking you through your orgasm and soon follow as well.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco let his phone fall next to him and closed his eyes, concentrating on the pictures in his head and the feel of his hand on his cock.</p>
<p>He came with a grunt, hoping that Blaise didn’t hear him, the image of a mysterious woman pleasing him in his mind.</p>
<p>As soon as he caught his breath, Draco reached for his phone again. A single message from Persephone was waiting for him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone: </b>
  <em>That was weirdly hot. Thank you, Sir ;)</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco groaned and looked down at himself and his cum-covered clothes and bed. “That it was.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>THEPrinceCharming:</b>
  <em> It was my pleasure ;) </em>
  <em>Can you really deepthroat?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Persephone:</b>
  <em> Who knows ;)</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco threw his phone on the night stand and got up to quickly change his clothes and sheets so he could fall into bed and sleep. He knew that showering would be just a waste of time as he was sure that the pictures that he had created were going to come back during the night.</p>
