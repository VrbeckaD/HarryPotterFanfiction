    <strong>Saturday - November 13th, 2004.</strong>
  </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">The floor was shaking again.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione folded her book together, her thumbs pressed between the pages. She glared at the exposed hardwood, as it that would stop the music that shook the belly of her building.</p><p dir="ltr">She had been in such a frantic state when she'd left Ron, she had taken on the first apartment she'd been accepted for. They hadn't even asked for her to do an inspection and accepted her within hours of her application. It was a man named Stuart Niccals, who owned the bar below. She'd not met him, but if she did, she'd like to thank him.</p><p dir="ltr">The apartment itself? Beautiful.</p><p dir="ltr">There was two bedrooms and a bathtub, with a bay window that she'd crammed full of pillows. There were built-in bookshelves and a spacious kitchen. The view was of a bustling Muggle street, and Diagon Alley was a short walk away.</p><p dir="ltr">Even Crookshanks had been pleased. He strutted around and marked his scent with his cheeks, and rolled all over the bedroom carpet. He had a small balcony that she'd put chicken wire over so he could glare at the busy strip of shops below.</p><p dir="ltr">But right now Crookshanks was tucked into the crook of her elbow, shaken to his little paws.</p><p dir="ltr">And then the music crept up, louder. The patrons had no idea how loud it was, she could make out the drums and bass line.</p><p dir="ltr">She cradled her little kitten, who was really a huge cat... But he was her kitten, no matter how fat or crotchety he got.</p><p dir="ltr">"I know, I'm sorry," she soothed her hand over his back.</p><p dir="ltr">Saturday nights were when it became insufferable. The rest of the week was quaint and quiet. She'd moved in the Monday, and lived in blissful ignorance... Until her decorative glass Sneakascope bounced straight off it's display and shattered.</p><p dir="ltr">She fixed it, but now it whistled every Saturday night as if it knew it was close to a second death.</p><p dir="ltr">It had been three months, and the music had escalated each week. As if they were out to tease her out of her home, like a goat laid before the den of a dragon.</p><p dir="ltr">"They close at one," she scratched behind Crookshanks' ear. "Only... Two more hours."</p><p dir="ltr">And the music got louder.</p><p dir="ltr">She could hear the shape of vocals, the lifts and lows. Did they know they were so insufferable?</p><p dir="ltr">The floor throbbed against her feet, and then she felt a solid thud. Like someone had smacked the soles of her feet.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's it," she jumped up.</p><p dir="ltr">Crookshanks launched himself from her arms, to cling to the cat tree that he was much too big for. It groaned under his weight as he kneaded the rough carpet of it.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's too much, isn't it?" She said, to Crookshanks. He was an excellent listener. She threw on her navy trenchcoat and pulled on some ballet flats. She had her hair up, though otherwise, she was in her pajamas. It was eleven in the evening, and sure, she was being the rude, old neighbor. She was twenty-three, and she was <em>tired</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">And she didn't want to resort to magic, as the Ministry got funny about altering Muggle rentals with magic for minor things. She didn't want to go to Wizegamot because she had a ten o'clock bedtime that'd been ruined by some rowdy ne'er-do-wells. And now she felt even older, as she snatched up her keys and rushed downstairs.</p><p dir="ltr">Her apartment door had a small alcove, where she kept her umbrellas and shoes, but then straight out the door was the bar's backyard. Her stairs led to the back alley of the bar, which was normally quite empty and clean. Instead, there were people on the stairwell, cuddled and tonguing one another's throats. She groaned, and stepped around the bodies.</p><p dir="ltr">Her flannel pajama bottoms gave her little protection against the cool winter evening, as she navigated her way into the bar itself.</p><p dir="ltr">And she wanted to be ill.</p><p dir="ltr">It smelled of sweat and the music was far too loud. She didn't know what her plan was, except that she did, completely. She was going to go find whoever the manager was, and ask if it was strictly necessary to play music soÂ <em>loud</em>. She navigated between the crowds of sweaty youths as if she were lost at sea. It was so wet and salty, she'd not be surprised. One girl tried to grab her hands, to dance, as she smiled and waved her off.</p><p dir="ltr">And she glared at the band, which featured a drummer, two guitarists, and a vocalist. She frowned at them, as if they'd stop by sheer intimidation alone, but they were unaffected.</p><p dir="ltr">The man who had the microphone was too invested to notice her, but she noticed him.</p><p dir="ltr">How could she not?</p><p dir="ltr">She stumbled against a man, who was crouched in the crowd. He seemed to have fallen, or tripped, and he was hunched in a ball. She hadn't fallen, but the stumble had stopped her stalking. She reached out to him, out of pity, and helped him back to his feet. He was too drunk, too gone to even know what had happened.</p><p dir="ltr">"Got a cig?" He asked, mouthy and loud by her ear.</p><p dir="ltr">"No," she shook her head, her nose wrinkled. She was too distracted by the singer, with narrow features and white-blonde hair. He was in the midst of a song she couldn't recognize or understand, but she'd never been one for modern music. She didn't mind musicals, and she loved a little fun pop, but she tended to stick to instrumental music as it allowed her to focus.</p><p dir="ltr">Words were her weak spot, she had to listen to every single one, to test its merits and mettle.</p><p dir="ltr">"Want a drink?" He asked, not sober enough to take the hint.</p><p dir="ltr">"No, thank you," she withdrew her hand, which he'd taken to holding.</p><p dir="ltr">"Are you with someone?"</p><p dir="ltr">"No," Hermione pressed through the crowd, though her gaze refused to shift from the singer. Because, of course.</p><p dir="ltr">It had been six years, and she'd seen him in the <em>Daily Prophet</em>, but she'd see him less and less these days. She palmed her way through the crowd, as she shifted people, all the way to the bar. She swallowed hard, no less resolute in her plan. She waited her turn, though her patience was tested as two men cut ahead of her. She bit down a complaint, aware that she wasn't here to buy drinks, she wasn't a patron.</p><p dir="ltr">Once she got her hands to the bar, she regretted her instinct to grab it. Her hands were wet, and the mush of a paper coaster that'd inflamed from alcohol stuck to her fingers.</p><p dir="ltr">"Where's the manager?"</p><p dir="ltr">The bartender frowned at her, as if to ask why.</p><p dir="ltr">"I have a complaint."</p><p dir="ltr">The bartender pointed at the man on the stage, the same white-blonde man who she'd known had been a mirage.</p><p dir="ltr">And yet he was there, crisp in the fog and the cheap neon lights. He'd changed songs, she thought, and the band behind him picked up. The music swelled and swallowed her, as she glared him down.</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Malfoy owned a Muggle bar?</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">Further to that, Malfoy was in a Muggle band?</p><p dir="ltr">Her eyes couldn't seem to focus, as she stared down the set. She thought if she stared long enough he'd vanish back into the pages of the <em>Daily Prophet</em>, as if he'd wink out of existence, as he had years ago. She'd put the war to rest long ago, she'd attended the funerals and helped fundraise to undo the damages.</p><p dir="ltr">But the flash of ice-blue as his eyes met hers, that was enough to confirm that she'd been fooled.</p><p dir="ltr">There was no Stuart Niccals.</p><p dir="ltr">There was only Draco Malfoy, wrapped in the name of another man.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione ordered herself a glass of water with a slice of lemon, and she sat. She endured the deafening blares of the sound system, and she sipped at her water with the most contemptuous lips. He had to have seen her, she wagered. He didn't make it known, if he had. He didn't look her way too much or too little.</p><p dir="ltr">(This upset her more than it should have.)</p><p dir="ltr">By the end of his 'set', if that's what they called it, he soaked up the applause and smiled. He looked so unlike the frail boy she'd known during the end days of the war. But then again, she thought of his self-centered ego and his need for attention, and it made sense. Of course, he'd manipulate Muggles and make them think he was good at music.</p><p dir="ltr">"Thank you, as always! We're selling CDs, you better bloody buy one or I'll hunt you down," he laughed, and the crowd laughed, and Hermione laughed, in a mocking way.</p><p dir="ltr">He had a simple black outfit on, t-shirt and jeans, with chains at his hips and too many rings. She could see the Dark Mark on his inner forearm, but it was swamped with other black tattoos, so much so that the shape was lost. But she knew it was there.</p><p dir="ltr">And then he got off the stage, and vanished.</p><p dir="ltr">And she threw her glass onto the table and didn't even flinch when it rolled and shattered.</p><p dir="ltr">She rushed over to the side of the stage, to see a flock of girls who looked too young to be in a bar. She frowned as they circled around him, a vulture to meat, and scoffed loudly when he signed a girl's belly. He'd had to crouch, and stuck his tongue out as if it were so difficult. He looked up to her, said something under his breath, under the din of the filler music, and shot up to peck her on the cheek. She laughed, and Hermione wondered if the place was filled with general anesthesia given how people were so giggly.</p><p dir="ltr">But his task was complete, she recognized. The music was lower, and she'd be able to sleep.</p><p dir="ltr">It was one.</p><p dir="ltr">She'd been here for two hours? How was that possible?</p><p dir="ltr">As Malfoy worked through the crowd, she felt the struggle of lionheart bravery and schoolgirl dread. He had been cruel to her in school, save for a few moments of kindness. But as a rule, he was a prat, and he continued to be a prat. She felt this solidify in her vision, as she watched him schmooze through the crowd like he was a big deal.</p><p dir="ltr">No wonder he had a bar, dedicated to his own trashy music. Of course, he'd sink hundreds of thousands of dollars into property, for a little fancy fun.</p><p dir="ltr">When he saw her, he didn't look surprised. Rather, he looked bored, as if she were a guest who'd turned up late. "Took you long enough," Malfoy drawled, as the crowd thinned and he looked her over.</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione lost every drop of venom, as ice-blue met brown, and she swelled beneath the shadows of the bar.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'd thought you'd storm down here the first night to complain, but," he shook his wrist, to check a wristband as if it were a watch. "It took you three months. I'd thought you'd rush down here with your knickers all twisted up by at least the fourth night."</p><p dir="ltr">"You've been doing this on purpose?" She gestured, wide, as if she wanted to drown him in the sea of people.</p><p dir="ltr">Draco smirked down at her, his hands tucked into his pockets. She decided she didn't like the torn black jeans and the too-tight black t-shirt, like he was a Muggle, like he wasn't a pompous Pure-blood with too much time and money on his hands.</p><p dir="ltr">"Well, fantastic for you, you got what you wanted, you can stop deafening me now," she tossed her head, to knock some loose strands from her face.</p><p dir="ltr">"Oh, you don't like independent musicians?" Draco pressed a hand to his chest, mock-offense etched into every inch of his face. "<em>Hermione</em>."</p><p dir="ltr">"Don't -- Do not use my name!"</p><p dir="ltr">Draco pouted down at her, before his eyebrow inched up. "If you say so, love."</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione rotated her jaw and decided to take her leave. She had questions, too many of them, but she didn't want to give him the satisfaction. She went to push past him, to get back to her apartment. He stepped into her path, his too-slick smirk still painted onto his lips.</p><p dir="ltr">"I have to ask," he gestured to her, to her flannel pajama bottoms and her unruly updo. "I'd expected you to at least <em>try</em>. I'd not pick you for someone to slouch down to a bar, in her pajamas."</p><p dir="ltr">"I came down to complain to the manager," Hermione pushed past him, as he followed her with ease. He had longer legs, while she had little toddling legs. She hated it.</p><p dir="ltr">"So complain," he gestured, wide, as he high-fived a girl who walked past. "I'm all ears."</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione pivoted, too easily baited. "You're blaring your awful music until one in the morning, and I want to sleep."</p><p dir="ltr">Draco smiled down at her, his hands back in his pockets. "So awful that you sat here forÂ <em>two hours</em> to say as much?"</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione lifted her chin, but no words came out.</p><p dir="ltr">"I know, I'm good, you don't have to tell me." He scratched his neck, and she couldn't help but watch the tattoos up close. They were a mixture of black ink tattoos, of bones, flowers, skulls, insects... It was such a strange smattering, she couldn't pick one detail out of them all.</p><p dir="ltr">"Why... <em>Here</em>?" She stepped closer, to whisper to him. "Why not somewhere more... Like you?"</p><p dir="ltr">Draco's lazy smirk faded, as he blinked through the question. "What's more like me?"</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione stared up at him, as the patrons of the bar began to shuffle out. The lights had been switched on, and the strange black shapes of furniture looked so much more mundane in the light. Empty glasses and cups were strewn around, and the couches had all been angled and offset in strange ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Worst of all, the neon light ambiance died, and Malfoy looked so much more like Draco, sickly and slim, with dark circles and translucent skin.</p><p dir="ltr">She couldn't see the man who'd been singing on stage, lost in the music.</p><p dir="ltr">She just saw Draco.</p>

    <strong>Sunday - November 14th, 2004.</strong>
  </em>
</p><p>Hermione relaxed in her bathtub, with a too-expensive bath bomb that Ginny had gotten her for her breakup last month. She'd made a whole care package, of chocolates and treats.</p><p>Six years was a lot of time to spend on someone, though perhaps that was where the issue stemmed from. It wasn't that she'd lost a relationship, but more than she'd lost six years. It was more like a fade away than a break up. She couldn't stay in a flat with him. He'd offered to let her use their spare bedroom as their bedroom, and they could take time, to rekindle things. There wasn't a lack of a spark, though.</p><p>They were on fire; that was the problem.</p><p>She toyed with the bubbles, and the pink frothy dye. It was one of Fred and -- was it simply George now? She didn't linger, her mind tugged by a half-there crush she'd once had on Fred. She admired the bubbles that turned to hearts, as they floated into the air. Each time a bubble burst, it played a different note of a song. This song was something melodic and sad, though she could half-hear it.</p><p>The bar last night had killed her hearing, as she'd endured two hours of Draco Malfoy's singing.</p><p>She hadn't recognized his band, or the music, and it was a strange thing to encounter. She had never seen Draco in anything close to a Muggle setting, or clothes unless you counted the camping grounds or how he'd wear suits. She tongued apart her lips as she flipped the page of her book, on healthy habits for young adults.</p><p>She'd left the bar when the lights had flicked on. Malfoy had been called over by a bartender, about a shortage of red wine, and he'd jogged off. He'd not said goodbye, and she'd not thought to stay. She didn't know if she was meant to, but she had no interest. She had been baited down, for reasons she was happy to keep mysterious.Â </p><p>Her rapid acceptance to the apartment made more and less sense now, as Malfoy had recognized her name... But he hated her.</p><p>So why accept her?</p><p>She sunk further into the bathtub, her arms lofted either side as she glared up at the ceiling.</p><p>After the bubbles stopped their song and the water went lukewarm, she saw herself out of the bath and into her modest bedroom. She could have afforded something bigger, but she wanted to save money rather than splurge. She only had herself to rely on, though she doubted Harry would let her struggle and Ron... Well, he had the joke shop with George, but she refused to lean on him for funds.</p><p>She didn't need money. She needed -- she didn't know what she needed, actually.</p><p>Time. Space.</p><p>Food?</p><p>She didn't know. This was the problem.</p><p>Food was the easiest to get, so she dressed for the afternoon outside. It was damp and cool, with light rain. Her hair made her painfully aware of how humid it'd become, as it fluffed out like a frizzy barometer. She patted it down, an umbrella held aloft. She shook it out, to protect herself, and sped down to one of the dozens of cafes below.</p><p>And for once, she ate outside, alone, unfazed by how alone she really was.</p><p>She'd had Ron all these years. She'd not thought to make friends, as she had difficulty with keeping them. She wasn't unsociable, but it was difficult to focus on your career and on friends. She had Ginny and Harry, but the conversation would inevitably steer towards what Ron was up to, and how Lavender had moved in, and how it wasn't like that, she just needed a place to stay.</p><p>And Hermione knew it was exactly like that, and she didn't really care.</p><p>She really didn't.</p><p>Not even as she watched a man in a black suit sit down in front of her, black coffee in hand. He had one ring now, the Malfoy signet ring, and it clinked against the ceramic with anticipation.</p><p>"Now, where were we?"</p>
