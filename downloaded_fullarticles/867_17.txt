    <p>
  <span>Over the last 43 minutes Lily has spent a lot of time considering whether not correcting a very incorrect assumption is technically lying.  It does feel like the easy way out at first, allowing the whole charade to keep moving forward but first they won’t treat Remus because his condition requires certain extraordinary measures.  Then, she badgers her way into the room and starts rattling off what he can and can’t take as a werewolf. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Which in reality, is just information she’s got to know by virtue of her self and later societally accepted title as the foremost authority on the care and treatment of lycanthropes.  Her main goal was and still is creating some sort of alternative to wolfsbane, something better.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She met Remus in pursuit of all this, while she’s prioritized the technical and healing related end, Remus is practically the poster child for a functional werewolf fully integrated into wizarding society.  He’s made countless friends and enemies for his tireless work helping others like him learn to function after they’re turned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And it would seem today, some of those enemies came out of the woodwork.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily wasn’t even supposed to be there, wasn’t supposed to be meeting Remus.  Generally their meetings have always been happenstance at some gala or conference where their interests aligned.  But they did both enjoy the anonymity of London, the simplicity a ride on the Tube, so they’d run into one another every so often and offer a wave or chat for a few minutes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All this took place in the first thirty minutes of daylight on bloody Christmas Day and if it’s not sad to be alone on Christmas Day, or better yet in an empty Tube station, then being in a hospital pretending you’re engaged to a man in a coma has to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If anyone deserves this level of friendship commitment from a near stranger though, it’s Remus Lupin.  Tireless and selfless in everything he does, he should be given a bloody award not pushed into the gap while a train careens for his immobile body.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At first, when she’d jumped onto the track Lily thought the worst.  But his eyes fluttered and he smiled briefly before fading back out.  Lily’d wanted to chase after the idiots bandying their wands about like arseholes but Remus had lost conciousness and he was definitely bleeding from his head wound.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Plus muggle authorities were bound to show up sooner or later and he very much needed to see a healer who knows what to do with werewolves.  Or who would at least </span>
  <em>
    <span>listen </span>
  </em>
  <span>when Lily told them things about treating werewolves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And now, after a harrowing apparition to Mungo’s, much barking and a little begging, all Lily can do is...</span>
  <em>
    <span>sit</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Which she hates.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s just.  Everyone knows what Remus is - knows his condition.  But that doesn’t mean he’s safe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, obviously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So he’s here, in a bloody </span>
  <em>
    <span>coma </span>
  </em>
  <span>and Lily is </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>about to leave him at the mercy of well-intended but definitely overworked hospital staff.  Staff who are definitely not equipped to protect Remus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Altogether, it means Lily’s in it for the long haul.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’s alert and poised for attack the first few hours, heedless of the ache in her back or the growing tension in her neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As of yet, no one - friend or foe - has arrived, and Lily’s a bit ticked off on his behalf.  Why doesn’t Remus Lupin have a hospital full of grateful admirers and loving family?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’s still simmering with anger when the door flies open with a thud and a little mob of people bustle in, shoving and firing off questions at no one in particular.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Until they see Lily and all stutter to a halt seemingly en masse.  There are five of them total, one of the men looks like a glimpse of another about forty years in the future, the second a bloke who’s so fit it hurts, another entirely too handsome to be real, an elegant woman who seems to use her appearance to disguise her cheek, and the fifth who seems just happy to be included.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And also appears very familiar - watery blue eyes, nervous sniffles, lank blonde hair…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily doesn’t have much chance to consider it because suddenly five sets of eyes are pinned on her.  So-fit-it-hurts ruffles his curls and narrows his eyes. “Who’re you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And now, the assistant healer sees fit to get involved and leans in from the doorway.  “Mr. Lupin’s fiance!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Too-handsome looks dubious while Elegant-cheeky shrieks.  “Oh </span>
  <em>
    <span>Remus </span>
  </em>
  <span>why didn’t he say?  Aren’t you just the most - ”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fit one cuts in, “Why </span>
  <em>
    <span>didn’t </span>
  </em>
  <span>he say?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The older man lays a hand on his shoulder and frowns.  “Alright, James. Mia. Let’s focus on how he’s doing and worry about all that later.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tense moment somewhat broken, one of the healers assigned to Remus’ case returns with updates that aren’t much for Lily but do at least bring what she supposes is his family up to date.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Basically, Remus is stable and they’re not </span>
  <em>
    <span>overly</span>
  </em>
  <span> concerned beyond the fact that he’s in a damn coma.  Salty language was Lily’s mental addition to the much longer, needlessly detailed </span>
  <em>
    <span>blur </span>
  </em>
  <span>of information.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then once the interrogation of poor Healer Jergins ends and she leaves probably for a cup of tea or perhaps a belt of whiskey, focus shifts to Lily full force.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James - the tall, lanky one with glasses - crosses his arms over his chest and eyes her appraisingly.  Like one might look at an overgrown hedge that needed to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>dealt with</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you and Remus are - together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily’s about sixty percent sure she’s going to come clean and explain when the rat faced one perks up and steps closer.  With an interest that isn’t quite genuine care for his imperiled mate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She takes stock of her new companions, recognizing Sirius Black - the alleged ‘black </span>
  <em>
    <span>sheep</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ of his family, the trio that’s clearly related, and mouse nose and Lily realizes just how little she knows of them.  Of whether they’re worthy of trust.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Petunia and </span>
  <em>
    <span>Vernon </span>
  </em>
  <span>showed up at her bedside she’d not like Remus much if he left her at their mercy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So her decision is made in the span of a few moments.  “Yes, we are.”</span>
</p>
