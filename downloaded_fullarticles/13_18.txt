    <p>One of the worst things about my insomnia is the waiting. I can never be sure once I retire to my four-poster bed in the evening, having brushed my teeth and put on my pajamas if it will be one of those nights. Sometimes I fall asleep almost instantly as soon as my head touches the pillow, my thoughts muddled by dreams or at times nightmares. Other times I close my eyes and promptly know that I won’t find any rest tonight. Insomnia cannot be bargained with, no matter how much I will my body to sleep, because I have an important test the next day, or a quidditch match, if my sleeplessness visits my fate is sealed.</p><p>I have become quite adept at dealing with sleepless nights. Once I know I won’t sleep I firstly close the curtains around my bed completely and put up silencing charms. I used to freak out Ron with my frequent bursts of insomnia- he can’t help it; he worries about me. But for over a year now I have been proficient in pretending to get a good night’s sleep whenever I go to bed. Silencing charms are so helpful with this, together with a certain nonchalance in the morning when I am asked about my nightly endeavors. I hate to lie but I have become quite good at it.</p><p>Second, you need to have access to tools to help pass the time. The hours between bedtime and morning are long and drag out even more when you watch your tempus spell all the time so it’s better to take your mind off it. I do not want to open my curtain for fear of waking up one of my roommates so I usually have some sweets stuffed somewhere under my pillow (no chocolate; they melt and it’s a pain to get it out of the sheets). I also used to get my hand on some quidditch magazines or a couple of detective novels that I snatched from Seamus. They are surprisingly entertaining, at least for the first three or four reads. But I guess everything becomes boring after many repetitions.</p><p>Except wanking, that’s always good, no matter how often you repeat it. The first two and a half years were quite hard on me with my insomnia: I had little to do except stare at the canopy of my bed and wait for the seconds to pass. I had not yet gotten my hand on Seamus’ old detective magazines and barely possessed many sweets. But in my third year I discovered wanking- by accident more or less.</p><p>Of course I had heard the other boys talk about jerking off now and then but found it hard to trust their fuss about it. What could be so fun about touching your prick? One evening I was in my bed, another sleepless night and I was tossing and turning on my sheets until I came to rest on my stomach. My own weight, as little as it is, pressed me into the mattress and when I moved just the tiniest it created a very pleasurable friction against my prick. Suffice to say I never stopped after that.</p><p>Yeah, I admit it: I am quite horny. In my defense I am sixteen years old so I guess it’s pretty normal. I know all the guys in my room wank. I mean, we put up silencing charms but sometimes you forget. It’s cool, we never mention it or mock someone. We are all in this together, one prick at a time.</p><p>Seamus is quite fond of morning wanks. He usually wakes up a couple of minutes early and then gets down to business. He is quite efficient and his fondling usually features a different girl every couple of weeks. I know from our communal showers that Seamus got the longest prick of all five of us. I checked. Sue me.</p><p>Ron enjoys quite extensive evening wanks, usually shortly after closing his curtains. I can almost imagine him settling into his sheets, pulling down his trousers and then grip his prick. He is the absolute worst with silencing charms, forgetting to put them on more often than not. He either has no shame at all and the idea of an audience arouses him or he is just careless. Knowing Ron it is likely a combination of both. It was fun the first couple of times but for almost a year now he groans out Hermione’s name every single time. Boy does that go old fast. I have been very diligent with my own silencing charms for a while now.</p><p>Dean has wet dreams mostly. I hear him moaning and thrashing in his sleep as he works up to his orgasm. For a while it was random girls but now he groans out Ginny’s name when he is coming. Makes sense, she is his girlfriend after all. I was mostly okay with it but now I am not so sure. Ginny is very attractive, with her red hair and green eyes. And she is part of the Weasley family: I’d be lying if I denied that if I dream about my future- should I survive my final confrontation with Voldemort- I see myself as part of the Weasleys. Marrying Ginny would be a foul-proof way to get there but that only works if Ron does not kill me before, should I ever make a move on his sister.</p><p>Neville is the odd one out. I never hear him. Granted, that doesn’t mean he does not wank- all boys wank, I am sure of that- maybe he is just meticulous with silencing charms. Maybe even more than me. Or he wanks somewhere else. The greenhouse. He loves plants after all. Not like that you pervert. I hope he gets himself off now and then. It is relaxing and judging by how stressed and afraid Neville usually is, he deserves all the relaxation he can get. Then again, after last year in the department of mysteries Neville is showing more and more courage; that guy is a trouper. If he faces anybody but Professor Snape. Then he literally pees his pants. Poor Neville.</p><p>Back to me and my prick. I wank all the time. Sometimes to fall asleep, sometimes in the middle of the night and definitely several times when I face my insomnia. For the longest time I simply rutted against my mattress; I am still pretty fond of it. But in the years I experimented and have found there are so many great ways to get yourself off. Fist around your prick, kneading your balls, gently caressing the sensitive area behind your cock, recently more and more thrusting your fingers into your ass.</p><p>As I am doing right now. I can feel the way the muscles are clenching around my wet, saliva dipped finger as I pump my cock with the other hand. Up and down, my legs spread impossibly wide as I slowly work up to my orgasm. I can feel the blood rushing through my veins, the hectic thrumming of my heart and the shallow gasps that tumble out of my mouth. There are no names out of my mouth, I rarely think about anybody specific as I focus on my release. I just want to feel that rush, the sweet agony of my orgasm as it runs through my body and the pleasant apathy of the aftermath as I stare at the canopy of my bed. I seldom need anything else.</p><p>You don’t believe me? Okay I might have uttered a name once or twice. Fine, maybe more than twice. It might have been Oliver Wood in the first year of my wanking. On occasion. Not all the time. Then Cho. In my fourth year. Alternating with Cedric. But recently? Not much. Maybe I was thinking about Ginny a couple of times but it feels weird then. It’s times like these when I begin to doubt whether I should ever pursue her. I mean if we ever do get married, we are going to have sex, right? I have a feeling I might still wank then. Would I have to moan out her name as I come trembling, just barely keeping from thrusting up against the roof of my bed? Would it be cool to moan out a different name even if you are married to someone else? I doubt it.</p><p>As I snuggle into my sheets still filled by my endorphin high I begin to feel the weary fatigue of post-orgasmic bliss. It renders my extremities heavy, as if they are made of lead and for a short moment it feels as if I might fall asleep after all. It fades. It always does. I told you, I won’t find any sleep tonight. I made my peace with it after all these years.</p><p>Eventually, the feeling returns to my legs and I lazily pull out a package of crisps from under my pillow. As I munch them I longingly stare at the book to my right. <em>Advanced potion making. </em>I should have left it in my trunk, now I won’t be able to stop looking at it. Burning to touch it, open it, get lost in the annotations. I wonder how long I am going to last tonight. Yesterday I almost made it to twenty minutes before I faltered and greedily seized the old, beaten book. I try to tell myself that it’s fine but it is anything but. Hermione reads books in her bed all the time but that’s Hermione. The know-it-all. The devourer of books. She read <em>Hogwarts, a History</em> several times for fucks sake! In her first year! There is no telling how many times she read it since then. Still, I have a feeling Hermione does not caress any book after wanking and hungrily devours it as if it makes her body shudder with more orgasmic throbbing.</p><p>I am sick. I couldn’t even tell you what it is about that book that hooks me like that. Like an addict to his favorite drug. Like a moth to a flame. It burns me, I desire it, I can’t indulge in it as often as I’d like. People would think I am weird if I carried it around all the time, cradled it while I have my breakfast in the great hall or took it with me on my broom during quidditch practice. They would think I lost my mind. Which would be hilarious now that I am for some reason popular and have girls pining after me. Girls, never guys. Nobody can ever see how I fuck my own fist as I press my face against the pages of that infernal book. I have never come that furiously before.</p><p>I need to be more careful with the book. Ron has been watching me, looking at me as if I lost my marbles. If he knew I dream about spilling my seed all over the damn book he would smack me over the head. Or take the book. Likely both. He is protective like that. Not that he has any vantage point to judge me. He was moaning Fleur’s name for months in our fourth year. His future sister in law. Who is messed up now?</p><p>Hermione thinks the book is cursed. She has been tormenting the Prince with all kinds of spells. Ehm, the book of course. Not the Prince. Why was I ever mentioning the smooth-talking, witty, talented, smart, sassy former owner of my potions textbook? I wasn’t, you did! You perv. I have a professional relationship with the Half-blood Prince. He assists me in potions, I laugh about his dark jokes. We are quite the team, he and I. I might have moaned something that could have sounded a tiny bit like <em>Prince</em> while I was wanking. So what? It wasn’t that Prince. It was the other one. Look, a pixie!</p><p>Anywho, we were talking about my roommates wanking habits, not mine. They are not that strange. I bet people jerk off to all kinds of weird things. I don’t even know if the Prince is a girl or a boy. Okay, I am pretty sure he is a boy. Otherwise he would call himself a princess, duh! It’s not rocket science. Hermione only bangs on about it because she is nuts. And jealous of him. I am pretty sure he’s smarter than her. That pisses her off. I adore Hermione but she is a bit of a swot.</p><p>Ginny even suggested the potions book is anything like Riddle’s diary in second year. Wanting to seduce me with its suave writing. I wish. It’s just a book. That I am currently paging through. I check my tempus spell again. Twelve minutes. Damn! Look at his handwriting, it’s almost as messy as mine. But there is a purpose to it, an elegance even in the messiness, the way he talks about his potion-making process, how he comes to his conclusions. It’s beautiful. Why can’t anybody understand this?</p><p>I’ve never been much into potions; I mean what do you expect? For the first five years my teacher was Snape. He hates me, and sucks at teaching. I would give anything to be taught by my Half-blood Prince instead. He gets me. He is funny. Alright, sometimes he is a little mean but I get it. I don’t think he had many friends and most of the other students and even teachers were dimwits. The difference is the Prince punches up; Snape always punches down. Don’t believe me? Neville literally peed his pants twice in his first year during potion classes. Snape knew and it never made him stop the way he zeroed in on poor Neville. He only ever stopped to torment me. It’s okay, I can take it. Sometimes, when I get engrossed in my book I can imagine how it would be to make potions with the Prince. It would be fun, almost sensual. He is a poet, the way he talks about potions. Snape only ever sounds like that when he talks about the Dark Arts.</p><p>I am rereading the section about safety precautions. It’s one of my favorite parts. Apparently, the Prince did not deem this chapter important, he basically ignored it. Instead, on the margins there are annotations about other students. They are vicious but also hilarious. A couple of them he calls the brawnies. I have the feeling he did not get along with them well. Here, he describes their incompetence as they prepare the ingredients. As I said, it’s hilarious. It’s makes me chuckle. I have a feeling they are Gryffindors. Don’t misunderstand me, I love my house but it sounds suspiciously like us.</p><p>In the next bed I can hear Ron mutter in his sleep and then a low moan fills the room. Damn it, Dean is having one of his dreams again. I recast my silencing charm. Great, now I am horny again. I pull my hand into my trousers and grip my prick. Strange, it’s already fully hard, leaking a little from the tip. I lazily pump my fist around it, slowly moving up and down, pushing my foreskin away from the tip of my cock. The pre-come lubricates my movement as I caress the book page absent-mindedly. It’s so soft. I press my cheek against the page, my lips cover the handwriting of my Prince.</p><p>I imagine the book is him, he is lying by my side, his breath tickling my neck. I know next to nothing about him but I know if he were here, it would not matter how he looked, who he was, how big his cock was, I would assault his lips with mine and rut against his stomach until I squirt all my seed all over him. Then I would move down and close my mouth around his hardness; in my mind I am an expert in giving head and he writhes and thrashes under me as I greedily gulp down his come. I am hard again, just the sound of his voice arouses me and I once again rut against him, his hands in my hair as he viciously devours my mouth.</p><p>Fuck, just the thought makes me whimper with need as I move my lips over the page, tracing his scripture with the tip of my tongue. Thank god I recast my silencing charm. I don’t care anymore as I moan and shout his name over and over as I explode over my fist. Later, I lie there, exhausted, spent and press the book to my chest. I can feel the old, calloused cover against my shirt. Fuck it, I want to feel it against my skin. I tear off my top and hiss as I feel it against my nipples. This feels so good!</p><p>I am screwed, I know it. I can’t ever let him go now. My Prince. Just the thought makes me growl low in my throat. So many things suck right now but this book, and its author, ground me in a way nothing else can. Nothing can touch me as long as I have him by my side. Malfoy, Snape, Voldemort. My conflicted feelings about Ginny and the Weasleys. The impending doom on the horizon. There is a reason Dumbledore decided to teach me this year. I am not stupid. Whatever is coming is just around the corner. I have a feeling I won’t like it once it’s here.</p><p>The Prince is safe. He can’t ever hurt me; he is only a figment of my imagination. I realize that. He might have gone to school here a year ago, ten or fifty. I will never know most likely. A part of me needs him here so badly, wants to curl up against him in the darkness of my bed; the other part understands the impossibility of that ever happening makes him perfect for me. Right now. I long for him but also rejoice in the certainty that reality can never spoil my Prince. Most people are never as awesome as how we imagine them to be. Reality destroys fantasy all the time. Not my Prince. He is unscathed by all this.</p><p>I pull up the covers around my shoulders, still pressing the book against my chest. Fuck it, I might even sleep like this. If I am lucky I get two, three hours of sleep if I fall asleep right now. The book feels warm against my skin, the thick paper of the pages brushing against my nipples. I won’t get hard from this caress, not after that orgasm. I can hear the sound of my breathing in the sanctuary of my bed. It lulls me to sleep; the book my guardian against the dark shadows that loom on the horizon. I can almost feel his body’s warmth next to me, radiating against my naked shoulders. I might be a little weird but that’s okay. I got my Prince. Always.</p>
