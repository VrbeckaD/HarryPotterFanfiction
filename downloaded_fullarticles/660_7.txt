    <p>Harry: I have something to tell you.<br/>
Hermione: What is it Harry?<br/>
Ron: Yeah what is it mate?<br/>
Harry: I'm...well...I'm erm...I'm gay.<br/>
Ron: WHAT?! No you can't be.<br/>
Hermione: Harry that's wrong.<br/>
Harry: You know what? Just forget I ever said anything.<br/>
He storms up to his dorm and collapses on his bed. He falls asleep.</p><p>A hooded figure walks over to him.<br/>
Draco: Tonight is the night.<br/>
Harry: So soon?<br/>
Draco: Yes I am afraid. You have come to accept yourself and your creature is ready.<br/>
Harry: I want to know who you are.<br/>
Draco: I know you do darling. You will find out tomorrow.<br/>
Harry: I keep meaning to ask. What's your creature?<br/>
Draco: Dom Veela.<br/>
Harry: Do you know what mine is?<br/>
Draco: There is only one creature that ever is a Veela's sub darling.<br/>
Harry: Oh yeah.<br/>
Draco: You were distressed earlier. What happened?<br/>
Harry starts crying. Draco wraps his arms around Harry.<br/>
Draco: Who ever it was will have their throat ripped out tomorrow don't you worry.<br/>
Harry just cries harder.<br/>
Draco: It was Weaselbee and the Mudblood wasn't it?<br/>
Harry nods.<br/>
Draco: I'll deal with them don't worry.<br/>
They stand there for a bit Harry crying into Draco's shoulder.<br/>
Draco: Sweetheart I have to go.<br/>
Harry: Why?<br/>
Draco: You have to wake up to go through your inheritance and I need to talk to Pansy.<br/>
Draco wipes Harry's tears.<br/>
Harry: What's that mark on your wrist?<br/>
Draco: Mate mark. You'll have one too.<br/>
Harry looks down at his left wrist and sees a tattoo of a bunch of flowers.<br/>
Harry: It's beautiful.<br/>
Draco: I know.<br/>
Harry: Do you have to same one?<br/>
Draco: Yes. It's the first sign of your creature inheritance.<br/>
Harry: I can't wait to see you tomorrow.<br/>
Draco: That reminds me. Sev' said that he was going to give us a surprise quiz tomorrow.<br/>
Harry: Tosser.<br/>
Draco: I know.<br/>
Harry: What's it on?<br/>
Draco: Felix Felicis.<br/>
Harry: Thanks for warning me.<br/>
Draco: Don't worry. If there is anything you forget during the test ask me.<br/>
Harry: How? The dungeon bat will see us passing notes.<br/>
Draco: We have a mental bond and we can communicate through it. Try it when you wake up.<br/>
Harry: I will.<br/>
Draco: Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>Harry wakes up with the biggest smile on his face.<br/>
Ron: Why are you so happy?<br/>
Harry: Because, Weaselbee, my mate is going to smash your head in for your little outburst earlier.<br/>
Ron: I'll tell McGonagal.<br/>
Harry: There is nothing she can do.</p>
