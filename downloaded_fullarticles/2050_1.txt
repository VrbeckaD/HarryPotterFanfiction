          <div class="userstuff"><p>As the evening sun is shining on the tow'r of Ravenclaw<br/>
see, a body cold lies on the Quidditch field<br/>
Is slowly carried off the field amid shouts from voices raw<br/>
with the last few rays of sun the day will yield<br/>
Heavy feet are walking down over flowers as they tread<br/>
heavy heads are bowing down as if to pray<br/>
From what should be victory a Hufflepuff is carried dead<br/>
over green that night is turning into gray</p><p>He was bold and he was mighty, says the noble Gryffindor<br/>
he was barely as a Hufflepuff at all<br/>
He was resourceful and pure-blood, so the Slytherin implore<br/>
our champion despite his house so small<br/>
He was wise and he was studious, says ready Ravenclaw<br/>
he had a mind that could rival one of ours<br/>
Slowly walk and speak with care, whispers loyal Hufflepuff<br/>
so you do not tread upon and hurt the flowers</p><p>He is gone, say the four, tell the father what has become<br/>
Albus Dumbledore then bids his last adieu:<br/>
Remember Cedric Diggory, remember if time should come<br/>
when you have to make a choice between the two:<br/>
what is right and what is easy, remember then the boy,<br/>
the Hufflepuff who was good and kind and brave.<br/>
But a heavy foot treads down and a flower is destroyed<br/>
on the field where boots the sorrow do engrave</p><p>Over grass and over huts the night whispers as it flies<br/>
and pale stars are looking sadly from the sky<br/>
From the moor and from the west a poor light it lonely shines,<br/>
tells a song to the black water of the lake<br/>
And the storm sings wild and bold and in froth around the shores<br/>
sings the waves of those who wear the shirts of red<br/>
Over black and angry waters the night plays up a song<br/>
for a flower and a Hufflepuff is dead</p>
