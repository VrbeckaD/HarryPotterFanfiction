    <p>I sighed as I flopped down on my bed. It had been a very long week full of battles against strong trainers who all wanted my spot as Champion. After seven years it was extremely tempting to just let them have it. I loved being champion and getting to battle other trainers who had worked as hard as I, to get where they are but, it was getting old. Having to make appearances on tv and at public events was exhausting for both me and my pokemon. We needed a break, especially now with Chris joining the team. I looked down at the newly hatched Zorua curled up against my side and smiled. I looked up at at a light blue colored Ninetails, my faithful partner, the one I started my pokemon journey with. “What should I do Marshall?” He let out a soft bark and laid his head on my stomach. “You don’t know either, that’s fine, we have time to think about it.”<br/>
It was then that I heard my mother call my name from downstairs. “Calem, someone is here to see you.” I groaned and sat up carefully,trying not to wake the baby pokemon beside me, with no luck. Chris let out a tiny whine as he looked up at me sleepily. “Sorry buddy.” I scooped him up and cradled him in my arms, taking him with me downstairs, Marshall following close behind me.  In the entryway standing beside my mom was an old man wearing a strange purple robe-like outfit with an extremely long silver beard and half moon spectacles.<br/>
“What’s up mom? Who's this?” The old man smiled.<br/>
“My name is Albus Dumbledore, I would shake your hand but it seems like they are full.” He said in a friendly, joking manner and I couldn’t help but smile.<br/>
“Calem Xavier, and yeah, sorry. He’s sleepy and doesn’t want to be put down. May I ask why you’re here Mr. Dumbledore?”<br/>
“I came here to offer you a teaching job at my school, which is outside of the pokénations. It is a school for children with magical abilities, now before you dismiss me. Think about the creatures called pokemon, if they can exist why can witches and wizards not?”<br/>
“You have a point.” I say with a nod. “Hmm, I do need a break from my role as champion. You have yourself a deal. I will need some time to prepare.”<br/>
“Is a week long enough?”<br/>
“That should be fine.”<br/>
“Thank you for accepting the position, I’ll be back to get you in a week.”</p>
