</p><p>
  <span>Harry Potter had a soft spot for discarded things. This quality was often attributed by Hermione to his upbringing with the Dursleys- something about only owning hand-me-downs for years had made him positively melt at the site of an old teddy bear with a missing eye, or an old tea-cup stained with the previous owner’s love of Earl Grey. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So for those who really knew Harry the </span>
  <em>
    <span>most</span>
  </em>
  <span>, it wasn’t too much of a surprise when, after graduating University he used the money his parents had left him to start up a small restoration and thrift store. People hired him to restore their family’s old heirlooms or would drop off unwanted items that Harry would then clean up, love, and sell in his shop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t the glamorous career in law that had been envisioned for him, but he loved his work and that meant the world to him. He could take the eye-rolls when he talked about his work to his friends and the itching feeling of being abandoned as they all pursued higher levels of education and “real careers”. The reward of seeing someone smile when they got back their old toy- fully cleaned and given a brand new button nose- was worth it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This particular day, Harry was half-minding the shop as he worked on an old watch someone had brought in. Weekdays were normally slow and allowed Harry to focus and concentrate on more delicate tasks. Harry was shaken out of his concentration by the jingling of a bell. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi! Do you need any- oh, oh let me help you with that!” Harry set down his tools and jumped out from behind the counter to help the customer with the large box they seemed to be struggling with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope, no need, I just- let me, oh fuck it, thank you,” The man sighed as Harry grabbed half of the box and helped him bring it up to the counter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No problem, welcome to Potter Thrift! I’m Harry, how can I help you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, uh, I’m looking to sell this, well some of it, whatever you think you could sell here, it’s all my Great Aunt Hepzibah’s junk you see, she recently passed.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My condolences.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, it’s alright, she was a recluse, I didn’t even know I </span>
  <em>
    <span>had </span>
  </em>
  <span>a Great Aunt Hepzibah until we were contacted to clean out her place after she kicked the bucket.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry began to look through the box, it was, admittedly, mostly junk- certainly not things he could sell for a profit. There were a couple of pieces- a vintage pink dress, a silver hand-mirror, a couple of pieces that he could take apart for parts for other restorations, but upon first glance most of the box would not be a worthwhile investment for him.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Actually, she didn’t live far from here so your shop being here was extremely convenient. You know, her neighbors said she was crazy,” the man continued to ramble, “they say she talked about nothing. She was apparently extremely wealthy at one point in her life- but, well- she made bad investments, bought pointless things until she had no more room, and died. Most of her things are being auctioned off as-is in an estate sale but this er- well- we didn’t think...anyone else would want- I mean not of course, without some restoring first.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry I don’t take offense,” Harry smiled, “If nothing was considered junk I’d be out on a lot of my business. Tell you what, let me take this box to the back where I’ll go through it a bit more and I’ll come out and tell you what I’d be willing to take, yeah?” With a bit of effort, Harry carried the box to the back where he began to lay out some of the things he was interested in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He pulled out a pair of satin slippers that had definitely seen better days, in all honesty, they probably weren’t worth the time it would take to restore them. These slippers were obviously loved, they were probably poor Hepzibah’s favorites from how worn they were. In fact, so much of these items looked like they had been used everyday. It was likely these possessions had become some of the only things that gave her happiness after she was abandoned and alone. Turning the slippers in his hands, Harry wondered how she would feel knowing that her favorite things were considered worthless and discarded. Harry pulled out an old hand fan littered with holes and sighed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, did you find anything?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll take it all.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh Harry, I’m so glad to be able to see you,” Hermione said, her arms around Harry in a tight hug, “It’s been actual months! I can’t believe it was only two years ago that we wouldn’t go a day without seeing each other.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know Mione, how have you been? How’s law school?” Harry asked, hugging her back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, sometimes I don’t know why I signed myself up for even more years of schooling,” Hermione grumbled, “my life is consumed by studying.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know you secretly love it,” Harry teased as they sat down in their seats to enjoy their cups of coffee. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut up,” Hermione snapped, her smile betraying her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, how’s Ron?” Harry asked, drumming his fingers on the side of his coffee cup. Hermione’s smile slipped from her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s doing fine, you know, he asks about you too.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Does he now?” Harry mumbled, picking up his coffee to take a long sip. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s been almost a year Harry, don’t you think-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not the one who said that I didn’t understand </span>
  <em>
    <span>his </span>
  </em>
  <span>lifestyle.” Harry responded, the coffee now feeling too bitter on his tongue. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know he didn’t mean it like that Harry. He was upset you broke things off with Ginny, you know this. You know he doesn’t actually care that you’re gay. He just, it’s so easy for him to throw himself in school and he doesn’t see you every day now, so that’s why it’s been awkward for him to try to reach out- he’s sorry Harry, and he does miss you. I can tell.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll just take your word for it,” Harry took another sip of his too-bitter coffee and cleared his throat, changing the subject before Hermione could go on about his ex-best friend, “You know we should try to plan lunch with everyone from undergrad, it’s been so long since I’ve seen most of them, I’m sure it’s the same for you.” Harry glanced up to see Hermione staring at her coffee, her face set in a guilty frown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” Harry said after a moment of silence, “Right I guess not the same for you, well then-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry, I’m sorry! It’s just well, you know most of us go to the same university for graduate or law school and it’s fairly easy for us to meet up, we don’t mean to </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>invite you it’s just you’re on the other side of town and you run your shop and I-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay, I get it, different paths in life and all, it’s fine! I’m used to being the odd one out now,” Harry said, bringing his coffee up to his lips and chugging the rest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry, you know that’s now how any of us-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would you look at the time! I’m sorry Mione, I’ve gotta head out now I apologize, I bought a giant box of things that belonged to someone’s dead great aunt the other day and I’ve still yet to empty it so I should probably get a jump on that before the busy weekend. Text you later.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry!” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry knew it was unreasonable to be upset with Hermione, he knew that he had basically signed for this when he decided to not go through with his own law career. He knew that his friends probably still liked him, but it was just no longer convenient for them to see each other. However, it still hurt to know that they were having lunch and chatting with each other regularly when Harry’s contact was limited to a message checking in once every other week if he was lucky. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry pulled out a rusted old locket from the box of items and set it to the side- it felt heavy so it may just be worth something but it was too soon to tell. He’d need to clean it and appraise it under better lighting. At the very least, cutting his coffee date with Hermione short had gotten him through to the bottom of this box. Harry reached in and picked up the last item, a vintage metal oil lamp that looked as if it had come straight out of Aladdin. Unlike everything else in the box, the lamp appeared to be in decent condition, if just a little bit dusty. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Were you put here by accident?” Harry wondered aloud to himself. He picked up a dust cloth from a nearby table and began to wipe the lamp carefully. It was probably Harry’s overactive imagination, but it was almost as if the lamp was already warm in his hands. He grimaced as he caught a reflection of his puffy, watery eyes on the lamp’s surface. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“God, I’m a wreck,” Harry chuckled, tossing the cloth to the side, “I wish I wasn’t so lonely. Then maybe I wouldn’t cry over my friends having lunch without me all alone in the back of my shop.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry was interrupted by the familiar jingle of the door to the shop opening. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Looking for employment? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Here</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am. Is there something wrong?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man standing before Harry was extremely handsome. He had wavy brown hair was kept much more orderly than Harry’s own, and his warm, dark eyes sent small tingles down Harry’s spine. He looked to be about Harry’s age- possibly even older, which was surprising. This wasn’t the first time someone had asked Harry for some work- but it </span>
  <em>
    <span>was </span>
  </em>
  <span>the first time the person asking was someone his own age who looked like he had just gotten off a runway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, it’s just well, most of the people who ask me are teens looking to do odd jobs for quick money. You’re looking for full-time employment?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes. I was walking by and the place looked interesting, while I have no direct experience I’m sure I could be of some use to you,” The man smiled, charm seemed to ooze out of him, “I’d also just love to keep someone like you company during the day.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Harry blushed, “Well, I’d uh, I’d love to have you then! I can’t pay an extremely competitive rate though-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine, I have no need for money really, just work.” The words </span>
  <em>
    <span>with you</span>
  </em>
  <span> seemed implied by his gaze. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great, well then, welcome aboard, uhh-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tom Riddle.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tom Riddle was well, in a word- perfect. He learned quickly and worked to the best of his ability- though he highly preferred to work only in the back of the store, it freed up a lot of time for Harry to take care of the front of the store and other things- like marketing. Not only that, but Tom was intelligent, kind, and had a dry sense of humor that made him amazing company. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even after just a week and a half, Harry was feeling better, and it reflected in the shop- it was much more well organized, and in fact, sales had already gone up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was just one thing- Harry had developed a crush on the man. Despite his best efforts to the contrary, Tom was just so </span>
  <em>
    <span>attentive</span>
  </em>
  <span>. He listened to Harry with full attention and made Harry feel important- interesting, even! Harry knew there was a space between employee and employer that definitely did not include boyfriend or lover and he intended to keep it that way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, as Tom leaned forward, focusing on sewing up a re-stuffed teddy bear with careful precision Harry let himself smile and imagine for a second. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Tom, I see you let yourself in early again?” Harry asked. He had recently given Tom a key so he could come and go as he pleased the more projects he worked on. “You know, you don’t need to work yourself too hard, I need some work too.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Harry,” Tom smiled, “It’s no problem, there’s a project I’ve been </span>
  <em>
    <span>particularly </span>
  </em>
  <span>passionate about finishing, and I think I’ve finished it just now.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well then, what are you waiting for? Let me see!” Harry said, slinging a casual arm around Tom’s shoulder, “Is it one of ours or a client’s?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ours. The locket you’ve had sitting around that you haven’t had time to get to, yet, actually.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah I remembe- </span>
  <em>
    <span>whoa</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Harry gently picked up the locket from the table, ignoring Tom’s tensing as he did so. Harry understood being a bit protective over a big project. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The locket exceeded Harry’s expectations- it was a heavy golden locket with an ornate S shape inlaid with glimmering green stones. Harry’s brow furrowed as he inspected it, he had definitely not been expecting anything, well, </span>
  <em>
    <span>gold.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Interesting, I had thought the locket was rusted? Gold can’t rust,” Harry mumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, it was just in such a sorry state from how the last owner left it, it only appeared so. Essentially it’s been a glorified cleaning job.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm, I see, such a shame, this locket must be </span>
  <em>
    <span>ancient</span>
  </em>
  <span>, the craftsmanship is unlike anything I’ve seen. Quite frankly, it’s beautiful, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was an heirloom passed down, something like this. I don’t know, it’s like I can feel its importance. I honestly feel a bit uncomfortable appraising this for sale, maybe I can bring Hermione in to take a look. Oh, she’s a friend of mine and also a genius, she’d know if maybe we should donate it to a museum?” Harry placed the locket back down, intent on finding his phone and sending a picture to Hermione. It had been weeks since their coffee date and he was sure she’d be willing to help. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before he was able to even make a move, Tom picked up the locket in a fluid motion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Or</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Tom stressed, stepping close behind Harry, slipping the locket around his neck and leaning to whisper in Harry’s ear, “It can be our little secret for a bit.” Tom’s fingers gently brushed Harry’s neck after placing the locket on him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I- o-okay then, a secret,” Harry smiled, his cheeks flushed red. Tom hummed in approval and smiled at Harry, still close. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Looks good on you Harry, matches your eyes.” </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Hey has anyone heard from Harry recently? He’s basically gone MIA on all social media and I haven’t received a text back when I asked him how he was doing?” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Maybe he’s just taking some time for himself? From what Hermione told us he seemed pretty down when she saw him last.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I know we don’t talk a lot anymore, but he usually responds right away?” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I drove by his shop the other day- I couldn’t stop to say hi because I was running late for a meeting, it seems open and running fine at least, and he’s the only one who runs the thing.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Yeah, he’s probably fine and just busy, or needs time.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I miss him, hope he gets back in contact soon!” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The first time Tom had kissed him, Harry thought it must’ve been a mistake. It had been a brief pressing of the lips and surely, Harry had reasoned, Tom had just accidentally leaned in too close. When Tom pulled away, and continued with his day like usual, Harry was convinced that it was an accident- that or Tom actually came from a country where small pecks on the lips were customary and expected between friends? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The second time Tom had kissed him he pushed Harry up against a counter, sending a wooden model boat flying. He told Harry it was because he had overheard the last customer being a bit too flirty. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then there was a third, and a fourth time, and Harry felt as if he was floating. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Neville? Hey! I almost didn’t recognize you,” Harry pulled Neville into a hug, “Crazy running into you! Also, that was a lie, I totally recognized you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Glad to know you can still recognize faces,” Neville chuckled, “How have you been living life off the grid?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Off the grid?” Harry asked, “What do you mean?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, you haven’t exactly been the most responsive over the past two months, Harry.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, I guess time flies, right? I haven’t been purposefully not checking in I guess, just been enjoying life.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see, just make sure you take care of yourself.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I will Nev, you make sure you do the same! Tell them all I said hi next time you guys eat together,” Harry waved and continued down the grocery store aisle. Had it really been two months since he had last even texted any of them? Harry patted himself and realized he had left his cell phone at home, he’d make a note to check in and send them all a text when he got back. Right now, he had a dinner for Tom and him to plan. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Ran into Harry at the grocery store on the other side of town. He seemed distant? He didn’t even seem to think he’d been radio silent for so long. He claims he’s doing well and to tell everyone hi.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Well now that he saw you, he’ll definitely check in with the rest of us?” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Hah, we know he definitely won’t check in with </span>

  <b>

  </em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you thinking about?” Tom asked, one eyebrow raised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmm? Oh I ran into Neville a couple of days ago and I’m just remembering,” Harry sighed over a plate of spaghetti, “He said I’ve been MIA. Am I worrying my friends? Maybe I’ve been too into my work lately. What do you think?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tom paused for a moment, calculating, “I don’t know much about your friends.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’re wonderful people, I think you guys would get along great,” Harry smiled, “They’re busy a lot, but now so am I, so I get it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, your shop is open everyday and I’ve yet to see one visit. If they did, I’d be glad to meet them.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well you know, it’s difficult for them to make it to this side of town-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’re busy, but now so are you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I, yeah, now so am I,” Harry agreed, sighing once more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What I </span>
  <em>
    <span>think</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Tom said, moving next to Harry to press small kisses along his neck, “Is that we should take this very fancy, possibly priceless goblet I restored, drink a ton of wine out of it, then retire to the bedroom for the evening. Do you think you can fit that into your schedule?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll see if I can- </span>
  <em>
    <span>aah- </span>
  </em>
  <span>squeeze you in.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You never take these off,” Harry murmured, gently playing with the cuffs on Tom’s wrists. Until they had started sleeping together, Harry had never really noticed them. Tom was always dressed impeccably, so he assumed they had just always blended in. Even now against Tom’s bare skin, they seemed to almost belong there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mm, I guess you could say I’m attached to them dear,” Tom replied, pressing his lips to the top of Harry’s head, “They’ve been with me for so long, they’re practically a part of who I am.” Harry felt as if there was an unspoken humor lingering in the air. He brushed off the feeling and leaned into Tom’s chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What day is it today?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“September 18th, why dear?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“September 18th? September- oh god, it’s Hermione’s birthday tomorrow.” Harry immediately threw on a hat and collected his things, “I can’t believe- I usually shop in advance! We’ll close early today Tom and we’ll stay closed tomorrow! I have to find a gift! Do you know of any good books? Ah, nevermind I’ll ask the people at the bookstore.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What about our plans for tonight?” Tom’s arms were crossed, annoyance clearly written on his face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You mean the same plans we have every night?” Harry asked, laughing, “Rain check! I’ll see you in about thirty-six hours from now? Give or take a couple. Or you could come with me to Hermione’s birthday party and I can introduce you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No thanks,” Tom practically snarled, “I’ll see you in thirty-six hours then.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Harry fidgeted, “I’m sorry.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not fair Harry.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s not?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They have all had each other, they all still have each other. You can’t abandon me for them. All </span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> have is </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The way Tom’s eyes seemed to glow lingered in Harry’s mind the rest of the day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry!” Hermione almost sent Harry toppling with the force of her hug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey Mione! Happy Birthday!” Harry claimed, waving his wrapped gift in front of Hermione’s face. “You have to guess what it is before you open it!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmm, based on the presents I’ve been receiving for all the years I’ve known you, it’s probably a book.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow, lame,” Harry remarked, still smiling, “how do you guess it each and every time?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Luck I guess,” Hermione wrapped Harry in another hug, “I’ve missed you so terribly.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah yeah, I’ve been a bit hard to get a hold of and all that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A bit hard to get a hold of? Try nearly impossible, we’ve all been worried sick about you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry was suddenly aware of everyone at the party staring at him and Hermione and he could feel his face growing hot. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I mean, there was really no need I was just busy!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Busy for five months! With absolutely no form of communication beyond if we managed to run into you at the grocery store?” Hermione accused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My shop’s open from eight to five, have any of you thought of visiting me there? Or is my shop too embarrassing for you guys to step foot in?” Harry defended, his voice rising in volume. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry we’re all students on the other side of town-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So it’s okay for you all to be busy, but</span>
  <em>
    <span> I </span>
  </em>
  <span>can’t be busy?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mate.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry whipped around and spotted a very familiar redhead walking forward. Suddenly, all his anger was gone. He could only feel the need to get out before he started crying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Happy Birthday ‘Mione,” Harry mumbled, dropping the present he was carrying onto a table and walking out. And as much as he wanted to go back and hug his two best friends again, he didn’t- he felt like he couldn’t. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was practically a stranger, wasn’t he? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That night, as if sensing Harry needed him, Tom appeared at his door with a kiss. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m turning off my phone, is that unreasonable?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Darling I think it’s perfectly reasonable to remove yourself from harmful situations.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I miss my friends.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s natural to miss them, Harry. Do you want to talk to them? Even though none of them have come to visit?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No? I don’t know. It’s been a month, I’ve never been this upset over something like this before.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe it’s because you never allowed yourself to be this upset, dear. Afterall, you did always revolve around them.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I- yeah maybe you’re right. I’ll let them come to me if they want to talk.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tom, did you mean it when you said that all you had was me?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s just the truth. There’s only you, Harry.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>------------- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tom, I think all I have is you, too.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, thank you so much for your business,” Harry smiled, shaking the hand of the bar owner, “I’m glad I was able to finish the pieces on time.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am too, it’s great that we have these before Halloween tomorrow, it’s a big day for us.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure, if I can do anything else for you please don’t hesitate to contact me!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Harry was exiting the bar he was stopped by someone calling his name. Surprised, he turned around to be greeted by a slightly familiar face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heya Harry! Do you remember me?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi- were you a client of mine?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah! Although thinking back maybe I didn’t introduce myself. Zacharias Smith- I sold some of my great aunt Hepzibah’s things a while back- oh god has it been half a year already?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right! Yes, I remember now!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah hope you found some valuable things in there, I was surprised that you bought the whole lot.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well to tell the truth, not all of it has made it out to the floor yet- however there were a few articles of clothing that sold well, and a mirror,” Harry hesitated a bit as he tried to recall what he had pulled from the box months ago, “there’s also a lamp that hasn’t sold yet- but it didn’t require any sort of repair or cleaning beyond a dusting.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh that lamp! I had forgotten it was even there. Yeah, when we consulted my Aunt’s last living worker- named Hokey of all things, she insisted the lamp get thrown out- so it was the first thing we put in the junk pile- er- well sorry.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think I told you then, and I’ll tell you now, don’t worry about it, that’s my job,” Harry laughed, “Why’d the worker insist that the lamp get thrown out?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Something about it being cursed- apparently Hepzibah would talk to it all the time, even </span>
  <em>
    <span>named </span>
  </em>
  <span>the damn thing. Called it Tom Riddle.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>At first he couldn’t believe it- it was ridiculous, crazy even to think that Tom was- </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>But- six months and Harry had never seen Tom once work in the front of the shop. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Had Harry ever seen Tom outside of the shop or his own house? </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>But Tom was real, Harry had touched him, Harry had loved- </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>He needed to confront him, he needed to know the truth he needed to- </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tom,” Harry called, cradling the lamp in two hands, “Tom come here.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes dear?” When Tom saw the lamp his entire face morphed into something cruel- a shadow of the man he had loved- still loved. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can you explain?” Harry whispered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Clever, </span>
  <em>
    <span>special</span>
  </em>
  <span>, boy, you figured it out faster than that old bitch at least, it took her years to figure out the handsome, polite man who doted on her was bound by the lamp she had purchased and </span>
  <em>
    <span>left </span>
  </em>
  <span>in a dusty corner. And it took her years to use up her last two wishes,” Tom’s voice was cold and sharp and Harry found himself reeling from the stark contrast. They were completely different people. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I- you’re- a-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Haven’t I served you well? Weren’t you so lonely? They hurt you didn’t they?” Tom’s voice was mocking now, “They forgot you, but I didn’t. I never hurt you, I can’t hurt you. Sweet, sweet boy. Didn’t I go above and beyond?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>want-</span>
  </em>
  <span>” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh but I think you wanted all too much, didn’t you? You craved my touch from the moment you first met me. Hired a man with no resume or experience. You never once questioned where this man came from. Oh, but it wasn’t all your fault that you stayed so flustered and confused around me. You just love having my locket around your neck, don’t you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please, </span>
  <em>
    <span>stop</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Harry cried, slowly sinking to the floor. With one hand he reached up and pulled out the locket. What once felt special now felt heavy and ugly against his flesh. He wanted to rip it off, but he couldn’t bring himself to remove it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tom stalked forward and lifted Harry’s face to look at his. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have two more wishes, sweetheart. Use them wisely,” Tom cooed, wiping away Harry’s tears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I- I wish to know Tom Riddle’s true feelings towards me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Look at me.” Tom’s tone had turned warm and gentle once more and Harry couldn’t help but make eye-contact. His face had morphed back to the gentle expression that Harry was familiar with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tom, tell me. Was it all because I wished you- this whole time- you never even wanted-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shh, oh I’m sorry my special boy,” Tom kissed Harry slowly and sweetly, “My sweet dear. Mine.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tom?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re so good, so smart, so special,” Tom began to chuckle, “I thought you were upset that I wasn’t human- but you’re concerned about my </span>
  <em>
    <span>consent</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” A knowing look dawned on Tom’s face and his mouth stretched into a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tom, I-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll never leave you, as long as you keep the lamp that traps me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want you trapped, Tom, I- you’re all I </span>
  <em>
    <span>have</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry</span>
  </em>
  <span>, if you want to free me, you have one more wish.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>-------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello?” Two people walked into Potter Thrift. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry?” One called out, “Hey mate, it’s Ron.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And Hermione,” Another called out, “we’ve come to talk to you in person. Please come out? We miss you! We know Halloween’s always been rough for you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me, can I help you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who </span>
  <em>
    <span>are </span>
  </em>
  <span>you? Where’s Harry?” Ron questioned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m Tom Riddle, I run the store day-to-day now. Are you clients of Harry’s?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No we’re his frien- look we just need to talk to him, is he in?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Afraid not, won’t be in for a while, months perhaps.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Months?!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He went on a long extended vacation, completely unplugged, even refused to take his phone,” Tom Riddle picked up Harry’s phone behind the counter and waved it around, “Of course, I could take a message if you’d like and leave it for when he returns, though no promises on when exactly he’d return.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-,” Ron hesitated before being elbowed by Hermione, “Tell him that I’m sorry for being a prat. I really miss him, we all do. We were wrong. Tell him to call us when he’s ready?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, I’ll write down sincerest apologies from Ron and Hermione, was it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, thank you, we’ll get going now.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tom waited until they were out of the door to roll his eyes. From underneath the counter he pulled out the lamp and held it up to the light. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm sorry dear, I was hoping to let you be with me immediately, but it appears I may have some loose ends of yours to clean up. Don’t worry, I waited twenty-five years for you, you can wait a couple for me, right? It’s only fair dear.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>Tom set the lamp down on the table and propped his face on his hand. </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Halloween? That makes it exactly twenty-five years ago now that Hepzibah wished for the death of the Potter couple, but she didn’t say anything about their newborn baby.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tom laughed and rubbed his wrists. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were always mine.” </span>
