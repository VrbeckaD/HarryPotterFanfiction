    <p>Harry Potter was dead, and Ginny was finally starting to realize he wasn't coming back.</p><p>The Order meeting had been a haze. There were only a few people there- the ruins of what had once been, all tucked away in the flat above Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, when the news had come. Ron, bursting in bloodstained and battered had given the message. Harry Potter was dead.</p><p>And Lucius Malfoy had just proclaimed himself Minister of Magic. Finally, the purebloods were taking over. Now, all Order members were outlaws- wanted dead or alive for a reward issued by Lord Malfoy himself.</p><p>Ginny could not have been more confused.</p><p>Two hours, sixteen minutes, and thirty eight seconds ago, she had been happy, engaged, and free. She could have walked down Diagon Alley, with some danger, yes, but with Auror protection as well. But now, things had changed. There was no golden hero to unite the wizarding world together. Now, it was every man for himself. And every man was certainly looking for a little income boost in this great depression. Who wouldn't want that reward? Who wouldn't be willing to turn them in?</p><p>And Harry- her Harry, the Boy Who Lived, the man she was going to marry- was dead.</p><p>She couldn't even bring herself to cry. She just sat there- pale and pasty from shock, at the small kitchen table of Fred and George's flat, unable to move. There was no sobbing, no shouting, no wailing. There was nothing. Ginny was nothing. Harry was gone. Harry, who she had lived her life for since the age of ten, was gone.</p><p>She had always waited for him to return before. She had always been scared he would not come back. But somewhere, in the back of her head, she always knew he would.</p><p>Forget optimism.</p><p>Everyone around her was moving- packing, running, ready to go off into hiding. It was a mad rush and Ginny's feet would not work. They were coming, she knew that- the new Ministry, the purebloods- the Death Eaters. They were about to arrive. And Ginny would have waited for them- waited for them to come and to end the awful nothingness she felt. She wasn't even sad or angry or upset. She was just... nothing.</p><p>And she would have died as nothing, if not for the cool hand she felt on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione had been in the back with Fred and George, working on her latest Wolfsbane batch as the twins worked on whatever it was they felt the need to invent or perfect that night. She could hear the meeting outside the room, in the small kitchen.</p><p>The door to the flat had burst open, demanding her attention regardless of the potion at hand. She peeked out of the door, one hand holding her wand while the other remained over the cauldron, about to add the third to last ingredient. It was Ron. Just the sight of him made her drop the entire bottle into the cauldron, which caused a miniature emergency that thankfully Fred had been so watchful of as to dispose of before it got out of hand. She mumbled a thanks to him as they all three moved through the doorway and into the kitchen.</p><p>The news that followed was something Hermione had come to fear for years. Ron was beside himself, bloody and beaten. As silent tears instantly fell from her eyes, she slowly turned to look at Ginny. They had been engaged, something she knew Ginny had dreamed of ever since she was eleven years old.</p><p>Her hand came up to her mouth as she tried to calm herself down. Fred gave her a short hug before joining his brother in helping Ron. Remus stood and left the room, there really was no telling where he was going. He had lost more than anyone now. The pain was immense, yes, but somehow the knowledge that she knew it was going to happen sooner or later seemed to numb her pain a bit. Slowly, she attempted to calm herself and walked to stand behind Ginny.</p><p>She placed her hand on the other girl's shoulder, and to her surprise she was not crying or shaking like Hermione was. She took a deep, shaky breath.</p><p>"Ginny?"</p><p> </p><p>Ginny didn't have to look up to know who it was. She could identify Hermione's voice easily, even as it shook. The hand on her shoulder felt strangely foreign, almost as if it was a sort of chilly air rather than flesh and blood. It snapped her back and she looked up to see what was really happening- Ron bleeding into Fred's arms, and George throwing everything of note into a thick sack as fast as he could.</p><p>The realization came harsher than Ginny would have liked. She turned her head back to Hermione.</p><p>“We're fucked," she said bluntly, looking up at the shivering girl. The red head could hear the words echoing in her head. We're fucked. It was true. Harry was gone. And who would save her now?</p><p>She had always depended on Harry to take care of her. In a way, everyone had depended on Harry. What a sick joke this was. Maybe this was punishment for being selfish, for wearing the poor man down. Maybe it was a way to teach them all, you could only really depend on yourself.</p><p>And nobody but Ginny could save herself from the purebloods about to come knocking on that door.</p><p>She had the sudden urge to scream, but bit it back. Now was not the time. She had to get out of there. Abruptly, Ginny stood, heading towards the hall closet where she had hung her cloak. She had to get out, and now. And she was going to, right as she pulled out her grey cloak, but she saw Hermione's next to hers. The red head looked back to the older girl, still shaken from the news.</p><p>Ginny could leave, could get out right now and was sure to be safe though she had no idea where to go. She could finally depend on herself for once and maybe that was the best idea. But looking at Hermione and back on that cloak, Ginny had a feeling it wasn't.</p><p>Fred and George could take care of Ron- Ginny knew that, but they were too flustered to take Hermione with them. She couldn't just leave her on her own, could she? It wasn't like Hermione wasn't a capable witch. She was better than Ginny by far. Surely she could fend for herself.</p><p>But something told Ginny that two witches were better than one, especially when one of them was Hermione.</p><p>A sudden stab of wanting hit her. Oh, how Ginny wished Harry was here. He always knew what to do. And finally the water appeared behind her eyes, but she blinked it back.</p><p>What would Harry have her do?</p><p>She threw the cloak to the girl, "Know anywhere we can go?"</p><p> </p><p>She looked from Ginny to Fred and George, then to Ron, who was not even registering much of anything at that point. Hermione opened her mouth to speak, but it was too late. Remus had gone, the twins were with Ron, and Ginny was.. what was Ginny doing? Her blurry vision managed to find the younger girl, who was tossing a cloak at her. That's right, they had to leave. But where?</p><p>"N-no… I mean, well, no, I don't... Where should we-?" But before Hermione could finish her sentence, the front door was blasted open, sending chunks of wood flying into the room that connected directly to the kitchen. Wand in hand, she lunged forward, placing herself directly in front of Ginny. Two dark figures stalked into the flat, advancing quickly on the two girls. Hermione began backtracking through the kitchen door into the back room she had been in with the twins before Ron had shown up. She sent two or three well-placed hexes in their attacker's direction only to have them blocked perfectly, before they even got close. Her eyes grew wide as realization hit her.</p><p>"It's him- go, quickly!" Hermione turned and pushed the other girl along, though she knew it was too late. No spell she could throw would ever reach that man. They had failed. She grabbed Ginny's arm as the two made their desperate attempt at escaping. Damn the anti-apparition wards. In the sudden insanity, she had no time to concentrate on trying to remove them.</p><p> </p><p>The bigger of the two men bared his teeth as he blocked the hexes sent his way, watching as the two girls scrambled to escape. With an expression of supreme confidence, he cast 'Stupefy' at the retreating figures. While it would be a shame if they missed out on the rest of the group, these two alone would make the operation worthwhile once caught- and he had no doubt.</p><p> </p><p>Draco fell in behind Severus, the man's figure and skill protecting him from any hexes thrown their way as they advanced on the two girls. He had hoped to catch Ron at least, but these two were more than adequate, especially the younger one... Oh, how she had frustrated him at Hogwarts. He smirked behind his hood as Severus sent hexes flying at the girls as they tried to escape to no avail.</p><p> </p><p>The blast had thrown Ginny off and she had not yet recovered. Had Hermione not been there, the red head was entirely sure she would not be still around.</p><p>Blindly, she followed Hermione through the flat, jumping out of the way as the bushy haired girl threw curses at their attackers. All of them failed. Suddenly a great fear started creeping over Ginny. She was scared- horribly, horribly scared because if Hermione couldn't hurt these wizards, who could?</p><p>As the first tears streamed down her face, she sent a curse- the only curse she could think of- over her shoulder- a Bat Bogey Hex at the second figure. She didn't know why she did it. There really was no use and she knew that. Again, it was artfully blocked.</p><p>
  <em>It’s him- go, quickly!</em>
</p><p>Ginny felt Hermione's hand over her wrist and pulled forward, moving as quickly as she could behind the older girl, "Who-?" Ginny said frantically, looking back to make out the figures, but Hermione only tugged her harder. As they turned the corner, a curse hit, shattering the plaster and Ginny shut her eyes. When she opened them again, they were in the backroom. It was a dead end.</p><p>Ginny looked frantically around for something- anything, to help them escape. Sofa? Lamp? Dungbombs? There was one sitting on the coffee table and Ginny grabbed it in her hands, reminding herself to hug Fred and George next time she saw them- that is, if she saw them again.</p><p>"Hermione," she said hurriedly, trying to get the girl's attention and holding up the distraction. "I'll drop it. If we can just get to the window-" She looked to the paned glass across the room. Hopefully, they could get out of it somehow. It looked like their only hope.</p><p>Again, she wished Harry was here.</p><p>She saw them coming into the room, and she threw down the bomb, putrid odor invading her nostrils. With Hermione in tow, she felt her way through the stench, hoping to make it to the window. It was too late, however, as she saw a second curse soaring their way. Ginny screamed, feeling the brunt of the spell hit her, and then collapsing onto Hermione as she fought to maintain consciousness.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione couldn't help the scream that left her throat as she was sent flying to the ground face first, Ginny landing on top of her roughly. She squirmed underneath the younger girl, struggling to get her back behind her as she herself tried desperately to get to her feet as the two dark figures closed in on them.</p><p>"No!" She covered Ginny with her arms and turned her face away from their attackers. It was over.</p><p> </p><p>The bigger of the two cast a spell to clear off the horrid odor of the bomb as he spotted the girls on the floor. He sneered as he threw Hermione away from Ginny- none too gently. "Watch these while I check the rest of the House."</p><p>He rushed out of the room soon after to try to catch any others who might still be around.</p><p> </p><p>"Right."</p><p>Draco rushed the two girls, first turning his wand to Granger as he placed his foot harshly on the younger girl's frame, keeping her to the floor. "Incarcerous!" Thick ropes appeared around Hermione- binding her tightly, keeping her arms and legs together as she tossed her body around on the floor. Draco laughed at the sight and held his left hand out, summoning her wand to him. He then turned to Ginny as he pocketed Granger's wand, his eyes shining under his hood with excitement.</p><p>"Your turn. Incarcerous!" Again, ropes were conjured out of thin air, binding the girl underneath his foot painfully as he took her wand as well. He smirked down at them both, his eyes lingering on the red-head before looking up and around him for Snape.</p><p> </p><p>The fall had left Ginny disoriented and barely able to move as she felt a whole stash of bruises beginning to form. Her vision was in two, and when she finally regained some sight, she was not pleased with what she saw. Hermione bound tightly and flailing at the hands of a hooded figure.</p><p>The red head sat up quickly, more tears pouring down her cheeks and she began to search for the wand she had lost in her fall, but there was barely any time to think before she felt harsh cords tighten around her arms and legs, pulling her back down to the ground with a shriek. Blindly, she fought the ties, twisting and writhing under their grip, but to no avail. They would not loosen. Tears streamed faster down her cheeks, but she would not give up. She had to get loose. She had to take care of herself. Harry was gone now. He was gone.. He wasn't going to burst in and save the day like he always did. He was dead. She had to take care of herself. She had to.</p><p>The red head pulled harder at her wrists, making cuts and scratches in a ring, and sobbing. She had to take care of herself. She had to.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione watched as Ginny was bound as well. Where had Snape gone? She looked around wildly, until the voice of the second set in. Her skin grew hot with anger, not terror. She looked up at the second, eyes defiant and wild.</p><p>"You pathetic, cowardly little brat!!" Her voice broke in mid-yell, and she looked back to Ginny. "It's Malfoy! And the other-" Her words were interrupted by none other than Severus Snape returning to the room. She tried to back away on the floor, but she could barely move with as tight as Draco had made the ropes.</p><p> </p><p>"The rest have gone," Snape said to Draco as he approached the two sitting on the floor- well, lying really. "Well well, Miss Granger, Miss Weasley. One might think the two of you might have done better in Apparition class. Or in the very least, at lowering wards effectively." He grabbed each one by the hair in turn to check for injuries briefly before stepping back. "Then you might not have found yourselves in this situation."</p><p>He turned to Draco then, a sly smile creeping across his face. "It would appear we have prisoners, Draco. Should we keep them, or kill them?"</p><p> </p><p>Draco eyed Granger while Severus checked them, wanting nothing more than to curse the hell out of her and be done with it. When Severus spoke, he turned his eyes to the older man with curiosity.</p><p>"Ah, we have a choice?" His eyes fell back on Granger, then to Ginny where they remained for quite some time before he answered. "Let's keep them, for a bit at least." He looked back at the other man as he pushed his hood back, revealing himself to the two girls proudly.</p><p>"One each, then?"</p><p> </p><p>Ginny's eyes widened as the hood dropped back. Snape and- and Malfoy? Ginny could feel the terror rising in her chest, making her nauseous. This was too much. There was no escape and yet she still looked to the door. Where was Harry?</p><p>She could feel Malfoy's eyes on her, arrogant and proud- like a predator. Her brown ones turned away, willing herself not to look at the man. She remembered him all too well from school- the teasing and the duels. Malfoys had never gotten along with Weasleys and the boy was finally getting his revenge.</p><p>'One each, then?' She had almost shuddered.</p><p>Suddenly, the stakes were higher. This wasn't about her hair color or her last name anymore. This was about a man, who at this moment had complete control over the situation, and like hell she would let him win. Like hell.</p><p>"You bastard," she hissed, eyes meeting, "I'd rather choke on my own vomit."</p><p> </p><p>Hermione looked from Malfoy to Snape, her eyes wide with fear and confusion. Ginny's voice snapped her attention, causing her fear to double when she heard what the girl had said.</p><p>"Ginny, stop it!" It was no time to be proud, not with Snape back in the room. Not with him in control of everything, in control of their very lives. She had started to shake, the ropes tightening slowly around her body as she continued to try backing away from the dark man that stood over her. It wasn't Draco she was afraid of. She could handle the snot, given the opportunity. It was the man she had no chance at all of ever besting that she was cowering underneath. Slowly, she turned her gaze from Snape to Malfoy.</p><p>"What do you mean by that...?”</p><p> </p><p>Oh, this was too rich. "What's this? The know-it-all cannot decipher a simple statement?" With a flick of his wand (and an unspoken spell) he lifted her to a standing position, though her feet didn't quite touch the floor. "Allow me to clarify the situation for you. The both of you are now prisoners of war, OUR prisoners to be specific. As such, we may either kill you or keep you." He glanced over at Draco before continuing. "Likely you will be killed eventually, but for now perhaps some entertainment might be in order."</p><p>He grabbed Hermione by the hair and pulled her head back as he looked at her. "Oh yes, I believe there are things you have left to learn, Miss Granger; things about pain tolerance and the human body. I believe I would enjoy teaching that to you."</p><p> </p><p>Draco laughed as Hermione asked him what he meant, letting Severus answer her. The way he was treating the mudblood excited him.</p><p>"I take it you'd like her, then. That's perfect, I was hoping to get this one anyways." He reached down and drug the red-headed girl by the collar of her clothes to her knees before him. He then moved his hand to her neck, his thumb rubbing roughly against her soft skin. He continued to smirk down at the girl in his grasp. "This'll be fun."</p><p>With another laugh, he looked back toward Snape. "Where to now? Should we report these two to Father first?"</p><p> </p><p>Ginny felt her heart thumping in her ears as Snape lifted Hermione off the ground. The look on his face was repulsive and the things Ginny assumed he had in mind were repulsive as well. Hermione was a human being, not something to be won and used.</p><p>"Let her go!" Ginny heard herself shouting desperately, unable to dwell on what was in store for the both of them. She was ignored.</p><p>‘I take it you'd like her, then. That's perfect, I was hoping to get this one anyways.’</p><p>Her head twisted back to Draco, looking up at the smug man. Her heart felt like it had fallen into the pit of her stomach and though she hated it, two tears glided down her cheeks.</p><p>He pulled her into his grip before him and Ginny almost threw up. The wave of sickness she felt would not go away. His hand against her skin felt wrong and rough and she was sure she was going to be sick all over him. But she swallowed back the vomit as it rose in her throat.</p><p>‘Where to now? Should we report these two to Father first?’</p><p>Lucius Malfoy... the name shook in her brain and Ginny was filled with dread. She had come into contact with him many times before- and though they were few and far between, they were entirely unpleasant. She thought back to the Department of Mysteries and then, to her first year in Diagon Alley, and shivered. She did not want to meet that man again- certainly not like this, certainly not ever.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s world had crumbled and dissolved right before her eyes. Less than an hour ago, she had been making Wolfsbane for Remus with Fred and George as a slow meeting took place in the next room. And Harry had been alive..</p><p>She tossed her head back and forth, attempting to break free of the dark man's grasp. It was of course no use.</p><p>'Oh yes, I believe there are things you have left to learn, Miss Granger; things about pain tolerance and the human body. I believe I would enjoy teaching that to you.'</p><p>If she hadn't been shaking before, she certainly was after his words sank in. With Mafloy distracted by Ginny, her ropes had loosened a bit. With great effort she called on the last bit of pride and strength she had and tried to kick at Snape. The toe of her shoe barely met with his knee. It was useless. A grunt of frustration left her throat as she brought her eyes down to his.</p><p>"You won't be 'teaching' me anything, you pathetic man." Though no telling how short-lived it would be, her pride and bravery had been restored.</p><p> </p><p>He considered Draco's question. "We should report them, soon. When we have them secured, not before. We will send word then." As the last word left his lips Hermione's foot nearly contacted his leg in a vain attempt at kicking him.</p><p>"Oh yes, fight, I do so love a challenge," he hissed as he silenced her with a spell. "While I have every intention of hearing your voice plead with me, I don't want to hear it just yet. In time, you shall see just how pathetic this man is not."</p><p> </p><p>Draco's attention was caught when Granger tried kicking Severus. He had been letting the ropes on the mudblood go a bit slack. He immediately jerked his wand toward her, tightening the ropes more than ever.</p><p>"Alright. The Manor, or did you have someplace else in mind?"</p><p>He could feel the girl in his grip begin to shake, and something wet fell to the top of his hand that was around her neck. He glanced down to see a tear, one on his skin and one still on her cheek. It was gorgeous.</p><p> </p><p>All color had left Ginny’s cheeks and she felt cold under his grip. She prayed Snape would leave Hermione alone. That was something the red head would gag to think about.</p><p>‘Alright. The Manor, or did you have someplace else in mind?’</p><p>He was looking down at her again and even though she was frightened, and even though she was scared, Ginny felt the rush of hatred growing in her chest. He looked so smug, so regal standing above her and she couldn't take it. She wanted to stop crying. She wanted to show him she didn't care what he did to her or anyone else. She wanted to show him she was fine.</p><p>But she wasn't.</p><p>She was still crying and she was still shaking and all she wanted to do was scream and bite his fingers away, but she wasn't in the position to do that. So she did the next best thing; she spat right into his face.</p><p>"Go to hell," she said, trying to sound fierce or at least like someone to be dealt with, but her voice came out high pitched and frail, cracking from her crying. There was another surge of tears, but she fought them away. She was fine. He had to see she was fine.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione tossed her head to the side, away from her captor's face. She couldn't look at him, not now. Her own tears began to well up again, and she wasn't as strong as Ginny at holding them back. Her lips mouthed a name, but no sound came out. As such, her sobs were hidden and so she let the tears fall freely. She had failed Harry, and Ginny, and Ron. She had failed everyone, including herself.</p><p> </p><p>"No, I have another place in mind. If we bring them to the Manor, your father might wish to be involved." Snape wiped a tear from Hermione's face and looked at it glisten on his fingertip for a moment before shaking it off. "No, I do not feel like sharing, I am a selfish man after all. What you do with yours is, of course, your decision. I have the perfect place in my home for this one."</p><p>He grabbed her chin and forced her to look at him, his eyes matching his expression: cold and calculating. "You will be quite comfortable there, won't you?" he asked, knowing that she would deny it if only she could. "Yes, you will. I assure you of that."</p><p>He turned and faced Draco, who seemed rather pleased with his. "I suggest we leave before they return in force."</p><p> </p><p>Draco slapped the defiant girl with the back of his hand, then wiped the spit from his face. Snape's voice broke his concentration on the red-head, for the time being.</p><p>"Right. Father will leave her to me if I tell him to, so I am taking her to the Manor."</p><p>Draco eyed Granger, a wicked smirk crossing his face as Snape spoke to her. "I will tell Father you have captured Granger. Oh, and have fun.. I know I will." He then turned to Ginny and began dragging her through the flat. Once outside, he pulled her up to him in a half standing, half leaning position with his left arm tightly around her rope-bound body. "We're going to have a lot of fun, you and me," he purred into her ear before closing his eyes and Disapparating them both to the Manor.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione watched as Snape’s dark eyes were forced onto hers. Once he had finished speaking, she closed her eyes tight and swallowed. Everything had gone so terribly wrong. Had they thought to take the anti-apparition wards down so they could leave... But Hermione had been too busy worrying about the hexes Snape was sending their way, and protecting Ginny.</p><p>Hermione turned her head and watched helplessly as her friend was drug out of the room. She screamed silently for the girl, threatening Malfoy if he dared hurt her. Her threats were empty and unheard. Slowly, she looked back at Snape, then closed her eyes tight and tried one more time to kick him, wiggle out of the ropes binding her, anything.</p><p> </p><p>Her despair was lovely, addictive even. "What was that, Miss Granger? Ahh yes, you cannot speak, can you?" He moved away from her as she struggled to kick him yet again. "You will settle, or I will hex you to stillness," he threatened as he took hold of her bindings. "You don't want to make it worse for yourself, do you?"</p><p>He pulled her closer and looked at her, the fear in her intoxicating. "I believe I can understand Dementors a bit more," he said softly as he watched her.</p><p>"Come now, we leave." He held her to him tightly as they Apparated away.</p>
