    <p align="center">Chapter 1: The Misunderstanding</p><p>Her nipples scraped against the stone wall with every thrust of the powerful wizard behind her. His strong hand wrapped around her neck, pressing her face into the wall and cutting off most of her air supply. The sensation of rough stone on her tender nipples, calloused fingers around her throat and hip, and a large cock jack hammering in and out of her warm, wet cunt combined with her oxygen-deprivation-induced euphoria to send her screaming into an orgasm so strong her quim strangled the dark wizard’s cock.</p><p>                The man thrust through her contractions, hitting her cervix with each impaling and that special spot inside that made her see stars with each retreat. He pounded through her orgasm, his hand leaving her throat to roughly grasp one perky nipple, brutally twisting at the same time that he mimicked the action on her clit. She came again in a tidal wave of sensation, whimpering and keening like a wounded animal. And still he thrust.</p><p>                His fingers plucked, pulled and pinched her nipples while their brothers slid through her nether lips, squicking through her thick juices, circling her clit, and spreading her lips wide. And all the while his thick, long prick continued to pound and pound and pound with no sign of stopping. Her pussy was dripping and so swollen it was like thrusting into a fist. She was so overwhelmed with sensation, chafed raw by his attention, and exhausted from her orgasms that she just wanted to sleep, or cry, or both. She wanted to come again, could feel it building, but her previous orgasms made it almost impossible for her. She was so oversensitive that each stroke of his fingers sent electric jolts through her body and each pump of his hips made her cry out in pleasure and pain. If she didn’t get relief soon, she felt she might die.</p><p>                The wizard removed his fingers from her breast and replaced the ones at her cunt, which he quickly brought around to her backside, rimming her puckered hole before sliding deep, two at a time, her own juices lubricating his way. She cried out and whimpered in protest but still he persisted, thrusting his fingers in and out of her anus in counterpane to the thrust of his cock while flicking her clit and ramming his dick deep inside her. She broke, thrashing her limbs, screaming, crying, begging him to stop, begging him not to stop, her muscles clenching so tight that the man had to finally stop thrusting because he literally was caught in a vice.</p><p>                The milking of her cunt finally sent the man over the edge and he came deep inside her with a low groan and one final flick of her clit, dragging her down with him. When he could catch his breath, he pulled roughly out of her, watching his semen, tinged pink from the strength of his thrusts, slowly slide down her creamy thigh. Her knees buckled and he let her fall to them, palms braced against the wall and head bent, her ragged breathing shaking her small body.</p><p>A flick of his wand and he was clean and dressed, staring at the petite naked body crouched on his office floor. Finally, after what seemed an eternity, the witch looked up, an exhausted but thoroughly satisfied look on her face. A look she lost when she saw him clean, clothed and completely, coldly composed.</p><p>“Was it what you expected?” the wizard asked. “Did it fulfill your fantasy? Was it brutal enough for you?”</p><p>“What?” she asked. “Brutal enough? Expectations? What are you…”</p><p>“Don’t play coy,” he snapped. “You wanted to fuck a Death Eater and so you did. If I was too gentle, I could give it another go but you will need to give me some time. I am too old for ten minute refractory periods. Perhaps you should have asked the younger Mr. Malfoy.”</p><p>“I didn’t…that’s not…what?” The witch seemed thoroughly confused, though that could be attributed to the fact that she had her brains fucked out just a moment ago.</p><p>“You didn’t what? Enjoy it? My cock begs to differ. If you had come any harder you might have. Snapped. It. Off. You certainly weren’t protesting,” drawled the wizard in a deep baritone that, even after 3 orgasms, made the witch shiver. The wizard noticed and smirked. “Ah, yes, you did seem to enjoy what I had to say. Tell me, Miss Granger, was it when I called you a <em>filthy mudblood whore </em>or when I asked if you <em>liked being fucked by my Death Eater cock</em> that got you off that last time?”</p><p>Hermione was so dazed she didn’t seem to notice that she was still kneeling, naked at his feet. She couldn’t believe what he was saying to her. She knew he had been talking to her while they…did that, but she was too lost in sensation to pay attention to his actual words. Just the silky, deep tone had penetrated her lust filled brain.</p><p>“I didn’t hear any of that. I didn’t know what you were saying. I don’t know what you’re saying now,” she insisted.</p><p>“The resident know-it-all is confessing to not knowing something? I find that hard to believe. You certainly responded well enough to my words just moments ago. “</p><p>Hermione was finally coming out of her daze. She didn’t quite understand what was going on, but she knew enough to reach for her wand in order to clean and dress. The wizard was having none of that, though. He snatched her wand away and stowed it in his robes.</p><p>“I didn’t say I was through with you, Miss Granger. You wanted a Death Eater, and I think I might just want to deliver. I like you naked at my feet. Maybe I’ll put a collar on you and show all my Death Eater friends my new pet.”</p><p>“Stop saying that! Why do you keep saying that? You’re not a Death Eater!” Hermione shouted, muscles still too weak to stand upon. “I didn’t want to fuck a Death Eater. I just wanted to be with <em>you</em>, you insufferable bastard! God, it wasn’t what you said that got me off; it was your voice alone. I’ve fantasized about your voice since 5<sup>th</sup> year, Professor. It wasn’t being fucked by a Death Eater; it was being claimed by you, being filled with you, being surrounded and consumed by you!”</p><p>“Do not patronize me, Miss Granger,” Snape sneered. “I’m twice your age, mean and ugly. I’m not some dark hero for you to worship. I’m… just… dark.”</p><p>“That isn’t true. You’ve always tried to protect us. Anything you’ve done was for the greater good. You are a brilliant wizard and a good man,” Hermione insisted.</p><p>“You are too old to be so naïve,” Snape snarled. “A good man wouldn’t have taken a 17 year old witch against a dungeon wall. A good man would have politely declined your offer of ‘a way to stop thinking’, I think you called it, and sent you on your way. I am not good, Miss Granger, and you would do well to remember tonight and accept it as the lesson it was meant to be.”</p><p>“And what should I have learned?” Hermione asked. She knelt at his feet still, nothing covering her nudity except Gryffindor bravery and righteous indignation, which she allowed to bolster her to her feet. “That you are a man, with the needs of a man? Did you think I didn’t already know that? Why then would I have sought you out, propositioned you? I not only knew it, I was counting on it.”</p><p>Hermione stepped closer to the man who had terrorized her and her friends for 6 years, meeting his eyes head on and not stopping until she was so close she had to tilt her head back to maintain the eye contact. Snape, of course, stood his ground, glaring down at her as though she were one of the dunderheads in his classroom, one misstep away from blowing up a cauldron.</p><p>“And furthermore, I’m 19. Time turner in third year. And I’m pretty sure the war I just fought gains me at least another decade in experience! Now, if you are done trying to intimidate me, I’ll take my wand and my dignity and see myself out.”</p><p>Snape held tight to the witch’s wand, aware that she was quite adept at spells and quick with a hex. He let his eyes wander, noticing other admirable qualities about the petite witch before him. Her hair was still a riot of curls and her face plain, but charming with its smattering of freckles and big hazel eyes. She had a delicate neck, long and slender with a perfect, purple hand print just under her jaw. She had lost weight the previous year and had not gained it all back, making her wide hips seem even curvier than they were, hips that were bruised from his fingers. Her breasts were small and tipped with dusky brown nipples, somewhat red and chafed from their rough treatment at his hands and the stone wall. Her legs were long for someone so small, knees scraped from her fall to the floor. All told, she looked well fucked. He felt himself begin to harden once more.</p><p>“No,” he stated simply.</p><p>“No?” Hermione wasn’t sure she understood. “No, what?”</p><p>“You will not be leaving just yet. On your knees, Miss Granger,” Snape commanded.</p><p>“Excuse me? I don’t think I heard you correctly. It sounded like you were holding me hostage and commanding me to kneel like a dog.” Hermione’s hair sparked with her magic.</p><p>Snape was very interested in the way her eyes narrowed, shooting daggers at him, and her face began to redden. Her passion was definitely a turn on. If she wanted him so badly, who was he to deny her? He would give her what she wanted but didn’t know she was asking for.</p><p>“You claim you want me, so shall you have me. On. Your. Knees. Now,” he growled. He took notice of the change in her breathing, the rise and fall of her chest speeding up, and the pulse beating heavily in her neck.</p><p>“So you can call me a whore again? I think not, sir. My wand, if you please,” she said haughtily, hand out expectantly.</p><p>Snape surprised her by grabbing her by the hand, spinning her away from him, and shoving her down to her knees with a well placed hand on the back of her neck. He smirked as he smelled her renewed arousal. It appeared that Miss Granger enjoyed his manhandling very much.</p><p>“Put your cheek against the floor and your hands behind your back,” he commanded softly, yet firmly. He knew she was going to deny him and make it difficult, and was looking forward to the confrontation.</p><p>“Fuck you,” Hermione spat, attempting to regain her feet.</p><p>“Oh, you will,” Snape purred. “Do as I say, witch, or you will not like the consequences.”</p><p>“Fuck. You.”</p><p>Snape chuckled darkly before using an <em>incarcerous</em> with precision to bind Hermione’s hands together behind her back, leaving a length of rope free like a reign, which he used to slow her momentum as he shoved her down to the ground until her right cheek lay flush with the cold stones and her delectable ass, red from his hips, was up in the air, cunt on full display. Snape did not fail to notice her glistening folds or the thick smell of arousal permeating the room.</p><p>“My, my, Miss Granger, but you do like it rough. Look at your pretty pussy dripping with my come,” he drawled, sliding two fingers deep into her waiting channel and gathering some of their combined juices. “But I’ve already dipped my wick, so to speak. Now, for those consequences, Miss Granger. After all, I am a good man and a good man keeps his word.”</p><p>Without further ado, he dragged his fingers, liberally coated with her arousal and his own spunk, out of her slick heat and up to her puckered hole. Hermione’s back stiffened and she attempted to raise her head but Snape held her firmly down by the neck. His wet fingers rimmed her rosette, occasionally returning to gather more lubrication. Snape made sure he thrust deep and curled his fingers on the way out so that in mere minutes he had Hermione whimpering and arching her ass towards his hands.</p><p>When she felt she couldn’t take another minute of his ministrations, Snape suddenly buried one of his long fingers knuckle deep in her ass. She hissed at the burning stretch but was so far gone that she didn’t protest his sudden intrusion. He began to steadily thrust his finger into her tight passage, his words doing just as much as his fingers to bring her closer to release.</p><p>“When properly prepared, anal sex can be quite pleasurable. I can make you beg for it, Miss Granger. I can have you riding the edge of bliss for hours, until your body only knows my touch, the thrust of my cock, and will forever compare all other lovers to me and find. Them. Lacking.”</p><p>“Please,” Hermione whimpered. “Please, please, please.”</p><p>“Would you like more, Miss Granger?” Snape asked benignly. He added a second finger quickly followed by a third. “You were so stunned when I did this before, I was sure that you had never been taken this way. You are taking to it quite well, my dear.” He withdrew his fingers completely and smirked as he watched her roll her hips, seeking his touch. “Tell me, do you want my cock in your delectable little ass, Miss Granger? Do you want your greasy old professor to fuck you in this tight little hole?”</p><p>Hermione moaned, a breathy sound that ended in a grunt as Snape thrust deeply into her dripping quim, having magically removed his clothing once more. Her walls instantly clamped down onto his hard length, reluctant to let go now that she was finally filled.</p><p>“Tut, tut, none of that. I’m just getting wet,” Snape chastised before pulling out and positioning himself at her virgin hole. He grabbed the extra length of rope, wrapping it around his hand and pulling tight, causing Hermione’s back to arch almost painfully. Without warning he thrust his full length into her, relishing the tight squeeze around his cock and the high pitched scream that left the witch’s mouth. He stilled just until he felt her relax a bit around him and then he started thrusting, pulling slowly out but ramming powerfully back in, as deep as he could go. He loved the animalistic grunts his pounding thrusts were dragging out of the witch.</p><p>Snape could see the skin of Hermione’s wrists chafing raw so he shifted his grip to her bushy brown curls, changing the angle of his thrusts. Hermione’s grunts turned to one long, continuous moan as the new angle hit a spot that made her vision go white. She was going to come soon. All the signs were there. As much as Snape wanted to finish inside the witch, he wanted to prove his point more. So he slowed his thrusts, until he was barely moving at all, bringing her body down from the precipice.</p><p>“I told you there would be consequences for your defiance,” Snape growled. He caught the barest whisper and leaned over the nubile body beneath him to listen more closely.</p><p>“Please, please, please. I’m sorry. Please. I’m sorry. I’m sorry,” the witch begged. “I need…I can’t…please, please.”</p><p>“You beg so prettily, Miss Granger,” Snape purred in her ear, grinning when he felt her entire body shudder. “Use your words, dear. What do you want?”</p><p>“Please, god, please, please, please,” Hermione whimpered. She wanted to move. She wanted him to move.</p><p>“Your. Words. Miss. Granger,” Snape insisted, thrusting shallowly in time with his words. “If you don’t tell me what you want, right now, I shall remove myself from your sweet little body and leave you here, your pretty cunt grasping at nothing, desperately seeking release. Talk.”</p><p>“Move,” Hermione pleaded. “I want you to move. Please.”</p><p>“Like this, Miss Granger?” Snape asked as he thrust shallowly and slowly.</p><p>“Deeper,” she moaned.</p><p>Maintaining his snail’s pace, Snape thrust all the way in, pulled out, and pushed all the way back in again. “Is this what you wanted?”</p><p>“Faster, please, god, faster, please,” she keened.</p><p>Snape increased his pace but kept his movements limited to a gentle undulation. He used his grip on Hermione’s hair to turn her head to the side so he could look at her face, smirking in satisfaction at her blown pupils and the perfect O of her Cupid ’s bow lips. Her skin was flushed pink and sweat curled the baby hairs along her forehead. Her fingers were twitching against his stomach from their position behind her back and her thighs were trembling against his own. He removed his hand from her hip and brought it up to gently roll her nipple between his fingers, watching as her eyes rolled in bliss.</p><p>“Do you like that, Miss Granger? Is this what you <em>need</em>?” Snape asked, his voice little more than a growl.</p><p>“Harder, please, fuck me harder, sir,” Hermione responded. “Oh, god, I’m so close.”</p><p>In response, Snape abruptly stopped all motion, nearly coming himself at the needy, desperate sound his witch made. Suddenly he wanted to see her. He wanted to watch her face as she toppled over the edge. He wanted to see her breasts bounce as he pounded her into the floor and feel her legs wrapped around him. Decision made, he pulled out of her, released the <em>incarcerous</em> silently and wandlessly, and flipped her onto her back.</p><p>“I want you to watch me, Miss Granger,” he commanded. “I want to see you fall off that edge and know that your ugly old professor is the one who tipped you over. Lift your legs and wrap them around my waist.”</p><p>“I can’t. I’m sorry. I can’t,” Hermione cried. She weakly tried to move her limbs but didn’t have the strength to do so.</p><p>Snape hooked his elbows under both knees, spreading Hermione wide open and rolling her body until he had her where he wanted her. He sat back on his heels, hauled her closer, and slammed his rigid cock into her waiting hole. He enjoyed the stunned look that crossed Hermione’s face, eyes widening and jaw falling open in a silent scream.</p><p>“You wanted faster, deeper, harder,” Snape hissed, “and so you shall have it. Brace yourself.” And with that he began. His thrusts were nearly brutal, hitting deeper in the new position, and Hermione’s breasts did in fact bounce in time to his pounding. “I won’t stop this time, Miss Granger. I am going to fuck your ass until you scream and then I’m going to come all over your pink little pussy. You will not clean yourself before tomorrow night. I want you to wear my scent, my mark, all day so you remember who this cunt and this ass belong to. Now, scream for me, pet.”</p><p>Hermione screamed as her orgasm ripped through her. Her body went completely stiff as if she had been hit with a <em>petrificus totalis</em>, back bowing, neck arching back, hands clawing at the stone floor. Her inner walls clenched painfully around nothing and her back passage clamped so tightly around Snape’s stiff cock that he could barely move. He pulled out, dropped Hermione’s legs to the floor, and wrapped one elegant hand around his cock, jacking up and down three, four, five times and coming in thick, ropey strands over her pussy lips, burning the image of the pearlescent liquid on her swollen, red cunt into his mind.</p><p>                They both remained as they were, panting heavily, until Snape regained his composure enough to speak. “That is what you get from me, Miss Granger. That is the man you think you want. I tolerate no defiance, no disobedience. I command your pleasure. You come when I say, whenever I say. If not, there are consequences, even punishments. If you do as instructed, follow the rules, there are rewards. Think about what I’ve said. If this is amenable to you, come to me as instructed tomorrow. If not, by all means, make use of the bath through that door and be gone.”</p><p>                He gracefully got back to his feet and retreated to his private chambers through a secondary door, leaving her wand on the desk, her clothes on the chair, and her body sprawled and broken on the floor, the decision hers to make. She slowly regained her feet, dressed and walked through the door and out into the hallway. She wasn’t sure if her blissed out, weakened muscles would make it back to Gryffindor Tower, but she was damned sure not making a stop in the baths on the way there. She would wear his mark and she would return the following evening for her reward.</p>
