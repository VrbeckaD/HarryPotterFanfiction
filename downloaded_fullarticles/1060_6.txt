          <div class="userstuff"><p>Contrary to her title as International Muggle-Wizard Relations Analyst, Hermione had yet to leave the U.K. this year. Her position was mainly based in a small often forgotten ministry office and consisted of running qualitative and quantitative studies on a variety of topics and helping write grants and policies to break down prejudice towards muggles, muggleborns and those of mixed magical heritage. </p><p>Her first major push had been developing a plan for a more robust program to integrate muggleborn children between the ages of 8-11 into the magical world prior to attending wizarding schools. The data she had gathered on the first and seventh year experiences of muggleborn children without proper guidance into the magical world had been profound and had echoed her own experiences of isolation and loneliness.</p><p>When making the case to a board of potential donors in September she had shared that muggleborn children were 80% more likely to experience feelings of loneliness in year one of schooling than other children,  40% of year one students reported that their parents were uncomfortable with their child's newly realized abilities and had grown more distant and by their 7th year, muggleborn students were 10% more likely to drop out of school than their peers. </p><p>Her one attempt at making this meeting more fancy had been the snickerdoodle cookies she had made that morning. Unfortunately, she had no refreshments except for lemonade to offer the group of donors as her purple ½ inch high heel had caused her to trip on the way in spilling all the cookies on the floor and raising her skirt up passed her bum. Luckily she had been 30 minutes early and no one had seen. She dusted herself off the floor, pulled down her purple and black dress, straightened her black suit jacket, tucked her hair behind her ears and pointed her wand at the cookies and plate making them disappear. No one would be the wiser. She took a calming breath and tried to reel in the nerves she felt pounding in her chest.</p><p>The board of donors consisted largely of pure bloods or those of mixed blood origin of middle age and extraordinary wealth. There was however one man sitting to the side of the group in a navy suit and robe set who at 28 could hardly be considered old. Hermione had frowned upon seeing her former nemesis sitting there smirking at her as she worked through one of the most important speeches of her career. He was infuriatingly handsome and she watched as he rubbed his light blond stubble as though he was in deep thought. Perhaps he was showing off that he could now *attempt* to grow a beard. Hermione almost laughed thinking of why the boy who had always tormented her about her heritage would decide to come and listen to her proposal on integrating 8-11 year old muggleborns into a society ruled by families like the malfoys who would look down on them for being different.</p><p>In the back of her mind she knew this particular Malfoy had only shown signs in the last 10 years that he regretted his role in the war, his inaction, and his family's blood purist views, but as Hermione knew too well the back of the mind could be a dangerous place to dwell. She had after all argued for his record to be expunged after the final battle. She had been successful but he had never mentioned it to her.</p><p>She faced the group of men in fancy suits and luxurious robes and fiddled with the bottom button on her black suit jacket before starting in on her plan proposal.</p><p>"... I have personally come to know that bigotry has lasting consequences in the development of a muggleborn child. Although I would wish for no muggleborn child to hear the slurs I heard, we can't control that".</p><p>Draco shifted in his seat but Hermione could still feel his gaze hot on her neck.</p><p>Hermione took a shallow breath and continued, "I therefore propose the following plan to integrate 8-11 year old muggleborns into our world prior to the start of wizarding school. This will allow a more gradual and less shocking experience for both the child and the parents. In addition it should decrease levels of social isolation and loneliness upon entry into school at 11."</p><p>She didn't dare look at Malfoy and her eyes landed on American Headmaster of Ilvermony Mr. Zhao. He smiled at her encouragingly.</p><p>"The plan has 6 parts:</p><p>1. The headmaster and someone from the wizarding community that has agreed to act as a mentor will meet with the family and child to inform them about their magic.<br/>
2. The child will be sent three non fiction books about magic. I recommend, "Somehow I Magic: A Diary of a Muggleborn", "Quidditch through the Ages" and a book about the school that they would attend, for example "Hogwarts a History". The parents and the child will also be given a worksheet to help them discuss the books together.<br/>
3. The Mentor will take the child to visit a magical neighborhood for shopping and help the child convert muggle currency to magical currency. At this time the child should be encouraged to buy an owl to support magical communication.<br/>
4. The Mentor should attend dinner at the Muggleborns home or the family should attend dinner at the mentors home. At least one other magical person should be invited.<br/>
5. The mentor should take the child and parents school supply shopping. The family will pay for the supplies.<br/>
6. The Headmaster and Mentor will check in with the child during the first month of the school year"</p><p> Hermione ended her speech. As she looked around the room she saw that multiple people in the audience were walking towards her to pledge money. The money began coming in from about half of of those in attendance. 10,000 galleons from Mr. Zhao, 5,000 from the representative of Abbott labs, 8,000 from Monsieur Leblanc and  4,000 from Mr. Greengrass. Hermione smiled and wrote down the amounts in her leger book. A total of 25,000 galleons had been pledged. This was enough money to sustain 10 years of programming for new muggleborns at Beauxbatons, Hogwarts and Illvermony.</p><p>The donors began leaving the conference room and Hermione gathered her pledge receipts and presentation items into her tan briefcase. It had been a successful night she mused. She tried to swallow down the disappointment that she had failed to persuade Malfoy into donating but her disappointment was short lived. As she swung the strap of her briefcase over her shoulder and started moving to the door, Draco Malfoy was blocking the exit by leaving against the door frame.</p><p>"Hey Granger, well done" he raised an eyebrow at her and then made a show of glancing at the briefcase holding the pledges.</p><p>"Malfoy, why are you even here? This type of presentation seems hardly your scene and I don't appreciate your sarcasm" she snapped.</p><p>"Well a large part of Malfoy Inc. is philanthropy and I heard there would be cookies. Pity there wasn't any" he quipped. The look in eyes was rather more knowing than Hermione would have liked. Had he arrived early and witnessed her fall? </p><p>Hermiones face stained red as a blush overtook her. He winked. That was not the reaction she was hoping for. She wanted to ask if he had seen her underwear but the rational part of her luckily one out as she said </p><p>"Not all meetings have cookies, sometimes the content of a proposal such as the one I just gave is important enough for donors to attend on it's own right"!</p><p>She attempted a haughty gaze that she hoped would end the conversation and let her pass through so that she could leave and begin analyzing why he was at her presentation from the privacy of her own bedroom. </p><p>"Okay, Golden Girl. Too right you are… as usual" the last part was muttered.</p><p>His hand dipped into his pants pocket of his dress pants and Hermiones attention followed. Her checks flushed even more and a new wave of warmth hit her a little lower than before. As her mind began to drift, his hand came out of his pocket holding a muggle check. He handed it to her, raised his eyebrows and smirked.</p><p>"Don't spend this all in one place. I'll be in touch, the only stipulation is that I want to be one of the mentors. I can be unpaid. I have plenty of money to support a kid". He looked unsure of himself for the first time in years and she noticed his cheeks were pink too. He looked down and began walking toward the door.</p><p>As he left the room, he turned back tapping his fingers on the door frame to say in an almost casual tone "I'll owl you, tomorrow".</p><p>Once he was gone, Hermione looked down at the folded check. It was for the muggle equivalent of $100,000.00 galleons.</p></div>
