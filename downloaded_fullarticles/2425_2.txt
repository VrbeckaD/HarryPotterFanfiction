    <p>Somewhere in the Scottish countryside in a cave sat a witch. Observers from a distance might have noticed that she seemed a bit large and bulky compared to the average witch but would likely have shrugged it off until they got closer. She was sitting in the middle of the cave floor on what appeared to be a pink fluffy carpet that closer inspection would have shown she was weaving by hand even as she sat. If an onlooker was paying more attention, several even more incongruous things would have caught their attention. For example, the walls of the cave were coved in strange and vaguely…organic instruments that seemed to be made of the roots of trees and were studded with gems and strange metal loops. These instruments all seemed silent, yet they possessed a very foreboding air about them, and one got a sense that silent was the best way for them to be. An observer might also have noticed that the wool she was weaving was appearing out of thin air as strands of soft, multi-coloured light were being twisted together to create an endless supply of simple pink wool about 2 feet from the edge of the rug.</p><p> The witch got up and moved to the back of the cave out of view, and a keen observer might have wondered how she had disappeared from a small cave with one chamber. A really keen and Paranoid observer might have wondered why she seemed to cock her head and listen to something before disappearing, and indeed would have been wise to do so, as both the woman and the cave were clearly very strange. However, the observer in this case was a small Scottish girl called Joanna McMoore, and she had wandered away from her parents while hiking in the Scottish Highlands. Stumbling upon the cave as she searched for them, she was fascinated. She was prone to exploring new places and hadn’t been away from her parents long enough to panic, perhaps because she was so engrossed in the cave it hadn’t occurred to her she was lost yet. Suddenly she heard a pop and the witch was standing behind her looking exasperated, though her face quickly became kind and she spoke.</p><p>“Hello there, what are you doing here? “</p><p>Joanna thought her voice was very deep, but she was too young to understand why that would be. Anyway, the witch seemed nice, if a little awkward at the sudden presence of a six-year-old girl in an unplottable cave guarding an ancient secret, not that Joanna knew that last part. She smiled and said, “Hi, I wandered away from Mummy and Daddy and I was looking for them, do you know where they’ve gone? I saw your magic yarn it’s very pretty. Mummy says I shouldn’t talk about magic because Daddy isn’t magical, and we have to keep it secret, but you’re magic so its ok to tell you right?” This came out in something of a breathless babble.  The nice witch smiled ruefully and put a hand to her brow. Lots of adults did this when she talked, she thought it was just an adult thing.</p><p>“Ok Joanna, I’m going to bring your Mummy here to you ok? Just stand still a moment” came the gentle reply. The witch closed her eyes for a moment and a look of concentration appeared on her face, before there was a brilliant flash of light and her mother was standing there looking very bewildered, with the witch behind her.</p><p>“Joanna McMoore! What are you doing here? You know not to wander off! How did I get here?! Explain yourself!” came the parental tirade from the irate mother. The strange witch behind her mother watched all this with a very amused expression on her face, and Joanna giggled as she caught her eye. Her mother began to say something no doubt to scold her, but suddenly realised where she was looking and whirled around, eyes widening in shock as she took in the appearance of the stranger. Like her daughter, she immediately recognised that they were magical, though being an adult with a magical education she realised at once something that her daughter didn’t. Her eyes just boggled  at the stranger and Joanna wondered what was wrong with her mummy.</p><p>The amused look on the stranger’s face didn’t lift as she glanced at Joanna for a second and then said cryptically, “Yes, I'm real, we exist. We aren’t myths, just very secretive. This place is a secret, but not to worry, you won’t be able to find it again once you leave.” Her mummy looked taken aback and then thoughtful but nodded without a word and took Joanna’s hand. The nice witch looked down at her again and said, “It was nice to meet you, Joanna. If you find yourself at Hogwarts when you’re older, perhaps we will meet again. I have been meaning to spend a few years there.  Don’t go exploring strange mountains on your own again, ok?” Beside Joanna her mother breathed a sigh of relief at the innocent explanation of what happened, and the witch cocked an eyebrow at her with a look that was both understanding but also irritated. Her mother looked a bit abashed at her unspoken accusation.</p><p>“Bye, stranger lady!” Joanna said enthusiastically, getting another amused look as the witch raised her arms and Joanna and her mother disappeared in another flash of light.</p><p>Shaking her head, the witch disappeared and then reappeared in her cave with a smile on her face, the sudden appearance of the two strangers having brightened her day. But the smile drained as she noticed several of the instruments blinking at once, and she felt it. It was just as described by the elders, a sickening sensation ran through her and her magic recoiled in disgust at the touch on the world, unnatural, profane magic and dark, so dark. She frantically conjured up a map of the United Kingdom and saw a dot winking in the south.</p><p>“The ministry of magic?!” she paused, watching.  “Harry potter, oh no..” she breathed.</p><p>Her magic swelled within her, bursting forth as she removed all of her self-imposed bindings, and the dark, sickening sensation was beaten back by the presence of her own magic, as she concentrated and disappeared with a pop.</p>
