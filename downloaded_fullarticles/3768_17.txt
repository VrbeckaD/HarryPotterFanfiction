    <p>-Flash Back-</p><p>I just got home from my friend Ali's house. I walked out of the fireplace and herd ear bleeding screams coming from the kitchen. I walked to the kitchen and did not believe what I saw, I saw my mom and my little sister Amber laying on the ground dead, the kitchen tiles that used to be gray were now stained by blood. I looked into my father's eyes and stared to cry. I kneeled besides my mom and my sister and broke down. I thought the Crouch family was just a normal Pure blood family, but I guess I was wrong. I got up and collected myself and sprinted into the living room and called the police and reported a murder. It did not take long for them to come, I could only see my dad being dragged away and him yelling at me, "IF THEY ASK YOU ANYTHING, I AM INNOCENT, I AM INNOCENT!"''</p><p>-End of flashback-</p><p>I woke up crying, I wiped the tears away and walked to my closet and put on some clothes and walked downstairs.</p><p>I was living with my aunt, uncle and my taribull cosens. As I was walking downstairs someone almost pushed me over the railing. I took him by his collar, looked them in there face and yelled, "DON'T DO THAT, OR YOU WILL BE THE ONE FALLING TO YOUR DEATH!"</p><p>he nodded in fear and went to get breakfast.</p><p>"Rachel honey you got a letter", my aunt said.</p><p>A letter, no one sends me letters?</p><p>I took it out of her hand and opened it.</p><p>Dear, Rachel Crouch</p><p>We are pleased to inform you that you have a place at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.
