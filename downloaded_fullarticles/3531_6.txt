  <b><em>Unfair</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry Potter aged eleven is very well aware that life is unfair. He lost his parents before he ever really knew them and was unceremoniously dumped on his Xenophobic relative's doorstep with only a note, A poorly written one at that, to explain why. It doesn't have to be said that the last ten years with them where something close to a living hell for the boy. While they rarely ever hit him or physically abused the boy, Harry is aware that they hated him with all their hearts. Then along came the letter, The one that made hope rise for the first time in a long time in the child. He had been so happy upon learning about magic. He was not a freak and his parents had loved him more than life itself!</p><p> </p><p>For a small while everything was looking up for the poor boy until it all came crashing down. Harry was a smart child you see, he had to be living with the Dursleys and having to avoid being unduly punished for every little thing that went wrong. So the moment when everyone turned on him and Hermione for the drastic point loss (Which was rather unusual for just being caught out of bounds after curfew, Harry had looked it up after everything was said and done.)  He had known that nothing was really all that different from the mundane world. The magically inclined where just as opposed to seeing anything they didn't like as the muggle ones where. So when Professor McGonagall ignored the trios attempts to tell her that the stone was in danger Harry was not particularly surprised nor was he when it was decided to go after who they thought was Snape (Though something rang false about that).</p><p> </p><p>Harry was upset though that Hermione would not leave him on his own. While it was true that he had sent Hedwig on ahead with a note to Dumbledore about the likely theft of the stone he wanted the only true friend he ever had out of the range of what he was beginning to suspect was a setup. For who though, the thief or Harry himself he did not know. However, the girl was having none of it and insisted on following him through the flames and into the last chamber.</p><p> </p><p>Let it be said that Harry was only mildly surprised that it was Quirrell after the stone and not Snape. Snape while a nasty petty man was likely not in the habit of murdering children, despite what Nevil thought to the contrary. Quirrell, on the other hand, Harry had caught glaring at several children during class with murderous intent, Him included.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort in the back of the man's head, however, was a nasty surprise.  </p><p> </p><p>Now like earlier stated Harry Potter was indeed aware that life was ridiculously unfair. He knew the moment that Voldemort raised his wand at him that he was rather unlikely to live to see the next day and was well prepared for that when Hermione, Dear sweet bookish Hermione pushed him out of the way of the curse meant for him and was blasted with a rather sickly light that almost immediately caused deep fatal gashes to open up the front of her torso splattering red blood around the room. Harry watched shocked as his only friend's body hit the floor, as she had been dead before she had even known it. He barely registered the mocking laughter of the Dark Wizard in the room as he stared unblinkingly at the dark dead brown eyes of his best friend.</p><p> </p><p>It was perhaps simply too much for Harry and in that instant, his very magic rebelled against the thought of her being dead. Unknowingly Voldemort had just sealed his fate, for as he laughed and mocked the boy for his loss Harry’s magic tore through several bindings that had been placed on him.</p><p> </p><p>Now the thing about binding another's magic is this: It is simply not done. Even death is preferable to binding someone's magic. Magic is in its own way sentient and responds to ones will only when it particularly wants to or the person using it has the right amount of willpower. This is why first years are only able to do simple things with magic as they usually do not have the power nor the will to do anything more than rather basic spells. This is also why children below eleven have what they call accidental magic or more accurately Wish Magic.</p><p> </p><p>Now binding someone else's magic can and likely will harm them in the long run even if it is by a marginal amount of there overall power. Dumbledore despite knowing this deliberately placed several such blocks on Harry’s magical core before he deposited him on his Aunts doorstep. Now on a normal Wizard, this would have bound the boys power up quite well, Though he also would have likely become a Squib by the time he was Eleven. Harry Potter, however, was a rather powerful child even at the tender age of one and so it only made him have a normal amount for a fairly powerful Wizard.</p><p> </p><p>The really bad thing about all this, however, is the fact that under enough stress, like say watching your first true friend (Not glorified tagalong like rabid glory hound Ronald Wesley was) be murdered, would likely cause the magic of the person to lash out violently and snap all the bounds at once. That was the bad thing for it would kill the person who was bound and vaporize just about everything within a certain distance depending on how powerful the person was.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was apparently powerful enough that he leveled everything in about a hundred yard radius around him.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore, when he arrived later, would pale at the sheer amount of destruction that had happened. He would also be thankful that the chamber he had chosen was quite far down and well away from any particularly populated parts of the castle. He would be even more glad to find that Ronald Weasley was alive though unconscious just outside the blast radius.</p><p> </p><p>And so Harry Potter died that night along with his faithful friend Hermione Granger taking her killer with him as he went. However, that was not the end of Harry’s story.</p><p> </p><p>For he lived again once more and so to did she.</p>
