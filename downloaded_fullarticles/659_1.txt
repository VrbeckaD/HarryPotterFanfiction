<p align="center">
  <strong>Chapter 1</strong>
</p>
<p>Cold.</p>
<p>That was how Ron would describe his office. It was the was dead of summer and yet it felt as though someone had cast a freezing spell in his office. Life had not gone the way he had imagined it. The fiery redhead sat at his desk, writing reports and tending to the work that nulled his brain more and more with each file piled on his desk. He had already finished twenty backlogged reports of dark artifacts found or criminals hidden deep in the wizarding world’s underground circuit. Still, it was all work that had to be done.</p>
<p>Ron closed the file, putting it in the completed file before he continued, reading another file. <strong><em>Case # 07-5-101912-3</em></strong>. Before even opening the file, Ron had examined the case of the number. The first two numbers indicated the year of the case, and the second number indicated the type of file. In this case, this particular file was from the year 2007, and the case was adoption/paternity. As head of the Auror department, Ron could have easily claimed this as a misfiling of cases and had it sent back to the file-jockeys. Sometimes with magic, things could have gotten mixed up. However, as Ron opened the file, he felt his heart stop.</p>
<p>This was Harry Potter’s file. </p>
<p>There were some days in which Ron couldn’t sleep because of what had happened that night five years ago. His best friend had been murdered. Many suspected his husband, Draco Malfoy, of committing the crime. Those days had been dark, and Ron had never wished for anything simpler than blaming it on the most likely of suspects. However, after extensive interrogation and the willingness of Malfoy to endure an arrange of tests to prove his innocence, that’s all it did; proved he was innocent.</p>
<p>Ron almost closed the file out of automatic reaction alone; being reminded of the painful reminder of his best friend was gone was the last thing he needed. He didn’t though, he read the file only for a few additional pages having been added to the file.</p>
<p>
  <em>A child was found.</em>
</p>
<p>There were additional file reports that had been recently been added: <strong><em>Case File #12-5-283418-5 </em></strong><em>Child found on the scene of the suicide scene. Held in temporary custody until further evaluation before placement of custody of the Department of Magical Children Welfare. </em><em>Under magical law, genetic testing was given once the child was in custody of the magical law enforcement along with health examinations. Recent health reports have found that the child found at the scene has a 99.9% chance of a genetic match to one Harry James Potter as the maternal parent. </em></p>
<p>Ron's eyes re-read the report at least a dozen times to make sure he was reading it correctly. There was photo evidence of the scene where the child had been found.</p>
<p><em>Based on reports of underaged magic, ministry workers found the child hiding under a bed located in presuming her bedroom. The body of the deceased has been identified as Lavender Brown. </em> <em>The child who self-identified herself as “Aster” appears to be around five years old and found in Woodbridge, United Kingdom. Communication with the child has been difficult as she has refused to speak since being taken in by custody. </em> <em>Reaching out to potential family members have proven to be a failure since and no one has claimed custody of the girl. She has been sent to magical foster care under the guardianship of Cynthia and Martin Gilbert. </em></p>
<p>Ron picked up a particular photograph. This was a school photo that had been added to the file, more than likely found at the crime scene and placed into evidence at one point, and he felt as though he was looking at a ghost.</p>
<p>This child resembled Draco <em>and</em> Harry.</p>
<p>Her hair was blonde, a more natural toned than the platinum and silvery locks that Draco had, but she had his grey eyes. Though her nose, chin, and even ears belonged to Harry. Even her eye shape had come from Harry. The girl even had Harry’s smile.</p>
<p>Ron leaned back as he looked at the photo, and a smile appeared on his face, along with tears in his icy blue eyes. She was found; his best mate’s child was found. He covered his mouth and shut his eyes, feeling a sense of relief that could finally be put to rest.</p>
<p><em>She’s been found Harry; your daughter has finally been found. </em> </p>
<hr/>
<p>Draco Malfoy tried his hardest to be a single parent. Many nights were lonely, but he was okay and so were his boys. Just as the moon calls forth the howls of wolves, so does Draco feel the call of pain just as naturally. In truth, he had given up hope of finding peace in his heart. He hid from the world that wanted nothing more than to tear him apart from the past that his family had caused and endured. Not for his protection, but for his sons.</p>
<p>James Sirius Malfoy and Corvus Hyperion Malfoy.</p>
<p>James was the eldest child born to Harry and Draco, a surprised but very welcomed member of the family. One who had curly blonde locks and Harry’s eyes. And Corvus, who was just as much of a surprise but very welcomed, with Harry’s raven black hair and Draco’s eyes. Two handsome young men who carried the Malfoy name and blood. Their third would have been welcomed with open arms, but when Draco had returned home to the horror of his husband’s death, he soon accused of committing such a crime.</p>
<p>Hidden from the majority of the world, deep in the pre-Pyrenees foothills known as Corbières Massif, Draco raised his boys in secret, all because he was frightened of what would happen next. He didn’t want to lose his sons to the wolves who hunted them down like prey. </p>
<p>“Okay boys, it’s time to do some reading,” Draco announced as he shouted to the boys who were flying around on their broomsticks. James, being almost eleven years old, was the first to look down and see his father on the ground. He looked over to his younger brother, eight-year-old Corvus, and shouted to him, “Race ya down!” James leaned down on his broomstick, heading back toward the ground as Corvus was just getting his bearings on the broom. The raven-haired boy soon leaned down, following his brother and knew that James would beat him. So much like many younger siblings, he pouted, “No fair! You had a head start!” Corvus yelled as he landed.</p>
<p>James smirked and said, “so what?”</p>
<p>“So that’s cheating!” Corvus declared.</p>
<p>“Now boys, play nice,” Draco chided, “now go put your brooms away in the shed and get cleaned up for dinner.”</p>
<p>James got off his broom and handed it to Corvus, “you know the rules, loser puts the brooms away,” he said and marched inside once Corvus held his broom in his hand. The boy pouted and began to drag his feet as he took the brooms, shoving them into the shed that was several yards away. The boy only knew the beauty of nature that surrounded his home. He had been told many times to avoid people, especially when he was alone. He never understood why, and soon he would be all alone. Soon, James would be going to Beauxbatons academy, the closest wizarding school near them and not even Draco could hide his son from attending a magical school.</p>
<p>Corvus headed back inside the house, a place Draco had constructed solely for the purpose of hiding away from the house. The house was adequate, enough to raise two sons in, and there were a few family portraits on the wall from Draco’s side of the family. Though the newest portrait that was added to the family had been commissioned around seven years ago, sometime after Corvus had just been born and they were all a happy family. Draco often found himself staring at the portrait on the wall, more longing for the time before than anything else. Draco was tending to the studies of his boys, making sure they kept up their reading. Wizarding children often had private tutors before their time in Hogwarts, but Draco had opted to educate his boys on his own. The last thing he wanted was some nosey tutor asking questions he rather not answer.</p>
<p>James would soon start wizarding education, and while Draco would have held him back and continue to homeschool himself, he knew James eventually needed to experience the world for himself. Though making his son attend Hogwarts seemed rather cruel and it was too far from where they lived. Draco didn’t want his son to go to the school where students would know his name and be judged for being a Malfoy. Beauxbatons seemed to be the ideal choice.</p>
<p>“Hey Dad! When do I go to school?” James asked excitedly. Draco looked at the calendar, “same as the other students, September first.” Draco’s eyes went dull for a moment. That was the anniversary of Harry’s death. He remembered because he had taken the boys out to go see Teddy, their Godbrother and cousin, out to the Hogwarts train. Corvus got up and decided to get something from the kitchen. The kitchen was small, with an island in the middle that held the sink and magical self-cleaning items along with other contraptions working away automatically. Corvus went to the fridge and pulled out a slice of cheese. Draco looked over and went over, “no Corey! No cheese! Dinner will be served in about an hour!” Draco said as the boy had a bad habit of grabbing slices of cheese and filling up on that rather than the food. The boy pouted and looked over to see some meat in the oven and asked, “is it goat again?”</p>
<p>“No, It’s lamb!” Draco answered with a similar attitude as the boy gave him. Corvus shrugged as he liked lamb and went back to sit down. Draco watched over his soon who were soon reading quietly and knew the peace only lasted for so long. He went to the over and began checking on the meat and begin getting the side dishes ready for dinner as well. The blonde had changed a lot since his days at Hogwarts. He began thinking about his memories as his at Hogwarts, but he when he did that, he thought about his beloved and his smile vanished. Someone took him away and he can’t be brought back. Someone hurt his family and they haven’t been found yet.</p>
<p>And he knew he would never get justice for Harry’s murder.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Ron floo home as normal and he coughed a bit of the dust that had been entered in his mouth. “Daddy!” A red-haired girl who had been waiting for him jumped up and smiled happily. Rose. His baby girl. Ron smiled as soon as he saw her and once he stepped out of the fireplace, she ran over to him and hugged him. Ron lifted her up and hugged his daughter close, “how is my little Rosebud doing tonight?” He asked. “You shouldn’t be up this late anyway, not with school coming up!”</p>
<p>“I know Daddy but I just couldn’t sleep without here!” She said. The girl was about seven years old, with red curly locks and big doe-like eyes. “Papa has been busy with the babies today so he went night-night early,” Rose pouted. Ron smiled softly and picked up the girl, “okay baby girl, let’s not bother him then, especially if the twins are finally calmed down enough and are beginning to sleep into the night,” Ron said and carried the girl through the house adorned in loving family photos.</p>
<p>Ron carried the girl upstairs and took her to the room that had a cursive “R” on the door. Ron walked in the room adorned with purple walls and the finest furniture available in the wizarding world. Ron sat down as he laid his daughter down, and she got under her green blanket sheets, giggling. “You need to go to sleep young lady!” Ron smiled softly and kissed her forehead. She looked at her dad and asked, “when will I develop my magic Daddy?”</p>
<p>“Your magic? Why are you concerned with that?” Ron asked, a little surprised.</p>
<p>“I read that young witches and wizards have bouts of magic as babies and toddlers, but I don’t remember if that’s ever happened with me,” Rose admitted.</p>
<p>“It has, trust me,” Ron assured. “You changed one of your Papa’s robes from purple to orange and he was not happy about that.”</p>
<p>“I did? It doesn’t sound like something I would do,” the tone of her voice reminded Ron so much of Hermione and that gave him such a warm nostalgic smile. “That’s because you were about six months old and I don’t think you could ever remember something like that,” Ron answered. Rose was Ron and Blaise’s child, but her birth mother was Hermione. It was an agreement they made and when that happened, Ron also agreed to become a sperm donor for her’s and Pansy Parkinson’s child, who was their son Hugo, born two years after Roseanna Blair Weasley-Zabini had been born. Though this was before they had an accident magical pregnancy and Ron had carried two beautiful babies, Wylla and Zoella Weasley-Zabini (taking maternity leave for that was very awkward for the Head of the Aurors). Ron had actually only recently returned from maternity leave, which was why he had such a large workload on his desk.</p>
<p>Roseanna pulled out her favorite book from under her pillow and held it out, “can you read it to me, Daddy?”</p>
<p>Ron yawned a bit, rubbing an eye, “I don’t know Rosie, you can read much better than I can at the moment, so why don’t you read it to me instead?” He suggested playfully. Rose nodded enthusiastically and opened the book, reading aloud, <em>“A Gold Star for Zog!” </em>Ron sat close to his daughter and listened as she read very well for her age until she began going quiet and fell asleep, sleeping just shy of the book's end. Ron leaned down and kissed his daughter’s forehead before slowly getting up and moving the blanket over her shoulders, tucking her in.</p>
<p>Ron went to step outside of the room and headed to the nursery for a moment, quietly checking on the twin girls. The babies were fraternal twins, and while one twin looked a lot like Ron, the other looked identical to Blaise. Wylla, the red-haired with pale skin like milk and freckles like paint splashes across her face, was the terror of the twins, slept in a light green onesie with a pacifier in her mouth. Zoella, the brown-haired and milk-chocolate skinned baby was quiet as she sucked her thumb wearing an identical pink onesie. The two girls had separate but same model cribs and everything identical for the girls to share. Yes, it was a cliché to give twins similar, if not the same, outfits, but these girls looked so different that it was the only way to inform people that yes, they were twin sisters.</p>
<p>The man smiled at the girls and turned to head to his room that was at the end of the hall. The Weasley opened the door slowly, creeping in and began removing his clothes. The light turned on suddenly, and a, Adonis of a man, Blaise Zabini, was wide awake. “You’re home later than usual,” he noted as he laid in bed, his lower half covered by a white bed sheet.</p>
<p>Ron smiled, “I’m sorry, I found something rather interesting at work,” he spoke, even if he wasn’t really supposed to talk about work like this. Though he knew if he hid this information from Blaise, he would be on the receiving on a rather long dry spell. “I think Harry and Draco’s daughter was found,” he said.</p>
<p>The Slytherin alumni eyes flew open, and he jolted his head a bit, “excuse me? What did you say?”</p>
<p>“Harry and Draco’s daughter. Remember Harry was pregnant, and he was killed and there was no sign of the baby? Well, a little girl popped up on Harry’s file, a genetic match to him on her maternal side,” Ron said. “Tomorrow I’m going to investigate this lead, but Blaise, I’m telling you, this girl looks exactly like Draco if he was a girl!” Ron said.</p>
<p>“Do you have a picture with you?! I want to see!” Blaise asked.</p>
<p>“Not on me. I couldn’t take it out of the file even if I wanted to. You know that’s illegal,” Ron stated as he removed his pants and pulled out a draw of pajama bottoms from their dresser. “Besides, I’m going to look into the case. It’s not an easy situation. I can’t say much but this girl…she’s been through some things and thrusting her into a new life won’t be easy.”</p>
<p>Blaise was quiet for a moment and then asked, “And Draco? Any leads on finding him?”</p>
<p>“No,” Ron answered bluntly.</p>
<p>“Are you even looking still?” Blaise asked with concern.</p>
<p>“No,” Ron answered truthfully. “He doesn’t want to be found, not that I blame him,” the red-haired male sighed as he remembered how much pain Draco had gone through from Harry’s death to the accusation, to the loss of trust within the community and how much it affected his boys. “Draco’s gone Blaise, and that means if their daughter is found, he won’t see her again unless he decides to come out of hiding.”</p>
<p>Blaise looked at his husband and firmly stated, “bring her home, Ron. Bring <em>them all</em> home.”</p>
<p>Ron finished getting dressed for the evening and went over, climbing over Blaise’s body, “you ask the world of me Blaise,” icy blue eyes locked lovingly into dark pools of his partner’s, “have I failed you yet?”</p>
<p>Blaise smiled, “no.” The two locked lips together in a passionate embrace. The kiss was interrupted when one of the twins started crying, which was able to be heard on the magical baby monitor. Ron groaned, getting up, “I’ll get her,” he said. “It’s more likely Wylla crying.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, then she’ll wake up Zoey so you might want to hurry,” Blaise said. Ron poked his tongue out playfully as he had to tend to the babies while Blaise stayed in bed. Though in fairness, he had spent the entire day with the girls, so now it was Ron’s turn. “Don’t leave me waiting~” Blaise teased Ron as he left the room.</p>
