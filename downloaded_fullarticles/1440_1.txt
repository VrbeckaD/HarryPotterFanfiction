    <p dir="ltr">In the years after the fall of Voldemort, the wizarding world saw a rise of marriages among their young people. When asked about it, the older generations told anyone who would listen that it was exactly the same after the first war. </p><p dir="ltr">Hermione and Ron became part of that statistic 6 years after the fall of Voldemort. They had decided to have it at a muggle church, which had caused a fit from Mrs.Weasley, but everyone else had been enthusiastic. </p><p dir="ltr">Ginny had never been one to dream about weddings. She never thought about what type of dress she would want, or cake, or any other multitude of things. She hadn’t bothered even when her school friends would talk about it in 7th year, when everyone  felt like they could actually have a chance for a real wedding. </p><p dir="ltr">But when Hermione and Ron had asked Ginny and Harry to be their maid of honor and best man, they both had agreed without hesitation. But Ginny later lamented that she wouldn’t have agreed  if she had known how often Harry and her would be “accidently” locked in rooms together. Because they hadn’t even been dating. It was mutually ended the year after Ginny finished her last year of Hogwarts. I.e, 3 years ago. But her family was very persistently shoving them together. The only people on their side was Ron and Hermione, thankfully, although it was after Ron had finished offering to hunt down Harry and Hermione had offered to send a jinx to Ginny. </p><p dir="ltr">And now, tonight was the wedding, and the women were trying to get ready despite Harry’s thoughtful but annoying check ins.</p><p dir="ltr">“He really is serious about all of this going right.” Ginny said as she was painting Hermione’s nails. </p><p dir="ltr">Mrs.Weasley grinned at Ginny and said “Of course he would check on you dear.”</p><p dir="ltr">  Ginny kept her face in a pleasant neutral. She knew exactly what her mother was implying, and she desperately wanted to prove her wrong. But she was trying really really really hard not to disrupt her friend’s wedding. </p><p dir="ltr">Since the war, Ginny had to re-examine a lot of her life, and after Harry and Ginny had broken up, Ginny had caught herself feeling oddly relieved. She had felt relieved everytime she finally drove her past boyfriends mad enough to break up with her, and she felt rather horrified that she had continued dating when she felt like that. So she had sworn off dating. Harry, on the other hand, had not sworn off dating. He had finally allowed himself to relax, and had gone out with a few nice people since their breakup. </p><p dir="ltr">Ginny shook her head. She really needed to focus on Hermione. </p><p dir="ltr">Fleur came to her defence, albeit a little late. Her soft voice enveloped the tense room.</p><p dir="ltr">“I think it's very good that she is single for a while. Shows independence!”</p><p dir="ltr">She smiled at Ginny and for a second Ginny could feel her anxiety melting away. Her mother didn’t say anything further as she finished Hermione’s hair.  Ginny finally finished her nails,and Fleur finished her makeup. Hermione stood up, giving each woman a hug. It was obvious that she was holding back tears, and soon they all quickly placed permanence charms on her makeup. </p><p dir="ltr">Their tears were hastily cleaned up when a rather embarrassed Harry peaked his head in to time check. </p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Three hours later everything was ready. Harry and Ginny were paired to walk down the aisle as maid of honor and best man. They had told their favorite couple that it was fine when Hermione had nervously brought it up, but now Ginny was regretting the decision. Because as they headed down the aisle, everyone who caught her eye shot either a pitying look or a full on glare at her, depending on what story they heard. She gritted her teeth. Harry squeezed her arm as they went to stand in their respective spots by the altar. Ron soon joined them. </p><p dir="ltr">Ginny couldn’t help but smile at her brother’s besotted expression when Hermione headed down the aisle. She could feel her tears building up and thanked merlin for makeup charms. </p><p dir="ltr">Hermione was led down the aisle by Mr.Weasley. (She had hunted down her parents, but ultimately let them stay obliviated, as they had adopted a 10-year-old girl and seemed very content. She had managed to convince them to move back to Britain for a “retirement”.)</p><p dir="ltr">The ceremony itself was fairly short. That didn’t stop both Harry and Ginny from crying before the couple finished their vows.</p><p dir="ltr">As the wedding party headed into the nearby reception hall, Ginny found her eyes drawn to a pretty blonde woman in the corner. She peered closer and realized it was Luna.</p><p dir="ltr">She quietly excused herself and walked as fast as she could over to her old classmate. She could feel her heart pounding in her ears a little when Luna turned to look at her and she got the full blast of her beauty. The blonde smiled at her. </p><p dir="ltr">“Hello Ginny, I knew you would be here.” </p><p dir="ltr">Ginny smiled back at her. And didn’t respond. They stood there in silence for a second while Ginny gained her sense. </p><p dir="ltr">Ginny finally said “So what are you doing here? I thought you were working out of the country?” </p><p dir="ltr">“I was. But now I’m back.” Was, disappointingly, all Luna revealed. </p><p dir="ltr">“How long will you be in Britain?” Ginny asked.</p><p dir="ltr">“As long as I like, I’m fairly free-lance right now.” Luna said.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh. Well. Good.” Ginny wasn’t exactly sure what Luna did, and at this point was afraid to ask.</p><p dir="ltr">The two stood and watched the crowd. Harry and Krum were having a rather rousing conversation, while Hermione and Ron were greeting the guests. Luna’s father was discussing muggle newspapers with Mr.Weasley, Mrs.Weasley looking fondly on. All was well. </p><p dir="ltr">“Does this remind you of-” Ginny stopped herself from saying it. Fleur’s wedding.</p><p dir="ltr">Luna nodded nonetheless. </p><p dir="ltr">Ginny could read the same thought in her parent’s eyes, along with a few members of the order that could attend. She was surprised to feel Luna squeeze her hand. </p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t worry, nothing bad will happen at this one.” Luna said. </p><p dir="ltr">Despite her words, Ginny could feel the anxiety flaring up in her stomach. She kept the now forced smile on her face as she said just loud enough for Luna.</p><p>“How do you know?”</p><p dir="ltr">Luna just smiled at her. </p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Luna was right, as always. </p><p dir="ltr">Ginny found herself orbiting Luna for the rest of the reception, always around to rescue her from an odd conversation or weird uncle. They caught up in a way that they hadn’t since Hogwarts, and Ginny realized how much she had missed Luna. <br/>
    After Harry and Ginny danced, Luna sweetly asked for a dance. Ginny agreed, of course, and for the rest of the evening they tried to ignore how close they were to each other.</p>
