      <p>This was a challenge I received from a good friend of mine but wasn't able to continue. There are only three chapters of this, and hopefully I can come back to it this year. </p><p>Anyway, this is the last fic I will post to stave off boredom against the harsh circumstances we find ourselves in. I hope you are taking care of yourself, follow all the measures applied by your country. Don't become arrogant believing you are invincible. This are not times to become a Chuunibyo. If you don't know what that is, you can look it up. I can only contribute with this so you don't get too stressed out in your house. I have adjusted my schedule and I hope to update soon enough my other fics. Please hang in there! We can do it!</p><p>Leave your comments with what you think about this fic, if you like it, if you don't, what you expect, etc. You can ask for spoilers if you want, too! Anything, you want I will reply just so you know there is someone to talk to!</p>

    <hr/><p> </p><p>The fire rose high as if touching the starry sky. It was a comparison between red and black, light and darkness. It could be confused for a pyre dedicated to the gods, thanking for all the blessings they send to mortals. But to those who knew, those who were close to the place, they only saw destruction. The wood was crumbling due to the force of the scorching fire, swallowing the whole house. Nothing could be saved. No one could be saved. Because by the time someone arrived, it was too late.</p><p>The plan was simple: capture them just in case. So they had to get in, stun the family and take them to their Lord. Something went wrong in between. The Dark Mark started to hurt just when they were about to break into the house and then it faded to a dull, really pale grey. That was all for the only woman in the group, the most loyal, to know that something was wrong and for something to click in her mind.</p><p>She lost it.</p><p>She blew up the door while cackling like some vengeful spirit, the red lights of her Crucios flared constantly and when the ones accompanying her finally snapped out of their shock, she was already casting a <em>Fiendfyre</em> that quickly consumed the house, barely letting them escape.</p><p>Next day, they were captured by the Aurors not without giving some hell of a fight.</p><p>In front of that house in Godric's Hollow, where the Potters lived, a man was crouching on the floor, bawling and yelling about the injustice of the lives lost, those that will never come back to him. The young man, with black, shoulder-length hair and aristocratic features befitting of a Black had just lost his best friend, his friend's wife who was like a sister and his godson. Sirius Black was crying the loss of James, Lily and Harry Potter's lives.</p><p>Lost to a traitor friend Sirius swore he would get in his hands on no matter what, no matter how long it took. He was going to get revenge for them.</p><p>But just that one traitor wasn't enough for him. Sirius knew that Peter wasn’t brave or skillful enough to do what was happening in front of him. No. He wanted the ones responsible for such an atrocious act. And he wouldn’t have known who did it, if it wasn’t because he got a glimpse of their figures just when they were Dissaparating.</p><p>Family or not, he wanted Bellatrix's blood. He wanted her blood to run like the rivers of Ancient Babylon. He wanted to hear the screams of that useless husband of hers, together with his brother. Make her suffer slowly until she begs for him to end her miserable life and even then, he wouldn't give her the satisfaction of such an easy end. No. As a Black, he would never forgive himself if he were that soft with her. He was even willing to embrace the Black Madness if that meant enacting a just revenge.</p><p>He wanted the whole Lestrange family to feel at least half the pain he feels.</p><p>It wasn't until a hand squeezed his shoulder that he looked up to see the same devastated face he was sporting on one Remus Lupin; who at least had some self-control to not fall apart like his friend and cast an <em>Aqua Eructo </em>to extinguish the flames. Seeing the fire dying, the water flowing, and hearing the sobs beside him were enough to let his own tears fall.</p><p>It wasn’t fair, Remus thought. Wasn’t it enough to bear with the discrimination towards his condition? The glares from people who realized what he was. The malicious words spoken by people who didn’t care that he was able to hear them. The sneers, the subtle- and sometimes not so subtle- pushing; yet, the scorn didn’t compare to what was happening in front of him. The pain. The loneliness. The sudden realization that his pack dissolved in just one night; one a traitor, three dead, and the one remaining was as lost and broken as he was at the moment.</p><p>Time passed in a blur for them, just standing seeing what was left: charred, wet wood and smoke. Aurors here and there asking questions and checking the scene. The looks of pity, the fleeting words of sympathy; everywhere around them was hectic. From time to time, they would hear a faint laugh from the muggle streets near the invisible wizarding area they were in. Laugh from kids disguised as some monster; kids celebrating Halloween. There was nothing to celebrate for them.</p><p>For Halloween, All Hallows Eve, Samhain will never be the same.</p><p>Little they knew that in the shadows, there was another figure with a heart as broken as them.</p><p>His friend, his first and best friend, his first and only love gone like the smoke coming from the charred wood; unrecognizable, if the fire was something to take into account. For nothing would have survived that catastrophe.</p><p>He had had a bad feeling so he followed Bellatrix, the Lestrange brothers and Barty Crouch Jr. to where Peter Pettigrew told them the Potters were. He didn’t trust the coward to know where they were; after all, the mutt was a better option to be the Secret Keeper. It was obvious. Black and Potter were like two drops from the same pond. Arrogant, foolish, insufferable Gryffindors that were full of scorn for others that didn’t see the world just like them.</p><p>But he was wrong. Peter really was the Secret Keeper and that was the beginning of the end.</p><p>Severus Snape couldn’t do anything but watch the destruction. It was like a vivid nightmare playing before his eyes. He didn’t want to believe but reality was a bitch and together with the screams of Sirius Black, he knew it was real. He didn't want to show his emotions like the mutt but he just couldn't suppress them. He indulged and promised himself it was going to be the last time because tears were not going to bring her back.</p><p>And from that day on, he would regret the moment he delivered that prophecy to the Dark Lord. And from that day on, even as a dark wizard, he would never again support any cause he didn't believe in completely and much less from a madman. And from that day on, Severus Snape would never be the same again.</p><p>And the three just looked at the burnt house, the raising smoke and the Dark Mark casted by the <em>Morsmordre</em> curse jeering at them from above in the sky.</p><p>And the kids kept celebrating.</p><p>And Sirius and Remus stood there waiting for the Aurors to confirm the deaths of the Potter family. The <em>Fiendfyre</em> was simply too cruel and didn't leave much of them. The little that could be recognizable was from James and Lily, nothing left from little Harry.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p align="center">...</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Some cried, others were consumed by anger but on that same night, in Wiltshire, on a big space of land where an elegant manor house stood surrounded by the darkness of the night, there was someone who was excited.</p><p>The Manor at the end of a straight drive with lights glinting in the diamond-paned windows, was the depiction of power, history, money and status among the Pureblood community. Somewhere in the lush garden beyond the hedge, a fountain was spilling water forming different shapes. The bushes and grass were perfectly trimmed thanks to the House-elves of this manor.</p><p>A blond man hurried along the drive, almost tripping in his haggard appearance, even forgetting that Apparating to the large and sumptuously decorated entrance hall of the house would have been easier than walking all the way to the doors. But he had news that would change his future and the one of his family. Whether it was good or bad news, he would leave it to the joint decision between him and his Wife.</p><p>He pushed the big doors open and ignoring the elf that came to his aid, he walked to the only place in which he would find his Wife.</p><p>The drawing room was as elegant and sumptuous as the rest of the house with windows as high as the walls of the room itself, the marble floor always had a glint as if it was brand new, a small fire roared in the hearth giving the place a comfortable warmth, the ancient yet elegant black furniture looked as good as new. On one of the high backed armchairs rested a pale, blonde woman, dressed in dark purple robes. Her face was soft and her eyes were almost closing, a book on her lap was proof of what she had been doing before her Husband arrived.</p><p>"Cissa!" The blond man, all decorum and finesse of a Pureblood thrown out the window, yelled making her flinch in her seat.</p><p>"Lucius, what is it?" She immediately asked when she noticed the state in which her Husband returned. The book fell to the floor due to her abruptly standing up.</p><p>"He's gone." He ran to his wife and hugged her. Some may call him a coward, but to Lucius Malfoy no cause was more important than his family itself. He always feared to leave his beautiful Wife alone to raise the kids.</p><p>"What do you mean he's gone?" She asked when they separated. The black bags under her eyes, contrasting with the whiteness of her skin, reminded him that she had been having less and less sleep due to the constant calls of their Lord for meetings. It showed how much she cared for him, and how worried and stressed she had been lately. It was a relief that she never took that much interest in whatever Lucius was into and never believed in what he was fighting for, as she never received the Mark like him.</p><p>"Look," he raised his sleeve to show his pale forearm and where the Dark Mark was.</p><p>Narcissa's eyes widened for a fraction of second and then slowly raising her trembling hand, she gently touched his skin. The Dark Mark which was used to call her Husband and more often than not, to torture him, was not its usual inky black but a pale grey, almost fading. There was only a reason for this; the Dark Lord Voldemort was gone.</p><p>She immediately hugged Lucius for receiving such good news. It wasn't that she didn't believe in the cause anymore but between the care of her babies and the constant worry every time Lucius was called, added to the masks she had to put up in front of all the Death Eaters and other Purebloods, her stress levels were getting higher day by day. Almost reaching the roof.</p><p>She was too young to deal with all that. And being a Black was just adding a drop to her already worn state of mind. A bit more and she feared she would end up like her sister Bellatrix.</p><p>A shudder ran down her spine to the mere thought of the now Lady Lestrange. There were many words to describe her sister and deranged was the one that came often to the forefront of her mind.</p><p>Hearing her cackle every single time she kills or tortures someone, seeing the malevolent and frightening glint in her eyes that tells her that she more than enjoys what she does, was enough to convince Narcissa that her sister was a lost cause. But more than that, Bellatrix was proof enough that the Black Madness was not just some myth in the family and even showed its depth. Its insidious side.</p><p>Lucius rubbed her back not knowing what was in her mind because he was busy with his own thoughts. There was a great sense of relief washing down his body to know that his ‘Master’ was gone, or at least he would have some time without him to completely concentrate in what was important: his family, his job and, for the time being, to avoid at all costs being thrown into Azkaban due to being a Death Eater.</p><p>He knew that he had made a big mistake when he enrolled himself to ‘the cause’ but there was no way he could have said no to his Father and disappoint him in the process. Of course, he used to believe in what his Father believed. He used to look up to the great wizard his Father looked up to. It could be said that it was all an inherited respect, not something that was born from his thoughts. And that was his mistake.</p><p>What once was pride to follow a powerful dark wizard bound to do great things in the wizarding world, became an utter nightmare when the same man started losing his mind day by day, becoming a danger to not only his enemies but to the ones who followed him too. And Lucius’ Father wasn't able to see what was left of the man he had considered a friend during his Hogwarts years because of his untimely death.</p><p>There was no day Lucius didn’t dread the call of his Master and even when the other followers were people he knew, fellow Slytherins, he always felt lonelier and in need of companionship; perhaps only Severus was the only one he trusted, because Lucius was the one that got the dour young man in all that mess.</p><p>He really admired the young man. He barely blinked in front of the Dark Lord, his Occlumency shields always up, and their Lord was always praising him for it.</p><p>It was envy-inducing but his priorities were different from Severus. All Lucius wanted was to spend time with his Wife and his kids, just when he could finally conceive them.</p><p>It had been some pressuring years for both Narcissa and him. The more time it passed without them being able to have an Heir, the more the other Pureblood families were starting to whisper things. It was nerve-wrecking at first but then he learned to brush the comments aside while they lasted. After all, it was unbecoming of a Malfoy to react to such meaningless words.</p><p>No more, though. He not only had one but two kids. It was a bit of a shame that they were both girls but it had been a long time since the last female Malfoy was born that he didn't care they weren't boys. Due to his standing of the second richest family in Wizarding Britain, then there was no doubt that whoever married his little girls, they would be marrying into the Malfoy family and not his girls marrying to another family.</p><p>That, if he ever wanted them to get married. They were just so perfect in his eyes that he didn't want them far from him.</p><p>"Where are the girls? Are they already asleep?" He asked looking to the door wanting to run and hug their tiny little bodies. Narcissa giggled just seeing the face of her Husband, such a fool for his girls but she didn't blame him, they were really perfect. The two of them made really beautiful babies that it was a pity she couldn't conceive any more without the risk of dying.</p><p>"Yes, they are asleep. Shall we go see them and then go to bed ourselves?" She said while brushing the dust only she saw in his robes, a glint in her eyes. Lucius looked down at her and smirked.</p><p>"We shall." He replied offering his arm which she gladly took and both disappeared in the hallways of the large Manor.</p><p>

</p><p>In a little town in the magical side of Berkshire, stood a house, or what was left of it. Aurors surrounded the house while the residents of the little town were trying to sneak a peek over what had happened. Many heard an explosion that most likely caused the roof of the house to blow up, the windows to shatter and part of a wall to collapse, but they didn't know what exactly happened. Everybody knew who lived there. The Longbottoms.</p><p>A tall, thin and bony old lady wearing a bright green dress, a red handbag and a hat with a stuffed vulture on it was quickly making her way through the horde of people around the house. She was pretty nimble and dexterous despite her age while walking, and whoever didn't move she would throw a little jinx and shove them aside. Her mildly wrinkled face, which was normally severe and stony, showed anxiety and a shadow of apprehension when she was contacted by the Aurors.</p><p>"Lady, you cannot go further," a young Auror said stopping her strides. She threw him a nasty glare and the young man flinched back, but when she was about to make a biting comment another aged voice beat her to it.</p><p>"Better let her through, my boy, she may be old but she still has her wit." A man with white hair, a wrinkled face hidden behind half-moon spectacles, a long, white beard that reached his belt that was practically tucked in it, and bright orange robes came through the mass of people.</p><p>"Dumbledore," the young Auror squeaked.</p><p>"Albus," the old lady, Augusta Longbottom, greeted with a sharp nod and didn't stay with him to make trivial talk. She walked up the path towards the entrance where another Auror stopped her, but she was already impatient, what with having been already stopped and snapped. "I'm Augusta Longbottom, Frank Longbottom is my son and I want to know what happened here!" She demanded.</p><p>The Auror gave her a sympathetic look and led her to the kitchen where there were two bodies under white sheets. She stopped mid-step and felt her heart falter, her sight go blurry and her body sway until she felt an arm supporting her. She turned to look at the Auror and swatted his arm, her gaze falling on the two covered lumps on the floor.</p><p>"Are both...?" Her voice was low and broke in the middle.</p><p>"Yes, the kid survived, though," the Auror pointed to a bundle in a bassinet which was most probably taken there from upstairs taking into account the hour. It was really late. She walked closer to the bassinet and looked into it. A pink, pudgy baby was covered in a little blanket. He was sleeping but on his forehead there was a strange scar with the shape of a lightning.</p><p>"What happened?" She asked looking back to the Auror.</p><p>"You-Know-Who came and murdered them. We found Frank in the kitchen," he looked back to the body of ex-Auror Frank Longbottom. "There was a battle but he still lost. We found Alice upstairs in the boy's room. There was also a robe next to the body. The boy was crying and the scar was bleeding. We believe that he defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named." A glint of admiration for the sleeping and oblivious baby shone in his eyes.</p><p>But Augusta's expression was not the same as him. A scowl appeared on her face while she wondered why the Dark Lord had to attack her son's house. There was no way that a pair of Aurors and a baby were any threat to him. She wanted answers.</p><p>"Augusta, we must talk," said Albus a few steps behind her. She turned around and her scowl deepened just seeing the old man. She was old but her mind was incredibly sharp. If anyone had answers then that must be Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>

  <br/>
</p><p>Sorterarvägen Street is a street in a muggle neighborhood in Umeå, Sweden. But at the end of the street that is next to the river many forget how it’s called, there was a big white house with a red roof. It was the last day of October, and just like the previous nights when the temperature was starting to get colder and colder to let winter come, this night was cold too. But people still walked around or just sat at the benches by the river. All of them, muggles. Yet in this house, lived a Magical family.</p><p>Of course no muggle had any idea the house was there, they would just think it was an empty spot with overgrown grass they cannot walk in. That last detail was all thanks to the anti-muggles wards around the residence that made them turn around to walk away and forget about the 'empty' spot.</p><p>Unlike other countries in Europe, Swedish don’t celebrate Halloween or Samhain, in the case of wizards. So it was a normal day like any other day for these muggles, yet for the people in the Magical house it was a bad day, a sad day. To Bosse Dahl, it was the worst day of his life.</p><p>The past months were the worst of his life when the Healers found out that his Wife and son were dying from Dragon Pox, and it was under the Healers advice that hemoved away from the busy life of Stockholm so she didn’t suffer much. His son was another story, in or out of Stockholm he was going to be extremely uncomfortable during the illness until he dies. There was nothing they could do, just make them as comfortable as possible.</p><p>And that was why they moved to this cottage in Umeå. With the winter coming, going to the house in Kiruna was just too extreme; the place could become a frozen landscape in a matter of seconds. It was a beautiful sight during the summer where despite of the little sun it received, it was still cold and the lands white. But in winter, it was just not something you would like to expose yourself to, and certainly not in this situation where lives were about to be lost.</p><p>Everybody in the Swedish Magical Parliament knew about the misfortune of one Bosse Dahl. As the only Noble and Most Ancient House in Sweden, all witches and wizards knew about their whereabouts. They were like celebrities, well-loved celebrities. The sorrow that stemmed from all the Magical community was enough to drown the whole world just for the loss of this prominent family.</p><p>Glances full of sadness, pats on the back, strained smiles were recurrent gestures dedicated to Lord Dahl, and it was just some sort of reminder for what was going to come soon.</p><p>And he couldn't really know what others would do or say if they knew that it wasn't only his Wife -news of her illness made public- but his son too, that was going to die. Thank the gods for small mercies that little tidbit was still secret, and only the Healers working for his family knew.</p><p>His Wife was the sweetest woman he had ever met. She was a prodigy in Healing Magic that it was such an irony for her to be dying from Dragon Pox. But even with vaccinations, the illness was the cause of most of the deaths in Swedish wizards and witches. Everybody knew that it was because of the dragons that lived in the Reserve that harbored almost a hundred dragons. But as a community that respected all Magical Creatures, there was little they could do but to take precautions with vaccinations.</p><p>The death rate was low but it still procured most deaths in Sweden.</p><p>Lord Dahl thought it was lucky that he himself was not sick, as that would have meant the disappearance of the most prominent house in Magical Sweden. Not only the Parliament would be in such disarray if that would happen, though, he also didn't want to think what the rest of the Magical community would do. So, although it was Lady and Heir Dahl that were going to die, there still was one remaining family member.</p><p>He was still young, not even 30 years-old, with long blond hair, high cheekbones, a sharp nose and blue eyes; a handsome man to most women. So, if he so wished, he could meet another woman to conceive another Heir. Those would be the thoughts of the Noble Houses if they knew the truth about his situation. They would parade their daughters in front of him to pick like cattle. After all, who wouldn't want to be part of the Noble of Most Ancient House of Dahl?</p><p>In the Master bedroom of the house, the family was gathered together with the Healers. On the bed, the already lifeless body of their son was lying beside Lady Dahl who was on the brink of death. The Healers were called by Lord Dahl when he noticed that his son was not breathing anymore and it made his wife get worse due to the grief. Her breathing was labored and they were waiting for her last breath that came when the clock announced it was past 11pm.</p><p>The Healers confirmed her death with such a somber air, seeing how one of their colleagues perished from such a common but deadly illness. Lord Dahl stood and let the Healers do their job. He first went to the living room and glanced at the many photos framed and hung on the walls; photos of him and his wife and of the three of them together. He closed his eyes to prevent the tears from falling and just headed to the door.</p><p>The cold air hit his face and a shiver ran down his spine but it didn’t stop him from stepping out and walk down the street. The same street that was now void of people due to the cold breeze coming from the river too. His tired frame looked like some haunted spirit in the dimly illuminated street.</p><p>He didn’t know how long he walked, but when he looked around, he noticed he had walked a lot as he had ended up far from his house. He sighed and made his way back. It was past midnight, perhaps, so the Healers must have already taken her wife and son’s bodies to the hospital to burn.</p><p>It was when he was back to Sorterarvägen Street that he noticed a strong magical fluctuation. The lights turned off in the whole street and he felt there was a powerful Ward by the river. His skin tingled with such thick and pure magic. It was a bit oppressive too, that, had he not been powerful himself, he would have dropped to his knees. He walked to where the magic was coming from and just when he was about to approach the Ward, he felt the magic enveloping him. His heart started beating really fast and for a moment he felt fear. It was an amazing and frightening feeling.</p><p>When the foreign magic receded, the Ward fell and the next thing he knew, he heard, were thewails of a crying baby. He looked towards a bench and with slow steps he noticed there, in the bench, was a baby indeed. His hair was black and it was tussled, his crying face, as well as his clothes, were covered in soot. The man stood there just staring at the tiny, writhing body of this unknown baby and while he looked, many questions formed in his head.</p><p>What was a baby doing outside? Was this baby the one that created such Ward? That terrifying magic came from the baby? Did the baby have parents? Or more like, were they the ones who left the baby here? Or something else happened? The soot maybe had something to do with it. Why was the baby covered in soot? It was a he? Or a she? The baby was too pale to be a he, too… cute. Maybe a she. She was too pale and her lips were starting to get blue.</p><p>That was when he realized the baby was cold. He ran to envelope the tiny bundle in his jacket and rubbed the little back to create friction and warm the baby. Was the ward keeping him warm and when it recognized that a person was near, it fell so whoever found him would be able to take care of the baby? Magic was able to do such a thing? It was as if it was sentient. He had read many theories about it but they were just that, theories. Well, almost everything was possible with magic, so the theory had its merits.</p><p>The baby finally stopped crying when the cold was no longer a problem. Lord Dahl’s breath hitched when the baby looked at him through the most vivid green eyes he had ever seen. The glint in them had nothing to do with the tears just shed, it meant power. The baby’s magic was powerful. They spent some time looking at each other. The baby was cooing while drooling over the little fist he had just put in his mouth and when he got bored of looking at the man in front of him, he looked around to finally yawn.</p><p>Lord Dahl took that as cue that the baby was tired and without thinking it twice, he walked back to his house. A Healer stayed behind to wait for Bosse Dahl and inform him that everything was taken care of. The Healer expected to see a devastated man when the door opened, but he never expected to see Lord Dahl coming in with a baby in his arms.</p><p>“What happened?” The Healer asked in his deep voice that sounded intimidating in Swedish but he was totally a gentle man, and more when it came to Lord Dahl. As the family Healer, Hynek Hammarskjöld respected Lord Dahl a lot.</p><p>“I found this baby outside.” Lord Dahl’s voice reflected that he himself still couldn’t believe what was going on.</p><p>Hynek looked at the baby that was about to fall asleep in the arms of the man and he silently walked towards Bosse and coaxed the baby out of his arms. The baby fussed a bit but otherwise didn’t cry. The Healer placed him on the couch he was sat on and began to run diagnostic spells to ensure the baby was healthy, what with the little clothes on and the cold night; he didn’t want the baby to catch a cold.</p><p>“The baby’s a boy and he’s alright. His lungs just had some smoke in them and his eyes were a bit irritated but other than that, he’s healthy.” Hynek informed in a professional voice.</p><p>“Smoke? He was lying on a bench near here…” Bosse trailed off. “There was a Ward.”</p><p>“What?” Asked the Healer not quite believing what he was hearing.</p><p>“When I was coming back, I sensed a strong magical fluctuation. I followed it and found a Ward; it was a powerful Ward that could put the ones from the Parliament to shame. When it fell, I found him inside. I think he created it, or more like his magic created it.” Lord Dahl mused out loud the events of the night.</p><p>“I didn’t sense any Magic.”</p><p>“That’s because of my Wards. You think I would have flimsy Wards in this house? Nothing comes in or out when it comes to Magic in here. That’s why the house is undetectable.” Bosse stared intently at the baby who was already asleep after all the fussing from the new man. “He was caught in a fire.” He mused out loud again. “That explains the smoke and soot. Maybe the parents couldn’t get him on time but he, in a way or another, Apparated out of the house and ended up here.”</p><p>Hynek nodded while listening to that reasoning. It made sense and explained most of the diagnostic he had gotten from his check-up. The baby’s identity was still a mystery, but at least they had an idea of what happened to him.</p><p>“I’ll take him to the hospital to check on him in case the diagnosis didn’t catch something. I will also look for recent fires in the country, maybe his family is still alive and we can contact it.”</p><p>Bosse nodded and let the Healer take the baby. After man and baby disappeared through the Floo Network, he noticed for the first time that his house felt empty and cold. It again hit him that he no longer had a wife and a son. He ungracefully let himself collapse on the couch, and it was until minutes later that he noticed that the couch was warm. There was Magic lingering around it which he recognized as the baby’s.</p><p>Bosse smiled.</p><p>He couldn’t believe that a baby was offering indirect comfort; for the only thing in the house that was warm was the couch. The house and his heart were cold. Just like the night of that last day of October.</p><p> </p>
