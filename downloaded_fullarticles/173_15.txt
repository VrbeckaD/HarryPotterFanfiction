          <div class="userstuff"><p>He hated that sordid Professor Lupin in his run-down rags. It was rapidly going downhill with a school which had to hire someone like that as a teacher. In his opinion, teachers had to be respectable and competent, like Professor Snape—and not completely moronic, like this man. </p><p>Their last lesson had been a bit of a joke. First, Lupin had exposed him by forcing him to reveal his worst fear—then, the man had made a fool of himself by showing his worst fear to be the moon. Malfoy rolled his eyes when he remembered it. Which sensible human being was afraid of the moon? Ridiculous! </p><p>It was not even a surprise that Lupin absolutely fawned on Potter. Scum always kept to scum. Malfoy made a vow to himself: he would not tolerate this for long. If he could find just the slightest shred of evidence for any wrongdoing against Lupin, his father would hear about it. After all, it had to be good for something to have a father who was on the school board.<br/>
---<br/>
For the months and weeks that followed, Malfoy observed Lupin closely. He did not fail to notice how often the man was unable to teach because of some supposed sickness. His guts told him that this was important; but he still couldn’t call the secret by the name. It always seemed to elude him by a whisker—and it drove him crazy.<br/>
As winter turned to spring and spring slowly faded into summer, Malfoy was still pondering the mysterious behavior of the man. Although there were now also other things to occupy his mind, he still gave the matter a lot of thought—but it was not until May that the answer really dawned on him. </p><p>He had fallen asleep in the library, where he had been studying hard for the upcoming exams and the moon was already high in the sky when he made his way back to the Slytherin common room. It was a big moon, not quite full yet, but close enough. He supposed that it was only a day or maybe two until the orb had reached its largest expanse.<br/>
There was something tempting about nights like these. When he was home at the Manor, he often enjoyed late night strolls on days like these; usually accompanied by his mother or father. He knew he would be in trouble if he did this now, since students were strictly forbidden to be out of bed after hours, but since he was already too late anyway it didn’t matter.</p><p>Malfoy sneaked back through the Entrance Hall and out of the great doors, into the grounds. He stopped at the top of the staircase to take a few deep breaths of the nightly air—and then he heard it. </p><p>It was a strange sound—one he didn’t immediately recognize. At first, he thought it was an animal howling in the distance somewhere; but something didn’t quite fit. It didn’t sound like an animal after all—and neither did it sound like a ghost or the wind. There was, in fact, a very human quality about the sound.<br/>
Following the impulse of the moment, he decided he needed to know more about what—or rather who—was making the sound and decided to follow it. He didn’t have to walk very far, before was able to make out the shadow of a man standing under a tree. There was no doubt that it was this man who had howled earlier, because the sound repeated—just when a beam of moonlight fell upon his face. Malfoy recognized him at once. Lupin! </p><p>The teacher had not yet seen him, but Malfoy had understood at last. So, this was Lupin’s secret. This was why the man feared the moon; why he was sick so often. He was a werewolf—Malfoy was certain of it now. A nasty grin spread across his pale face as he slowly and silently drew back into the castle. Oh, this was wonderful! His father would definitely have to hear about this—and once he did, it would be the end. The end of the werewolf scum. The end of Dumbledore, that foolish protector of the weak. Possibly even the end of Hogwarts itself.</p></div>
