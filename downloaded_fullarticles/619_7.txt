  <em>Le Roi Des Masques</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>Part One</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>
  <em>Since their creation, the Four Kingdoms had lived in peace with one another. The Founders’ Courts kept to themselves, occupied with their separate lives and duties, ruling their kingdoms as they saw fit. The Royal Families came and went, sometimes dying out, at other times joining in marriage; they discussed and advised each other, adhered to the laws and guides they had agreed on an age ago, and had passed down from generation to generation. Thus stability was maintained.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Each Kingdom had their own strengths and weaknesses, as one should expect from any person, culture or place. The Gryffindors were strong and brave - their fearsome warriors loved and feared in equal measure, unrivalled by any; the gold lion of the Princes was a symbol of hope and justice to all who saw it. Ravenclaw had their Queen, a tradition of matriarchy laid down by the Founder herself, their scholars and Great Library respected and admired by all, their inventions and ideas shared among the kingdoms so that all prospered. Hufflepuff, led by the Dukes, was renowned for its connection to the earth, their dedicated toiling and never-ending patience an inspiration for others. Lastly, lastly, there was Slytherin, the masters of intrigue, of politics and ambition, cultivated and encouraged by the High Lords who ruled them. It was this, perhaps, the very life of secrecy and the desire for power which would corrupt them, and in the end, bring about their downfall.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>At that particular time, though, the Kingdoms thrived, and did so for many years, the people happy and prosperous, the leaders content and safe. It remained so, until the unthinkable happened.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The magick that had so characterised the Four Kingdoms began to die out. People began to lose their Gift.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was a gradual process, the loss of magick, and at first only a handful of people knew anything was happening at all. The Elder Council knew, of course, involved as they were in the education and supervision of the Gifted, and received reports from all over the kingdoms from people trying to work out what exactly was happening, and what possible solutions there were.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>After all, when people first realised what had happened, all that they could feel was confusion, fear, their minds filled with questions, but no answers. The forefront thinkers, and even the Elder Council, could offer no explanation, no aid to the helpless citizens. Lives had become so dependent upon the Gift, that even the thought of continuing on without it was unimaginable.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Despite all efforts, the loss carried on unchecked. More and more children were born unGifted, and madness seemed to take hold of everyone. Those who still retained their magick – the very old, the very powerful, the very few – were hounded night and day, as if they could help, as if they could share what Gift they had left. Many of them went into hiding. Many others were driven to their death from fear or others’ jealousy. And still the magick disappeared.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The Royals, strangely - miraculously - had all kept their magick, their Gift. They had always been selective in whom they married, and by choosing only the strongest, they seemed to have ensured their continued line, their children further undertaking rigorous training and education.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Soon, only the Royals were Gifted. Reactions to this were varied across the Kingdoms. Some felt relief, at this obvious sign that magick was not wholly gone, and hope that the magick might return someday. More, alas, more felt fear and hatred. They despised the fact that their Gifts had gone, while the Royals still had theirs. They feared the power that the Royals now held. They were terrified that helpless and defenceless as the people were against these magick-wielding men and women, they would be able to do nothing if the Royals should choose to abuse their power.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The people had a right to fear, you see. Power does corrupt, after all, and none were now as powerful as they. The future would show so much…but not yet, not yet.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In fear, disaster, more than anyone could have imagined, befell them. The people of the Kingdoms rose up in anger and slaughtered the Royals, chasing after each and every one they could find. Against so many, against such a rage, the Royals, with all their Gifts, stood no chance. Some managed to flee, to hide themselves away, discard their wealth and pasts and begin life anew as ordinary families, lost among so many others who were doing the same.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And so the years passed, and the Kingdoms settled into a new kind of stability, a calm after wreckage and madness. Of the hidden Royals, their lines were diluted as the generations passed, the Gifts of their blood suppressed and faded, but still there, passed on from one to another, rising strong and pure every few generations.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>One such Heir rose, a young boy, the Heir of the Serpent Founder. His name was Tom Marvolo Riddle.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He came from the line of Gaunts, a weak family, the bastard child of an unknown man and a pitiful woman. It never ceases to amaze me that such people could sire such a strong Gifted child…but it matters little in the way of things. Tom Riddle had all the power he needed in order to fulfil his desires - and fulfil them he did!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Orphaned just moments after his birth, his following years were hard, I’ll not deny that, or try to underplay the consequences and effects that his life had upon him; to do so would be a disservice, and is unworthy of me. It is precisely his past that shaped him into what he would become, and in turn, led to what transpired in the future.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Later on, after he had become a man grown, when it was important to discover all that there was to know about Tom Riddle, I began to search for anyone, anything that could tell me something of the man. The task was difficult, however, for Tom Riddle was truly Salazar’s Heir, and had covered his tracks well.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I discovered that Tom had learned of his Gift at an early age, and though not yet understanding the full significance of such a thing, he was aware of its incongruity, and the fact that – in his view – his Gift made him superior to those around him. He spent his childhood in an orphanage, and the fact that it no longer exists now, destroyed by Tom, of course, when he had begun to shape the way of things to come, speaks greatly of how his time there must have been spent.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He left the orphanage at fourteen, the age where children were regularly given as apprentices to Masters of Trade, in the hope that they would learn and work. Tom was apprenticed to an old man, Grindelwald by name, a writer, book-keeper, and story-teller. I believe that it was here that Tom first discovered his heritage, and the first stirrings in his thirst for power began to appear. I know not whether Grindelwald was aware of Tom’s Gift, for there were no records of the time, no indications of it, and Tom murdered the old teacher within a mere five months of beginning his apprenticeship.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Nothing is known of how he spent the next few years of his life, but he was nearly nineteen when he arrived at Hogwarts, the home of the Council of Elders. I was the first to greet him, and I say not without a little regret that I was charmed by him, his eagerness to learn all that we could teach, his flattery and seeming affection for us, and the thrill we felt whenever he was nearby, his Gift calling to the remnants inside of us and reminding us of times past. We were old, alone in our Castle with our memories and faded dreams, and he was young, bright, powerful, and we succumbed to his kind words and gentle appreciation like dogs to their master.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We taught him all he asked, showed him the written histories that had been collected for so long. We told him all we could of the past, the Founders, the Kingdoms.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In the end, we told him too much.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His betrayal was almost too hard to bear. Seeing the child we had taken in and come to love turn to us with derision in eyes gone red with the corruption of his lovely, powerful Gift; seeing his lips curl as he laughed in our faces; watching as he ignored all that we had tried to teach him about humanity, responsibility, mercy…it broke our hearts.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>As I stood there with the other Elders, watching the boy once known as Tom Marvolo Riddle walk away from us, I had never before felt as frail as I did then.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Trust, trust is a wonderful thing: it can give hope to the lost, soothe the pains of the hurt, inspire such wonderful things, and create bonds that last for lifetimes. It is faith in your fellow man, a belief in the good of things, and something that should be treasured. Tom Riddle had destroyed it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With our teachings and the Dark Gift now at his disposal, his rise to power was both swift and unstoppable. Supporters flocked to him from all over the Kingdoms, the majority from his own Slytherin, who gladly declared their loyalty to the Founder’s Heir. Soon he had amassed a vast army to do his bidding; with the Death Eaters he swept over the lands like a dark shadow, striking at any who stood in his way.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Some did try to stop him. They did not succeed. All were crushed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tom Riddle became the Dark Lord Voldemort, feared by all, opposed by none. He installed himself in a castle in the heart of the Slytherin lands like a cruel god who sits upon his throne, looking down heartlessly upon the suffering and pain of his people, uncaring of their feelings or fears, just as long as they serve.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And so it was.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And so it is.</em>
</p><p>Absolutum dominium.</p><p> </p><p>||excerpt from Memoirs of Albus P. W. B. Dumbledore ||</p><p> </p><p align="center">- l  e   r o  i -</p><p align="center">d  e  s</p><p align="center">- m  a  s  q  u  e  s -</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">The sun was setting when the two riders finally reached the small village, stars beginning to appear in scattered groups in the dark sky above them. They were as cold and as weary as the horses they rode, eager for the warmth and shelter that would hopefully be available to them at the village’s tavern. They knew that they would be unable to carry on this late, especially considering the injury that had befallen one of them during the brief skirmish earlier in the evening, when they had been ambushed just after crossing the wide waters of the River Leone. Although they had fought off their attackers - as high-ranking warriors of Slytherin, there was little chance of them not - a parting blow had managed to strike true, and they had had neither the time nor the means by which to treat it properly, choosing instead to carry on until they found somewhere to spend the night.</p><p>Severus looked over at his companion, noticing the scowl that marred his pale, well-defined face. His long blond-white hair was in disarray, a smear of blood decorating his cheek like a savage, his light grey eyes filled with pain and frustration as he steered his charger one-handed, his left arm secured by the makeshift sling that Severus had made earlier.</p><p>‘Lucius,’ Severus called softly.</p><p>Lucius picked up the questioning tone in his voice, able to understand Severus’ every little sign or meaning after such a long friendship. He nodded, the slight tension in his posture easing slightly as the two riders urged their horses on towards the building near the centre of the village. The braziers on either side the door illuminated the sign that swung gently above it, allowing them to see the name of the tavern: <em> The Gryffin’s Claw. </em></p><p>‘Stay here; I’ll see if there is room - though with the size of this village, I don’t see why there shouldn’t be,’ Severus said, dismounting quickly and tying his horse’s rein to the wooden bar intended just for that purpose, before striding towards the door and entering the inn.</p><p>The warmth hit him first, almost painful against his chilled skin, and as he let himself grow accustomed to it he glanced around the room, taking note of the light-hearted atmosphere, the people standing in groups around the large fireplace with its roaring fire, or sitting on benches, drinking, talking, some playing cards or other such games. Severus paid only a small amount of attention to the glances sent his way - enough to ensure there was no imminent threat from the customers - instead scanning the room in order to find the owner of the inn and hopefully secure them a room for the night.</p><p>He’d only taken two steps into the room when he saw a man make his way towards him, wiping his hands on the half-apron tied around his waist, his shirt-sleeves rolled up, and the buttons of his dark-brown waistcoat undone. He had thinning brown hair and a friendly face. Though his eyes were somewhat wary as they took in Severus’ all-black garb, his armour and weapons, Severus had to give him credit for the smile that he mustered up. Removing their Lord’s sign was the only precaution that he and Lucius had taken in order to preserve their anonymity, but even without it, it was not hard to guess what they were, and Severus was still an imposing figure. The inn-keeper had every right to be suspicious of him and his intentions; it likely wasn’t everyday that such people came to the village.</p><p>‘Welcome, sir, to <em> The Gryffin’s Claw </em>. Is there something I can help you with?’</p><p>Severus nodded shortly, slowly removing his gauntlets from his hands.</p><p>‘My companion and I require accommodation and stabling for our horses for a night, if you have it,’ Severus said, and after a brief hesitation added, ‘perhaps for longer, if our business necessitates.’</p><p>The innkeeper nodded happily. ‘Of course, of course. Come - I need to fill it in my ledger.’ He gestured towards a small counter to one side a little away from the main bar - before moving towards it, Severus following along behind.</p><p>‘I’m afraid you caught us at a busy time - autumn festival coming up - but we’ve not many guests staying at the moment, so we should be able to fit you fine enough.’ The man kept up a steady stream of conversation as he bent over behind the counter in order to draw out a large leather-bound book, and though Severus usually detested idle chatter, he found that he did not mind the man’s soft-spoken words. ‘Dinner and breakfast are included in the price of the rooms, though lunch is separate, I’m afraid, but can be bought from the barroom down here. Breakfast is served two hours past dawn, and lunch is at midday. Is that acceptable?’</p><p>Severus nodded. ‘If that is the case, I’d ask for a tray to be brought up to us this evening.’</p><p>‘Very well, sir. Do you require one or two rooms?’</p><p>‘Only one will be needed,’ Severus answered smoothly, black eyes half-daring the innkeeper to comment when he looked up from writing in his book, but the man refused to say anything, instead going back to quickly and efficiently filling in the appropriate notes.</p><p>‘One room then, and the use of the stables - that’ll be two galleons, and seven sickles. What name shall I put you under?’</p><p align="left">‘Tobias,’ Severus said shortly, reaching for the leather pouch of coins attached to his belt, and handing over the right amount of money.</p><p align="left">‘I’ll send someone down for your horses straight away - he’s very good and will care for them well, I assure you,’ the innkeeper said as he  tucked the coins away into a locked draw.</p><p align="left">‘Thank you,’ Severus replied.</p><p>The innkeeper smiled. ‘Is there anything else you might need?’</p><p>‘Yes. I would ask for a bowl of hot water and some strips of linen to be brought up to our room, shortly,’ Severus said, accepting the iron key the inn-keeper handed over, and ignoring the slight widening of the man’s eyes. ‘If you would tell me where to find my room, I shall fetch my companion and our belongings.’</p><p>‘Upstairs on the first floor, second door to the right.’ He hesitated. ‘If your friend is injured -’</p><p>‘I will care for him,’ Severus replied flatly.</p><p>The innkeeper nodded slowly. ‘I’ll go arrange for your dinner and other items.’</p><p>‘If you would.’</p><p>Severus watched the inn-keeper walk towards a dark-skinned serving girl and talk quietly to her for a moment, before he spun on his heel and made his way back outside, finding Lucius already dismounted and both their belongings in a pile on the ground. At his raised eyebrow, Lucius smirked, already reaching for his bags.</p><p>‘You wouldn’t have taken half so long if you weren’t arranging for rooms.’ He shrugged his broad shoulders and gifted the dark-haired man with a sharp smile. ‘Besides, I knew that you would find us room - even if you had to eject some other guests.’</p><p>Severus snorted softly, but did not deny it.</p><p>A small boy came scurrying out of the door, coming to an abrupt halt in front of them. He barely reached Severus’ chest; there was no way he’d be able to handle Lucius’ temperamental stallion and his own horse, no less vicious for being a gelding.</p><p>Severus’ lip curled slightly. ‘I do hope you’re not the one coming to care for our horses.’</p><p>The boy quirked a grin, clearly unfazed, and shook his head. ‘Nossir’, he slurred his reply into one word, ‘that’d be Harry. He’ll be down shortly - I’m just here to watch them until he comes.’</p><p>Severus hummed under his breath, somewhat mollified. He went to pick up his own bags, briefly contemplating whether or not to take their horses’ tack with them before deciding against it, knowing that no one would dare steal or damage it for fear of retribution. He stood, hefting the weight of his saddlebags. He took one of Lucius’ also, knowing the blond would not be able to carry the weight with his injured arm. With that, the two men quickly made their way inside once more, bypassing the barroom and its occupants and making for the stairs which would take them to their room.</p><p>Once inside, Severus glanced around, noting that it wasn’t as small as he had expected, though only just. The furniture was minimal: only a bed - one that was large enough for the two tall, well-developed men, he was grateful to see - a table, a chair and a small chest of drawers with a mirror on top, but everything was clean and in relatively good condition. Although there was no fire, the room was not cold - warmed, Severus presumed, by the heat from the barroom just below them.</p><p>Severus placed his bags on the floor just beside the table, before turning to his friend and lover, who was having some difficulty doing the same. So much movement had agitated Lucius’ shoulder, causing him to frown in pain.</p><p>‘Lucius, get out of that armour and let me see that wound,’ Severus ordered, briskly rummaging through his belongings in search of the leather case of healing implements he always carried with him. They’d get patching Lucius up out of the way before they enjoyed their dinner and retired for the night. He knew both of them could do with a good night’s rest.</p><p>Lucius nodded and reached over his shoulder one-handed, fingers scrabbling for the straps that would release the black-coloured metal of his armour, before a sharp stabbing pain caused him to grunt and abandon his attempt. With a low, frustrated growl he dropped onto the single chair the room held, the glare in his eyes warning Severus not to comment on his failure.</p><p align="left">With an amused smirk he couldn’t wholly suppress, Severus straightened from his position kneeling on the floor and made his way over to Lucius. Placing the bag gently on the table beside Lucius’ chair, Severus deftly unclasped the armour to reveal the black undershirt, damp with sweat and soaked with blood across one shoulder, the stain spreading down the arm. Lifting the armour up and away, he let it fall to the side with a dull clatter of metal on wood, before removing the shirt also and leaning forward over his friend in order to get a closer look at the wound.</p><p>‘It’s not too deep, you’ll be relieved to hear; the bleeding has already stopped. When the water I asked the innkeeper to have brought up arrives, I’ll wash the wound, sew it up, and put some poultice on it.’</p><p>Lucius nodded, his mouth tightening slightly. ‘It shouldn’t have happened in the first place.’</p><p>‘Hmm,’ Severus agreed, lightly running his long fingers across the edges of the wound, making sure he had missed nothing in his first glance. Being a warrior himself, combined with his considerable skill as a healer and his intimate knowledge of his friend’s body and its capabilities, he was sure his initial assessment was correct, but experience had taught him that it never hurt to be absolutely certain. Nodding to himself, he straightened and turned to his satchel, rummaging through it for the items he knew he would need. ‘Be that as it may, Lucius, it did happen, and it would be well for us to find out why - and it would do well for you to keep pressure on that wound.’</p><p>Lucius sighed softly in annoyance but complied, placing his palm over the wound; at the same time he took a deep breath and expelled it slowly, relaxing muscles tensed from anger.</p><p>‘We knew this task wasn’t going to be the easiest,’ Severus continued, ‘what with the little amount of information granted to us and the nature of the task itself. Two Death Eaters in the heart of Gryffindor lands was bound to attract trouble, no matter that we’re keeping a low profile. You’re lucky they were neither skilled, nor determined to do us that much harm. I suspect they merely wanted to show us we were...less than welcome here.’ His tone was mocking.</p><p>‘Well they certainly managed that,’ Lucius said, still disgruntled by the ambush.</p><p align="left">Humming in response to his friend’s words, Severus set about removing his own armour, stretching out the kinks in his back garnered from a long day’s ride and the earlier skirmish. He could well understand Lucius’ anger - directed more to himself than anyone else.</p><p align="left">From an early age Slytherins learned the skills necessary in order to survive in a land that thrived on intrigue and power, status and connections. They learned how to lie, how to manipulate, how to safeguard themselves from attacks - physical, and the less obvious political or social attacks that had so characterised the Slytherin Court for centuries. They learned wariness, ruthlessness, how to exploit weakness and turn their own faults into strengths. For Lucius, the threats increased tenfold: as the Commander of the Dark Lord’s Death Eater Armies, his position was coveted by many, people who would stop at nothing to gain their desire. Due to his precarious position, his intelligence was remarkable, his skills in war nearly incomparable, honed as they were from time and need. The fact that he had found himself unprepared for a small rabble - albeit in Gryffindor lands - had obviously shaken him, and if there was anything Lucius hated, it was being bested.</p><p align="left">‘In any case, you were not fatally wounded, and at least we now know to be wary of another attack. We’re getting closer to the place where the Hollow is meant to reside - for all that the locals denied any knowledge of it when asked before, I suspect that some of them <em> do, </em> in fact, know or suspect what it is we are after,’ Severus said. ‘We can begin asking around tomorrow. It will have the added benefit of giving your shoulder enough time to rest, and me a few nights <em> not </em> spent sleeping on cold ground out in the open.’</p><p>Severus heard Lucius chuckle, knowing well Severus’ unconcealed dislike for discomfort - an unfortunate trait in a soldier, but one that was overlooked in favour of the knowledge he brought to the Death Eaters. The blond’s anger had faded at last, and Severus could see his eyes beginning to wander around the small room.</p><p>‘The last few villages we passed through were rather unhelpful, to say the least: what makes you think this one will be any different?’</p><p>‘I don’t know.’ Severus turned to look out of the window, one hand resting gently on the sill, his eyes drawn by the scene before him: their room was at the front of <em> The Gryffin’s Claw </em>, their window overlooking the wide street with its rows of cottages, a sprinkling of lights appearing now that dusk approached. There were trees in the distance, a dark silhouette against the orange sky. Just below, he could see a group of men - young men, he surmised, what with the way they were laughing and joking with each other, now and again breaking into a scuffle on their way to the inn. They passed from his line of sight, but he could still hear the bang of the door closing, and the sudden increase in noise below his feet, their loud voices joining with the soft murmur from the main tavern room. Their horses were no longer outside either, Severus surmising they’d been taken away.</p><p>He was pulled away from his reverie of the village by a brusque knock on the door. Moving his hand to grip the hilt of the sword still at his waist and turning to face the door he called ‘Yes?’</p><p align="left">‘I have the water and bandages you requested, sir, and dinner,’ a voice replied, muffled slightly by the door.</p><p>‘Very well - come in,’ Severus ordered.</p><p>He didn’t relax his grip until the door opened and he could see the young man on the other side; he held a tray in each hand - one covered with plates, the other supporting a small basin filled with water, next to it some clean white towels.</p><p>Severus glanced over the young man in swift appraisal, noting the broad well-defined chest of someone used to hard work, sun-kissed skin and messy black hair, and last of all, unusual deep, green eyes. Overall, he was a rather attractive individual, and not a common sight in backwater taverns such as this.  </p><p>‘Where do you want me to put it?’ the boy asked.</p><p>At his words, Severus nodded towards the table next to Lucius. ‘Over there will be fine.’</p><p>The boy nodded and crossed the room with ease and confidence - none of the subservience or hesitation usually inspired by Death Eaters shown if he felt it. He rested both trays on the table while he unloaded their contents, before picking them up once more - his every move watched closely by the blond man sitting next to him. He turned to Severus.</p><p>‘Is there anything else you need?’</p><p>‘No, you may leave,’ Severus dismissed him.</p><p>The man nodded and quickly made his way out of the room, shutting the door quietly behind him. Neither Severus nor Lucius said a word or made a move until the door was firmly closed and they could hear the man’s footsteps start down the corridor.</p><p>Lucius let out a low whistle, and Severus turned to him with an arched brow, moving towards the bowl of water and efficiently wetting the cloth in order to wash away the dried blood on Lucius’ shoulder. He could see the spark of interest that had lighted the blond’s eyes on seeing the green-eyed serving boy, and recognised the slow grin that was stretching Lucius’ lips.</p><p>‘My, my Severus. I have a sudden feeling that the short while we’ll be here won’t turn out to be so dismal after all.’ The gaze levelled at the door where the young man had gone through was contemplative.</p><p>Severus snorted. ‘I’m sure.’ His tone grew more serious. ‘Now: hold still so I can sew up this wound.’</p><p>‘You’d better be more gentle than last time,’ Lucius demanded with a scowl.</p><p align="left">Severus’ chuckle was less than reassuring. ‘But Lucius, I do so like to make you squirm.’</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">- l  e   r o  i -</p><p align="center">d  e  s</p><p align="center">- m  a  s  q  u  e  s -</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">Harry jumped the last few steps of the stairs, landing with a dull thud on the wooden flooring of the hallway, passing through the wide doorway that led to the main barroom, where he could hear the loud talking and hearty laughter of the <em>Claw’s</em> patrons. He skirted around the various people milling around the room, waving to a group of friends sitting and drinking in the far corner, and passing Padma on her way to the kitchen with a platter stacked with empty plates. He finally made it to the bar, depositing his own tray on the side as he ducked under the hatch and took his place behind the thick wooden structure, just in time to receive an order from one of the men who had entered the inn.</p><p>As he was pouring the ale into a glass tankard, Harry glanced over the barroom, not surprised on seeing it so busy this time of year, when the people of the village liked to gather together before the huge roaring fire that warmed the room pleasantly; it was a welcome relief to the chill that was steadily descending as winter drew closer. The busyness was the reason why Harry was now serving behind the bar as opposed to keeping to the stables as he normally would. He smiled as he handed over the drink and accepted the customer’s money, slipping it into the leather pouch at his waist.</p><p>‘Enjoy your evening,’ he said pleasantly, as the man picked up his ale and turned away to find a seat at one of the tables around the room.</p><p align="left">‘Harry - hey - hand me that glass over there.’</p><p>Harry turned his attention to the woman addressing him, and reached for the item she had asked for, handing it over with a small grin. Angelina Johnson was only slightly older than he was, with an attractive face and long dark hair. The daughter of one of the village’s farmers, she was a tall, tough woman, who took no nonsense from those she served while working in the bar. As a child, she’d always joined in the boys’ games, preferring them to the apparently frivolous pursuits favoured by the other girls, and had always been a good friend to Harry.</p><p>A short while later when there was a lull in their work and the two of them were occupying themselves with cleaning the counter and rearranging some of the used glasses, Angelina turned to him.</p><p>‘Harry - Missus ‘Beth was asking for you earlier - wanted you to go see her in the kitchens as soon as possible.’</p><p>Harry nodded, putting down the cups he had been holding. ‘You can manage?’</p><p>‘Of course!’ Angelina grinned, swatting him playfully with the towel in her hands, as he hurriedly moved away, under the hatch and towards the archway.</p><p>Going along the corridor, he started down the small number of stone steps that led him to the kitchens - his mother’s domain, just as the barroom was his father’s.</p><p align="left">Harry entered the kitchen and looked around the square, basement-like room, with its long wooden table in the centre, and various counters and stoves lining the walls. A huge fireplace took up a large part of the left wall, and Harry could see the remains of a roast pig still on the spit. A door leading to the back courtyard and the stables beyond was in the far right corner. He could see Padma washing a stack of dishes in the large stone sink to one side, while her sister Parvati was tending to a bubbling pot of stew. His mother, meanwhile, had her back to him, her curly brown hair braided and pinned up, and was making the final preparations on one of her creations.</p><p align="left">His lack of blood relation to the woman who had found him abandoned as a baby had never been kept a secret - either from him, or others in the village which had been his home for as long as he could remember. For all they’d already had a daughter, he had been welcomed into heart and home, never in doubt that he was cherished by those he called his parents - for if there was one thing that Robert and Elizabeth Granger valued, it was the importance of family. They’d taken him in, raised him and loved him; they’d been a constant source of strength throughout his life, offering acceptance and freedom no matter what they had been faced with - a godsend, as it happened, with the unexpected tragedy and revelations that had befallen them.</p><p align="left">Smiling mischievously, Harry slowly crept towards his mother, wrapping his strong arms around her still-slim waist and lifting her easily into the air. She let out a cry of surprise, her hands gripping his forearms. He settled her down on her feet once more, taking the opportunity to grab one of the biscuits from the tray in front of him, and popping it in his mouth.</p><p>The affectionately nicknamed “Missus ‘Beth”  turned to him, attempting to conceal the amusement on her face. Though her face was lined with age, her smile was still beautiful, her honey-coloured eyes affectionate as they looked up at him from her much smaller height.</p><p>‘Harry Granger - how many times do I have to tell you not to sneak up on me like that? You have no idea what I could have been holding!’ She paused, narrowing her eyes. ‘Do you hear me?!’</p><p>Harry hummed in agreement, quickly reaching out to snag another biscuit, sending his mother his most innocent look.</p><p>She sighed in fond exasperation, smiling at his well-known antics. ‘You never change.’</p><p>Grinning, Harry leaned down and placed a swift kiss on her cheek. ‘You wouldn’t have me any other way.’</p><p>Elizabeth laughed. ‘No, I suppose I wouldn’t.’</p><p align="left">Harry straightened, satisfied that he’d done his filial duty of being annoying and making his mother laugh. ‘Now, what was it you wanted to see me about?’</p><p>Elizabeth’s smile faded, and she glanced quickly towards the Patil twins, addressing them quickly. ‘Padma, why don’t you leave that for now, take a break and finish it later. You too Parvati, the stew can be left for a few minutes.’</p><p>The two girls sent curious glances in Harry’s direction, but did as they were bid, leaving their tasks and making their way out of the kitchen, shutting the door behind them.</p><p>Harry turned back to his mother, feeling slightly ill at ease now. ‘What is it?’ he asked worriedly.</p><p>‘It’s about those two men who came tonight,’ Elizabeth said quietly, frowning slightly. ‘I don’t want you being around them.’</p><p>Harry relaxed at once, relieved it had been nothing more serious. This particular request had often been asked of him over the years - his parents’ way of protecting him against anyone who might cause him trouble. It had also been one of the reasons behind their decision to let Harry work in the stables as opposed to the barroom, except on nights like tonight when he was particularly needed.</p><p>‘Of course,’ Harry acquiesced at once. ‘You know the only reason I took the tray up tonight was because both Padma and Parvati were busy with other things.’ And his own curiosity, of course, but he deliberately didn’t mention that to his mother.</p><p>Elizabeth nodded, her worried look easing slightly, as if she had expected him to argue with her - not a wholly unbelievable thought, since Harry was known for his stubbornness and wilful thinking, especially where warriors were concerned.</p><p>‘Your father said that he thought they might be Death Eaters -’</p><p>‘They are,’ Harry interrupted, bringing to mind the picture of the half-clothed blond in the room upstairs. ‘One of them had the Mark on his arm.’</p><p>Elizabeth’s expression remained unhappy. ‘That just makes it worse.’ She sighed. ‘There’s something else.’</p><p>‘What?’ Harry asked apprehensively.</p><p>‘Padma overheard some people talking - one of the Creevy brothers I think it was - about a rumour that two warriors dressed in black have been travelling through Gryffindor lands, asking questions in each village they pass through - about the Gryffindor Royals and Godric’s Hollow.’</p><p>Harry nodded, his mouth tight. Although the name of Godric’s Hollow was virtually unknown to most - a myth about the place where the Gryffindor Royals had once resided in a time when magick had still existed throughout the Four Kingdoms - to a select few, however, it was also very near to the place where the infamous Order of the Phoenix had sequestered themselves, the rebel group trying to fight against the Dark Lord’s tyranny. Although not a member himself - being who he was, Harry had long since made a promise to stay as far away from politics as he could - he knew of several people in his village, and those surrounding it, who had connections to the Order.</p><p>‘Who was he talking to?’</p><p>‘Dean Thomas, Anthony Goldstein and that troublesome Smith boy, as well as a few others,’ Elizabeth told him, knowing just as well as he the significance of that.</p><p>‘Founder damn it,’ Harry muttered under his breath, lifting a hand to rub at his suddenly pounding head. Apart from the Creevey brothers - who were more likely to have been dragged or even threatened into joining in with whatever had been proposed rather than willingly coming up with the idea themselves - that particular group of boys were known for their rash behaviour throughout the nearby villages. They were all young and agile, cocky too - and unfortunately, they all had a desire to join the Order, which meant that they would do all that they could to prove themselves worthy.</p><p><em> And there are two Death Eaters right here in the village </em> , Harry thought, taking a deep breath. <em> Just great. </em></p><p>Sighing, Harry looked at his mother once more, knowing what was expected of him. ‘I’ll talk to them, try to make them understand that if they start anything, they might bring trouble to the village. Voldemort doesn’t take kindly to rebellion.’</p><p>‘Thank you, Harry.’</p><p>There was a hesitant knock on the door, and Parvati’s face peered around the edge..</p><p>‘’m sorry t’ disturb you, Missus ‘Beth, but Mister Tom be wanting his dinner - and Mister Robert says that he needs more wood for the fire.’</p><p>Elizabeth stepped away from Harry, immediately turning to grab a plate and a walking over to the stew, stirring it briskly. ‘Tell him right away, Parvati dear; I didn’t realise we’d taken so long.’</p><p>As Parvati and Padma returned to the kitchen to take up their work again, Harry made his way over to the back door, intending to gather some of the wood from the stockpile in one of the stable rooms.</p><p>‘Harry!’ Elizabeth called, and he glanced back at her. ‘Take care, love.’</p><p>He smiled briefly, and left the kitchen, thinking idly on his mother’s words.</p><p>Hedwig’s Nest had always been safe from the self-styled Dark Lord’s touch; it was one of the reasons the Grangers had settled there. Too far north in Gryffindor lands and too unimportant, it was a rare day that their normal way of life was interrupted, for which Harry and his family had always been grateful.</p><p align="left">Once his Gift of magick had made itself known and his true identity had been unquestionably revealed, the importance of avoiding undue attention had become paramount, his life and that of his family all of a sudden at risk.</p><p>Rumours of Voldemort’s dealings with the other Kingdoms were common: tales of imprisonment, torture, ruthlessness and depravity; how much of it was true, Harry couldn’t begin to say, but he’d seen the touches of the Dark Lord’s rule in the towns nearby, whenever he’d visited for markets and trade.</p><p>Those marked as Death Eaters were uncommon in the outreaches;  hired mercenaries were far more likely to be present. They claimed it was to maintain order, but in reality it seemed like just an excuse to abuse power.</p><p>The fact there were Death Eaters here now, in his village, in his home, did not sit well with him.</p><p>Stepping into the main room, he saw Anthony and Zacharias seated at a table, laughing and drinking along with some of the other younger men of the village. They were high in energy tonight, Harry could see it in their flushed faces and bright eyes, and it made him uneasy.</p><p>Taking position beside Angelina, Harry nodded in their direction. ‘What has them so worked up?’</p><p>Angelina grimaced, clearly unimpressed, leaning her elbows on the counter. ‘Don’t know, but I’m sure it’s not good news.’</p><p>‘Hmm,’ Harry agreed, then turned to greet another customer.</p><p>Harry was kept busy on the bar for another hour or so, before finally being released to make his final checks on the stables. He paid extra care to the two horses that had come in that night, acknowledging and respecting the fine-bred steeds, even if he felt unsure of their masters. He made sure they had extra hay and water, and patted his own horse goodnight before locking up.</p><p>As he was exiting the stables, he caught sight of Zacharias again, leaving the tavern on his own and meandering slowly towards home. Jaw firming slightly, Harry went towards him, intending to make good his promise to his mother.</p><p>He caught up with him at the side of Old Figg’s house. ‘Zac, I’d like a word, please.’</p><p>Zac turned round, not looking particularly happy to see Harry, but not unwelcome either. They’d grown up with each other and even if they’d never become friends, in such a small village, loyalty was expected. ‘What do you want?’</p><p>Harry was attempting to figure out the best way to word his questions, when he caught sight of Zac’s arm, where small flecks of blood were starting to show through the white bandage wrapped around his forearm. Harry’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>‘How’d you injure yourself?’</p><p>Zac’s expression immediately became guarded, his already sharp face becoming more so. ‘Accident while chopping firewood,’ he replied, his tone daring Harry to challenge him on it.</p><p>Harry wasted no time in doing just that. ‘It wouldn’t have something to do with the injury that warrior was sporting?’ he asked suspiciously, even though he knew that asking was pointless; he already knew the answer.</p><p>Zacharias smirked and adopted a tone of utmost innocence. ‘I don’t know what you mean, Harry.’</p><p>Harry stepped forward, and Zac’s smirk dropped off his face and he tried to take a step back, his eyes showing alarm when he hit into the side of the house. He was smaller than Harry, and thin, and looked suddenly uncomfortable. He attempted to cover it with bravado, sticking out his chin and squaring his shoulders.</p><p>‘You don’t scare me.’</p><p>Harry gave a lopsided smile, but there was nothing friendly about it now. ‘I’m warning you, Zacharias. You and your friends are playing a dangerous game, with dangerous people, and you have no idea what kind of trouble you could bring down on yourselves – on this village.’ He stepped back. ‘Stay away from those men,’ he gave a final warning, and turned back to home.</p><p>‘We’re at war, Harry, even if you don’t want to admit it,’ Zac called from behind him. ‘And you won’t be able to stay out of it forever!’</p><p>Harry refused to look back. He doubted his words would have any effect; as was often the case, stubbornness and pride would always win out, and it would only be a harsh lesson of life that might put a stop to Zacharias’ foolishness.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>He could only hope the Death Eaters’ visit would be brief, and normality could return to Hedwig’s Nest – and his life.  </p><p align="left"> </p>
