    <p>Sorry, not going to post the first chapter just yet, I'm still writing. But I wanted to say that I <em>am</em> working on it, this series is not abandoned. I probably have more than half of this entire work written but I don't know how it ends yet so in case I need to add plot points in the beginning I'm going to finish it before I post anything. But then ya'll will have a better story to read, at least that's the idea.<br/>
-Dec 16 2018</p><p>Edit 5/12/19:<br/>Still not abandoned! Just very slow progress. I have written 10k words since the last update. It has more of a plot, is better written, and is longer already than the last one but it's still just scenes of the marauders and company just being like, alive and together through thick and thin, ya know? Minus Peter, because he doesnt exist. The first was really a prequel to this one, this was the original idea I had but then I wanted to write a bunch of scenes from their school years that lead up to the events in this one. I'll have more time this summer to make significant progress. Maybe even finish it!</p>
