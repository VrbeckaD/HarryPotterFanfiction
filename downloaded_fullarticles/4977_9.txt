    <p>Thanks to everyone who reads and to my beautiful beta, peskipiksi! This is JKR's playground, I just stopped by to swing a while...</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>King Arthur was dead. The sword, Excalibur, was broken and back in the keeping of the Lady of the Lake, its scabbard having long been lost and returned to the fey people. The Round Table was destroyed, and darkness once again crept across the land. A group of five handmaidens and one knight, sworn to the service of the Lady of the Lake, held in their safekeeping another of the magical weapons Nimue had trusted to Arthur and his advisor, the Wizard Merlin. As wars wrought havoc across the lands of Britain and the Old Ways were pushed further and further into legend, these five priestesses hid the dagger, Carnwennan, slayer of the Very Black Witch, against the day that it would be needed again. Nimue charged her ladies and knight to do what was necessary to protect the dagger across the ages from those unworthy to wield it. </p><p>Fleeing the Battle of Camlann and the fall of Camelot, the Guardians used both magical and mundane methods to travel the length of the British Isles. They searched for two years before finding a place as far removed from Camelot as possible that would shelter the dagger in their keeping. Using the strongest magic they possessed, the five Keepers created a new home and hid it away. Over time, the eldest of the ladies joined with the Knight and a son was born. Each first born son of this line, marked by a dagger tattoo, stood as Knight of Carnwennan from that moment forward. Magic led the other ladies to bloodlines that would strengthen their progeny and the protections of the dagger, and the eldest daughter of these four lines would always, when she came of age, be summoned to the The Vale of the Carn. It was a jewel hidden in the farthest reaches of Scotland, tucked away from mudane eyes by thick forests and craggy mountains. Only those that had the blood of The Five could find and enter the vale. </p><p>It had been several generations now, since the last full gathering of the daughters of The Five and their Knight. Only in the direst of times was the Carn to be called. Only three times since it was hidden, had the dagger been summoned and used. Over the years, legends faded out of mind and into the mist. The Old Ways were no longer practiced the way they were intended, the call was being ignored. For years, those with the blood turned away from their purpose, and eventually there were none left who could even remember stories of the Five or the Vale or Carnwennan. Even when the Dark Lordling, Grindelwald rose, the call was not recognized and the Vale lay undisturbed and untouched. Now, darkness was again crawling over the earth, both in the mundane and magical worlds. This time, the evil was imbued with ancient, dark magic, an new incarnation of that originally destroyed by King Arthur and Carnwennan, and one strong enough to disturb the slumber of the Nimue. </p><p>Nimue, the Lady of the Lake and Guardian of the weapons of King Arthur, crossed the mists from the Isle of Avalon and called to the spirits of The Five and their Knight. In turn, the restlessness reached out through the bloodlines and reached the Daughters of the Elements. It was time; they were being summoned. Carnwennan was needed once more. </p><p>*****</p><p>Light flooded through the double stained glass window that dominated the far left corner of the Headmaster's office. Even though it was the depths of winter and heavy snow fell from a leaden sky, charmed sunlight fell in a jeweled pool around the young woman ensconced in the small window seat. She sat at an angle, head bowed, face hidden by a fall of dark, curly hair. A long cloak covered the rest of her small figure, hiding all but the strongest of the tremors that wracked her body. Even in the warmth of Hogwarts, she couldn't escape the cold. Behind her and to the side stood an imposing figure in black, the puddle of prismed light doing nothing to relieve the austerity of his severe countenance. The only intimation that the two were even real was the occasional touch of the man's hand to his companion's shoulder and the resultant nods as he spoke softly into her ear. </p><p>The Headmaster's office soon became a hive of activity as members of the Order of the Phoenix began arriving for a meeting. It was almost the end of Christmas hols, and this was the safest place for a large meeting as Kreacher the house-elf had recently disappeared, and no one was sure if he had gone to Bellatrix Black and Voldemort or if he was dead. His mutterings and dire imprecations had hinted all to often at his loyalties, so most thought he had joined his favored mistress with the Death Eaters. In all honesty, no one was too terribly distraught when he was found to be gone. However, until further notice, Number Twelve Grimmauld Place was off limits to everyone. </p><p>Slowly, the office filled and in the midst of all the greetings and conversations, the two people by the stained glass window were finally noticed. However, it wasn't until Professor McGonagall called for refreshments and the house-elves appeared that the couple garnered any real attention. They held themselves aloof from all but Winky, the elf that served them tea, and it didn't take very long for anyone to recognize the man as Severus Snape. The woman's identity was speculated on quite loudly, but not many in the room were brave enough to question the Potions master as to who his companion was, and her seat was far enough out of the way of the tangle of people that no one could get a good look anyway. </p><p>"Reckon he got himself a girl, Harry?" Ron Weasley sniggered through a mouthful of shortbread. "Can't imagine any girl wanting to keep him company without some incentive!" Ron rubbed his fingers together in a motion that suggested money.</p><p>Harry scoffed, "Not likely she's with him, even if he paid. Probably some poor girl the Death Eaters threw away."</p><p>"Nah, they don't let them go, you know that." Ron cocked his head in Snape's direction. "Probably somebody Dumbledore wants the Order to protect. Snape hasn't got family of his own that we know of, so it can't be that. Bet she'll be glad to see the end of the greasy git, though. From what I can tell, she doesn't look too excited to be here."</p><p>Harry shrugged the female off as unimportant and turned to speak to Remus Lupin who had just come through the Floo. Remus didn't know anything about the young woman either, so speculation continued during the various exchanges between Order members. No one knew anything at all about the girl, so talk soon turned to Christmas and school amongst the ladies, and Quidditch amongst the men. Chatter was soon ended when Albus Dumbledore entered the room in a flurry of shocking green robes. </p><p>"Welcome all, to Hogwarts. I hope everyone is enjoying a wonderful Christmas holiday. I am delighted that we could arrange this meeting, though. We have some news that will certainly be a joy to everyone, and we also have information that we could soon be seeing an end to this miserable war." Dumbledore nodded to Harry. "Are you ready, my boy? We have had a breakthrough and have discovered something that could end this conflict once and for all!"</p><p>The Headmaster's declaration was met with an excited buzz throughout the room. An end to the war at last! Harry returned the Headmaster's nod. </p><p>"Sir, I am as ready as I will ever be. I trust that you have found exactly what we need."</p><p>"Hear, hear!" Arthur Weasley offered. "It is past time to avenge those we've lost."</p><p>The room quieted a bit as the Order members thought about friends and family that they had lost over the past few years. The most recent ones, of course, were the freshest wounds that still had the power to cause tears.</p><p>Harry started to speak again, but the Headmaster forstalled him. "We must hear from Severus. I am afraid he has gathered his information quite dearly, and we are now without our most trusted ally in Voldemort's camp." Albus motioned for the dark man to join them. "Severus... "</p><p>Potions master Severus Snape made an impression no matter where he was or who he was with. Even those who had known him for years were still awed by his movements and his voice. He strode surely towards the group and addressed Dumbledore, handing him a scroll with a green wax seal on the side.</p><p>"Before we begin, I must verify to everyone that we have been discovered, Headmaster. I knew that Bella was getting close, and it was her group that tracked us to the lodge in the Vale. Despite the precautions I took, they realized it was I who was passing information. With Lucius' help, I was able to cover my duplicity so that the Dark Lord still doesn't believe Bella, but she wouldn't hesitate to kill me or my family. Hermione and Alexander are no longer safe. I... "</p><p>His next statement was drowned out by shouts from Ron and Harry, who threw themselves towards the woman now sitting alone staring out of the window. Before they could even approach the window seat to see for themselves that their friend was truly alive, Snape had moved between them and their quarry. Both boys protested loudly, backed by the other Order members, but the Potions master was adamant that they stay away. Harry and Ron were so busy trying to force themselves to the window seat area that they never realized that the commotion caused was making the woman cringe back into the cushioned seat. </p><p>Harry was single minded as he tried to get to Hermione. All he could focus on was the girl he had thought dead. "Let me by, Snape!" he yelled, putting his shoulder down and pushing into the taller man. "It's Hermione!"</p><p>"Potter, control yourself," Snape hissed. "Do not upset her. STAY BACK!"</p><p>Severus looked sharply towards the Headmaster. "I thought you were going to let them know about Hermione before the meeting. If I had known you hadn't, I would have left her with Poppy."</p><p>Dumbledore merely shook his head and answered, "I didn't have the opportunity, but I think you have done a fine job of telling the news yourself."</p><p>Other Order members led by Molly Weasley pushed forward behind Harry. "Severus, you must let us see to her, the poor dear." Molly got by Severus as he was trying to hold off Harry and Ron. She reached Hermione and stooped to gather her up in a bone-crushing hug. A small, keening cry and struggle was the reaction that she got,and Molly quickly backed away, glancing fearfully at Snape and the Headmaster. </p><p>"What has happened to her, Albus?" Molly began to cry softly. Arthur pulled her away, and the others followed suit, leaving only Harry and Ron still trying to get to Hermione.</p><p>"Everyone, please, all will be divulged. For now, just know that Hermione has been through quite an ordeal since the attack on her family a year and a half ago. She will need time to readjust to all of us. Please, give her that time," the Headmaster soothed. </p><p>Nearly everyone accepted that statement and let the situation go, still curious, but trusting that the Headmaster was in control, even if they still didn't fully trust the Severus Snape. </p><p>Remus was the first to address the situation calmly. "What has happened to her, Albus?"</p><p>Before either he or Snape could answer Ron began yelling and waving his wand. "What is wrong with 'Mione? What have you done to her, you bastard?"</p><p>Dumbledore stepped in, grasping Ron by the arm, "Mr. Weasley, Severus has done nothing wrong and things will be explained shortly, but we have a meeting to attend to first. I am afraid that Severus' tale is going to be time consuming and we MUST be prepared for the final confrontation. I also require your respect towards the professor. Mind your language." </p><p>Both Harry and Ron backed away reluctantly, and the Order meeting began again, even though most of the room's occupants were more interested in the story surrounding Snape and Hermione. The pseudo-peace remained while the meeting wound down, until a small house-elf popped into view in front of Snape.</p><p>"Posey is so sorry, Potions master, but Little Master is being hungry, he is." </p><p>Severus sighed audibly. "It's fine, Posey, I will see to my son."</p><p>He gracefully bent and took the green swathed bundle that lay squirming in the small elf's arms. When he had the bundle secure, Posey Disapparated, and Severus turned towards Hermione, intending to give her charge of the baby. There was stunned silence as the Order members registered what they had seen. Seconds later the room erupted again.</p><p>"You bastard! What did you do to 'Mione?"</p><p>"Headmaster, explain!"</p><p>"What is the meaning of this, Severus?"</p><p>"Albus?"</p><p>Above the din, the sound of a baby's cry was heard. Harry jumped forward, wand out. Even with his arms full of his son, Snape whirled on Harry, wand visible from beneath the baby's blanket.</p><p>"What have you done, Snape?" Harry snarled.</p><p>Harry made another sudden movement towards the Professor. However, before he could reach Snape, a body had moved between Harry and his target. Gone was the quiet figure of earlier. Harry was taken aback by the sheer anger and fear that exuded from Hermione as she positioned herself between Harry and Severus.</p><p>"Stay away from my family!" Her voice was rough and low, almost strained, as if rarely used. Instinctively, everyone moved forward the better to hear the exchange.</p><p>Harry inhaled sharply at Hermione's demand. "Your family? They're dead, or have you forgotten about that? And what about me? I thought we were family, too." The snarl was back on Harry's face, and he didn't notice the pain on Hermione's. "Get out of my way, 'Mione."</p><p>"I am going to kill you." This was directed at Severus. "What have you done to her?" Harry roared again.</p><p>Without letting Snape or Hermione respond, Remus Lupin stepped forward to restrain Harry. No one, not even Severus could have anticipated the reaction Hermione would have to this. She went from defiant to hysterical in seconds. She backed suddenly into Snape, trying to get away from the danger that she perceived, and the fight went out of her quickly, leaving her weak. Taking advantage of this turn of events, Harry quickly moved forward, Remus close behind. A swirl of black robes enveloped Hermione and Snape had himself ready to take the brunt of any attack or movement against her or the baby. </p><p>"ALBUS!" Snape thundered. "She has had enough. Get Lupin and Potter away from us. NOW!" Snape didn't turn to acknowledge the Headmaster, but bellowed again, this time for Posey the house-elf. As soon as she appeared, he thrust the baby towards her and sent her to the window seat. "No one touches my son but his mother or myself," he ordered the elf. With his burden gone and in capable hands, Snape was able to tend to Hermione.</p><p>The Headmaster immediately went into action also. "Agreed, Severus." He looked around at the people filling his office. "Harry, Remus, sit down. Everyone else, hold your questions for now." </p><p>Harry began to protest along with Ron and Molly, but Dumbledore had decreed the matter closed. "SILENCE!" he shouted. "We will explain things as soon as Hermione and Alexander are seen to." Dumbledore turned to Harry. "I am ashamed of you. She is supposed to be your friend."</p><p>Harry had the sense to look chagrined. "Sorry, Headmaster."</p><p>"I am not the one who deserves your apologies." Dumbledore looked around the room again. "We will be patient until Severus is free to answer questions. Remus, perhaps you will Floo-Call Poppy and ask her to come here. Tell her Hermione has had a shock."</p><p>Remus nodded and glanced sadly towards Hermione. "I didn't intend her any harm. I just wanted to keep Harry from doing something he would regret. Do you know why she reacted like that, Albus?"</p><p>"Don't worry, Remus, it is not you that scared her. We will explain everything as long as everyone promises to control themselves."</p><p>Remus agreed, then turned to go to the fireplace. As he Floo'd Poppy, he heard the others agree to the Headmaster's terms, even though there were many protests. As for himself, he was willing to agree to most anything just to find out why his presence had disturbed someone he thought of almost as a daughter. </p><p>While the Headmaster continued with Order business, Severus knelt before the window seat where Hermione sat trying to control her breathing. "Are you alright, my love?"</p><p>Hermione nodded as her anxiety attack began to ease. "I'm so sorry, Severus." She whispered tearfully. "Professor Lupin is in the room, isn't he?"</p><p>"Yes, my dear. I should have thought to let you know that he would be attending. But I never dreamed you would react as you did."</p><p>"No, it isn't your fault. I need to regain control of myself. It's been almost two years. I am of no use to you or Alexander if I can't."</p><p>Severus touched Hermione's cheek. She looked up into his face even though she couldn't see him. "We will sort this out, Hermione, the anxiety attacks, the curse, your friends. It will all work out." </p><p>She nodded. "I have every faith that you will fix things."</p><p>Severus flashed a rare smile, then settled Hermione back into the cushions using a simple spell to transfigure them into something more plush and comfortable. He beckoned Posey and quietly took the baby from her. "Thank you, Posey. We will call you if we need you."</p><p>The elf nodded and Disapparated once again. When she was gone, Severus settled the whimpering Alexander into his mother's arms. "I believe the little monster is hungry again." Severus said. "Bottomless, that one."</p><p>Hermione laughed softly. "I think you're right." </p><p>She looked down shyly, "will you help me to settle him? I still haven't gotten the hang of getting him to latch on correctly." Rosy color stained her cheeks and tears welled up in her eyes. "I can't even take care of my own son, Severus. What if I never regain my sight?"</p><p>Severus began unbuttoning her robes. "Poppy told you it could take several tries to get it right. You and Alex will get the hang of this. He isn't even forty-eight hours old yet, my dear." </p><p>He adjusted the baby in Hermione's arms so that he was nestled against her bared breast. Severus' long fingers gently guided the hungry child to her now leaking nipple. She started as Alexander began to suckle, then settled into the plush cushions allowing him to nurse greedily. Severus watched mother and child until he heard his name being called. Madam Pomfrey had come into the office and wanted to see to her patients. Severus conjured a soft, woven shawl to drape over Hermione and Alexander so that her modesty would be protected. He didn't like the idea of anyone seeing his child feed from his wife. Once he was assured that both were comfortable and covered and in Poppy's capable charge, Snape stalked back to where the Headmaster was holding court. </p><p>He sneered at anyone who dared look him in the eye, then turned to address Dumbledore. "You know how I feel about discussing my private life, Albus, but for Hermione's sake as well as Alexander's, I will answer questions." His eyes flashed over the group, "within boundaries, of course... "</p><p>Albus nodded. "I am sure that Hermione's friends just want to assure themselves that she is OK, Severus. They don't really want to know details of your private affairs."</p><p>This was said while the Headmaster looked pointedly at Harry and Molly in particular. </p><p>"I was going to insist that we finish our Order meeting first, but I think that nothing would be accomplished if I did. Considering what Severus has to tell you is tied into being able to end this war, we will start with Hermione's story. These past two years have been hard on everyone, and seeing her alive has been traumatic in itself." Dumbledore addressed the Order, "You may ask your questions, but please be reasonable... "</p><p>The Headmaster gestured Snape to a chair and then opened the floor to anyone who had questions. In the beginning, it was chaos until Snape took matters into his own hands and bellowed for everyone to shut up. "I will tell you what I can, and you will be silent or I will not say another word on the topics of my wife or my son."</p><p>Harry looked quite rebellious at that, but Remus managed to keep him from offending the Potions master anymore than he had already as Severus began to speak.</p>
