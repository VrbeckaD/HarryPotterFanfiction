          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco loved being tall. It meant he could look down on people (Potter) and people (Potter) had to look up to him in turn. And he especially enjoyed teasing people (Potter) about how small they were.</p>
<p>“Did your stupid Gryffindor heroics stunt your growth?” he said when he passed Potter in the hallway.</p>
<p>Potter froze, and his face went blank.</p>
<p>“No, but the malnourishment did.”</p>
<p>Draco didn’t have a comeback to that. He hadn’t expected brutal honesty from Potter, and it made him want to take his words back. But before he could Potter had already disappeared around a corner.</p></div>
