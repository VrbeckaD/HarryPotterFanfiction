    <p>July 23rd, 1996 - Saturday<br/>
The changes started over the summer after fifth year. In the shower one morning I noticed some weird markings on my back, strangely that they only appeared after I had slept, the double take was all it took to sink in that I was yet again different and following this thought promptly fell on my ass. Faded grey lines and swirls covered my body but stopping at my ankles, wrists, and neck. Faded grey lines and swirls covered my body but stopping at my ankles, wrists, and neck.<br/>
    I ran a hand over my chest, the muscles tensing under my fingertips. I make sure I lock the door when I shower now, only unlocking it once I’m fully dressed, not too fond of my new tattoos. Maybe the Dursleys are right, I am a freak, or a freak among freaks I guess. I can only hope it doesn’t get worse. </p><p>July 24th, 1996 - Sunday<br/>
    Fuck me, it got worse. Everything aches between my shoulders and teeth, sweet fucking hell. Aunt Petunia keeps giving me strange tasks to keep me out of their house, such as bleach the gutters or whitewashing the fence. I mean, your white picket fence can never be too white. </p><p>July 25th, 1996 - Monday<br/>
    So, my back still hurts but my teeth may or may not have sharpened slightly, my canines more like vampire fangs. I run my tongue over one of them, shocked when they actually cut into my tongue. I have no idea what’s going on but I don’t think I want too at this point, if I’m honest. </p><p>July 26th, 1996 - Tuesday<br/>
    Things are stranger now. Tasks that used to leave me gasping for breath are now a breeze. It seems I’m also taller now, almost six foot if my measuring is right, plus all the muscles I earned from Quidditch are pronounced. My aunt keeps shooting me strange looks, as if she knows something, but I hope she’s as blind as ever.</p>
