    <p>"Abbott, Hannah!" Ron watched as the blonde haired girl anxiously stepped out from the crowd of fellow first years and made her way to the front of the room, climbing the few stairs that led to the stage that professor McGonagall was stood on. Infront of her was a simple wood chair, in her hands was a hat. The hat looked to be older than the teacher herself,  and the teacher was,,, well, 'mature' for certain. Hannah took a seat in the wooden chair and McGonagall lowered the hat onto the blonde's head. The hat only touched her before it belted out, with no doubt in its tone "hufflepuff!"</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
Ron was waiting impatiently for Harry's turn, wanting to know what house the legendary wizard would be placed into. He was sure he'd be placed into Gryffindor, every member of his family had been - although he really didn't want to be. Ron never saw himself as a Gryffindor, he wasn't brave nor cunning. The only Gryffindor trait he had was being short-tempered but honestly, anyone with 6 siblings would be short-tempered. </p>
<p><br/>
Ron wanted to be unique, he wanted to be the first Weasley to be placed in a different house, he wanted independence. He was sick and tired of being seen as just another red-haired, poor Weasley. He was his own person, he was Ron Billius Weasley, not just  ' a Weasley' but it was hard to have an identity when nothing about you, at least from the outside, was any different to everyone else. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Malfoy, Draco!" The cocky blonde haired, blue eyed boy made his way to the front of the group, making sure to barge into Ron as he made his way past, flashing the other an annoying, cocky smile. He sat down, not a sign of nerves on that boys face. The hat once again didn't take a long time at all,  the hat bellowing "Slytherin!" Before it was even placed on the boy's head. Ron almost admired Draco, the way Draco was so comfortable being himself, so cocky. Ron wished he could be like the other, he wished he was confident. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Weasley, Ron!"  Ron slipped past his fellow students, making his way through the crowd. He climbed up the stairs, his knees feeling weak, he was anxious. He couldn't give a reason as to why he was anxious because there really wasn't a real reason for him to be, he knew his destiny already. He sat down as he did his gaze fell upon his siblings, all seated at the Gryffindor table, their fiery red hair against the Gryffindor robes. It looked like it was meant to be, his destiny was planned out for him and it made him mad. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"<em>ah, yes, a Weasley. Gryffindor?</em>" The last thing Ron wanted was to be placed in Gryffindor, he was imagining himself throwing the hat across the room and turning it into a slug, only to step on the slug- "Slytherin!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>A wave of gasps echoed throughout the room, a few belonging to the teachers that all sat behind him. This was the last house he'd ever expect to be placed into, his family hated Slytherins. His father would tell him stories of how evil they all are, of how they were basically cultists who worshipped no one other than you know who! Ron felt all the blood leave his face, he felt faint, dizzy, like this was a bad dream he wouldn't wake up from. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Expressionless, Ron stood up and made his way to the Slytherin table, taking a seat as far away from everyone else as he could. Ron couldn't pay much attention to the rest of the ceremony and barely ever looked up from his plate as he ate. He was thinking hard, thinking about his future as a Slytherin, about how the green robes would look against his red hair. This is what he wanted and maybe his mother was right, he should really think about what he wishes for but maybe, just maybe, the emerald green would suit his hair just fine. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron looked up from his dinner plate, noticing that Crabbe was just about to take the last chicken drumstick with his grubby hands. There was no way he was going to let that chubby prat take the last, beautiful, juicy piece of chicken. Ron quickly reached over, stabbing  Crabbe in the hand with his fork before taking the last piece of chicken and placing it on his plate. The rest of the table looked at him with fear and Ron loved every single moment of it. </p>

</p><hr/>
<p>The Slytherin house captain was now guiding the first years through the castle and down to the dungeons. Ron stayed at the back of the group at all times, making sure to make mental notes of his surroundings as every corridor looked just like the last and he really doubted he'd ever be able to navigate through this castle properly on his own. He had a stern, almost intimidating look on his face, making anyone who looked at him feel intimidated. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron had decided that if he were to be a Slytherin he'd be the best damn Slytherin there ever was. He wanted to achieve greatness, many higher roles in society belonged to Slytherins, families who intimidated others like the Malfoys or Zabinis. </p>
<p>Finally, they were lead into the Slytherin common room. The room was dark, the furniture is mostly black with green velvet or silk finishings. The windows opened up to the lake, under the lake. All you could see was murky water and dim light shining in through the water and windows. The group were told that the occasional mermaid would swim past, maybe even look in through the windows. That gave Ron the creeps. </p>
<p>Ron's eyes scanned the room, a few of the older students were talking, catching up after not seeing each other for a few months. He overheard a girl talk about her vacation to Egypt, he wished he could go visit Egypt. Or anywhere. His eyes landed on a giant, grand chair that sat in the middle of the room. The chair had a very tall black, lined with beautiful green velvet and carved ever so intricately. Ron made a beeline towards that chair, throwing himself into it.   It was so comfortable, it felt as if the chair hugged him, welcoming him into the house. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They all kinda look the same, Ron thought. They're all pale, lanky, dead looking. Zabini was the only one who didn't act or look that way, dark skin and a decent personality. He probably has some good in his background, probably less inbred too. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron's eyes continued to scan the room until they landed on Draco, the first thing that stood out to Ron was the fact Draco's hair and skin were almost the same colour, they made his blue eyes stand out more than they usually would. His eyes were less of a blue and more of an icy grey, they felt cold. Heartless. He wondered if Draco was born that way or if some sort of childhood trauma caused him to be such a prat. Speaking of the devil, Draco was walking straight towards Ron, a smirk cocky smirk on his face. It was ugly. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Move. " Draco demanded, Gregory standing behind him, repeating what  Draco had already said "Yeah move, Weasel. " Ron just laughed, shaking his head, finding the pair to be nothing but stupid. What made those two idiots think he'd move just because they said so? That's kind of sad, if anything. It must be rough, growing up so privileged that you actually think people are going to do whatever you say? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron raised an eyebrow, tapping on the arm of the chair, a smirk on his lips. He was thinking hard about what to say, not wanting to say something stupid like the old Ron would have. Slytherin Ron was mature, smart, tactical.  This Ron had the gift of the gab. "I'm not moving, this is my chair. " He kicked the chairs matching ottoman to the side, patting on it, motioning for the other to sit. " There you go. "</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco hummed, flashing Gregory and Ron a glare, sitting next to the other rather obediently. Ron was not expecting Draco to actually do as he said but he wasn't complaining, this fueled his ego and superiority complex even more. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The rest of the night passed quickly, Ron sat and listened to the banter, everyone sitting around his grand chair. He felt superior. He felt at home. </p><hr/>
