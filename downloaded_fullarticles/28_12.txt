    <p>McGonagall wanted to go with him to retrieve Snape’s body. She’d seemed so earnest and remorseful, Harry couldn’t bring himself to say no to her, but she also couldn’t very well crawl with him through the tunnel to get to the Shrieking Shack. They’d had to go the long way around, through Hogsmeade, and thinking of all the things that could be happening to Snape’s body while they walked had had Harry clenching his teeth.</p><p>The Shack looked untouched though. At the very least the building wasn’t on fire, and Harry didn’t see any strange people hanging about, or any people at all. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He pushed open the front door and the coppery tang of blood hit his nose. Snape in his robes was like a melted candle against the far wall. And there was so much blood, a huge, dark pool under his body. Harry couldn’t quite tell where the puddle started and Snape’s robes ended.</p><p>“Oh, Severus.” McGonagall moved towards the man.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry wiped at his brow with the sleeve of his own filthy robes and followed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>They knelt beside him. McGonagall reached out and brushed wayward strands of hair from Snape’s closed eyes. Harry watched her hand as it retreated back into her robes for her wand. “Let’s bring him home, Potter. I’ll cast the levitation spell. If you would, please, help direct the body.”</p><p>Harry nodded and began to shift Snape’s legs and straighten his torso. The weight of each of Snape’s legs and the firmness of his torso threw Harry. He hadn’t expected Snape’s body to feel so real, he supposed. So human.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry picked up the fallen hand closest to him and laid it gently across Snape’s chest. He leaned across the body to bring the other hand up to tuck beside the first, but as Harry’s fingers wrapped around Snape’s wrist, the man’s hand twitched in his grip and Harry dropped it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Professor, I- I think his hand moved.”</p><p>McGonagall went to lay fingers against Snape’s neck but halted. There was no clear spot to check for a pulse. Harry swallowed and laid his own shaking hand to Snape’s chest. A flicker, maybe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I don’t-“ Harry shook his head. His eyes skated across Snape’s still face. Then he lifted the hand he’d just so carefully placed, bent over, and laid an ear against Snape’s sternum. And there, “Oh god. I think-” Harry’s breathing had gone funny, he was almost panting and he couldn’t hear over it. He held his breath, closed his eyes, and listened. And, yes, there, just there, was an unsteady, but present thump, thump. “Yes. Oh god. There’s a heartbeat.”</p><p>McGonagall said something, but Harry heard nothing except for the heart beating away beneath him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Fingers curled around Harry’s. He twisted his neck until he could watch as Snape’s blood-stained fingers tightened around his own. He’d placed the hand back down so he could listen to the man’s heart, but he’d never released it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry lifted his head, shifting his body until he was looking down on Snape’s face, nose to nose. Snape’s eyes were moving behind the fragile lids, a slight left and right, back-and-forth movement. Slowly, the lids parted, the lashes slightly stuck together with the salt of tears and sweat. The dark eyes beneath were glazed and took a moment to focus, but once they did, they locked onto Harry’s. Snape’s lips opened and Harry bent closer and waited, wanting to hear whatever Snape would say, but only a wet breath forced its way out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“It’s okay, Professor,” Harry said and curled his own fingers more tightly around Snape’s. “We’re going to move you, okay?”</p><p>Harry and McGonagall gathered Snape’s legs and his arms carefully together before levitating his body and turning it so he moved head first out the Shack door. McGonagall’s handwork was smooth and steady, but still Snape flinched. Harry brought his hands up, one on each side of the man’s face, hoping to support his ruined neck as he was jostled forward.</p><p>“We’re going to bring you back to the castle. It’s going to be okay.” It felt ridiculous, the inane chatter, but Snape kept looking at him, his eyes never leaving Harry’s. “Someone there will help.” Harry watched him right back. “You’re going be okay. I promise. You’re going to be okay.”</p><p>Harry kept up a steady litany of reassurance until Snape’s eyelids fluttered and his mouth went slack and he lost consciousness once more.</p><p>******</p><p> </p><p>Harry traced a vein on the back of Snape’s hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The hospital wing at Hogwarts was empty, or he’d never have dared.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Snape had lovely hands really. Harry had never bothered to notice before. They looked slight and delicate, clean, pale, but they were knuckly and calloused and long. They had a good inch on Harry’s, and the right one had a thick vein running down the back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry’s finger followed the vein up towards one knuckle and back down towards the wrist, pausing where it was most pronounced to feel the flutter of a pulse. Blood coursed there, warm and steady against Harry’s touch.</p><p>It’d been a week since he’d followed Snape’s floating body up to the hospital wing, a week since the Battle of Hogwarts, since he’d killed Voldemort.</p><p>"Still here, Mr. Potter?”</p><p>Harry pulled his hand into his lap as Madam Pomfrey went round to the opposite side of the bed. He nodded. “I want to be here when he wakes up.”</p><p>“So you’ve said.”</p><p>Harry pressed his lips together.</p><p>The mediwitch waved her wand over Snape. “And, as I’ve told you,” she continued while she watched spell light reveal the man’s vitals, “it will be quite some time yet.”</p><p>Harry nodded and laced his fingers together in his lap. “I’ll be out of your hair soon.”</p><p>“I never implied your presence bothered me.” She smiled at him. “Not at all, Mr. Potter.”</p><p>Harry watched as she strode back to her office at the front of the wing. His hand snuck back to Snape’s and the flicker of blood beneath pale skin. It amazed Harry to think of Snape as something human. Something like him. He swallowed and ran his finger up and down the vein again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>******</p><p> </p><p>Ginny was warm. Too warm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Or maybe it was just Harry. No one else seemed so effected.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He pulled at the collar of his shirt. Hermione’d told him he had to wear the button up for the funeral. Ginny pulled away as Harry tugged on the collar again. She glanced at him and then pressed her body back along Harry’s side and tightened her fingers around his.</p><p>Mr. Weasley stood in front of the small group gathered at the Burrow, thanking them all for paying their respects at the funeral and for joining them here for the reception after. Harry shifted, foot to foot, and yanked at his collar again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione turned her head and whispered in Harry’s ear. “Stop fidgeting.”</p><p>Keeping his voice low and his eyes forward, Harry replied, “I can’t help it. I’m hot.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Honestly, Harry.” Hermione clicked her tongue. “You’ve been a wizard for how long?”</p><p>Ginny made an amused noise, something between a snort and a chuckle, and nestled in closer. Harry blushed, though he imagined his face couldn’t get much redder, and cast a cooling charm.</p><p>Fred’s funeral was the first in a long line. He’d be attending one everyday this week. None of it felt real yet. Fred was gone. Remus was gone. Tonks. Colin. Lavender.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>But he was here. And so were Ron and Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>And Ginny. And Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.</p><p>Teddy.</p><p>Snape.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry planned to stay at the Burrow for now. Madam Pomfrey promised him that Snape would sleep through the week. It was a healing sleep. Snape had woken a few hours after he arrived at the hospital wing. His back had bowed off the bed and he’d screamed. Harry’d clutched at the man’s hand and said nonsense. A useless effort at calming him, telling him it was just the poison working its way out of his system, that Harry was there, that he’d be okay, he had to be okay. The wounds on his throat reopened and Harry sobbed and said more nonsense.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Madam Pomfrey had put him under then. She said it would be better this way. He could sleep and heal. He wouldn’t feel the pain and he wouldn’t hurt himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Harry.” Kingsley pulled him from his thoughts. He stood in front of Harry with his hand stretched outward.</p><p>Harry took it. “Minister.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Kingsley smiled, sadly, putting the appropriate amount of pity in for such an occasion. He reached towards Ginny. “I am so sorry for your loss, Miss Weasley.”</p><p>Ginny sniffed and shook the hand. Kingsley moved over to Hermione and Ron. Harry unlaced his hand from Ginny’s and wrapped his arm around her waist. His fingers came to rest on the hipbone hidden beneath her black robes. He traced it for a moment before pulling away entirely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The reception was just what Harry expected, somber and sad. Painful. He stayed near Hermione and Ron and Ginny for the hours it lasted. People approached him, thanked him, gave condolences, but his friends’ presence acted as a buffer against anything more intrusive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Then everyone left and it was just them. The Weasleys and Harry and Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry retreated to his bed. Well, his cot. The one set up in Ron’s room. Piled with faded quilts and fraying knitted blankets that smelled of cinnamon and dust. He laid his head on his pillow and turned on his side. He stared at the Cannons posters on the walls until his eyes lost focus and everything went blurry. He took his glasses off, tossing them on Ron’s side table so everything stayed that way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ginny joined him as the light dulled, curling on her side in front of him, facing the same blurry wall, now a burnt orange in the fading daylight. He had no idea what to do with his hands. They hovered over a thigh, a hip, a shoulder, until finally Ginny grabbed his fingers and brought them to her stomach. He laced his finger through hers and buried his face in her hair as she cried.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>******</p><p> </p><p>“You are coming to the Order meeting tonight, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry nodded and watched. McGonagall was brushing Snape’s hair. There was a spell for that, but she was doing it herself. She ran the comb through once more, patted down the flaring ends, and placed the brush back on the bedside table.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“We may have to cut it soon,” she said. “It’s getting longer than I know he prefers.”</p><p>Harry swallowed and nodded again. He wasn’t agreeing with her. He had no idea how long Snape liked his hair. Snape’s hair was never a thing he paid attention to. Like the man’s hands, it was just another ambiguous part of him. Greasy, black, long. That was all that came to mind. It was still black, still long, but not greasy at the moment. Probably because Madam Pomfrey kept a clean hospital wing, including her patients.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry wanted to reach out and touch it. Just to see.</p><p>He didn’t. McGonagall was there, sitting on the opposite side of the bed from Harry.</p><p>“I remember,” McGonagall said, “when he was small. Some students are simply,“ she looked at Harry, her brow rising, “smaller than others. And he was one of those tiny first years. They always have a harder time. And he was such a scraggly thing too.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She sniffed. “Ah, well.”</p><p>Harry watched Snape’s chest rise and fall. It had been a month now since the final battle. Snape had slept through the funerals, through the beginnings of the Ministry restructuring, through the rebuilding of Hogwarts. Snape was going to wake up to a whole new world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You know,” McGonagall continued, “he didn’t touch Albus’s rooms.”</p><p>Harry looked up.</p><p>“The quarters. They are exactly the same.” McGonagall met Harry’s eyes. “It eerie. Like a shrine.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The urge to reach for Snape’s hand was a force. Harry felt it in his shoulders, running down the length of his arms into his fingers. He needed. He clenched his fists into the fabric of his jeans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>******</p><p> </p><p>The Burrow was packed to the brim. Every chair at the kitchen table held a body. People lined the walls and filled empty spaces Harry didn’t know existed. The living room practically vibrated with all of the chatter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry and Ron sat on the second step of the stairs. Ginny and Hermione were tucked in just behind them. Neville, Dean, and Luna were standing in front of them, talking back and forth about something.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Pomfrey sat at the kitchen table between Flitwick and some witch Harry didn’t recognize. Harry could see them through the gaps in the stair railing.</p><p>“Stop jiggling, Harry.” Ginny wrapped her arms around Harry’s shoulders. “You’re making me nauseous.”</p><p>Harry stilled his leg. He hadn’t even noticed it was fidgeting. “Sorry.”</p><p>“Most likely I will,” Hermione said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry sighed and ran a finger through the pale, sparse hair on one of Ginny’s arm. The cool touch of lips pressed to his ear.</p><p>Neville asked, “What about you then, Harry?” There was a tone there. Harry couldn’t place it, but it’d been there since the Battle and, honestly, Harry couldn’t be bothered to figure it out just now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Neville was different. He was bigger in every possible way. He took up more space in the room and Harry didn’t know quite what to make of it. Harry shook his head at Neville and asked, “What about me what?”</p><p>Neville glanced at Ginny and Ginny leaned away from Harry a bit. “Hogwarts, Harry,” she said. “Weren’t you listening?”</p><p>“No. Sorry.”</p><p>“Leave ‘im alone. He was off in his own world,” Ron said.</p><p>“I wasn’t.” Harry grunted. “I just..”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Wasn’t listening.”</p><p>“Very helpful, Ron.” Harry pursed his lips. “What about Hogwarts then?”</p><p>Neville, looking annoyed at having to repeat himself, asked again, “Are you going back, to complete your last year?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry shrugged. “I haven’t thought about it really.”</p><p>Ginny pressed closer against Harry. “We’d be in the same year if you went back. We all would.”</p><p>“That’s convinced me then,” Ron said. “Auror training it is.”</p><p>Ginny kicked him.</p><p>“Ow! Jeez, Gin.” Ron glowered at her and nestled further back between Hermione’s legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I don’t know.” Harry glanced back towards the kitchen. Flitwick had stood up and moved off somewhere, leaving the seat next to Pomfrey free. Harry stood up, pulling out of Ginny’s loose hold.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Where are you going?” Ginny asked.</p><p>“I’ll be right back.” Harry threw over his shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He apologized as he pushed past people, tripping over the folds of a someone’s thick cloak and stumbling into a witch holding a cup of tea. He needed to get to the chair before someone else snatched it up.</p><p>He was out of breath when he finally plopped himself down and greeted the mediwitch. “Madam Pomfrey.”</p><p>“Mr. Potter.” Harry could have sworn there was a tone there too. He was pretty sure he knew what this one was though: annoyance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Sorry, I just, I was surprised to see you here.”</p><p>“Were you?” Madam Pomfrey arched an eyebrow. “I am an Order member. A long standing one.”</p><p>“No, no, I’m sure you are. I was just, I was wondering who was watching over, you know, Hogwarts, over Snape, if you and Professor McGonagall and everyone are here.”</p><p>Her eyes searched Harry’s. “He is perfectly alright, Harry. Fast asleep, just as you left him an hour ago.”</p><p>“I know, but-“</p><p>“The school is warded. So is the hospital wing.”</p><p>Harry swallowed. “Okay.” Harry settled back in his chair. He drummed his fingers on the table. “So he’s alone there?”</p><p>“No, I left my own personal house elf watching the hospital wing. I assure you, Severus is fine. And he will not waken.”</p><p>Harry nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>There were so many people in this room, this house. Someone behind him, Fleur it turned out, clocked him right in the head with her handbag. There was no way this was an efficient way for the Order to meet. Had they been squishing in spaces like this for the whole last year?</p><p>Harry rubbed the back of his head and scooted his chair in until his belly pressed against the table. “Maybe I should go. Just be with him.”</p><p>Pomfrey’s eyes were on him; Harry felt them and the judgment behind them. “It’s warded, Mr. Potter.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Against me?”</p><p>“Against all entry until Minerva returns.”</p><p>“Oh.” Harry looked at the clock on the wall. “Wasn’t this supposed to start already?”</p><p>A group of people across the table pulled Pomfrey’s attention away. Harry had no interest in what they were talking about. He looked over to the stairs. Neville had sat down in his place and Ginny was plaiting his hair. Dean and Ron were laughing about something.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Kingsley emerged from the crowd gathered by the sink and smiled at Harry as he raised his wand to his own throat. “If we could all gather closer to the kitchen here. I am pleased so many of you could attend tonight.”</p><p>The crowd shuffled around them. Harry heard something fall and break. Mrs. Weasley looked quite concerned and dashed off in the direction of the sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>When everyone seemed to settle Kingsley continued, “Lovely, lovely. We have grown so numerous.” Kingsley grinned and the crowd whooped. The corner of Harry’s mouth tugged upward as he glanced around at the room full of strangers. “We will need a new meeting place. Perhaps Hogwarts next time.” Another cheer went up. “Which brings us to the update stage of our meeting. Minerva, if you would.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>McGonagall gave a short speech. Hogwarts was on track to reopen in September. Something was said about staffing and curriculum. McGonagall was the new Headmistress; Flitwick was her Deputy. Harry looked at the clock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Someone from the MLE spoke about what was left of the Death Eaters. Harry’s brow wrinkled. He hadn’t even thought about the remnants of Voldemort’s ranks. He shifted in his seat and glanced back at Ron and Hermione. Hermione met his eyes. The Auror, Harry was pretty sure he was an Auror, gave an approximation of how many were out there in hiding. 12-20, was the MLE’s official guess.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“They are staying pretty low at the moment, committing petty offenses. They’ve defaced the Potter statue in Godric’s Hollow, we believe they torched Snape’s house, and they are likely responsible for a string of robberies in Sussex.”</p><p>Snape had a house? Well, of course, he had a house. That made sense.</p><p>Someone asked about the robberies. The Auror talked about staffing and cleaning out questionable recruits. Harry looked at the clock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Kingsley was up next. Harry paid just enough attention to gather the gist of it. Kingsley had been appointed acting Minister; Harry already knew that. An election would happen in the fall to-<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>fingers crossed- make it official. Something about a budget and reparations. Azkaban staffing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A whole new world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Anything you’d like to add, Potter?”</p><p>Harry looked at Kingsley, then he looked around the room at dozens and dozens of expectant faces. He looked back at Kingsley and asked, “Ah, sorry, what?”</p><p>“Do you have anything to add, to the meeting?” Kingsley gave an encouraging smile.</p><p>Did he? Should he have? “Um, no, I don’t think so.”</p><p>Kingsley kept looking at him. Everyone was looking at him. Harry glanced back over to Hermione. She met his eyes again. He could see the gears turning in her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Alright, then, Potter.” Kingsley nodded. He opened his mouth to continue, but then something did occur to Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Actually,” Harry stood, “I do have something.”</p><p>Kingsley gestured for him to continue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I want to clear Snape’s name.”</p><p>There was scattered muttering, of course.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Kingsley’s brow contracted, “Clear Snape?”</p><p>“Well, the Ministry. I want the Ministry to clear Snape. Completely.”</p><p>“He murdered Dumbledore,” the bloke from the MLE, the Auror, said. “The people won’t forget.”</p><p>"I don’t give a rat’s arse about the people. They’d all still be cowering in fear from Voldemort if not for Snape.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The muttering grew louder.</p><p>“We’ve all read the story you gave the paper, Potter,” Kingsley held up a hand to silence the room. “You are asking for a full pardon.”</p><p>“Okay. Yes. A full pardon. His actions must fall under some acts of war clause or something. He was only doing what Dumbledore told him to do.”</p><p>“What about after he killed Dumbledore?” That Auror bloke spoke up again.</p><p>Harry scowled at him. “After? Then he continued to help me, <em>us</em>, of his own free will. Of his own-“ Harry swallowed and licked his lips. “I could never have defeated Voldemort without Snape. Never. We are all here right now because of him. He is a hero.”</p><p>There was still murmuring hear and there. But this may have been the quietest the room had been all night. Harry looked at the clock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I will look into it, Potter,” Kingsley finally said, nodding. “Anything else?”</p><p>“No. That’s all I have.” Harry sat back down. Pomfrey placed a hand on his shoulder and squeezed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>There wasn’t any more updates it seemed, so Kingsley moved onto new business. Harry listened with half an ear. He didn’t know most of these people. And he hadn’t heard about most of their issues. He had no idea what most of them were talking about. He glanced back at Ron and Hermione and the rest of them a few times. Hermione looked to be soaking in everything like a sponge, Ron looked ready to fall asleep. Ginny met his eyes a few times and smiled, Harry returned each one.</p><p>Things wrapped up and Mrs. Weasley offered tea and coffee for anyone who wished. Harry found McGonagall in the crowd and moved towards her. She was already deep in conversation with two witches and a wizard, none of whom Harry recognized. Harry didn’t interrupt; he just stayed nearby, waiting. And that’s where Ginny found him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You staying?” She smiled and took Harry’s hands in hers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry squeezed her hands. “No. I’m going back to Hogwarts with McGonagall and Pomfrey.”</p><p>Ginny reared back, like she’d been slapped. “Why?”</p><p>Harry, boggled by her reaction, answered, “I just need to see something.”</p><p>“Snape.”</p><p>“Yeah, Snape.”</p><p>“He’s awake then?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“So you have to go and sit and watch him sleep.”</p><p>“Well, no, I don’t have to.”</p><p>Ginny’s face scrunched up and she shook her head.</p><p>“I mean. I’m not. I’m not going to just watch him sleep.” Not the whole time. Hermione had loaned him a pile of books. Honestly, he spent most of his time reading.</p><p>“I don’t understand.”</p><p>“Well, you don’t need to. There’s nothing to understand. He needs someone there. He’s-“</p><p>“He needs someone?” Ginny cocked her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry turned his head and pressed his lips together.</p><p>“Snape doesn’t need anyone, Harry. He’s Snape.”</p><p>Harry shrugged his shoulders and looked at the ground. “Yeah, I know.”</p><p>She was quiet so long Harry finally looked up. Ginny searched his face. Then she firmed up her grip and pulled Harry closer. “I miss you, you know.”</p><p>“I miss you too, Gin.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ginny pulled him in for a hug. Harry gladly returned it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw McGonagall walk away, heading for the door. He pulled out of the hug and moved to follow her. Ginny grabbed his elbow and yanked him back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Gin. I’ll see you soon. Promise.”</p><p>Harry gently pulled free. Ginny let him.</p><p>Harry made it out the back door in time to catch McGonagall. Flitwick and Pomfrey were standing just inside the wards waiting for her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Joining us again, Potter?” Flitwick smiled as Harry jogged to a halt beside them.</p><p>He smiled back. “Yeah.”</p><p>They all twisted away together and landed at the gates of Hogwarts with one loud pop. McGonagall loosened the wards and they all crossed the grounds to the entrance. Once inside, Flickwick and McGonagall headed up on staircase and Harry and Madam Pomfrey another.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“It’s very late, Mr. Potter,” Pomfrey said as they climbed the stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>“I think he’ll wake soon.” She added as they reached the first floor and made for the infirmary. “Sometime this week.”</p><p>Harry’s heart beat picked up speed. “Great.”</p><p>“Perhaps you will feel better then.”</p><p>Harry’s brow furrowed and he smiled. “I feel fine.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Pomfrey looked him up and down and then opened the doors to the hospital wing.</p><p>Snape was exactly where he’d left him. Harry settled into his chair. Pomfrey waved her wand over his body and the lights with Snape’s vitals flashed past, painting a rainbow on Snape’s pale skin.</p><p>“See, Mr. Potter. Absolutely fine.”</p><p>Harry smiled and nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m off to bed then.”</p><p>“Of course. Good night, Madam Pomfrey.”</p><p>She nodded, lingered a moment, but then disappeared into her office. Harry had guessed ages ago that the entry to her quarters was somewhere in there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry scooted his chair closer, until his knees touched the side of the bed. Then he picked up the delicate hand and ran a finger down the pulsing vein.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>******</p><p> </p><p>“Ron and I are leaving for Australia tomorrow.”</p><p>“Oh. That’s great.” Harry said. “Good luck.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. She’d pulled a chair up beside Harry, at Snape’s bedside.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Snape slept on. Madam Pomfrey had changed the sheets, given the man a wash and a new set of pyjamas that morning. Everything had that smell particular to Wizarding hospitals. Powdery and herbal.</p><p>“You could come if you like.”</p><p>Harry scoffed. “I’d rather not be a third wheel there, thanks.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>Harry turned in time to catch her cheeks pink. He smiled. “Just enjoy yourself. As much as you can. Well, maybe not as much as you can.”</p><p>Hermione chuckled. “Of course not.”</p><p>Their eyes met and they smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Snape’s hand twitched and Harry’s attention shifted. Harry resisted reaching for the trembling fingers. “Madam Pomfrey says he should be awake by the end of the week.”</p><p>“That’s fantastic. Truly.”</p><p>“Yeah. I think so too.”</p><p>He had also decided it was terrifying. Snape’s hand stilled again. He’d been having these little random bouts of movement in the last few days. The first time it had happened Harry had been holding his hand. He’d leapt from his seat, clutching Snape’s hand, and leaned right over Snape’s prone form. He’d hovered a breath’s space above the man’s nose and whispered his name, over and over again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>When Snape’s eyes didn’t pop open, when he didn’t reach for Harry’s throat and scream about liberties taken, Harry had called for Pomfrey, rather frantically actually. That’s when Harry had been informed about these little signs. Snape’s body was slowly waking. His hands moved, his face twitched, his eyes shifted beneath their lids.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry was thankful for the false start. He hoped to be much cooler, much more in control, when Snape opened his eyes for the first time. And he hoped not to be holding the man’s hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“How are you, Harry?”</p><p>“Ah, fine.” Harry looked askew at her. “Thanks. How are you?”</p><p>Hermione reached out and rubbed a bit of the pressed, white sheet between her fingers. “Not great, actually.”</p><p>Harry turned his head. “Oh. Um. Are you worried about your parents? I’m sure-”</p><p>“Well, yes, but that’s not what I mean.” She plucked at the sheet again. “I’ve been having a terrible time sleeping.”</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>“I have these nightmares. It’s like I’m back there, at Malfoy Manor. And I scream for someone, anyone.” Hermione let go of the sheet and looked at Harry. “I’m so tired.” She smiled, a small, watery one. “Ron too.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Harry nodded and smiled sadly back. “Loads of people probably have dreams after. After everything, you know. You could ask Madam Pomfrey for some Dreamless Sleep.”</p><p>“I know.” Hermione’s brow furrowed. She shook her head and looked at Snape.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry looked back at Snape too. The steady up and down of his chest. The way his hair flared against the thin white pillow beneath his head. The pink scar tissue that lined his neck. The flicker of his dark lashes against his pale skin as his eyes shifted around with his own dreams. “Do you think Snape is having nightmares? Do people in comas have nightmares?”</p><p>Hermione was quiet a moment. “He likely saw terrible things. He did terrible things.”</p><p>“For Dumbledore.”</p><p>“Yes. I am only saying that I wouldn’t be surprised if he did. Have nightmares I mean.”</p><p>“Oh. Right, yeah.”</p><p>“Do you sleep here, Harry?” Hermione gestured around the room. “Like, here, in the infirmary.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Harry pointed to a bed nearby. “Right there.”</p><p>Hermione pulled her bottom lip between her teeth.</p><p>“Madam Pomfrey doesn’t mind. She says she doesn’t.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “That’s good.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“You know the Weasleys would love to have you.”</p><p>“I know.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione nodded. “If, if you want, I could tell Ginny that you want some space and I could bunk in with her.”</p><p>“I’m not avoiding Ginny, Hermione. I’m not avoiding anyone. I want to be here. For when Snape wakes up.”</p><p>“Okay, Harry. Okay.” Hermione turned in her chair and reached for Harry’s arm. “I only want, I want to be sure you know-”</p><p>“I know. I do. I promise.”</p><p>Hermione nodded, gave Harry’s arm a squeeze, and stood up. “I should go.”</p><p>Harry stood, knowing a hug was required. He smiled and opened his arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“We should be back before your birthday.” Hermione pulled back, but her hands stayed on his shoulders and squeezed. “All the Weasleys miss you. We are all here for you.”</p><p>Harry swallowed and nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione smiled, gathered up her things, and left.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry took his place back at Snape’s bedside. Snape’s hand spasmed and his fingers flexed. Harry scooped it up between his hands. He inched forward and let his his elbows rest on the bed near Snape’s rising and falling ribcage. The fingers curled around Harry’s and stilled.</p>
