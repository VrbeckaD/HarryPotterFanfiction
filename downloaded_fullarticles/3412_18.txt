<p>Pain. </p>
<p>Everywhere. </p>
<p>Draco groaned as he reached consciousness. How long had he been out this time? </p>
<p>Slowly, he took inventory of his body, moving as little as possible. Everything hurt, but everything was still attached. Good. They hadn’t killed him yet.</p>
<p>Draco blinked a few times, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. This was new. He was outside, lying on gravel. He turned his head to see more of his surroundings.</p>
<p>The Manor. Draco was lying in the driveway on the Manor grounds. The wards must have weakened since his parents moved to France a decade ago.</p>
<p>Why would the kidnappers leave him here? Did they get cold feet? Or did they get what they wanted? Was this the result of careful negotiations? Why here?</p>
<p>Draco was confused and afraid that this was just another dream, that he was still stuck in that tiny dark cell, waking up any second only to be dragged to his next beating.</p>
<p>Nervously, he stretched his arm out to the Manor and hoped - despite the torturous pain - that this was real.</p>
<p>“Accio Malfoy family wand!” he croaked. Fuck, his throat hurt.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, the wand exploded through a second-floor window and flew into Draco’s hand. He sighed in relief as his fingers closed around the smooth wood and the familiar magic tingled through his body.</p>
<p>Finally. Help was what he needed first, then water.</p>
<p>Draco closed his eyes and thought of his son, his husband...</p>
<p>“Expecto Patronum!”</p>
<p>White mist shot out of the wand and turned into a beautiful snowy owl. It flew in a circle before landing on Draco’s arm, looking expectantly at him.</p>
<p>“Find Harry. Tell him..." Draco's voice broke. "Tell him I love him. I’m at the Manor. Tell him to bring me home.”</p></div>
