    <p>“Moony?”</p>
<p>The lanky boy was so startled by his nickname being spoken directly into his ear, that he nearly fell from the comfy chair he was sat on, reading a book.</p>
<p>“Hey Sirius,” he said after he had somewhat recovered from the shock, “I didn’t hear you coming.”</p>
<p>The other boy grinned and threw back his hair dramatically. “I’ve been calling you for the past five minutes.” Remus blushed, hiding behind his book, but his friend snatched it from him.</p>
<p>“No hiding from me! You know it makes me feel unwanted.” Remus rolled his eyes at his friend’s dramatic antics.</p>
<p>“What did you want?” He asked feigning annoyance.</p>
<p>“Just to tell you that Prongs got Evans to go out with him.” He said casually, leaning back against the nearby table and inspecting his nails, as if this wasn’t the biggest news there could be.</p>
<p>“He did?” Remus jumped up. “But how?”</p>
<p>Sirius smirked, before sighing long and dramatically as if he was going to recite a Shakespearean monologue every second. In a very grave voice he explained: “He asked.” Remus opened his mouth, but was too stunned to say anything, so he closed it again. He just asked? Could that be right? But why would Sirius be lying to him? They were friends after all, and surely, after years of pursuit, James would’ve included him if he had been planning something special. He bit his lip, deep in thought and didn’t notice how the movement caught Sirius’ eye.</p>
<p>The black-haired boy stared at his friend’s mouth, transfixed, as he often did these days. Or had he always been doing it? He didn’t know. But whenever Remus bit his lip - which was often - he got the urge to bite it himself. To feel the soft flesh bruise, to mark it as his. He shook his head violently to rid himself of those thoughts. He didn’t even know whether Remus was gay, much less if he would be interested in him. So it was useless to spend his days dreaming about him. But still…</p>
<p>In the end, Remus decided to just go and ask James how he had finally gotten the girl of his dreams to go out with him. He could really use the advice. Not that there necessarily was a girl of his dreams… No, his crush was definitely no girl. Even with his long hair, he could never be mistaken for one. His defined and sharp cheekbones and his strong nose made that impossible.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>He sighed and straightened, preparing for the walk through the castle. The days before full moon everything seemed a bit harder to do, especially climbing thousands of stairs. And he knew exactly where Prongs would be right now, the top of the astronomy tower, probably with Peter in his tow.</p>
<p>“You wanna come with?” He asked Sirius, before noting that the other boy wasn’t there anymore. Sighing again, he left the common room, not noticing the pair of eyes that was following him from behind Marlene McKinnon’s bush of hair.</p>
<p>The girl had dragged Sirius away from his friend while he had been distracted, promptly pushed him in a chair, and sat down on his lap. Sirius knew that the girl was infatuated with him and he also knew that his constant flirting with everyone wasn’t helping in this case. But he just couldn’t help it. He was charmingly nice and he couldn’t stand to hurt a girl with whom he had been good friends for years. Even though he knew that in the end not telling her right away would hurt her even more. He sighed and buried his head in Marlene’s hair, which probably wasn’t a good idea. The girl went rigid, before abandoning her homework and turning around on her crushes lap, her legs dangling from the sides.</p>
<p>“Sirius?” She asked silently, her mouth brushing his ear. It made him shiver, but not with anticipation, but rather with disgust. Not for Marlene, of course not, but for himself. He should be turned on by this. He should want to take her right here, not caring who saw. He should be overcome with desire by now. But instead all he felt was a strong urge to get away and to chase after Remus. The thought of his friend made him blush, which the girl on his lap mistook as a sign of pleasure.</p>
<p>“Let’s go somewhere else,” She purred, her hands dangerously close to the joining of his legs. Sirius bolted up, throwing the blonde bluntly to the floor.</p>
<p>“Ow!” She complained, holding her head with her left hand. “If you didn’t want to, you could’ve just said so.” She was scowling, but he knew that underneath her facade lay genuine hurt. He held out his hand to help her up, and thankfully after a minute of consideration, the girl took it and pulled herself up.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Sirius mumbled. “I just realised that I have detention with Slug in five minutes, and I can’t be late again. See you.” With that he slipped out of the busy common room into the calm corridors. It was warm for March and whenever he passed a window Sirius walked slower to take in the sun. His excuse hadn’t been illogical. He always got in detention for something or the other. He wondered where Moony had gone. He would like the other boy’s company. He always did.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Breathing hard, Remus climbed the last few stairs and opened the trap door that led to the outside of the tower. He pushed himself up and could already make out Prongs’ feet. He made sure to close the trapdoor, with some noise, but not too loudly, so that the other boy wouldn’t startle and accidentally fall off the tower.</p>
<p>“Hey Moony!” James was already standing in front of him when he turned around again, though, grinning as brightly as if it had just been announced that You-Know-Who was dead. Yep, Remus thought, Lilly definitively said yes.</p>
<p>“James!” Remus hugged his friend, clapping him on the back a few times. “How’d you do it?” He asked when he pulled away, trying to appear calm, but knowing that he must appear a bit too eager for it to be a casual question. James smirked, as if he knew exactly why Remus was asking, but didn’t say anything for a while. Then, he sat down with a long sigh, indicating for his friend to do the same.</p>
<p>“I just asked Moony. But not like I always do.”</p>
<p>The werewolf grinned knowingly, remembering the hundreds of times James had hollered some version of the words “Go out with me!” At the red haired girl when they passed her in the hallway.</p>
<p>“No, this time-” the raven haired boy continued “-I just went up to her when she was alone, handed her some flower I had picked on the grounds and asked.” He smiled as if in trance, and Remus was sure that his friend was reliving the scene for the about hundredth time today. “And then… she just said yes. And that I should make the date something special. Which is why I’m here. I need to prepare the best date this world has ever seen, and that required some thinking.”</p>
<p>“Maybe a picnic under the full moon.” Moony laughed. James looked at him bewildered for a moment, looking as if he was indeed taking his friend seriously. Then though, he broke into laughter too.</p>
<p>“Very funny, Moony.” He breathed, with emphasis on his friend’s nickname.</p>
<p>“God, we have to tell Padfoot that one. He’ll find it hilarious.” Nearly immediately Remus giggle fit subsided and he was blushing. James, of course, noticed this, but stayed silent. He had watched his two best friends fall in love with each other for the past two years, but he had never said anything. He wanted to know what they made of it themselves. So he just sat at the sidelines, cheering them on silently and hoping that they would soon realise how much they liked each other. He grinned. Or maybe, now that he had finally gotten the girl of his dreams, it was time to help their process along so that they could be just as happy as himself. Yes, he decided, that was indeed a good idea.</p>
