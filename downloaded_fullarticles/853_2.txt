    <p>In Hogwarts, professor Albus Dumledore was pacing around his office. It was the summer holidays, so Harry was safely at home with his aunt and uncle, but only last year, his first year at Hogwarts, he had defeated the dark Wizard Voldemort. Not completely defeated, only stopped his plans. For now. Dumledore would personally be happy if Harry never had to get in a situation like that again, but he was courageous, and wanting to get revenge for his parent's deaths. It was only one week until Harry came back to Hogwarts, and Albus was sure that Voldemort was going to try something again. He adjusted his half-moon glasses, and suddenly saw something on his desk. A pile of paper that he was quite sure that he had never seen before. He slowly walked over, frowning, and picked up the sheets. The seven deadly sins, a group of powerful traitors who have incredible powers. The seven deadly sins? Dumledore had never heard of them before. The dragon's sin of wrath, Meliodas... The serpent's sin of envy, Diane... The foxes sin of greed, Ban... The grizzly sin of sloth, king... The goat's sin of lust, Gowther... The boar's sin of gluttony, Merlin... And the lion's sin of pride, Escanor... So they had all committed sins. Wrath, envy, greed, lust, gluttony and pride... Was it safe to let people bearing such titles into his school? It hadn't said what sin any of them had committed, so he had no idea if they were criminals, or if they had been cleared. Or even if they were still alive. He carried on pacing the office. Perhaps he could talk to them, if he could find a way to contact them. He went back to reading the papers. Also owners of 'the boar hat', a traveling tavern.<br/>
Albus Dumledore smiled as his phoenix, Fawkes, landed on his arm.</p><p>Merlin teleported outside the boar hat, and heard the usual pandemonium. When she opened the door, she saw tables upturned, smashed bottles of ale laying on the floor, and in the middle were Ban, king, human-sized Diane, and Meliodas. She sighed.<br/>
"Captain. We have an urgent message from the king." As expected, he was fast asleep. Sighing again, the Mage walked over to him, and shouted, "CAPTAIN!"<br/>
He opened his eyes, blinking. "Oh hey Merlin, I didn't know you could be so loud." Suddenly, Elizabeth, hearing Merlin's shout, ran downstairs.<br/>
"Lady Merlin! You startled me!"<br/>
The others were also starting to wake. "Oh, Merlin?" Said Diane sleepily.<br/>
The boar's sin sighed, again. "Now you're awake, captain, the king has called us all for an urgent meeting." The goat's sin of lust, Gowther, also walked downstairs.<br/>
"A meeting? What about?" Meliodas said, sitting up and rubbing his eyes.<br/>
"He hasn't told me." She looked at her comerades, and grinned. "You all seem awake enough." She teleported all of the sins to Liones castle.</p><p>King Bartra was sat in his throne, as usual. "Ah, you have arrived." The sins stood in front of him, Ban still half-asleep. "I have called you together because of something that arrived, addressed to the seven deadly sins. It was a burning, red feather, with this note attached to it." He passed the note to Meliodas.<br/>
"To the Seven Deadly Sins," he read out. "I have sent you this letter from a different world, it seems, with a request that you talk to me. Right now on Hogwarts, which is my school, a dark Wizard named Voldemort is attempting to revive himself, and trying to kill one of our students. If you would be so kind as to meet up, I will explain the details. If you decide to come, just all of you hold this letter two hours after receiving it. It is a portkey, and will take you all instantly to me. Yours sincerely, Albus Dumledore." After reading, he looked up to see what his comerades' reactions were. Merlin picked up the letter to examine, while Ban thought about it.<br/>
"There is defiantly magic in this paper," Merlin informed them.<br/>
Ban said, "If some 'dark Wizard' geezer is trying to murder some kids, it might be worth stopping him."<br/>
"You're right, Ban," Meliodas said. Diane and king nodded in agreement, while Merlin continued to examine the paper. Gowther simply watched.<br/>
"How intriguing," Merlin murmured. "I've never sensed this type of magic in my life before. I would be most interested to see where it comes from." She smiled slyly at her friends.<br/>
"I say we see what this is all about," said Meliodas decisively. The others nodded in agreement. "So we hold this in... It's been here for about an hour, right?" When Bartra nodded, he said, "ok, Merlin, can you take us back to the boar hat then?" The Mage teleported the sins back to the tavern, where they were greeted by Elizabeth and Hawk.<br/>
"Oh, Sir Meliodas! You're alright!" Elizabeth said with delight. He responded by groping her, until Hawk kicked him out of the way.<br/>
"Elizabeth, take this chance to run!" She laughed slightly, blushing.<br/>
"So, the Princess and sir hawk will be coming with us, I assume?" Merlin stated.<br/>
Meliodas told Elizabeth what was happening, and she instantly decided to come. Meliodas grinned at her confidence.<br/>
"So we just wait an hour?" Hawk questioned. The sins nodded.</p><p>An hour later, the sins, along with Elizabeth and Hawk, were holding the small piece of paper. "What will it do?" King asked with curiousity.<br/>
Merlin responded with, "just wait, I suppose."<br/>
Suddenly, the paper began to glow, and the group felt at if they had been hooked behind their navels, and were instantly blown off their feet, into the unknown.</p><p>All eight of them landed on the floor in a circular office, knocking over a small table with an amount of silver trinkets that were emitting smoke. Merlin instantly stood up, examining them with interest.<br/>
"I see that you like my trinkets," said an old voice, with a slight laugh. The sins all turned around to see an ancient man with a long, silver beard, and half-moon glasses watching them. "So you must be the seven deadly sins."<br/>
Meliodas smiled. "I'm assuming you are Albus Dumledore. Nice to meet you." They shook hands. "Let me introduce my team. I'm Meliodas, the dragon's sin of wrath, this is Ban, the foxes sin of greed, this is Merlin, the boar's sin of gluttony, this is Gowther, the goat's sin of lust, this is Diane, the serpent's sin of envy, this is king, the grizzly sin of sloth, and this is Elizabeth." They all - with the exception of Gowther - smiled at the old Wizard.<br/>
"Don't forget me, the mighty sir Hawk!" Said the pig. Nobody took any notice of him, to his annoyance.<br/>
"Oh? So miss Elizabeth is not one of the sins?" Asked Dumledore.<br/>
"Nope, she's the Princess of Liones. The sin of pride Escanor was busy somewhere."<br/>
Dumledore said, "So, if I may ask, what are all your sins?"<br/>
Meliodas blinked. "As an order of Knights, we have put the past behind us. But each of us have committed a sin. It's up to them if they tell you what." All of the sins shook their heads, saying that they didn't want to.<br/>
"So," said Meliodas, walking up to him. "What was it that you were wanting to speak to us about?"<br/>
"Ah. So, let me fill you in. A decade ago, a Wizard named Voldemort murdered two people - Lily and James Potter. He had the intent of killing their child, Harry potter, but for unknown reasons, his curse failed, and Harry rebounded it back at him. Some believed he died, but only a few months ago, Voldemort was here in my school, taking possession of somebody named professor Quirrel. Harry managed to fight him, and beat him, but I'm worried that he will be back, and try to kill him again. What I would like is for you all to protect Harry." Silence met this.<br/>
"We would like to talk about this, if you wouldn't mind," said Merlin. The group walked over to the corner.<br/>
"What do you all think about this?" Meliodas asked. "Gowther, is he being truthful?"<br/>
The goat's sin nodded. "I don't believe he would ever lie after what happened in his past."<br/>
King spoke up. "I think we should protect this boy." Diane nodded in agreement.<br/>
Merlin smirked. "And I'm most interested in this school. I would like to stay and observe it for a while."<br/>
"So, we're staying?" They all nodded, including Elizabeth. They walked back over to Dumledore.<br/>
"We say yes."<br/>
Dumledore smiled in appreciation. "Thank you."</p>
