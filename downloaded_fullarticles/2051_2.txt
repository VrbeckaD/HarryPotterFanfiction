  <em>He toppled to his side right after, breathing harshly and trying not to vomit as his vision swam violently.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> "Shit" he groaned and reached for his phone.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> "Siri. Call Milli." he slurred, pressing a palm to his aching forehead.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> Pain exploded behind his eyes at the motion and he panted through clenched teeth so as not to pass the fuck out. He could hear Milli's voice calling his name and gritted out "Parking level 4. Embankment." before the phone fell from his limp fingers.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> The last thing he knew before it all went dark was the crack of apparition.</em>
</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Millicent stomped down the stairs at New Scotland Yard, the sound of her smart heels echoing through the enclosed space. She took extra care to stomp heavily on each tread, working out her frustrations. Usually she would rely on a good game of racquetball at the local YWCA with some friends or a round or two in the ring at the mixed martial arts centre to work out her restless energy. And if she was still feeling all revved up, she’d call up one of her casuals for a romp between the sheets.</p><p>For now though, she’d satisfy herself with forgoing a convenient elevator ride for the stairs; working out her ire with the resolution of the Hibbert Case. From the moment there’d been even a suspicion of magical line theft, she’d known that the muggle side of the case would never be solved to satisfaction. She knew that CS Davies was hopping mad as well, having received curt instruction straight from the Buckingham Palace itself to let the matter die. No questions asked. Case closed.</p><p>Her own report to the DMLE would be sorely lacking and definitely not up to her usual standards. The DoM had swooped in along with the Aurors and absconded with the suspect as well as all of the evidence.  The Ministry had wasted no time in seizing all of the man’s properties and holdings ‘as part of the ongoing investigation’.</p><p>She huffed, shoving her gloved hands into the pockets of her deep purple coat. Yeah right, that was just ministry slang for ‘grabbing everything not nailed down to fill the coffers. Surely the goblins had already sunk their claws into the line theft ritual Hibbert had created with his insane genius.</p><p>At least she could be assuaged with the knowledge that the mad man had paid a heavy price for his unnatural distortion of magic. All he had to look forward too was a short and uncomfortable life of in the ravenous hands of the Department of Mysteries. She could almost feel pity the poor bugger. Almost.</p><p>She’d just stepped on to the second floor landing when her phone rang and she dug around in her voluminous pocket for the vibrating device, frowning as she checked the screen. It was Draco. Probably calling to bitch some more about the case. He’d been just as frustrated as Davies, only he’d kept his ire better than the Chief Superintendent. No doubt he’d be at Rasputin tonight, leaving his emotions on the dance floor. She’d have to give Blaise a heads up. She swiped the screen with her thumb and brought it to her ear with a smirk.</p><p>“Dra…”</p><p>"Parking level 4. Embankment."</p><p>The cadence of his voice froze Millicent in her spot, her grip tightening on the phone’s rubber case. She was moving before he’d even finished speaking, her coat flapping around her legs as she raced down the stairs; calling his name. Her heart hammered in her chest as she ran, jumping the last few steps of each flight to shave time. She was panting by the time the door to level four parking came into sight, innocuous with it cracked yellow paint and scuffed silver handle. She quickly braced herself against the wall, pressing her back against the concrete as if doing so would make her rebellious lungs draw in oxygen easier.</p><p>She drew her wand, glaring at the door hotly as if it would suddenly turn transparent. Panic burned like acid in her veins. She’d never heard Draco sound like that. The Slytherin in him would have never allowed for such an open expression of pain. Not even the death of his parents and his consequent exile had let him show such emotion to anyone but Blaise. Whatever caused the strain in his voice was a cause for serious concern.</p><p>She blinked, then swore. <em>Merlin’s hairy ass crack, Bulstrode. You’re a trained war witch. Use your fucking magic, you nit.</em></p><p>She quickly cast a <em>mufflulato</em> spell at the door and at her shoes, with a disillusionment over her entire body. A quick and powerful notice-me-not was cast at the door and she was ready. The door mechanism was silent as she opened it and eased through, closing behind her with no more than a whisper. The parking lot was brightly lit and filled with cars of employees still hard at work upstairs. She ducked behind one of the cars and surveyed the area. She spotted the edge of Draco’s convertible but there were too many large pillars in her line of sight to see hide nor hair of the blond.</p><p>She did a quick point me with her wand, making her way forward cautiously; eyes and ears peeled for anything suspicious. There was a good chance that the Unsub could have stuck around the area, ready to pounce on whomsoever came upon the scene. She paused, wand gripped tightly in her hand and facing down. There’d been a sound up ahead, the swish of a cloak, the soft hush of leather soles against concrete. She took a breath and rounded the last pillar, leaning out just enough to take a quick reconnoiter.</p><p>The sight of Draco’s prone form made her blood boil. He looked like a ragdoll, limbs splayed across the cold, unforgiving floor. His face was turned away but his blond hair was bright in the harsh florescence. His work satchel had fallen open, spilling it contents around him as if they were victims themselves. It painted a picture in her imagination of violence and it was only the absence of blood spilled that kept her rage from taking over. Someone had perpetrated an assault against one of her dearest friends and for that she would seek them out and return the favour threefold.</p><p>There was a figure leaning over the fallen blond, the dark cloak enveloping the figure from head to toe.  There was the briefest glimpse of polished wood in a gloved hand, light blue sparks already leaping along the tip. Millicent snarled silently, raising her wand as she stepped out from behind cover.</p><p>“<em>Petrificus Totalus. Locomotor Mortis. Expelliarmus. Incarcerous. Protego Protego Protego.</em>” Rapid spells flashed from her wand, hitting the unsub and flinging them away from the prone man. The last three were cast over Draco as she ran to stand between him and the figure who was struggling against the rope bindings she’d conjured. Their wand had been blasted away, rolling underneath a nearby car but even wandless, the figure was still fighting against her spells. Fighting and almost succeeding.</p><p>She stepped closer. “<em>Gravis Corpus. Haereat corpori. Altum somnum</em>.”</p><p>Her wand flashed, pulsing warm in her hand as she got into the grove of rapid casting. She dared not take her eye from the cloaked figure, not even to check on Draco. It made no sense to check on the man now while his assailant was still unsecured.</p><p>Gold magic sparked from the prone figure with a loud crack, shattering her spells frightfully easily. Her mind raced, her brain quickly carding through her repertoire of spells as she gathered her magic. She needed a distraction, and quickly.</p><p>“<em>Pituita Vespertilio</em>” she screamed, the force of the spell knocking the figure back with a pained oomph, sending them skidding a few feet across the smooth concrete.</p><p>There was a disgusting sucking sound as the figure flailed helplessly, their hands clutching at their face. They screamed, curling in on themselves as globules of murky goo pulled from their nostrils to float in the air. The slimy blobs squelched their way into the shapes of cartoon bat which immediately started to dive bomb their victim, wet little squeaks coming from their flabby little bodies.</p><p>The figure, with an anguished cry, palmed an amulet around their neck; and with a golden flash that left Millicent blinking stars from her eyes; the bats turned to dry crust, falling and cracking apart on the floor.</p><p>“Merlin dammit, did you actually cast a fucking Bat Boogie hex at me?” The figure growled out, flipping the dark hood down to reveal a wild mane of vibrant red hair. “What the actual fuck, Bultstrode?”</p><p>Millicent gaped for a hot second. “Bill Weasley?”</p><p> </p><p>----------------- To be continued -------------------------</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.LOL. No. April fool’s. There’s more.  ...</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. “What are you doing here Weasley? State your business.”</p><p>The redhead wizard gingerly sat up, running his gloved hand through his hair before gasping as he touched his nose. He gave her a flat look.  “What does it look like I was doing?”</p><p>She returned his flat look with a glare and the raising of her wand. “It looked like you were standing over a prone victim of attack with your wand at the ready. So… I say again. State. Your. Business.”</p><p>He looked at her for a moment, then at Draco before turning back to her. He took in the cold flinty look in her eyes and the confident grip on her wand. He sighed and bowed his head in capitulation.</p><p>“Gringotts sent me. One of their protective wards had been activated. Immediate response was required. They sent me in because it wass a muggle area. As it was, Shadowskull himself would have responded if it was wizarding space.”</p><p>He looked a bit awed at the very thought of that happening and Millicent tucked that fact away, mostly to see what the blond would think of it when he awoke. <em>And he would wake</em>, she reminded herself sternly. <em>He would</em>. She flicked her wand at the redhead to get him talking again.</p><p>“I was handed a potrkey that would take me to the nearest point. It brought me straight here, I appeared behind those cars over there.”  He pointed at the shadowed spot but Millicent didn’t turn to see. She gave him a withering look.</p><p>“Stop wibbling Gryffindor.  Get to the fucking point.”</p><p>“Goblin warded coins are serious magic. Gifted only to those deemed Huukek Dhek … Goblin Friend.”  He frowned at her, then grew serious. “Only a serious intent to harm would have made it react as it did.” He pointed his chin to the large gold coin loosely grasped in Draco’s slack hand. “That thing may as well have saved his life.”</p><p>Millicent took a careful step back and to the side so that she could see both the redhead and her friend. Indeed, there was a large goblin made coin in his hand, red markings matching the coin bruising his pale skin. Her heart skipped a beat at the wizard’s words. Someone had tried to hurt Draco, had tried to harm him with intent. Some fucking son of a whore had tried to use magic on a magical exile. Draco was so vulnerable to magic, unable to use any to protect himself or escape.</p><p>A low snarl escaped from her clenched teeth, deep and rumbling in the open space of the lot. Weasley startled, staring at her in shock. She ignored him, concentrating to calming herself before she really lost control. She kept her nailed from hardening and turning black. Kept her teeth from sharpening and curving into fangs. Kept her skin from crystalizing into thick hide.</p><p>Turns out that the vicious rumors back at Hogwarts had been half right.  She did have a bit of something else in her blood.</p><p>But that wasn’t needed now. For now, she needed her human brain and quick thinking.</p><p>She cut a look at the Weasley. He was smart enough to stay seated, his hands where she could see them.</p><p>“You swear on your magic that you didn’t come here to harm him?”</p><p>He blanched, shaking his head. “My employee contract doesn’t allow me to do that but I can swear on this.”</p><p>He carefully readhead into his cloak and pulled out an employee’s badge. It was a thin plaque of burnished gold with the Gringott's seal and magical moving image of the man’s face which was also frowning. Millicent examined the badge carefully before nodding. “Do it.”</p><p>Weasley made the oath, breathing out as the badge glowed then faded. Satisfied, she let him get up and retrieve his own wand. Under her watchful eye, he cast a diagnosis charm. Thank Merlin, Draco seemed to just be unconscious.</p><p>“He needs a healer.” Weasley said, staring at the coin still in Draco’s hand. “His core shows sign of damage. He’ll need rest and a potions regiment at least."</p><p>"I’ll take care of it.” Millicent nodded, tucking her wand away and pulling out her phone. “You should get out of here.”</p><p>“What are you doing?” He looked around then back at her as she scrolled through her contacts.</p><p>“What does it look like I’m doing?” She gave him a dry look “I’m calling the police.”</p><p>He blinked at her stupidly. “Why? What can they do?”</p><p>Millicent inhaled sharply, irritated. “What do you think I should be doing? Summoning the Knight Bus? Apperating him to St. Mungo’s? You do remember that he’s a magical exile? This has to be handled the muggle way.”</p><p>The redhead flushed, nodding his understanding before turning to apparate away. He paused. “The second round of spells. <em>Gravis Corpus. Haereat Corpori. Altum Somnum</em>. I’ve never heard of those. They teach you those at Hogwarts?”</p><p>Millie quirked her lips at one corner. “The first is the counter to Levicorpus. It fell out of use because if used without intense focus, the body’s mass would increase too much and cause injury. The other two are a household sticking charm and a sleeping hex for unruly children. Just with extra power.”</p><p>He stared at her for a moment, his gaze going from baffled to impressed as he sharpened his gaze. He gave her a sharp nod before turning on his heel and was gone with a muffled crack.</p><p>Millie sighed, kneeling next to Draco as she made the call.</p><p>“Davies” the gruff voice came on the line.</p><p>“It’s Bulstrode. “I have a 10-24 Officer Needs Assistance. Parking Level 4.”  “Millicent took a breath. “It’s Prince Sir, he was attacked by a magical.”</p><p>Davies was silent for a moment before growling out. “What do you need?”</p><p>“I need an ambulance to take him to the hospital and a forensic team down here ASAP. I’ll also need you to sequester all the camera footage on this level. We need to know what’s on those tapes before they can be used as evidence.”</p><p>She listened as he barked orders out of his office door, sending people scrambling into action and felt the last of her panic drain away. She looked down at her friend and protector at school. He looked so vulnerable, his usually smooth brown furrowed in pain even now.</p><p>He’d always had her back at Hogwarts, even beyond as she struggled to pursue her dreams to be recognized as a capable and powerful witch and a confident and desirable woman besides. He’d always been there for his Slytherins, even after his exile. Her personal dragon protector.</p><p>“Don’t worry Dray…” she whispered softly as the sound of sirens wailed in the distance. “This time, I’ll be the one to protect you.”</p>
