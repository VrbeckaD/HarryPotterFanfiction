    <p>1.</p>
<p>He liked to watch her. Her eyebrows specifically. It was an odd thing.<br/>He noticed it first when he was assigned a seat opposite her in the first course they had together. Of course she recognized him immediately, frowning for a few seconds before sporting the most successful pokerface he had ever laid eyes on.</p>
<p>They didn’t speak much during that first encounter. Draco felt rather awkward, as the last time he had seen her was during his trial, where she had spoken on his behalf. He was charged with a year in Azkaban and two years probation, to be served from his home. Thank Merlin he was allowed to buy a new house, as he didn’t particularly feel at home at the Manor after Voldemort had written murder all over it.</p>
<p>He dared to glance at her a few times during that first hour, though. That’s when he saw it first. Every time she wrote something down, with every thought that crossed her probably overflowing mind, her eyebrows moved. Just slightly so. A small tick. He had the distinct feeling that she was ignoring him, or at least acting like it.</p>
<p>This annoyed him to no end. Despite his annoyance at the situation and the fact that they couldn’t speak aloud during the lecture, he tried to stay calm and practice his breathing exercises without drawing attention to himself. He rehearsed the speech he had carefully prepared during his year probation, to fall back on in the probable case he would run into one of his former classmates.</p>
<p>The lecture seemed to last forever. Forty grey hairs, a nightmare and two fingernails later, they were finally dismissed. Draco saw her collecting her pens and several coloured markers and grinned to himself while packing his notes. Some things never changed. He tried to lose the anxiety he felt as he walked the few meters up to her desk.</p>
<p>‘I didn’t expect you here,’ she mumbled as she grabbed her books without really looking at him. ‘Never imagined you would want to go to University.’</p>
<p>She was careful not to say anything suspicious, as they were of course in the middle of a Muggle lecture room. When he didn’t immediately reply, she looked up and as their eyes met, for one second he was back in his old home, with her looking up at him. A desperate expression. Tears. Her body writhing on the floor, bleeding.</p>
<p>‘I’m sorry,’ he stumbled. ‘I’m so sorry.’</p>
<p>And he ran.</p>
<p>The ten minute speech he had so carefully prepared, gone. He couldn’t do this, not here – and certainly not now. As he ran from the room, trying not to draw attention to himself, despite having a panic attack in plain sight, he heard her calling his name. And as the door closed behind him, the voices from his class suddenly muted, he realized it was the first time he heard her say his first name.</p>
