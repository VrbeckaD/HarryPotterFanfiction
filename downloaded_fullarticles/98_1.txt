          <div class="userstuff"><p>I am looking for a work that I read some time ago, but can’t remember the name of. </p><p>This work is a Harry Potter fanfic. The basis was that it was discovered that Harry had been killed as a child, and several people, among which were McGonagall, Snape, and Sirius, were able to work with the goblins to send Snape back in time to save Harry. </p><p>Back in the past, Snape rescues Harry from his relatives, makes a copy of Harry to die in Harry’s place, and leaves with Harry. With the help of the goblins, Snape takes Harry from the U.K. and hides him in another country (I can’t think of where, but it was tropical). </p><p>That’s all I really remember, so if anyone has any information about the story, like the title or what happened to it, please let me know! It was one of my favorite stories and I would love to read it again!</p><p>Update: the work has been found! Thank you to those who commented and helped me find it!</p></div>
