    <p>Two months before final exams, and impossible to stay awake during the best of times, History of Magic lectures had become even more untenable. </p><p>Her notes were likely the best in the class, that is how he rationalized it to himself. Months ago, after a week of failed positioning, he managed to cast a protean charm on Hermione's notebook. She was at the top of their class, except for him, of course. So, from who else should he copy? Of course, his truthfulness didn't extend to the fact that this year he would have been, more accurately, in the bottom third of the class, but he had more important things to do. Once Severus had started interfering however, he had no choice other than to find other ways to keep up the appearance of maintaining his grades. A little spell here, a cheating quill there... And then back to his mission.</p><p>But every so often he was simply tired. And some nights, longing for the simpler times, he found himself studying, actually studying. </p><p>That night, however, the second page into that day's charms notes, he laughed to himself aloud. Ha! He had a little treasure for the moment. She had broken image of the scrupulous student and had been journaling in class. Those were always amusing. The inner workings of that Granger mind had him occasionally howling. </p><p>But tonight, however, after a minute of reading and waiting for the grand payoff, he froze. His name was on the page.</p><p>The writing was of another hand and then alternated with Granger's. It was a condensed argument, initiated by Potter.</p><p>Potter suspected him. Granger and Weasley thought he was too stupid and irrelevant to be behind anything. Potter thought he was a death eater. His blood went cold. After satisfying himself that the Golden Trio was none-the-wiser to what he was actually doing, he leant back in his chair and breathed again. </p><p>His momentary reprieve was gone. He would have to be more careful. His lookout was suspected. He would need to start polyjucing his help. And, he chuckled slightly to himself, it seemed Granger was wrong for once. </p><p>But, he would certainly be reading her notes daily.</p><p>***</p><p>Hermione was furious. Bins was yet again glossing over Elfish enslavement. This always set her blood blazing. She dutifully continued taking notes, but not five minutes later, Bins was showing one of his rare bouts of blood purity racism. </p><p>She would not listen to this drivel without injecting her own thoughts. She started comparing Wizarding and Muggle stories. Line by line and side by side. Before the class was up, she had a long list of anecdotes listed beside wizard equivalents. The Colonization of India and Africa, the Slave Trade, Selma, Martin Luther King, Jr., Abraham Lincoln, Special Restriction Order of 1825, League of Coloured Peoples,... </p><p>By the time she was done with her comparisons, she noticed the whole class had gone. And by the level of light still in the classroom, she suspected dinner may be winding down.</p><p>Still, as she always did after a bought of writing, she felt a bit enlightened. Some new parallels about what may happen in the Wizarding World were swirling in her mind. She wasn't as confident that the mechanics of Muggle society would translate well into Wizarding society given the cultural difference surrounding balance of power and social hierarchy was fundamentally different.</p><p>Her musings continued to appear on the page later in the tower, long after her housemates were asleep. </p><p>***</p><p>Draco's eyes seemed to be separated from his head. His mind seemed to be in in a different place than his body. And a part of his brain seemed to be walled off completely from another portion of his screaming conscience. It screamed at him to stop, that he was reading something dangerously traitorous. That he was foolishly wasting his evening, that he was an idiot to spend a moment longer on this drivel. He was listening to the voice that voice tried for hours to drown out. And he was ignoring that voice. Small thoughts came up as if they were not his. He knew they were his thoughts. He knew they were his doubts, just as he had all along. </p><p>But when he went to sleep that night, he forgot they were his thoughts, and he forgot they were his doubts. His shouting mind convinced him he had gone out of his mind for a moment, and that it was quite all right but he had wasted enough time.</p><p>***</p><p>She couldn't breathe properly for days. </p><p>Everything had started. It all had begun. </p><p>And she was going to have to protect the boys. But was she ready? Was she prepared? All she could do was check and double-check her plans and her preparations.</p><p>***</p><p>His own voice was still ringing in his ears. He had not lost control like that since he was a child and his father had disciplined him smartly for it. His face still stung.</p><p>'Why is he still here?' echoed over and over in the faded timbre of the lower dining hall. </p><p>Then his father's narrowed eyes and his mother's horror-stricken gasp. </p><p>They had gone out. Thankfully, or he may be dead at this moment or near to it. The only one to hear his outburst besides his immediate kin had been Severus. </p><p>After his gruelling task, after his long, tiresome year, he thought he would have bought freedom for his family. But they were still enslaved.</p><p>Severus had sighed.</p><p>And when he knocked later, Draco let him in.</p><p>They had spoken briefly, and when the man left, Draco collected a certain journal.</p><p>He found a hint of a plan written toward the end, but, devil-be-damned if he would utter a single word of it to anyone.</p><p>And the other part of his mind pretended he never saw it.</p><p>***</p><p>The small framed mirror on her dresser refracted the setting sun straight into Hermione's eyes. It was only the second time that day she took any pause, but the view out her childhood window suddenly derailed the train that was her current task. </p><p>Tomorrow all she would have done today would be all but irreversible. Tomorrow, there would be no more home to which to return.</p><p>The fading July sun skimmed the slightly flickering trees, and her eyes melted along the opposing houses she knew so well and filtered down to the white gate and front lawn. Out of her haze, she could hear her parent's voices filtering through the front screen door, accompanied by the light clinking of dinnerware. She would no doubt be called down soon for the last meal.</p><p>She closed her eyes briefly, listening, waiting, breathing.</p><p>***</p><p>He slid his hand along the bannister of the staircase, letting it fall a step ahead of him. And as if he knew it had been coming, he paused at the shrieking that gradually rose like a tide into a tumult in the capacious entry hall. His feet started moving backwards of their own volition and he nearly tripped over his robes. Cursing under his breath, he cast a quick silencing spell and ran to his room. Breath heaving, he warded the door and then instantly thought better of his insolence. </p><p>Moments, or maybe hours later, he became aware as the smells of dinner crept under his door. Dread filled him, and the clock ticked by until there was a sharp, single rap on his door. </p><p>Lucious. </p><p>No, he daren't leave. Did he want his mother to be killed?</p><p>He had a role, a duty. </p><p>Thanking damn Uncle Severus and his legilimency, he let his thumb faintly tap a specific floorboard and he stood up. Robes dusted. He walked into the hallway, blocking out the grey world of his mother's trembling touch on his arm with his search to find comfort in running endless historical parallels and predictive outcome models.</p><p>He wasn't thinking about victors and vanquished, he was thinking of ways his family could coming out alive.</p>
