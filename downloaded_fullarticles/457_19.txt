    <p>Harry Potter was sure he had pneumonia again along with several broken ribs. He couldn't move his left arm from his chest, his right hand was stuck closed just open enough to hold a wand in it. His left eye was swollen shut and crusted over, his right eye was swelling as well. His glasses had been broken so he couldn't see well. His whole body was black and blue and they were deep bruises that didn't seem to fade no matter how much time went by. He was so skinny that every rib showed. It had been three weeks since he'd come back to Private Drive and had not been given food once. He was glad Hedwig was with Sirius this summer. He knew that his nose was broken and his right leg gave out every time that he tried to stand on it. </p><p>Three weeks ago when he'd come home from his fifth year at Hogwarts he'd had his DNA taken for some Muggle law that had passed then he'd been locked in the cupboard under the stairs again with all his school things. He'd been beaten every day and his uncle always smelled of alcohol so he assumed that the man was drinking heavily these days. </p><p>He took a shallow breath and pain racked his body. </p><p>He heard his uncle fly off the handle yelling and people identifying themselves as Preventers demanding to know where he, Harry was. </p><p>"He aint here!" Vernon yelled. "GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!"</p><hr/><p>"Agent Maxwell, look upstairs." Wufei told his friend. "I'll check around down here." </p><p>Duo nodded and took the stairs two at a time. His mind was still reeling. He had a father. Wufei had a different father he'd never known about and Heero.....Heero had a brother. The boy they were currently looking for. He was going to do everything he could to get this boy to Heero and give Heero a family even if his mind and heart was torn up over having his own family. He smirked to himself trying to imagine what the boy would be like. Would he be just like Heero then? He frowned when he saw the door with all the locks. He quickly picked them and entered the room. He'd had better accommodations from OZ when he was captured. He looked around his anger and panic rising where was the boy? He quickly made work of the rest of the upstairs. </p><p>Wufei hated the house on site and hated the inside even more.</p><p>"WUFEI! DUO!" </p><p>Wufei and Duo rushed to Quatre Winner who was with them. He was supposed to be sitting in the car or standing outside of it. </p><p>"What's up, Qat?" Duo asked worriedly. </p><p>Quatre was holding his chest right over his heart. </p><p>"He's there." Quatre said, leaning against the wall. He was pointing at the Cupboard Under the Stairs. "He's hurt. Very hurt. Almost dead. We have to get him out of here. He's in so much pain."</p><p>Wufei huffed at the lock. </p><p>"Maxwell, pick the lock." he ordered. </p><p>Duo quickly did and they opened the door. Duo cursed and Wufei removed the boy. Duo quickly grabbed the boy's things. </p><p>"We're taking him and he's not coming back." Wufei said, trying to control his breathing.</p><hr/><p>Harry was coughing roughly as they arrived in an office. He coughed up phlegm into a tissue pressed to his mouth. </p><p>"What happened?!" Sirius Black's voice cried, he and Remus quickly rushed to take Harry. </p><p>"We found him like this locked away in a cupboard." Wufei reported to Une. </p><p>Heero's eyes flashed. </p><p>"He will not be going back." The threat in Heero's voice made it clear and made everyone in the room shiver.</p><hr/><p>Harry must of passed out because he was suddenly waking up and he wasn't in as much pain anymore. Glasses were put on his face and he could see perfectly out of his right eye. He blinked at everyone around him. </p><p>"Sirius.......Remus........" he forced out. </p><p>"It's okay, Harry." Remus said, softly. </p><p>They told him what was going on. </p><p>"W-wati." Harry said, shaking his head. "I have a brother on my father's side. Is that even possible?" </p><p>"Er........" Sirius said, rubbing the back of his neck. "James was rather.......promiscuous before he and Lily started dating that school year.......so yes it is possible.......and yes he was with Muggles er........non-magic women........." </p><p>Harry blinked at his Godfather. He normally craved information on his parents but this was too much. </p><p>"I have a brother." he whispered his voice shaking in fear. </p><p>A guy with brown hair and cobalt eyes came forward. </p><p>"My name is Heero Yuy." Heero Yuy said. "I'm 19 years old. I'm half Japanese/ half British. It's nice to meet you." </p><p>Harry flinched away from Heero as he raised his hand. Heero quickly dropped it and took a few steps back. Harry felt bad but looked at Une. </p><p>"and my mother was adopted?" He clarified.</p><p>"That's right!" A woman said, from the other side of the room. "She was our baby sister. I'm Hilda Spellman and this is my older sister Zelda Spellman. Our sister went missing when she was very little only a few years old. We hear you have magic but don't use it like we do is that true?" </p><p>"Hilda, let the boy recover from the shock." Zelda scolded and smiled at Harry. She noted that Harry was looking at the cat in her arms. "This is Salem Saberhagen." </p><p>"Nice to meet you." Salem said, making them all jump. </p><p>"You do magic?" Sirius asked. </p><p>Zelda pointed her finger and magic swirled out of her finger. A second later the chair Harry was sitting in was a wheelchair. </p><p>"That is how we do magic." she said, simply. </p><p>Harry's mind was racing. He felt sick and shocked when the cat Salem was put in his lap. He held the talking cat in his left arm that he couldn't move and tried to pet him as best as he could. </p><p>"Guess what, Pup!" Sirius said, interrupting Harry's thoughts. "I have a son! He's the complete opposite of me more like Moony." Sirius babbled. "I want you to meet my son Wufei Chang. He rescued you!" </p><p>Wufei moved up next to his best friend Heero. </p><p>"Wufei Chang. Age: 19. Half Chinese/ Half British." Wufei said. </p><p>"I have a son as well." Remus said, and Harry looked at him. "My son is also my complete opposite more like Sirius." Remus smiled. "This is my son Duo Maxwell he also helped rescue you." </p><p>"Hey there!" Duo said, arms behind his head as he stood on the other side of his boyfriend Heero, "I'm Duo Maxwell. I may run and hide but I never tell a lie. That's me in a nutshell. I'm 19. Half American/Half British. Nice to meet you."</p><p>Harry felt sick how was all this possible? What was going on? How could one Muggle Law change everything so much? </p><p>"Harry, what's wrong?" Sirius asked worriedly. </p><p>"Dumbledore lied to me." Harry rasped. "He said, aunt Petunia was the only family I had left that's why I had to stay with her but.......but she's not even my family.......so the wards that protect me at the house are.........are........nothing...........I had to stay in that hell hole for almost 15 years because........he said so........." his voice broke and SIrius and Remus both frowned hard. </p><p>"You're not going back." Heero told his little brother. "I wont allow it. You're coming to live with me. I'm your brother and I have a lot of money so don't worry about that......." </p><p>"James' family was rich and Harry inherited it all." Sirius said, showing them the ring on Harry's right ring finger. "Er.........you are entitled to all of it as eldest........"</p><p>"I don't want and or need it." Heero shrugged.</p><p>"If you want to get out of here." Hilda said, butting in again. "We have a house in Salem in America. We also have one in Boston. We live there with our niece Sabrina." </p><p>"I have houses all over the world and colonies." Quatre said, with a smile. "I'm Quatre Winner. A good friend of Heero, Duo and Wufei. I'm 19 and Arab. This is my boyfriend Trowa Barton. He's 19 and Russian. We're both very pleased to meet all of you."</p><p>Harry flinched into Sirius' side he couldn't believe any of this was actually happening. He listened to everyone talking around him. All this was happening way too fast. How did he slow this down? Better yet though he didn't know anything about his brother and was willing to go and live the man and his friends just so he could get away from the Dursleys. Was he mental or something? </p><p>Harry was indeed sure that Heero's friends would be living with them or at least close to them they seemed to be a very close knit group. He wondered how they were so close. He petted Salem the best he could and listened to everyone his mind was still racing he couldn't process this. It was too much too fast. He was too hungry and too tired and he wanted to see his friends. His head was pounding. His eyes slid closed he was so tired. He slid to the right and into Remus' arms though he didn't know who's arms they were at the time. He was soon fast asleep with Salem held in his left arm to his chest. He heard someone calling his name but was sinking so far into the darkness that he couldn't surface again. He floated into the darkness as darkness sucked him under and claimed him. He hoped beyond hope that he didn't dream. He was tired of dreaming for now he just wanted to sleep and get some actual rest.</p><hr/><p>The Gundam Pilots, Une, and the Spellman's saw how Remus and Sirius fussed and worried over Harry and wondered what their relationship with him was. It was clear that they cared for him very much. </p><p>"I think it would be best for Harry if we do get out of the U.K." Sirius sighed, "There is a war brewing in our world and everyone seems to think that Harry is the only one who can defeat the maniac. I don't want him to fight and I wont let him. Please, allow us to leave with you. I can seek asylum over there and work on getting my named clear and Harry can try to be normal and he wouldn't have to worry and take everything on himself all the time."</p><p>"I agree with Sirius." Remus nodded. "and we would very much like to get to know you as well." </p><p>"I thought that was a given." Sirius snarked at his best friend. </p><p>Remus rolled his eyes. </p><p>"This is great!" Hilda beamed. "It'll be amazing having our little nephew so close!"</p><p>Everyone agreed and plans began being made.</p>
