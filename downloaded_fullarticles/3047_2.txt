    <p>
  <span>The Evans’s died in the early hours of August 13th, 1977. Lily was shattered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There they sat, the two sisters. They sat and watched as a doctor told them what happened. Lily wasn’t sure if Petunia was paying attention, but she sure wasn’t.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had known something was terribly wrong when she had ran into the hospital and saw her sister.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Petunia, for the first time in a long while, was silent. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She did not glare at Lily, or blame her for it, like she did everything else. She had simply told her younger sister, in a quiet, broken voice, that their parents were gone.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The doctors words floated through her haze in pieces. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dead on arrival. Nothing they could do.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily felt powerless. For the first time since she realized she was a witch, there was nothing she could do to fix this.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A cry from Petunia shook Lily from her spiral and she watched as her sister ran into the arms of a man coming towards them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, Vernon, thank god you’re here.” The words were hard to here they were so quiet, but Lily still heard them. And as much as she disliked Vernon, she was happy that her sister had him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily had no one anymore. Not here. This wasn’t her world. It hadn't been for a long, long time.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her presence wasn’t needed, or wanted. She grabbed her jacket from where she had slung it over the arm of the chair and stood up. Vernon nudged her sister as she walked up to them, and she turned to face Lily, wiping tears from her eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re leaving then?” She asked, her voice filled with poorly concealed grief. Lily nodded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m going to stay with a friend for the rest of the summer. I don’t want to be a burden.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who will you stay with? So I can contact you about the funeral.” She said, leaning into Vernon. Lily ran a nervous hand through her hair and shrugged.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll call with the address.” She muttered. Both sisters knew she wouldn't call, but would send an owl. But even though Lily was pretty sure Vernon knew what she was, she wasn't certain. And she didn't want to be proved wrong, especially because he already looked at her with such disgust. Perhaps saying she was glad Petunia had him was a bit of an overstatement. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Both sisters stood looking at each other awkwardly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I guess I’ll see you around.” Lily said, turning for the exit. She was surprised to feel Petunia grab her arm to stop her as she passed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You…” She seemed to be struggling with the words. “You should come home for Christmas, Lily. I think Mom and Dad would want that.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As she looked at the first physical contact that Petunia had initiated in years, Lily knew this opportunity was fragile, and would never come again. This was their one chance to have a relationship. So she nodded, and smiled at Petunia.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I think they would to.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The sisters parted amicably. Not friends yet. But closer than before.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Time blurred, and before she knew it, Lily had paid the cab driver and was standing on the slightly unkempt lawn of her childhood home.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Memories danced in her mind, most from before Hogwarts, but some from Christmas’s and Summer’s since. There were bitter edges to some of them. Petunia’s snide, sometimes outright cruel comments. Severus’s… general presence.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But she could feel the warmth of her parents pride in her as she walked into the house.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The quiet of the house pressed against her ears. She strained to hear the click of her father’s pen as he did the crossword, or the awful soap operas her mother kept permanently on the TV. But there was nothing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>All she could hear was the faint ticking of the grandfather clock in the kitchen.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had been mulling over the thought of where to go, and she almost gasped when the thought came to her. It hit her like a jolt of lightening.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She took the stairs to her bedroom two at a time and threw the door open, sending her cat, Ringo, into a frenzy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She muttered an apology to the cat, and ignored his glare as she dug through the piles of paper on her desk. There was old potions homework, Daily Prophets from weeks ago. Letters from all of her friends from Hogwarts. Except for the one she was looking for.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Come on, come on… A-ha!” She exclaimed, holding the letter under the light triumphantly. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span><em>REMUS JOHN LUPIN</em>, glinted in purple ink.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She dumped the letter contents onto the table, and the fabric covered object clunked onto the desk.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She skimmed the letter, chuckling over Remus’s well meaning complaints that James had been made Head-Boy. At the end of the letter, she found the sentence she was looking for.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>If you want to come visit this summer, please use the port-key I’ve enclosed.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Careful not to touch the item, Lily unwrapped it. In it, was a head boy badge.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She pulled her wand out from her inner coat pocket as she left the room. She waved it so that when she came back from her shower, everything was packed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She pulled on some jeans and a sweater, and quickly braided her wet hair.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ringo meowed in protest as she picked him up and deposited him into her backpack. It didn’t last long though, as he almost immediately fell asleep in the bag.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Without jostling him, she gently pulled the straps over her shoulders. She put a smaller suitcase under her arm, and grabbed the larger one, leaving a hand free for the portkey.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She took a breath. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Brace yourself Ringo.” She said as she picked up the badge. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As soon as she did, she felt the tight tugging behind her navel as she was pulled through space. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When reality rebuilt itself around her, she fell to her knees, dropping the bags. She was surprised to feel damp grass under her knees.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Even more surprising was the house she was looking at.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was the most charming cottage she’d ever seen. Old red brick covered in ivy, an immaculately cared for garden. It seemed to be in the middle of a forest, and Lily hadn’t loved a place so quickly since the first time she walked into Hogwarts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The fact that the lights were off inside brought her crashing back into reality, even more so than literally doing that seconds before, as she realized what time it was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course, only you would show up randomly at 3 in the morning. He definitely isn't going to assume something's wrong now…” She muttered this to herself as she climbed to her feet, brushing grass off of her knees.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She realized that she only had two options. Either knock on the door and wake Remus, or wait until he woke up in the morning. Waking him now was somehow the less strange of the 2 options, so she knocked briskly on the front door.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It took a few moments, and another set of knocks, for the inside light to flick on, illuminating the front yard dimly. She could hear irritated muttering on the other side of the door, and she felt bad for being so inconsiderate. Though the shame vanished when the door swung open.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>To reveal James Potter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A very shirtless, very sleepy, James Potter.</span>
