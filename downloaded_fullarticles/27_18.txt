    <p>Harry had no idea how he got on top of a skyscraper. He was talking to Ron one minute, then poof, he vanished. He blinked before covering his ears from all the screams coming around him. Were those aliens?</p><p>With wide eyes, Harry gasped at the destruction in front of him. It looked like New York City—or what was left of it, at least.</p><p>"Another mortal?" a cold voice said from behind him. "I'm starting to think everyone has a death wish."</p><p>Harry turned around, once again blinking at the man wearing the strangest costume he had ever seen. He wore a long, green and black robe covered with armor plates on his shoulders and forearms.</p><p>He pointed at himself. "Are you sure I'm the insane one? You're wearing a ridiculous outfit!" he exclaimed as he waved his hand at him.</p><p>The mad man scowled, narrowing his eyes. "You dare mock me!" He raised his scepter, taking aim. "I, Loki, prince of—Where are you going?" he shouted, watching in disbelief as the young man ran away.</p><p>"I'm not going to stay here and die after you pointed that weapon on me," Harry answered in a shout. He knew deep down he should stay and fight, but Harry didn't know where he was. He needed to find out what was going on and how to get back home.</p><p>Entering the building, Harry spun around and ran, looking for an exit. The room was enormous, almost the size of the common room from Hogwarts. He was surprised there was even a mini bar on the other side.</p><p>"Did you really think you can get away?" Loki growled. His body was glowing both blue and green, and honestly, the color green frightened Harry.</p><p>"Yes," he said absentmindedly. "Look, I don't know where I am. I just want to go home." Why did someone always want to kill him?</p><p>As Loki was about to speak, a man calmly walked in from outside the balcony—which Harry wondered how since there was nothing out there. Where did he come from?</p><p>"Reindeer games, nice to you again—And why is there a kid here?" His voice sounded nonchalant at first before it changed into panic.</p><p>Harry was mildly offended in being called a kid. He's nineteen years old!</p><p>"I was wondering if you could tell me," Loki hissed. "He made fun of my attire!"</p><p>"He did? Good job, kid." He gave the teen a smile, though it seemed strained.</p><p>"I'm not a kid!" Harry shouted, then rubbed his eyes. This had to be a dream. A stupid dream.</p><p>Loki finally turned his attention to his enemy. He'd deal with the boy later. "If it isn't Iron Man. Come to praise me?"</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes. "My praise and your praise are totally different. In fact, I think you…" Harry tuned him out, instead pressing the button to the elevator. He had spotted it from across the room. When the elevator opened, a blast was sent flying towards it. Blowing the elevator and knocking Harry onto his back from the sudden pressure.</p><p>"Seriously, kid!" Tony groaned.</p><p>"I'm trying to get out of here! <em>Alive</em>!" Harry glared at Loki, then climbed to his feet. "And you! Why would you destroy the elevator? You could've killed me."</p><p>"What a shame," Loki replied sarcastically.</p><p>Harry had enough. "You want to play with magic? Fine, let's play with magic." He pulled his wand out from his sleeve.</p><p>"A stick?" Loki shook his head, laughing. "What's a stick going to—"</p><p>"Stupefy!" Harry roared.</p><p>Loki's eyes widened when he was hit with something strong, sending him flying towards a wall.</p><p>Tony whistled, impressed. "Damn, you just took down a villain. You're right, definitely not a kid."</p><p>Harry shrugged. It wasn't his first time.</p><p>"You're no regular mortal," Loki said from the ground. Harry couldn't help but be surprised that he was able to regain movement too soon. Anyone hit with that spell should be driven in unconsciousness.</p><p>"Maybe I'm not." Harry raised his wand and sent another <em>stupefy</em> towards him when Loki stood. He gasped as Loki easily deflected his attack. He knew magic as well. And strong enough not to need a wand. No... not another Voldemort.</p><p>"I must admit it's nice to see another person capable of handling magic like myself." Loki approached him dangerously. "But you're not strong enough to defeat me."</p><p>Harry gritted his teeth. He really didn't want to use the only spell that could stop him. "Stay back! I don't want to hurt you!" Loki ignored him by smirking, as if Harry's threat was a joke. <em>Hermione forgive me</em>, Harry thought as he flicked his wand and said, "Crucio!"</p><p>Tony watched in horror as Loki collapsed on the floor, screaming in agony. It was as if he was being tortured by an invisible force. Tony didn't know whether to feel happy or sympathetic for the Norse God.</p><p>When Harry knew he had enough, he stopped. Loki let out a whimper, chest heaving up and down nonstop. "Hey, I warned you," Harry said, sliding his wand back into his sleeve.</p><p>"What was that?" Tony asked, still shocked.</p><p>Harry didn't see the point of hiding the truth. He had a feeling he wasn't in his world anymore. "A painful spell that causes excruciating pain. May I ask who you are?"</p><p>"Tony Stark," he said with ease, waiting for the recognition he always got from people. But when the boy made no expression on his name, Tony frowned and waved his arms around. "You're kidding me. You don't know who I am?"</p><p>"Am I supposed to?"</p><p>"Uh, <em>yeah</em>," Tony replied with annoyance. "Do you live under a rock? Everyone knows who I am!"</p><p>Harry's lips curled downward. "Well, I don't and I really don't care. No offense. I only want to go home." He glanced around his surroundings. "Perhaps you can show me the exit since this," he pointed to the elevator, "was destroyed."</p><p>"No can do, kid. You took down a God few seconds ago. Do you really expect me to let you walk out of here like nothing?" Tony argued.</p><p>"Yes," then he decided to stop being nice, "unless you want a taste on what he had," Harry said with a scowl, glaring at Loki for a moment before his eyes went back to Tony.</p><p>Tony narrowed his eyes, his calm demeanor gone. "You did not just threatened me. Please tell me you didn't. That would be stupid of you, kid."</p><p>"Stop calling me a kid!" Harry snapped.</p><p>Tony placed his hand on his ear, then began to talk to himself. "No, Loki is down. Wasn't me. Some kid with the weirdest glasses stopped him. And can you believe that he threatened me? I'm going to need assistance."</p><p>Harry did not like the sound of that. Was he going to deal with more crazy people? Dealing with someone who had magic like Harry was simple enough, but muggles? Harry couldn't hurt them. They didn't know any better. Harry stared at the defeated God, wondering if he knew a way to send him back home.</p><p>"Loki," he called, "you have powerful magic, right?"</p><p>"W-What... a stupid question non-mortal," Loki uttered out. "My magic is powerful." He was still out of breath from all the pain he endured.</p><p>Tony eyed Harry warily. "Don't do anything stupid. My team are on their way."</p><p>Harry took a deep breath and cast a <em>Petrificus Totalus</em> onto Tony. "I'm sorry, Mr. Stark. I can't have any interference." He rushed towards Loki. "I'm going to help you, but only if you promise to help me return home, got it?"</p><p>Loki's lips twisted into a snarl, then forced a smile. "Then I shall help you." Harry knew that Loki would try to kill him on first chance he got. He'd be stupid not to think that.</p><p>"Give me your hand," Harry rushed out.</p><p>"What—"</p><p>"Your hand, now!" He grasped it. "I'm going to do something unspeakable that way I know you don't screw me over." He knew that they needed a third party for this, but luckily, the elder wand was able to do it on its own.</p><p>Loki had obeyed. He felt the sudden magic coursing through him. It was strange. Strong and soothing.</p><p>"Do you, Loki, promise to aid me on helping me to return home?" He made sure the wand was above their joined hands, waiting for Loki's answers.</p><p>"I will."</p><p>"And will you ensure that nothing harms me when I'm around others if I'm unable to protect myself?" Harry knew he was pushing it, but it had to be done.</p><p>"Why you little—" Loki halted when the magic pulsed painfully through him. "Yes! I'll protect you," he breathed through gritted teeth. He couldn't believe he was tricked by the younger man.</p><p>Harry muttered the spell and waved the wand once, sealing the vow. It's done. The magic eased from the both of them.</p><p>He let go, then jumped when he heard a gunshot beside him. Harry snapped his head up, seeing a red-haired woman, aiming her gun directly at him. A blond man was kneeling next to Tony, checking to see if he was alive. He had put down his shield.</p><p>"Tony, Tony!" The blond man shook him. "He's breathing but his body is stiff."</p><p>Harry got a hold on Loki again, without taking his eyes off the other intruders. "He'll be fine in an hour. Tell him I'm sorry," and with that being said, Harry vanished with Loki in toll.</p><p>"We need to tell Fury!" the blond man shouted.</p>
