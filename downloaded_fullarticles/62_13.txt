  <span>“So remind me what the purpose of this assignment is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville drops his head with a thud, luckily cushioned by the copious number of magazines strewn across the wobbly table. His half-drunk coffee mug rattles. “I barely know anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you having some psychotic break?” Harry asks, flipping to the next page (a scratch &amp; sniff perfume advert), “Should I be worried?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The barista calls out their refresh order and Neville stands instantly. “I’ll get this round. Need a sec to unmelt my brain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry smirks and shakes his head as he calls out after Neville, “We need to at least get you back to jello-status.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He flips a few pages absently, nothing particularly eye catching for this ‘psychology of consumer desire’ something or other assignment. This’ll teach Neville to try and catch a chat with a cute girl by enrolling in an ‘interesting’ class outside his field. That’s all well and good pre-masters. Now it’s a semester killing decision that Harry, as a good mate, is required to assist with. This probably his least favorite bout as a wingman.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just as he’s resuming his post-self-pity skimming, Neville returns to the table with two fresh coffees. “How goes it? Have enough sticky notes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nods absently and then frowns. “Why would they do this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville’s brow furrows as he scoots closer to view Harry’s magazine. “Do - a photoshoot?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Those knickers, Nev!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, ladies wear them just like gents - well apart from our little trap door,” Neville muses, sighing as he lets his eyes drift shut while the espresso slips down his throat, “But that’s beside the point I s’pose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s as if two parallel conversations are taking place, as Neville continues his mini-dissertation comparing and contrasting knickers and pants and Harry deep dives into his personal crusade against fashionable clothes that cause infections and other health problems...down under.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The health implications of wearing non-breathable clothing down there for hours at a time - this is </span>
  <em>
    <span>underthings</span>
  </em>
  <span>! How long does the average person keep a pair on?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville finally realizes he’s expected to respond and blinks, “Depends - are they in uni?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry chuckles and rolls his eyes. “Well I just hope Red here got those off right after the photo.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And before he can even begin to comprehend how creepy that statement tends to sound, a voice sounds from somewhere over his shoulder. “Well the photog was a bit of a prick and made me prance around for another hour. But what can you do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry turns and. Well he’s not being creepy but, she’s wearing a crop top and a mini skirt (and yes he really does have a thing for combat boots with tights) so he can pretty quickly ascertain that she </span>
  <em>
    <span>is </span>
  </em>
  <span>in fact, the model in question. He’s observant and she’s got </span>
  <em>
    <span>so many</span>
  </em>
  <span> freckles. So he takes all that in and then simply gapes up at her, like an imbecile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luckily, Neville’s on hand to keep him from getting socked. “I swear, he’s not a sleaze. Just an overprotective medical genius.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> so lucky.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sneaky sweater knickers model taps her chin and Harry will admit (in the privacy of his own mind) that he gets a bit distracted by that freckle on her lip, and then by her rich whiskey-brown eyes. (He might not be a sleaze, but he’s definitely in rough shape.) “Medical genius, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s answer is something of a grimace while Neville sinks back in his chair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucky for Harry, the Starbucks Inquisition seems aimed mainly at him. “So is this some odd pick up attempt? Does your wingman usually look like he’s about to wee himself?”</span>
