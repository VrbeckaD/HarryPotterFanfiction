    <p>Warning* This is an alternate universe of both the Hogwarts Mystery Game and Sonic the Hedgehog series. Do not take cannon as god in this because characters will have age changed, families changed, and will be acting differently from the cannon universe.

Rowena Ravenclaw was a Raven that had the wisdom of an owl (on her father’s side), and valued intelligence and Wisdom from her students. Finally came Rowena’s best friend, Helga Hufflepuff, a kindly plump lady who believed in loyalty, patience, and hardworking students. The four of them created the school known as Hogwarts. Thousands of years after this is where our story begins…</p>
