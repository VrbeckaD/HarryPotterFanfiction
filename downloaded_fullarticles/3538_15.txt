    <p><strong><u>The Summer before the start of their Seventh Year</u></strong><br/>
<br/>
Remus Lupin glimpsed a familiar silhouette hurrying down the opposite corridor. Like any impulsive teenager, he ran to catch up even before he realized the reason why. The person he was pursuing took a sudden sharp right, then disappeared behind swinging double doors. </p><p>He was about to push through to follow when someone walked out, narrowly missing bumping into each other. </p><p>"Sorry," Remus mumbled, making an attempt to side step the stranger. </p><p>"You're not allowed through here," the person blocking his path said.</p><p>It took a while for Remus to look up, preoccupied as he was in his single-minded task to not lose sight of his quarry completely.</p><p>"I'm sorry?" he told the person blocking his path: a tall, dark woman in white researcher's robes. </p><p>"I know you're sorry," she said. "You're still not passing through here. Exit is that way." She pointed to the opposite direction, to where most people were headed. </p><p>"I... I mean, I think I saw a friend passing through there." </p><p>The woman didn't respond immediately, apparently waiting for him to offer more information though he's at a loss as to what she wanted from him. </p><p>She soon sighed, taking it upon herself to break the brief stalemate. "What's your friend's name?"</p><p>"Er.. pardon?"</p><p>"Your friend's name?"</p><p>"Er... Se... Sn... Snape. Severus Snape." His statement came out inflected like a question, tailing with a high note like a nervous bird in front of a cat. </p><p>"You're asking me?" She raised one amused eyebrow in a way that's somewhat familiar to him. Someone he knew had such a sarcastic gesture as well. </p><p>"No, I mean, my friend's name is Severus Snape."</p><p>She looked him up and down before grabbing the small tag hanging on a lanyard around his neck. "Werewolf serum trials participant," she read the small script under a photo of him that was constantly rotating to show all sides of his face and head. "How did it go for you, I wonder?" Remus somehow knew that it was rhetorical question, so he kept quiet. He watched her conjure up a parchment and then another, and just in case, another parchment from seemingly out of nowhere. </p><p>After a while, she vanished all the parchments and said, "No one called Severus nor Snape is listed as volunteer participant in the WST project or... any of our other projects, really. Are you sure?" </p><p>"I..." To be honest, it had been a fleeting glimpse at best. In the short silence while waiting for the woman to finish going through her list, Remus had managed to convince himself that he must've been seeing things, chasing after mirages. The research attendants did say that the newer serum they're testing could cause vision problems as a temporary side effect, among others.</p><p>"You'll have to let me know if there's someone not part of the project roaming the building. We do not tolerate trespassers or unauthorized persons, even if it's a friend of a participant," she said, quite seriously and rather urgently. She wasn't that much taller than him, but at that particular moment, she seemed to loom larger than life, towering above him, putting him on the spot. </p><p>"No... er..." He fumbled for words. Soon, he faltered and slumped. He settled for shaking his head.   </p><p>"Anything else?" She leaned back, and the dark looming threat seemed to recede back as well. She looked amused. "You know your way back, I hope," she had not the will nor the time to babysit a lost teenager. </p><p>"No... er... yes... er.... thank you," Remus said, casting one last lingering look at the double doors behind her as though he had the ability to see through solid oak doors, before turning to where the exits were. His parents would've been antsy by now, waiting in a room reserved for accompanying family and guardians. His session ended at least half an hour ago, by his estimation, and he had never been late on returning. His overactive teenage imagination hoped that his parents were not causing a ruckus or sending a search team for him.</p><p>She watched him leave, making sure the teenager walk himself past the exit checkpoint, all the while wondering whether they'd put in too much sopophorus bean shavings in the latest batch of serum. </p><p>-</p><p>
  <strong> <u>Present Day</u> </strong>
</p><p>Sirius Black had been knocked into the Veil and ended up on his bum on... Dumbledore's couch? There's no doubt about it: chintzy and frilly, the patterning different from when he first sat in it as a schoolboy, but uniquely Dumbledore that there's no way he could be wrong.</p><p>Even if he had doubts, it was soon dispelled once he lifted his eyes and saw the same old man smiling at him from across the room, seated in a similarly chintzy wing-back next to a cozy fireplace.</p><p>"Hello, dear boy," the headmaster said, with a hint of I-know-something-you-don't. Dumbledore calmly waited for Sirius to gather his wits, taking a leisurely sip from a fine porcelain cup. A matching saucer floated rather sedately next to him.</p><p>Rather than replying, however, Sirius merely fell onto his knees and emptied the meager content of his stomach onto Dumbledore's finely woven carpet. He thought he recognized some chopped carrots from among unrecognizable overly digested food covering finely embroidered stars twinkling at him in disgust.</p><p>"...mothion sikhneth..." Sirius feebly offered an unsought-for explanation, pushing words past bile and days-old food that thickly coated the insides of his mouth. He heaved some more, moaning rather apologetically and unintelligibly.</p><p>"Think nothing of it," Dumbledore said, quite unbothered, as if Veil victims appeared unannounced every day on his couch. "It's self-cleaning. A necessary thing in a school," the old man explained fondly, though more to himself rather than to the vomiting man.</p><p>Dumbledore sipped on his tea now and again, while Sirius heaved now and again, nausea persisting even if there's nothing more to bring up.</p><p>A house elf appeared a few moments after Sirius finally stopped, slumped quite bonelessly and rather out of breath against the foot of the couch. A Hogwarts house elf, he thought, not that he cared. His nose, mouth, chin and neck was magically cleaned, harsh and impersonal. Some ginger-smelling drink was pressed up insistently upon his lips. He didn't drink it, but brought it up to his nose to blot out the stench of bile.</p><p>It was a while later, once he was cleaner and a smidgen more composed, that they spoke. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Dumbledore's office. Unmistakable sounds of children stampeding out of their last classes for the day filtered up through thick office doors.</p><p>"Perfect timing, Sirius, my boy," Dumbledore said as they waited for a fourth pot of tea to materialize in place of an empty third. "I need you to do something for me."</p><p>"A job?"</p><p>"Something like it." A pause. Cup and saucers. The birds outside. Sounds like broken glass after the eerie quiet of the Veil. "Though not right away," Dumbledore said with a kind smile. "I gather you'll need a night to recuperate, falling into Veils can be nasty, indeed."</p><p>"A night?"</p><p>Dumbledore sighed heavily, seemingly on purpose for Sirius to hear. His benevolent smile went away with the sun that slipped beneath the horizon, if it were there at all. A mirage, perhaps, Sirius thought. The setting sun chilled his bones. "Fine, two nights, but I can't spare you more than that. There's a war out there you know."</p><p>-</p><p>'Remus is going to have a child!' Sirius pondered that piece of news as he readied himself for bed. </p><p>The news delighted him more than he thought it would. He's sure he had never felt such joy, not since Prongs told him that Lily was pregnant with Prongslet.</p><p>Remus was going to have a child, Dumbledore had told him, and he was to ensure that Grimmauld Place would have everything an expectant mother might need to keep her and the baby healthy and happy.</p><p>"Does this mean that Tonks will be staying with me?" Sirius had asked, soon after he got out questions like: Boy or girl? Do you know what they're going to name the baby? Who'd be the baby's godparents?</p><p>"Well, we do hold Order meetings at Grimmauld Place, so..." Dumbledore had replied in that cryptic way of his. Sirius thought that perhaps the old man wanted Tonks to stay with him so she didn't have to commute whenever they had Order meetings. He wondered whether she would stop doing so much Auror-ing now that she's pregnant.</p><p>Sirius was never close to his nephew. She would probably not appreciate any well-meaning suggestions from him. They probably wouldn't get along like a house on fire, either, but that didn't mean he wasn't fond enough of her. </p><p>He wondered what girls, or rather, women... particularly women like Nymphadora would like. He wondered if he should ask Andromeda, but then he realized that it had been literal ages since he had spoken to her last. He wouldn't even know where to start to contact her.</p><p>He nodded off to sleep wondering whether one day he would have a child or two of his own.</p>
