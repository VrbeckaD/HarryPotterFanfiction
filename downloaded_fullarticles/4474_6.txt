          <div class="userstuff"><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Scorpius stepped out of the Potters’ fireplace, for a moment he thought he’d shouted the wrong address.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was as if a hurricane had swept through the living room, leaving nothing but disaster in its path. Ribbons were strewn across the floor, bits of Spellotape were stuck to all sorts of unlikely surfaces, including the ceiling, and torn wrapping paper seemed to have fallen like confetti. In the midst of this chaotic scene were James and Albus Potter, who appeared to be wrestling each other on the carpet.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Perhaps he should have told Albus he'd be visiting, rather than barge into his house mere minutes after returning from his trip to France. He didn't know what he'd walked in on, exactly, but it seemed... violent.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“They’ve been at it for about ten minutes now,” a voice said at his side, making him jump.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He looked down at Lily, who was sitting cross-legged on the floor and watching her brothers with mild interest. She spared him a quick glance and a smile before turning her attention back to the spectacle.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Um.” Scorpius stared at her, then at the two boys, then at her again. “Is everything okay?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, yes, brilliant,” Lily said breezily. “They’ve been riling each other up all afternoon, so this was bound to happen. It’s your fault, actually.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“<em>My</em> fault?” he squeaked. Had he somehow offended James? Had he unwittingly created a rift between the two siblings? Was Albus defending his honour right now, having chosen to side with his boyfriend rather than his own brother? “Did I do something? Have I–”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Nah, you’re fine.” Lily waved a hand dismissively. “But James is having a little too much fun with the fact that Al’s got a boyfriend. And he’s jealous because you’re here for Christmas and his girlfriend isn’t, so he’s being a nuisance. Rose and I had a bet going on, to see how long it’d take Albus to crack and try to murder him. She owes me two Galleons.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“<em>HA</em>!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">James had managed to pin a struggling Albus to the ground and was currently gloating while his brother swore loudly at him. With a triumphant grin, he turned to Lily, but paused when he saw she wasn’t alone. He stared at Scorpius for a few moments, his brown eyes wide and his lips forming a perfect ‘O’.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius smiled nervously. He rather liked James, even though he could be a bit of a handful sometimes. There was never a quiet moment when he was around: he was always buzzing with excitement, asking questions or sharing stories of his troublemaking exploits, his reddish-brown hair sticking up in all directions because he constantly ran his hands through it. He really couldn’t have been more different from quiet, self-conscious Albus. He was nice, though, and he didn’t seem to mind Scorpius at all.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">James grinned at him. “Hey, mate. Didn’t hear you Floo in. How was France?” he said casually. Then he leaned down really close to Albus’s ear and said in a sing-song voice, “Your boooyfriend’s here, Al.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Scorpius?” Albus perked up instantly. He tried to wriggle out of his brother’s grasp, but without much success: James played Keeper for a reason, after all. “Geroff, you great prat–”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">James finally released him, looking very pleased with himself, and Albus whacked him in the shoulder with discarded roll of wrapping paper before walking away. His scowl vanished as soon as he set eyes on Scorpius, though, and watching it happen made him feel warm all over.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hi,” Albus said breathlessly, coming to a stop just a few inches away. His hair was a complete disaster, much like his brother’s; all of that rolling around on the floor had made glitter and bits of torn wrapping paper stick to it. Scorpius thought he looked adorable; so adorable, in fact, that he’d pulled him into a hug before he’d had the chance to even think about it. But Albus didn’t seem to mind. He returned the hug in kind, burying his face in Scorpius’s shoulder and inhaling deeply, as if having Scorpius in his arms were as comforting as a breath of fresh air. When they finally separated, his lips were pulled up into that boyish, Albus-y grin that made Scorpius’s heart do somersaults.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He beamed at him. “Did you know you’ve got Spellotape on your face?” He pulled off a strip that had stuck to Albus’s cheek, then pressed a kiss to the exact same spot.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">James make obnoxious kissing noises. He was sprawled out on the sofa, smirking at them both.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Albus rolled his eyes. “Will you<em> stop</em>?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Not unless you make me. Ready for another round, Alby?” James taunted, waggling his eyebrows.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No,” Albus said flatly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Keen to avoid another confrontation between the two brothers, Scorpius reached out a hand to brush away the mess from Albus’s hair; only a few bits came off. “Do you want to go upstairs and – er – clean up a bit?” he asked hesitantly. He realised how that sounded. Merlin, they all probably thought he wanted to drag Albus upstairs so they could snog. Not that he’d mind snogging Albus –it was his favourite pastime, well ahead of reading and chess– but having other people know about it was… weird.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Can’t,” Albus sighed. “Mum’s locked the door.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius didn’t see what the problem was. “You could… unlock it?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The three Potters stared at him as though he’d suggested stealing an egg from a Hungarian Horntail.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I like being alive, thanks,” said James, stretching on the sofa so that his feet dangled off the edge. “And death by Bag-Bogey Hex isn’t how I want to go.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mum would know,” Albus explained to Scorpius. “She’d go ballistic if we so much as <em>touched</em> the door.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This was just getting stranger and stranger. He frowned. “And why has your mother locked you in the living room?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Family bonding,” Albus said gloomily. “We’re supposed to spend the afternoon wrapping presents and being <em>nice</em> to each other.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“She’s getting mushy in her old age,” James said, nodding in agreement.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And she’s going to flip if she comes back and we haven’t finished,” Lily pointed out. She’d been watching the boys with her chin resting on her hands. “We were almost halfway done, but <em>some idiots</em>–”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah, Lily, we know.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Thanks, Lily.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius surveyed the living room once again. It really was a disaster. Scattered on the floor were small piles of all sorts of knickknacks: books, expensive-looking quills, a chess set… And the wrapping paper was <em>everywhere</em>: great strips of it littered every surface, and a couple of rolls were bent as though they’d been used as Beaters’ bats. Scorpius wondered if they’d have enough to wrap the remaining presents.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Do you need help?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Unsurprisingly, they did.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They settled into a comfortable rhythm: Albus took care of the actual wrapping because he was the neatest, James wrote out the names in the gift tags, and Scorpius and Lily tied the ribbons around the presents. The Potters took care to explain which present was for whom, and their family tree was such a mess that Scorpius got lost once or twice. It wasn’t a particularly deep conversation, but it made him feel warm and cosy all the same; he felt like he really could belong with all of the Potters, not just Albus. Even though Scorpius’s intentions when he’d Floo’d over had been to spend time with his boyfriend, he found himself enjoying this almost as much. And it wasn’t like he didn’t have Albus with him; they kept nudging each other, with shy glances and quick smiles.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Scorpius and Albus, sitting in a tree…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“See that bauble, James? You can grab it and shove it up your–”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Scorpius! Can you help me with this bow?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">By late afternoon, they were done, and he was braiding Lily’s hair while James and Albus argued about the latest match between the Chudley Canons (which Albus supported) and Puddlemere United (which James played for). Scorpius had discovered that they could bicker about absolutely everything; they knew exactly which buttons to push to get a reaction, but they never went too far. Albus even laughed every now and then, a beautiful smile lighting up his freckled face and making his green eyes sparkle, and it was the most endearing thing Scorpius had ever seen.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He missed you, you know,” Lily said quietly, startling him out of his thoughts.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He blinked, confused. “He saw me less than a week ago.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He missed you <em>a lot</em>.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His lips pulled up into a pleased little smile. “Really?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mm-hmm.” Lily turned her head so she could wink at him. “D’you want me to distract James for a bit? As a thank-you for the braid.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’d appreciate it.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lily would have made an excellent Slytherin. Scorpius didn’t know how she did it, but she managed to take James to the other end of the living room without any fuss, leaving Albus and Scorpius on their own.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Albus didn’t waste any time: he made a headway for the sofa, dragging Scorpius along by the hand. Scorpius was surprised to find himself on Albus’s lap, then pleased when he received a brief but passionate kiss. It was over much too soon, but then Albus curled up next to him, slipping an arm around his waist.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m glad you’re back,” he mumbled, resting his head on his shoulder.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius laughed. “I was gone for five days, Albus.” But he’d missed him too.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I know. It felt like five years.” After throwing a furtive glance at his siblings, who weren’t paying attention to them, he quickly pecked Scorpius on the lips again. “I’m sorry you got dragged into Potter bonding time.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I enjoyed it, actually,” he said with a smile. “I like wrapping presents, and your family’s fun.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, yes, they're delightful,” Albus said dryly. “My life would be <em>so</em> sad without James’s pestering.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He doesn’t mind, does he?” Scorpius asked nervously. “About… us.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Albus snorted. “’Course he doesn’t. He thinks you’re great. <em>Everyone</em> thinks you’re great.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius plucked a stray bit of wrapping paper from his hair. Lightning-fast, Albus grabbed his hand and laced their fingers together. Scorpius’s smile widened. “You’re pretty great yourself.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Afternoon faded into evening while they talked and stole kisses when they thought they could get away with it. It was a bit more public than Scorpius would have liked, and he certainly couldn’t wait to get Albus on his own, preferably at the Manor where they wouldn’t be disturbed, but it was still nice. He almost felt disappointed when the fire glowed green and a redheaded woman stepped out of it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, hello, Scorpius,” Ginny said cheerfully. If she was surprised by the sight of her son resting his head on Scorpius’s lap, she gave no sign of it. “Al mentioned you might drop in at some point. Would you like to stay for dinner?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius hesitated, but Albus was giving him that pleading look he knew he couldn’t resist. “I’d love to, Mrs Potter. If it’s not a problem, of course.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ginny beamed at him. “Not at all.” Her gaze slid down to her son, and she frowned. “Albus, what happened to your hair?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Er – nothing,” Albus said innocently. “Run for it,” he muttered to Scorpius, gripping his hand and sitting up. Scorpius opened his mouth to ask why, but then it hit him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They’d forgotten to tidy up the aftermath of James and Albus’s wrestling match, and it looked <em>bad</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They snuck out as discreetly as possible while Harry and Ginny gaped at the state of their living room, and they’d just hit the bottom of the staircase when their heard the beginnings of the explosion:</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Why is there <em>Spellotape</em> on the <em>ceiling</em>?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Struggling to contain their laughter, they grinned at each other and ran.</span>
