    <p>“What is that?”</p><p>“What do you mean what is it? I think it’s pretty obvious. It’s a cuppa.” Lily replied as she stuck the mug out at him. “Black tea, two lumps of sugar, splash of milk.”</p><p>“You know how I take my tea?” He asked as he took the mug from her hand.</p><p>Lily shrugged as she sat down next to James on the common room couch.</p><p>James blew on the tea and then took a slow slip. “In the six years we’ve gone to school and the last two years that we’ve been friends you have never brought me tea.”</p><p>Lily laughed, “That’s what has you so bewildered. Worried I slipped something in, Potter?”</p><p>James smiled, “No, I reckon you don’t need to slip a love potion in.” He blushed slightly and looked back at the table.</p><p>“Who says I would be interested in a love potion?” She winked at him. “More likely to use a silencing potion if anything.”</p><p>James laughed then turned towards her.</p><p>“Don’t feel sorry for me.”</p><p>Lily shook her head, “I don’t.”</p><p>“Yes, you do!” He argued then lifted up the mug before muttering, “Obviously.”</p><p>“No, James I really don’t. I think you’re sad, worried and you don’t need to be.”</p><p>“Lily, it was a big deal.”</p><p>“It was one match, James.”</p><p>“It was the cup. We lost the cup to Slytherin. Just had to lose to Slytherin.  Rosier was awful afterwards.  Gloating up a storm.  All my fault…played like rubbish. Couldn’t get anything going with McKinnon and the entire team fell apart because of it.”</p><p>“That’s not true.  It was a tough match and would have been for anyone. Slytherin played really well. Everything went their way.”</p><p>“How would you know? It’s not like you were there.”</p><p>“Of course, I was!”</p><p>James lifted his head, “You were? You hardly ever come to the matches.”</p><p>“It was the last match of the year and y…” She trailed off not finishing her thought and then quietly asked, “is that the only reason that you’re upset.  Losing the cup?”</p><p>James looked down, not meeting her gaze and shrugged.</p><p>“James?”</p><p>“Scouts, Lil,” he whispered and she nodded. “There were scouts at the match, here at Hogwarts. I had a shot at professional quidditch and I blew it.  I had to be perfect and I wasn’t.”</p><p>“Today wasn’t your only chance to impress them.”</p><p>James shook his head. “Sometimes all you get is one match with these guys, Lil. That might have been my only shot.”</p><p>“I don’t believe that,” Lily said with conviction, “if you want to play professional quidditch then you will.”</p><p>James smiled but didn’t say anything else. He took a sip of the tea and every once in awhile he would glance over at Lily who was looking back at him. He rested his head on the back of the couch, closing his eyes. Slowly Lily placed her hand over his and laced their fingers together and then leaned back next to him resting her head on his shoulder.</p><p>“It’s not your last match ever, James.  You’ll rally next year.  I know that you will.  I have a feeling that next year is going to be your best year yet.”</p><p> </p><p> </p>
