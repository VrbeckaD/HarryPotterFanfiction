    <p>Draco was going back to Hogwarts, mostly, because he really didn't know what else to do, but also because it was part of his deal with the ministry. The stupid deal Stupid Harry Potter had made with the ministry when he defended him in the trials. Stupid Harry Potter who could make everyone do anything by the mere whiff of his hand. It all just resulted in Draco being indebted to Stupid Harry Potter. And he would never be able to pay him back for this. Stupid Harry Potter surely loved having Draco in his pocket. He was probably plotting all the things he was going to make Draco do now that Draco literally owed him his life several times over. Stupid Harry Potter with his Stupid saviour complex and his Stupid scar that everyone worshipped. </p><p> </p><p>Draco was so deep in his self pity spiral that he didn't notice the compartment door opening. He stared out the window with a scowl on his face trying to think of all the ways Stupid Harry Potter was a totally the worst person on earth. </p><p>"Oh.. Malfoy.. Can I sit here?" The voice made draco jump and he was ready to curse out the person that no they very well could not sit here, could they not see that draco was very much not in the mood to listen to anyone gush over Stupid Harry Potter who had oh so graciously saved poor Death eater Malfoy.</p><p>However, when he looked up to do just that, he completely froze because wasn't that just great? It was the prat-who-lived himself. The fight fizzled out of Draco and he just half-heartedly shrugged and went back to staring out the window this time just to avoid looking at Stupid Harry Potter's face with his Stupid green eyes and his Stupid hair that never would lay down flat. Stupid Potter sat down across from him looking expectantly at Draco, but Draco didn't react nor moved his eyes from the window. Couldn't Stupid Harry Potter have given Draco at least till they arrived at the castle before he started holding the debt over his head. Wasn’t Stupid Harry Potter supposed to be the bigger person with the heart of gold. Draco had heard that Stupid Harry Potter had even tried to get the Dark Lord to show remorse and surrender. What a stupid Stupid Harry Potter thing to do. </p><p>"MALFOY," Stupid Harry Potter almost yelled, when draco hadn't reacted to the first couple of times he had said his name. </p><p>Draco sighed and answered a tired "What?". He couldn't get himself to turn his head and actually look at Stupid Harry Potter. Definitely not because he would start crying, because Malfoys didn't cry in public. Not that being a Malfoy meant anything anymore. If Draco was honest he would rather not be a Malfoy, because look at the good it had done him. </p><p>"Are you okay?" Stupid Harry Potter asked. His fake concern was very convincing, if it wasn’t for the fact that Draco knew that Stupid Harry Potter did not care one bit about Draco’s feelings, he might even have answered honestly. </p><p>"Yes, Potter. What do you want?" Draco desperately hoped Stupid Harry Potter couldn't hear the small quiver in his voice. </p><p>"Nothing, Hermione and Ron are making out in our compartment and I got tired of third wheeling them. So I went for a walk and found you."</p><p>"Right," Draco said with none of his usual drawl. "Where is your usual fan group.”</p><p>Stupid Harry Potter snorted: "Oh the ones that just want to stare at my forehead and be to scared to say anything to me."</p><p>"Mhmm..."  </p><p>"Why are you here alone? Where are the other slytherins?" Stupid Harry Potter asked instead. </p><p>"Somewhere not here," just because Draco owed Stupid Harry Potter everything didn't mean he would have to like it. Draco added on in a mumble. "probably a lot better than here"</p><p>"But it’s Hogwarts?"</p><p>"Exactly," sighed Draco. "Not all of us are gonna get star treatment when we get there like you, boy saviour and the rest of the golden trio"</p><p>"I'm not a saviour," Stupid Harry Potter mumbled and said directly to Draco: "And you were pardoned, and all charges were dropped against you?" </p><p>"Try telling that to all the students that lost family and friends to the Dark Lord’s cause and all the people tortured last school year," Draco didn't even have the energy to sound aggravated; he was too tired. Tired with his life. With this conversation and most of all with Stupid Harry Potter who never could keep his Stupid Hero nose out of other people’s business. </p><p>Maybe Stupid Harry Potter finally got Dracos malaise with the whole situation or he just didn't know what to answer, but no matter, Stupid Harry Potter finally shut up and he too looked out the window. Draco relaxed his shoulders and was able to actually focus on the landscape outside. The trees and hills flying by had a calming effect and Draco almost forgot that Stupid Harry Potter was sitting there across from him. </p><p> </p><p>The wonderful silence was unfortunately broken by Stupid Harry Potter asking him if he wanted to play chess. </p><p>"Sure, Potter, whatever you want." And thus Potters little games must begin. At first it might start out like this with small asks that sounded like he had a choice and then later they would end it with who knows what, but it surely would be something that would not end well for Draco.<br/>
When he didn’t get a reaction at first Draco turned his head and saw Stupid Harry Potter’s Stupid face looking at him with surprise. </p><p>"Wait really?" </p><p>"Didn’t I say so?"</p><p>"Yeah, but I never actually expected you to say yes." </p><p>"Then why did you ask, " Draco looked one last time at Stupid Harry Potters face and leaned his head to rest against the window. He closed his eyes and muttered: "Merlin, Potter, you’re so stupid. Can you please make up your mind, or let me sleep." </p><p>"Oh sorry, I- you- I will let you be, you could just have said you didn't want to be disturbed," Stupid Harry Potter actually sounded like he meant it. What a fool.</p><p>"Sure I could," Draco just wanted to left alone. Why didn't Stupid Harry Potter leave him alone? What did he want from him? Draco tried thinking of all the possible reasons Stupid Harry Potter would seek him out this early on the train ride. He risked a quick look at Potter who too looked deep in thought. His eyebrows scrunched up making his forehead wrinkled. Draco's fingers twitched - probably because he wanted to punch the Stupid Harry Potter’s stupid face. </p><p> </p><p>Draco had thought Stupid Harry Potter would leave him alone when the silence got to awkward but no Draco had to sit the whole train ride definitely not being constantly aware of Stupid Harry Potter and his Stupid green eyes that would try to stare holes into Draco’s face. It was a new tactic Draco had to admit, but also quite useless, so he couldn't really see what was Stupid Harry Potter's plan here.<br/>
When it finally was time for them to leave the train Draco tried getting to the carriages as quickly as possible, avoiding everybody else and keeping his head low. The students around him seemed more caught up in their own world and each other to really care about him at this point. He would take whatever blessings he could get. Fortunately, he also managed to lose Stupid Harry Potter in the crowd.</p>
