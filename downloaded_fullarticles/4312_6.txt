    <p>Severus woke up slowly, languorously, enjoying the sensation of being able to take his time. It was his birthday, and the first birthday living almost alone. He liked to consider himself as living alone, but Sirius always objected when he said that. The way he saw it, it was the first year of his life when he could do exactly as he wished on his birthday. As a child they had been so entirely unmarked that he hadn’t even known he had one until Lily had asked, and he’d had to go rummage through his parents’ things to locate his birth certificate. At Hogwarts he had had to spend time with classmates that he despised, and for a time the Marauders took pleasure in playing a particularly nasty prank every birthday, though he had never figured out how they had found out when it was. His only suspect was Lily, but she swore she hadn’t been the leak.</p><p>He intended to spend the day doing nothing, pleasing no one and ideally entirely alone. For the first time he had the power to do so, and he intended to take great pleasure in exercising that ability.</p><p>As he opened his eyes he noticed a shadow lurking in the doorway of his small bedsit. His first thought was that it was Sirius, appeared as he almost always did, mainly because he had a key and for some reason preferred Severus’s company more than anyone else’s. He claimed it was because they were dating and in love, but Severus wasn’t entirely convinced. It didn’t sound particularly realistic in many ways. Not that he was objecting, mind. Just, cautious.</p><p>Sirius, however, did not have large rabbit ears. He blinked his eyes blearily, before sitting up in bed. He stared in horror, clutching at his duvet. Before him was a human sized rabbit monster, though after a moment he acknowledged that it could be a human in a rabbit monster costume. That, in many ways, made even less sense than an actual rabbit monster, as he couldn’t think of a single reason why anyone would dress up in something so terrifying and hideous. He had always thought rabbits were pretty cute, but not this one. It was a not particularly nice pastel pink, even taking into account the opinions of people that might like pastel pink. The head was disproportionately large for the body, with bulbous yellow eyes and a toothy smile that reminded Severus of the concept of serial killers in general. He had never before heard of a rabbit monster serial killer, but he was seriously concerned that he might be its first victim.</p><p>He slowly reached for his wand, genuinely afraid that he might be about to be murdered on his birthday, which seemed too unfair even for his already deeply miserable existence. The rabbit monster thing took a step towards him and started to sing.</p><p>“Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Severus, happy birthday to you!”</p><p>The singing was muffled, to the extent that Severus was initially uncertain why it was that he vaguely recognised the voice. The rabbit waved two giant paws that Severus suspected would haunt his nightmares for the rest of his life, and said, “Happy birthday!”</p><p>Severus whipped out his wand and set the creature on fire. There was a startled yelp of pain, and with a few more flicks he ensured that it was only the costume that burnt, falling to a smouldering heap of ash on the floor that Severus knew he would have to clean later on. What remained where the rabbit monster had stood was Sirius. He was entirely naked and had a faintly wounded expression on his face.</p><p>“What did you do that for?” he asked, “I got dressed up specially for your birthday!”</p><p>“What the fuck? Why the fucking hell would you do that? What? The? Fuck?” Severus asked, his heart rate still jumpy. It was probably the worst awakening he had ever had in his life, and he had a lot of experience of shitty awakenings. He had a lot of shitty life experiences in general.</p><p>“I thought you liked bunnies?” Sirius asked, clearly confused why Severus was reacting the same way any sane human being would, “And I heard that muggles had these things called Playboy Bunnies, which are considered sexy so I thought you’d love it. It’s a part of your muggle background so I thought it would be the perfect present…”</p><p>“Never give me a present ever again…” Severus pleaded, with little hope.</p>
