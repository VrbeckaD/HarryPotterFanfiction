    <p>*Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at the two large ice-creams to show he couldn't come in. *</p><p>His voice, however, does make it through the glass as he shouts 'Happy Birthday' and turns one of the ice-cream cones to reveal those same words written onto the frozen treat with colourful sparkles.<br/>
My cheeks flush as a wide grin spreads across my lips at the sight of the giant man giggling out of joy at his sweet surprise.<br/>
“Oh, it's your birthday?”<br/>
I turn back to the blonde boy standing next to me in Madam Malkin's dressshop, who up until now had only established that we will both be going to Hogwarts but hadn't said much else after that.<br/>
“Yeah, well...” I can hear my voice sounding nervous and my eyes avoid direct contact with the other boy's grey ones. I doubt I'll get used to people caring about my birthday any time soon.<br/>
“How about a celebratory butterbeer? My treat!” There is a pride in his expression that I cannot quite interpret as he says those last words, but I am still stuck on the ones before.<br/>
“What's butterbeer?”<br/>
And as he raises a brow in disbelieve I quickly add: “I'm new to the wizarding world”<br/>
His face falls.<br/>
“Oh....so you're muggle born?”<br/>
“That's what you call non-magic people, right? Well, my parents were wizards but I grew up in the...muggle world.” The word feels unfamiliar on my tongue as I try my best to make it sound normal.<br/>
There is a change in the boy's expression and for a moment I can see him closing himself off towards me before his eyes shift nervously towards the back of the shop. As I follow his gaze I notice a man walking along the dress robes, walking stick in hand and his long hair the same silver-blonde as the boy next to me. His father, I guess. I turn my attention back to my neighbour just a second before he, too, turns away from his dad to look at me. His mouth still forms a thin line of uncertainty but as he looks me up and down – shooting quick looks at the men in the back – his features soften until he finally meets my eyes and smiles.<br/>
“Then I'll just have to show you around.”<br/>
I smile back at him, trying not to think too much about what those moments of distance meant, just glad I didn't somehow mess up my first meeting with another wizard kid.<br/>
“Thanks,” I say and as an afterthought: “I'm Harry by the way”<br/>
He shakes my hand like an adult, his fingers strong around mine as he replies:<br/>
“Draco. Nice to meet you.”</p><p>*******</p><p>“Draco Malfoy”<br/>
I watch him walk up to McGonagall with a confidence in his step that I could only wish for, his eyes fixed on the great entrance door behind us as he takes a seat and waits for his sorting.<br/>
It only takes a few seconds. The hat barely touches his perfectly geled hair before announcing 'Slytherin'. There is a gasp from Ron next to me and even I can't help but be shocked as my eyes follow the first wizard boy I ever made friends with make his way to a table dressed in green tablecloths. But then he looks up after greeting his new classmates to search for my eyes and when he finds them, his own are so shy, so hopeful, that I ban any thoughts about Slytherin's bad reputation from my mind and smile at him instead, happy to see his shoulders relax even though his lips remain a tight line.<br/>
And then I suddenly feel all eyes in this gigantic hall on me as McGonagall lift the hat and says: “Harry Potter”.<br/>
Whispers start making the rounds along the students' tables and I even see some of the teachers leaning towards one another to comment on me as I try to focus all my attention on Hagrid who is waving at me in encouragement.<br/>
I feel the hat on my head and jump a little when a quiet voice fills the space between its fabric and my ruffled hair.<br/>
*“Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes – and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting...So where shall I put you?”*<br/>
Immediately, images of a blonde boy with mischievous, grey eyes fill my mind.<br/>
“Ah, I see,” the head's voice continues. “Well, Slytherin would certainly be an interesting choice for you. However, I am not sorting you to a person, I am sorting you to a house, and I dare say that you are better suited for Gryffindor!”<br/>
Cheers erupt from the table to my left as the hat announces this final decision.<br/>
I wait for the professor to lift the hat back up and then walk over to my assigned desk, my gaze wandering from Ron's double-thumbs-up to Draco's forced smile as I sit down.<br/>
Ron also gets sorted into Gryffindor and shortly after the silver plates are filled with well-smelling food out of thin air. The girl with the bushy hair – Hermione – and the boy whose toad she was trying to find on the train – Neville – sit next to us on one side while the other is occupied by Ron's older brothers Fred, George and Percy. We eat and eat for what feels like hours, the plates refilling long before they can ever be empty, and I laugh at the Weasley's stories with the other Gryffindors, our voices mixing with those of other first years, all of us filled with awe and excitement at our new home.<br/>
“This is the happiest I have ever been,” I think, as I grin at Ron who is rolling his eyes behind Hermione's back. </p><p>*******</p><p>“Harry!”<br/>
The fiest has ended, leaving the great hall in a mess of students who are all trying to get to their dorms as soon as possible. Us first years were told to follow our prefects – in our case Ron's brother Percy – but since none of the older students are willing to wait for the little ones to find their way around the castle, we are now just standing near the door behind Percy in order to let everyone else get through first.<br/>
I turn at the sound of my name and see him struggling to make his way through the sea of students, so I start to meet him halfway but Ron holds me back.<br/>
“What are you doing?” And with a sideglare at the head of shining blonde hair making its way over to us “Do you know that Slytherin?”<br/>
The way he spits the word makes me feel offended in Draco's name and I am about to scold my new friend about his prejudices but that is the moment another hand reaches for my arm and I see Draco standing next to me. He gives Ron a look similar to the one he just received himself and now it is him I want to get mad at but he looks at me with those soft, cold eyes and asks: “Can we talk?” before tugging on my arm to lead me away from the crowd. I give Ron a quick nod to make sure he understands that I'm okay with this, then I follow.<br/>
“What is it?”<br/>
The confidence he portrayed in front of the other Gryffindors is suddenly gone and he can barely hold eye contact as he starts to stutter:<br/>
“I just...I just wanted to know if you still....wanna be friends? You know...now”<br/>
His hands gesture towards his body and I realise that he's already wearing a green gown – where did he get that so quickly?<br/>
He then coughs and adds: “I mean, it's cool if you don't, I don't really mind.”<br/>
My eyes widen in disbelieve.<br/>
“What? Why would I not want to be friends any more?”<br/>
“Well, you know...” He looks at me pointedly as if his train of thought here is obvious.<br/>
“I'm a Slytherin now. And you're a Gryffindor.”<br/>
“So?”<br/>
“So. Don't all Gryffindors hate us?”<br/>
My mind wonders to Ron, replaying his words of warning, both on the train about Slytherins in general and just a minute ago about this one specifically. But Draco doesn't need to know that.<br/>
“Draco, I just learned that 'Slytherin' and 'Gryffindor' are even a thing like two hours ago. Why would something that still sounds like a made-up word to me effect our friendship?”<br/>
He doesn't look convinced so I do the only thing I can think of – I hug him.<br/>
And then I smile when, after a moment of hesitation, he hugs me back.</p>
