    <p>Hadrian Potter arrived at Platform Nine and Three Quarters with a snake around his neck and his fingers curled around a shrunken trunk. He wore a set of form fitting robes and polished dragon-hide boots that should have clacked against the concrete, but didn’t. He glided through the crowds on silent feet, piercing emerald eyes fixed ahead of him.</p><p> </p><p>The scorned Potter spawn had emerged.</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian got onto the train and strode to an empty carriage, head held high, before pulling the door shut behind him, blasting it with the strongest locking magic he knew, and collapsing onto the seat. Hogwarts was going to be a nightmare, he just knew it. 6 years’ apprenticeship with Gellert Grindelwald and the old bastard decided it would do him some good to be around young wixen his age.</p><p> </p><p>Not that they were of his caliber, of course. Hadrian was brilliant and he knew it. Also, he’d miss Grindelwald’s excellent cooking - especially treacle tarts. Mmm, treacle tarts. Just the thought made his mouth water. He’d have to make some when he got into his dorm room - dorm room, who puts Grindelwald’s apprentice in a dorm room?</p><p> </p><p>The door opened.</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian leaped to his feet, wand out. That door had been enchanted against unwanted intruders, it shouldn’t have let just anyone in!</p><p> </p><p>“Hello,” said the intruder. “You must be Lord Potter. I’m Tom Riddle, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian looked this Tom Riddle up and down. Now, his mouth was watering for an entirely different reason. “Hello, Riddle. The pleasure is mine.” His eyes lingered slightly on Riddle’s groin. “Now, will you tell me how you got into this compartment?”</p><p> </p><p>Riddle’s lip twitched. “I opened the door.”</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t just have opened the door!” Hadrian objected. “It was keyed to me. Anyone with capability to harm me - all sixth years and above - and I put an age line! You can’t have just opened the door and walked in!”</p><p> </p><p>Riddle had begun looking at him in a most peculiar way. “Hadrian.” he said, and for some reason Hadrian didn’t object to his use of his first name, “there are only two plausible explanations.”</p><p> </p><p>“That you somehow got through my magic? Yeah, right.”</p><p> </p><p>Riddle ignored that interjection. “One, that you inserted a part of your soul into my body, which, while theoretically possible has never been tested and would likely cause irreversible harm -”</p><p> </p><p>“Which I have not done,” said Hadrian.</p><p> </p><p>“Or that you are I are - well. Soulmates,” Riddle finished awkwardly.</p><p> </p><p>“Soulmates?”</p><p> </p><p>“Come on. What are you, a Mudblood?” the sneer suited the sharp-cheeked Slytherin more than the uncomfortable smile from before.</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian fought back a blush. “I’ve just - never heard that before.”</p><p> </p><p>Riddle’s eyes glinted as they roved over the other’s rose-dusted cheeks. “Oh, haven’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian crossed his arms petulantly. “You treat me like - an ordinary student!” he whined.</p><p> </p><p>“And that isn’t what you are?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not!” insisted Hadrian.</p><p> </p><p>Riddle stepped closer, towering over Hadrian. “I see,” he practically purred. Hadrian gulped, feeling the air hang heavy between them.</p><p> </p><p>All of a sudden Riddle’s hand was on his chin.</p><p> </p><p>Riddle’s hand was on his chin.</p><p> </p><p>Riddle’s hand was on his chin.</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian, Grindelwald’s apprentice, Lord of the Noble House of Potter, squeaked.</p><p> </p><p>Riddle pulled Hadrian’s face up. For such a sudden action it was awfully sudden, and Hadrian felt blood rushing to his face.</p><p> </p><p>Riddle blinked once, eyes going slightly hazy. “Hadrian,” he murmured, leaning even closer, and Hadrian swallowed thickly. </p><p> </p><p>“Please,” he whispered, and if he hadn’t been so quiet he was sure his voice would have been embarrassingly high pitched, “call me Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>“Harry, hmm?” said Riddle. “Interesting… then I suppose you must call me Tom.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry licked his lips, which were suddenly awfully dry. Then, that was probably because the taller boy - or where they men? - was breathing on them.</p><p> </p><p>“Say, Harry,” murmured Riddle - Tom, he was Tom - “you know there’s a saying… and you know what comes between Tom and Harry?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked into Tom’s silver eyes. “Huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Tom,” said Tom, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth, his plump, soft-looking mouth, “Tom, Dick, and Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry let out a yell. “Merlin, Tom! Must you?”</p><p> </p><p>The Slytherin peered down at him. “Do you feel it too?”</p><p> </p><p>And Harry did, so he reached up and claimed Tom’s lips for his own. Tom eagerly responded, his tongue making its way with surprising efficiency into Harry’s mouth and - </p><p> </p><p>Harry melted right there. “Tom,” he moaned. “How?”</p><p> </p><p>Tom’s left arm wound its way around Harry’s body as his right fumbled for his wand and shot a privacy spell at the door. “Testing a hypothesis,” he managed before Harry was on him again, hungry for more.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s hands pressed between them, reaching out for, then grasping, the buttons holding Tom’s robes together. He fiddled with them, plucking buttons out one by one, letting the fabric fall to the side, and Tom didn’t stop him. He just kept kissing the living daylights out of Harry. </p><p> </p><p>Harry slipped Tom’s outer robe off his shoulders. The crisp, starched fabric of the Slytherin’s shirt was smooth against his hands as they reached lower. </p><p> </p><p>“Harry,” Tom finally broke away, and as soon as he did Harry was kneeling and tugging on the zipper, “Harry are you sure -”</p><p> </p><p>Harry gave an experimental lick, and Tom shut right up. “Hush,” purred Harry. “I know what I’m doing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Often?” Tom asked, breathing hard and jerkily as Harry went in again. </p><p> </p><p>“I’d rather not talk about it,” said Harry coldly, and that - well, Tom was now as hard as Harry’s voice had been.</p><p> </p><p>Harry latched on, and his tongue circled Tom’s end. The taller gasped, leaning against the wall for support. If it couldn’t get any more intense, Harry opened his mouth wider and wrapped his lips around the length of Tom’s cock. </p><p> </p><p>The green-eyed boy brought his hands up, squeezing Tom’s balls, before he rocked forward and went back to rythmic strokes of the length.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry,” Tom was breathless.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked up and smiled. Then he stopped and pulled off, still looking up at Tom with a glint in his emerald eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“Shall we?” asked Tom, but it was unneccessary. Harry was already stripping.</p><p> </p><p>Tom reached out and pulled the shorter boy toward him, hands on each side of his head, trapping him against the wall. Harry felt himself flushing as Tom helped him with the last of his clothes, sliding his boxers down.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice arse,” said Tom, and Harry couldn’t stop the surprised laugh that bubbled up.</p><p> </p><p>Tom captured Harry’s mouth in a kiss, hot and heavy. His hands roamed the other, finding - “Ahh, yes,” said Tom, as Harry let out a pleasure-crazed hiss. Tom spun Harry around, his hands now over the shorter’s stomach, where a pool of what would be pleasure lay, and brought his right hand back down, finding what he was looking for. In response, Harry hissed again.</p><p> </p><p>Tom worked around Harry’s rim, pausing only to lick his finger to speed the process along. Harry’s arsehole opened right up like a morningflower at dawn. Tom inserted his cock, gasping as he felt the wet hole ready for him. All his work, of course, and that only carried him higher to euphoria. Oh, what he could do to the other’s body! He gave a few thrusts, soliciting a pleasured moan.  </p><p> </p><p>Harry whimpered in need, and that along was enough to push Tom over the edge. The sensation of warm fluid filling his hole overwhelmed Harry. He let out yet another moan as the pent-up tension released in a sudden burst. The two stumbled onto the compartment’s bench as a sex-powered haze overcame them. </p><p> </p><p>“Damn, Harry,” said Tom. “You’re good with that tongue.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed. “Mmhmm, and you, mmm.” He rested a hand on his stomach. “That was rough, and I wouldn’t have had it any other way.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom shifted to rest Harry’s head on his shoulder. “You’re warm,” he said.</p><p> </p><p>Harry turned to face him. “Maybe next time a little softer?” his eyes were pained. Tom’s cock, ever eager, gave an enthusiastic twitch at the undeniably sexy sight. He just smiled.</p><p> </p><p>The train soon ground to a halt. “Hogsmeade Station!” came the shouts. “Everybody off!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh Merlin,” muttered Tom, jumping up, knocking Harry to the ground. “We must’ve missed the warning to get dressed…”</p><p> </p><p>Harry was staring at him. “Ouch,” he said pointedly. </p><p> </p><p>Tom blinked. “Oh. Sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed. “After the amazing blowjob I gave you that’s all you can say? You shoved me into the floor!”</p><p> </p><p>“The Pureblood thing, that act you had earlier - that’s all it is, isn’t it? An act,” said Tom. Harry glared, but his eyes soon softened. “Yes. And I don’t - I don’t want to talk about it.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom slid back into his pants, then shoved his shirt over his head and pulled his robes on. Harry, sitting cross-legged on the bench, watched pensively. “You seem to know what you’re doing. Do you have sex often when you’re in a rush?”</p><p> </p><p>Tom choked. “You minx!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry shrugged and tugged his own boxers back on, giving his arse one last shake in Tom’s direction before pulling up his pants.</p><p> </p><p>Tom having spelled himself into looking neat as ever, Harry disheveled and with just-shagged hair, were some of the last few students out of the Hogwarts Express. Harry eyed the line of first-years going for what looked like boats and opted to go with Tom to the carriages. They, he was sure, would arrive faster, and had much lower odds of tipping him into a freezing Scotland lake.</p><p> </p><p>Tom was making a beeline for a particular carriage with a huddle of tall seventh-years. Harry strode behind him, and then, seeing the neatness of them all, muttered a few handy spells of ‘looking good in a duel’ Grindelwald had taught him to reinvent the smooth, elegant appearence he had had earlier in the day.</p><p> </p><p>“This is Lord Potter,” said Tom when they stepped into the carriage, then he offered Harry a hand. Harry took it, and the other seventh-years stared. Neither boy let anything on. Eventually, a pale-skinned blonde reached out a hand to shake. “Heir Abraxas Malfoy,” he introduced himself. “Lovely to make your acquaintence, Lord Potter.”</p><p> </p><p>“Likewise,” Harry murmured, shaking Malfoy’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>The others soon did the same. A pair of muscular boys were Heirs Crabbe and Goyle, a boy with dark hair and deep almond eyes was Heir Lestrange, a fair-skinned boy with hair almost as dark as Harry’s own was Heir Black. “My sisters and cousins will be delighted to meet you,” he told Harry excitedly. “I do believe we are related!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded. “Through Nigellus Phineas Black, yes. And your cousin is engaged to my cousin Charlus.”</p><p> </p><p>Heir Black nodded. “Ah, yes, the former Heir Primary Presumptive Potter.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry gave a wry grin. “That’s the one.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom sat down. Just as he did, the carriage began to move, quite abruptly. If Harry hadn’t seen the Thestrals’ ghostly forms he would have been as surprised as Heir Black, who yelped and fell on his behind.</p><p> </p><p>“Orion!” exclaimed a boy with Heir Black’s dark curls and porcelain skin. The boy to his left nodded solemnly.</p><p> </p><p>“You mustn’t embarrass the Ancient and Noble family, Orion.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Ignatius, you!” said Orion passionately as his bottom thudded along the floor. (Honestly, why that crackpot Dippet didn’t use a basic Smoothing Charm, Harry had no clue.) “You aren’t even a Black!”</p><p> </p><p>“I’d say that significantly lowers his chances ‘Cretia’ll say yes when he proposes,” sniggered another boy.</p><p> </p><p>“Montgomery!” groaned Heir Crabbe. The first looked unpurturbed. </p><p> </p><p>Harry’s lip curled. The Blacks had no small reputation of intermarrying, although in practice they kept their blood fresh enough to not reduce the magical potential of their offspring, although dominated with enough traditional traits that each Black was clearly recognizable. The pale skin, the dark curls, the refined chin, the combination was unmistakable.</p><p> </p><p>The notion of Lucretia Black marrying Ignatius Prewett was new, though. Harry had missed a lot during his winters in Austria. Grindelwald liked him to be focused on his studies, and not the ‘hocus-pocus those pretentious fools are up to.’</p><p> </p><p>“Come on,” said the Black who wasn’t Orion, “why focus on us when we’ve a Potter here?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah yes, a Potter. How many wives are you planning?” smirked Goyle.</p><p> </p><p>“Oi, you don’t know he swings that way,” Montgomery said, waggling his eyebrows. “His mother was a Rosier.”</p><p> </p><p>Goyle nodded sagely. “That may just override the Potter genes.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled, deciding to play along. “I have my mother’s eyes,” he said.</p><p> </p><p>Montgomery caught on first and grinned at Harry. “Quite the line you come from, then?”</p><p> </p><p>The Potter scion scoffed. “Don’t even think about it. I’m already promised.”</p><p> </p><p>The other boy’s eyes widened. “Really?”</p><p> </p><p>“No. Merlin, no! I just said that to see if you’d honestly fall for it.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom coughed lightly. “If you lovebirds hadn’t noticed, we’ve arrived.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, so we have!” exclaimed Orion, grasping his trunk and speeding out of the carriage at slightly over the acceptable speed for the Heir of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black. The other Black boy shook his head and sighed, but followed behind his future Lord. </p><p> </p><p>The others soon followed. Tom hung back with Harry, and together they joined the end of the herd of students heading towards the great oak doors. </p><p> </p><p>“So,” said Tom, “I think I’ve proved my hypothesis.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked at him and frowned. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>Tom’s lip quirked. “We’re not speaking aloud.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry stopped. “Wait, what!”</p><p> </p><p>Tom put his hand on the shorter’s arm. “Harry,” he said and this time Harry could tell his mouth wasn’t moving, “we’ve consummated the bond.”</p><p> </p><p>“Consummated what ‘bond?”</p><p> </p><p>“The soulmate bond. The one that enables us to do this.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry froze. “That’s a thing?” he breathed.</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” chuckled the tall Slytherin, “it would seem so. I’ll have to research it but we shouldn’t have any complications. Get sorted into Slytherin so I have access to you.”</p><p> </p><p>“What!” said Harry for the third time in as many minutes. “I’m not throwing my sorting just for you!”</p><p> </p><p>“What’s a sorting anyway,” muttered Tom, “doesn’t make you a real Slytherin.”</p><p> </p><p>“The fuck do you mean!”</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s just say I’ll be headed to Gringotts to pick up a consort ring for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry stared at him in silence, then whirled to face the castle and ran for it. He could feel eyes prickling against his back, and chose to ignore it. The bastard Slytherin could watch all he wanted, but if he thought one hookup a husband made, he was wrong. </p><p> </p><p>And Harry hadn’t exactly been lying to Montgomery, not exactly anyway, when he said he was already promised. Grindelwald strongly disapproved of the idea of his prized apprentice marrying. Said it would compromise his morals, as if that were a focal point for the Dark wizard.</p><p> </p><p>He stopped running when he reached the middle of the crowd, and marched with muscles clenched tight through the mud towards the oak doors of Hogwarts Castle. The castle was a stunning sight even from the midst of a crowd of mostly taller teenagers, with a brightly shining moon hanging over a turret and casting fascinating shadows across the entire building. It was breathtaking. Even the splash of a few first-years tipping their boat and plopping into the lake like frogs off a log couldn’t get him to tear his eyes away. It was good, he supposed, that Durmstrang had refused him on the grounds that he had a connection with Grindelwald, and Beaubatons only accepted French students. Rumours of the Dark wizard’s apprentice hadn’t reached Britain yet.</p><p> </p><p>Hogwarts barely lost any of its appeal when hundreds of teenagers trampled mud into its stone halls. A looping cleaning charm, fueled by the magic channels a place like this must have with so many wixen throughout the ages would not be very hard. At all. And yet, the castle let itself get filthy with bootprints. How degrading.</p><p> </p><p>The students entered what must be the Great Hall he’d heard whispers of, with its arching, enchanted ceiling and long tables. There was a dais, too. He headed there, head held high.</p><p> </p><p>He presented himself before the man he knew to be Headmaster Armando Dippet. “Lord Hadrian Potter,  sir,” he said. “A pleasure to make your acquaintance at last.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Potter!” Dippet seemed both delighted and unaware of the snub that was Harry not offering his hand to shake. “Welcome to Hogwarts! Now, if you don’t mind, we’ll sort you beore the First Years, then proceed with the feast as normal. You received the supply list that was sent when you enrolled, I trust? Jolly good!” he continued without waiting for a response. “I am glad. Well, off you pop to the side just there, and I’ll see you in a moment for your sorting!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded. “I do understand, sir. I’ll just be over there.” He strode to the side of the room the Headmaster had indicated, turning to face the dais.</p><p> </p><p>After all the other students were settled, and the First Years were an anxious clump on the other side of the Hall, Dippet stepped forward to a podium. “Good evening!” his voice boomed, magically amplified by a spell Harry hadn’t noticed. His reflexes were down - he hoped it wasn’t the sex. He’d hate to have to give that up for his battle ability.</p><p> </p><p>“Good to see you all! Yes, welcome, welcome! And a special welcome to our transfer student this year! I’m happy to introduce your new classmate, Seventh Year Hadrian Potter! Mr. Potter, please come up and be Sorted into your new House. Albus?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry glanced at Albus Dumbledore as he stepped forward. He recognized him from the atlatl targets Grindelwald used. The man looked older, and his fashion sense had got worse, but had the same auburn hair and long beard.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore held a tattered old hat, and, when Harry reached the middle of the dais, placed it on his head. </p><p> </p><p>Good grief, I did not need to see that! Exclaimed the hat almost immediately in Harry’s head. It seemed much more intrusive than Tom’s presence had been earlier. Young Riddle, then? Well! It’s not every day an old hat is surprised so.</p><p> </p><p>Get on with it, please.</p><p> </p><p>I see the glow’s worn off. Oh, very well then, if you insist. I see talent, yes, trained by Albus’ old fling. Didn’t know that? Ah, yes, quite a long story, no time for it now if there’s no time for a little entertainment. Courage, lots of it, quite enough to put you firmly in Gryffindor. And clever, a bit headstrong. Scratch that, very impulsive. I see. Not Hufflepuff, then, your ambition is all for you. Bloody hell, that Riddle’s enormous! You must have a good pain tolerance. That’d suit a Gryffindor well. You’d manage in Ravenclaw, but really there’s no point putting you there now, is there? Maybe six years ago, but people change. You’d get no benefit from it. It’s Gryffindor or Slytherin, and I’ve survived this long. I think if I just do this… an old hat does need something to think about! SLYTHERIN!</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s robes gained green trim, and his tie turned green and silver. He strode off the dais to the table with the serpent hanging over it, his own snake in his pocket, hissing slightly. He was going to take the nearest empty seat, but Orion Black was beckoning. He sighed and changed course. Orion scooted over. </p><p> </p><p>There was a clear hierarchy on the Slytherin table. At the center, like a spider crouching in the middle of its web, was Tom Riddle. He had surrounded himself with the spawn of influential families with features Harry sort of recognized. Montgomery from the carriage was there, Crabbe and Goyle lurked nearby, although they were excluded from the inner circle itself, his cousins Druella and Cassius Rosier steadfastly ignoring each other, a blonde boy, and a horde of Blacks, which included Orion, and, unfortunately by proxy, Harry.</p><p> </p><p>Smug-looking Slytherins with less well-known pedigrees were seated in the middle band. Future influential wixen from other Houses seemed to be included in this category, too. Ignatius Prewett, a Ravenclaw, and Harfang Longbottom, a Hufflepuff, were leaning forward to talk to a couple of the Black girls. Cygnus was allowing it, so Harry concluded this must be acceptable to the former Primary Heir Presumptive Black. Cygnus, like Harry’s own cousin Charlus, had never quite gotten over the birth of a more eligible heir. Unlike Charlus, Cygnus had used that resentment to drive his own ambition and pride in his family House.</p><p> </p><p>“Cousin Hadrian.”</p><p> </p><p>Speak of the devil. Harry turned to see his cousin looking down on him. Charlus was almost a whole year older, having been born in September the year before Harry. He forced his face to warp into a polite smile. “Cousin Charlus.” He held his chin up. To give even the slightest hint of a bow to Charlus before the older Potter bowed to him would undermine his entire being as Primary Heir Apparent. He couldn’t be displaced from his position but by his death - but his birth had knocked Charlus down in the order of succession. Charlus’ father had encouraged his son’s bitterness. Uncle Phineas Potter, who had always been destined to inherit nothing but a sum of money, a few fine houses, and the right to use the family name - nothing to scoff at, but for the Potters, a family descended from the great wizards of lore, it was barely a crumb off a princely table.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s seat at their particular princely table was the throne.</p><p> </p><p>Charlus finally caved and gave a sniff bob of his head. Harry’s own nod was three times as elegant just to spite the younger family branch, but his expression was cold when he looked back up. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s wonderful to finally see you pursuing your more academic… talents,” said Charlus.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure my presence will be a boon to those less academically inclined than I,” Harry smiled.</p><p> </p><p>Charlus blinked. “Certainly it will be, little cousin.”</p><p> </p><p>Almost in the blink of an eye, Druella Rosier appeared by Harry’s side. “Charlus!” she said with a bright smile, reaching out and setting her hand on his arm. “How lovely to see you again! Why, since the Vernal Gala I don’t think I’ve encountered you once! Goodness, how did it slip my mind? If you’ve any time later on, I would like to discuss certain matters with you concerning my young sister…”</p><p> </p><p>Charlus narrowed his eyes at Harry. “I’m a bit busy at the moment,” he bit out.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I completely understand!” simpered Druella. “I’ll catch you later, then? Goodbye!” She waved merrily, then turned to Harry. Her expression changed from the upbeat fool to something very, well, Druella. “Hadrian. You should have ignored him.” Then she walked off.</p><p> </p><p>Cassius sniggered. “Druella got to you?”</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian groaned. “Yup.” He popped the p.</p><p> </p><p>“Druella’s not one to beat around the bush,” conceded one of the girls in the clump of Blacks.</p><p> </p><p>“Walburga’s too nice to Druella,” said Cassius. Walburga, the Black girl, huffed. </p><p> </p><p>“She needs some kindness in her life.”</p><p> </p><p>Students were beginning to stand up and leave in groups. Hadrian made a move to do the same, but Tom stopped him with a look. “What?” he demanded.</p><p> </p><p>“Slytherins leave together,” Orion explained. “We all come down to breakfast together, we all go to the dorms together.”</p><p> </p><p>Ah yes. The dorms. Hadrian did not want to sleep in a dorm. He looked around the table, wondering who he would end up with. There was the clump of Blacks, Crabbe and Goyle, Montgomery Lestrange, Cassius Rosier… and of course Tom Riddle.</p><p> </p><p>“All right,” said Tom, and stood up. The rest of the Slytherins rose as well. First Tom began walking toward the exit Harry presumed to be the one leading to the Slytherin common room and dorms, then the blonde boy and Cygnus Black followed him. Then Walburga Black and Druella Rosier - their hands brushing together, Druella’s fingers fluttering towards Walburga’s, which remained stubbornly still. But Walburga didn’t move her hand. By then, the rest of the table had converged into a mass, and certain people moved to the outside. Older students surrounded the younger First Years, Second Years, and Third Years, with Sixth and Seventh Years all around the edge of the snakelike procession, giving the distinct impression that they were all older. Harry joined the outer edge.</p><p> </p><p>Portraits called out and waved, many, to their descendants. “You’re back!” called out Phineas Nigellus Black, former Headmaster. “Cygnus, Lucretia, Walburga, Cassiopeia, Orion! And is that Arcturus’ daughter I see? Ah, not you, Lucretia, darling, but - yes, it is! Young Cedrella! And you brought your sister, too! Callidora! Is this your first year?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, Great Uncle, this is my second year of Hogwarts,” said one of the younger Blacks. “Honestly!”</p><p> </p><p>“It seems just yesterday my lovely nephew Arcturus and his charming wife brought you to my portrait all wrapped up like a pie in pastry! How you’ve grown.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah I have grown, and I’ll thank you to remember it!”</p><p> </p><p>Phineas Nigellus scanned the group again. “Lucretia, you do look put out. How’s the little girl, hm? Meissa? Still crawling?”</p><p> </p><p>“For Merlin’s sage, Great-Great Grandfather, she’s six!”</p><p> </p><p>“And how is Ignatius?”</p><p> </p><p>At hearing that, Montgomery Lestrange whistled. “Ooh la la, been telling Great-Great Grandfather all about what goes on between the sheets, are we, ‘Cretia?”</p><p> </p><p>Lucretia flushed. “Nothing is going on in the bedroom between Ignatius and I, if that’s what you mean, Montgomery! And why thank you, Great-Great Grandfather, for asking. He is doing perfectly well.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am glad, I am glad! You be sure to bring one of my portraits to the ceremony now, hm? And I’ll want to see the future Heir Presumptive.” Here he looked at Orion. “How goes your gallant quest for a girlfriend?”</p><p> </p><p>It was Orion’s turn to blush beetroot-red. “Oh, stopit! I haven’t got a girlfriend or a boyfriend, not that I’d want one but it would be okay if I did!”</p><p> </p><p>Phineas Nigellus just looked amused. This time, he let the procession of Slytherins move onwards. </p><p> </p><p>“That was my Great-Great Grandfather.” said Orion. “He’s a bit nosy.”</p><p> </p><p>“I heard that!” came a call.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry!” yelled Orion over his shoulder, then whispered to Harry, “not sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>The group shuffled through the doors into a vast chamber, with black leather sofas and armchairs, a cozily cracklng fire, and a collection of fine green rugs. There were paintings on the walls, and a mantlepiece above the fireplace with the image of a serpent’s head. The whole room was doused in cool green light, and when he looked to find the source he found it was because the ceiling slanted, and one of those slants was an enourmous window that encompassed most of the wall it was connected to. The veiw was of the Great Lake. A few merfolk waited near the edge, and waved to greet their human friends. They seemed to be signing to specific people.</p><p> </p><p>Tom was gathering First Years to the fireplace, where he stood with Abraxas Malfoy and Cygnus Black flanking him. “Welcome to Slytherin,” he said. “House of the cunning and ambitious. House of leaders and innovators. People who are not afraid to escape the bounds of common sense with logic. People to whom ‘should’ can always be replaced by ‘could.’ People who will mould our future with their bare hands. Slytherin House? We are the future.”</p><p> </p><p>Abraxas nodded. “We are the future!” he repeated, and Cygnus led the audience in another repetition.</p><p> </p><p>“We are the future! We are the future!”</p><p> </p><p>“Slytherin!”</p><p> </p><p>Tom smiled, letting the chant die down. “Welcome to Slytherin House. Now, Professor Slughorn, our Head of House.”</p><p> </p><p>Slughorn slung his arm around Tom’s shoulders. “Thank you, Tom! Now, if I could have your attention please? Ah, yes. In Slytherin House we don’t have curfews like other Houses do. We like to leave that responsibility on your shoulders, in the hopes that you will begin to master it and use it to improve yourself. You are not here to be coddled. You are here to learn, as comfortable  as learning may be, if you wish to excel, you will have to try. Those who excel will be rewarded. You will come to learn that I am a great believer in rewarding the worthy. Now I leave you to your own devices - sensible, please, but if you aren’t I am not one to notice.”</p><p> </p><p>The First Years looked quite relieved at that.</p><p> </p><p>When Slughorn left, Tom approached Harry. “Let me help you settle in,” he said, and Harry nodded. </p><p> </p><p>“Appreciate it.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom led Harry up several curving flights of stairs. Harry stared. “Some expanding charms they’ve got,” he commented, and Tom nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. About what I mentioned earlier, I’m going to be looking into it, so if - would you like to know what I find out?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry stopped him. “Yes! It concerns me just as much as you. I do want to know.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom nodded again. “Okay, I can do that. As soon as I have something substantial, I’ll let you know. In private. This isn’t something we want everyone and their third-cousin twice removed knowing.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry chuckled. “Not into expeditionism?”</p><p> </p><p>Tom shook his head. “Me? No. I - just so you know I’m normally more restrained than that! I don’t just jump people. I don’t. That’s one of the things I want to find out, actually.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed. “Me either. It was weird, like I wasn’t entirely all there? Or, I think… I was, but there was something else there, too.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom blinked. “Odd. I felt the same way. That ought to be in my notes.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded. “Let us proceed?”</p><p> </p><p>Tom kept walking up another flight of stairs, stopping at the second door in. “Here we are! Your new dorm.”</p><p> </p><p>The shorter boy inspected the door. It had a carved plaque: </p><p> </p><p>Slytherin 7th years</p><p> </p><p>Montgomery Lestrange</p><p>Abraxas Malfoy</p><p>Archibald Yaxley</p><p>Tom Riddle</p><p>Balthazar Crouch</p><p>Cygnus Black</p><p>Hadrian Potter</p><p> </p><p>“Clever. It knows me.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom nodded. “The castle’s magic.”</p><p> </p><p>When he went in, his trunk was by the side of the bed second-closest to the window. “The one next to mine,” Tom commented. Harry started unpacking. He had two pairs of pants, two shirts, and two sets of robes, his dragonhide boots, and an expandable pouch full of books. </p><p> </p><p>“Hogwarts Castle may claim to have a good library, and perhaps they do,” Grindelwald had said, “but they certainly won’t allow you access to it. Better take your own.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom’s eyes widened. Harry followed his gaze to the expensive expandable pouch. “Oh. That? Don’t they have these in Britain?”</p><p> </p><p>Tom licked his lips. “I imagine they do. I just… could never afford things like that until I reached my majority last year.” </p><p> </p><p>Harry swallowed. “Oh. I’m sorry, I hadn’t realized you weren’t… treated like a pureblood heir. I suppose I should have realized you aren’t.”</p><p> </p><p>The words had barely left his mouth when Tom had him pinned against the wall, fists clenched around his wrists. “How dare you!” raged the taller Slytherin. “How dare you say I am not an heir? Not an heir of anything!”</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you weren’t!”</p><p> </p><p>“I am, Harry, I’m just as much an heir of a noble family as you! I am Slytherin’s heir, Harry - Salazar fucking Slytherin! I am Lord Slytherin: I, Tom Riddle, I, the notorious Slytherin mudblood I am not a mudblood! I am Slytherin’s flesh and blood, borne of magic, raised by myself, I am Slytherin’s own you will not question it.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s world went black with a hollow thud.</p>
