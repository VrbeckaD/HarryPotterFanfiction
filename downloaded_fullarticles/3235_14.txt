    <p>Regulus wakes, which is the first surprise of the morning. The last thing he remembers was the water of the lake, and hands reaching-grasping-burning -</p>
<p>He gasps, takes a breath. In. Out.</p>
<p>He's still breathing. Morgana’s saggy left tit, he’s still breathing, and isn’t that the biggest surprise of all?</p>
<p>He sits up slowly, hoping against hope that this isn't the afterlife, that Kreacher perhaps came back for him, rescued him, but his hope fades as he looks around his room. It's virtually empty in comparison to how he remembered it, no newspaper clippings on the wall, or anything from his time in Hogwarts, actually. No, he realises as he swings his legs over the side of the bed.</p>
<p>There isn't a single thing here from before he was eleven. With dawning horror, he looks down at himself. Skinny arms and legs meet his gaze, much too skinny. He lurches to his feet, panicked, and realises he's at least a good foot shorter than he remembers being yesterday. He wants to cry when he sees both of his forearms, still pale and unmarked.</p>
<p>Merlin above, he's hallucinating, he must be. He feels his stomach twist violently, and throws himself towards the bathroom just in time, skidding on his knees until he hits the cool porcelain of the toilet, unceremoniously emptying his stomach into it. He leans his head against the bowl and reminds himself to breathe. It's a terrible, terrible privilege now he knows how easy it is to stop breathing, knows what it's like to thrash towards a surface you can never reach - He's too busy reacquainting himself with the contents of his stomach to notice Sirius easing his door open.</p>
<p>His dear, idiotic, lion of a brother, who pulls his hair out of his face and runs a hand down his back that Regulus cannot help but arch up into. He thought he'd never see his brother again, had thought that it would be worth it if he knew Sirius would have been proud of him -</p>
<p>Belatedly, he realises that he's crying, and Sirius has pressed him to his chest, murmuring nonsense in the way sixteen-year-old him would never do, but Sirius is thirteen. Sirius still loves him. Sirius does not know what he has done, would have done, and a very Slytherin part of Regulus is glad, because Sirius would never so much as look him in the eye, let alone hug him again.</p>
<p>"Hey," his brother rumbles after Regulus has managed somewhat to get his breathing under control again. "Hey, Reggie, there you are. You're alright. We’re alright.”</p>
<p>Regulus just holds his brother a little tighter because by the end of the day, he will be back to being the Dutiful Heir and Sirius the Family Disgrace, their two roles defined ever since Sirius first donned the red and gold.</p>
<p>Regulus knows that Sirius keeps a worried eye on him all through the morning, right up until they were about to get on the train, and the other three idiot lions came charging up to him. He smiled at his brother, trying to convey a confidence he didn't possess.</p>
<p>"Go on," he snorts, and shoves him a little, almost wrinkling his nose in disgust at the weakness of his thin arms. "I can find a compartment myself, I'm not completely incapable."</p>
<p>Sirius looks him in the eyes like he can see into his very soul, and Regulus resists the urge to shiver. "Reggie -" he starts, looking more than a little uncomfortable, eyes darting away. "Just - you'll always be my brother, okay?"</p>
<p>He's gone before Regulus can even think of something to say, ruffling Potter's hair and dodging the resounding tackle with a baying laugh.</p>
<p>Regulus smiles a little to himself, and boards the train alone.</p>
<p>The time he spends on the train is spent strategizing and catching a nap. He quickly regrets the second thing, because he wakes up gasping for air again, like his body had forgotten that it was supposed to be living as soon as he closed his eyes. He’d been expecting trouble with nightmares, had anticipated and planned, but nothing could prepare him for this, for closing his eyes and not knowing whether he would be allowed to open them again, if he was simply going to fade between one hour and the next. It’s the fear that gets to him the most, that leads him to cast the strongest Lumos he can muster and try to forget how green light looks dancing against the walls of a cave, desperately trying to black out what water sounds like when it rasps hungrily against the shore because the Slytherin common room has all of these dangers, and worse, it has the people that he has stood both beside and against. He will have to remember how to live unnoticed by them too, except he cannot, will not perhaps be able to pretend to love the Dark Lord like he did back then, because he will not be able to look at the green and silver trim of their robes again without thinking of death.</p>
<p>It is so easy to die, and that terrifies him, because he knows exactly how much water you must take into your lungs, exactly how many panicked breaths it takes to succumb, and he calculates this effortlessly as they cross the Black Lake. He has always been praised for his stellar memory, for his intelligence, and he wants desperately to turn to Rosier and tell him that there is no peace in death, that it is messy and painful right to the very end, terrifying to the last breath, and he has faced it willingly. He has faced down death itself and come out the other side, and it is this that gives him the strength to stand from the boat and cross to the front hall, to turn his back to the siren song of the waves of the lake.</p>
<p>Regulus thinks, as they line up, that perhaps he will always hear the sea in between each breath, shall forever be haunted by drifting hair and reaching, grasping hands just underneath the surface, will always remember that he is nothing more than a dead man walking, even without the Mark burned across his forearm like he was nothing more than chattel. He wasn’t even that, he knows that now, had ranked somewhere just above the latest Muggle corpse that needed to be disposed of, and just below the latest Magical corpse that needed to be displayed to show nobody crossed the Dark Lord and lived. If he is to do it all again, he is already damned as he was at eighteen, terrified at a world that had fallen apart underneath his feet.</p>
<p>He barely registers the Hall with it’s ceiling showcasing stars that look somewhat like fireflies against dark crags of a vaulted tomb. He doesn’t hear the murmurings of the student body, sounding like liquid lapping quietly against porous stone, and tells himself he is imagining the steady dripping noise that sounds from somewhere off to his left.</p>
<p>He gets his second attack of nerves when "Black, Regulus!" is called, but there's nowhere for him to hide and have a gasping crying fit like he did earlier, so he hides all his discomfort and fear beneath the Pureblood mask that was beat into him from an early age, and lets the Hat be settled onto his head.</p>
<p><em>Oh,</em> says the Hat, first of all. <em>Oh, my dear boy.</em></p>
<p><em>You have to sort me back there,</em> Regulus thinks, despite how it makes his hands shake<em>. I can be useful. I could be a spy, I'll be <strong>needed</strong> there. There is a <strong>war</strong> coming.</em></p>
<p>(What he doesn't see is that with every second that ticks by with silence from the hat, the Slytherin table gets a little tenser and on the opposite side of the hall, Sirius Black grasps his friends' hands a little tighter and hopes a little harder.)</p>
<p>The Hat hums in disapproval in his head. <em>Bright. You’ve a clever mind too, very clever. You're a strategist to the bone, you know. I wasn't wrong the first time, Ravenclaw would suit you well. A great mind like this should not be wasted again.</em></p>
<p>Regulus thinks about it, how his life would be so much easier, and dismisses it in the same thought. He is a Black. He was built to take pain, and suffering, and madness. He was built to do his duty.</p>
<p><em>I can't go there,</em> he tells the Hat, and only feels a faint flickering of regret that he hopes it cannot see. <em>I have to do my duty, no matter how much it might scare me. I <strong>must</strong> go to Slytherin. I <strong>must</strong> destroy his Horcrux.</em></p>
<p><em> You have already died in the name of duty, boy, and you would be willing to do it again?</em> the Hat asks, something unreadable in its tone.<em> You are a child, not a soldier.</em></p>
<p>Regulus shrugs as best as he can at it.<em> We will all be soldiers soon. And, even if nobody ever discovered that I stole the Horcrux, I would steal it again, a hundred times over. It'd be worth it, to know I defied him.</em></p>
<p><em>Very well,</em> the Hat replies, tone smug,<em> Self-sacrificing, along with good dash of bravery - born from fear, true, but that is where bravery is nearly always born, boy, don't let them tell you any different, and no one could contest that you stand up for what you believe in -</em> and Regulus has only a fraction of a second to feel suspicion and desperately thinks<em> Don't you dare!</em> before the Hat bellows,</p>
<p>"Better be <strong><em>Gryffindor!</em></strong>"</p>
<p>The Hat, damn the wretched thing, is removed from his head, and it's shout is ringing in Regulus's head as he takes one trembling step, two, towards the lion's table, away from the green and silver he used to take so much pride in.There's a stunned silence, as it sinks in that not one, but two Black boys have bucked the family trend, and then Sirius, his dear Sirius, stands up, and begins to whoop and clap and cheer, which is followed by his idiotic friends, which is followed by others until Regulus is being welcomed to the table by slaps on the back and laughter and so much joy he can barely think, can barely breathe.</p>
<p>Across the table, Sirius grins, drags him in for a hug, ignoring McGonagall's requests for them to <em>quieten down this instance unless Gryffindor House wanted to start the year on negative points.</em> He allows himself to smile back, curve his hands around his brother, and hold on, losing his Pureblood mask for the precious seconds his face was hidden from the world.</p>
<p>His robes now bear the red and gold he used to hate, and he can't even bring himself to care as he tells his brother, "Well, I was named for a lion, wasn't I? It's about time I started acting like one!" and Sirius ruffles his hair delightedly.</p>
<p>Later will be the arguments and the shouts and the recriminations, but for now, Regulus lets himself have this one joy, rolls his sleeves up to his elbows. He can practically taste freedom on his lips, here in the lion’s den, and he thinks to himself as he tucks into roast potatoes and a slab of beef that lies intimidatingly large on his plate, that maybe, maybe, this is what falling in love with life is – a brother framed by warm torchlight, and a whole life suddenly unfurling in front of you where before there was only a lake and a cave. (and a tomb)</p>
