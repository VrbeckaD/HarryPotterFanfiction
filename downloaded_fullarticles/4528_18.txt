          <div class="userstuff"><p>I gave up.</p>
<p>I was lost on the sixth floor.  I was going to be late to my first Transfiguration class.  Looking around, I tried to find someone to help me find my bearings.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," I said, walking up to a ghostly figure.  "Could you help me find my way to the Transfiguration classroom?  I'm lost."</p>
<p>The portly figure looked down at me, floating down to my level.  He gave me a wide grin.</p>
<p>"Oh, of course," he exclaimed.  "I can help you find your way!  Go down that hallway and down two levels.  It'll be behind the door on your right.  Good luck!"</p>
<p>He sped away, giggling.</p>
<p>I shook my head.  What an odd ghost.  Following his instructions, I ended up at a large door.</p>
<p>I pulled at it.  It was locked, so I knocked.  The sound echoed off the walls of the corridor.</p>
<p>"Excuse me!" I shouted.</p>
<p>I waited for a couple of moments, then continued pulling at the door in vain.  Suddenly, someone grabbed my arm, yanking me backwards.</p>
<p>"What," spat the man, "do you think you're doing?"</p>
<p>With my free hand, I tried to wipe my face.<br/>"G-going t-to Transfiguration, sir," I said.</p>
<p>"A <i>likely</i> story," he said sarcatically.  "Don't you know this hallway is forbidden?"</p>
<p>I frowned.</p>
<p>"No!" I exclaimed.  "Where does it say it's forbidden?"</p>
<p>"Bah, weren't you listening at the opening feast?  The third floor corridor is forbidden!"</p>
<p>"But this is the fourth floor," I argued.  "The third floor is dowâ€“ British."</p>
<p>"Ah," said the man in realization.  "So you're the American."  He grumbled, "Knew your kind can't be trusted.  <i>Bloody colonials.</i>"</p>
<p>"What do you mean, <i>can't be trusted</i>?  You're the ones who put the first floor on the second floor!"</p></div>
