    <p>“This is a very precise potion. One common mistake is stirring the potion all the way around for the last stir. You only stir two-thirds of the way. Otherwise, contact with the potion can transform the witch, wizard, or other into an animal of some kind. It doesn’t last terribly long, however I’m sure none of you would want the experience. Now everyone-” Professor Slughorn was interrupted by the door bursting opening, revealing a dishevelled Harry Potter. Everyone turned to him as he bounced on his two feet and scratched the back of his neck. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Er, sorry Professor,” Harry said. His cheeks were tinged slightly pink. Slughorn appeared to be having trouble keeping himself from rolling his eyes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mr. Potter, please have a seat,” Slughorn said shortly. “We need partners today, not trios,” he added pointedly as Harry made to sit with Ron and Hermione. Looking around, Harry spotted one person sitting alone - Malfoy. Begrudgingly, Harry took the empty seat besides him. Malfoy had already set up his cauldron. As Slughorn droned on, Harry was only half-listening. He was busy watching Malfoy take immaculate note with his tiny script. They had a strange relationship. Mostly, they ignored each other. When necessary they could share a few polite words. Ever since Harry returned Malfoy’s wand, they were at least civil. No hexes, insults, or sneers anymore. It wasn’t exactly what Harry wanted - to be friends, or possibly more - but it would have to do. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry tuned back in to hear Slughorn tell the class to gather the ingredients. Looking to Malfoy, he could tell the blonde was expecting him to do so. With a heavy sigh, Harry stood and collected the ingredients from the cupboard. Then, Malfoy set to work. They had a silent agreement over the process. Since they both knew Harry was abysmal at potions, Malfoy would be in charge of the more difficult tasks like the timing, order, and precision of the ingredients. That left Harry with the mediocre tasks such as cutting the ingredients and stirring the potion. All with precise instructions from Malfoy, of course. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the potion was almost complete, Malfoy lowered the heat and instructed, “Now you need to turn it once, clockwise, but-” He was cut off by a seventh year shrieking over her spilled potion. As Slughorn went to clear up the mess, Harry stirred the potion once all the way through. Malfoy looked back down at the final product, looking proud. It was the exact shade of green that the book, and Slughorn, said it should be. Harry studied Malfoy. He had never seen the other boy like this. Admittedly, he knew Malfoy was deeply invested in his studies since second year. Seeing him like this reminded him of Hermione whenever she accomplished a difficult spell. It made him look more human somehow. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“As you finish your potions, grab a vial from my desk to store them. As long as I okay them, you’ll be able to use them as you please in the future. Just be sure not to drink more than the appropriate amount,” Slughorn told the class. Without being asked, Harry went to grab a vial. When he returned, Malfoy told him that Slughorn gave them the go-ahead, so Harry began to pour the potion in. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was almost finished pouring the potion when a few drops spilled onto his hand. Before he could so much as curse, he was shrinking. Within seconds Harry was gone and replaced by a minuscule kitten. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco’s wide eyes flicked from the kitten to the shocked faces around the room. In the back of his mind, he knew he was about to be blamed for turning the precious chosen one into an unthreatening feline. Thankfully, Slughorn didn’t seem to praise Potter as much as he used to. After the article about how he withheld information that could’ve helped to defeat the Dark Lord was released, he was rather cross with Potter. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once Slughorn realized what happened, he shuffled over to their area. As he made his way over, he shushed the other students, telling them to continue their work. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Draco was waiting, he watched the cat as it came up to his foot and nudged it with its head. Draco had to resist the urge to flinch away from it. It was only Potter, he reminded himself. Not some feral monster. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Slughorn arrived by his side, he said, “I thought I reminded everyone to turn it two-thirds of the way.” Draco gulped and thought back to the potion. Closing his eyes, he groaned in frustration. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Potter stirred it. He wasn’t here when you told us not to,” Draco replied. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And why didn’t <em>you</em> tell him?” Slughorn shot back. Draco visibly deflated. No matter what he said, this wasn’t going to end well for him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What can I do to change him back?” Draco asked determinedly. If he couldn’t go back to stop this from ever happening, he was going to do the next best thing - fix it. However, Slughorn only gave him a pitying look. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“There’s nothing to do, I’m afraid. You’ll be in charge of taking care of him,” he said shortly and walked away. Draco stared unbelieving at his back as he strode off. He felt another push against his leg and looked down once more. Familiar green eyes stared back at him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before anyone would notice, Draco packed away all of his and Potter’s things and left, carrying the small creature. Soon, he was in the safety of his dorm. Luckily, the so-called “eighth years” didn’t need to share dorms with anyone. Since there was so few of them, they each got their own individual room. It certainly was an upgrade to the slytherin dorms. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gingerly, he set the kitten - Potter - onto his four-poster. It - he - seemed to examine the room. Draco wondered if Potter could still think the same way he could as a human. It was probable that he, like an animagus, could still think the same way, but afterwards would have distorted memories of the whole affair. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Deep in his thoughts, he didn’t realize that the kitten had crept up to the edge of the bed. He was broken out of his reverie when he felt it lick him. Glancing down, he was that Potter was studying him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Bugger, you’re cute even as a kitten,” Draco cursed. Potter meowed back, making Draco hope Potter can’t understand him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco yawned. He had a late night last night. Every night of September thirtieth, they stayed awake until midnight. It had become tradition after they realized that both of them had the same favorite holiday: Halloween. October first was always a day to celebrate to them. Potter ruined that for him this year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a brief moment of hesitation, Draco began to change. Potter’s gaze remained steady, making Draco slightly nervous. Who knew the first time Draco would be undressing in front of a guy that it would be Potter in kitten form?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once he was in more comfortable clothing, Draco laid on his bed. Instantaneously, Potter snuggled next to his chest. <em>It wasn’t terrible to lay next to Potter</em>, Draco admitted before falling asleep. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Harry woke, the first he noticed was that his neck was sore. He repositioned himself, intent on falling back asleep. The bed was so comfortable. Then he realized with a jolt that his bed wasn’t comfortable. He had been complaining about his lumpy mattress to Ron and Hermione all year. Moving his body slightly to observe his surroundings, he realized the bed wasn’t the only thing that was different. There was an arm wrapped around his middle and what he assumed was a back pushed against his back. That’s when the memories came flooding back. He had been pouring the potion and then he was looking upwards at everyone. Slughorn had said something about taking care of him and then he was being carried away. The next thing he knows, he was sitting on a bed, staring at Malfoy. Malfoy had said something. After a moment of deep thought, he salvaged the information. Malfoy had said that Harry was cute!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry pushed back to move closer to Malfoy. Instantly, he felt the body behind him freeze.  “‘S okay, go back to sleep,” Harry murmured, already pushing down into his pillow once more. Malfoy went to remove his arm, but Harry grabbed it to stop him. “Sleep,” he repeated. Finally, Malfoy relaxed against Harry once more. They both let out content sighs before falling back asleep. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was the best sleep they both had in a long time.</p>
