    <p>Credence has overslept again, and this is becoming quite a habit. </p><p>He hasn’t slept in enough to make himself late for work, it’s not that bad. At least, not yet. But he had wanted to stay right where he was, safe and warm under the covers, wrapped up deep in dreams. If he could have had his way, he would’ve snoozed the alarm well into the afternoon. </p><p>Instead, he’s riding the subway to the coffee shop he’s been employed with for nearly 3 months now, the very last train that will get him there on time, in fact. It’s standing room only at this time of day, and he’s holding on to the railing with one hand and yawning into the other despite what should have been more than enough sleep. But it’s like his body knows where it should really be, like no part of him wants to leave his dreams for any amount of time, if it can be helped.</p><p>And it’s all because he keeps dreaming of that <i>man</i>… the one he’s only ever seen while he sleeps: dark, glittering eyes full of warmth and mirth, salt and pepper hair Credence can almost smell even now on the crowded train--which is odd, since he’s not sure he’s ever smelled something in a <i>dream</i> before. Something masculine and subtle, a touch of spice to it. The brush of faint stubble against Credence’s skin as he nuzzles in for another kiss, whispering something soft that he can’t quite remember now.</p><p>Credence jerks his head up and looks around at the other passengers, feeling almost caught at something and realising at the same time that he may have just drifted off into genuine sleep again, standing right on his feet. He should be alarmed, but he can’t muster it. This definitely isn’t normal, but if it were to stop any time soon, he couldn’t quite imagine anything worse than that. But dwelling on the dreams isn’t the best idea now, not here, where such thoughts might lead him into an embarrassing state he’s in no position to hide while standing pressed between strangers on a crowded subway train.</p><p>He gets to the shop, and it’s just as packed and busy as his commute had been. Immediately he regrets the idea that having to absorb himself in his work will cut into his freedom to just linger over his dreams from the night before. Again, he should see this as a problem, something abnormal he should try to curb right away, but he can’t ever think of time spent with that nameless man--even if it isn’t real--as something bad. It couldn’t be any further opposite, it’s the best part of his life, easily, even if it happens when he’s not even conscious. He doesn’t know if this is escapism, or some delayed reaction to everything he went through before finally getting away from home. Either way, he doesn’t care, because it’s the safest and most cared for he’s ever felt.</p><p>Tina is frowning at him as he struggles to tie the knot of his green apron at the small of his back, and after a moment she <i>tsks</i> softly and turns him around to do it herself. Credence feels a quick touch of guilt at just having thought how much a stranger in a dream makes him feel cared for, when he knows how Tina and her sister have looked after him these past months. Yet somehow, it’s an altogether different kind of caring, something warm and platonic and entirely <i>sisterly</i>. The man in the dreams: <i>he</i> makes Credence feel absolutely <i>seen</i>. Seen and found not even a single hair lacking. <i>Adored</i>.</p><p>In comparison, Tina’s affection is just on the friendly side of brusque. “Have you been sleeping okay?” she asks him, scrutinising the shadows underneath his eyes. “Not nightmares again?” </p><p>Credence thinks right away of the sound of water softly lapping, the giddy swoop in his belly at the swipe of a tongue over his lips, seeking entrance. They’d been on a boat, or maybe close to the beach… something he can’t quite catch again now in the bustling insistence of the day. He blushes. “No, no… not nightmares. Just…. sort of sleeping too much, almost. Maybe.”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The coffee Percival Graves frowns at hasn’t really done anything untoward. It’s simply the wrong taste. It’s too strong, which means it’s in danger of overpowering the taste he’s convinced he still has on his tongue: the taste of plump lips parting ever so slightly, the innocent offering sweeter than the most delicious dessert. They were flushed with colour, too, reminding him of strawberry parfait.</p><p>He opens a line to his P.A. “Newt, when you go down to the cafeteria, get me something sweet.”</p><p>“Okay, Mr Graves?” Newt sounds surprised, which is no wonder, as his boss is not known to ask for sweets mid-morning.</p><p>“Something… strawberry. Raspberry will do, in a pinch. Thanks.” He closes the line and pushes away the coffee, then taps his fingers on his desk while contemplating his inbox.</p><p>How is he expected to concentrate, when there’s nothing more appealing right now than to head home, climb back into bed, and get back to what he was doing there last--kissing the most delicious lips in the most perfect face he’s ever seen. Or rather, <i>never</i> seen.</p><p>Not in the waking world, at least, which is where he’s currently trying to function. Something which is becoming more and more difficult when the most ludicrous things somehow remind him of one of those dreams he’s been having lately.</p><p>If he was prone to blushing, he would be now, just remembering the baffled look the cab driver had given him when he’d simply stayed seated, probably smiling like a fool because the stops and starts on the drive had reminded him of the motion of the sea against the raft they’d been on. Just he and the boy of his dreams, gently cradled and nudged by turns, on ocean waves, as they drifted towards the beach on tied together bamboo trunks.</p><p>“I can’t drive you up the outside of the building, mister.” The cab driver, clearly out of patience, had nonetheless been tipped generously for unwittingly extending the thrall of the dream.</p><p>Graves finds himself trying to recall how they’d ended up on that raft, heading for what had, no doubt, been a desert island. Once upon a time, in his more cynical days, he might have rolled his eyes at the conveniently romantic setting conjured up by his subconscious. Those cynical days are well and truly over, and had been since the dreams had first begun.</p><p>He gives up on his mail, sighs, and stands up, absently straightening out his suit on the way to the large window looking out over Manhattan. He has the best office, and the best view, in the company. Possibly the best in the building. A sizable part of New York City lies stretched out 32 floors beneath his feet. Yet neither the cityscape, nor the fine leather and marble interior behind him, hold any appeal to him now.</p><p>He’d trade in his office for the next five minutes of that dream, and his whole job for one glimpse of that delightful young man during his waking hours. But that’s the trouble--he’s just a dream… a beautiful, enticing, perfect dream, obviously too good to be true.  </p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Credence is sitting in the break room, breathing in the steam of his macchiato as though the smell alone might wake him up. If only he really <i>were</i> asleep, back in the arms of the mystery man who has already become an obsession. If he were an artist, Credence would probably have tried to draw or paint him by now, even knowing there was no way he could render him as handsome as he always was in dreams. He sighs, closing his eyes just for the briefest moment before Queenie pops through the door, breaking his reverie. </p><p>"Hey honey, Teenie says you're a little off today. Feeling kinda drowsy, she said?" </p><p>Credence looks up, dropping his shoulders, and decides then and there that he probably <i>should</i> talk to someone, and if anyone might be a good candidate for that, it's Queenie. It's still a novelty to him, having people in his life that he can safely share something so personal with, especially something so <i>odd</i>.</p><p>"I keep having these dreams, Queenie. Like every night."</p><p>Her brow creases with a touch of worry, mouth already forming into a sympathetic pout. "Aww, honey. More nightmares?"</p><p>Credence sighs again, then takes a deep breath. Part of him wants to keep the dream man entirely to himself, like even speaking about him out loud might somehow jinx it. "That's the thing, Queenie. They're not nightmares, they're good dreams. About, um. They're… about a guy."</p><p>Immediately, Queenie's whole demeanor changes, and Credence feels the shift--he's said it, out loud, he's made it <i>real</i> somehow. Queenie sets down the tray of pastries she's been holding and comes to join him at the rickety little table littered with empty cups. "A guy?" She asks softly, but Credence can hear the excitement in her voice, just barely restrained. She knows he's sensitive, she doesn't want to startle him or push for too much, but he can only imagine what big news this must seem to her. "Who is he?"</p><p>Credence puts his head in his hands and shakes it. "I don't know," he mumbles.</p><p>Queenie sits up straight as a rod. Now she's the startled one. "Credence, did you just… have an <i>anonymous encounter</i>?" There's still a touch of scandalised excitement to the way she says it, even while she whispers the words.</p><p>A laugh stutters out of him as he looks back up and meets her eyes. "No, Queenie… god, <i>no</i>."  For a second, she looks almost disappointed. "I don't know who he is because I've never actually met him. It's just… dreams. All these recurring dreams, always with the same guy."</p><p>Queenie's eyes widen and he can tell she wasn't expecting this. "Oh. Well, can you describe him?"</p><p>He shrugs even as he rolls his eyes at himself in frustration. "I mean, 'tall, dark, and handsome' sounds pretty cliche, but I don't know how else to say it. And that doesn't even cover the half of it, anyway."</p><p>The smile Queenie gives him is growing pleased, now that they're back on her favourite ground again. "So it <i>is</i> 'those kind' of dreams, then."</p><p>His blush is all the answer she needs, apparently, and when she giggles, he quickly clarifies, “They’ve been pretty innocent so far, really.”</p><p>“So far.” She looks unsurprised that he sounds hopeful and leans forward expectantly. “And you have no idea who he is?”</p><p>Credence sighs. “No. He probably doesn’t even exist. I mean, if I’d ever seen him, I’d <i>remember</i>!”</p><p>“He’s real memorable, huh?”</p><p>Giving her a slightly desperate look, Credence admits, “I can’t stop thinking about him, Queenie! As soon as I wake up, all I want to do is go right back to sleep.”</p><p>She looks sympathetic, but it’s clear there’s really nothing she can do to help.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>In his lunch break, Graves’ feet wander aimlessly down Broadway, while his eyes move over the city’s populace with purpose. The odds of him just stumbling over his dream boy, if he even exists, at the right time and in the right place, are astronomically bad; he’s enough of a realist to know that, but enough of a romantic to hope for a miracle anyway.</p><p>For a few breathless moments, when his gaze is drawn to a store window, he thinks: This is it! He’s been pulled here for a reason. He hurries to the large poster advertising: <i>A Week in Paradise… book your romantic getaway to Bora Bora now!</i></p><p>He scoffs. Bora Bora may have it all--crystal clear water, white beaches, tropical sea life and over-the-water luxury bungalows. Unless it has <i>him</i>, he’s not interested.</p><p>As he begins to turn away, he catches a glimpse of a tall figure with dark hair, just sliding into a chair behind a desk. That’s it! That’s why he came here. Triumphantly, he pushes open the door and strides inside the agency, already several steps towards the unsuspecting young travel agent.</p><p>“May I help you, sir?” he says, grinning smugly, as though he’s already made a sale.</p><p>Graves stops in his tracks. The height is right, and the hair… well, almost. Nothing else is even reminiscent of the gentle, vulnerable boy occupying his mind with worrying constancy. “No, thank you. I took the wrong door.” He turns and leaves, deflated. </p><p>Back out on the street, Graves gives himself a stern talking to. He knows how ridiculous it is, going around Manhattan like some lunatic, looking for a boy from a <i>dream</i>, of all things. He’s never been one to believe in any sort of mumbo-jumbo: even as a boy he’d been caught more than once in the pews, rolling his eyes in disbelief throughout Mass. And it feels… almost selfish, if Graves were ever one to criticise himself for his own desires. He has everything he wanted for himself in life and more, all the things he worked hard for, anything money can buy. But that’s just it-- here is something he seemingly <i>can’t</i> have, and it’s the one thing he wants more than anything else in the whole world.</p><p>All his wealth and luxuries seem empty to him in a way they never have done before, when he wakes up each morning from a place that feels like heaven itself, only to find his bed empty yet again. Almost as if the dreams are taunting him, a cruel reminder of exactly what’s missing from his life. Thinking back on that young travel agent from moments before, he realises that there will be no replacing the boy of his dreams. No one, no matter how close they come to looking like him (as if anyone could), will ever be able to fill his place or come even near to bringing Graves that sublime contentment he clings to each day in his first waking moments. He wonders if it will always be like this now, himself, alone, chasing after the phantom kisses of someone his mind likely conjured up out of sheer loneliness. Thinking about it now, he feels like a man in some old fairy tale designed to teach children a valuable moral--the miserly prince cursed to pine in vain.</p><p>He turns on his heel and heads back to the office, determined to lose himself in paperwork and forget those crimson lips he still can’t help but hope to see again come nightfall.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>There was a time when Credence found it hard to fall asleep. Bad memories of the years spent under his foster mother’s iron rule used to surface with a vengeance when he needed them least--namely at night, when he was trying to relax enough… to <i>forget</i> enough... to find rest. Tossing and turning in his room in the apartment he shared with the Goldstein sisters, it was a struggle at first just to sleep at all; when he did, he had nothing but nightmares. Until that first dream which wasn’t.</p><p>He’d fallen asleep from sheer exhaustion that night. He vaguely remembered that when he woke up the following morning, feeling refreshed but, more importantly, feeling soothed.</p><p>The dream had begun with him huddled under the sheets, tears streaming down his cheeks and saturating the pillow he held clutched in his hands. Then the bed dipped and strong arms closed around him. “Shhh, I’m here,” said a warm voice, and he was drawn back against the solid shape of a man--dressed in pyjamas, as he was. “Rest now. I’ll look after you. You’re safe with me.”</p><p>Credence melted into the embrace and listened to the voice as it whispered soothing reassurances and told him to let go of everything that troubled him. His tears soon stopped flowing, and he turned in the other’s arms.</p><p>Even in the dream, his heart skipped a beat at his first glimpse of the man’s face in the sparse glow of the night light. He raised his hand between them and touched a cheek, hoping his eyes conveyed his gratitude, because he couldn’t hope to make his voice function.</p><p>Dark eyes gazed into his for a long moment, glittering with a strange shared joy as of recognition. The hand Credence pressed to the other’s cheek was taken and his fingertips kissed with almost painful tenderness.</p><p>He whimpered softly, and the man let go of his hand, cupped the back of his head, and pressed his gentle lips to Credence’s brow.</p><p>“Sleep. Rest.” The instructions were whispered against his skin. “You’re not alone anymore.”</p><p>He fell asleep, within the dream, and woke up rested and feeling warm and content, with the soothing presence clinging to him like a shield of light throughout the day.</p><p>The dreams continued after that. Every single night, the man was there--with reassurances at first, and comfort, and words that grew more tender, and more sensual, over time.</p><p>His kisses, too, went from fatherly almost-blessings to gentle persuasions. There were no demands made of him, only requests and, over time, Credence went to sleep more and more eager for kisses which coaxed his mouth open hungrily, and touches which left him still feeling electrified with expectation on waking.</p><p>Last night’s dream stayed with him all day, and it’s with much anticipation that he climbs into bed, hoping for… he’s not even sure what, just… <i>more<i>.</i></i></p>
