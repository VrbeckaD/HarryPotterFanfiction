<p> </p>
<p><em>Tuesday, May 26, 1998. </em>They’d made it a month, at least. It surpassed both of their expectations. Over a month under house arrest, being fetched every other Sunday to fortify the shimmering shield over Britain, protecting its airspace. The shield had been negotiated for the wixen world’s autonomy among Muggles. That Voldemort and Harry should do it specifically was their own negotiation, keeping them away from more terrible forms of prosecution. At least, that had been the deal. Apparently, Harry thought as he opened the front door to a half dozen unexpected Aurors one hideous morning, someone had changed the rules without informing him.</p>
<p>Moody and Shacklebolt were at the front; the others he’d only met a few times, and they were still all sort of a hazy collection. For whatever difference that would make – neither Moody or Shacklebolt looked particularly happy to see him, either. “Morning,” Moody grumbled. “Where’s Voldemort?”</p>
<p>Harry pulled himself to his full, very unimpressive height as though to fill the doorframe. “Why?” he asked. “Dawlish said nobody would be by until Thursday, you can’t just – “</p>
<p>“Minister’s orders,” Moody cut him off, clearly not in the mood to get into it. “And I’d rather explain with him present, so….” He made an impatient gesture behind Harry.</p>
<p>“But there’s a <em>contract</em>,” Harry said uselessly, stalling, because he didn’t want to see the day unfold as he knew it had to.</p>
<p>“And extenuating circumstances,” Moody countered. “<em>Go.</em>”</p>
<p>Harry shot him a horrible look as he went. Voldemort was awake before him on most days and indeed today Harry only had a faint idea of what he was doing. But he found Voldemort in the basement, staring at a wall of runes he’d written in mid-air as he sipped (what now must be cold) tea. “Um.”</p>
<p>Voldemort glanced up. “Aurors?” he said with distaste. “You may as well let them in. It was inevitable. You saw the negotiations with Germany, of course.”</p>
<p>“<em>Of course</em>,” Harry echoed self-deprecatingly. “I didn’t, actually. So?”</p>
<p>Voldemort looked at him, exasperated. “Really, <em>what</em> is competing for your attention in this infernal place, that you don’t even keep up with the news?” he demanded. “British and German wixes want talks about trade. But Germany’s taken a hard line, they want me properly locked up before they’ll work with Scrimgeour. I expect he’s gotten an ultimatum.”</p>
<p>Shit. Harry sagged against the doorjamb. “What’d you do to Germany?”</p>
<p>He flashed his teeth. “Nothing. But they’re still, ah, shell-shocked from Grindelwald’s legacy. Which is absurd, there’s more differences between us than similarities….” But he’d gotten to his feet, pulling on a traveling cloak over his robe, and Harry wanted to beg him not to acquiesce. And either Voldemort felt this through Legilimency, or it was just bleeding obvious how strenuously he objected to this, because before he’d said anything, Voldemort flashed him a warning look. “Don’t get involved. They want to protect you. Don’t give them reason to regret it. Now, <em>please</em> go let the Aurors in. I’m sure they’re very impatient by now.”</p>
<p>“I’d go with you, you know.”</p>
<p>Voldemort jerked at this as though he’d been prodded, and shot Harry an irritated look. “You would, and your useless heroism will be your death someday. You see how that would be helpful to precisely <em>nobody</em>?” He took Harry’s shoulders, rather too forcefully, and steered him toward the stairs. “Listen,” he said lowly, conspiratorially. “If it’s Azkaban… I am not affected by Dementors as they affect others, I am told. You understand why?” (He waited for Harry to nod; Voldemort was paranoid enough to not speak freely about his Horcruxes in a home kept by the Ministry. Which might not even be unreasonable, as far as paranoia went.) “So sulk, or carry on. But the Ministry can’t realize this. And they can’t lock you away too, because then we truly would be fucked.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” And that was all he could think to say.</p>
<p>“I need a moment.” And Voldemort pushed him up the staircase, alone.</p>
<p>The Aurors did literally need to be let in. It was part of the security measures of this improvised prison: the amount of magic was throttled here, enough that Voldemort objected that they couldn’t properly defend themselves, so the Aurors had added a charm that kept anyone who wasn’t specifically invited in each time from entering. And indeed they were <em>quite</em> restless outside, when he went to retrieve them. “Come in,” he said, in tones that made clear he’d rather they didn’t. “I’ll put on tea.” Another thing he didn’t want to do, but the basement stairs were in the kitchen, so Voldemort wouldn’t emerge without him.</p>
<p>The Aurors congregated in the living room; only Kingsley followed him into the kitchen. “We really don’t like to intrude,” he said, a bit cautious. “This is critical, however.”</p>
<p>“Is it?” He only just caught himself before he slammed the kettle onto the range. “Scrimgeour needs to impress Germany that badly?”</p>
<p>Kingsley’s eyebrows went up. “Voldemort has caught you up, then,” he said, and Harry didn’t bother denying it. “But there’s more. As Mad Eye said….”</p>
<p>But at that moment Voldemort ascended the stairs, looking a great deal better than Harry felt. “Shacklebolt,” he greeted Kingsley. “It can’t just be you? Harry spoke of it as an ambush…. <em>Ah</em>,” he said as he stepped farther into the kitchen, glancing into the sitting room. “So Harry was right.”</p>
<p>Kingsley’s mouth went tight. “We come with much to discuss,” he said. “The Minister sends his apologies, that he couldn’t join us.”</p>
<p>“No matter.” He strode into the living room, and Harry, making a discontented noise as he gathered up the tea tray, rushed after him.</p>
<p>“Rye, Willoughby, Bragg….” Voldemort was casually greeting all the Aurors as he passed them. He’d been better at learning their Aurors than Harry had; or maybe he’d known them from the war. Harry had never asked. In any case, he set down the tea tray (it was going to go untouched; he knew from experience that none of them wanted to look away from Voldemort for longer than necessary) and took a seat next to Voldemort, on a sofa before the fireplace. “What <em>is</em> the occasion, that you all need to be present?”</p>
<p>A few of the Aurors looked slightly chastised. It did look like overkill: Voldemort, though imposing and inhuman as always, had only ever been poised and professional with the Aurors, since their house arrest had begun. Really, at times his demeanor with them bordered on <em>chipper</em>, which Harry would swear was just to fuck with them. It worked, anyway. But Moody wouldn’t be Moody if he ever did anything by halves, so… a half dozen nervous Aurors sat in their living room.</p>
<p>The one he thought was Rye began: “The Minister’s been in talks with Minister Müller for several weeks now. Germany’s offering very generous trade deals; they say they’ve got surplus, and Britain’s supply lines are still a bit fragile. In exchange we’ll be employing more young German wixes in our Ministry. More visas, you know.” He’d made her nervous; she was babbling, stalling. “But they also insist that you should be in a proper wixen prison, not here. They say they can’t work with a Minister so <em>weak</em> as to let you go free.”</p>
<p>“Oh, is this freedom?” Voldemort asked with faux-politeness.</p>
<p>Rye colored. “Just passing along their impressions,” she muttered. “Scrimgeour asked whether there wasn’t anything else he could offer… but it’s been days now, and we only want a resolution.”</p>
<p>A pause. “Alastor, you brought half the department out here to tell us about trade deals?” Voldemort raised his non-eyebrows at Moody. “<em>Surely….</em>”</p>
<p>“There’s more,” Moody said with irritation. (Voldemort’s wry and mocking performance always got to him most of all.) “We haven’t told the public yet. There’d be chaos.” He glared as something like a warning. “It reached… an ultimatum. That is, Müller said Germany would intervene itself if our Ministry didn’t imprison you.”</p>
<p>By the looks on their faces, even most of the Aurors hadn’t known this bit. Well, shit.</p>
<p>And based on his expression, Voldemort hadn’t known either. Still, he gave a tiny, deliberate shrug. “That would certainly be an embarrassment to the Ministry. Though not your greatest,” he added off-handedly. “But what concern is it of mine, what international crisis is brewing?”</p>
<p>A muscle twitched in Moody’s cheek. “You’re going to Azkaban. Only the dignity of it is up to you.”</p>
<p>“<em>Dignity</em>,” Voldemort echoed with scorn. “The most internalized of social control. And what of our contract?” With a snap of his fingers he’d conjured a thick scroll. Wandless magic was another thing he did to unnerve the Aurors. Moody’s grip on his staff got tighter.</p>
<p>“It’s well within the clause of a state of emergency,” Moody said. “As you say, there’s an impending international crisis.”</p>
<p>But Voldemort had opened the scroll, dropping the heavy end of it in Harry’s lap as he sifted through it. “’If the Ministry finds reason to suspend any part of this contract for political expediency or necessity, alternate arrangements for security, abode, magic, recompense, et cetera, will be made,’” he read out to the room. “Really, you’d be hard-pressed to find an excuse that couldn’t be made to fit that clause,” he said to Moody. “<em>However</em>,” he said slightly louder, cutting off the beginning of Moody’s defense, “I’d be willing to surrender myself at Azkaban. With a proper sentence, one that’s got an end date. Within a year, ideally.”</p>
<p>Moody’s face, already gnarled, twisted into deeper knots of suspicion. “A year?”</p>
<p>“That’s how long I’d consent to stay,” Voldemort clarified. “Any longer and Scrimgeour will have the embarrassment of a breakout instead.”</p>
<p>A longer pause. More of the Aurors in the room were getting distinctly anxious, ready for a fight if need be. Harry wasn’t entirely sure Voldemort wouldn’t kill them (he <em>couldn’t</em>, technically. One, a vow Harry had made swore that he himself would drop dead if Voldemort tried killing the Aurors. Two, there wasn’t enough magic in this prison anyway; somehow that wouldn’t stop him. Harry regretted sharpening their knives just yesterday). Finally Moody said, “I’ll suggest it to the Minister.”</p>
<p>“Do.” He still had the scroll in his claws, picking at its edges idly. “And the Muggles’ shield?”</p>
<p>The Aurors looked at each other. “We couldn’t hold you to it,” Kingsley said, his brow furrowed. “As non-compliance carried with it time in Azkaban… it would be redundant.”</p>
<p>But Voldemort was shaking his head. “I’d rather continue casting it. It’s not a technique that can be passed along easily.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Kingsley’s suspicion was probably well-founded.</p>
<p>Voldemort bared his teeth. “As a gesture of charity and goodwill.” To put them relatively more at ease, he went on: “Because it’s delicate, experimental magic. It’s nearly organic, and still in its infancy. Harry will receive its caretaking techniques and responsibilities when it’s matured, but that won’t be for at least a year.”</p>
<p>The Aurors’ gazes flickered to Harry at this, as though they’d already forgotten he was here. Voldemort had a way of taking up all the space in the room. Not that Harry minded.</p>
<p>“Ah, Harry might be busy,” Kingsley said elliptically, sharing a look with Moody.</p>
<p>“What?” Harry said, surprised to be relevant to this conversation. “Why would I be busy?”</p>
<p>With a permissive nod from Moody, Kingsley leaned forward (going for something like ‘avuncular,’ he supposed, with some measure of success). “Hogwarts will be re-opening this summer.”</p>
<p>“That’s great.” And it was – Hogwarts’s closing or, more recently, its use as a fortress, had been one of the worst irregularities of the war. “But, uh, am I still a student? I’ll be eighteen in July. Even if I didn’t really get a seventh year.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t,” Kingsley agreed. “And you’d be welcome to sit in on classes, particularly if you’re taking NEWTs. But actually… some of the faculty suggested that you might like to teach Defense. Dumbledore’s portrait was a particularly strong advocate of yours.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Huh.” He sat back, warmed inside by the thought. Certainly he’d had the experience, if not an inclination for teaching as a career.</p>
<p>“It would be a one year contact, to begin,” Kingsley added. “Renewable, if it suits you. The faculty thought you… adaptable enough to teach in this transition year.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. I mean, tell them thanks. I’d like to.”</p>
<p>“Minerva says she’ll expect you at the first staff meeting, mid-June.”</p>
<p>“Right.” Taking the end of the contract in his lap, he re-rolled it for Voldemort. (The contract had bits about him in it too, but honestly… nobody thought Harry was the dangerous one. Hence him getting a teaching job while Voldemort got a prison sentence.) “Is that it, then?” He didn’t mean to sound abrupt but didn’t regret that he did. “We’ll need to get to Cornwall this Sunday, as well.” The vantage point from which they cast the shield charm over Britain. Bloody exhausting, and an all-day endeavor, but not as complicated as Voldemort was making it out to be.</p>
<p>“That is it. Do you need anything?” Moody drew himself up on his staff creakily, shaking off Willoughby’s offering grasp. “You know how to work the post, yeah? Can’t set up a Floo here, or owls.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” A book recently left on their kitchen counter, where Harry could write what he liked, and apparently its twin text in the Aurors department would be looked after. “We’re fine, though.” He was subtly drawing them all toward the door. “See you Sunday. Tell Tonks I say hullo.” And he was ushering them out, and most of them looked distinctly relieved to be going, even though nothing had even <em>happened</em>. The twats.</p>
<p>When the front door was shut, rather too heavily, Harry slumped against it. “<em>Ugh</em>,” he said to the house at large, since Voldemort had disappeared into the other room. “Have they got to be so….” But he couldn’t even think of what they were being. He went to find Voldemort.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, hovering over that same book with which they were meant to communicate with the Aurors. He wasn’t writing, though, at least not in it. Instead he was drawing runes in the air above it, frowning as they twisted and changed shape, apparently giving him answers to whatever arcane question he had posed of it. When he noticed Harry in the doorway, he nodded him in. “I hadn’t looked at the charm on this before. Which, really, was careless. It could have been recording any number of things. I’ve found nothing yet, anyway.”</p>
<p>Putting his elbows on the counter, Harry leaned up beside Voldemort. “Oh. Good?” he guessed. He’d never tried writing in it, even. He slid a bottle of ink and quill over, dripping a bit of it onto the corner of the page. It shimmered and vanished, and an old memory surfaced within him. “Like your diary,” he said. Even though it’d probably be a sore subject, given that he had destroyed (<em>killed</em>?) said diary. Still. Perhaps he was even goading Voldemort a bit – he did a lot better when Voldemort was slightly sardonic and scathing, not this faux-chipper act he performed for the Aurors.</p>
<p>And as expected, Voldemort’s face went dark at the mention. “Superficially,” he said. “An emergent property, not something it was charmed to do.” This had distracted him enough from his runes, as he squared off. “Lucius suffered greatly for that,” he said, eyes glinting. “You probably should as well. And the basilisk! Harry, that basilisk <em>belonged to Salazar Slytherin</em>.”</p>
<p>Harry wasn’t sure what either of them wanted out of this exchange exactly, but it was at least an excellent distraction. “That was pretty shit of him, then. It looked like an awfully boring existence.”</p>
<p>“Captivity generally is,” Voldemort sighed, and they were once more facing the dull horror that was their life. “But look.” He stepped back to display the runes in mid-air. “They’ve put Geminio on it, that’s those two symbols.” He motioned to the first two runes. “A Protean charm would have been simpler, but it doesn’t have the same range for runework. And there’s a cipher on it, one that casts the spell persistently, do you see? Fairly clever, not how I would have accomplished the same. But it will do, as a spell benign enough not to trip the Aurors’ security.”</p>
<p>“Their security…?”</p>
<p>Making a face, Voldemort rapped on his skull with a sharp knuckle. “They’ll be crawling all over Hogwarts generally, and you specifically. As a means of communication, I <em>could</em> just shove dreams into your head, but you’d need to be asleep for that, of course. A book of some sort wouldn’t garner nearly the attention.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Yeah, I guess.” He looked up at Voldemort, concerned. “Are you really going to Azkaban?” He hated the thought.</p>
<p>“If our dear Minister agrees to it, yes.”</p>
<p>“But <em>why</em>?” Harry said this so forcefully that Voldemort looked vaguely alarmed. “You haven’t got to be. Just like you haven’t got to be here, either. I assumed you’re just keeping me company.”</p>
<p>Voldemort hummed in amusement at this. “It is by choice, yes. Don’t you find that more meaningful?”</p>
<p>“Meaningful for <em>what</em>? It doesn’t <em>mean</em> anything.”</p>
<p>Harry wanted a confrontation, wanted to be scolded and shouted at because then at least maybe Voldemort would accidentally let slip his true motives. If they were anything more than an unsettling puzzle by design. Instead Voldemort seemed to grow only more amused at his frustration. “I suppose to you it wouldn’t.” He cast a few more spells, idly, at the book. Then, abruptly, he took Harry by the wrist and pulled him to the basement stairs, pressing a hand warningly over Harry’s mouth.</p>
<p>He was not a fan of this cloak and dagger drama, in such a thoroughly undramatic environment. He peeled Voldemort’s hand from his face but followed.</p>
<p>The wall of runes that Voldemort had been studying still hung in the air. With a swish of his wand they expanded, encircling the room, making their faces warm with the glow from the makeshift cage now surrounding them. “Oh my god, <em>what</em>,” Harry said, staring at Voldemort. “It was bugged, then?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Voldemort’s voice was tight. “Not always active, just listening for phrases… and using similar runes, one that barely shifted with activity. God <em>damn</em> them,” he swore, angry enough that Harry took a half-step back, alarmed. (Voldemort only invoked ‘the Muggle god,’ in his words, at the worst times.) “I’d only searched for centralized spells in this house, I thought they’d cast it over the entire place, but the book’s range….” He hissed air through his teeth. “Have you said anything incriminating recently?” he asked, mostly idly. “Have I?”</p>
<p>“You did just threaten me for destroying your Horcrux.”</p>
<p>Voldemort’s look made clear he felt that was incredibly warranted. “We’re using Parseltongue from now on,” he said with finality. “Let them track <em>that</em>. There’s a writing system, Parselscript, you should learn it anyway. Along with runes, of course.”</p>
<p>“I will. I mean, I’ll try.” He swallowed, and forced his mind into Parsel-mode. “What <em>are</em> you planning, then, really?”</p>
<p>Voldemort sank into the same chair Harry had found him in this morning; Harry joined him. “Why would you want the responsibility of knowing?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “I just… worry.”</p>
<p>“You worry,” Voldemort repeated, mocking. “I have suffered much worse than Azkaban, you know.”</p>
<p>Harry assumed that meant himself. “I’m sorry,” he apologized, absurdly.</p>
<p>Voldemort gave him a look, dry and exasperated, before continuing: “You should ask again when things have… settled. Not before you’re at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>It was unsatisfying but what could he do. “Okay,” he said. “Was that the right choice? Taking the Defense post?”</p>
<p>Voldemort raised where his eyebrows would be. “You agreed to it readily enough.”</p>
<p>“Well. Somebody had to do it. And,” (dipping into Voldemort’s past <em>again</em>, normally something they didn’t engage) “they probably just want you to lift the curse on it, anyway.”</p>
<p>Voldemort’s eyebrows shot up higher. “Oh, Merlin,” he sighed. “What secrets of mine <em>hasn’t </em> Dumbledore divulged to you?”</p>
<p>“I think he got in about all of them.”</p>
<p>Voldemort frowned at that. “I’d lift the curse, if doing so would offer any particular leverage. As with anything else.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” This wasn’t unreasonable, he supposed. “Maybe you should curse the Minister’s position instead, then. For leverage.”</p>
<p>This delighted Voldemort in his own cold, cruel way. “It would certainly expedite things,” he said. And before Harry could cleverly, innocently ask what sort of things, Voldemort was up, the cage of runes shifting to accommodate him as he walked to the far side of the basement, to the built-in bookshelves. The Aurors had been pleasant enough about the comfort of this house arrest (“We <em>have</em> just saved the world,” Harry had muttered at some point as their move-in had been supervised) and of course that included Voldemort’s library. “This is probably dated,” he said, flipping through a thin, ragged book. “I haven’t looked at it since I was a student.”</p>
<p>Harry rose to receive it. Strange shapes, with curlicues and jaunting lines everywhere, covered the front. It was exactly what Parselscript should look like. “Thanks. I’ll practice.”</p>
<p>But Voldemort was still at his shelves, now looking at the Defense titles. “And for teaching, you’ll want to read Hornett… Messer… Sun Tzu….” He started creating little stacks.</p>
<p>“Sun Tzu?”</p>
<p>“You’ll appreciate him more than you might expect,” Voldemort assured him. “Historians argue whether he was a wizard. Of course, you could find advocates arguing that <em>any </em>prominent Muggle was secretly a wixie. It gets absurd, at a point.” He hadn’t turned from his shelves, still arranging stacks for Harry.</p>
<p>He had known none of this. “Who are your favorite secret wixes, then?”</p>
<p>“Socrates,” Voldemort said immediately. “And Hypatia. Probably overly optimistic on my part, though, to hope that the dissidents and enemies of the state got off. There.” And he finally turned dramatically, gesturing to his rearranged shelf. “Introduction and method. Curses, counter-curses. Dueling. Zoology. Law.” He motioned to each stack in turn, and frowned. “Would you like any dark arts books proper?”</p>
<p>He couldn’t exactly get any <em>more</em> tainted. “Sure. If they’re not, like, made of human skin.”</p>
<p>“Reports of anthropodermic volumes are greatly exaggerated,” Voldemort not-actually-reassured him. He perked up. “Oh, although if you’re on faculty, you’ll have access to Hogwarts’s restricted section. Assuming the Aurors who will be assigned to you don’t <em>completely</em> infantilize you.” He began pulling dark arts titles.</p>
<p>“I’ll post you whatever you want,” Harry promised.</p>
<p>“Your ideas about the quality of mail service in Azkaban are charming.”</p>
<p>Every time <em>Azkaban</em> was mentioned, Harry’s guts wrenched a little bit more. “Fine. I’d hand deliver them, then.”</p>
<p>“Good boy.” He turned, pressing a stack of dark arts titles into Harry’s arms. “Here. These are the un-cursed ones, at least.”</p>
<p>“Bloody thanks.” But he began flipping through the top book (<em>Out of Order: Dark Arts and its Legal Challenges</em>). “When Barty Crouch was teaching Defense, he said it was important that we experience dark arts firsthand from him and not, you know, in the moment.”</p>
<p>“Do you agree?”</p>
<p>“I think so,” Harry said hesitantly. “He showed us the Unforgivables. And cast Imperio on us, each of us, in turn. I don’t know why Dumbledore didn’t sack him then.”</p>
<p>Voldemort shrugged minutely. “If he’d known. There’s no detection spells for the Unforgivables on Hogwarts grounds. Though really, there probably should be.”</p>
<p>“You know from experience?” Harry asked, against his much better judgment.</p>
<p>“Practicing Avada Kedavra on the edge of the forest,” he said with some relish. “Sometimes I’d do it in the line of sight of Dumbledore’s office window, for the thrill of it. The killing curse I used on my worthless father couldn’t have been the very first time I’d ever cast it. He would have been <em>maimed</em>. Like killing someone with a blunt knife instead of a sharp one. It would have been unpleasant all around.”</p>
<p><em>Ugh</em>. He shuddered. “You’re a psychopath,” he muttered, turning to go.</p>
<p>“Harry.” A strong grip on his shoulder; he turned back. Voldemort gave him a cold smile. “Don’t ever believe I’m not dangerous.” He loosened his grasp and nodded to the stack of books in Harry’s arms. “You’re taking those?”</p>
<p>Hell, he shouldn’t. “Yeah,” he said anyway, slipping out from under Voldemort’s touch to go read.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Three things, after he had consumed a few dark arts books:</p>
<p>1) ‘Dark Arts’ was a legal category, not a natural one. There was nothing inherently ‘light’ or ‘dark’ about a spell until the Ministry decreed it so.</p>
<p>2) As such, most of what got classed as dark magic was guilt by association: spells Grindelwald had created or favored, or Voldemort, or any other dark sorcerers really. Because certainly light magic also had the capacity to harm people, as much as anything. Intention had something to do with it, and so did severity, but most of the distinction came down to, ‘Because the Ministry says so.’</p>
<p>3) Even if all of this sounds like apologia, Harry was never, ever ‘going dark.’ Whatever the fuck that meant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They stayed out of each other’s way (in this strangely, generously spacious home) until evening. The icebox would fill itself with prepared dishes – another spell Voldemort had deconstructed, but deemed innocent – and they cooked anyway. It was as much as Harry usually, tangibly accomplished in a day. Though today, pacing between Voldemort’s bookshelves and the nook where he usually read, he had a month’s syllabus for each year. He held it out hesitantly to Voldemort when the man found him in the kitchen. “Do you care?”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer but, taking it, did settle at the kitchen table to read, as Harry went to chop vegetables. “May I?” he asked, conjuring a quill with a twist of his fingers.</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>So Voldemort scribbled away happily while Harry set a curry simmering. Finally, pouring each of them a glass of wine (and thank god the Aurors withheld judgment on how much wine they consumed. Though Tonks had once politely suggested getting him butterbeer instead, but of course she meant well), he settled at the table.  “Well?”</p>
<p>“It’s very good, so far.” He looked up curiously. “Have you done this before?”</p>
<p>“No. Well, I mean, a bit. My fifth year, the Ministry wouldn’t let us practice magic in class.”</p>
<p>“I have no one to thank more for my successful return than Cornelius Fudge,” Voldemort said, a bit dreamily. “I should send him a card someday, expressing my gratitude.”</p>
<p>Harry snorted. “So we started a club instead, in secret, and I showed them defensive magic. Everyone in my year can cast a Patronus now. We called ourselves Dumbledore’s Army,” he added, desperate to see Voldemort’s reaction to <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>It was brilliant; he made a choking noise somewhere between laughter and disgust. “I suppose at the time your relationship with the Ministry couldn’t have been made worse.”</p>
<p>“No. And Scrimgeour kind of hates me for the same reason, that I wouldn’t work with him. You wouldn’t think he and Fudge wanted many of the same things.”</p>
<p>“I would,” Voldemort said archly.</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes at this predictable cynicism, rising to stir the curry. But as he was crumbling a block of tofu into the pan, there was sort of unfamiliar flurry at the far side of the kitchen. He thought initially that Voldemort had <em>thrown</em> his syllabi for some awful reason, and whirled to protest – but no, the Aurors’ book was fluttering a few inches off the counter. In a dull, oddly papery voice it announced, “The Minister will be arriving at your home on Thursday at eleven a.m. Be advised that he’ll have his full security detail with him.”</p>
<p>“Brilliant.” Harry turned back to the stovetop.</p>
<p>Voldemort was not a great fan of autonomous artifacts, as it turned out. “Has that happened before? Have they sent announcements through it before?”</p>
<p>“Uh, written ones.” He’d glance over at the book sometimes and find a reminder of their Aurors’ next appointment. “I didn’t know it talked.”</p>
<p>This prompted a new volley of spells by Voldemort, to apparently uncover the book’s full secrets. “It should be thrown in the fire,” he muttered at some point. “It’s dehumanizing. <em>Rufus Scrimgeour is a prick</em>,” he enunciated over the book, switching back to English for this test, and when Harry turned in surprise (not that he’d argue the point, mind), Voldemort motioned to a new set of runes. “You saw the change? It means <em>Scrimgeour</em> is a word it’s tracking. <em>I’ll murder the Muggles first, and the Aurors second. Then the Death Eaters will destroy Hogwarts</em>. Hm,” he frowned at the runes shifting in mid-air. “<em>I need to break Bellatrix Lestrange out of Azkaban</em>. I really do,” he said as an aside in Parseltongue, “as she’s quite worthless inside. <em>Harry Potter is a Horcrux</em>?” he said, cautiously. Nothing. He seemed to sag with relief.</p>
<p>“So they don’t know.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Dumbledore knew. At least, he suspected. I don’t know why he wouldn’t have tasked the Order with destroying them.”</p>
<p>“Mm.” Voldemort had lit the kitchen hearth and might have actually been contemplating dropping the book in. “Our world is too small for secrets. Even if he’d trusted everyone – <em>which he didn’t</em>, incidentally – word simply spreads too quickly among us.”</p>
<p>“Who didn’t he trust?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I only meant categorically. He might have presented himself as ‘forgive and forget,’ but Harry, he never forgot. And forgiveness is only ever a performance.”</p>
<p>This was cynical, even for Voldemort. Because they mostly agreed to not talk about Dumbledore (or Snape, or Muggles, or blood politics) Harry let a long moment pass instead. So Voldemort continued hopefully: “<em>Can</em> I pitch this? I’ve got its charms, to replicate it. The awful thing shouldn’t be kept around.”</p>
<p>“If you’d like, yeah.” The Aurors would be annoyed, but it would make Voldemort so happy. And, living in a cage with Voldemort (spacious though it was), his interest in keeping Voldemort happy was really a quality of life issue for them both.</p>
<p>When Voldemort threw the book on the fire, he thought that it emitted something like a scream. Voldemort only snorted. “How dramatic.” He went to put naan in the oven.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Thursday, May 28. </em>The Aurors were as frustrated as expected that they’d burned their book. They preceded Scrimgeour: a dozen, and a different group than earlier, no Moody this time but Kingsley was joined by Tonks. One of the more senior Aurors, and one of the ones less afraid of Voldemort (Whitebone? Brightbone?) was currently castigating Harry. “It was for your <em>safety</em>,” she’d snapped as he’d let them in on Thursday morning. “Everything we’ve done is for your safety. Whether you believe it or not, we still have a responsibility to protect even prisoners like yourself.”</p>
<p>“Voldemort found the tracking charms on it,” Harry said flatly.</p>
<p>Whitebone-Brightbone was unmoved. “Naturally. We have a similar responsibility – a greater one, I’d argue, though Kingsley disagrees with me – to protect law-abiding wixen <em>from</em> you.” (Kingsley looked over at hearing his name, sized up the conversation, and wisely decided not to get roped into it.)</p>
<p>Voldemort entered behind him, apparently unmoved by the confrontation in progress. “Good morning, Camilla. What laws has Harry broken?”</p>
<p>“The ones against sedition.”</p>
<p>This was probably fair, and it didn’t matter anyway, because Scrimgeour entered then, flanked by Moody and another Auror called Bragg. They wore identical expressions. Moody took his place beside Tonks, but Scrimgeour paused to shake Harry’s hand, and then Voldemort’s. Harry wondered if Voldemort’s message that he was a prick had been relayed.</p>
<p>They settled in the living room once more. (Harry began to realize that the reason they’d been imprisoned in such a large home was to fit all the Aurors they wanted to surround Voldemort with.) Scrimgeour, in another gesture of desired civility, poured tea. “I apologize for my absence on Tuesday,” he began. “These meetings with Müller are… thorough. Alastor caught you up on the diplomatic circumstances?”</p>
<p>“He did.” Voldemort was more subdued, relatively, compared to the usual mocking way he spoke to the Aurors. “As discussed then, I’d serve a sentence in Azkaban if you got a proper ruling from a judge.”</p>
<p>Scrimgeour’s eyebrows knitted. “Yes. We’d need an entire court proceeding for it.”</p>
<p>“<em>Exactly</em>,” Voldemort hissed, and Harry looked over at him in surprise. The Aurors had always vaguely deferred questions about a trial, court dates, depositions, and anything else. He’d felt resigned to it by now, an indefinite detention without charges until someone just… let him go. It wasn’t the way things were supposed to work, yet here they were, a month later. Voldemort was clearly less accepting of their circumstances.</p>
<p>Scrimgeour pursed his lips. “As you know, at the moment a trial would cause undue chaos, for the Ministry and our society. It would create more problems than it would solve, in the current political climate.”</p>
<p>“So will I,” Voldemort muttered.</p>
<p>Scrimgeour ignored this. “Really, it’s worked so far…. The negotiations, the allowances I’ve offered, all without trial.”</p>
<p>“What are you hiding?” Voldemort snapped.</p>
<p>“<em>You</em>,” Scrimgeour came back, equally forcefully. (Harry felt how surprised and taken aback Voldemort was by this, strong enough that it bled through their usual Occlumency.) “The Ministry is too fragile right now to fully prosecute you, or to manage the spectacle that it would create. Furthermore, we are <em>grateful</em>” (he said it nearly spitefully) “for your critical role in resolving the last crisis. And I don’t think the Wizengamot would properly factor that in.”</p>
<p>This was obviously not true, such that Harry couldn’t restrain himself. “I saw the Wizengamot pardon Ludo Bagman because they thought he was brilliant at Quidditch,” he objected.</p>
<p>As always, they’d all immediately forgotten about him the moment things began, so he got a lot of surprised (and frankly, inhospitable) looks. “You <em>saw</em> them?” Scrimgeour asked with slight incredulity, but still undeterred, he turned back to Voldemort. “The courts have their own standards and leniencies. I can’t account for them. I can, however, bypass them.”</p>
<p>“Are you truly a representative of the law, then, if you’d rather get things done extra-judicially?”</p>
<p>Scrimgeour made an exasperated sound. (Bad move; Harry had seen exasperation and drama and anger trigger Voldemort’s more caustic side like blood to a shark.) “Is this all on <em>principle</em>?”</p>
<p>Voldemort bared his teeth as though this were a great joke. “Are you a representative of the law, either, if you’re not an advocate for the principle of the matter?”</p>
<p>Harry understood the conversation but he was lost as to <em>why</em> it was happening. Voldemort had seemed indifferent to trial before today; or if he was fussed then he’d at least not bothered Harry with it. He desperately wanted to tell Voldemort to take Scrimgeour’s offer, without jeopardizing whatever Voldemort was playing at. He could’ve muttered it in Parseltongue – but, while not <em>illegal</em> or anything, he’d gotten a lot of dark looks from the Aurors last time he and Voldemort had spoken in Parseltongue. (Harry had only been telling Voldemort to get rid of the bloody handcuffs they’d left in the dining nook, but nevermind <em>that</em>.) Instead he tried pushing this sentiment very hard through their mental connection.</p>
<p>Voldemort might have felt it. In any case, he had now sat back and waited for Scrimgeour to beg, or chastise, or explode – what the Aurors normally did at this point. Scrimgeour did not. Instead he nodded to the Auror nearest Voldemort, who extracted a scroll from his robes and passed it over. “A proposed contract,” Scrimgeour said. “I drafted it personally yesterday, with Bloom and Hare.” The Minister’s personal legal counsel, who’d overseen their first arrest and agreement. “A year in Azkaban, tentatively beginning and ending on June twentieth. Self-surrender may come with certain privileges. At the conclusion of the sentence in Azkaban, you’d be returned here. By that time, a trial seems more feasible. This is not, after all, an indefinite detention.”</p>
<p>Harry had moved in closer to read the contract. “Er, Harry, you’d get your own. There’s nothing about you in this one,” Scrimgeour said, slightly strained.</p>
<p>“Harry’s quite welcome to read it,” Voldemort said, passing it into Harry’s lap entirely. “It must have troubled you deeply, to have Germany accuse you of being soft on crime.” (Now he was just being an arsehole. Harry changed his projected sentiment to <em>Knock it off.</em>)</p>
<p>“I’ve certainly been called worse,” Scrimgeour said, not rising to the bait. “This relationship with Germany seems to be the most expedient way to stabilize the country. Which <em>you</em> nearly destroyed, with your Death Eaters,” he added, anger here slipping through, “so that you should bear the effects seems fundamentally just.”</p>
<p>“<em>Just</em>,” Voldemort mocked. “Perhaps it is, but how would you know, avoiding law and due process whenever possible.”</p>
<p>“You don’t really believe that.” His mouth now in a thin line, he said very bluntly, “If you won’t self-surrender, then you’ll be imprisoned anyway, when I decree a state of emergency and a need for exceptional security.”</p>
<p>“Of course you will. ‘Sovereign is the one who decides the exception,’” Voldemort quoted. “You’ve got no more of an obligatory relationship to the law than I have, Minister. How does that make you feel?”</p>
<p>“I’ve quite made peace with it.”</p>
<p>A long silence. Harry hadn’t noticed how stock-still the rest of the Aurors had become, like rabbits frozen before a wolf. (Two wolves? Harry wondered. They both looked rather wild and predatory at the moment.) Voldemort shrugged, as though indifferent, and conjured a quill. “Visitation,” he said, shaking out the bottom of the scroll. “Books. No human guards. And I’ll need to maintain the Muggles’ airspace shield, every fortnight.”</p>
<p>The last – though it’d been relayed to Scrimgeour before – still seemed to take him by surprise. “Why?”</p>
<p>Voldemort puffed up a bit, irritated at having to defend this request a second time. “Because it’s <em>fragile</em>. Because I’m <em>proud </em>of it. Because it will wither without my magic, and there’s no other single wix powerful enough to cast it again.”</p>
<p>The apparent sincerity and passion took Scrimgeour by surprise. “Oh,” he said, and his intense, predatory air was gone. “Yes. You may.”</p>
<p>Voldemort was now crossing out bits on the contract, and writing in others. The scratch of the quill was deafening.</p>
<p>“And, er, Harry.” Scrimgeour turned to him, as though any conversation could follow what had just happened. “Hogwarts itself will have increased security this year. We could discuss the extent to which that might overlap with your personal security. By which we mean both punishment and protection,” he said, a bit apologetically. (Voldemort snorted; several of the Aurors jumped at the sound but Scrimgeour steadfastly ignored him.)</p>
<p>“I mean, I’m not dangerous,” Harry said. A statement he thought obvious. “You should probably assign more Aurors to… I don’t know, the war zones?” (Hogsmeade was still a mess, and portions of Diagon Alley. There had been a nasty firefight in Eeylops; and more stores had suffered looting, and smashed windows from explosions, at least. They were still profoundly depressing places to be, last Harry had seen them.)</p>
<p>This was apparently the right answer, and Harry tried not to childishly regret it as Scrimgeour lit up. “We agree,” he said. “Of course, we’ll be watching for contraband. You’ll need escorts if you’re traveling to Azkaban,” he said, looking between Voldemort and Harry as though he wanted a great many questions about their relationship answered. (<em>No, Minister, you really don’t</em>.) “And… would you still also be working on the airspace shield?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Really.” He was deadpan, looking back at Voldemort. “This extraordinarily fragile spell requires the particular talents of one powerful wizard, and one teenage boy?”</p>
<p>“Amazingly enough, it does.”</p>
<p>For some reason, Scrimgeour didn’t challenge that. “Aurors will come around on June fourteenth to collect you, and bring you straight to Hogwarts. Professor McGonagall requested that you be at the staff meeting the next day.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. Thanks.”</p>
<p>Voldemort, recognizing that things were wrapping up and he was still writing, drew his wand. Immediately all the Aurors had theirs drawn as well, and it was horrible, and Harry thought he’d have to jump in their midst to stop it. But, casting a spell to duplicate the scroll, Voldemort put the same runes on it that the book had had, to track the changes he was making to it. He dropped the scroll on the coffee table between them with mocking deference; Scrimgeour looked at it and then him with distaste. “Clever,” he said, and it wasn’t a compliment.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>But Scrimgeour took the scroll. And the Aurors moved to leave, and there was apparently a protocol about it when the Minister was present. Half preceded him, and the other half followed, wrapping around him like a cocoon. This time he shook nobody’s hand.</p>
<p>But Tonks was at the rear, and gave Harry a tiny, hesitant smile as they went. After a furtive look over her shoulder (only Kingsley caught her eye, and winked), she squeezed his arm. “Okay?” she mouthed, and he nodded. And then they were off.</p>
<p>And he truly was okay, mostly. Bored, understimulated, and restless from not being out often (Voldemort had yelled at him a few days ago for sprinting the staircase, <em>just because he could</em>), but that was expected. The thing that was most killing him was the lack of contact with his friends. The Aurors could hand-deliver post, but there weren’t any owls. Something like an unplottable charm was over the house, Voldemort had guessed once. Perhaps it was even hidden with a Secret Keeper, wouldn’t that be a fucking kick. So Hermione wrote him a long, thorough letter each week, and Ron would scrawl something at the bottom. Ginny had once sent a stack of Muggle puzzle books with the note ‘Dad likes these,’ that might’ve been sarcastic. For the circumstances, his day-to-day life was actually incredibly boring.</p>
<p>“D’you think they’d bring me cigarettes if I asked?” he asked idly as he passed through the living room, tidying up after their guests.</p>
<p>Voldemort was still writing. “No. Why?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, it’d feel right. Complete the anti-social look. Give me something to do.”</p>
<p>He barely looked up at that. “Wixes are far better at drugs, and you’ve clearly spent no time with Slytherins if you don’t know that. I’ll request a Potions set. And if you start smoking, I won’t kiss you.”</p>
<p>“You don’t kiss me anyway,” Harry objected.</p>
<p>“<em>Harry,</em>” Voldemort sighed. “This draft should be completed before Scrimgeour’s returned to his desk.” He fanned at fresh ink to dry it faster. “Though if you come here, I’d give you a handjob with my off hand while writing.”</p>
<p>The idea of Voldemort simultaneously getting Harry off and writing to Scrimgeour was equal parts disgusting and hilarious, but really would bring the Minister far too close to their sex life. He snickered but shook his head. “I’d rather wait.” Instead, settling onto the sofa beside Voldemort, he looked over the contract’s marginalia. At the top, where Scrimgeour had written the surrender date of June 20<sup>th</sup>, Voldemort had crossed it out and written in the 14<sup>th</sup> instead, the day Harry was to leave for Hogwarts. Good man, Voldemort.</p>
<p>“You should put on a pot of tea while you’re waiting.” Voldemort was now scrawling <em>And I need a Potions set for Harry</em> in a blank bit of the margins.</p>
<p>Thank Merlin. This preceded sex or something like it. And by the time that was set and he was back on the sofa with a mug in hand, Scrimgeour (or another Auror? Probably Scrimgeour) had engaged Voldemort, a second set of handwriting now blossoming over the page. They were on a clause about Azkaban guards now – Voldemort forbade human guards, Scrimgeour wrote that there would be one Auror stationed outside his cell at all times and he should damn well be grateful it wasn’t more. Harry tucked his feet under him, settling in for the long haul. “What’ve you got against guards? Or what’ve you got in favor of Dementors, I guess.” He gave Voldemort a skeptical look. “Do you <em>like</em> Dementors?”</p>
<p>“Nobody <em>likes</em> Dementors. What do you take me for.” Voldemort drew a thick line through the phrase <em>at all times</em> and wrote <em>between dusk and dawn</em> above it. It went unchallenged. “But humans are <em>cruel</em>. Humans are <em>vindictive</em>. Dementors are nothing if not predictable.”</p>
<p>Needless to say, this was unspeakably rich. “But <em>you’re</em> cruel and vindictive,” Harry pointed out, he thought quite reasonably.</p>
<p>Voldemort, hilariously, seemed to take offense at this. “There are terrible ways to die, you know.” And he’d set the quill down, making the conversation real and serious very quickly. “Slow ways, painful ways, humiliating ways. The killing curse is none of those things. Really, there are dozens of curses that should be more unforgiveable.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need your apologia, thanks,” Harry said (though he did see a bit of the point). “You’re not a better person because you kill them <em>efficiently</em>.”</p>
<p>“I never took you for a utilitarian,” Voldemort remarked. “That’s quite Slytherin of you.”</p>
<p>“Urgh,” Harry said. Though, knowing Voldemort, that might’ve been something like a compliment. “I mean, thanks, I guess. But no.”</p>
<p>“You had never wondered why those curses in particular are the unforgivables? They’re not even anti-social in the same <em>way</em>. The Ministry put the Imperius on there because it’d been making their jobs harder at the time. And Avada Kedavra’s on there because they couldn’t stand the idea that their deaths are generally inevitable <em>anyway</em>.”</p>
<p>Again: rich. Seeing Harry’s skepticism, Voldemort went on: “I’m not arguing that these curses are ethical. Just that they’re only not exceptional enough to warrant their own, particularly rigid legal category.”</p>
<p>He was still hesitant to almost-condone this conversation. “Sure, yeah,” he muttered.</p>
<p>“And I’m telling you this because if you do intend to go into the Ministry – in diplomacy, advocacy, ambassadorship – then you might write some useful reforms.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” He still liked the idea. Even if he wasn’t fond of the Ministry itself, and the feeling was more than mutual. Still. “You already tried installing me in the Ministry. It didn’t go well.”</p>
<p>“It didn’t go <em>poorly</em>, really,” Voldemort objected. “And I don’t care for the interpersonal nuance you’d be practicing.”</p>
<p><em>Obviously</em>. Keeping this to himself, Harry instead said, “I’ll have to talk to Professor McGonagall, I guess. I don’t know what sort of NEWTs I’d need for that.”</p>
<p>“Mm. History. Charms or potions, if you’ll be traveling. Defense, if things go south.”</p>
<p>“<em>History</em>,” Harry sighed. “I’ve never paid attention in a single history class.”</p>
<p>“It shows,” Voldemort said dryly. “I’ll teach you myself, though not before potions…. <em>Merde</em>.” He had looked down at the request for a potions set on the contract, and found Scrimgeour’s handwriting had overtaken the page.</p>
<p>“Sorry. Shit. Sorry.” Now was not the time for distractions. As he jumped up to pour another tea, Voldemort was writing furiously over Scrimgeour’s words.</p>
<p>To avoid mucking things up any worse, he settled in to the kitchen to read more, and construct more of his syllabus. He’d drained the teapot within the hour, and made another, despite his desperation and already-crossed legs. And when he heard something heavy get hurled at the wall in the next room, he only put his head down and let Voldemort negotiate.</p>
<p>It was deep in the afternoon when he heard Voldemort cackle, and approach. “He’s spent all day on this,” He said, the contract tucked under one arm. (Had it gotten <em>longer</em> somehow?) “He must have cleared his schedule.”</p>
<p>“Have you got to aggravate him all the time?”</p>
<p>“They’d be more unnerved if I didn’t,” Voldemort pointed out. “I’ve got a moment. Do you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Harry pushed the stack of books away from himself. Onto better things.</p>
<p>He couldn’t say whether the sex in captivity had made him more grounded or less. In any case, he was bursting to piss already, and fighting back an anticipatory hard-on. It took him a careful moment of uncrossing his legs before he could get up, even. “What – fuck,” he interrupted his sultry voice as his bladder sloshed. A breath. “What do you propose?”</p>
<p>He was so bad at being seductive that this was at least as much to amuse Voldemort as arouse him. But Voldemort was too thoughtful to even make fun of him, plotting something. “Give me your magic.”</p>
<p>“Why?” He opened his hands regardless, gathering stray magic in what was now a practiced gesture.</p>
<p>“It will be worth it.”</p>
<p>And so he was passing off magic to Voldemort with one hand while the other was shoved between his legs. Pathetic, really. And then he was being pulled into the living room, pushed onto the sofa and turned away from Voldemort, who had yanked his shirt over his head and was tying his hands behind his back in that way that made him feel vulnerable and exposed and so goddamn hot. He squirmed, enough that Voldemort made a noise of irritation and wound the restraints as high up his arms as they’d go, until his elbows and shoulders ached from the hyper-extension.  He groaned appreciatively.</p>
<p>Then the nappy bag was summoned. (They’d done their own packing, they’d merely added this to the pile, and… well, even if the Aurors had searched it all, what the fuck were they going to say to Harry about it.) Voldemort settled onto the sofa before him. “Open your mouth,” he said, shaking out a spoon bit to gag him.</p>
<p>He was half-hard, and he was reckless, and he was going to argue with Voldemort. “But I’d rather suck you off.”</p>
<p>Dangerous silence for a moment, but Harry didn’t rescind the statement. What could Voldemort do, punish him? Finally: “There’s more work to be done on the contract.”</p>
<p>“Good.” He’d bloody delight in watching Voldemort keep from smudging the contract while he got off. “Please, put the bit in afterward, but first….” He leaned in clumsily, catching Voldemort’s lower lip between him, licking and sucking as a prelude. Voldemort put the bit down.</p>
<p>“Anything else?”</p>
<p>“Mm. No. Here.” He leaned back, precariously, to toe off his trainers and shift his weight to accommodate a nappy.</p>
<p>“Ah.” Voldemort slung the bag away. “You’re going without a nappy tonight. Nor are you using the toilet.” Taking him by an elbow, he steadied Harry as he sunk to his knees on the carpet. But moving was not only precarious but on the edge of panic-inducing, as desperate as he was. He’d been anticipating that nappy. Fuck.</p>
<p>Voldemort liked it when he begged, but he’d be forced to even if he didn’t. “But….” He was rocking his weight from one knee to the other. And now, tied up and kneeling as he was, he had to keep his legs apart to maintain his balance. Sod it all. “But I won’t make it.” His voice carried the faintest note of hysteria.</p>
<p>Voldemort slid onto the sofa before him, kicking Harry’s legs apart farther as he spread his own. “You will. You must.” He pushed Harry’s hair behind his ear, a patronizing gesture that nevertheless gave him chills.</p>
<p>“No, please. I’m… not good at waiting.”</p>
<p>A twitch at his lips. “Clearly.” He pressed the toe of his boot into Harry’s abdomen, at his swollen bladder, making him whimper. “Your toilet training really is underwhelming. We’ve got to begin all over. So when you feel young and helpless and foolish tonight in very wet pants, that seems an appropriate place to begin.” He was unbuttoning the bottom of his robes, parting them. No pants this time, just his cock, already pert at this preparation. He slung one leg over Harry’s shoulder.</p>
<p>This was new, this was creative. He’d never told Voldemort that his toilet training had been… well, <em>perfunctory</em> would be a generous word. And somehow all that shame and anxiety had gotten translated in his stupid head as a <em>thrill</em>, these days. “I’d like that,” he said, lowly, because of course it was still humiliating and wrong. “But I really – <em>ah</em>,” he gasped as a surge of desperation hit hard, making him contort in useless ways to attempt to hold it off.</p>
<p>Voldemort cocked his head. “Suggestion charm,” he explained.</p>
<p>“Not that I need one,” he said through his teeth. “I really – I’m sorry, I didn’t know I’d have to wait. And I want to but I <em>can’t</em>. Please, let me go, just a bit.” He was already babbling. It didn’t bode well.</p>
<p>Surprisingly: “You may.” Voldemort was pulling out his wand now, for some more substantial magic. “At my discretion, with the Imperius.”</p>
<p>Harry’s breath caught in his throat, but he was too intrigued to protest. He nodded faintly.</p>
<p>Voldemort noted his cooperation, wonderfully. “Good boy,” he murmured. “You won’t even feel it. It carries exponentially more control than the suggestion charm. As a means of assistance, really.”</p>
<p>He found his voice. “Yes, sir.” (Voldemort didn’t ask Harry to call him sir. He didn’t ask Harry to call him anything. Harry just liked to, sometimes.) “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Faint amusement. “You’re quite welcome. And really, Harry, don’t look so <em>tragic</em>. Here.” And a twist of his wand cast Imperio. Not like he’d felt in the graveyard, when they’d dueled. Closer to when Crouch-Moody had performed it on all of them in class: light, floaty, simple. The sense of control and constraint that came with it was oddly reassuring. <em>Warm</em>, if anything that originated with Voldemort could be called warm. The panic-thrill of his imminent accident was still there, it just felt unbelievably pleasurable right now. Huh.</p>
<p>“Do you like it?” Voldemort’s voice sounded farther away. Harry made himself focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p>“I love it.” And he rocked himself forward to run his tongue down Voldemort’s cock. Making a contented sound, he picked up the contract once more.</p>
<p>He bobbed his mouth around the erection, wet and awkward like they both liked. His mouth was too small or Voldemort’s cock was too big, because he always felt like he’d either gag or suffocate. Not in a bad way. His own cock was straining against his jeans without even touching himself, partly out of desperation and partly out of lust. (As though those weren’t the same bloody thing for him.) He opened his mouth wide, turning his head sideways, and slid down the length of Voldemort’s cock. A slight groan, a delicious sound because Voldemort never lost control. Not like Harry.</p>
<p>He bobbed and sucked, his chin becoming slick with spit and bitter pre-come. He watched for the moments of weakness, even if Voldemort was not writing tiny words in the contract’s margin. He plunged his mouth on his length, until he hit the back of his throat and retched slightly, a reverberation that’d resonate in the head of Voldemort’s cock. His fingers went white on his quill. Amazing.</p>
<p>He lifted his mouth for just a moment. “Read it to me,” he requested, his voice thick with saliva. “The good parts.”</p>
<p>“You are a deviant,” Voldemort murmured affectionately. “Mm. ‘The prisoner will have access to a library of one hundred books’ – <em>ah</em>,” he choked as Harry pressed a sucking kiss to the tip, swirling his tongue upon the sensitive underside “’— one hundred books, to be approved for both content and structure by the Aurors’ Department.’” A breath hissed between his teeth as Harry sucked near the base, licking and suckling goddamn adorably. He went on, voice a touch lower: “’All books must be published by a mainstream publisher, with minimal marginalia’ – <em>Morgana</em>,” he said, and Harry’s lips would’ve curled into a smile if they weren’t filled with cock. He bounced on his knees now, both to suck Voldemort off and because his own desperation felt the best like that. Performative, obvious, childish.</p>
<p>And then Voldemort’s contract was thrown aside and his hands were in Harry’s hair, unusually unable to contain himself. Harry bloody loved it when he’d pull his hair, and he whimpered in delighted pain as Voldemort’s long fingers clenched against his scalp, pulling him in, holding him tight. He bounced and bounced, his bladder sloshing horrifically, his entire lower half impossibly swollen. His whimpers sent shocks through Voldemort’s velvety flesh, delicious and agonizing.</p>
<p>But he liked watching Voldemort’s face most, when he could. Soft, unguarded – the only time he was ever lost in the moment. His eyes were closed and his thin lips gasped in a tight O, before he caught himself and bit his mouth closed. Amazing.</p>
<p>And he sucked harder, his tongue lapping at warm flesh over and over. An inhalation that might’ve been the beginning of <em>Harry</em>. Fingers scrabbling in his hair, desperate. And he’d sat still, poised and in control, up to this point, but as he came he thrust hard, hitting Harry’s hard palate, knocking him off-balance, bringing tears to his eyes as he choked on hot come. And in that moment he felt the Imperius, or rather its absence, as Voldemort’s control over him slipped, and a hot spurt of piss hit his boxers.</p>
<p>His exclamation of surprise only pushed Voldemort further. Another surge of piss into his jeans and panic in his chest. Voldemort’s come was weighing down his tongue when he pulled back, and he was desperate, trying to talk through it anyway: “Oh god, I’m going in my pants,” he said thickly, trying uselessly to throw his legs together. A dark spot had bloomed on the front of his jeans, and he was pissing so hard that the stream bubbled through. “Vol – bugger – I can’t stop – “</p>
<p>“Imperio.” And immediately the burst of piss stopped and it fucking hurt, making him more desperate than he’d been before, if that was even possible. Dropping his head to his chest, he made a noise somewhere between a groan and a sob.</p>
<p>“Stand up. Let me see,” Voldemort said after a long moment, when they’d nearly caught their breath. And no longer in the thrill of it, the wet heat in his jeans wasn’t as exquisite as it was disgusting and shameful. He wouldn’t argue, but when he got up, he was bashful. A wet spot the size of a handprint, on the front of his jeans, for God and everyone to see.</p>
<p>Voldemort pressed right on the stain, pressing it against Harry’s erection. Thank fuck he could kind of piss while hard, dribble at least, but there’d been no relief accompanying this accident, only shame. And he wanted desperately to cover it, but of course his hands were still tied behind his back. He had to just… stand there.</p>
<p>“That’s a very small accident,” Voldemort said.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Do you feel better?”</p>
<p>“Of course not.” A warning look. “No. Sir.”</p>
<p>“Hm.” Voldemort pulled him sitting. He was going to ruin the sofa. “Do you want to get off?”</p>
<p>A dangerous proposition, in case his erection was in fact stemming the tide. Still, he was immeasurably wound up, and the taste of Voldemort in his mouth was making him hot. “Yeah. Please.”</p>
<p>He said nothing. But Harry’s wet jeans were unzipped – not tugged down, just the zipper, enough that Voldemort could slide his hand inside, fondling him through his wet shorts. “This awful Muggle clothing,” he said, eyeing the jeans with distaste. “Please ruin it.”</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. “I am about to.”</p>
<p>Voldemort’s touch was teasing, indifferent. He even picked up his quill again, the arsehole. Still, his long fingers caressed and weaved and pressed against Harry’s cock, the wet fabric kept warm by his body heat. “I’m letting go,” he murmured, and before Harry could ask what that meant, desperation twisted his insides, and piss swelled to the head of his cock. It was the slightest trickle, still mostly contained by his erection, but he rewet his boxers, and it dripped down his inner thighs. “<em>Fuck</em>,” he said, trying to jump up, to preserve the furniture. Voldemort pushed him back down, dismissively. And then it all came in surges, a panic in his chest that moved into a pain in his torso, finishing with blessed awful filthy relief as, incrementally, his jeans grew saturated. It was maybe ten seconds, when only his thighs had gotten wet, when Voldemort snapped the Imperio back into place. A deep, painful shiver ran through him. He’d never get to finish. And every dribble just made things worse.</p>
<p>“Just let me go,” he groaned. He could’ve pissed harder, gotten some actual relief, without the fucking hard-on in the way. He pushed, in his cock and in his mind, to overcome the Imperio. His bladder only throbbed, and he whimpered.</p>
<p>Voldemort enjoyed his desperation deeply. “When you’re not expecting it,” he said. “Perhaps while you’re asleep. That is, if you can fall asleep tonight.”</p>
<p>“Sod off,” Harry groaned. He was doubled over. He needed to touch himself, and couldn’t, and did his best to grind against Voldemort’s hand instead. Throbbing, humiliating, ineffectual, desperate.</p>
<p>“Beg me,” Voldemort said.</p>
<p>“For what?” Harry’s voice had a pitch of panic. “Let me piss, let me come. I – <em>ugh</em> – it hurts so much, at least one of them – “</p>
<p>“Which?”</p>
<p>The worst decision. “Let me come,” he said, the more proximate need if not the wiser one. “Here – “ And he was pushing himself into Voldemort’s hand, the wet fabric between them rough but not bad. It held him at bay, to keep him from popping off immediately. “Please – you’ve always been so good to me, and so generous. Let me get off, I’ll do anything – “</p>
<p>Voldemort looked up with faint curiosity at that. And his hand stilled while he reached for something, and Harry felt magic, but his eyes were closed as he pumped his hips, reckless and off-balance, against Voldemort’s touch.</p>
<p>“Harry.” And something was being pushed into his mouth, but not the heavy metal of the spoon gag. Something softer. Rubber. “I’ve changed my mind, you haven’t got to beg. Shh.”</p>
<p>The feel of it was not quite a gag – though it was magically adhered in his mouth, a tiny brilliant spell they’d worked out just last week. A soother, it had to be a soother. What the christ. He couldn’t quite tell without going cross-eyed. Though, Merlin, what Voldemort was doing to him now, having scooped up his cock and beginning to rub along its underside, grazing his balls – was going to make him cross-eyed anyway.</p>
<p>His cries were indistinct now, muffled by the rubber filling his mouth. He’d assumed Voldemort had cast Engorgio on the bulb of it, because it filled his cheeks and weighted down his tongue. “<em>Urgh</em>,” he groaned through his teeth, uselessly, as Voldemort let go of Imperio again and a wicked surge ran through Harry. But he was so far beyond pissing, he felt his bladder throb and now his erection was the only thing holding him back. He arched, to finish off and maybe find some actual relief. Voldemort, delighted by Harry’s mute and desperate display, pumped him harder.</p>
<p>His desire and desperation and the best sort of pain crested, and he shoved himself at Voldemort, his cock throbbing. Voldemort’s thin lips curled. One – two – three firm strokes along the underside of his heavy cock and he was spurting thick ropes into his ruined shorts. And Voldemort was reaching beneath his boxers <em>now</em>, to scoop up fingerfuls of his come, to feel it spattered on his long fingers. Harry was helpless against any of the mess he was making.</p>
<p>And the soother was popped out of his mouth, though he could only pant by now, and Voldemort’s fingers were loaded with his come. “Here,” he said, so softly and resonating so deeply that he might have pushed it through their psychic connection instead. Then the thick, tangy come was dropped on his tongue, and before he could react the soother was back in. Spreading his own taste throughout his mouth, layered atop Voldemort’s. He shuddered in arousal and disgust, at Voldemort’s perverse creativity. And then he slumped, each molecule of his body vibrating at a different frequency. He couldn’t say anything of course – and Voldemort only ever mocked the maudlin things he’d say after sex anyway – but looked up with a satisfied, sleepy expression.</p>
<p>Voldemort was dimming the lights and pulling Harry into a more natural position, because they both knew he was useless after getting off. “Can you breathe?” he asked, nodding to the soother. Harry hummed his assent. “We’ll discuss it later.” And, gathering his books and contract, he was gone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He collected Harry for dinner what felt like a long while later, slicing through the ropes without decorum. The soother he let Harry pull out himself, and gave him no instruction on what should be done with it. Harry was fairly sure that his being awkward and anxious around Voldemort was in fact one of Voldemort’s fetishes. He slipped the soother into a pocket, and stood, wincing as the wet, stained fabric slapped his thighs. “Merlin,” he muttered, reaching for his belt to discard the jeans altogether.</p>
<p>“Leave them.”</p>
<p>He shuddered. “But this is hideous.”</p>
<p>Voldemort’s mouth curved. “Incredibly,” he agreed. “However, you made your choice.”</p>
<p>That was true enough. Steeling his resolve, he pulled his hands off his wet jeans, and followed Voldemort to the kitchen.</p>
<p>There were no longer dark, hasty, competing marks on the contract. “Have you finished?” Harry asked, gesturing to it.</p>
<p>“Yes. Scrimgeour was… amenable to my requests.” He didn’t say it as a positive thing.</p>
<p>“Maybe you’ve just pleasantly surprised him.” Voldemort snorted.</p>
<p>“We began on you as well,” Voldemort went on. “I wrote that you’d be looking to diplomacy. He suggested that you should work not in international wixen relations, but rather establishing wixen-Muggle relations.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” He seated himself. “Sure. I hadn’t thought about a preference. What do the Muggles need from us?”</p>
<p>“<em>Want</em>,” Voldemort corrected. “They need precious little but our peace. But there’s legislation to be written, on both sides.” He brought a bowl of pasta and a bottle of wine to the table. “Commerce, for example. They want to buy our products and our labor. We may want their technology. The Ministry’s already established a research team, to sort out tech and magic.”</p>
<p>Arthur’s job at the Muggle artifacts department was probably already gone. “Do they need more?” He pulled the contract toward himself.</p>
<p>Voldemort looked at him curiously. “I hadn’t thought that was among your interests.”</p>
<p>“It’s not.” Conjuring a quill, he wrote in the margin, <em>You need to hire Arthur Weasley to the tech research team.</em> “But my best mate’s dad, he loves Muggles, and especially electricity. He would be so happy.”</p>
<p>There was an unexpected spark of recognition in Voldemort’s eyes. “Weasley?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. How…?”</p>
<p>A smirk. “Lucius hates him, rather obsessively. Sometimes he can’t contain himself.” Then, the wry look fading, he added, “Lucius and Narcissa are under house arrest. Draco couldn’t stay, of course. Unless they’ve apprehended him by now as well. And Flint, Yaxley, and Avery are in Azkaban. Even when I’ve told Scrimgeour, and the rest of them, that my power isn’t derived from my followers.” A frown. “I’ve resurrected myself alone before, as I pointed out. But it suits them to believe that power is still contained and negotiated by the Leviathan.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” He didn’t regret any of their arrests. He wondered if it would be impolite to say so. “Are you breaking them out? <em>Can</em> you?”</p>
<p>“I can, and I won’t. There was a time when I would have, when I needed the most loyal among my ranks.” He sounded perversely nostalgic. “Now, being older and more pragmatic, I would prefer the most competent. Not the ones who let themselves be captured.”</p>
<p>“Tight for them.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.” He shook his head as though clearing it, and returned to safer topics: “Muggle applications for magic are nearly endless. We’ve got excellent leverage, and an excellent means for revitalizing the economy. Quicker than the trade deals with Germany, though no simpler. I told Scrimgeour to sell something to the Muggles before the laws are in place, for easy wealth and plausible deniability.”</p>
<p>“What did he think of that?”</p>
<p>“As little as you might expect.” Voldemort lifted a bony shoulder in a shrug. “I would negotiate it myself, if I could. Their psychiatrists want our cheering charms. Or we might sell them autonomous cleaning supplies, or self-correcting quills, or mittens with warming spells in them. Tiny things, you understand. Insignificant things. Monetize the small things, keep the larger ones for negotiations. Such as the airspace shield.”</p>
<p>“Those are harmless,” Harry agreed. “I’ve got friends who started a joke shop on Diagon Alley, they keep a stock of Muggle magic tricks. They’d probably love to trade.”</p>
<p>“Well, if they’d obscure their business dealings from the Ministry…. Would this happen to be the particularly garish storefront across from the cauldron shop?”</p>
<p>“That’s the one.” Since the Weasley twins’ relation to the law could be described as strained at best, he made a mental note to write them. Twirling his pasta in his bowl, he asked with faux-casualness, “So Scrimgeour would still hire me? I mean, he called me an enemy of the state, so…. And what’s-her-name Whitebone keeps threatening me with sedition charges.”</p>
<p>“Camilla Brightbone,” Voldemort corrected with some asperity. “Only Scrimgeour himself could begin those proceedings, and as previously illustrated, he doesn’t want trials. For anyone, apparently. But yes, he seems to think having you in the Ministry would benefit them. It would improve their image, or at the very least neutralize you under the bureaucracy of it all. It is a possibility that apparently outweighs even his displeasure with you.”</p>
<p>“Huh.” He thought; Voldemort looked at him expectantly. “Whatever Scrimgeour wants for me, though, is probably something I don’t want for myself.”</p>
<p>A flash of his fangs. “Good boy. It is troublesome in its own way. For now, you can only stay back and learn more.”</p>
<p>That seemed to be everyone’s MO these days: Harry and Voldemort watching the machinations of the Ministry; the Ministry for some inscrutable reason keeping them together to learn more of the world domination for which Voldemort was grooming Harry. Or something like that; he had no sodding idea really. “Right. I will.” He looked curiously at Voldemort. “What do they want from you, though?”</p>
<p>“What a fantastic question.” He wasn’t even scathing about it. “Power? Information? Innovation? The Minister has been less than forthcoming.”</p>
<p>“And you think going to Azkaban will push him into asking?”</p>
<p>Voldemort smiled as though he found Harry’s concern over Azkaban just fucking adorable. “No,” he said. “But perhaps it will reveal something anyway.” Infuriating.</p>
<p>It was late in the evening, when Harry was doing the washing up and Voldemort was working at the kitchen table, that he began coaxing the Imperius off himself. It wasn’t unpleasant or invasive, not as Voldemort had cast it this time, it was just like picking at a scab. “I’d show the Imperius to my students,” he said aloud as he stacked dishes in the drying rack. “It was helpful to get it from Moody – Crouch – first. Before that night.” (They didn’t discuss all the instances in which Voldemort had tried and failed to kill Harry. It just wouldn’t help.) “And it – I could see how people could live under it long-term. It’s subtle.” It was distressing, how natural it felt, but Voldemort had to know. Could probably feel exactly the effects on Harry anyway.</p>
<p>He’d set down his book. “Yes,” he said. “Some of them probably never knew, their lives were so unexamined <em>anyway</em>.”</p>
<p>“I mean, I wouldn’t say you did them a favor or anything.”</p>
<p>“No,” he agreed. “But you should recognize – better than anyone, really – that being told what to do, being bound by someone else’s decisions, is not wholly unpleasant.”</p>
<p>Harry flushed. “Don’t philosophize this,” he muttered. “I’m only getting off on it.”</p>
<p>He hummed in some amusement. “Throw off the Imperius, Harry,” he said. “I’ll make it difficult, so you may learn something. Come find me when you’ve managed it.” Scooping up his books, he returned to the living room. Harry heard the crackle of the hearth springing to life.</p>
<p>And simultaneously he felt the Imperius in earnest. It was as if someone had just tightened a belt around his soul, constraining him. <em>Oh</em>. This felt familiar, this felt like the fear and humiliation and hopelessness and panic of the night in the graveyard. He suppressed the desire to go throw himself in Voldemort’s arms and beg him to call it off. Instead he forced himself into something like happiness. He was safe, he was fine. He was just a bit… hindered. Wasn’t that what he was goddamn begging Voldemort for all the time anyway? He resumed the washing up.</p>
<p>Now, it was more like untangling complex knots, or picking a lock. Careful, exploratory, poking for the unexpected weak parts. And he found it, after a few long minutes: he’d begun by focusing on pushing Voldemort’s presence out, but that had felt all wrong. (Whether because of the Horcrux or not, he couldn’t say. Voldemort probably could.) So, instead, he embraced it, until his presence became warm and pliable. “Like wards,” he murmured, dishes frozen in his hands as he’d worked this out. Exactly like the wards, and the counter-intuitive magic that would break them. He shoved magic and goodwill and acceptance into the tight space in his mind where the Imperius resided.</p>
<p>And, once it was <em>his</em> enough (there was no better way to describe the sensation), he began to manipulate it. Press away at the rough and unpleasant bits, until it no longer hurt. Push forward his will, his self, his desire. He couldn’t quite tell where Voldemort’s will ended and his own began… but he never had been able to, really. This sort of porosity no longer bothered him, though. It was all he’d ever known.</p>
<p>So he pushed and pulled at the right moments, feeling Voldemort’s spell mutate under his touch. It was clever, shifting and dodging to avoid detection, or to convince Harry of its own rightful place within him. He had never <em>respected</em> the Imperius before, of course. But the nuance of it was fascinating. He unraveled another knot around his heart, feeling freer. He was close, the spell was loose, with barely any purchase on him now. Putting aside the forgotten washing up, he wiped his hands off and moved to the living room. “Voldemort? I think I’ve about got it – <em>fuck</em>.” He did indeed break the Imperius, and all the desperation he’d been holding onto all night did him in. He jumped backward off the carpet as a warm tide rushed down his legs, and shoved his hands into his crotch to uselessly stem it.</p>
<p>But Voldemort had crossed the room, grabbing Harry and pulling them both to an armchair. “Very good,” he was murmuring, pushing Harry’s hands away because he fucking loved to see him humiliate himself. The denim of his jeans was glistening, tiny streams breaking through the saturated fabric as his overtaxed bladder emptied. Unexpectedly, he felt the Imperius curse once more. But it didn’t stop him. Instead Voldemort hissed into his ear, “Call me daddy.”</p>
<p>He jerked backward, the request jolting his guts. “No,” he tried to say, but only a strangled noise escaped him. He was already so hot, skin prickling with shame and disgust, but this…. He flushed, and he couldn’t even put a feeling to it. He couldn’t, he couldn’t, this was wrong. Wrong like everything else they were doing, wrong in the way he loved and Voldemort so willingly indulged. He scrambled to push his magic and acceptance and self into the curse, to own and manipulate it. “No.” He said it as though he were choking on it. “That is fucked up.” His protest was punctuated by the sound of his piss streaming onto the now-saturated chair and the carpet beneath them. Voldemort’s lap was sodden with his piss, and his robes clung to his erection. Fuck.</p>
<p>The piss draining into his jeans felt amazing, felt hot and shameful. He felt <em>young</em>, he realized. As intended. “I couldn’t hold it,” he said softly, trying this out. Squirming, he shoved his hands between his legs once again. “Sorry.”</p>
<p>“You certainly are.” And Voldemort was unzipping his jeans, peeling them off so the final trickles ran over Harry’s soaked boxers, leaving wet trails along his thighs. And then Voldemort was pulling his own robes back, spread toward his bony hips, and he was arranging Harry on his lap. They always struggled over this bit: Harry wanted to fuck while facing Voldemort; Voldemort wanted to fuck him facing away. Cliché, really. But Harry resisted Voldemort’s maneuvering, dropping his forehead to Voldemort’s collarbone, licking the deep hollow of his throat. “Please,” he mouthed against his cool skin. He tried sounding young, innocent, helpless. “Please. Daddy.” Voldemort’s cock twitched against his thigh.</p>
<p>The word in his mouth gave him shivers down his torso. But… that wasn’t far from the interplay of pleasure and disgust he was getting off on <em>anyway</em>. And Voldemort’s Occlumency slipped – on accident? On purpose? – and he felt the thrill of this recursively. It was fucked up, it was all so fucked up, but….</p>
<p>And then Voldemort reached under his leg, plunging slick fingers inside of him, and he choked. Maneuvering himself on his knees (and thank god for years of clutching a broomstick between his legs, for the sinewy thighs it gave him), he sank onto Voldemort’s rigid cock. He didn’t hold Harry, didn’t guide him, because the control and the delicacy and the whimpering as Harry took him in, inch by exquisite inch, was so much better. And then Voldemort opened his Occlumency again, fully and deliberately this time, until Harry could watch his own gasping red lips and fluttering eyelids. He was already so flushed, his face with a sheen. He’d look better with his glasses off, he half-thought (his ideas already disjointed by the distracting fullness of his arse, but god, he wasn’t nearly finished). And before he could reach up himself, Voldemort was pulling his glasses off his face, pushing his wild hair from his damp forehead. But he was clearly impatient, and Harry felt his bony hands on his sides then, bearing down, pressing Harry onto his cock. He bounced a bit, first teasing and then more desperately, craving the waves of pleasure that shot through his belly.</p>
<p>It turned into a sort of rocking motion, inching Voldemort’s cock inside of him and hitting some good sensitive spot within. And then Voldemort was palming his cock through a handful of his wet boxers, bunched up uselessly around his thighs; and then his rocking became a sort of grinding into his touch. Voldemort was controlled, perfected, as he thrust upward and stroked Harry off in time. And their hands were all over each other, and he was mouthing Voldemort’s throat (<em>cold</em>, he was always so cold) and the heat built up inside him until his ears were ringing. “<em>Ohh -- </em>!” And he was pulling himself up on his knees when Voldemort slammed him back down, filling him up to his belly, spurting hot come deep inside him. His own fluids ran over Voldemort’s fingers, pressed through the saturated fabric, smearing as he still thrust against his touch. He was sticky and wet and flushed with humiliation, and it was perfect. His vision swam as the aftershocks coursed through him.</p>
<p>He crawled off Voldemort’s lap when he was able to. “<em>Urgh</em>,” he muttered, kicking his wet shorts down his legs, and then just pulling his shirt over his head as well because he needed nothing so badly as a shower. “Can I go?” Because Voldemort had clearly had some narrative in mind, and he didn’t want to ruin it.</p>
<p>But Voldemort motioned that he could. “Yes. Oh, here.” And he wiped his hands off on Harry’s torso, dragging sticky lines across his abs. “You are a disaster.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Harry agreed happily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Sunday, June 1. </em>The Aurors acted like they were doing Harry a massive favor when they sent him home with a potions set that following Sunday, after the day in Cornwall with the airspace wards. He’d offered them gold – offered them the key to his Gringotts vault to pull out whatever his imprisonment was costing them, really – but Moody had grumbled about ethics committees and leaving himself open to extortion. So, new potions set, bought by wix taxes. Cool.</p>
<p>It had made Voldemort happy, at least – he’d been restless, in spite of the time they’d spent on syllabi, and history books, and sex. So, even though they were always knackered after wards, Voldemort more than Harry obviously, since Harry was only there as a cheerleader and reserve of magic, Voldemort set up the potions set once they got home late that evening. Harry was tasked with setting up barriers to protect the basement’s bookshelves, in case of explosion, and that somehow took longer than the set-up.</p>
<p>“You’ve witnessed this spell used for the shield for months now,” Voldemort said, coming up behind him as he tried draping a modified Protego in midair. “Why is it a problem?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Harry sighed. “I can cast it normally, just over <em>people</em>….”</p>
<p>“Ah. People.” He said it with distaste. “Either objectify people more or objectify my books less, then.”</p>
<p>Somehow that sodding worked. Summoning all his concern for how sad Voldemort would be if his books were ruined, Harry made the silvery charm pop into existence. “<em>Really</em>?” he said, incredulous. “That’s all it is? You told the Aurors it was so arcane….”</p>
<p>“Well, the ritual elements are more complex. Mainly though, the airspace is simply <em>large</em>.” Voldemort was leading him to the center of the room, where a table held his ingredients, and a cauldron was already set over a burner. “There are some large scale magics that work better collaboratively and others that work better with a single caster. Obviously, the latter causes problems of a prohibitively small population of possible casters who are sufficiently strong.”</p>
<p>He hadn’t known this but it made sense. “And you think that’s why the Ministry wants to keep you.”</p>
<p>“Well, among other reasons. But my death would be their loss, yes.” Somehow he managed this as a neutral statement – normally Voldemort got antsy around the subject of his own (potential, possible, unlikely, even impossible) death. Picking up a boning knife, he twirled it through his fingers. “Potions, though.”</p>
<p>“Just…?”</p>
<p>“For your edification, and my amusement, yes. Unless you’re going to beg the Aurors to have you on after all.”</p>
<p>Harry shuddered. His opinion of Aurors department had dropped precipitously in the past year. “No,” he said. “You promised to show me wixie drugs.”</p>
<p>A glint of Voldemort’s teeth. “Yes.” He surveyed the ingredients at hand. “Given our options… would you rather make something that makes you relaxed, or productive? Don’t even answer that,” he interrupted Harry, “because I already know.”</p>
<p>With something like real offense, Harry changed his answer. “Productive. You bitch.”</p>
<p>A sidelong look. “Right.” But he rotated out the ingredients he was lining up anyway, transfiguring oranges into a larger, pink fruit. “This potion only has unofficial names. Street names. It’s most often called Enki.” He transfigured the cauldron from pewter to marble. “Dice these.” He slid the unidentified fruit toward Harry, turning to go.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Voldemort looked back, surprised. “Because that is the first step.” He did not sound patient.</p>
<p>“No. Sorry. I just… thought you’d explain the theory. Snape never has, in a way that’s helped. If it’s just following directions… then most people would make the house elves do it, like cooking. Right?”</p>
<p>“It <em>is</em> cooking,” Voldemort said, but he’d backtracked from the staircase. “And it has been a puzzle, that you’re able to cook but don’t excel at Potions.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, thank fuck that stir fries don’t <em>explode</em> if you dice an ingredient instead of chopping it. Maybe I just do a little better in a more relaxed atmosphere.” This probably did not serve as a great defense.</p>
<p>“You’re beginning with the dragonfruit because more of your potion will be catalyzed with acid than heat. The cauldron is meant to keep it uniformly lukewarm,” Voldemort said, nodding at the granite. “As such, brewing will be a mixed method, that includes handling ingredients with charms. But you need four cups of dragonfruit before you can do anything else, so….”</p>
<p>“Right.” He picked up a hefty knife. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>And Voldemort left, and returned with handfuls of things from their cupboards, muttering about all the possible effects of the substitutions they’d have to make. “And it’s supposed to take its final form under moonlight,” he concluded with a sigh. “When you’ve finished that, liquidate it with a charm.”</p>
<p>It was different from any potion they’d worked on in class – non-standardized, with mingled method and magic. It felt, well, <em>illicit</em>. And it absolutely kept his attention a great deal more than the structured and exact science of Snape’s classroom. He could learn to like Potions.</p>
<p>It was after midnight when he’d finished, having worked through the glowing set of instructions Voldemort had hung in midair. The last line of the set: <em>Let set in moonlight for minimum six hours</em>. Well.</p>
<p>He climbed the stairs. “Voldemort?” The ground floor was dark. Another set of stairs, and he saw the light on in the bath. “Voldemort?” He knocked.</p>
<p>“Harry, just come in, really.”</p>
<p>He did, to find Voldemort sprawled in a bubble bath, the Panopticon hovering inches above the tub. Score one for magic. “The potion’s finished. I can put a freezing spell on it for later, if you’d like.”</p>
<p>Voldemort brightened at the news. “No need.” One hand emerged from the bath to wave the Panopticon to safety. Harry handed him a towel. “The question of approximating moonlight is an interesting one.” He was so tall and pale and thin as he stood; and yet Harry was finding all his weirdness more attractive than normal humans, these days. Voldemort toweled off the suds and then followed Harry out in the nude, extremely unconcerned. “At worst, you could freeze it until you returned to Hogwarts in a fortnight.”</p>
<p>“You can do that?”</p>
<p>Voldemort paused at the top of the basement stairs. “We do <em>magic</em>,” he enunciated. “You can manipulate the world however you’d like, really. That’s the point.”</p>
<p>“But there are laws. Natural laws, limits to what magic can do.” He followed Voldemort downstairs. “Magic doesn’t mean that we’re breaking the natural laws, it just means that the laws are bigger than what the Muggles think they are.”</p>
<p>A long pause – one that made him nervous because he normally didn’t fight Voldemort in his didactic moments. But all he said at last was, “Perhaps you’re right,” in a way that was actually thoughtful. And then he was dipping a hand directly into the cauldron, licking the lilac fluid off his index finger. “Good,” he said.</p>
<p>“You – <em>what</em>?”</p>
<p>“Here.” Voldemort handed him a pipette of the potion. “It’s meant to be cold and a bit alkaline at this stage. Which it is.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t shake the feeling that tasting an unfinished potion was desperately wrong. But he stuck the pipette in his mouth anyway. Cold spread across his tongue; and the acidity and fruitiness of the ingredients were already gone, leaving only a faint bitterness. “Snape has never made us taste our potions while we made them,” he said around the pipette. “I guess that’d be a disaster.”</p>
<p>“Obviously not all potions can be taste-tested. But it’s helpful, the ones that can – quicker than diagnostic spells. Bring that upstairs.”</p>
<p>Harry hefted the cauldron to his chest; Voldemort gave him a faintly pained look and cast an unspillable charm over the top. To the ground floor.</p>
<p>Voldemort brought him to the front door. “I haven’t studied the wards here extensively,” he said, holding open the door and peering into the black night. “But I assume the nearer ones are merely obnoxious, rather than dangerous.”</p>
<p>“I mean, all the Aurors’ warnings seemed pretty dire.” That any more than ten feet beyond the front door would cause them great bodily harm, and summon guards immediately, and get them less luxurious imprisonment that much faster.</p>
<p>“Of course they were.” But Voldemort was in the garden now, prodding at bits of the air experimentally. “But presumably they’d put wards of increasing severity farther out. Not that it matters for our sake; the moonlight of the charmed sky will be equally effective or ineffective anywhere.” Finding a ward, he tugged on it, and a bright string became visible.</p>
<p>Harry gazed up at what he had thought was the real sky, outdoors, in a remote but normal location. Apparently not. “The charmed sky?” He kind of didn’t want to know.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Voldemort had turned back to him. “This is only an illusion. An antechamber of sorts. Whatever horrible building we’re imprisoned underneath will have half dozen layers of security between ourselves and the outside world.” Harry made a faint choking noise; Voldemort nearly winced. “I thought you knew.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine. I should have expected that.” Should have expected that more than anti-Apparition charms and the magic version of an electric fence was keeping them in. Still, his stupid brain screamed at him, <em>Buried alive, you’ve been buried alive</em>. Suddenly the weight of the world was poised above their ceiling of stars, threatening to collapse in on itself.</p>
<p>Voldemort took the cauldron from him. “The charms seem respectable, at least. It might even be, ah, transferring real moonlight. Displacing it, you see.” He transfigured a stone into a pedestal.</p>
<p>“So we’re in an illusion with real components?” Real moonlight, what the fuck. He plucked a flower, crushing its petals between his nails. It felt real enough. Though, how would he ever really know.</p>
<p>“Plato’s cave had <em>real</em> shadows,” Voldemort pointed out, in what he clearly thought was a reasonable tone. “It won’t be apparent whether the potion’s developed until the morning.” He motioned Harry back inside.</p>
<p>“Wait.” He looked toward the sky, attempting to discern how bloody <em>real</em> the moonlight looked, but also appreciating the loosening in his chest that he hadn’t recognized as being tight. Even if this space was fake. “I’m, um, not good at being inside for so long. Are there brooms, by any chance?”</p>
<p>“Of course not.” Voldemort stepped around him. “The walls of the cell don’t cease to <em>exist</em>, darling, just because they’ve been made invisible. Even if you did bypass the wards.”</p>
<p>Frowning at Voldemort, he flexed his fingers to conjure a rubber ball between them. Then he chucked it as hard as he could toward the sky. It soared into the dark sky, disappearing rapidly –</p>
<p><em>Crack</em>.</p>
<p>His stomach dropped at the sound, and he levitated a spherical Lumos toward the ceiling, washing out the stars (“stars,” as they were). A wide and absurd crack now ran along the night sky, through which they could see what looked like packed earth. (<em>Buried alive, buried alive</em>, his heart pounded.) Still, he looked back at Voldemort, attempting to seem nonchalant. “It’s enough room to fly, at least.”</p>
<p>“Fidelia Squire is going to be livid at what you’ve done to her skylight charm.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well.” He’d apologize for it if it’d get him a broom. Voldemort left him alone in the dark, still, fake night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Monday, June 2. </em>Voldemort handed him a shot glass of lilac potion over breakfast the next morning. He had a matching one. “It seems to have worked.”</p>
<p>“Huh. Cheers.” He clinked his glass to Voldemort’s and threw back the shot. Still cool, but a sort of bitter herbal note had developed overnight. Not bad, really. Voldemort was sipping his glass, a crease between his furrowed brows. “Well?”</p>
<p>“You did well,” Voldemort said (not as though it were a compliment, just a statement of fact). “You could compensate for the artificial moonlight with a touch more baking soda next time.” And he summoned one of his books from the basement, to make a note of that, presumably.</p>
<p>He was going to ask a dumb question. “What should I feel?”</p>
<p>“Not much, at that dosage. Some warmth, some focus.” Voldemort looked up, frowning. “Students aren’t selling potions like this during exams?”</p>
<p>“Nothing that actually worked.” His extremities were growing warm, if he concentrated on it. “Hermione had to confiscate doxy droppings during our OWLs.”</p>
<p>Voldemort’s frown deepened. “That is both disgusting and ineffective.”</p>
<p>“That’s what she thought, too.” Bringing the cauldron indoors, he drank another shot glass worth of Enki. <em>Ah </em>– a distinct sort of drive settled in beside the warmth.</p>
<p>Voldemort had watched him do it. “You should make something of the day, for the potion to do any good.”</p>
<p>“Sure.” It didn’t sound like a bad proposition. Was this how Hermione felt all the time, he wondered incredulously. “I need to work on my classes.”</p>
<p>“Good boy.”</p>
<p>(That would always be obnoxious from anybody else, but from Voldemort it was just… nice.) “Do you want to, too?”</p>
<p>“Ah, no. I have my own work to be done.”</p>
<p>He tried to be casual about it; Voldemort would never tell him what he was doing, on late nights and early mornings. “Yeah?” he asked, super-cool.</p>
<p>Voldemort gave him a wry look. “<em>Yeah</em>,” he mocked. “You should begin. Effects of Enki last five or six hours. Don’t redose before then.”</p>
<p>“Fine.” He summoned his books and parchment wandlessly; they zoomed across the room with unusual force, and he grunted as the heavy spines slammed into his sternum. “Uh, my magic’s stronger now too,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Voldemort deadpanned. “That’s atypical. Perhaps coincidental.” He shrugged minutely. “You should go, in any case,” he reiterated.</p>
<p>“Right, yeah, I’m going.” He went to go do his reading in the garden, in the glorious fake sunlight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And he did work through the day, with a studiousness he’d never felt except in the DA and maybe in Quidditch strategy sessions. (Though he was happier even to be teaching DADA than Quidditch, really.) He’d finished up to the fourth years’ syllabus by late afternoon, when the Enki had mostly eroded into a satisfying lull. He wondered if he was allowed to see what Voldemort was working on. He took the parchment but left the books, returning inside.</p>
<p>Voldemort was in his favorite chair in the living room, bent over a long sheet of parchment, writing furiously. Harry took a casual seat beside him, quietly, as though waiting his turn.</p>
<p>“Harry,” Voldemort acknowledged without looking up.</p>
<p>He peered at the parchment. Voldemort’s handwriting wasn’t the only one on it --- there was a conversation running down the parchment, with more along the top that had already been re-rolled. And the other handwriting….</p>
<p>“Scrimgeour?” he asked. “Still?”</p>
<p>“Intermittently,” Voldemort corrected. “Should I pass along any messages?”</p>
<p>“It’s, uh, bold to have incinerated their book that we were meant to write in, and then send our demands through this instead.” A pause. “Can I have a broom? My broom, really. It’s with the Weasleys.”</p>
<p>“They’ll say no,” Voldemort said, even as he wrote it. “It’s transparently an escape plan.”</p>
<p>Harry frowned. “But it’s not. I mean, my escape plan is just to wait for them to bring me to Hogwarts in a few weeks. Sorry,” he added. It was a kinder escape than Azkaban.</p>
<p>“Well, Alastor Moody has never found it in himself to be trusting when he could be suspicious instead.”</p>
<p>“But… you’re here,” Harry pointed out, obviously. “And not in Azkaban. And not kissed by a Dementor. And I’m here too, for some reason.” It had been the great mystery of their captivity, that the Aurors had just always sort of worked off the assumption that they’d want to be together, and that they could be. And that Harry wouldn’t… radicalize or whatever.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Voldemort said. “There’s no reason to assume this was an act of generosity on their part.”</p>
<p>“Then, what?”</p>
<p>“If I knew, darling, I’d tell you,” he said waspishly.</p>
<p>Fine, apparently that was a sore spot he hadn’t known of. “Sorry,” he muttered. “Is that what you’re trying to get out of Scrimgeour?”</p>
<p>“Oh. No. He wanted my input on policy. It’s reasonable,” he said at Harry’s look. “The dissolution of the statute of secrecy was my initiative, and has been among my chief aims for… decades.” He nearly sighed the word, a flicker of foreign emotion crossing his face. “As such, I’ve got more developed ideas of how to implement the new, necessary policies than anything their committees could suggest.”</p>
<p>“That’s… nice of you.”</p>
<p>Voldemort’s eyebrows shot up. “I am not a generous person either,” he reminded Harry, overly patient.</p>
<p>“So, what, will being a consultant for the Ministry get you out of Azkaban?”</p>
<p>Voldemort charmed the ink dry before rolling up the parchment in a rather insistent motion, his attention now fully on Harry. “I’m staying in Azkaban. How could I write of law and justice without ever having experienced the peripheries of the justice system?”</p>
<p>“Street cred,” Harry supplied. Voldemort looked vaguely puzzled. “Nevermind.”</p>
<p>“And I’ll make myself so indispensable to them – <em>publicly </em>so, my name on their legislation and corresponding open letters in the newspapers – that either their dependence on me or my continued imprisonment will be a refutation enough of their governance.”</p>
<p>“And they’ll… <em>agree</em> to be shown up like that?”</p>
<p>A cold smile. “I have enough contacts in the press who would run my letters, against the Ministry’s wishes. If my writing appears in every paper but the Prophet, then that is its own refutation.”</p>
<p>Harry blinked, suddenly put in mind of his time with Luna. He missed Luna. “I gave an interview to the Quibbler in my fifth year,” he said, “when the Daily Prophet – and, well, Fudge – wouldn’t listen to me, about you.”</p>
<p>“And the credibility of the Prophet, and of Fudge, suffered for that,” Voldemort agreed. “It was a clever decision.”</p>
<p>“Hermione’s,” Harry said. “Most clever things are Hermione’s.” A pause. “So after you show up Scrimgeour… then you stage a coup?”</p>
<p>“Well, I was thinking of doing it by the books, actually.” He was watching Harry closely now.</p>
<p>And Harry utterly failed, because this realization made him guffaw. “Sorry,” he said at the look of irritation that crossed Voldemort’s face, and he was. “Scrimgeour’s going to appoint you to something? Or… oh. Or you’ll get elected as Minister. Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Voldemort stood, crossing the room to retrieve the scotch, to give them both a moment to collect themselves. “I wanted you to know first,” he said, handing Harry a drink. “You would be… well, as dragged into things as you can imagine.” He sat, carefully. “So I am asking, how strenuously should I discourage them – the press, the Ministry’s employees – from seeking you out about the matter.”</p>
<p>He drank his scotch too quickly, to give himself time to consider. (Though Voldemort would never rush him. Harry rushed himself far more, usually to combat silences. Voldemort more often was chastising him for his impulsive mouth.) When he swallowed the liquor burning the insides of his mouth, the only word he had was, “Oh.”</p>
<p>Voldemort was extremely unimpressed. “That is an answer to nothing.”</p>
<p>“Well, that wasn’t the question you’d wanted to ask anyway.” And he sounded a little impatient but that generally piqued Voldemort’s interest, and he motioned for Harry to continue. “The press can come find me if they want. I’ve felt like… like I’ve gotten off easy these past few months anyway, being inaccessible to them. But for the answer you actually want, if I’d endorse you… I don’t know,” he finished lamely. “I don’t know what you want, really. Everyone’s asked me, Dumbledore and Moody and Tonks, and I never know what to say.”</p>
<p>Voldemort was looking at him peculiarly. “You don’t,” he agreed. “But for the parts we’ve already effected – dropping the statute, opening commerce.”</p>
<p>“Everyone wanted those,” Harry objected.</p>
<p>A quirk of Voldemort’s mouth. “I assure you, they are still quite contentious. The detractors tend to be a pragmatic lot, is all.”</p>
<p>“But… it all happened so easily.”</p>
<p>A tiny dismissive gesture. “A non-repeatable zeitgeist,” he said. “I’ve written a manifesto – well, <em>revised</em>, as I wrote the thing at the age of twenty-five – and you could read that if you’d like. But I don’t know that that’s what you’re after.” His eyes were still searching Harry’s face.</p>
<p>“It might be, actually.” Voldemort conjured a scroll with a turn of his wrist and passed it to him silently. “Can I think about this?”</p>
<p>“Of course.” He was unhappy but unceasingly polite.</p>
<p>Harry poured himself another drink but left Voldemort the bottle.</p>
<p>Into his bedroom, door shut and wards drawn over it. (The Aurors had left retractable wards. For his safety, they said. In case Voldemort abruptly changed his mind about killing Harry and came at him with a knife, or something.) His stomach was filled with the knots that had receded weeks ago, when the new status quo had settled in. Because it was fine that he should work with Voldemort, live with him, confide in him, fuck him. Much like the universal curiosity of what Voldemort truly wanted (he supposed he now held the answer to that), there was a universal curiosity about why they remained together, and so close, and so loyal. Harry knew that sentimentality could only account for his own half of things. Perhaps it was all the same question – that Voldemort’s recent cooperation with him and the Ministry both were stepping stones in his political maneuvering. Fudge and Scrimgeour had been attempted to invest Harry’s political capital. Of course Voldemort would do the same. He probably had to throw his lot in publicly at some point. He set his scotch on the bedside table and shook out the scroll.</p>
<p>Forty-nine resolutions, regarding the structure and governance of wixen Britain. It would be forty-nine. It took him a bit to get the hang of the scroll – when each number was prodded with his wand, a little accordion-like section that hadn’t been there before would unfold, with clauses and sub-clauses. Harry wondered if Voldemort knew anything of origami.</p>
<p>As for the resolutions… they weren’t bad, and that was troublesome in its own way, for they could hide so much more malice under a reasonable-seeming veneer.</p>
<p>
  <em>25) Establish wix-regulated commerce between worlds. Exchange of goods, services, intellectual properties shall be considered commerce.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>26) Establish unregulated exchange of artworks.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>27) Implement a tax decrease for wixes, proportionate to inter-world profits. Annual measures will propose new investments of said profits.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>28) Establish Muggle-regulated oversight of inter-world banks.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>29) Establish joint-regulated transit, checkpoints, and interchanges between worlds.</em>
</p>
<p>And so on. It was thorough, and even-handed. Harry would object to the tracking of blood status, for example, on principle (though, did the Ministry do this already? He’d have to ask Voldemort), but just underneath it:</p>
<p>
  <em>35) Establish adoption and foster system for magical children, to magical parents.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>36) Establish parallel early education programs, for wix-born and Muggleborn children respectively.</em>
</p>
<p>Blood regulation sounded bad, but early education sounded… really good. He probably wouldn’t have been spared the Dursleys (there would’ve been no shortage of wixen families clamoring to adopt him, if Dumbledore had asked, so presumably he’d had other reasons), but to have learned of this world any earlier… might have made his childhood bearable. And Voldemort… <em>Tom</em>, really, in this instance, might have been saved. Might have never turned out to be Voldemort. And as much as he liked the current Voldemort, really, he wouldn’t bring another one into the world. He carefully refolded the scroll’s little accordion boxes, and rolled it all up, before returning downstairs.</p>
<p>He’d gone by now – gone to find somewhere to wait as Harry had pored over the document he’d had poised for this opportunity for decades, Harry realized. He handled the scroll a bit more gently.</p>
<p>Voldemort was outside, unusually, in a patch of shade he’d conjured, back at the discussion with Scrimgeour. Or not – his writing now was unencumbered by another hand on the page, Harry saw as he got closer.</p>
<p>“Sit down,” Voldemort said without looking up.</p>
<p>There were no other seats out here, so he conjured one for himself (matching Voldemort’s because he knew Voldemort would like it that way), and sat. “Am I interrupting?”</p>
<p>“As much as usual,” Voldemort said, cleverly leaving out the <em>Only</em>. “Your thoughts?”</p>
<p>The resolutions. “They’re good. They’re thorough.”</p>
<p>“Brilliant. Keep it,” he said, raising his eyebrows when Harry attempted to hand it back. “Of course that’s a copy.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. I mean… the laws on the books now aren’t the ones the Ministry actually abides by. Just promising laws won’t make the Wizengamot want you. Or trust you.”</p>
<p>A glimmer of amusement. “You think I’d be better off running on extra-judicial promises? Everyone knows how things work. If I am too <em>principled</em> for the ways their politics are run, well.”</p>
<p>“<em>Well</em>, if you really want it, then you wouldn’t be principled about it. I would be, yes,” he pre-empted Voldemort’s response, “but not Slytherins. Not the <em>ambitious</em> and <em>self-serving</em> ones.”</p>
<p>“Harry,” he sighed. “Someday you will understand that those are two different words.” He motioned him on: “What I am more interested in than your campaign strategies, however, is your commitment.”</p>
<p>“Right.” He chewed a thumbnail. “I don’t know. Just because you want it can’t be enough.”</p>
<p>“I have been incredibly helpful and cooperative these past few months,” Voldemort pointed out winningly.</p>
<p>“You have been,” Harry agreed. “I haven’t worked out why yet.” He squinted. “Would you tell me why? Or can I not be in on your plans either?”</p>
<p>A noise of indignation. “I am… tired by my current prospects with the Death Eaters,” Voldemort said after a moment. “Almost all of whom are imprisoned at the moment, anyway. The contact with the Ministry <em>now</em> is unusually advantageous. It nearly requires that I parlay it into something better.”</p>
<p>“And when all your beloved Death Eaters are released, and you’re powerful with them again?” he challenged. “Then you can install all your purebloods and take over….”</p>
<p>“You are delightfully optimistic in thinking the purebloods don’t already run the Ministry,” Voldemort said dryly. “And no, I won’t. You didn’t read the sub-clauses of number 16.” He shook out the parchment, laying it on a table between them. Harry leaned in.</p>
<p>
  <em>16.c) Everyone known to be a Death Eater or branded with the Dark Mark would be subjected to the Dementor’s Kiss.</em>
</p>
<p>“Oh.” Harry pushed it away. “Oh, that’s… fucked up, actually.”</p>
<p>Voldemort’s mouth twisted. “As you say, the Ministry’s practices rarely align with its laws. At best, I could keep that one an unfulfilled campaign promise.”</p>
<p>“And at worst?”</p>
<p>“Then a fulfilled one, obviously. Why would it concern you?”</p>
<p>Harry hissed a sigh between his teeth. “Because they’re only <em>mostly</em> terrible, I don’t know. Because I don’t believe in the Dementor’s Kiss at all.”</p>
<p>A look of surprise. “You don’t?”</p>
<p>“What?” Harry said. “I have political beliefs sometimes, too.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” A pause. “Well, perhaps it won’t come to that. But campaign promises…. They have a certain ethos. A certain rigidity. Particularly with an ex-Auror as current Minister, and the Aurors’ office as influential as it is.”</p>
<p>“You warned Scrimgeour once that he couldn’t look soft on crime,” Harry recalled.</p>
<p>“Precisely.”</p>
<p>“But what about….” He sighed once more. They didn’t talk about Snape. It was apparent Snape was living on borrowed time. But he couldn’t not protest. “I don’t want Snape to die. Or Draco. Or anyone else, really. It’s just so morbid, taking out an entire group of people. Even Death Eaters.”</p>
<p>Another pause. “I admit, I didn’t anticipate this to be where your objections would fall,” Voldemort said.</p>
<p>“I can’t be a part of your campaign if you use people’s lives to your advantage like that. Like always.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll keep your name out of it,” Voldemort said. “If that was an ultimatum….”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t.” So that was that, his dilemma solved for him. He rerolled the parchment.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have pointed it out,” Voldemort sighed. “Such a small thing.”</p>
<p>His stomach tightened at hearing the death (well, Dementor’s Kiss) of dozens of people (well, Death Eaters) characterized as a ‘small thing.’ “The rest of it was fine. Not, you know, horrid or fascist or whatever. I’d wondered when you’d implement the awful parts.”</p>
<p>“They’re kept to a minimum, really,” Voldemort said. “Only the most politic of <em>awful</em> ideas make it in.”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Harry muttered, because he hadn’t meant it as a rebuke.</p>
<p>“No – Harry, listen.” Voldemort sank his claws into Harry’s forearm, out of urgency rather than anger. “If this seems abrupt, you’ve only misunderstood my commitments. I would give anything to be <em>powerful</em>, not dark or evil or whatever absurd descriptor you’ve got in mind…. And if power looks more attainable from the side of law right now, well.” A crooked smile. “Is that sufficiently sincere and confessional?”</p>
<p>Perhaps overly so. “Yes,” he said. “I still can’t endorse you. Especially if you think any good you can do is only <em>incidental</em>.”</p>
<p>“Not everyone is as principled as a Gryffindor.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s who will be left, when you put all the Death Eater Slytherins to death.” He startled himself with the bitterness in his voice.</p>
<p>But Voldemort only shook his head in something like disbelief. “Your optimism is astounding,” he said. “Is that what makes everyone so… insistent on protecting you?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. I’m not sure.” He’d done his best to explain love to Voldemort, the irrational and selfless parts of it. He knew it would never really connect – if Dumbledore was right, if Voldemort really couldn’t feel love. But it brought him to one last question: “The resolution about magical children being adopted into magical families….”</p>
<p>“An oft-discussed proposition by the Ministry,” Voldemort said. “It’s never passed, far too controversial. You’d heard of it, then?”</p>
<p>“Oh. No, I hadn’t. Just… if it had been in place, my childhood would’ve been better, and easier. I think.” No reaction; he pushed ahead: “And you? Would you have still ended up being… you?”</p>
<p>He didn’t know why he anticipated anger. It was a personal question, and one laden with implications, but so was everything else they talked about. Still, he felt a relief he hadn’t known he’d wanted when Voldemort only made a noise somewhere between impatience and amusement. “What a banal question,” he chided. “Really, Harry, you can’t <em>save</em> me. And not only because I won’t allow it.”</p>
<p>“I know.” He moved to leave. “I just want… happiness for you.” A non-committal noise was the only response he got.</p>
<p>He was in the threshold when Voldemort added, his voice somewhat strained, “I do apologize for your childhood.”</p>
<p>He thought he misheard, at first. He glanced back at Voldemort, who was watching him carefully. “Thank you,” he said, and then he retreated before he could decide what <em>that</em> all meant.</p>
