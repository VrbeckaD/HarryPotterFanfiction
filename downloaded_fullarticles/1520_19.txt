    <p>Draco lays in the snow, motionless, silent.</p>
<hr/><p>
  <em>Harry loves bookstores. There is always something new and interesting to discover in the assortment of books and stories. They had been safe spaces throughout his childhood and even now, when he doesn’t need them to be a shelter anymore, he likes to lose himself between the shelves and forget about the world for a moment. Today he needs to forget something, just for a little while. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>From experience he knows that forgetting about fund-raisers is unfortunately different from not having to go. Still, he tries. This is one of the draw backs of running an orphanage; a certain need for publicity - which includes fund-raisers. Also, all kind of administrative tasks that would drive Harry crazy in no time but thankfully his assistant, Jaime, takes care of those. Harry is largely free to focus on the enjoyable part, spending time with the children. He plays with them, teaches them to cook or play the guitar, is there whenever they need to talk. But every now and then he is forced to attend tedious events such as fund-raisers. Harry hates them, full of rich people pretending to care about the children when they clearly don’t, stuffy clothes and not one honest smile. Nevertheless, Jaime has reminded him about yet another event coming up. Harry plans to take refuge here, submerging himself in the peaceful atmosphere. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Instead, however, he has Hermione on the phone, going on and on about that thing she wants him to do. To be honest, he isn’t listening. Hermione is wonderful, and Harry feels guilty for not paying attention, but right now he just wants some time to properly lose himself. Surely she will understand. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Mione I’m sorry but I can’t right now. I’m actually in that bookstore you mentioned recently. You were right, it’s lovely. I’ll call you back though, or you can just tell me at dinner Thursday, okay?” That should do it, should bring him some peace. He forgot to consider Hermione’s passion for discussing books, though. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>That isn’t usually a problem since Harry shares this passion - they can often be found pouring over books together, even though their tastes differ vastly. Harry prefers his stories to take him to places far away, build exotic cultures and tell of heroic actions, while Hermione loves gruesome crime thrillers and mystery stories. She likes to either solve the crime out loud while reading or criticise the plot, pointing out logical fallacies. Both are received with eye rolls and absentminded, noncommittal humming noises from a long suffering Ron. Harry had gotten quite lucky in that aspect, only having to withstand one rant about whatever stories she’d read since their last review, whereas Ron is often present while she reads them. Of course, mystery novels aren’t all Hermione reads. She reads the Classics, reads about Important Topics like social issues, politics or the environment. Sometimes Harry thinks she just reads everything there is. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>And sometimes she tries to get Harry to read books other than fantasy. Harry seldom likes them and only reads them after she annoys him about it for long enough. Which she has just managed again. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“That reminds me, have you read Moby Dick yet? You promised you would.” She continues, rambling about its importance and what not. Harry isn’t in the mood to indulge her. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Hermione stop. Yes, I have read Moby Dick. No, I did not like it and it was a terrible recommendation. I have to go now ‘Mione, talk to you soon.” Then he hangs up, knowing she would otherwise force him to discuss every minute detail. It is somewhat rude, hanging up on her like that, but he is confident she will forgive him, eventually. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He closes his eyes, letting out a deep sigh and trying to let the calm atmosphere flow through him. When he opens his eyes, he has forgotten all his irritation with Hermione. Bless the magic of book stores. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You are wrong, you know.” There is a man standing next to him, studiously regarding the bookshelf. Annoyance returns, fast and consuming. Who does he think he is, that he has any right to comment on his private conversations? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Excuse me?!” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The man turns to face Harry and for a short moment he forgets why he had been offended. He is gorgeous, blond hair loosely falling into his grey eyes, which are accented by eyeliner and glitter, making them positively sparkle. Harry is lost in admiration. Until the man opens his mouth. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I said you are wrong about Moby Dick. It’s an excellent book.” Right. The gorgeous bloke is a prick. Harry should have guessed. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“And just what business is that of yours?” He crosses his arms, resembling a petulant child more than he would like, but there is no way he is letting this go.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh none at all, I just thought you ought to know. I couldn’t in good conscience leave you to your ignorance.” Harry isn’t entirely sure the man is serious. There is an odd twist to his lips that might be the attempt to hide a smile - or it might be a suppressed sneer. But Harry is always ready to give people the benefit of the doubt, so he settles on a smile, albeit a little forced. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“They say ignorance is bliss though.” The man laughs and Harry instantly decides he had made the right choice. He has a beautiful laugh, warm and free. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You got me. I wanted to destroy your bliss and doom you to suffer in terrible knowledge.” He is whispering, conspiring, leaning closer, as if telling some grand secret. Harry is starting to enjoy this conversation. How could he not, with a gorgeous and funny stranger almost clinging to him? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Go on then, try and destroy my bliss, if you think you can. How am I wrong in thinking it was a tedious book, forcing more facts about whales on me than I ever wanted to know.” Harry’s smile this time is honest, because he might still be a prick but at least he is also interesting, entertaining and quick witted. Truth be told, Harry rather likes prickly people. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“The list is rather extensive. I’m not sure I have the time to educate you on the marvels of literature right now.” If that isn’t an invitation Harry doesn’t know what is. And he is just intrigued enough to play along. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“How about you tell me over dinner then?” The man laughs again, getting a pen from his jacket and taking Harry’s hand after a questioning glance. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why that was extremely smooth, impressive. This is my number, call me.” Then he winks and turns to go. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“We don’t even know each other’s names, you realise that?” Not that he is complaining, not at all. It somehow fits the circumstances of their meeting. Apparently, Harry isn’t alone with this opinion, because the man only laughs, calling over his shoulder “You have my number. If you want to change this unfortunate state of affairs - it’s in your hands.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Then he disappears, leaving Harry stupidly smiling and with a glittery blue phone number on his hand. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yes, Harry loves bookstores. There is always something fascinating to discover. </em>
</p>
<hr/><p>
The driver is saying something about how it isn’t his fault, how he didn’t see Draco. Harry doesn’t listen, he is focused on Draco’s hand, limp and unresponsive in his. Draco can’t die here, he can’t. Harry won’t allow it.
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <em>Draco is tired. He has been here for hours already. Staring at the canvas and willing inspiration to come. It doesn’t work; it never does. He shouldn’t be this disappointed by it – it’s normal, only to be expected. Thinking he could create something impressive and meaningful every single day is plain naïve. And yet here Draco is, feeling like a failure, like an imposter. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Logically he knows that he should head out, that he isn’t going to accomplish anything more today. But he can’t, something is keeping him here - frozen, feeling as if on the verge of a breakthrough, always just out of reach. So instead of doing the sensible thing and going home, he stares the canvas down. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>At a sudden noise he whirls around, his imagination deciding that’s the perfect moment to strike and supplying him with countless scenarios of intruders, robbing him and destroying his art. It is ridiculous, though knowing this doesn’t impress his fear response at all. Ready to attack first, he is relieved when he finds Harry standing in the doorway, hands raised in mock surrender. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I come in peace, bringing nauseatingly sweet coffee and scones.” The prospect of coffee helps raise his spirits, but with the imminent threat of burglars gone Draco falls back into his previous state of waiting for inspiration. No need to drag Harry down with him, however. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Then your intrusion is graciously forgiven.” He must not have done a good job of hiding his weariness, because Harry sets the food down on the counter, stepping closer. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Draco love, are you alright?” He would of course never admit it, but he loves when Harry calls him that. Harry probably knows anyway; he has gotten uncannily good at reading Draco. Not that he would ever seriously complain. Especially not now, when he doesn’t have to ask Harry to wrap him up in his arms, carding his fingers through his hair and softly talking about nothing in particular. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>It is calming, taking his thoughts away from the accusing canvas. Draco can stay here, until either inspiration hits or Harry takes him home.</em>
</p>
<hr/><p>
The paramedics arrive. They lift Draco off the ground, carry him into the ambulance. His imprint is still visible in the snow. Harry turns around and follows him into the ambulance.
</p><p align="center">
  <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/544492921601261572/606604090163724299/snowinprint.jpg" width="95%" data-pagespeed-url-hash="2556418599" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <em>“Harry, is it supposed to look like this?” Draco sounds dubious, which doesn’t bode well for Harry’s poor food. A quick glance confirms that it is, in fact, not supposed to look like that. How has Draco managed to screw up something this basic? All he had to do was stir it! </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Love, I think that’s the signal to give up and order takeout.” Draco throws the spatula in the pot, sinking back on a chair with a heavy sigh. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why can’t I do this? Why does every time you try to teach me how to cook end with us getting takeout and the kitchen smelling suspicious for a week?” Harry is about to point out that Draco never actually gave him the chance to teach him anything. He is too impatient to listen to Harry’s instructions, instead choosing to do and add whatever crosses his mind in the moment, and too stubborn to stick to chopping and preparing. It is quite clear why no meal ended up being edible; even if Draco refuses to see it and instead opts to pout adorably. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Suddenly Draco sits up straight, a wicked smile on his lips. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“The way I see it, there’s only one possible explanation for this disaster, Potter. You are simply a terrible teacher, darling.” Draco looks smug, sitting on the chair as if it were a throne. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well, Malfoy, I think there’s a crucial factor you failed to consider. You, my dear, are an awful cook.” The offended gasp Draco lets out is hilarious, Harry can just barely keep himself from laughing. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“How dare you! Blaming your incompetence on me! I don’t even know what to say to that. The audacity!” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry steps forward, towering over Draco in his chair. “My incompetence, is it? Are you aware that I’ve taught ten year old children to cook recipes more complicated than this? I don’t know why I even put up with you - can’t even cook something this simple and has the nerve to blame it on me.” Draco looks up at him, staring dreamily at his lips. Harry smirks - he is so easy to distract. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Ah, but you love me.” He seems triumphant, but only for a moment. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>They’ve never actually said it out loud. It is silently accepted, always implied. As soon as Draco realises this he looks insecure, uncomfortable, as if doubting that Harry loves him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“That I do indeed.” He ignores the forsaken attempt at dinner in favour of kissing Draco senseless. </em>
</p>
<hr/><p>
The doctor comes out of surgery to give an update on Draco’s condition - saying the same as before. They can’t tell him anything, nothing of substance, nothing on Draco’s condition. All he says is that they are doing there best, as if that helps. 
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <em>Draco checks the recipe again. Maybe he did miss something? It is the only way to explain this total failure. Who would have thought baking biscuits would be this difficult. The recipe has been simple, too. And yet Draco is hesitant to call the result biscuits. They are definitely badly burned, which would account for the dreadful smell. The dough might be alright, in which case those burned clumps might be edible. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Feeling brave, Draco breaks off a tiny piece of the least-burned one and tastes it. It is terrible. These can’t be salvaged. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Honey, I’m home.” Great, sharing yet another culinary disaster with Harry is exactly what he needs. Before Draco can throw the failed biscuits into the trash where they belong, Harry has wrapped his arms around him, pressing a quick kiss to his cheek in greeting. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You made biscuits? I didn’t know you could bake.” He sounded honestly delighted, apparently seriously believing Draco capable of baking. How the distinct smell hasn’t alerted him yet Draco doesn’t know. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well it turns out I can’t.” He tries once more to get rid of them before Harry does something stupid like eat them, but Harry gently stops him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m sure they are fine, only a little burned. Happens to all of us.” And before Draco could warn him that yes, they were that bad, he takes one. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>A strange look passes over his face, undoubtedly the realisation that his boyfriend can’t bake either and was absolutely right to warn him about the cookies. Harry swallows and manages to suppress a grimace; if Draco hadn’t known what to look for he probably wouldn’t have noticed. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Those are really good. Sure, a little crunchy but that’s not necessarily a bad thing is it? Seriously Draco, they are fine.” As if to prove it, the moron promptly eats another one. Draco truly loves him.</em>
</p>
<hr/><p>
The police are asking questions. They want to blame Draco for crossing the street. Harry could punch them. 
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <em>Harry can’t pay attention to a single word Draco is saying. He is pointing out constellations, explaining the myths behind them or scientific astronomic facts. Usually Harry would love to listen to him, but right now his mind is elsewhere. He has planned this evening to minute detail: the picnic in the park, the fancy wine Draco likes, the clear sky. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Everything has worked out as hoped - all that is left to do is ask Draco. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry doesn’t know why he is this nervous, he doesn’t think Draco would say no after all. What is there to fear? Draco loves him, Harry knows that. Of course he’ll say yes. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Draco, I have something to tell you.” Harry winces internally. He doesn’t sound like he is about to propose to the man he loves, more like he has some grave issue he needs to discuss, pressing news Draco won’t like. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Are you finally going to tell me why you’ve been weird lately?” Apprehension is clear in his voice. With another wince, external this time, Harry realises that his secrecy, dearly needed for the planning, hasn’t only affected himself but Draco also. It seems obvious now, of course Draco would worry when Harry suddenly becomes distracted and taciturn. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He is doing this all wrong. Maybe he should have gone to a nice restaurant; put the ring in a champagne glass or something. There must be a reason it had become one of the most clichéd ways to propose after all. Although, Draco would probably not have appreciated that all that much. Neither would Harry, which is why he had planned this instead. He has considered everything so carefully, chosen a place of which they have fond memories together, prepared Draco’s favourite foods - he even brought a blanket in case it gets too cold. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>No, Harry is going to do this right, they both deserve it. He takes a deep breath, holds Draco’s hands and looks into his eyes. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Draco, I love you. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I love that you make me laugh and that you take every opportunity to criticise my taste in books. I love that I can always be sure that you’ll be there for me, that you somehow manage to splatter paint on every piece of clothing I own. I love your intelligence, you compassion, and your constant sarcastic commentary on the world around you. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I don’t want a day to go by without seeing you smile or hearing your laugh. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Draco, will you marry me?” Harry can’t remember when he has gotten the ring out, but it doesn’t matter, because next thing he knows Draco is hugging him close, furiously whispering “Yes, yes you idiot of course I will marry you!” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry has never been happier. </em>
</p>
<hr/><p>
 Hermione and Ron sit with him. They bring tea; tell him what’s happening outside the hospital. They try to comfort him. They don’t help.
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <em>“Can we finish your book today or are you still sulking because I called it tedious and predictable?” Draco has brought with him the book they were currently reading – one Harry has chosen - and treacle tart, Harry’s favourite, fresh out of the oven. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>After Draco’s first disastrous attempt at cookies Harry has honestly not expected to ever find him in the kitchen again. He should have known better. Draco is too proud and too stubborn to give up that easily. He continuously attempts cooking as well, though he has gotten no better. Harry suspects he just enjoys watching him cook and ruin it in ever so creative ways – all under the pretence of helping and with an innocent smile. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>So he has continued to bake, steadily getting better. It has become their ritual. Draco bakes something delicious and they cuddle up on the couch, reading a good book. What qualifies as a good book depends on whose turn it was to choose, ensuring they both have plenty to criticise. They pretty quickly discovered that their taste in books isn’t compatible, though Draco’s tastes line up perfectly with Hermione’s. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>It didn’t stop them from reading together, loudly complaining about everything and anything, sometimes for the sake of it alone. It turned into a competition, trying to convert the other from his obviously wrong path to the only true way to enjoy books. It involves a lot of fondly uttered insults and bickering Ron cites as proof they are actually an old married couple every chance he gets. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry suspects they are both too competitive to live in peaceful tranquillity for any amount of time - they need something to argue about. He’d rather it be something harmless and enjoyable like books than escalating into a big fight. It’s also great fun, which is reason enough to continue. Most importantly, Draco is wrong and Harry will prove it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh, I am the one sulking, am I? I seem to remember you leaving in a huff when your grand prediction for the plot turned out to be totally wrong. But if you promise not to behave like a twat again, I could be convinced to continue.” Harry adopts a haughty expression, patting the spot next to him on the couch. Draco doesn’t sit down, that would be too easy and not dramatic enough. Instead he clutches his hand to his heart, gasping loudly. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Twat? Is that what you think of me then? When all I did was politely point out flaws in the narrative. I am hurt, deeply hurt.” Harry snorts. His husband truly could be ridiculous. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yes, that is exactly what I think of you. You are an insufferable, spoilt brat who sulks when he doesn’t get his way. Now come here already.” Draco still pretends to be hurt but allows himself to be tugged down, wasting no time in getting comfortable. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You don’t honestly believe that this is better than Frankenstein, do you?” Now it is Draco’s turn to sound haughty. It is impressive that he manages to sound snobbish while he is snuggling up to Harry. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You’ll simply have to live with the shame of being associated with someone who doesn’t like Frankenstein. I thought Victor Frankenstein a right git and his treatment of the poor creature unacceptable.” They have had this discussion; have spent several hours ranting about the various flaws and mistakes of Victor Frankenstein and how he should have handled the situation. While they both have similar opinions about the book, they differ in one crucial point: Draco likes it, likes watching the catastrophe unfold and tracing how a confident young man could go so astray. Harry hates it, hates watching him make one mistake after another. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“My dear Harry, you are a moron. That is exactly the point of the novel, don’t you realise? You are not supposed to like him. But of course, that might be too complex for you to understand.” Draco shakes his head in mock-disappointment. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“God but you are a prick.” Harry attacks him; tickling him without mercy and making him shriek and flail wildly. Usually Draco is better prepared to deflect such attacks, but he has been too focused on demonstrating his grave disappointment and now Harry has him laughing and gasping for breath. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Okay I take it back, Harry, I take it back!” Reluctantly Harry stops his onslaught, laying down next to Draco, desperately gasping for air, and waits for his breathing to normalise. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Prat.” Harry couldn’t help but laugh. Draco sounds more convincing when he isn’t playing with his hair. </em>
</p>
<hr/><p>
 With a tired sigh Harry closes the book. He is almost through, only one chapter left and he will have to pick a new one. When he looks at Draco like that he can almost convince himself his husband is merely sleeping, that he will wake up if Harry were to call for him. 
</p><p>
  But he wouldn’t wake up, no matter how much Harry called. 
</p><p>
 And he tried, for weeks he tried. 
</p><p>
He doesn’t remember much of those weeks. Countless doctors, telling him his husband has indeterminable brain damage, Draco laying unmoving in this bed, worried friends visiting and giving empty reassurances. 
</p><p>
  In contrast he remembers the accident in gruelling detail. 
</p><p>
 Draco laughing in the snow, the night cold and quiet around them, making them feel like the only people in the whole world. A car coming out of nowhere, bright and loud, too close to Draco. Draco’s face eerily illuminated in the headlights, just standing there, looking at Harry for help. A heavy thump. Draco’s body flying through the air. Another heavy thump. Draco laying on the ground, the snow turning red. 
</p><p>
 And now Harry is here. Nobody can tell him anything, not the extent of the damage, not when Draco will wake up, not if it will affect him in any way. The only answer he ever gets is that brain damage is unpredictable. 
</p><p>
 All Harry can do is sit here, be there for Draco and talk to him, read to him. 
</p><p>
 Wait for him to wake up. 
</p>
<hr/><p>
 Harry had waited for this moment. He had waited and hoped, raged against and begged with every power in the universe. And now Draco is awake, at long last. It is both exactly and nothing like what Harry had wanted.
</p><p>
 He used to be able to look into Draco’s eyes and see everything in them. Now he sees nothing.
</p><p>
The doctors can’t explain it. Brain damage, they say, never predictable. The only thing they know with any certainty is that Draco had lost his memory, the last five years roughly. It might come back, it might not.
</p><p>
  All that matters to Harry is that his husband looks at him and doesn’t recognise him. 
</p><p>
 “Of course you know me, Draco. I’m Harry, your husband. Draco, please.” Draco just watches him, mutely. No, Draco doesn’t know him. Not anymore. Harry knows that, he 
  <em>knows</em>
  , but he needs to try. 
</p><p>
 “I’m deeply sorry, but I don’t know who you are. Have my parents been informed of my accident?” It hurts, to be brushed off like this. He knows Draco doesn’t mean to hurt him, even if right now he doesn’t remember Harry, but that doesn’t make this any easier. 
</p><p>
Draco is closed off, no emotions betrayed in either his voice or his eyes. And he asks after his parents, of all people. It makes sense, considering everything. Harry can’t deal with this, can’t deal with his husband waking up a stranger. He needs a moment to process. 
</p><p>
 “Excuse me please.” He all but runs away, desperately wishing for some distance and clarity, wishing for circumstances to be different when he returns. 
</p>
