    <p>Severus Snape was not used to family.</p><p>His own had been held firmly under the thumb of a father who had had definite ideas on children and their place in the family. They were there to listen and to obey, preferably not to be seen unless that too was desirable.</p><p>He had not been allowed to eat with his parents and older brothers until the age of nine. If he did anything that called attention to himself - such as answer one of his father's questions in a tone the man found impertinent - he was relegated back to the nursery until which time, his father would roar, he proved himself worthy of sitting with the adults.</p><p>Even after he had begun attending Hogwarts, he had spent many a family meal in the nursery under the watchful eye of some house elf who would report back to his father any of his grumblings. Severus learnt as a child to keep his thoughts to himself, though he never did learn not to challenge his father either by comment or act or expression. The latter often resulted in the feel of his father's hand across his face, but Severus, alone of the three sons, refused to bow down to his father.</p><p>His mother, as afraid of her husband as was the rest of the household, found the courage to side with this youngest son only once and only in death. She left the entirety of her small fortune to Severus, with only nominal amounts to her other two sons because, as she indicated in her Will, they had no need of more, destined as they were to go on to the well-paying and influential positions their father had chosen for them. She also left the least amount permitted to her husband so that there could be no challenge to her wishes: a sickle.</p><p>Severus was taken aback by his ready acceptance as Ron's partner, especially considering what had happened. That Uncle Severus was as welcomed by the rambunctious Weasleys of Thebes as Uncle Ron made him wary and a little reticent.</p><p>Fleur Delacour Weasley remembered him - favourably! - from the Triwizard Tournament and welcomed him with kisses on both cheeks in the French manner. Bill grinned and wondered at his sanity, taking on his baby brother whom everyone knew was both a brat and a prat.</p><p>Severus wasn't ready for the teasing that went with being one of the youngest in the Weasley family. His own position had been more of pained tolerance on the part of his elder brothers, who were eight and nine years his senior. The episode with the motorcycle had been the only time his eldest brother had paid more than the cursory attention to him. And that hadn't lasted very long after their father had indicated his displeasure with Severus's being allowed to drive a vehicle which was not a proper Severus method of transportation and something which could be construed as a `treat' for this most displeasing of sons. It took Severus some time and one of those late-night conversations in bed with Ron for him to accept that all the teasing was done with love.</p><p>There were three Weasley children in this household. The eldest, Anya, had her mother's looks though not the silver hair: her blonde tresses held more than a hint of Weasley red. At eight, she was curious, active, a natural leader, and often confused Severus with her momentary flashes of adultness soon followed by a reversion to childhood. Freddie, the youngest, was his twin uncles embodied in one brilliantly red-headed, small-boned frame. At four and one-quarter - as he insisted he was - he seemed to be without fear. He ran everywhere, couldn't stand - or sit - still to save his life, with energy to spare. Now and then, he would run out of steam and could be found sleeping wherever it was he had found himself at that time. Once, Severus was horrified to find him in a tree lying on his stomach on a thick branch, arms and legs dangling to either side, some twelve feet off the ground.</p><p>"You should think of sending him to Beauxbatons," Severus muttered one evening as the adults were lounging on cushions around a table, in the style of the place, enjoying a rare quiet late meal. "Hogwarts has already had the experience of the Terrible Twins."</p><p>Bill and Fleur laughed. "He's already been put down for Beauxbatons. As has Anya, though we're still not sure where to send Gabriel."</p><p>Gabriel was their middle child. As unlike his siblings in behaviour as possible. All of the Weasley children had inherited their parents' intelligence and friendliness, but Gabriel alone had their occasional seriousness in spades.</p><p>Bill was one of Gringotts' best Curse Breakers and the day he asked Severus to accompany him to a new site reminded Severus that Bill, though a wellliked fun-loving student, had also been a good one. He watched as Bill's crew - including the goblins - listened to him attentively as he instructed them on setting up, and then verified himself the security precautions that accompanied any curse breaking. There was a great deal of Arthur in Bill, thought Severus, in spite of what Arthur thought. He was meticulous, caring, and took his responsibilities very seriously. Even Severus was impressed with Bill's careful analysis of the situation, the manner in which he removed the curses, one of which proved to be particularly tricky. This was not a profession which appealed to Severus, but he recognized and respected expertise when he saw it.</p><p>Fleur was equally intense about her work. In conjunction with Le Ministaire d'antiquits and its Egyptian counterpart, she worked on the analysis and restoration of Old Kingdom magical artefacts. The wizards and witches of those times had worked openly and often for the Court and its nobility. It was important that, when Muggles located archaeological sites, its magical items be removed so that they could not accidentally set off some ancient magic that would bear consequences in modern times.</p><p>Like Bill, she had a lightness of spirit, a seeming disregard for formal rules that one expected to be carried over in her work. But again Severus had been impressed with her professionalism, with the obvious respect her colleagues had for her when she took Ron and himself on a tour of the complex in which she worked. Only Fleur with one other wizard, Aben Eben Boutros, had been granted permission to deal with the fragments of Old Language scrolls whenever they were found.</p><p>So it really shouldn't have come as such a surprise to find one of their children had inherited all this intense seriousness, but Gabriel was different because of it. He was quiet, a watcher, an outsider. Though he was usually invited to join Anya and her friends in games, he preferred to sit under a tree by himself and read.</p><p>Or to follow Severus around.</p><p>Severus had no experience with children of this age. Gabriel was six. He had watched silently for days, his eyes following these new relatives whom he'd never before met, before he'd decided that they did indeed belong to the family. And though he liked Ron well enough, it was Severus who fascinated him.</p><p>Severus found it bewildering. Why would this child be so interested in him? Gabriel would stand watching whenever Severus worked on the Harley, making certain that there was no sand in any of the mechanisms. It wasn't as though Gabriel got underfoot or did anything that might make him send the child away, but the intensity of the child's brown eyes made him very aware of his scrutiny. When Ron was off with Bill or playing with the children who followed him around like a Pied Piper - not only Freddie and Anya, but their friends as well - Severus liked to sit reading in the quiet. He would look up and find Gabriel sitting in a near-by corner, book in hand.</p><p>Gradually, he began talking to the child and Gabriel would answer in his quiet, thoughtful voice. When working on the bike, Gabriel would now approach and ask why Severus was doing what he was. And Severus discovered that he enjoyed explaining the mechanics of the engine to the child.</p><p>Ron grinned at Fleur the day they found man and child working together at cleaning the sand out of the bike after an afternoon of giving rides to all the local children.</p><p>"He's very nice, your Severus," said Fleur, leaning against her brother-inlaw. "He was quite frightening at times during the Tournament, especially after the last challenge, but that was understandable. He was very kind to me after the second, when I had thought Gabrielle had been going to die because of me."</p><p>"Was he?"</p><p>She nodded. "He came to speak to me and told me that sometimes there was more courage in failure than in success. I have to admit that I have been worried about Gabriel. He's such a loner that I wonder if the fact he is doesn't cause him hurt." She sighed. "I've never seen him get so attached to someone. He actually talks to Severus."</p><p>Ron hugged her. "Well, Severus is the right person for Gabriel to get close to. He's fully aware of the costs of being different, of being an outsider."</p><p>Severus was in the small room that the family used to store their supplies, looking for certain ingredients, when he realized that Gabriel was once more watching him from the doorway. "Yes?"</p><p>"Uncle Severus, what are you doing?"</p><p>Severus had finally had to admit to himself the thrill it gave him to be called `uncle'. Not that he would ever mention it, not even to Ron, but acceptance by this particular family touched him deeply. "I'm finding the items that I need to make the potion your Uncle Ron takes every day. We're beginning to be low on it and I want to make another batch before it becomes crucial."</p><p>The boy said nothing, just continued watching as Severus found all that he was looking for. Arms filled, he turned and looked at the child. "Would you like to help me, Gabriel?"</p><p>The smile transformed the child from serious mini-adult to something closer to his age.</p><p>With the house elves' permission, they used the kitchen that was off to the side of the house: the average temperature of the area meant that all cooking was done out of the house proper. Sitting on the counter, Gabriel watched and listened as Severus explained, in terms he would have used to an adult, what he was doing and why. He talked about the properties of each item, how it reacted with the others he was using, why he was adding certain ingredients later rather than sooner. Throughout his lecture - because Severus could only explain potions in his instructor's voice - the boy's face was wrinkled in concentration, and Severus suddenly got the feeling that should he ask, the boy could have repeated everything he'd said.</p><p>On a whim, while the Quietus brewed, he set the boy to preparing an easy potion on his own. He asked Gabriel to find the five ingredients needed from the store room and then, sitting the boy up on a tall stool so he could reach the counter easily, he instructed him on the making of his first potion.</p><p>Gabriel followed instructions better, thought Severus, than many first year students. The potion was a healing one, for small cuts and scratches. When it was done, he looked at the boy and said, "Well, now to test it." He picked up a knife and nicked one of his own fingers - Gabriel gasped in shock! - and then indicated that the boy was to dip a small cloth into the potion he'd prepared and dab the cut with it.</p><p>The look of amazement and then pride on the child's face as the cut healed properly touched the instructor in Severus. With Bill and Fleur's permission, he sent an owl to Angus Howe and soon a book of simple potions was in Gabriel's hands. Thereafter every morning, unless something special had been planned, Gabriel and Severus took over the kitchen for a potions lesson. They often went to collect ingredients needed either in the countryside or at the market, and Severus found himself giving lessons in herbology, in the proper manner of drying and storing ingredients.</p><p>Fleur hugged and kissed Severus the day she came across her son humming happily away to himself as he stirred a potion - in the proper figure 8 motion Severus so insisted upon - against insect bites. Taken completely unaware, Severus was taken aback by the display of affection and Fleur's tears.</p><p>"Hey! Hands off my man!" Ron laughed.</p><p>"Your man is a miracle worker," sniffed Fleur as she wiped her eyes. "You have no idea how worried I have been about Gabriel. He seemed content, but I have never really known how to make him happy."</p><p>"Not to mention the benefits," said Bill, grinning as he handed his wife a handkerchief. "We'll never run out of potions until Gabriel leaves for school." But he too hugged Severus. "Thank you for taking time with him." And Severus in no way doubted their sincerity.</p><p>"Hogwarts," said Severus, face slightly pink from all this approval and affection. "McGonagall has just hired Jannah Dee away from Paris to replace that numskull Martinus. Gabriel needs to go Hogwarts." Then he looked at Bill very seriously. "Will it bother you a great deal if he doesn't end up in Gryffindor? He really is better suited to Ravenclaw."</p><p>"He can be in Slytherin, for all I care. As long as he's happy."</p><p>Gabriel cried the day they left. Severus held him tightly and felt a surge of love for this child. "I'll send you some more books," he promised. "And you keep me up to date on your successes and your failures. We'll work on those. Even if it's only by owl."</p><p>By the time Gabriel went to Hogwarts, McGonagall had to warn her Potions instructor. "Severus Snape's nephew. You should probably prepare a test of some sort for him, so we can place him in a level that he might find challenging. Pity he's only eleven. We could use him to teach the lower years and free you up for more specialized classes."</p><p>Charlie's family was as welcoming and a lot more boisterous than the Thebean Weasleys.</p><p>Charlie had married a woman with ties to the Romanies, the tribe that straddled the Muggle and Wizard worlds. Her very large family all lived over the next hill and visited constantly. Rommie, as Charlie called his wife - not her real name but she preferred it to Rosamonda - was a seer, a real one, not one in the style of Sybil Trelawney. She could have worked with any diplomatic Ministry but preferred to live with her husband and his dragons in the hills of Romania. In spite of the disorganized state of the household - house elves refused to work near dragons - she was a meticulous note-taker and so was in charge of the Reserve's records and archive.</p><p>Like Charlie, she was not particularly tall, nor particularly slim. She kept her dark, riotous hair under control by cutting it short, and her dark eyes shone with intelligence and her zest for life. They had two children though, with the various cousins who came for a visit and stayed for days, the house was always full of noise. This meant there was always an adult around to keep track of the children, but it also meant the family of four with two visiting uncles sat down to meals at a long table set for a dozen or more. Even Ron found he needed to get away from the constant talking.</p><p>Charlie was sympathetic. "Now you have an idea what growing up in the Burrow was like," he said to Severus as the three of them went off to check out a nest.</p><p>Severus shook his head. "Don't you ever wish that you and your wife could sit quietly, just the two of you?"</p><p>"Why do you think we spend so much time in the Reserve offices?" laughed Charlie.</p><p>Charlie's children - a boy, Tomas, aged seven and a girl, Laurence, five - had both inherited their mother's hair and their father's colouring. They reminded Severus of Freddie and his inability to settle down for any reason. Though, for Ron, they would occasionally sit down and listen to him telling stories, such as how Norbert had come to be here at the Reserve. Severus winced to think how they would do at Hogwarts.</p><p>"Do to Hogwarts, I think you mean," laughed Ron. "But I know what you mean. They're bright and delightful, but they wear one out."</p><p>Severus tipped Ron's face up from the shoulder it was resting against to scrutinize his lover. "Don't let them do that to you. Wear you out. That's my responsibility."</p><p>But worn out was what Ron was so that when he became ill, Severus was livid with himself for not realizing what the stresses and adaptations of travel had been doing to his lover. There was a short but virulent stomach flu making its way through the wizard community near and in the Reserve, and though a remedial potion took care of that for most of them, Ron was a different matter. The remedy had a devastating reaction with the Quietus and Ron not only had to deal with the flu but with the fact that he now vomited at the slightest taste of the Quietus.</p><p>He was back to how he'd been before the Quietus. Charlie, no longer used to seeing his brother as he'd been the few times he'd gone back home after the War, was as devastated as Severus. His concern affected everyone in the house. Rommie firmly put her foot down and sent him with the children to stay with her family while she and Severus took care of Ron in the suddenly quiet house.</p><p>Severus was silently terrified that the Quietus would never again work for Ron. Ron didn't mention it but Rommie could see the fear in his eyes. She sat next to the bed where Severus was holding his shuddering lover as tightly as he dared. Face far more serious than Severus had ever seen it since their arrival, Rommie lay her hands on Ron's head and closed her eyes. Unlike Trelawney who went into a `trance' when she `saw', Rommie hummed quietly as she concentrated.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, she smiled at her brother-in-law. "Only twentyfour more hours and the flu will be gone from your body. The Quietus will continue working as it has." She pushed the sweat-sodden hair off Ron's face. "All will be as it should be." She leaned over and kissed him on the forehead. "I think that some mint tea will help."</p><p>And it did, though only a teaspoon at a time at first.</p><p>By the time the flu had worked its way out of Ron's body and a dose of Quietus actually stayed in his system, Severus was exhausted. He had refused to leave Ron except when Rommie pressed him to eat something, out of Ron's room, or when he needed to use the bathroom. Rommie stayed with Ron those times and held him, singing Romany lullabies to him as she did to her children when they finally wore out enough to sleep.</p><p>Severus stood standing by the bed, weaving on his feet, watching as the first decent dose of Quietus Ron had taken in almost sixty hours worked its usual magic and he slept untrembling.</p><p>"Severus, come." Rommie gently tugged Severus out of their room, down the hall to the kitchen. There she made a pot of mint tea and watched him drink it.</p><p>Severus stared into the cup. "What else did you see?" He looked up when she didn't answer. "Please."</p><p>"Nothing that need concern you. Ron will be well and so will you be. You will be together until the death of one of you, which will not occur for many, many, many years. More than that I will not tell. Life is to be discovered not awaited." She patted his hand. "Now go to bed. I promise not to send for the rest of my brood until Ron is able to deal with them."</p><p>Severus cocked his head. "And then," he offered warily, "I think it would be best if we went home."</p><p>Rommie nodded, knowing that he was afraid she and Charlie would be hurt, or worse insulted, that they weren't remaining with them as long as they had with Bill and his family. "Severus, it is all right. I know what our life is like. It works well for us, but Ron needs to recover and his home will be best. But you must do something for me before you leave."</p><p>"Whatever I can."</p><p>"You must forgive yourself for thinking that you had anything to do with Ron's getting ill. These things happen and will continue to happen. Not just to Ron, but to you as well." She put up her hand, forestalling his response to her comments. "Do you expect Ron to feel guilty when you will come down with that cold at Christmas because you got caught in a rainstorm coming back from the library with the books he wanted?"</p><p>Severus sat back in his chair and glared at her. "I noticed that he was looking tired but I did nothing about it."</p><p>She reacted to his glare the same way she did to her son's: she smiled at him. "Ron will know that rain is in the forecast but he will not stop you from going to the library."</p><p>"It's not the same."</p><p>"Isn't it?" She stood up. "Go to bed, Severus Snape, and think about that when you're rested."</p><p>At the doorway of the kitchen, Severus stopped. "Maybe you should warn Ron about that cold. I hate being ill and I'm not a good patient. Good night, Rommie, and thank you. I will think about what you've said."</p><p>It was easier said than done. For the first few days after he got out of bed, Ron's energy levels were not high and Severus hovered close by in case of anything. Ron fell asleep after any activity and didn't protest very hard when Severus insisted that he nap in the afternoons.</p><p>Rommie made her family happy by asking them to keep the children for a few days as well as staying away. Noisy and boisterous as they were, they were very understanding when she and Charlie explained about Ron and his need for quiet. Charlie came home, and spent the evenings quietly talking with his brother and Severus.</p><p>A fortnight after Ron got out of bed, with everyone's best wishes, lots of hugs and kisses, sidecar packed tight with gifts for them and all the Weasleys, Severus and Ron along with the Harley began the trip home in easy apparating stages. Severus made use of Howe's list of wizards for stop-overs and never stayed more than a night, always very watchful of Ron's energy levels. Miss Jones and Howe were waiting for them at the warehouse when they apparated in it. Howe had, at Severus's request, removed all wards until they arrived safely. There were quick greetings and promises to get together for hearing all about their travels, then Howe restored all the wards before leaving with Miss Jones to disapparate back to his office from her house.</p><p>So five months after they had taken off, Severus and Ron slept in their own bed once more.</p><p>Two days later, the doorbell rang in warning and Miss Jones, accompanied by Minerva McGonagall and Poppy Pomfrey, came visiting. While Severus was invited to join the cousins in the food bank office for some gossip, Pomfrey examined Ron from top to bottom, inside and out. Afterwards, they all sat around the kitchen table, eating treats sent by the house elves who had heard about Ron's being ill, and drinking tea. Pomfrey pronounced Ron well enough but glared at Severus. "I think both of you need to rest a little before you set off on yet another adventure. Severus, you could stand to lose those circles under your eyes. And both of you need to gain a few pounds. Some good, solid British food is what you need. All that foreign stuff is interesting, but it's not what British wizards need to put meat on their bones."</p>
