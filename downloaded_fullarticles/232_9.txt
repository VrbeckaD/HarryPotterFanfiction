  <u>Maeve </u>
</p><p>“Get your lazy arse up girl, if you can’t be bothered to get up you’re not going to school. I’ll keep you here ‘till the year is done.”</p><p>“You hear me girl?”</p><p>“Yes, Father.”</p><p>“Hurry. Up.”</p><p align="center">❃</p><p>Ah yes, the famous Dacian Wilder, my dear old dad. A pureblood wizard known across Britain for his intellect, wit and charming nature that eventually bagged him a wife, Amorette Hjelmstad. A gorgeous and smart Norwegian witch who gave him three ‘perfect’ children. Soren, Maeve and Marigold all who were known to be well behaved and delightful. In a way, it was hilarious that his little family wasn’t so sweet behind closed doors. I’ll spare you the unsettling details, but my Father was not such a nice man.</p><p align="center">❃</p><p>I’ll go back to yesterday, the 28th of August 1976. A few days before I had to go back to school for my sixth year. Believe it or not, I enjoy school more than home.</p><p>“Coming!” I yelled down the stairs to my mother, who had prepared our last meal before heading to London. I closed my bedroom door and ran straight into my little sister. She looked like she was about to throw up.</p><p>“What? You swallow a frog?” I grinned at her. When her expression didn’t change, I wrapped an arm around her “What’s up?”</p><p>“I’m scared, Mae.”</p><p>I gave her a tight squeeze “About what?”</p><p>That was an invitation enough for Goldie’s word vomit to spill from her lips, “What if people don’t like me? Think I’m weird or ugly or dumb? Or...or I can’t do anything in my classes right?</p><p>“Woah, calm down! You’ll be fine I promise, you’re not dumb or ugly.” I looked down at her grinning, “Maybe a bit weird.” She hit me in the stomach.</p><p>“Ow, I’m joking... how about if anyone says anything, you just...jinx them?” She giggles and looks back at me,</p><p dir="ltr">“But how am I going to live up to you?” she mumbled nervously. I laugh out loud at the question,</p><p dir="ltr">“What do you mean?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Well...you’re really cool and popular.”</p><p dir="ltr">I suppose, it was only Hufflepuff students that didn’t really like me. Not fans of sarcasm apparently. But being a pureblood whose family were prominently Ravenclaws, I’d have a conversation with pretty much anyone else. I come across like some sort of War Lord according to the Slytherin girls, my resting bitch face doesn’t help with that, but if you get to know me, I'm just a bit of a lunatic, to be honest.</p><p dir="ltr">“No, I’m not.” I smiled and rolled my eyes to reassure her, “but I’ll fight anyone who upsets you.” I raise my fists and punch her lightly in the stomach. She pouts in acceptance at what I’m saying and tugs on my hair,</p><p dir="ltr">“Can I dye my hair to look like yours?” No! Don’t ruin your hair.” Goldie’s hair was the complete opposite to mine, mine being shoulder-length and wavy platinum blonde inherited from my mother and hers straight, long and dark from my father.</p><p dir="ltr">“But it’s so prettyyy.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yours is prettierrr.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Maeve! Marigold! Come on, before your father is back!”</p><p dir="ltr" align="center">❃</p><p dir="ltr">As we entered the kitchen we were greeted by the smell of cinnamon, my mum rushing about in a floral patterned apron and another familiar face,</p><p dir="ltr">“Ren!” Marigold was already in the arms of our older brother, Soren. He grinned and ruffled her hair, “miss me kiddo?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Not particularly,” she quipped at him. He gently slapped her on the back of the head.</p><p dir="ltr">“Goldie, honey help me with dinner.” My mother called from the dining room, Marigold ran off leaving me with my brother. He produced a small box from behind his back.</p><p dir="ltr">“Happy 16th Mae, I’m sorry it’s four months late.” he smiled softly. “Forgiven.” I gave him a small smirk and took the box from his outstretched hand. I opened it to see a golden rose necklace with the flower painted red. On the bottom of the lid “You are my sunshine” was written. He always used to sing the song to me when I had nightmares.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s gorgeous, thanks, Ren.” I gave him a tight hug and he spun me around to clasp it around my neck. “How’s work going?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Good,” he laughed “Getting out of here made it more fun. Are you going to come down soon?”</p><p dir="ltr">My brother moved to London two years ago to work at the ministry, and to get away from Father. Oh, how jealous I am. Meaning he obviously didn’t want to come up north often. I miss him a lot, seeing as he’s the only person I've ever really had to talk to.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’d love to but you know father won’t let me.” I rolled my eyes, “I promise when I leave school though. How come you’re here anyway?” Realising my brother's visit wasn’t scheduled I stopped playing with the pretty necklace and focused back on his face.</p><p dir="ltr">“I came to see Goldie off.” he nodded towards the dining room, “how is she?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Scared. But I’m hoping she’ll be okay after she gets there.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, she’ll be alright. Let's hope she gets Ravenclaw.” I snorted at the situation</p><p dir="ltr">My brother and I were both sorted into Gryffindor, to the disappointment of my father. Our family was famous for our intelligence and charm, there hadn’t been anyone sorted into anything but Ravenclaw for as far back as my dad had memory. So when Soren was placed in Gryffindor, Father went off the rails. Just a tiny bit. Something about ‘tarnishing the legacy’. That was one of the main reasons my brother moved so far away so quickly.</p><p dir="ltr" align="center">❃</p><p dir="ltr">We managed to eat and wave Soren on his way before father got home. Luckily I was in my room when I heard the door slam. Heard him sweet-talking my mother in the kitchen. Heard him tell my sister not to worry about school and say good-night. And heard his footsteps stop outside my door.</p><p dir="ltr">“For gods sake, you haven’t even started packing.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes I-”</p><p dir="ltr">“Can you not do anything right? All I ask is this, so I can get you out of my house.” I stared at my feet, not really sure how to react to that. “Well? What are you waiting for?”</p><p dir="ltr">Sorry, Father. I’ll start now.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Good, and be quick, I’m sure that mudblood friend of yours will miss you very much if you’re late.” Sarcasm dripped from his voice and he gave me a disgustingly sweet smile and left without a glance back.</p><p dir="ltr">And so in the name of not angering him, I stayed up until I could barely see straight, before finally collapsing into bed.</p><p dir="ltr" align="center">❃</p><p dir="ltr">“Get your lazy arse up girl, if you can’t be bothered to get up you’re not going to school. I’ll keep you here ‘till the year is done.”</p><p dir="ltr">My eyes snap open, my body immediately flooded with fear. What happened last night? Why is he mad? What is he going to do to me? I looked around to figure I was lying on my bed in a huge pile of clothes and random items. I did say I stayed up late. Must have passed out completely.</p><p dir="ltr">I haven’t even started the year yet and I'm already sleep-deprived, great.</p><p dir="ltr">“You hear me girl?” I jump and scurry to pick up the miscellaneous items and cram them messily into my suitcase.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, Father.” Grab my wand and uniform.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hurry. Up.” he picks up a small, glass figurine of a dog my brother made me in his second year and crunches it up against the desk, before slamming the door. <em>What was the point in that?</em></p>
