  <u>April</u>
</p><p>“We’ve already been through this, Harry.”</p><p>“I’ll be turning sixteen in a few months,” Harry reminds him. “How does a few months make a difference?”</p><p>“It just does, Harry,” Sirius’s voice is gentle but firm. “I… I can’t allow you to do something you’ll regret.”</p><p>The younger man tilts his chin defiantly. “I’m not a child, Sirius.”</p><p>“I know that.”</p><p>“And I’m not going to change my mind.”</p><p>Sirius regards him with a fond smile. “Alright, Harry.” His words are indulgent but ultimately convey his doubt, causing Harry to prickle.</p><p>“I’m not going to,” Harry insists. “I <em>want</em> you, Sirius, and I know you want me too.”</p><p>Sirius’s attempts to be honourable falter somewhat as his gaze sweeps over Harry’s figure, and Harry spies a glimmer of the desire the other man is so desperately trying to hide. Harry inches closer, reducing the gap between them.</p><p>With a sigh the older man takes a step back, crossing his arms over his chest. “When you’re sixteen,” he says staunchly. “We’ll talk about it again when you’re sixteen.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>Harry stares at the ceiling of his Privet Drive bedroom, his eyes vacant, barely blinking.                                                                                                                             </p><p>“I’m sixteen now, Sirius,” he whispers into the darkness, his voice choked with tears.</p>
