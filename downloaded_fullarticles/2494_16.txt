    <p>It's an average day, then again why wouldn't it be? You lay in the grass below an old oak tree, it's shadows peppered all over you and the surrounding ground. A rush of leaves falls down to you from an offending branch high above you. <br/>A cat sits upon this branch, a smug kind of smile on the little rascals furry face.<br/>The cat was long, large and hairy and pretty every way. Grey eye glinting in the light.<br/>Suddenly the area that is and around the cat blurred, replacing the cat and know plopping down to the ground with a heavy thud is a young boy, younger then you by a month or two. Grey eyes now rimed with dark blue glasses peer over at you. Even now he is still somewhat cat-like.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>You move an arm under you, propping it so you can see him better. What is he up to?</p><p>"got a feeling"</p><p>"And"</p><p>"Don't think it's bad, at least not yet"</p><p>You regard him quizzically. He's had feelings before.... and he's not typically wrong either</p><p>"Right"</p><p>You sit up with a start, screeching, you friend falling to the side as a large and rather grumpy owl swoops in.</p><p>"The hell is happening?!"</p><p>Your replied with a) a large owl sitting on your now flattened friend and b) said flattened friend.</p><p>The latter of course is disregarded when you see the letter in its beak and the crest stamped on it.</p>
