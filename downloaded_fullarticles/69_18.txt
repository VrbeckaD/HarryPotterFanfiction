    <p>To any outside observer, Severus Snape’s blank mask conveyed nothing but a placid calm. It was with no small amount of trepidation, however, that he found himself in the booth of an all-night muggle diner, seated across from none other than his former student, Ginny Weasley. She was perched on the very edge of the booth, her feet tucked beneath her and her bare legs sticking to the cracked vinyl. She was wearing a dark green tank top, black shorts, and a pair of heavy, battered hiking boots. She carried a rucksack in place of a purse, and her Weasley-red hair was pulled back into a tangled ponytail.</p><p>She had the tail end of a fearsome sunburn; her fair skin was freckled and still peeling across her nose and shoulders, and her hands and fingernails were grubby. She was peppered with small, thin cuts, dirty and scabbing. It was 15 after 2 AM, and she was sprawled across the booth sipping a steaming mug of black coffee, her relaxed posture at odds with her hard gaze. The look was familiar- he had taught the lot of the Weasley clan, had seven years to quietly observe the personalities and behaviors of each of the brood. He was used to poorly concealed dislike being leveled at him from the entire succession of Weasleys. But her muted frown and furrowed brow were a far cry from the raw fury she had directed at him the last time they stood face to face.</p><p>**************************************************************************************************************************************************************</p><p>The door to his (Dumbledore’s) office was thrown open and Amycus Carrow strode through, clutching Longbottom by the throat with one hand and hauling a thrashing Ginny Weasley along behind them with the other. The boy, still shaking from the Cruciatus curse, was thrown to the floor in front of the polished oak desk; the girl was shoved roughly through the door after him. Carrow’s face was sporting a bloody lip and a large purple bruise beneath his left eye, and his robes bore straight, thin rips which exposed raw welts on the flesh beneath. He was in a frothing temper, a cruel smile on his face as he trained his wand on the girl, who was now standing over Longbottom, one foot planted on either side of his prone form.</p><p>Before he could utter a curse, however, there was a rumbling sound, and a burst of flame shaped, oddly, like a some sort of goat came thundering up the corridor and through the office door. Carrow pitched himself to the side just in time to avoid being hit full in the back by the flames. The ram cantered around the room, catching the rug aflame, and lowered his head as though to charge, before flickering out of existence. Severus wondered, belatedly, what sort of spell had produced the creature. It was like nothing he had ever seen. Somewhere out in the hall, an explosion sounded.</p><p>“Leave them to me,” Severus commanded, jolted from his musing. “Find the individual responsible for that…disruption, and bring them to me as well.”</p><p>Carrow gritted his teeth, loath to be deprived of his retribution, but at the sound of a second, larger explosion, he turned on his heel and stormed from the room. Severus turned to gaze at the wayward pair before him. Longbottom lay face down on the floor, Weasley still standing above him. He strode forward, hands behind his back, staring at the girl. She straightened, lifted her chin, and met his gaze, blue eyes blazing, a sneer twisting her face. She was wandless, defenseless, and she knew it, but, like a cornered animal, she was fearless in her resignation. He wondered if she was responsible for Carrow’s bruises. He wondered what she would do if he were to draw his wand and continue Carrow’s ministrations. Would she attack him with her bare hands at the sound of Longbottom’s screaming? She was fully aware that he could kill her. Would she throw her life away to spare the boy a few moments of suffering? How pathetic. The girl was prepared to die looking him in the eyes, and her bravado wouldn’t even spare her friend. How like a pair of Gryffindors.</p><p>A Slytherin would have kept a low profile, waited, sussed out the opponent’s weakness and waited for an opportune moment to rise up. A Slytherin would have never charged into danger until victory was guaranteed. He held the Weasley girl’s eyes, drew his wand and immobilized her with a lazy flick. He knelt before Longbottom, gripping the collar of his robe and flipping him over. His face was a swollen mass of purple, his mouth a bloody smear. Severus frowned. A third explosion sounded from the grounds below, strong enough that he felt it through the thick stone walls. Outside his window, he could see the flaming creature charging across the grounds after someone. He sighed. Wordlessly, he released the girl.</p><p>“Miss Weasley. You will escort Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. After he has been seen, the two of you will report to Mr. Filch. I believe he will appreciate your assistance polishing the scorch marks from the castle walls.”</p><p>He turned on his heel and strode across the room to retrieve his cloak. It looked as though he would need to rescue Carrow from whatever it was that was on fire and chasing him. He could feel the girl’s gaze burning into his back as she heaved Longbottom up and staggered through the door and down the corridor toward the infirmary.</p><p>**************************************************************************************************************************************************************</p><p>The memory unsettled Severus, reminding him that he had never interacted with Ginny Weasley outside the context of a teacher-student relationship. When he had caught sight of her, sitting tucked into a corner booth picking at the crust of her toast, his surprise had overridden his caution and he had strode over to slip into the seat across from her. Now that he was here, he realized he had not planned an explanation for his sudden presence. She looked at him and wordlessly conjured him a mug, filling it from a metal carafe on the edge of the table. He looked around the empty diner, but the only other occupants were the waitress and the line cook, both deeply engaged in what looked to be a game of double solitaire. He picked up his mug and inclined his head in thanks.</p><p>She had been at his trial, along with the rest of the Gryffindor war heroes. He had sat, bound at the wrists and ankles, in a straight, hard-backed chair, before the full Wizengamot. He hadn’t expected any measure of leniency. Hell, he hadn’t even expected to be alive.</p><p>**************************************************************************************************************************************************************</p><p>Naturally, it was damned Potter and his damned mangy godfather he had to thank for that. He had been ready to die, on the dusty floor of the Shrieking Shack. He had known he would die. All he wanted to do was live long enough to see his memories safely into Potter’s hands, to fulfill his oath to Lily and embrace whatever fate awaited him beyond death. But Potter, instead of getting on with his task, had run for his godfather, and he had been dragged from unconsciousness by Sirius Black cutting open the twin punctures and sucking the venom from the wounds.</p><p>He had woken up in the crowded Hogwarts infirmary, and was told by a harried-looking Madam Pomfrey that he should have died; the venom had gone too far. But Black had bastardized the rune for the dissolution of a union, carved it into the skin of his neck with a silver knife, and forced the unstable rune to part the venom from his blood. The magic used to vanish the venom had been so desperate and complex that Madam Pomfrey remained in shock that Black hadn’t accidentally vanished all the blood from his body.</p><p>At first, he had been angry. He could have died a hero’s death, passed into oblivion regarded as a martyr. He knew that Potter’s overbearing sense of justice would have ensured his post-mortem absolution. Now, he would be dragged through the courts, at the mercy of the Wizengamot. All the cruelty he had allowed to play out before him and all the cruelty he, himself, had committed- he would be judged for it. By the court, by the whole of wizarding Britain. Even if he escaped the law somehow, everyone would know what he was. He bore the proof on his arm. He was angry- Black and his friends had stolen the peace of his youth, once. Now Black had stolen the peace of his death. His part had played out. He was unnecessary now. Why drag him back to a life that no longer held a shape or purpose?</p><p>As he looked out at the crowded ward, the bodies looked so small. It was clear that many of the underage students had snuck back to fight. He saw children among the injured, and he saw that some of them were no longer children, but bodies, surrounded by other grieving, wounded children. Children he knew. He had never cared for children, and he knew he was not well-suited to the task of teaching, but sometimes his students would surprise him, and he would be filled with a quiet pride in spite of himself. These were children he had watched grow up. That thought made something twist in his chest.</p><p>He saw Black then, scrambling from bedside to bedside, barking orders to a pair of St. Mungo’s junior healers. He was bleeding heavily from his own injuries; the exhaustion in his posture was poorly concealed, and it was obvious that he was forcing himself to stay upright. He ran past Severus’ bedside, and Severus flung back the bedsheet and stumbled after him.</p><p>Dennis Creevy was lying prone on the floor, clutching the limp form of his blood-soaked older brother. Black was on his knees, frantically muttering <em>prohibere crueti, </em>the countercurse to an anti-coagulating hex, and holding the boy’s pale hand, a look of hellbent protectiveness on his face. Severus seized Black by the collar and jerked him aside roughly, flicking his own countercurse straight at Colin Creevey’s chest, and the snarl of anger on Black’s face died instantly at the sight of the boy’s wounds, which immediately stopped bleeding and began scabbing over.</p><p>“It was one of Dolohov’s,” Severus snapped at Black, who was pushing himself to his feet. “He liked to watch people bleed. He designed the spell not to break under any variation of <em>prohibere cruenti. </em>The boy would have bled to death before you figured out how to break the curse.<em>” </em></p><p>Dennis Creevey was staring up at him in watery-eyed wonder. He broke his gaze, turned on his heel, and began to storm away when Black reached out and grabbed his arm. A flash of anger gripped him, and he recoiled at the touch.</p><p>“Snape, I… thank you,” Black said, looking solemn.</p><p> “I am recovered sufficiently to assist in brewing,” Snape replied flatly. “You appear to have run out of blood-replenishing potion almost entirely.”</p><p>He walked away before Black could reply.</p><p>Severus found the cauldrons being manned by Remus Lupin, who was covered in so much gore he would have been unidentifiable beneath it, were it not for the fact that he was wearing the same fraying jumper he had worn for all the seven years he was at Hogwarts. He was stirring one cauldron with his wand and another with what looked like it might once have been some kind of sword and cursing prolifically at something that was boiling over behind him.</p><p>Severus stepped in wordlessly and settled the roiling cauldron, a nearly-burnt burn salve, which he salvaged by adding additional frog spawn and a dollop of aloe.</p><p>“LUPIN!” he barked, and Lupin jumped, splashing his boiling potion over the side of his cauldron.</p><p>“Severus! Thank God! Do you know a spell to extract Essence of Murtlap? We’re out of everything but the Murtlap leaves, and we haven’t the time to press them and steam them-”</p><p>Severus flicked his wand at a massive heap of heather-gray leaves in a large stone basin, and they began to sweat their milky-gray essence into the bottom of the bowl.</p><p>“Lupin! Just what do you think you’re doing! Is that supposed to be an anti-venin? Anti-venins must all be stirred with a silver rod!”</p><p>“Well I can’t very well touch a silver rod, can I Severus?” Lupin snapped.</p><p>“What the hell are you stirring it with, then? If it contains aluminum or tin, it can-”</p><p>“It’s a lance. Sir Cadogan won it off one of the suits of armor in a duel, and-”</p><p>Severus snatched the lance from Lupin and examined it critically.</p><p>“Sir Cadogan? That mad portrait?” he asked. “How did a portrait…actually, no...I’m sure I don’t want to know. Anyway, you’re in luck, as this lance looks to have been forged well before aluminum or tin were widely used. Anything but silver reduces the potency, however. You will need to administer the anti-venin at-”</p><p>“One and one-third times the standard dosage to maintain potency, I know,” Lupin said, cutting him off. “Poppy told me. Can you take a look at this blood-replenisher? I’m not sure I added the goat spleen at the correct step.”</p><p>Severus pushed Lupin gently to the side and began muttering an incantation over the steaming cauldron. Within minutes, the potion was glowing the correct shade of amber, and he had three more cauldronfuls bubbling along beside it.</p><p>Just as he dared to breathe a sigh of relief, he heard screaming, and Lupin sprinted away to pull a tourniquet around the stump of Marcus Flint’s leg. He was not surprised to see the boy fighting. The Flints had been quietly working against the Dark Lord ever since their oldest son was killed in his service. He was a bit more surprised to see that Flint's head was being cradled against Oliver Wood's shoulder. He hadn't seen that one coming. 

</p><p>He didn’t catch sight of Lupin again until Molly Weasley turned up and ordered him to go find something to eat while she watched his cauldrons. When he found Lupin, the man was holding a sobbing Parvati Patil, as both of them stood over a body so mangled, he couldn’t recognize it. He turned away and ran into Black, who tipped a shot of strengthening solution into a steaming cup of tea and pressed it into his hands wordlessly before jogging over to Angelina Johnson, who was being carried on piggyback by Katie Bell. Moments later, he saw the back of Black, sprinting after a stricken-looking Lee Jordan. He caught sight of Poppy, who was attempting to <em>rennervate </em>Susan Bones from a <em>cruciatus-</em>induced seizure, and she set him to work brewing the strongest anti-convulsant he could muster.</p><p>By the time the last patient had been stabilized, night had fallen and passed, and the sun was just breaking over the clouds. He had been up, at this point, for 48 hours straight, and when Black flopped down beside him on Poppy’s narrow couch and sagged against him, he accepted it without animosity.</p><p>Colin Creevy had lived. Marcus Flint had lived. Angelina Johnson had lived. Susan Bones had lived. Fred Weasley, who, Black told him tiredly, had been crushed beneath an explosion of stone rubble, and whose shattered ribs had punctured his lungs, had somehow, miraculously, lived. Lupin came over, threw his arms around Black and gasped “she made it, she’s going to be OK, she’s going to be OK” against the dirty fabric of Black’s shirt. Whoever <em>she</em> was had lived.</p><p>But they still weren’t safe. Too many of the Dark Lord’s servants had escaped. They may have lived, but they still weren’t safe. The decision struck him at that moment. He would not allow any more evil to fall upon those children. He took up the mantle of double-agent out of obligation to Lily, determined to protect her son as he had not been able to protect her. To the same end, he allowed himself to be a pawn in Dumbledore’s long game. But this burden, he chose for himself. He would hunt down every remaining Death Eater, and every dark wizard that followed, until no more children were dragged into shadows.</p><p>**************************************************************************************************************************************************************</p><p>And here he was, three years later, scraping a pat of butter across a slice of toast in a diner booth across from Ginny Weasley, whose presence here, he knew, could not possibly be a coincidence. The village of Sway was both the site of a documented Death Eater cell and the last known location of Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley. Their disappearance was classified to all but the highest levels of Ministry intelligence, and though a missing-persons case was under Auror jurisdiction, the Chief had pulled him off his previous assignment and asked him to discreetly investigate.</p><p>
  <em>It figures it would be Potter. It’s always Potter. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ugh.</em>
</p><p>The thought of it made him sick. Potter and Weasley, with their celebrity status, had run off and joined the Aurors without even sitting their NEWTS, and knowing the high standards at the Ministry, Shacklebolt probably sent them chasing after Death Eaters without even completing training, and they had gotten themselves captured. And, in true Ministry fashion, the Auror office seemed to be unable to find hide nor hair of them. They were having a right job of it, keeping it out of the papers. Every Auror in the DMLE was pulling overtime looking for them.</p><p>
  <em>How do you manage to lose two entire human beings? God. What a circus.</em>
</p><p>The Unthinkables, at least, operated almost entirely outside the sphere of Ministry influence. They had only the Chief to answer to. He stifled a sigh. Were it not for the fact that the Chief had no idea who he was, he might have thought it some kind of sick joke, being sent after Potter. Again.</p><p>
  <em>Fate, then. Some sick twist of fate.</em>
</p><p>He bit into his toast and studied Ginny Weasley. She was buttering her own slice and maintaining her silence.</p><p>He knew perfectly well what happened to the missing boys- they had gotten in over their heads on an Auror assignment and gotten themselves captured. He was sure of it. What was more interesting was how Ginny Weasley had come about the location of their disappearance. That information was highly classified…sure, she had a few schoolmates in the Auror force, but none of the junior Aurors would have been privy to classified files. Granger might have been able to get access…she had joined the Unspeakables and advanced in rank rather quickly…but the last he’d heard, Granger worked in the Time Room…she would have had a hard time justifying access to Auror case files that had nothing to do with her research.</p><p>Granger always had been infuriatingly meddlesome, but…would Granger leak classified Ministry intelligence? And if it wasn’t Granger, it had to be someone else with a high-level security clearance. There was a leak in the Ministry somewhere, and he needed to figure out the source. Ginny Weasley, war hero or not, was an untrained civilian and had no business poking around near a Death Eater cell. Surely Granger would have the sense to know that passing that information to someone as brash as Weasley would do nothing but endanger her. Then again, there was no guarantee the leak had come from a benign source…Weasley could be walking into a trap at this very moment.</p>
