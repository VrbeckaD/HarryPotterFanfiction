    <p>Harry Potter sat with Ron Weasley, sipping brightly coloured punch as they watched the other people dance, it was the Yule Ball, and Harry and Ron’s partner’s had swiftly left them. Harry, in all honesty, was perfectly fine with that, he didn’t enjoy dancing much. There had been a couple slow songs so far, Hermione had danced a couple of them with Viktor Krum. Harry could tell Ron wasn’t particularly happy with that, he didn’t bring it up though, he was in no mood for talking. As they sat together sipping their punch Draco sodding Malfoy just casually walked up to him as if they weren’t enemies.</p><p>“Hello, Malfoy.” Harry was sceptical, and his voice showed it. It was not said with an entirely friendly voice either, in fact, quite the opposite.</p><p>“Potter.” Malfoy nodded as he said the name, acknowledging Harry as if he had come to him and not the other way around. He said it with a flat voice, serious and controlled. Harry was fairly surprised, it didn’t have that bitter ring to it that Malfoy usually added. </p><p>“May I have this dance?” Malfoys voice was humourless and unwavering. He offered his hand to Harry, who almost laughed until he realised Malfoy was not joking.</p><p>“You… You must be joking.” Harry spluttered, too stunned to speak properly.</p><p>“I don’t joke.” Malfoy’s face was a steady blank mask, he showed no emotion. His hand was still outstretched. He stood tall and confident. His blond was hair slicked back, although that wasn’t unusual. Harry stared at him, mouth open like a gaping fish. His mind raced, trying to figure out what game or trick Malfoy was trying to pull on him, but none of it made sense. What was he up to?</p><p>“Well don't just sit there staring, is that a yes or a no?” Malfoy paused for a second before continuing. “It's a shame, I should have figured the chosen one would be too scared of a dance.”</p><p>Ron, who was still sat next to Harry and mirrored his face of shock, choked on his drink of punch. Harry meanwhile was not ready to lose to another of Malfoy’s silly games. He stood up quickly, almost spilling the drink he held. He didn’t like how close the other boy was, however, he tried to not let it show. He would beat Malfoy at his own game. This thought sounded better in his head as he was swiftly remembered his lack of dancing skills as Draco took his hand, leading him towards the crowd. A few heads turned in their direction, it made Harry’s skin crawl. What was he doing? Dancing with a Malfoy? This would be a disaster.</p><p>Malfoy led him back further into the crowd of dancers, who were quickly parting, some even stopped dancing and went to the sides. Oh no. Within a couple of minutes, all the dancers had disappeared off to the sides. Harry caught Hermione's eye who was looking at him with utter shock and confusion. Thinking about it, he would have the same expression if he suddenly saw her take to the dance floor with Malfoy. Speaking of, the two boys were now standing rather awkwardly in the middle of the dance floor, with everyone observing. Harry violently brought his hand away from Malfoy’s as he realised he was no longer being dragged around. How had he got into this predicament?</p><p>His train of thought was abruptly stopped short as the upbeat music suddenly cut out. All was quiet as everyone watched the pair. Harry, was now regretting everything, he’d rather be embarrassed by losing to Malfoy then having to dance with the git.</p><p>Quietly at first, music started to play. It was a slow classic song. Harry would have to slow dance... With Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. The realisation of the situation hit him like a brick to his stomach. He paused, he couldn’t do this. Not with Malfoy. But that would be admitting defeat, he wouldn’t let Malfoy win this.</p><p>Harry panicked, where should he put his hands again? Malfoy noticed this and took his hand, bringing one up to his shoulder and the other at his waist. Harry froze. Nope, this is not happening. Out of shock, he sprung backwards, nearly losing his balance, however not quite. Malfoy tilted his head, giving him a very unimpressed look. Harry would have to up his game if he was going to beat Malfoy. </p><p>Harry took a couple steps forward and put his hands back where Malfoy had instructed, trying not to flinch as Malfoy started to lead him to the music. Everything about this felt awful and wrong to Harry. He struggled to not let it show, although it was a fairly weak attempt considering how uncomfortable he felt. Harry tried at first to not look at his feet, but after nearly tripping over for the third humiliating time, he gave up. Now that he let himself glance at his feet, he felt much better and managed not to trip too severely. Looking back up at Malfoy, he still looked fairly unimpressed and smirked as their eyes locked onto each other. Harry turned his head away within a second, he did not need to look at Malfoy for this, even if it meant weakening the win he was aiming to get. Harry's gut squirmed as he briefly looked at the crowd of people silently watching in shock. How on earth was he going to explain this?</p><p>The song dragged on, the torture continued for much longer than Harry wanted. After another painful minute, the song was clearly coming to an end, and Harry hadn’t felt so thankful for a long time. Harry looked at Malfoy again. He was wearing that all too familiar smirk, he looked as if he couldn’t believe Harry hadn’t run away. However tempting that actually was, he wouldn’t let the stupid bloody git have the satisfaction.</p><p>The instant the song was over, he took a large step back from Malfoy. Glaring daggers at him, Harry spun around and speed walked to the door, gesturing for Ron and Hermione to follow. They did without hesitation and the golden trio left the room. They walked in silence, Ron and Hermione kept a few steps behind Harry. He didn’t care though, his mind was elsewhere, trying to figure out what on earth Malfoy was trying to do. Was it to embarrass him? That certainly worked. But wouldn’t that reflect badly on him as well? Surely the other Slytherins wouldn’t approve? Unless they were in on the dumb plan Malfoy had. Although, when Harry had seen the crowd, all of them looked shocked, disgusted or something similar to that. He hadn’t got a good look, but he was fairly sure he hadn’t seen any of the Slytherins looking as devious as normal. This was puzzling to Harry, to say the least, and he swore he wouldn’t let Malfoy get away with whatever he was doing.</p><p>Harry was done with Malfoy’s games, he had to plan his revenge.</p>
