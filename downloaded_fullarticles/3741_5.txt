Lily arches an eyebrow, poking the toast suspiciously with a tea spoon.</p><p><br/> "its a portrait of you Evans! To show you I care!"</p><p><br/> "Well, we finally found something house elves aren't good at; drawing." she said, frowning at the messy overall picture that's supposedly based on her.</p><p><br/> Sirius was laughing so hard he was holding onto his side painfully.</p><p><br/> "I made it Evans." James admitted, embarrassed.</p><p><br/> "Pardon?" She asked, tearing her eyes from the toast; she was transfixed - it was so bad.</p><p><br/> "I made it Evans."</p><p><br/> "You made what?"</p><p><br/> "The toast. I made it. Evans."</p><p><br/> Peter and Remus were snorting into their breakfast.</p><p><br/> Mary leaned over Lily's shoulder to see it herself. "Looks like angry dung."</p><p><br/> Sirius was chuckling smugly, happy tears running down his face.</p><p><br/> "You think I look like angry dung Potter?"</p><p><br/> "I - No!" James stuttered, angry. "It's art Evans! You don't know anything!"</p><p><br/> Lily starts getting angry. "Oh i don't know anything do I?! Fine, you arrogant toerag!" and she marched away, making her way to classes.</p><p><br/> James is left behind, blushing scarlet with disbelief - it wasn't supposed to go this way.</p><p><br/> "I ever tell you how shite you are at flirting Prongs?" Sirius asked lightly.</p><p><br/> "Everyday Padfoot." Remus told him, drinking tea like it was any other day.</p><p><br/> "Everyday." Peter confirmed.</p><p><br/> "Prongs, you're shite at flirting."</p><p><br/> James gave his three friends the third finger and made his way dejectedly to classes.</p><p><br/> Sirius called after him "At this rate it'll take you all seven years to get her to say yes!"</p><p> </p><p>The End</p></div>
