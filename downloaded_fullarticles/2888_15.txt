    <b>Trouble in Paradise</b>
  </p>
</center>Harry stared at the picture on the front page of the society section of the Prophet.<p>Krum.</p><p>Victor Krum, his old acquaintance from the Tri-Wizard Tournament had been seen attending a museum opening with none other than Harry’s old rival from school – Draco Malfoy. The blond – if it was possible – had gotten more beautiful than ever and was now frequently being seen on the arm of the Quidditch star.</p><p>Harry shrugged his shoulders and finished his breakfast. Krum would likely move on in a week or two as had happened with his last few boy-toys and then maybe Harry would try talking to Draco at work. If they could just talk, they could try being friends and then maybe he could persuade Draco to even give him a date or two. He decided to wait and see what happened.</p><p>The next time Harry saw Draco at the ministry, the blond was sporting new clothes as well as a flashy new watch. Harry said 'hello' but all he got was a quick wave of acknowledgement before Draco hurried away on some errand. Disappointment flooded his whole being but he sighed softly before getting back to work. The brunette was sure that Draco was just very busy that day and he'd certainly have time for a real conversation later.</p><p>It never happened.</p><p>They smiled at each other from across rooms but Draco never approached Harry and Harry let it stand.</p>

About a month later, Harry was leaving his cubicle for the night when Ron called him over.
</p><p>
“Harry, listen…I sort of forgot to say it this morning…” Ron scratched the back of his head awkwardly. “We can’t meet up tonight. Mione’s friend invited us out for dinner and…well tonight’s the only night he and his partner are free so…”
</p><p>
Harry blinked. His best friends were canceling on him? That never happened. Unwilling to give up time with his best mates, Harry shook his head. “Wait so…what other day can we get together, then?"
</p><p>
“Uhm, if I remember rightly Mione’s got a roast defrosting for tomorrow night if you want to join us… It’s big enough to feed the whole clan so I think we can spare the small portion that fills your belly.” Ron’s face lit up as he realized Harry wasn’t going to make this difficult.
</p><p>
  Harry’s playful glare acknowledged the redhead’s joking dig. “I’ll just get a bite at the pub before heading home and see you both tomorrow then.”
</p><p>
“See you then, mate.” Ron waved as Harry walked over to the lifts.
</p><p>
  He did exactly as he’d told Ron and Apparated to his favorite pub. Once seated, he ordered a meal and drink. His belly was soon full so he left a good amount of galleons on the table before asking to use the floo.
</p><p>
Harry fell asleep quickly after his head hit the pillow but the next morning, as Harry ate the last bite of his breakfast a post owl brought the paper... A large photo on the second page of the Prophet showed a picture of his best friends but they weren’t alone… Ron and Hermione were in fact sliding into a restaurant booth across from Draco Malfoy and Viktor Krum.
</p><p>
Harry could do nothing but stare at the page for almost five whole minutes and that’s how the pair found him.
</p><p>
“Harry? You here?” Hermione called from the floo room.
</p><p>
Ron came through and looked around before waving his wand. “<i>Homenum Revelio</i>. He’s here somewhere, Mione. Come through.” He checked the hallway and peeked into the sitting room before she reached his side. “Do you think he saw the prophet yet?” He asked as they moved toward the kitchen.
</p><p>
Hermione opened the door into the dining room and as her eyes settled on the brunette, she knew he had. “Harry?”
</p><p>
The brunette blinked upon hearing his name and glared at the couple. “You blew me off to see Krum? Krum and Malfoy? Of all people!”
</p><p>
“Viktor is a good friend of mine Harry. We lost touch for a short while during the war, but he was at Bill and Fleur’s wedding and she’s just given me his new contact information so we’ve reconnected.” Hermione told him sharply. “Now that he’s dating Malfoy, he’s decided that we should occasionally double date. Last night was lovely and Malfoy was very different…He was quiet and polite.”
</p><p>
“I work with him, Mione! I know he’s quiet...” Harry sighed and looked back at the picture. “But he’s also snarky and full of sass and… beautiful.”
</p><p>
Ron’s eyes bugged out at his best friend. “Beautiful? The Great Blond Git?”
</p><p>
“Ron!?” Hermione gasped. “You’re not helping! Harry?”
</p><p>
“Yes – Alright! I might have developed a tiny crush...” Harry blushed a little. He’d broken up with Ginny quite a long time ago now and while traveling the British isles he’d discovered that he was gay. Luckily he’d told them when he’d returned from his trip or this would’ve shocked them to the core.
</p><p>
“On Malfoy?” Ron’s face was twisted into a combination of surprise and disbelief.
</p><p>
Harry chuckled uncomfortably and scratched his neck. “Well, blonds are definitely my type, you see and...Damn if he isn’t the hottest blond male I know of.”
</p><p>
“Oh, Harry...” Hermione suddenly bit her lip. “Well...just as long as you don’t make any overtures of a romantic nature, Harry...at least until they break up.”
</p><p>
“Yeah, mate...You know you might not have long to wait!” Ron slapped Harry’s arm jokingly. “Malfoy isn’t the type to hang around with one guy for long!”
</p><p>
“Ron!” Hermione sighed. “Truly though, Harry, Viktor is a very jealous type of man. Do you know, he yelled at the waitress last night because she was speaking to Draco for just a little too long and she was only informing him of the bathroom’s location? Not to mention that he knows Draco would never be interested in a woman.”
</p><p>
Harry cringed. “No of course not... When we competed for the tournament, he was quite skilled and I’d hate to make an enemy out of him. Oh well, I suppose I’ll just have to settle for friendship.”
</p><p>
“The roast is almost ready, Harry. Come to ours and eat.” Hermione coaxed.
</p><p>
“But I only just ate breakfast.” He frowned at them and then his stomach growled. “How bloody long was I sitting there?”
</p><p>
Ron called Kreacher and asked the elf.
</p><p>
“Master didn’t respond when Kreacher cleaned the table around him. Was Kreacher supposed to disturb his master’s thoughts?” Kreacher asked the redheaded blood traitor before popping back to his assigned tasks.
</p><p>
Hermione pointed to the clock. “It’s almost four, Harry! You’ve been staring at the paper all day. Get dressed and come for dinner. You just need to relax.”
</p><p>
Harry did as he was told but remained distant and distracted for the few hours before bedtime. After that strange day, Harry unconsciously began to watch Draco a little more often...The blond smiled but they didn’t always reach his eyes and lasted only fleeting seconds. Harry wondered why but didn’t endeavor to ask because he didn’t want to see that sweet smile disappear

Harry entered the lift on his way to begin another workday and was pushed into the other occupants. One was a particular blond that was looking rather sardonically at him.</p><p>“Good morning, Potter.” Draco said with a cautious smirk. Having observed that Potter had been entirely civil in the months that they’d shared a workspace, Draco made the impulsive decision to return the favor one day when it wouldn’t interrupt his routine to do so.</p><p>Harry blinked in surprise. “G-good m-morning, Mal-Dr-Malfoy!”</p><p>The blond’s lips twitched in obvious amusement. “Ever the articulate speaker, eh Potter?”</p><p>Harry’s eyes narrowed at the other man even as his face flushed with color. “You should say ‘hello’ more often if you don’t want to shock me speechless.”</p><p>“I don’t socialize much anymore.” Draco’s smirk melted into a wistful grin. “But when you wave at the end of a long day I always tell myself that I should at least say…<i> something</i>. A wave can have so many meanings after all… Perhaps your wave was simply an attempt at civility.”</p><p>“In this case…” Harry relaxed into an easy calm as he spoke the next few words in a hopeful tone. “It was an attempt to begin a friendship…”</p><p>“I don’t know, Potter…” Draco bit his lip and looked at the floor but soon lifted his gaze up through his long lovely lashes to Harry’s face. “I tried that once.”</p><p>“And I justifiably turned you down, but this is different.” Harry’s soft tone didn’t diminish the amount of determination in his words. “Our differences are sorted and the war is over… We are both changed men. I think it could work…Won’t you give it a chance?”</p><p>“Friendship…with Harry Potter.” Draco chuckled sounding suspiciously relieved. “You know that’s what Granger…” The blond’s voice broke off suddenly and his already pale face turned ashen. “<i>Hermione</i>!” Draco snapped not looking at Harry. “That’s what <i>Hermione</i> said the last time we spoke.”</p><p>Harry wasn’t an auror for nothing. He noted Draco’s behavior and frowned but said nothing as the blond went on speaking nervously.</p><p>“<i>Hermione</i> said you’d forgiven me and hoped to become friends for once.” Draco seemed to gain color back into his face each time he spoke Hermione’s name. “Weasley...” Draco flinched but it was barely detectable. “<i>R-Ron</i> also said it though, so I was a mite suspicious.”</p><p>Harry got a bad feeling as he observed his new friend, but maybe it was nothing to do with their current conversation. Perhaps Draco was nervous about something else. “So, would you like to join me and Ron for lunch?”</p><p>“Well, Viktor says that it’s healthier if I make my own lunch and bring it into the office.” Draco shrugged. “It also saves money so I usually only go out once a week and that was yesterday.”</p><p>“Oh.” Harry was momentarily surprised that Draco would allow his partner to dictate such things to him but he figured it was probably a suggestion that had been taken too seriously by the blond. “Ok, how about next week then?”</p><p>“I’d really like that, Potter.” Dracos grey eyes shone with happiness as the lift finally reached their floor. “I’ll see you later.”</p><p>“Can you call me Harry when you do...see me later that is?” Harry asked teasingly.</p><p>Draco didn’t answer with words but his smirk said it all.</p>

</center>The week got exceedingly busy and there was no time for socializing amongst the aurors or support staff until the following Monday.<p>Harry looked and looked for Draco but only when lunchtime arrived did the blond make an appearance. He and Ron were heading into Muggle London for their midday meal when Harry saw a flash of platinum hair and shouted while waving his arm to draw his attention. “Draco!”</p><p>Draco seemed to hesitate a moment before making his way across the crowded atrium. When he reached Harry and Ron he shook their hands. “Hello, Potter...W-Ron.”</p><p>Again Harry noticed a slight flinch but he restrained his impulse to pry.</p><p>Ron nodded politely at the blond. “Nice to see you, Mal-Draco.”</p><p>Harry pretended to pout. “I thought you were going to call me ‘Harry’ this time...”</p><p>“I never said that...did I?” A smirk appeared on the blond’s face. “Sorry, Harry...Old habits, you know?”</p><p>Harry’s green eyes sparkled as the words sounded in his ears. “That’s better. Friends shouldn’t use last names.” Harry smiled at the other man. “How’ve you been? How are things with Viktor?”</p><p>Draco’s smirk dimmed for a brief moment before he answered. “Not bad, actually. He’s playing great - Oh, Ron, he told me to invite you and Hermione to his next game. He said I should invite you too Harry...because I told him we’ve been speaking.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes widened. “Well, I hope you told him I want to catch up with you both sometime. He was good competition in the tournament and I never held it against him that he was unable to throw off the Imperius curse.”</p><p>“He’s always saying that he wishes he knew you better. He saw how you flew against that dragon and I think he’d love to fly against you.” Draco bit his lip. “Maybe you can get him to play a Seekers’ game someday. Will you join us for the game?”</p><p>“Sure. It sounds like fun.” Harry nodded and gave Draco his floo address. “Are you joining us for lunch?”</p><p>The blond nodded. “Yes, I’d like that. Where are we going?”</p><p>Ron told Draco about the little Muggle cafe that his in-laws recommended they try. “It’s really amazing food, Draco. I’m sure you’ll like it.”</p><p>“Do they have salads?” Draco asked. “I’d love a good chicken Caesar salad.”</p><p>“They’ve got great salads.” Harry grinned as he led the way to the exit.</p><p>Draco followed the other two men and allowed himself to relax in the company of his new friends. He blushed when Harry held the door open for him and again when the brunette helped him with his chair.</p><p>The waitress came quickly to take their orders. Ron was first and he asked for fish and chips while Harry ordered a steak and kidney pie.  “Would you like some garlic bread or crackers with your salad?”</p><p>Draco seemed to consider it a little too long and he looked disappointed as he turned down the offer with a pat to his abdomen. “No thank you...I’m watching my figure.”</p><p>Harry frowned, looking the blond’s lean body over appreciatively. “You’re kidding, right? You don’t need to lose a single ounce.”</p><p>“Thanks, Harry...really... but Viktor says I need to tone up a bit and I agree with him. I’m not getting any younger, you know.” Draco sighed and rolled up his sleeves to prepare for the meal.</p><p>“Is that a bruise on your arm?” Harry asked softly reaching out to brush the area lightly. The bad feeling he’d gotten last week was rapidly intensifying.</p><p>“Oh, yes...well...” Draco paused with a wince as Harry touched the darkened skin. “Viktor and I were out flying the other day and I fell.”</p><p>Harry shook his head allowing the bad feeling to dissipate. That was a likely explanation.</p><p>“Looks like a hand.” Ron observed with a frown.</p><p>The blond flicked his gaze to the right side, not meeting their eyes. “Well, Viktor tried to catch me, you see ...but m-my arm slipped...and I fell anyway. My neck hurts too.”</p><p>“Didn’t you see a healer?” Harry asked shocked that the Quidditch star would allow Draco to avoid treatment.</p><p>“No...” Draco turned his head stiffly allowing a glimpse of his normally pale neck. “Viktor says that aches and bruises can teach us lessons - such as not to attempt dangerous moves without proper precautions when they’ve not been performed in a while.”</p><p>“I see…” The bad feeling popped into being again and Harry wasn’t happy to hear this Viktor-ism at all. “Well, I hope you feel better soon.”</p><p>The waitress brought their meals and Ron eyed the blond but said nothing as he used a fork to cut into the fish. Harry and Draco dug into their own meals as well, letting the matter of the bruises fall to the wayside.</p><p>Soon they were all walking back to the Ministry but Harry’s bad feeling refused to disappear. Maybe it was nothing, but he trusted his instincts and they were telling him that something wasn’t right with Draco Malfoy.</p><p>The group parted ways at the lifts and Harry pulled his best mate into his cubicle as soon as they got there.</p><p>“It’s not just me…Right?” Harry whispered. “I mean, he seemed a bit off...to me.”</p><p>“I don’t know, Harry.” Ron said frowning. “It could’ve happened just the way he said...but the way he wouldn’t meet our eyes as he told us his story...Mate, it doesn’t look good.”</p><p>“Mione...We need to tell Mione.” Harry nodded slowly. “She’ll have some ideas...right?”</p><p>Ron nodded in a distracted worried manner. “Yeah. She’s always got ideas, mate.”</p><p>They waited until the workday was over and then walked out to the lifts. Draco gave them a wave from inside the closing lift since they’d just missed it and they waited for the next one. Harry and Ron soon reached the Ministry's apparition point a few alleys away from the visitor’s entrance and instantly disapparated.</p><p>Both men appeared in the front yard of the cottage Ron and his wife had bought just last year. Hermione met Ron at the door with a kiss before noticing that Harry was even there. In fact, Harry had to clear his throat a few times before either of his friends broke off their liplock.</p><p>She quickly got out the pitcher of iced pumpkin juice she’d made earlier that day and three glasses. When Hermione heard what her husband and best friend had to say, she was appalled to realize that she recognized them as signs of abuse as well. “The jealousy was just one small tip on a very large and scary iceberg. We should speak to Draco about this before it gets worse and he gets in too deep.”</p><p>Harry went home after Hermione convinced him that nothing could be done until tomorrow. He was thoroughly resolved to say something to Draco the very next time he saw him.</p><p>He didn’t get the chance... The next morning’s Prophet had a large headline. MALFOY HEIR TO WED QUIDDITCH SUPERSTAR!</p><p>“No!” Harry gasped. He hurried to read the article but when he saw the picture of Draco’s hand it left no doubt.</p><p>There... on the ring finger of Draco’s left hand...was a thick platinum band encrusted with small diamonds.</p><p>“It doesn’t suit him at all!” Harry’s face scrunched up in a distasteful grimace. <i>Much too feminine and gaudy for a man like Draco...</i> He sighed as images of diamonds were replaced with a braided band of platinum with a single emerald cut stone. He could almost picture slipping it onto that pale hand... Harry blinked rapidly. “Nonono! Harry, you have to stop! He’s with Viktor! He’s happy and in love with Viktor.” He shook his head. <i>But what if he’s not really as happy as he seems? Is he being truthful and those bruises were just accidents?</i> Harry stood from the table and went upstairs to get ready for work. <i>I need to at least find out for sure.</i></p>

</center>Harry sat at his desk with disappointment rolling off of him in waves. He’d seen Draco on his way from the lifts and the blond was flashing his new accessory. Harry wondered if he’d get a closer look but didn’t have long to wonder.<p>“Harry?” Draco asked knocking on the wall of the brunette’s cubicle. “I’m sure you’ve seen the article in the Daily Prophet...the announcement...Viktor and I want to celebrate so we’re hosting a dinner this weekend and he said I could ask you since Ron and Hermione will be there as his guests.”</p><p>“I’ll be there but...erm will it be a large event?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Oh, no... Its just six of us since Pansy will be there.” Draco started to turn away but stopped when Harry said his name.</p><p>“Draco, don’t I get to see the ring?” Harry asked softly.</p><p>Draco bit his lip and held out his left hand.</p><p>Harry’s hand came up to meet Draco’s as he looked down at the sparkling gems. A soft sigh escaped Harry’s lips a he unconsciously rubbed his friend's knuckles.</p><p>Draco's breath hitched as he pulled his hand back to his side.</p><p>“Congratulations, Draco...” Harry said just in time to see the blonds back as he walked away.</p><p>The week went slowly. Work was busy and Hermione bugged him to buy new robes for the dinner. Her reasoning was that he should make himself look like someone that nobody would want to mess with so that if the time came and Draco needed him, Viktor would be the one hesitating.</p><p>Having noticed that his wand was looking battered, Harry had gotten a wand-care kit from Ollivander’s at Diagon Alley. Along with the kit, Mr. Ollivander gave him a new holster; it was black with silver fastenings and matched his outer robes perfectly. It was also warded so that only the owner could release the catch, which Harry thought was a rather helpful aspect.</p><p>Finally Saturday dawned and he was ready. Kreacher had pressed his robes and shined his shoes. The black trousers fit him perfectly. They had silver stitching to match the robe he’d be wearing over his new green silk dress shirt which had silver cufflinks set with emeralds. As soon as he heard the floo, Harry slipped the outer robe on to give his friends the full effect. His hair - while still messy - was somehow mildly tamed into a bedhead style. With the robes on, Harry looked almost dignified.</p><p>Hermione grinned upon seeing him stride down the staircase. “You look so similar to Sirius with your hair that way.”</p><p>“Wow, mate.” Ron stared at his friend. “That set of robes make you look...That’s what the muggles would call a power suit, I think.”</p><p>Harry smirked. “That’s what we were going for, right Mione?”</p><p>“Definitely.” Hermione nodded decisively. “Let’s go. Ron and I will go through first.” She and Ron ducked back into the fireplace and threw the powder while speaking the address.</p><p>Harry waited no more than a minute before following them and when he stumbled out of the hearth, Draco was there to meet him.</p><p>“You clean up pretty nicely, Harry.” The blond said with a smirk. Draco was wearing dark grey robes with a black silk dress shirt. The shirt’s sleeves were adorned with platinum and diamond cufflinks.</p><p>“You’ve always looked amazing in formalwear, Draco...” Harry looked him over even as he felt the other man’s grey eyes caress his own body. “Am I the last to arrive?”</p><p>“Yes.” Draco nodded slightly. “Pansy helped me dress for dinner, Hermione and Ron just came through and now here you are. Anyway, they’re in the parlor.”</p><p>Harry chuckled at the blond’s explanation and offered him an arm. “May I escort you to the others?”</p><p>Draco’s breath hitched as he took a slight step back. “I have to check things in the kitchen, Harry. I’m sorry.”</p><p>Harry nodded graciously while retracting his arm. “Of course. Just point me the right way and I’ll see you at the table.”</p><p>“Just go through this door and turn left.” Draco pointed down the hallway. “You can’t miss it.”</p><p>Harry watched the blond’s face as he did so. Draco had a reserved expression and Harry took this to mean that the other man felt he needed to mask his emotions. Nobody should have to do that in their own home and Harry hoped he wasn’t the cause. He sighed as he followed Draco’s directions.</p><p>Hermione was across the room, next to Viktor who was mixing a drink for her when Harry entered the parlor and he nodded politely to his host while handing off his outer robe to an elf. Ron greeted him as if they hadn’t just seen each other moments before. Pansy sat calmly on a chaise by herself sipping a glass of champagne.</p><p>“Harry!” Hermione was holding a strawberry rum smash and a gin and tonic. She kissed Harry’s cheek and handed over the gin and tonic. “Here you go, Harry. No ice. Just the way you like it.”</p><p>Harry’s eyebrow rose as he took a sip. “Thanks.”</p><p>Viktor handed an ale to Ron before greeting Harry. “How have you been, my friend?”</p><p>Harry thought for a moment before responding. He smiled grimly. “Not as bad as some.”</p><p>“Draco tells me you go out to lunch sometimes.” Viktor said with an overly large grin. “Did he speak the truth that you vould like to challenge me to a Seeker’s Game?”</p><p>“I don’t play much anymore and many people have told me you and I could be good competition.” Harry nodded.</p><p>“I vould be interested in meeting these people and seeing if they are correct.” Viktor’s grin turned brittle. “And you vill join Hermione and Ron when they keep <i>my</i> Draco company at the upcoming game?”</p><p>Harry’s teeth instantly became set on edge. As if the ring didn’t already lay a claim to the blond, Viktor had to speak the words? “Yes. I’ve already gotten the day off. I’m looking forward to it.”</p><p>“Vonderful!” The boisterous Bulgarian shouted startling Draco as he walked in the door.</p><p>“Viktor, dinner is almost ready. Another five minutes at most.” Draco whispered to his fiancé before greeting his guests. “Harry, I’m so glad you were able to join us. Hermione and Ron, it’s always nice to see you.”</p><p>“I was just speaking to Viktor about the Seeker’s Game. He’s agreed that it’s a good idea.” Harry grinned.</p><p>“That’s great! I’d love to watch you.” Draco wore a smile but Harry could see that it didn’t reach his grey eyes. Draco’s eyes weren’t supposed to be grey; they should be a bright shining silver!</p><p>“You and I were always more than a match for each other. Perhaps we should have a game too.” Harry saw a glare appear on Viktor’s face.</p><p>“You really vant to vatch him fly...do you, Draco?” The burley older man asked glaring at his fiancé.</p><p>Draco paled slightly. “I meant <i>both</i> of you, Viktor. You know I love watching you in the air.”</p><p>Viktor seemed to calm at that. “And you vish to fly with him?”</p><p>“I’ve always enjoyed a good flight.” Draco relaxed a little but remained watchful as he glanced toward the wet bar. “May I - I mean maybe I’ll get myself a glass of wine...”</p><p>“Don’t be silly, Draco.” Viktor said softly but his voice wasn’t gentle as he walked over to the bar. His eyes barely left Draco’s face as he picked up a glass and opened a bottle of Chardonnay - Draco’s favorite. He poured the white wine into the glass slowly and smirked as he replaced the cork before smoothly delivering it into Draco’s hand.</p><p>Harry tried not to appear unsettled by the whole conversation he’d just witnessed but that same bad feeling had just returned to his stomach.</p><p>A soft musical tone sounded just before an elf’s high voice announced. “Dinner is being served!”</p>

</center>“This vay, my friends.” Viktor took Draco’s hand in his free one and tucked it into his elbow before leading the group across the hallway to the dining room.<p>The table and chairs were neatly covered with silk cloths. The place settings were assigned formally with Draco and Viktor at opposite ends. Pansy sat on Draco’s right but opposite Harry bracketing their blond host while Hermione sat to the right of Viktor with Ron across from her. The plates appeared to be fine china while the glasses were made of crystal and to complete the look the silverware was simple but beautifully monogrammed with the couple’s initials.</p><p>A silver tray appeared in the center of the table with dinner rolls and a large round crystal dish accompanied it with multiple servings of butter which had been transfigured into a distinctive daffodil shape.</p><p>Viktor escorted Draco to his seat before taking his own. “Draco, you’ve done quite vell with the preparations for this evening. Even the butter is decorative! The daffodil is a favorite flower of mine.”</p><p>Unsurprised, Harry smiled and cut a petal off to spread on his roll. "Daffodils are also known as narcissus... Aren’t they? So Draco, how <i>is</i> your mother?"</p><p>Draco smirked, happy that someone knew its proper name. “Mother and Father are both wonderful, Harry. Father was happy to give Viktor his blessing and to have such a noted individual join the family.”</p><p>Harry could imagine how thrilled Lucius was. The prestige of Viktor’s Quidditch career would do a lot to diminish the infamy from his days as a Death Eater. The brunette smiled just as Draco used his wand to summon a roll and cut it open.</p><p>Viktor had a superior smirk on as he stood and addressed the group. “Everyone...I vould like to propose a toast. To my Draco and our engagement...I’m thankful that I fell in love vith such a vonderful man...He is sweet and gracious vith an <i>almost</i> perfect body...” He joked, winking at his fiancé as everyone except Harry and Draco enjoyed a chuckle. “No, truly, I’m a very lucky man...vith a terrible sense of humor. Thank you for accepting my troth, Draco… Also, thank you all for celebrating vith us. Enjoy the moussaka!”</p><p>Lowering his gaze to his plate, Draco carefully placed his roll on the side of his dish and waited for the meal to be served.</p><p>As they ate the moussaka, which seemed to be made with potatoes, ground meat, and tomatoes but topped with a white sauce and baked, Harry also noticed a few bay leaves and a dollop of yoghurt on top. He dipped a bit of the roll into the mixture and saw almost all the others doing the same…but not Draco. The blond hadn’t touched his roll for the rest of the night, nor did he accept the offer of afters. Harry didn’t eat much of the meal and only a little dessert because that bad feeling in his gut had festered. He felt sick that anyone could mistreat Draco this way.</p><p>After-dinner drinks were served in a large room where there were couches and a chess board and a piano. Viktor sat on one side of the piano bench and patted the open end. Draco seemed to hesitate but took the seat next to him.</p><p>“Play something for us, Draco.” The larger man commanded.</p><p>“Do you play, Draco?” Hermione asked.</p><p>“Not really…I’m still learning.” Draco’s cheeks flushed in embarrassment. “Viktor likes piano music and his mother used to play.”</p><p>“She’s passed on now, but my Draco vill learn.” Viktor nodded decisively.</p><p>Draco placed his hands on the keys and did a passable job of producing something that resembled music but Harry could tell Viktor wasn’t happy with the attempt. Ron noticed Harry’s agitation and challenged Viktor to a chess match while Hermione sat on a couch and spoke softly with Pansy. Draco – no longer on display – got up and magically activated a music crystal before walking over to the couch where Harry was sitting. He sat next to Harry but left a good amount of space between them. They spoke about nonsensical things for a while – places they been, food they’d eaten, things they’d seen and done. Viktor barely won the chess match and quickly declared the night over. He directed Draco to see their guests to the floo and kissed Hermione’s cheek in farewell before disappearing from sight.</p><p>The blond obediently walked with the group to the floo-room and called an elf to bring the outer robes or cloaks. Pansy smiled at Draco and hugged him lightly before accepting her cloak and stepping into the fireplace. Ron and Hermione were next and they gently assured their host that they’d enjoyed their visit.</p><p>When Harry’s turn came, he took the robe and slipped it on. “I wish you all the happiness in the world.” Harry said hugging him goodbye and when he got close enough, he whispered. “Call me anytime…”</p><p>Draco frowned as if confused, but he nodded and thanked the brunette.</p>

</center>The next morning, Harry woke with an inexplicable desire to see Draco. As he showered, Harry decided to seek the blond out and invite him to lunch. When he reached his office there was a file on his desk. It was going to be a long few weeks so Harry contemplated going to find Draco...just to tell him that he’d be out of contact. Unfortunately, there wasn’t even time for that because Ron joined him with the news that they were expected to head out immediately.<p>Countless hours were spent staking out apartment buildings and warehouses. They wound up pulling a few all nighters. It took about three weeks…almost a month. The suspect was finally caught in the process of testing harmful potions on muggles.</p><p>One night, just after having closed the case, Harry returned to his home and found an envelope from Draco in with his post. Opening it, he found a letter in Draco’s handwriting. He bit his lip as he read that Hermione had informed Draco and Viktor that he was away on a mission and they wished him luck. The blond also told him to let them know when he was ready for the Seekers’ Game they’d planned. With an excited grin, he hurried to his study and pulled out the stationery that Hermione had given him for his last birthday. He got out his favorite quill and wrote that he’d like to meet soon – perhaps even in the next day or so. He rushed up to the room he kept as an owlry and sent the letter with a lovely barn owl called Juliette after instructing her to wait for a reply.</p><p>As she winged out the window, her mate – Romeo – seemed to pout. Harry had gotten them just over a year ago and when he’d asked about their names, the clerk had simply said that it was a case of love at first sight so he’d named them after the famous Shakespearean lovers. He paced as he waited for the reply and was soon rewarded. Within an hour, he held a sheet of parchment and read Draco’s words that welcomed him home and said that Viktor and Draco would be pleased to meet him at Victor’s team’s home pitch the next day for their Seekers’ Game. He went to bed with a smile knowing he’d see Draco soon.</p><p>Upon arrival at the pitch, Harry saw Draco leaning against the wall next to the door. He was not only wearing his customary black trousers but also a muggle t-shirt. “You’re not dressed. Aren’t you going to join in the fun?”</p><p>“Not today...” Draco said sighing mysteriously as he turned to open the door. “Viktor’s inside. I’ll show you to the locker room.”</p><p>Harry frowned but followed, paying close attention to the twisted hallways but also fuming at the blond’s passive behavior. <i>Poor Draco! Viktor’s so controlling he won’t even let him fly with us! But why does he put up with it?</i></p><p>Harry nodded to Viktor who was just finished suiting up as they walked in. “I hear Draco’s going to sit this one out.”</p><p>“Indeed, my friend. It is not his day.” Viktor looked distinctly proud of himself and Harry dearly wanted to wipe that arrogant grin off the other man’s face.</p><p>Silently the brunette gritted his teeth and began to dress in the Quidditch robes he’d brought along. Once he was completely outfitted, he took a small box from the pocket of the denims he’d been wearing. It held his broom...the latest model of broom to grace the skies...the Lightning Bolt. The name - surprisingly enough - had nothing to do with him...it simply moved faster than a Firebolt. He lifted the miniature broom out of the box, used Wingardium Leviosa to let it hover in mid-air and then a quick enlargement spell to return it to proper size.</p><p> </p><p>Draco and Viktor were both awed by the sight of it but neither man allowed it to show on their face. Only by his prior experiences with Draco could Harry notice that his facial muscles were slack rather than deliberately emotionless.</p><p>Harry mounted his broom and waited for Viktor to mount his but when he looked up, Viktor seemed more interested in mounting Draco instead. As soon as the older man broke the kiss, Draco backed away in the direction of the box Quidditch chest blushing and rubbing one arm. He kept the Quaffle and Bludgers inside the chest but pulled on a pair of white gloves before lifting out the tiny golden ball with reverence.</p><p>“It is a brand new Snitch…purchased for this particular occasion…” Viktor told him solemnly.</p><p>Harry knew this for the brag it was. Not only could Viktor afford to buy a brand new snitch, but he wouldn’t need to resort to cheating in order to win. “That’s very honorable of you, Viktor. Thank you…”</p><p>“Draco…Vait until ve are in the air to release the snitch, please.” Viktor’s eyes focused intently on the blond.</p><p>“Of course, Viktor.” Draco seemed nervous but kept his own eyes firmly focused on his fiancé.</p><p>Harry and Viktor took off at the same time. Draco waited for them to settle in on their brooms and asked about their readiness before making a slight show of the release by tossing it straight up in the air. The wings quickly unfurled and it lifted itself the rest of the way to hover between the competitors. It seemed to look at each of them in turn before making a rapid getaway.</p><p>“One lap clockwise around the pitch and then you may begin the search.” Draco told them before looking at his future husband. “Good luck.”</p><p>Harry kept pace with Viktor for the lap but let himself speed up near the end as he directed his broom up into the thin cloud cover. The brunette wanted to put Viktor in his place and truly hoped to beat him so he kept his eyes sharp and on the lookout for the snitch. He circled the home team’s goal posts twice before passing across the field to do the same on the other side.</p><p>Viktor swooped past Harry always opposite him. If Harry went clockwise, Viktor flew counter-clockwise. If the brunette looked down, the older man looked up.</p><p>Harry’s vision had been corrected a few years back so the goggles he wore simply kept his hair and other annoyances like bugs out of his eyes. Suddenly, he thought he saw a glimmer of gold. Was it real? He couldn’t be sure but he couldn’t take the chance it wasn’t.</p><p>Viktor noticed the moment Harry changed course and fell into place behind and to the left of the younger man.</p><p>Harry got low to the ground and seemed to skim the grass as he reached forward.</p><p>Viktor used one hand to tug on the bristles of the superior broom hoping to throw Harry off course but failing miserably as he only gave Harry the angle he needed to firmly cup the teasing little sphere and close his fingers tightly around it.</p><p>Harry grinned at his host as he landed beside Draco but felt the happiness drain as he saw Viktor’s temper rising. He caught himself wondering what would happen if Viktor took his temper out on Draco. He wanted only good and happy things for the blond and that flash of anger didn’t bode well.</p><p>“I demand another go! It vas probably spelled for beginning seekers, not old pro’s like us!” Viktor shouted from his perch on his broom. “Too easy!”</p><p>Harry took the opportunity to glance in Draco’s direction. The almost fearful caution he saw in those grey eyes cemented his decision. “I thought so too, Viktor. Let’s go again.” Harry didn’t look at the older man as he once again took to the air.</p><p>The first bout had gone too quickly - it was true. Harry had been so focused on beating Viktor that perhaps he’d rushed things a bit. The next task he’d set himself would be much more difficult. He had to find way to let the other man win without Viktor realizing that’s what he was doing. He knew he could do this - to keep Draco safe from that hulking brute, he needed to at least try.</p><p>Harry handed the snitch over to Draco. “Are there multiple settings on it?”</p><p>Draco nodded.</p><p>“Then set it high - like professional level.” Harry told him softly.</p><p>“But Harry...it was <i>on</i> pro level.” Draco looked at the brunette.</p><p>Where was the blond’s sense of self preservation? Harry sighed. “Then wave your wand over the thing and just <i>tell</i> him you’re raising the setting.”</p><p>Draco finally cottoned to what Harry was telling him and did as he’d been instructed. “Viktor! I raised the setting!”</p><p>“Good! Harry and I deserve a real game. Set it free as soon as he’s in the air - as before!” Viktor yelled.</p><p>Draco turned to see Harry already mounting up. After checking their readiness, Draco tossed the snitch and watched as it looked at the players before taking off to hide somewhere.</p><p>Harry looked off into the distance in the direction taken by the snitch. While looking for the tiny gold ball, he decided on the tactic he’d use to achieve his goal. Based on what Viktor had done in the first game, it seemed to Harry that the older man was watching Harry instead of really looking for the snitch. The best way to take advantage of that was to use too much speed or the wrong angle when he went to chase it.</p><p>He looked methodically for the snitch, as he’d done before...high and low...near and far... He flew in circular patterns and figure eights. Viktor was once again following him closely but he didn’t seem to notice the glint of gold coming from below the left goal post on the opposite side of the pitch. Harry made a quick decision and dove into a Wronski Feint.</p><p>When he pulled up to angle towards the snitch, Viktor was able to overtake Harry’s position and he did so with a loud victory cry.</p><p>Harry kept his amusement at Viktor’s gullibility hidden as well as possible. That feat became less difficult as he watched Viktor land beside his fiancé and scoop him up into a tight squeezing embrace. Draco was barely submitting to Viktor’s attention and once again he flushed with color when the bigger man released him. Harry was getting more and more disgusted with Viktor’s actions. He cleared his throat and thanked Viktor for a vigorous workout once again voicing his regret that Draco couldn’t join in. He shook both their hands and left while trying to suppress the urge to take the blond and run.</p><p>Later that afternoon, Harry received an owl from Draco asking him to meet for lunch the next day in the breakroom. His smile was grim as he answered in the affirmative but insisted on providing the meal. He’d ask Kreacher to make a salad and some sandwiches. This would be the perfect opportunity to air his feelings on the matter of Draco’s abuse. He quickly drafted a note to Hermione and Ron that Draco was meeting him for lunch the next day and, rather than letting them join in, he would let them know later what happened.</p><p>Hermione – unwilling to accept that – dragged Ron through the floo and proceeded to question Harry. Once his friends knew the current state of his affair, they went home promising to let Harry handle lunch.</p>
