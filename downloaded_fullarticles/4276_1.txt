  <strong>Ireland Claims Quidditch World Cup!</strong>
</p>
<p>Stan Marsh glanced at the title of the Daily Prophet, but paid the rest of the article no mind, as he had witnessed the game first hand. It was an incredible game, to be certain; Ireland's strong Chasers and ruthless Beaters won them the game, but their Seeker was no match for that of the Bulgarian team's Viktor Krum. He had snatched the Snitch as soon as it was apparent that his team would lose, securing at least his reputation for the game. </p>
<p>Stan's eyes flitted up to his best friend Kenny McCormick, who was busy munching happily on several licorice wands at once. Kenny was enraptured with Krum, to the point that were it not for the blonde's particular taste for large breasted women and small, effeminate men, Stan would assume a crush. Kenny was the tallest of their friend group, so much so that Kyle once teased relation to a half giant. The blonde was roguishly handsome, and had more than one student at Hogwarts panting after him. The raven's eyes dragged lazily to his other best friend, Kyle, who had his nose, predictably, buried in a large and more than likely incredibly complicated spell book. </p>
<p>Kyle Broflovski had earned himself the title of Brightest Wizard of the Age by more than a few of their professors and even the headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. He had proven the title worth its salt when he managed to pass every year of schooling top of the class. Where as Kenny was tall and strong, tanned and fair haired, Kyle was the opposite. A small boy, Kyle barely surpassed five feet by a mere few inches, though no one was truly to know his height, for the boy became flustered and angry should anyone bring it up. He was thin and pale, often looking sickly in the winter months. His curly red hair,a soft rosy color, paired with his sea green eyes in such a way it earned him a much larger fan base at school than the boy's withered self esteem would allow him to see.</p>
<p>Stan himself was quite handsome. Though nowhere near as tall as Kenny, Stan's height commanded a lot of respect for him, as well as his muscular frame due to years of Quidditch practice. His black hair and deep blue eyes attracted quite a bit of attention and, were it not for the three's talent for trouble, they would have found themselves quite popular. As it was, the trio could hardly go four months without stirring up some kind of trouble, and always managed to get out of it by the skin of their teeth(and more than a few helpful spells from Kyle's vast repertoire).</p>
<p>As the Hogwarts Express neared it's destination, Stan double checked his things: Spell books, school robes, tie.... His owl Sparky, who behaved more like a dog than a bird, was sleeping soundly in his cage. Beside him lay Lemmiwinks, Kenny's pet rat. Next to them lay Stan's wand: 13 inches, ebony wood with a phoenix feather core. Old Ollivander had been ecstatic when Stan's wand had chosen him, claiming a wand with such an unusual core had to mean great things for the young wizard. </p>
<p>Stan picked up his wand, giving it an experimental swish. The wand responded with a golden glow emanating from the tip, causing Kyle to pause from his readings, quirking an eyebrow at his friend. Stan merely grinned, causing the redhead to roll his eyes, though the small smile on his face betrayed the gesture. Kyle had asked Stan and Kenny multiple questions about the temperament of their wands, as fascinated with the subject as he was with all others, and only stopped when Kenny remarked that asking to see their dicks would be less invasive. </p>
<p>Kenny's wand, 12 3/4 inches, made of holly with the hair of a unicorn, was best suited to Kenny's natural affinity for healing charms, Stan having seen the boy return from the brink of death many a time with a few simple spells. Stan's wand aided primarily with transfiguration, one of his favorite subjects. Being able to turn a person into a toad lent itself greatly to the Muggle stereotypes of witches and magic in general, which only made Stan enjoy the subject even more. Kyle's wand, 14 inches, made of elm wood and dragon heartstring, was the most dangerous of the three, for like its owner it possessed a power and temper that wasn't easily matched. Kyle's adeptness at all forms of magic(except perhaps those involving flying brooms and large magical creatures) made performing with his unusually strong and flexible wand appear almost elegant.</p>
<p>The train lurched to a stop, signalling its riders to begin their departure. The three friends made their way to the station, carrying their things with them. Kenny hefted Kyle's navy blue luggage over his shoulder, winking and grinning down smugly at his shorter friend. Kyle rolled his eyes once more, but patted his larger friend's shoulder as means of gratitude. They chatted animatedly as the enchanted boats brought them across the great Black Lake and to the magical castle they had come to know over the past four years. </p>
<p>All was normal until the entrance of the Great Hall, where the three had to, unfortunately, separate.</p>
<p>"See you guys later," Kyle said with a sad smile tempered by time, before retreating to the Ravenclaw table.</p>
<p>The three had been friends since childhood, spending their formative years playing at one another's houses. Stan and Kyle, both from wizarding families, knew of their magical inheritance and their impending education at Hogwarts. Kenny had been the wild card, proving his magical talents despite a completely nonmagical family. The magic in his blood was so far back in his genealogy the McCormicks couldn't even remember there being witches or wizards in the family, and were shocked when the entirety of the world was shown to them. </p>
<p>Though their friendship was great, it was no match for the sorting hat. Kyle was placed in Ravenclaw the second the hat brushed against his ruby curls, forever separating his schooling from his friends. Stan and Kenny were both sorted into Gryffindor, they're brave and foolhardy natures finding them a natural kinship with their house mates. On occasion the three shared a few classes, such as Charms and Defense Against the Dark Arts, and they tried desperately to share the same elective courses, joining the Duelling Club together highlighted their second year. </p>
<p>Stan and Kenny chose seats nearest their Gryffindor friends: Token Black, a tall but reserved boy who was known for his common room record at Exploding Snap, Bebe Stevens, a bright and bubbly blonde girl whose outer beauty served only to disguise her incredible Potions skills, and Clyde Donovan, a weepy brown haired boy who had yet to prove the bravery the sorting hat believed he possessed in great enough quantity to merit a place in Gryffindor house.</p>
<p>Looking to the Ravenclaw table, Stan noted with some disdain that Craig Tucker, one of his arch rivals, was seated comfortably close to Kyle, his bored expression hiding the interest in his eyes as Kyle chattered away about some topic or other. On Kyle's other side sat Jimmy Valmer, a handicapped boy whose talents at comedy and Charms easily made him the most likeable guy in Fourth Year. </p>
<p>As the students ate and caught up after a season apart, Professor Dumbledore cleared his throat to capture their attention.</p>
<p>"As some of you may already know, Hogwarts has been chosen to host a legendary event: the Tri-Wizard Tournament!"</p>
<p>There were several cheers from various students, though many looked just as lost as Stan and Kenny were.</p>
<p>"Three schools will compete against one another to achieve eternal glory! Three schools, three champions, three tasks. Only one will be able to claim the ultimate prize, the Tri-Wizard Cup!"</p>
<p>With a flick of his wand, a beautiful chalice appeared in front of the elderly wizard, causing the students to once again erupt in cheers. </p>
<p>"Please help me in welcoming our guests, the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons academy of magic and their headmistress, Madame Maxime!"</p>
<p>As if on cue, a procession of beautiful women entered the Great Hall, doing a sweet simple dance as the did. Many of the boys were entranced by the performance, and even Stan and Kenny couldn't help but stare as an exceptionally pretty blonde girl entered with a woman so large she could only be half giant.</p>
<p>"Next, from Bulgaria, the proud sons of Durmstrang, and their headmaster, Igor Karkaroff!"</p>
<p>Another procession entered, this one composed entirely of stern faced, broad shouldered men, chanting and performing a dance of their own. The girls swooned and Kyle, who Stan was watching with great amusement, was pink faced as he watched the display. Igor Karkaroff entered with a tall, handsome boy whom Kenny quickly identified.</p>
<p>"Holy fuck dude, that's Viktor Krum!" the ecstatic blonde all but shouted. The Bulgarian Seeker kept his eyes fixed directly in front of him, ignoring the cheers and calls of his name. </p>
<p>"I trust you will all give our guests the same comfort and warmth that you have come to know in your years here. I must warn all those who wish to enter, these tasks are not for the faint of heart. Due to the danger of the competition, only those of the age of seventeen will be allowed to cast their name into the Goblet of Fire." </p>
<p>A large, ancient cup erected itself in the middle of the hall, a brilliant blue flame bursting from within it. Several students from each school stared intently at the flames, eyes gleaming. The rest of dinner passed without incident, and soon the students were retiring for the evening. The Durmstrang students were sent below to the dungeons with the Slytherins, while the Beauxbatons students were sent to the Hufflepuff dorms off of the kitchens. </p>
<p>Stan and Kenny accompanied Kyle up to the seventh floor, pausing at the staircase that lead to the Ravenclaw tower. It had become a ritual of theirs since their first year, walking as far up together as they could before splitting off to their separate dorms. Stan and Kenny both leaned down to kiss Kyle on the cheek, an action that still caused the smaller redhead to blush furiously. He hugged them both all the same.</p>
<p>"Night guys, don't go wandering around without me," Kyle murmured, snuggling ever so slightly into each of them.</p>
<p>"Never," the Gryffindors replied, wishing their brainy friend one final goodnight before taking the staircase to their dorm, Kyle doing the same.</p>
