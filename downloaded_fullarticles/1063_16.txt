    <p>He will mangle your mind.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, and for that I bow down to JKR's superior writing ability.</p>
<p>Warnings: Adult scenes, and language. Slashy, Homosex themes. Don't like it, Don't read it. :)</p>
<p>A/N: I am now going to be bouncing between 3 stories! Oh, Poor Sirius. :/ Slash will be happening in later chapters! You have been warned. :p</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>"CRUCIO!"</b> A deep bellow erupted from the square chest of Orion Black. His handsome face was stoic as he watched his eldest son writhe on the ground. His eyes impassive as Sirius' limbs quaked and jerked wildly.</p>
<p>'Don't scream. It'll be over soon.' The heir focused on evening his breath, the mantra serving only as a distraction from the blinding wire of pain coursing through him.</p>
<p>The authoritative man would have been impressed with the self control his son was demonstrating, if he wasn't to be punished. Orion broke the curse, his face curled in disgust as he watched his son choke and cough crimson onto their carpet. He grunted lightly as his foot came in swift contact with his sons already bruised rib cage.</p>
<p>"Fucking filth. Clean that up." His voice steady and crisp as he turned to meet his wife, Walburga in the doorway. Her appearance would have been described as ravish, a luxurious beauty if her face wasn't mangled with a look of morbid excitement. As her husband shifted past her, she turned to follow, her silver eyes catching the exquisitely carved mirror outside the sitting room. She doted in vanity, wrapped her platinum strands in a tight bun, ignoring the pained breaths escaping her wounded sons' lips.</p>
<p>Without looking back she sauntered out the front door, calling to Regulus over her shoulder. "Come dear, we'll be late." Her voice laced with a sweetness reserved only for her youngest son.</p>
<p>"Just a moment!" The prepubescent voice of Sirius' younger brother rang out in the otherwise empty house. Sirius huffed and glanced up to see a younger , near identical version of himself, kneeling beside him. The upright boy tossed a plush, black towel between his brothers trembling hands. "Don't forget to clean that. She has your wand." His voice was calculated, though an octive of fear snuck through.</p>
<p>Sirius gripped the rag tightly, sitting upright to meet his brothers cool eyes. His face was seemingly emotionless. Sirius felt a heavy pressure collecting in his chest, until a hand lightly rested on his shoulder. The long haired teen whipped his head back, noticing a slight quiver in his siblings lower lip just before the boy rose to his feet, and left without a word.</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>"Oi! James, it's good to see you! It's been ages!" Sirius exclaimed, tossing his bag in the corner of the compartment and pulling the other boy into a quick embrace. The bespectacled boy felt his best friends' body tense for just a moment as arms encircled his torso. He shook it off as Sirius pulled away, laughing hollowly.</p>
<p>"So, Where's Rem and Pete?" Sirius' who had arrived to the platform just as the train was about to take off, didn't see the rest of their pack upon boarding.</p>
<p>"Remus is in a prefect meeting, he should be back soon. Pete, last I checked was chasing the snack trolley. Curd tosser, he is." James laughed lightly, turning to take a seat on the opposing bench.</p>
<p>They excitedly discussed the summer, Sirius allowing James to overtake the conversation, ranting and raving about how amazing their trip to Spain was. Sirius chuckled lightly to himself as he noticed the sunburn the other boy was sporting, especially around the bridge of his nose where his glasses kept slipping.</p>
<p>"'Ey, Sorry I'm late.." Whispered Remus as he rushed in the compartment, slamming the door shut behind him. The aggressive close startled the dark haired boys. The new arrival didn't look up as he pulled his muggle shirt up and over his head, before throwing it to the corner with his bookbag.</p>
<p>Sirius' eyes began to immediately wander the boys pale torso. Taking in every new scar that scattered his body. His own ribs pulsed with pain at the sharp inhale he found himself taking.</p>
<p>"Earth to Sirius.. Come in Sirius." James reached out, grabbing at Sirius' arm playfully.</p>
<p><b>"STOP!" </b>The distracted teen snatched his arm back possessively, only to grin sheepishly at his friends. "Uh, sorry.." Without further explanation, Sirius picked up his book back, and slung it over his shoulder. "Going to the loo, back in a tick." And with that, he was out the door.</p>
<p>When he returned he was already in his robes.</p>
<p>Peter had joined, and was in the middle of changing himself. The chubby boy struggling with a few buttons in the front of his uniform, "Must've shrunk in the wash.." The blond boy muttered to himself as James reached out and patted his bulging tummy, "Yep, Petey.. I think so.." Peter shot the short, black haired boy a quick glare before wrestling his shirt closed and taking a seat. Sirius slipped past, plopping down next to the amber haired boy.</p>
<p>The air was tense.  James continued to try and engage them all in conversation. He eventually trailed off in defeat, the foursome falling into silence before the train came to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>The marauders gathered up their things, and exited the compartment into a flood of students eager to get to the feast.</p>
<p>James sighed, glancing around for a studious red-head. He hadn’t seen her board the train.</p>
<p>"I hope sleep sorts them out." The words were addressed to nobody in-particular as the hazel eyed boy felt a shove at his shoulder, and realized he was holding up the line.</p>
<p>____________</p>
<p>Silver eyes shot open with a start. Sirius untangled himself from sweat slicked sheets, his chest heaving as massive gulps of air entered his lungs.</p>
<p>He shook away the horrific dream. His lips mouthing incoherently as his pulse slowed and came to a steady rhythm. Sirius checked the time:</p>
<p>
  <b>-4:34-</b>
</p>
<p>Swinging his legs over the side of his four-poster, his warm feet came in cool contact with the icy floor. Sirius rose with a surge of pain, slowly making his way to the showers. 'No sense in going back to bed'</p>
<p>As the door to the shared bathroom clicked closed, the amber flecked eyes of Remus Lupin snapped open.</p>
<p>The now awake teen sat up, his own pulse surging as he recalled the pained noises he heard coming from behind Sirius' curtain. The boys, aside from Remus (who had frequent nightmares) were never good about putting up silencing spells, much to the amusement of each other, as their hormones got the better of them. This time was different though. Something was wrong.</p>
<p>His thin fingers snaked through tangled, honey stricken locks as the boy fought with himself on whether to check up on his friend. His keen sense of hearing peaked when the rush of the showers came on, and a distant moan slipped past the unsealed door.</p>
<p>'I'll wait here..' Concluded the studious boy as he laid back against the plush of his pillows. It wasn't long before the lycan drifted back off to sleep, his conscious forgetting about the pained boy huddled in the shower, attempting to nurse what he concluded to be broken ribs.</p>
<p>The black haired teen toyed with the idea of going to Pomfrey, telling her James shoved him off his broom. The witch was very discreet, but very clever. Sirius knew she would know the bruises were aged, and would question his home life. She knew of the notorious house of Black and their crude and archaic sense of discipline, and would no doubt be concerned.</p>
<p>He made the mistake of going to her the previous year, after a meet with his father in Dumbledore's office which resulted in a black eye and a broken nose. The headmaster of course didn't breathe a word of the incident to anyone, upon Sirius' request, but he had a sneaking suspicion the peaky nurse already knew.</p>
<p>Huffing in emotional defeat, Sirius turned the tap of the showers off and wrapped a heated towel around his slender hips. The teen gingerly approached the mirror, surveying the damage. Purple and yellowing bruises glittered both his slides, and upon a deep inhale he noticed his ribs shifting awkwardly, a few uneven with the rest.</p>
<p>He searched the drawers of the bathroom for the gauze he knew Remus kept for maintenance after his transformations. He wrapped his torso tightly, careful in pushing a few bones back where he believed they should go, before decorating himself in an obscene amount of tape to hold the dressings in place.</p>
<p>_________</p>
<p>A thick tendril of nicotine wafted before the werewolves nostrils, bringing him back from slumber. The bitter scent assaulted his senses and before he could gage his actions, he was up and out of bed, making a b-line for the boy casually seated on the wide-set windowsill.</p>
<p>"Mind if I partake?" Remus' voice was hoarse, his body juxtaposed to the black haired teen. Sirius glanced over, his grey eyes brighter than Remus' recalled.</p>
<p>The heir placed the existing cigarette loosely between his generous lips before pulling another out from his pack. As Remus reached for it, Sirius slipped the second vice between his lips, striking up a lighter quickly, bringing the swaying flame to the other cancerous object. The werewolf's eyes burned bronze in the minimal light, watching the tranquil teen elegantly handle the two sticks, a curl of smoke weaving out the side of his lips in an artful fashion.</p>
<p>The onyx haired boy extended the muggle fag to Remus, who took it silently. Their eyes locked for a moment, a flicker of concern flashed across honey, but no words left his mouth. Remus was tactful, something Sirius greatly appreciated. A curt nod, and they both relaxed, limbs tangled in nonchalance as they basked in the same vice. Their gaze reaching towards Sirius' astrological namesake, the brightest glimmer in the celestial sphere.</p>
<p>The stars scattered and twinkled in the early morning sky, rebelling against the leisurely rising sun. A new day was approaching, and both boys savored a mutual calm only the grounds of Hogwarts could bring.</p>
<p>This was home.</p>
<p>They were family.</p>
