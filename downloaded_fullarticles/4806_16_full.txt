    <p>You whisked through your dark room with precision, packing the few things of importance you had within your essentials. Today was the day you were going to Hogwarts, you thought. Hogwarts was a school of magic, teaching witches and wizards alike. It would be your first year there, and you were expected to make it through with good grades and be just how your parents wanted.</p><p>Hayes, you thought of the last name with pure distaste. You hated most of your family, only getting along with the eldest of your siblings. You had four, in fact. There was Genevieve, the youngest at age nine. Then you, second youngest at age eleven. The middle child was Luctus, in his third year of Hogwarts at age thirteen. The second eldest was Ethan, in his forth year of Hogwarts at age fourteen. Then there was your eldest sibling, William, in his sixth year. He was sixteen years old and you looked up to him greatly.</p><p>He was one of the only people in the household who didn't treat you like a toddler just learning to walk. Your respect for him was mutual, and you both got along well. You and Genevieve got along okay, not hating or liking each other too much in particular. Now, Luctus... you could feel a burning hate in your gut whenever you saw him. Ethan, you liked him more than Luctus, but you still held a heavy dislike towards him for humiliating you constantly.</p><p>The Hayes family was one of Purebloods - rather uptight about it, too - and they were known for being cunning and intelligent, hence why they were expected to be put into Ravenclaw. William was a Ravenclaw, much like Luctus and Ethan. They may be terrible people in your opinion, but they were still rather intelligent. You just hoped you were also intelligent - not that you cared much if you disappointed your father, more your mother.</p><p>You loved your mother, you really did, she gave you life and was one of the only people you could trust with your own feelings. You slightly lacked in the emotions department, but she helped you understand yourself. For that, you were grateful. Your father, on the other hand, you hated even more than your siblings. He was cruel to you, threatening to lay his hands on you, but he'd never done it. You knew that if he did, your mother would have his head.</p><p>So you used whatever time you could to bother him, annoy him, get him hurt.. you loved riling the man up, even if it caused you to have a lack of supper some nights. You were pulled out of your pondering by your mother shouting up the stairs for everyone to be ready and downstairs. You hauled your trunk up and made your way slowly down the stairs, where you saw William already waiting.</p><p>Your mother was by the door, holding Genevieve's hand and waiting patiently for your other siblings. Of course your disgrace for a father wasn't here, he never was for any of your siblings for as long as you've been alive. You wouldn't doubt that the man was trying to keep far from his family by putting loads of work off so he'd have an excuse to not be there, spending time with you all. With that, you set out towards the train station to board the Hogwarts Express.</p><p align="center">X-----X</p><p align="left">You stood in Ollivander's with a bored expression as the man behind the counter handed you a hawthorn wand. You gave a small flick, and the sound of glass shattering from behind startled your mother and Genevieve. Ollivander hummed in disappointment, then went into the back and came back with another wand, "Yew, dragon heartstring, thirteen inches long. Try this one."</p><p align="left">You have the wand a flick, and there was a light spray of yellow sparks. You took this as a sign of acceptance and looked to your mother, wand in hand, "I think this is the one."</p><p align="left">"Yes, yes, of course. Here you go," your mother hurriedly paid for your wand and scurried out of the shop with Genevieve at her side. You followed her with your brows furrowed, why was she so anxious to get out?</p><p align="left">You only shrugged and followed her to the pet shop, where you were going to get your own pet. William had gotten a cat his first year, a pudgy brown tabby he affectionately named Karley. Luctus had himself a rat, you were sure he was trying to use it to scare you. The rat - an ugly grey thing - was named Whiskers. Ethan actually got an owl, a majestic bird with snowy white feathers with black flecks that he named Artemis.</p><p align="left">Now, it was your turn. You were looking around at all the animals, owls, kittens, toads all alike. Your mother stayed outside with Genevieve, Ethan, and Luctus. She'd given you enough coin for an animal and sent you in with William. William was browsing with you, suggesting getting a good look at the owls first. Of course, most of them looked the same, much to your displeasure. The door opened, and you paid it no mind, until you heard particularly heavy footsteps. You turned and watched a giant of a man coming over by you two to browse the owls, and couldn't help but stare no matter how rude it might be.</p><p align="left">William shook your shoulder, making you turn your gaze from the large man, "Focus, Y/N. We need to get you a pet and out, quickly."</p><p align="left">You focused more on the cats than the owls, though mainly on a small siamese cat who's blue eyes pierced into your very soul. You tapped William's shoulder and pointed to it, "That one."</p><p align="left">That was how you got your wand and pet, who you'd named Rocco.</p><p align="center">X-----X</p><p align="left">After a quick goodbye between you, your mother, and Genevieve, you boarded the train and looked for a compartment to call your own. It took a long while, trying to get around other first years who looked as lost on you. You'd just barely stepped into a compartment Luctus was, unfortunately, sat in. He'd called out to you and you turned calmly to face him, only to get a torrent of jabs at the way you were acting and how you looked.</p><p align="left">Your gaze hardened as a boy with combed hair put a hand on Luctus's shoulder, chiding him gently. You took the chance to leave, finding yourself in a compartment with only one other student. You narrowed your eyes at him, "May I sit here?"</p><p align="left">"Oh, uh, sure," the boy stammered, sitting up straight as you slid into the seat right across from him.</p><p align="left">You weren't impressed with the way he held himself already, and you hoped he wasn't a <em>Muggleborn</em> of all things. You stared at him, contemplative, but said nothing. You probably came off as a creep right now, but you could care less of what this boy thought of you. It was the important people you needed to impress, the ones who held a higher standing.</p><p align="left">"So, um... What's your name?"</p><p align="left">"Y/N Hayes, you?" You smoothed down your ruffled black hair and raised an eyebrow.</p><p align="left">"Harry Potter," he looked down, twiddling his thumbs.</p><p align="left">Okay, you take it back. This boy was important and if perhaps you could get on his good side, you'd gain some standing. Then, the door to the compartment slid open and in stepped a red-headed boy.</p><p align="left">"Anyone else sitting there?" he asked curiously and pointed to the seat beside you. "Everywhere else is full."</p><p align="left">Harry shook his head and the unfamiliar boy sat down, and you turned your head to look at him. You narrowed your eyes, about to say something, then got interrupted.</p><p align="left">"Hey, Ron." Two boys who looked identical came in, grins on their faces.</p><p align="left">"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there." One twin spoke.</p><p align="left">"Right," 'Ron' mumbled.</p><p align="left">"Harry," said the other twin, "did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then."</p><p align="left">"Bye," Harry and Ron both said, while you remained silent.</p><p align="left">You stayed silent as the twins left, then turned to look at Harry with some amusement, "Well, someone's popular around here."</p><p align="left">"So it seems," Harry mumbled.</p><p align="left">Ron looked curiously to Harry, eyes sparkling, "Are you really Harry Potter?"</p><p align="left">Harry nodded, and he continued, "Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes. And have you really got - you know..."</p><p align="left">He pointed to Harry's forehead, and you watched their exchange with amusement. You could tell they'd be good friends, and perhaps if you could become a 'friend' with Harry Potter, you'd hold some standing. You knew your family, as Death Eaters (former, or still Death Eaters? You shrugged this off), would despise the boy who had so easily defeated the Dark Lord. William and Luctus, you knew, already were set on becoming Death Eaters (William practically was one), while Ethan was a bit.. uncomfortable with the thought. Your mother and 'father' both had dark marks, and Genevieve hadn't an idea of what a Death Eater was.</p><p align="left">The exchange kept up until you were brought into it by Harry, "So, both of you, are all of your family wizards?"</p><p align="left">"Er - Yes, I think so," Ron spoke, "I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him."</p><p align="left">You nodded, "Yes. The Hayes family are Purebloods."</p><p align="left">"So you must know loads of magic already."</p><p align="left">You didn't respond to that and tuned out of the conversation, turning to look out the window. You watched as you sped past fields upon fields that held various animals of sizes and colors. You watched on with interest, oh how fast the train went. It was around 12:30 that a witch with a cart opened the door and asked if any of you need anything off the cart. You turned to Harry, who jumped up immediately, and ignored Ron's mumble as you slid past him. You admired the treats and paid for a few cauldron cakes, pumpkin pasties, and chocolate frogs.</p><p align="left">You snickered as Harry bought a multitude of things, and Ron looked to him, "Hungry, are you?"</p><p align="left">"Starving," Harry took a bite out of a pumpkin pasty, and you only smiled and took a bite of one of your own.</p><p align="left">Ron pulled out a package and sighed as he pulled one apart, "She always forgets I don't like corned beef."</p><p align="left">You tuned out once more as you snacked on the sweets you bought. You were pulled out of your own daydreaming as there was a knock on the door and a boy (rather round-faced) stepped in, looking like he was about to cry. You grimaced and looked to him, finishing off a chocolate frog. The boy looked to you and frowned, "Sorry, but have you seen a toad at all?"</p><p align="left">You all shook your heads and he practically wailed, making you cringe, "I've lost him! He keeps getting away from me!"</p><p align="left">You rolled your eyes as they tried to comfort him, and he left quickly. Ron sighed, "Don't know why he's so bothered. "If I'd brought a toad I'd lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk."</p><p align="left">"Obviously not."</p><p align="left">"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference,"Ron looked particularly disgusted. "I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look..."</p><p align="left">You watched curiously as he took out a wand, which looked battered and overall nearly <em>broken</em>. He just raised his wand when the door opened once more (you almost sighed), revealing a girl wearing her Hogwarts robes, "Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one."</p><p align="left">You grimaced at her frizzy hair and bossy tone, you already didn't like her.</p><p align="left">"We've already told him we haven't seen it," Ron frowned, but it was clear she wasn't listening to him, she was more focused on the wand in his hand than his words.</p><p align="left">"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then." She sat, and you frowned, she was rather rude.</p><p align="left">Ron looked a bit startled, "Er - all right."</p><p align="left">He cleared his throat and began, "Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow."</p><p align="left">Yet, nothing happened, you noted. Of course, you knew that wouldn't be a real spell ever, he'd have to use a legitimate one. The girl spoke in her whiny tone, "Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard - I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough - I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?"</p><p align="left">She spoke very quickly and you almost couldn't make sense of it. Ron shrunk down a bit, "I'm Ron Weasley."</p><p align="left">"Y/N Hayes."</p><p align="left">"Harry Potter," Harry sighed.</p><p align="left">"Are you really?" Hermione's eyes widened. "I know all about you, of course - I got a few extra books. for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century."</p><p align="left">"Am I?" Harry looked a bit dazed, but didn't say anything else of it.</p><p align="left">"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me. Do any of you know what house you'll be in? I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad.... Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon."</p><p align="left">"Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it," Ron sighed and threw his wand back into his trunk. "Stupid spell - George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud."</p><p align="left">"What house are your brothers in?" Harry questioned.</p><p align="left">"Gryffindor," said Ron, he seemed gloomy about it.</p><p align="left">"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin."</p><p align="left">"That's the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?"</p><p align="left">"Yeah," said Ron. He sighed and sat down in his seat once more.</p><p align="left">"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter," Harry spoke. "So what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?"</p><p align="left">You tuned out of this conversation. If you were brought back into it, so be it. You could care less about what the Weasley's did after school, after all, you were told that if you saw people with red hair, freckles, and tattered hand-me-downs, they were Weasley's. You were pulled out of it when three boys entered, and you looked up at them.</p><p align="left">"Is it true?" he asked. "They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?"</p><p align="left">"Yes," Harry replied, looking at the boys on the left and right of the other.</p><p align="left">"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle," the boy motioned to them, then himself. "And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy."</p><p align="left">Ron coughed, causing Draco to look at him. "Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford." He turned back to Harry. "You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."</p><p align="left">He held out a hand to Harry, and you assumed he hadn't seen you yet as he hadn't as much as cast a glance in your direction. You carelessly opened a chocolate frog and pulled out the card, "Drat, I got Dumbledore again."</p><p align="left">Draco shot you a glance of recognition, but looked back to Harry, who replied, "I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."</p><p align="left">"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter," he spoke slowly, as if to prove a point. "Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you."</p><p align="left">This made Ron and Harry both stand, but you remained seated and watched the exchange with amusement. Ron looked positively furious, and Harry... you couldn't explain the look on his face.</p><p align="left">"Say that again," Ron seethed, face red.</p><p align="left">"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?" Draco sneered, like a snotty little boy.</p><p align="left">"Unless you get out now," said Harry.</p><p align="left">"But we don't feel like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some," Draco smirked, and just the look on his face made you want to deck him.</p><p align="left">You watched a Goyle reached for a chocolate frog by Ron, who quickly lunged forward. Before he even reached the boy, Goyle let out a yell (what a pansy, you thought), and pulled back quickly to reveal Scabbers barely hanging onto his knuckle. You could see the blood welling up from where he'd just been bit, and you watched as he swung Scabbers around. The three left as soon as Scabbers hit the window, and of course, Granger had to come in.</p><p align="left">"What has been going on?" Her gaze traveled to the sweets on the floor, and watched as Ron picked Scabbers up by his nasty pink tail.</p><p align="left">"I think he's been knocked out," Ron said to you both. He then seemed to examine Scabbers again. "No - I don't believe it - he's gone back to sleep-"</p><p align="left">You snickered at Ron and the rat, looking to Granger. Then he questioned Harry about Malfoy, but you kept out of the conversation. When he turned to Hermione and questioned if she needed something, she only scoffed, "You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't been fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!"</p><p align="left">"Scabbers has been fighting, not us," Ron scowled. "Would you mind leaving while we change?"</p><p align="left">"All right - I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors," Hermione sniffed, making you narrow your eyes at her. "And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?"</p><p align="left">With that, she left, leaving Ron behind to glare after her. You all took off your jackets to put your robes on, and you peered out the window after doing so. A voice echoed through the train, soon enough, startling you, "We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately."</p><p align="left">You all put the rest of your sweets in your pockets and joined the crown within the corridor. You felt like there were butterflies in your stomach, with how nervous you were. But you shouldn't be nervous at all, you huffed. Finally, the train slowed down, and then stopped. The crowd pushed it's way to get out of the train, and you followed after Ron and Harry. There was a lamp bobbing over the heads of everyone, and you thought the voice was vaguely familiar as it called out, "Firs' years! Firs' years over here! All right there, Harry?"</p><p align="left">You spotted the familiar face, he was the giant of a man that you'd seen inside the shop for pets. The man was herding all the first years up, you noticed, "C'mon, follow me - any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!"</p><p align="left">You all followed after the man, slipping on the wet ground in the darkness. You scoffed at the sniffling boy that had been asking around for his toad, trying to pretend it wasn't nearly silent on the way to wherever the tall man was taking you.</p><p align="left">"Ye' all get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec," The man called over his shoulder, "jus' round this bend here."</p><p align="left">Once you all rounded the bend, there was a loud 'Ohhh!' You tried to peer over the heads of the other first years, and spotted the large black lake. You grimaced, how would you be getting across that? Your question was answered by the sight of boats.</p><p align="left">"No more'n four to a boat!" You sighed, watching Ron and Harry get joined in their own boat by Hermione and Neville. You ended up sliding into a boat with two boys and a single girl. The first boy had short, cropped brown hair and tanned skin, his brown eyes peering curiously at you. The second had shaggy, dirty blond hair and a narrow face. His eyes were a unique shade of green, you noted. The girl had black hair held up by a ponytail, a round face, and dark skin. Her own brown eyes watched you closely, as if you were an unknown species.</p><p align="left">The first to speak up was the boy with brown hair, "'Ello! I'm Nixon Jones. What's your name?"</p><p align="left">He seemed friendly enough, you noted, "I'm Y/N Hayes. Pleasure to meet you."</p><p align="left">Nixon turned his gaze to the blond boy, who seemed to be one of his friends. He twiddled his thumbs nervously and looked up at you through his big-rimmed glasses, "My name is, uh, Vincent. Vincent Evans. Nice to meet you."</p><p align="left">You looked to the girl with a raised eyebrow, but she answered with a clipped tone, "Taylor Cooper."</p><p align="left">"Nice to meet you all," you answered as the boat reached a shoreline, gazing up to the large castle that was Hogwarts.</p><p align="left">You all climbed out of the boat and you looked around for Harry and Ron, eventually spotting them by toad-boy and Granger, as you ever-so affectionately dubbed them. You said a quick goodbye to the three and sprinted over to the boys, who greeted you quietly.</p><p align="left">You all ended up grouping with all the other first years and made your way up a path to a large oak door. You studied it and narrowed your eyes, then looked to the large man.</p><p align="left">"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?"</p><p align="left">He raised one of his giant fists and knocked on the door three times. It flung open and there stood a (clearly) old woman, swathed in emerald green robes with an expression that demanded obedience.</p><p align="left">"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall," the tall man inclined his head towards the ragtag group of first years behind him.</p><p align="left">"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here," Professor McGonagall beckoned you along, and you all made your way behind her, looking at the torch-lit walls with wonder and listening to the tap tap of your feet on the stone floor. There was a distant murmur of voices, you noticed, from what sounded like thousands upon thousands of people, though you knew it was a lesser number.</p><p align="left">You were all led into an empty chamber, where Professor McGonagall turned and began speaking.</p><p align="left">"Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.</p><p align="left">"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours."</p><p align="left">She paused for a minute, looking at all the first years, then began again.</p><p align="left">"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as much as you can while you are waiting."</p><p align="left">"I shall return when we are ready for you," McGonagall looked at you all. "Please wait quietly."</p><p align="left">She left the chamber, leaving you all to your decides.</p><p align="left">"How exactly do they sort us into houses?" you heard Harry question.</p><p align="left">"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking."</p><p align="left">You snorted, looking to the two, "They put a hat atop your head, and that's how. My brothers, Luctus and Ethan, said the same thing as your brother. But my eldest brother, William, told me of the hat. He didn't elaborate, but I'm sure you'll be fine."</p><p align="left">There was a collection of screams from the back and you turned to look at all the commotion.</p><p align="left">"What the -?" Harry gasped. So everyone around you all.</p><p align="left">You watched as a large group of ghosts streamed through the wall, seeming to be arguing with each other. You listened intently to the conversation, not even the least phased by this. William had told you of the ghosts in Hogwarts, and how they meant little harm.</p><p align="left">"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance -"</p><p align="left">"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost - I say, what are you all doing here?"</p><p align="left">Everyone remained silent, you noticed, so you said nothing either. You only have the ghosts a bored look.</p><p align="left">"New students!" said 'Friar', as he smiled at all the students. "About to be Sorted, I suppose?"</p><p align="left">A few people nodded in response.</p><p align="left">"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!" said the Friar. "My old house, you know."</p><p align="left">"Move along now," came the sharp voice of McGonagall. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to start."</p><p align="left">Professor McGonagall had just come back. One by one, you noticed, the ghosts floated right on through the wall. Perks of being a ghost, you supposed.</p><p align="left">"Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall ordered, "and follow me."</p><p align="left">You all got into a single file line, and you ended up behind a girl with short brown hair. Professor McGonagall led you all out into a large hall, and you noticed various students within the line stare up at the ceiling with the dark night sky and the twinkling stars above your heads. You heard Granger whisper faintly, "Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History."</p><p align="left">You were stopped, and tried to ignore all the eyes on the first years and the murmurs of older students. You watched closely as McGonagall pulled out a stool with four legs and set it down, then put a tattered old wizard's hat on it. The students sitting at their tables all stared intently at the hat, so you did as well.</p><p align="left">Then, a rip on it opened wide, causing you to raise an eyebrow. So it had a mouth, did it? You listened as it sung it's tune, and once done, the students in the Hall clapped loudly. You clapped quietly, not too impressed by the song, and you were sure even the older students clapping wildly weren't either. Then, McGonagall stepped forward with a roll of parchment, "When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to<br/> be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!"</p><p align="left">A girl with blonde pigtails scurried out of the line and had the hat placed on her head, which fell down over her eyes, and sat down. There was a long pause, and then, "HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat.</p><p align="left">The table on the right cheered for the girl, and you watched as she stumbled over to sit down at the Hufflepuff table.</p><p align="left">"Bones, Susan!"</p><p align="left">"HUFFLEPUFF!" The hat shouted once more, and Susan went off to sit by Hannah.</p><p align="left">"Boot, Terry!"</p><p align="left">"RAVENCLAW!"</p><p align="left">The table second from the left was cheering this time, and you watched as a handful of students stood and shook his hand. That was the house you were expected to go in, you noted. Mandy Brocklehurst went to Ravenclaw too, but Lavender Brown became the first new Gryffindor student, and the table on the far left erupted into cheers and clapping.</p><p align="left">Millicent Bulstrode then became the first Slytherin, and you watched as the table cheered for the newcomer.</p><p align="left">"Cooper, Taylor!"</p><p align="left">"SLYTHERIN!"</p><p align="left">"Evans, Vincent!"</p><p align="left">"SLYTHERIN!"</p><p align="left">"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!"</p><p align="left">"HUFFLEPUFF!"</p><p align="left">"Finnigan, Seamus!"</p><p align="left">"GRYFFINDOR!"</p><p align="left">"Granger, Hermione!"</p><p align="left">You watched with distaste, hoping to whatever higher power was out there that she wasn't sorted into Ravenclaw.</p><p align="left">"GRYFFINDOR!"</p><p align="left">You let out a breath of relief.</p><p align="left">"Hayes, Y/N!"</p><p align="left">You jogged over to the stool and sat patiently, staring out at the sea of students. It had just barely touched your head when it shouted, "SLYTHERIN!"</p><p align="left">You froze and sat there for a moment, standing up and slowly making your way over to the table. You glanced over to the Ravenclaw table, finding William who looked like the blood had drained out of his face. Luctus and Ethan both exchanged glances and looked to you fearfully. You frowned in confusion and sat by Vincent and Taylor, Vincent greeting you anxiously and Taylor only gave you a nod.</p><p align="left">"Jones, Nixon!"</p><p align="left">"SLYTHERIN!"</p><p align="left">There were quite a few Slytherin students this year, you noticed, and waved Nixon over. You and the other three watched with amusement as Neville Longbottom was sorted into Gryffindor, and almost took the Sorting Hat with him. Then came Malfoy, who, like you, became a Slytherin. He and Parkinson sat near you and the other three with Crabbe and Goyle. There were various other students that came up, and then you heard, "Potter, Harry!"</p><p align="left">You watched anxiously, hoping he would join your table. He was your friend, right? It would be helpful if you were in the same house. After what felt like forever, the hat shouted out, "GRYFFINDOR!"</p><p align="left">You sighed in disappointment and watched him take off the hat, and shakily walk to the Gryffindor table. There were a few more names called out, and you watched Ron get into Gryffindor, just like the rest of his family. Then, Dumbledore stood up and looked out at everyone, "Welcome. Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!"</p><p align="left">He sat back down and you turned to look at all the food that appeared, mouth watering. You stacked food on your plate and got into some idle chat with everyone at your table, "I'm guessing you wanted to be Slytherin, Malfoy?"</p><p align="left">"Obviously. My whole family has, and always will be, Slytherin. You're an odd ball out of your family, though," he snickered to himself.</p><p align="left">"Whatever you say, Malfoy. I doubt my mother will care much, she's doesn't expect as much from me as my father." You lied smoothly through your teeth as you took a bite of mashed potatoes.</p><p align="left">It seemed Malfoy fell for it (you'd become a master at lying because of your brothers and father), so you continued to eat. Soon enough, you'd finished off your food and drink and dabbed at your mouth with a napkin. You turned and looked out longingly at the Gryffindor table, it wasn't that you wanted to be in the house, but you did want to be close enough to Harry. He had students all over him - metaphorically - and if you could gain such a high standing, well... Yes. You looked to Malfoy, and decided getting on his good side would work as well.</p><p align="left">It was when the dessert faded away that you stopped speaking with Malfoy and the others. You were rather sleepy, but it didn't matter much, now, you supposed. Your attention was caught by Dumbledore quickly after, though.</p><p align="left">"Ahem - just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well."</p><p align="left">Dumbledore's gaze glanced in the direction of the two twins from earlier.</p><p align="left">"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch. And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death."</p><p align="left">You exchanged glances with Vincent and Nixon, who looked nervous by that announcement. Dumbledore then cried out, "And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!"</p><p align="left">You glanced back at the other teachers as Dumbledore flicked his wand, and noticed their smiles were rather strained. Then, the singing began. A lot of it was off-key (on purpose with some), and you just kept your mouth glued shut. Yeah, you weren't joining in on this mess.</p><p align="left">Finally, everyone finished, aside from the Weasley twins, but Dumbledore kept conducting them. You sighed in annoyance, "Ah, music," he wiped his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!"</p><p align="left">The Slytherin prefects all gathered you up and began leading you to the Slytherin common room. How fun, you noted, that it was down in the cold dungeons. You looked to Malfoy, listening to the murmurs of the other students. The moment you found your dorms and bed, you checked to make sure your items were all there, then collapsed on the bed and fell asleep.</p>
