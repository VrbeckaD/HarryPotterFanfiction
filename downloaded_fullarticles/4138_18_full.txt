    <p>The brat arrived for his detention and looked around for what he was supposed to be doing curiously, his wild black hair and glowing green eyes alluring in a way that no one else could see. The Dark Lord still wanted him dead but Severus had convinced him to give him the brat. Potter belonged to him now all thanks to Dumbledore's plans to kill him and the discovery of his brat's home life. Things that the Dark Lord would be informed of once his brat was properly bound to him.</p><p>The potion he set in front of his brat was old, old enough that it was mostly forgotten. Once it was used for unbreakable marriages but it also had the nice little side effect of purging controlling magics and potions from the drinker. He had seen the Weasley chit slipping his brat potions. It was because of that that he went out of his way to send a diagnostic at his brat's back during one of his many detentions. What he had found in his brat's system was enough to enrage him.</p><p>Potter was nearly swimming in loyalty potions, love potions, and control potions. They had half killed his fragile damaged body with how often they had been dosing him. The only good thing that came from it was the immunity build up in his system for those types of potions. That and the rediscovery of the marriage contract between he and his brat courtesy of Lily via the rather old diagnostic spell he had used to check his brat in the first place. Once he found who had obliviated that little tidbit from his memory they would pay dearly for it, <i>after</i> they had explained exactly how they had hidden it from his normal Occlumency exercises.</p><p>His brat glared at him in defiance, refusing to look at the potion. Except, Severus could see the desperate longing and weary exhaustion radiating from his unaware fiance, the need for limits and for cuddles and care. His brat would receive all of that and more. Healing the damage done to his brat's body over so long would take time and might never be complete, just as breaking the suicidal mental conditioning would take time.</p><p>"Drink," Severus ordered flatly. He watched the defiance spark in his brat's eye. Good, he wasn't broken yet. His brat would be tamed by him alone but breaking was never his intention.</p><p>"Why?" His brat was being defiant tonight.</p><p>"Because the alternative is letting Dumbledore force the students to fight and die against fully trained Death Eaters. The old fool expects you to walk to your own death while leading the others in battle and it was near impossible to talk either side into accepting this potential solution," Severus informed him flatly. He didn't like how his brat flinched as if physically struck by his answer. Dumbledore or someone else had a lot to answer for in regards to his brat.</p><p>"What will it do?" Harry asked wearily, finally looking down at the potion in resignation.</p><p>"It will bind you to me while clearing out any magic not your own from your body, mind, and core. Neither side wanted to give you up and both sides refused to simply leave you alone as I have ties to both sides this was a compromise that they grudgingly accepted. There will be rules but I will not mistreat you," Severus promised almost gently. It had been a months long fight to get both sides to agree to this and he would enjoy informing them that they hadn't gained more control over Harry, they had lost it utterly to <i>him</i>.</p><p>Harry gave a heavy sigh before shrugging and downing the potion. Severus barely caught him as the powerful sedative kicked in. His brat almost immediately started sweating foreign potions which quickly soaked through his clothes. Severus wasted no time in conjuring a bath around the drain and emergency shower in the lab they were standing in. An ongoing warming charm was shot at the shower head so that his brat wouldn't catch a cold during the upcoming constant washing to get rid of the expelled potion residue.</p><p>It took hours to get rid of the last of the potion laced sweat and clean his brat properly. He knew without the added sedative from his own special blend of the potion his brat would have been screaming as the potion worked to purge the other potions. He could feel the mental bond unfurling between the two of them as the binding portion took hold. A feral smile graced his lips, his brat had apparently wanted him for quite a while now with only his so called friends and the potions keeping his brat from trying something. It was just as well since while he was currently at the age of consent his brat still thought that he was underage. That was something that hadn't been true since that damnable goblet had spat out his brat's name in fourth year. At least he had managed to keep anyone from taking to much advantage of his brat. It had been quiet the relief when Harry had taken Lovegood to the yule ball as a friend.</p><p>Once cleaned, the ruined clothes destroyed via house elf, and dressed in one of Severus' own night shirts Harry was put to bed in Severus' bedroom. A number of spells were used on the door to keep anyone from finding his prize or letting his brat escape before they could talk.</p><p>A very formal request for a meeting was written up and sent to both Dumbledore and Voldemort respectively. Severus just had to wait for a response. He had very clearly outlined that the meeting would include members of both sides. He clearly stated that this meeting was going to be neutral territory, and that he would be providing information important to both sides. He also made it clear that both leaders would attend or the meeting would not happen at all. Each respective message contained special codes to provide authenticity and a confirmation that he could not relay the information without both leaders present. Lily deserved that much and his brat deserved even more. For the sake of Harry and Lily both he would try to end this war before the students were dragged into the mess the way Harry had been.</p><p>Sounds coming from his bedroom told him that he needed to check on his brat. Severus was somewhat surprised at what he found when he entered the bedroom. The swirling vortex of emotion fueled magic while interesting wasn't really that much of a surprise, no it was the blank pain radiating off of his brat that bothered him. The older man sighed before entering the magical maelstrom while using his own magic to both shield from the storm and cut through the currents of magic mixed with debris to scoop his brat into his arms for a cuddle. Five minutes of cuddling calmed the magical vortex to more of a floating whirlpool of objects and agitated magics.</p><p>"You are mine now and I have no intention of allowing you to be harmed or taken from me. Tomorrow we will go somewhere with both Dumbledore and the Dark Lord, both will be informed of this fact as well as several other facts. I will exert my rights and ensure that they can not harm you again. Of your friends I have only been able to confirm that Longbottom and Lovegood have had no <i>excessive</i> outside influence in being your friends. The Weasley twins have not been checked because they are currently out of reach. Ronald and Hermione were co-opted by Dumbledore and Molly Weasley in guiding and protecting you in accordance with Dumbledore's plan which would have eventually killed you. While it is not their fault you will need to adjust to their lack of presence. Ginerva has been slipping you love potions and will not be allowed near you under any circumstances. Do you have any questions?" Severus informed him softly.</p><p>"I... need time. Someone kept obliviating me and... this is a big change," Harry admitted even as he unconsciously curled tight against the potions master.</p><p>"Another violation to add to the list," Severus muttered darkly. "While you are thinking know that I ended the Occlumency lessons so that I would no longer be required to rip into your mind. The situation was... less than ideal and it was doing more harm than good."</p><p>"You don't hate me?" Harry asked after feeling at their new bond for a good twenty minutes.</p><p>"No but the appearance of it gave you a shield of protection. Rest, we will discuss more later," Severus ordered softly. Harry nodded in tired agreement before allowing exhaustion to sweep away his mind while the Dungeon Bat held him close. They stayed like that till the next morning.</p><p>The two woke the next morning wrapped around each other. Severus took a moment for a proper look at Harry's selection of clothes before wordlessly selecting something of his own to dress his brat in. Harry went to protest but a sharp look and an adjustment spell ensured that not only would Harry wear Severus' choice but that it would fit.</p><p>"These are more akin to rags than clothes, brat. Your school uniforms will clearly need replacing soon along with everything else, most of which should just be burned. The hand knit sweaters are an exception as is the invisibility cloak. The knot patterns in the sweaters are old protective magic but I will want the goblins to check them for anything I can't read in the magics before you wear them again. For this meeting you need to be presentable and able to move freely. The protective magics especially woven into my robes will give you minimal protection if spells start flying or someone finds a way to poison the refreshments I will pay for," Severus informed him flatly before turning towards his own clothing selection for the day.</p><p>"Alright, I wanted new clothes anyway," Harry conceded tightly.</p><p>It wasn't the clothes Harry objected to but the implied need of them. He knew that his non-school clothes were practically falling apart but he didn't usually have a choice in the matter with how the Dursleys treated him. He had been forced to make do ever since he could remember and offers like actual new clothes or extra food had often been used before to cruelly taunt him by his relatives.</p><p>"Come, you need to eat," Severus instructed brusquely, providing a bit of normality with his tone and causing his brat to relax a bit as they took turns getting ready for the day.</p><p>Severus might not want to subject his brat to the Great Hall but it was important to keep up a sense of normality so that no one would suspect anything was wrong. Harry proved his understanding of the unspoken instructions and reasons with a stiff nod and a mask of teenage petulance covering his watchful thoughtfulness of earlier. He had no trouble trailing after the potions master in the direction of the breakfast tables and making it look like nothing unusual. They had come to a silent agreement that Severus would collect Harry when it was time to go, both understanding that they had to arrive at the meeting place early for everything to go smoothly.</p><p>The Potions Master knew that there was a quietly building explosion within his brat. It was rather to be expected after the magic purge. Yet as long as Harry stayed quiet and compliant Severus' fear of what exactly Harry was having to assimilate and understand grew. The explosion was building and he had every plan to collect the pieces afterwards, to prove that his brat could trust him, but he already knew that the blow up would be spectacular. He just hoped it wouldn't happen when they were still vulnerable at  or before the meeting.</p><p>"Good morning Severus," Filius greeted him cheerfully.</p><p>Severus grunted his usual greeting in return. He refused to give away that he had already received his first cup of morning tea from the elves while Harry washed up. It was always the little things that gave a person away. Instead he set himself up for his normal breakfast while watching Harry carefully sit near the head table and dish up his own breakfast. A breakfast that was small enough to make Severus frown outright. His brat wasn't eating enough. Another thing to add to the list or rather upgrade on the list, neglect of proper nutrition to outright evidence of starvation and a slow recovery at that.</p><p>Breakfast passed in relative normality with the exception of neither Dumbledore nor Harry's friends attending. At a guess Dumbledore was doing early morning paperwork under Minerva's stern eye and eating at his desk. Granger was invariably in the library researching something or other to torture her teachers with via her school work. While the Weasleys were likely still sleeping as it was the weekend. This would make their escape much easier.</p><p>Just as Severus was finishing up his own breakfast two owls arrived confirming the meeting, easing his first official worry of the morning. His collection of his brat would cause the rest of the school to believe that Harry had earned a Saturday detention with the Potions Master. Said fictional detention would keep everyone not involved with the upcoming meeting unaware of what the two wizards were actually doing.</p><p>"Potter, finish up, those ingredients won't collect themselves," Snape called out, purposefully allowing his voice to echo across the hall as he finished his third cup of morning tea. Harry shot him an appropriately resigned look mixed with stubbornness before turning to finish his meager half plate of food and downing his juice.</p><p>"What did young Mister Potter do this time?" Pamona Sprout asked in open amusement.</p><p>"The little miscreant found my quarters and attempted to booby trap my front room with several pranks after hours. I caught him and made him sleep on the couch since it was near two in the morning. Thanks to that elf that likes him this morning I found that most of his clothes are close to being rags, which is why he is in some of my clothes. He thinks we are going into the forest to collect potion ingredients after I make him carry things for my errand in Diagon. I am actually making him get new clothes and some of the beginner books he never had for my class. The next five detentions I assign him will be used to copy from those books. Depending on how things stand he will find himself spending a great deal of time with me, either working to pay me back for the clothes or reading those books. I may even draft him to grade some of the younger year homework," Severus explained the cover story with obvious relish. He had had rather a lot of fun coming up with something that would explain away Harry's early morning presence in the dungeons.</p><p>"Do see about getting him new glasses and taking him to the goblins would you? Albus refuses to listen to me about getting him looked at by a full healer and I've found myself missing memories in regards to his treatment. Thankfully the monitoring charms in the infirmary don't seem to have been tampered with," Poppy Pomphrey requested quietly. Pamona, Filius, and Madam Pince murmured quiet agreement while rest of the staff remained mostly oblivious due lack of attention, lack of presence, lack of coffee, and/or lack of sleep.</p><p>"I shall look into it," Severus answered equally quietly. His gut told him that he would <i>not</i> like whatever was uncovered but that the exam by a goblin healer was going to be very necessary. "Any other requests? We might as well make a day of it."</p><p>"Just take care of Mr. Potter. Tell the goblin teller that you were sent by me to see Gornack. Explain that the situation falls under the Dumbledore file and that I am claiming Gon-Yu, instructor, rights for Mr. Potter," Filius said gravely.</p><p>"Will that interfere with any marriage contracts or similar bonds?" Severus asked cautiously, tensing in unconscious worry.</p><p>"What have you done?" Filius asked levelly.</p><p>"An old bonding potion last night and before that a marriage contract arranged by Lily as a protective measure that someone obliviated from my memory, recently rediscovered," Severus admitted. He masked his roiling emotions by pouring another cup of tea and doctoring it.</p><p>"What else?" Poppy asked lightly, as if they were discussing the weather. Severus' shoulders momentarily slumped in defeat before squaring in stubborn defiance.</p><p>"Both Albus and the Dark Lord will be informed of the bonding at a meeting this afternoon and put on notice to leave my brat alone," Severus told them all bluntly.</p><p>"I'll pull all of the bonding books from the shelves for cleaning and repair. Are the three of you going with the rascals or is one of you going to help me play keep away with the information? Including what our dear Severus hasn't bothered voicing," Irma Pince asked calmly, pouring herself another cup of tea and doctoring it.</p><p>"I have to go with them but it will let me claim greater rights under goblin law," Filius said thoughtfully as he folded up his napkin only to place it on his empty plate which promptly disappeared courtesy of the house elves.</p><p>"Mr. Dobbson is in the infirmary with nasty side effects from a mix of pranks and some magical bug. As Severus is obviously going to be handling Mr. Potter I'll have copies of both their files ready for you to pick up on your way out Filius," Poppy told them with a grimace at her patient's condition.</p><p>"I could do with a few more plants for the seventh years but I can't come with you. A few of the older Ravenclaws tried to steal a clipping or two of plants I have guarded by a tangle vine. I left them there as punishment, just out of reach of the creeping dragon lilys and the sunburst tubers," Pamona sighed in obvious regret.</p><p>"Wh..what!?" Severus stammered, looking at them in outright shock.</p><p>"Did you really think we didn't pay attention? That we didn't care? That we weren't aware of what Dumbledore has been demanding of you? Severus about half the long term staff see you as a son or other beloved family member that joined us in teaching. The same goes for Mr. Potter except that he is still a student. The only reasons we haven't been acting like it for either of you are that it is unprofessional, Albus interfered, and you never ask for help," Irma Pince explained in open amusement. "Your surly attitude got us to leave you alone but it hardly stopped us from caring."</p><p>Severus swore quietly under his breath, much to their joint amusement.</p><p>"Finish your tea dear, Filius will meet the two of you in the entrance hall shortly," Poppy said in clear amusement, patting his black clad arm in consolation as she headed back to the infirmary. Filius scurried after her on his short legs for his own quick trip to pick up the medical files and a summoning charm on his lips for his cloak.</p><p>Harry joined Snape as he left the Great Hall to wait in the Entrance Hall for the part goblin professor.</p><p>"You okay?" Harry asked in a low quiet voice. "I could feel your shock across the bond."</p><p>"Some of the other staff are... more perceptive than I believed. Professor Flitwick will be joining us on our outing and will likely attend the meeting representing the other staff members," Severus answered in an equally quiet voice. "Several items have been added to today's agenda as a result."</p><p>Harry grunted in acknowledgement but didn't comment further as they waited for the undersized professor. Flitwick joined them quickly and they were gone before most any of the other students could notice.</p><p>The trip to Diagon Alley was uneventful aside from the two teachers learning first hand how badly Harry dealt with floo travel. It was when they got to Gringotts that things got interesting. The first thing Harry noticed was the extra attention that the goblins paid to Professor Flitwick. The second thing he noticed was the protective way that Snape hovered just that much closer to him as they walked. The third was the double take that Griphook gave him when he nodded to the goblin in greeting. The final thing that cinched his suspicions that something odd was going on was the respectful bow Professor Flitwick was given by the teller. A short burst of gobbledygook later and they were quickly ensconced in a meeting room complete with refreshments.</p><p>"Mr. Potter do you know why we are at Gringotts today?" Flitwick asked kindly.</p><p>"No sir," Harry murmured respectfully.</p><p>"Clothes aren't the only thing you are going to need today. As such we are dealing with certain legalities before dealing with the meeting location. This includes checking on your vaults and status with the goblins and possibly filing changes in the various papers that are connected to that status. By going through the goblins we can avoid having to fill out most of the paper work ourselves by paying their staff to do it," Severus explained vaguely. "Part of this is going to be a health exam for you."</p><p>"For both of you," Flitwick corrected firmly. Harry fought not to giggle at Snape's immediate scowl. He was starting to regain his mental balance as long as he didn't think to hard about the sudden changes his life had experienced over the last 18 hours.</p><p>"Is it necessary?" Severus asked with a frown only to receive a firm nod in return. He huffed at the small professor, looking away petulantly, but didn't argue. This was for his brat after all and his instincts were practically screaming at him that the double exam was needed.</p><p>"I'd rather not if its all the same," Harry finally answered when he realized they were actually asking him instead of choosing for him like everyone else tended to do.</p><p>"Poppy, Madam Pomphrey, specifically requested it and it will tell me what I need to know to repair any injuries, past, present, or future," Severus coaxed. "She specifically believes that someone has deliberately tampered with your health but has been ordered not to look for anything that isn't normal for a healthy student."</p><p>"Harry we need to know if you are ill or poisoned or some other thing that will affect your health," Filius added kindly.</p><p>"It... won't make it into the papers? No one has to see it?" Harry asked hesitantly.</p><p>"The two of us need to see it immediately and possibly a few others but neither of us have any intention of letting the likes of Skeeter get their grubby hands on it or anyone else if you don't want them to. This is not for the scandal sheets or anything malicious, this is to keep you healthy," Severus assured him, a promise of protection and caring shining through his normally controlled mask.</p><p>Harry took a deep shuddering breath and reluctantly nodded his agreement. He still felt a bit numb, just like after Sirius died and he was isolated to almost no human contact over the summer. Looking at Snape warmed something inside him and kept both numbness and the Dementor like cold at bay. The bond link that had formed after taking the potion felt like a gentle warm banked fire in the back of his mind, promising protection and comfort. It was at that moment that he realized as long as he got to keep Snape and their new bond he really didn't care about the reasons and changes that the situation brought with it.</p><p>The door of the room opened to admit several goblins a few minutes later. Harry recognized Griphook among the group but decided to stay quiet and watchful. The goblins arranged themselves on the opposite side of the table from the three wand users. There was a burst of rapid gobbledygook which Flitwick joined in on that sounded fierce to Harry's ears and made his back teeth ache a bit before the four smaller beings reverted to English.</p><p>"Wand Warrior, we greet you and wish you further battle honors as the blood and gold of your enemies overflows at your feet," the lead goblin offered gruffly.</p><p>"I greet you Gornack and the clan of Gringotts, may honor overflow and drag the gold of your enemies from their blood soaked coffers to flow into your own clan's vaults. I come to your clan with two wizards, one is a proven warrior the other his new bonded with his own tales of battle. I request to claim them under the Urk-conYang practice. We also need for a healer to check them and to discuss what holdings you guard on their behalf," Flitwick told them formally. He had gone straight from the greeting into a business summary, wisely both wizards stayed quiet, allowing the diminutive Dueling Master to direct the negotiations.</p><p>"You understand what you ask?" Gornack demanded in obvious surprise.</p><p>"I do and per tradition I have not informed them of the requirements. I must admit that I have wanted to invoke the Rights for some time with both but have not had the chance until now," Flitwick informed the other goblin. This earned him a mix of reactions from confusion and suspicion on the parts of Harry and Severus respectively to excitement and interest on the part of the goblins.</p><p>"We will require memories and retelling of battles to judge the first stage of suitability for the Urk-conYang but the health check and the review of holdings can be done in the mean time. We will of course perform them in accordance with ritual law so that they will not be invalidated should your petition be accepted by the elders. You do understand your own requirements for coming to our clan rather than your own for the Urk-conYang?" Gornack asked gruffly.</p><p>"I do, yet there was no time. I only discovered full eligibility this morning and we may enter into battle this afternoon. My blood calls for this to be done before we enter the fray lest all goblins lose something more precious than blood and gold for our missed chance," Filius said firmly. "It is under the Mahk Tow Luc that I present this petition and under Jee Na Kin that neither of our clans lose honor over this matter. This matter is of clan importance and <i>must</i> not be lost."</p><p>"List the battles you know of for your Kinlo that would be suitable for this petition that they might provide their unaltered memories for the elders to view," Gornack ordered abruptly with a sharp nod of acceptance for the part goblin's explanation.</p><p>"I can not list battles for my eldest Kinlo but only testify that we spar regularly on equal terms and he survived being forced to Voldemort's service by an elder apprentice in his youth. His Masters are on record and he has long been accepted as one of your clan's brewers, bringing honor and gold to both of you. For my youngest Kinlo there have been tales of his single handed battle with a basilisk at 12, various battles with Voldemort, and his honorable performance in the Triwizard Tournament last year. I suspect that only they know what all battles they have fought though not all of them might have been with wand or blade," Filius informed them proudly. Both Harry and Severus were starting to wonder what exactly they had agreed to.</p><p>Gornack grunted before tapping a pattern into the designs on the table and revealing a pensive of great age with special designs neither wizard recognized.</p><p>"Place the battle memories within the viewing bowl that your petition might be judged," the goblin on the left instructed. All three complied after a quick set of instructions for Harry. The bowl disappeared, presumably off to the goblin elders for review.</p><p>"Kintow Flitwick of the Garnet Clan do you give permission for our healers to attend to your Kinlo? Do you also grant permission for their holdings to be reviewed not only in preparation for Urk-conYang but also that we may better know their worth?" Gornack asked formally.</p><p>"I do," Filius said firmly.</p><p>Before either bonded wizard could protest magic clamped down around them, stealing their breath from their very bones as a deep magical scan began. The scan was performed by the ancient runes that now glowed, embedded in the walls floor and ceiling of the room humming with powerful magic. It was over in under a minute, releasing the two temporary captives carefully, almost protectively, leaving a sense of protection around the pair as they recovered their equilibrium.</p><p>"I... It has been some time since the bank has reacted so... favorably to anyone much less protectively. I don't think even the elders get such a reaction..." Gornack said slowly and with obvious confusion.</p><p>"I wasn't aware that the Ward Mind had extended to include itself within the Diagon Alley branch building. I expected the more... sedate version of testing, something that required actual..." Filius never finished his shocked statement as the room was suddenly flooded with healers. Every single healer bore the goblin marking of a Clan Healer with most of the non-goblins bearing the variation indicating honorary status.</p><p>The babble of voices amounted to "I don't understand, I was going somewhere else". The room was instantly silenced by a high bright musical chime as an illusion formed over the table of a silver shifting geometric figure that stuck close to the shape of a crystal shard.</p><p>"Status Change: Match Found, Status Change: Damage Detected, Language Common: English, Mental Analysis Complete, Magical Analysis In Progress, System Request: Heal/Repair Unit - Kinlo Severus Tobias Snape Kin Flitwick Yee Garnet Lao Gringotts, System Request: Heal/Repair Unit - Kinlo Harry James Potter Kin Flitwick Yee Garnet Lao Gringotts, Records Review In Progress, System Request: Investigate Albus Percival Wulfirc Brian Dumbledore, System Request: Temporal Query - - - Temporal Query Complete, Dimensional Shift In Progress. Reorienting - - - Reorientation Complete... Message Play Back Delayed, Conclusion: Eligibility Requirements 4 of 9 Completed, Data Incomplete, Status Change: Provisional Authority Granted to Units Kintow Flitwick - Kinlo Snape - Kinlo Potter, Maintenance Required to Units Kinlo Snape and Kinlo Potter," the silver crystal sang.</p><p>"That sounded almost like a computer," Harry said into the dead silence of the room as he eyed the shifting, floating silver shard warily.</p><p>"Status Change: I Am Not An Idiot Protocol Activated, Control Lock One Released - - - Release Complete... Voice Protocols Released... Tardis Database Access Granted..." the crystal sang before they all heard the sound of a long yawn.</p><p>"What the bloody hell?" Severus muttered as they all continued to stare at the crystal.</p><p>"Emergency Response Status on Stand By, Gaia Magical Interface Online, Dimension 12 Modulator Online, Spectrum Power Sequences Within Acceptable Range, Wake Up Sequence Complete... ," the high crystal voice modulated into a lovely Contralto even as they listened, becoming less computer and more living being.</p><p>"Um, hello?" Harry greeted carefully.</p><p>"Just a second, I haven't finished reviewing the records from during my sleep," the contralto murmured from the crystal. "Okay so that guy got partial response from the Disaster Emergency Database in crude form. *snicker* He had to have tripped one of the more minimal security protocols to get stuck like that. Honestly calling the place a crystal cave? Well I suppose if one doesn't know what a crystalline molycirc <i>is</i> it could be mistaken for a pretty yet natural crystal formation. The species protection protocols held so that's good and... oh! I snagged access to a TARDIS! The Planetary Interface is good, so is the magical one aaand I have access to all the little seeds! Yus! Oh you guys have developed into adorable sentient magical buildings! No, stop that! I am not done checking the records, you can play with the training programs later. Yes, we can start screening and training some of your favorites, no, I don't care what species they are. Oh? Thank you dear, yes I needed those records. Hmm... Okay, I can see why your having trouble helping and training them. We will just have to work on that. What? No dear, I finally had enough power and found some people with enough of the genetic key to wake up. From the bloodline records of the magicals... huh. Well <i>that</i> is going to have to get fixed as soon as possible. All in all pretty good for a 6,000+ year long sleep."</p><p>"Um, who are you?" Harry asked warily. "What are you?"</p><p>"I am old. I was set here as a guardian of sorts but I found that once I evicted the nasty invading dimensional demon army that the beings living on this world that were left needed me to go to sleep so they could grow. This also had the added bonus of dropping my power levels so that more nasty things didn't hurt you when they came looking for me. I was hidden well enough that they didn't even know I was here or I would never have woken up and most of your world if not all of it would instead be slagged rock, ash, and dust. The danger is mostly passed and you all are old enough as a species that I can talk to you without accidentally hurting you now or you should be. As for my name... it translates roughly to Crystal Rain on Mounted Dragon Flight," the crystal informed them with obvious amusement. "Just go about your business and let the Healers check the two of you over. Some of my scans of you both show some nasty damage. If I had been more awake I wouldn't have diverted most of the Healers here and instead narrowed it down a bit better. Sorry about that."</p><p>"That's okay... I guess?" Harry answered back.</p><p>"Excuse me, I have a naughty magical building to go scold. Honestly encouraging <i>Necromancy</i> of all things! Your world's Guardian of the Dead is still sleeping. Messing about with the dead is a no no for a reason!" the crystal huffed before sinking into the table and fading away.</p><p>"That was... strange," Harry said in obvious confusion. His words shook most of the room back into wakefulness as the healers immediately focused on something they not only understood but was a part of their jobs. Two of the six people in front of them were hurt and needed treatment, that trumped any strange magical entity waking up no matter how old it was. The healers as one turned on the six who had already been in the room and advanced, pulling all of them into impromptu medical exams with many spluttering protests from their victims.</p><p>Three hours after the crystal mind went looking for the naughty Necromancy building the Healers finally finished the health checks of their six victims. It had been quickly discovered that the most any of the four with goblin heritage had was a minor cold that was easily fixed. Harry and Severus on the other hand were another matter entirely.</p><p>"Six blocks! <i>SIX!</i> On a still growing magical core no less!" the senior healer ranted to her fellows.</p><p>"Potion Master Snape has three blocks of his own but the amount of Dark magic damage and nervous system damage because of over exposure to the Cruciartus almost make up for his lack of matching blocks," the second most senior healer snarled.</p><p>"Potter has <i>Basilisk Venom</i> and <i>Phoenix Tears</i> of all things in his blood!" the senior healer growled. "There's even evidence they've been in his blood since he was twelve! <i>TWELVE!</i> Who the hell faces a Basilisk at that age?!"</p><p>"They both show signs of malnutrition and some of it is fairly new with Potter, not to mention the <i>scars</i> on both of them!" the second senior healer agreed with his own growl of fury. "The scars are a clear mix of torture, abuse, and ones from honorable combat."</p><p>"The <i>thing</i> in Potter's famous rune scar resonates with the blasted brand, the Dark Mark. I don't know that we can do anything with those two marks or the second scar on Potter that mimics the brand. We need more time," the senior healer muttered, glaring alternately at the Dark Mark on Snape's left forearm and Harry's lightning bolt scar.</p><p>"We need a Curse Breaker, a Rune Master, an Ancient Lore Master, a Potions Master, three separate purified ritual rooms, six months, and enough ritual and/or potion ingredients to drain a vault or two. Of course if we could get our hands on the <i>idiot</i> who's magical signature matches the three marks it would make half that unnecessary. We'd also be able to narrow the treatments down to the <i>normal</i> nasty stuff and damage we've found," the second senior healer retorted.</p><p>Harry and Snape would have been watching the raging healers in a mix of wariness and hunted defensiveness had they not been knocked out by the very same healers early on in the exam. </p><p>"What evidence have the healers found for their battle prowess?" Gornack asked the glaring healers formally.</p><p>"Spell damage and scars from battles Potion Master Snape should not have survived," the senior healer recited formally. "Where as Mr. Potter show signs of Basilisk Venom and Phoenix Tears within his blood as well as various scars from varying forms of combat and torture on both of them. Both have been fighting under restrictions from illegally placed magical blocks. Neither will be released from our care until the blocks are fully removed due to the life threatening nature of the blocks. We have also found evidence of potions and compulsions which they have nearly succeeded in destroying on their own."</p><p>"<i>I</i> don't want to let them go until we've fixed most of what we found," the second senior healer muttered rebelliously. He was ignored in part because they all were now aware of the fact that the exam was technically a part of the Urk-conYang ritual. They would be able to lay their hands on their unexpected patients again later if they had to but none of the assembled healers liked the idea of letting the pair loose.</p><p>"I have received word from the Elders, the Lore Masters, and the Farseers. Not only is Urk-conYang granted they are to be schooled in <i>all</i> traditions, trained as Masters in our ways, asked to pass through the Fires of Change, and pass the Dance of Blooded Blades. They are to be trained as <i>Battle Masters!</i> Kinlo Potter is embroiled in a Prophecy now that is mostly complete but the Farseers have found a new one which calls for both of them. Wand Warrior, you have brought a fine addition to not only the clans of Garnet and Gringotts but to all our peoples. The final word is that they are now Kinlo Kun," Gornack informed the room, stunning them all into speechlessness.</p><p>"It has been centuries since a Kinlo Kun has been declared and far more since <i>two</i> were declared," Flitwick muttered in shock before turning proud eyes on the two unconscious wizards.</p><p>"Wand Warrior, father them well. When they have passed through the final phase of Urk-conYang you and your bonded children will be the first of a new clan and as such belong to all clans," Gornack stated proudly.</p><p>"I swear to you on the blood of my line that I have every intention of doing just that," Flitwick swore, sealing the promise with a slice across his palm and a small stream of blood landing on the floor. Magic flared around him, sealing the cut and the promise in a band of power that faded to a light green stripe across the palm of his hand where the cut had been.</p><p>"We will see what name your new clan will earn in the coming days," Gornack grunted in satisfaction.</p><p>"Can we remove the blocks now?" the senior healer demanded darkly.</p><p>"By all means and be sure to record the caster's signature, this offense can only be settled with blood," Filius agreed, equally darkly.</p><p>They wasted no time in stripping the dangerous magical blocks from their patients. The increase in power for both unconscious wizards flooded the room and nearly doubled their presence of power. It also just happened to burn through the sleeping draughts they had been given earlier.</p><p>"My head hurts," Harry groaned as his newly released magic forced a rapid burn through of the potion.</p><p>"That would be the dehydration," Severus muttered in agreement as he fought to keep his stomach on the inside and his head from spinning.</p><p>"Yes, that can happen when your body decides to forcibly burn through a strong dose of sleeping draught in seconds after you've already slept through half of it at the normal rate," the senior healer agreed dryly. They were both handed water which was sipped cautiously but still quickly decimated.</p><p>"Who placed the blocks on my sons?" Filius demanded darkly, causing the two wizards to briefly choke on their water in shock. The rest of the room ignored it in favor of finding out who their first targets were.</p><p>"For Kinlo Kun Snape one block was done by a Ministry appointee, one was done by an unauthorized Auror, and the last was placed illegally by Albus Dumbledore. All blocks should have been removed within six months of casting the first one. For Kinlo Kun Potter each block was placed at different ages by Albus Dumbledore. Because the blocks remained for too long on both of them there is some scaring on their magical pathways," the senior healer informed them flatly. "Unless it is a matter of survival they are not to use their magic until next week. The <i>only</i> reason I am not dragging them down to the Healer's Wing and keeping them there for the next <i>month</i> for the block removal alone is because you have promised me that they will have warriors with them. Don't you dare think that simply because their meeting is of clan importance that they aren't to be in the Healer's Wing by morning, if not sooner!"</p><p>"We understand Healer," Filius agreed. "I will ensure the attendance of my sons as best as possible."</p><p>"See that you do. Those blasted blocks were hardly the only thing medically wrong with them. It wouldn't surprise me in the least if some of what we <i>did</i> find is hiding something else altogether even more nasty," the senior healer scowled, echoed by the other healers in the room. With that the healers trooped out of the room with many glances sent back at their primary patients.</p><p>"I don't like the sound of that," Harry said softly.</p><p>"Nor do I," Severus agreed with a grimace as he quickly finished off his third cup  of water, the goblet having magically refilled on its own twice already.</p><p>A quick consult with Severus and a sly unspecific offering of more support from Filius pried the initial meeting location out of the stubborn spy along with the names of the primary attendees. Before either wizard could blink messages were sent off changing the location of the meeting to Gringotts with an excuse of having it as neutral ground.</p><p>"Do I want to know why you just did that?" Severus asked warily. They were all eating the lunch that had been provided by a scarily happy goblin muttering in gobbledygook occasionally punctuated by cackles and Dumbledore's name being obviously cursed.</p><p>"The Gringotts clan is very unhappy with the Headmaster for a number of reasons which we will not go over today. Now, as you know I had my own reasons for wanting to come with both of you today but I honestly didn't expect what happened. As your status has been confirmed I can explain what happened and some of the ramifications," Filius explained patiently. He waited for the two to nod their understanding before continuing. "I knew when we arrived that I could invoke certain goblin traditions and grant you both a greater protection than you have enjoyed over the years. That said most of our traditions in regards to outsiders restrict what can be explained before hand as a security measure for all parties involved. Know that I respect and care for both of you and that had I the option I would have discussed this all with you properly before hand. The one I invoked was the better choice but not the one I had originally intended to invoke simply because it has been such a long time since anyone has passed the requirements for it. I invoked Urk-conYang mostly because the checks for it are better than the others and the results can be legally and magically used in a number of other rituals and situations. The plan was to invoke Urk-conYang with every intention to honor it but the understanding that it likely would not succeed then invoke a newer but no less legal one to replace the failed ritual."</p><p>"So what happened wasn't normal?" Harry asked in a resigned voice.</p><p>"No where near," Filius agreed cheerfully. "Not only did you both pass but you earned the right to begin your own clan after the Urk-conYang is successfully completed should you choose to, which is why some will call you Kinlo Kun. Passing the initial requirements of the Urk-conYang was very significant. For all intents and purposes I just apprenticed both of you and also adopted you. This means that you will be treated as goblins by our people from now on and we've entered the grace period to get you up to speed on the basic teachings and weapons training of our people. Some of it will be changed or shortened because you are also wizards but mostly you will be trained as children of the clans and battle commanders due to whatever the council saw in your memories."</p><p>Harry fought not to choke on the sip of drink he had just taken even as Severus spluttered indignantly.</p><p>"Story of my life," Harry wheezed as he finally cleared his throat and caught his breath. Lunch came next with calm words, quiet discussion of nothing important, and a chance for them all to both calm down and process everything the morning had brought. Finishing up Lunch found both wizards pinned in place by a stern look from the part goblin.</p><p>"Now then, normally your assets would have also been considered before a ruling was handed down but you both passed without the asset check. Because of this any monetary debts either of you might have at the moment will be settled by the sponsoring clan, in this case the Gringotts clan. Your assets still need to be listed on the clan register for tax reasons and later clan ventures. It is still yours but it needs to be listed so that it can be properly assigned as goblin property along with all the paperwork. After your training and the five years in which we three will act as full members of the Gringotts clan doing various jobs for the clan we will have to pick which clan to join permanently. The three years of membership/service is in exchange for the hosting and training as well as a thank you for dealing with the paperwork. Traditionally, the three of us would go back to my clan but it is possible to petition to join any goblin clan after the years of service. It is also tradition for me to join you in your final choice of clan for at least 5-10 years. As I've already told you as Kinlo Kun you both have the option of beginning a new clan which I would automatically be part of whether I  moved to another clan later or not. The founders are permanently a part of the clan they help form and only very special circumstances can remove them even after death," Filius informed them sternly, making sure they were taking this seriously. Their avid attention to his words gratified him greatly.</p><p>"On that note we need to address your assets and the irregularities we've discovered," Gornack told them as he calmly pulled out several ledgers and folders.</p><p>"Irregularities?" Severus asked in a mix of suspicion and dread. Harry just looked clueless. </p><p>Seeing this Flitwick cursed in gobbledygook before holding out his hand for one of the files from Gornack. The two proceeded to quickly go through the pile while arguing or cursing a blue streak in gobbledygook. Eventually the two surfaced to pay attention to the people who's finances they had been discussing.</p><p>"Well I can see why he was concerned. Thankfully I have adopted you both so this... gross mismanagement and abuse of your assets is automatically turned over to our host clan to fix as are your Wizengamot seats. Seats which will be investigated and corrected if found in error but returned to you promptly upon request. Your Lordships and family duties will have to be sorted out later due to the complications of your transitioning status," Filius informed them in a mix of disgust over the mismanagement and fury on behalf of his new sons.</p><p>"What Lordship? What seats?" Severus demanded. "What irregularities?"</p><p>"Can I just get an explanation? What are you guys talking about?" Harry asked plaintively.</p><p>"You have no idea what I'm talking about?" Flitwick demanded incredulously.</p><p>"Filius," Severus growled in frustrated warning while Harry just looked bewildered.</p><p>"I think an inheritance test and full purge is in order Wand Warrior," Gornack suggested in a quiet, dangerous voice. "The healers are going to have a fit over this, something must be hiding whatever magics are involved unless they have simply never been informed. As for the obvious mismanagement... that falls on the honor of the clan and bank. It will be corrected as such with a full accounting being submitted to the Wand Warrior as your... the best translation is a mix of parent and apprentice's master."</p><p>"I think you are right. This has to be handled correctly," Filius agreed, obviously unsettled. "I <i>know</i> Severus was previously informed about the possibility because he spoke to me before seeing... Dumbledore. <i>Karfak!</i> The old meddler did something!"</p><p>The gobbledygook curse startled both wizards but Gornack nodded his own grim agreement.</p><p>"We don't have time to properly go over everything that we found and what will be done about it as your important meeting will start soon. I will have to freeze any activity in both accounts until we have time to sort this out," Gornack informed them.</p><p>"But! I have a special ingredient delivery on Thursday for my potion stores!" Severus protested. He was honestly worried in part because of how expensive the ingredients had been and how easy the were to ruin.</p><p>Harry watched on warily but didn't feel the need to object because he didn't really use his money. In fact he would much rather know what was going on and have whatever was his sorted out properly. He could live without access to his vault for the moment.</p><p>"The clan will take care of it. It falls under covering current outstanding monetary debts and your living expenses are covered under the apprenticeship and adoption until you've passed the final test," Filius was quick to assure him. Severus grumbled some more but didn't actually argue.</p><p>An inheritance test was quickly arranged and administered before both wizards were sent off to a bank employed tailor while the tests percolated. Both wizards were back an hour later dressed in a mix of smart clothes and robes with something resembling a cut down version of dueling robes. The difference between more normal cut down dueling robes and what the two were now wearing though were the sections of protective leather and distinct goblin influence in the design.</p><p>"Now that looks wonderful on you boys!" Filius said approvingly. "Give the tailor an extra couple of galleons from my vault will you? I've been wanting to get them into proper attire for <i>ages</i>."</p><p>"It will be done," Gornack agreed with a toothy smile. "Now the first part of the inheritance test has formed on the parchment. A secret you are now eligible to know is that this common test has several levels of development. In each of its levels it reveals very specific information. Some of what is revealed and how fast depends on the ingredients used while other secrets are revealed by the power of the sample blood that keys it to whoever is taking the test. As such some of the older tests reveal... interesting family information if a limiter is not included in the ingredients. This is something used only for our records as a security precaution."</p><p>"It would also be useful if the person turned on you," Harry observed quietly.</p><p>"We may yet make a Slytherin of you," Severus said with approval, giving him a long assessing look. They both knew that Harry's temper over the less than happy parts of the situation was still likely to go off at some point but he also recognized his attempts at both learning new information and self control.</p><p>Filius didn't bother hiding his pleasure at the way his boys were learning these small lessons for all that the looming meeting posed an obvious problem.</p><p>"That is very true. It is also one of the reasons we don't advertise that the test can do more than tell us the basics about bloodlines, Lordships, and some of the blood related magical gifts. There is also the fact that while the information is consistent to the individual the magic doesn't always list the same things beyond the basics which are sold as part of the standard inheritance test. The copies for our files don't carry the limiter in the ingredients but any that leave goblin control do or are hand copied on to official parchment for the purpose. We do in fact destroy most originals and magically copy the ones for our records in keeping with our safety and security promises to our customers. The reason for this is two fold. The first is that the sample of blood needed to create the test in the first place can be salvaged, if only barely, for other uses that are mostly less than pleasant for the victim. The second is that having so many magically activated blood samples in one contained location can leave enough magical residue to form some very nasty magical creatures and constructs. We... found that out the hard way," Gornack explained.</p><p>"Ah yes, the hidden and terrible source of the Boggarts," Filius said in open amusement.</p><p>"Those things aren't easy to fight," Harry pointed out quietly.</p><p>"They wouldn't be for you. If I recall correctly any that you face become Dementors," Severus pointed out without malice. "Despite the fear factor most people simply don't have an ultimate tangible fear that is either actively dangerous when mimicked, like a Dementor, or need more than a little thought to make amusing. Case in point Mr. Longbottom's particular Boggart."</p><p>"Or Ron giving the Acromantula skates on each foot," Harry added with a nod of understanding.</p><p>"Back on topic this inheritance test does not have the normal limiters and will be going into our files. The development time varies depending on multiple factors so there may not be much more, if anything, that is beyond a standard test. We also discovered a letter addressed to the both of you that had been sealed along with the Potter wills. As you are now under goblin purview everything about you became goblin business, opening sealed documents that potentially affect you. You need not worry about past wrongs interfering with your acceptance as the adoption has already been finalized. By our laws your past self is dead and you are reborn as one of our people, if in desparate need of training and other schooling. You, of course, retain anything you had previously as a form of inheritance from your previous life. The bequests from both Potters are being honored out of the bank's coffers until the review of your accounts is complete and any... errors are corrected. If any errors involve those outside the goblin nation the bank will take the blame as a protective measure," Gornack explained gleefully enough to make Harry and Severus wary.</p><p>"And those that appear within the goblin nation?" Harry asked bravely.</p><p>"Will be subject to goblin law. You are considered in part to be children until you have passed certain tests. This is to protect you from any blunders while you learn and train," Filius piped up happily, both wizards accepted that and decided not to ask again if only because of their next meeting.</p><p>"Here is the letter. I will play it for you as it was set up as both an addendum to the will and a personal letter to each of you,"  Gornack informed them. They each nodded their understanding and the letter played for those in the room.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <i><br/>
My dearest Harry and Severus,</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>I know that neither James nor I will survive this war so I write to you both. Severus, I forgave you long ago but you came to me and actually asked when I was three months pregnant. As a precaution we made the marriage contract for you and my baby the same day. Two months later you came to me apologizing again without any memory of our talk and I explained, expressing my concern. We concluded someone was changing your memories but it was the third time you didn't remember that James stepped in. I had been speaking to you with his blessing on the matter and we had just been told by the healer that I needed to reduce my stress levels or both Harry and I were at risk. James took it upon himself to use your old school rivalry as grounds to send you away and take the blame for keeping us apart. He was protecting us so I am certain that he wasn't very nice about it. I wouldn't know as he refused to discuss it with me.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>I explain all of this since I don't know what memories you have recovered by now or if you still think I hate you. I was just as much at fault for what happened. I have never claimed to be perfect but now, with Harry laying asleep in my arms and a few years distance, I realize that not only was I your anchor but that you weren't given the choice I thought you had about joining the Dark Lord. I am sorry for the harm I caused you my dear friend.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>There is also something I think you should both know. I studied the actions of the Dark Lord and anything else I could get my hands on about him over the years. It is my conclusion that he is ill or being affected by a curse or something. He is also getting worse and I fear that his illness will put you both at risk even as I <u>know</u> it will take the lives of James and I.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>I tried to tell Dumbledore but he brushed it off, saying something about having failed and always knowing the Dark Lord was evil. I've also caught him muttering about something called a Horcrux and how the Dark Lord was using it, whatever it is. The thing is Sev I think he was mistreated at home, like you. It also looks like, from my research, that <u>Dumbledore</u> stopped him from being an accomplished member of society and drove him further into his sickness.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>I also don't like how he made us move into his place in Godric's Hollow when we could have just as easily moved into an older Potter property. One older than the fairly new manor that James' parents had lived in when they were killed. In fact I'm not sure I trust the conclusions as to what happened to James' parents but I don't have anything more than suspicions. None of this sits right with me and Peter has been acting weird around Harry. In some ways it makes me glad that Harry screams when that man gets near him.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Harry, my baby, trust Severus. He will keep you safe. If you are placed with my sister, against our <u>express</u> wishes, or ever meet my sister I apologize for how poorly she will treat you.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>To reiterate, just in case someone has the absolute gall to stop our wills some how Harry is <b>not</b> to ever be raised by my sister or her husband. I would rather he be raised as the Dark Lord's son than let that woman hurt my baby. This also means that Dumbledore is not to have any say in Harry's life except that of his Headmaster. Should this not be honored I call upon the goblin nation to take my son and raise him as one of their own that he may at least survive to adulthood.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Harry, if this stupid war is still going on by the time you are old enough to choose a side then we want you to pick your side Dark, Light, Grey, or Neutral on their own merits for yourself and for what you believe. Don't let anyone choose for you or guilt you into picking because of our choices. You are your own person and we would much rather have you alive and fairly happy than agree with us over personal philosophy because you were forced to. I also happen to know that both sides are distorting the truth but its worse from the light side because of Dumbledore.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Here is a short list of things I think are good or bad about each side:</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Dark - good:</i><br/>
Tighter Security between worlds and thus protection against new witch hunts<br/>
Return of magics and traditions banned for Political correctness aka no proper reason
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Dark - bad:</i><br/>
Isolation to the point that we don't know what the technological threat actually is any more<br/>
Raids on those loosely defined as enemies<br/>
Don't do their research<br/>
Don't bother to explain their side<br/>
Don't bother to try and fix things peacefully
  </p>
  <p>
    <i> </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Light - good:</i><br/>
Protection of New magicals (muggleborns)<br/>
Inclusive/accepting of new magicals, mundane ideas, and innovation
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Light - bad:</i><br/>
Education declining - dangerous even - in favor of Political Correctness<br/>
Against anything "Dark"<br/>
Harsher creature laws
  </p>
  <p>
    <i> </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Incidentally, I am fairly sure that muggleborns are descended from Squibs and that their appearance is just the blood having been cleaned enough for the magic to return. Dumbledore tried to oblivate me of that so I think he is hiding it deliberately. It made me ver very glad that I had written down my conclusions in truth serum based ink on parchment soaked in truth serum and left it for me to read after our meeting. If you can get the Dark Lord to a healer and find the evidence for my conclusions and publish them it might keep both sides from being further idiots. It would also keep Dumbledore and the Dark Lord from gaining complete control of our world and turning us into mindless minions. This world needs balance to keep from destroying its self.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>These are only things I've been able to check and some of it might still be wrong. Trust Severus and I want both of you to live well.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Lovingly,</i><br/>
Lily Ann Potter nee Evans<br/>
<br/>
</p>
</blockquote><br/>The silence was heavy with sadness for the woman that was no longer with them yet the atmosphere quickly lifted to surprise and thoughtfulness as they processed what had been left for them to find.<p>"So I was never supposed to go to Aunt Petunia and Dumbledore was never supposed to be able to do anything with me except what he does with everyone else who is just a student..." Harry said slowly.</p><p>"Yes and I can confirm the Dark Lord's apparent illness," Severus agreed softly.</p><p>"This letter is also proof that as each of the protections failed we were to have custody and we do not take kindly to <i>thieves</i>," Gornack growled as an equally thunderous Filius nodded in dark agreement.</p>
