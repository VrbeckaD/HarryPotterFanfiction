    <p>May had just started with the summer glimpsing through the chilly air April had left behind. A man sitting in an armchair sipped on firewhisky, sunrays warming his skin. Birds sang cheerfully outside a nearby window to the tune of a violin resonating from a radio box situated on a nearby coffee table. The man smiled lightly whilst bathing in the sun, gesturing with a finger to the rhythm. The song went quiet, and he raised the glass for another sip.<br/>
A man’s voice came through the radio. ‘Welcome back. This is the annual broadcast in memory of the Battle of Hogwarts, and my name is Percival Atkins. Thank you for staying with us after the short break.' He paused. 'Ladies and gentlemen, we have entered the penultimate segment of our broadcast, with Mr Harry Potter joining us for a talk about his recollection of the war. Yet again, I would like to give a warm welcome to Mr Potter.’<br/>
‘Again, thank you for having me, Mr Atkins.’ A different, softer voice followed the introductions, this one very familiar to the listener.<br/>
‘Mr Potter, you have a reputation for rarely making appearances in public, which makes us all the more grateful for you agreeing to join us today.’ The journalist was courteous, although a hint of complaint broke through the politeness.<br/>
‘My pleasure.’ There was a short, awkward pause. ‘Although it may be unhealthy to dwell in the past, we must remember the sacrifice that secured our future.’ Harry’s voice was stiff, it seemed like he was trying to convince himself that it was a good decision to accept the invitation. He was clearly uncomfortable, yet doing his best to sound politely.<br/>
‘Yes, undoubtedly.’ Percival replied warmly. His relaxed voice strongly contrasted with Harry’s shyness. ‘You have given us an invaluable insight into how you experienced the war and its shortcomings through your career as an auror, but I was hoping we could finish the interview with some implications of the conflict that have been at the heart of the debate recently.’<br/>
‘I will try my best, but I have been focused on work, and politics isn’t really my area of interest, so there might not be any point in asking me…’ Harry tried to find his way out of the topic.<br/>
‘Your humility has no boundaries, Mr Potter, but I must insist. I doubt that our listeners would forgive me if I didn’t use the opportunity.’ The journalist laughed softly.<br/>
'I see.' Harry answered resignedly.<br/>
‘Now, the Ministry has recently issued a special report on war reparations paid over the past two years in connection to numerous convictions along with a forecast of the outstanding amount that is due to the families of the victims that will be paid out in the future. As I am sure we are all aware, the report has caused an uproar given how wealthy families associated with the Death Eaters are and how low low the value of assets they have reported to own is.’<br/>
‘I have heard about this, yes.’ Harry confirmed stiffly.<br/>
‘This turn of events leaves an especially bad taste in the mouth, as we are still dealing with an economic slowdown. Our society has been struggling with high rates of unemployment, homelessness, criminal activity, emigration and alcoholism. Another significant factor in the discussion has been the fact that the Death Eaters had at a later stage of the conflict infiltrated the Gringott’s Bank to the extent that the Ministry officials have been unable to classify any records made over the year preceding the Battle of Hogwarts as ‘reliable’. Additionally, numerous allegations of theft have been made against the Bank, because many vaults were emptied over that period, although we must not forget that goblins were also persecuted by the Death Eaters. In these instances the victims were meant to be reimbursed out of the reparations fund should they be able to prove their claims by meeting the Ministry’s thresholds.’<br/>
‘With all due respect, I am sure that the Ministry’s lawyers are working hard to solve this matter, and it wouldn’t be helpful for me to berate them over issues that I don’t have a proper understanding of…’ Harry tried to protest against dwelling further into the topic to no avail, as Atkins continued:<br/>
‘The reason I am bringing this up with you is that it has since been discovered that the Malfoy family is at the top of the list of the so-called ‘reparations avoiders’, as what they declared to own was little more than their manor, which, by the way, had all valuable assets such as works of art removed before the end of the war. They have been under scrutiny for exploiting a variety of legal instruments, predominantly trusts, owing to which they officially hold no legal title to their assets, to secure continued enjoyment of their wealth. Now, Mr Potter, it so happens that you spoke in the defence of Mrs and Mr Malfoy Jr at their trials after the conviction of the head of the family, Lucius Malfoy.’<br/>
‘That’s correct…’ Harry replied shortly but continued when the interviewer waited for further comments. ‘If it wasn’t for them, I would not be sitting here today, and this is precisely what I said in front of the Wizengamont.’<br/>
‘Of course, we have all read the reports, and the trials were broadly covered by the press.’ Atkins paused. ‘In your opinion, do you feel that the Malfoys have abused your trust and goodwill by going to extreme lengths to avoid recompensating the victims of Lucius Malfoy, one of the principal Death Eaters?’<br/>
An uncomfortable silence ensued.<br/>
‘Let me ask you this instead, Mr Potter. Have you remained in touch with the Malfoys after the trials?’<br/>
‘No, not at all.’ Harry replied cautiously.<br/>
‘What would you say to them, and especially to Mr Malfoy, an accomplice to the murder of Albus Dumbledore…’<br/>
‘He wasn’t found guilty of the offences he was charged with.’ Harry interrupted him.<br/>
‘Yes, although the verdict was due to mitigating circumstances, not for lack of evidence.’ Atkins addressed Harry’s abrupt interjection. It was clear he did not agree with the outcome of the trial. ‘If I may finish my question, what would you say to them if you had a chance to speak now?’<br/>
A sigh followed. ‘As I said, we are not in touch, and it would be out of place for me to tell them anything on the matter.’<br/>
‘I see.’ Atkins said resignedly, changing his strategy immediately. ‘How about the trustees who have been under increasing pressure from the media and the society alike to discontinue their financial arrangements with the family?’<br/>
‘I don’t follow…’ Harry sounded uncertain.<br/>
‘For instance, just two month ago customers started boycotting the Rutledge Distilleries’ products. The company reported significant losses in revenue last month, which led Howard Rutledge to publicly disconnect himself from the family by announcing that he is actively working on renouncing the legal title to allegedly a very large sum of money that he has been managing for their benefit.’ Atkins stated. ‘The vast majority of commentators suggest that it is in fact a moral duty of the trustees to disclose the assets they own for the benefit of the Malfoys. They advocate for the Ministry’s intervention to redirect those funds to the reparation fund. Would you agree with them?’<br/>
‘I don’t…’ Harry started, but Atkins was not accepting of avoidant answers anymore.<br/>
He jumped onto the next question. ‘They consensually offer their services to families that have been ordered by the Wizengamont to give up a proportion of their assets to compensate the victims of You Know Who, the man who they had pledged allegiance to. Don’t you find that inappropriate, Mr Potter?’<br/>
‘If you put it this way, I suppose…’ Harry said hesitantly.<br/>
‘In that case, would you like to use this opportunity to request both families and people involved in the blatant theft of money righteously owed to the families of the war victims to reconsider their actions?’ Atkins drilled the man mercilessly.<br/>
‘I…’ Harry exhaled trying to gather the right words. ‘It has not been long since the war, and for the most of us the memories are still fresh. I do feel bad for anyone who suffered a loss, and I too have lost family and friends.’<br/>
Atkins murmured in approval.<br/>
‘That said,’ Harry continued. ‘I don’t feel comfortable with fuelling people’s anger. I would sleep much better leaving this matter to Ministry officials, who I am sure will resolve it objectively, and I don’t think that the general public is ready to refrain from appeal to emotions in this discussion. I am no expert in the law of trusts and war crimes, so that’s all I can offer you today, Mr Atkins.’<br/>
There was a pause again as the men were likely staring at each other tensely, waiting for the other one to give in.<br/>
‘Alright.' Atkins sounded dissatisfied with Harry’s answer. ‘I am afraid that we have run out of time for this segment. Thank you for the discussion, Mr Potter. Dear listeners, please be patient with us as we pause the broadcast for a moment before we continue with a live performance by Celestina Warbeck in celebration of the victory at the Battle of Hogwarts.’<br/>
Violin sounds filled the room again, and the man raised the glass to his mouth one last time before making his way out with a glimmer of hope in his eyes.</p>
