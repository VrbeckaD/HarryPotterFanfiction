    <p>Chapter One</p><p>He still didn’t know how it had happened. He already knew that this year was going to be the worst one he had ever had. It all started last summer with the dementors, then the trial, and it just got even worse with the introduction of that Umbridge woman. She had taken a particular hate to him and had stripped him of everything he took solace in. First it started with detentions, point reductions, using his ‘behavior’ to alienate him from his own house and friends. Then she took away groups and clubs, then his broom. His last bit of solace ripped from him. He remembered after getting into a huge fight with Ron and the rest of the team he had just left. Making his way through the halls till he heard people talking in one of the unused classrooms. Walking in he found some of the muggle raised boys playing an odd game with cards. Curious he had joined them and with their help he slowly got into the game. They even helped him order his own packs of cards, build his deck and taught him how to play. Despite not being the best strategist he got the hang of the game quickly, Duel Monsters. He still thought it was odd having a game about magic being played by actual magic users.</p><p>Now, a few days later, he was running from the school towards the forbidden forest. Most people would think him mad but he didn’t care. He was still bloody and torn up from the battle at the ministry. Tearing through some of the bushes he ran past an ashwinder nest that hissed in anger but didn't follow, a centaur reared up in surprise when he ran past him. He was not sure where he was running but he just couldn’t stay there anymore. The lies, the betrayals, the death. They all lied to him. His foot caught on a root and he went crashing to the forest floor. His robe tearing and the strange deck of cards he had assembled went scattering across the moss. His sobs of pain and grief silenced the forests natural sounds. </p><p>He screamed and slammed his fists into the moss, it wasn’t fair. None of it was and it was their fault… no his fault. He felt stupid and ashamed. Tricked and beaten down. A hand landed gently on his shoulder and he rolled quickly to the side wand in his hand pointing at whoever had followed him. What he saw though, wasn’t any person he ever knew. A tall male in white and blue robes, ice blue skin and hair that was moon pale. He had a look of concern on his face as he stared at Harry but didn’t approach him again. A shuffling sound to his right had him turning and staring at yet another tall male, this one though was covered head to toe in deep blue black armor his skin tanned and hair a silver purple and he seemed to be gently picking up the scattered cards. They looked so familiar, they couldn’t be. Slowly the armoured one approached and held out the deck of cards to him his face was void of any emotions. Slowly Harry lowered his wand and took the deck slowly. </p><p>Looking down he noticed the card on top was empty… with just the name at the top. “Y...your from the cards.” He slid to the moss his wand falling next to him in disbelief. Great now he could bring cards to life by accident. He felt a hand again and this time he didn’t pull away from it. He slowly leaned into it and let his tears fall more. His heart broke and with it the whole dam of emotions he was keeping back, warm arms wrapped around him and he pressed into the soft robes, they felt so real as he let his emotions vent and storm, his magic was out of control but it didn’t seem to be hurting anything around him like it usually did when it lashed out. Instead the waves of magic seemed to be absorbed into the two odd staves the others wielded. </p><p>He didn’t know how long he cried or leaned into the strange forms, all he knew is that he was soon drifting off into a black abyss, the next time he woke up it was in his own bed with his deck tucked next to him on the pillow. The two top cards were the two who had appeared the night before. Slowly Harry sat up and reached for his glasses and sighed softly picking up his deck as his other hand shoved the spectacles onto his face. Had it been a dream? He looked down and paused, the card pictures were different. Instead of their original attack positions they were both relaxed back in their cards with soft smiles on their faces, The Arcanite had an arm extended as if to beckon him in to the safety he had felt the night before. He smiled and sighed softly before carefully setting the cards down again and getting out of bed. He didn’t bother with a shower, it was the last day and most of his stuff was packed up so he tossed his dirty pajamas into the trunk and grabbed a clean pair of jeans and a t-shirt. Next he grabbed his school bag and slid a couple of his books into it along with his deck and side deck and a few other things he liked keeping close when his trunk got absconded to his old room. He didn’t know why he bothered putting his deck in his bag, but something in him didn't want to leave it in his trunk, knowing he had to keep it close to him. </p><p>Leaving his trunk to be grabbed by the elves he headed down to the large dining hall and plopped down at the table, filling his plate with as much food as he knew he could stomach, it would probably be the last good meal he would eat for awhile and he wanted to savor it. Didn't stop him from stuffing some fruit into his bag for later. He ate in peace glancing down at the rest of the Gryffindors who kept looking at him like he was going to snap and curse them. He rolled his eyes and kept to his meal peacefully not caring if they wanted to talk to him or not. He was tired of their ever changing opinions and lack of loyalty and trust. How many times did he have to prove himself before they would stop doubting him. </p><p>“Harry!” He turned and smiled as one of the muggleborn boys ran up, his Hufflepuff tie askew as he jogged over, “I am so glad I caught you Harry! I wanted to give you something, think of it as an early birthday present!”</p><p>Harry took the brightly wrapped package and hugged him, “Thank you, Alex. This is amazing. You should tell me your birthday so I can get you something.”</p><p>The other laughed and shrugged, “Mine is near Christmas so not for awhile! Hey, can I send you letters over the holidays?”</p><p>The green eyes lightened, “Of course, I will reply as often as I can! You have a safe ride back okay?”</p><p>The other nodded and smiled waving before ducking out and heading to his table. Harry looked down at the brightly wrapped box and decided to open it later on the train away from all the curious looks. Finishing his food he ducked out quickly saying goodbye to a few that approached him as he made his way out the doors to the carriages. Not many students were there yet so it would be easy to snag a carriage without anyone else. After all he really just didn’t want to deal with anyone. Once inside one he locked the door and lowered the blinds to the carriage and pulled out his deck. Holding up the two cards he smiled softly, “So how did I manage to summon you two from the cards? Did I actually summon you or did my magic just give me illusions to vent to.”</p><p>The cards seemed to move just a little under his gaze and he sighed, “Alright don’t answer now that’s alright.”</p><p>“Did you expect them to?”</p><p>“Son of a…” he jumped and nesar slammed into the door as he turned to see… himself? No it wasn't him, this man couldn’t have been. He was deeply tanned and taller, he had well defined muscles and his long black hair was kept in a low ponytail. His eyes were blue with an odd reddish hue. “Who the hell are you?”</p><p>The figure chuckled softly, “Your darkness. The secret side of yourself you keep hidden from the world. Sort of. I am also a spirit, a ghost if you will.”</p><p>Harry narrowed his eyes, “Okay, then why are you here? Masquerading as my darkness at that. What does that even mean?”</p><p>The other shrugged, “I am not sure, but it has something to do with that you are someone who is very… light oriented, but you have been through a lot of things, so your soul.. it's cracked I guess. Then I am a ghost or spirit connected with darkness and shadows, I sort of help fill in those cracks and make you whole again. It's hard to explain.”</p><p>The wizard frowned, “But how did you get here, and find me?”</p><p>The man raised a brow and pointed at his bag, “You have my Talisman. It recognized you as someone worthy of meeting me and pairing with me.”</p><p>Harry dug in his bag and pulled out the brightly wrapped gift and tore it open. Inside was an odd card case that looked to be able to hook onto a belt and with it an amulet. Or he guessed Talisman. It was gold and shaped like an odd beetle that he didn't know it had feathered wings coming out each side that seemed jeweled. “What is it?”</p><p>The spirit pointed out, “It's the sacred scarab combined with the wings of Isis. Isis is the goddess of motherhood and magic. The scarab is a symbol of immortality, protection and transformation. I was a sorcerer in my past life. Just as you are one in this life.”</p><p>“A sorcerer? No, I’m a wizard.”</p><p>“Same thing really, you use magic of the earth and goddess, as well as the magic of the shadows and darkness. It is a very rare combination. You are a very talented young man. May I know the name of my light?”</p><p>The green eyes looked at him, “Uhm, Harry. My name is Harry.”</p><p>He smiled softly, “I am Nashtu, Sorcerer of the Pharaoh. It is very wonderful to meet you Harry.” He smiled and seemed to fade away, the talisman in his hand glowed lightly. </p><p>Harry sighed and wondered how he was going to even wear or hide the damn piece of gold and gems. If the Dursleys found it they would steal it for sure. Hell he already had to hide his deck somehow. Speaking of, he pulled it out and slid it into the deck box sealing up the cards with a sigh of relief. They fit in it perfectly. Maybe he could get a belt next time he was in Diagon Alley. For now though he had a lot to think about as he stared down at the winged scarab and stroked it carefully with a finger. The other had mentioned shadow magic, and darkness with light. His teachings had always told him dark was evil, but the other didn’t seem evil. He had been a follower of a pharaoh. </p><p>Grumbling he gave up thinking about it and rested back in the cart and let himself drift off as other students found theirs and they began to be taken to the train. Once there, he noticed he was one of the first carriages and actually had some time before he had to hurry onto the train. Ducking out of carriage a bit early he headed to Hogsmeade quickly his feet taking him quickly to the clothes shop and he smiled at the woman, “A belt please. Dragonhide and black.”</p><p>She smiled, nodded, and floated a few over. He went over them quickly before selecting the one he wanted and paying her quickly. Stuffing it in his bag with everything else he looked to were the carriages were lining up and noticed there were still a good steady stream going. So he took a quick stop at the jewelry shop and bought a broad gold band that a nudging feeling told him to get. Grumbling he paid and headed out and cussed as he saw the carriages starting to leave the platform. He had taken far too much time in the jewelry shop. He started running full pelt toward the train hoping that students were still being loaded onto the train. He didn’t even notice as swirling shadows whisked around him and he yelped as he was suddenly surrounded in cold chilling darkness then standing on the platform were he almost ran INTO the train. He could hear a deep rumbling laughter in his head and knew the other had something to do with it as he climbed onto the train and looked for an empty cart near the back of the train. Curse his luck and weirdness.</p>
