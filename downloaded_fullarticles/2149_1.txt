          <div class="userstuff"><p>sirius peeked up through his lashes at the boy standing up in front of him and nearly lost all concepts of reality at the sight before his eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>he saw remus, his eyes fluttering shut, bottom lip drawn between his teeth, low, deep groans emitting from the bottom of his throat with a look of pleasure written all over his face, cheeks flushed red, those once neat curls now resting wildly on the top of his head, sticking to the sides with sweat. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>remus, he thought, looked like the male counterpart of aphrodite, the <em>real</em> adonis, for he had never looked so beautiful, so breathtaking ever. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>the realisation that sirius was probably falling for this boy hit him like a brick and he pulled back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"<em>sirius</em>," remus whined at the sudden loss of contact. he was gasping, shaking and looking absolutely and utterly <em>ruined</em>, but he was perfect. when was he never? he huffed, hips moving on their own accord, trying to coax sirius' mouth back to where it was - where it <em>belonged</em>, sirius strongly believed - and sirius himself almost let out an embarrassing moan in remus' name, like a chant, a prayer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"i love you," he said, the words materializing completely solid and spoken and <em>there</em> and remus smiled, his infuriatingly dazzling smile, down at sirius. "remus, i love you. fucking... i <em>fucking love you</em>," and it was a whisper because it was <em>heard</em> and <em>acknowledged</em> and remus finally, <em>finally</em> knew sirius was in love with him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>remus' hand snaked down from their grip in sirius' hair to his cheek, cradling it, stroking with his thumb. "i should hope so," he said softly, "with the way you were just sucking me off." he slid down to his knees, pressing their foreheads together, "i love you. i love you, too. so <em>fucking</em> much."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the shared sentiment took sirius' breath away and he released a breath he didn't know he was holding and he let out a laugh, relieved, elated and crushed his lips against remus' and it was as if a floodgate had been opened because he couldn't stop, doesn't think he <em>could</em> stop, but it was a reciprocated bliss and what really could he do? "<em>i love you, i love you, i love you</em>."</p></div>
