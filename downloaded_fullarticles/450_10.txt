    <p>“Interesting.” Riddle looked at him, still pointing Ginny’s wand, but now smiling. “You know, when I first heard of how you defeated Voldemort, I thought I’d lure you down here and kill you. Now seeing you face to face, I understand.”</p>
<p>Harry looked down at Ginny, keenly aware that with each passing minute, she crept closer and closer to death. But what could he do? <em>I’ve got to keep him talking, wait for an opening.</em></p>
<p>“Why would you care? Voldemort was after your time?”</p>
<p>Tom laughed at this, “You don’t get it? It’s an anagram.”</p>
<p>Harry looked down at the map where letters were now rearranging, “Overt Mold?”</p>
<p>“No, No, LORD Voldemort. Is that parchment a magical anagram solver?”</p>
<p>“Something like that. Odd Mover Troll? Mr. Old Dot Lover?”</p>
<p>“What? No. Ok, fine maybe it doesn’t work so well in that direction. It’s ‘I am Lord Voldemort’. It’s an anagram of Tom Marvolo Riddle.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t suppose Tom is short for Thomas?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes. Why?”</p>
<p><em>Lord volt’s airhead mom, Admiral Voldemort’s Ho, </em>“No reason.”</p>
<p>“Accio parchment.” The map flew from Harry’s hand to the boy across the room. As soon as Riddle looked down at it and chuckled, Harry took his chance.</p>
<p>“Expeliramus!”</p>
<p>Tom flicked his wand, deflecting the spell, and casually waved his wand, “Impedimentia.”</p>
<p>Magical ropes wrapped around Harry’s limbs, holding him immobile, helpless before Tom.</p>
<p>“A fine map. This would have served me quite well in my time. Let’s have a chat, shall we?” Tom waved his wand summoning two chairs. Harry felt the ropes draw him down to his seat. Tom plucked Harry’s wand from his hand and took his own seat.</p>
<p>“I do believe our interests may align, Harry Potter. Perhaps we should become allies.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t the first time you’ve tried to recruit me.” Anger was rising in Harry once again. “You killed my parents. You tried to kill me. Now you’re trying to kill her!” Harry shot an accusatory glance over to Ginny, still lying motionless on the floor.</p>
<p>“Me? Now, I’ve been trapped in a book for the past 50 years. How could I have harmed your parents? You blame me for another’s crimes.”</p>
<p>“Don’t play games. You ARE Voldemort. You said so yourself!”</p>
<p>“I’m the memory of a 15-year-old boy who’s pen name was later used by someone who hurt you. Why should you hate me?”</p>
<p>“Why should I trust you?”</p>
<p>“Because we have a common enemy.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“The same one who imprisoned me for all these years killed your parents. Your vengeance can be my vengeance. It’s not like you have anything to lose. If I wanted, I could kill you now. Either with the wand or by summoning the Basilisk back.”</p>
<p>He was right of course. Harry was helpless and had nothing to lose in hearing him out.</p>
<p>“Ok, what are you proposing?”</p>
<p>“Simple, I’ll release you. You go back up to the castle and continue your studies. Once a week, you come back down here and write in the diary. I deliver to you the powers and secrets which will aid you in your fight.”</p>
<p>“And her?” Harry nodded towards Ginny.</p>
<p>“Oh? Do you want her? Perhaps more. Perhaps you <em>want </em>her?” A wicked smile spread across his face.</p>
<p>“She’s 11.” Harry’s voice was flat, accusatory, disgusted by Tom’s suggestion.</p>
<p>“And you’re 12. But perhaps in a few years. She fancies you, you know. She’d let you do anything.”</p>
<p>“She’s… she’s Ron’s sister.” The argument felt weak in the face of such a vile offer. How could he suggest such a thing?</p>
<p>“And she’d be alive. Surely he’d forgive such a small transgression if you saved her life. She wouldn’t even have to know.”</p>
<p>“Stop,” Harry said weakly, nauseated by the thought of what Tom was saying.</p>
<p>Tom stared at him for a moment, then laughed. “I’m joking of course. She’s so infatuated with you I couldn’t help but see what kind of man you were. The girl is yours.”</p>
<p>“And the attacks?”</p>
<p>“The Basilisk is yours too. Any further disruption will be on your order.”</p>
<p>“How do I know you won’t try to possess me like you possessed her?”</p>
<p>“I swear I’m neither able to so possess you nor do I desire to.”</p>
<p>“How can I believe you? How could you believe any promise I make?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’d know if you were lying. I always know. As for me, lies are abhorrent to me. I would not sully myself with anything less than truth.”</p>
<p>“And if I don’t believe you? What if I want some proof, like Verataserum or something?”</p>
<p>“I could offer assurance,” Tom smiled slyly, “There are spells to ensure honesty you know. Would you like us to be so bound?”</p>
<p>Harry couldn’t help but think Tom was three steps ahead of him, like he had wanted Harry to insist on some such requirement. But he could hardly back out now. Harry nodded.</p>
<p>“You’ll need your wand back, and a bit of freedom is called for.” The ropes vanished and Tom held Harry’s wand out to him, handle first. “We will grasp each other by the wrist, the spell is <em>probitatis.</em> We must say it together.”</p>
<p>Harry grasped Tom with his left hand, his wand pointed towards where Tom’s hand grasped him.</p>
<p>“On three, 1… 2… 3!”</p>
<p>“<em>Probitatis,</em>” they said in unison.</p>
<p>A pale blue light flowed from their wands, wrapping about their arms with cool, clear tendrils.</p>
<p>“Excellent,” Said Tom</p>
<p>“How do I know it worked?”</p>
<p>“We could go on like that forever. Any test or further assurance could be questioned in turn. Let’s begin by discussing the terms of our arrangement. Do you promise to attempt to update me once per week in exchange for your release and safety?”</p>
<p>“I will so long as I don’t have any reason to suspect you of possessing me or otherwise controlling me.”</p>
<p>“Accepted. And to you agree to keep this journal and chamber hidden in exchange for the secrets and powers I wish to impart to you?”</p>
<p>“I won’t tell an- AHHH!” Harry’s left arm exploded in searing pain.</p>
<p>“And now you know the spell works. Who is it you intend to tell?”</p>
<p>“My friends, Ron and Hermione,” Harry panted, still grasping his burning arm.</p>
<p>“Will you promise to at least keep it hidden from the headmaster?”</p>
<p>Harry paused before answering, unsure if he could honestly promise that and unwilling to reignite the pain with a lie.</p>
<p>“I won’t tell him for now, but I can’t promise I won’t change my mind.”</p>
<p>“That will be good enough. Anything else?”</p>
<p>“No, just release Ginny.”</p>
<p>“You’re forgetting something. <em>Come servant of Slytherin!”</em> Tom hissed in parseltongue.</p>
<p>Harry quickly shut his eyes tight as the great snake slithered into the room. He held his wand in front of him, heart racing as he prepared to fight for his life.</p>
<p>“<em>The Heir of Slytherin commands you. I bequeath you to Harry Potter. Serve him and his line so long as you live. </em>Put down your wand and open your eyes. She’s no threat to you.”</p>
<p>Harry cautiously cracked one eye, heart hammering hard in his chest. There before him was the creatures massive head, snout inches from his face, staring at him. He shut up his eyes again. He could feel the creature’s breath on his skin, hot despite the cold sweat pouring from him. Why wasn’t he dead? He had looked at the basilisk and somehow survived.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes again. The beast was staring at him sure enough, but through the transparent lids of its yellow eyes.</p>
<p>“Isn’t she marvelous?” Tom whispered to him, “She will not open her eyes fully in your presence unless commanded, though she can see well enough to kill through the lids. Touch her.”</p>
<p>Harry reached out a tentative hand and touched the creature’s snout. The scales with smooth and warm beneath his fingers, somehow comforting.</p>
<p>“I thought snakes were all cold-blooded.”</p>
<p>“Common snakes, yes. But the Great Serpents, basilisks, dragons, hydras, and so on, are all warm-blooded. Give it a command.”</p>
<p>“What would happen if I commanded it to eat your diary?”</p>
<p>“The Basilisk is one of the few creatures that could destroy me. My life is now in your hands. But you won’t kill me, will you? Not until I’ve shared my secrets, and maybe not even after.” Tom smiled. Harry didn’t like how confident Tom was of his assessment. He looked far too comfortable for someone aware of a threat to their life. He was right though. Harry couldn’t very well kill him with the gift that Tom had just delivered. Besides, there was also something else going on here. Something more complicated than mere vengeance. Acting before he understood the situation seemed… imprudent.</p>
<p>“<em>What’s your name?”</em> Harry asked.</p>
<p>“<em>I have no name. I am Servant. You are Master,</em>” the great beast hissed back.</p>
<p>“<em>Sleep until I call for you again.” </em>The great serpent slithered back toward the mouth of the statue and disappeared slowly into its hole.  </p>
<p>“Well then, now that the Beast of Slytherin—excuse me, the Beast of <em>Potter—</em>sleeps, I suppose it’s time for me to slumber as well. Until next time.”</p>
<p>Tom faded, not into the milky white transparency of a ghost, but straight into the dark nothingness of the chamber. Harry made his way quickly to the unconscious girl. <em>She’s still breathing. </em></p>
<p>Harry made his way back to the entrance. The adrenaline was draining from his blood, leaving him with a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach that he had made a grave mistake. Could he really join with such evil without being corrupted by it himself? Harry shook his head; he may have made a deal with the devil, but he saved a life. That had to count for something.  </p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>There was the exit ahead. If he could just get Ginny up to the bathrooms, he could bring help to her.</p>
<p>“Harry, please forgive me, I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>He looked down, at last realizing what he was hearing.</p>
<p>“It’s OK, Ginny. You’re safe. I’m here,” he whispered.</p>
<p>“I… I didn’t mean to. I couldn’t stop him,” she sobbed into his robes.</p>
<p>“I know Ginny. It’s not your fault. It’s over now. Can you climb? We still need to get out of here and I don’t think I can carry you up.”</p>
<p>“I think so. You really don’t hate me?”</p>
<p>“I don’t, I promise. Just climb. I’ll get help once we’re out of here. You go first.”</p>
<p>Harry could see a blush spreading over Ginny’s cheeks in the glow of the wandlight.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“I’m wearing a skirt…”</p>
<p>“We won’t be able to climb with wands out anyway. <em>Nox.</em>” The wand went out, plunging them into darkness. “Go ahead, I’ll follow.”  </p>
<p>They made their way up the hole on hands and knees, crawling upward for what seemed like ages. Harry snaked a hand up, feeling the ground for the hem of her robes, making sure she was still moving.</p>
<p>“Ouch! Damn it!” Ginny exclaimed, “the door is closed.”</p>
<p>“<em>Open,” </em>Harry hissed. The stone before them slid out of the way and they clambered onto the cold tile of the bathroom.</p>
<p>Hermione and Blaise were still there, wands out, watching over the bound Lockhart. Harry couldn’t help but notice the two were sending venomous glances at one another, seemingly more ready to hex each other than the professor.</p>
<p>“Where is Ron?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“They went to find a professor,” Hermione shot a look at Lockhart, “a proper one. I was making sure <em>he</em> didn’t betray us.” Hermione glared back at Blaise.</p>
<p>“I was making sure <em>she</em> didn’t get taken in by professor charming over there,” he shot back.</p>
<p>“Shut up. Who was it, Harry? Who’s the heir? Did you stop them? Is the creature dead?”</p>
<p>“It’s over, we’re safe. I’ll explain later,” Harry panted, panic suddenly setting in as the reality of everything caught up to him.</p>
<p>“Harry, are you OK?” asked Blaise as Harry leaned against a sink, hyperventilating.</p>
<p>“Yeah… I think…” Harry began, eyes wide, gulping great gasps of air, “I think I’m gonna… pass out now.”</p>
<p>The world went grey.</p>
