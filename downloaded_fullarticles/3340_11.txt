    <p>James was just putting Harmony in the bath, his daughters delighted squeals echoing around the bathroom, when someone rapped on the front door.</p><p>Ignoring it, James started to soap his daughters Hair.</p><p>His poor fawn had inherited his devils snare gene. It made cleaning it all the more difficult on one so young.</p><p>His poor daughters head was usually a mass of snarls, and Harmony, quite rightly, didn’t appreciate having her hair tugged and pulled around by her <em>mean</em> parents.</p><p>The rapping came again, and James moved away from his daughter to shout down the stairs; his hands dripping suds and water on the floor.</p><p>“Lil’s, can you get the door please love. I've got fawn in the bath."</p><p>“I’m answering it now, I couldn’t find my robe. Padfoots been sleeping on it in the pantry again."</p><p>James snorted as he kneeled in front of the tub once more; he honestly had to wonder if his friend was more dog than man sometimes. Not that Harmony seemed to mind, he was her own cuddly interactive toy most of the time and Sirius loved the attention.</p><p>Harmony suddenly slapped the water, soaking James t-shirt through; causing her to chuckle.</p><p>“Daddy wet."</p><p>The chuckling didn't abate as she went about creating a right old mess. Water and foam splashing onto the light blue tiles that continued to echo with his fawns happy laughter.</p><p>Despite the mess James had to grin. Her happiness was infectious, even if his shirt did pay the price.</p><p>He poked her nose with a soapy finger, making her little face scrunch up as she tried to look at the foam he'd left on the tip</p><p>“Yes daddy wet, so daddy will need to change again before he can have breakfast. Won’t he."</p><p>Harmony cocked her head at him like a puppy, before grabbing several handfuls of foam and water and flinging it at him.</p><p>James sputtered as his daughter giggled with delight.</p><p>
  <em>Yep definitely going to have to change.<br/> </em>
</p><p>Leaning over the bath he filled a jug with warm water; carefully rinsing his princesses hair. With his daughter quietly babbling instead of shrieking, he realised he could just hear the soft murmur of talking coming from downstairs, it sounded like they'd got a lady visitor.</p><p>
  <em>I wonder who’s turned up at this time of day, it’s only just after 8 in the morning.<br/> </em>
</p><p>Finishing her hair he started gently washing her over with a soft flannel, making her release another shriek as he tickled her tummy.</p><p>With his daughter squeaky clean he pulled her out of the bath; wrapping her in a fluffy red Gryffindor towel gifted to her by Minerva the day she was born. It was looking a little tatty these days.</p><p>Wrapped securely, James snuggled her into his chest and carried her towards the nursery.</p><p>The feminine voice was louder as he walked down the landing towards his fawns room, but it was still to muffled for him to hear what it was saying. One thing that was certain however was that whoever the visitor was it was most certainly wasn't anyone he knew.</p><p>“I wonder who’s come to visit at this time of day fawn."</p><p>Harmony didn’t have an answer for him, she was far more interested in sucking on the edge of her towel.</p><p>Once in the nursery, James gently laid his little girl on top of the white painted changing table and set the mobile above it going with a flick of his wand.</p><p>She was still quite fascinated by the animated quidditch players, even if she was starting to get a little old for such things.</p><p>James was so used to the process of applying cream and talc and adding the recent addition of a pull up, (instead of a nappy); that the entire thing took moments.</p><p>The real challenge came, with trying to get her dressed in a timely manner. She had very strong opinions on what she'd wear; it was no use putting her in something she didn’t like, she’d just remove it.</p><p>Most of the clothes that Lily had bought for their daughter tended to lean towards averagely girly, in other words; mostly pink and pastel shades.</p><p>Recently Harmony had started revolting against these colour choices, and was not best pleased when James presented her with a light pink t-shirt, to go with the red shorts he’d already put on her.</p><p>She was now standing on the nursing chair in the corner of the room (having climbed up while he was getting the shirt), doing an adorable little scowl, and holding tightly to the arm of the seat to keep her balance.</p><p>The shorts had been acceptable, (they were a deep Gryffindor red; a colour she didn’t mind) but he couldn’t even get near her with the pink shirt. She kept ducking away, when he tried to put it over her head.</p><p>Scowling and stamping her foot she told James exactly what she thought of his attempt to dress her.</p><p>“NO Pin." looking at him as defiantly as a two year old could.</p><p>As adorable as his daughter looked like this, James needed to nip this display in the bud.</p><p>She wouldn’t be so cute if this became a full blown tantrum.</p><p>“Harmony. What have mummy and Daddy said about shouting?” James gave her an expectant; reprimading look.</p><p>The little girl lowered her head chastised, but the pout remained.</p><p>James's resolve broke just a little at the sight.</p><p>“I’m sorry honey, but the only t-shirts that are clean are pink or white. The rest are in the wash. Mummy and daddy have been busy this week and the washings not been done."</p><p>This explanation went straight over Harmony's young head and she stamped her foot in displeasure once more, loosing her balance slightly on the squidgy chair.</p><p>"No pin, wan green." Harmony didn't raise her voice this time, she simply turned her large beseeching eyes on her father.</p><p>The last of James' resolve crumbled as he realised he was fighting a loosing battle. Holding the tiny pink top up, he retrieved his wand from the back pocket of his jeans and placed the tip against the garment.</p><p>“Color Mutatio."</p><p>The T-shirt changed to a vivid emerald green, a shade not dissimilar to his daughter eyes.</p><p>Harmony clapped her hands in glee, making grabbing motions towards the shirt, she loved daddies special stick.</p><p>“Geen! Magic daddy."</p><p>Thankful that his happy little girl was back, he easily slipped the top over her head.</p><p>He only hoped he wasn't home when the colour changed back...the tantrum was bound to be epic.</p><p>He cast a drying spell over her damp head, holding back a loud guffaw as it puffed up like a bedraggled dandelion.</p><p>
  <em>One blow and I could make I wish.<br/> </em>
</p><p>Because she was not yet of an age to care about such things Harmony simply held out her arms asking to be picked up.</p><p>James obliged, but instead of settling her on his hip he began to twirl her around around in circles. The room rang with her delighted squeals; they were so loud he was honestly surprised Lily hadn't appeared to scold him.</p><p>The front door slammed and he figured it was safe to venture downstairs.</p><p>He stopped off at his room to change his shirt, not an easy task when you're trying to stop your daughter eating your wand, before heading for the kitchen and the possibilities of breakfast.</p><p>He rather fancied a bacon sandwich.</p><p>"So what do you want for breakies this morning my little fawn? Some yummy sliced banana or some yucky porridge."</p><p>Harmony stopped twiddling with his collar long enough to utter "Orridge," before sticking her fingers in her mouth and drooling around the like a lollipop.</p><p>James grimaced at the mess. Lovely.</p><p>The kitchen was bathed in early morning sunshine, holding the promise of a good day. Harmony removed her fingers from her mouth and started to babble at him.</p><p>Only a few of the words held any meaning for him. It sounded like she was talking about Padfoot, but in all honesty she could've been telling him she had a bad foot.</p><p>James thought about what his daughter might be trying to tell him came to an abrupt stop as he spotted an unknown; scowling little boy sat in his daughters spare high chair.</p><p>Lily was nowhere in sight.</p><p>The boys hair was black and limp, hanging in lank strands down to his chin. His face was thin, while his nose was long and hooked. It was the eyes that got James though, they were dark grey...or possibly black and they glittered with a churlish menace that was disconcerting in such a young child.</p><p>The little boys clothing appeared to be in a rather poor state. His t-shirt was a little threadbare in places and while it had clearly once been a nice blue; it was now a dingy grey.</p><p>The brown trousers he was wearing were threadbare as well, and appeared to be a little on small side; the hems rested well above the battered green shoes that graced his swinging feet.</p><p>On seeing James, the boy had crossed his arms over his chest defensively and scowled all the harder.</p><p>It was a rather disconcerting look to see on one so young.</p><p>When the boy crossed his arms; James was treated to the sight of an ugly purple bruise, (that was taking up most of the boys upper right arm). It looked a little like fingers in places, but James couldn’t be entirely certain from this distance; and if the look on the child's face was any indication; James didn’t think he be permitted a closer look.</p><p>Harmony’s babble had ceased from her perch in his arms, and she was staring owlishly at the small raggy boy.</p><p>This wasn’t overly surprising. Harmony rarely saw other children and even fewer her own age.</p><p>James felt Harmony tug on his collar a clear sign she wanted him closer, “who, dat?”.</p><p>There had been little point in Harmony tugging him closer; the question was hardly asked in a whisper, but James played along and whispered back.</p><p>“I don’t know honey”, “why?”, “because I wasn’t here when he arrived”, “why?” “because I was giving you a bath”, “why?”.</p><p>James needed to break this cycle. She’d started using the word why, a few months ago; and as soon as she got going with it, you could be stuck in a loop of seemingly never ending whys.</p><p>Thankfully before Harmony could really get going, Lily walked in to the kitchen looking a little flustered and carrying a jar of child friendly bruise paste.</p><p>They kept abundant supplies of it, he loved his daughter to bits; but she was more than a bit of a clutz.</p><p>Seeing her mother, James and the boy stopped being interesting and she let out an ear splitting shriek at the sight of the red head, making grabbing motions.</p><p>“mummy, mummy, mummy!”</p><p>The shriek had made the unknown boy jump in his seat, though the scowl hadn't wavered.</p><p>Lily on the other hand briefly lost her flustered look, and lit up at the sight of her little girl. She put the paste down and took the squirming toddler out of James’s arms.</p><p>She placed a tender hello kiss on her daughters cheek; which Harmony returned with great enthusiasm. (Perhaps a little to much enthusiasm).</p><p>James started to snigger as his wife began to wipe the abundance of spit off her cheek. Though the drool didn’t stop her looking happy to see her little girl.</p><p>“Good morning my little angel, did you have a nice bath with daddy?”</p><p>Harmony nodded vigorously, “daddy wet!”, before making a grab for her mothers long red hair.</p><p>Having gotten used to this behaviour; Lily was able to manoeuvrer her hair out of the way of curious little fingers, before they tugged on it too hard.</p><p>Giving her another tender kiss, Lily set her in her high chair; before picking up the bruise paste once more and unscrewing the lid.</p><p>Bewildered James watched as his wife went over to the scowling boy and gently tried to take his arm.</p><p>The boy seemed very reluctant to be touched, even more so when she went to touch the bruised area. He tried to move his arm away from her, by turning side ways in his seat; but the confines of the high chair wouldn’t allow for it.</p><p>Lily started to speak to him in a soothing voice, (it was the one she used when Harmony got sick)</p><p>“It’s alright Severus. I’m just going to put this stuff on your arm, and it’ll feel all better, promise”</p><p>The boy looked at her warily for a moment, before mutely nodding and reluctantly letting her take hold of his arm.</p><p>Satisfied, Lily started to apply the thick paste to the discoloured skin. The boy flinched once or twice when she rubbed a particularly tender spot; but other wise he remained silent and motionless; though the scowl never left his face. It was all rather odd.</p><p>When the paste was on and she’d given the boy his arm back, James decided that now, was as good a time as any, to ask exactly who he was and why he was here.</p><p>“Lily”.</p><p>“hmm”, was the absent minded reply as she screwed the lid back on the jar, before making for the cupboard to pull down a box a Ready-Brek.</p><p>“Who’s the boy?”.</p><p>Lily looked up from pouring the cereal in to two small bowls.</p><p>She stared at James for a moment; as if she wasn’t quite understanding what he was asking; before her brain clearly kicked in to gear.</p><p>Two small spots of colour appeared high on her cheek bones.</p><p>“Sorry, I completely forgot you weren’t in here when Eileen dropped him off. This handsome little fellow, is Severus Snape”.</p><p>James had to wonder if his wife was needing glasses, the boy was anything but handsome, in his opinion, but he didn’t voice this thought.</p><p>“uh huh. <em>Sooo </em>– what’s he doing in our kitchen at…” James glanced briefly at the kitchen clock, “eight thirty nine in the morning”.</p><p>Lily had started to boil some milk on the stove top by now, and wasn’t looking at James as she uttered, “I agreed to watch him, for a friend”.</p><p>“You agreed to watch him?. But you’re not even home today, you’re supposed to be heading to Hogwarts for your private tutoring sessions in a few hours”.</p><p>Lily remained watching the simmering milk and gave no answer, James got a sinking feeling.</p><p>“You want me to watch him while you’re at work, don’t you?”.</p><p>Lily looked at him biting her lip and looking hopeful, “It’d only be for a few hours, I'm only tutoring between eleven and two today. Then I’ll take over and you can head in for your shift with Sirius”.</p><p>James ran a hand through his hair feeling frustrated at the thought of looking after two young children, but seeing the hopeful look on his wife's face; he crumbled embarrassingly quickly.</p><p>“Yeah, alright, fine, but I want some information before I look after him…”</p><p>The milk suddenly started to boil over and Lily had to quickly turn the stove off before it started to burn.</p><p>“Just let me give this pair breakfast and then we can talk alright”. She quickly gave her husband a small smile, before starting to make the kids porridge.</p><p>All James could do was nod and watched as his wife made up two bowls of Ready-Brek, (making sure to add some cold milk so it didn’t burn little mouths).</p><p>She placed a green bowl in front of Harmony and a plain white one in front of the scowling little boy.</p><p>Harmony instantly tried to put her hands straight in to the bowl of porridge, before Lily tapped her hand slightly in admonishment and handed her a small silver spoon.</p><p>James knew it was useless; the moment their backs were turned, that spoon would end up on the floor and she’d try to dive in to the bowl face first; but Lily was determined to try and install some table manners in their young daughter.</p><p>The Snape boy on the other hand, didn’t seem to need this pointer.</p><p>He’d picked up his spoon, and diligently, (and quickly) started to eat the offered meal; not letting a drop go any where other than his mouth. At the rate it was going in, James had to wonder, when the boy last ate anything decent.</p><p>Motioning James closer, Lily set the kettle going to make a cup of tea; before filling James in, in a low murmur.</p><p>“Eileen dropped him off, she's in a right pickle and quickly needs to find some where to live. She left her husband two nights ago, and.. well.. she’s been sleeping rough with Severus ever since. When she asked if I could watch him.. I could hardly say no could I?. After all looking for somewhere to live isn’t easy, and I imagine it’d be even harder with an aggravated three year old in tow, the first rental viewings she could get were for early today, so she left him hear before rushing off”.</p><p>James grabbed the mugs from the cupboard, before murmuring back to his wife.</p><p>“Alright I can understand her needing the help, but who is she exactly?, I don’t remember you knowing any Eileen's. So why has she suddenly dumped her child on you?”.</p><p>The kettle started to whistle, and Lily looked a little annoyed at James wording.</p><p>“Honestly James, she was one of my best friends at Hogwarts. You should know this, you’ve picked on her more than a few times from what I remember. We’ve kept in touch since school, through owl post mostly. Though over the last couple of years, her letters have gradually tapered off; and I've not heard from her at all in the last six months”.</p><p>The whistle of the kettle was really getting on James’s nerves, so he removed it from the stove top and started to make them both a cup of tea while Lily continued.</p><p>“Apparently the muggle she married got really abusive when he found out she was a witch. So she started to use the owl post less and less to try and avoid conflict. But then six months ago, Severus had his first bout of accidental magic, and, apparently, Tobias got even worse. He started getting physically abusive towards her as well as mentally and verbally.”</p><p>James watched Lily take a deep breath before continuing in an even lower tone; so low infact, that he had to strain to hear her over the chattering babble his daughter was directing at the quiet child next to her.</p><p>“When he went to turn on Severus two nights ago, she’d finally had enough. She grabbed their few things and the money she’d managed to save up and left in the middle of the night. Obviously she has no relatives to turn too. They turned their back on her when she refused to go through with her marriage contract at the beginning of 7<sup>th</sup> year. And when they found out later on that she’d married a muggle, she was disowned entirely”.</p><p>At the mention of a broken marriage contract he suddenly knew who Lily was talking about.</p><p>It had after all, been quite the scandal around the school at the time. It was almost unheard of for any pure blood girl to renege on her contract. Let alone a <em>slytherin</em> one, for whom blood purity and an advantageous marriage stood supreme.</p><p>“I remember her now, tall, gawky looking, really big no..”</p><p>“<em><b>James”. </b></em>Lily interrupted sharply.</p><p>Casting a significant glance over at the black haired boy who was no longer scowling; but looking at Harmony in clear confusion. Whether this was down to the babble she was still spouting or the fact she appeared to be using her porridge to draw all over her high chair James wasn’t entirely sure.</p><p>
  <em>Using her porridge to draw all over her high chair? Shit!<br/> </em>
</p><p>James raced over to his daughter and removed the mostly empty bowl off porridge from her grasp.</p><p>Lily wandered over more sedately and presented James with a warm damp cloth to clean her face and hands.</p><p>Thank fully she’d managed to keep her shirt mostly clean despite the overwhelming mess of the chair it’s self.</p><p>A quick wipe with the cloth got rid of the worst of the mess and Harmony was mostly clean once more, and a quick wordless Scourgify dealt with the chair. If James had been paying attention he would have seen the boys eye’s widen.</p><p>James sent a mock scowl at his daughter, this just made her grin up at him; showing off her front baby teeth.</p><p>“You’re a very messy little girl Miss Potter. What do daddies do with messy little girls?”.</p><p>Harmony continued to grin and shook her fluffy, scraggy head at him.</p><p>James picked her up out of the chair, bringing her close up to his face, “I think, messy little girls, get a visit from the raspberry monster”</p><p>James lifted the hem of her t-shirt and started to blow noisily on her tummy. This sent Harmony in to near fits of giggles and squeals; as she attempted to squirm out of the strong but gentle hold of her father.</p><p>Lily silently watched the pair, while sipping on her tea; but when Harmony started to hiccough, Lily thought she better remove her daughter from the raspberry monster.</p><p>Taking her little girl in her arms, Lily sent James a look. “What”</p><p>“You know what. You’ll make her sick if you continue, she’s just eaten”.</p><p>“She would’ve been fine, you’re just being paranoid, she’s got a strong sto..ugh”</p><p>James had been tickling under Harmony’s chin; while she’d started to lean towards him out of her mothers hold.</p><p>However no sooner had he started to say she’d got a strong stomach; she contradicted him, by spitting up all over his clean shirt.</p><p>James groaned long and low, while Lily pursed her lips in amusement, and her eyes twinkled smugly at him.</p><p><em>Guess I'll need another clean shirt</em>.</p><p> </p><p>James left Lily with the two kids, and went back up stairs to put on his third shirt of the morning.</p><p>
  <em>It’s not even half nine yet.<br/> </em>
</p><p>Clean again James came back downstairs to find the kitchen and the main living room deserted of both children and his wife.</p><p>“Lil’s?”</p><p>“I’m in the shower, what do you want?!”</p><p>How James had missed the tell tale sound of running water while he was upstairs; he had no idea.</p><p>“Where are the kids?”.</p><p>“It’s a nice morning, so I put them in Harmony’s playpen outside. I only put them in there about ten minutes ago, and I put the usual safety charms up. They should be fine for a bit, if you want to get something to eat”.</p><p>Clearly his wife was well on top of looking after more than one child.</p><p>“Alright, do you want anything?”, “Just some toast”.</p><p>James wandered in to the kitchen. Looking out the window behind the sink; he could clearly see Harmony and The Snape boy sitting in the playpen. They were covered in the dappled early morning sunlight that was shining through the trees, (with all the cheerfulness, of a late September day).<em><br/> </em></p><p>Seeing that they both looked fine, James set to work on making some toast for himself and Lily.</p><p>
  <em>So much for my bacon sandwich. </em>
