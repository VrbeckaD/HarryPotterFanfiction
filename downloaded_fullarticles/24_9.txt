    <p><strong>HARRY</strong>        </p>
<p>Malfoy’s up to something. Malfoy is <em>always</em> up to something, but this time is so much worse. He’s been happy. Draco Malfoy, the most pompous git to ever git, has been sauntering through Hogwarts with an actual skip in his step. I told Hermione and Ron about this, of course, but they think I’m imagining things. Or to quote Hermione that ‘I should stop obsessing over Malfoy for once and focus on my studies.’ But I think that’s just Hermione being Hermione because I’ve been focussing plenty on Dumbledore’s lessons about Voldemort, even if they’re not what I expected when the Headmaster said he’d be personally tutoring me.</p>
<p>I’m meant to meet Dumbledore with my Invisibility Cloak right now, but I reckon I’ve got time to see what Malfoy’s up to when he’s finally not guarded by Crabbe and Goyle. Turns out putting sleeping potions into their desserts works just as well as it did second year. And I didn’t even need Hermione’s help to make these ones. As terrible an idea using the Half-Blood Prince’s textbook turned out to be, at least it improved my potion-making skills. I’m not sure what I would’ve done with the guilt if Malfoy hadn’t accepted my terrible excuse for an apology down in the Hospital Wing though.</p>
<p>I check the Marauders’ Map and grin at the sight of Malfoy pacing in some unused classroom in the dungeons. After weeks of trying to guess which version of the Room of Requirement Malfoy was using, I did the next best thing. I tipped off a bunch of seventh year Ravenclaws about the room, so they could explore the space in their final days at Hogwarts. I almost told Ron about it, but he would’ve said something about the idea being too Slytherin-like. Bet the twins would’ve approved though.</p>
<p>The dungeons are almost completely empty this time of day, only the odd pair of Slytherins strolling through the halls, none the wiser to a Gryffindor sneaking past under an Invisibility Cloak. I triple check the map to make sure that Snape’s not anywhere nearby, but the slimy git is thankfully in the staffroom with Professors McGonagall, Sprout, and Flitwick. They must be having a Heads of House meeting or something. Fred and George have spied on plenty of those in their time at Hogwarts; I bet the Marauders probably did too. Wonder if Dad and Sirius would approve of me using some of my more Slytherin traits to catch a git like Malfoy. Not sure if Remus would tell the truth if I asked.</p>
<p>Malfoy’s using a classroom so deep into the dungeons that I’m not sure anybody else would find it if they didn’t either spend hours looking or have a map showing where everyone is in Hogwarts. The hall is clear of anything, even dust thanks to the house elves no doubt, so I shed my Invisibility Cloak and tuck it into my robes. I somehow doubt Malfoy isn’t going to notice me opening the door, no matter how quietly I try, and the cloak is just going to get in my way if I have to move quickly.</p>
<p>The sight that greets me half makes me want to back away slowly, close the door, and go straight to Dumbledore. But I wasn’t sorted into Gryffindor for nothing. Malfoy stands a few feet into the room surrounded by dozens of golden white orbs that fill the classroom with an eerie sort of light. They’re spinning around him at a speed that could rival a snitch, somehow getting faster with every second. Malfoy notices me, slashes his wand down, and all the orbs turn black.</p>
<p>Most wizards’ first instinct in this kind of situation is to pull out their wand. Mine is to tackle the Slytherin to the ground.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch me!” Malfoy screams as we crash to the floor.</p>
<p>It’s the last thing I hear before everything goes dark.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The next time Hermione says that I’m the reason people attribute recklessness to Gryffindors, I’m not defending myself. I’ll even listen to her entire lecture the next time I see her. So long as she at least waits until Madam Pomphrey fixes whatever Malfoy has managed to do to us. I don’t even have to open my eyes to know he’s done <em>something</em>. Everything just feels … wrong, somehow. My body feels like it’s just gone through a bottle of Skele-Gro, and the main reason I don’t want to open my eyes is that I don’t want to be proven right about my current theory.</p>
<p>I feel smaller, physically weaker, and, I’m hoping this is some twisted nightmare and I’m currently lying unconscious in the Hospital Wing, because my instincts are practically screaming that I am also <em>younger.</em> I didn’t even know there was such thing as a de-aging spell before now, but I guess that’s what I get for tackling Malfoy when he’s casting a spell I don’t recognise. Despite what everyone in the Order of the Phoenix keeps telling me, I really wish my first instinct was still to cast <em>Expelliarmus</em>. Maybe if I just keep my eyes closed everything will go back to normal.</p>
<p>A weak groan from next to me makes the decision for me.</p>
<p>I reluctantly open my eyes to see a much younger Draco Malfoy clutching his head with his wand in hand.</p>
<p>“Tell me that was a nightmare spell,” I groan, checking my hands, and yep, they’re a lot smaller.</p>
<p>“What kind of wizard tackles someone?” Malfoy asks, his voice pitched higher than usual.</p>
<p>I stumble to my feet and glare down at Malfoy. “I think we have a bigger problem than my instincts here.”</p>
<p>The only reason I haven’t killed the git is because at least our robes have shrunk down with us, so I don’t trip as I yank him not too gently to his feet. Then again, of course Malfoy of all people would screw up with magic this badly and still manage to maintain his appearance, however younger he ends up. Malfoy rips his arm back from me and immediately sways. Oh, and it turns out the git’s nose is bleeding as well. I wouldn’t be surprised if he just passed out on the spot.</p>
<p>“What did you do to us, Malfoy?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Shut up, Potter. I’m trying to think, and the headache isn’t helping.”        </p>
<p>“We’re somehow younger, your nose is bleeding worse than a failed Weasley Wizards product, and you’re worried about a little headache?”<br/> Malfoy wipes his bloody nose. “Maybe if you hadn’t tackled me, I wouldn’t have a headache that feels like I’ve been in Binns’s class for the past 48 hours straight!”</p>
<p>“What about your nose?” I ask, watching Malfoy stop the bleeding with a muttered spell and a wince. “I didn’t realise I’d hit it,” I say, which would probably sound more like an apology if it weren’t me saying it, and if it weren’t Malfoy I was saying it to.</p>
<p>The prefect glares at me. “That was the spell. An expected consequence all things considered.”</p>
<p>“What kind of dark magic inflicts wounds on the caster?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t dark magic, you ignorant Gryffindor! It was an extremely powerful spell to transport-.”</p>
<p>“Transport?” I question, finally looking around the room, which is decidedly not the dungeons.</p>
<p>There are trunks everywhere, stacked against the wall, on the couches, next to the coffee table with a lone copy of the Daily Prophet on it, and blocking any sight of a door or window. The trunks are expensive looking ones as well, and for some reason, my trunk is sitting behind me, the odd one out. Before I can question that particular detail, Malfoy opens his stupid mouth.</p>
<p>“<em>Obviously. </em>What with us not being in the classroom anymore. I swear, if those seventh years hadn’t decided to use the Room of Requirement the moment I needed to cast my spell-.”</p>
<p>“Take us back to Hogwarts right now,” I demand.</p>
<p>Malfoy levels his wand at me. Mine’s still in my robes.</p>
<p>“Or you’ll what, Potter? Keep cutting me off? Tackle me again? Throw a punch like your Mudblood friend did in third year? You take one step towards me, and I’ll have you petrified and jammed in a closet within five seconds.”</p>
<p>“I’ll wait for Dumbledore then. I was on my way to meet him, so I’m sure he’s already wondering where I’ve ended up.”</p>
<p>Malfoy laughs. “Potter, you have no idea what you’ve stumbled into this time.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? All of this,” I gesture to us and the room filled with trunks, “this is just some illusion that you’ve crafted.”</p>
<p>“The flat’s no illusion and-.”</p>
<p>“You’re not convincing me that we’ve suddenly been hit by some weird de-aging curse, Malfoy. I’m not that stupid.”</p>
<p>Even if that was my first thought.</p>
<p>“You admit you’re stupid then?” Malfoy asks.</p>
<p>I throw my hands into the air. “Would you just tell me what’s going on, you stupid git?”  </p>
<p>Malfoy rolls his eyes and levitates the newspaper from the coffee table to my hands. I reluctantly drop them, so I can look at it.</p>
<p>“August 1<sup>st</sup>, 1971,” I read aloud. “Why do you have a copy of the Daily Prophet from 27 years ago?”</p>
<p>Malfoy glares at me. “I don’t know, Potter, <em>maybe</em> because my spell was meant to take me and my chosen companion back to this point in time. Or maybe I have an almost thirty-year-old copy of the Daily Prophet lying around in a random flat in Muggle London just to confuse idiotic Gryffindors who interrupt my painstakingly crafted spell!”</p>
<p> I stare at the newspaper like it’ll suddenly become a portkey and take us back to that classroom. “Are we…?” I glance up at Malfoy. “Is this today’s paper?”</p>
<p>“Finally caught onto the obvious then, Potter?” Malfoy snaps.</p>
<p>His baby face is as bad as it was in first year. And I haven’t been this skinny since before Hogwarts. Yet that would mean… That can’t mean…</p>
<p>“But why are we eleven?” I ask.</p>
<p>Malfoy yanks up his sleeve. “One, I didn’t fancy walking around with the Dark Mark on my arm while trying to kill the Dark Lord. Two, the best time to infiltrate a wizarding school is from the first year.”</p>
<p>I feel like I should question why Malfoy wants to kill Voldemort, but there are more urgent problems to address.</p>
<p>“You did this on purpose?” I question. “You really were spending all that time sneaking around this year making some time travelling spell?” I don’t know whether to try punching him or to demand answers. “Who’d you even want to bring with you?”</p>
<p>And why wasn’t anyone else in that room with him if the spell was designed to bring someone along. Unless… Unless Draco Malfoy, Prince of Slytherin House, couldn’t find anyone who’d join him on an insane quest.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re not the first person I would’ve chosen, but I suppose you do have more knowledge and experience about fighting the Dark Lord than I.”</p>
<p>“We can’t just go around messing with time, Malfoy!”</p>
<p>“I know the risks.”</p>
<p>I cross my arms, missing the muscles built from years of Quidditch. “Really? So you know that if we change anything, anything at all, that prevents the two of us from being in that classroom together over twenty years from now, then it’ll create a paradox?”</p>
<p>“It won’t.”</p>
<p>I throw up my arms. “That’s not how time travel works, you conceited prick.”</p>
<p>“Speaking from experience, Potter?”</p>
<p>“Yes, as a matter of fact, I am. Third year, Hermione had a time-turner to fit her ridiculous schedule. We used it to save Sirius and Buckbeak.”</p>
<p>Malfoy scowls. “Oh, so it’s alright for the Golden Trio to mess with time to save a Blood Traitor and a beast, but when I want to do it to kill the bastard that ruined both our lives before he gets the chance, it’s time to worry about paradoxes.”</p>
<p>“We went back two hours! We didn’t interfere with our past selves, we didn’t stop anyone from dying who already had, <em>and</em> we had express permission from Dumbledore. We arrived back just in time for us to disappear in the first place.”</p>
<p>“Good thing I didn’t use a time-turner then.”</p>
<p>I roll my eyes. “Like that makes a difference.”</p>
<p>“Did you or did you not notice all our possessions surrounding us? You certainly can’t do that with a pathetic time-turner. I’ve been refining the set of spells ever since the Dark Lord gave me my mission.”</p>
<p>“To kill Dumbledore,” I say flatly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Potter, to kill your precious Dumbledore. Obviously,” Draco gestures around us, “I chose a different impossible task instead.”</p>
<p>“You mean, you’ve spent all year trying to put yourself into the body of your eleven-year-old self and sent yourself back to the year that my parents started at Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>Malfoy glares. “I was <em>aiming </em>for the year that Severus started. Hardly my fault that they went to school together.”</p>
<p>“Why Snape?”</p>
<p>“I’ll be sure to tell you all about my plan once you agree to help instead of trying to keep time the way it was before.”</p>
<p>I scoff. “You want <em>my</em> help?”</p>
<p>“Like I said before, Potter. You’re the most experienced with beating the Dark Lord.”</p>
<p>“Tom Riddle.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“That’s his name. Tom Marvolo Riddle. Not the Dark Lord or Voldemort or the Heir of Slytherin even. Tom Son of a Muggle Riddle. Junior. Named after his Muggle father and everything. Mother was a Gaunt that died soon after he was born. Raised in a Muggle orphanage, tormented the other kids for years, and made his first Horcrux when he was sixteen.”</p>
<p>Malfoy pales. “How do you know all of that?”</p>
<p>“Dumbledore. He’s been giving me private lessons all year.” I step forward. “Now, you better have a damn good explanation on why changing the past would actually work. Trust me, Malfoy, I have people I want saved too, but I’m not about to risk the people I love, who are still alive in our time, on some barely-thought-out plan made in desperation.”</p>
<p>“I thought Gryffindors make all their plans that way.”</p>
<p>“Not the ones that could kill us all. Those are always thought out weeks in advance.”</p>
<p>He smirks. “Potter, I’ve been planning this since your last ‘thought-out’ plan got my father thrown into Azkaban.”</p>
<p>Malfoy promptly passes out.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>It takes me twenty minutes of moving past the stacks of trunks, and towers of galleons, sickles, and knuts that were apparently hidden behind the trunks, to explore the entire flat. I consider the large beds in the two bedrooms for all of three seconds before deciding it was too much effort having to move the trunks off the couch and moving the unconscious Malfoy onto it, to now move him to a bed. Maybe next time the git can pass out from magical exhaustion when I can actually use my wand without the trace going off. It’s still a month until I’ve seventeen, despite Malfoy’s stupid spell.</p>
<p>If he got away with using magic without a Ministry owl sent our way, then that must mean that our magical ages aren’t affected by the physical de-aging. Hermione would be proud of me figuring that out on my own. But it’s not like I’m going to be able to tell her anytime soon. While I’m all for hearing Malfoy’s plan to deal with Voldemort before he reaches his height of power, I would’ve preferred bringing along Ron and Hermione for the job. Fighting Riddle isn’t the same without them being with me every step of the way. Malfoy’s probably got a way for us to duck back to 1997 and grab some extra help, right?</p>
<p>I doubt Malfoy of all people would let this be a one-way trip. He’s the ultimate Slytherin, aside from maybe Snape. Malfoy will have an emergency way out. He will.</p>
<p>There’s not much else to the rest of the flat: one bathroom, a kitchen that seems to have even more towers of galleons, and the living room that Malfoy’s passed out in. I consider making a proper walkway through the trunks, but if Malfoy really wants me to stop climbing his trunks, and jumping from the tops of them, then he can move them himself. Those things would be heavy to me at my proper age. At eleven, I can barely make my own trunk budge, and I know it’s overfilled. Malfoy’s probably got expansion charms on the inside of his, which just makes me wonder more why he has so many. And why there can’t be feather-light charms on them as well.</p>
<p>I glare at the trunks on the second couch with the hope that the longer I stare, the more likely I’ll suddenly be able to perform wandless magic and move them. After a solid two minutes of glaring, I sigh, and flop onto the spare space next to Malfoy’s feet on the cleared couch, Daily Prophet in hand. If we’re going to be in this time for a while, it’s probably best I know what’s been happening in the Wizarding World. History of Magic never did cover more recent events, not that I remember much from that class.</p>
<p>The first thing I realise is that even before Rita Skeeter was a reporter, the Daily Prophet is incapable of accurately printing proper stories unless they’re riddled with lies, scandals, and scandals with lies. I’m also pretty sure half the names are incorrect unless the person’s rich and/or important enough, but the only names I recognise are the parents of my classmates, or more likely, their grandparents. There’s an interview three pages in with Walburga Black that makes me cringe at how sure she is that the Heir to House Black will be sorted into Slytherin in the coming September.</p>
<p>Sirius is alive. So are my mum and dad. They’re alive and eleven and about to enter Hogwarts, and Malfoy’s plan sounds like we’ll be entering alongside them, and I’m going to meet my parents at age eleven, but they aren’t my parents yet. They haven’t even met yet, and according to Snape’s memories, they don’t even like each other for years. Snape and my mum are still friends. I’m going to meet a young Snape, and if I want to get to know my mum, then I’m going to have to be <em>nice</em> to a young Snape.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Malfoy’s plan somehow sounds both completely insane and like the best thing ever at the same time.</p>
<p>But what if I have to trade my life in the 90s for this? What if that’s the price for coming here and stopping Riddle early? What-?</p>
<p>No. Malfoy will have a plan for that. He will. We can save them and be fine, someway, somehow. Everything’s going to be fine. If I have to work alongside Malfoy for that to happen, then so be it. It’s not like we’re agreeing to be friends or anything ridiculous like that. I’ll hear Malfoy’s plan once he wakes up, and whatever it is, he’ll have a way for us to go back in the end. So what if along the way to defeating Riddle, I take advantage of this opportunity to spend time with a younger version of my parents, Sirius, and Remus?</p>
<p>It’s going to be so much fun teasing the older werewolf about the eleven-year-old him. It’ll be some big joke once we get back. It’s going to be fine.</p>
<p>Malfoy lurches up and has his wand to my throat before I can so much as put the newspaper down.</p>
<p>“Nice nap?” I ask sarcastically. “Ready to tell me your brilliant plan to defeat your Dark Lord?”</p>
<p>Malfoy glares at me for a moment and then lowers his wand. “Thanks for moving me, I guess,” he mutters, sitting up properly and leaning against the opposite armrest. “As for my plan, it’s certainly going be easier now.”</p>
<p>“Because I actually know some of Riddle’s secrets?”</p>
<p>“It’ll certainly save me having to infiltrate his future inner circle from within Hogwarts. Not to say it’ll make our task any easier.”</p>
<p>“And what exactly did you want us to do in 1971?”</p>
<p>“Infiltrate Hogwarts from the first year, prevent the powerful outcasts from joining the Death Eaters by encouraging inter-house unity-.”</p>
<p>I burst into laughter. “I’m sorry, what? <em>You</em> want to encourage inter-house unity? The same Draco Malfoy who scoffed at the thought of being in literally any house but Slytherin, wants to promote unity between the houses? And how on Earth are you going to manage that?”</p>
<p>“I never said it’d be easy, Potter! But like most things in life, it doesn’t matter how difficult a task is if it’s important enough. You do whatever it takes to get it done. If that means making nice to a bunch of Gryffindors then so be it.”</p>
<p>“And the other two houses? Not sure if you noticed, what with you mostly targeting the lions, but there are four houses in Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>Malfoy scoffs. “I’ve made plenty of alliances within Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff in my years of tormenting you. Hufflepuffs are wonderfully vicious when protecting their own, and Ravenclaws make excellent study partners, like when I was trying to figure out the complex charms needed for those badges I made in fourth year.”</p>
<p>“Sorry I misjudged how far you were willing to go in your hatred for all things me.”</p>
<p>“Please, I don’t hate you, Potter. Dislike you, absolutely. But hate you? No. I reserve my hatred for far more deserving targets. Like Riddle, or my aunt Bellatrix, or Dumbledore using his political status to erase wizarding traditions because they’re ‘too complex’ or ‘outdated’ for the poor Muggleborns.” Malfoy stands up and starts levitating the trunks around before I can even begin to respond. “How many rooms did the trunks fill, anyway?” he asks.</p>
<p>“Just this one and the hallway to the bedrooms and bathroom. The kitchen’s practically overflowing with galleons though.”</p>
<p>“That’ll be my trust fund.”</p>
<p>I stumble while getting up at his nonchalance. “And the rest of the money?”</p>
<p>“Oh, bits and pieces that I’ve been squirrelling away since Riddle returned at the end of fourth year. Mother helped. She kept it secret from Father of course.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” I mumble.</p>
<p>Malfoy frowns. “I’m not sure I see the rest of your belongings. It’s just your school trunk by the looks of it. Maybe the spell didn’t work properly thanks to you tackling me right when it was meant to go off.”</p>
<p>I studiously avoid eye contact while putting the Daily Prophet back onto the coffee table. “It worked fine,” I say.</p>
<p>“These are all your possessions then? The Potter fortune might help a little, but the only other thing here is your trunk. I would’ve thought the Boy-Who-Lived had more.”</p>
<p>I feel my face burning red. “I inherited 12 Grimmauld Place, but I somehow doubt your stupid spell would bring an entire house too, especially one that already exists in this time.”</p>
<p>Malfoy waves that off. “It was meant to copy everything, not transport, so it wouldn’t matter if something already existed here. Unless the Black London House was placed under a Fidelius Charm, and you weren’t the Secret Keeper.” Malfoy raises an eyebrow at my awkward shuffling. “Why aren’t you the Secret Keeper for your own house?”</p>
<p>“It was being used as a Headquarters when Sirius was still…”</p>
<p>“Then when he died, it should’ve made you all-.” Malfoy takes a deep breath. “That idiot Dumbledore was the Secret Keeper, wasn’t he?”</p>
<p>I shrug. “Well, yeah.”</p>
<p>“To <em>your</em> house?”</p>
<p>“Not like I got to live there.”</p>
<p>“Not like you got to live there,” Malfoy repeats dryly. “Why the bloody hell not? Where else would you have lived?”</p>
<p>“Same place I always have. My aunt and uncle’s.”</p>
<p>“But James Potter didn’t have any-.”</p>
<p>“My mum’s sister.”</p>
<p>“You’re a half-blood.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Malfoy takes a step back, looking like he wants to scream. “The Boy-Who-Lived, Dumbledore’s Golden Child, and the Heir to both the Potters and the Blacks, was raised by Muggles?”</p>
<p>Screw it. We’re going to have to work together. I might as well be honest.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say raised, more tolerated barely and mostly treated like a house elf…”</p>
<p>At this Malfoy twitches violently.</p>
<p>“But yeah, I’ve lived with my aunt, uncle, and cousin for as long as I can remember.”</p>
<p>“I’ve changed my mind. I’m going to complete that first task after all.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t know you had a heart,” I mutter.</p>
<p>Malfoy points his wand at me. “I am more a rightful blood Heir of the Black House than you will ever be, Potter. To hear that the heir of not just one of my families, but another ancient line of purebloods was raised by Muggles, is like spitting on the graves of both our ancestors.”</p>
<p>“Now’s probably not the best time to mention that I didn’t even hear about magic until I got my owl, and even then, that I didn’t know I was a wizard until Hagrid showed up ‘cause nobody would let me read my letter.”</p>
<p>Malfoy looks like he’s building up for a rant. It’s pretty much instinct at this point to keep pushing.</p>
<p>“Also, that my aunt always told me that my parents died in an accident, and I had no idea about how much money I inherited until my eleventh birthday.”</p>
<p>Something in him snaps. “That was the day we met,” he says quietly.</p>
<p>“You reminded me of my cousin: a spoilt bully.”</p>
<p>“And now?”</p>
<p>I glance around us, at the surprisingly modest flat in the middle of Muggle London. “You’d do anything for your family. Guess you’ve always been like that, just a little hard to notice over all the ‘my father will hear about this.’”</p>
<p>“Sometimes you have to save your family from themselves.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you take us earlier then, to when they started?”</p>
<p>Malfoy sighs. “Because I think no matter what I do, they’ll always think the same way they were raised to. At least from this time, we’ll be able to influence the greatest number of key players without letting someone else take the place of Riddle as Head Death Eater.”</p>
<p>“How are we going to manage that if you still think the same way?” I snap. “You’ve been calling Sirius a Blood Traitor this entire time. Still think Hermione’s a Mudblood and that you’re so much better for having magical ancestors? Because if we really do this, if we go to Hogwarts the same year as <em>my</em> family, and you even think about calling my mum a Mudblood, I am going to do a hell of lot worse to you than throw around an unknown curse.”</p>
<p>“I’m <em>trying</em>! Okay? Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to undo years of being raised to think and speak this way? I’m never not going to be passionate about preserving wizarding traditions. I’m never not going to be frustrated when <em>Muggleborns </em>come into our world without a clue about our culture and zero willingness try to understand it, instead assuming the Muggle way is always better. I’m never not going to believe that growing up around magic gives you an advantage when you <em>start</em> at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>“But I’m willing to help bridge the gap. I’m willing to make sure there’s a Wizarding Studies class for Muggle-raised witches and wizards while we do Muggle Studies. I’m willing to accept that blood purity is more about money and class than magical ability. I’m willing to compromise some of my beliefs, so long as they’re compromising too. I <em>have</em> been thinking about this for a long time, Potter, not just the spell needed to get here, but what kind of changes need to happen once we did. At this point, I’m pretty sure killing Dumbledore would’ve been easier, and we haven’t really started yet.”</p>
<p>He’s not wrong. Things are always easier when Malfoy’s wrong.</p>
<p>I rub the bride of my nose, feeling a headache coming on. “Alright.”</p>
<p>“Alright?”</p>
<p>“You promise we’re protected from the changes?”</p>
<p>“I’m not an idiot, Potter. If I said ourselves and our possessions are time-locked, then they are.”</p>
<p>“Just make the damn promise, Malfoy.”</p>
<p>He scowls. “Fine! I promise we’re protected from the changes.”</p>
<p>“What happens when we’re born?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>I take a deep breath. “When we’re born, Malfoy. Don’t know if you remember, but the war didn’t exactly end until we were one.”</p>
<p>“Well, obviously we’ll end it before then, you idiot.”</p>
<p>“And then what?”</p>
<p>“Just ask what you want to ask!”</p>
<p>“What are we doing when this is over, Malfoy? I don’t know about you, but I don’t fancy sticking around while another version of Harry Potter is born and raised by his loving, alive parents, nor do I fancy heading back to our time and not having any clue what’s been happening for the past sixteen years.”</p>
<p>Malfoy shrinks in on himself. It’s an odd sight, something so like the bathroom incident, yet somehow worse in his eleven-year-old self. “I don’t know how to do the spell the other way around,” he mumbles.</p>
<p>Every thought about going home goes straight down the drain. Something in my gut lurches, as Malfoy slams the door shut on all of my hope.</p>
<p>“What?” I ask, my voice weak.</p>
<p>“I can’t reverse it, Potter! Maybe as a bloody thank you for everything we sacrificed, your precious Dumbledore will help us out. How about we focus on killing that Riddle bastard first, and then the old man will be in our debt?”</p>
<p>I don’t punch Malfoy, as tempting as it is. Instead, another thought hits me.</p>
<p>“This will mean that everything we’ve ever done won’t happen, won’t it? If we kill him, if we save both our families, everything we’ve gone through won’t have happened. We’ll remember it, but nobody else will, will they?” I ask.</p>
<p>“I’m sure Dumbledore would erase our memories if we asked nicely enough.”</p>
<p>“No!” I shout. “Sure, I’ve been through hell and back, but I’d never ask to have all that stolen from me. That’d be the same as killing everyone, including ourselves, from our time. If we don’t remember what happened, they might as well have never existed.”</p>

<p>“I want to remember.”</p>
<p>“You want to remember all the pain you’ve gone through?”</p>
<p>“I want to remember continuing to fight despite of it.”</p>
