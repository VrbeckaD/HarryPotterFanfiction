    <p>Harry's POV</p><p>The times here again, I'm finally going back to Hogwarts. Away from the Dursley's, Merlin I hate them. Every second with them is agonisingly slow, definitive torture. I'm glad to be going back to Hogwarts, even if Draco and his annoying housemates are constantly disrupting me it's still better than being stuck with the Dursley's, anything is. Nothing can be worse than the untouchable scraps they allow me to consume, if you can even call them that. Hogwarts however, they have the biggest feasts ever, there's everything. Even if i cant always eat much, it's still wonderful knowing it’s endless and present. I just need to get away from that house, and stay away.</p><p>Now more than ever as Vernon is getting worse, disastrously worse. He's always been abusive but since he's been fired for disruption, and probably discrimination or something of the sorts, he's all kinds of repulsive. He's had three baths since he was "let go" and he was fired months ago; its like living with an angry and undiscovered wild animal. Petunia acts oblivious, refuses to acknowledge the truth of the situation. Vernon is venomous, sinking his teeth into any remaining happiness he comes across, she refuses to see how unhappy he makes everyone and I guess it’s because she would then have to think about why she’s even with him anymore, and so on, and that’s a hell of a lot of work for a ignorant, lazy family to attempt. Since he is rapidly losing money, turning to alcohol as a friend, he's just getting progressively more aggressive, and utterly repulsive, he is the personification of disgusting. 

Not that I care about his well being, I do however care about the increase in bruises I'm receiving more and more often. </p><p>I've got cuts and bruises everywhere thanks to him and his stupid slob of a son. The ones implanted on my wrists are also increasing, not like that damned family would care. I'm just glad i'm not there for a while, i think the last remaining strain of sanity i have left would entirely disintegrate, rot away with everything else that occupies that house.</p><p>I'm currently on the train to Hogwarts, Ron and hermione are fighting over chocolate frogs. I would join in, I do love my chocolate frogs, but right now I have more important matters to think about, like why on earth Malfoy is outside the door staring at me. I dart my attention to him and tell my friends that I'm going to the toilet, something in me doesn’t want them to know the real reason of my departure.

 Leaving the carriage I start walking down the train self consciously, as I'm entirely too aware of the eyes glued to my back, burning into me.</p><p>"Where do you think you're going, Potter?" I roll my eyes at the blonde haired irritating wizard behind me as I turn around to face him.</p><p>"I'm going to the toilet, Malfoy. Why do you care?" I ask in a displeased tone.</p><p>"No reason" he stopped and looked at me, in an unusual way. He didn't have the same sarcastic yet nonchalant face he usually always wears. He almost looked like he genuinely cared about something, and I wasn't sure how to take it when he was looking at me that way. </p><p>So I turned around and started walking towards the toilet again, in an attempt to avert my attention to something other than Malfoy. I didn't need him stuck in the muddled mess of my mind longer than absolutely necessary. It would be unbearable.</p><p>Then Crabbe and Goyle appeared out of nowhere, much to my displeasure.</p><p>"Hey potter! Did your parents ever tell you not to talk to people out of your-oh wait, you don't have any parents!" They laughed delinquently and I awaited some sort of insult from Malfoy, but received nothing. Until-</p><p>"Why don't you two idiots make yourself useful and go find somewhere to sit, before I make it so you never see your parents again?" We all looked at him shocked, until Crabbe and Goyle realised he was serious and hurried off. What in the hell was that? </p><p>I tilted my head in confusion, Malfoy wearily smirked at me and traced the previous path of the two, following them to their seats I presume. What the merlin was that about? I wipe my eyes to see if I was dreaming and when nothing changes I stumble to the bathroom and evaluate whatever just happened. Did Malfoy seriously forgo an opportunity to humiliate me? Did he really just threaten his mates because they said that to me? I don't know what happened but it was sure weird.</p><p>Draco's POV</p><p>The look on his face was priceless, typical Potter expecting the worst. I can't stand when people bring his parents into arguments, I can't help but stand up for him. Actually now that I think about it, I always stand up for him. Not when he is present of course but in general. I hate my parents, well I hate my Father and the corrupt shit he leads me into doing. I would never let anyone tantalise me about deep rooted issues like parents, so why let them do it to Potter?</p><p> I would have done something by now, I’ve resisted because I don't want to loose my mother. I don't know why I care but the only reason I'm on the wrong side right now is to find out all the information I can to help The right side. Harry on the other hand loved his parents, yet he was the one to loose them, not me. To the one my father follows so pathetically.</p><p>I walk back to my carriage with the intention of using my time wisely and thinking about what I'm going to do with my year at Hogwarts, but instead think back to first year; when I tried to make friends with potter. I wanted to befriend him but apparently he did not, he shoved me away for Weasley and granger. 

Perhaps I didn't ask him in the nicest way possible but he didn't need to be so... who am I trying to kid? He had every right to turn me away, what was I thinking? Call Potter's friends 'the wrong sort' and he would accept my invite to be friends? Well done Malfoy, real commendable of you.</p><p>As for Crabbe and Goyle, they just aggravate me. They follow me around like I control them, honestly they should grow a pair and start thinking for themselves. I may hate potter but at least he stands up for himself. Thinking of such, do I really hate Potter? Maybe more like strongly dislike. Oh fuck it, I don't hate those overwhelmingly green eyes or his constant messed up hair. I think I would prefer it immensely being friends with the Gryffindor but obviously I wouldn't let anyone know that. Especially not Potter himself.</p><p>Harry's POV</p><p>We've just arrived at school, we've been moved into the main hall for assembly. It's the twizarding tournament this term, which is a selection of wizarding games. Dangerous though, incredibly dangerous, there's no guarantee you will make it out of it all alive. After all there is only one winner. Dumbledore tells us all about it, and how only over 16's can enter due to how treacherous it truly is.</p><p>I find myself getting bored with the speech, my eyes start wondering over to the Slytherin table, and over to Draco. Who is in fact already looking straight at me. How long has he been looking at me? Wait, why is he looking at me? I raise an eyebrow at him and he just smirks, like usual. </p><p>That boy is always smirking, Merlin there's no wonder every girl here genuinely swoons over him. It’s ridiculous. What's so special about him anyway? Sure he's overprotective and that's cute... To girls I'm sure. Yes he's got piercing eyes that change from silver to blue for some weird reason that I cant help but appreciate. Bright blonde hair that shapes his face perfectly, and weirdly prominent pink lips, but still. I don't know why anyone would be so obsessed with him.</p><p>I snap out of my thoughts and realise he's still looking at me. I furrow my eyebrows and tilt my head. As if to silently ask him why he is staring. That is until Crabbe drags Malfoy's attention over to him, I scowl at Crabbe and Malfoy does the same. I can't make out what they are saying from here but Draco looks pretty annoyed. He's ignoring everything Crabbe is saying and that's pretty obvious. I'm yet again dragged from the harsh reality of my too far gone to be saved mind, because of Ron and Hermione whispering loudly to me.</p><p>"I bet ya' anythin' Fred and George will try nd' get their names into the goblet of fire" Ron laughs to us. Me and hermione both nod and laugh in agreement.</p><p>"Of course they will Ronald, they're mischievous little devils" We all laugh and talk on from there until our attention is turned to Dumbledore as he excuses us all from the main hall to our dorm rooms, to get settled for the year. On the way to the towers I get dragged away from my friends causing me to stumble in a panicked mode. I look to see who is pulling me behind a corner only to be greeted by Malfoy!?</p><p>"What are you doing Malfoy?" He's been acting strange since what happened on the way here and I want to know why.</p><p>"You won't be trying to get your name in the cup will you potter? You're not that stupid right?" He asks, he sounds concerned but I must be hearing things.</p><p>"Of Course I won't be, I want this to be a slightly less eventful year, trouble has found a way of getting me every other year. Anyway, Why do you care?"</p><p>"It does doesn't it? Well you are the 'chosen one' after all. I must be going though. Pansy will be wondering where I am and I'm sure your um friends will be wondering where you've gotten to. As for why I'm asking, I'm just wondering, you do seem to get yourself into a lot of messed up shit. Just checking you weren't completely dense."</p><p>"I don't purposely get myself into all this Malfoy!"</p><p>"I know, I'm just checking okay?" He says in a soft voice, a tone I'm not used to from him. He walks away but I call out to him, not satisfied enough with his vagueness.</p><p>"Malfoy! Wait there! Why are you um, why are you being slightly nice to me?" I ask, already wishing I didn't.</p><p>"Uh, because" I step a little bit closer so nobody can hear. Draco looks down at his fingers and takes a step back. I could have sworn his eyes changed colour.</p><p>"Oh god! See ya Potter!" Malfoy sprints down the hallway and into the closest bathroom. I contemplated running after him, thinking of possible reasons he could have ran away startled but nothing comes to mind. I end up going after him anyway. I run all the way to the bathroom in an absent state of mind but stop suddenly outside the door due to hearing an odd, unsettling growling noise from the other side of the door. I step inside cautiously and what I saw next couldn't have shocked me more.</p>
