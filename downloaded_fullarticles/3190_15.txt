    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>It was past three in the morning when Draco was woken up by the silvery otter bounding into his bed. As Head Boy he had to work closely with the Head Girl, but even if they got along far better now than in previous years, it couldn't be anything good if Hermione Granger was reaching out to him of all people at this time of the night.</p>
<p><em>"Malfoy, we're at a party in Muggle London. They may have slipped something into our drinks. Pansy's passed out and I don't feel good either. I'm scared I'll splinch us if I try to apparate. Please, can you come and get us? I'll owe you for this." </em>Her patronus finished off by giving him an address.</p>
<p>Draco rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. Why the hell Granger was bothering him and not one of her boy toys? Surely, she should be calling her boyfriend at a time like this! He remembered then why she couldn't. As members of the Order of the Phoenix, both Weasley and Potter were handpicked to join the Junior Auror Program. While the rest of them had only just finished with their NEWTs, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum were already undergoing full time training to become Aurors. How was this acceptable, yet any bias in favour of Purebloods considered unfair?</p>
<p>He wasn't really worried about the two witches. Even drunk, Granger and Pansy were formidable enough to handle a few Muggle boys, but with Pansy involved, it was in his best interest to go help them out. Pans was a good friend but she could be quite the insufferable nag when crossed.</p>
<p>It was the end of the school year, yet he still had to grow accustomed to the fact that Pansy and Granger were close enough as friends to party together now. It all started with what had been a disastrous summer for Pansy.</p>
<p>After her father was arrested and their house confiscated by the Ministry to pay restitution to his victims, it became clear to Pansy, and others, that the Parkinsons were not as wealthy as they portrayed. Almost overnight, Pansy went from being a spoilt Pureblood aristocrat to a homeless person who would need to work to support herself post graduation. Pansy slipped into a spiral of depression, which only worsened once school began and some of the students began to bully her for being the daughter of a convicted Death Eater. Of course, none of her bullies dared to harass Draco or Theo, whose families were far too wealthy to meddle with. While Pansy normally never shied away from confrontations- her razor sharp tongue cutting down friend and foe alike- in her depressed state, she took to shutting herself away to avoid the insults and hexes. All the skipped meals and the lack of proper sleep took its toll- Pansy began to visibly fade away. That is when Granger, patron saint of the hopeless and slayer of tyrants, swooped in to rescue Pansy.</p>
<p>Granger sat beside Pansy during mealtimes, in the classes they shared together and even in the library. She never spoke to Pansy, other than to greet her, but her mere presence deterred Pansy's bullies, who probably didn't wish to upset the Head Girl. Pansy initially resented, what she thought was, charity from Granger, until she realised the other girl was genuinely concerned about her well-being. It took a month for them to start talking and another to become friends, each one proving to be a good influence on the other- Pansy became more responsible about her schoolwork and optimistic about her future, while Granger became less uptight and better informed about the inner workings of Pureblood society.</p>
<p>On his way out of the Slytherin Dormitory, Draco noted the Common Room was abandoned, like most Saturday nights this school year. Students were either asleep in their respective beds or out partying. As adults, this year's lot of Seventh Years were permitted to leave the school premises on weekends, provided their schoolwork wasn't affected or their fellow students inconvenienced by their comings and goings. Consequently, most Seventh Years preferred to stay out on a Saturday night and return to school only once it was breakfast hour, early Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Approaching the apparition point outside the school gates, Draco wondered why Granger didn't bother calling on Theo or even Blaise for help. Granger's silent support of Pansy had won the two Pureblood snobs over; they went from referring to Granger as a Mudblood behind her back, to becoming friends with her. It was no longer unusual for Pansy, Blaise and Theo to visit Granger in the Gryffindor Common Room or to find Granger hanging out with his friends in the Slytherin dorms.</p>
<p>Blaise and Theo weren't the only boys who would jump at the chance to help the Head Girl. In his opinion, there were far too many boys smitten with Granger for some reason. Okay, so the reason was not exactly a mystery. Granger was the typical girl-next-door- a modest sort of beauty, possessing a degree of charm that let her win people over with her personality. Her intelligence and magical prowess were simply the icing on the cake. All of which didn't matter because of her blood status. It was a real shame Granger was a Muggleborn as she would've made for an ideal life partner for any ambitious wizard. It was an even greater shame that she would be wasted on the likes of Ronald Weasley, for there was no way any Pureblood of rank or wealth would willingly sully his bloodline by marrying a Mudblood.</p>
<p>He doubted Granger thought as highly of him. Even if they had gotten to know each other a little better- as they performed Head duties together, and her friend circle included Slytherins for a change- he wasn't sure if she actually saw him when she looked at him or just the Mark on his arm. He harboured no delusions that Granger contacting him late in the night meant something. Out of everyone she could have called for help, he was the only she could be sure would be sober and in bed at this hour. It was part of the terms of his probation after all.</p>
<p>When the Death Eaters broke into the school at the end of their Sixth Year and nearly killed the Headmaster, the school chose to close its gates for the safety of its students. In the midst of growing speculation about the possible return of the Dark Lord, the school remained shut for nearly a year while the Death Eaters perpetrated attacks on St. Mungos, the Ministry, the Prophet, Gringotts and several other prominent institutions around the country. However, the Ministry dealt them a swift blow when the Aurors, acting on the intelligence they received from the Order of the Phoenix, succeeded in nipping the problem at the bud. Lucius Malfoy, who was unlucky enough to be caught in the act of resurrecting the Dark Lord using a horcrux, was given the Kiss, and other Death Eaters, like Pansy's and Theo's fathers, were carted off to serve lifetime sentences in Azkaban.</p>
<p>Draco came close to receiving a one-way ticket to Azkaban himself. Fortunately for him, his mother had insisted he be excluded and kept far away from any Death Eater activities while he was a student. They could not convict him of any crime, yet the Ministry couldn't entirely ignore the Dark Mark he bore, which branded him as one of the terrorists. Professors Snape and Dumbledore convinced the Ministry to set him free on the condition he keep his nose clean for the next five years. Any infraction on his part, no matter how trivial, would disqualify him from ever applying for any work related to the Ministry or running for any elected position in Great Britain. In addition, he would automatically qualify for the maximum punishment possible for any offence he committed. Five years of responsible behaviour in exchange for his freedom, had struck Draco as a pretty good deal. His probation was the reason Draco was most likely the only one of their classmates not out getting pissed on a Saturday night.</p>
<p>He was still very sleepy and going to have to report to Madame Pince early next morning for Library duty.</p>
<p>'I'll owe you', Granger's patronus had promised. She bloody well did.</p>
<p>He had yet to decide what he was going to extract from her as payment, but he would make sure it was something good- like making her write essays for all the Slytherin Firsties or show up to their graduation ceremony in Slytherin colours...</p>
<p>Draco arrived at the location provided by Granger. The sound of loud music let him know which one was the right house. He walked past several of those motor vehicles the Muggles liked to use to transport themselves, repressing a shudder at the prospect of being trapped in one of those metal contraptions. As he drew closer to the house his nose was assaulted by a strange blend of odours, while out of the corner of his eye he was sure he saw someone vomiting into a bush. The house appeared filled to capacity, with some teenagers scattered around the lawn- one of them almost knocking him down as they ran past him. He had skipped his robes, opting to wear a simple shirt and trousers combination in an attempt to fit in, but looking at the attire of the Muggle teens around him, he knew he had failed.</p>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed already by the odd sounds, scents, and strangely dressed people, Draco was contemplating turning around and having someone else come to get Granger and Pansy; he did not want to face the daunting task of entering the house and searching for them amongst the sea of Muggles. To his great relief, just then, he happened to spot Granger seated on one of the benches on the front lawn. The area was poorly lit and Granger appeared to have her hair tamed into some sort of bun, which explained why he failed to spot her sooner. There was a girl passed out on her lap, who he assumed was Pansy, but couldn't be sure as her hair covered her face. A large male hovered over Granger in an over familiar manner that was clearly making her uncomfortable; luckily for the boy, there were laws forbidding the use of magic before Muggles or he would have been staring at the business end of Granger's wand.</p>
<p>Granger's eyes fell upon him and lit up; she smiled at him in a way he couldn't believe was directed at him. "There you are, Draco!" Her voice came out a bit too loud and shrill.</p>
<p>The Muggle boy, who until now only had eyes for Granger, finally turned. His expression turned sour when he found Draco standing behind him.</p>
<p>"See, I told you my brother would be here soon. We'll manage on our own now, thank you."</p>
<p>Granger had used her prissiest voice to dismiss the bulky Muggle boy.</p>
<p>"Brother?" he mouthed, raising an eyebrow. She responded by looking at him with such pathetic puppy dog eyes that he decided to play along.</p>
<p>The Muggle boy was either too drunk or too dense to understand he had been given the shake off, but since he refused to leave, Draco knew he needed to step in.</p>
<p>"Come on, sis. Let's go. If we're not home soon, mother and father are bound to show up."</p>
<p>Granger stood up and stepped into the light making his eyes nearly bug out when he got a good look at her. With the exception of the Yule Ball in their Fourth Year, Granger never appeared to put much thought into her grooming beyond basic hygiene. The way she usually wore her hair, he doubted she even owned a hairbrush ... Yet here she stood, wearing a peach coloured top with a wide neck, that had slipped to reveal delicate collar bones and a rounded shoulder; and a flared white skirt that was of modest length but moved with the slightest breeze to reveal shapely thighs. She wore just enough makeup to draw attention to her bright eyes and pouty lips. Despite her short stature, her legs looked endless as she stood unsteadily in a pair of high heels and seeing the brightly painted toenails peeking out of her sandals, Draco thought even her toes looked cute and suckable.</p>
<p>Granger's move to stand dislodged Pansy from her lap. Pansy raised her head and looked around. Noticing Draco, she cried out, "Dwakie-poo" then burst into a fit of giggles holding the side of her stomach. She stood up, grabbing Granger for support and rested her head heavily on Granger's shoulder. "Our Shave-yurrrr," she mumbled before closing her eyes and going quiet again.</p>
<p>Granger rolled her eyes, wrinkling her pert nose. "She's been like this for the last hour. I didn't know how to handle her by myself anymore."</p>
<p>Pansy wore a slinky dress that perfectly showed off her tight body. But seeing Pansy all dressed up was nothing new. Granger on the other hand ... He stared at her incredulously, trying not to notice how her tits bounced in her top as she struggled to keep both Pansy and herself upright. </p>
<p>
  <em>Merlin! Did she cast a spell on her chest? Where had those things sprung from? </em>
</p>
<p>Having only seen the witch in her school robes he had failed to notice just how much she had grown up. Granger's assets were so nicely displayed in her Muggle attire, for the first time, Draco considered that perhaps the Muggles did get some things right. He quickly changed his mind when he noticed other boys ogling Granger as well. It almost made him angry that he wasn't the only one who got to see her this way. So as much as he was enjoying the skin-show it made him want to cover her up as well. Draco felt truly conflicted.</p>
<p>"Hey, you don't plan to walk home, do you? Why don't I give you a ride?" the clueless Muggle boy suggestively offered while eyeing Granger and Pansy.</p>
<p>"No, thank you-" Draco stepped forward. "I'm here to give them a ride." He copied the boy's phrasing, unaware of how the Muggles referred to their transport vehicles.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Draco's obviously parked down the road," Granger lied smoothly. "Not like there's room here-" she waved her hand around.</p>
<p>Seeing her wobble in her heels, Draco instantly reached out, grabbing her waist to steady her before she toppled over.</p>
<p>"By Salazar! How drunk are you?" he swore, doing his best to look away from the jiggling motion made by her breasts. </p>
<p><em>Was she even wearing a bra?</em> </p>
<p>Dammit! This was Mudblood Granger, he wasn't supposed to be noticing her breasts or any other part of her.</p>
<p>"Am not. I just had a couple of drinks, I swear." Oddly enough, she sounded sincere even if her words did come out slurred.</p>
<p>"Malfoy, I'm so sorry for disturbing you like this," she said to him when they finally began to move away from the scene of the party.</p>
<p>Draco walked ahead holding Pansy firmly by the waist; she was certain to pass out any minute now. Granger followed closely behind.</p>
<p>"So what happened?" -He looked around them for a discreet spot they could use to disapparate without being noticed by the Muggle teens loitering on the street- "How did you end up here?" He was curious, he didn't think Granger belonged here anymore than he did.</p>
<p>In her drunken state Granger may have struggled to keep up with his brisk pace, or maybe it was the high heels that made her walk slowly behind them- he couldn't say for sure since he didn't bother turning to check. She took her time to respond to his question and when she spoke, enunciated her words in the exaggerated manner of one desperately trying not to sound drunk.</p>
<p>"We were partying at the Patels' residence because they are away on a business trip. Terry Boot mentioned leaving for a Muggle party in London. He asked if anyone wanted to join him-"</p>
<p>Draco knew exactly why Boot would've wanted to go to a Muggle party. Boot was one of those Purebloods who chased after Muggle girls because, he claimed, they were an easy lay. Whether there was any truth to his claim or not, Boot was never one to skip the opportunity to be around young Muggle women.</p>
<p>"- Obviously, no one wanted to leave a fantastic party thrown by the Patel twins in their amazing house for some random house party in the suburbs ... No one, except for Pansy that is. She <strong>insisted </strong>we go because she wanted to see how Muggles partied."</p>
<p>Having found a suitable spot, Draco waited for Granger to catch up. He unfortunately happened to look her way just in time to see the morning breeze tease the edge of her skirt. It was quick, but he thought he caught a flash of white lace.</p>
<p>Draco kept an arm firmly wrapped around Pansy and touched Granger only to the extent needed to successfully apparate them. On arriving, he led them through the school gates and then pulled out his broom, expanding it to its normal size. He carefully draped Pansy over the broom, using a sticking spell to hold her in place, then climbed on, one hand held Pansy and the other gripped the handle of the broom.</p>
<p>Granger was the last to climb on. She sat behind him during the broom ride, and either the chilly night air or her fear of flying made her cling to him, torso pressed against his back and face buried between his shoulder blades. He could feel her warm breath and soft breasts even through his shirt. He swore he could even feel her nipples poking at his back.</p>
<p>Seriously, was she not wearing a bra? She was distracting him to the point he feared they'd fall off the broom and break their necks.</p>
<p>By the time they landed inside the Astronomy tower, Draco decided the fates were punishing him by making him hyper-aware of Granger's body. Luckily, Pansy served up the perfect diversion.</p>
<p>He was in the process of shrinking his broom when Pansy turned to the side and began to throw up. The sight, sound and scent of her retching put him off any lusty thoughts about Granger, who like a good friend held Pansy's hair away from her face and gently rubbed circles on her back while Pansy vomited. When she was done, Draco used his wand to give Pansy some water to rinse out her mouth and clean up the mess before taking her to the dungeons.</p>
<p>He was expecting Granger to leave at this point and return to her dorm room in the Gryffindor tower, but she didn't.</p>
<p>"Can I spend the night in the Slytherin dorms?" she asked hesitantly. "It's just that, we were supposed to be out all night and I offered Ginny the use of the Head Girl dormitory. I don't want to ruin her sleep by showing up at this hour."</p>
<p>Ah, so it was perfectly fine to ruin <strong>his</strong> sleep, but the same was not okay where the She-Weasel was concerned!</p>
<p>As much as her reason annoyed him, he agreed to let her crash in their dorms. Truth be told, he wasn't really ready to part with Granger yet.</p>
<p>They slowly made their way to the Slytherin Common Room and then climbed the stairs leading to the Head Boy dormitory. Since Granger was spending the night in the dungeon and he needed to be up again in a few hours, he thought it would be simpler to let both witches take his bed while he slept in the Common Room. It seemed like a better option than waking up Pansy's roommates just so she could sleep in her own bed.</p>
<p>As they helped settle Pansy on the bed, Draco was reminded again of how funny the school could be when it came to certain rules. While he couldn't enter the girls dorms, there was nothing stopping them from entering his!</p>
<p>Draco picked up his pillow and blanket, as well as a fresh set of dress robes for the next day and left the bedroom. He was surprised to find Granger following him instead of turning in herself. He turned to ask her if she needed anything and noticed her heel catch in the loose end of the carpet. She was already stumbling forward but just in time, he grabbed her by the waist and pulled her against him.</p>
<p>"Whoa," she exclaimed, sounding a little stunned. "Thanks."<br/> <br/> Because he was a guy, pressed as she was against him, Draco first noticed Granger's arse. She had the kind of plump backside he found attractive. Slender hips and pert little bottoms, though fashionable, were more suited to little girls. Merlin knows how many weekends he spend at the Three Broomsticks this year, drooling at the sight of Madame Rosmerta's wide hips and round arse as she went about serving her customers. An arse like that said, this was a real woman who could handle a good pounding from his cock. </p>
<p>The next thing Draco noticed was how well Granger fit against his body. He wasn't tall by any means- even if he did finally experience a growth spurt two years ago- but Granger was so short, even standing upright in heels, he could still easily tuck her head under his chin. This position allowed him to inhale the appetising blend of warm vanilla and coconut drifting from her hair, along with the odour of whatever foul alcohol she had consumed that night.</p>
<p>"No problem," he muttered through gritted teeth, frustrated with himself. Why was he suddenly so aware of everything about her!<br/> <br/> "You okay?" he asked when she didn't immediately step away from him.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm okay," she replied in a breathy voice and finally moved.</p>
<p>She didn't seem eager to go to bed as she settled into the nearest armchair. Draco tried not to look at the portion of her legs left exposed when she sat down, choosing to distract himself by transfiguring one of the leather armchairs into a comfortable bed for himself. He hoped she took the hint and finally let him go to sleep.</p>
<p>"So ... I feel like I haven't seen you in ages." She fiddled with the hem of her skirt, unmindful of how it rode further up her thighs.<br/> <br/> "We see each other every day during class, Granger." He tried to keep his eyes on the fire burning in the fireplace instead of her skin, which looked so warm in its glow.<br/> <br/> "Yeah, but you don't join the rest of us when we do fun stuff. I know Pansy misses you, though she won't say it, but she does."<br/> <br/> "Well, she knows the condition of my probation. I can't be out partying at all hours and getting wasted like the rest of you."<br/> <br/> "I understand, but it's not just the parties. You don't join us for group study or even when we're just hanging out in the common room," she said, her dark eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>Her eyes looked luminous in the glow of the firelight. How come he'd never noticed that about her before? Like melted chocolate, they were so warm and inviting.</p>
<p>"You know once we're done with school, we'll all be gone our individual ways, we really won't see each other anymore."<br/> <br/> Draco raised an eyebrow at the absurdity of her suggestion. "You forget how small wizarding Britain is, Granger. I'm sure we'll run into each other plenty of times. In fact, seeing how we're both planning to work at the Ministry, running into each other may become unavoidable," he said, giving a faint chuckle.</p>
<p>Then turning serious, he asked, "So what really happened tonight? I would never have expected such stupid behaviour from you."<br/> <br/> "Oh, because you've never done anything stupid." She stared at the part of his arm where the sleeve of his shirt hid his Dark Mark.</p>
<p>He didn't like her looking at his arm, but at least she had a high enough opinion of him to suggest his reasons for joining the Death Eaters were stupid and not anything sinister.</p>
<p>"Don't try to change the subject; we're talking about you. Are you going to give me some kind of explanation for tonight or not?"</p>
<p>"There's nothing to it really," she said with a sulk. "Two minutes after we got to the Muggle party, Terry and Tony -- Oh yeah, Anthony Goldstein was there too. I think he was the one who told Terry about the party. Anyway, we get here and they take off. I didn't see them again for the rest of the time we were there. Some of the Muggle boys saw us by ourselves and pushed these glasses filled with drinks in our hands. We didn't think twice before accepting them because it looked like everyone else was drinking the same thing.</p>
<p>"I thought it was odd when Pansy started talking funny after her first drink- I've seen her hold her own against a bottle of Ogden's. I wanted to leave right then, but Pansy thought some of the boys looked cute and wanted to dance with them ... They kept handing us more drinks but I had no more than two glasses as I was feeling dizzy by then. We weren't even there an hour before Pansy was struggling to stay conscious.</p>
<p>"I remembered all those stories my parents would tell me about parties where girls were drugged and taken advantage of when they passed out. So I made sure we remained in the entrance hallway the whole time. I refused to go upstairs or let them help when they offered to let Pansy sleep it off on the bed. Soon as I got the chance, I snuck us into the bathroom and sent you a patronus, then dragged Pansy to the lawn out front, figuring no one would try anything out in the open."</p>
<p>Granger's concern wasn't for her own safety, she obviously knew how to handle a wand. Her concern was over being provoked into performing magic before Muggles. Had things reached that stage, they both knew the good old patriarchs in the Wizengamot would have ruled against Granger; they would disregard any claim of self-defence on the grounds that the two witches had wilfully endangered themselves with their irresponsible behaviour.</p>
<p>"It was so stupid of us to even go there," said Granger in a quiet voice, absentmindedly playing with the hem of her skirt again. "We were having such a good time at the Patels," she said wistfully. "Justin even said he thought I had a nice arse, tonight."</p>
<p>"Justin?" he asked trying to work out who it was.</p>
<p>"From Hufflepuff," she replied brightly.</p>
<p>"Finch-Fletchley?"</p>
<p>She nodded enthusiastically. "He's gorgeous, isn't he? I want to fuck him," she blurted excitedly.</p>
<p>"Salazar's salty nutsack! What the fuck, Granger!" She still had to be under the influence of whatever she was given to drink, otherwise she would not have felt emboldened to talk to him in such a manner.</p>
<p>He did not want to think about Granger fucking. He did not want to think about it, yet he couldn't stop imagining Granger bouncing on Finch-Fletchley's cock as she gave him the ride of his life.</p>
<p>She giggled, daintily covering her mouth with her hand. "Sorry. I forgot. Girls like me aren't supposed to have thoughts like that. I'm supposed to faint at the very idea of sex, right?"</p>
<p>Sexist as it made him, she wasn't entirely wrong; though there was another reason he was surprised by her declaration.</p>
<p>"Actually, I was thinking about Weasley" -although it was easy enough to see why someone would prefer a fairy to the redhead- "your <em>boyfriend</em>."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>She blushed, looking away and then her face suddenly crumpled.</p>
<p>"Ronald broke up with me. He said I've changed too much; I'm not the girl he fell in love with- whatever that's supposed to mean." Her chin rose defiantly. "I'm free to fuck whoever I choose."</p>
<p>It sounded like Granger did still have feelings for Weasley, not that he cared about Granger's love life, it was simply better than thinking about her sex life. Draco had had just about enough of thinking about Granger and sex for one night.</p>
<p>Gods, he needed her to leave so he could have a quick wank before he went back to sleep.</p>
<p>"So," asked Granger, coming to stand before him, "the deal?"</p>
<p>He must have spaced out because he had no idea what she was on about.</p>
<p>"Granger, I'm tired," he said in an annoyed tone, "I've got library duty in three hours and I need to put the finishing touches on two essays tomorrow for the apprenticeship position I'm seeking. I need to get some sleep so I can function properly tomorrow."<br/> <br/> "I only wanted to thank you, Malfoy," she said, her chin wobbled as if she was trying to hold back tears. "I do feel really bad about this. I'd be willing to do anything to make it up to you."<br/> <br/> How melodramatic. He rolled his eyes at her.<br/> <br/> "Seriously, Malfoy. Anything."<br/> <br/> Maybe it was the submissive tone to her voice, or the vulnerable way she held herself, but he suddenly had an idea.</p>
<p>Running a hand through his pale hair, a contrast to Granger's, he looked her up and down as she stood before him.</p>
<p>"Turn around," he told her.<br/> <br/> "What?" she asked in confusion.<br/> <br/> "Turn around," he ordered. "Place your hands wide apart, flat down on that table."<br/> <br/> Oh, he was sure he was pretty close to, if not actually crossing, some forbidden line, but he couldn't help himself.</p>
<p>Granger continued to stare at him, her expression changing gradually from confusion to defiance. So he helped her.</p>
<p>For the third time that night, his hands made their way to her waist to physically turn her around and walk her the few steps to the ornate marble table standing against the wall.</p>
<p>"Hands," he reminded.<br/> <br/> "What are you doing?" she asked, but did as he said.<br/> <br/> "Didn't you say you were willing to do anything? Well, since I was woken up and made to leave my bed at an ungodly hour just to help a couple of irresponsible teens, maybe all I want is payback by causing you some discomfort in return."<br/> <br/> "Oh, you can be so childish," Granger muttered and then looked at him over her shoulder. "So, what do want me to do now?"<br/> <br/> "Bend over and lay against the table."<br/> <br/> She appeared to contemplate what he was asking of her.</p>
<p>"You can't be serious, Malfoy."<br/> <br/> "I am absolutely serious, Granger. Now, were you serious when you said you'd do anything or were you just lying to me?"<br/> <br/> She exhaled sharply then did as he asked.</p>
<p>"It's cold," she gasped soon as her body made contact with the cool surface of the table.<br/> <br/> The dungeons were usually cooler than the rest of the castle and the marble, no doubt, would have felt chilly against her skin. Draco imagined her nipples stiffening as the cold penetrated her top.</p>
<p>He stepped back and took a moment to admire the view. Her skirt barely covered her well-rounded bottom. No wonder even that poofter Finch-Fletchley couldn't resist commenting on it- it really was a nice arse.</p>
<p>She tensed as his hands gripped her hips. "Malfoy, what are you -"<br/> <br/> "So Finch-Fletchley said you had a nice arse, huh? Let's confirm if he was right, shall we?" <br/> <br/> She didn't get the chance to respond as he had already flipped her skirt up.</p>
<p>Draco thought he was going to have a heart attack seeing her thick arse framed by a lacy white thong. Caught off guard by the stunning visual, he found himself acting mindlessly on instinct alone. His hand moved and one finger hooked itself inside the narrow scrap of lace that ran down the middle to disappear between the cheeks of her arse. He slid his finger up and down the strip of fabric a few times before letting it go with a snap against her skin.</p>
<p>"Fuck!" he groaned softly.<br/> <br/> "That's not funny, Malfoy!" Granger snarled in response. She made to stand up, but he stopped her.</p>
<p>"Relax Granger." Placing his palm, fingers spread, over the centre of her back he pressed down on her. "It won't be so bad, and it'll be over soon," he reassured.</p>
<p>Then, without warning, he raised his hand and brought it down with force on her bare cheek.</p>
<p>Granger cried out, probably from shock as much as the sting of the hit, while a mesmerised Draco watched her supple flesh jiggle and turn red. Far from being disgusted that he was enjoying watching Granger like this, the thought of breaking some kind of taboo with the Muggleborn only excited him further.</p>
<p>"You're dead," she swore, but he ignored the threat.</p>
<p>"That was for being naive enough to think Terry Boot was the kind of guy you could safely go out and get drunk with."</p>
<p>Granger squirmed a little, not as much as she could have and definitely not enough to slip out of his grip. He raised his hand and spanked her other cheek, making her cry out once more. This one had to hurt; it was forceful enough to make her body slide up the table by a couple of inches.</p>
<p>"That was for disturbing me while I was asleep." His casual tone was sure to irk her further, but the sum of his experiences with the witch below him had led him to conclude that, a riled up Granger was a fun Granger, at least where he was concerned.</p>
<p>Since both cheeks were now a lovely shade of red, he aimed the next blow at the space where her arse met her thigh.</p>
<p>She didn't howl in pain, like he expected. Tough girl that she was, she blew out her breath through gritted teeth. Something about the way she was willing to simply lie and take his punishment made his cock stir.</p>
<p>"That's for being irresponsible with your drinking."</p>
<p>This was bound to piss her off and sure enough, she barked, "Fuck off!" in response. Except, her voice was far too breathy to sound angry like she meant to.</p>
<p>He delivered the next strike to the meatiest part of her bum, followed by him groping the mounds of flesh. Pressing himself against her body, he brought his lips to her ears and whispered, "That one was for dressing like a <em>slut</em>."</p>
<p>Goose pimples appeared on her forearms and he suspected her face was red as her bum.</p>
<p>"I disagree," she firmly stated, but made no objection to the way he was handling her.</p>
<p>He massaged her cheeks with his free hand, and for a moment, it felt as if she was pressing into his palm. He was close to her inner thigh now, dangerously close to Granger's pussy. Drawn to the forbidden, he defiantly dipped two fingers between her thighs. She moaned softly, the sound going straight to his cock. He stilled completely as his fingers made contact with the warm and damp crotch of her panties.</p>
<p>"Why are you wet, Granger?"</p>
<p>"I'm not."</p>
<p>She swore loudly as the fifth spank was delivered directly to the base of her cunt.</p>
<p>"That's for lying."</p>
<p>"Knock it off, Malfoy!"</p>
<p>All rational thought abandoned, his index finger lightly ran the length of her gash from top to bottom. Her knees buckled, but he caught her. From behind, his dick nestled perfectly in the cradle of her thighs. In that moment, Draco wanted nothing more than to undo his trousers, rip her thong away, and slip into her- so what if she was a Muggleborn, and wanted to fuck Finch-Fletchley while she was still in love with Weasley. </p>
<p>"You want me to stop?" he asked, thrusting shallowly against her. He was throbbing. </p>
<p>"You have to."</p>
<p>"Because you'd rather have Finch-Fletchley do this you?" Her pussy spread perfectly against his repeated motions, so he took his hand off her back and gripped her ass for leverage.</p>
<p>This was beyond fucked. This was fucking brilliant!</p>
<p>"Oh," she moaned. "Merlin!"</p>
<p>The little noises coming out of her mouth only drove him further crazy.</p>
<p>"Or maybe it's because I was a Death Eater? Is that it?"</p>
<p>He took a step back, but only to push her thong to the side. "...Because I'm not supposed to want to be inside your tight little Muggleborn cunt, right?"</p>
<p>Granger was unbelievably drenched, his fingers slipping against her soft wet lips with ease as he sought her entrance. She was the forbidden fruit he was meant to look away from, yet he thrust into her, ripping a muffled scream from her as his finger invaded her tight channel. </p>
<p>"Oh fuck. Oh yes," he breathed, feeling how tightly her pussy clung to his finger. He wished it were his cock being squeezed instead.</p>
<p>"Draco," she pleaded, her voice filled with such need. "You have to stop."  </p>
<p>"I know, I know sweetheart," he murmured, pressing a kiss to her exposed back. "I know."</p>
<p>It was madness, he knew it, but his thumb found her swollen clit, teasing it in a way that made her groan and grind her arse against him, and Draco wished never to be sane again.</p>
<p>Her juices trickled down his fingers, coating his hand. He wanted to taste it, to taste <em>her</em>, but he couldn't stop now, not when she was so close. He could tell, from the way she was trembling she was just about ready to come. He tried to help her get there faster.</p>
<p>Draco alternated between rubbing circles around her clit and flicking it. Just as he sensed the tension in her body, he gave her clit one last flick at the same time plunging his index and middle fingers into her pussy. She cried out, her body going rigid beneath him and the walls of her tight passage fluttering around his fingers as she climaxed. The scent of her sex filled the air and the only sounds in the room were her gasps as she tried to catch her breath.</p>
<p>He <strong>had </strong>to fuck her. Moving like a man possessed, one hand fumbled with the fly of his trousers desperate to free his cock while the other grabbed her hip, fingers slipping inside the edges of her panties, ready to rip them off and sink his cock into her wet heat.</p>
<p>Maybe she read his thoughts. Maybe he had blurted his thoughts out loud. </p>
<p>"No, not like this. Please stop, Draco," she pleaded.</p>
<p>He ignored her and lined his cock with her entrance.</p>
<p>"I'm a virgin."</p>
<p>And just like that, reality came crashing down, like a bucket of ice-cold water dumped on him while he was in the middle of a dream. Cock in hand, Draco stumbled backwards. What was he doing?</p>
<p>In a daze, he turned and walked to the nearest armchair, dropping heavily into it. His breathing was ragged and his erect penis throbbed angrily before his face. It all felt surreal- something happening to someone else, not him. He could hear Granger moving and out of the corner of his eye, saw her straighten her clothes, but not before seeing the red handprints on her arse from his blows. He looked down at his hand and saw the glistening traces of her orgasm.</p>
<p>She had asked him to stop, several times, but he was only thinking with his prick at the time, his prick that was still too hard for him to shove back into his pants. He untucked his shirt to hide his member.</p>
<p>"Hey..." whispered Granger, being the one to break the deafening silence. She remained standing beside the table.</p>
<p>He could not bring himself to face her. "Fuck, Granger- I mean, Hermione, I'm so sorry-" Even as he uttered the words they felt inadequate. He had molested and nearly raped her, an 'I'm sorry' was not going to cut it.</p>
<p>She swallowed audibly and looked away. "You should probably get some sleep. You've got Library duty in a few hours. I can sleep here."</p>
<p>"No, I - My bed is big enough, you can join Pansy upstairs. I'll be fine here. I won't disturb you. You can, erm, ward the door shut if you don't trust - I mean I won't be coming up to my room."</p>
<p>She nodded. "Do you have everything you need for the morning?" she asked quietly.</p>
<p>"It's fine. I mean, yes. I'll be fine."</p>
<p>He continued to remain frozen, shocked by his actions tonight. A few more moments of deathly silence passed before he heard her move away. By now his cock seemed to have finally accepted that it wasn't going to get any action tonight, it was soft enough he could tuck himself back in.</p>
<p>Draco moved to his transfigured bed and absentmindedly rearranged the pillow and blanket a couple of times. His heart continued to hammer in his ribcage and he could hear the sound of his blood rushing in his ears. When he settled on the bed, he felt disgusted with himself for so many reasons. He had lost his mind to the point where he abused a girl, a virgin at that, and came very close to raping her. Then there was the fact that she was a Muggleborn, instead of feeling repulsed at the prospect of touching her, he had experienced a thrill in doing the forbidden. He was a Pureblood, he was supposed to be better, yet he had acted like some animal in rut.</p>
<p>Everything felt unreal. If she ever chose to bring charges against him, he would be ruined, and rightly so- she wasn't completely sober at the time and he had taken advantage. Even if she didn't ruin his life by having him arrested she was never going forgive him.</p>
<p>"Draco, are you okay?"</p>
<p>Granger's voice snapped him out of his reverie. He saw her standing near the entrance of the passage that led to his dorm room. Even from this distance, he could see the concern on her face. He doubted she would feel the same way tomorrow. </p>
<p>"Go to sleep, Granger. I'll be fine," he reassured her.</p>
