    <p>Harry couldn't really pin-point the first time it happened. Nightmares were a regular occurrence after the war and he was used to his magic lashing out while he was asleep, so he didn't think anything by it when he woke up to find his bedroom in disarray. Merely shrugged it off and took some precautions for the next time. He also didn't really notice any other incidents, though in hindsight he was sure that there must have been quite a few. Maybe he had deliberately overlooked them.</p><p>The first time he really became aware of it was about two months after the end of the war. The dead had been buried and the memorials were finally over, as were most of the Death Eater trials. Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named new Minister for Magic and the Ministry was slowly re-organizing itself. All in all things were starting to quiet down a bit after the hectic following Voldemort's defeat and all that went with it.</p><p>Harry had mostly been staying with the Weasleys, aside from a few nights spent at Grimmauld Place and regular visits to Andromeda and Teddy. Maybe it was the fact that Mrs. Weasley had settled him in Fred and George's old room, or maybe the war had changed him more than he'd thought, but the Burrow hadn't held the same comfort and feeling of home as it usually did for him.</p><p>The first incident, as he would later come to call it, happened on a regular Sunday afternoon. All had been normal, or at least as normal as it could be these days, so far. But then Ginny asked him to accompany her on a walk. Swallowing down his feeling of unease he agreed and followed her out of the house, never noticing the hopeful smile on Molly's face as she watched them go.</p><p>They walked around aimlessly for a while, both mostly quiet, until Ginny stopped next to an old oak tree and turned to look at him. And then she asked the one question he'd been fearing for weeks. She asked what would become of them now. Whether he was ready to continue their relationship or still needed some more time.</p><p>Caught off guard, despite having anticipated something like this, Harry stammered around for a while, but in the end he somehow managed to tell her that he didn't want to continue their relationship at all. Things had changed. He had changed. Too much had happened. He wasn't the same boy who had fallen in love with her any more.</p><p>Ginny didn't understand. Of course she didn't. He'd only broken up with her to protect her, while he went off hunting Horcruxes. That had been his reasoning back then. Now that the war was over and Voldemort finally defeated for good, the danger had passed. She didn't need protection any longer. They could start their life together like she had always envisioned.</p><p>She reminded him that she'd waited for him and got angry when Harry pointed out that he'd never asked her to. He tried to explain that his feelings had simply changed. That he had changed. But all of his stuttered excuses only made it worse. They only made Ginny's anger rise. She wouldn't understand and accused him of cheating on her, even going so far as to ask who he was leaving her for.</p><p>Harry didn't really know how it happened. One second he was trying to defend himself against Ginny's hurtful accusations and the next something inside of him snapped. Only when the ginger haired girl stumbled back a few steps, her eyes wide in fear, did he notice the dark waves of magic pulsing all around himself. It felt like his magic was alive, coiling around him like a snake, ready to strike. And the worst thing was that he had no control over it.</p><p>He started to panic and his magic lashed out, hitting the old oak tree right next to them. It split in the middle and the two halves crashed to the ground, branches and leaves raining down around them. Ginny shrieked and dove for cover.</p><p>Having found their outlet, the lingering traces of magic faded away, leaving Harry feeling tired and drained. And utterly confused.</p><p>“I'm … I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...” he stammered.</p><p>Ginny looked horrified and flinched away when he stepped closer to her. But she visibly reigned in her fear and forced herself to nod.</p><p>“We should go back.” she suggested.</p><p>It was the last thing she said to him that day. Harry had no idea what exactly she told her family. Once they were back at the house he fled to his room and stayed there until Molly called him down to dinner. No-one but Ginny was looking at him much differently, so he suspected she hadn't told them what had happened exactly. But everyone seemed to know that their relationship was over for good.</p><p>Harry didn't feel comfortable staying at the Burrow after that, so he thanked Molly for her generosity and went back to Grimmauld Place. He wasn't really sure yet if he wanted to keep the house or not. It held a lot of memories, both good and bad and it was the only thing he had left of Sirius. On the other hand it was way too big for one person and he wondered if it would even be possible to make it habitable. But for the time being it seemed like the best place for him to stay. He wouldn’t go back to the Dursleys, now that he actually had a choice. And what other option did he have?</p><p>He kept most of his stuff in Sirius' old bedroom, but slept in the room he'd shared with Ron during the summer before fifth year, so he wouldn't accidentally destroy something valuable while having a nightmare. He pushed the incident with Ginny from his mind and was happy to ignore all the other, strange little things that happened.</p><p>Like that one time he got angry about something in the Daily Prophet (why Hermione still insisted on him reading that rag was beyond him) and suddenly the teapot exploded. Or the time when a strange noise outside spooked him and the mirror shattered. Or all those times he woke up to find cracks in the walls and his bedsheets ripped to pieces.</p><p>The second time he really had to acknowledge that something was wrong was a few weeks after the first. Hermione and Ron were stopping by for a visit and they all sat in the kitchen, drinking tea and enjoying Kreacher's biscuits.</p><p>“Do you have any idea when our book-lists are going to arrive?” Harry asked.<br/>
“Our what?” Ron asked.<br/>
“Our book-lists. You know, from Hogwarts. I'm not really looking forward to visiting Diagon Alley, but I guess it's better if we get it over with quickly, right?”</p><p>His two friends didn't answer. They looked uneasy for some reason. Ron was fiddling with his napkin, while Hermione stared at the far wall, biting her lip.</p><p>“Okay, what's wrong?” Harry wanted to know.<br/>
“Well, actually... Ron and I aren't going back to Hogwarts.” Hermione finally admitted.<br/>
“George offered me work at the shop. I won't need my NEWTs for that.” Ron added.<br/>
“But … when the letters came you said you'd go back. We all agreed that it would be good. You were excited about it.” Harry reminded them.</p><p>Newly appointed Headmistress McGonagall had offered every student from Harry's year the chance to return to Hogwarts and take their NEWTs, since the war had prevented them all from completing their education. They would be called eighth years. Despite the now bad memories tied to his old school, Harry had immediately jumped at the chance to return to the one place where he'd always felt most at home. And he had thought that his two best friends felt the same.</p><p>“I thought about it. We both did.” Hermione assured. “And at first it sounded like a good idea... But it's like Ron said and … now that most of the remaining Death Eaters have been caught, I can restore my parent's memories. So I'm going to Australia next month and … Ron is going to come with me.”</p><p>Harry couldn't believe his ears. They were going to Australia. Without him. They were abandoning him. And they hadn't even had the guts to tell him until now.</p><p>“And when were you planning on telling me?” he wanted to know.<br/>
“We were waiting for the right time.” Hermione claimed.<br/>
“Yeah, it just never came up, mate.” Ron added.</p><p>“It never came up? The letters arrived weeks ago.” he reminded, getting angry. “We've been talking about Hogwarts nearly every time we met. Or at least I have.” Now that he thought about it, he realized that his two best friends had been rather quiet the last couple of times he'd mentioned the school.</p><p>“You were so thrilled to be going back. We didn't want to spoil it for you, mate.” the red-head claimed.<br/>
“And of course I'm going to continue studying on my own and I'll sit my NEWTs with you in June. McGonagall already gave me her okay.” Hermione chimed in again.<br/>
“You've got it all planned out I see.”<br/>
“Harry, we really didn't...”</p><p>Suddenly her voice was drowned out by the strange ringing in his ears. Her mouth snapped shut and she stared at him in shock. Only then did Harry realize that it was happening again. His magic was rising around him in waves, ready to lash out. He fought for control, tried to push it back down, but his powers wouldn't respond. His breath was coming in short, painful gasps. Panic was overwhelming him as he realized that he would hurt Ron and Hermione if he didn't get away from them right now.</p><p>Mustering his last bit of strength he got up and stumbled out of the kitchen, desperately trying to reign in his powers. Somehow he made it into an unused room. He just managed to shut the door behind himself before he lost the weak hold he had on his magic. It exploded outwards, shattering some old pieces of furniture stowed in a corner. A chandelier crashed down next to him and two paintings were ripped from the wall.</p><p>His feet gave out and Harry dropped down to the floor in the middle of the chaos his wayward magic had created, shaking like a leaf and panting like he'd just run a marathon. For a long moment he just sat there, unable to move.</p><p>A timid knock at the door made him look up.<br/>
“Harry? Are you okay?” Hermione asked hesitantly.</p><p>He struggled to his feet and shuffled to the door, opening it only wide enough to slip through. Judging by Hermione's shocked gasp, she still managed to get a look into the destroyed room.</p><p>“Sorry.” he muttered softly.<br/>
“Are you okay?” she asked again.<br/>
“Yeah, fine. I just... I didn't mean to scare you. I... I couldn't control it.”<br/>
“Don't worry about us. It's fine.” Hermione assured, though she still looked shaken up.</p><p>But she wouldn't be the girl he knew if she'd let something scare her for long. He could practically see how she pulled herself together and started analysing the situation.<br/>
“Has that happened before?”<br/>
Harry shrugged. “Once or twice.”</p><p>He could see his friends sharing an apprehensive look and tried to reassure them.<br/>
“Hey, it's nothing. I guess I'm just... stressed or whatever. Won't happen again.”<br/>
“Harry, that didn't look like nothing.” Hermione pointed out.<br/>
“It looked like you wanted to attack us, mate.” Ron agreed.<br/>
“You know I'd never...”<br/>
“Of course we know that you'd never hurt us intentionally.” the girl hurried to assure. “But you said you couldn't control it. Harry, that's not normal. I think you should see a healer.”</p><p>***</p><p>Harry didn't want to see a healer. Anything but that. But Hermione kept insisting, telling him over and over again that she only meant well and that she was concerned for him. And when that didn't work, she pulled her trump card.</p><p>“What if it happens when you have Teddy? You wouldn't want to hurt him, would you?”</p><p>It wasn't fair, mentioning his godson. Because Harry had promised Remus that he would look after the boy. That he would be there for him and protect him. He would do anything to make sure that Teddy didn't get hurt. Even going to see a healer.</p><p>So he finally gave in and made an appointment at St. Mungo's, hoping that the press wouldn't catch wind of it. The last thing he wanted was another story in the Daily Prophet, speculating about his mental health.</p><p>***</p><p>Healer Matthews was a tall, elderly man, with bushy eyebrows, a long nose and a thin white beard. After listening to his explanation of the incidents, he poked and prodded Harry for what felt like hours, pausing only to jot down notes. When he was finally done, he asked his patient to wait while he consulted a colleague.</p><p>So Harry waited. Long minutes later healer Matthews returned with a woman in tow. She was a stout little witch, probably around Molly Weasley’s age, with horn-rimmed glasses and her blonde hair done up in a messy bun.</p><p>“Margaret Ivers, mind healer. Call me Maggie.” she introduced herself.</p><p>Then she settled down in front of him and proceeded to ask Harry all kinds of uncomfortable questions about the war, his childhood and his current living arrangements. He tried to be patient and answer honestly, but soon his temper flared and both healers got a thorough demonstration of the reason he was here.</p><p>Once Maggie had taken down her hastily created shields and healer Matthews had crawled out from under the table where he'd sought cover, they sent Harry into another room to wait again while they discussed their results. And probably fetched someone to repair the damage done to the first examination room.</p><p>After another long bout of waiting, Maggie joined Harry in the new room and started explaining.<br/>
“I believe we have found the reason for your... outbursts.” she stated rather confidently. “You have told us that when he-who-shall-not-be-named tried to kill you as a child, a piece of his soul latched onto you, correct?”</p><p>She waited for his nod, before continuing: “Well, it appears that this piece of soul has been … dampening your magic, for lack of a better word. It has been feeding off your energy. You're a very powerful young wizard, Harry. And now that this dampener is gone, you finally have full access to your considerable magical strength. But as you're not used to harnessing that much power, it needs an outlet.”</p><p>“So... you're saying that … these things only happen, because I've got more power now?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Yes and no. It's only part of the reason for your outbursts. The other, bigger part is the fact that you're obviously suffering from a severe trauma. Which is very understandable in your situation. Your powers however, react to your inner turmoil. So when you're highly emotional, especially when you're angry I suppose, your magic surges. It becomes an outlet for your anger.”</p><p>“Okay. And... what can I do to stop it?”</p><p>“Well, it's a very complex problem, so I would advise regular sessions with a mind healer to treat your condition. I think we should start off with ten sessions and see where we go from there. Since I'm already familiar with your medical history now I would be the best choice. But of course you can also choose one of my colleagues, if you prefer. ”</p><p>Great. Just what he wanted. Regular sessions with a mind healer. If the Daily Prophet caught wind of that they'd have a field day. Finally they'd get proof that he was the nutcase they had made him out to be back in fifth year.</p><p>“Isn't there anything that works a bit quicker?” Harry asked.</p><p>Maggie frowned, obviously not at all pleased with his lack of enthusiasm. “Well, of course we'll discuss coping methods in case of another outburst and I can also prescribe you some calming draught, but those can only be a part-time remedy. To stop the outbursts for good we'll have to tackle the real problem. And that will take time and patience.”</p><p>“Alright. And what about those coping methods? Can you show me some now?”<br/>
“Of course I can. I was thinking that breathing exercises will work best in your situation...”</p><p>    ***</p><p>When Harry finally left St. Mungo's (with a full bottle of Calming Draught, as well as a bottle of Dreamless Sleep potion, but without having made an appointment with Maggie or any other mind healer) it was already getting dark. He sighed in defeat when he found Ron and Hermione waiting for him in the kitchen at Grimmauld Place. He should have known.</p><p>“How was the appointment? What did the healer say?” Hermione asked immediately.</p><p>Harry explained their diagnosis and told them about the breathing exercises and potions, but conveniently “forgot” to mention that he was supposed to go back there for counselling. He felt no desire to discuss his childhood and the war with that woman. Or anyone else for that matter. And he also didn't see how that would do him any good.</p><p>Hermione seemed to notice that he wasn't telling them the whole truth, but surprisingly enough she didn't push. She only reminded him that she and Ron would always be there for him and that he should listen to the healers.</p><p>Harry decided to ignore the healers instead. What did they know anyway? He didn't need counselling. He just needed some peace and quiet. Some time to relax. And he needed people to stop annoying him. But he swallowed his pride and told Andromeda about his condition.</p><p>“I understand if you don't want me to see Teddy.” he assured.</p><p>But Andromeda wanted to hear none of that. “Nonsense. You can still see Teddy whenever you like, Harry. You're his godfather and I know that he means a lot to you. We have all suffered during the war. I know that you would never hurt him.”</p><p>Harry felt choked up. He wondered if she had any idea how much her trust, her confidence meant to him. A simple “Thank you.” didn't seem to be enough, but it was the only reply he managed. Judging by Andromeda's gentle smile, she understood.</p>
