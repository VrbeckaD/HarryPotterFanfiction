    <p>There was little Harry could do in the face of such insanity. Everyone was yelling and no one was making sense. Molly was fighting both Minerva and Albus. Snape had squared up against Sirius with Remus jumping in to fight either of them. Arthur was trying to calm down Hermione with little success and Ron was pretty much fighting everyone else.</p><p>There was nothing Harry could do but turn and walk away.</p><p>As he left Dumbledore’s office, he mused on what had led to this insanity. As per usual, it was the Dark Lord’s fault.</p>
<hr/><p>It was a normal day at Hogwarts. Good breakfast, Hedwig visited him, Ron was devouring everything in sight….</p><p>And an unknown owl touched down with a letter for him.</p><p>The envelope was unremarkable and after casting a few detection spells at it, Harry decided to open it in midst of Hermione lecturing Ron on his horrible table manners.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>If you wish to end the war, Potter, Marry me. Reply if interested. </em>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lord Voldemort</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Well…that was to the point, Harry mused. He could paly this a few ways. He could be terrified. He could be amused. He could be angry. What would give him the most amusement?</p><p>With Umbridge about and the few things he had that amused him gone, like Quidditch, what was wrong with taking things to their logical conclusion? If Old Snake Face wanted to marry him, well he could do it.</p><p>Snitching a quill and scrap of parchment from Seamus, Harry languidly wrote back.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>If you manage to get your pretty face again, I will consider it. I nominate Luna for Wedding Planner. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry Potter</em>
</p><p> </p><p>With a bit of bacon to the owl and attaching the note, the owl was winging off into the crowd of owls. Harry had the thought that if Umbridge intercepts this one, he hoped she had a heart attack from it at the very least. More reasonable response is that she would probably assign more detention to him.</p><p>“Harry, what was that?” Hermione asked as breakfast ended and they headed to their first class.</p><p>“Hm? Oh, Voldemort proposed to me to end the war. Nothing big.” Harry replied.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>And thus, the current predicament.  Harry shook his head as he made it to the Gargoyle, petting the head of the thing since he had bumped hard into it after Ron and Hermione had dragged him upstairs. Though, to be completely honest, he probably was more harmed than the gargoyle was.</p><p>Leisurely, he made his way to the entrance hall, sure that his first class, Potions, was canceled since Snape was busy fighting Sirius.</p><p>More time to muse.</p><p>He thought on why he was so chilled out. Sure, Voldemort proposing out of nowhere was a cause of concern but there was something about today. This day was just ridiculous for no reason so he didn’t mind that his responses were ridiculous.</p><p>“Are you ready for change, Harry?” Luna had appeared beside him, following his stroll. Didn’t she have class? Ah, it might be she had McGonagall and had free time. No matter.</p><p>“I am never ready for change, Luna. I have change thrust upon me,” Harry replied as they paused in the courtyard.</p><p>“The same can be said for greatness.”</p><p>A figure emerged from the shadow. Tall and lithe, the face of Tom Marvolo Riddle was a sight to behold. He looked barely outside of Hogwart’s age but possessed a timeless grace that immediately moved people away from him as he strode over to the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor pair.</p><p>Harry whistled lowly.</p><p>“Wow Tom, you clean up nice.”</p><p>“I take this moment to say you have a very good taste in men, Harry”</p><p>A sharp smile was their response from the red eyed man.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
