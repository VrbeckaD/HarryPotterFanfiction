    <p>It was finally the beginning of the sixth year, and Harry had to admit that he was a cross between excited and nervous. He was thankful to get away from his Aunt and Uncle, if he could even call them that, but his crush on Draco had grown bigger over the past five years. And now, at the age of sixteen, he was nearly head over heels for the young Malfoy boy. He hated it, and he hated himself for it. He had yet to tell anyone but he was sure that Hermione and Ron were catching on. Hermione was way too observant to not notice. He and Ron, as well as the rest of the Weasley family, were stood beside the Hogwarts Express as the small goodbyes were said between them all. Once he had given a small hug to Arthur, he turned to take in the train, as well as a few of the other people around them. And that's when he noticed Draco Malfoy with Lucius. He clenched his jaw, turning his attention back to Ron and his family.</p>
<p>Draco sighed and turned to his mother and lightly pushed her hand off him. "Mom. I look fine. Stop messing with my hair. I need to go." That's when he noticed Potter walking by with the Weasley's. Scoffing to himself he glared in his direction then nodded at his parents before speeding his way past Potter and onto the train. </p>
<p>Harry was trying to focus on whatever it was Molly was trying to remind him of. His mind was elsewhere though, as he thought about his crush. He felt a slight breeze, and he turned his gaze again to see Draco making his way on the train. He glanced at the other Malfoys, which resulted in more glares, before he gave Ron's sleeve a gentle tug. "We should probably get going. I'm sure Hermione's already on the train." He commented.</p>
<p>After getting settled on the train, Draco decided he really needed some chocolate frogs and went in search of the sweets trolley. That's when he ran into Him. Mister "Chosen One"  aka the person who Draco couldn't figure out why every time he saw him he felt the need to tease and annoy him. Which just made him even more irritated. The stupid git.</p>
<p>It was just Harry's luck that as soon as he stepped onto the train, he would nearly run right into the one person he was trying to avoid. His breath hitched in his throat, hesitating slightly. "Malfoy." He mumbled as a small greeting. He really didn't want to deal with the teasing already. He was hoping to have a peaceful ride to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"Potter. Late as always I see. Mind getting out of my way or do we all need to clear a path for the all mighty one?" Draco hissed as he crossed his arms.</p>
<p>"Like you're one to talk, you bloody prat." Harry spat back at him. There was no real rage behind his words though. He tried to move past the other boy, avoiding eye contact as best as he could in the small space.</p>
<p>"Oooh great come back" Draco smirked. "Real creative. Bet you spent <em>all</em> summer thinking about that one."</p>
<p>Harry clenched his jaw yet again, his eyes meeting Draco's as he reached out to grab a fist full of the other's shirt. He wasn't usually violent, but after the summer he had had, he really wasn't in the mood. "I really don't need your shit right now Malfoy. So I suggest you keep your mouth shut. You know <em>nothing</em> about me." He nearly growled out. He felt a hand on his shoulder, and knew it was Ron's, but he kept his eyes on Draco still.</p>
<p>Draco just rolled his eyes and grabbed Harry's wrist and pulled it off. "Your caretaker is here. Better move along." Draco then pushed past the two, shouldering Harry as he passed.</p>
<p>Harry blushed a bit at the comment, watching the blond walk away. He shook his head as he headed towards the room the three of them usually stayed in. At this point, he was annoyed. Both at Draco and himself. How could he have fallen for such a jerk like that?</p>
<p>Draco entered the next cart and turned to punch the wall. Fuck. “Why does he do this to me?” He questioned. Loosening his tie, he stormed back to his seat completely forgetting about the sweet treat he had originally set out for.</p>
<p>Harry was sat in his seat, silently staring out the window. That was how the first little while of the ride was spent, as if he was off in his own world. <br/> <br/> A thought hit him hard though, as he wondered if...he was actually in love with Draco. He suddenly felt as though he couldn't breathe, his heartbeat increasing in his chest. He stood up, making his way to the door as he gave he two an apologetic look. "I… need some fresh air." Was all he said, before he rushed to the back of the train.</p>
<p>About 10 minutes ago, Draco had been complaining to Pansy about the fact that Potter got on his nerves. She had rebutted with this crazy thought that the reason Draco got so angry around Harry was because he fancied him. Draco had been shell shocked and immediately denied it turning bright red at the same time. He immediately stormed out and found a mostly empty train cart and began sulking, scrunched down in a seat facing away from the door.</p>
<p>Harry made his way down the train halls, his own cheeks flushed bright red at the thought alone. He stopped when he, again, saw the blonde. He was alone, which surprised him most. No posse around him. He glanced around before making his way over to him. "Malfoy." He spoke up, making his presence known to the other.</p>
<p>Draco paused for a second before schooling his features into a glare. "What do want now Potter?" </p>
<p>"Why do you hate me so much?" Harry asked, genuine curiosity in his voice. "Is it really because I'm...'The Chosen One'? Because I honestly hate it." He admitted.</p>
<p>Draco's eyes creased in confusion. "Do you really not remember first year? You humiliated me in front of everyone. Since then I don’t know... You just make me so irritated!" he said voice getting a little louder as he spoke each word. He placed his elbows on the table in front of him, fisting his hair in frustration</p>
<p>Harry raised an eyebrow at the remark. "You really know how to hold a grudge." He commented, moving to sit in the open seat across from him. "I don't know who hates me more. You or Professor Snape." He added, glancing up at the other male hesitantly.</p>
<p>Draco hid a small laugh and rolled his eyes, crossing his arms and looking out the window. "Don't ask me why. I know it's stupid. You're just an annoying git."</p>
<p>"Wow. What a reason to hate someone." Harry replied, though a slight smile was on his own lips. He hoped Draco didn't see it. "I'm the annoying one? At least I don't have my father do everything for me." He stated.</p>
<p>"At least I have one." Draco immediately replied, then opened his eyes in shock. "Shit. Potter. See what I mean?!? I don't even mean to do it... It just comes out." He looked down at his lap, slightly ashamed, and fiddled with his ring.</p>
<p>Harry felt his heart drop at the comment, and it was like a hard slap to his face. "And here I was trying to be civil." He muttered out, standing up from his seat. "I feel sorry for you, Malfoy." He added, trying to hold back his tears as he headed back towards his room.</p>
<p>"No Potter wait!" Draco rushed out the words, as he stood up. "I'm.. Sorry" he mumbled looking down at the ground again.</p>
<p>Harry paused in his spot after he heard that, turning to look at him. A slight shocked expression was on his face. "Did you just...<em>apologize</em> to me Malfoy?" </p>
<p>"Hey. I can be a prat but I'm not <em>that </em>heartless. I said I didn't mean for it to come out... It's like a reflex when I'm around you." Draco said as he crossed his arms and tried to act nonchalant about it.</p>
<p>"You get that much enjoyment out of making my life a living hell?" Harry asked. "Good to know. Because I don't get enough of that from everyone else." He shook his head a bit, and continued on his way back to his room again.</p>
<p>Draco decided he didn’t want to fight anymore and let Harry go this time. He slinked back down in his seat and started mumbling to himself. "I don't get enjoyment out of it. I'd rather if I didn't get so riled up Potter. And if you are that annoyed with everyone else why don't you speak up for yourself." He let out a big sigh and stared out the window, lost in thought.</p>
