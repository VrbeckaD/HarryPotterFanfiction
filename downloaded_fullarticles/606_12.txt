  <em>This was dying, then? Didn’t seem so bad. The pain was even going better.</em>
</p><p align="justify">“No… <em>Imobilus</em>!”</p><p align="justify">Harry opened his eyes confused to see Tom had just used Harry’s wand on Fawkes. Harry glanced at the Phoenix immobile form and then to his own arm. His arm was healed. With a scar… but healed.</p><p align="justify">“Phoenix’s tears have healing powers.” Harry looked up at Tom, who pointed the wand at Harry and immobilized him as well. “You are immune to Basilisk’s poison now, but no matter. It’ll still give you a scar when used. A scar that cannot be healed.”</p><p align="justify">Harry would’ve frowned if he could’ve. As he was; he couldn’t even blink. Tom picked a flask and walked away, when he returned it had a whitish-like liquid inside. Tom smirked at Harry as he took Harry’s glasses away.</p><p align="justify">“People say that there are fates worse than death, Harry Potter. Let’s prove them right, shall we?”</p><p align="justify">And with that he emptied several drops into one eye and the same into the other. The liquid fogged Harry’s sight and, as it involved his whole eyes, he started seeing white. Finally, a water spell was used and yet Harry couldn’t see. <em>It was too bright. Too light. It hurt his eyes.</em></p><p align="justify">Harry felt the release of the <em>immobilus</em> spell and closed his eyes at once. He lowered his head and opened them slower, yet it was for nothing. The brightness wasn’t as bright but he couldn’t see. He was, completely and utterly, blind.</p><p align="justify">“That, Dear Harry, was for blinding and then killing the Basilisk.”</p><p align="justify">Harry refused to cry. He really did.</p><p align="justify">“I’ll have you pay for this, Tom!”</p><p align="justify">Tom laughed and a couple spells rolled around until finally a female body was by Harry’s side. Ginny slowly pulled a scarf around Harry’s eyes and helped him to stand. The two walking out the chamber with immobile Fawkes in Harry’s arms. Harry didn’t question what Tom did. So, he stayed quiet. They arrived Ron and Professor Lockhart. Ron pulled the bird unto Lockhart’s arms – <em>or something like that</em>, Harry supposed – before joining Ginny and, with one on each side, they helped Harry walk out the chambers.</p><p align="center">

</p><p align="justify">Harry felt a stick being set on his hand. He felt it for a while before he nodded at the one at his side.</p><p align="justify">“What are you doing?” He asked finally.</p><p align="justify">Harry might not be able to see, but he just knew that Tom had smirked.</p><p align="justify">“How so?”</p><p align="justify">“Why this… <em>façade</em>?”</p><p align="justify">“Because I can. And because every time I will be near you you’ll be reminded of your failure.”</p><p align="justify">A kiss was given to Harry’s forehead before the teen left the Infirmary wing. Harry was completely and utterly destroyed. Tom had won. The other could do whatever he wanted and yet he stayed near Harry in a way to throw in his face how he’d failed. Harry was grateful for the scarf right now or anyone would be able to see his tears.</p><p align="justify">
