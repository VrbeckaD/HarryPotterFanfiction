    <p>The night I met him, was the night my life began. And it all began with a slip of a tongue.</p><p>The trouble derived from clumsy beginnings: an innocent mistake. A muggle house, a muggle room. There I was, standing in silence at the bottom of the muggle stairs staring upwards towards her, my then-fiancee. Both our eyes sparkled and glistened in the chrome hue of the lamp-light, our hollow figures positioned limply as if reimagined in some faded dream. The fear which ran red through my veins had frozen my muscles and clenched my jaw. Trembling, we met gazes for the last time as she through her ring to the floor. I can't believe I forgot her birthday. And now, October 25th is forever branded on my mind.</p><p>I had been invited out to a ball, you see. A fancy one. A formal one. One which involved an evening of dancing and drinks. At a manor on a hill. I offered to take her both before and after I'd realised my mistake. In fact, I insisted and begged her, promising I'd make it up to her. And I know I should've stayed. And yet I have the guts to miss her. With all my sorry heart.</p><p>Mortified, I wrapped up in a trench coat hurried out the door, my heels clapping against the pavement and guiding me into the distance. The wind bit at my fingertips and clawed at my cheeks as if it was my conscience, or karma, or she. A distant beat and jovial scream caught itself in my dress as I tugged at the hood to mask my face and smother my expression. Still, I clambered on, trekking up to the beacon on the hill.</p><p>Soon enough, I was greeted by an imposing structure staring me down. Was this a trick? A trap? Was I even wanted here? Should I go? My gut was doing back-flips and my heart was running wild; there was something electric about this place. The buzzing inside yearned for me. Defiantly, I swallowed my pride, slipped off my cloak and clambered on inside.</p><p>It was as if I had slipped into a pool and was swimming in culture and bathing in light. A bath of aromas on my right, pirouetting from the buffet, spiralling from the bouquets. Champagnes and roses. Cheesecakes and chestnuts. Chocolates and strawberries: they had it all. Roars of chatter littered in circles flooded the floors of the ball. Whole spectrums of light dappled the ceiling, defacing it with shapes and spirals and sprinkles of dreams. Women draped in spooling frills and fabrics manned the evening, plastered in bright-red lip stains and eyeliner designed to kill, smothered in skincare and topped off with masks erupting with faux flowers and fishnet sheets. They stared each other down with expressions of green, grasping at the waistcoats of men who took their fancy, leaning in only to whisper sweet obscenities down their ear canals. And it seemed, I was underdressed. Hideously underdressed. If looks could kill, I'd kill myself. I'd probably die of embarrassment.</p><p>The likelihood of catching someone's eye was slim. This farce was designed for bragging, after all! Or, at least, that's what they wanted me to think. So I told myself, (Y/N), if you have the nerve to turn up to a modern-day masquerade looking like a scullery maid in comparison, you're damn well gonna embrace it. And so laziness, I rocked up to the bar. And glided along it. Well, actually. I fell, okay. I fell. Awkwardly, I hauled myself up to the counter where I found myself head-down, half-asleep, half an hour later. Naturally, there were two gentlemen sharing a conversation next to me. So I decided that I'd stay face-down for the sake of my eyes and hope whatever tea-spilling they were up to would scorch me into the warm embrace of death.</p><p>"I am astonished Dumbledore sent me out here - of all people - to help you with this, Scamander. However," a voice like velvet continued, "should you not find a suitable muggle I will be more than delighted or perhaps even inclined to fake a tragedy to cover you"</p><p>"Why are you placing the responsibility to find one solely on me?" the blonde mess of a boy replied.</p><p>"You'll find me on the balcony, should you run into trouble"</p><p>"But, Sir!". And the familiar voice vanished. We were alone. Sheepishly, I lifted my head, tilting my gaze to get a better look at this guy. Maybe I'd woken up at a Harry Potter convention? Maybe I was dreaming? Maybe I'd misheard but I was certain I knew that name and those voices from somewhere. This couldn't be a coincidence, surely? Maybe a sick joke? An inside joke I'd never understand?</p><p>The blonde boy turned on his heel to walk away but instead ended up colliding with my torso. Ouch.</p><p>"I know a muggle" I blurted out.</p><p>"Yeah...there are hundreds here. I just need one who has (Y/C) hair and a blue dre-. Wait. You heard our conversation, didn't you?"</p><p>"What ya gonna do? Obliviate me? Pa-lease"</p><p>"H-How do you? Are you a witch too?". Chuckling heartily, I tried my best for composure to avoid the guy any future shame, but it was hard to come.</p><p>"Alas, no. Although it would be more convenient than muggledom, I guess"</p><p>"Oh, um, er, you have...wait," Scamander rifled through his suit pocket and pulled out a tattered paperback emblazoned with the title 'A GUIDE TO MUGGLE FLIRTING'. My eyebrow raised so quickly that it was as if it was trying to fling itself off my forehead. The poor young man sheepishly extended his hand and began reciting a few expressions from his phrase book.</p><p>"W-would you care to join me for a dance?" he beamed. His subsequent smile was like the midday Sun, with innocence gleaming from every crevice, refracting from every angle. I guess I well and truly had to embrace my scruffiness now! And so with a pride as ripe as day, I placed my hand in his and lead him to the dance floor.</p><p>The closer to the middle we got, the more anxious the young man appeared. It was clear that he was far out of his depth. In all fairness, so was I.</p><p>"If you don't want to, that's fine you know. I'll stick with ya, either way, if you want, I guess". Bashfully, I snuck a thread of hair back behind my ear, catching a glimpse at my boots which stuck out like a sore thumb in a place this extravagant and regal. Scamander placed a gentle hand on my waist as he so amiably sighed.</p><p>"I've done this before. It's alright. I-I think I know you from somewhere" he paused, gazing inquisitively into the distance, "Yes, I know you. You're (Y/N), right? Yes, you're the right mug- I mean. Yes, this is...brilliant". Slightly taken-a-back but willing to do anything at this point to run away from my problems, I rested my hand on his shoulder in response.</p><p>"Okay, I guess. Take it away then, Mr Darcy"</p><p>"Who's Mr Darcy?"</p><p>"A guy". We spent the remainder of the night moving as one to the sounds of an orchestra, losing ourselves in conversation about casting spells n shit whilst unintentionally captivating the room with the unlikeliness of the pairing. I looked like I'd just fallen down a rabbit hole whereas he looked like a strange mix of Eddie Redmayne and an actual Mr Darc-oh.</p><p>"We've spent the entire evening raving to Mozart and yet I haven't asked you your name"</p><p>"Oh-I'm Rolf. Rolf Scamander" he nodded, "and you (Y/F/N) will come to know me better in time"</p><p>"You're Newt's grandson aren't you? And why do you say with such sad eyes?". There was a clear prescience in his tone which echoed down his throat, causing him to swallow to bury it at the depths of his stomach - where it looked like it hurt the most.</p><p>"C-Can you follow me, a minute?" he stuttered to the death of our rhythm.</p><p>"S-Sure". Smash. A million shards of glass scattered and scraped across the floor's veneer and laid like a lifeless pattern, like a macabre disco ball reflecting the face of fear above the sycophantic crowd onto the terror in their own. A chaotic, violent, aggressive and ruthlessly destructive ball of shadow had swung its body through the window and into the arms of the bartenders, unleashing gallons of alcoholic flood water upon the horrified crowd, forming what seemed like an eighth sea. Two pure white eyes glowing from the centre of the mass met my own.</p><p>"That's an obscuria-". Rolf clasped his hand around mine and tugged at it.</p><p>"RUN!". Throwing caution to the wind we bolted to door at the side of the stage as the thunderous beast threw stools in the air and split counters in two, snapping the necks and clawing at the faces of the party itself. Hand in hand we leapt down a staircase and crashed like an almighty explosion through a fire exit, pegging it out of the building before death could grab any of us by the ankles. Onlookers from the balcony shrieked out their lungs as they acknowledged the two of us racing into the adjacent forest. Everyone except a dark figure who watched on, entranced, with his robes and locks alike waving majestically in the midnight breeze.</p><p>Ardently, we hurried down and off the path, desperate not to be traced. My heart was hammering traitorously against my ribcage, my feet I could no longer feel. My ankles I knew would be screwed from running in wedges. Nothing a good ol' episkey can't fix though, eh?</p><p>Rolf stammered forward and managed to wedge his foot in the undertow, the force of which slammed him into the solid ground, causing his wand to fly from out of his grip. Not a sound escaped the poor boy's lips.</p><p>I wanted to scream. I wanted to shriek at the beast which had caused this merciless chain of events. I wanted to tear that ball of self-hatred apart molecule by molecule with my own bare hands before scorching it in the flames of hell. I wanted to kill it. Yet I wanted to run. I snatched the wand in the hopes that maybe a fleck of magic would erupt from within and shield me from the monster. But as I got back to my feet those two eyes of soul-crushing pearl white gleamed through the shadows, separating themselves like oil from water, and hurled themselves my way. I was a goner for sure. But like the slit of a Peverell's throat in the night, a lone cape found its way to us in the nick of time, snatching our figures from the night and vanishing without a trace.</p><p>And that was the night I met him. And it all ended with a run and a trip.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
