    <p>Draco scraped his daggers across a patch of scraggy moss on the cave wall, sharp eyes catching the barely-visible sparks cast by his blades, tasting the ash in the air. The whole planet smelt sulphurous, poisonous, dusty and spoiled. The blood of the dragon-like creature he’d slaughtered at the entrance to the cave had a peculiar purple tint to it – which seemed wrong, as most creatures from the fiery pits of Muspelheim had black blood, or navy. Sweat dripped down his back under the thick protection of his dragonhide fighting leathers. He’d have to remember to skin the creature outside, or summon some soldiers to do so quickly before the hide stiffened beyond use. It would bring him a fortune when he sold the treated hides, if he made it home. </p><p>He wrapped the recording-stone in his palm, whispering the activation spell, watching and listening for movement in the shadows, sharp dragonish ears pricked, flickering in a most inhuman way. Were his mother to see him now, he doubted she’d recognise him through the black well-worn leather, dragon’s eyes and ears, close-shorn hair rubbed through with ashes. Perhaps his tattoos would carry a hint; the wolf and stars on his shoulder matched his mother and Remus’.<br/>
Perhaps they’d be put off by the scarring, or the glowing blue pin-prick marks from a bite from a sabretoothed lyre-eel – oh, a long time ago now, back before the Queen allowed him loose as a warrior. Low on his hip sat a sword in a stone, King Arthur’s sword, water pooled at its base. Rubbing his finger over it, Draco spoke his mission report into the stone, remembering his mother’s face when he came home with a dressing peeking over the waistband of his shorts. She’d been so furious. </p><p>His wand buzzed out a warning against his forearm. A slight flick of the wrist dropped it down into his hand, ready to attack or defend. </p><p>“You’re flighty,” came a voice, rasped, ancient. </p><p>“Ancient One,” he greeted cautiously, alarmed by the sudden arrival of the presence, “I came with a request.”</p><p>The rocks rumbled. “Speak.”</p><p>“My family has been torn. I am searching for a way to break the curses ruling my brothers and sister,” he said boldly. The Ancient would be able to talk circles around him; best not give it the chance. </p><p>“And you believe me to be of aid? You can barely withstand the heat of the cave you occupy, let alone the cave you must brave for the answers you seek.”</p><p>Draco gripped the hilt of his sword, silently casting a bright illumination spell. Nothing was revealed. He could have sworn the Ancient One dwelling in the molten heart of the planet laughed at him.</p><p>“I will make you a deal,” said the deity, “If you can bear the heat, as you are now, with no added spellwork, I will help you.”</p><p>“I will do it,” swore Draco, to himself and the Ancient One. It laughed again. “I will. I have no choice.”</p><p>Pebbles tumbled as the ground shook. </p><p>“We always have a choice, young one.”</p><p>“Is that a threat?”</p><p>“Does it need to be?”</p>
