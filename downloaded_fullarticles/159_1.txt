</p><p>This is English</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>November 28th, 2000, Number 4 Private Drive Surrey </p><p>An aged man stood silently in a dark house. A young baby lay cradled in his arms, the baby shifted uncomfortably but did not cry.</p><p>“<u>What a well behaved child.</u>” The man murmured in soft Arabic. He eyed the nasty diaper rash, and the overfilled diaper distastefully as he walked away from the previously locked cupboard. A man dressed entirely in black materialized from the shadows. The man was overloaded with caretaking supplies for children aged twelve to eighteen months old. The masked ninja laid out the supplies and carefully unloaded a changing mat on the sterile kitchen table. The man gently placed the child on the mat and stepped back to allow a ninja to change the diaper and begin treating the rash. With the child being cared for, the man found three more ninjas appearing in front of him, kneeling respectfully.</p><p>“<u>The Dursleys will remain alive. They may be useful to the young Potter as she grows into her inheritance.</u>” The man declared</p><p>“<u>We will leave as soon as the child is fit for transport. You have confirmed that this abode holds none of her personal belongings?</u>” The man questioned. The group answered with an affirmative nod and vanished. </p><p>While he waited for the child to be prepared, the aged man pulled out a note, re-reading it despite himself.</p><p><br/>
<em>To Lord Ra’s Al Ghul</em>
</p><p>
  <em>May this letter find you well,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I do not know if you know who I am or remember my grandfather, but I was told to go to you for help should my family ever be in mortal danger. My name is James Potter, the grandson of Harison Potter. I was told by my father who was told by his father that you owe my family a life debt. I do not wish to force you to help if you are unwilling or unable, but I am desperate. My wife and I have gone into hiding with our young child. A homicidal dark lord is after my life and the life of my entire family. We have every protection available in place, but I fear it will not be enough. I do not know if your debt still holds, but should you protect my child, I, James Fleamont Potter, head of the Potter family, do swear on my magic that you, Ra’s Al Ghul will have fulfilled your life debt to the Potter family.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We are currently hidden under magical protections and for the safety of my family, I cannot divulge our location to you. I was told by my father that you are a man of powerful connections. If you receive this, please help us. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sincerely, </em><br/>
<em>Lord James Potter</em>
</p><p>Ra’s felt a tug at his chest when he glanced at the child. James Potter may have thought that he was offering Ra’s a way to fulfill the life debt he incurred more than two centuries ago, but in reality, the Potter lord had created an ultimatum. Now that the child is the sole surviving Potter, and James Potter created this magical oath, Ra’s was in danger of serious magical consequences should he allow the child to die. While he did not have a magical core like the Potter’s subspecies of humans, the effects of the Lazarus pit had given him a magical signature. Ra’s did not intend to discover what magical backlash he would face should this child die. </p><p>Ra’s carefully tucked the letter away and turned toward the kitchen just as a ninja appeared with the child. The baby girl had a fresh diaper, treated rashes, been wrapped in a silken blanket, and fallen asleep. Ra’s accepted the child and inspected the wound on her forehead. </p><p>“<u>Summon a shaman to examine this wound. This is magical in nature, that I am sure of.</u>” Ra’s ordered calmly and turned toward the door. As he moved, he paused to glance at the petrified couple in the living room. The couple was on their knees with knives pressed against their jugulars. </p><p>“<u>Should either of you speak of this to anyone, you will find your lives cut short. Remember this well, Dumbledore may give threats, but I am a man who gives only promises.</u>” With that, he exited private drive number four and vanished into the night.</p><p>. . .</p><p>December 1st, 2000 League of Assassins Compound</p><p>“<u>What is this?</u>” Talia Al Ghul hissed in outrage. Her eyes burned as she took in the sight of the young child in her father’s arms. </p><p>“<u>Her name is Harriet and you are to train her alongside young Damian.</u>” Ra’s ordered calmly.</p><p>“<u>What of her parents?</u>” Talia asked, eyeing the child suspiciously.</p><p>“<u>Her lineage will be of no consequence for several years yet. I expect her to be trained appropriately when the time comes that she is ready to claim her inheritance. I expect her to be raised with the same . . . discretion that you are taking to conceal young Damian’s existence.</u>” Ra’s explained as he assigned Talia her task. His daughter may be suspicious of her task, but Ra’s had full faith that she would complete her duties without fail. Talia knew full well the consequences of disobedience. He passed off the young Potter heiress to Talia. The child had watched the entire exchange silently, with wide curious green eyes. Despite the tuff of bright red hair, he could see Talia studying the child’s green eyes and coming to her own conclusions. Her suspicions were not his concern. She would do her job, and should she perform accordingly, Ra’s may choose to disabuse her of the suspicion that she had a sister.</p><p>… </p><p>March 21st, 2005 Deep in a Mountain Pass</p><p>Harriet glared at the cliff face ahead of her with all the malice her small form could contain. She glanced back. Damian was seated, decked out in the same winter weather gear as her. He had removed his backpack and was taking a long drink from his insulated thermos. </p><p>“<u>We should keep moving. If we take too long to make it to the top, Talia will be displeased with us.</u>” Harriet stated blandly. Damian glared at her.</p><p>“<u>Feel free to move ahead, your impatience will be your death. Then mother will be very pleased.</u>” Harriet scowled as he spoke, and rolled her eyes, it was a shame that he couldn’t see it under her goggles. She unraveled her climbing gear and began preparing to scale the sheer cliff. The job was made more difficult with the heavy gloves that limited her dexterity and fine motion skills even further. </p><p>“<u>You are tying that knot incorrectly, it will come loose if you fall.</u>” Damian commented as he began securing his climbing equipment as well. Harriet raised an eyebrow. Damian may not be able to see the gesture but he could certainly sense that she was doing it. </p><p>“<u>My knots are fine, you, however, need to change that knot, or it will fail.</u>” Harriet knew that Damian had been distracted during this lesson. His wretch of a mother had gone off to visit his mysterious father, and she never came back in a normal mood. Talia would either be in the best mood Harriet had ever seen her have, or the worst. There was no middle ground. Both of them were wondering if they would go through nasty hell training (like scaling this mountain) so that Talia could remind herself of Damian’s genetic potential, go on a rather fun pickpocket/blend in with a crowd training that Talia only gifted them with when she was in a great mood, or they might be put through seduction training. Never mind that Damian was four and she was five. Those were the only outcomes of her interaction with Damian’s father. </p><p>“<u>My knots are unequivocal. Especially in comparison to yours.</u>” Damian replied bitingly.</p><p>“<u>If you fall, you can’t say that I didn’t warn you.</u>” Harriet replied with a shrug. They were both ready, so without another word, they began their ascent. They made it about half-way up the cliff face before a particularly strong gust of wind knocked both of them free from the wall. Harriet was entirely unsurprised to see her knot hold, allowing her so get thrown free, before swinging back to the relative safety of the wall. Harriet was also entirely unsurprised to see Damian’s knot unravel as he was thrown free of the wall. Oh well, a fall could certainly do his ego some good. Harriet watched his descent dispassionately for a moment, before realizing that his trajectory was taking directly toward the one patch of stone in the ravine of snow. Feeling her heart leap into her throat, she useless screamed a warning, a single hand leaving the wall in a belated desperate move. Sure, she had seen people die, but this was different. </p><p>Having already begun to master meditation, she knew what her center was supposed to feel like. In her heart-stopping panic, she almost missed something tug within her. In the last moment before his delicate face connected with the stone, Damian came to an abrupt stop. All momentum was extinguished and he hovered in the air for a moment before plopping onto the stone without any strength. If there had been any question that Harriet was responsible, the sudden exhaustion that sapped through her confirmed it. She stared at her extended palm incredulously, and then returned to the mission at hand. She was closer to the bottom than the top, and her energy was mostly gone. Following that logic, Harriet repelled back down rather than finishing the climb. She sat in an exhausted heap, back leaning against the cliff face, and watched Damian slowly pick himself up and make his way over to where she was sitting. He examined her slumped form, and then plopped down next to her.</p><p>“<u>Are you meta?</u>” Damian asked quietly, his tone gave away nothing.</p><p>“<u>I have no clue. Grandmaster has told me as much about my heritage, as he has told Talia.</u>” Harriet replied, unsure why she was being so honest him. They sat there in silence for a long time. Both recovering from their ordeals. Finally, Damian spoke.</p><p>“<u>You have done me a service today Harriet, that fall would not have been pleasant. When the time comes that we are pitted against each other, I will remember this and spare your life.</u>” Damian stated graciously, and Harriet felt a familiar spark of white-hot rage bloom in her that she normally associated with Damian opening his mouth. </p><p>“<u>That won’t be necessary, I have always been your superior in skill, the only thing that changes now is that we are both aware I am genetically superior as well.</u>” Harriet retorted.</p><p>“<u>My parents are not meta, but mother has told me that my father defeated Superman. I clearly do not need any meta abilities to outclass you.</u>” Damian replied heatedly. </p><p>“<u>Right, well how about a bet then, I will beat you to the top of this mountain, and you will admit that I am superior to both you, and your breeding.</u>” Harriet offered grandiosely. </p><p>“<u>Fine, when I win, you will admit that I am the product of far greater breeding that does not require any meta abilities to defeat you and any other meta.</u>” Damian decided. </p><p>“<u>We have an accord. But Damian? I have one suggestion before we return to climbing.</u>” Harriet requested, coming to a decision that would change the course of their relationship thus far. </p><p>“<u>And what, pray tell, is your request?</u>” Damian replied suspiciously.</p><p>“<u>Let me show you how to tie a proper knot.</u>” Harriet said with a smirk, that caused a delightful scowl to appear on Damian’s face.</p><p>. . .</p><p>April 2nd, 2005 League of Assassins Compound</p><p>Harriet sank down to a knee as Ra’s Al Ghul entered the audience chamber she was waiting in. Beside him walked Talia. Joy.</p><p>“<u>My daughter tells me that you discovered a new part of yourself on your most recent training expedition.</u>” Ra’s stated without preamble. Harriet freaking knew it. Talia was totally watching their entire hike through that blasted mountain. She was behaving in an oddly cordial toward her ever since she beat Damian to the top of the mountain. The little cheater had demanded best two out of three before he would admit defeat but that was fine with Harriet, she was 1-0 and nothing Damian could do would best her. </p><p>“<u>Yes, grandmaster.</u>” Was all Harriet replied, in her most respectful tone. </p><p>“<u>I am sure you have many questions for me about your heritage. Because you have been performing adequately in your recent training, I have decided that you have earned some information. You come from a small community of inborn magic users located in Western Europe. Your birth parents entrusted you to my tutelage before passing away. As your natural magics have begun to manifest, I have prepared a tutor for you to meet with monthly. Talia will ensure that you are able to attend these. The tutor will teach you to control your gifts and educate you in the history and versatility on the magics of both Europe and the world at large. I expect your studies to reflect the same standards that you meet with your tutors within the compound.</u>” Ra’s explained succinctly. </p><p>“<u>Thank you, grandmaster, you honor me</u>” Harriet replied, trying to maintain the same dignity and presence that Ra’s Al Ghul exuded. Despite Talia’s mask of indifference, Harriet was pretty sure that this was the first tidbit of information on her identity that was given. The thought made Harriet only moderately smug. </p><p>“<u>You are dismissed.</u>” Ra’s stated cooly, and Harry bowed once more, before making her exit. She had a rematch with Damian awaiting her this afternoon, and she intended to win. </p><p>. . .</p><p>August 30th, 2006 League of Assassins Compound</p><p>Damian let out and angry curse as he fell from the balance beam, Harriet glanced down to the floor below her and smirked. She was upside down, perfectly balanced on one hand. In slow, calculated movements, she let her weight slip backward until her bare feet came in contact with the beam behind her. Moving into a standing position from the one-handed crab pose was child’s play after that. With a smug saunter, she walked the beam until she was above where he had fallen, and then silently dropped to the floor beside him.</p><p>“<u>That makes 132-131. I have superior balance <em>and</em> genetics.</u>” Harriet spoke with a grin as she examined his wrist from where he was clutching it in pain. Damian gave her a scathing look, and Harriet frowned.</p><p>“<u>Let me see it. The new tutor for my serpent tongue magics demanded I practice every chance I get.</u>” Harriet demanded simply, extending her hand. Damian gave her a suspicious look before offering his wrist to her. She pulled out a necklace that had been under her loose-fitting jacket. She and Damian were old enough to wear the normal ninja training outfits, even if theirs were several sizes smaller than anyone else in the compound. The necklace had several bones of snakes, serpents, and previous serpent tongue mages. The bones were dipped in various fluids, dried and strung on a length of leather cord made from the skin of a basilisk. She was sure that the piece cost Ra’s a small fortune, but it was an amazing focus, and Ra’s had presented it as a reward for her rapid improvements in so many different areas of magic simultaneously. She focused on Damain’s wrist, letting magic gently feel out the sprain, before concentrating on her spell and murmuring;</p><p>“<u><em>~</em>Mend<em>~</em></u>” If there was one thing that Harriet had learned, it was that words held power. In the serpent tongue language, it was especially so. She felt a familiar power course through the necklace and appear in a dim glow that encased Damian’s wrist for a soft moment, before vanishing and hopefully taking Damian’s pain with it. Damian flexed it experimentally, his face showed no pain. </p><p>“<u>Your skill grows with every day, Harriet.</u>” He murmured appreciatively. Harriet grinned and flipped her hair flamboyantly. </p><p>“<u>Of course they do, if only you could keep up, then I might find some challenge in the monotonous day to day extracurriculars.</u>” Harriet grinned as Damian stilled for a moment. They locked eyes in challenge, and Damian bared his teeth in a vicious grin. </p><p>“<u>Oh really, I seem to remember you losing to me yesterday in our spar. Surely that provided at least some escape from tiresome continuity.</u>” He retorted</p><p>“<u>Please, that was a one-time occurrence, it will not happen again.</u>” Harriet retorted, her muscles tensing as she prepared for the fight that was about to break out.</p><p>“<u>Oh, I can guarantee that history will repeat itself.</u>” Damian replied and they began to circle each other with predatory intent. Harriet opened her mouth to make a taunt that would set off the impending brawl when a servant entered the room warily.</p><p>“<u>Young lord and lady, the Lady Talia requests both of your presences immediately.</u>” The servant declared respectfully, before bowing once, and leaving. </p><p>The two eyed each other once more before Harriet shrugged, and all aggression vanished from their posture. They slipped on their shoes, gloves, and heavier jackets, all of which had come off during their balance contest. They slipped on their face masks and completed their ensembles with cowls. The two looked like fairly identical androgynous mini-ninjas with nothing but their green eyes visible to give away their identities. </p><p>Arriving in the meeting room where Talia was waiting, the two nodded respectfully to her and waited for Talia to speak first.</p><p>“<u>It is time for you both to take your first step down the path to become strong.</u>” Talia announced solemnly handing the two six-year-olds an identical scroll. She watched carefully for any hesitation as they read through their first mission. It was a simple assassination, she would have people watching their every move, on standby in case the mission became more than they could handle. Talia personally would have preferred something a little more hands-off for their first mission, but she knew that her son could handle this. The two had butchered their own food plenty of times now. While neither had taken a human life yet, both had been acclimated to the death of dinner animals and had borne witness to several executions, exterminations, and interrogations throughout the years. Neither would even hesitate, Talia was sure of it. It was her who had trained them after all. </p><p>“<u>It will be done, mother</u>.” </p><p><br/>
. . . </p><p>September 3rd, 2006 Russia</p><p>“<u><strong>Sir!</strong></u>” a tiny voice called out in Russian.</p><p>A large man stopped as was about to enter a local bar he enjoyed frequenting. A little girl with bright red hair waving about her, dressed in scraps came running up to him with a look of terrified desperation. </p><p>“<u><strong>Sir it’s my brother! He won’t get up! Please help!</strong></u>” The girl pleaded, grabbing his pant leg desperately. The man nearly slapped her away in disgust before pausing. In these temperatures, if her brother was dressed anything like her, he likely was no longer alive. They must be new to the streets if they tried to sleep outside, and came to strangers for help in this part of town. Barely withholding a smile, he tried to give her a semi-concerned look.</p><p>“<u><strong>Where is he?</strong></u>” He asked, the girl nearly started sobbing in relief.</p><p>“<u><strong>Oh thank you, sir! He is just in the alley behind this place, I thought no one would help him!</strong></u>” She hugged his leg slightly before tugging him in the direction of the alley. What a stupid child. Ah well, easy pickings never lasted long anyway, the man thought, allowing a malicious smile onto his face and the girl charged on ahead to where a young boy lay unconscious in the trash. He crouched down to check his pulse and was more than a little surprised to find that the boy was still alive. How . . . fortunate. He turned to the girl, intent on informing her of this when the near corpse moved. That distracted him long enough to miss the little redhead slip behind him with a small predatory grin of her own. The boy had already moved, plunging a dagger into his stomach. Staring down in shock and pain, he never even saw the girl launch herself up at his neck with a dagger of her own. Before he could comprehend what happened, the life had left his eyes. </p><p>“<u>Harriet! Why would you do that? I had him, and now because of you I’m disgusting.</u>” Damian hissed in outrage, looking disgustedly at the blood congealing on his disguise. Blood that had come from the far more messy neck wound.</p><p>“<u>Simple, Talia told me that if anyone ever looked at me the way he did, I should stab them in the throat before they try anything.</u>” Harriet replied unrepentantly.</p><p>“<u>But he was already about to die!</u>” Damian protested</p><p>“<u>Well, it certainly made me feel better.</u>” Harriet argued.</p><p>“<u>It was not part of our plan</u>.” Damian grumbled, realizing he wasn’t going to win.</p><p>“<u>Correction, it wasn’t part of your plan, how about this, if you want your plan to go off without a hitch then you play the honeypot role and I lay around and do nothing next time.</u>” Harriet replied crossing her arms petulantly as she pulled out a smartphone from under her pauper rags and took a picture of the corpse before sending it off to Talia, not that she wasn’t fully convinced Talia was watching their every move like a mother tigress waiting to swoop in on anything threatening her little cub learning to hunt. The two moved quickly as they bickered, disposed of the clothes and weapons into a sealed bag, transformed into two entirely different children with some preplanned disguises, and headed back into town to rendezvous at the pickup point. </p><p>As they moved, Harriet made an awkward face.</p><p>“<u>So, . . . do you feel any different?</u>” Harriet asked him quietly.</p><p>“<u>Why would I?</u>” Damian asked defensively.</p><p>“<u>Well, we killed someone today. He was scum, but we still killed him.</u>” Harriet asked slowly. Damian frowned.</p><p>“<u>It is what is expected of us, why? Do you feel different?</u>” He asked. Harriet looked around slowly, trying to pinpoint where all their watchers were, before turning her head so that her lips couldn’t be read, and murmured softly.</p><p>“<u>Well, your plan made it that only you would have to kill today.”</u> Damian gave her a hard look and turned his head so his lips couldn’t be read either.</p><p>“<u>Mother would not have sent us on another mission for some time, you could have spared yourself for at least a short time yet. Why did you do that?</u>” Damian asked with a strange look. Harriet breathed out hard, before collecting her thoughts.</p><p>“<u>Damian. You are the only person who I interact with on an equal level. I consider you an important ally. We work well together, I will not let you complete any training without me participating equally. I will not allow you to become a full-fledged member of the league without me. We- We are in this together.</u>” Harriet felt a slight heat enter her cheeks, aware of how much feeling she admitting to Damian, who could easily use this against her. Damian stared at her for a long moment.</p><p>“<u>I- Thank you Harriet.</u>” Damian spoke quietly and the two spent the rest of the journey in silence, having exhausted the amount of feelings either were willing to expose.</p><p>. . . </p><p>July 4th, 2008 New York</p><p>Damian and Harriet sat on the roof of a skyscraper, watching fireworks explode in the distance.</p><p>“Happy now? We’ve seen the fireworks. Can we get on with the mission?” Damian asked shortly, practicing his American accent.</p><p>“Of course not, I’ve heard that the end is the best part.” Harriet replied in a crisp British accent, much to Damian’s chagrin hers sounded much more convincing than his. Damian sighed and looked her over. She was dressed in superman tee and had a skirt that was just long enough to conceal the daggers strapped to her thighs. He was dressed in jeans and a batman tee. They were practicing their undercover prowess, and Damian was more than a little displeased that his katana could not be concealed like her daggers. He felt naked with only the knives in his shoes and the shuriken in his pockets. Harriet made an excited noise as the finale began, she pulled out the phone from Damian’s pocket that was definitely supposed to be used for mission-related purposes only and pulled him closer, angling them for a selfie with the fireworks in the background. Harriet gave the camera a full toothed grin and, at Harriet’s pointed elbow, he gave the camera a small smile. Harriet snapped the photo twice and separated from him. He watched with a raised eyebrow as she emailed to photo somewhere and wiped all evidence of either the photo or email’s existence from the phone. </p><p>“That is such a frivolous and pointless risk. Mother is going to put both of us through hell and destroy all of your photos when she discovers that you are leaving an electronic trail behind us.” He pointed out for what must have been the hundredth time. </p><p>“Nonsense, Talia definitely likes me better than you. And as long as no one else finds out, she would totally let me keep them. I bet it kills her that she has no adorable baby pictures of you. Actually, I bet she totally does. Hidden away somewhere like me.” Harriet insisted and returned the phone to Damain’s pocket.</p><p>“Are we even talking about the same woman?” Damian asked confusedly.</p><p>“Of course we are, me and Talia have <em>bonded</em>. I’m basically the daughter that she secretly wishes she had.” Harriet replied with a wave of her hand.</p><p>“Talia and I.” Damian corrected with a smirk and Harriet made a face damn. She had gotten careless, they currently had an English superiority contest going on that she just lost. That made it 361-363. Damian was pulling ahead and Harriet was having none of it. The fireworks finale barely helped the sulk that Harriet was falling into. As it ended, the two stood wordlessly in perfect sync and slipped through the roof hatch into the penthouse apartment. They ignored the shattered glass, bullet holes, and blood trail to the bedroom. Damian sent out a mission complete message to the pickup team, and the two began making their way back to where a helicopter awaited them. </p><p>. . .</p><p>June 1st, 2010 League of Assassins Compound</p><p>Damian scowled fiercely, watching Harriet pack all of her belongings into a small bag.</p><p>“I should go with you.” Damian spoke grumpily, Harriet snorted.</p><p>“Damian I will be attending a school for witches and wizards soon. You do not have inborn magic. This will be the beginning of my quest to claim my inheritance and avenge my progenitors. Do not misunderstand, I expect you and Talia to visit in the coming months before I enter the school, but I must appear to be living with the blood relations in Europe when the magical society comes to collect me.” Harriet’s voice was incredibly fond up until she spoke of her relatives. Damian understood this perfectly. They had scoped the family out less than a year ago after his Grandfather had given Harriet a full accounting of her family history. He tried not to be outwardly upset about that. Damian still had not even earned his Father’s name, yet Harriet had been given an endless stream of information about her origins. Damian understood how hard it was not to know and could see how much better Mother had treated Harriet after she realized that they were not related. It was for the best that Harriet knew, even if that meant Mother had not-so-subtly started grooming Harriet to be his consort. </p><p>“The compound will be different without you here.” Damian stated flatly.</p><p>“And everything will different without you with me.” Harriet replied equally flat. They stared for a moment longer before a servant entered her room.</p><p>“<u>Young Lady, Lady Talia requests that you make your way to the helicopter.</u>” Harriet nodded regally.</p><p>“<u>Yes, I will present myself momentarily.</u>” She dismissed the servant and turned back to Damian, they clasped wrists firmly and looked each other in the eye.</p><p>“<u>May your enemies fall before you.</u>” Harriet stated solemnly.</p><p>“<u>And yours quake before your might.</u>” Damian replied. They nodded once and released each other.</p><p>Harriet grabbed her bag and walked out. Damian slipped out the window and settled onto the roof of the main building. He watched from a distance as Harriet’s small figure exchanged words with his Mother, before boarding the helicopter. He watched as Talia stepped away from the helicopter. He watched as it rose into the air and flew away, taking its sole passenger far from him. He watched until the Helicopter vanished beyond the mountains protecting their compound. He watched for several minutes after the helicopter was out of sight. Damian took a deep breath to ground himself and reign in his feeling on Harriet’s departure from his life. Then, Damian rose and began went to begin his training for the day. Alone for the first time in as long as he could remember. </p><p>. . . </p><p>July 31st, 2010, Number 4 Private Drive Surrey </p><p>“Yer a wizard Harry.”</p>
