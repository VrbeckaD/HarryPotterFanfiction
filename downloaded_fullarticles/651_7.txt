    <p>Hi.. my name is scarlet von darkheart destructuin rosethron raven way the third. I am a member of the avengers and I am half demon half angel, part god and vampire and I have the powers of infinity stones like captain marvel but all of them cos im better than her <br/>When I was a kid I was kicked out of agsrad for being 2 poweerful so I went to tony stark and he told me I could join his avengers and ive been there evr since. I was the firs  one there besides stark bc he created it. He ws a prep at first but then he became goth because I showed him how cool it is. We like to listen to mcf together we go to mcr concerts when were not busy building new tech. <br/>Tony came to me today he said “Scarlet this is bad news thanos is coming”<br/>“thanos?!” I gasped.</p>
