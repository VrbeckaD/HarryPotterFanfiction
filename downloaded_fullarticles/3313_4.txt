    <p>I know I should be asleep but the truth is I am so scared right now. Because I know that Remus saw the cuts and I know that he is going to ask me about them in the morning. The only reason he didn't ask last night was because I quickly went to bed. I can't tell whether he's going to be sad, mad or just disappointed. I just hope it's not disappointed, because I don't think I could bare that.</p>
<p>It's around four when I finally drift off to sleep and I wake up at seven to the smell of bacon and eggs. I find a hoodie and pull it on, trying to cover myself as possible. I give one last glance in the mirror before leaving my room and descending the stairs. I can partly see Remus and I can already tell that he's troubled. I quietly walk into the kitchen and sit down.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Harry. How are you feeling?" Remus says cheerfully, though I can tell that it's forced.</p>
<p>"I'm good…" I mutter.</p>
<p>"Great, that's wonderful… Are you sure? Did you get any sleep last night Harry?" He says, more weary this time.</p>
<p>I just give him a smile as he sets a plate down in front of me and I focus on the meal, trying get as much pleasure from the taste as I can though everything tastes so bitter.</p>
<p>When we both are finished and our plates are rinsed and put away he sits me down in the lounge and starts talking, in a voice as if he was speaking to a three year old.</p>
<p>"Harry, we need to talk." He says very softly. I nod slowly, desperately hoping that he will get distracted and forget about the whole thing. "I want you to know that you're not in any trouble and that you can speak to me about anything okay, I'm not going to be angry or mad, okay?"</p>
<p>I nod dumbly and he gives me a pat on the knee.</p>
<p>"I saw something last night Harry, something that has left me very worried and concerned. I saw… cuts on your arms Harry. I believe they were self inflicted too, is this true?" He says, worry evident on his face.</p>
<p>I nod again and he sighs.</p>
<p>"You have to stop. This isn't healthy nor do I believe it will help with the grief you are feeling right now. Is this because of Sirius?" He says, keeping his voice even.</p>
<p>I nod again.</p>
<p>"I thought so…" He said. "Listen to me Harry. You will stop cutting and doing anything else that involves you harming yourself on purpose. If you do not stop you will see a doctor. If you feel any urges, any at all, I want you to speak to me, or write it down. I will always be there for you kiddo. Always. Okay?"</p>
<p>I nod again and Remus gives my hand a squeeze before standing up and leaving the room.</p>
