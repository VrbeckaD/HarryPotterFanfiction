    <p>“Are you aware of the definition of the word ‘mandatory,’ Mister Snape?” Madame Pomfrey asked curtly. </p><p>“Y-yes, but—”</p><p>“Then you’ll understand that there are no ‘buts’ here. Headmaster Dumbledore had requested physicals for all Hogwarts staff. No exceptions.” </p><p>“Madame Pomfrey, please just—” </p><p>“That’s enough, Mister Snape,” she told him finally, making it clear that she would not be discussing the matter further. She placed a hand on his back and gently guided him towards one of the individual rooms in the Hospital Wing. “Now please, go and change into a gown. Someone will be along to administer your physical shortly.” </p><p>Severus did as he was told and slunk into the room. He opened his mouth in one last attempt to speak, but the door shut behind him quickly and he could hear the sharp click of Madame Pomfrey’s walking down the hall. He leaned back against the door, defeated, and glanced around the room. The ‘décor’ was much like that of the rest of the hospital wing: a white metal framed bed with dark green sheets and white counter with a sink. The only difference aside from it being a single room was the windows; they were covered in green curtains that matched the bed. Line shone in from the arched top portion of the windows, which were uncovered. Severus’ stomach dropped at the idea that things happening in <i>this</i> room weren’t suited for uncovered windows. </p><p>“It’s alright,” he mumbled to himself aloud. “It’s just a physical. All of the teachers have to do it. Hell, students do them all the time.” He stepped away from the door and walked around the small room briefly. There were other new fixtures in this room, such as a scale, and a metal cart with several instruments on top of it. On it were gloves, a thermometer, measuring tape, a small glass jar of some thick looking substance... he looked away from the cart and noticed the medical gown draped over the bed. “Bloody hell…” he cringed, picking it up. “At least Pomfrey won’t be looking at you in this.” After all, she had said ‘someone’ would be along; he wondered if perhaps Madame Pomfrey was administering the female professor’s physicals and a male would be administering his. He wasn’t sure how that was any less awkward, but tried to find comfort in that thought. </p><p>Hesitantly, he set the robe back down and began to remove his clothing, folding each piece neatly and placing it on a chair in the corner. He left his boxers on, certain that there would be no reason for him to be completely naked. The air in the exam room was cold and send a chill through his body. Just as he was tying the back of the gown, there was a knock at the door and a strangely familiar voice asked, “May I come in?” </p><p>Severus rose an eyebrow and managed a shy, “Yes.” </p><p>Much to his surprise, Remus Lupin walked in.</p>
