  <p>Remus Lupin was sitting alone in his shabby little flat when the news first reached him in the form of an agitated and exhausted looking owl on his windowsill. It was early in the morning, the sky outside still dark, and Remus was only half awake as he opened the window and accepted the small scroll that it held out on its leg. The note was from Dedalus Diggle, an excitable fellow that Remus knew from the Order. It took him only seconds to read it, and he felt his insides turn to ash as he did so.</p>
  <p><em>You-Know-Who defeated. I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, if you haven't already heard, but the Potters were his final victims.  It seems their young son vanquished him somehow, and still lives. We're all meeting at the Leaky Cauldron for a pint this evening, you should join. Best,</em> <em>Dedalus</em></p>
  <p>It was a bit difficult to decide what horrifying thought to grasp on to, but the thought of James and Lily <em>dead</em> was so horrible that his mind rejected it at first. He stumbled back to his chair, clutching the note in a bloodless hand, and thought blearily of Sirius. Did he already know? He'd be crushed. Remus had only seen him yesterday, and he'd been lamenting the fact that he'd barely even met his little godson -</p>
  <p>Oh, God. Sirius.</p>
  <p>Remus had always fancied himself a relatively clever fellow, so perhaps the thought should have occurred to him immediately, but it hadn't, because the thought of Sirius Black, his dear, precious friend, being... what? A traitor? A villain? A <em>murderer</em>? Was almost more repulsive than the fact of the Potters' death. But what other explanation was there? He knew Sirius to be James' Secret Keeper. They had even argued about it, with Remus worrying that it put too much of a target on Sirius' back. He'd been so worried, so stressed not only for James and Lily and their little baby, but for Sirius too, and now...</p>
  <p>James. He remembered the first time James had approached him, had revealed what he had learned, his animal form - a great gift to Remus in times of strife. Lily. Her bright, energetic smile, their enthusiastic conversations about the finer points of complex transfiguration theorems, the way she would thumb her nose at the other boys for their jokes whenever she and Remus got too worked up over a homework assignment. Harry. A boy he loved as much as he'd ever loved anyone, for all that he'd never so much as met him.</p>
  <p>Remus realized he was crying, shaking, every inch of his skin icy cold. How could this have happened? It was taking a while to dawn on him that he'd lost everything. James was dead. Sirius was... Sirius was not what Remus had always believed him to be. Even the defeat of Voldemort couldn't assuage the leaden weight in Remus' stomach. At least the Order of the Phoenix had been a welcoming home for him - a community he could rightfully call his own. He supposed the Order would disband now that there was no more large magical threat facing the community. He'd have to reach out to his remaining friends - Peter would be in hysterics, Remus thought dully, unwilling or unable to note the irony as his own panic attack continued, the thoughts swirling through his head faster and faster. And Dumbledore, Remus should probably reach out to him too, maybe Remus could offer insights about Sirius. He might very well be the last person Sirius had spoken to before he'd gone to his master Voldemort and -</p>
  <p>But no. It was ridiculous, all of it, simply impossible. Maybe Dedalus had it all wrong. Wasn't it just possible that the Potters were perfectly alright, that Sirius was safe at home right now? After all, Sirius Black loved James like a brother, loved Harry like a son. There was simply no way -</p>
  <p>A second owl landed on Remus' windowsill, and a third followed so closely behind that it nearly unseated its fellow. Remus rushed forward, certain somehow that the letters would contradict Dedalus, would free him of this mental prison, would put the world right again.</p>
  <p>The first was from Moody, a note saying that the Order's Headquarters should be considered compromised, given recent events. The second was a dispatch from the Ministry, announcing the long-awaited news that You-Know-Who had been defeated.</p>
  <p><em>Someone's been up all night at the Ministry working at this,</em> Remus mused. His brain seemed to have switched to a different frequency, one where his best friend wasn't dead, and his other best friend wasn't a traitor, one where his life hadn't just changed so unutterably that he wasn't entirely sure who he was anymore. <em>I suppose the Minster's approval ratings will go through the roof, although it's not as if he's had anything to do with it</em>.</p>
  <p>The note from the Ministry didn't contain any mention of the Potters. Remus supposed they were waiting for more information so as not to spread any untruths. He glanced down at the first note, the one from Diggle, and picked up the crumpled paper almost mechanically, re-reading it slowly as if maybe the message would have changed in the last several minutes. "It seems their young son vanquished him somehow, and still lives."</p>
  <p>Harry. Where was Harry now? Remus was sure Dumbledore would have made arrangements, but what were they? James' parents were dead, Lily's family were all muggles... Sirius was obviously out of the question, and Remus wasn't going to waste any more thought on him for now, lest he lose his mind entirely and start sobbing uncontrollably. But that left... well, that left <em>him</em>, didn't it? James had joked to Remus and Sirius when Lily had first announced her pregnancy that he'd flip a coin for godfather, and whichever one lost would get the next go-around. Lily had told him to take it one baby at a time. Remus could still remember the way they'd both been beaming, their young faces alight with the thrill of young love and impending parenthood.</p>
  <p>Trembling, Remus took the Ministry dispatch and flipped it over, scrambling for a quill on the messy desktop in the corner of his flat. He scrawled a brief note and sent one of the owls to Dumbledore, claiming responsibility for Harry Potter's life. He hadn't any idea how to be a father, but it hardly mattered. This was James's son. This was Lily's son. He had a duty, and under the circumstances he knew it was what his friends would want.</p>
  <p>Days later, as his note to Dumbledore remained unanswered and he finally learned the news that Harry had been left at an undisclosed location with protected muggle relatives, he admitted to himself, privately, that perhaps it was for the best. The thought of taking Harry in as his own had struck a match inside him, but not one of paternal love, exactly. It had been a match of manic desperation, for a distraction, anything to keep his mind away from the losses he had just suffered. His battered mind was already so inured to devastation that news of Peter's death and Sirius' capture hardly dented the armor he had built around his heart. He never visited his one-time friend in Azkaban. He was afraid of what he might do if he saw Sirius Black ever again.</p>
