  <strong>"Sorted Into Gryffindor"</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>(Date: September 1st, 1991. POV: Severus Snape)</strong>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Blast it all</em>,</p>
<p>Fire-Whiskey slithering</p>
<p>Down my throat as I</p>
<p>Calm myself,</p>
<p>I stalk toward The Great Hall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My black robes, all buttoned-up,</p>
<p>Sway loose at my sides.</p>
<p>It is one thing</p>
<p>I can control, one small</p>
<p>Habit I dare not take for granted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Students pile in, like cattle,</p>
<p>Awaiting their pathetic teenaged-fates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Albus has that damned twinkle</p>
<p>When he smiles at me</p>
<p>As if I am someone important, today.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>McGonagall, the thin-lipped, quick woman</p>
<p>Grips the bloody sorting hat</p>
<p>Calling another godforsaken Weasley—</p>
<p>
  <em>Merlin forbid any Weasels</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Not be sorted as Gryffindorks!</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am unsurprised, as per usual,</p>
<p>Until I see him:</p>
<p>Harry James Potter.</p>
<p>The-Boy-Who-Lived,</p>
<p>Sporting a curse-scar and all,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With his eyes glued to mine.</p>
<p>Lily Evans' emerald</p>
<p>Hypnotizing gaze—</p>
<p>Her nose, as well, I notice.</p>
<p>The lovely eyes narrow at me</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As if searching for a reason to hate me:</p>
<p>Just like his father.</p>
<p>Dark-brown, ragged, impish hair,</p>
<p>A trait of James Potter,</p>
<p>Along with that arrogant smirk he wears suddenly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No;</p>
<p>He looks afraid.</p>
<p>Wincing, he touches</p>
<p>His legendary, galleon-winning-scar,</p>
<p>Turning to yet <em>another </em>Weasley.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I narrow my eyes back at him,</p>
<p>Involuntarily touching my chin,</p>
<p>Wondering why the child is as thin as a rail.</p>
<p>James was too, I suppose.</p>
<p>The older Weasel glances up at me briefly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I scoff inwardly—</p>
<p>
  <em>No doubt</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The Weasels warn the boy of me</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Merlin-forbid,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>He not fear the Head of Slytherin House!</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Harry Potter."</p>
<p>Minerva even widens her small</p>
<p>Beady eyes at the name—the one</p>
<p>Used in bedtime stories, and in</p>
<p>All the wizarding newspapers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From a glance, Albus seems</p>
<p>Indifferent—but I know the man.</p>
<p>It takes him a great deal of effort</p>
<p>To withhold that curiosity—</p>
<p>I believe he nearly had a heart-attack from shock.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The eleven year old boy looks frightened</p>
<p>As if he were approaching his turn on death-row</p>
<p>In Azkaban,</p>
<p>
  <em>But why?</em>
</p>
<p>Surely, he would be confident</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With all that fame on his side?</p>
<p>
  <em>Not Slytherin,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Not Slytherin; Anything but Slytherin!</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Please!</em>
</p>
<p>I nearly snort, barely suppressing it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I shall have a</p>
<p>Hearty laugh in my quarters tonight</p>
<p>Over this boy bickering with</p>
<p>That crusty old black hat—</p>
<p>
  <em>Not Slytherin, Eh, Harry?</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>You could be great you know!</em>
</p>
<p>Doubt it,</p>
<p>Though he might have a shot</p>
<p>In the only acceptable house</p>
<p>In this bloody school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Alright</em>,</p>
<p>The sorting hat gives up</p>
<p>As if it were in a bitter marriage,</p>
<p>
  <em>Gryffindor!</em>
</p>
<p>I snort aloud this time,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Quietly, under all the</p>
<p>Annoyingly loud cheers</p>
<p>For the star of</p>
<p>Everyone's favorite</p>
<p>Hero.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I spy at Albus:</p>
<p>The closest person I have had</p>
<p>To a father.</p>
<p>Concern washes over his wrinkled face, and</p>
<p>He, too, is disappointed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He claps with the others, wearing that selfless grin for Harry.</p>
<p>The glint in his eye is gone.</p>
<p><em>Destined, he is, for Slytheirn</em>—</p>
<p>Albus babbled, two nights ago, with that blasted hat.</p>
<p>I sat, watching the delirious old man, praying to Merlin it was the sodding truth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Be that as it may,</p>
<p>Protecting the boy</p>
<p>Will be that much more strenuous, and I will always be a slave to Harry James Potter,</p>
<p>Who presently glares at Draco Malfoy, probably a future Death Eater.</p>
<p>I suppose it runs in the family, like everything else.</p>
