    <p>It was an exhibition game, nothing more. The Macusa Monarchs had locked in their spot in the NHL playoffs weeks ago, their home-ice advantage last week. Picquery would be resting her top players; neither Percival Graves nor Theseus Scamander would see as much ice time as they usually did. </p><p>Still, Graves had certain traditions to uphold, whether the game really meant anything or not.  He made pasta carbonara at noon, ate out on the balcony of his downtown apartment, looking over the river. Afterwards, he poured himself two fingers of Camus brandy (his father’s brand, his father’s drink) and nursed them until he was drowsy enough to draw the knockout drapes in his master bedroom and sleep. </p><p>The puck would drop at seven-thirty that night, so Graves’ alarm went off three hours, giving him a chance to shower and shave and dress in the suit that the NHL required before driving the fifteen minutes to the arena. He backed the Mustang into his spot, next to the owner’s ostentatious ‘game day’ Ferrari. That car still made him smile; Graves liked Mr. Lane; the plastics mogul was a good owner, fair to his players, but the gleaming metallic red sports car with its <i>MONARCH</i> vanity plate and gold crown tinted onto the rearview window was a tiny bit much. </p><p>Theseus was waiting for him at the exit to the arena, leaning back against the concrete walls of the garage. His long copper hair was tied  back  in a low, stubby ponytail to keep it out of his face during the game and he’d already abandoned his tie; the grey silk hung haphazardly out of one pants pocket. “Perce.” </p><p>“Tizzy.” He tapped the man’s shoulder. “How are you feeling?” </p><p>“It’s an exhibition game.” Theseus shrugged expansively. “No nerves. You?” </p><p>“Same.”  Theseus Scamander was six-foot, two inches, one-hundred-ninety-five pounds of French-Canadian power forward. He centered the second line for the Monarchs and was one of their alternate captains.  He wasn’t fast as Graves or some of the rookies, but he made up for it with tactical acumen, endurance, and an absolute willingness to drop gloves with the first person to look sideways at Graves.</p><p>Their shoulders brushed as they entered the arena, taking the far staircase to avoid passing by the visitors’ locker rooms. They stopped on the landing for another tradition. There wasn’t any need to jam the door this time to ensure their privacy; neither of them had terrible nerves that needed to be eased with touch and tongue. They would be quick. </p><p>Theseus leaned back against the wall, tugging Graves flush against him. “<i>Bonne chance, capitaine</i>” he murmured and kissed him lingeringly, a hand sliding against the back of his head, over the close-cropped hair on the back of his neck. </p><p>“Don’t punch anyone tonight, alright, Tizzy?” Perce pressed a small kiss against his mouth. </p><p>“Only the ones who deserve it.” Theseus gave him a lopsided grin.</p><p>Graves sighed softly. “Fair enough.” The kiss had settled him, a small soft reminder that it was game time and that his oldest friend had his back. They’d played together for years, starting in the OHL, when Graves had been the seventeen year old hotshot with the weird name and barely enough French to understand when he was being sworn at. They’d been-- more entangled-- back then, though they had broken it off when Graves had gone into the 2005 NHL draft. There had been no guarantee that they would land in the same country, let alone the same city, ever again.</p><p>But then two years later, Mr. Lane had handed Theseus a red-and-gold Monarchs jersey in the second round of the draft. And when Graves had backed his car into its spot on game day of Theseus’ debut-- it had been an Acura then, and certainly not worthy to be parked next to the Ferrari-- Theseus had been waiting, chewing on his lip and muttering to himself in French. He’d been so nervous that Graves had started  to get jitters just from watching him and he sworn under his breath and pulled the younger man into the stairwell, kissed him until he settled underneath his grip.  </p><p>Theseus had scored ten seconds into his first shift on the ice, so that stairwell, that kiss had become cemented into inviolable tradition. </p><p>“Perce.” Theseus tapped two fingers against his cheek. “Where’d you go.” </p><p>“Away. Sorry.” Graves gave him a half-smile. “Let’s go. Some of the others are probably already there.” </p><p>When they arrived at the locker room, it was already awash with activity. Graves slung off his jacket and started to undress. Theseus was on one side but the other was empty. It still felt strange not having Fletch on his left wing. Septima Fletcher was a veteran; forty-three and still playing. Graves had lived with her when he was first drafted by the Monarchs and didn’t have a place of his own. But she’d gone hard into the boards three weeks ago and gotten a concussion; the trainers had needed to help her off the ice. She’d not been able to play since. </p><p>Tina Goldstein stood at the far end of the ice, one foot propped up on the bench as she taped her stick and hovered protectively over Queenie, their goalie. It was unusual for the Monarchs to have one pair of siblings, playing together, let alone two, but Theseus’ little brother Newt sat next to Queenie, talking quietly to her.  Newt was fast and loyal, but by virtue of being younger and a defenseman, still skated in Theseus’ shadow. </p><p>They dressed; Graves let the trainers wrap his wrists then chased them away so he could tape his stick in peace. Picquery gave her speech and then it was ten minutes to game time and Queenie took her place at the head of the line. Superstition again--- their last line of defense should be first on the ice. </p><p>It would have been Graves’ prerogative to go second as the team’s captain, but he’d always preferred the end of the line, to watch his teammates’ back. Theseus took his place just in front of him. The other forward pulled on his red home-game helmet, tilting his head to one side as he fastened the chin strap. The decals caught the fluorescent light a little: the golden crown on the side of the head, his numbers- 22, the same as he’d had since the junior leagues-- on the back and just to the side of his numbers, a rainbow flag. </p><p>In 2011, Theseus had dated Abel Grenaway, a sports reporter. The media had found out. Abel had left, unable to handle the public spotlight and Theseus had hid in Graves’ house the entire night. He’d been crying and frantic, unable to believe he’d just destroyed his relationship and his career in a single night until Graves shook him and handed him his phone. “Tizzy. Look.” </p><p>Emblazoned across every social media outlet the Monarchs used-- Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, the team website-- had been a single image of Theseus skating across a rainbow background. <i> 2010 Stanley Cup champion. Conn Smythe Trophy Winner. 39 goals, 58 assists. Numbers talk.</i></p><p>Theseus had gone back to the game, put the flag on his helmet, skated faster, hit harder and no one had dared say a word. For him, for Graves, hockey was more than just a job. Eight months of non-stop play--- practice, shower, travel, play, shower, sleep, travel, practice, shower, talk to the media and play again. Even the summers were at the mercy of the rink. </p><p>But there were teams that were better and teams that were worse and as he followed his best friend onto the ice-- lights flashing, some hard rock anthem inaudible under the howling of their fans-- Graves remembered just how <i>fucking proud</i> he was to be wearing red and gold. </p><p>“<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please make some noise for your home team, the MACUUUUUUSA MONARCHS!</i>”</p><p> </p><p>“I still don’t understand how you saw the Captain for that backhand pass.  He was nine feet behind you!” TJ Oakhurst bounced up and down on his skates, somehow still having the energy to be exuberant after sixty minutes of play. </p><p>It hadn’t been particularly grueling; they’d played the Denver Maelstrom, a team whose record ranged from wincingly mediocre to “cry yourself to sleep,” but Graves still just wanted to shower, ice his wrists and go eat. </p><p>“I looked over my shoulder?” Sophie McIlvain was his right wing and she gave Graves a helpless  shrug as she fielded the rookie’s attention.  Fletch used to swear up and down that TJ was helplessly infatuated, but Graves couldn’t see it. He talked to Tizzy the same way, after all. </p><p>“Tizzy, how much media is out there?” he called, stripping the tape off his stick and wadding it up into a ball.</p><p>“Not much. NHL network, locals?” Theseus shrugged. “Shouldn’t be long.” </p><p>“I swear to God, Queenie, was it you or him?” Tina’s voice rang out from the back of the locker. Graves looked over to see her face and neck entirely soaked in Gatorade; the lid of her water bottle rattled to a halt on the locker room floor. Someone clearly had unscrewed the lid just enough that it stayed on until she lifted it to her lips. </p><p>“I didn’t do anything!” Queenie protested. </p><p>“Newt!” </p><p>“Why are you so sure it was me?” Newt looked positively wounded and Tina whipped a ball of  tape at his head.  Theseus was covering his mouth and very deliberately not observing what was <i>probably</i> his handiwork. </p><p>“Settle down, everyone.” Coach Picquery had arrived and the room hushed. Tina mopped at her face and jersey with a towel. “I’m sure you’re all excited to get out of the arena and get some <i>very</i> well-deserved R&amp;R, but there’s a few things you need to know. Firstly, Septima Fletcher will be announcing her retirement next week. Her doctors have advised her that her next concussion could be fatal.” </p><p>Whispers went around the locker room and Graves bit back a curse. Fletch was their most veteran player, a steadying force in the locker room and a savvy winger on the ice. They’d feel her loss in the playoffs. </p><p>“We’ll be bringing up some Black Aces from the minor leagues to fill up the roster and give us some flexibility. Their offensive coordinator will be coming up as well to ease the transition.  They’ll be some line shifts to spread the more experienced players around. McIlvain, you’ll center the second line; Oakhurst, you’ll step up into Fletcher’s position at least for the moment.”</p><p>Graves had just lost both of his wingers in about thirty seconds, Fletcher to retirement and McIlvain to the second line. He didn’t begrudge McIlvain her own line; she had the smarts and the skill to center but he didn’t necessarily like the idea of Oakhurst permanently taking up Septima’s position. He’d  done well enough over the past few weeks, but...</p><p>“So who’s on my left then?” Graves asked. </p><p>Seraphina nodded in acknowledgement. “You’ll meet the other Black Aces in a couple of days but we brought in your winger and the offensive coordinator.” She beckoned to the door. “Graves, you’ll have Credence Barebone on your left wing. And this is offensive coordinator Gellert Grindelwald.”</p><p>The Black Ace was an inch taller than Graves, but lean and rangy and his ill-tailored suit only reinforced the impression of how <i>thin</i> he was. Handsome kid though, maybe, if he took his eyes off the floor and stopped hiding behind his shaggy dark hair--- and his offensive coordinator. </p><p>Gellert Grindelwald was ten years older than Graves; about his height with blond hair that <i>had</i> to be bleached. He’d put on weight since he’d played for the Beltway Bullets in the ‘80s-- a career where he had thoroughly embraced their “scare ‘em off the ice” tactics. Graves remembered hearing his father ranting about “the fucking German goon; what kind of name is Gellert Grindelwald either.” He’d not known that he was coaching for their minor league. He didn’t like it, but he didn’t get to choose the coaching staff. </p><p>He waited until Picquery had dismissed rest of the team, then stepped up to meet them. “Credence. It’s good to meet you,” he said, extending his hand. “I’m looking forward to playing with you.” </p><p>“And you’re Godwin’s little boy, aren’t you,” Grindelwald said as Credence shook Graves’ hand. </p><p>“I’m Percival, yes,” Graves said thinly, but it was his father’s grudge, not his, so when the offensive coordinator held out his hand to shake, Graves took it. </p><p>Grindelwald smiled broadly. “Looking forward  to working with you too, son. See if we can amp up that offensive capability.” </p><p><i>Son?</i> Graves bit his tongue to keep from retorting instantly. He wasn’t some rookie or a Black Ace. He had two Stanley Cup rings and a litany of hardware: Conn Smythe, Calder, Lady Byng, Hart Memorial and like hell he was taking any nonsense from the man who had sent his father into the boards so hard it had ended his career. </p><p>“By offensive capability, do you mean getting the pucks on net? Or dirty hits?” Graves asked, meeting the man’s gaze. His eyes were mismatched; one brown and one such a strange blue it was nearly purple.  “Because I’ve got one of those covered and I’m not interested in the other.” </p><p>“Such arrogance, Percival,”Grindelwald chided. “Even a top player can have things to learn.” </p><p>“I’ll listen to whatever you have to say,” Graves answered. “But I’ll play my game. Unless you’ve got a Cup or two to change my mind?”  He was being petty and he knew it, but Gellert Grindelwald’s career had ended without even getting in spitting distance of the Stanley Cup. </p><p>The insult didn’t seem to land and Grindelwald smiled again and settled a hand on the Black Ace’s shoulder. “Oh. None yet. But I’m sure you and Mr. Barebone will assist with that lack of hardware.”</p><p>“Perce. <i>Capitaaaainne,</i>” Theseus whined from the door, clearly waiting for him. </p><p>“Looking forward to the playoffs, then,” Graves said and turned to leave. </p><p>He was halfway to his car, shoulder to shoulder with Theseus, when he realized that in all that time, Credence Barebone hadn’t said a goddamn word.</p>
