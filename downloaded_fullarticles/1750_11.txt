    <p>For a reason she couldn’t put a finger on, the crowd surrounding Hermione at Platform 9 ¾ made her palms sweat. There were parents hugging their children anxiously and friends laughing, and despite everything that had happened—despite all the people that couldn’t return—it felt <i>normal</i>.</p><p>Hermione swallowed, trying in vain to clear the lump in her throat. If there was one thing she was never good at, it was pretending. It seemed like everyone else was doing their best to put the war out of their minds, but Hermione couldn’t bear to pretend that nothing had happened. There were absences that cut into her like a knife, and for once, Hermione wasn’t thrilled to be returning to school. This cheap imitation of normalcy seemed like a slap in the face to those they had lost.</p><p>Guilt stirred in her gut, and she clenched Harry’s hand tightly in her own, glancing up at him nervously.</p><p>“Hey, it’ll be alright,” he whispered, squeezing her hand. “Think about it—a whole year to study without having to constantly keep Ron and me from dying at every turn. Isn’t it like—” he drew his hand out of hers to gesture wildly in the way he always did when he was trying to cheer her up with his antics—</p><p>“—Hermione’s wet dream?” Ron’s face was pulled into a half-grin, his hands shoved into his pockets.</p><p>Hermione snorted, rolling her eyes. “Yes, well, contrary to popular belief, my life does not revolve around ‘Gryffindor’s Golden Boys,’ but I will miss you.”</p><p>Ron waggled his eyebrows. “Are you sure your life doesn’t revolve around us? I, for one, find Rita Skeeter’s story <i>much</i> more interesting than you studying in a library twenty-three hours a day without us, but I’ll miss you too, ‘Mione.”</p><p>Just three short weeks ago, Rita Skeeter had implied (on the front page of the Prophet no less) that Harry, Ron, and Hermione were in some sort of three-way magically-bound relationship, despite the fact that Harry was well known to be perfectly happy with Ginny. Of course Skeeter couldn’t have turned her focus on the <i>much</i> more important issues, like the antiquated exploitative laws that governed magical creatures, but Hermione had gotten a kick out of the whole ordeal anyway; Ron had convinced Harry and Hermione (with Ginny’s express permission) to pretend to to be in a relationship in front of some of the Ministry’s more conservative officials while the trio accepted some drab award, and quite a few old knaves had gotten their knickers in a twist.</p><p>Feeling rather cheered up, Hermione smiled at Ron. There was an awkward moment when it was clear that he wasn’t going to initiate contact—although it had been over three months since they had broken up, and what they’d entertained could hardly be considered a relationship—and then, with a huff, Hermione drew him into a warm hug, letting herself relax into the soft, worn fabric of Ron’s robes. She pulled back, suddenly fighting tears, and turned quickly to Harry, clinging to him tightly.<br/>
“Merlin, Hermione, you know we’re going to visit practically every weekend, right? You’ll never be able to get us out of your already-impossible hair.” Harry’s voice was teasing, but from the hoarse tone, Hermione could tell that he was just as affected as she. </p><p>Voice muffled by his chest, Hermione replied, “I know, it’s just—it won’t be the same.”</p><p>Harry grasped her tighter in his arms, squeezing her to the point of pain.</p><p>“It won’t, but we’re always here for you.” He drew back a bit, holding her shoulders seriously. “I mean it. You don’t have to do this—if it gets too hard…” He trailed off, and Hermione managed a tight smile.</p><p>“I know Harry.” There was another long moment of silence.</p><p>“Right, well—I better see Ginny off.”</p><p>Hermione nodded, but she could have sworn she saw Harry wipe at his eyes surreptitiously. Hermione’s chest squeezed, and she almost rushed in for another hug, but settled on a reassuring pat on his arm, and teased, “Don’t worry, Ginny and I will take care of each other, and we’ll make sure to tell you about all of the <i>marvelously</i> exciting adventures we have without you.” She paused for a moment, then added, “And—Harry—I love you.”</p><p>With an easy smile, Harry turned away, his black robes sweeping behind him. “Love you too, ‘Mione.”</p><p>Ginny was waiting patiently a few feet away, nibbling her thumbnail nervously (a nervous habit that both she and Hermione picked up after the war). She looked relieved when Harry approached her, and leaned up on her tiptoes to kiss him.</p><p>“Bleh,” Ron muttered. Hermione laughed, rolling her eyes at the hyperbolic expression of disgust twisting Ron’s face and contorting his freckles. They stood in silence for a few moments—silence that very delicately toed the line between comfortable and awkward—and then Ron blurted out unexpectedly, “Y’know, Hermione, I really love you.” At her rather startled expression, crimson began to splotch his cheeks. Ron had never said that to her before—oh, sure, she <i>knew</i> he loved her without having to ask, but whenever he had told her he loved her, it had always been ‘I love you guys,’ referring to both her and Harry, and usually before or after a near-death experience. Ron’s smile was sheepish. “Not—not like that, ‘Mione—I just—y’know—you’re really important to me, and—”</p><p>Hermione cut in gently, setting a hand on his arm to stop him from incessantly scratching his head (it seemed they had all picked up nervous habits). “I know, Ron. I love you too.” There was a moment of heavy silence—decidedly not awkward, this time; almost comforting—before Hermione added, “I’ll have you know that you are my favorite ex.”</p><p>Ron laughed. “Hermione, I’m your <i>only</i> ex,” he pointed out, and she didn’t argue with him because she could hardly count what she and Viktor had had as a <i>relationship</i>.</p><p>The train whistle blew a final warning, the sound sharp and piercing in Hermione’s ears. The loud noise set her pulse racing for a not entirely pleasant reason, and she had to swallow a few times to push away thoughts of the war and subdue her fight or flight reflexes. Lights flashed behind her closed eyes.</p><p>Though Ron was not what she would call an observant man, he caught on to her anxiety and squeezed her shoulder reassuringly.</p><p>“You’re my favorite ex, too,” he said with a smile gentler than Hermione would have thought him capable of.</p><p>Suddenly choked up, Hermione turned and boarded the train, but not before she heard him shout something that sounded suspiciously like, “Look in your pocket!”</p><p>As the train pulled out of the platform, Hermione turned to see Ron and Harry, now standing side-by-side, wave enthusiastically. She waved back until she was sure they couldn’t see her anymore—until King’s Cross was just a speck on the horizon (an old superstition of her mum’s). At the thought of her mother, still living as Monica Wilkins in Australia because Hermione Granger—Brightest Fucking Witch of Her Age—couldn’t break the memory charm, Hermione’s stomach clenched, and she dropped her hand.</p><p>This was going to be a long year.</p><p> ________________________________________________________________________________ </p><p>The train was cheerful, most compartments filled with chattering students. The faint aroma of chocolate already drifted through the air from the sweet carts, and Hermione’s mouth watered. There were shrieks as friends reunited, most students trading smiles generously, but the buzz of excited talking only irritated Hermione. She clenched her hands, swallowing thickly. Harry and Ron’s absence felt like a gaping hole at her side, and the thought of spending a year without their stupid jokes made her almost want to stop the train and give up on her final year of education.</p><p>She took a deep breath in, reminding herself that this was <i>exactly</i> why she had to spend a year without her best friends. They had been through so much together, it was difficult not to grow dependent on each other—but if her childhood muggle therapist had taught her anything, it was that codependency was dangerous when left unchecked. Besides, Hermione was independent. She was a war heroine and the Brightest Witch of Her Age and she was <i>Hermione Fucking Granger</i>—she could bloody well handle a bunch of cloak-wearing, wand-waving children, even if a good portion of them were pureblood elitists.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Hermione sighed and pushed her way into the nearest bathroom, carefully restoring her Hogwarts robes to their original size. She stripped unceremoniously and pulled on the familiar garments. Looking in the mirror was like experiencing an unsettlingly strong bout of deja vu. She almost looked identical to Before Hermione: same robes, same mass of hair, same full lips and light brown skin—but the poor mimicry couldn’t fool her. It was her eyes that were different, she decided. They were still wide and very much the same dull brown, but even in the mirror her gaze weighed heavily, as if it could strip past the layers of skin and flesh to the white bone that lay beneath.</p><p>Hermione turned on the tap-water and rinsed her face, washing off her unease, before turning her muggle clothes right side out. There was a bulge in her right pocket. Ron. With a snort, Hermione pulled out a terribly-wrapped package (Really, Hanukkah wrapping paper? The Weasley’s weren’t even Jewish!) and peeled off the paper. A note, written in Ron’s terrible penmanship, fluttered to the ground. Hermione reached down and picked it up.</p><p>
  <i>Hermione,</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Since we’re not here to help you get into trouble, we figured we’d best give you a nudge.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Ron and Harry</i>
</p><p>The object itself seemed to be a bracelet from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, and Hermione vaguely remembered Ginny waving it around excitedly over the summer and describing in minute detail the unbearable pain it would evoke the victim’s genitals. Instructions were written neatly and signed by Fred and George (Hermione felt a pull in her chest at the thought of George’s dead twin), and they included a carefully-worded liability clause and a warning stating that the long-term effects of the hex were unknown, so the product should only be used on a man whose fertility posed a serious threat to society</p><p>Despite herself, Hermione smiled and slipped the bracelet on—a simple silver string that adapted to the size of her wrist. She doubted she would ever use it (she wasn’t <i>that</i> vindictive), but it was a neat idea and she liked that it reminded her of Ron and Harry.</p><p>With one final look in the mirror, Hermione turned and strode out of the bathroom, but not before carefully pinning her Head Girl badge on the breast of her robes. Headmistress McGonagall had owled her just hours after she had announced her plans to return to Hogwarts, enclosing the badge and a brisk but not unkind note that had ensured that Hermione had known quite well that accepting the position was optional, but if she declined, a certain Minerva McGonagall would never, under any circumstances, forgive her.</p><p>Fingering the elegant ridges in the badge, Hermione felt a sense of calm settle over her.</p><p>She could do this.</p><p>Of course, that was <i>before</i> she ran straight into Draco Malfoy in the hallway.</p><p>His chest was solid and hard, painful against her nose, and she let out an <i>oomf</i> as they collided. She peered up to find that—irritatingly—he had grown over the summer, and the top of her head now barely reached his chin. Hermione’s mouth watered at a delectable scent that washed over her—was it coming from him? His hair was done differently—it was longer, and tousled suggestively instead of being slicked back—but the startling silver-blond was the same, and his face was still twisted into an unpleasant expression. His eyes, though—not even the sneer that settled on the rest of his face could disguise the haunted look in his eyes. How had Hermione never noticed that his eyes were such a piercing silver? It seemed odd, in hindsight, that Hermione had never paid much attention to the way that Draco Malfoy was made entirely of angles—brows, jaw, cheekbones; even the straight line of his nose (but his lips, soft and parted slightly, looked absolutely kissable). She could—</p><p>Kissable? <i>Kissable?</i> Sweet Circe, had she just thought that Draco Malfoy (<i>Draco Malfoy!</i>) had <i>kissable</i> lips? What was wrong with her!</p><p>Flustered, she looked down, her face at eye-level with the Head Boy badge pinned neatly on the front of Malfoy’s robes. Of course he was Head Boy, a part of her thought distantly; McGonagall would want to make a point about unity, and he had always received excellent marks—but her reaction to this new revelation was rather subdued in the face of the much more important revelation of her subconscious specifically thinking that <i>Draco Fucking Malfoy</i> had <i>kissable</i> lips.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Nervously, she hazarded a glance upward, still acutely aware of the lack of space between her and Malfoy; her chin almost brushed his robes. His sneer was gone, replaced by an intense expression that Hermione couldn’t quite place. His nostrils flared; Hermione was surprised he hadn’t hexed her yet.</p><p>There was a long silence, and Hermione braced herself for any number of unpleasant insults, but then, without taking his eyes off hers, Malfoy murmured, “Careful, Granger.” The words reverberated in her head, settling heavily on her shoulders. His voice was soft, but Hermione couldn’t help the shiver of fear that slithered up her spine. She had expected a jab or cruel words, and Malfoy’s unreadable expression and intimate tone of voice threw her off kilter.</p><p>She swallowed, and Malfoy’s eyes flicked downward before he whisked away with a <i>whoosh</i> that left Hermione trying to place his scent.</p><p>“Meet you in the last car in thirty,” he called over his shoulder, his voice once again taking on the cold quality she had come to associate with him. For a moment, she was bemused, blinking rapidly to clear her mind, before she remembered the glittering gold Head Boy badge that had adorned Malfoy’s robes. Of course. They’d have to meet to discuss their plans for the year—and, she realized with a jolt, she would be sharing a common room with him. Dazed, Hermione continued down the corridor, absently tucking her hair behind her ear only to have it spring back.</p><p>What the fuck happened to Malfoy?</p><p>More importantly, what the fuck happened to her?</p><p>Maybe she would need that bracelet after all.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________________ </p><p>Ginny, of course, had saved a seat for her. The compartment was empty besides the slight girl, most likely because her belongings were spread out over each and every unoccupied bench in a manner that clearly warned off those looking for a seat.</p><p>“Hey, Gin,” she muttered, shoving a couple of Ginny’s jumpers unceremoniously onto the floor and sitting next to her.</p><p>Ginny smiled, dimpling, but Hermione could see that her eyes were red-rimmed.</p><p>        	“Is it Harry?” She asked, gently coaxing Ginny to lay her head in her lap. The familiar weight made Hermione’s nervous stomach settle, and she threaded her fingers through Ginny’s vibrant hair. It was an unspoken rule among the two of them that whoever was in the worse mood got lap privileges.</p><p>Ginny fingered the edge of Hermione’s robe, pinching her lips together. “No. Well, yeah—it was rough leaving him, but it’s more than that. This whole thing feels—I don’t know.” Ginny’s eyes had gotten that absent look that meant she was thinking about the war. “I just want everything to go back to normal.”</p><p>Stopping herself from pointing out that <i>normal</i> to the two of them was losing their childhoods to war, Hermione ran a soothing hand down her friend’s back. She had never really understood the fuss about physical comfort before the war, but now if she went a day without Ginny or Harry or even Molly’s soothing touch, she would feel a desperate tightness in her chest.</p><p>She and Ginny had talked about this—about normalcy—before, and Hermione had thought on more than one occasion that her and Ginny’s incredible friendship was due partly to their wildly different coping mechanisms. Ginny wanted to forget, and Hermione wanted to remember. “I don’t,” she whispered, her hand stilling on Ginny’s shoulder. “I couldn’t bear it if we went on like nothing had happened.”</p><p>Her friend reached up to tangle her fingers in her own. “I know. I know Hermione, and I—I respect you for that. Sometimes I think wanting things to go back to normal is the coward’s way out.”</p><p>Hermione snorted dryly. “There are worse things than cowardice.”</p><p>Ginny’s noncommittal hum vibrated on her thigh. After a moment, she murmured, “I suppose neither of us are going to get what we want. Going back to Hogwarts—the Welcome Feast and all the people we used to know and even the goddamn <i>thestrals</i>—it will always be too normal for you after everything and it will never be normal enough for me to return to who I was before.”</p><p>“You don’t have to be who you were before, Ginny.”</p><p>They were quiet after that. Hermione felt as content as she could be while feeling like her ribs were trying to claw their way out of her throat. No, normal would never be enough for her. Ginny was wrong—the only cowardly thing to do was to cling to violence that should have been let go long ago simply because it was all she knew. Hermione took a deep breath, imagining her ribs rearranging themselves in her chest into a shape that would not catch every drifting bit of hatred and pull it close like a shield. Ginny squeezed her hand.</p><p>The dynamic between her and Ginny was new, and it seemed to thrum like a hummingbird between their clasped fingers. They had both changed—Hermione didn’t think that they would have been such good friends if not for how the war had changed them. They were both still aggressive and headstrong, and their clashes were loud and angry, but they never fought about anything that crossed the Line, except for when they did—only one or twice or three times—and afterwards there were always moments like this—soft and vulnerable, when Hermione knew instinctively that Ginny had more goodness in one of her pale eyelashes than the world ever deserved. She and Ginny grounded each other, and if she had not seen the way Molly Weasley worried over Harry like a child or the way Teddy Lupin called every member in the Order <i>Papa</i> because they had never given him cause to think otherwise, she would not have believed something so delicate and strong and beautiful could be born from such ugly violence.</p><p>Maybe that was why she couldn’t let go of the war.</p><p>A throat cleared itself in the doorway, and Hermione lifted her head. Couldn’t they see that she and Ginny didn’t want company?</p><p>She opened her mouth to reprimand a younger student who inevitably thought that catching Hermione Granger and Ginny Weasley along was an opportunity to ingratiate themselves with war heroines, but then she froze. Malfoy stood in the doorway.</p><p>For a moment, he looked guilty, like he was invading a private moment—which he <i>was</i>, and then the cold mask fell over his features. He had gotten better at hiding his emotions than he was in third year when Hermione had punched him.</p><p>He hovered in the doorway, leaning casually as if he had any right to be here—to be at Hogwarts—and anger twisted in her gut even though she knew all too well that finishing his education was one of the stipulations of his sentencing (she was there, after all, and had testified for him).</p><p>“Sod off, Malfoy,” she muttered halfheartedly, still clinging tightly to Ginny’s hand. “The cabin’s full.”</p><p>“I’m not looking for a seat, Granger,” he drawled lazily, dusting an imaginary fleck of dust off the sleeve of his robes.</p><p>She frowned, trying to gather her thoughts. Hermione Granger from Before would never let herself become so scattered. “Then—”</p><p>“I’m looking for you.” He let his statement hang in the air for a long moment, and Hermione was about to open her mouth to tell him <i>exactly</i> where he could shove the new and brilliant insult he had no doubt sought her out to offer when he added, “It’s been forty-five minutes. You’re late.”</p><p>Pre-War Hermione would never have been late.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“Really, Granger, if you expect me to do all the work around here—”</p><p>Stifling a growl, Hermione relocated Ginny (as gently as her temper would allow), gathered her things, and shoved past him into the hallway, holding her breath when she passed him because she could smell that delectable, unidentifiable scent rolling off him in waves.</p><p>She walked at a brisk clip to the back cabin and then, as soon as Malfoy had followed her in, slammed the door shut. He had a rather pleased look on his face, and she had to steel herself to keep from wiping it off with one of Ginny’s bat bogey hexes.</p><p>“Malfoy, you know as well as I that if anything, <i>I’m</i> going to be the one doing all the work around here,” she snipped, pulling a piece of parchment from her beaded bag and shoving it unceremoniously into his chest. “In fact, here’s the Prefect patrol schedule that I made <i>just in case</i> the Head Boy turned out to be an incompetent git like you.”</p><p>Malfoy ripped the paper from her hands with a murderous look. Hermione half-expected him to tear it in half just to spite her, but instead he looked up, duplicated the paper, and shoved the original back to her.</p><p>“Fine,” the blond sneered, “but don’t expect any special treatment from me just because you’re the <i>Golden Girl,</i> Granger. You’re still an insufferable swot, even if the rest of the world thinks you’re some deity for memorizing a few Defense Against the Dark Arts books.”</p><p>Hermione’s smile was razor sharp when she replied. “Oh, I didn’t deluded myself into thinking that your last minute change of heart during the war was indicative of any capacity for human decency, <i>Malfoy</i>.”</p><p>They glared at each other for a long moment before Malfoy turned away without another word, Prefect schedule crumpled in his hand, and swept out the door. Hermione loosened her tie, inexplicably hot, and huffed in frustration. Malfoy hadn’t changed at all—except for the inches he grew and the delicious new cologne and the angles on his face that had most definitely been carved by Michelangelo himself with a very, very fine chisel—so, she supposed, he really had changed quite a bit.</p><p>Fuck.</p>
