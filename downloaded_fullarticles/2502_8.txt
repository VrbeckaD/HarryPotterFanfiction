But our tale follows two Slytherins, Marcus Flint and Theodore Nott.</p><p>Theodore asked, "Were you scared when you found out there was a snake in the school?"</p><p>Marcus smirked. "Me, scared? Never."</p><p>Theodore admitted, "I was a little scared that such a dangerous creature had been petrifying Muggle-borns."</p><p>Marcus reassured him, "You were never in any danger, Theo. You're a pure-blood just like me."</p><p>Theodore smiled. "I suppose you're right, but a giant ass snake in Hogwarts is some story for the Daily Prophet."</p><p>Marcus chuckled. "I don't think Dumbledore would ever let them know."</p><p>Theodore grinned. "For the better, Marc. We don't want this school to shut down."</p></div>
