    <span>Severus,</span>

    <span>If you are reading this it may already be too late. This would only come to you if Harry was in danger. I hid something from you. Something big. Harry is not my child. He is yours and James'. James and I, we had planned to tell you the truth once the war was over. This letter/journal means we have died and Harry was placed in the care of my sister. Our wills stated clearly that Harry was not to go to my relatives. He was to by given to Sirius or Remus if Tom was still alive. </span>

    <span>Sirius and Remus both knew the truth about Harry's blood lineage. It has also come to my attention that I, myself, am not who I was thought to be. In seventh year we did the family tree potion and parchment. Turns out that Tom Riddle is my real father. I am not muggleborn. But here's the kicker. We did the potion on Harry once we went into hiding. James’ bloodline leads back to all four of the Founders. That makes Harry the heir to Hogwarts. </span>

<p>
  <em>
    <span>Please, take care of Harry. Don't let them have him and please keep him from both Tom and Dumbledore. Another matter to discuss was that Peter was the secret keeper. Dumbledore knew this. About us keeping Harry from you, it was for the best. We thought it was much safer that you not know. Only four people knew the truth. Sirius, Remus, James, and me. Both Tom and Dumbledore would have killed Harry, and you, if they knew you were his father and James his bearer. </span>

  <em>
    <span>My marriage to James was a scam. We only married to protect you. James truly loved you. He admitted to the fact that he was after my hand to make you jealous enough to realize he liked you. When you became a Deatheater James nearly killed himself. He knew you loved me and that you had only slept together because you were drunk. James decided to let go and try to care for me in a loving way. </span>

  <em>
    <span>However, when he found out he was pregnant with your child he was scared that it would make you hate him more. He almost terminated the pregnancy. I convinced him to keep it. Harry's real name is Harrison Severus James Potter. Please do not hate your son for James’ mistakes. </span>

  <em>
    <span>His green eyes though we think they are from the Slytherin bloodline. They are Avadaka Kadavra green. Please go to Harry and save him if you can. I have feeling he will end up in Petunia's care despite our will. Her and her husband will surely kill him before he could ever get to Hogwarts. This book will record every injury he sustains within his lifetime. It was spelled to do so. It will even tell if Harry is dying.</span>
