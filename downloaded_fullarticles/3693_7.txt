    <p>Newt studies hard and rarely has time for even his close friends, but he still felt a bit lonely. Tina, Queenie, and Jacob understood that his zoology studies were important for him and they never gave him a hard time when he sometimes was a bit slow to reply to texts or calls and whatnot. He loved them to the moon and back, they had been such great support for him through even the hardest of times, when he had come out of his life on lies, telling everyone that he was homosexual. His family had not responded that well too it, but it could’ve been a lot worse than that. However, even though he had his friends and their support in everything, he still felt kind of lonely.</p><p>Newt had had boyfriends from time to time, but none of those relationships had last longer than 3-5 months. Newt was simply too much into his study in animals and their behavior to be a proper boyfriend. The kind that replied to texts, kept sending snaps, and spend hours on hours doing nothing together. That was too much of a waste of time for him. He had a dream of one day traveling the world, finding new species, and maybe even one day see his own name in those thick lexicons he himself studied now. </p><p>Also, they had all been at his own age and that was a bit of a turn-off for Newt. Not like they had to be old and grey, but there was something stirring in his stomach when he thought of someone maybe 10 years older than himself. It was thrilling. He had never said anything to his group of friends, not even when Queenie had decided to find him a man. Or in Newt’s opinion; a boy. Newt was 25 himself, and the oldest one Queenie had tried setting him up with had been 27. </p><p>In Newt’s daydreams, he could find someone whom he could spend a little time with, snuggle with, casual sex, but nothing more. He didn’t want that feeling that he had to let go of his books to reply every second to a new text message of something irrelevant. He wanted to shut down his phone for hours without feeling guilty. That’s why he wanted a man. A real man who knew that his work was important, one who didn’t have to send 10 messages saying; ‘u mad?’, ‘what did I do?’, ‘y u don’t want me?’.</p><p>Just the pure thought of that made Newt sigh heavily as he reached over to pluck another grape from the bowl. Chewing on the fruit as the sweet flavor filled his mouth. Outside was grey and raining, winter was around the corner. He buried his nose in the old, dusty-smelling book about Darwinism. He had tests coming up at the end of next month, not that they would be any hardship. </p><p>The looks of the weather made him exhausted in a way that made him feel bored. His mind wondered further away from developing of beaks on finches, to the fact that he wanted someone to share a bit of his life with. Share a more private side of himself. </p><p>That’s how he ended up searching for others who shared his little secret of wanting someone older than himself. Some articles more extreme than others, going from someone who’s partner were 6-8 years older than them, to barely legal twinks, to people with an age different over 30 years, and then to something that caught Newt’s attention the most; sugar dating. He had heard of it before, but he would be honest and say that he only knew the teenage-stereotypical-funmaking-version of it.</p><p>Rich old men burning money on stuff to younger ones for sex.</p><p>Newt could now see that there were so much more to it than that. </p><p>It wasn’t all about Gucci bags and sex behind marriages. It was about intimacy and wanting to treat someone, treasure them even. Some wanted sex in exchange, other wanted a sweet thing on their arm while going out for dinner. It was selfish, but Newt found himself wanting to be pampered like that by some handsome man. </p><p>It only took 20 minutes before the curious ginger had made a profile on a sugar dating site.</p><p>He had butterflies fluttering in his stomach and he promised himself that he didn’t necessarily have to reply to anyone or comply to everything he was asked to do. He knew it was stupid, but it calmed him down to think that he was only in front of a phone screen, he could always delete his account if it was too much for him. </p><p>Newt steadied his breathing that had gone a bit harsh with the whole scenery of men. It was like shopping for new clothes. He could choose exactly as he wanted and how he wanted it. It was a bit materializing that he had to write height and weight, what he was seeking, how he was build, muscular, chubby, skinny. The worst part had been that the site hadn’t said ‘male’ or ‘female’, it was whether or not he was Sugardaddy or Sugarmama, if not that, then: Sugarbabe or Boytoy. Why boytoy? Why not male or female Sugarbabe? Boytoy was so humiliating but exciting to think of himself as. His cheeks shaded pink as he clicked the baby-blue icon saying ‘Boytoy’. </p><p>He browsed profile pictures for a few pages of Sugardaddies. Some had ordinary pictures, nothing exciting. Others had downright disgusting pictures of their dick, who would chat with a dick? Then there was the more Fifty Shades of Grey type of men. The suit and tie type. That was what got Newt’s blood to travel from his head and beneath his belt. Not that any of those caught his eye in any way, but the sheer though of a man like that wanting one like him. Sinking to his knees, nuzzling his face against the hard outline of someone cock in such an outfit. </p><p>A problem was forming between his legs, so he logged out and decided to take care of himself in the shower.</p><p>--- </p><p>The next few days, Newt had gotten quite a lot of messages on the dating site. Some less sober than other. No one had in particular matched his taste yet. He had gotten maybe 4 messages who had asked him if he would give them a blowjob for $150. That was in his mind prostitution, and if people was into that, then it was fine, but it was not at all what Newt was looking for. So he had kindly ignored those.</p><p>Some had been boring, asking him how he was doing, that wasn’t neither what he wanted. He had more and more played with the thought of a more dominant Sugardaddy. Newt had never thought of himself as boring in bed, but his last partners had been. Newt enjoyed a little rough handling, someone who would pin him down every now and then and show him where he belonged. So polite conversation was fine, but if it already there was boring, then nope. They were declined too.</p><p>Newt hadn’t said a word of it to anyone in the little group of friends when they had been out drinking coffee together. It was nerve-racking, they told everything to each other. This was a bit too private, Newt had decided. Queenie had met some guy that would be perfect for Newt, as she had put it, but Newt had kindly chuckled, saying that she knew well enough that his study was much more important for him. She had playfully rolled her eyes at him, saying he would end up as a crazy cat-lady if he kept living like this.</p><p>That night, when they had all said goodbye and Newt was back in his little apartment, he had gotten a notification from the dating site. He had changed into his pajama pants and a large t-shirt, jumped onto his bed and made himself comfortable before logging in. </p><p>He had gotten a message from a user named Perce.G. </p><p>“Hi Newt,<br/>
I couldn’t help but click on your profile. Not only does it seem like we seek the same thing, but you also look stunning.”</p><p>Newt smiled at that, feeling his cheeks betray him by coloring slightly.</p><p>“I want someone I can spoil in the exchange for their company and perhaps intimacy. If I do get the honor of your attention, then please let me know if you would like to join me for dinner. I would like to get to know you and we can talk about boundaries and limits there. My pleasure, of cause.<br/>
-	Percival.”</p><p>Newt felt his heart jump in his chest. He bit his lip and read the message one more time before clicking at the picture to see Percival’s profile. He didn’t have a lot of pictures, none of them showing his face completely, but then again; a lot did that to hide their identity. Percival’s profile did though show that he was 43. The thought of that send shivers down Newt’s spine. </p><p>The first picture showed a sharp jawline, white skin, a hard contrast to the tiny bit of 5 o’clock shadow showing on his chin. He was wearing a three-piece suit, white shirt, black waistcoat, and black jacked. A black tie with small, grey markings, all put together with a delicate little chain with two scorpions at the end on the neck of the shirt. It was mysterious and Newt felt drawn to it immediately. The picture only went to mid chest, obviously Percival kept himself private.</p><p>The second and last picture were full body, but still without face. This time it was cut from the shoulders. One hand in his pocket, the other holding a drink. He was sporting a dark grey suit, the jacked open and showing a black shirt underneath. It was stretched across his chest nicely by his posture, but it didn’t seem like the picture was taken to show off, more like it was from a party. In the background were other people in what seemed to be beautiful dresses and suits, all blurry except Percival. </p><p>What a shame his face wasn’t showing, but that was ok, it was a site that would put you under quite a label if someone recognized you. Especially if they knew you were a 43-year old, writing to a 25-year old about ‘intimacy’. </p><p>Newt read the message one last time before figuring out what to reply. He made sure to put it up just as nicely and well-written as Percival had done, so that he wouldn’t look like some regular, unmatured student looking for a fun time. </p><p>“Hello Percival,<br/>
I would very much like that. When, where, and how?”</p><p>It was short, too short for Newt’s liking. He would normally have asked a lot of questions, get a background on the other, but he felt a rush of boldness, so he hit send and bit his bottom lip hard. There was no undo button. </p><p>Newt locked his screen and pushed the phone away from himself. A tight knot was forming in the pit of his stomach, half excitement, half scared to death. This guy could be a wicked serial killer. He reached for his phone again, he would have to write this to Tina. If she at least knew, then he had a backup when he was going to meet this Percival. He could give her the address to where they were going. Tina could keep a secret. Tina would rescue him if something happened. </p><p>Tina would also stop him from doing it. She would scold him about even thinking of having sex with a man twice his age and then in exchange for something. She would mean it in the best way, she always made sure that Newt was safe, but right now Newt needed to try something new, something exciting, so he instead put the phone away again with a sigh.</p><p>Newt watched his phone, waiting for a sound or a light. Something indicating an answer from the handsome stranger, but before he knew it, he fell asleep on top of his duvet with his phone in hand.</p><p>--- </p><p>Newt woke the next day when his phone rang. He looked around with a still half-asleep mind, hand slapping around on the crumbled duvet, searching for the bloody device that still blasted out some stupid, giddy melody that Queenie had put one her name in his phone. He finally found it, inside his pillowcase. It took him 3 tries to answer it.</p><p>“’M’yeah?” he answered grumpily, rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand. He ran the hand down his face, stopping by the side of his mouth where there was dried up drool. Newt pulled a face of disgust before scratching it away.</p><p>“Hey sunray! Are you with Tina?” Queenie squeaked into the phone. She was too happy this early in the morning. Newt pulled the phone away from his ear until she finished speaking.</p><p>“No?” </p><p>“Oh … ok, talk to you later, hun, bye!” and then she hung up. Newt looked at the phone like it was its fault she had called and woken him up. </p><p>It was no use now going back to sleep. Not only had her high-pitched voice done a great deal in waking him up, but he also had to pee. He got up and stumbled to the bathroom across the hall to relieve himself before stumbling back into bed, falling onto it and crawled under the warm duvet. </p><p>He yawned before unlocking it. Routinely going through his apps and social media to check notifications and such. Newt felt restlessness in his bones, like he was excited for something. Something he’d been waiting for, but couldn’t put his finger on. It wasn’t until he was done opening snaps on Snapchat that he realized the little icon over the dating app. </p><p>Newt felt his heart jump into his throat. He opened up the app, watching the little red dot after the name Perce.G. The butterflies in his stomach fluttering around as he clicked it.</p><p>“Saturday night, 7 pm. Send me the address and I’ll pick you up. Wear something nice.<br/>
-	Percival.”</p><p>Commanding, was a fitting word. Had Newt not been so sloppily tired, his body would probably have reacted fondly on that. </p><p>Saturday was tomorrow already, that meant Newt had one day to find out where his suit was or if it was even clean enough for something like that. Giving the pictures the other had on his profile, a matching suit was the only acceptable thing to wear, no matter what Percival had planned. </p><p>It was dangerous but now it was happening. Newt answered only his address and nothing more. The message only made room for a decline. There was no arguing that it was now planned and Percival did not need a confirmation on it.</p><p>He would be of no good until he’d had something to eat, so he made the journey to his little kitchen combined with living room to serve himself some serial. The plan was to eat, find the suit, and then read a few chapters for his test. He doubted he would be able to concentrate on anything at all. He was going on a date tomorrow with a mysterious man. Percival. It was a strange name that Newt had never heard before. Maybe it was a fake name for the site? </p><p>Before he knew it, Newt was seeking the name out on his phone, finding himself on a name-for-the-baby-site. Percival was the perfectly pure knight around the Round Table. That voted good, didn’t it? You should never judge a book by its cover, but this one’s cover was really fine, if Newt should say so himself. He kept scrolling a little, his curious mind taking control of his actions and before he knew it, he was looking at Italian girl names and comments where pregnant soon-to-be-mothers were arguing over the name Fabiola. </p><p>After that great adventure, Newt headed back to his bedroom in search for his suit. He tipped out most of his closet without luck, then he got on his tiptoes, pulling out bags and plastic bags from on top of the closet. No luck there either. Not until he was halfway under the bed did he finally find it, carefully tugged away in a box. </p><p>Newt found his way out again from under the bed, pulling the box with him. Is was nostalgia to look at again. It was a casual marine blue jacket with matching pants, a white shirt and black dress-shoes. Newt’s brother, Theseus, and their parents had brought it for him for his graduation when he was done with his education as a zookeeper. After that he trotted on studying even more into zoology. He did miss being out in the field. But he wanted more than to just feed and groom animals, he wanted his name in the books, help endangered species, and it had been his dream for as long as he could remember. </p><p>It was a nice suit and it was the only one Newt had. Besides, he didn’t have a bag full of gold for a new one, so it would have to do.</p><p>--- </p><p>Newt sniffed under his arms again, he had to be sure. He still smelled like soap, which was good. He had polished his shoes and ironed his shirt, looking all proper and sharp. The suit still fit perfectly. His hair, though, lived its own life. Newt had tried to style it, but next time he looked in the mirror, it was floppy and messy again, so nothing he could do about that. He had even gone as far as plucking his eyebrows. Not into a feminine fashion, but the few hairs out of order was now gone. He had shaved, which had also been unnecessary, giving that Newt couldn’t grow a beard. It was only sparse hair here and there, but if the other at any point would touch – or kiss – his face tonight, he wanted it to be smooth. </p><p>Percival would be here in 5 minutes. Thoughts of how to greet the other, what to talk about, how to act was running wildly in his head. He felt sick and twice had he felt like peeing but couldn’t. It was only nerves, Newt told himself. If it all went wrong, he could always go home and pretend it never happened. No one knew he was going on a date, so there was no one to laugh at him.</p><p>Newt gave himself a once over again, tidying his clothes in the mirror before heading out into the cold. </p><p>In his head he was chanting ‘hello, I’m Newt, nice to meet you’. It would be embarrassing to stand there and then forget his own name. And how exactly was he going to find the right car? He didn’t even know how Percival’s face looked like.</p><p>Newt took up his phone, checking the clock when a midnight black Bentley pulled up in front of him. The phone ticked up to exactly 7pm. Right on time.</p><p>The driver got out of the shining car and Newt held his breath. His hair raven black, grey at the sides and slicked perfectly back, black thick eyebrows that framed his face in an artistic way. His dark brown eyes locked with Newt’s as his thin lips turned into a sly smirk. The suit he wore were black as well, the scorpions pinned over the tie. Newt shivered, but not from the cold. The man was shorter than he had expected, though. Not that it mattered.</p><p>None of them said a thing as the stranger eloquently walked around the front of the car to open the passenger door for Newt, who were still bolted to the same spot. </p><p>It’s now, Scamander, move your legs, Newt thought before his body would finally comply. Percival had a stretched-out, leather-clad hand for Newt to take, which he did when he came closer. Newt was trembling slightly, his hand betraying his act of calm. </p><p>“Newt.” Percival greeted before kissing his hand softly, never breaking eye contact. Newt’s eyes were fixed on his hand. The act was so formal and yet so strangely intimin. The ginger had never tried anything like this, and none of the articles on sugar dating had had such a good looking and elegant gentleman in it. </p><p>“Percival.” Newt replied but it was only above a breathless whisper. He felt his face for the first time that day turn red. A predatory and charming gleam went over Percival’s eyes as he guided Newt to the car, which door he was still holding open. When Newt was in, he carefully closed the door before making his way to the driver’s seat.</p><p>The car was smooth, brown leather with a spark of black running in the interior. It was nicely heated and it smelled like new car. Newt had never been in a car this expensive. Chesterfield-like padding on the doors and seats, and what appeared to be real wood in the steering wheel. Newt was no car expert, but this was utterly luxurious. </p><p>Percival drove off to wherever he had plans for their evening. Every now and then he would look at Newt, taking in the sight of him.</p><p>“So, Newt. Tell me about yourself.” Percival started the conversation so easily that Newt felt star struck once again. How could he talk so calm and collected?</p><p>“I-I am studying in zoology, I’m from England, and this is my first time ever-… doing this.” Newt’s tone was shaking a little, but he thanked whomever was to thank that he didn’t stutter or stumbled more than that. </p><p>Percival nodded before saying; “you do have a lovely accent.” His dark eyes shortly landing on Newt again, “And don’t worry. If it calms you down this is my first time too.” </p><p>Newt didn’t believe one word of that last sentence. Percival was far to collected for that, but Newt wanted to believe it, because it was a calming thought. Newt looked to his hands at the compliment, not really knowing what to do next, except the obvious; “What about you?”</p><p>Percival hummed shortly, a nice, deep sound in his throat. “I own my own company, I am born and raised New Yorker.” He had a soft smile on his lips and it took the edge of Newt that the older one wasn’t as stoic and strict in person as he was in his messages. </p><p>“May I ask what company?”</p><p>“P. Graves Security.” Percival answered in a way that made it sound like it was nothing, but not in a snobbish way. Newt had heard of P. Graves Security, it was the biggest security company in New York. Newt’s eyes grew wider and so did the other’s smile when realization hit the ginger. </p><p>“That is why I haven’t shown my face on the website.” Percival stated, “That is also why I need you to understand that this is private. Unfortunately, I have a lot to risk, so I hope you understand my concern and my need for you to also be discreet?” His deep voice now stern, but not unkind. </p><p>Newt nodded, “Yes, of cause.” He did his best to give Percival a reassuring smile, but he was afraid he failed it. The other smiled back in the same second, so it couldn’t have been all that bad. </p><p>They continued with light conversation after that. Newt told him about his studies and love for animals. Percival himself was fond of animals, especially dogs and he had one himself. A Rottweiler named Rex. Newt had chuckled a bit of the name, apologizing right away, but Percival had smiled fondly and told him that he hadn’t named the dog. He had brought Rex from a rescue center where he already had the name. He could see the stereotypical image it gave him, having a Rottweiler, with Percival’s looks and work, even worse when the dog’s name was Rex.</p><p>Percival was interested in Newt’s work and asked more questions about it than Newt had excepted. It was nice talking to someone who wanted to listen.</p><p>They finally reached their destination. A small but unique French restaurant. Percival had opened the car door again, offering his arm for Newt to hold as the valet got the keys to the car. They were right away lead to their table. It was in a corner, giving them privacy. The whole place was neat and stylish. Only very few tables which were all occupied by others as sharply dressed as Percival and Newt himself. Newt had never been to anywhere like it. It was authentic, or so Newt though, he’d never been in France but it looked like the pictures he’d seen from time to time. </p><p>Percival had told him that it was all arranged, a three-course menu specially from the cook with wine served to perfectly match. Newt wasn’t picky at all, but he hasn’t gotten any experience with wine, except the cheaper ones that Tina sometimes serves when she cooks. Newt’s eyes had caught the prices of the wines on the card, ranging from $100 to $300, and that was only some of them. It was hard for him to get used to the idea that he shouldn’t worry at all about this. This was a gift for him, by a stranger.</p><p>It rarely got silent between them, and when it did, it wasn’t uncomfortable as Newt had feared. They only really kept quiet when the waiter would present and serve their food. It was delicious and so tasteful that Newt wondered if it was even real. The wine was good, but Newt felt a little bad that it had been no matter what wine that was served, he would probably taste it the same. Percival was patient with him, teaching him roughly how he could determinate the flavors, laughing sweetly whenever Newt guessed wrong or simply gave up, chuckling himself. Percival kept to only tasting the wine, giving that he would be driving home.</p><p>Percival was never braggy or made Newt feel insecure when he was so clearly out of his comfort zone in luxury. Percival simply guided him and treated him equally, even though Newt was far out of Percival’s league. </p><p>After hours of delicious food and getting to know each other, they decided it was time to leave. The great thing about valet’s, Newt learned, was that they didn’t have to walk in the cold winter night to find the car, or worse; wait for a bus or train. It also meant that the car was already heating when they got into it. </p><p>Newt sank back into the plush seat, feeling a lot more comfortable and at ease this time. The alcohol might also have a slight effect on him, he wasn’t used to drinking. Most of the way to his place he had discreetly looked at Percival. A nice silence filled the car, the humming of it was hypnotic and Newt felt pleasantly tired. </p><p>The car pulled to a halt outside the apartment building, the engine was killed and then it was all silent. Percival was watching him with a pleased and warm expression. Percival got out and, ever the gentleman, opened his door and carefully help the cozy younger one out into the cold night. He walked him to the stairs before stopping. Their eyes met in the dark.</p><p>“Newt, I want you to know that I don’t expect anything in return,” he talked low, as if he didn’t want to ruin the peaceful moment. They had talked about that already tonight. Newt believed every word he said of it.</p><p>A leather-gloved hand cradled his chin as Percival leaned closer. Newt’s heart skipped a beat and his tiredness seeped out of his bones in an instant. Percival stopped half an inch from Newt’s lips. His breath hot against the youngers lips, as Newt closed his eyes and leaned rest of the way in. It was a soft press of lips, only tasting the waters. Another followed right after, just as careful as the first before Percival pulled away. Newt hastily tried to follow in the hopes of one more. </p><p>Percival ran his thump over Newt’s bottom lip, leather smooth against the skin. His eyes followed his finger as he spoke, “Goodnight, Newt.”</p><p>“Night, Percival.” Newt watched as the older turned and walked back to the car. He stood there, on the stairs, until the car was back to life and on its way. Then he made his way upstairs, into his apartment. Too tired to feel anything put teenagerly giddy inside as he went directly to bed.</p>
