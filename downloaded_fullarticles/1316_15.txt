  <span>Unum centum vitae!” Lucius Malfoy shouted in pure rage aiming his wand for The Boy-Who-Live.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>

  <span>Harry Potter had dropped and shattered the prophecy that the dark side had been after for years. if Harry was being honest, he would tell anyone who asked what he thought about prophecies he would tell them that he thought them to be bullshit. When the spell hit he fa elt a pain worse than any Rape session that his uncle and cousin had ever put him through. It started with the eyes and spread throughout his body. It was only because he had so much practice with staying silent while in pain that he was able to not scream out in agony. Lucius Malfoy let out a surprised gasp because the boy's green eyes started to be taken over by a purple color.</span>

  <em>
    <span>‘A little girl about seven sat in the corner of the room as her parents signed the paperwork that the goblins provided for them to sign. She was a squib after all and no one wants a squib, especially not on like her.</span>

    <span>“ It’s official Iris stellae Black is now an orphan and will be placed at the nearest muggle orphanage,” the goblin said</span>

    <span>Her parents got up and started living. Her father stopped next to her, looked into her violet eyes with his ice-blue eyes with disgust and disappointment. As he finally passed her by mutter ‘good reddens’ with such disdain it hurt. Her mother didn’t even look at her as she left the room, her mother's neat red hair that Iris inhabited was a mess and her brown eyes were watery but Iris couldn’t sense the hatred her father had on her mother.</span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span> </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Alright Miss Black it’s time to go,” the goblin said’</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>the rest of the fight was filled with that one vision up till Bellatrix cursed Harry's godfather into the veil.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I killed Sirius Black! I killed him!” she cried as she ran off and harry chased her down the corridor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Crucio!” harry shouted as they got to a floo.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bellatrix fell to her knees not expecting the Boy-Who-Lived to Crucio her, she screamed for a good couple of seconds before she started giggling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have to mean it icy baby potty!” she laughed </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He tried again, making it last longer than before but in the end, she still laughed in his face. Then a thought struck him and he turned his eyes that were almost completely violet on Bellatrix with a cruel glint in them that made her stiffen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I could kill you,” he suddenly said in a calm tone</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was at that moment that the dark lord Voldemort had found them but he kept out of sight just to watch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I could kill and no one would blame it on me,” he said looking down at her no longer holding the cruse “no one would know, after all. Your just a filthy Death eater, no one would blink twice,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That had the dark lord stiffen like his subordinate. Could the boy be bluffing?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“they would most likely blame it on whatever Malfoy hit me with,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The dark lord reminded himself to ask Lucius what he hit the Boy-Who-Lived with later</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?” the dark lord made himself known making the boy jump</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy turned to him and he had to keep from gasping in a manner not becoming of a dark lord. The boy’s left eye was completely swallowed by violet and the right on was halfway there. The boy looked surprised to see the dark lord there. Dumbledore showed up seconds later and a fight that will go down in history ensued.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> *</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> Harry was in the infirmary as he listened to Dumbledore and Madam Pomfrey.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He has gotten more powerful madam!” Dumbledore exclaimed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now Albus I don’t see how that is a problem,” Pomfrey said </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He is not yet seventeen and he has gained as much a magical boost as if he had just turned seventeen,” Dumbledore tried to argue “He blew up my office! and look at his eyes!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That enough out of you Albus!, get out you are disturbing my patients!” she said scolded pushing him out of the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry closed his eyes and fell asleep dreaming about that poor little girl with red hair and violet eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>

    <span>‘The goblin that now looked human apparated them to a place called ‘Lotus Children Orphanage’ the place was falling apart and look old.</span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Alright Miss Black this is your new home from now on,” he said pulling her with him to the orphanage</span>

    <span>The matron, who insisted everyone called her Madam Especia, didn’t like Iris at all. Iris always had to go last in everything except the chores that she was now to do all day every day. Iris got the littlest and coldest bedroom and the thinnest blanket and a hard pillow, she, however, had no bed and had to sleep on the floor. She even cut all of Iris’s hair off into a boy cut say her hair was an eye-sore. Iris cried hard that night because she remembered her mother's warmth and how her father used to tell her how beautiful her hair was, she missed her home and she started wishing death on the matron.</span>

    <span>Iris waited all week for her eleventh birthday hoping that she would get a Hogwarts letter but it never happened and she realized that her parents had been right to thank that she was a squib. Iris cried for months in the safety of her room hoping to hope that this was just a bad dream.</span>

    <span>Iris was twelve when she first killed someone, it was an accident. One minute the man was trying to rape her and the next he was dead. Iris knew that squibs had a little magic in them but not enough to do magic and she had believed it was not enough to do accidental magic. That night when she got back to the Orphanage she told the matron that she tripped.</span>

    <span>Iris was fourteen when the booming started, she and the other kids would hide in the bunkers until morning hoping against hope that they would survive. Iris died on her fifteenth birthday when she was locked out of the bunker, all she felt was a burning pain and she was no more’</span>
