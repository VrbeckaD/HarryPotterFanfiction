    <span>Prologue</span>
  </u>
</p><p align="center">
  <u>
    <span>Kalina Potter – 3 years old Hatake Kakashi – 5 years old</span>
  </u>
</p><p>
  <span>Kalina Dorea Potter, looked around the library with interest. She was staying with her grandpapa to learn everything she can and despite being young, she quite understands that someone has cursed her grandpapa. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite barely four-year-old, Charlus can see that his granddaughter is a prodigy, just like his late wife. Oh, how he missed his late wife, Dorea Potter nee Black. Sweet little Kalina, even at an early age, she did not view the world like any other children, in fact, she is the most understandable child he has ever seen  his whole life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knew he has been cursed and now his little granddaughter is at the library in Potter Manor. He knew that his sweet, curious and understanding granddaughter were in the library when suddenly he heard a yelp and he cannot feel his little granddaughter presence and magic in the air.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His granddaughter magic is quite soothing to his broken soul, but now he can’t feel it any longer. He runs into the library as fast his feet can bring him. That is when he saw a book that lay on the floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gingerly he picks up the book. He read the page that his sweet granddaughter had been reading and tried to keep calm. What he saw was something quite mind-boggling. How in the Merlin and Morgana bloody mind he missed about those?  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Again he read gingerly, worrying about his little granddaughter. He keeps on read it carefully, as he finishes it, he gives out a slow breath he didn’t know he was holding . But to be honest, anyone would  be worried if someone had put them in his shoes. Thanks, Merlin and Morgana, his little Viburnum will not be harm nor have to pay anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he still needs to talk about this with his little Viburnum. He knows his granddaughter is a prodigy but to just jump into another world just by reading; he needs to make sure something sat straight to her. Oh well, at least she alright and the time will not change much, and he needs to make sure that her core is stable too. Charlus looks over his large library with a fond smile, it seems like he needs to make sure that all those books fall to his Viburnum no matter where she goes.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Both Minato and Kakashi stop their training when they heard a feminine yelp. Minato eyes turn wide when he saw a little girl with hair as red as blood and green eyes looking back at him. Meanwhile, Kakashi feels like he was slapped upon smelling the scent that comes from the girl. Seeing the confused look from the girl, Minato walked right in front of the girl.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The girl looks over Minato with calculating, yet patient, eyes which for him is quite a relief “Hello, are you alright?” The silver-haired boy with the masked looked at the redheaded girl with narrowed eyes. Minato would guess that she was around three or maybe four years old. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Again he tries to talk to the girl which make the girl caress her forehead and from the look  in her eyes, he can tell that she doesn’t understand what he is saying. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then something he thought that might be easier to understand for the girl. He points to himself “Minato” Seeing the girl's eyes light up and how she nod her head, he guesses that she understands it. He called out for Kakashi to come to him and when the boy arrives, he points to the boy “Kakashi”.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kalina” The girl point to herself but then a frown, slowly she raises one of her hand and when she was about to place her hand on Minato head, the silver hair boy shoves her hand away which make her frown wondering why the boy shoved it away.    </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Minato sighed but then place her hand to his head and for some odd reason he feels something warm on his head and saw she place her another hand on her forehead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seeing the girl smile, he feels like there is something he missed. “Thank you, did not understand before. Now understand, take language and history to learn.” But then she goes still and looks at Kakashi, seeing the silver-haired boy with narrowed eyes, Kalina eyes turn wide and look back at her hand and back to Minato “Should not do that, right? Oh, grandpapa will be mad.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Minato smiled and chuckled. ‘Oh, this girl doesn’t understand what they say but she also understands that she should not do that without saying anything. She might become a good shinobi one day.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright, Carina.I think I can forgive that, but next time you should tell us. Shinobi are paranoid,"  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kalina tilt her head “Shinobi? Like, warrior? Not know Shinobi, but a warrior, yeah. Like grandpapa,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t know shinobi but you know what is a warrior and like your grandfather?” Kakashi frown and wonder who is this girl, is she a spy? Seeing the girl nodded her head, she points to herself “Want to be a warrior, like a grandpapa but want to learn medical too. Want to cure grandpapa of the war. Grandpapa being curse, read a book for grandpapa, then here I am."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both Minato and Kakashi look at each other with a frown. Translation ‘she wants to be a warrior like her grandfather but she wants to learn medical too,  just to cure her grandfather who has been cursed in the war, and while she read a book to find the cure she suddenly appears in that training ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That means she accidentally read something that can make her appear… but before they can say anything, they hear a yelp and the girl is nowhere around, but when they look at where the girl sat; they saw a necklace laying on the ground. A wolf necklace howling to the moon.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kakashi looks at the necklace with interest. Minato who saw that, assure for Kakashi to hold into it.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p align="center">
  <u>
    <span>Kalina Potter – 4 years old Hatake Kakashi – 6 years old</span>
  </u>
</p><p>
  <span>Kalina winced when she heard someone shout with delight and when she saw someone blur to her, she back paddles and hid behind Kakashi as fast as she can.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aww, why you hide from me?” A redhead woman with blue eyes asked her with a pout</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because you squeeze me until I’m out of breath. Grandpapa will furious about that." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both Minato and Kakashi winced upon remembering the intimidating man that Kalina referred to. To be honest, both of them were kind of shaking upon feeling that man’s killing intent and not only that, they wondered on how the hell their Hokage-sama were able to be friend’s with that man, it was beyond them.    </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kakashi almost feels like he wants to be a small pup when that man looks at him and not only that, when he GAVE BACK the necklace that Kalina dropped the last time they met he even felt the need to bolt away from the man’s presence. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Obito and Rin looked at each other with wonder, plus not only that, they also wondered who that girl was. Her hair is blood red, unlike Kushina red hair and her eyes, is so pretty, they never had seen such beautiful green eyes like the girl's eyes before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Grandpapa?” Kushina tilts her head as she hadn’t heard  that someone important was coming to Konoha or anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A good friend of Hokage-sama,” Minato said which make Kushina look over Minato with a frown upon hearing how shaky his tone are. She needs to know who this person are and what that person has done to make her lover so shaken. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Minato who saw Kushina look was only able to shake his head.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Charlus and Hiruzen take a sip of their teas with a chuckle while Nara Shikaku, Yamanaka Inoichi and Akimichi Choza look at two men with a slightly sceptical look. Both men are war veterans and for some odd reason, they can feel that both men just made an unholy deal and comrade,, Kami-sama help them all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Poor boy” Charlus shook his head while Hiruzen is only able to raise his brow wondering what his new friend means. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a Potter curse” Again Charlus shook his head and start to chuckles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Enlighten us, my dear friend” Hiruzen intrigued of this curse, hearing that tone and the light of mirth in his new good friend is enough to tell him that the curse is something that he will enjoy and it will not harm his village.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even the Shika-Ino-Cho, wander about this curse, seeing those twinkle is enough to make them curious and interested.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For male Potter, when we see the woman we are  interested in, we will do whatever we can to get her. While for the female, well they are oblivious if someone tries to pursue them and what makes it more interesting, we Potter attract fan-boys and fan-girls  at every corner, well that is Potter for you.” Charlus shake his head but still have that huge smirk which makes Hiruzen more interest in it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And with Black blood in there, I have no idea on how many peoples will develop a big complex," </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And why is that, Potta-san?” Inoichi look at the eldest Potta with interest and to be honest, even both his friend’s looked  quite interested, poor brat, they needed to have a lot of patience there, even Hiruzen agreed about that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, Inoichi. Black is known as a noble family, for about over a thousand years. Potter is also one of the noble families but we are younger than Black, around two hundred years. The Black families are known for their gene, they are beautiful and aerostatic but, they can also be vicious to those who harm their families.” The Shika-Ino-Cho nodded their heads understanding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlus sips his tea but then look over the Shika-Ino-Cho with seriousness, which makes the trio sit straight. “Shika-Ino-Cho, I, Charlus Fleamont Potter, a war veteran, will train the three of you in everything I know.” Before Hiruzen is able to open his mouth, Charlus hold his hand out and look at the trio dead set.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shikaku, your shadow is able to do more, in fact, it can be good in defence and offence too, thus I will train your shadow to be deadlier and how to use your shadow in defences. Inoichi did you know your mind jutsu able to make other people dead and not only that, but you also can learn on how to remove someone memories too. Your jutsu is also able to make an invisible wall as a defence, literally. Choza, your pills will destroy you, but I know things that is much better and will be able to help you much better and not only that, it won’t bring any side effects at all. Not only that, but I also notice you can make your body bigger with your own will, which I will help you in how to make it deadlier and your body become like steel or iron, whatever you wish to call it.”    </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This makes the Shika-Ino-Cho frown but interested with the new knowledge “Why? What do you wish to have from this Potta-san?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlus give an understanding smile before he drops the bomb on everyone in the room. “Nothing, I need nothing, only one. Take care of my little flower. I’m dying.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hiruzen and the trio look at the man with a frown and wonder whether the man being hit on his head or what. Seeing that look make Charlus give out a bark of laughter. “I am dying, I think I already told you before that I fought in a war. Well in that war, I’ve been hit by a curse which makes me die slowly. My little Viburnum knows about this, she has been looking for a cure for sometime. But to be honest, I don’t want to be cured. I have stayed for far too long, I wish to be with my beloved wife.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlus sip his tea again, he looks like he has been longing for his wife for sometime, Hiruzen understands that feeling. “My sweet Viburnum is quite the intelligent, I’m sure one day she will love to stay here, I would love for all of you to take care of her and her maybe brother or sister on the way. Not only that, I’m sure my granddaughter will change her name one day just to get out from that place and just be herself," </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before the other can say anything, they hear a knock on the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come in” Kalina walked in with Minato and Kakashi next to him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kakashi who saw the sharp look Charlus gave him had him wanting to cower behind  his sensei, but knowing the man is a war veteran, he braves himself to stay there.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He feels like someone calculated him and seeing how Kalina grandfather give him a smile; he feels like he passed something.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlus look over at Minato but then pinch his forehead and give out a deep sigh. “Kalina Dorea Potter” Others who hear Kalina name look over Charlus and Kalina with interest while the young child stands straight and look over her grandfather with a guilty look in her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kalina Dorea Potter, please tell me you didn’t pick something from Minato," </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hearing the </span>
  <em>
    <span>oh so sweet</span>
  </em>
  <span> tone of her grandfather, she shifts from one side to another. “Kalina Dorea Potter, answer me when I ask you something.”    </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I… I don’t understand the languages, so… I… I took the information of languages, history and some geography," Kalina look over her grandfather, and before Charlus about to say something, Kalina adds it fast “I touched none of the memories he has, I swear grandpapa. I only took what I need to know, I touched nothing. I’m sorry grandpapa," Kalina murmur the last part with guilty. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlus sighed and look at his granddaughter. “Do you know if you’re not careful, you could kill Minato, not only that, he might lose his memories if you’re not careful. Kalina, they are shinobi, a warrior, a soldier, like me. What if something bad happened to him? And how did you know how to do that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Again Kalina feel so guilty for putting Minato in danger with what she had done. “I’m sorry, but I apologised to Minato about that. I learn from a book and Mimi let me practise to her. I’m sorry grandpapa, I will be more careful,"   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ma… ma, I think Kalina-chan already aware of her fault, and everything turned out alright, nothing is happening.” Minato tries to help Kalina but upon seeing Charlus eyes, he gulps and wishes he can turn into a little kid again but he keeps on the brave facade. “Potta-san, Kalina-chan wish to say something,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlus look over his granddaughter with a questioning look. “I want to attend the Academy here, please” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The whole room become silent before Charlus bark out laughter. “But you need to be asked that Jiji over there sweetheart."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kalina looks over Hiruzen and before he can say anything, she sits down with a seiza style and bows her head. The others look over Kalina with wide eyes while Charlus only smirk upon seeing how serious his granddaughter are. “Please, Hokage-sama. Let me study at the Academy. I need to learn so I can protect my family. I know that they can protect themselves, but I know with mama and papa having intercourse like a rabbit…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hearing those parts, the males in the room choke their saliva, even the ANBU that Hiruzen trust choke on his saliva.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sweetheart, where did you learn those things and how did you know about </span>
  <em>
    <span>intercourse</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” Charlus asked </span>
  <em>
    <span>politely</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Meanwhile, the others shift from one side to another as they can feel the Killing Intent of getting a spike. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“From Uncle Sirius. He forgot that it is his turn taking care of me when he has intercourse with an unknown woman. They can be loud too," The other males look over Charlus with pale and sweat drop when they heard what the Hime said. “Sirius, eh? Thank. You. Sweetheart. Why gentlemen, it seems like I have a dog that needs to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>tended to</span>
  </em>
  <span>. We will continue this talked later. Thank you for your hospitality Hiruzen. Boys, I will meet you later. Kalina come,"  </span>
</p>
<hr/><p align="center">

    <span>Kalina Potter – 5 years old Hatake Kakashi – 7 years old</span>
  </u>
</p><p>
  <span>Kakashi looks over Kalina with irritation. Come on, he was at the academy for a year to become a Genin and another year to become Chunin but here she is, not even a year, she already Genin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here, for you” Kalina place something on his hand which make him tilt his head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A box?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Open it," </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Minato, Kushina, Obito and Rin look over the two with interest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kakashi eyes turn wide when he saw what was inside. A necklace, it was the same as Kalina’s too. He looks over her with wide eyes, which Kalina returned with a soft smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Welcome, congratulations, sorry for being late giving it to you, this supposed to be your present for passing Chunnin,"</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>“Ah, young love” Charlus chuckles upon seeing his granddaughter and Kakashi. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hiruzen and the trio look over Charlus with a smirk. “Hiruzen, again, I hope you can take care of my granddaughter. I’m sure she will change her name when she wishes to stay.” Charlus tap his chin, thinking of the new name he sure that his granddaughter will use as her name “Aota Maeko, yup that sure a nice name, and I won’t be a surprise if she chooses that,”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The trio and Hiruzen didn’t believe it.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>“Aota Maeko. I will choose that name as my name,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlus give out a burst of loud laughter while the others look at her with shock. “Can I asked why you choose that, hime?” Shikaku looks at the girl with a smirk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maeko means a child of truth. I am the truth about what happened to my families. I am the truth that grandpapa </span>
  <em>
    <span>tend</span>
  </em>
  <span> to Uncle Sirius, as grandpapa said and it sure is something joyous moment for me since mama and papa also join too," </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hearing it, the other males only able to shook his head, while Charlus still look over Kakashi. “Boy, can you give me your necklace and yours too little flower”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both children look at each other but then Kalina shrugs her shoulder and gave it to her grandpapa. When Kakashi gave his necklace, Charlus asked him to hold both his and Kalina necklace before Charlus muttered something with a stick pointed to where was he holding the necklace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You must wish to know why I did that," Kakashi only able to nod his head but then Charlus look over his granddaughter. “Do you wish to elaborate to the boy, sweetheart? I’m sure you can detect it,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kalina looks to Kakashi and explained everything. “Grandpapa adds some of your chakras on mine and your necklace, that means that ours will be linked. Since mine already has mine Kekkei Genkai and chakra, my grandpapa shared it with yours. That way you will feel my emotions and everything, whether or not I’m in danger, something like that,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlus nod his head but then he would add something “I also added something, which it is a benefit for you Kalina.” Kalina looks over her grandpapa, as she can tell there is a </span>
  <em>
    <span>but.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“But,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sharp as ever, my little flower. Yes, there is a </span>
  <em>
    <span>but</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The others in the room listened tentatively and wonder what it was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are only able to use it once and when I say once, I mean only ONCE. Use it when you truly are in an EMERGENCY! It will drop you near to this silver hair boy,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kalina nods her head. “Then how about on the book that can make me travel to Konoha?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It will burn, right after you use that necklace of yours. I make that as protections for you and perhaps to your sister or brother to come. I might be old but I’m not stupid. I know your papa and mama is trying for another one and I surely know you also know about this and I surely know you never wish to be there. You are quite intelligence for a young age. I put everything under your name,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kalina knows her grandpapa is dying and didn’t have a much longer and her grandpapa know she knew about the scheme that those heathens are about to do. She concludes that she and her sibling will be like a pig waiting to be slaughtered before those heathens try to take all their wealth. Hmm, no bloody chance. Since her grandpapa put everything under her name, she is sure her grandpapa will put blood ward or anything to make sure that anything he leaves her will follow her, even though she is transported to another world.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kalina didn’t saw the look that Charlus give to Kakashi, only the males on the Hokage room saw that, as Charlus put a silencing spell on her. “Kakashi, I approve of you. I hope you can take care of my little flower and her siblings to come. Make me proud boy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kakashi looks at the man with a wide eye but nods his head nonetheless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Those who heard it internally cry for the boy from happiness, amusement and sadness too. As they can tell the silver-haired boy is an interest with that redhead, green eye Hime. Amusement, as the boy need quite a lot of patience dealing the hime to make her notice her feelings she also interest to the boy.  </span>
</p>
<hr/><p align="center">
  <u>
    <span>Kalina Potter –  6 years old Hatake Kakashi – 8 years old</span>
  </u>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kushina, place your left hand on Minato waist the other one hold his hand, like both of you walked around and you Minato your right hand on her waist. Look at my little flower and that silver-haired boy.” Both Kushina and Minato look over Kalina and Kakashi. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The trio also looks over where Charlus point while they do the same to their wife. Meanwhile, Obito feels like he in heaven when he gets to hold Rin in his hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Charlus-Jiji. May I asked what are we going to do?” Minato looks over Charlus with a frown. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why, young one. We will dance, my little flower will show the example first. Kalina and Kakashi have done it before so all of you need to look. Right after I conjure music in the air, both will dance following the music and I will throw stinging hex to them. Don’t worry young one, it won’t hurt much," Charlus give them the sweetest smile which makes all the female blush upon seeing the smile.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile Shikaku, Inoichi and Choza flinch upon recall that stinging hex. The trio mentally screams that Charlus is a liar. They know him as sadistic bastard the training gave out the fruit, but damn that old man sure is sadistic bastard.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now, now, Shika-Ino-Cho. I will never do such a thing," </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The trio flinches, oh how can they forgot that the old man can hear them through mentally and internally cry for their misfortune, that will come to bite their own ass after this.    </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>The audience looks at Kalina and Kakashi with awe. Despite Charlus constantly throw stinging hex every single second, but not even one hex ever land on neither of them. Not only that, even when Kalina dance alone, the stinging hex not even once landed on her.  </span>
</p>
<hr/><p align="center">
  <u>
    <span>Kalina Potter – 7 years old Hatake Kakashi – 9 years old</span>
  </u>
</p><p>
  <span>Obito and Rin look over Kakashi, he looks like he was waiting for something or perhaps someone, as in the foreign girl that has become their friend. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kalina will surely be here” Minato ruffled Kakashi hair and right after he said Kalina appear in front, but she looks so tired.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry," </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kakashi shook his head before he holds out his hand, which Kalina grabbed and said a quiet thanks for helping her out. “What happens, Kalina, you look tired” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Minato caresses his brow, worried for the redhead girl. He knew her Jiji was getting weaker. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Dear Kami-sama, please help Charlus-Jiji,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Minato prays inwardly. For the first time in his life, right after he becomes an orphan, meeting Charlus had somehow mended his heart. He feels like he was a cool grandfather or an uncle.    </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Come on, that man looks like he only around forty but when he opened his mouth and revealed his real age, almost everyone floor hearing it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even Kushina thought of him as her own Jiji. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, nothing much, Minato.” Kalina took a deep breath, lord, she needs to exercise more. “I finish helping grandpapa. He bought a house in Konoha, and we finished placing necessity and books in there," </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Obito, Rin and Minato look at Kalina with wide eyes and jaw-dropping, while Kakashi eyes twinkled upon hearing that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But, I will not move there yet. Perhaps another year” And that is how Kakashi eyes turn into a damp, but he has hope that one day he will able to see Kalina, it’s alright he can be patience.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p align="center">
  <u>
    <span>Kalina Potter – 8 years old Hatake Kakashi – 10 years old</span>
  </u>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily leaned over her husband James. Seeing their older daughter with her father-in-law, melt her heart. Both can see how their daughter loved Charlus Potter and always wished to stay with him, which to be honest truly melted everyone heart. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since her mother-in-law died from dragon pox, both Lily and James could see how Charlus felt as if he was losing all of his will to live in this world and just can’t wait for the curse to act fast. But since Kalina arrived in their life, a new light came out of Charlus eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not only that, even both Lily and James somehow can’t believe on how viciously Charlus react when Kalina told him about Sirius escapade, which enough to make both Lily, James and even Remus look at Sirius with mortification. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For god’s sake, Kalina was only four years old! It doesn’t matter if she is a prodigy or not! But damn it, Sirius, she’s only four!</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>“Kalina-chan, are you alright?” Rin sits next to her foreign friend and wonders why she looks so sad. Meanwhile, Obito, Minato and Kushina stop whatever they're doing. Kakashi already knows what is happening upon how heighten his senses are. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t be able to come," </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Okay, that surely is not what Kakashi himself ever thought. What did she mean by that? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean by that, Kalina-chan? Is your Jiji didn’t give your permission anymore? Let me talked to your Jiji” Obito look over their foreign friend with a frown, while Kushina looks over Minato with worried eyes, all Minato is able to do is only shake his head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Grandpapa is getting weaker” The room becomes dead silence, upon hearing Kalina confession. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then that mean…. No, Kakashi doesn’t want to think they could not see each other again. Kakashi shook his head, unable to accept it.    </span>

</p><p>
  <span>Kalina appears right in front of Kakashi while he has a meal with Obito, Rin, Minato and Kushina with a black dress. Her hair looks more and more like a rat nest, her eyes red and puffy too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kakashi can smell depression and tears on Kalina. He didn’t need to be told twice, what happened.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone can see that Charlus is getting much weaker day by day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will be here. I will always be here” Kakashi hug her and caress her back while she silently cries on him.  </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>“Hokage-sama” Kalina bowed her head while sitting in a seiza style, just like the day she asked to join the Academy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kami-sama, what is happening and why is she bowing like this. She hardly bows like this unless something is happening. Shikaku, Inoichi, Choza, Minato and Kakashi look at her with worry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kalina-chan, please stand up. What is happening, dear?" Hiruzen asked politely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slowly Kalina looks up and looks straight to Hiruzen eyes which make him cringe on how distance her eyes. “I would like to apologise to you and everyone first” This makes everyone in the room stand straight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m unable to come here and I would like to inform you that my grandpapa has fallen. I would like to apologise as my families will face war and have to go in hiding. When the war is over, I would like to move here, in Konoha, permanently, if you still allow, Hokage-sama," Again Kalina bow her head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The occupants who are in Hokage room eyes become hard. Their precious Hime and favourite person for Kakashi have to deal a war and not only that, her family and herself have to hide too.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hiruzen sighed but then nods his head, he will keep his promise with his good friend, despite knowing each other for only a few years. But having Charlus in their life, have made them flourish and not only that, the man itself was willing to help and improve their shinobi in fighting and asking nothing in return with one exception; to take care of his grandchildren and to not let anyone try to saddle his granddaughter into an arranged marriage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Kalina-chan. But there is something I wish to ask. Are you going to use the current name or are you going to change the name like how you told us before,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kalina looks up and nods her head. “I would like to change my name and use the name I have told  you,"</span>
</p>

    <span>Kalina Potter – 10 years old Hatake Kakashi – 12 years old</span>
  </u>
</p><p>
  <span>Kalina Dorea Potter was running, running for both her and her little sister life. She is glad that her parents and godfather believe her, they should not believe Albus Dumbledore and not only that, they even gave their blessing for her to run to whatever continent she had to in order to avoid being a pig waiting for slaughter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knows it might be too late already when what she has said to them to make senses but things already happen and she also promises to her parents to protect her little sister with everything she has.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Right after her parents died, that Heathens placed both her and little Dahlia, to Petunia house, her mother older sister. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Over there, they were treated like nothing but a slave. They even placed both of her and Dahlia inside a cupboard under the stairs! Upon staying at Dursley, Kalina was willing to deal with the torture they gave to her in order to be able to learn their schedule. She needs to get out of this place, as soon as possible and when that time arrived she took her little sister and ran out from that house.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Which is now, Kalina is in an predicament. In front of her, the heathen minions are threatening her to turn around, which obviously the answer is  no.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will not return to that house! The lot of you have that heathen, he is far more powerful than that hypocrite, yet he wants us, children, to clean up his own mess! Go and bloody clean up your own mess!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Right after she said those words, they hit her with one of the unforgivable curse, the crucio! Kalina keeps on shielding her little sister with everything she got and try to not scream as she can feel as if her skin been slash with a white-hot knife and her inside feel like been rip and crush to pieces. But she failed and screams, which also cause her to start to spasm.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her grip still never waver and in haste, she holds her necklace and prays to remove herself from this world and return to Kakashi world.  </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>In Konoha, Kakashi lay on the bed in the hospital while remembering Obito and how he feels like he already failed what Obito requested of him, protect Rin. While he still looked over the ceiling, for some odd reason he feels like something dreadful is happening and not only that, he even feels his hair at the back of his neck stand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slowly he took out the necklace that Kalina has given to him and grip it so hard, wishing the girl he cares for to be here with him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Upon gripping the necklace, again something like dread creeps on him. Then he remembers what Charlus, Kalina late grandfather told him. He will feel when something happens to Kalina and not only that, Charlus even accept him too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then something inside him tugs him to get out from the hospital, which obviously he will be more than willing to do, and when he is a few feet away from the hospital, Kalina appears right in front of him, with a bundle in her arms while screaming bloody murder and start to spasm violently.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shikaku, Inoichi and Choza who were just a few feet from Kakashi saw everything and without wasting any time they ran to Kalina. Choza tries to calmed Kakashi shaken form, meanwhile, Inoichi called for ANBU and asked for them to send a message, asking Hokage-sama to come to the hospital as soon as possible, while holding Kalina little sister securely. Shikaku ran into the hospital as fast as he can, hell he will make sure his teacher granddaughter alright, just look at the girl, he knew she had been tortured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dear Kami-sama, please help them, they don’t need Charlus ghost hunting them to oblivion.</span>
