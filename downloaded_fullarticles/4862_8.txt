  <strong>Chapter 1</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>"What the <em>hell</em> are you wearing?" </p><p>To say that Kagami's face turned red was putting it lightly. The color of his face now resembled the color of his hair, which was toned deep dark red. </p><p>"My mom bought it for me," he mumbled quietly, crossing his hands in front of him as if it would block the floral shirt he was wearing from sight. </p><p>"Have I ever told you how much I love your mom?" Aomine said with a smirk. "Always finding a new way to embarrass you." </p><p>"And I thought she outdid herself last year," a feminine voice said from behind him, and Aomine didn't even need to turn around to know who it belonged to. "Remember the yellow pants with the pink snapback?" </p><p>"It was glorious," Aomine agreed with a nod. </p><p>"Oh piss off both of you," Kagami said, still as red as a tomato, "It's not my fault she has a weird fashion sense." </p><p>"It's your fault for allowing her to put you into these atrocities," Momoi said, "She must've realized by now that you're not a toddler anymore. You're supposed to be able to choose your own clothes for yourself without her help." </p><p>"I think that you're putting a bit too much faith in him," Aomine said. </p><p>"Prick." </p><p>"Idiot." </p><p>"Stop it," Momoi said with a scowl. "We haven't even stepped onto the train yet and you're already calling each other names. Jesus, you're like two overgrown kids." </p><p>"Well, he started it!" </p><p>"Great, Bakagami. <em>That</em> would show her that she's wrong." </p><p>"Train. <em>Now</em>." Momoi's words were accompanied with a glare directed pointedly at them, and with a few huffs and eyerolls from Aomine, the three of them had claimed a compartment for themselves. </p><p>"Is Himuro going to join us?" Momoi asked Kagami as Aomine placed his legs on her lap. She pinched his calf but didn't throw him off her. </p><p>Kagami made a face. "I don't know. He hadn't seen Murasakibara for a week and he said that he's going to make up for lost time, which is something that I <em>really</em> don't want to think about." </p><p>"They can make up for lost time right here. I know<em> I</em> wouldn't mind -" </p><p>"I wouldn't mind either," said Aomine. </p><p>Kagami looked at him with surprise and disgust. "Seriously?" </p><p>"Yeah. They can fuck right against this wall for all I care. As long as it makes you uncomfortable, I can deal with anything, even if it means seeing Murasakibara's dick pounding repeatedly into your brother's -" </p><p>"Holy shit, shut up shut up <em>shut up</em>!" Kagami's hands shot up to his ears, blocking Aomine's laugh and Momoi's snicker.  </p><p>"Look at him, he's scarred for life," Momoi said, affectionately ruffling Kagami's hair. Kagami shooed her away with a glare, then put his hands back in his lap. </p><p>"Can't believe you got sorted into Gryffindor," he muttered darkly, "Wonder what the Sorting Hat was on that night. You would be a great fit with the slytherins." </p><p>Aomine made a face. "Ew. Do I look like a conniving snake to you?" </p><p>"Yes." </p><p>"Fuck off. I'm a lion through and through, don't even try to suggest otherwise."  </p><p>They bickered like that for the next hour, Momoi quickly focusing on reading a book so that she won't have to listen to them. It was like that for the past four years, ever since their first year in Hogwarts, when the three of them were sorted into the Gryffindor house. It was easy for Momoi and Aomine to strike up a friendship, with Momoi keeping him in line and Aomine pushing her out of her comfort zone, making her stay outside of the common room past curfew and grabbing food from the kitchen instead of going to the Great Hall to eat. With Kagami it took a bit more time and effort; neither of them would ever admit that, but the reason it was hard for them to get along was because they were so <em>similar</em>. Both were headstrong and had a short fuse, and both were stubborn to a fault. It took several detentions and a lot of meddling by Momoi for them to become decent toward each other, and even more meddling to become friends. They still bickered nonstop, but now it held no malice in it, and it was more friendly banter than anything else. </p><p>And although Aomine would rather die than admit that he actually cares about Kagami, he could still say wholeheartedly that he'd be willing to risk his life for him.   </p><p>They arrived to the castle when the sky was pitch black, and Momoi shivered the second they stepped off the train. "I forgot how freezing it is here," she said through chattering teeth, wrapping her arms around herself for extra warmth. Aomine put his arm around her to radiate his warmth on her. </p><p>"Can't believe you both are prefects now," Aomine muttered, annoyed. "Now I'll have to walk alone to the dormitories like a sad little fuck." </p><p>"You can join us," Kagami offered kindly, "Help us show the first years around like a good little helper." </p><p>Aomine snorted. "I'd rather be a sad little fuck than a good little helper, thanks." </p><p>Kagami shrugged. "Suit yourself." </p><p>"You know, I'm glad that I'm a prefect this year," Momoi said as the three of them sat down at the Gryffindor table, "I like having the added responsibility. And it would look great on my resume." </p><p>"Why are we friends again?" Aomine asked.  </p><p>"Because you love me." </p><p>"That's not it, no." </p><p>"Because I let you copy my Potions homework." </p><p>"Yeah, that sounds more like it." </p><p>Momoi smiled and looked over at the Ravenclaw table. "Oh look, here's Himuro next to Riko." </p><p>Aomine hummed thoughtfully. "Looking properly fucked if you ask me." </p><p>"Well, it's a good thing that no one's asking you, then," Kagami said with an annoyed huff.  </p><p>It wasn't long before the talking in the room simmered down to an expectant buzz, the students either excited for the Sorting or excited for the food. </p><p>Kagami was definitely excited for the food. "Hope they get a move on, I'm <em>starving</em>." </p><p>As if they heard him, the doors to the Great Hall slowly opened, revealing Professor McGonagall and a bunch of tiny kids behind her.  </p><p>"They're so cute," Momoi cooed from her place next to Aomine. "Look at those big eyes, they look so awestruck." </p><p>"Wonder who's going to be in Gryffindor," Kagami said. "I bet I can guess before they get Sorted." </p><p>Aomine snorted quietly. "Bet I could guess right more than you." </p><p>"You're on." </p><p>They were both a bit hopeless with it, honestly, none of them able to guess correctly more than three times, but it was at least entertaining. The best part was when Kagami got one right, a little girl with pigtails who got sorted into Ravenclaw, and he shot up from his seat screaming, "That's right, I knew it, Ravenclaw for the way!", earning him a few unimpressed looks from his fellow gryffindors. </p><p>"<em>'</em><em>Ravenclaw</em><em> for the way'</em>," muttered a seventh year boy sitting opposite Aomine with a roll of his eyes, "Guess the Gryffindor's pride is a thing of the past now." </p><p>A few minutes later it was the turn of a little kid with a mop of blond hair on his head. </p><p>"This one is easy," Kagami said. "He's from the Kise family. They've been Sorted into Slytherin since forever. Ancient pureblood family." </p><p>The boy gingerly sat down at the edge of his seat, his deep brown eyes looking at the hat nervously before it was placed on his head, obstructing the bright yellow hair from view. The kid seemed to frown, shook his head at something the hat said to him. In the end, the hat opened its mouth and shouted, "-<em>Gryffindor</em>!" </p><p>The hall was completely silent.  </p><p>The boy took the hat off his head, looking close to tears, and turned to look at McGonagall behind him. He asked her something quietly, to which she shook her head in response, a sad look on her face.  </p><p>"Poor boy," Momoi said sadly, "No one even cheers for him -" </p><p>"<em>WOO!</em> Way to go, Shinji, good job!" </p><p>All eyes turned to the Slytherin table, where a guy with similar blond hair and fair skin was standing and cheering, clapping his hands loudly and enthusiastically as if to compensate for the rest of the students lack of enthusiasm. </p><p>"Who is he?" Aomine asked with a raised eyebrow.  </p><p>"His brother," Kagami replied quickly. "He's a fourth year here. Ryouta, I think his name is." </p><p>The little boy's eyes quickly turned to his brother, giving him a terrified look. Aomine didn't blame him, to be honest - the ancient pureblooded families were not known for their forward thinking. They would be pissed at him for not being sorted into Slytherin, that much was clear to everyone.  </p><p>Aomine turned to look at the older brother again, who was still standing, still smiling brightly at his brother, trying to comfort him. <em>'It's okay',</em> the older boy mouthed to him, then gestured with a smile at the Gryffindor table. The little boy nodded his head slightly and rose from the stool he was sitting on, taking hesitant steps toward the Gryffindor table. The older Kise started clapping again, but now he was joined in by the rest of the Gryffindor table, who seemed to have moved on from their momentarily shock and confusion. One boy even clapped the young blond on the shoulder, as if welcoming him to the house. </p><p>"That was brave," Momoi said, still looking at the older brother who was now sitting again at his table, ignoring the looks from the other slytherins. "Most ancient families wouldn't blatantly support a member of their being Sorted into the rival house." </p><p>Kagami nodded his head, his eyes also still trained on the blond slytherin.  </p><p>Aomine just shrugged his shoulders. "Whatever," he said simply, then pointed at the young boy now walking up to the stool, "I bet you this one is a Hufflepuff." </p><p>The Sorting ended ten minutes later without any farther occurrences, and after the Headmaster said his greetings and laid out the school rules in favor of the new first years, the feast begun, food magically appearing out of thin air on the tables. </p><p>"Finally," muttered Kagami while grabbing the nearest plate filled with hot wings and emptying almost half of its content into his own plate. </p><p>"You guys are animals, did you know that?" Momoi told both Kagami and Aomine, scrunching up her nose in distaste at the sight of them practically inhaling food. Aomine didn't even dignified the statement with a response, simply choosing to give her the bird while swallowing a chunk of meat.  </p><p>Aomine stretched back in his seat a while later, feeling satiated at last, and let out a loud burp. </p><p>Momoi slapped his arm. "You're disgusting." </p><p>"You're disgusting," he replied, too full to think of a better comeback. </p><p>Momoi rolled her eyes and got up. "C'mon, Kagami. We need to take the first years back to the dormitories." </p><p>Kagami blinked back at her, his head resting on the table. "I think I ate more than I weigh." </p><p>Momoi kicked him. "Tough." She then walked off to the group of first years, gesturing for the girls to follow her lead. </p><p>Kagami grumbled annoyedly as he rose from his seat, making Aomine snort contently. "Thank fuck I'm not a prefect. I almost feel sorry for you." </p><p>"As if anyone in their right mind would appoint <em>you</em> as a prefect." </p><p>"What does that suppose to mean?" </p><p>"There are standards -" </p><p>"Excuse me, are you the Gryffindor prefect?" </p><p>The two of them turned their heads to look at the person disturbing their argument, Aomine immediately recognizing the blond hair and the blinding smile. </p><p>It took Kagami a few moments to reply, "Yeah, I'm - yeah." </p><p>The guy - Kise - smiled even brighter, if that was possible. "Great. Do you think I can maybe borrow him for a while?" He gestured at someone next to him. Aomine didn't even have to look to know it was his brother. </p><p>Kagami frowned. "I'm not sure -" </p><p>"I'll bring him to the Gryffindor common room myself," Kise promised quickly, "I know my way around the castle, don't worry. He won't get lost." </p><p>"I'm not... I'm not worried." God, Aomine thought to himself, it seems like all the food got right to Kagami's head, making him even stupider than usual. He could barely form a sentence. </p><p>Kise didn't seem to think the same thing as Aomine, and just put his hand around his brother's shoulder. "Great, so we'll go." </p><p>"Wait!" Kagami said before they even had a chance to turn around. He flushed under the questioning look on Kise's face, then mumbled, "He - I need to tell him the password." </p><p>Kise blinked. "Oh. Right. I forgot, sorry." He chuckled then. "You probably don't want to say it around my Slytherin ears, ah? Don't worry, I won't listen."  </p><p>He then proceeded by placing both his palms on his ears, blocking the sound.  </p><p>Aomine raised an eyebrow at that, looking back at Kagami to convey to him how ridiculous he thinks this guy is, but Kagami just smiled slightly at the sight, his cheeks still a bit pink, and told the boy the password in a quiet voice. </p><p>Kise removed his hands from his ears when his brother turned to look at him again, grabbing his robe tightly in his hands. "Thanks," he said to Kagami, smiling at him once again, before leaving the room with his brother in tow. </p><p>Kagami exhaled quietly and turned his head, noticing the smug look on Aomine's face. </p><p>"What?" He said stiffly. </p><p>"Nothing," Aomine replied with a shrug, getting up from his seat. "But just so you know, I won't be attending your wedding if you're going to marry a Slytherin." </p><p>Kagami flushed deeply. "Shut up!" </p><p>"I hope for your sake that your kids will get his eyebrows, because if they'll get stuck with yours -" </p><p>"Seriously, Aomine, shut up," he said hurriedly, looking around him. He then turned to Aomine again. Said with a quiet tone, "Was I that obvious?" </p><p>Aomine raised an eyebrow. "I don't know. I mean, I don't think he noticed, but I don't know him." </p><p>Kagami rubbed a hand over his face. "I was just caught off-guard, you know? He's... fuck, he's so <em>pretty</em>." </p><p>Aomine smirked. "Are you enamored? Is that what you look like when you're <em>enamored</em>?" </p><p>"Fuck off." </p><p>Aomine laughed loudly, then put a hand on Kagami's shoulder. "I don't think you were that obvious, alright? I just noticed it because I know you too well. Unfortunately." </p><p>Kagami seemed slightly relieved by that, nodding his head. Aomine removed his hand from Kagami's shoulder, but not before pinching him lightly. "I think two of your first years fell asleep waiting for you. Go do your goddamn job, you unprofessional prefect." </p><p>  </p><p align="center">
  <strong>~oOo~ </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>The next morning Aomine, Momoi and Kagami sat down at the Gryffindor table, and were shortly joined by Murasakibara, his hair in a ponytail, a lollipop in his mouth and a big, purple lovebite on his neck. </p><p>Aomine snickered. "Nice hickey, Murasakibara." </p><p>Murasakibara continued licking the lollipop, nodding to Aomine in acknowledgment.  </p><p>Kagami, who hadn't noticed it before, glanced at Murasakibara's neck quickly and then grimaced, returning in a hurry to his breakfast.  </p><p>Momoi examined his neck as well. "I always thought that Himuro would be a very gentle lover. Maybe I was wrong." </p><p>Kagami grimaced again. "Seriously, I'm trying to eat here, and I'd prefer it if you won't talk about my brother doing stuff. Okay?" </p><p>After a few moments of silence from the other three, Kagami returned to his food with a satisfied look. </p><p>Not a second later Himuro appeared. "Nicely done, Himuro! How long did it take you to suck that hickey?" </p><p>Kagami knocked his head on the table in exasperation. </p><p>Himuro looked at Aomine, then at Murasakibara. "Oh, it didn't take that long. His skin bruises so quickly from just a bit of sucking, you should see his di-" </p><p>"<em>No</em>!" Kagami shouted, horrified, pointing his fork at Himuro. "Not talking about it, not now, not ever!" </p><p>Himuro smirked. "Alright, alright." He then took out of his pocket a few papers, offering one to each of them. "I grabbed us the timetables of this year. Gryffindor is with Slytherin in most of the classes." </p><p>Aomine grabbed his timetable in anger. "What the fuck - we've got Potions, Care of Magical Creatures, Defense Against the Dark Arts <em>and</em> Transfiguration with the Slytherins! Who's in charge of this crap?" </p><p>Momoi rolled her eyes. "You're too dramatic, Aomine. Who even cares?" </p><p>"Yeah, Aomine, not all slytherins are bad," Kagami agreed. </p><p>Aomine looked at him with narrowed eyes. "Just because you want to suck some Slytherin dick doesn't mean that we all want to." </p><p>"What?" Himuro said quickly, raising his eyes from his own timetable to look at Kagami searchingly. "Who's dick do you want to suck?" </p><p>"No one's!" Kagami said quickly while simultaneously kicking Aomine in the shin.  </p><p>"You're blushing," Momoi said in a pleased tone, "Why are you blushing, Kagami?" </p><p>"I'm not blushing, that's the color of my face," he said defensively. </p><p>"You're so full of shit, Bakagami," Aomine said delightedly. "You should've seen him yesterday, stuttering like a twelve year old girl with a crush -" </p><p>"I did not <em>stutter</em> -" </p><p>"- practically begging him with his eyes to take off his pants -" </p><p>"- that's not what happened, seriously, shut up -" </p><p>"Who was it then?" Himuro interrupted impatiently. </p><p>Aomine smirked. "Kise. The blond one." </p><p>"Oh, Kise Ryouta?" Himuro asked. </p><p>Kagami looked at him with wide eyes. "You know him?" </p><p>"I know <em>of</em> him. He's a good friend of Takao, the one who's always harassing Midorima. He seems nice. I give you my blessing." </p><p>Kagami huffed. "I don't <em>need</em> your blessing, I'm not trying to... to <em>seduce</em> him or anything." </p><p>"I think you should," Momoi said. "You'd look cute together." </p><p>Aomine snorted. "No they wouldn't. It's still Kagami we're talking about, 'cute' does not apply to him." </p><p>"C'mon, Kagami," Momoi said, ignoring Aomine, "Do you think he's good looking?" </p><p>Kagami's cheeks turned pink again. "Yeah. I mean, I have eyes." </p><p>"And do you want to get to know him better?"  </p><p>"He - he seems like he'd be interesting to talk to, I guess." </p><p>"So why not go for it?" </p><p>"Because, I -" Kagami stopped himself, shaking his head as if to get rid of a thought. "No. Forget it. I don't want a relationship, alright?" </p><p>"But -" </p><p>"I just want to focus on Quidditch this year. Nothing more, nothing less. Okay?" </p><p>Momoi made a face. "Yeah, okay. If that's what you want. But if you change your mind, you know we would all help you with getting him, right?" </p><p>Kagami smiled slightly at that. "Thanks. I know." </p><p>Murasakibara put the lollipop stick on the table. Himuro took one look at the stick and stood up, offering his hand to his boyfriend. "Come on, Atsushi, we'll find you something else to lick." </p><p>Kagami's smile was quickly wiped off his face. "Oh for crying out loud..." </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>~oOo~</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>September quickly turned into October turned into November, and before any of them knew it it was already a week before Christmas. To Aomine, the time-off couldn't had come in a better time - he had a shit ton of homework he had to get to, which was almost impossible for him to do with the amount of Quidditch practices he had. Their new Captain, a seventh year named Eddie, was fanatic with his attitude, ordering the entire team to get to the pitch five nights out of seven, and every other weekend making them get up before sunrise to get some extra practice without the prying eyes of the other Quidditch teams. </p><p>And Aomine loved Quidditch. He lived for Quidditch, he breathed Quidditch. Ever since he was a four year old kid and his dad bought him his first toy broom. But even <em>he</em> wouldn't choose to get up at ass o'clock in the morning voluntarily to fly around on a broom. </p><p>"He's insane," he complained to Kagami after another grueling early-morning practice. They were walking up to the castle from the pitch, their outfit covered in mud and sweat and Aomine never wanted a shower more in his life. "Absolutely gone bonkers."  </p><p>"I think he's just passionate," Kagami said, brushing dirt off his broom in concentration. </p><p>"I think you're bonkers, too." </p><p>"No, I'm just not as pessimistic as you are," Kagami said. "He obviously knows what he'd doing. We won our match against Ravenclaw." </p><p>"We could've won regardless of our training routine. Ravenclaw sucks." He watched with a smile as Midorima Shintaro, a fellow 5th year student from Ravenclaw who was passing by them, looked at him in a mixture of disgust and superiority. </p><p>"Well, we also have a match against Slytherin soon, and their team is pretty good," Kagami said, still eyeing his broom for any lingering dirt. </p><p>Aomine rolled his eyes. "Don't ever say that sentence to me again. I don't want to give the slytherins even something resembling of a praise." </p><p>"I'm not praising them, I'm just saying. You really need to let go of your resentment." </p><p>"Shut up, I don't need to do anything," Aomine grumbled. </p><p>Kagami just hummed in response, finally deeming his broom clean enough and looking up at Aomine. "My parents are flying to South America in the holidays." </p><p>Aomine raised an eyebrow. "I'm very happy for them?" </p><p>Kagami shook his head. "I mean, that they're not going to be home for Christmas, so I have to stay at Hogwarts." </p><p>"Ah. Well, that sucks mate." </p><p>"Stay with me?" </p><p>Aomine couldn't help but laugh loudly at that. "Fuck no, man." </p><p>"Why not?" Kagami asked, frowning. "C'mon, I don't want to stay here all by myself, and it would be fun!" </p><p>"Himuro is your half brother, won't he have to stay here just like you?" </p><p>"He's going to Murasakibara." </p><p>"Ah." Fuck. "Well, what about Momoi?" </p><p>"Already asked her and she can't. She has a new cousin and the whole family is going to go over and visit him and she was really looking forward to it." </p><p>"Fuck, why don't you have more friends?" Aomine ran a hand through his hair. It wasn't like he was looking forward to spending time at home with his family or anything, but he also didn't like the idea of spending his free time on school grounds. But Kagami looked damn upset about staying here alone, and Aomine wasn't that cruel that he'd abandon his friend like that. </p><p>He couldn't actually say something like that to him though, couldn't let Kagami know that he actually <em>cares</em>, so instead he sighed in vexation and said, "You <em>so</em> owe me." </p><p>Kagami looked both surprised and pleased. "I didn't think you'd actually agree." </p><p>"Well, Christmas with the family is just about as boring as watching paint dry," Aomine said simply, "So don't look so smug. It's got nothing to do with you and everything to do with me." </p><p>"Yeah yeah, you big softie," Kagami said with a laugh, and Aomine scowled back at him. </p><p>"Don't make me regret this, Bakagami." </p><p>"I wouldn't dream of it, Ahomine."</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>~oOo~</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Aomine spent the entire first day of Christmas either sleeping or doing homework, to the disappointment of Kagami. </p><p>"It's a holiday," he complained to Aomine while sitting on his bed opposite of his in their dormitory, "We should do something fun, not stay inside all day." </p><p>"Then go do whatever," Aomine suggested without taking his eyes off his parchment, "Grab something to eat from the kitchen, have a walk outside. Go and have a swim with the Giant Squid for all I care. Just stop harassing me, I'm trying to concentrate." </p><p>Kagami lied grumpily down on his mattress. "Who would've thought you'd be the responsible one and do your homework on the first day of the holiday." </p><p>"I've always been the responsible one." </p><p>Kagami snorted. "Yeah, okay." He then turned to his backpack and grabbed his books, a few parchments and a quill. "Can't believe I'm doing my homework because of you. You were supposed to stay here to keep me entertained." </p><p>"As much as you'd like to believe it, keeping you entertained isn't my sole purpose in life." </p><p>"Don't be ridiculous," Kagami said with a smile. "But tomorrow we're having a one-on-one. I'm not gonna be holed up in this room for the duration of the holiday." </p><p>"Whatever," Aomine replied, though inside he was pleased. It had been a while since their last one-on-one match, what with all the schoolwork and team practices. And although playing with Kagami on the same team was fun, it was even better playing against him. He was his biggest rival, with similar abilities to him and his dedication to the sport was on par with his own.  </p><p>He enjoyed their one-on-ones more than most things in his life. </p><p>So the next day, they were both headed to the quidditch pitch, throwing teasing jabs at each other and friendly insults. They were the only quidditch players staying at school for the holiday and weren't expecting anyone to occupy the pitch, but as they got closer to the field they could see a lone figure, flying around and throwing a small ball through the hoops.  </p><p>Aomine narrowed his eyes at the person, unable to see who it was due to the harsh light of the sun. "Who the hell is this?" </p><p>Kagami was also narrowing his eyes, his hand resting on his forehead in order to shield his eyes from the sun. "Dunno. It's hard to see clearly from here." </p><p>"Well, they need to get lost," Aomine said while walking closer to the field. He put his hands around his mouth and shouted, "Hey, kid! Get down here, stop fucking around!" </p><p>The figure stopped in the air, apparently hearing him, then started to descend down. All it took was Kagami's sharp inhale for Aomine to know exactly who the mystery person was, and soon enough he was greeted with the smiling face of Kise Ryouta. </p><p>"Hello!" the guy said cheerfully, leaning slightly on his broom. It seemed like he had been here for a while; a few beads of sweat were at his hairline, and he was a bit out of breath. </p><p>Aomine ignored Kagami's pathetic little stutter of a greeting, ("H-hi"), and instead said, "We're going to use the pitch now, so you can just leave." </p><p>Kise's smiling face turned into a frown. "I was here first," he argued. </p><p>"Do I look like I care?" Aomine asked with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>"Aomine!" Kagami said in a hushed tone, "Stop being such an ass!" </p><p>Kise's frown deepened farther. "Who do you even think you are?" he said. "You don't own the pitch." </p><p>The Slytherin had a backbone, Aomine had to hand it to him. "You're not even a quidditch player. You shouldn't even be here." </p><p>"You don't have to be a quidditch player to be here," Kise said.  </p><p>Aomine was already over this conversation. "Just piss off already and stop making a fuss." </p><p>There was a glint of anger in Kise's eyes, but it was quickly gone in the next second. He then smiled a wide, sweet, completely fake smile. </p><p>"I was thinking about leaving just a bit before you got here," he said, the smile still stretched across his face. "But it's such a nice day out. I might just stay here until the evening." </p><p>Aomine glared at him. "You spiteful Slytherin." </p><p>"Was that supposed to be insulting? Because it sounds like a compliment to me." </p><p>"Only a true slimy Slytherin would take that as a compliment -" </p><p>"That's enough, Aomine!" Kagami said loudly, glaring at Aomine. "He didn't do anything to you, what is your problem?" </p><p>Aomine rolled his eyes at Kagami's face. "Stay out of it." </p><p>"No, seriously Aomine, you don't have to be such an ass all the time." </p><p>Aomine looked back at his friend, fuming. Was he really going to take this stranger kid's side over his, just because he might or might not want to bang him? </p><p>It took Aomine a few moments to collect himself, and in the end he just shrugged. Said, "Whatever. Play with the Slytherin boy for all I care. I'm going to sleep." He turned around and left then, fully expecting Kagami to be right behind him. </p><p>Halfway to the castle he realized that Kagami wasn't walking with him, and instead chose to stay behind with the blond. </p><p>Aomine tried to not let it get to him, but he couldn't help but feel slightly betrayed by the whole thing. He knew that he had a short fuse, and he knew that he might have overreacted down there with Kise. But Kagami shouldn't have stayed behind. He was supposed to follow Aomine back to their room and get annoyed with him for how he acted, and then forget about the whole thing by nightfall.  </p><p>He shouldn't have stayed behind with Kise.  </p><p>Aomine had spent the rest of the afternoon fuming in his room, reading quidditch magazines half-heartedly and trying without success to take a nap. He was still expecting Kagami to walk in any minute now, but as evening came along he came to the realization that Kagami wasn't going to show up. With an annoyed sigh he rolled out of bed, deciding that he should just go to dinner and forget about his so-called 'friend'. </p><p>The Great Hall looked great on Christmas; there was fake snow everywhere, big oak trees shining with sparkling red, gold and blue lights, and golden candles floated around the room, giving the whole place a warm, cozy feeling to it. Aomine had never spent a holiday at the castle before, and quite frankly, he was impressed. </p><p>It was still a bit early and not everyone showed up to dinner yet; only about a handful of kids were already seated at the large table. Since there was such a small amount of people staying in, there wasn't much of a reason to eat in separate tables, and Aomine could see students from Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw sitting together comfortably. There weren't a lot of Slytherins staying at Hogwarts during the holiday usually, since their families liked to keep up appearance as a united front. It wouldn't look too good if their kids were staying at school and not spending time with their families, attending as many social events as possible.  </p><p>Aomine sat down alone in the middle of the table, looking at the other students in boredom. He didn't recognize any of them, most of the kids belonging to younger years. He recognized Kise's brother sitting at the edge of the table with a friend of his, laughing quietly at something that she said.  </p><p>It took the kid a while to get used to being in Gryffindor. His parents didn't approve whatsoever, and Aomine heard from Kagami that they had sent the headmaster a letter of complaint, demanding him to put their youngest son into Slytherin, where he belongs, and getting absolutely furious after he flat out refused to do so. His parents weren't the only ones giving him problems for his Sorting. A few of the Slytherin first years, who he probably knew since he was a baby, called him a traitor and other derogatory names, made fun on him and mocked his 'pathetic Gryffindor heart'. As if being a Gryffindor was something to be ashamed of. </p><p>The only reason Aomine knew so much about the first year was because of Kagami, who was really upset by the whole thing. Coming from a pureblooded family himself, though a less pretentious one, he knew all about the struggle of pleasing your parents and going in their footsteps. "It just sucks that he has to go through it," he had told Aomine on the first week of school, after he took points off of some kids who ridiculed the blond kid. "He gets bullshit from home and from here, and it's just like he doesn't belong anywhere. He's not completely accepted into Gryffindor yet, and he's definitely not going to be accepted by the Slytherins. So he's kind of in between. It really sucks." </p><p>Now, it seemed like the kid was finally accepted into Gryffindor. He looked less gloomy and more vibrant, resembling his brother a little bit more with each passing day. He wasn't as bright as him yet, but he was getting there. </p><p>That said brother walked into the Great Hall not a minute later, with a smiling Kagami at his side. The sight of them laughing together made Aomine scowl deeply, and he averted his eyes to not look at them anymore. </p><p>A few seconds later he felt someone sliding into the seat next to him, smelling of sweat and grass and mud. </p><p>"Had fun with your little boyfriend?" Aomine asked, trying to keep his voice leveled. </p><p>"Not my boyfriend," Kagami replied instantly, "And yeah. It was fun." </p><p>Aomine couldn't help but roll his eyes. "Great." </p><p>Kagami hesitated for a moment. Then said, "You should've stayed, you know. You didn't have to go." </p><p>"I prefer not being a third wheel, thanks." </p><p>"Fuck, Aomine, it's not like that," Kagami insisted, blushing furiously. "We had a one-on-one." </p><p>Aomine raised his eyebrows at that. "So, you preferred to have a one-on-one with a fourth year loser than with me?"  </p><p>"Jealous?" Kagami smirked. </p><p>"Hardly. Surprised is more like it." </p><p>"He's really good," Kagami said. "I didn't expect him to be this good. He's better than all of the other Slytherin chasers combined." </p><p>Aomine raised a skeptical eyebrow at that. "Oh please. You were probably too busy ogling him than actually playing. Of course you thought he was good." </p><p>"I didn't ogle him," Kagami insisted. "He's seriously good. You should play against him, you'll see." </p><p>"He's not worth my time," Aomine replied in a haughty tone. "And if he's so good then why isn't he on the team?" </p><p>"He said that he doesn't feel too passionate about the sport to be on the team," Kagami said with a shake of his head, as if not able to comprehend how someone can say something like that. "But if he actually tried out to the team, he would make it for sure." </p><p>"I think you're full of shit, mate." </p><p>Kagami shrugged. "Don't believe me. I'm saying the truth though." </p><p>"Whatever," Aomine said. Then, "So you'd spent all those hours just flying around like a knob with the blond kid?" </p><p>"He's not a kid, he's barely a year younger than us," Kagami said. "And we talked for a bit. Did you know that he's the only Slytherin staying here this week?" </p><p>"Really? How terrible," Aomine said in boredom. </p><p>"Yeah, he only stayed because of Shinji," Kagami said. "Their parents didn't allow him to come home this holiday. Told him it was because he disgraced them and that he needed time to reflect." </p><p>Aomine frowned. "That's bullshit. What does he even have to reflect on? He didn't purposely chose to get sorted into this house." </p><p>Kagami nodded. "Kise said that he cried about it the entire day after getting their letter. Said that he felt ashamed for letting them down." Kagami glanced at the end of the table, where the two siblings were sitting together with a few other students, the older blond in the middle of recounting a story to the rest of the group, all of them listening intently. His charisma was obvious, and it was also clear that he loved being the center of attention, thrived on it by the looks of it.  </p><p>Aomine turned his eyes away from him.  </p><p>"He shouldn't be ashamed of it," Aomine told Kagami. "He should be proud. Being a Gryffindor means that he's brave, and a Gryffindor in a house full of Slytherins just means that he's even braver than most." </p><p>Kagami looked at him funnily after he finished speaking, which made his cheeks flush slightly. "Why are you looking at me like that, moron?" </p><p>Kagami shook his head. "It's nothing, it's just... that's exactly what Kise told him." </p><p>Aomine ran a hand through his hair. Said, "Well, the kid has a way with words then." </p><p>"You shouldn't be so harsh toward him," Kagami said. "I know that you hate the Slytherins, but I think that you'd get along well if you just gave him a chance." </p><p>"Look, Kagami, I know that you want your friend and your future husband to get along. I get it. But forget it. I have a big enough group of friends as it is, and I'm not looking to expand it." </p><p>"You're like an old man, I swear to god," Kagami said. </p><p>"Whatever you say," Aomine said at the same moment that food appeared on the table. "Now pass me the chicken, you big oaf."</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>~oOo~</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>Aomine had spent the next day uncharacteristically holed up in the library, finishing up his homework for all of his classes. The demands this year were much higher than he expected them to be, and he had to be on top of things if he wanted to have a successful Quidditch year. It would be almost impossible to concentrate on both Quidditch and schoolwork, especially with their O.W.L.S coming up at the end of the year. He had to take responsibility and study, despite his desire to just spend the entire holiday sleeping. </p><p>He got back to the common room when it got dark outside, his head pounding from the excessive thinking, and the first thing he noticed when he walked inside was Kagami, sitting at one of the comfortable armchairs next to the fireplace, laughing loudly. </p><p>The second thing he noticed was two first years, one blond and the other brunette, sitting cross-legged on the floor. </p><p>The third thing he noticed was a blond boy with a green-and-silver tie, talking animatedly to the three of them, wild hand gestures and all. </p><p>A part of him wanted to ignore them and go to sleep. A part of him wanted to interrupt them. </p><p>He was about to make a quiet escape to his room when Kagami's eyes landed on him. "Here's the dork! Did you enjoy studying on your free time?" </p><p>The three other heads turned to him immediately. He ignored them and turned to sit at a vacant chair next to them. He said, "I'd punch you but I'm too tired." </p><p>Kagami smiled. "You must be exhausted then. You never pass on a chance to punch anyone." </p><p>Aomine flipped him off and turned to look at the blond sitting opposite him. "Don't you have a common room of your own to sit in?" </p><p>Kise's face was blank when he looked back at him. "It's too quiet," he said simply. "I like being in loud places." </p><p>"We were there before," Kise's brother, Shinji, said excitedly. "I've never been there before today, it's so cool! The Giant Squid was right outside the window, and he knocked on it with his tentacle like he wanted us to look at him!" </p><p>Kise's previously blank face quickly morphed into exasperation. "For the last time, Shinji, he didn't knock on it <em>purposely</em>. It was obviously just an accidental noise, you're way too excited about it." </p><p>"You're just jealous because I have a better friendship with him than you do." </p><p>"Why would I want to be friends with a <em>squid</em>?" </p><p>"Who wouldn't want to be friends with a squid?" </p><p>"<em>I</em> want to be friends with a squid," Shinji's brunette friend piped up loyally.  </p><p>Shinji looked at his brother in victory. "See?" </p><p>"All I see is that you found a friend as weird as you," Kise replied, though not unkindly. </p><p>Shinji got up from his position on the floor, his friend doing the same instantly. "You're so mean that you drive everyone away," he said, the corners of his mouth twitching slightly as if he was trying hard not to smile. "I'll leave you here to ponder over what you said. See you later when you're ready to apologize." And with that, he turned and made his way to the stairs with his friend in toe. </p><p>Kise rolled his eyes, smiling widely. "So dramatic," he said. </p><p>"You love it though," Kagami reasoned. </p><p>"Yes," Kise agreed. "Yes I do."</p><p>The three of them continued to sit there for the next half hour, the conversation between Kise and Kagami flowing easily. Aomine opted to just look at them conversing without contributing, figuring that it would be better if he just let Kagami try and flirt with the blond with no interruption. He saw Kagami's eyes light up whenever Kise laughed at something he said, could see his leg twitching whenever Kise revealed new information about himself. It was sickening to a degree, to see his friend so invested in this boy, who seemed completely oblivious about it. </p><p>Aomine couldn't understand how Kise didn't notice it, but maybe he was denser than he initially thought. </p><p>Eventually they started talking about Quidditch, and Aomine almost snorted when Kise said that when he was young he was the fastest boy on a broom and that everyone he knew told him that he'd be a professional player one day. </p><p>He did snort unintentionally when he said that he stopped playing because it wasn't 'challenging' enough for him. </p><p>Kise raised an eyebrow at him. "What?" </p><p>Aomine just shook his head. "Nothing." </p><p>"You snorted." </p><p>"How observant of you." </p><p>"Do you care to explain <em>why</em>?" </p><p>"Because," Aomine explained patiently, ignoring Kagami's pleading look, "You're so full of yourself that it's funny. Tell me, how many people did your rich dad had to pay to lose to you?" </p><p>Kise couldn't hide his vexation anymore, a frown appearing on his face. Aomine preferred this much better than the blank look he always wore around him. "Just because I'm rich it doesn't mean that I get everything handed to me. You don't know anything about me, so stop acting like you do." </p><p>Aomine shrugged. Said, "Whatever you say, pretty boy." </p><p>Kise huffed loudly, then rose from his seat. "Get up," he said to Aomine in irritation.  </p><p>Aomine smirked. "Are you going to fight me?" He didn't get up. </p><p>"We're going to have a match," Kise explained, his voice still thick with anger.  </p><p>Aomine looked at him in surprise. "What makes you think I'd want to have a match against you?" </p><p>"Are you scared?" </p><p>Aomine rolled his eyes. "Don't be an idiot. I've got nothing to prove to you anyway. Everyone here already knows that I'm the best quidditch player in this school." </p><p>"And you think that <em>I'm</em> full of myself?" </p><p>"I've earned the right to be full of myself by being far superior to everyone else," Aomine said, but got up from his seat nonetheless. "But whatever. Let's see how shitty you are on a broom, oh mighty you." He looked at the window next to him, then sat down again. </p><p>"What are you doing?" Kise asked in surprise, already prepared to go out and get his broom.</p><p>"Unlike you, I'm not a complete moron," Aomine said simply. "We'll compete tomorrow, when it's not dark outside and we can actually see. Now go away; it's bad luck to see your competition a day before a match."</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>~oOo~</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Aomine hated being proven wrong. </p><p>To say that he underestimated Kise's abilities would be an understatement. He thought that the blond was ridiculous for challenging him like that, and was certain that the match would be done in a matter of minutes at the very most. </p><p>He was wrong. It was both exciting and annoying. </p><p>The rules were simple: both of them had three hoops to guard at opposite sides of the field, and the first to score ten points wins. There were no Snitch and no Bludger, just the Quaffle they had to worry about. </p><p>The beginning was just like Aomine imagined it; he had already gained three easy points, performing difficult and complicated maneuvers on his broom, while Kise just stuck to some standard moves, not blowing him away in the least. </p><p>Aomine laughed loudly. "C'mon, blondie. You're all big talk and no action! I'm almost disappointed." </p><p>"Don't worry about me, Aomine," Kise shouted back, not looking too flustered by his underwhelming performance. "Just getting warmed up." </p><p>A few seconds later Kise got the ball and flew straight to Aomine's hoops. Aomine was ready to easily defend them, when Kise suddenly dropped with his broom and - </p><p>...made the exact same move Aomine did just a minute ago. </p><p>It took Aomine a long time to perform this move perfectly. It only took a minute for Kise to do it just as good as him. </p><p>Aomine couldn't help but gape at him, mouth open and everything. "The fuck was that?" He asked loudly, still unable to comprehend what just happened. </p><p>Kise smirked, his golden eyes glinting in the sun. "I'm a fast learner," was all he said in response. </p><p>Aomine could feel the adrenaline pulsing through his veins, an excitement he hadn't felt in a long time taking place instead of the boredom he felt before. "Alright, you shithead," he said, no malice behind his words, "I won't go easy on you anymore." </p><p>Kise smirked back at him. "As if I'd want you to." </p><p>It was a long match, neither of them wanting to let the other win, and Aomine was having <em>fun</em>. He was enjoying how he could give one hundred percent without worrying about his opponent not being able to keep up with him, and he was enjoying how Kise refused to give up, even when Aomine only had to score one more point to win and he had to score four more. He enjoyed it more than he enjoyed playing against Kagami, and he didn't really understand why exactly - Kagami was just as tough and just as unrelenting - but it was different somehow. Better. </p><p>Aomine didn't try to think why.  </p><p>In the end Aomine won, ten to seven, and both he and Kise flew back to the ground. Kise's legs gave up underneath him the moment he hit the ground, and he lied down on the grass, breathing harshly. </p><p>Aomine followed his lead and lied down on the ground. His breathing was less erratic than Kise's, but he was still just as exhausted. </p><p>That's why he was surprised when he heard Kise say through heavy breaths, "Let's play again." </p><p>"Are you insane?" Aomine asked, glad that his voice didn't quiver as much as Kise's. "You can barely even breath properly." </p><p>"But I want to play again!" he insisted, and Aomine turned his head to look at him. He looked flushed from the effort, his forehead glistening with sweat, and his hair was in disarray from the wind blowing in it. He looked so far from the immaculately perfect boy he usually was, and Aomine couldn't help but think that this suited him better, somehow. </p><p>"I already beat you once, do you really want a repeat so soon?" Aomine asked. </p><p>"I would beat you next time," Kise said confidently.  </p><p>"Oh really?" </p><p>"Yes," he promised. "I'm gonna be your worst nightmare, Aominecchi." </p><p>Aomine raised an eyebrow. "The fuck did you just call me?" </p><p>"Aominecchi," Kise repeated. "I add '-cchi' to the names of the people I respect." </p><p>Aomine was confused. "And you respect me?" </p><p>Kise nodded. "Don't get me wrong, your personality sucks," he said, "But you are good at Quidditch. I have to respect you for that." </p><p>Aomine snorted. "Geez, thank you." </p><p>"You're welcome," Kise said graciously. He then moved into a sitting position, his breathing finally in control. "C'mon, then. Let's have another match." </p><p>Aomine made a face, but rose from the ground. "You really are insane, did you know that?" </p><p>"It's not insanity, it's determination. Now get up, Aominecchi, stop stalling." </p><p>"That stupid nickname is already getting on my nerves." </p><p>"That just makes me want to say it even more. <em>Aominecchi</em>." </p><p>"Piss off already. Alright, I'm ready to beat you again." </p><p>"You're not going to beat me again, <em>Aominecchi</em>." </p><p>Of course he beat him again. And the time after that as well. </p><p>Kise never lost determination though, and even after their third game, when they were both completely spent, he still managed to mutter the words, "Again." </p><p>So yeah. Aomine didn't dislike him anymore. Whatever. </p><p>Didn't mean that he appreciated Kagami's smug look when he and Kise sat down with him at dinner, sweating and dirty and smiling.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>~oOo~</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Kise joined the Slytherin Quidditch Team when the holiday ended.</p><p>Aomine had a feeling it had something to do with their matches. Kise refused to admit it.</p><p>Aomine was still pleased about it though.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>~oOo~</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>"So, what, are you guys friends now?" </p><p>Aomine and Kise both turned to look at Himuro, who was looking at them in mild surprise.  </p><p>Aomine rolled his eyes. "Most definitely not. We're bitter rivals. The only reason I'm talking to him right now is so I could discover all of his weaknesses and use them against him in the future." </p><p>"Very clever," Momoi said.  </p><p>"Thank you." </p><p>"No, but seriously," Himuro prodded, leaning against Murasakibara's arm, "When did that happen?" </p><p>"They had basically spent the entire Christmas break playing Quidditch against each other," Kagami said, and Aomine could detect slight bitterness in his voice. "Couldn't find one without the other." </p><p>"That's a bit of an exaggeration, Kagamicchi," Kise said, a pink color dusting his pale cheeks.  </p><p>"Completely untrue," Aomine agreed.  </p><p>A big group of people walked into the Great Hall then, and Kise's eyes scanned them in concentration before they landed on someone. He got up from his seat with an apologetic smile directed mostly toward Kagami. "Got to go, my friend's here. Talk to you later." And he walked off to the Slytherin table. He sat down next to a short boy with pale blue hair who Aomine could swear he never saw before in his life, and immediately started chatting with him enthusiastically. </p><p>"I'm so happy to see you making new friends, Aomine," Momoi said, "Didn't think you had it in you, what with your unpleasant demeanor and all." </p><p>Aomine tore his eyes away from Kise. "Shut up." </p><p>She smiled slightly at him, then turned to Kagami. "So, did you have any progress with Kise? Did you ask him out yet?" </p><p>Kagami colored immediately. "No, I didn't." </p><p>"Oh, really?" Aomine asked with a smirk. "Then what was the whole 'Maybe next time we go to Hogsmeade I'll show you where you can get a Pumpkin Face Box' about?" </p><p>Kagami bit his lip. "I was just being friendly." </p><p>"No, this was your lame attempt at flirting," Aomine corrected. "But seriously, the only thing more oblivious than Kise would be a rock." </p><p>"Kise doesn't give me the impression of being oblivious," Momoi said, ruminating. </p><p>"Trust me, he is," Aomine said simply.  </p><p>Momoi smiled mischievously. "It's cute how well you know your new friend." </p><p>"He's not my friend!" </p><p>He was, kind of. Didn't mean he wanted to advertise it. </p><p>Not like it was a big deal anyway. </p>
