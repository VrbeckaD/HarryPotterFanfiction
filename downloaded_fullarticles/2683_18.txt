    <p align="center">Day 1 - Monday</p><p>The silence suffocates. Never has a ride in the lift felt so horribly long and unbearable. She avoids eye contact with him while he maneuvers himself as far away from her as covertly as possible. The air around them crackles with tension; invisible sparks fly around their heads, driving them to utter distraction.</p><p>Only when she disembarks at her floor do either of them relax. Both hope it was only a fluke.</p><p align="center">Day 2 - Tuesday</p><p>Draco has no choice but to use the lift he does. He had been for the last three years of working at the Ministry. It is the only one that goes to his department.</p><p>"Congratulations on the promotion, Ms. Granger. Didn't get a chance to tell you yesterday."</p><p>Draco's interest piques at these words. They explain her sudden presence in his lift.</p><p>"Oh, thank you Mr. Dawes. I understand our departments will be working together soon."</p><p>"You heard right. We'll have a meeting in a few weeks about the upcoming changes I'm sure. This is my stop. G'day, Ms. Granger."</p><p>He is the last one left.</p><p>Again, the two of them alone. Just like yesterday. He has nothing to say. Apparently she doesn't either.</p><p align="center">Day 3 - Wednesday</p><p>Both had struck an idea for avoidance and arrive earlier than usual. So there they are, together, on the lift, this time with no one else around, for longer than before.</p><p>The silence drones on...and on...and on...</p><p align="center">Day 4 - Thursday</p><p>Hermione goes back to her normal schedule. She isn't going to let the likes of Malfoy dictate her life.</p><p>Before getting onto the lift she hopes he might have kept to his earlier schedule in an attempt to avoid her. But no, there he is, right at the back.</p><p>Their eyes meet briefly. Dread flickers over his face for an instant. She's certain she mirrors his expression completely.</p><p>Something would have to be said. But not today. She can't bring herself to today.</p><p align="center">Day 5 - Friday</p><p>"Which department are you working in?" Her voice startles him and he slowly turns to meet her politely curious expression.</p><p>"Dark Artifacts," he replies automatically.</p><p>She nods.</p><p>He knows exactly what's going through her mind. Even three years since the war, he's still associated with Death Eaters. He'll never escape his past. He's accepted it now. For the most part.</p><p>"An intriguing department," she says aloud. "Probably the one that I know the least about." His brow furrows. Not the response he expected.</p><p>"You were promoted recently?" He asks, hoping to prolong the civility as best he possibly can.</p><p>She nods and keeps eye contact. "Magical Law Enforcement. Head of the Magical Creatures department."</p><p>"Well, congratulations." He recalls having heard something about her work dealing with goblin rights recently.</p><p>She's looking at him with wide eyes. "Thank you."</p><p>The doors open.</p><p>"Well, have a nice weekend, Malfoy." The doors shut before he can respond. Thank Merlin.</p>
