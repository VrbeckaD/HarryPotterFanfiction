          <div class="userstuff"><p>Hogwarts Great Hall</p><p>Iris West was sitting amongst the unsorted students in the Great Hall. She had been rather surprised on getting the letter. She considered her magic to be special powers only she had. Others having those powers made her angry.</p><p>She had used it to pick her friend Barry's pocket a few times as it gave her a rush of power. Her father and Barry had been very happy for her though.</p><p>Now she would get even more powerful and make everyone do what she wants because that was the only way the world could work. It should revolve around her always and everyone should worship the ground she walked on. Everyone would be wrapped around her little finger this way.</p><p>"Iris West!" Her name was called out.</p><p>Iris quickly got up from her seat and sat on the stool as the Professor McGonagall started lowering the Sorting Hat on her head.</p><p>"NO!" The Hat suddenly cried out, loud enough for all students to hear, which never happened as it could only be heard by the one on whose head it was kept.</p><p>"What is it?" Professor McGonagall asked as Iris looked confused.</p><p>"This woman is pure evil. She is worse than Lord Voldemort. I won't go on her head. I don't want to read her thoughts in depth. She is a hypocrite who wants to be worshipped by her own family and friends and never be seen as wrong even if she is. She is a bane to all good Wizards and Muggles everywhere", the Hat said as all gasped in horror on looking at Iris, even Dumbledore.</p><p>So Iris was left unsorted and sent back to her home, prohibited from using her magic ever again, with threats of consequences if she ever did, which was exactly what she deserved.</p></div>
