    <p>She was<strong> dying</strong>. The thing that her magic had become was too strong for her small frail body and <em>she was dying</em>. He couldn’t help her. They went up to the mountain and he tried one last time. Drawing the black inky infection that was tearing her apart from the inside out. A shadow in the soul and the body. Her scream was terrified as the obscurus burst forth. The girl so small and frail and terrified and the spell was supposed to separate the cancer and save her. And then the black mass that was her magic turned on him and he felt the faint stirrings of panic as the force of it exploded and he too screamed as pain filled his world and his vision faded into nothing.</p><p>He came to in a hospital in Sudan far from where he had been. He was weak and felt ill, but his case was beside him and his things were folded neatly and there was an officious-looking man smiling at him and his hand was clutching a scrap of fabric he knew belonged to the little girl who he had tried to help. Apparently he had been found at the edge of a massive crater. His clothing had been shredded, but there wasn’t a burn on him. In fact, beyond the strange aching weakness within him, he seemed completely unharmed. There was no evidence that there had been a little girl with him. Only a scrap of fabric and superstitious reports of a demon attempting to possess him.</p><p>The official was professionally kind, but emphatic he get the <em>hell out of the country</em>.</p><p>And he left,<strike> tail tucked between his legs</strike>.</p><p>A failure at protecting her.</p><p>At rescuing her from the beast that had consumed her.</p><p>In Egypt, he found smugglers. Ones with a large hawk-like creature that had been severely mistreated. The sight of the proud beast gaunt and sickly and weakened made rage burn bright within him where he hid in the disillusionment charm that had been surprisingly difficult for him to produce. He nearly blew his cover when the black wisps began to break through his skin, but it had ended well enough and he soon had a new friend while the world was now lacking in several smugglers. He did feel bad about that, but there were plenty of smugglers and many magical beasts were dying out due to their blatant disregard for the conservation efforts he was trying to put through. Unfortunately, as much as he loved caring for the Thunderbird in his case, he knew he had to let it go. There was only so much room and the poor beast was cramped.</p><p>Which necessitated him making a trip to America.</p><p>Arizona to be precise, though that also meant a trip through New York.</p><p> </p><p>What was the worst that could go Wrong?</p>
