    <p>Sirius felt as though someone were watching him. </p><p>It was not unusual for several pairs of eyes to follow him wherever he went, broad smiles falling into gaping mouths.  Pale faces and darting eyes, whispers following the only man who had ever escaped Azkaban, the infamous mass murderer (now exonerated, but that hardly mattered).  </p><p>It made it a bit difficult to pick up toothpaste and milk at the corner store, but he managed.  </p><p>In fact, the terrified glances of his neighbors had become so routine that he simply smiled at them, counted his change, and went about his day.  He hardly even felt self-conscious any longer.  Today, though, the fine hairs on the back of his neck prickled in warning, and his fingers twitched to grasp the wand stowed in his pocket.  He scanned the street ahead of him, and even went so far as to glance suspiciously behind himself, but at this early hour on a Sunday he was the only one conscious, let alone out and about.  He tucked his scarf more tightly around his neck, shivering at the violent chill that darted down his spine. </p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw movement amongst what he had presumed to be a gray, dilapidated pile of old robes by the rubbish bins.  From beneath a long, ragged hood, a gaunt face stared up at him.  </p><p>“I haven’t any money,” Sirius said, wanting with all of the adrenaline in his body to break the man’s gaze and run to the door of his flat.  Yet, there was something hypnotic about the way the man looked into his eyes, and the urge to run warred with the odd sense that he should move closer.  Perhaps it was pity- the memory of thin, shredded garments, bone-chilling days and unending darkness.  </p><p>“I can help you find a shelter,” Sirius offered, stepping closer.  The man watched him warily, and there was something about his eyes that made Sirius feel as if he were on the edge of a precipice, his heart beating so rapidly he could feel it leap into his throat-</p><p>“Expelliarmus,” the man said hoarsely, and before Sirius could flinch, he had darted forward with unnatural speed, fisted his hands in Sirius’ robes, and hauled him into the dim alley.  </p><p>Sirius struggled, but the man’s grip was tenacious, almost desperate, his bloodshot eyes wide and luminous in the darkness.  Was he on something?  The man’s arms trembled where they held Sirius fast.  His hair was long, ragged, and greasy, nearly entirely gray except for a few wayward strands of sandy brown that fell forward to cover his wide eyes. </p><p>“The prank on Severus, in sixth year,” the man’s hoarse voice cut through Sirius’ dazed shock, “what was your punishment?” </p><p>“I- Remus,” Sirius whispered, and reached for the man’s hood.  The man’s hand darted out to grasp his like a vise, tight enough to cut off the circulation to his fingers.  </p><p>“What was your punishment?” the man growled, and Sirius blinked.</p><p>“I was kicked off the Quidditch team.  I-,” he stopped.  There were several punishments he had been given and fully deserved that year, but there could only be one that Remus meant.  “Your dad took me to work,” Sirius took in the man in front of him.  “To the werewolf registry.” </p><p>Remus loosened the death grip on Sirius’ hand, his own trembling wildly.  “And why did he take you there?”</p><p>Sirius swallowed.  “To watch an execution.  For a woman who had bitten someone.” </p><p>Remus let go of Sirius’ hand, but did not return his wand.  “Voldemort?” he said hoarsely.  “Is it true, what they’re saying in the papers?  Or is the Ministry…”</p><p>Sirius shook his head.  “Dead.  Remus-“</p><p>“Dora?” Remus asked hopefully, and Sirius looked away.  </p><p>“Died.  In the battle of Hogwarts.  I’m sorry.”  </p><p>Remus’ eyes closed briefly at this, and he seemed to lose some of the manic energy from before.  </p><p>Sirius slipped his wand back into his grasp from Remus’ trembling hand.  “Remus,” he started carefully, “I don’t know where you’ve been, but I think we’d better get you to a hospital.”</p><p>Remus shook his head, and leaned back against the brick wall of Sirius’ building.  “No,” he muttered, “no, I’ll manage,” he took a deep, steadying breath, and passed out.</p><p>Sirius surveyed the limp body on the ground, and sighed.  “Of course you will,” he hauled Remus upright, and disapparated.  </p><p>*</p><p>"Hullo," Harry greeted, sitting in a plastic chair next to Sirius.  It wobbled dangerously, then righted itself.  "How is he?"</p><p>"The Aurors have eyes and ears everywhere, hmm?" Sirius spun an empty tin cup of coffee in his hands.</p><p>"Yes," Harry replied, looking wholly unashamed.  "Though I've heard someone was able to hide right under their noses for years."</p><p>Sirius barked a laugh.  "Well, when you've been one, you know how they think."</p><p>They sat in silence for a moment, watching Remus sleep.  The usual shuffle continued on around them, but it was far from the panicked fray only a year ago.</p><p>"How'd you find him?" Harry asked.</p><p>"Didn't," Sirius answered.  "He found me."</p><p>Harry's eyebrows shot to his hairline.  "He say where he's been?"</p><p>Sirius shook his head.  "Just shoved me against a wall, interrogated me, then passed out."</p><p>Harry smiled ruefully.  "Well, he's a very consistent person, you can say that."  He reached over and squeezed Sirius' shoulder, an odd role-reversal, but not so odd from Harry.  "I'm glad he's back."</p><p>"Me too," Sirius agreed, and startled when Remus coughed.  </p><p>"I told you," Remus rasped, "that I didn't need to go to Mungos."  He frowned up at Sirius, noticed Harry, and morphed his expression into a careful smile.  "Hello, Harry."</p><p>"You collapsed on my rubbish bin," Sirius argued.</p><p>"Oh, like that's never happened before," Remus shuffled upright.</p><p>"Do you know," Sirius crossed his arms over his chest, "that I had parasites for two years, and I didn't know it?  Do you know how much that-"</p><p>"I haven't got parasites," Remus complained, and slumped back against the bed frame.  "I don't transform into a dog and eat whatever shit I-"</p><p>"Snape was right," Harry mused, startling them into silence.  "Mr. and Mrs. Weasley argue like that all the time."</p><p>Remus looked at Harry, and seemed to notice for the first time the Auror badge affixed to his robes.  "Are you here to interview me, Harry?"</p><p>"Yes," Harry confirmed, apologetic.  "I thought it might be better that I did.  Given, you know,' he trailed off awkwardly.</p><p>"Yes, I appreciate it," Remus smiled at him.  "You did the right thing.  Unfortunately, I don't know that I'll have much to tell you."</p><p>"Do you know where you've been?" Harry asked.</p><p>Remus shook his head.  "I'm sorry, I was never able to go outside.  They kept me in a large house, with a cellar.  I escaped through the floo, when they let their guard down."</p><p>Harry stared penetratingly at him for a moment, but Remus only smiled vaguely.  "Were there any windows?  Could you see outside?"</p><p>"Yes," Remus looked sideways at the bare hospital wall.  "There were trees.  A forest.  I couldn't see any other houses."</p><p>"Who was it?" Sirius asked tightly.</p><p>Remus looked surprised.  "Amycus and Alecto Carrow," he replied, matter-of-fact.</p><p>Harry's eyes widened.  "But they were at Hogwarts-"</p><p>"They never left?" Remus asked softly.  "Both of them were there together, the entire time?"</p><p>"I-I don't know," Harry looked troubled.  "I wasn't there."</p><p>Remus nodded.  "They had- side projects, you could say," he smiled grimly.  "And I don't think the castle was up to their standard of living."</p><p>Sirius looked briefly furious, then just as suddenly in the wake of this he seemed tired, saddened.  "We never suspected the Carrows."</p><p>"The Aurors have been looking for them, though," Harry added.  "Anything you might be able to tell me could help us find them."</p><p>Remus shook his head.  "No, I don't think you'll find him.  I do think, though, that he will try to find me."  He looked up at Harry.  "I'll just have to make sure to kill him first," he smiled, all teeth.  </p><p>"Remus," Harry looked concerned, "I don't think you should go after them."</p><p>"Whyever not?" Remus tilted his head.  "I should leave this to the professionals?"</p><p>"Harry's trying to be diplomatic," Sirius interjected.  "There were some laws passed, while you were away.  By Umbridge.  It's been... difficult, to persuade the Ministry to repeal them."</p><p>"What do they say?" Remus asked.  "Exactly."</p><p>Harry winced.  "A beast using any spell against a true wizard shall be immediately executed."</p><p>"Hmm," Remus seemed to reflect on this for a moment, impassive.  "Thank you, Harry.  I appreciate being informed."</p><p>"Right," Harry peered at him suspiciously.  </p><p>"Well, if that's all," Remus swung his legs over the side of the bed.  "I don't have any intention of staying here.  Apologies."</p><p>"The Healer hasn't cleared you to go," Sirius flung up his arms, exasperated.  "Sit back down!"</p><p>"I don't have to be cleared," Remus stood gingerly.  "I'm perfectly within my rights to leave against their advice."</p><p>"Where will you go, then?" Sirius blocked the door.  </p><p>"That is a bit of a problem," Remus admitted.  "I think I'm at least two years behind in rent from my last flat.  And that was before I made my place in Greyback's camp."  Remus' feet were bare on the cold tile floor, and he shivered.</p><p>"The tip off," Harry said suddenly.  "That was you!"</p><p>"Well, of course it was," Remus said crossly.  "Though I'm not surprised Dumbledore didn't say a word."</p><p>"He's dead," Harry looked just past Remus' eyes.  </p><p>Remus' hands clenched in his torn robes, which were now stiff with a cleaning charm.  "I'm very sorry to hear that, but I suppose it makes sense now.  Yes, I gave the tip off that Greyback's pack was going to turn all those children.  I hope you made good on it."</p><p>"We did," Sirius said, resting a hand on his shoulder.  "Sit down, Remus."</p><p>"I'm leaving," Remus insisted, drawing himself up, and Sirius sighed. </p><p>"Fine, you stubborn bloody idiot," Sirius supported him.  "But you should know you've inherited your own place."</p><p>"Werewolves can't inherit wizarding property," Remus said immediately, then seemed to realize what Sirius had said.  "Oh.  My dad's dead." </p><p>"In his sleep," Sirius held Remus' weight as he slumped against him.  "Few days after the tip-off.  Didn't even have time to realize you were missing."</p><p>Remus closed his eyes.  "That's good."</p><p>"The house was in your mum's name," Sirius said.  "Muggle will.  Your parents made sure it was very clear.  I've been keeping an eye on it for you, 'till you came back."</p><p>Remus swallowed.  "You didn't think I was dead in a ditch somewhere?  Seems more likely."</p><p>"You?" Sirius slipped an arm around his waist, and helped him to the apparition point.  "Never." </p>
