    <p>Dear Leta,</p><p>This is kind of strange for me. I have no one to mail this to, so I just put all these letters in your jewelry box.</p><p>You used to love that old jewelry box so much. I found your old watch in it and your favorite pair of earrings and the necklace I gave you when I used to court you. When Newt and I were trying to figure out where to move all your stuff now that you’re gone, we decided to move all your old clothes to the closet in our apartment and I chose to keep the jewelry box. </p><p>I open it a lot more then I’d ever care to admit. It’s become a sort of ritual for me now, opening it and looking at the different pieces of jewelry before I go to sleep at night.</p><p>I miss you. I love you.</p><p>Theseus</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Dear Leta,</p><p>Travers just got a new assistant. I don’t like her all that much. She smokes a lot and always carries a canteen of whiskey, so she smells strongly of alcohol and tobacco. I can never stand being in the same room as her for more than a few minutes.</p><p>I guess the point is that my life just keeps moving. And I’m not sure if I want that anymore.</p><p>I miss you. I love you.</p><p>Theseus</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Dear Leta,</p><p>The first time I asked to kiss you, you told me you didn’t want to disappoint me because you’d never kissed someone before. You thought you weren’t good enough.</p><p>Well, you are. You’re more than enough for me.</p><p>I love you. Merlin’s beard, I love you. I still do. I wake up every morning, wanting to curl up against you and hold you, and you’re not there. I cry myself quietly to sleep every night and dream about you. I know you sacrificed yourself to let me live, but I wish I had died with you.</p><p>I miss you. I love you.</p><p>Theseus</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Dear Leta,</p><p>Newt is in love Tina now. He denies it, but anyone with eyes can see.</p><p>It’s so strange to see Newt grow up like that. Not because I disapprove of Tina. I think she fits him perfectly, and when she isn’t slamming me into a chair, she’s actually quite funny and lovely.</p><p>It’s just that I’m scared. I’m scared he’ll forget all about me and just leave me. Which is a stupid fear, because Tina’s just as supportive of me as Newt is. But maybe she’ll leave too.</p><p>If only you were here.</p><p>I miss you. I love you.</p><p>Theseus</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Dear Leta,</p><p>Not too long ago, I saw Tina crying over Queenie. She misses her, and now she hasn’t got anyone but Newt, Jacob, and me. And though we try our best to make her feel like family to us, you can tell it just isn’t the same for her. </p><p>I’ve been so worried about what I was going through that I was completely blind to the suffering of those around me.</p><p>Jacob cries over Queenie in his sleep. Newt is still mourning over Leta, and he has to take a Sleeping Potion to prevent nightmares about her. Tina can’t sleep at all, and I hear her pacing in her bedroom at night. Some afternoons, Newt manages to get her a few hours of sleep by letting her rest her head on his shoulder and curl up against him while he’s sketching creatures on the couch for the next edition of his textbook.</p><p>If you were here, you would know just what to say to Tina and Jacob and Newt to make them feel better. I have no idea what to say to them, but I want to help.</p><p>I miss you. I love you.</p><p>Theseus</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Dear Leta,</p><p>Your funeral is today. We didn’t have your body, so we have to bury an empty coffin.<br/>
I worked up the courage to approach Jacob and tell him I was sorry about Queenie. He started tearing up, but he just shrugged and said, “We both lost people we loved that day.”</p><p>I loved you Leta. I loved you so much it scared me. I still love you. It hurts, but it’s the truth. I’ll never stop.</p><p>Tina’s here too. She mourns even though she barely knew you. Newt’s there too, and he’s clutching Tina’s hand so hard his knuckles are turning white. He’s shaking really badly too, like he’s trying to hold back a mental breakdown. He started shaking so hard that Tina had to excuse him and walk him away to catch his breath and calm down.</p><p>I feel like having a mental breakdown too, but I’ve already had several.</p><p>I miss you. I love you.</p><p>Theseus</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Dear Leta,</p><p>Newt wasn’t here today since he had to go to a book signing, and Tina looked exhausted. I felt like it would be unfair to Newt to let her sleep on me like he does with her, so I let her sleep on the couch and I held her hand. She thanked me when she woke up.</p><p>I talked to her for a bit, and I realized that we had a lot more in common than I thought. I’m glad I got to know her.</p><p>I miss you. I love you.</p><p>Theseus</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Dear Leta,</p><p>Newt, Tina, Jacob and I were sitting down to have dinner. We ate for a bit, and then Newt went up to get seconds, but when he tried to sit back down, he missed the chair and landed on the ground. Tina choked on her water and started laughing, which set off Jacob, and that set off me. We all just sat there and laughed for a good few minutes.</p><p>It feels good to laugh. I guess it made us all feel okay, even for a moment. Even after everything we’ve lost, and everything we’re still going through. </p><p>I wish you were here to laugh with us.</p><p>I miss you. I love you.</p><p>Theseus</p>
