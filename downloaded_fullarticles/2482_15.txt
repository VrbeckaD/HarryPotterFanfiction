    <p><em>Thank Merlin for cooling charms!</em> Charlie thinks. Though even with the charm can feel the oppressive heat all around him. It’s the beginning of June and he is in Egypt with his older brother Bill. Ostensibly he is there to help his brother settle in, though it’s more to get away from their mother…</p>
<p>Largely because he and Bill were more than just brothers, they were lovers as well. A secret neither wishes to share with their family any time soon.</p>
<p>“So ready to see the bazaars in Cairo?” Bill grins as he approaches one of his arms gliding around his brothers’ neck, a casual gesture. It is both innocent and possessive.</p>
<p>“S’why I’m really here isn’t it?” Charlie teases. Standing side by side they really don’t look much like brothers; Bill is tall and lanky with pale cream colored hair and is covered in freckles, whereas Charlie is almost a head shorter with a wide stocky build his hair a deep red like the rest of their siblings.</p>
<p>“Oy! I thought you were here to be my work horse.” Bill laughs using the arm around Charlie’s neck to pull him into a head lock. “Now who am I going to get to do all my unpacking?”</p>
<p>“Bollox on that! You know as well as I do that you ain’t got fuck all left to unpack.” Charlie cries using his greater strength to sweep Bill off his feet, causing the slightly older boy to squeal with laughter.</p>
<p>“You really are a great brute!” Bill giggles not even trying to be let down, as his giggles subside Bill’s smile softens. “I am really am glad you are here with me.” He sighs.</p>
<p>Charlie thinks his eyes are probably sparkling by now. “So am I, love. And I can’t wait until –”</p>
<p>“Hey Bill! You up yet?” Charlie is cut off by an excited cry from outside their front door, Tonks. Charlie sighs setting Bill down so that he can answer the door.</p>
<p>“Hey Tonks…Did you need something?” Bill asks politely as he opens the door for the woman.</p>
<p>Tonks had been at Hogwarts with them and was in the same class as Bill, Charlie suspects she had, and by the looks of it still has a bit of a crush on Bill. “I was heading out to do a bit of exploring today… wanted to see if you would like to come with?” she flutters her lashes attempting demure, failing with her garish neon orange and blue hair. Charlie rolls his eyes grimacing.</p>
<p>“Oh uh, sorry Tonks, Char and I were heading out to do some shopping today…” Charlie mentally cheers as she finally looks past Bill to notice him, making a face that to Charlie screams annoyed.</p>
<p>“Oh… You brought Charlie with you… Doesn’t he have to go back to Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>“Not until September…” Bill answers quickly. The room goes silent as Tonks just stands at the door looking between the two brothers.</p>
<p>Realizing she isn’t going to leave on her own Charlie lets out an aggravated sigh and pushes past Bill. “Well we better get going before it gets too much later in the day!” Charlie feigns exuberance slapping his hands together and making sure to nudge Tonks out of their doorway. “Have a great time exploring we really must be off now though.”</p>
<p>Tonks snaps to attention with only a small frown. “Right, yeah… See ya later Bill!” she calls smiling at his older brother only.</p>
<p>As soon as she has turned away Charlie rolls his eyes so hard his head rolls with them. Bill laughs at his response. “I’m sorry about that… I forgot she was heading here too.”</p>
<p>Charlie shakes his head with a small smile. “Nah I figured she would follow you for a while, I remember how persistent she had been in the common room.”</p>
<p>Bill shudders. “Don’t remind me about that!”</p>
<p>Charlie grins. “What you don’t wanna remember Tonks using her abilities to try and look like mom to attract you?”</p>
<p>Bill shudders again. “That is exactly the opposite of what I want to remember from Hogwarts! Now… come on brat it’s an hour long flight to Cairo.” Charlie laughs but they are able to go on their way without further incidence.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Harry carefully picked his way through the crowded streets, he loved this place… it was so much better than his aunt and uncles home… though he still had to keep going back there to do his chores, this place was a nice reprieve away from their home.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Bill and Charlie spent a lovely morning browsing various stalls picking up things that caught their eye, haggling for the best deals on things for their home, or gifts to send their family. “Hey Char, I’ll be right back.” Bill says gesturing towards a facility housing bathrooms. Charlie nods waving him away.</p>
<p>As Charlie waits he watches the crush of people meander about, he loves the bright clothing people in this region wear. Pinks, purples, blues, drab gray, cream…</p>
<p>Wait… Charlie scans the crowd again quickly and spots a lone little boy. His top is much too big on his thin frame giving the appearance of a jellabiya but a closer look shows otherwise. Charlie watches as the boy deftly navigates the market keeping out of the way of the people wandering by.</p>
<p>He can tell the boy is alone and worrying that he may be lost Charlie approaches him. “Hey-ya kid.” He calls gently smiling as the boy turns towards him rapidly, Charlie watches as his gaze darts about wildly, looking for the best escape route Charlie thinks sadly. “Its ok kid, names Charlie.” The boy eyes him warily.</p>
<p>“What d’ya want from me?”</p>
<p>“I just wanted to see if you were alright, I’m here visiting my older brother and saw you wandering around… I’ve also got a bunch of younger brothers and I would hope if someone saw them wandering around alone or lost that they would go and help them.” He explains gently, hoping to keep the boy calm.</p>
<p>The boy eyes him up and down suspiciously. “I’m Harry…” The boy, Harry, says after a long moment of staring at Charlie.</p>
<p>Charlie’s grin widens a little more. “That’s a good name kid.”</p>
<p>Harry smiles tentatively at the other boy. “You said you had brothers?”</p>
<p>“Yup! I have an older brother, he just moved here, named Bill, then there’s me, Percy, Fred and George, they are twins, then Ron, he looks about your age, and finally a sister named Ginny, she’s the youngest.”</p>
<p>“That’s a lot of kids.”</p>
<p>Charlie nods as seriously as he can. “It is, but they are great… what about you Harry?”</p>
<p>Harry shrugs as his shoulders hunch inwards. “I got a cousin… but he isn’t very nice…”</p>
<p>Trying not to frown to hard Charlie nods. “I’m sorry, what about your parents?”</p>
<p>Hunching over even further Harry shakes his head quickly. “My aunt said they died in a car crash because my daddy was a drunk and they were stupid…”</p>
<p>Charlie’s can feel his jaw attempting to clench tight at that. “Is your family here?” he asks forcing a lightness to his voice he can’t feel.</p>
<p>Harry shakes his head quickly. “I come here alone when I’m trying to hide from Dudley.”</p>
<p>“How do you get here all by yourself?”</p>
<p>Harrys’ eyes widen fearfully as he leans in closer to Charlie. “I think its… magic.” He whispers terrified, watching Charlie’s reaction to the ‘M’ word closely.</p>
<p>Charlie nods slowly, that’s what he expected. “That’s amazing!” he exclaims hoping not to frighten the boy. “What makes you think its magic?”</p>
<p>Still watching him carefully for a reaction he answers. “Because I looked on a map… We’re in Egypt, and my uncle’s house is in Surrey.”</p>
<p>Charlie nearly falls over in shock. “Whoa… My brother Bill and I can do that too,” Charlie leans forward to whisper. “Though he can barely make it from Wales.”</p>
<p>“I can barely do what?” Bill laughs as he walks up behind Harry.</p>
<p>Harry squeals in fright rushing behind Charlie to hide. Bill eyes the child curiously, gaze settling on Charlie. “It’s ok Harry, this is my older brother Bill, I mentioned him earlier.”</p>
<p>Bill kneels down low to greet the frightened child. He smiles kindly at the boy hiding behind his brother. “Hello there, I didn’t mean to startle you… I was just looking for Charlie.”</p>
<p>Harry nods slowly accepting the answer Bill had given… “Hi.” He says shyly slowly moving from behind Charlie.</p>
<p>Bills gaze softens as he responds. “So I heard someone over here mentioning my name and being able to barely do something.” He swings a playful look towards Charlie.</p>
<p>Charlie nods solemnly. “Harry here, is from Surrey and he likes to come here to hide, and I was telling him how you can barely make the journey from Wales.” Bill nods slowly gaze travelling between his brother and the young, definitely magical, boy.</p>
<p>“You got that right, Char…” Bill says watching the child. “I do have a bit of an issue with such a distance but that’s because travelling like that is new for me.” Bill nods to Harry. “What about you, how long have you been making the trip here?”</p>
<p>Harry considers the question. “Well I’m 7 now… and the first time I came here I was 5… My cousin Dudley had pushed me down the stairs.”</p>
<p>Bill and Charlie share a horrified look between them. “Had he ever done that before?” Charlie asks gently.</p>
<p>Harry shakes his head. “No… he wanted to be like his dad though…”</p>
<p>“His dad?” Bill asks dreading the answer he fears is coming.</p>
<p>“Uncle Vernon used to push me down the stairs a lot.” Harry mumbles, wringing his hands worriedly.</p>
<p>Charlie can see Bill flinch slightly, so he gently turns Harry toward himself. “Harry,” He calls gently. “Why do you go back there?”</p>
<p>Frowning in confusion. “It’s one of the rules… where else would I go?”</p>
<p>“Well you can make it here… have you never considered staying?” Bill asks him kindly.</p>
<p>Harry shrugs again. “Aunt Petunia said I had to be home to do chores in the mornings, but any other time she didn’t care where I was…”</p>
<p>“Morning… you mean you’ve not slept at home before?”</p>
<p>He nods slowly. “I’ve stayed here a night before but I had to get up really early to make it home for chores.”</p>
<p>Charlie catches Bills eye over the boys head. “We were about to head back to my brothers home for lunch, would you like to come eat with us?”</p>
<p>Harry’s suspicious gaze swings between the two young men. “I don’t know… Where do you wanna take me?”</p>
<p>“Well, Bills’ home is near the Siwa Oasis… which is, about 550km away from here.”</p>
<p>Harry frowns, face scrunching up as he considers the distance. “That’s really far away from here… How do you get there from here?”</p>
<p>Charlie hadn’t thought about how all three of them might get back to Siwa, so he turns to Bill for an answer. “Well… for the 3 of us the safest way to travel would be taking a magic carpet.”</p>
<p>At the use of the ‘M’ word Harry’s demeanor begins to relax just a bit. “Magic?” he questions quietly.</p>
<p>Despite having actually invited the boy to lunch Charlie is still shocked at how quick he relaxes just by mentioning magic. “Yep.”</p>
<p>Harry stares between the two red heads a few moments longer before nodding slowly. “What do I have to do to get the lunch?”</p>
<p>Bill is somewhat at a loss. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“At home aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon said no food unless my chores were done… what chores will I have to do?” Harry explains matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>Charlie shakes his head slowly. “No, there are no chores… we invited you to eat with us.” Still looking skeptical Harry agrees to go with the 2 Weasley’s. Bill leads the way to a nearby magic carpet rental stall. As Bill approaches the proprietor about a carpet, Charlie takes a calming breath before asking Harry a question about his home life.</p>
<p>“Harry,” When the child’s attention turns towards him Charlie continues. “You mentioned something about chores before you could eat… What are your chores?”</p>
<p>Harry shrugs slightly, deciding the older boy may be considering putting him to work anyways. “Gardening, cooking breakfast, dishes, laundry… on Saturdays I have to clean out uncle Vernon’s garage and Dudley’s bedrooms as well, and Sundays is when I’m allowed to clean out my cupboard.”</p>
<p>Charlie nods slowly, he can feel the tight rein he has been keeping on his emotions pulling tight. “You ever been flying before?” Charlie asks the young boy, hoping to distract himself from his own emotions.</p>
<p>Harry quickly shakes his head. “I’ve heard about it before… is it fun?”</p>
<p>“I’ve never ridden on a carpet before,” Charlie confides. “But I know flying on a broom is amazing.”</p>
<p>“You can fly a broom? Like those witches on the TV?”</p>
<p>Vaguely remembering his dad muttering about a muggle contraption called ‘TV’ a few years ago, but not having a clue about what the contraption actually was Charlie shrugs. “I’m not really sure what a ‘TV’ actually is... I don’t think we have anything like that in the wizarding world… at least not in Europe.”</p>
<p>Eyes wide, Harry stares up at Charlie confused. “A TV is for watching shows… uncle Vernon likes the news, aunt Petunia likes ‘soaps’ and Dudley watches cartoons…”</p>
<p>Still having no clue what any of that actually means, Charlie nods anyways. “What about your favorite show?”</p>
<p>A quick shake of his head as he answers. “I’m not supposed to watch the TV,” Harry’s eyes widen worriedly as he remembers he wasn’t allowed to watch TV at home. “You won’t tell them I’ve watched it before?”</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, it’s ok! You don’t have to worry about them here.” Charlie says as he once more kneels to Harry’s height. “You are safe here.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Bill asks as he makes his way back over to them from the carpet dealer, an intricate rug tucked under one arm.</p>
<p>Harry startles easily not having heard Bill approach, turning to face him nervously. “Well Harry here was just telling me about a TV show with witches who flew on broomsticks, right Harry?” Charlie answers quickly drawing the boys’ attention back to himself.</p>
<p>Staring between Charlie and Bill a bit apprehensively Harry still nods slowly not wanting to lie to the two nice people… Fearing what they could do if they figured out it was a lie, after all they talked about magic. “It was on a cartoon with a talking bunny… but I didn’t get to watch all of it.”</p>
