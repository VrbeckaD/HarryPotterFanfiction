    <p>Harry honestly didn't know where to sit. He, Ron, and Hermione were looking through the windows of the compartments on the Hogwarts Express. Finally, after looking through the compartments, Hermione found one. But...</p><p>There were two boys inside, one leaning on the other, asleep, while the boy that was awake leaned against the window on his right side, his left arm wrapped around the smaller boy's shoulder.</p><p>The boy that was awake had blond hair and brown eyes, while the sleeping one had black hair. They looked to originally be from an Asian country.</p><p>"Uhm, excuse me..?" Hermione asked, bringing the boy's attention to her.</p><p>"..." The silence from him made Hermione nervous, but she had to ask.</p><p>"Do you mind if we sit with you?" She asked, before adding. "All the other compartments are full."</p><p>The blond shrugged, "Go ahead. I don't really care. Just don't wake him up."</p><p>Harry noticed the boy looked to be about 15-16 years old, and he was already in his Hogwarts uniform. The yellow and black tie hanging loosely around his neck, along with the Badger crest matching in color, let the Golden Trio know what House he was in.</p><p>The sleeping raven was also in his uniform, his green and silver tie, and Snake crest let them know he was in Slytherin.</p><p>The Golden Trio sat opposite of the two.</p><p>The four sat in silence before Hermione asked the blond haired boy for his name.</p><p>"Heiwajima Shizuo." He said, directing his gaze from the window to Hermione.</p><p>"That's a nice name." Hermione complimented.</p><p>The boy, Shizuo, just hummed and looked back out the window.</p><p>"Ahem...so, what year are you in..?" Ron asked.</p><p>"Fifth year." Shizuo sighed, "You?"</p><p>"We're all in Third," Harry replied.</p><p>"..and him?" Hermione pointed to the sleeping Slytherin.</p><p>"Orihara Izaya." The raven muttered, snuggling into the blond's chest.</p><p>"Are you two friends or something?" Ron inquired, being nosy.</p><p>Shizuo glared at the ginger, making the youngest Weasley boy gulp. "No. He's my boyfriend."</p>
