    <p>“ Y/F &amp; L/N?” you heard as you pushed your grocery cart down the cereal aisle. You hadn’t been back home in years and you’d hoped that anyone you ran into wouldn’t recognize you, but luck wasn't on your side today. </p><p>Turning, you smiled at the person that called your name. “Erik? Hey, how are you?” you exclaimed as you reached up for a hug. “You’re looking good.”</p><p>“Can’t complain,” he responded. “I haven’t seen you in a while, girl. Since the summer after you graduated from that fancy boarding school. Man, we was thick as thieves back in the day, now you just thick.”</p><p>You laughed slapping his arm, “Nigga, you always flirtin’ with somebody.”</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders, “Heard you was back for good. Is that true?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m back for good.”</p><p>“Hey, I’m sorry to hear about your moms,” Erik said taking a step back.</p><p>“Thank you, it’s been a long time coming,” you explained. “But I’fm glad she’s not suffering anymore, ya’ know?”</p><p>He nodded. The two of you stood there silently for a few moments, both lost in your thoughts. “Hey, why don’t you and your sisters come over sometime? I’m sure my grandma would love to see y'all.” Erik offered.</p><p>You hesitated, “I don’t know, E.”</p><p>“Come on girl,” Erik said as he fake pouted. “Please?”</p><p>“I’ll think about it,” you said as you rolled your eyes. “But I’m not making any promises.”</p><p>“Cool. Aight, Ima let you get back to your shopping,” Erik said as he pulled you in for another hug. “And you better come through. Don’t forget that I know where you live.”</p><p>“Whatever,” you laughed. “It was good seeing you, Erik.”</p><p>“You too, Y/N.”</p><p>You watched as he walked away. You hadn’t seen Erik Stevens in almost seven years, and those seven years had certainly treated him well. You continued shopping, making sure that you got everything your sisters wanted before you paid and left. On your drive home, you thought about Erik, and how good he looked, and how good he felt pressed up against you.</p><p>“I am not doing this again,” you said as you slapped your steering wheel. Your last relationship had ended quite horribly, and you weren’t ready to head down that road just yet. even though it had been two years. </p><p>“It’s not like he was asking for your hand in marriage,” you said to yourself. “All he wants is for you to come see his grandma, and I’m pretty sure she’ll cook y'all something to eat.”</p><p>It’s not that you didn’t know how to cook, because you did, you just hated the clean-up process that followed. Your mom had always tried to get you to clean while you cooked, but you never did. You chuckled thinking about all the times your mom would shake her head after she found a sink full of dishes after you had finished cooking.</p><p>
  <em>“Y/N,” she would say. “If you would just clean while you cooked, this wouldn’t be a problem. And why do you use so many forks when you cook? Baby, what am I going to do with you?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The two of you would laugh as she helped you clean the dishes.</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>When you got home, your sister, Tiana, helped you carry the bags into the house.</p><p>“Where’s Mya?” you asked as you handed Tiana a couple of bags.</p><p>“I made her take a nap cause she was getting on my nerves,” she replied before she huffed. “I don’t know why you just don’t use magic to do this.” Tiana was the middle child, born right after you went off to Ilvermorny. Even though y'all were eleven years apart, and didn't grow up together, you made up for that by trying to be the best big sister that you could be.</p><p>“Well, unless you want me to lose my magic, then I won’t be doing that,” you replied. “All these No-Majs around, I’d definitely be seen.” Yes, magic would make carrying groceries into the house easier, but magic didn’t need to be used for everything.</p><p>“I wish I was a witch,” Tiana admitted.</p><p>“It’s not all it’s cracked up to be. Trust me.” You mumbled. “Anyway, how was your day? Anything exciting happen?”</p><p>“Nah, ready for school to be over though. Only a couple more days.” She replied as she helped you put away the groceries. “Come on, Y/N. Why we gotta do this by hand? Why can’t you flick your wand and put this stuff away?”</p><p>“You lazy, you know that?” you chuckled as you pulled out your wand. “Aight, move.”<br/>
Tiana watched as each item floated out of the bags and into their correct place. “Man, you’re so lucky. So what’s for dinner?”</p><p>You grumbled, you hated cooking the day you went grocery shopping. It took so much energy to grocery shop, that you didn’t want to cook afterward. “Ugh, can’t you just make a pb&amp;j sandwich? I’m tired.”</p><p>“Nope, I had that for dinner last night…and the night before…and the night before that… and-”</p><p>“Ok, I got it!” you snapped causing Tiana to laugh. “Do you know Mrs. Stevens’ number?” you asked.</p><p>“Mrs. Stevens, that lives around the corner?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Mrs. Stevens, that used to babysit me when I was little?”</p><p>“Yes, Tiana.”</p><p>“Erik Stevens grandmother Mrs. Stevens?”</p><p>“Yes, Tiana! That Mrs. Stevens!” you yelled.</p><p>“Yeah, I know her number.”</p><p>“Well, can you call her and ask if we can come over for dinner?”</p><p>Tiana smirked, “Yeah, I’ll call her.”</p><p>You shook your head and sat down as Tiana left the room to call Mrs. Stevens. You knew she would say yes, but you didn’t want to just assume that she would. You flipped through a magazine as you waited for Tiana to come back into the room and your mind drifted back to Erik. Hopefully, you wouldn’t seem desperate for visiting his grandma the same day he invited you. But shit, you didn’t want to cook, and you knew Mya would be hungry when she woke up. You were excited to see Mrs. Stevens, you hadn’t seen her since you’d been back, you’d just been so busy with everything and taking care of everyone.</p><p>“She said we can come over now, she’s almost done cooking. You know she makes a lot of food whenever she cooks,” Tiana called from the other room.</p><p>“Ok, go get Mya up then,” you said as you rubbed your face.</p><p>You heard Tiana run up the stairs and then a few moments later, you heard your youngest sister ask where you were. The next thing you heard was her little feet clumsily run down the stairs.</p><p>“Mya, please be careful!” you called. Mya was your mini-me. She looked just like you did when you were her age. She wanted to be just like you, trying to copy everything that you did, even pretending that she was a witch just like you.</p><p>“Y/N!” Mya called as she raced into the kitchen and into your arms. “I missed you so much!”</p><p>“I missed you too, baby. How was school?” you asked.</p><p>And she was off. Mya was the type of child that could talk anyone’s ear off. You loved that about her. Talking kept her distracted as you fixed her hair and put on her shoes so that y'all could leave. You thought about driving, but why waste the gas when it was beautiful out?</p><p>Mya talked the entire way to Mrs. Stevens’s house and you and Tiana just listened and laughed when she mispronounced words. When you arrived at Mrs. Stevens’s house, she was sitting on the porch waiting for y’all.</p><p>“I was wonderin' when you were going to come by here,” she said as the three of you climbed the stairs. “Been a long time since I last saw you, how ya been?”</p><p>“Hi, Mrs. Stevens,” Tiana and Mya chorused. </p><p>“Hi, Mrs. Stevens, sorry it took so long to come see you,” you apologized. When you were younger, before you went to Ilvermorny, you spend a lot of time at her house. Since your parents worked a lot, you would go to her house after school and hang out with Erik.</p><p>“No worries, child. I know you’ve been through a lot these past couple of months. Come on in and eat, we was just waiting for you.” She stood and headed into the house gesturing for y'all to follow.</p><p>Once inside, the three of you took off your shoes and headed to the bathroom to wash your hands then went to the kitchen. </p><p>“Hey Erik,” you greeted when you walked into the kitchen.</p><p>“Erik!” Tiana and Mya screeched when they saw him and rushed to give him a hug.</p><p>“Wassup, y'all! Man y'all gettin' big!” he said as he hugged the two girls. </p><p>You shook your head as you watched Tiana plop down in the seat next to him and Mya begin to tell him about her day. Erik was like a big brother to Tiana and Mya. While you were gone, he was always helping your mom out with them making sure that they were good. After you graduated, you spent the summer at home hanging around your family and Erik’s family before you decided that you needed a change. So at the end of the summer, you packed up and left. It was hard, but you needed to leave. There was a whole world out there, and you wanted to see it. you didn’t get far though, you made it to Arizona. You called Arizona home for almost seven years before you made your way back.</p><p>Mrs. Stevens’s food was always good, always filling too. Y'all ate good food and laughed for what seemed like hours, as you told them stories of your time in Arizona. Even though you missed it you weren’t sure that you would go back. After dinner you noticed Mya’s eyes getting heavy and knew that it was time to go. </p><p>After thanking Mrs. Stevens, you went to pick up the almost sleeping 5-year-old so that y'all could leave.</p><p>“Nah, I got her, Erik said before picking Mya up and heading towards the door. “Ima walk with y'all. Grab her shoes, aight.”</p><p>“Tiana, come on. Bye Mrs. Stevens, thank you again for the meal!” You called as you headed out the door.</p><p>“Come by anytime, child. And don’t forget your plates!”</p><p>“I got them, Mrs. Stevens,” Tiana answered.</p><p>The walk was short, maybe 10 minutes and you, Erik, and Tiana talked the entire way home. Mainly you and Erik reminiscing about times when y'all was young. The trouble that y'all used to get into.</p><p>“… I told him that I didn’t know how to climb trees and I didn’t want to learn how, but he dared me, so I just had to,” you said trying to explain your side of the story. “And then the next thing I knew, I was stuck, upside down, in that damn tree. It took forever to get me out and my legs was all scratched up from the branches.”</p><p>Tiana howled with laughter and Erik chuckled trying his hardest to not wake up Mya.</p><p>“But I did learn how to climb trees after that, I never got stuck again tho,” you said as you laughed with them.</p><p>Y'all reached the house quicker than you wanted too. This is why you liked hanging out with Erik, time seemed to fly when he was around.</p><p>Tiana reached for Mya after she unlocked the door, “I’ll take her upstairs and put her to bed.”</p><p>Erik shifted the younger girl into her arms and followed you in.</p><p>He took a seat on the couch and watched as you locked the door and kicked off your shoes. You plopped down on the couch next to him and laid your head on his shoulder and sighed when he pulled you in close.</p><p>“Man, E, I forgot how good it is to be around people that you love. I feel so… I don’t know, but I know I haven’t felt it in a while,” you admitted.</p><p>“Yeah, I know what you mean.”</p><p>The two of you sat in silence for a while and you were further comforted by the rise and fall of his chest.</p><p>“Y/N, I’ve been meaning to ask you something.”</p><p>“Hmmn,” you responded. You hadn’t realized that you had started to fall asleep.</p><p>“Who takes care of you?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Who takes care of you?” he repeated. “You’ve always been the one to take care of everyone else. Even when you left, you were still taking care of your mom and your sisters. But who takes care of you?”</p><p>“I take care of myself, nigga,” you replied. “I can’t be depending on other people when I got shit to do. All people do is just let you down.”</p><p>“That’s how you really feel?”</p><p>“That’s what I know. It’s been proven time and time again, can’t depend on others when you got stuff to do, Erik. Especially now that I gotta take care of my sisters. I’m lucky my job was able to transfer me back or we’d be moving to Arizona.”</p><p>“You just need to put your trust in the right people,” he replied.</p><p>You sucked your teeth, “Like who, Erik?”</p><p>“Like me.”</p><p>You chuckled, “You wanna take care of me?”</p><p>“Nah, I’m going to take care of you,” he clarified. “This been comin’ for a long time. Either you was gon’ come to me, or I was gon’ come get you. You’ve been mine since the day we met.”</p><p>“Erik you do realize that I have to think about my sisters, right? I can’t let them get hurt by anyone.” You defended pulling yourself away from Erik.</p><p>“What you mean by that?” he snapped, turning towards you.</p><p>“Nigga, they call you ‘Killmonger’. I’ve known you all my life, I know why they call you that,” you deadpanned.</p><p>He laughed, “Aight, you got me. But do you really think I would bring you to any harm? You know me better than that, girl.”</p><p>“Not on purpose, but you never know. Niggas is crazy,” you laughed.</p><p>“Yeah, but I’m crazier,” he responded straight-faced. “You really think I’ma let you do this on your own? Have a little faith, Y/N.”</p><p>You didn’t respond but cuddled back into his arms. What’s the worst that could happen?</p>
