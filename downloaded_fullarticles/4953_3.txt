    <p>The last thing Percival Graves expects is for Theseus Scamander to walk right into his office that particular afternoon. They've been good friends since the War, even though their interactions are mostly through letters.</p><p>"It's nice to see you again," Theseus grins and sits in front of Percival's desk without waiting for an invitation. He hasn't met many british wizards but he's sure most of them have impeccable manners, or maybe it's just professor Dumbledore.</p><p>"You too," he says. He moves the reports on his desk away because he knows it'd be impossible to concentrate while Theseus is there. Besides, the wizard's smirk gives Percival a very bad feeling about the other's visit. "So... What brings you to America?"</p><p>"I just wanted to see you, mate." It's the quick response, but Percival has many years working as an auror to know when someone is hiding something. "After what happened with Grindelwald... Well, I was worried."</p><p>At least the last part was sincere, which makes Percival relax again.</p><p>"It's been two years since that. I'm fine."</p><p>Theseus' lips twitch; he doesn't seem to believe him but drops the subject anyway.</p><p>"In your last letter you mentioned you were quite busy, but I guess that's fine, you always liked your job, a little too much if you ask me."</p><p>Yes, people likes to remind him he works too much, that he's an obsessed workaholic and he forgets how to live. But the truth is that he likes being Director, he likes the responsibility and the challenge that comes with the position. It keeps him occupied and far away from the nightmares and the memories of his time as Grindelwald's prisoner.</p><p>"And how about personal life? How's that going?"</p><p>Percival has the weird impression that his friend is up to something, but he can't figure it out what it is.</p><p>"I don't have time for that," he responds, which is completely true, besides he's not interested in that, at least not now.</p><p>There's a smirk on Theseus' lips as soon as he says that it only confuses him even more.</p><p>"I've heard Picquery is very concerned about that and has tried to hook you up," he chuckles obviously amused by his friend's suffering.</p><p>Percival groans, remembering the last time Seraphina convinced him into going on a blind date with that witch. They didn't have anything in common and Percival ended up wishing he was back at his office, working on the last case.</p><p>"She's worried; she thinks I need to settle down." Seraphina believes he's lonely.</p><p>He's not, he has a few friends and he enjoys to live alone, besides, he doesn't spend much time at home anyway.</p><p>He's not lonely. He doesn't feel like that.</p><p>"What are you really doing here, Theseus?"</p><p>The wizard looks at him for a couple of seconds, like he's trying to find something on his eyes, before answering.</p><p>"You see... There's a ball in honor of the War heroes, here, in New York, but you must know that already since I'm pretty sure you're one of the guests."</p><p>He is and he has received the invitation, but to be quite honest he has completely forgotten.</p><p>He doesn't want to go.</p><p>"This time I'm going to bring my little brother with me. Have you met him?"</p><p>It's Percival's turn to grin.</p><p>"No, I haven't. But it feels like I know him already because you mention him all the time on your letters."</p><p>Not only that, Percival knows Newt Scamander is probably the reason why he is alive now, but he hasn't had the time to go and thank him for that.</p><p>"The thing is he has become quite famous after the incident with Grindelwald and because he has recently published his book about magical creatures."</p><p>He still can find the connection; he still doesn't understand why Theseus is mentioning that or what does he expect from him.</p><p>"And because of that I receive at least two of these every day," the good mood on his face vanishes and it's replaced by a grimace. He hands him a letter that Percival reads with amusement.</p><p>"Your brother has suitors," he snorts, not able to hold it back. The whole thing is hilarious not only because the disgusted expression Theseus is making right now, but because Percival knows him enough to be sure it must be killing him. Because that auror is ten times worse than a Mama Bear, he overprotects his brother too much.</p><p>"They're not suitors," Theseus groans. "They're just people that think they have a chance and are stupid enough to ask me for advice, like I'd ever help them."</p><p>"But what does your brother think of this?"</p><p>Theseus rolls his eyes.</p><p>"He's too oblivious to notice when someone is that interested in him. But when he notices (and that's only because that person had said it right to his face) he tries to reject them as kindly as possible. Newt doesn't have the time to be in a relationship, he's too busy traveling around the world and doing his research."</p><p>"Then what's the problem?" It must be one, otherwise Theseus wouldn't be in his office, talking about his brother with Percival.</p><p>"They keep appearing and some of them don't seem to take 'No' for an answer, not until they meet me at least." He continues, frowning like he's remembering something particularly unpleasant. "I believe the only thing that would stop them is if my brother is already taken."</p><p>"But for that to happen Newt has to meet someone and start a relationship with said person," Percival adds and grins while saying: "which is something you definitely don't want."</p><p>"It's not that I don't want him to be with someone and let them steal him from me," he says through clenched teeth. "It's just that nobody deserves my brother."</p><p>Percival rolls his eyes. Sometimes he wonders why is he still friends with Theseus. Newt Scamander hast to be some kind of a saint; it must be a nightmare to have to deal with that.</p><p>"But I had an idea," the sentence catches back Graves' attention.</p><p>"And that idea involves me or why are you-"</p><p>"It does, actually." Theseus grins and Percival knows it's going to be bad before he even says anything. "I've been thinking you two can pretend to be in a relationship."</p><p>His friend has gone mad.</p><p>"No, don't look at me like that. Hear me out first. This is actually brilliant, that way Picquery won't bother you anymore. And you can keep an eye on my brother while he's in New York." Theseus continues. "Picquery has offered him a job in MACUSA and he seems really interested. And it's not that I think he can't take care of himself, but after what happened I'll sleep better if I know you're keeping an eye on him."</p><p>"Does your brother know about this?"</p><p>"Not yet, but he won't mind, believe me. In fact, I think he'll be grateful because he's not a people's person and doesn't like the attention at all."</p><p>The rational side of his brain insists that's a very bad a idea, but he also can't not think about the benefits; Seraphina's concern has turned into a real nightmare the last couple of months. It'd be great for once to be left alone.</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>"Theseus..."</p><p>"Of course, if it makes you feel uncomfortable you can refuse. It's okay." He says, which only makes Percival more confused.</p><p>"Why would I do uncomfortable?"</p><p>"Because Newt's a man," his friend replies, like it's obvious, which it is, but not in the way Theseus is thinking.</p><p>Percival frowns.</p><p>"So what?"</p><p>"You only like women."</p><p>Does Theseus think he's straight? And suddenly his friend's calm and relaxed appearance makes so much more sense now. That's why Theseus is so eager to let Percival take care of Newt and to be part of this fake relationship. Perhaps that's why he chose him on the first place, because he thinks Newt's completely safe in the arms of a heterosexual man.</p><p>The thing is... Percival is not straight, he likes both men and women. Still, that doesn't mean he's not a gentleman and that he'd take advantage of the situation, he's not like that.</p><p>But why does Theseus think that? Percival tries to remember the few times he has mentioned his friend about someone... They all have been women.</p><p>Percival should tell him, he should let Theseus know the truth and assure him that Newt will be safe... But he's not planning on accepting, is he?</p><p>"That won't be a problem," it's what comes out of his mouth instead. He's not sure why is he doing this, why is he letting Theseus believe that.</p><p>"Nobody knows, right? Because if someone does, then they won't believe you're dating my brother."</p><p>Of course nobody knows, because he's not straight and the people that know him personally, like Seraphina, are very aware of that.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Perfect! Does that mean you accept?"</p><p>It's crazy, he hasn't met Newt Scamander yet, he doesn't even know how he looks like because he hasn't opened the reports about the incident, not all of them.</p><p>Still, he has no idea why the offer sounds more tempting now, but he suddenly finds himself nodding.</p><p>"Only if your brother agrees."</p><p>"He will."</p><p>***</p><p>Newt feels a little out of place in the ball, sure he put on that suit his brother insisted him to wear, but there's too many people and some of them are looking right at him. He misses being inside his case, surrounded by his creatures, those he knows how to handle.</p><p>At least nobody's trying to approach him, but Newt suspects it's because his brother is with him and he knows how intimidating Theseus can be when he wants to.</p><p>He's not quite sure about Theseus' idea, has been thinking about for days now and doesn't know what to think of it.</p><p>He has to talk to Mr Graves first. Theseus can be pretty convincing when he wants something and Newt's not sure if the Director agreed because he wanted or because that was the quickest way to shut Theseus up.</p><p>Speaks of the devil... Theseus gets pulled away when one of the generals of the British army starts to ask him questions about strategy and weaponry.</p><p>"You must be Newt Scamander," a tall man with black hair and very muscled figure walks towards him. "It's really a pleasure, I'm Robert Ferguson."</p><p>Newt takes the other's hand to shake it, but Robert brings it to his lips and kisses his knuckles.</p><p>He blushes.</p><p>"I've been reading your book. It's absolutely brilliant."</p><p>"You think so?" Even though he still feels a little uncomfortable, Newt's smile is genuine.</p><p>"Yes! I admire your work and all the passion you put in it. Maybe we can discuss about it another day? With a coffee?"</p><p>Newt's always eager to discuss about his creatures.</p><p>"I'd love to!"</p><p>Robert takes a step closer.</p><p>"Great... Tomorrow perhaps?"</p><p>"He'll be busy," Theseus growls and yanks his brother away.</p><p>Robert looks back at his brother and one glare is enough for the man to disappear.</p><p>Newt blinks in confusion.</p><p>"But, 'Seus, Robert was just being friendly."</p><p>"One day I'll teach you the difference between friendly and flirty."</p><p>Then he reminds him they have to wait until Percival arrives and Newt hopes the man is nothing like the impression Grindelwald did of him.</p><p>He starts to get bored and tells his brother he's going to be in the garden. Finally, when he's sure there's no one around, he calls Pickett and the bowtruckle jumps out of his pocket.</p><p>It's a clear night, which is something to appreciate because New York, like London, has not many of those anymore. There's a silver sparkle on the water coming from the fountain.</p><p>Newt smiles at Pickett and both of them choose a tree to spend a little time, of course he'd like to stay more, but he has to return to the ball. He looks at the salon and hears the sound, muffled by doors and the distance, and he sighs. It's not that he doesn't like people, but being suddenly surrounded by strangers can be quite overwhelming.</p><p>***</p><p>He doesn't want to be there; he'd prefer to be filling paperwork or trying to solve a case, but he has made a deal, one he's still not entirely sure about.</p><p>Besides, Seraphina will be there and she has threatened him with a week off if he doesn't go.</p><p>Percival sighs, knowing there will be a line of men and women wanting to convince him to dance with them; he's a war hero and a very powerful auror and that had brought him a group of very interested and insistent people that takes any chance they have to throw at him. And he doesn't have the time nor the interest for that.</p><p>According to Theseus everything will be different if he pretends to date his brother.</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>He looks down at his invitation and walks towards the entrance, the wizards at the door welcome him and show him the way to the dance floor, but Percival is distracted by a pale figure sitting under a tree.</p><p>He rushes towards him, wondering if the man is injured or tired.</p><p>"Are you okay?"</p><p>"I'm fine, don't worry," the man says, but doesn't look up at him.</p><p>If he needed another proof of how straight he is not, it would be those reddish curls and those freckles that could compete with the number of stars that can be seen on the sky. He has a furious urge to make the man to look at him.</p><p>"I'm just staring at the stars with Pickett."</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>"Pickett, my bowtruckle!" The man takes what it looks like a green little stick that can move for itself and shows it to him. The tiny thing sticks its tongue out. "Don't be rude, Pickett! Sorry, he's not usually like this."</p><p>A magical creature. As Director of Magical Security he should take the man to MACUSA, but the man is adorable and it's obvious Percival can think clearly at the moment.</p><p>"You should not bring an illegal magical creature to a ball full of aurors," he teases instead.</p><p>"You won't tell them, will you?"</p><p>"I promise I won't, but you have to be more careful," he chuckles and thanks Mercy Lewis Seraphina is not there to see him.</p><p>Finally, the man looks up and Percival feels dizzy when his eyes met those green ones and his heart does a weird jump inside his chest, like it's being pulled out.</p><p>His grandfather used to say things like that; he described so many times what he felt when he met Percival's grandmother. He was a romantic; he believed all males in the Graves' family were destined to fall in love at first sight.</p><p>As a kid, Percival liked those kind of stories, but after the War, after everything that happened with Grindelwald, after nobody in MACUSA realized it was not him all those months, he stopped believing in that.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>The man smiles at him and Percival's heart does that funny almost painful thing again.</p><p>"Mr Graves, did 'Seus send you to look for me?"</p><p>No, he can't be- he's so screwed.</p><p>"Newt Scamander?"</p><p>The man nods and Percival wishes he had looked at a picture of him before, to be prepared.</p><p>"No, he didn't send me," he says, once his voice works again.</p><p>And because he's a weak man, he ignores completely the rational side of his brain and sits next to him.</p><p>Newt looks confused, adorably so.</p><p>"You don't have to keep me company. It's not your responsibility, I can take care of myself just fine. I don't know what 'Seus told you, but you don't have to do any of this if you-"</p><p>"I want to," he admits. "To be honest I'm not sure I'd like to go inside."</p><p>"Me either," Newt whispers. "I don't feel comfortable around so many people."</p><p>"Maybe we can stay here for a couple of minutes," Percival likes the idea, to have Newt just for himself.</p><p>"You don't have to do it, you know," Newt says a few seconds later. "I mean... Pretend to be something we're not. No matter what 'Seus says I can handle it, the attention... And it's not like I have so many people around me all the time."</p><p>Percival knows he's wrong, Theseus has told Newt has many suitors and he believes him. He doesn't want them close to Newt.</p><p>"I don't mind. I'll do it if that's what you want," he says because he's masochist, because it'll be a slow torture.</p><p>Newt's smile grows wide and Percival is sure Theseus would change his mind if he could look at him at the moment.</p><p>It's a mistake, he knows it. But he'll take whatever the other is willing to give, even if it's not real.</p>
