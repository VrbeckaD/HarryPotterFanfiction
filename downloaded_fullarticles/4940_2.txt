          <div class="userstuff"><p>Severus didn't consider himself the sentimental sort but he'd never forget their first kiss. </p>
<p>Harry'd been celebrating a Quidditch victory. He tasted of ale and smelled of sweat. His broad, calloused hands caressed Severus's face, his fingers threading through Severus's hair. His vibrant green eyes sparkled, contrasting with his red, swollen lips and flushed cheeks.</p>
<p>Harry was <i>beautiful.</i> </p>
<p>Not that Severus had said as much. He'd been in a state of shock.</p>
<p>He might still be.</p>
<p>Severus drew Harry's hand to his lips and pressed a kiss to the back.</p>
<p>"What was that for?"</p>
<p>"Nothing in particular."</p>
<p>"Love you, too."</p></div>
