    <p>The snow began to fall at a little cemetery in Godric's Hollow. In front of a gravestone that represented so much, stood a young man with green eyes and a young woman with subtly tamed bushy hair. As they were paying their respects the young woman surreptitiously took out what appeared to be a long stick, and with a slight movement of her wrist appeared a beautiful wreath of roses against the stone, so pure white it could compete with the snow itself.</p><p>"Thank you Hermione, Merry Christmas." The young man said softly.</p><p>Hermione looked to her companion and with a small smile, leaned her head against his shoulder her gaze returning to the wreath. "Merry Christmas Harry."</p><p>Without a thought Harry's head leaned gently on top Hermione's as his hand sought hers with no hesitation. No words needed, both just stood there in each other's company each contemplating the events of the previous year. The war had taken its toll on each of them. This war was in fact, a magical war within a secret magical community. It was a war, which the young man had lost both his parents to as a child. This war had also claimed both the young man and young woman's childhood. Both Harry and Hermione from afar would have appeared to be normal 18 year olds. Yet, to a closer observer, both looked much older and haunted than they should. Harry picked up his head when he felt his best friend shiver and wrapped an arm around her waist to warm her up. Hermione looked at Harry with her chocolate eyes a bit wide. Harry looked at her with his own small smile silently asking if she was ready to leave. Returning his smile, Hermione nodded her head and both turned towards the kissing gate to leave.</p><p>"Hermione?"</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"Let's go grab a hot chocolate, my treat."</p><p>Hermione smiled, "That sounds like just the ticket to warm up. A heating charm can only do so much." She laughed.</p><p>"Well then, can't have you freezing over now." Harry grinned as his arm found its way back over her shoulders and hers wrapped around his waist while walking side by side. Harry abruptly stopped in his tracks.</p><p>"Harry, what…?" Hermione turned her head in the direction Harry was looking at as they rounded the corner. Her expression turned into a grimace to match Harry's. In front of them stood the ruins of a home that should have been filled with happy memories and parents who should have lived a long life. Harry held Hermione a tad closer as if seeking courage he felt he could find only with his present company in order to do something he knew would be a challenge.</p><p>"Can we look?" He asked. Hermione looked to the house then back to Harry.</p><p>"I'll go with you." She said determined. Harry knew that look on her face well. She never wavered in her loyalty to him, not once since they were the tender age of eleven and twelve. It was because of her that he found courage to face his past, and she probably would never know that for Harry Potter, she was the only witch he would ever want by his side for everything and anything. Harry had somewhere, deep inside; had always known Hermione was it for him. If he had to figure out when, Harry would say he'd known just how special she was to him since their second year, and it was confirmed for him during their fourth year. It wasn't at the Yule ball and seeing her dressed up for the occasion. Though to him, she was definitely the most beautiful girl he'd seen, but it was right after the names of the champions had been drawn. Everyone in the school had turned on him, except for her. She had been the first to say she believed in him, no questions asked nor needed. It was in that moment when he knew he loved her beyond friendship. Yet he never acted on it. There was always this little voice inside his head (which sounded very much like the Dursleys') that told him she could never love a worthless freak like him. She seemed to have feelings for their other best friend Ron Weasley, (who seemed to also return those feelings) and so he stepped aside, wanting both his best mates to be happy, especially Hermione. Every day he fought that voice, which was harder to do during the horcrux hunt. That voice increased every time he had to put on that locket, whispers of being unworthy of love, unworthy of Hermione, growing louder and louder, people dying because of him. When it came off, he'd take a moment to try and shake it off. Stealing glances at her when she wasn't looking, jealousy rising every time Ron would do the same, but anger rising at Ron every time he argued with her about something pointless or making her cry like he did at the Yule ball. When Ron left, his heart broke for different reasons that night. After a week had passed, he'd had enough of Hermione's moping. He held out his hand to her, which she took. He pulled her up from where she sat as music was playing on Ron's radio. Moving both of them around he began twirling her and she him, both of them escaping for one mere moment. Escaping from horrors of war to be carefree teens, filled with friendship, hope, and love. As the music and their dancing slowed, laughter fading from their lips, green eyes met brown and briefly, Harry's eyes flickered to Hermione's mouth, just barely moving his head closer to her. Till this day, he doesn't know what stopped him from kissing her, but it became his most cherished memory. Harry felt Hermione squeeze his hand to get his attention. Instinctively, Harry laced his fingers with hers while squeezing back.</p><p>"Sorry, got lost in thought." Harry said.</p><p>"Whenever you're ready Harry." Said Hermione.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Harry walked forward with Hermione at his side. The signs instantly appeared when he touched the gate as they did before during the war (our wishes are with you Harry) and only pausing slightly at the front door, which had been blown off the hinges, entered his family home for the first time. The stairs had debris and weeds littered all over them, and as he looked around from the entry, he heard Hermione take in a sharp breath. Following her gaze, his eyes landed on a fallen family portrait near an opening to the living room. Walking towards it, he knelt down to pick up the picture. Looking back at him were his parents and baby Harry, his parents laughing, smiling from ear to ear while pointing the camera and waving Harry's little hand. Hermione walked towards him as he stood back up. Both Harry and Hermione held a sad smile as they looked at the photo. Harry took the photo out of the frame and conjured a box to put it in. Then both began exploring the cottage at Godric's Hollow. When they entered the living room they found more pictures, which Harry put in the box. Hermione began to laugh when she saw a picture of baby Harry chasing a cat with a toy broom in his hands, (a cat that looked remarkably similar to Crookshanks). After salvaging all they could from the living room, which, aside from dust, twigs, leaves, and dirt having settled in, the room looked remarkably in tact. A faded sofa by the fire place, a coffee table in front of it with a couple of chipped tea cups and saucers with old copies of the daily prophet, pages scattered by the winds around the room. The next room they explored was the kitchen. In this room they found more photos pinned to the refrigerator this time including friends. Harry then held his hand out to Hermione, and she new the next rooms would be the hardest. Taking his hand they went up the stairs, facing the door to what they suspected was Harry's parents' room.</p><p>"Are you sure Harry?" Hermione asked, "We don't have to go in today if you don't want too. We can come back another time."</p><p>"No," he said, "I'm sure. You're here with me, there's no one else I'd rather be doing this with. I can face it." Pressing forward through the door, he didn't noticed Hermione's surprised look. She couldn't help but feel a bit surprised, as she was so certain he would have wanted Ginny to be with him instead. Harry and Ginny seemed to be getting closer again now that they've all had time to try and recover from the war. Hermione also couldn't help but feel smug and then guilty at Harry's confession. There was a small part of her that hoped Harry might be interested in her as more than a friend; but by the time he started displaying interest in girls, it was always the athletic types like Cho Chang or Ginny Weasley. So she tried to squash any feelings for him, as she just wanted him to be happy. He's known so little affection and love that she told herself since she was thirteen years old, that she would not be responsible for coming between him and happiness. Yet, taking a scary, albeit romantic, flight on the back of a hippogriff to save his godfather, really tested her resolve to kiss them then and there. He was her best friend and she was determined to never risk what they had. When the horrible events happened during their fourth year, her heart broke for him. He looked lost and broken by the end of that term. She had kissed his cheek at the end of the year. Ron looked shocked, Harry had blushed, and her parents looked amused. She squeezed his hand promising that she would write. Once home, she started crying. Her parents were so startled, they just held on to their daughter until she calmed down and then they had Hermione tell them everything. Horrified by her tale they began to ask about other schools and taking her away to Australia if need be. Hermione, never one to yell, always so rational, screamed at the top of her lungs, afraid so much so that she lost control of her magic and accidentally shattered the nearest vase before she began to hyperventilate. After regaining control she managed to convince her parents to let her stay. She couldn't leave Hogwarts and she would not leave Harry. A relieved Hermione and worried parents hashed out the beginnings of a plan should things become worse. Eventually, during Hermione's 7th and final year at Hogwarts, before school could even begin, things became worse.</p><p>Her parents, aware of everything including her plans for their safety, had their memories wiped on an unexpected day as planned, and Hermione had sent her parents to Australia. The war progressed, and after they found that horrible locket, every time she wore it, it felt worse than facing her boggart. She constantly heard vicious whispers of her being a failure. She would fail everyone she held dear, and because of her failure, everyone she loved would die. Who did she think she was? She was just a mudblood, and once everything was done, would no longer be needed. She would be alone; not Harry or anyone else would ever love a brainy bushy haired bucktooth know-it-all. She was just the brain. She fought that voice everyday. The locket, that horrible piece of tainted jewelry was playing on old insecurities. That's all there was to it. Then one of her worst fears played out and she felt powerless to stop it. Ron and Harry had got into a nasty fight, and Ron had asked her to abandon not just the hunt but to abandon Harry when he needed both of them the most. She had made a promise to be there for Harry. She had not abandoned him since they all became friends, and she would not start now. When Ron had left, and Harry tried to cheer her up after, she knew it was always Harry. Ron had forced her to choose, and in the end it was always going to be Harry. She was upset that she couldn't let go, but her feelings grew stronger and stronger. While they danced, Hermione had hoped Harry was going to kiss her, maybe she had imagined him leaning in and her feeling so shocked couldn't move, but nothing happened. She mentally kicked herself. He was in love with Ginny and she would have to move on.</p><p>Hermione was so lost in her memories she hadn't realized she had been staring at a faded book cover while she stood in front of a vanity. Snapping out of her thoughts while Harry had wandered towards the closet, she picked up the book and opened it. Immediately she felt a chill go down her spine and she called for Harry.</p><p>"Hermione, are you okay?" Harry asked, alarm on his face as he rushed to her side. Hermione wordlessly handed him the book. Harry frowned when she didn't answer him, but took the book and opened it. Inside the cover written in delicate cursive read, "For my Son, a journal of Lily Potter nee Evans (some passages by your father, James Potter)." Harry stared dumbly at the book.</p><p>"Well," Harry said after a moment, "I didn't know what we were going to find but, did not expect that."</p><p>"Quite a shock, you'll want to read it later I expect." Hermione said, unspoken reassurance that he did not have to read the journal now.</p><p>"Yeah, later… I think we found all we could in this room. Are you okay to come with me to the last room?" he asked a bit nervous.</p><p>Hermione looked at him and nodded. "Of course Harry."</p><p>Together they exited his parents' room and approached the most damaged room of the house. Both gasped as they entered the nursery. A mammoth sized hole was in the room and the walls and it was a miracle, (perhaps due to magic) that, the room wasn't caved in. Floor boards were splintered beyond repair, the crib, Harry's crib, had a side of railing fallen on the toddler mat. A rocking chair was in the corner weathered by time. What was once a room so painstakingly put together with careful debated decisions and love was truly a scene of horror and devastation. Harry could no longer keep it in. Here was the undeniable proof of how his family was taken away from him. He was human, not a super emotionless machine that society seemed to expect of a man. He fell to his knees, unknowingly, in the same spot where his mother and father played with him, showered him with love, and protected him with their lives. Harry sobbed for the loss, grieving not just for the memory of his parents, but for everything and everyone who had been lost to the war. Hermione knelt in front of Harry and wrapped her arms around him, not saying a thing. In her arms, Harry felt safe, secure, and loved. He hugged her back as if his life depended on it, knowing that it was okay to feel and be vulnerable, and there was nothing to be ashamed of for how he felt. After he calmed, he took a few deep breaths to steady himself. As they both stood up Hermione noticed something in the crib. Walking towards it, she reached for the item peaking out from an old threadbare blanket. It was Harry's toy broom. She smiled and walked back to Harry who was looking at in wonder as he found his name engraved on the handle. Smiling, he looked up to see Hermione fiddling with the same beaded bag she'd had during the hunt. Holding it open for him, he placed the toy in her purse.</p><p>"I'm ready." Harry said. In that moment he knew he was ready for more than just leaving the cottage. He was ready to stop living in fear. He was ready to face his scariest challenge to come. That challenge being, woo, court, and convince his best friend they could be more. He was ready to try and win the heart of one Hermione Granger. Heart beating rapidly, he looked to his best friend and smiled.</p><p>"How about that hot chocolate?" He asked. Hermione smiled as she took his hand as they left the cottage. Once outside they took one last glance. Change was on the horizon. For Harry, the one constant he'd fight for would be the witch at his side. Always.</p><p> </p><p>______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Author's Note: Hi all, so I hope anyone reading this has enjoyed this story. I am having some possible debates about the possibility of extending this to a maybe a few more chapters. Although, I am thinking this might be best to leave as a one shot. I haven't written anything in a very long time. I am open to constructive criticism, but no flames. Thanks for taking the time to read this story.</p>
