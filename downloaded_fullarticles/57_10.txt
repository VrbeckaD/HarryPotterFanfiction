    <p>They're all dead.</p><p>Potter, gone.</p><p>Granger, gone.</p><p>Weasley, gone.</p><p>The Dark Lord won.</p><p>Draco was the only one left, leading the resistance, but he's hardly qualified, given his mental condition, not to mention half of them don't trust him with that vile thing staining his inner left forearm.</p><p>Draco Malfoy is 26 years old, partially insane, and broken inside. So why was he still here, still fighting? Even he didn't know the answer, he just knew he needed to, he had considered taking the easy way out a few times, but those thoughts were quickly crushed as he thought of his mother, his friends, and everything he'd lost to The Dark Lord. </p><p>Imagine his surprise when he's out in the ruins of the forbidden forest looking for Mimbulus mimbletonia and a centaur walks out. Draco whips out his wand in a elegant but sharp motion, one that showed experience and leveled his wand at the creature.</p><p>"Draco Malfoy." He spoke in a gruff voice, Draco recognized the Centaurs voiced, Bane. One of the few remaning Centaurs in the forbidden forest.</p><p>"What do you want, Bane?" Draco asked, instinctively throwing up his Occlumency sheilds.</p><p>"I'd rather it be a sane one, but you are who the stars chose." Bane spoke as he neared. </p><p>"Protego Maxima!" He threw up his sheild charm.</p><p>"Don't fight Malfoy, this is the only way to correct the suffering he's brought on the world." Bane broke through Draco's sheild, much to his suprise, although he did seem to struggle quite a bit.</p><p>Draco was just about to throw a bombarda, when suddenly, the world went black.</p><p>                                                                     *****************************************************<br/>
Draco woke up in a cold sweat, in a room he recognised to be Umbridge's office, he could never forget the place with all it's creepy cat decorations and horryfing dolls. </p><p>"Mr. Malfoy!" Was that the toad?</p><p>"Mr. Malfoy! Are you alright? Oh for the love of Merlin." She murmered that last part under her breath. Draco had no clue what was going on, but if the past 9 years had taught him anything, it was how to adapt.</p><p>"Professer?" He got up, his head felt like someone had thrown a bludger at it.</p><p>"Mr. Malfoy, Are you alright? You just fainted." As his vision became more clear, he could see the horrid women standing above him, her wand out, her eyebrows furrowed in annoyance.</p><p>"Actually Professer, I feel horrible, I think I need to go to the hospital wing." He got up, not waiting for the toad's response, he practically ran out of the room, he heard Umbridge calling him but didn't pay it any mind, there were things that were more important than whatever was coming out of that woman's mouth.</p><p>He actually did feel like shit and very well wanted to brew a headache relief potion, or some pepperup.</p><p>Draco thought back to what he remembered, Bane had said that someone needed to 'correct the suffering' he hadn't specified how, but Draco got the point. Centaurs were naturally talented in Divination and Astronamy, Bane said that the stars had chosen him, studying stars was a common practice in Astronamy, and Divination was all about predicting the future.</p><p>Time travel.</p><p>That was the only answer that checked all the boxes, he didn't have a bloody clue how the fuck the centaurs had managed to figure out how to travel back in time, but he was sure as hell wasn't complaning. He clearly had changed physically, but he knew he was the same mentally. He rembered everything and he still felt the tingle in the back of his mind from the multiple Crucio's he had endured.</p><p>He was still partially insane.</p><p>A small price to pay, one that Draco would gladly take to change the past. He thought back to what Potter had told him about his 5th year, quite a eventfull year evidently. No wonder he was sent back here, the best time would've been 4th year if he was to stop the death of Cedric, but clearly he wasn't meant to do that. What he could do however, was save Black, and to start that, he needed to visit a certain bearded old man.</p><p>He stopped in front of the Gryffin Doors. He didn't know the password. Fuck.</p><p>He would have to name every sweet he knew, which was about five. Double fuck.</p><p>"Acid Pops, Charm Choc, Blood-flavoured lollipops, Bertie Bot-" The doors opened showing a distracted Dumbledore. </p><p>"Headmaster!" Draco yelled getting Dumbledore's attention. The old man looked up from his book, looking over at him, the normal twinkle in his eyes faded as soon as he looked Draco in the eyes.</p><p>"What is it you need Mr. Malfoy?" Draco's eye twitched at the name.</p><p>"If we could talk in your office, headmaster?" Draco suggested, he saw the way Albus was looking at him and knew that the old man had immediately suspected, perhaps not the time travel, but he knew something was wrong.</p><p>The headmaster nodded.</p><p>Draco climbed the spiral staircase that led to the Headmaster's office.</p><p>He walked in and watched as Dumbledore walked in behind him, the headmaster slowly walked over to his desk and sat down. Draco walked over to the chair on the other side of the desk and waited for the headmaster to start speaking.</p><p>"Something is different about you Mr.Malfoy." Draco's eye twitched again, that was the name Lucius went by.</p><p>"Draco." He corrected. </p><p>The headmaster raised an eyebrow in surprise, the suspicion in his eyes died down somehwhat and was replaced by fascination. He could use this to his advantage, if he rembered anything about Dumbledore, it was when he got interested he wouldn't let something go until he understood it thoroughly. </p><p>"Very well, there is somethng different about you, Draco." That was much better. </p><p>"I need your help headmaster." Draco looked away from the headmaster, just a little something extra. He could almost feel the fascination radiating off of the headmaster.</p><p>"I'm afraid I'll need more information, Draco." He saw Dumbledore smile in the corner of his eye, it was working. Draco made sure he seemed hesitant.</p><p>"My father wants me to do things that I disagree with, I need your help, something happened over the summer and..I'm not sure I can go back to the manor." That was partially the truth, Draco remembered this year, he would be forced to get the dark mark this summer, and he would be damned if he let that feral thing ever touch his skin again.</p><p>He looked back at the headmaster, he was frowning.</p><p>"What happened this summer, my boy?" It was weird hearing sadness in the headmaster's voice.</p><p>Nothing had happened this specific summer, but he did have a story in mind that was definitely going to make the headmaster play heroic Gryffindor. The dreaded summer of his 7th year, that fucking bitch he called his aunt and her bloody sadistic mind.</p><p>He let down his Occlumency sheilds, something he hadn't done in a long time, it felt weird not having them up, his mind felt bare.</p><p>"Well, headmaster, when someone keeps you under the Cruciatus Curse for 3 minutes, it tends to leave a mark." </p><p>He watched as the headmaster used a very subtle form of Legilimency to see if he was lying, he took great pleasure in watching Dumbledore's face drain of color, Draco had let him see very brief flashes of the torture he had endured, he just hadn't let him see anything that would leed him to suspect it wasn't really last summer.</p><p>"I'm very sorry this happened to you, Draco, I am beyond glad you chose to come to me, I do have a few ways that I can help you." He was right, Dumbledore was Gryffindor to the core. </p><p>If he was right (and he usually was) Dumbledore would put him in the DA, that little club the Golden trio had started. That way Dumbledore would have time to do get him out of the Malfoy household while also insuring he was safe, or at least, not surronded by Slytherins, which he had to admit, he would miss Blaise and Pansy, they were the closest things to real friends he had. He wondered what Dumbledore would do for meals and the whole common room dilemma though.</p><p>"Unfortunately you will have to stay in your common room, but I do have a place that I want you to go, it is on the third floor, you will need to walk past the tapestry three times, you will go there in two days." </p><p>He was right, although he was surprised, he had expected Dumbledore to make him swear an Unbreakable vow so that he wouldn't tell anyone. He supposed it made sense, there was no reason for Dumbledore to believe that Draco would want to go back to them, and he was right.</p><p>"You will also be meeting me here every week, I will personally act as your mind healer."</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>                                                                 ******************************************************</p><p>Draco sat down in the library and really thought for the first time since he came back. He was back in time, he had a chance to do everything again, he could prevent Pansy, Blaise and Narcissa's deaths, hell, even Potter, Granger and Weasley.</p><p>He no longer had scars on his face from Greyback.</p><p>He no longer had the mark on his arm, his magic was no longer tainted by the dark magic that oozed out of it.</p><p>He felt free.</p><p>Draco Malfoy hadn't cried since he was 17, but he couldn't help but let the tears fall, just this one time.</p><p>Draco Malfoy hadn't felt hope in 7 years, but he couldn't help but let the hope bloom in his chest, just this one time.</p><p>                                                                   *********************************************************</p>
