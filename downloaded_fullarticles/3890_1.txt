    <p>My name’s Draco Malfoy. I’m an Unspeakable, which is ironic, as here I am, speaking to <em>you</em>. Well...not ‘speaking’, exactly. And not to ‘you’, either, unless I am referring to Potter, which of course I am, Potter, so pay attention. And it’s more like ‘recording’, which is something we Unspeakables do periodically as a matter of protocol. You see, our job requires knowing quite a lot of information, some of it important and some of it trivial, and it’s difficult, knowing quite so much about quite so much, you understand? Now and then we need to, ah, shall we say, <em>clear the cogs,</em> if you know what I mean? So, as per usual, I’ll be handing this over to Potter for his Ponder and that’ll be it for another month or so. Of course, he’ll be handing me his, in turn, so I’ll be stuck with the Pottery version of things, but I am accustomed, so not exactly fashed, right? No, sorry, Potter. I really do enjoy it, your view of the <em>anima mundi</em>; I’m not lying.</p><p>Just to make it clear, Potter is my partner. We’ve both been Unspeakables for a few years now. Severus Snape is our department head at DOM, which is not at all surprising when one Ponders it, and we mostly work with our fellow younger, more <em>au courant </em>Unspeakables: Granger, Lovegood, Parkinson and Patil, specifically, plus a few of the others, who’ve been Unspeakables for positively centuries now and maybe should really, <em>really</em> consider retiring. Yes, Potter, that is the truth and you know it. Not mentioning names in particular, but if that one decrepit old stick confronts me in the cafe one more time and nitpicks my style, my antecedents, my allegiance or my [relatively] innocent relationship with Our Saviour (that being you, Potter), I shall, as Mr Weasley says, blow a fucking Muggle gasket. Well, no, <em>he</em> doesn’t say <em>fucking</em>, but he implies it, Potter. Strongly. Do stop interrupting me. I’m feeling queasy, what with all the mumbling and eyebrow waggling.</p><p>To go on. If you were curious as to how it all came about, especially after the events of the Voldemort War and those ghastly years at Hogwarts and the Manor before that, my somewhat sullied reputation, Potter’s Good Deeds and ultimately golden reputation, etc., etc., then I’d merely say it’s probably due to Snape and Potter and Minister Shacklebolt twisting quite a few arms in the Wizengamot. Or beards. Or lace kerchiefs. Although Potter is stubborn as fuck and flat-out <em>refuses</em> to admit what he said to Shacklebolt and the Headmistress specifically, but whatevers.  Long story short: all the Hogwarts students in our year and previous were pardoned of all crimes and were unanimously told they’d have jobs at the Ministry awaiting them, back in ‘99. Training on the job and whatsit, which was helpful in the extreme as NEWTS were a bit of stumbling block, at least for some of us. Yes, yes, Potter, I know. We all have them, House and Blood prejudice has been effectively surmounted, blah, blah, blah, what Hermione says, but it was well after the fact, so stop mumbling. I don’t know that<em> I’m</em> necessarily proud of that period in my life.</p><p>Right, to continue. The Ministry trotted out it’s Sorting Hat--and who knew they even had one, right? Except us, apparently, because we’re Unspeakables, but that’s all ancient history. Really, a lot of it is. Binns has nothing on Madame Spice when it comes to wielding a ten tonne tome and assigning endless parchment on everything from Goblin Wars to what that fucker Grindelwald wrought back in his day. But I digress. Everyone got sorted into their various departments, it was all very First Years-y, tra-lah-lah, and, bob’s your uncle, or possibly second cousin, we few (very!) were sent straight into Unspeakable training. Which is no bloody picnic nor walk in the bloody park, ta very much. Unspeakables are the <em>ne plus ultra w</em>hen it comes to Ministry personnel, second only to the Minister. Now, as soon as I knew that about them, I naturally wanted to become one, because, ho, <em>Slytherin</em>, yes? We, being Unspeakables, simply  have to know everything--and that truly does mean Everything, so we are trained in <em>all</em> the Departments, from Aurors to Games to Archives to Misuse--well, you get the idea. And while Granger was completely unsurprising as a Sortee into DOM, Potter rather <em>was</em>, at first.</p><p>To me, at least. I’d’ve wagered on Potter for Aurors, no question, but there you have it.</p><p>Upon reflection, though, I decided that Potter was just as valid a choice for an Unspeakable position as I myself was. Potter, you see, has hidden depths. Yes, you do. You’re a very curious person, Potter, and I mean that in every possible way. Including the complimentary way, so again, please don’t pout at me, as this is just as required. Boring as fuck, but required. One day these Pensieves will be useful to train future Unspeakables and I’m just trying to do my small part in furthering the cause of education. Background knowledge is key. No one ever wrote down that one common base in 9th C potions lore and now we can’t recreate it because no one. Ever. Wrote. It. Down.</p><p>Yes, right, here we are then; to business. We’ve conducted a number of Ponders this last month. Two of them had to do with open Auror cases, which have been since closed and Archived, and another few to do with a mishap in the Games department, when Zabini literally dropped a Quaffle in a most embarrassing way internationally and we Unspeakables had to save his damned arse from the fury of a foreign Ministry. But the most notably inscrutable was this one, the highlights below:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p dir="ltr">“These items,” Snape said, gestured at the table, which obligingly produced a number of ‘items’, “are the subject of your next official department Ponder. I shall expect you both to seek connexions, pursue tangents and report back to me, both singly and as a team, the conclusions--if any--at which you arrive. A week should be sufficient.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Without further adieu he retreated, leaving Draco and Potter to first stare at the table and then at each other.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“A week?” Potter burst out, yanking out a nearby chair and slamming his arse into it. He huffed, blowing out his cheeks and sending a wayward hank of hair flying aloft. “A fucking week? Is he even serious?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Please note that we generally use the Pondering Room when at DOM and that Snape himself is often the instigator--oh, sorry! I meant to say ‘requestor’--of Certain Enquiries. It’s got a long oval table and a whole slew of uncomfortable chairs and it’s dead quiet in there. Excepting for when Potter’s present, of course.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p>Draco rolled his eyeballs and chose a chair across for Potter. He seated himself decorously, choosing a random item from the assortment nearest him and subjecting it to a cursory scrutiny.</p>
  <p>“Hmm, a Rubik’s,” he said after a longish pause, during which Potter grumbled no more, at least not loudly, and Draco pointedly did not mention that Severus Snape was generally 99% serious, 99% of the time. “Muggle in origin, some Magical enhancement, mostly dissipated. Likely a joke gift to some young Witch or Wizard--ten years ago, maybe? And look, here’s a deck of Muggle playing cards, right next to it. Tattered, strongly aromatic of Muggle whisky. How interesting. There are poker-playing dogs on; quaint. See their little cravats? How darling--how demeaning. What tales these do tell of the shallowness of humanity, am I right? Gambling and all that rot, the evils of that foul Muggle whisky. Waste of time, if you ask <em>me</em>. Not that you would, of course.”</p>
  <p>A longish pause erupted, during which Potter stayed stubbornly silent and unmoving, stared down his cuppa and...and, well, Draco regarded Potter. Until, naturally, he was fed up with it and forced to chide the petulant bastard. “You know we don’t have all day here,” he pointed out, careful to keep his tone very bland and not at all acrimonious.</p>
  <p>“Best to be getting on with it.” Oozing an air of righteous assiduousness, Draco picked up another object from his side of the long table. “I do believe,” he went on, “that this is a stray piece of Meccano, Potter. Charmed, I’m sure. You know, oddly enough my father had a set when he was small, given by some well-meaning great auntie, I’m sure, which <em>I </em>was then given to play with as a tot--”</p>
  <p>“Fine, fine,” Potter sighed and reached out to grab what was closest to him. “Getting on with it, alright? And here we have..ah. A thimble, most definitely Magical. Sterling, with a SureSew Spell imbued and still active, probably late 19th century.”  He set that down quickly and took up a book: smallish, with a red leather cover. “And here is a….oh! It’s an old journal, by the looks of it. Yes--owned by a Witch named Primula B. G.”</p>
  <p>“Oh, oh? Primula, you say?” Draco started a bit and glanced at Potter. “Primula <em>B</em>, Potter? You are aware that’s a favourite family name amongst the Twenty-Eight, yes? For both the Black clan <em>and </em>the Potters, as it happens. She might very well be your relative, in a roundabout way. But really more likely mine, in all actuality, as it’s ‘B’. Though it could also be ‘B’ for Bagshot or some such. Is there a date to that diary, Potter? Perhaps also from the 1920’s or 30’s?”</p>
  <p>He stopped short, holding up a hand to prevent Potter from even thinking of replying, clearly struck by a thought.</p>
  <p>“Hmmm, no. That can’t really be, can it?” he mused aloud. “It must be earlier, quite a bit earlier...before the turn of the century, perhaps. I don’t recall any Potters on the Ministry Tapestry, at least not from this last century; that is, not connected to Blacks, at least officially. Though I can't recall any recent female relative on the Black side named Primula, either. Not off-hand. I just seem to know that there have been some, and in both families. But your lot was abroad for a longish time and you know how the Tapestry Magic is spotty when it comes to the foreign bloodline extensions. Very squeamish, that bloody old rag.”</p>
  <p>“Right, well.” Potter shrugged, as if to say a speculative connection between Potter and Black was unimportant. Which was both unlike Potter and quite untrue. Pursing his lips, Draco let it pass, eager more to move on than to debate the Pottery presence or non-presence in Britain during the early years of the previous century. “As to the date,” Potter continued, turning the book this way and that, peering carefully. “Er, um...let me see.”</p>
  <p>“Yes, do,” Draco encouraged, intrigued despite Potter’s own obvious non-interest. “And then perhaps tell me it, so we can see if there’s any chronological connection to this more Mugglish lot over here.” Potter flipped carefully through the pages, peering at the closely written copperplate, and eventually shook his head in the negative.</p>
  <p>“No, no, there isn’t a thing. Not a year, nor even a month. Days of the week, yes, but no actual dates. Odd. And why ‘Primula', though? I can understand the Blacks using it--flower name, right?--but why would <em>my</em> family? 'Petunia', 'Lily'...all common. And not...not a Magical family, the Evans. It’s sort of strange, that. I don’t know why you would think it.”</p>
  <p>“Alliteration,” Draco replied promptly. “P-P-Potter." He quirked a brow. "There’s power to it, as you know. Just as there is power to naming one’s child after a constellation, say, a god of yore, or even a simple botanical specimen. Spice covered it very early on in training, but you missed that one session, did you not? Never did tell me why." He paused expectantly, but Potter only gave him a bland Look. "Well, in any event, we’ll have to read it over, then--but later.” Draco sighed, flapping a hand at the scattering still on the table. “Let’s crack on, shall we? What else have you got there?”</p>
  <p>“Oh, I've’ a--a--what’s it?” Head bent closely over the table's surface, Potter regarded a vaguely nebulous object doubtfully, poking at it with a curious fingertip and frowning. "Um..." he trailed off. "Weird."</p>
  <p>“Right, when you’re ready. ” Draco nodded affably enough, when the moment of Potter's further revelation had died a quiet death. “Continuing. Now, on mine I’ve a hand-drawn cartoon, lampooning some poor posh sod, from the looks of it, also Muggle, likely 1930’s.” Draco picked it up gingerly by its somewhat battered edges and eyed it, noting a walrus dressed in a top hat and spats and some luxuriantly mustachio’d bobbies brandishing batons at a raggedy crowd obstructing the well turned-out walruses’ progress. “Political in nature,” Draco, not really paying heed to his frowning partner, meandered right into his list. “As they so often are. Labour versus anyone who’d fight them, likely. Or maybe the other way 'round; never did have a head for Muggle politics, sorry. Boring.”</p>
  <p>“Hey,” Potter inserted, mumbling as he absentmindedly laid  down the journal and picked up the object he’d been poking. “Wait? Mine’s a bit—a bit. It’s not quite a bad example, but, if you would just--I could. Er...do you want to just come look?”</p>
  <p>“Let me just be done, do, Potter,” Draco replied, kindly, shaking his head. “May as well, right? And then we’ll do you again, I promise. Right, and this, this is...Hmm.” He eyed a lumpy glob of something.  “Yes. Here’s a...dried up lump of...clay, is it? Looks like clay, at least. Grey, porous, smells of riverbank and rotting veg. I’ll test it in the lab, later; make certain. No idea why this is included. Snape is peculiar. This is all peculiar and not particularly interesting in any way. I’m quite bored to tears, here, Potter. Also getting thirsty. Give me your tea?”</p>
  <p>“Because Snape moves in mysterious ways, of course,” Potter grinned, subsiding back into his seat. “Of all people, Malfoy, you should know that. And no, I won't; I need it to prop my eyelids open, even though it's gone stone cold. Hey, are you done yet? Or anywhere near?”</p>
  <p>“No!"  Draco snapped, slightly miffed about the tea but understanding of Potter's need. "Shut it, let me finish up my side. This thing, this clay thing? No inscription, no markings, not a Rune stone, not a Gobstone, not much of anything, really, so definitely suspicious. No Magical residue, not a trace. Knowing Snape, it's probably --”</p>
  <p>“It’s probably nothing at all, Malfoy, and he only slung it in to confuse us.” Potter quirked his brows quizzically. “Be just like him, really. He’s subtle like that.”</p>
  <p>“Be that as it may, I’ll still be forced to test further." Draco sighed. "Right, then.”</p>
  <p>Draco set the anonymous but faintly foreboding dried-out bit of clay down and glanced across the table. Potter was still smiling faintly, for reasons known only to Potter. Carefully, he flashed a brief smile of his own in return, which only caused Potter’s face to crinkle further and his eyes to appear especially merry.</p>
  <p>“Something funny? No? Well, what’s keeping you from telling me yours, then?” Draco prodded, watching suspiciously as Potter twiddled his fingertips on the table. “What else have you, over there? That thing to your right, to start? Is that...is that--what even <em>is </em>that? You’ve been side-eying it for ages now.”</p>
  <p>“Hmph!” Potter snorted, still smiling. “Well, now, as you’re finally giving me leave to even <em>say</em>, Malfoy, I’ll be happy to share. To start, we have, ta-dah, this!”</p>
  <p>“<em>This</em>?”</p>
  <p>Potter pointed flippantly. “May I present you an...allergen? A whole heap of them, actually.”</p>
  <p>"Bloody <em>cat</em> hair?" </p>
  <p>Chuckling at Draco’s instant flush and wrinkled nose, Potter scooped up what looked remarkably like a mound of shed Kneazle fur across the polished surface of the table, making a small lofting pile.</p>
  <p>The chuckle morphed into a muffled snort and a puffing huff when a pesky wad of fur flew askew and floated nearly up his nose, all of which action Draco found to be oddly engaging. He chuckled as well. “Oh, good one, Potty.”</p>
  <p>“Oh, hey,” Potter twinkled. “Made you laugh, didn’t I? <em>I</em> don't mind.”</p>
  <p>“Shut it, Potter.” For a long moment they both sat, smiling at each other like utter idiots for no good reason. "Ah, a-hem! Pardon!"</p>
  <p>Until Draco coughed suddenly, looking away and making a business of resettling his arse in his seat.</p>
  <p> </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>I did, as I recall, actually have to hide a really silly grin at this point in the programme. As to that tiny little slip I made, just now? The ‘oddly engaging’ bit that I know you’re absolutely going to obsess over, Potter? And remind me of every time you have the slightest opening? Sad to admit, oh Pottery-Pot, Silly Old Spot, you <em>are</em> sometimes ‘oddly engaging’. Engaging, amusing and generally <em>some </em>fun. Being the superior Unspeakable that I am, I’ve no issue with letting that slip, though. It is a known fact that you exude what they commonly call ‘charisma’.</p><p>Why, <em>hullo</em> there, Granger. What’re you doing here in my Pensieve, snooping about? Do <em>I</em> do this to you, then? Dig about in your Cumulative Unstated Monthly reports without asking? No, Granger,<em> I</em> do not. I leave that to Lovegood, Merlin help her. Go away, please; we’re just going along aces without you.</p><p>Besides, I am afraid this might get a bit personal.</p><p>But whatevers. You ex-Gryffindors are a very suspicious lot. Worse than I ever was, surely.</p><p>Right, carrying on with this particular Ponder, as Merlin knows, it may very well be of use, someday. Maybe.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p>“Ginger cat hair,” he--that’s <em>you</em>, Potter--announced, pushing the shifty mound away again just as quickly as he’d gathered it up. “But Kneazle, not regular moggy. I should know; I’m mildly allergic to Muggle cats but not at all to Kneazles, nor even half-Kneazles. Fortunately, because Hermione, you see.”</p>
  <p>He shrugged at Draco’s gratuitously rolled eyes and obligatory sneer. Granger’s adoration of Kneazles was a known thing. Snape’s adoration of his Kneazle was a <em>new </em>thing, certainly, but not all that surprising.</p>
  <p>“Sorry, but it is what it is. You have to stop being so touchy about her, Malfoy; you’re just as bad as she is and you know it. You’re only ticked off because she’s in charge of this month’s Pensieve Rotation review. Anyway, this is Kneazle fur, and I expect from a young one, still extant. It’s glossy still, see? So it’s recent and may not even belong in this Ponder, if we’re to go by even the very broad collection era we’ve sort of established.”</p>
  <p>“Wonderful,” Draco nodded, totally deadpan. “Just what was needed. Strays.”</p>
  <p>“Although?” Potter shrugged and rolled his eyes, although not at Draco in particular. “With Snape-ity-Snape-Snape, who knows, yeah? This could just as easily be mummified Kneazle fur under influence of a Focussed Revivify. But I think it’s far more likely Snape’s precious pet has been allowed in here recently. Though I must say I’m perplexed  there’s not more stuff on the carpet. We should check, you know.”</p>
  <p>“Ah,” Draco said, glancing about to make sure they’d not missed any of the items Snape had set to them to Ponder. “Wouldn’t be surprised if he’s left the creature it came from still in here. Snape’s surprisingly fond of his Percival Leopold Sweetums. Little devil’s allowed to go everywhere and anywhere he pleases. Without so much as a by your leave.”</p>
  <p>No cat, nor Kneazle, however, was evident, despite both the Unspeakables present actively leaving their seats and searching. Well, not searching precisely, but more having a bit of a leg-stretch, at least in Draco’s case. <em>Tea</em>, he thought. <em>Tea would be nice</em>.</p>
  <p>“I could,” Draco mentioned, mid-search, “murder another cuppa, right about now. Perhaps a break might be in order, Potter? As we’re already up and about.” </p>
  <p>“...Um,” Potter mumbled, unhelpfully, having gone down on his hands and knees to peer under the table in search of the felonious feline.  With an internal groan, Draco tore his eyes from Potter’s arse and returned them forcefully to the table’s contents, feeling only mildly thwarted. “Meh, nah-uh,” Potter went on, in a muffled sort of voice. “Not yet. Er...ah?”</p>
  <p>“Right, then.” Draco raised a curious brow at Potter’s antics; the fool had evidently crawled to the other side of the table and was making a bee-line across the carpet for the rows of cabinets, still on his hands and knees. Draco could only imagine the intent gleam in those bottle-green-glass eyes. “Maybe later.” He looked again at the 'items', all arrayed and blinked at them, mentally sorting through all he knew and Knew and recalled and remembered, seeking an opening, a hook to the puzzle Snape had left them.</p>
  <p>The collection strongly reminded Draco of the strictly limited ‘official’ training Ponders Madame S had set her lot of ‘baby’ Unspeakables to in the early days of their coursework, whilst they were all still treated as all ‘round Ministry Trainees: common, confusing and drab; ill-assorted, mundane and a bit boring, at least on the surface.</p>
  <p>But still, there’d always been some deeper connection, some tenuous trail that would lead to a resolution. Sometimes many resolutions and not all of them immediate. Perhaps not a clear-cut answer, but always a resolution. Not surprisingly at all, that had proved a boon to the budding Aurors in the group. Weasley and Granger had wallowed in it, practically, and even a few Slytherin renegades like Theo had been heard to mutter that Unspeakables were really just failed Aurors. Of course, he and Blaise both had much rather preferred Games and Pansy had been faffing about for ages about transferring over to St Mungo’s for a Healer’s Apprenticeship. Still...</p>
  <p>Madame had been quick to point out that they were wrong, <em>very wrong</em>, about that idea.</p>
  <p>‘Unspeakables,” she’d snapped emphatically, her gnarled wand very much in evidence, “are the backbone of the Ministry. Kindly keep in mind always that there is no heart without a head and no action without motive. An Unspeakable’s job is to know the whys of a matter, for ultimately it is the whys that determine the wherefores!”</p>
  <p>That, Draco was convinced, was the very best aspect of becoming an Unspeakable: the closure, the seeing of what others could not see, the ineffable feeling of knowing those whys, all of them, even if the knowledge itself proved to be trivial. Or apparently trivial.</p>
  <p>And he’d been aware, even then, that he’d been nursing a sneaking suspicion that Potter shared his enthusiasm for both the hunt-and-chase <em>and</em> the prize at the end of a decent Ponder for quite some time. And Ponders were by nature deceptive. Rather like Potter.</p>
  <p>“Well, this is a--” he said, jerking himself abruptly back in focus and seeking words that might provide a framework for the current puzzle set before them. Potter meanwhile sprang up and brushed off the lint that had clung to his trouser legs. “A domestic, that’s what. It’s all very domes--Merlin, what I need is <em>tea</em>. This is not so much a Ponder, Potter, as unmitigated torture and only tea will make it better. You must agree with me, don’t you?”</p>
  <p>“Well...alri--oh, wait! One more, hang on,” Potter interrupted, departing the cabinets and abruptly bustling to bend over the table once more. “Here--right here,” he said, using deft fingers to sweep aside the pervasive miasma of gingery fur. “I saw them earlier but nearly lost them to the Kneazle hair, sorry. It’s dominoes. Magical. Old ones; some of the dots are worn quite off and the Runes are polished smooth from use. Funny thing is, they’re arranged in an order, I think. Artfully--<em>on purpose</em>. Like--like a structure.”</p>
  <p>“On purpose?” Draco frowned and drew closer. “What structure, Potter?”</p>
  <p>“I think so.” Potter gestured vaguely, waving his hand over the surface of the table. “I mean, just look at them, Draco; don't they remind you of something? Some <em>place</em>, rather? It’s Stonehenge, that’s what! Come round and have a look from over this side, will you? It’s all in the angle of view.”</p>
  <p>“Yes, alright, hold your Thestrals,” Draco said, tilting his head inquisitively and slipping round to stand next to Potter. He bent his head down, just as Potter was doing, and peered sideways and squinting at the apparently haphazard heap of ebony rectangles along a much lower sight line. It revealed a visual effect of making the scattered oblongs appear much larger, and made it as though the table itself was a horizon line.</p>
  <p>As if, in fact, the dominos were massive slabs, rendered in miniature. “Oh!” he exclaimed, suddenly just as excited as Potter was. “Oh, yes, I <em>do</em> see. Stonehenge, definitely. Weird, what? With Beltane coming up and all.”</p>
  <p>“Yes! Isn't that weird, Draco? I love it when it’s weird!” Potter grinned hugely. “Best part of a Ponder is when it’s weird, right? Good old Snape, he never lets us down!”</p>
  <p>Draco reared stark upright and staggered back, staring wide-eyed at Potter. He was only partly teasing, some of the surprise was very real.</p>
  <p>“Wait, what? Pardon me, but what did you just say? ‘Us’, as in ‘you and me’ us, the camaraderie sort of ‘us’, Potter, and now you’re expressing  jollity over what Snape’s done to this Ponder? You're acting as if Snape’s our best mate best mate now? I must ask--are you feeling quite well? Because that’s highly unlikely. Highly!”</p>
  <p>“Well, um,” Potter mumbled, reddening and suddenly developing shifty eyes, “I’m just saying, that’s all. As a possibility. I mean, you know he likes to surprise people, Malfoy, and not all of those are meant to be unpleasant. And I have known him to make a joke, now and again. Usually at my expense, yes, but not always.”</p>
  <p>“What in the merry Ethos is wrong with you, Potter?” Aghast, Draco scowled, thumping the flat of his hand down perilously close to the dominos. “Severus Snape clearly doesn't like you! Never has, never will! Why would he ever care about us in connexion to the Beltane Gala? Bloody absurd!”</p>
  <p>“But!” Potter gasped. “There’s evidence that supports a quite different hypothesis, Malfoy! For instance—“</p>
  <p>“For that matter,” Draco thundered on, “he barely tolerates <em>me</em> and that’s only because Mum’s got a Witches’s Eye on him! Why would he <em>ever </em>consider doing anything that might please <em>you</em>, in particular? That’s bloody mad! Not to mention pretty bloody self-centered, old Pot. Snape’s all about results, and only results, my dear deluded colleague; he’d hardly care if we collectively keeled over from ennui providing it got the job done. I can’t as I see him making jokes in this matter.”</p>
  <p>“Er,” Potter said, looking chagrined. “About that.”</p>
  <p>“About what?” Draco glared, narrowed-eyed, lips pursing. “What, Potter?”</p>
  <p>“Er, look, I'm sorry, but I always forget you didn't know. Though I suppose there’s no way you could've--they never told anyone but me about it and I was sworn to secrecy. Although, come to think of it, you did know, at one time, but then what with the Pensieve Protocol Program, you probably removed your memories of anything to do with it and--”</p>
  <p>“Oh no you don’t Potter,” Draco said, waving an accusing forefinger at the offender. “Just stop right there--I don’t require any massive revelations this morning. No earth shattering outburst, no emotional archeology! We have one job to do, remember? Let’s just carry on and go find tea after. Shut up. Do. Just...please.”</p>
  <p>“No, really, it’s like this, Draco,” Potter insisted. “You actually need to know this so we can do our job, Protocol be damned! Stonehenge is important--to us, Draco.”</p>
  <p>“The fuck I do,” Draco replied. He crossed his arms over his chest and sneered roundly. “I already know more than I want to, Potter, and certainly more than I ever asked for, especially when it comes to you!”</p>
  <p>“The fuck you <em>do</em>, Draco! And I hate that I have to tell you this all over again every few months, but I do, and I must, and <em>you</em> must, and I <em>am</em>!”</p>
  <p>“Bah,” Draco growled, choosing a chair and thumping his arse into it with obvious reluctance. “This is completely against my better instincts, but. Completely against Protocol, too, buit, as you insist, Potty. Go on, then.”</p>
  <p>“Right, okay, it’s like this,” Potter flailed his arms briefly, beginning to pace. “Spice and Snape divvied up the Unspeakable training, way back in the beginning. And <em>I </em>sort of ended up being divided up between them, actually. Lecture-wise at least, while you and the others were with Spice most all the time. But I got Snape in droves, probably because he thought I was going to prove a liability to DOM, right from the start, and he likely talked the Minister in agreeing with him.”</p>
  <p>“Like that’s never happened before,” Draco murmured, nodding intently, his face utterly blank. “<em>You</em> being treated as a special case by the authorities. No, never.”</p>
  <p>“Shut up,” Potter said, flipping Draco a quick bird as he impatiently trotted back and forth on the carpet. “Anyway, my Legilmens and Occulmens were never all that good, really, and maybe it also had something to do with helping him save his own life and all that, but really it just meant I had more lessons. Double, maybe even triple the lessons, for the love of Merlin. Not that that was a bad thing, as it wasn’t; I mean, Hermione was insanely jealous--well, she was until Snape asked her to give him the Pensieve memory of that knowledge. So, in the end, no one knew about all of that but me and Snape. And, well, we weren’t exactly chums or anything like, but he at least was civil and sometimes even sort of…funny. In a good way, not mental!” he added quickly when Draco snorted derisively. “But, that’s why I say this, about the joking and about Snape. That, that, he’s <em>not</em> a bad egg when it comes to being our boss--and that he’s far from hating <em>me</em>, Malfoy.”</p>
  <p>“Pshaw, Potter,” Draco scoffed, shaking his head at Potter’s hopeful look. “I recall differently--seven full years of ‘differently’. That sort of deep-seated resentment lingers, you know?  Of course, who am<em> I </em>to protest the word of the great Harry Potter? If you say Snape’s your mate, then of course Snape’s your mate. I just think you may want to be checked over in the Infirmary, is all. We’re Unspeakables, you know, not Unreasonables.”</p>
  <p>“Stop that.” Potter shook his head. “I’m not joking about here, Draco. Be serious.”</p>
  <p>“Or Irrationals,” Draco chuckled darkly. “Wait--there’s another  joke for you, Potty, should you be seeking to lighten the atmosphere. I know I am. Much too dramatic, al the sudden.”</p>
  <p>“Just, stop, will you? Stop acting like this is a totally unheard of concept, Draco,” Potter said firmly, ceasing his pacing and coming over to jab an admonitory finger at Draco’s elevated nose. “Regardless of how many times you’ve conveniently ‘forgotten’, you still retain a basic sense of our recent shared history! Don’t change the subject and don’t you dare try to distract me!”</p>
  <p>“Our recent shared shagging, you mean. And it’s not convenience, it’s Protocol. With a capital ‘P’, P-P-Potter.”</p>
  <p>Despite Draco’s very blatant yawn and pronounced shrug, Potter continued to jab the air not an nth from Draco’s flaring nostrils, going a little pink around the edges.</p>
  <p>“No! <em>Of course</em> Snape’s not my fan or anything like, but he’s a brilliant instructor when he’s not actively hating a bloke, you know? Which he’s not. No matter how much you’d like to use that to colour your perceptions, Draco.” He sent a look of impatience Malfoy’s way. “And our shagging’s not ‘recent’, so don’t say that it is.”</p>
  <p>“Potter, I don’t—I mean, do we really have to go there, right now?”</p>
  <p>“Of course you <em>do</em> know; he’s always gotten on with <em>you</em>. But yes. He set me up with some brilliant Ponders, really good ones. Not to please me, per se, but to teach me, you see? Lessons. Not that Spice’s weren't interesting, because they were,” he went on earnestly, nodding happily as Draco slumped as far back into his seat as possible, eyes crossing slightly as he aimed to look defeated by Potter’s rhetoric. It was a struggle but Unspeakables were trained in artful dissimulation, so he managed. Mostly. It helped that he felt defeated by the pointlessness of Potter’s point.</p>
  <p>“Potter, please, <em>please</em>—I’m quite convinced, really I am. Can we please just get on with it?” Draco cast an appealing look at his relentlessly energetic opponent. “We have work to do yet, remember?”</p>
  <p>Potter, however, persevered.</p>
  <p>“I mean, she was a decent instructor, definitely, but Snape shows some real verve when it comes to whipping up a solid Ponder." He frowned thoughtfully. "Must be why he's been made Head, yeah? Aptitude. Oh, and probably experience too, come to think.” </p>
  <p>“Oh, no, no, Potter.” With a quiet moan, Draco gave in to his primal urge, shoved Potter’s arm out of the way, and simply laid his own fretful, achy head right down on the table, nestling his smooth-shaven cheek against the polished wood. The surface was cool and therefore soothing. It muffled his next words somewhat but that hardly mattered. “Do cease and desist.  This is all very fascinating but I need my tea to process it.” He opened one eye and peeped hopefully at his co-worker. "Or yours? Please?"</p>
  <p>“You don’t need tea, Malfoy,” Potter rebuked sternly, giving Draco a firm pat on the back. “You just need to remember. You need to remember a lot of things, really. And probably stop being so dramatic about resisting it--and <em>me</em>. I’m not giving up, you know.”</p>
  <p>“I now you’re not. My head hurts, Potter,” Draco mumbled, mentally scoring Potter a point for being spot-on about the ‘dramatic’ but also not really caring all that much about the small victory. Sometimes he had to do ‘dramatic’ in order to counteract Potter’s own version of drama. Potter was dramatic in a very passive-aggressive way. “What with how you’re not giving up, alright? I am fatigued. Fagged out, even. And yes, I do need tea, as it happens. Tea is happiness, tea is peace, tea is you not talking in circles about the things I chose not to recall when you know that I really shouldn’t be recalling them a’tall and, further, <em>and </em>most importantly, tea will allow me an excuse to go elsewhere and speak to others about things which don’t include your status, my misconceptions, our affairs or Severus’s treatment of his employees. Lastly, as you know, and as I have told you, it always pains me deeply when I am forced to recall that you are the Department’s ‘special case’, Potter. If you know all this other shit, then you know that as well.”</p>
  <p>“Hey! It’s not as though I was ever doing it deliberately, Draco,” Potter protested, although he’d the grace to flush. In fact, had been flushing, from the moment Draco mentioned ‘affairs’. “I mean, you did know, once upon a time…maybe? At least I think you did. You just Pensieved it, the memory.”</p>
  <p>“Lies,” Draco countered, raising his head unwillingly and glaring. “And falsehoods. You do this deliberately, like clockwork, whenever you’re ticked with me and you know it.”</p>
  <p>“No, I don’t. As to that, Snape just...just informed me, I guess, on the very first day, right after we’d been Sorted,” Potter stated firmly. “It’s not as though I had a choice in the matter. Just as he informed me you’d only agreed to become an Unspeakable if I agreed to let you use the Pensieve Protocol for your personal shit--”</p>
  <p>“Yes, alright,” Draco agreed quickly. He stood up, feeling it was high time he paced the room and returned the favour by making  Potter uncomfortable with his own bustling.  “Let’s skip ahead now, shall we?” He waved his arms about, making shooing motions. “Tickety-boo, here we go: we have dominos which look like Stonehenge, we have a questionable diary, there’s some Kneazle fur fucking up our nasal cavities and a motley of other miscellaneous Mugglery. Ultimately, I require tea. Question is, are we supposed to get anything pertinent from this mélange? Does Snape <em>want</em> us to? Is it an exercise to a purpose? Or are you just selfishly forcing me down memory lane to no purpose, Potter, with all this talk of ‘special’ this and ‘secret’ that? Because I can’t say as I appreciate it. I Pensieve certain things for a reason, as you know, plus it’s Protocol--”</p>
  <p>“Yes, yes,” Potter exclaimed, throwing up his hands and assuming a major frowny-face. “There’s a point, Draco, of course there’s a point. And that is--”</p>
  <p> </p>
</blockquote><p>Now, here’s the thing, the real reason behind even bothering to Pensieve this particular Ponder: why on Gaia’s green earth would Potter even want me to know all this gloriously inane backstory? Why would he <em>care</em>? We work well together--yes, Potter, we do, I admit it--and we accomplish our duties as required. Snape’s never once shown any interest in me knowing any more than I already vaguely recall about what happened after the final Battle. And I cannot for the life of me remember a single real instance where me knowing about the Felix or the Bezoar or that damned kiss you tricked me with, Potter, have ever impacted what I do for a living!</p><p>Granger, do not even go there. Not a word!</p><p>What I do remember, I remember unwillingly. And I certainly do not dwell!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p>“--that is, that you aren’t complete, Draco. You’re in denial, alright?” Potter accused.  “You are using the Pensieve Protocol to hide from us, <em>from me</em>, fuck it all, and you seem to have not a fucking ounce of shame in your twisted little soul for doing so! Fucking coward.”</p>
  <p>“Potter! Potter, calm yourself, please,” Draco said hastily, catching at Potter’s rising arm to force it down. He needed no more jabbing fingertips, ta ever so much, and he certainly needed Potter to stop shouting.</p>
  <p>The flat of his hand slid up the arm and somehow over to Potter’s heaving chest; he kept it laid there, long fingers spread out, silently willing Potter to listen.</p>
  <p>“Just—please, Harry? You’re irrational. Or, if not irrational,” he inserted, as Potter twitched at him, “certainly upset. That is absolutely the last thing I’m doing, running away or hiding,” he said, as sternly and as convincingly as he could manage in the face of a now quiet Potter’s searching gaze. “Malfoys are many things, yes, but we are not cowards. I’m cognizant that we have--pardon, have had, been having, likely will have, ahem--” he inserted, flinching a little at the jade-gold flare up in Potter’s eyes. “A...uh. Aahhh. Er. Relations.”</p>
  <p>“Oh, really?” Potter jacked up an eyebrow in a skeptical way, pursing his lips. “Is that what it is, then? ‘Relations’. Fancy.”</p>
  <p>Draco gulped. He truly hated to attach the word to it, what it was and had been, but there wasn’t another that suited. But it somehow seemed that he hated Potter’s flat tone and skeptical look even more.</p>
  <p>“Fine,” he said hastily. “To put it plainly, yes, we are in midst of an affair. I’m not avoiding it, Potter--fuck’s sake, Harry, as you’ve brought us to this yet again when we shouldn’t even be thinking about anything else much less discussing it when there’s real work to done, but--but. <em>But</em>. It has to stop now. It must. Now’s not the time to--”</p>
  <p>“But me no buts, Draco Malfoy,” Potter sliced in, shutting Draco down mid-syllable without an apparent qualm. Lips twisting sourly to match the dark furrow of his brows, he nodded sharply at Draco, flicking a fingertip scornfully at Draco’s hand still resting upon his breast bone.  “You can talk all you like, probably talk circles right around me, as always, but the fact remains--”</p>
  <p>”The fact remains, <em>Harry</em>,” Draco rushed in return to speak over Potter, “that work is work and shagging is shagging and the twain shall not meet. At least not in the office and not on the job. And that’s Snape saying that and not just me, Potter, so you can put that in your fucking cauldron and fucking counter-clockwise <em>puree</em> it!”</p>
  <p>“There is no hard and fast rule about that, Draco! And we are not at work all the fucking time, either!” Harry threw off Draco’s hand with an impatient gesture.</p>
  <p>He stepped back and turned away, his back squarely turned.</p>
  <p>“There’s plenty of times we could’ve discussed it, Draco. What you’ve been doing—why you don’t want to remember things.”</p>
  <p>Even angry and as tense as he was, Draco admired it, Potter’s back. It was shapely, as was the better part of Potter, and he desired to touch it, to run a soothing hand across the strong lines and the flowing folds of uniform cloak which obscured them. That he was often able to do just as he longed to at the moment made no difference, though--at <em>this </em>moment. This was work and that was personal and he’d gone to great lengths, he was certain, to ensure that there’d never be cause for dismissal--for either of them.</p>
  <p>“That’s an excuse and a paltry one at that. You’ll have to do better.”</p>
  <p>“No.”</p>
  <p>Draco  neatly shoved the protruding chairs beneath the lip of the long abandoned table. The slight scrape of wooden feet across the flooring did nothing to ease the tense atmosphere; they seemed to have gone from petty squabble to complete disarray in only a matter of moments.</p>
  <p>“No,” he repeated quietly. He closed his eyes for a long moment, smelling disaster in the stale air of the chamber. But he couldn’t care about that, not in the moment; he couldn’t afford to. “No, sorry. This is inappropriate. And I’m leaving, Potter. Done for the day. I will see you tomorrow. Perhaps when you’ve had a chance to reconsider, hmm?”</p>
  <p>“<em>N-Not</em> alright,” Potter shuddered, choking it out as if crying. “No!”</p>
  <p>It halted Draco right in his tracks, stayed his hand where it rested on the door knob. It panged him, right in the heart of him, but he couldn’t give in. That way lay a certain madness, and he’d had more than his fair share of madness.</p>
  <p>“Not alright a’tall, you fucking coward!”</p>
  <p>Potter spun about and sprinted nimbly around the table, fetching up abruptly at Draco’s shoulder.</p>
  <p>“I called you a coward because you are a coward! You’ve been running since I bloody caught you the first time and it’s time you--it’s past time you! Stop. Fucking. <em>Leaving</em>. Me!”</p>
  <p> </p>
</blockquote><p>This. This, right here.</p><p>This is where I truly resent the Ponder Pensieve Protocol. This shedding of supposed ‘non-essential’ information, you know? On the surface, it seems so logical, doesn’t it? I mean, there’s memories that no one wants to relive, over and over, and one can only take so much Dreamless or go through so much talking to Healer, and still, some things linger. They shape you, Potter--<em>Harry</em>.</p><p>They change you, down to the bone.</p><p>And I have to say it, though I hate to say it, even off-record, but it hurts, Harry: I’m not the one who’s been running, <em>you are</em>.</p><p>It’s always been you--retreating. Teasing! You dance around it, you treat it casually, as if it’s perfectly normal, to be shagging one’s co-worker, one’s schoolmate, one’s old enemy, and to be doing it so obviously, so much out in the eye of the world, unashamed and irreverent. Practically under the eye of Snape of all people--and of <em>you</em>, Granger, and for Merlin’s sake, kindly have the courtesy to pull your head out of this fucking Pensieve, alright? If you’ve not left off already, that is, and I pray Merlin you have, as my friend, at least.</p><p>Alright, then. Let’s stop mashing the fucking flobberworm to jelly and just get down to giving you what you really wanted--what you wanted when you created that scene, just now--<em>Harry</em>.</p><p>Harry, I suppose this <em>is </em>a sort of apology. As much of one as I can make, at least. You claim I’ve been deliberately forgetting, that I’ve been using the system to insulate myself from what we’re doing, what it means to both of us when we do it… You claim this, but you aren’t helping matters. It’s too easy for you. Potter--circumstances have made it too easy, yes, and I know it’s not your fault, so much, but it’s also your job to be aware. To not place the blame squarely on me, when I’m only trying to keep us in some level of balance, some manner of stability. Salazars’ ballsack, Harry, we both need that, the calmness, the peace. You know it.</p><p>I don't mean to hurt you, not even a little. Farthest thing on my mind, last thing I could want, ever. But please don't hurt <em>me</em>. Don’t say I’m leaving you when we both know I’ll never leave you, not by choice, damn it, and not by chance, either!</p><p>Certainly not due to some minor squabble over a bunch of ancient dominos and a single Pensieve Memory!</p><p><em>You</em> started it, you see. You kissed me. Granted it wasn’t the most romantic of moments; surviving Fiendfyre by the literal skin of our teeth isn’t exactly mood-making. And you being fucking practical and even Slytherin-like in sharing that last mouthful of Felix didn't really tip me off to your undying fascination with yours truly. At least not at <em>that </em>moment, Harry.</p><p>I didn’t know. I can honestly say that. I mean, of course I knew there was something between us. There’s always been something between us. I can’t deny it and I wouldn’t. But I certainly never connected your previous behaviour with any sort of loving-kindness, Potter. And I can’t make the case for mine being exactly blatant and obvious, either. You couldn’t have had a clue as to why I didn’t admit to knowing you or why I gave up my wand so easily. You clearly had no idea why you were never confronted or punished for that bloody Curse in Myrtle’s loo, either. Snape was fucking livid and I…I told him to leave it. And you? You wrote off years of teasing and adolescent attention-seeking to me just being some ‘selfish’ and ‘evil’ git, like it was normal, the level of so-called animosity between us.  Reduced it to Slytherin Cunning versus Gryffindor Pride and endless rounds of pointless ‘rivalry’. Which is ridiculous, totally absurd. But. You’ve always been bloody oblivious, Potter; why should<em> I</em> go out of my way to enlighten you?</p><p>But <em>you</em> did it, <em>you</em> kissed <em>me</em>. Sometimes I’d almost have rather you’d <em>Kissed</em> me, as Dementors do.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
