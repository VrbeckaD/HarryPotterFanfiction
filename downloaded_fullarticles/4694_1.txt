    <p>Serena is curled in her armchair reading when a tabby cat jumps onto the windowsill, stares through the glass at her and then slips through the open window. She doesn’t bother to look up, even when the cat transforms into a witch in long black and emerald robes, just continues to the end of the page then closes the book with a snap.</p>
<p>‘Wine?’ she asks, unperturbed, picking up her own empty glass and heading for the kitchen.</p>
<p>‘Please.’</p>
<p>‘How's Annie?’ she calls.</p>
<p>‘She's fine. Ellie?’</p>
<p>‘Your guess is as good as mine. She only writes when she wants something.’</p>
<p>Serena comes back to find Minerva sat in the other armchair, staring into the empty fireplace.</p>
<p>‘Here,’ she says, passing her a full glass and settling again. ‘Now, what’s so important you couldn’t send an owl?’</p>
<p>‘I can’t just visit an old friend?’</p>
<p>Serena doesn’t answer, just raises one eyebrow and waits.</p>
<p>‘Your ex husband has started working at the Ministry.’</p>
<p>‘What, Edward?’</p>
<p>‘Unless you’ve been hiding another,’ Minerva says drily.</p>
<p>‘Doing what?’ Serena asks suspiciously.</p>
<p>‘A rather dull, low level desk job for the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol.’</p>
<p>‘You’re sure it’s Edward?’</p>
<p>Minerva nods, watching Serena’s incredulous expression over her wine glass.</p>
<p>‘He’ll never stick it, he’ll be bored out of his tiny little mind.’</p>
<p>‘That’s exactly what Hanssen thought.’</p>
<p>Serena stares at her friend. ‘You think he’s a spy,’ she says, and it isn’t a question.</p>
<p>‘We’ve been watching him for a while, ever since he turned up at a couple of meetings of Dark Wizards. He’s been spending quite a lot of time with Lestrange, Avery, that crowd.’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ Serena says distastefully. ‘He always was rather chummy with that lot. Or wanted to be, anyway. Never quite made it into their little gang though.’</p>
<p>‘It looks like he might be having another go. The Aurors thinks he’s trying to prove himself useful.’</p>
<p>‘Sounds just like Edward,’ Serena says, rolling her eyes. ‘And you’re telling me this because?’</p>
<p>‘Hanssen has spotted an opportunity. Edward thinks he’s gathering information on the activities of the Aurors to pass on, but intelligence gathering works both ways.’</p>
<p>‘Spying on the spy, hm? Just tempt him with a pretty young blonde, he never could resist.’</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>Three months and three women later, Minerva is back.</p>
<p>‘You think he had something to do with the latest attack,’ Serena says as she pours the wine. ‘The <em>Prophet</em> does deliver to France,’ she says at Minerva’s surprise. ‘I’m keeping up with events.’</p>
<p>Minerva nods, sips from the glass Serena hands her, smiles and hums appreciatively.</p>
<p>‘One of the perks of living in the Rhone,’ Serena says with a wink. ‘So, what can I do for you this time?’</p>
<p>‘Will you help us?’</p>
<p>‘With what?’</p>
<p>‘Edward.’</p>
<p>‘Can’t the Aurors just arrest him? They must have enough evidence by now.’</p>
<p>Minerva sighs, clearly displeased with what she’s about to say. ‘Albus still wants to try and use him, and Hanssen doesn’t disagree. It doesn’t look like he’s in the inner circle but after this he’ll have risen a little. He could be a valuable source of information in the coming months, more useful free than in Azkaban.’</p>
<p>‘Send in another blonde?’ Serena suggests.</p>
<p>Minerva shakes her head. ‘It hasn’t worked, Serena. He hasn’t let anything slip to any of them.’</p>
<p>‘Not like him,’ Serena frowns. ‘Usually he’d do anything to impress.’</p>
<p>Minerva hums noncommittally, sips her wine, looks anywhere but at Serena – so she doesn’t see the moment when the sickle drops and Serena’s eyes widen.</p>
<p>‘You want me to do it, don’t you?’ she asks slowly, flatly.</p>
<p>‘<em>I</em> don’t,’ Minerva mutters, voice tight with anger and distaste. ‘I think it’s a terrible idea.’</p>
<p>‘Dumbledore,’ Serena sighs, an edge of anger creeping in. ‘Albus <em>bloody</em> Dumbledore.’</p>
<p>‘There’s a secretarial position opening up in Auror Headquarters.’</p>
<p>‘Quill pushing, Min? That won’t work. I was always the ambitious one, he’ll never buy that as a reason for my moving. You get me something more prestigious and I’ll consider it. Although I don’t know why you think he’ll tell me anything seeing as he spent the entirety of our marriage lying to me.’</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>London isn’t how Serena remembers it being. The day before she’s due to start at the Ministry she walks through the Muggle streets to Charing Cross Road, pauses outside a shabby little shop on the corner and then pushes open the door and steps into the dingy bar. She knows things are bad when every patron’s eyes flick to her and then back to their drink or companion, and the barman stares at her with one hand clearly on his wand. She can’t help the shiver that runs down her spine, sets her shoulders and holds her head high and makes herself continue through to the courtyard.</p>
<p>When she steps out into Diagon Alley the normally bustling street is quiet. Even allowing for British reserve the people are withdrawn, keeping themselves to themselves. Gone is the friendly atmosphere of every previous trip, even when she brought Ellie here just a few summers ago. Instead witches and wizards shoot wary or even suspicious looks at everyone they pass, hurry from shop to shop with their heads bowed. Nothing Minerva told her, nothing Henrik wrote in his letter, nothing reported in the <em>Daily Prophet</em> prepared her for this, for the reality of a community at war with itself.</p>
<p>Serena pulls out her list and calls into each of the shops she needs. She’d planned to treat herself to a sundae at Florian Fortescue’s once she was finished, instead walks straight past and back to the Leaky Cauldron, orders a large glass of Shiraz and settles at a table in one dark corner, takes a sip and sighs heavily.</p>
<p><em>I wonder if Henrik deliberately neglected to mention how bad things are,</em> she thinks darkly, taking another, larger sip. <em>Probably,</em> she decides. <em>Oh well, it won’t be for long.</em></p>
<p align="center">*          *          *</p>
<p>Bernie’s eyes are glued to a memo that almost flew into the side of her head as she walks towards the lift, blinking away Monday morning bleariness to bring the words into focus. She’s so engrossed that she doesn’t see the witch already waiting, foot tapping with impatience, until she collides with her.</p>
<p>‘Sorry,’ she mutters, glancing up to meet a pair of unfamiliar dark eyes.</p>
<p>‘You look as desperate for coffee as I feel,’ the witch says with a small smile.</p>
<p>‘Hm,’ Bernie nods, eyes returning to her memo.</p>
<p>And then she looks at the witch again. There’s something familiar about her, and her sleepy brain struggles to work out where she’s seen her before, what it is that she recognises: her eyes, perhaps? Her jawline? The quirk of an eyebrow? Bernie shakes her head slightly and looks away before she can be accused of staring, knows she’ll place the stranger eventually.</p>
<p>They get into the lift together. Bernie smiles at a couple of colleagues and barely suppresses a yawn as they slowly ascend. Eventually only she, the witch she bumped into, and a young wizard from the Improper Use of Magic Office are left. They all step out onto level two, Bernie and the wizard heading in opposite directions while the other witch looks around, hesitating.</p>
<p>Bernie glances at her watch: she isn’t quite running late.</p>
<p>‘Know where you’re going?’ she asks.</p>
<p>‘Auror Headquarters,’ she replies with a frown.</p>
<p>‘This way,’ Bernie says with a jerk of her head. ‘I’m heading there anyway.’</p>
<p>They fall into step beside each other, passing office doors and enchanted windows (<em>scudding clouds today</em>, Bernie registers), turn a corner and pass through the heavy doors into the already buzzing office. Bernie is about to ask the witch who she’s here to see when Hanssen spots them and strides over.</p>
<p>‘Serena,’ he says, holding out his hand. ‘It’s good to see you again. I see you’ve already met Ms Wolfe.’</p>
<p>‘She was kind enough to keep me from getting lost,’ Serena smiles, eyes sparkling, before she turns and follows Hanssen to his office.</p>
<p>They spend a long time talking, Hanssen and Serena, Bernie notes as she gets on with her work, sipping the coffee she so sorely needed. She keeps glancing over, her eyes drawn to the other woman with her short, dark hair, black and crimson robes, elegant fingers gesturing as she speaks. Once or twice she’s caught out, Serena looking up and meeting her eye through the office window with an amused smile that makes Bernie blush and immediately look away.</p>
<p>Suddenly something clicks. Bernie pulls out her file on Edward Campbell, rifles through it and pulls out his wedding photo. She turns it over and reads the names on the back – ‘Edward and Serena’ – and then turns it over again and stares at the smiling couple. She’s twenty years younger, has longer hair but–</p>
<p>She glances across to Hanssen’s office again. <em>No, it can’t be. He wouldn’t invite Campbell’s ex wife in. Especially not without telling me. Would he?</em></p>
<p>She looks between the photo and the witch again, frowning, blushes and drops her gaze to her desk when Serena catches her eye and quirks an eyebrow, just so.</p>
<p>
  <em>Yes. It’s her.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>Instead of leaving as Bernie expects her to, Serena settles into an empty cubicle in one corner of the room, not all that far from Bernie’s own workspace. She reaches into her handbag and pulls out a quill and a bottle of ink, along with a small photograph that she pins to the wall, then picks up the first scroll from a towering pile and begins to read.</p>
<p>Serena’s still there, slowly working her way down the stack, scribbling notes in the margins, two hours later when Bernie stands up and stretches her back in a series of satisfying clicks and pops that draws a disapproving frown from Fletch in the next cubicle. Bernie picks up her mug and heads in search of more coffee, hesitating a moment before pulling out a spare mug adorned with a pattern of flutterby bushes and filling it too.</p>
<p>‘Thought you could probably do with this,’ she says, putting the flutterby mug down on Serena’s desk. ‘I don’t know how you take it but–’</p>
<p>‘Strong and hot’s all I care about on a day like today,’ Serena says with a smile, picking the mug up and inhaling deeply before taking a sip. ‘Mm, you’re a lifesaver.’ She pushes her chair out a little and turns, holding out her hand. ‘Serena Campbell.’</p>
<p>‘Bernie Wolfe,’ she replies, taking it, noticing that Serena’s fingers linger just a moment longer than necessary. ‘No relation to Edward Campbell?’ she asks innocently.</p>
<p>‘Unfortunate ex-husband,’ Serena says with a grimace.</p>
<p>‘My condolences,’ Bernie teases, but inside she's instantly on the alert. ‘Did you know he’s, uh, working just down the corridor?’</p>
<p>‘Not until this morning,’ Serena mutters. ‘Just what I need, to be crossing paths with him every day.’</p>
<p>‘Not an amicable split, I take it?’</p>
<p>‘Affairs, alcohol and lies, all on his part,’ Serena says with a wry smile. ‘But I got a delightful if infuriating daughter out of it, so it wasn’t all bad.’</p>
<p>Bernie follows her gaze to the photo of a girl, about fifteen, with long dark hair and Serena’s dimple in her chin. ‘Hogwarts?’ she asks, as if she doesn't already know.</p>
<p>‘Beauxbatons,’ Serena corrects. ‘My mother was French and determined I should go there, and Ellie and I moved back after the divorce. Now I’m rather glad she’s safely over there, away from all this,’ she adds, with a sweeping gesture around the busy room.</p>
<p>Bernie nods, sips her coffee. Wonders if Hanssen knew of Edward’s past infidelities when he suggested using young female agents to get intelligence from him and strongly suspects that he did.</p>
<p><em>If only it had worked,</em> she thinks ruefully.</p>
<p>‘Ms Wolfe?’</p>
<p>Bernie’s head snaps up at the quiet, firm voice to find Hanssen looking at her expectantly.</p>
<p>‘Sorry, I’d better go.’</p>
<p>‘I think you had,’ Serena smiles. ‘And I’d better get back to this.’</p>
<p>Bernie takes two strides and then turns back. ‘What is it you’re here to do, exactly?’</p>
<p>‘Keep you lot in order,’ Serena teases. ‘Apparently you’re not taking good enough care of your paperwork.’</p>
<p>Bernie flushes slightly, even though she knows the rebuke can’t be directed at her personally.</p>
<p>‘Don’t tell me you’re one of the culprits?’ Serena asks, but there’s a teasing glint in her eyes.</p>
<p>‘I don’t have all day, Ms Wolfe.’</p>
<p>‘Go on,’ Serena says with a wink. ‘I’ll scold you when you get back.’</p>
<p>Bernie smiles briefly then strides across the office, dodging colleagues and desks, gulps another mouthful of coffee and grabs her cloak from the back of her chair before jogging into the corridor after Hanssen.</p>
<p>‘So what do you make of Ms Campbell?’ he asks as they head for the lift.</p>
<p>‘Are you sure having Edward Campbell’s ex-wife in the office is a good idea?’</p>
<p>‘She’s very good at what she does, Ms Wolfe,’ he replies. ‘She comes with impeccable references, and there is nothing in her past to suggest she shares Campbell’s Dark leanings.’</p>
<p>‘Right. And you don’t think it’s at all suspicious that after spending most of her life living and working in France she just suddenly decides to come and work here?’</p>
<p>‘No Ms Wolfe, I do not,’ he says levelly.</p>
<p>Bernie feels Hanssen’s piercing gaze on her, keeps her own firmly fixed on the lift doors.</p>
<p>‘I have worked with Serena before, some time ago,’ he adds. ‘And Minerva has known her for many years. We both trust her, and I believe she has certain skills that mean she will be an asset to the department. Let’s not go making more work for ourselves worrying about her, hm?’</p>
