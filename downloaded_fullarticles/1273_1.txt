  <em>16 June 1984 </em>
</p>
<p>They were three years old when they met for the first time, one girl literally crashing headlong into the other in the woods near the boundaries of their fathers’ estates. One running from her reality, the raised voices, blunt slaps, and stinging hexes that filled her home; the other pursuing imagination and playtime realities that had been created with her sister. Pansy, who had ended up curled in a heap on the mossy, leaf-strewn floor of the forest, stared across the short distance to the other girl. Her green eyes widened and her salt-streaked cheeks gone pale with fear, were reflected deep within the curious honey coloured eyes of the stranger.</p>
<p>With a quick intake of breath, Pansy brushed her mussed hair from her face and bolted away, scrambling in the fear that any kind of human interaction evoked in her--particularly the unfamiliar. The other child merely tilted her head a bit and giggled before skipping away, Pansy already forgotten as she returned to searching for her sister in their game of <em> chhupam chuupai. </em></p>
<p>After that, dreams of citrine eyes plagued Pansy each night, bracketing her usual nightmares with an uncomfortable warmth and an unfamiliar peace. Pansy avoided the woods for a while after that, fearful of the unknown nearly as much as the familiar. But when the raised voices began to follow her out to the refuge she had built amongst the bulrushes, algae, and lily pads of the family pond, just beyond the view of the windows of the manse, she fled once more for the cover that the forest provided. She didn’t encounter the other child again and she soon began to think her just another dream.</p>

  <em> 23 November 1987 </em>
</p>
<p>As she grew older, so too did her magic and Pansy discovered an affinity for her natural surroundings, a connection with the earth and with the flora of the primaeval and uncultivated copse buried deep within the dense woods that sprawled over her father’s lands and into the adjacent property, with the beings that lived within it and the streams that flowed through it. With a mere thought and extension of her will, she could choose to help a budding flower grow and flourish, or heal a small scrape on the palm of a fallen wood nymph. All of this, she could do this just as easily as the grapevines and ivy could, with a little help from her, flow to surround her small form and hide her from those that might follow or seek her out with malicious intent.</p>
<p>Truly, though, any that followed her from her father’s household could be said to have malicious intent and Pansy vowed to hide her newfound abilities from her parents. Not only was she sure to be beaten for her ability to do something her parents could not, they were also bound to screech about how anyone or anything who was not a pureblood witch or wizard was beneath her and that, even if they <em> were </em>a pureblood, then there was still a hierarchy that she needed to consider, as well as multiple other questions: What was their stance during the war? What had their family and friends chosen to do during the war? What House had they been in? The list never ended. Pansy huffed a sigh and skimmed another rock across the water of the serene pool she sat by beneath a trickling waterfall. She watched somewhat apathetically as the ripples cycled out.</p>
<p>She was eight.</p>
<p>She didn’t <em> care </em> about bloody Houses or wars or blood status. She was long sick of raised voices. Tired of bruises that had to be covered with glamours by her mother when they hosted others for dinner parties, or  when they left the confines of their so-called home. She had learned early on to hold her tongue and to accept any blows, hexes, or jinxes that came her way. Dodging didn’t help matters. Ducking or running away only made it worse when it would catch up with her later on, by tenfold. Best to take any punishment meted out at the time and then disappear from sight.</p>
<p><em> Out of sight, out of mind </em> went the old Muggle saying, she’d heard repeated by those in the nearby village. Something else she’d probably be beaten for knowing of; anything deemed to be primarily Muggle was a no-go in her home, proverbs included. But she was semi-hopeful for her future. Afterall, in just three years’ time she would travel to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to begin her education. <em> Just another prison, </em> part of her mind whispered. <em> Freedom, </em> whispered the other. </p>
<p>There had been talk of late that she might be shipped off to Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, or even the fairly recently established--1963 if she recalled correctly--Escuela de Nuestra Doña Soler down in Catalonia. She scoffed and flopped backwards onto a pile of leaves she had gathered beside the pool. She didn’t want to attend any school other than Hogwarts, especially one named and created for a purported Seer who couldn’t even accurately predict and prevent the events of a civil war that half the free world had seen coming for decades. Even the wizards of Britain--<em> Britain </em>--had noticed that there were tensions brewing in Muggle Spain in the 1920s and 30s. Nevertheless, she had a feeling it wouldn’t matter in the end and that her mother would win this battle of wills with her father, as she had so many others in the past. </p>
<p>One of the bowtruckles that lived in a nearby elm tree crawled onto her chest and then up to her shoulder. Pansy twisted her head and glanced down at it with a slight smile. “Hello, little one,” she said, starting to reach a hand up towards it.</p>
<p>She startled in alarm as she heard the nearby crunching of the autumn leaves underfoot. A <em> human </em>foot by the sounds of it. Pansy tensed, frozen in place, then twisted and folded into the shadows beneath a rocky overcrop, pseudo-hidden in a crevice behind a curtain of hanging moss, praying to any god that might exist that she couldn’t be seen. The hanging moss  partially obscured her but anyone who truly looked in her direction would see her. There was no time to bolt if the other person entered the clearing. A slightly off-key but still pleasant humming could be heard as the footsteps drew nearer and Pansy tried desperately to breathe as quietly as she could. The bowtruckle trilled its confusion at her before settling within her hair to wait out whatever might occur.</p>
<p>Through the draping moss, Pansy could see a girl push gently through the vines hanging at the edge of the clearing. <em> Why had they let her through!? </em> </p>
<p>Pansy knew that the other girl had to be a witch as well, and she was bound to be a powerful one later in life at that. Pansy could practically see the magic flowing just beneath the other girl’s skin, pulsing and swirling, sparking with unfounded curiosity at the ends of her long, silky midnight hair. Blue-black, just like hers. And <em> oh </em> how long it was too. It was just like the kind her mother envied her for ever since she could remember. The hair that her mother used to pull relentlessly as she yanked the brush through it each night before Pansy was deemed “old enough” to do it by herself. But, oh, never let Pansy even think to cry out or whimper in pain, whether then, or now, on the rare occasion her mother deigned to visit her on the pretense of cultivating a “mother-daughter bond”. That would only make her mother angrier and restart the night’s brutal hundred strokes right from the beginning. The kind of hair that Dahlia Parkinson had sheared short in punishment last year when Pansy had upset her by daring to ask if she might play at Draco’s that weekend. The Malfoys were a highly respectable family and good for cultivation, but a <em> boy </em> ? Her? <em> Alone with him? </em> Never. She would <em> never </em>be allowed alone with him at her age. She was a pureblooded young lady and must always be chaperoned when she was with the opposite sex. </p>
<p>But the similarities between the two girls stopped with their hair. While Pansy already knew she would never grow tall, this girl was already long and willowy, almost wisp-like, even at their young age. Her skin was the color of the caramel candies Pansy’s Uncle Alphard was so fond of sneaking her way when he would visit, and her eyes were a brilliant amber that shone, even from this distance, captivating Pansy to such an extent that she let out a gasp. </p>
<p>Pansy immediately clamped her mouth tightly shut, her lips turning near-white as she bit them together in anxiety. The other girl turned those citrine eyes in her direction, her humming ceasing abruptly. A slight grin slid across her face, revealing a missing tooth which appeared oddly mundane and near uncanny in the girl’s beatific face. Carefully, ever so slowly, she made her way towards Pansy’s hiding spot. She stopped a few arm lengths away, as if she were giving Pansy a little room to breathe, like one might a cornered deer.</p>
<p>“It’s alright you know. You can come out. I won’t hurt you.”</p>
<p>Pansy trembled and shook her head, forgetting the bowtruckle hiding within her tresses. It chirruped its alarm as it held on with all its strength, trying to avoid being flung into what must have seemed like a great abyss to its widened eyes.</p>
<p> “Oh! You have one too! Daalee, would you like to come out?” An elderly bowtruckle stuck its head out from one of the pockets in the stranger’s dress and crawled into her proffered hand. “This is Daalee. He’s a bit older than most bowtruckles, but he’s my friend and likes to ride with me when I play in the forest. What’s yours’ name?” </p>
<p>Pansy gulped and blinked her eyes shut for a few seconds before answering. “I-I’m not sure. I’ve never asked. There’s a family of Kneazles that live nearby though, I know their names. Some of the wood nymphs told me.”</p>
<p>“Oh? My family has two Kneazles but I’ve never met any here in the woods. We have a Crup too. Do you like Crups? My sister named ours Scrappy.” At this the other girl rolled her eyes then resolutely plopped to the forest floor, obviously intending to stay for a while. “Personally, I think Pavlov would have been a much better name for a Crup. Don’t you think? Well, maybe you don’t. You’d have to know who Pavlov is. Do you know who Pavlov is? Most other magical folk don’t and I assume you come from a magical family too, since you’re in these woods and the Muggles rarely come through here. Old wards from our ancestors keep them out most likely. My Dad and Mum don’t really care about Muggles one way or another but from what I’ve heard most of the other families that live around here don’t like them. I’m Padma. Padma Patil. What’s your name?” </p>
<p>By this point, Pansy’s mind was spinning. Her fear had started to abate somewhat but the confusion! This girl....who was she? Padma Patil apparently<em> . </em> And why did she talk so bloody much? Her adrenaline dissipating, Pansy’s knees buckled and she too sank to the floor of the surrounding bosque. “Who in Merlin’s name is Pavlov? Oh!” Her hands jolted upwards at her assumed gaffe and she looked at Padma, eyes beginning to water. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have asked anything. I shouldn’t have cursed either. Please don’t be mad!”</p>
<p>Padma cocked her head back in the opposite direction it had been leaning, and spoke, her tone gentle. “Why in the name of Rowena’s tits would I give one whit if you curse or not? Neither of our parents are here and my sister certainly isn’t around to tattle on us. She doesn’t like the woods anymore. They’re too dirty for her. Personally, I think they’re fascinating and beautiful. There’s so much that you can learn out here! </p>
<p>“But...it’s okay. Pavlov was a Muggle scientist. He experimented with dogs. I read about him in our library. And you still haven’t told me your name.” The left side of her mouth quirked upwards, “You <em> do </em>have a name I assume?”</p>
<p>Pansy pulled her hands slowly down from in front of her face but was unable to stop the escape of a lone tear from her right eye. “Of course I have a name.” She wiped away the tear with frustration and heaved a sigh, folding her hands in her lap. The bowtruckle slowly began to emerge from her bobbed hair and move towards her clasped hands. “Pansy….it’s….I’m Pansy Parkinson.”</p>
