    <p>All was still in the abandoned KFC restaurant. Not a single rat to be heard. All of a sudden a bright light was seen through the kitchen window. A bunch of strangely dressed figures gathered in the heart of the kitchen, right in front of the golden chicken nugget statue. They fell to their knees and started bowing to the statue while saying things like 'Long live the Great Chicken' and 'Bless us, oh golden one'.</p><p>After 5 or so minutes they stopped their worshiping of the Golden Nugget and slowly stood up. An old man took off his hood and looked at the others who quickly mimicked his actions.</p><p>"Thank you all for coming to this sacred place this lovely evening. You coming here brings great joy to me." he said, his blue eyes shining with madness.</p><p>"Was this really necessary Albus?" an old woman with the worlds tightest bun asked.</p><p>"My dear, dear Minerva, of course it's necessary! We can't have those Death Munchers know where our secret meeting happen!"</p><p>"But meeting in KFC after closing hours and bowing to a golden chicken? Have you truly lost your mind this time!?"</p><p>"That's not really <em>my</em> fault. They called dibs on McDonalds first, you know that."</p><p>Minerva merely raised an eyebrow as her answer. Dumbledore quickly decided to change the subject less he became a nugget himself.</p><p>"As I was saying… Welcome minions, ugh, friends, yes friends, that's what I meant." They all decided to ignore the minions part. "I will now start the 31st annual secret meeting of the OotFC at KFC." There seemed an alarmingly large amount of pride in that sentence.</p><p>"Now lets see if we're all here... An old bat and a pissed off cat?" Snape and Minerva merely glared from their corner. "Oh there you are Severus. Moving on… A super-duper paranoid bestie, bunch of ministry minions, scarred underaged minions, puppies and that person in the corner. Check, check, check and… check!" He smiled to himself ignoring the glares his 'minions' aimed at him.</p><p>"So Mad-eye old buddy, old pal, what's Tommy-boi doing these days?"</p><p>The slightly younger but equally, if not even more, crazy old man stepped up. "He's bloody mad! He makes <em>you</em> sound normal Albus! And those minions of his… they have their own deity now… and that's not even the worst of it!"</p><p>Gasp. "Oh no, not their own deity! Don't tell me it's a chicken as well."</p><p>"It's much worse than that Albus, it's... a silver cow!", he yelled.</p><p>Minerva facepalmed while Dumbles and Moody stressed out over the silver cow. Snape just rolled his eyes.</p><p>"Uh, Professor? What does that have to do with him trying to take over the food chain?"</p><p>"Don't you see Harry? It has <em>everything</em> to do with it! Who knows what sacred powers could that cow be hiding!"</p><p>"Oh you're just being a drama queen now Albus. They're only doing this to annoy you and you know it."</p><p>"But Minerva…"</p><p>"Don't you 'but Minerva' me Albus! This little 'war' between the two of you has gone on for long enough! I told you to just give that boy a chance, but nooo, why ever would you do that!? He's an abused orphan who can talk to snakes and is more powerful than you. He<em>must</em> be evil!"</p><p>"I have a feeling like you're trying to tell me something." Minerva's eye started twitching.</p><p>"Don't even bother Minerva, he only listens to Moody and even then it's just to prove he's an even bigger drama queen than him."</p><p>"No one asked you anything Severus! Now where was I? Oh right, we simply can't let them get away with this!"</p><p>"But what can we do Albus? They got traps all over the place. No one can get through it unnoticed."</p><p>"But that's where you're wrong Kingsley. I have a plan!"</p><p>. . .</p><p>"And that plan is…?"</p><p>"Oh sorry Severus, I was just admiring this picture of a chicken nugget. Right! A plan… A plan for what?"</p><p>Everyone did that anime 'falling from stupidity of that action' thing.</p><p>"I think that's enough nonsense for one night. Now I'll finish this meeting if noone has anything against it." A pointed look to Albus stopped him before he could even say a word. "Good now let's do this 'worshiping' thing again so Albus won't complain how no one cares about the Golden Nugget and stop me from having my beauty sleep, <em>again</em>."</p><p>They repeated their actions from the beginning and slowly left the room.</p>
