    <p>Prologue</p>
<p>The light of a full moon shined through the only bared window of Number 4 Privet Drive as a snowy white owl stared sadly at a body lying motionless in the small room. Her head moving from side to side listening for any other sounds before rushing in, a not much larger hawk with light almost gold looking feathers joined her, a letter in his beck. The hawk looked angrily at the body before it as the owl nuzzled up next to her owner. As the larger bird dropped the letter he flew out of the room heading straight for the forest landing on an out stretched hand. The bird then began to cry and flap it's wings pulling on his owners arm causing the figure to step into the moon light revealing the tall figures muscular build and long red hair that seemed to shine in the moon light only his forest almost emerald green eyes out shining it.<br/>"Has something gone wrong?" a second figure asked walking out of the shadows to reveal a not as muscular male with mid-night black hair tied into a low pony tail.<br/>"I fear something has..." the first figure answered racing after his hawk as the panicked creature took off back to number 4.<br/>x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x<br/>Hedwig tried her best to get her master to at least look at her as he stared out at nothing. Her snowy white head snapping to the window of the room as the hawk that she ran into on her way home rushed thought the bars. A look of triumph on his feathered face as he landed next to her; the two birds now watching as the bars on the window turned to ash and two figures climbed thought before freezing in their tracks. "What have those muggles done to our little one?" the blacknette sobbed racing to the bed before shushing away the two birds so he could cradle Harry in his arms "Sal we're leaving" the taller male growled drawing his wand he casting a spell to keep the house a sleep in till they left, and another one to pack all Harry's things before teleporting then away.<br/>It was at 6 am July 31 that Albus Dumbledore was informed that the wards he had placed around Number 4 Privet Drive had fallen and there was no boy-who-lived when the order got there.</p>
