    <p>A great wizard once said, in one of his muggle novels “There was a long hard time when I kept far from me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth.”<br/><br/>There are numerous times in Severus's life that he would like to go back and try again, make another choice or avoid the mess all together. A Thousand small things said or done that looking back, the concise man would smack himself for. Moments in his life he would have taken back and made the 'right' choice. The better choice, the kinder, gentler choice.<br/><br/>Life was full of such choices and as the scholars claim — the flap of a butterflies wings could cause a hurricane oceans away. Maybe if he hadn't said that horrible word to Lily that day, or taken the mark he would be a different man. A man with a life and a family. All those thoughts where far too painful to dwell on and so Severus chose not to.<br/><br/>It was easier to do what he had to do to get through each day. To shoulder responsibilities and pain because — what else did he have to give? He had a debt to <span class="hiddenSpellError">Albus</span> and remorse for Potter and the mother the boy would never know.<br/><br/>One thing he wasn't sure if he would regret however, was getting <span class="hiddenSuggestion">piss</span> drunk with a soppy werewolf in mourning. That was something he was questioning if he would like to go back and hex himself stupid for.<br/><br/>It happened a few weeks after the death of Sirius Black. Severus hadn't been <span class="hiddenGrammarError">Blacks biggest</span> fan<span class="hiddenGrammarError">..</span>or fan at all, however, as much as he'd like to say that the mutts demise was welcome to him — he couldn't. Having devoted himself to the silent task of watching of Lily's wayward child, he saw the toll eluding the brash man had taken on the boy. Harry wasn't the only one suffering from Black's death, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Lupin</span> had seemed even more worn and faded than the moment he showed up on Hogwarts school grounds. Severus wanted to pass a few biting comments or drop a hateful line about '<span class="hiddenSpellError">Gryffindor</span>'s and their lack of self-preservation.' Somehow he just didn't have it in him to rub it in. He had told the mutt to stay put, but when did Sirius Black ever listen to him? Or anyone for that matter?<br/><br/>The order was reeling from the loss of an excellent wizard, a man who had been wronged once and left to rot, freed and forced back into a prison of his past. It was heinously unfair but then...life was unfair. Now the light was left to the put the pieces back together of those broken and suffering.<br/><br/>All the while, those responsible were feeling the boost of taking down one of Dumbledore's favorite <span class="hiddenSpellError">Gryffindors</span>.<br/><br/>That wasn't to say things in Voldemort's camp were better for his disciples. If anything the Dark Lord was growing more fanatical since his return and this madness was experienced by those loyal to him and those<span class="hiddenGrammarError">..</span>pretending to be. The loss of the prophecy had been the nail in the coffin for <span class="hiddenSpellError">Malfoy</span> and those most familiar to him, which Severus had the displeasure to be.<br/><br/>Severus stumbled through the <span class="hiddenSpellError">floo</span> of 12 <span class="hiddenSpellError">Grimmauld</span> places following a particular nasty <span class="hiddenSpellError">deatheater</span> meeting. Everything was hurting, and he couldn't even stand. All he desired was to find a place to curl up and die, <span class="hiddenSpellError">ok</span> that was a little dramatic. All he required was a place to hide and lick his wounds in peace.<br/><br/>However, that was not to be as there was at least one person currently in residence at the dusty old tomb that was the Orders home base.<br/><br/>And of course it had been Remus <span class="hiddenSpellError">Lupin</span>.<br/><br/>Damn the wolf and his incessant need to play nurse maid. Did he look like he needed to be manhandled? Or as <span class="hiddenSpellError">Lupin</span> would call it “helping” him to his feet. He was perfectly fine there on that disgusting rug with decades of <span class="hiddenSpellError">pureblood</span> over entitled Black filth. Severus could have gotten up anytime he wanted to. Perhaps he was enjoying the whimsical spinning of the cracked ceiling tiles above him.<br/><br/>But no, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Lupin</span> just had to arrive at the scene, kneeling next to him and being a bother, tending to his wounds. Severus would have slapped the infernal man's hands away had it not been for the tremors caused by prolonged <span class="hiddenSpellError">crucio</span>.<br/><br/>Bellatrix had been in rare form that night and the Dark Lord was all too ready to allow her to amuse herself. <span class="hiddenSpellError">Malfoy</span> had gotten the brunt of it for his failures, but she didn't like <span class="hiddenSpellError">Snape</span>. The witch didn't know how right she was with her hatred for him. From day one Bella always felt that he, as a half blood, didn't deserve the high position their Lord had given him. Although she was insane, so what went on in her crazy little head was a mystery. Perhaps one day he'd get the joy of proving her right by severing her head from her fool shoulders.<br/><br/>Until that blessed day however, Severus would have to put up with his lot in life as Dumbledore's favorite spy.<br/><br/>Still, Severus did not need to be cared for. He never needed it so why in the hell was he laid out on this old musty sofa and letting the wolf care for him? Honestly, this was a surprise to both of them.<br/><br/>For Remus, it was just about being needed again. He had felt so lost during those long years spent alone. Moving from place to place and taking whatever odd bit of work he could find, muggle or <span class="hiddenSpellError">wizarding</span>. Just barely making enough to feed and house himself. Getting Sirius back had been a gift. The love that tore his heart out that October night was vindicated and freed. But the Sirius who came back to him was not the man he was. Sirius needed him so much, and Remus was happy to oblige that need. Falling into the routine of caring for someone who, at times, could not care for himself. Perhaps this dependency was unhealthy, but he craved it and now it was over. That night he felt lower than ever and when the black clad man feels face first out of the fireplace, he jumped at the chance to help.<br/><br/>Honestly, Remus had always badly felt about how the other Marauders had treated <span class="hiddenSpellError">Snape</span>. Regrettably, they were just kids — kids making foolish choices based off what the surrounding adults had told them. <span class="hiddenSpellError">Lupin</span> had swallowed the bitter pill of his own cowardice in those days because possessing friends meant more than doing what was right.<br/><br/>Now it seemed that too much time had passed, and he would never be able to atone for the sins committed by his teenage self. Even so, he had to try right?<br/><br/>So that night, as he tended to the potion masters injuries, Remus poured his heart out. It didn't seem like Severus cared either way but at least he listened. If only because he was extremely tired and in too much pain to argue. After he had said his peace and finished forcing healing charms and potions on the man, he offered him a drink. They could both probably use one at this point.<br/><br/>“It will help you sleep.” He said pouring them both a glass.<br/><br/>Severus had agreed and shot back a barb “Perhaps it shall make me forget that sentimental drivel as well.”<br/><br/>One drink turned to two as they talked about the meeting Severus had been in, recent events, Hogwarts, Harry, and back around to the past. They perhaps were a bit too far into the bottle of Fire Whiskey by that point when Remus shed a light on some of <span class="hiddenSpellError">Snapes</span> old foes' behavior.<br/><br/>“You were cute in that <span class="hiddenSpellError">waifish</span> sort of way, James was just jealous of you because of Lily but Sirius. Well half the time I couldn't tell if it was because you were a <span class="hiddenSpellError">Slytherin</span> or because he fancied you. Maybe his was jealously too though.”<br/><br/>Severus snorted and took another drink. “What did he have to be jealous of? My, what was it he liked to call it? ' Great big bloody nose', or perhaps my 'disgusting greasy hair' that's flame retardant <span class="hiddenSpellError">crème</span> by the way. I have no wish to be lit a flame by a bunch of dunderhead students now nor did I then.”<br/><br/>The wolf cringed at the old insults, children could be so cruel to people they saw as different. Remus had never wanted to say such things or use the horrid nicknames that James and Sirius had picked out. “No, you see he was jealous because<span class="hiddenGrammarError">..</span>” Remus smiled over the rim of his glass. It was now or never, maybe if he was lucky Severus was drunk enough to forget about all of this. “I fancied you for our first three years.”<br/><br/>Well <span class="hiddenSpellError">Snape</span> hadn't expected that.<br/><br/><span class="hiddenSpellError">Lupin</span> sighed and set down his glass. “Forgive me if I've made you uncomfortable. I know you<span class="hiddenGrammarError">..</span>well it wasn't difficult to see how you felt for Lily.”<br/><br/>“Yes<span class="hiddenGrammarError">..</span>she wasn't the only one.” something in the back of his mind screamed at him to shut up but then there was that damn wolf making confessions. Why the hell not join the party? “There was...<span class="hiddenGrammarError">Regulus</span>. I'm sure Black would have killed me outright for that.” He hadn't told anyone about that in years, as if admitting it would somehow dredge up the ghosts of his past. Severus had done that same with Lily, hiding any feelings he had for her under cold glares and cutting words.<br/><br/>Remus just looked at him sadly. Those honey eyes gazed too woefully into his, it reminded him of the way Minerva had looked all those years ago when she found him weeping in the dungeons. His heart breaking for the last time for all the loves he had lost. For all the lies and anger that he couldn't contain. The motherly woman had just wrapped her arms around him and hushed him softly. That was the last time he cried in front of anyone.<br/><br/>“Severus...”<br/><br/>When <span class="hiddenSpellError">Snape</span> looked up he found that <span class="hiddenSpellError">Lupin</span> was now incredibly close to him, too close and yet something about the way the fire light danced over the shadows of scars on the mans face held him still. “What<span class="hiddenGrammarError">..</span>”<br/><br/>Remus had to take the chance, even if it blew up in his face. He couldn't bare another night alone in this house with all of these memories. “Just for tonight, you can tell me no right now if you want to, if I'm wrong I'll accept this and never say anything again But if you don't say it soon … I won't be able to stop.”<br/><br/>Stained fingers reached out and wound into the tatty threadbare cloth of the other mans robes. Severus should have pushed him away then. Of course, there was that one rare fact that the damn wolf wasn't wrong. <span class="hiddenSpellError">Snape</span> was just as tired of the loneliness and the emptiness, even if all this turned out to be been a single night of indiscretion. Perhaps it would be enough to take the edge of the countless more nights of silence to come. Enough to give him a reprieve from the self-loathing and anxiety that was his life. “Then don't.”</p>
