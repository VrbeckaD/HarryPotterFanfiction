          <div class="userstuff"><p><span>Draco looked in the mirror and stroked the blond tufts on his chin. He scowled when he remembered the jeery words Weasley had spouted this morning on platform 9 ¾ after the Hogwarts Express had left.</span><br/>
<span>While Astoria had been nattering on about a new cloak she’d seen at Twilfit and Tatting's, the four former Gryffindors had passed. The Weaslette had secretly stolen a glimpse from behind her ginger fringe, but her brother had been as rude as always.</span><br/>
<span>Loud enough for Draco to hear, he’d commented: ‘Bloody Hell! Malfoy looks just like one off those demented fauns, we saw in that movie the other day.’</span><br/>
‘<span>Ron!’ Granger had hissed but the two kids had giggled. Astoria had ignored it although Draco’d known that she was extremely irritated by the way she’d marched to the barrier with her head held high. He, on the other hand, had slowed his pace.</span><br/>
<span>As a result he and Potter were the last ones to go through the barrier. Draco had tried to avoid looking at him, his face still flushed an angry red, but Potter hadn’t let him.</span><br/>
‘<span>Malfoy?’ The famous green eyes had looked fathomless and had held his captured. ‘You know, you don’t need it.’ And to Draco’s surprise Potter had reached out and touched his chin for a single moment. ‘You’re nothing like Lucius, even without it!’</span><br/>
<br/>
<span>Unintentionally his fingers brushed the skin that still seemed to quiver. He wondered how Potter knew. Not even Astoria had figured out that he only tried to look different than his father had. She just complained that it made him look so much older.</span><br/>
<span>He stared at his image for minutes. His white blond hair pulled back into a ponytail. Gray eyes that could turn as cold as steel but now looked pensive. And the blond tufts on his chin, so light you could hardly see it from a distance.</span><br/>
<span><em>You’re nothing like Lucius! </em></span><span>Potters voice echoed softly.</span><br/>
<span>There had been a look of understanding before Potter had turned and passed the barrier, which gave Draco a funny feeling even now.</span><br/>
… <span><em>nothing like Lucius!</em></span><br/>
<span>With a tiny smile he nodded at his refection and reached for the enchanted razor his mother had given him for his seventeenth birthday.</span></p>
