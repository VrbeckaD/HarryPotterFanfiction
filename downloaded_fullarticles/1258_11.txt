</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Merula Snyde was a <em>royal </em>pain in Alyss Weaver’s ass.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Five years of a rivalry that she wanted <em>no</em> part in (something the antagonistic Slytherin girl seemed to take no heed of) and Alyss was pretty much fed up. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was mid-November, and Alyss had gone into the Great Hall entrance on the report that someone was bewitching the slush tracked in by students into hazardous black ice. Three sprained wrists and quite a few sore backsides later, and Professor Flitwick had dispatched her to deal with it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Reluctantly putting away her <em>fascinating</em> book on the persecution of Celtic Druids in the 1st Century and glaring slightly at the little ‘P’ on her robes (honestly, the things she had to put up with as a prefect, only last week it was a fire-spouting chandelier in the Ravenclaw Common Room), Alyss had grudgingly headed over to sort it out.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At first, everything had seemed in order. The corridor was empty and dark, with most students in bed, and no slippery surfaces in sight. Marching up to the double doors without incident, only a few small puddles of slush as per usual, Alyss promptly turned on her heel to go back to the Common Room and her reading when—</span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>WHAM!!</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alyss found herself flat on her back, seeing a few stars, and a giant ache forming on her head. Groaning, she squinted slightly and raised herself up on one elbow. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Out from the shadows in the corridor came a familiar face—and a familiar smirk.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Gotcha, Weaver!” Merula cackled mockingly, looking down at Alyss who was still sprawled on the floor. “Figured it was a matter of time before someone sent ‘lil perfect prefect Weaver over to put a stop to all those first-year dolts falling on their asses.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alyss simply stared at the other girl, slowly getting to her feet. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>By Merlin,</em> she thought, <em>I’ve had enough of Merula’s bullshit.</em></span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Taking a deep breath, she vanished the patch of black ice with a flick of her wand, not breaking eye contact with the Slytherin girl. Merula’s violet eyes were widened slightly, clearly not getting the response she had hoped or expected. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alyss stepped forward, gritting her teeth. “Listen, Snyde, I’m SICK and TIRED of this. You’ve proven time and again that you can’t beat me in a proper duel, so ENOUGH with your hexing me and my friends, let alone other harmless students!” She jabbed a finger into Merula’s chest, inching even closer. The other girl opened her mouth to speak, eyes narrowing, but Alyss simply raised her voice.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Your STUPID rivalry with me is half-assed at best! Five years of taunting me about Jacob, insulting Ben and the Weaslys…I’ve tried to be your friend and let it slide countless times… but I’m DONE. The next time you try and come near me I will jinx you so badly that you won’t be able to walk for a <em>WEEK</em>.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Breathing heavily, hearing her voice echo through the empty corridor, Alyss could feel her hand clenched tightly around her wand. She was standing so close to Merula that she could see the shocked expression on her face. Clearly, something in her voice or tone had some sort of impact on the Slytherin girl, as she had actually shut up for a change and seemed to be taking Alyss seriously.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That’s when she noticed the slight flush on Merula’s cheeks and how the other girl’s violet eyes had flickered down, now staring at… her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A few seconds like this felt like an eternity, but Alyss realized suddenly that her finger was still jammed into the front of Merula’s robes, and hastily stepped back, eyes still locked with the other girl’s. Her hands were shaking slightly and she could feel her anger churning in her stomach, along with some other… <em>unexplained</em> feelings.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Miss Weaver! Miss Snyde! I do hope there isn’t a problem here?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Professor McGonagall’s sharp, stern voice pierced the silence and Merula tore her gaze away, shook her head at McGonagall and stalked up the steps, scowling darkly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No, Professor,” Alyss said assuredly, feeling ridiculously guilty even though she hadn’t quite done anything wrong. McGonagall’s eyes narrowed slightly and she turned her head at Merula’s disappearing figure before letting out a small “Hmmph”, nodding and walking away.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Dragging her feet, Alyss headed back to the dormitories, not even picking up her book upon returning. Instead, she sank down in her favourite armchair and stared into the fire.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>The look on her face…I guess she’s never seen me that mad before</em>, Alyss mused<em>. But why did </em>this <em>incident set me off? All the taunts, all the hexing…Hell, I even saved her life back in first year after she tried to kill me with Devil’s Snare! I guess I have always made exceptions for Merula…even though she’s told me countless times that she doesn’t want my pity. </em></span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her stomach still churning, Alyss reluctantly headed up to her room. It was only once tucked into bed, failing to suppress the odd butterflies in her stomach and remembering how Merula’s flushed cheeks had looked under the candlelight that Alyss allowed herself to think of the other girl’s smirk fading away and those violet eyes fixated on <em>her</em> lips. There was no stopping it—despite trying desperately to ignore it, Alyss finally allowed herself to recognize her absolutely <em>massive</em> crush on Merula Snyde.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her last thought before falling asleep with a small smile was</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>Boy, was that girl ever a pain in the ass. </em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3"> </p>
