    <p>Severus Snape had seen Harry Potter before, as a small child, but the day he first saw the half-grown boy in the Great Hall at Hogwarts still resonated in his mind.  He recognized him instantly, and would have even if he'd never laid eyes on him before.  It was like a physical blow, like seeing James again after all those years, the resemblance was so horribly strong.  The hair standing up in untidy tufts, the round glasses ever so slightly askew, the scrawny, wiry frame - all were sickeningly familiar.</p><p>Quirrell was prattling away in his ear - or rather stammering – but Severus heard it as if from a great distance.  Blood roared in his ears and his sight, instead of growing dim as so often conveniently happened in books (Muggle romances and mysteries - not that Snape would know anything about those), actually sharpened instead to a crystalline clarity, focusing relentlessly like a telescope as Harry raised his gaze and met Snape's haughty stare with the half-guilty, half-defiant look of one who had been raised to regard his very existence as a crime, a look that echoed Snape's own miserable, unloved childhood back to him like a funhouse mirror – but the brilliant green eyes were Lily's, as exact a copy as the rest of the child's appearance was of James, and again he felt the impact as if he had been kicked in the stomach.</p><p>First Potions class, roll call, and Snape couldn't help himself, he drawled the dreaded name with a certain sneering condescension built up over the years in self-defense against the gibes of James and his hateful little crew: "Harry Potter."</p><p>The other children turned to look and the whispering that had been a low undercurrent since Harry first walked in swelled slightly to a low murmur. </p><p>"It <em>is</em> him!" They elbowed each other in disbelief.</p><p>It was unendurable, those eyes in that face, and when Potter said "Here," Snape felt queasy, but allowed no sign of his roiling emotions to show on his face as he gave a curt nod and lowered his eyes to tick off the name with furiously suppressed vehemence on his roster.</p><p>                        *                      *                      *                      *</p><p>The first year was tolerable, barely.  Snape was mostly annoyed by the boy's lax attitude towards his studies.  He was not without talent - expressed mostly in Charms and Defense Against the Dark Arts, as he didn't have the attention span or attention to detail for Potions - but he had no <em>drive</em>, no burning need to learn, to force him to push his limits.  He had a tendency to fly by the seat of his pants in lieu of studying, just the way he did in Quidditch - as his father had done - and to get away with it due to a combination of luck and good instincts.  (Some subjects were more tolerant of that than others.)  He <em>was</em> unusually lucky in general, and half the time that luck saved him when his lack of knowledge and experience should have led him to ruin.  This was both typical and typically unfair to those who had put in the effort - after all, hadn't he basically lucked into one of the greatest wizarding triumphs since Dumbledore beat Grindelwald?</p><p>Snape thought Potter had never done a hard day's work in his life, until one day he caught sight of his hands. They were not the hands of the idle – rich or otherwise – not that they were the hands of a common laborer, but he had known work.  They were a far cry from his father's hands. Snape shuddered internally and turned away. </p><p>                        *                      *                      *                      *</p><p>The second year it got worse, mostly because of the dreams.  Severus became an insect Lily crushed under her heel, and as if from outside himself he saw her face as she scraped off his remains, sharp with disgust in a look he’d never wanted her to have to wear.  Lily running and laughing, with Potter and his gang, carefree in the sunlight, while Snape rotted in the shadows, and grew malignant like a fungus.  That horrible moment when he'd come around the bend at Hogsmeade and seen them embracing, James with his <em>hands</em> on her, his <em>lips</em> on hers, and Lily saw Severus and sprang away from James like a cat, blushing and nervously fussing with her hair, while James looked straight at Severus and smiled, cocky, and raised an eyebrow as if to say, <em>I win again</em>.</p><p>He dreamed these scenarios, real and imagined, for months on end. Only when the school year let out did the nightmares lessen, but the first night after he saw Harry in the fall they came back with a vengeance.  He'd had them intermittently his entire life, ever since he lost Lily, but it seemed being in proximity to Harry exacerbated them, for obvious reasons.  As the term went on, the dreams went to the place they very rarely went, because Severus would not let them.  Lily faded away and James came to the forefront - James in the locker room after Quidditch practice in 5th year, when Severus was the ball-boy and general slave-rat to the Slytherin team (in his own House, for Merlin's sake!). He was scurrying around picking up towels and used jockstraps. Gryffindor had just beaten Slytherin – James had captured the Snitch after some four hours of hectic play, and here he was, flushed with victory and belatedly Severus became aware that they were alone in the room. He saw James's eyes upon him triumphant and glittering, drunk with power yet strangely, horribly calculating. The periodic dripping of water from the showers behind them was the only sound, echoing off the tiled walls like some kind of ricocheting prank by the Weasley twins, if they had been born then. </p><p>"Snivellus," James said, with a certain soft malice. The hated nickname seemed to rush around the room, gliding on its own sibilants as if it were Parseltongue.  Severus just looked at him warily and kept on picking up towels, careful not to turn his back to James.</p><p>James lounged against the lockers, wearing only a towel, and in the harsh light from the GymBeams, his bones stood out in stark relief, skinny hips and sharp clavicles pressing against the skin like an necromancer animagus transforming into a skeleton. He was stronger than he looked, though, as Severus knew from bitter experience.</p><p>Finally Severus grew tired of the oppressive silence and spoke. "What do you want?" </p><p>He regretted the question as soon as it was out of his mouth - hadn't he learned by now the cardinal rule of bullies: keep out of their way and do not engage them?</p><p>"Me? From you? Why on earth would I want anything from <em>you</em>?" A world of casual cruelty in that smile.  "Hmmmm, let's see. You can pick up this towel, I guess."</p><p>He held out the second towel he'd had draped over his shoulder in a classic sports cliché, and let it fall to the floor exaggeratedly, like a fair lady at a joust dropping her handkerchief.</p><p>Severus frowned.  It was a trick, that much was obvious, but refusing to play into the game only made bullies madder, and then they did worse things when they finally caught up with you. He hesitated, then slowly moved towards James. He tried to keep as far away as possible as he reached out and as his hand neared the towel, James's naked foot came out and languidly moved it away, towards himself and under a bench where it was awkward to get to. </p><p>"Oops." James's face was a study in disdain.</p><p>Severus hated himself for doing this at all – where did the rulebook say that he had to pick up the Gryffindors' towels? – but he knew the orders he was following weren't in any school regulations, which paradoxically meant he did have to obey them or there would be worse consequences.  He had long ago given up on the idea of getting any help from his teachers – Potter had a way of twisting everything around to make himself seem innocent, and no one ever believed Severus if there was any other possible explanation to be had. Or invented.</p><p>He bent over further... a little further... and then he awoke abruptly gasping and wet with sweat in the blessed darkness of his quarters. </p><p>Severus stared into the darkness, remembering what happened next against his will – how he stood up and James started punching him, fast – eye, chin, groin – until Severus was reeling, dizzy – and then he gentled, stroked the tormented flesh and Snape trembled helplessly in the older boy's grasp, unable to pull away. James looked triumphant.</p><p>Severus had to take a sleeping draught before he could sleep dreamlessly that night, and more than a few thereafter.</p><p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p><p>Upstairs Harry sat up at the same time, crying out "No!"  He was sick inside at the alien memory of his father, sneering, taunting, so cold and cruel.  Almost reminded him of someone familiar.  He got a sensation of blondness. And the half-guilty, half-defiant, humiliated boy being abused was <em>Snape</em>. Harry had been in that position.</p><p>While he'd been walking down the Hall of Mysteries all winter, this was the first time he'd been witness to one of Snape's dreams. At least, that was what Harry assumed had happened.</p><p>Harry was afraid to fall asleep, not wanting to know the full horror. He tossed restlessly for over an hour before a shallow sleep claimed him, waking at dawn groggy but glad he did not remember his dreams.</p>
