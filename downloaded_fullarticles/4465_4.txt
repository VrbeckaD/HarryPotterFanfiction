Why does everyone hate her when all she does is try to help?</p><p>She thought it would be different, thought she could fit in.</p><p>She should have known better.</p><p>It is just like her old classmates said,</p><p>She will never have friends, no one could like a swot like her.</p><p>Beaver the Bookworm, that cruel taunt seems to play on repeat inside her head, her heart.</p><p>
  <em>Mudblood, know it all, friendless, annoying, bossy, brat, worthless </em>
</p><p>All of these thoughts ricochet inside her head. The more she thinks them, the truer they seem.</p><p>She is on a downwards spiral and no one cares. No one sees.</p><p>If she was like everyone else, would people want ot be her friends?</p><p>If she had glossy curls instead of untamable mess, if her lips were glossed and she giggle over boys, would it be different?</p><p>Maybe she should tryâ€¦ No.</p><p>This is who she is. She will not change it.</p><p>So, she sits alone in the library, learning and learning.</p><p>If tears sometimes seep onto the pages, well, no is there to see it. No one cares.</p></div>
