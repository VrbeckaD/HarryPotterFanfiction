    <p>Harry watched Tom sitting at his desk, working. Despite the loud creak of the door when he’d come in, Tom appeared not to have noticed his presences and so remained writing, even whilst the door to his study hung open, and Harry lingered in the space like a spectre might. </p>
<p>Tom was currently writing some report, quite intently, just as he had been for a week now, all on the same subject matter no doubt. His head was bent forwards and the quill scratched at the parchment, and every couple of lines, he paused momentarily to dip the nib back into the vial of black ink sitting beside him. Behind him, was the window and the view of their small garden; it faced westward and right now the sun was casting a fruitful sky, with streaks of peachy pink and clouds the colour of nectarines. </p>
<p>Those colours bled into the room too, and the Russian green of the walls was softened to a sage. Tom himself was outlined in black, a precise shape that stood bold against the permeating gold of the sun. Though the exact expression of his face was hardly visible in the gloom and was instead swathed in such shadows; they were the sort of secret shadows that wouldn’t suit anyone else. </p>
<p>For they didn’t have the intensity of personality to sustain the foundations and thus, allow the composition above lacked the fortitude to contain such vagaries.</p>
<p>All the same, like this he looked almost lovely; all the sharp edges smoothed away like a stone’s surface after being tossed on the ocean’s waves, and all his apices sanded down to a gentle, pleasing, curve. Harry sighed, sometimes it physically hurt to look at Tom for long periods of time, perhaps, it was all the emotions that he unknowingly dragged from Harry’s heart until it throbbed, and from his lungs, until they stung.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, it was simpler than that. Maybe, it merely because Tom’s entire being emanated a strain of magic that was as hypnotic as it was painful, rather like melted chocolate with grains of glass speckled through. More than one person had been physically repulsed by the feel of it on their skin, others were spellbound, and Harry sat somewhere in the middle. To him, it was entrancing and even soothing when Tom was in a good mood, but when he wasn’t, or he was simply too distracted in his own consciousness which tended to be murky at the best of times, it became prickly and almost brusque against his skin.</p>
<p>Currently, it was veering towards the brusquer end of the scale, and Harry could feel it scratching at his wrists, and his neck because, however good, Tom was at hiding his thoughts behind layer upon layer of cerebral fortification, and hiding his emotions behind an endless supply of blank masks, he didn’t paid the same level of attention to his own physicality.</p>
<p>Probably, knowing Tom as he did, the oversight was one of hubris; this strange belief that his emotions did not present themselves into the physical world, either by his body language or by the texture of his magic.</p>
<p>But they did, and Harry had become rather adept at reading them. </p>
<p>Right now, for instance, there was a superficial silkiness that lapped softly at his skin like gentle waves, but the scratchy undertone was still undeniable, to continue the metaphor, it was like sand and small stones hidden beneath the waves’ foam. Harry shifted, still not making noise, but the movement alone surely should have alerted Tom to his presences. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Tom still didn’t react, and in his inattentiveness, Harry began to feel marginally uncomfortable. Somehow, this felt like a violation; an invasion of sorts into Tom’s perfectly curated, if somewhat high-stress, gold-glazed environment.</p>
<p>Harry swallowed and continued to shift his weight again from one foot to the other. He could go now and pretend that none of this had ever happened. But he didn’t. Rather he found himself still standing there, still watching with the utmost fascination at Tom, when he had a couple of his defences down.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, Tom was not particularly vulnerable in this moment, and Harry was sure that if he tried anything untoward, the reaction would likely be automatic and, somewhat, violent. But still, the sleek surface of his magic was coming from some part of him, and that part was likely the marginal reduction in the sheer quantity of defence mechanisms he usually employed.</p>
<p>For all his virtues, Tom could be paranoid sometimes.   </p>
<p>Though right now, his world appeared audaciously simple in design, and he sat at the heart of it; relaxed in a way that, despite living together, Harry was rarely allowed to see. The top three buttons of his shirt were undone, and the firm line of his collarbone was illuminated by the dull desk lamp, there was no sign of his tie or his jacket. And even the way he was sitting was different to usual, for starters, his fingers did not hold the tension they usually would when he was working repetitively, and likewise, his back had taken on a lazy curve, as opposed to its usual washboard straightness. </p>
<p>He looked… simply inhuman. A figure sated on the sun; its tendrils wound around his fingers as they tapped lightly on the surface of the wood, and a languid ease seeping through the rest of his limbs. He was even taking his time with writing letting the loops dip lower on the page, and the elegant twirls become increasingly elaborate. This was Tom in his most natural state. </p>
<p>Harry swallowed again; Tom just looked so… <em>good</em> when he relaxed, even if it was only a little. He should do it more often. Though, maybe it’s brilliance was simply because it was such a rare occurrence, because most of the time Tom was pulled tighter than tight like he was a bundle of wires knotted together by fastidious fingers. Every action was usually constructed, and every emotional response orchestrated to an almost unhealthy degree. And whether by conscious choice, or subconscious design, such a lifestyle preferred endless dimness, and stress, and limited interaction with anyone else. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that was currently including Harry. </p>
<p>In spite of the fact they shared a house, and not a particularly big one at that, Harry had barely seen Tom all week, much less managed a meaningful conversation with him. The ignoring was starting to grate on his nerves, and Harry was quite sure that soon it would breed resentment if not dealt with appropriately and reasonably soon, and he didn’t want to resent Tom. </p>
<p>Especially, if such resentment would also go unnoticed.  </p>
<p>“I know you’re there,” said Tom suddenly, though he didn’t look up, or make any other acknowledgement of Harry’s existence; just a few simple words that made Harry shift again and resting his hand on the doorframe. “What is it?” Tom continued, in the silence that Harry hadn’t filled. </p>
<p>“You’ve been ignoring me,” Harry said quietly, gripping a little harder at the doorframe; picking at the old wood and running his nails through the grooves, letting the wood dust that had collected drop and disperse into the air. They both silently watched the particles, illumined by the sun, floated down to be lost forever on the floorboards. </p>
<p>Tom continued to watch the air even when the dust had gone, “well, I’ve been working,” he said, still writing, or at least, moving his hand in the motion of writing, though the nib had run out of ink. “As you know,” he added, dipping the quill again and getting back to his half-formed sentence. Apparently, that was supposed to signal the end of the conversation, regardless of nothing having actually been solved. </p>
<p>Harry sighed. It was this sort of behaviour that had motivated him to move in with Tom far earlier than everyone had thought was appropriate, because, despite Tom’s undeniable brilliance in the vicious fields of politics and academia, he was painfully inept at <em>real</em> life. And having to deal with that ineptitude at a physical distance was unworkable. There had been weeks of utter silence for no particular reason, other than Tom was busy on some project or other that completely consumed his entire existence. Couple that with his tendency not to eat when he was preoccupied, and to neglect sleep, and almost all human contact, really meant that it was a surprise that Tom had managed to survive over two decades without collapsing in on himself like a dying star. </p>
<p>“You work too much.”</p>
<p>Tom just hummed an objection. Although, Harry knew he heard it because he’d stopped writing, only for a second; someone who didn’t know him might well have mistaken it for a natural pause. But when Tom was focused, he didn’t need to pause. So, he’d heard, and apparently, disagreed with the criticism of his habits. Nevertheless, he continued writing.</p>
<p>Ever so carefully, so that Tom would barely notice his movement, even in his periphery, Harry shifted over to the other side of the doorframe. He leaned his weight on the door itself and made its hinges creak as he swung it back and forth and back again. The quiet squeak, accompanied by the scraping against the floorboards from where they had warped a long time ago, was undeniably annoying.</p>
<p>Tom lasted less than a minute.</p>
<p>“Could you stop that?” he said, a poisonous spike in his words that was matched by an equal spike up of irritation in his magic. A sudden barb that would have caught Harry by surprise, if he hadn’t felt it a hundred times before, pretty much every time Tom experienced a minor discomfort within a reasonable proximity. </p>
<p>“Maybe?” Harry replied, making no effort to stop the creaking or the squeaking or the scratching, after all, it was about time that Tom had his needs neglected too. When there was no immediate effect, Harry put more of his weight on the door, making scraping last longer and sound harsher, as though it were leaving behind a long, indented, streak across the floor. </p>
<p>“Fine,” Tom snapped, less than thirty seconds later, “what do you want, Harry?” The terse tone was entirely unmistakable now, and most people would start to back away for fear of inflaming it further. But not Harry, he had too much invested in this excursion to do that. </p>
<p>Slowly, Harry peeled himself off the door and walked the couple of steps firmly into the room. Beneath his feet, the floorboards groaned, and the sun wrapped its golden arms around him, providing a warmth to heat the cold that had settled in his stomach. Tom watched him, scrutinising each step.</p>
<p>He placed his hands down onto the edge of Tom’s desk; his face was still caught in the sun, and thus became the inverse of Tom’s, bright where his was shadowed, and careless where he was cautious. “I want you to stop working, and pay attention to me,” Harry said carefully, as though this were political negotiation because that was the language Tom understood best.</p>
<p>It was Tom’s turn to sigh and roll his eyes, “and if I don’t?” he said. </p>
<p>“You will.”</p>
<p>With a casual, condescending, and somewhat dismissive smile, Tom hummed amusedly and looked back down at his recently written sentence, probably trying to remember what he was going to say next. “Maybe later,” he said. </p>
<p>Almost without thinking, Harry slapped his hand down on Tom’s freshly written words, blurring the ink and feeling its wetness seeping into his skin, “I think you misunderstand me, Tom,” he said firmly and with far more confidence than he actually felt, “I want your attention <em>now</em>.”</p>
<p>Slowly, and unnervingly calmly, Tom looked up, his eyes dragging from Harry’s fingers, along his arm and finally up to his face. He sat back in his chair, eyebrows raised, and his arms crossed; the fingers on his right hand tapped against his left arm firmly and deliberately, as though he were a teacher trying to decide punishment he wanted to enact on a student for a minor, but annoying, transgression. </p>
<p>“Is that so?” he said eventually, “and what exactly makes you think that I’ll give you my attention?”</p>
<p>Harry was tempted to quip that he already had Tom’s undivided attention, but that could lead down a whole other rabbit hole that he was underprepared for, and if he’d learnt anything from living with Tom, it was not to start an argument unless you’d done your research. So, instead, Harry settled with something less contentious. “I’ll make you,” he said simply. </p>
<p>Tom smiled at that; he still looked unconvinced, “go on then,” he said, an unmistakable challenged infused into his tone; a sourness that would have suited lemon tea. He paused for a moment, and checked his watch, “you have fifteen minutes to convince me, Harry, and if you can’t, then you’re going to leave me to work, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“That’s not fair,” Harry started.</p>
<p>But Tom interrupted him, “oh, Harry,” he said, reaching forward for the clock on his desk and starting to set the alarm for fifteen minutes time, “who said anything about fairness?”</p>
