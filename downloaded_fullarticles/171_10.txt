It was the same dream as before. The same dream she'd had nearly every night since school ended. She shivered, taking comfort in the way the light from the moon filtered through her shades and dispersed the shadows that grew in her mind. </p><p>The way she'd felt, as Voldemort twisted Quirrell's broken body to his will, made her almost sick with pain. She would recover after a few minutes, once she could stop the clenching and shaking that ran their course each time. Ginny shivered, feeling the sweat as it plastered her hair to her forehead and tried to take deep breaths. She was alone in her room, in the Potters' house. She was Ginny Weasley, and this was her body. She flexed her fingers experimentally and the tension finally began to relax.</p><p>Ginny yawned, managing to stand up and make her way to the door, her steps clumsy with sleep. Cleo hopped off her bed and followed, trotting lithely as if she hadn't been asleep just moments before.</p><p>Ginny padded quietly across the house, making her way to the little hallway that led out to the porch and Hedwig's enclosure. The beautiful snowy owl fluttered her wings at Ginny, settling back on her perch with a fuss once Hedwig realized she hadn't brought any treats. Ginny checked the letter box, but the slots were all empty. <em> 'Of course they're empty, it's three in the morning,' </em>she thought with frustration, shivering in the predawn chill.</p><p>It had been almost two weeks since she'd first had the nightmare, and she woke each time expecting some news that Voldemort had escaped from Azkaban, but there'd been nothing. Surely if he'd broken out, someone would've realized by now, wouldn't they?</p><p>Ginny had written to Ada right away the first time, but she responded that she hadn't heard anything either and Ginny could relax, the dreams probably meant nothing. Maybe they <em> were </em> just nightmares, and Ginny was overreacting. She hoped that was true. Maybe that was why she hadn't said anything to the Potters yet. As long as it stayed in the realm of her nightmares, she could pretend it wasn't real.</p><p>And yet, the scar throbbed like a dull ache, a reminder that the one who'd given it was still alive and out there. Waiting.</p><p>Ginny walked into the kitchen, opening the door to the ice box that served as a refrigerator in the Potters' home. As far as Ginny could tell, the box had some type of spell on it to keep it cold. Lily had even bewitched it to hum pleasantly, a little reminder of a muggle refrigerator that helped Ginny feel at home. Maybe Lily found it comforting too.</p><p>"Can't sleep either?" Harry asked from the hallway, shuffling his feet as he fussed with his glasses.</p><p>Ginny shook her head, quickly slipping the milk back onto the shelf and hoping Harry didn't notice that she hadn't bothered with a glass. "No, it's the nightmare again."</p><p>Harry gave her a weak smile. "The same for me. Well, my own nightmare, I mean. I only got about halfway through it, if I fall back asleep now I'll just start up where I left off."</p><p>They stood together in silence, unsure of how to talk about all that had transpired between them. They had tried before without much success, but sometimes just knowing she wasn't alone was enough. It had to be.</p><p>"Do you…" started Ginny, suddenly unsure. Harry looked at her, his face open and vulnerable, and she was able to find her footing. "Do you want to stay up, then? With me?"</p><p>Harry nodded, picking up the glass of juice he'd poured, and followed Ginny out of the kitchen.</p><p>In Ginny's room, they stared at the ceiling, talking quietly with the lamp turned low. There was always something measured in their conversations, like Harry was afraid to show how much the experience affected him. But he didn't need to hide it, she hadn't come through unscathed, either.</p><p>"Tom did it to me, too, you know," Ginny whispered, looking up to catch Harry's eye.</p><p>"What?" asked Harry, the color draining from his face. He knew what she'd meant.</p><p>"The painted words in the hallway, before holiday. He… He did it through me. Or made me do it, I don't really know." She'd admitted it before, to Dumbledore and the Potters, of course. But Harry had been in the hospital wing then, and she hadn't brought it up since. </p><p>He blinked at her, sitting upright. "I didn't know. He possessed you, too?"</p><p>Ginny nodded, not particularly wanting to relive the experience, but still feeling the need to talk about it all the same. "I didn't even know it had happened until later. But whenever I think about it, I can feel him there. Like some kind of slimy eel worming around in my head."</p><p>Harry nodded, letting the silence lengthen until Ginny wondered if she'd overstepped. Maybe he wasn't ready to remember.</p><p>"It's like," Harry started, pausing as he worked out all the words out in his mind. "It's like I was in my room and had drifted off to sleep. And then when I woke up, the room had been changed around by someone else. All the things were still mine, but his handprints were all over everything. Like he'd covered it in tar."</p><p>Ginny thought of videos she'd seen in her muggle classes about an oil spill; the thick, black substance coating the birds and seals in this sticky goop they couldn't wash away. Was she like that now, stained by her association with Tom? Was Harry?</p><p>"When I tried to be me again, it was hard because he was still in the way," Harry continued, his voice soft and distant, like he wasn't sure he could admit the truth. "And it got even harder every time it happened. I couldn't remember what I was doing or where I was going. After a while, I stopped trying to fight it. I couldn't even tell what I was fighting anymore, couldn't tell which parts were still me."</p><p>Harry turned to face her, his face pale in the soft light. "Do you hear him still, sometimes? Laughing at you, whispering the secrets he stole? The lies?" Harry closed his eyes, his breathing coming fast and ragged now. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't be asking, it's not my place to…" </p><p>"I still hear him, but he's quieter now. Even when he's angry." Ginny remembered how quickly he'd become her everything; her friend, her confidante, her guiding force. It had happened so easily that she hadn't noticed at first. Not until it was much too late. </p><p>Harry exhaled heavily, something like relief in the sound. "I hope he quiets for me, too. Sometimes it's hard to hear myself think."</p><p>The silence between them stretched on after that, but Ginny felt like something had passed between them that cut straight through the tension. She let her eyes drift closed, listening as Harry's breathing leveled out beside her. She thought of the way Lily's eyes trailed him when he wasn't looking, the expression of concern etched deep into the lines of her face. Ginny owed it to Lily, owed it to Harry too, to do whatever she could to make things right.</p><p>"Ginny?" asked Harry, his voice light to see if she was sleeping. </p><p>"Hmmm?"</p><p>"Would it be alright if I stayed here, for a little while?"</p><p>"Of course," answered Ginny, her heart beating a little faster. It was funny, remembering how she'd felt when she was first talking to Harry. How scared of making a fool of herself she had been, watching him from behind her textbooks as he joked with Ron and Hermione. So much had changed, and yet she still felt her chest flutter at the thought of him lying next to her, asleep.</p><p>As Harry drifted off, his expression set in grim determination, she felt the need to protect him swell in her. She scooted closer to him so that they were nearly touching, only the bunching of the blankets keeping them apart. She carefully laid her arm over him, hoping he wouldn't wake, and closed her eyes for a moment. It wasn't long before Ginny drifted off to sleep, her hand wound around his.</p><p>That night, the nightmare didn't come again.</p><hr/><p>Ginny leaned low and shot to the left, speeding ahead just in time to save the quaffle from making it through the ring. She threw it down the pitch, right into Ron's waiting arms as he managed to slide a goal past Fred. Ginny cheered and went into a quick corkscrew turn to show off, smiling as James shook his head in resignation. He hated losing.</p><p>"The pride of Gryffindor scores again!" shouted Ron, whooping as Fred threw the quaffle at his head.</p><p>"Hey now, keep it civil," scolded James. "And get that defense up, I've got a win streak riding on this game." He zoomed by them on a Nimbus broom of his own, which he'd managed to hold off buying until just this past week. He'd justified it to all of them -- none of whom had asked -- by saying he'd bought it for a new 'fitness routine' he'd heard about in the office. James had not mentioned the routine since.</p><p>The six of them kept their scrimmage going on for another hour, all exhausted by the time they headed in for supper. Ginny relished in the physical exertion; the excitement of flying going a long way to offset the boredom of not being able to use magic all summer.</p><p>"There's a letter for you, Ginny," Lily called out from Hedwig's enclosure.</p><p>Ginny made her way out to the porch, fear coiling deep in her belly. Had someone seen something? Did her friends learn something she'd overlooked? As frightened as she was, she needed to know. She was done with ignoring warning signs.</p><p>"Is everything alright, dear? You're not hurt, are you?" asked Lily, concern quickly jumping to her eyes as she searched Ginny for an injury. In her hands was a letter, Ginny's name marked in large letters on the post in Colin's messy scrawl.</p><p>"Oh, I'm alright," Ginny lied, doing her best to school her face. "Just tired." Maybe it was nothing, another false hope of finally figuring out what was going on. </p><p>Lily tapped the edge of the envelope lightly with her wand, and it opened more cleanly than any letter opener Ginny had ever seen. Inside was a note from Colin and a few photographs of her, as well as a clipping of a <em> Daily Prophet </em>article about the students who'd been petrified. The profile on Colin showed a picture of Ginny and him together that Ada had taken after Gryffindor's victory against Hufflepuff.</p><p>Ginny smiled at the picture, reminded that her second year at Hogwarts was right around the corner. With a rather rocky first year behind her, she was ready to put those troubles in the past. Maybe she was being paranoid about Voldemort escaping. It <em> had </em>been a dream, after all.</p><p>Ginny flipped through the rest of the photographs, most of them of her or her and Ada. Colin had even included the first one he'd taken on the boat ride across the lake, before the sorting. She couldn't believe how much had changed since then. Ginny turned to the note, excited to hear from Colin after his family holiday.</p><p>
  <em> Hey Ginny!  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I hope your summer is going well! I know mine has - mom and dad took Dennis and me to a lake house that our uncle owns. It started out boring; dad only wanted to watch the tele since his club was on, and of course we aren't allowed any magic. Then two days later, an owl swooped into the living room and dropped a Hogwarts letter for Dennis right into the gravy boat at dinner! He was so excited that he fainted, and dad said we should head to the pub to celebrate with some fish and chips. Dennis brought his letter along and two wizards saw it and came to congratulate him! They were just there in the pub looking for a drink, can you believe it? And then…  </em>
</p><p>Ginny refolded the letter -- all <em> six </em>pages of it -- to finish reading later. Flipping back to the photos, she picked up one that Colin had taken of the three of them using his timer. Ginny looked at Ada and Colin's smiling faces and felt a surge of warmth in her chest. She missed her friends, but there was something pleasant about the ache, and she cherished the feeling that she had people to miss.</p><p>"Those are lovely photographs," commented Lily, leaning to look over Ginny's shoulder. "Did he send you any of the original film?"</p><p>Ginny upended the envelope, finding a strip of negatives in a small plastic sleeve and handing them to Lily. </p><p>"Perfect. I can whip up a developing potion in about twenty minutes in my lab, then we can use that to develop the photos so that they'll move. I can make extra of the potion, if you think Colin would be interested?"</p><p>Ginny nodded eagerly. "Can you make one of Ada and Colin and me? After the quidditch match?"</p><p>"Of course, dear," answered Lily, kissing Ginny's head as she wrapped an arm around her.</p><p>Ginny froze, surprised by the tenderness of the gesture. It wasn't that it was <em> bad</em>, just that she hadn't expected it. But Lily must have felt her go rigid, because she quickly drew back. "I'm sorry, was that too… did I do something wrong?"</p><p>Ginny could feel Tom laughing at her, whispering that she wasn't worthy of love, that she was a fraud. She hated that he could still touch her, through time and distance, and poison every motive. For the first few years after leaving the Sheltons, Ginny had been starved for affection, slowly hardening to the reality of her situation. Now, she found that she was afraid of its easy familiarity, scared that if she <em> really </em> had it, it was only a matter of time before it was taken from her.</p><p>"Sometimes I feel like I'm flying blind in all of this, I wasn't even thinking about what I was doing. I guess I'm just so used to it with the boys, I'm sorry," Lily confided. "I don't know all of what you've been through, but I'm sure it was a great deal. I don't mean to pry or make you uncomfortable, it's just…"</p><p>"I'm alright, I was just surprised. I… that's okay, for you to do." </p><p>"Alright," Lily answered quietly, though she didn't try again.</p><p>Looking at the photographs in her hand, Ginny had a thought. The portrait of the Fat Lady at Hogwarts could talk, she could even ask for the password to the common room. "Is there something that can make photographs talk? Like magic paintings?"</p><p>"Not yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone invented a magical camera capable of that one day. Maybe it will be you or one of your brothers. Your father Arthur loved to tinker, especially with muggle technology. Might be in the Weasley genes," Lily said, sliding the strip of negatives into her pocket as she smiled down at Ginny.</p><p>Ginny remembered what Dumbledore had said to her about her tape player, and that the Muggle Studies professor had known her father. She should speak to her at Hogwarts this year; she might even have stories of Ginny's parents when they were younger. And maybe Ginny could work on her new tape player, like her father might have done.</p><p>"For paintings, and usually portraits," Lily continued, "the painter has to enchant the paints and painting as they work. All that time and magic captures a much better copy of the person, whereas a photograph is done in a snap," she said, mimicking a camera shot.</p><p>"Did my parents have any portraits?"</p><p>Lily frowned, a pained expression briefly stealing across her face. "I'm not sure, but I'm afraid your old home -- the Burrow -- didn't survive the blast. By the time Hagrid got there, nearly half of it had burned down. I'm sorry, Ginny."</p><p>Ginny nodded solemnly. She'd expected as much; if one had survived, surely she would've been told about it by now. It still managed to feel like a fresh loss, the excitement immediately squashed. "That's okay, I expected something like that. The twins had said it was destroyed when I asked them about the house in the photo album. Is there a portrait of you, with James?"</p><p>"No, not yet. But now that you're with us, I think one of the whole family would be nice, don't you? We can sit for one before summer is through. I'll send Horace an owl and see if he knows anyone he'd recommend. How does that sound?"</p><p>Ginny nodded, feeling like she was really a part of the family, yet afraid that all of it would be taken from her. "Thank you, Lily, I'd like that."</p><hr/><p>Ginny shifted the woven basket between her hands, trying to find a more comfortable position as the potion bottles clinked lightly together. It was a bright and sunny summer day, but the clouds on the horizon spoke of rain in the evening, their towering crowns reaching far into the atmosphere. Ginny sneezed, trying to settle the basket on her hip as she wiped her nose with her sleeve. Was there a spell to get rid of allergies?</p><p>"Is that too heavy? I don't mind carrying them both," offered Lily, reaching out for the basket.</p><p>"No, it's alright, I want to help," Ginny insisted. She was going on Lily's potions route with her today, stopping by many of the homes in Godric's Hollow to help drop off the medicines and tinctures that Lily had brewed. "Do you go on this walk all the time?"</p><p>"Once or twice a month. Most of the potions last longer than that, but some are best when fresh. Here, grab those two purple ones, will you? We'll visit Ms. Bagshot next, and she'll offer us tea."</p><p>"Ms. Bagshot?" The name stirred a memory for her, where had she seen it? Maybe someone she had met in the Leaky Cauldron that day, almost a year ago now?</p><p>"Yes, she's a writer and historian; she even wrote some of your textbooks, like <em> 'A History of Magic', </em> and <em> 'Hogwarts: A History'. </em>She's lived here for quite some time, even while the Dumbledore family was in Godric's Hollow."</p><p>"Professor Dumbledore lived here?" Ginny asked, surprised. "I can't picture him ever being a kid. He looked ancient even when he was Tom's professor… " She stopped herself, feeling the heat rising in her cheeks. She shouldn't talk about it, especially after what Harry had gone through.</p><p>She chanced a glance at Lily, who was watching her with concern. "It's alright, Ginny, you can tell me about it. You saw a memory of Dumbledore when... Tom was at school?"</p><p>Ginny nodded, her stomach churning with anxiety. "It's fine, I don't need to talk about it." If Voldemort had really escaped Azkaban, he'd be coming for her. What chance did she stand if she couldn't even tell a story about him without fear twisting her insides?</p><p>"Alright," nodded Lily, her eyes watching Ginny's closely. "I'll let you off for now, but that offer always stands, okay? Let's see if Ms. Bagshot has any juicy gossip about Albus Dumbledore when he was your age."</p><p>Tea with Ms. Bagshot would have to wait, however, as she was rushing out the floo on her way to visit a friend who'd just been taken to St. Mungos. She promised tea and biscuits the following week, and a healthy dose of embarrassing Dumbledore stories if Ginny was still interested.</p><p>As Ginny followed Lily through her neighborhood route, one thing kept gnawing at her. "How does your job work? I never see anyone paying for anything, do they mail it to you after?"</p><p>Lily smiled, wiping her brow briefly. "This is more of my charity work, actually. James and I moved to Godric's Hollow to raise a family, and the community has always been so good to us. It feels like the right thing to do, since I've got the skill, don't you think?"</p><p>Ginny wondered what that meant for her. Was it her job to be this <em> Chosen One </em> that everyone talked about? Was she actually any good at it? She wasn't even twelve yet, and she'd barely survived her first year at Hogwarts -- nearly unleashing an ancient beast of legend upon the school in the process. It certainly didn't feel like it was doing well.</p><p>Maybe it just meant that she was supposed to be the best at whatever she became, but that seemed a little too obvious. It really didn't matter, it's not like she had a choice in being the 'Girl Who Lived', she may as well own it.</p><p>On their walk back to Lily’s lab behind the Potters' home, Lily told Ginny that she was a researcher for the Potions Association -- a branch of the Ministry -- and worked on developing counter-curse potions for serious and deadly curses. Lily explained that there were sometimes different ways to beat a curse, and often combining different magical disciplines led to better results. It reminded Ginny of what Professor Slughorn said about Potions almost a year ago.</p><p>Lily took out her wand, flicking it lightly toward the door handle, the motion followed by a satisfying <em> click </em>. "I originally started working on a cure for lycanthropy -- that's the blood curse that werewolves have -- but it's not a well-funded affliction. After a few years, our department got cut, and that's when I went back to researching counter-curse potions. Like I had during the war."</p><p>Once inside, Lily flipped the switch on an old turntable setup against the wall. The subdued sounds of 'Light My Fire' by The Doors came on, the synths ringing out their classic seventies sound. "I guess there's just something in me that wants to fix whatever is broken. But when it comes to curses, sometimes the only thing you can do is destroy the corruption and hope that there is enough good left to repair itself."</p><p>Lily dug around her equipment for a few minutes before she handed Ginny a clear glass bottle labeled <em> ‘Developing Solution’ </em> to give to Colin. Ginny tucked it carefully away, excited to show him when she got back to Hogwarts. Lily had also developed Ginny’s photograph so that it moved, the trio laughing and cheering as they hoisted their Gryffindor colors in celebration. </p><p>"I didn’t always want to do counter-curse work,” Lily admitted, leaning against her workstation. “When James and I graduated, war had already broken out. We joined the Order of the Phoenix the moment we left Hogwarts, and pretty soon we were in the thick of it. I worked with the healers, using what they knew of treating curses to modify the potions I knew. It was grueling work, and we were always fighting against the clock, but it awakened something in me. The more I understood about the spell work, the more effective my potions became. Of course, I wasn't always fast enough."</p><p>A shadow seemed to pass over Lily's eyes, and she paused, lost in thought. No one really talked about the war, at least as far as Ginny could tell. She thought of the homeless veterans she'd seen in her foster neighborhoods, alternating between drowning their sadness and unleashing their anger. Maybe all wars were like that, a shadow on the soul. She remembered the horrible descriptions she'd read when she was researching Voldemort in the library last year. The terrible crimes the Death Eaters had committed, the torture and murder. If Lily had been right in the middle of it; she'd probably seen some of the worst curses there were.</p><p>"After all the dust settled," Lily continued, "I had a long conversation with Horace Slughorn, and we made a deal. I'd wanted to quit, but he said he'd sponsor me for the job if I gave it a go. I thought about the good that I could do, and he convinced me that as a researcher, I wouldn't be dealing with the types of situations I had to during the war. <em> Or </em> be forced to make the types of decisions we had to make."</p><p>"Professor Slughorn gave me good advice, too," Ginny added, looking at all the strange ingredients stored around the lab. It looked like Slughorn's office, in some ways. The photos were of family and friends, though, and gifts from Harry and Ron were interspersed with a few awards and Lily's old Head Girl badge. "He said that you were his favorite student, and in Slug Club, too."</p><p>Ginny thought about how welcoming Slughorn had been last year when she'd talked to him about Harry. Maybe she should tell him about the diary? Tom had known him during school, Slughorn might even know how the diary worked. She didn't know if that mattered, but if Voldemort really <em> had </em>escaped, she wanted to be prepared. If anything was certain, it was that he'd be coming for her.</p><p>"Wait," said Ginny, remembering something as Jim Morrison's voice came back in with the chorus. "This is a muggle song. Harry said all you ever listened to was Celestina Warbeck!"</p><p>Lily gave her a wink, shimmying her hips a little to the beat. "That's just my cooking music, but it wasn't that long ago that I was young and into whatever was popular at the time. I turned Sirius on to The Doors, you know? But Pink Floyd was always his favorite."</p><hr/><p>Ginny spread her hands around her mug, relishing the warmth that the tea brought to her fingers. Somehow, Grimmauld Place always managed to feel cold and gloomy, even in the middle of summer. Sirius was deep into another of his muggle novels, working his way through the muggle library's recommended reading list, his own tea forgotten on the counter.</p><p>"Why does everyone say, 'Oh Merlin', and stuff like that?" Ginny asked, knowing she wouldn't get an honest answer from the twins. It's not that they weren't helpful, <em> sometimes </em>, but they wouldn't miss an opportunity to have a go at her. "Was he actually a real wizard, with King Arthur and the knights of the round table at Camelot? I always thought those were muggle legends."</p><p>Sirius looked up from the book he was reading, this one titled <em> Dune </em>, and raised his eyebrows. "He was a real wizard, believe it or not. He even attended Hogwarts many, many years ago."</p><p>"Oh," answered Ginny, wondering if she'd asked a stupid question. Sirius seemed to catch her hesitance and motioned for her to join him on the couch.</p><p>"It's understandable that you didn't know that. With the Statute of Secrecy in place, the Ministry has done everything in its power to erase the existence of magic from muggle history over the last two hundred years. But Merlin was too widely known to be memory charmed away, so the Ministry spread rumors and destroyed muggle historical records. Eventually, they managed to convince the muggles it was a fairytale."</p><p>Sirius went on to explain that Merlin had, in fact, been an advisor to King Arthur in his battles against the evil witch Morgana and her realm of Avalon. He later founded the Order of Merlin, an organization dedicated to the cooperation between wizardkind and muggles.</p><p>"Wait -- I thought the Order of Merlin was an award? Doesn't Dumbledore have one?"</p><p>"It is now, but that's a more recent incarnation. The old one dissolved some time after Merlin died and his ideas fell out of favor. But Merlin was still a hero to most people and well known as an incredibly powerful wizard. He was a master of wandless <em> and </em> wordless magic, and invented more than a quarter of the <em> Standard Book of Spells </em>. When the Wizengamot announced an award for contributions to the magical community, in his honor, it resonated with people."</p><p>Ginny didn’t care about the award; it couldn’t be very hard to get if Lockhart had managed it. Bur Merlin and Morgana were much more interesting. So Morgana really <em> was </em> an evil witch that King Arthur fought wars against. It seemed strange that she would hate muggles if her father and half-brother were muggles, too. Didn’t that make her a half-blood? “What did Morgana do that was so evil? Why'd they fight?"</p><p>"She wanted to stop Merlin at all costs, destroy any chance of an alliance with muggles, so she summoned monsters and began attacking the nearby villages and towns. Arthur and Merlin trained the Knights of the Round Table to fight her monsters, and to hunt the witch who started it all. Eventually she was defeated, but the wars were brutal, and they say Avalon was destroyed."</p><p>There was something that Sirius said that tickled her memory. Something about Merlin and Morgana that was just beyond the tip of her tongue; a word that the centaur Firenze had said to her, something that seemed so familiar. "Is there anything about a gate, or a bridge? With Morgana? It sounds like Avalon, I think?"</p><p>"There are other names for it," Sirius suggested. "Mostly different spellings or pronunciations from old English or Gaelic. Afallach is one, Avilion, Annwyn or Annfwyn, there may be more…" </p><p>"Yes, that one, Annwyn!" </p><p>"Where did you hear that?" Sirius asked, surprised. "It's Welsh, isn't it? Do they teach Welsh in muggle schools in London?"</p><p>Ginny shrugged. She remembered the promise she had made Firenze. She wouldn't tell Sirius anything about the clearing on the hilltop near the Forbidden Forest, or the centaurs that called it home. But it wouldn't hurt for Sirius to know it was a centaur, would it? It wasn't like she could go back and ask Firenze about it. And Sirius had kept her secret about Cleo, after all. </p><p>"A centaur said it about me. That I was a child of Annwyn, or maybe my mother was? Or something about her blood? It's all very hazy..."</p><p>"You met a centaur? At school? Dumbledore <em> has </em> really gotten progressive with his curriculum, I'm impressed." Sirius looked thoughtful, slowly scratching at his scruffy beard. "I wouldn't worry about it. Centaurs like their riddles, he probably just meant you were a daughter of witches or something. Trust me, they're really into astrology and mysticism, very delicate arts and prone to misinterpretation, if you know what I mean." Sirius winked at her, as if they'd shared some sort of secret, but continued on. "Anyway, what I was saying about wandless magic…"</p><p>As she thought about it, the fragments of her conversation with Firenze began to resurface. She swore that he had said something about another world. And he'd called Ginny a daughter of Annwyn, or of Avalon, she supposed. Sirius dismissed the whole idea, but Firenze said that he'd waited for Ginny's arrival for <em> years </em>. That he thought she would lead them home. But where was home? Was Avalon still a real place, an island of dark sorcery? Why would centaurs call that home? The whole thing made her feel unsettled, and a crawling sensation stole its way across her skin, sending gooseflesh in its wake.</p><p>"...So, a spell is really more like a mathematical formula, and the wand is like your muggle calculator, instead of a quill, if you'll pardon the comparison," continued Sirius, unaware that Ginny had stopped listening.</p><p>"Huh," answered Ginny, trying to figure out what he'd been saying. She took a sip of her tea to stall, hoping Sirius would continue if given the opportunity. In the corner of the room, Kreacher painstakingly dusted a coat of arms bearing the Black family crest, a constant stream of muttering bubbling from him just at the edge of hearing.</p><p>Sirius sipped at his tea, making a face as he realized it had gone cold. "The important thing to understand is that the further you get from the standard casting method -- wand and spell -- the harder magic becomes. The caster needs to make up for the lacking components with willpower and understanding. To cast without a wand <em> and </em>wordless, like Merlin did, is an incredibly rare and gifted achievement."</p><p>Kreacher turned and made a scoffing sound, snapping his fingers in the direction of Sirius's teacup. A small curl of steam lifted from the surface of the tea, now hot once more. "Master knows best, of course," proclaimed Kreacher as he solemnly snapped his finger at a rug that began beating itself with a rolling pin, little clouds of dust punctuating the air as it thumped away.</p><p>Ginny laughed, surprised at Kreacher's casual use of wandless magic. She remembered the extra essay she had to present in Professor Binns's class last year, which had been on the Wizarding Council that banned the use of wands among non-humans. Was house elf magic different, in that they didn't need a wand? If so, where did magic come from?</p><hr/><p>Ginny peered down the hallway, finally finding where Kreacher had gone off to. He stood quietly in Regulus's old room, his large, orb-like eyes staring reverently at a framed photograph of Sirius's brother in his Slytherin robes.</p><p>Ginny wanted to know more, to understand his devotion to Regulus, even after all these years. But the last time she'd asked about him, Kreacher had started banging his head against the wall. Was it a house elf thing that they couldn't talk about their masters? Or something that Kreacher had been commanded to do? She supposed it didn't matter, there were other things that Ginny was more interested in knowing.</p><p>"Kreacher," Ginny asked quietly, trying not to startle him. "How do you do magic without a wand? I suppose it's a thing that house elves can do?"</p><p>Kreacher stared at her for a moment before shrugging. "Not for me to know," he said simply, turning back to the picture of Regulus. He began dusting carefully around the edges of the frame, taking special care around the initials stamped on the nameplate: <em> RAB </em>. "Elves aren't wizards, don't use a tool for every task. Wands are not needed for magic as a fork is not needed for eating."</p><p>That made sense to Ginny. After all, she had accidentally used magic a number of times before she came to Hogwarts. She hadn't known that magic was the cause of all of her accidents, of course, but it had been present all the same. Wands probably just made everything easier and faster, like riding a broom instead of walking.</p><p>"Are there other creatures that can do magic without a wand?"</p><p>"Yes, there are many, but Kreacher does not know them all," Kreacher droned in his low voice, clearly tired of this line of questioning. He turned his back to Ginny, stretching onto his tiptoes to reach a shelf covered in old tomes that likely hadn't been touched in a decade.</p><p>"So, lots of different creatures have their own magic? Like house elves and kneazles and centaurs?" Ginny prodded lightly.</p><p>Kreacher shook his head slowly as if she were missing something rather obvious. "There is just magic, not elf magic or wizard magic or centaur magic. It all comes from the same place."</p><p>"And where is that?"</p><p>Kreacher gestured vaguely to the air, exasperated. "Somewhere. Not for me to know, not for me to know. Wasn't born yet."</p><p>"Oh." Ginny hadn't expected much from Kreacher, but he had become <em> slightly </em>less taciturn in all the conversations she had with him.</p><p>After a few moments, Kreacher turned hesitantly, as if unused to having a conversation. "From before him, the one <em> master </em> speaks of. The Elfsbane." It was clear from the way he spit the word 'master' that he meant Sirius.</p><p>"The Elfsbane? Is that what the house elves call Merlin?" Ginny asked in surprise. She had never heard anyone mention that before, but then again most of the things she knew about Merlin were lies fed to the muggles to keep magic a secret. "That's who you mean, Merlin? What happened with Merlin and house elves? And are there any other types of elves?"</p><p>"No other elves, Kreacher thinks. And no friend to elves, Merlin, no friend at all. Not like brave Master Regulus. Defender of house elves." Kreacher clutched at the hem of the old sack that he wore for clothes, twisting the dirty cloth in his fingers.</p><p>"I'm sorry if this is rude, but why do you wear that?"</p><p>Kreacher looked at the cloth covering his body, staring at it intently as if he hadn't looked at it in a very long time. "It is the mark of Kreacher's position in the noble house of Black. If Master gave clothing, Kreacher would be dismissed. Then Kreacher's head would be put on the wall, next to mother's, if lucky. That is what Mistress would have done." His voice betrayed no emotion, and Ginny couldn't tell if he was being serious.</p><p>It felt strange the way everyone else just seemed to ignore him, like he was a part of the furniture or an old portrait covered by a curtain. He was always cleaning when she saw him, but most of the time she didn't see him around the house. Did Kreacher have a home that he went to elsewhere? Or did he live somewhere in Grimmauld Place?</p><p>"Was your mother a house elf for the Black family, too?"</p><p>Kreacher simply nodded.</p><p>"How about any other family?"</p><p>Kreacher stopped and stood very still for a long while. "Kreacher… had a son, once. That's what Mistress said."</p><p>"Had?" asked Ginny. "What happened?"</p><p>Kreacher shook his head, turning for the door. "Not for me to know, not for me to know."</p>
