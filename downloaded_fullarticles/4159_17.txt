    <p>Harry dreamt about everything. He dreamt about God and the Devil and tight clothes and ice-cream sundaes. He dreamt about everything in between. Harry dreamt about- </p><p>"You fucktard!"</p><p>Harry did not dream about fucktards. </p><p>His eyes fluttered open, only to be met with icy blue ones inches from his face. The boy was whisper shouting at him. </p><p>"Wake the fuck up!" </p><p>Harry sat up and yawned, then looks over at his friend, who was clearly pissed. </p><p>"Whoops, looks like I dozed off again. Luckily, and with you being the great friend you are, you'll forgive me." Harry offered. </p><p>Draco was still pissed, but not actually pissed. Draco could never be actually pissed at Harry. </p><p>"I've been sitting here, writing an essay about magic in the fucking Middle Ages, while you've been dreaming about gay leprechauns or whatever-" </p><p>"I wasn't dreaming about you, Draco, don't be so silly."</p><p>Draco looked so unamused, that Harry couldn't contain his giggles. A smile cracked in Draco's face and he let out a chuckle. </p><p>"You're the queer here, Potter." He teased. </p><p>"Nah, everyone knows Malfoys are notorious for being a bit gay." Harry said, before turning on the radio that sat on the table along with all of their books and quills. It was beat up and didn't exactly run smoothly, but it was enough for them. When Harry had stumbled upon it in a second-hand store during the summer of his third year, he couldn't resist the thought of bringing it back to Draco. The difficulty of stowing it away in his trunk along with a stack of CDs was worth it when he saw the shock and fascination on Draco's face.<br/>
The CD that happened to be in the radio at that moment was Combat Rock by The Clash. Harry hummed along and put his (absolutely not allowed, Mr. Potter) Doctor Marten shoes onto a nearby chair, as he got back to his essay- the one he'd been writing before he fell asleep.<br/>
After about half an hour of scribbling out words, Harry looked up at Draco. The moonlight that slipped in through the windows cast shadows on the boy's pale face. Wisps of white-blond hair framed his featured, and his sunken in eyes were light blue. Everything about the Slytherin was pale, like he was permanently bathed in a white light. He was really quite beautiful. </p><p>"One day," Harry started, "I'm gonna take you to a gig. Maybe Pearl Jam, or The Ramones."</p><p>Harry imagined his friend, tall and thin and graceful, moving between hot and tired, but energetic, bodies. He imagined the sweat shining on him in a spotlight, and Draco tossing his damp hair around with passion. Harry imagined the beautiful smile on his face as he screamed lyrics, his voice hoarse and husky. </p><p>It made Harry horny. </p><p>He wondered if that made him gay. </p><p>"Nah, I'm more of a Nirvana guy." Draco replied, looking thoughtful. "Plus, we'd get totally expelled if we ran away to go see a muggle gig." </p><p>Harry sighed, and glanced at his wristwatch. </p><p>"It's two am." He announced, beginning to pack away his essay, which he'd only just managed to struggle through the first paragraph of. Draco, meanwhile, was on his third page. </p><p>They left separately, with Harry slipping through the most unused corridors to get back to the Gryffindor dorms, and Draco creeping back down into the dungeons. </p><p>As Harry lay in bed that night, listening to Seamus snoring so hard Harry was surprised he was still breathing; he continued to wonder if he was a queer. He didn't   think that he was gay, but maybe he was wrong. </p><p>Maybe he really was a queer. </p><p>He didn't want to be one. </p><p>*** </p><p>When Harry tumbled into breakfast the next morning, groggy from sleep deprivation, he headed straight for his usually table. Hermione, Seamus, Ron, Pansy and Tracey were all slumped over in their chairs, clearly exhausted. Even Hermione, who could write an essay in her sleep, was yawning.<br/>
Draco was sitting at the corner; the only one of Harry's friends that didn't seem to be on the verge of death, and was biting into a piece of toast.<br/>
When Harry practically threw himself down beside the blond, the only words that seemed to escape his mouth were: "Donut... Coffee... Now... Please..." Draco tutted but placed a pink frosted donut onto Harry's plate anyway. From the moment his lips touched the creamy icing, he was awake.<br/>
"I still have no idea how you can eat that in the morning." Muttered Hermione, sipping at her tea.<br/>
The thing about Harry was that he had a sweet tooth. A serious sweet tooth. He ate ice cream and toffee and chocolate and cheesecake until he was gagging, but he loved it. Sugar was his favorite thing on earth, maybe excluding The Ramones and Draco Malfoy.<br/>
Although out of all of the sweets he ate, the one he wouldn't be able to live without was donuts. Harry would drool just thinking about them.<br/>
He shrugged at Hermione.<br/>
"Hey guys," Draco interrupted, holding up a magazine. The glossy page was a photo of some guitarist, with bleach blond hair with a red strip in it. "D'ya think I should spell my hair like this?"<br/>
"You don't know any color-changing spells, genius." Said Pansy, elbowing Seamus, who seemed to have fallen asleep with his head in his cereal bowl.<br/>
"I know I don't, but guess who does." Draco rested his elbows on the table and turned towards Hermione. Before he could even say anything, her answer came out.<br/>
"No way, Draco."<br/>
"But why?" Draco moaned.<br/>
Hermione sighed and looked up at her friend, raising her eyebrows like it was the most obvious answer in the world.<br/>
"It's completely against the rules."<br/>
"Ugh." Draco slumped in defeat. Hermione was stubborn, and there was no way she would ever change her mind about it.<br/>
"I'll help you with it!" Said Seamus, fringe still wet with milk.<br/>
Ron turned to the Irish. "Seamus, no offence, but you have a tendency to set things on fire. What would Daddy Malfoy do if he found out Draco had a bald patch at fifteen?"<br/>
Seamus nodded, as though to say fair enough.<br/>
"Why are you guys so tired anyway?" Harry gestured to the rest of his friends, excluding Draco. "Aren't you meant to be all bright-eyed-and-bushy-tailed and shit?"<br/>
They all turned to glare at Tracey and Pansy.<br/>
"They thought it would be just a fantastic idea to try to enchant Flitwick's chalk. We were up all night running around trying to avoid getting caught. Y'know, very Breakfast Club style." Explained Hermione. Seamus and Harry laughed at the muggle reference, but the others just seemed confused.<br/>
"Anyway," said Draco, which one of you is gonna help me?" He handed the magazine to Tracey.<br/>
"Harry?" He pleaded. His puppy dog eyes were hard to resist.<br/>
"I think," Tracey decided, after careful consideration, "That this is a photo of a woman." She held up the magazine for the others to see. Various oohs, ahs, and I see it nowâ€™s sounded across the table.<br/>
"Well congrats to Dracanna on her new 'do." Ron gave a slight bow.<br/>
"It'll really bring out your eyes." Harry joked.<br/>
The Slytherin boy murmured, "Shut up, losers." Before playfully attempting to hit his friends.<br/>
Harry ate his donut. </p><p>***</p><p>"Oh my god. Oh my fucking god."<br/>
Harry tried desperately to contain the laughter that threatened to spill out of his mouth. He took a bite out of his cupcake.<br/>
Draco continued to look into the bathroom mirror in horror.<br/>
There was something about the expression on the Slytherin's face that made Harry lose it. He collapsed, screeching in laughter. He was as red as his tie. Tears streamed out of his eyes, and his whole body was shaking.<br/>
"There is nothing funny about this, Harry." Draco said, with faux anger.<br/>
"Your hair..." Harry wheezed, "Looks like ice cream!" He exploded with laughter again.<br/>
Harry wasn't actually wrong. In an attempt to spell a red streak into Draco's blond locks, the boys had managed to instead spell multiple streaks bright pink, and made them swirl together. Draco's head really did look a lot like a strawberry and vanilla ice cream.<br/>
Draco huffed. He wanted to be angry, he truly did, but Harry's maniacal laughter lightened the mood quite a bit.<br/>
"Hey, don't be a dick about it."<br/>
Harry just laughed harder.<br/>
"Hey!" Suddenly, Draco tackled the Gryffindor, and they tumbled onto the floor. Harry stopped laughing. This was the sort of play fighting they'd done in their first year, before they'd started to grow out of it. Wrestling Draco was different now. When they were 11, they'd been about the same height and weight, and Harry had been only slightly stronger. Now, Draco's spindly limbs and skinny frame gave him an advantage. He was stronger now, too. Eventually, Draco had Harry pinned directly beneath him, a smug smile on his face.<br/>
Harry looked up at the boy above him, and tried desperately to ignore Draco's thigh pressed against his dick.<br/>
"Hah, look who's laughing now, Potter!" Draco said, clearly proud of himself.<br/>
"Get off me, you git!" Harry struggled against Draco in vain. The Slytherin had Harry's hands pinned above his head, and was sprawled onto him.<br/>
Draco brought his face close enough to the Gryffindor's for Harry to feel his breath on his face. Draco's eyes, cool and icy, were fixed on him.<br/>
"Now, Draco, what would Daddy Malfoy think about this?" As soon as the words left Harry's mouth, the taller boy's expression changed. He raised his eyebrows, like he was challenging the younger boy. Although he looked confident, Harry could have sworn he saw a glint of fear, or guilt, flickering in hose blue eyes. Harry frowned. He hadn't meant to upset his friend; this was just the sort of thing they joked about. Harry didn't have time to think though; he took advantage of Draco's moment of weakness to push the Slytherin onto his back, meaning Harry now had the upper hand.<br/>
"You're a queer." Draco said, blatantly.<br/>
"Am not."<br/>
"Are too."<br/>
"How would you know?"<br/>
"The whole school knows by now, Potter."<br/>
Harry bit his lip, taking in Draco's features. His cheekbones were defined and sharp, like he was made from marble.<br/>
Harry prayed to just about every god he could think of that Draco wouldn't notice Harry's slowly hardening dick pressed into his thigh.<br/>
"Get off me, Malfoy." He spat, his voice cracking slightly. </p><p>As they dusted themselves off and Harry promised to fix Draco's hair, Draco's mind was swimming. On the outside, he was just as sarcastic and witty as usual, but his brain hurt. Draco knew that he loved by different rules to his friends. He was a Malfoy. He had a legacy, and a reputation to uphold.<br/>
Because, from a very young age, Draco was made very aware of things a Malfoy should never do. Although he thought that most of these rules were bullshit, he couldn't help but hear them in the back of his mind whenever he broke one.<br/>
A Malfoy should never be a poor man.<br/>
A Malfoy should never love a mudblood.<br/>
A Malfoy should never fail a test.<br/>
A Malfoy should never be a homosexual. </p><p>Â </p><p>Sometimes, when Draco wanked off, he thought about boys. There was nothing wrong with it; it was just a normal thing that he did. He wasn't gay, he really wasn't. He just found something about watching them so enchanting. Girls were hot, there was no denying that, but there was something about boys. The way they rolled their sleeves up, exposing muscled arms, and the way they looked when they concentrated.<br/>
Girls were gorgeous, but boys were interesting. If Draco were to analyze his psyche, he'd realize that he was attracted to the taboo of liking boys. He was in love with the wrongness of it. Of course, if his friends knew, he'd never hear the end of it. They weren't homophobic, per say, but throwing the term "gay" around was the base of many of their playful insults.<br/>
When Draco had first started wanking, at 12, he'd been terrified of those thoughts. Sometimes, between the pages of a playboy he'd found in Seamus' wardrobe, and images of Kate Moss, he'd think about guys. Not on purpose, of course. He'd started to think about boys in a way he didn't think he could.<br/>
And that was that.<br/>
What worried him, however, was that he'd started to think about Gryffindor robes and green eyes.<br/>
He'd push them out of his mind, letting blondes with big boobs back into the center of his attention, but when he came, they always returned. Scruffy black hair and smirks took over whenever Draco lost control.<br/>
Oh God.</p>
