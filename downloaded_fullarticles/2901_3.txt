          <div class="userstuff"><p>Here’s Harry Potter: he’s standing, panting, angry, tired</p>
<p>Here’s Minerva McGonagall: proud, thinking she shouldn’t be, not shocked, thinking she should be</p>
<p>Here’s Alecto Carrow: in pain, in pain, in pain</p>
<p>Here, two years earlier, is Bellatrix Lestrange: laughing, triumphant, painless</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is Harry Potter, unafraid of death, unaware of death</p>
<p>Here is Harry Potter, spat on for ten years of life, every street corner a new sneering face</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is Harry Potter, eleven years old:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He never knew his parents: orphan</p>
<p>Orphan, orphan; oh, he knows the word, knows the meaning</p>
<p>Knows what he is:</p>
<p>Orphan, unwanted.</p>
<p>Death means nothing, death means only death didn’t want him any more than life does</p>
<p>Eleven, he learns that death was never permanent, not for him</p>
<p>Not for the man who killed him,</p>
<p>The man who killed his parents,</p>
<p>But then his parents might never have really been there at all</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(thirteen, he knows they existed, knows they had friends, knows –</p>
<p>seventeen, knows they have been mourned)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is Harry Potter, fourteen</p>
<p>Death still hasn’t met him, not really</p>
<p>He has met death, met his parents, smiled at them, heard their voices, but that does not mean they ever lived, no it doesn’t</p>
<p>He hasn’t met death</p>
<p>He didn’t know Cedric, the way he didn’t know his mother, his father</p>
<p>What was his middle name? His favourite colour?</p>
<p>What did he want to be when he grew up?</p>
<p>Why did he enter a game where he might meet death?</p>
<p>Why did he die?</p>
<p>If Harry Potter, fourteen, knew this then maybe he could have known death</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is Harry Potter, fifteen</p>
<p>He has never met death</p>
<p>Here is Bellatrix Lestrange, not in pain despite that she should be, shouldn’t she? Shouldn’t she?</p>
<p>There was Sirius Black</p>
<p>Harry Potter, fifteen, would mourn him</p>
<p>But why should he?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Death is nothing real.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is Minerva McGonagall:</p>
<p>Disrespected, like she is a nothing boy in a good neighbourhood</p></div>
