    <p>“You thought that you could just stroll into my business and demand to see me? That’s not how it works Little Red.” his voice, like honey seeped into the air of her kitchen. She had gone to his place of business, if one could call it that, and she had probably demanded to see him. He had sent her an angry letter about how she needed to stay out of it - whatever that meant. </p><p>“Then tell me how it works because I’ve covered for you and covered for you. I’ve let all the stories go, I’ve decided in best interest to keep your name out of the papers. I’ve helped you keep the Malfoy name out of light. Why are you breaking into my house in the middle of the night? I’m literally in muggle London Malfoy, my husband is home! My kids are home! Get out of here. I’ll meet you for coffee or tea or something.” Rose pulled her robe closed when she felt his eyes lingering on her exposed skin causing a blush to creep down up her cheeks. </p><p>“Oh Weasley-“ </p><p>Rose glared at the use of her surname and she quickly held up a hand “It’s Scamander now and you know that.” </p><p>“Lysander or Lorcan I forget...?” he looked unbothered and it bothered Rose given their history and their history was messy.</p><p>“Lorcan.. Lily is with Ly-“ he waved a hand at her to get her to stop talking. </p><p>“Anyway I didn’t come for small talk, Weasley.” He made a point to use her surname again. </p><p>“What did you come for?” Rose was confused and agitated, it was nearly midnight on a Sunday - and here he was showing up to her home unannounced, not bothering to knock or give any forewarning. </p><p>“Those pictures... you have recently acquired; I need them.” He didn’t hesitate to come closer to her, she took a step back uncomfortable with the shortage in distance. </p><p>“I don’t know what pictures you’re talking about?” </p><p>“Oh Rosie, you’re not stupid and your acting skills have always sucked. Give. Me. The. Fucking. Pictures.” He was incredibly close to her and it made her hairs stand on end, her anxiety was in overdrive and she felt like she couldn’t breathe. </p><p>“Are you watching me?” Rose was watching his facial features carefully, “What do you have to do with that rundown place anyhow?” </p><p>“That rundown place is funded by me, they work for me.” </p><p>“Malfoy. I didn’t know that.” Her arms clutched at her robe, holding it closed and closer to her body. </p><p>“Not many do, Weasley. So I’m gonna need you to start running all things media by me.”</p><p>“If there’s something you don’t want someone finding out about maybe you shouldn’t do them.” She hadn’t meant for it to drip venom but it did and she regretted it as soon as the words came out of her mouth. </p><p>“Maybe, just maybe, you should eat your own words and tell Lorcan about our daughter.” Scorpius’ eyes were darker than his normal shade of grey and he all but restrained himself with personal space. </p><p>“She’s not your daughter. Stop using her against me.” Rose stuttered out, her eyes stinging a little by the shock. </p><p>“Bullshit she’s not my daughter. She’s a Malfoy and you know it.” </p><p>“Her birth certificate says Scamander so politely fuck off.” Rose huffed out, her words shaky from the anxiety of the confrontation. </p><p>“Is that why you had her in a muggle birth center? So the magic birth certificates wouldn’t out you?” Rose’s breath caught at his words, her daughter, their daughter whom had pale blonde hair and her mother’s hazel brown eyes did in fact resemble the Malfoy family line. She knew a magical birth certificate wouldn’t have allowed Lorcan to sign it, she was sure he knew it too. Lorcan had always been aware of the scandal, he just chose to ignore it. </p><p>“It doesn’t give you a right to just come in my house!” Rose expressed, her hands gesturing around the room.</p><p>“I want the pictures.”</p><p>“You can have them just leave.” </p><p>“Pictures first, Rose.” He was leaning against her counter, his hair was pulled back into a bun and he had tattoos on his neck - Rose took him in fully this time; holding her breath as she studied him. </p><p>Rose let out the breath she’d been holding and went into the living room to retrieve the pictures, “Delete whatever article you have on it also.” </p><p>Rose took her wand and engulfed the page into flames, “Want me to burn the pictures or do you want them?” </p><p>“I want them.” Rose collected the different photographs she had sprawled out across her desk and basically threw them into his arms. </p><p>“Now leave.” She pushed him towards the front door as she spoke, literally pushed. He gave her a glare, but softened up almost immediately when he saw the little girl on the staircase. </p><p>“Mummy?” Lyra, her oldest. Her blonde haired firecracker, who had an attitude to be petrified of, stood at the bottom of the stairs clutching a stuffed animal cat.’</p><p>“It’s okay love, why don’t you go lay back down and I’ll be up there in a second?” Rose pointed back up the stairs, “I’m sure Miles will keep you safe.” </p><p>“Who’s he? Where’s dad?” The sleepy child rubbed her eyes and clutched Miles the stuffed cat to her chest. </p><p>Rose tried to ignore the pained look on Scorpius’ face, “Just one of mummy’s friends from work - right?” </p><p>She shot him a pleading look, “Just a little bit of business that’s all dear.” He smiled at the eight year old before waving and going out the door on his own accord. </p><p>Rose went to retuck her daughter into bed, moving her perfect blonde hair out of her face. She hadn’t realized Lorcan was out of bed, she also hadn’t realized he was standing in the doorway. </p><p>“Wanna tell me why Scorpius Malfoy was in our house?” Lorcan crossed his arms and leaned into the door frame. </p><p>“He - erm- wanted some pictures I’d taken back. I’d left a message with Mabini Inc. but he didn’t get back to me during normal business times.” Rose pushed past him and threw her robe over the door hook.</p><p>“I know you don’t want to steer the pot Rosie, but what can he do? You can’t just keep letting stories go because he doesn’t want you too.”  He closed the door quietly, so he wouldn’t wake the twins up. </p><p>“How much did you hear?” Rose raised her eyebrows at her husband. </p><p>“Enough Rosie, enough.” His eyes fell on Lyra’s picture on the night stand and onto Rose, he looked sad- disappointed. Not mad, just hurt. </p><p>“You.. you knew there was a chance.” Rose caught the lump in her throat and almost forced it back down feeling like she could throw up her entire dinner from earlier. </p><p>“Regardless of whatever she’s my daughter; you know that.” Lorcan gave her a small smile, which was almost a frown in disguise. “Just keep him away from her, please.”</p><p>“What if I can’t?” Rose asked as she pulled the sheets back to get in their bed. </p><p>“What do you mean?” He asked, looking genuinely concerned. </p><p>“What if he wants to push for it? How do we go about it?” Rose inquires, fiddling with her hands. </p><p>“We’ll cross that bridge when we start drowning.” And with that Lorcan shut off the light.</p>
