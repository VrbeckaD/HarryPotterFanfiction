</p><p>Halloween otherwise known as Samhain to the magical word was slowly coming to a close as parents tucked their tired yet happy children into bed as their pile of hard earned candy bounced around in their thoughts.</p><p>In the west country of Britain laid a wizarding village aptly named, Godric's Hollow. In a cottage-style house underneath a rather strong Fidelius charm was the Potter family. The Potter family was made up of four magical people, one feisty cat, a barmy owl, and jokingly on occasion a black dog named Padfoot. The head of the family was a handsome boyish man known as James Charles Potter, the son of Charles and Dorea Potter. He was rather tall but lankly with knobby knees and wild unruly jet-black hair. His eyes were the color of hazelnuts and magnetized by his circular glasses he wore on his face. It was always noted James wore a smirk when he was witnessing mischievousness going on around him.</p><p>The matriarch and the right hand of the head was a stunningly beautiful and vivacious woman known as Lily Jesanie Potter, the daughter of Apollo and Holly Evans. She was petite and dainty with rose colored hair that fell into waves at her shoulders. Her eyes were the color of uncut emeralds that shined with warmth and happiness. It was viewed by many that she was considered the world's brightest and kindest witch that had ever graced Hogwarts.</p><p>The last two Potters happened to be fraternal twins born at the end of July causing them to be prospects of a prophecy that involved a Dark Lord who was trying to kill them. The youngest of the twins was Ralston James Potter whose Godfather was the bookish and chocolate obsessed Remus Lupin. He came into the world with a loud mighty cry and did not settle until long after midnight against his mother's cool breast. He had inherited his father's look from the jet-black unruly hair to the hazel eyes.</p><p>The eldest twin and heiress to the Potter family was Sage Siria Potter whose Godfather was James Potter's brother in all but blood, Sirius Black. She came into the world nearly silent only letting out soft coos as she was held against her mother's other breast. While Ralston had taken after his father in looks, she had taken after her mother with rose colored hair and emerald eyes.</p><p>On this auspicious night, the Potter's all sat on the couch listening to Lily as she read a bedtime story to Ralston and Sage. All was quiet and content until the alarms went off causing James and Lily to pale. James bolted from the couch wand clenched into his fist. "Lily, take Ralston and Sage, go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off!" he cried to his wife who clutched both their children to her.</p><p>"James." she whimpered running towards the steps.</p><p>"Go!" he hollered as the front door was blow in. Lily took one last look at her husband and fled to the nursery with her panicked and startled children.</p><p>Voldemort's crimson eyes glanced slightly amused at James who stood defiantly before him, "Potter." he greeted calmly as if he was there for a social call.</p><p>"I won't allow you near my children." he hissed venomously.</p><p>Voldemort snarled as he banished James causing him to land on part of the stairs knocking him out. "Pathetic blood traitor!" he hissed out as he began to walk up the steps and over his body. "I'll drag down their cooling corpses for you to see before I allow the privy of death to claim you."</p><p>Lily was bent down in front of Sage's crib that held the twins with tears falling down her cheeks as she finished casting her spell allowing the runes covered in her blood to light up briefly. "Ralston, Sage, you are so loved. So loved. Mama loves you. Daddy loves you. Ralston, Sage, be safe, be strong." she stood and gave Sage a kiss on her forehead. She heard the footsteps of her would-be killer and the door to the nursery blew open. "Please!" she begged turning to face Voldemort who glared coldly at her. "NOT RALSTON! NOT SAGE!"</p><p>"STAND ASIDE!" he demanded brandishing his wand and pointed it at her.</p><p>"PLEASE NO!" she begged standing while her hands gripped the crib blocking his view of the twins.</p><p>"STAND ASIDE NOW YOU STUPID SILLY GIRL!" he barked out giving her only one more chance for his loyal follower who had pleaded for him to spare her.</p><p>Lily Evans the brave woman only shook her head once in defiance, "PLEASE TAKE ME! NOT RALSTON AND SAGE! TAKE ME INSTEAD!" she screamed allowing the last of the ritual to finish right at eleven-fifty-nine on the dot.</p><p>"ENOUGH!" he shouted as the deadly green light shot from his wand and hit Lily causing her to give an agonizing scream before falling to the floor in front of the crib dead. He then walked and stared into the crib with a disgusted look on his face. Ralston who had fallen asleep as soon as he was placed in the crib laid facing away drool running thick from his mouth. Sage, however, was completely awake staring up at Voldemort with wide green eyes filled with tears. "One of you two holds the power to vanquish me?" he muttered in disbelief as his wand tip pointed out towards Sage. "Ridiculous." he sneered as he stared back cooly into the green eyes of Sage. "Avada Kedavra," he whispered the green light stretching out of his wand and hitting Sage right on her wrist causing a lighting bolt wound to appear. Suddenly it was as if a bomb had gone off as Voldemort was blown away while feeling the most gut-wrenching pain ever, he realized in utter rage and disbelief his body turned to dust and a black vapor fled the scene.</p>

</p><p>It was early in the morning, four at least and the sky was still a pitch black when James Potter came to with a groan followed by several hisses of pain. "Lily, kids." James whimpered as the memory of red eyes filled his vision before heartbreak from betrayal took over. "Peter why?" he whispered as he shakily stood hand pressed against the wall to steady himself.</p><p>Limping slowly up the steps James made his way down the hall towards the nursery trying to prepare himself for the inevitable. Hobbling into the nursery he sees the large hole in the ceiling and some in the crib and Lily on the ground staring up at him with unseeing blank green eyes once filled with life. He hears crying and his heart aches with relief as he turns to the crib and finds his children alive. Ralston was sobbing as he clutched his head and James quickly picked him up to soothe him. Wiping the blood away from his forehead he found a V-shaped wound. "Hush, Ralston." he cooed out softly as he turned to lift Sage out of the crib and looked her over briefly to find no wounds of her own. (the lighting bolt scar was hidden by the long sleeves of her onesie.) "Sage." he cooed softly staring at the miniature version of his wife.</p><p>He turned towards the stairs tense as he heard thumping before he sees Hagrid's surprised face, James, ye's alive?" he asked gaping stunned.</p><p>Suddenly James saw professor Dumbledore walk quietly up behind Hagrid and he too stopped stunned, "What's going!" James demanded gently stepping over his wife.</p><p>"James the alarms went off and Peter told us he found both of you dead and the kids were alive. We had to wait for the rest of the wards to crumble before we could get through to check the children." Dumbledore stated softly as he stared down sadly at Lily's body. "Voldemort is gone and the witches and wizards would like to know who did it," Dumbledore stated calmly as he held up his wand. "May I?" he gestured kindly at the children.</p><p>James was hesitant for a moment before allowing a nod of acceptance, "Alright." he mumbled cradling them closer towards his chest.</p><p>Dumbledore waved his wand over Ralston 's head for a moment then turning to Sage and doing the same with her. "I see," he mumbled quietly underneath his breath. "I have good news and bad news."</p><p>"What's the good news?" James uttered staring at Albus with a hard look.</p><p>"It seems Ralston here is the child of prophecy. See the marked V on his forehead. It stated he would mark him as his equal. Voldemort is the self-proclaimed name of our dark lord that seems fitting doesn't it?"</p><p>"And the bad news?" James whispered hazel eyes glinting warily.</p><p>Dumbledore looked solemn as he spoke, "The attack from Voldemort followed by the backlash of Ralston has render Sage a squib."</p><p>James sucked in a sharp breath as Hagrid awkwardly looked away, "Are you sure?" He whispered hoping the light wizard and leader of the resistance was wrong.</p><p>"I'm sorry, James." was his soft reply only.</p><p>"That's okay." James shrugged lazily, his eyes briefly watery at the thought his daughter couldn't know the joy magic. "I'll raise her the best I can, so she knows I love her either way." He determinedly said. "Least I can do for Lily." He ended as he finally felt the shaking of his shoulders from grief.</p><p>"James I don't think it's a good idea for Sage to stay with you," Dumbledore spoke softly his bright blue eyes twinkling with knowing.</p><p>"Albus I thought you of all people wouldn't be prejudice." James hissed with force clutching his daughter perhaps a tad tighter than normal.</p><p>"James calm down." Albus implored softly. "You know I am the furthest from being so narrow-minded like many folks here in Great Britain. Voldemort is only temporarily gone, one day he will be back and anyone of Ralston's friends or loved ones could be targeted. Sage growing up in the limelight of her brother without the magic of her own to boot would just make her grow bitter. I don't think Lily would want that for her child, do you?"</p><p>"No," James mumbled as he smoothed down his daughter's hair. "Lily wouldn't want that."</p><p>"I believe Lily left a basic blood protection behind to protect her children. It's fueled by the love shared between blood. I think Lily's sister Petunia who is a muggle could best care for Sage."</p><p>"Petunia and Lily never got on well, I don't know if she is willing to take Sage in," James warned softly as he watched Albus conjure a white cloth to cover Lily's body.</p>

  <b>November 6th, 1981</b>
</p><p>Petunia Dursley nee' Evans remembers the exact date she lost her best friend and sweet sister too magic. They were eight and twelve when that horrid little boy jumped from behind that bush and spouted off things that should have made Lily fear him.</p><p>But, she muses idly with a small fond smile as she sat in the coffee shop that Lily never truly learned to fear anything and perhaps that's why she placed in the house of the brave. She briefly wipes away the stray tear from her face as she looks up to the ding over the door to find her late sister's husband. It seems he to perhaps seen better days. His greasy hair was wildly unkempt and could do with a wash while his eyes were sunken in on his pale face minus the parts covered by a growing stubble. "Potter." she greeted stiffly sliding over a cup of lukewarm tea.</p><p>James looked wearily over towards Lily's sister and he could see a slight resemblance between the two. Petunia's hair fell down to her lower back, wavy ringlets fondly reminding James of a younger Lily with long hair. Her blonde hair with highlights of red in it shone brightly underneath the bulbs from the ceiling. Her almond-shaped eyes were the color of the ocean with hints of green blended in. "Petunia." he greeted tiredly.</p><p>Petunia must have seen something flash in his hazel eyes before her shoulder slumped down, "James what do you want from me? Hasn't your world taken enough?" she whispered so softly Anyone else would have missed it but the flinch James gave indicated he had heard her.</p><p>"It's about Sage," James states softly as he folds away the blanket covering the tiny toddler which was strapped snuggled across his chest.</p><p>Petunia felt her breath hitch a bit as the familiar rose-colored hair came into view, "May I?" she croaked softly shaky hands held out towards the bundle. James swiftly yet gently passed off a dozing Sage into Petunia's arms without a second thought. Petunia stared hard at the tiny toddler as her fingers traced her rosy cheeks to the long curl of hair that laid in the center of her forehead. Sage, however, decided to be done with sleeping and had opened her blurry eyes to stare up at the stranger who was holding her calmly. Petunia inhaled sharply as she numbly took in those familiar emerald colored eyes. "She looks just like-"</p><p>"Lily." James finished softly with a pained look. "Look, Petunia I brought Sage because she's not safe and has nowhere else to go but here."</p><p>"What do you mean?" Petunia inquired softly with concern as her eyes continued to greedily take in Sage's features.</p><p>"Sage's twin Ralston is famous in our world now known for defeating he-who-must-not-be-named. They have been calling him the Boy-Who-Lived." James muttered with slight annoyance. "What the rest of the masses do not realize is that one day that madman will be back and after Ralston along with anyone he cares for. Sage is a squib, she would be an easy target to acquire to use against Ralston." James informs swiftly underneath his breath.</p><p>"HE'S NOT DEAD!" Petunia roared in horror as she clutched Sage to her chest as if to protect her.</p><p>"Quiet!" James hissed taking his wand and tossing a slight notice-me-not charm bubble around them to make the people who had stared at the racket Petunia made to completely ignore them as if they hadn't even been there in the first place. "This is top information, keep it a secret please," he begged softly.</p><p>"Alright, Potter," she grunted softly as she ran her fingers through her niece's hair. "What exactly is a squib?" she mumbled as a faint blush flared across her cheeks due to her embarrassment of not knowing.</p><p>"A squib is the opposite of a muggle," James informed Petunia and upon seeing her confused look he explained it further. "A muggle is someone who was born without the ability to use magic. A muggle-born is someone who was born with magic but whose parents are both muggles. Though most won't admit to the theory that Muggle-borns are just witches and wizards coming from a long line of squibs from both sides who decided to marry and produced a magical child. Purebloods are magical users who can trace their magical heritage back to the middle ages and sometimes even further without an ounce of muggle or Muggle-born. This, of course, is a lie, from the interbreeding and such few purebloods, they have to add fresh blood or run the risk of becoming much like the Gaunts. Then you finally have half-bloods which are born from one either a pureblood and muggle-born or a pureblood and a muggle." he explained hazel eyes twinkling kindly. "You are what they would call a muggle though Lily often thought you were a squib because she remembers at times you would do small amounts of magic much like squibs can do as a child. Sage is like I said a squib."</p><p>Petunia could feel the hum of Sage's magic much like she did with Lily's when they both were children and stared at James wondering if perhaps his grief was not allowing him to see sense. "James Lily would never have squib children." Petunia began to explain slowly as she stared at James with a glint in her blue eyes. "Lily was a wonderfully bright and powerful witch. She had such control of her magic even before she entered Hogwarts or met that strange boy."</p><p>"Petunia the best magical and powerful user in the world did the scan and told us she was a squib." James began in a slightly condescending tone. "If he says she's a squib, then she is a squib and I cannot handle her now that Ralston needs all the attention and training in hopes to survive this."</p><p>Petunia sat stunned while she clutched one of the two things that connected her to Lily to her chest softly. She wonders how her little sister could have married someone so selfish and rude like this man before her. A man who willingly would toss one of his children aside for favor of the other. "Paperwork?" she bites out as she cradles Sage into her left arm so she can use her right hand to write.</p><p>James pulled out a thick folder and slid it over, "Those are both her muggle and magical birth certificates. The muggle adoption is on top and the magical one is at the bottom."</p><p>Petunia read the muggle papers before signing them and then moving on to read over the magical one before stopping in confusion at one part. "What does heir clause mean?"</p><p>James scratched the back of his neck as he looked away out the window at the hustle and bustle of the muggles. "Sage was born first which means she was supposed to become the heiress of the Potter family. Since she is a squib, she cannot take over at all. When she is eleven the Potter magic will leave her since she will not be going to Hogwarts. The family magic will pass to her brother making him the heir to the Potter line."</p><p>"And hypothetically if Sage turns out to not be a squib?" she croaks out.</p><p>"Well she would die," he spoke grimly as he watched as Petunia signed the last of the documents making Sage officially hers in both worlds.</p><p>"Oh." Petunia faintly mutters as she stuffs the folder full of legal work into her purse before standing up and taking the diaper bag from James. "James." she hums absentmindedly as she walks towards the door.</p><p>"Yes?" he muttered as he cleans his glasses with his shirt.</p><p>"Lily would have been so disappointed." she scowls out before leaving the building and walking to her car.</p>
<hr/><p>In the county of Surrey on a suburban street in Little Whinging was Private Drive a rather droll looking place. All the high middle-class people who lived here were rich, snobby, and nosy in Petunia's opinion as her nose scrunched up at the thought of how all the houses were nearly identical as well. She hears the front door open and the greeting of her husband causes her to go tense as her eyes fall to where Sage was asleep in front of the fireplace. "Pet, I'm home."</p><p>"In here Vernon." was Petunia's way of greeting her husband whom she no longer loved or adored. The love she had for him shriveled up and died the day her baby son Dudley did.</p><p>"What is that? Vernon hissed venomously as he pointed a beefy finger at her niece and now adoptive daughter.</p><p>"Lily died Vernon." Petunia whispered brokenly as she sat down her teacup with a light clink. "Sage was abandoned by her father, I took her in."</p><p>"Can she do you-know-what?" he demands still glaring at the toddler with hate-filled eyes.</p><p>"Of course she can do magic, she's my sister's daughter." snapped Petunia back to her troll of her husband.</p><p>"Then that freak can't stay here!" Vernon roared. "I won't have that nonsense up in my house, Petunia!"</p><p>"Vernon, no." Petunia firmly stated against her husband ignoring how his face was turning purple.</p><p>"NO! I WILL NOT HAVE A FREAK AROUND MY CHILD! I'LL SMOTHER HER IF I HAVE TOO!" roared Vernon causing Sage to wake up.</p><p>"Get out," Petunia spoke calmly as she gripped the edge of her dress.</p><p>"What?" Vernon sputtered.</p><p>Petunia stood up and glared fiercely at Vernon, "GET OUT!" she bellowed. "HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT MY NIECE THAT WAY! I WANT A DIVORCE!"</p><p>Vernon spluttered incoherent words before standing up straighter and glared at Petunia, "Like you will leave me Petunia! You are out of your mind if you think I'm going to allow my kid to grow up with a freak!" he hissed staring at Petunia's pregnant belly which was filled with life.</p><p>"YOU LOST THE CHANCE TO BE A FATHER WHEN YOU ALLOWED MARGE TO KILL OUR SON!" she screamed back as tears poured down her face and the lights in the house began to flicker. "WHO LEAVES A BABY IN A CAR ON A HOT SUMMER DAY!" The glass in the windows slowly cracked as if under pressure. "LEAVE AT ONCE AND DON'T BOTHER COMING BACK!"</p><p>Vernon's eyes flickered with brief fear before they glinted with malice. "I'll be back freak! I won't allow my child to be stuck here" he hissed spitefully before turning and walking out the door. </p>
