    <p>She was on fire. From the tips of her toes to the crackling frizz of hair on her head. The heat consumed her, swallowed her whole, and digested her as if she were doused in kerosene. She was suffocating, ash and glass coated her throat as she cried out for mercy in ragged, gasping breaths.</p><p>Somewhere in the distance, Ron screamed her name. She was glad for it, because she could hardly remember what it was. For ten minutes straight, she was ‘Mudblood’ and ‘Filth’.</p><p>Not Granger or Hermione or Mione.</p><p>Mudblood. Filth. Dirty. Disgusting. Tainted.</p><p>She cried, a screech through tired windpipes as something carved into her arm. She couldn’t concentrate on what it was, but it felt poisonous, acidic, the most painful thing she’d ever experienced. A flurry of dark, manic curls hung over her face and the smile on her face was wicked, vile. Bellatrix Lestrange licked her teeth and cackled as she pressed the cursed blade further into Hermione’s arm.</p><p>She begged for it to nick an artery. God, please let her bleed out and take the pain away. Her legs kicked and head twisted back and forth with wild pleas on her tongue. Stop, please, please, stop.</p><p>But it continued. On and on until she thought she’d faint from the pain. It traveled up her nerves, curled around her shoulder. Her heart hammered, slammed so hard against her sternum that she was sure it would blow a hole through her bones.</p><p>She yelled as the blade moved up her arm. The droplets of blood running down her skin tickled in a way that agitated more than amused. Hermione wanted to die, she wanted it to end, she begged for it to be done.</p><p>And finally— <em> finally </em> Bellatrix sat up, straddling her hips to pin her in place, and laughed merrily at her family to point out what she’d done.</p><p>Hermione cried. Tear tracks rolled down her dirt-coated face. The salt stung the place on her tongue she’d bit so hard she nearly drew blood. Still, she lifted her head. Her neck felt kinked, her skull heavy as it moved from the oak floors and stared down at her mangled arm.</p><p>
  <em> Mudblood. </em>
</p><p>It stared her in the face. Bloody. Dirty. Cursed.</p><p>Her head slammed back into the wood and her world went black.</p><p>When she came to, Malfoy Manor’s drawing room floor no longer stretched beneath her. Instead, she sat upright at a wooden table in a dimly lit room with strange music playing faintly. The scent of whisky on the air burned her nose.</p><p>Her breath still came in gasps and she twitched on the creaky chair. Her eyes darted to her bare forearm where she saw the heinous word glaring back at her. Blood oozed from the wound. It stung down to her bone. Tears continued to fall from her eyes. Labeled forever, she assumed, a Mudblood.</p><p>The room she woke up in wasn’t familiar. It was too old, too dingy to be Malfoy Manor. Perhaps they moved her somewhere more fitting for her status. She wondered if Voldemort would come for her now or if he’d send another death eater to finish her off. She thought of Harry and Ron, of letting them down. Her heart clenched harder and harder until she grabbed at her chest and silently begged for an end.</p><p>A man appeared in front of her out of thin air. Just popped into existence without any preamble. He was tall, broad-shouldered, wearing a Head Boy badge, and his hair fell in chaotic fringe over his forehead. He didn’t seem to notice her as he patted his body and whispered furiously to himself.</p><p>“E-excuse me?” Hermione’s voice cracked on every syllable. Her raw, bloody throat tightened as she tried to force the words out.</p><p>He looked up and she gasped, wincing around the sound. It wasn’t Harry — the eyes weren’t right. No, she knew this person from photographs and memories. </p><p>James Potter grinned at her from across the table.</p><p>“Oh, hello!” He waved his hand and glanced around. “You don’t happen to know, er, where I am, do you?”</p><p>Hermione shook her head and swiped at her eyes. She felt the dirt push around her skin and dropped her gaze to the table, ashamed. Her hand covered the derogatory mark on her arm.</p><p>“Are you alright?” He seemed genuinely concerned, the timber of his voice dropping as he stood from the chair and walked to her.</p><p>What was he doing here and where were they? Was she out of her mind? Did it finally betray her? Or was she dead, and granted the release she longed for before she passed out? Hermione swallowed around a thick knot in her throat and tried not to cry more.</p><p>His hand rested on her shoulder and his face ducked down so that she was forced to look at him. She flinched away. “Hey— hey, it’s alright. I won’t hurt you.”</p><p>“Please don’t touch me.” The words squeezed through her ground teeth.</p><p>James removed his hand from her gently. He crouched down in front of her. His smile was nice, she thought, but she didn’t much feel like smiling then. Instead, she stared at him with wide, fearful eyes.</p><p>“So, did you just show up here, too?” His eyes flickered across her face and her hair, down her old jumper, and finally where her hand was curled protectively over the cuts on her arm. She flinched and he brought his gaze back to hers.</p><p>“Yes. I— I think I fainted and then I woke up here.” She licked her lips, but there was no relief from how parched they were from yelling for so long. “Am I dead?”</p><p>“What?” James looked alarmed and stood up straight. His body whipped around and he thrummed with nervous energy as he took in their surroundings. She could feel it as easily as she could feel her own anxiety dancing along her spine. “Better not be. I was having a whale of time and if this moldy old pub is my afterlife, I’m going to ask for a transfer.”</p><p>“I just — I don’t know why you’d be here with me if I’m not—not—” Her body shook. Shock, she thought as she gripped onto any part of her she could reach and squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>“Magic?” She felt him pull his chair close but she refused to open her eyes to look at him. “I mean, I was minding my own business and enjoying Christmas hols, and then suddenly — a wall of whisky.”</p><p>“Christmas?” The word escaped despite the ache in her lungs.</p><p>It wasn’t Christmas. That was ages ago, before the locket, before Ron, before the snatchers. Hermione’s breathing increased, rapid breaths shooting from between her lips faster than she could control. Her shoulders heaved under the weight of it. All the color drained from her face.</p><p>“Whoa, whoa, calm down.” James patted her on the shoulder, but she scooted her chair back violently and jumped from it.</p><p>“Telling someone to calm down <em> doesn’t </em> make them <em> calm down </em>.” The words tore from her and they hurt but she was furious and panicking and afraid.</p><p>He stood, too, and towered over her. “I’m sorry. Merlin— shit; you<em> are </em>a witch, right?”</p><p>Her eyes darted to her uncovered arm and she winced. His gaze followed and before she could stop him, James grabbed her wrist and pulled her marred flesh to his eyes to inspect it. He blanched.</p><p>“What happened to you?” He demanded an answer, but his tone was soft. He stepped into her space just a little bit more and gently let his thumb roll over the angry skin just shy of the marks. “This is— who did this to you?”</p><p>Tears sprang to her eyes again. “It’s — it’s nothing. Just a s-scratch, okay?”</p><p>“Bollocks, it is.” His wand appeared from nowhere and he pointed it at the word carved into her arm. She flinched, but allowed him to clean the dried blood from her skin. “What happened?”</p><p>Her throat constricted and it was like broken glass sliding down her esophagus. Hands trembled as she tried to get the words out. “Bellatrix Lestrange, she — snatchers got us and she tortured— oh, God, I can’t—”</p><p>Hermione dissolved into a mess and fell forward into James’ chest. She cried, mumbling her story to him against his cotton shirt. He held her tight against him and awkwardly patted her on the back. He whispered against the top of her head that she’d be okay, that he had her now and he wouldn’t let anyone hurt her again.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>James was certain some shenanigans were afoot. His first clue was that one second, he was prancing as a stag in a Christmas jumper in the middle of the Forbidden Forest, and the next second he was in human form in a dive worse than The Hog’s Head. Hogwarts forgotten.</p><p>Now, as he held onto a clearly traumatized witch, it was clear that something was amiss. Her clothing was odd, even by wizarding standards, and she referred to Bellatrix Lestrange by name. Everyone knew she wasn’t married yet; though James was stunned to discover someone wanted to marry that lunatic at all.</p><p>He wasn’t used to having pretty, damaged witches crying on him. Hell, if it was Lily, he wouldn’t be complaining. So, he kept a tight hold on her and let her cry until her noises turned into little whimpers and finally filled the space around them with strained breathing.</p><p>When she pushed him away, he let her. He even tucked some of her frizzy curls behind her ears so that they’d stop getting stuck in the tears on her face. He smiled at her, but she didn’t smile back.</p><p>“So, I’m guessing you’re not from 1975.” </p><p>Ah, that got her. Her startled brown eyes locked into his.</p><p>“No.” She fingered her lip and tore at some of the chapped skin there. “1998, actually.”</p><p>“Ninety — blimey.” James ran a hand through his hair, a habit he’d cultivated over his previous six years at school. “And, er, do we know one another? James Potter. Head Boy. Best Chaser in a Century?”</p><p>It was the first smile she cracked since they found one another in the pub. She shook her head. “We’ve never been in the same room with one another.”</p><p>“But you <em> have </em>heard of me?” His broad grin came natural and her rolling eyes encouraged it to grow. “Wicked. I always knew I’d be famous among the ladies in the future.”</p><p>She opened her mouth and for a moment, he hung on the excitement that coursed through him. He lived for seeing a girl lift her lips in a smile for him and it was coming in three, two, one —</p><p>A resounding <em> pop </em> filled the room around them. Both James and his lady from the future turned on the spot with their wands drawn.</p><p>A man in a teal waistcoat and matching fedora waved his wand and the room fell silent around them. “Hello,” the man said with a heavy American accent, “I’m very sorry for the disruption, but there’s a lot to do and we haven’t much time.”</p><p>“Who’re you?” James jabbed his wand forward.</p><p>Damsels in distress from the future. Dingy little pubs that reeked of booze. Random strangely dressed wizard with a cryptic message? It had to be Sirius fucking with him. It <em> had </em>to be. James felt the girl at his side bristle, watched her fingers close tighter around her wand.</p><p>“Leonard Twelvetrees.” The man tipped his hat. “We can do introductions later, Mister Potter, Miss Granger. There’s adventure afoot!”</p><p>Granger. He hadn’t thought to get her name. Their eyes met and he raised a brow, a silent question. He didn’t know if they shared a silent language yet, but it was worth the effort anyway. He was rewarded when she tipped her chin; yes, they’d follow this strange fellow who seemed to know who they were.</p><p>“Alright, Mister Twelvetrees, crikey that’s a long name. We'll call you Leonard, if that’s alright?” The man nodded and took a seat at the table. “What exactly do you want with us? Where are we?”</p><p>“Are you related to Dorcas Twelvetrees?” They were the first words Granger spoke that didn’t sound as if they were being torn from her. He felt elated that he’d calmed her down enough. </p><p>Good show, James.</p><p>The man deflated from his sparkling demeanor and leveled her with a serious glare that James didn’t like one bit. “She was my great-great grandmother on my mother’s side, yes.”</p><p>“Who’s Dorcas Twelvetrees?” James flung his gaze between the two, but Granger merely stared down the other wizard with fire in her eyes.</p><p>When Leonard didn’t answer, she aired his laundry for him. “She’s an American that broke the International Statute of Secrecy. She’s the reason we have so many restrictions on magic in front of Muggles.”</p><p>“Muggles?” Leonard asked with a cocked eyebrow.</p><p>“People without magic,” James supplied helpfully, happy to contribute something.</p><p>“Ah, No-Maj. Right, she did do that, yes.” Leonard’s lips pulled down in a frown, but flashed back to a straight line quickly. “This has nothing to do with that. There’s something else—”</p><p>“Are we in America, then?” Granger’s brows drew together and James chuckled. She reminded him of a witch he knew, another fiery know-it-all.</p><p>“You are.” Leonard, though his tone bordered on impatient, allowed her a small smile.</p><p>“When in America are we?” She lifted a brow then, and James could tell she felt very proud of herself for earning a tired sigh from the older man.</p><p>James sat back in his chair and crossed his arms over his chest. He scratched at his chin — he hadn’t thought to ask that question, but if he was from 1975 and she was from 1998, it stood to reason that they were misplaced in time. This was precisely the reason that he kept Remus around. He would have thought to ask these questions. And he would have brought chocolate.</p><p>“1925.” Leonard steepled his fingers and rested his chin on top of them. “Anything else?”</p><p>“How are we here?”</p><p>James studied the stiff set of her shoulders and the swollen puff of lips she held in a straight line. She kept her eyes forward, but he wished she’d look and see the proud smile he flashed at her. She was smart, certainly; he wondered if she were a Ravenclaw.</p><p>“Some advanced charms work and a whole lot of luck,” Leonard said heavily and then flattened his hands on the table. “Listen, kids, it took me years to figure out how to get you here. We don’t have a lot of time. There is darkness headed to this city and I need your help.”</p><p>“Okay!” James clapped his hands together, but his moment of excitement died on his tongue.</p><p>“What darkness? 1925? That’s pre-Grindelwald, isn’t it?” Granger continued to push the bloke; she was a no funny-business type of gal, he decided. “You know, meddling with time is dangerous, Mister Twelvetrees, and you’ve taken me out of a very important time. My friends need me and—”</p><p>“Important!” James turned to her, horrified. “You’ve been carved into like a jack-o-lantern!”</p><p>The stricken expression on her face was his first clue that he’d fucked up. The second was when she stuck her heel so hard onto his foot that he shouted ‘ow’ and scooted his chair away from her.</p><p>“I understand you both have your lives.”  He sounded sympathetic enough to James. “And I will return you to where you came from, the <em> very </em> second, I swear it.”</p><p>“The very second?” Her voice, so strong before, died in her throat. </p><p>James reached out and held her hand as if he’d been her friend for years. “We’ll figure it out, Granger, I promise.”</p><p>Leonard’s gaze danced between them and James shook his head at the older man to dissuade him from prying.</p><p>“What do you need from us, then?” James asked and tried not to wince as Granger squeezed his hand tightly.</p><p>Leonard leaned in, his brown eyes sparkling under the shadow of his fedora. His bushy, dark eyebrows raised into his hairline and a smile wrinkled his face. “What do you know of prohibition?”</p>
