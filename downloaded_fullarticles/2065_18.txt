    <p>There’s something about September the first, Harry thinks.</p><p>There’s a contagious excitement in the air as summer enters its last blush before fall; even the moors feel warm and buzzing. It’s the laden promise of a new beginning in the sight of coal-fed smoke, the scent of spilled ink, the polished wood of a new broomstick. The heath and rolling hills echo with the thunder of wheels upon track; as the train chugs closer, the wind carries the sound of cheerful voices laughing and shouting in a merry cacophony.</p><p>“You’ve got that look on your face again,” Merlin says, coming to stand by his side.</p><p>Harry doesn’t look away from where he’s watching the train pulling into the platform, all red and black and gleaming gilded letters. He’s far past the age of a first year, but the sight of the Hogwarts Express still makes something in his chest swell.</p><p>“What look?” he asks. He rocks back on his heels, hands in the pockets of his robes, not startling in the slightest when the train’s whistle blares cheerfully to announce the arrival of this year’s Hogwarts students.</p><p>“You didn’t immediately accept, when I offered you the position of Defense professor,” Merlin reminds him genially, though Harry can see from the small, smug smile on the man’s face that this is going to be a rehashing of an old argument, “and yet, every September first, you look as delighted as the students do, to see them returning to the castle.”</p><p>“Twice,” Harry corrects him mildly, beginning to smile himself, “It’s been two <em>September firsts</em>, now, including today.”</p><p>“You’ll get the same look next year, too,” Merlin raises his eyebrows, nudging him gently in the side with his elbow, and Harry outright grins at that. He doesn’t deny it.</p><p>It’s mere seconds after the Hogwarts Express has come to a complete stop that the students positively <em>burst</em> through the carriage doors, hastily knotting their ties last-minute and tripping on each other’s robes, spilling onto the platform en masse. Harry and Merlin have stationed themselves at the end, and the students greet them cheerfully as they pass, bright-eyed and laughing.</p><p>“Back for another year, are you, Professor Hart?” one of Harry’s third-year - now fourth-year - students calls as she passes, and Harry quirks an eyebrow.</p><p>“I’m not so hard to get rid of,” he says, nodding in acknowledgment, “I hope you had a nice summer!”</p><p>It’s - well, <em>magical</em>, how many students flow out of the train and towards the castle. They clump together in groups of friends, as many ties matching as not, and Harry can’t keep the smile off his face as he watches. He helps Merlin direct the first-years to the side for their customary trip across the castle lake, greeting the other professors as well as students that pass them by on their way to the thestral carriages.</p><p>Nearly all of them have left when Merlin ducks close to him, murmuring over the din of the remaining excited students, “Look; it’s your favorite Hufflepuff-Gryffindor do-gooders.”</p><p>Merlin says it with wry affection, and Harry glances over his shoulder to the stragglers still exiting the back of the train.</p><p>He spots Miss Morton right away, long blonde hair pulled up in a ponytail as always, robe pressed and immaculate - she’d grown taller over the summer, but is as graceful as ever as she hops the gap to the platform, joining her waiting friend. She rightens the sleeves of her robe and then smooths her hands across the young man’s shoulders, grinning as she tugs his robes into place, and he bats her hands away to fuss with the knot of his gold-and-black tie.</p><p>Harry’s eyebrows twitch together. “Is that-?” he starts, and pauses abruptly when the pair turns towards them and Harry fully sees the young man’s face.</p><p>It’s <em>Eggsy Unwin.</em></p><p>Harry blinks. Eggsy’s grown a lot during the summer holidays - to the point where Harry hadn’t immediately recognized him. His silhouette has changed; he’s taller than he was, broader in the shoulders and chest, the weight of muscle visible as he moves. It’s not a total transformation; Harry can still see the lean young man that had been in his sixth year class, eyes bright and mind sharp, tongue even sharper with wit - and he’s got the same smile, though now it’s framed by a strong jaw. Boys always have their growth spurts a little later - Eggsy’s now half a head above Roxy, whereas she’d been the taller of the two at the end of the term only a few months before. His hair is still blond, burnished gold in the warm September sun, and he grins broadly at Roxy and then up at the looming silhouette of castle. </p><p>Even the cut of Eggsy’s robes highlight how he’s filled out with muscle, the caps of his shoulders and biceps round with them, and Harry swallows.</p><p>“What’s wrong with being a do-gooder?” Harry asks after a long beat, since still Merlin’s waiting for a reply, and headmaster snorts and shakes his head, amused.</p><p>“Gryffindors,” Merlin mutters, without heat, and scribbles something onto his clipboard’s parchment that disappears as soon as it's written. Harry doesn’t take his eyes off the pair of students approaching them.</p><p>Seventh years already - it’s hard to imagine that they’re already there, on the cusp of adulthood. Harry’s only known them since their sixth year, when he began his tenure as Defense Against the Dark Arts professor the year before, but they’d quickly become his favorite students. They were both smart, driven, quick on their feet and fiercely loyal to each other - and together, quite the unintentional troublemakers. “Do-Gooders” certainly also applied - as the trouble they got into was often related to doing right by another student - but there was no denying that mischief seemed to find them far more than it did other Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors. Seeing them reminded Harry of the time he and Merlin had spent together at Hogwarts - and as a Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, respectively, they’d found plenty of trouble in the maze-like halls of the castle.</p><p>“Looking good, Eggsy!” Merlin calls out from beside him, and their heads turn in sync towards Harry and Merlin. Both Roxy and Eggsy smile when they see them, Roxy nodding in acknowledgment as they pass and head for the last of the thestral carriages.</p><p>“Feeling good, Merlin!” Eggsy says with wide smile, letting Roxy tug him along so they can climb in before the carriage leaves without them.</p><p>"Headmaster, Professor Hart," she greets over her shoulder, snorting in amusement at her friend’s antics and herding him towards the carriage, thestral stamping impatiently on the cobblestones. Roxy steps up first and offers her hand to Eggsy, pulling him up into the carriage with no small amount of strength and then closing the door with snap. She smirks at Eggsy as he quickly pulls in the hem of his robe so it won’t get caught in the door, half-in and half-out, and laughs when he pulls a face and says something too faint for them to hear.</p><p>Harry huffs, amused, and turns to Merlin - who's eyeing him curiously, eyebrows raised.</p><p>"Merlin," Harry sighs.</p><p>"I didn't say anything," the headmaster replies, feigning innocence, "unless you were taking my name in vain, just then - in which case I shouldn't need to tell you to knock it off. I'll be hearing enough of that from the students in the coming weeks."</p><p>“I’m looking forward to it,” Harry smirks, and Merlin only rolls his eyes and turns back to his clipboard, checking off names as the last of the first years scramble off the train and into the waiting flock of small, robed students, all chattering excitedly and glancing, wide-eyed, at the towers and keeps and parapets of Hogwarts castle.</p><p>The thestral snorts into its bit and the carriage jolts and jangles as it pulls away the carriage pulls away, towards the great entrance gate and the castle beyond. Eggsy leans an arm out the window, glancing back at Harry, who is the last to stand on the empty platform next to the quiet, steaming train.</p><p>Eggsy grins and winks at him - and, well, that part hasn’t changed, at least. Harry smiles back.</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p>There’s nothing like stepping into Hogwarts’ Great Hall for the first time of the year - the warm candlelight flickering against the worn stones, the scrape of chairs as students fill their house tables and greet each other with smiles and hugs after a summer spent apart, the aroma of pies and spice in the air and the canopy of glittering stars overhead. It brings a fond smile to Eggsy’s face like nothing else.</p><p>Already his mates have spotted him and are motioning for him to join them at the Hufflepuff table; as seventh years they’ve claimed the middle of the table, students of every year starting to fill the seats - and similarly, the Gryffindor girls are waving at Roxy.</p><p>“Oi,” Eggsy says, elbowing her gently in the side before they part ways towards their own houses, “Meet up tonight, yeah? After all this?”</p><p>“Eggsy,” Roxy doesn’t roll her eyes, but her fond exasperation bleeds into her tone, “you do remember the meaning of the word <em>prefect</em>, and that I still am one - I can’t be gallivanting all over the castle at all hours. I should be setting a good example for the younger students, especially the first years.”</p><p>“As prefect, you’re<em> allowed</em> to be all over the castle at all hours,” Eggsy grins, and raises his eyebrows, “and that didn’t stop us last year.”</p><p>It’s a familiar argument; Roxy does roll her eyes, then. She sighs, pursing her lips, glancing up at the professor’s table and then at the groundskeeper and the other Gryffindor prefect, assessing.</p><p>“I’ve got to help the first years get settled into their rooms in the tower,” she finally says, taking a half-step closer to Eggsy, speaking quietly, “but after that?”</p><p>“<em>Aces</em>,” Eggsy smirks, raising his hand for a fist-bump, which makes her laugh. “Usual spot?”</p><p>Roxy gives him a sharp nod and then takes his shoulders, turning him bodily to face the Hufflepuff table. “Don’t eat all the pasties,” she murmurs in his ear before giving him a gentle shove, sending him - laughing - in its direction just as Merlin stands to quiet them, in preparation of bringing out the Sorting Hat and ushering in the first years for the great banquet to begin.</p><p>“Good evening - yes, settle down, you’ll be able to chat more as soon as the opening festivities have been completed,” Headmaster Merlin says, motioning for the students to take their seats at the long tables and waiting as the din of voices quiets to a murmur before continuing. His spectacles reflect the yellow-white glow of the nearby floating candles, and Merlin glances around the room at the body of students as a hush falls, a knowing smile on his lips. Eggsy finds himself smiling back - and a quick glance around the Great Hall reveals that most of his peers are doing the same.</p><p>“Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to Hogwarts castle - for yet another year of your magical education,” he says, clasping his hands on the gilded podium, “I’ll be making something of a grander speech once our first years have joined us - but I believe their journey across the lake is complete, and Professor Hart will be bringing them in to be sorted momentarily.”</p><p>A murmur ripples through the crowd; Professor Ashwick strides to the center of the Great Hall with the Sorting Hat perched on its stool, setting it down where it can be seen by all four houses and the teacher's table. It looks the same as it always has - scuffed, supple leather stitched and creased, unassuming as it sits, silent - though not for long, Eggsy knows. He can almost see the curve of a brow and wide brim of a mouth in the Hat’s folds, now that he knows to look for them. The tide of voices rises again as students lean in to whisper to one another, eyes on the Sorting Hat with reverence and excitement. The ritual of Sorting is as much anticipated by the older students as it is the ones about to be Sorted themselves.</p><p>Merlin nods to Ashwick as he returns to his seat amongst the professors, and no sooner has the Charms professor settled his robes around him than a knock on the door sounds through the hall, echoing in the vast room.</p><p>Eggsy turns - they all do - and twists in his seat to watch as the heavy door swings inward and Professor Hart peeks through it, waiting for Merlin to gesture for him to enter before leading in a double line of small, nervous first-years. They look around the Great Hall with eyes as wide as saucers, following Professor Hart in an awe-struck daze.</p><p>Eggsy cracks a grin; he fondly remembers his first trip to Hogwarts, the delight in the Hogwarts Express and then, later, the mysterious ride in lantern-lit boats across the inky dark of the lake. His own Sorting is fresh in his mind as he watches their newest students peek around each other to get a look at the Hat on the stool, shuffling closer when Professor Hart brings them to a stop not twenty feet from it.</p><p>“Think a future Hufflepuff Keeper's among that lot?” Ryan nudges Eggsy in the shoulder, jerking his chin at the throng of first years. “Spot any that are potentially ours?”</p><p>Eggsy snorts and shakes his head minutely, watching as Professor Hart dips a hand into the sleeve of his robe and pulls out the scroll with the list of the student’s names. “Ain’t our problem to worry about yet, yeah? They’re first years, besides.”<br/>
<br/>
“Baby Hufflepuffs,” Jamal sighs from across the table, and Eggsy shoots him a smile over his shoulder before turning back to the proceedings. A proper hush has fallen over the Great Hall, now, and Professor Hart takes a step to the side so that the focus is on the Sorting Hat. The first years appear to be collectively holding their breaths, unsure of what is about to happen.<br/>
<br/>
Then the Sorting Hat bursts into song.<br/>
<br/>
Eggsy's eyes flick to Professor Hart, to where he's standing off to the right so that the Sorting Hat can have center stage for its annual performance - and he grins to see that the professor's face is caught somewhere between smiling and wincing. The Hat's in full form, and even Eggsy can admit that though it's a sight he's grown used to, the Sorting Hat's penchant for rhyming has only gotten odder with time. At least this year the Hat doesn’t mention the <em>shining dome</em> of the Headmaster's bald head as it had in years previous. Merlin looks equally relieved when the Sorting Hat finishes its song with a strange, armless bow, and the Great Hall erupts into cheers and applause.</p><p>After that, the Sorting proceeds as usual - the houses hooting and clapping when the Sorting Hat shouts out <em>Ravenclaw</em> or <em>Hufflepuff</em> or <em>Gryffindor</em> or <em>Slytherin</em>, welcoming the newest members of their houses with warm enthusiasm. Eggsy nudges Ryan over so a first-year girl can sit on his other side; her honey-gold curls remind him of Daisy. All in all there are twenty-five new Hufflepuffs added to their ranks, bright-eyed and eager to learn <em>anything</em> and <em>everything</em> about their new house.</p><p>Merlin stands to make his customary and promised speech when the Sorting is finished; Eggsy, admittedly, tunes him out a little when he finds his eyes strangely drawn back to the form of Professor Hart. He’s sitting with the rest of the professors, now, between Professor Ashwick and Professor Lance, and at first glance he’s paying attention to Merlin’s speech, too. But as he watches, Professor Hart’s eyes wander around the Great Hall - and finally lock on his.<br/>
<br/>
Eggsy swallows. There’s no heat of anger in the professor’s gaze, though he obviously is aware that Eggsy isn’t paying attention either; after a moment, a small smile quirks the corner of his lips, brown eyes twinkling in the candle-light, amused.</p><p>He’d be downright lying if he ever said that Professor Hart <em>isn’t</em> his favorite amongst the Hogwarts teaching staff; Eggsy has somewhat of a rapport with Merlin - he tries to stay on the Headmaster’s good side, though the number of times he’s brushed against <em>trouble</em> has only increased over the years - but there’s something about Professor Hart. Maybe it’s that he was an auror, and that’s what Eggsy’s planning on doing after Hogwarts - or maybe it’s the crisp accent that so contrasts Eggsy’s south London drawl. Or maybe it’s the fact that under his robes, Harry Hart wears bespoke suits, wonderfully tailored to his narrow waist and long legs.</p><p>Eggsy ducks his head, feeling warmth starting to floor his cheeks, but when he sneaks a look again Professor Hart is still looking at him. The Professor leans forward in his chair, knitting his hands together on top of the table, expression subtly shifting to something sly as he holds Eggsy’s gaze out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>And then he <em>winks.</em></p><p>It’s quick enough to be mistaken for a twitch, if anyone else happens to be watching, but Eggsy knows it’s meant for him. Because Professor Hart is returning the gesture - returning the wink that Eggsy had given him earlier that day, in a rush of impulsive happiness at being back at Hogwarts, at seeing his favorite professor again. Eggsy bites his lip and tries to fight the grin that works its way onto his face with no avail - thankfully, almost everyone else <em>is</em> paying attention to Merlin, and no one notices Eggsy and Professor Hart stealing glances at each other from across the Great Hall.</p><p>He looks away from Professor Hart just in time to catch Roxy sparing him a curious look, one eyebrow raised.<br/>
<br/>
"Now that all of that is out of the way," Merlin says, just as Eggsy snaps out of his thoughts and looks in his direction again, "Thank you for your patience - and enjoy the Start-of-Term Feast!"</p><p>There's a gasp of delight as Merlin finishes speaking and raises his hands, and the banquet tables in front of them fill with food. The lingering smells of pumpkin and spice, roast chicken and pies that had been floating up from the kitchens are now wafting in full-force, filling the Great Hall with warm, mouth-watering aromas. Eggsy chuckles to see the first years at their table, gaping in surprise and no small amount of excitement at the sudden appearance of the feast itself, and the use of magic that put it there. It's not hard to spot the students who don't come from wizarding families - their mouths are further ajar than the rest.<br/>
<br/>
With that, the students settle into the thrumming happiness of the Feast, of being back at Hogwarts for another year. The seventh-years chat about what they did over the summer, the courses they plan on taking to prepare for their NEWTS and then, after graduation, their careers. Eggsy'd sent sporadic letters to Jamal and Ryan, but letter-writing had never been his strong suit - nor had long flying journeys ever been JB's, if he's being honest - so there is still plenty to catch up on between them.</p><p>"Really," Ryan says, tearing into his roasted potatoes, "since Victoria graduated last year, you're going to need to find a new Keeper. She was a good player, gonna be hard to replace with someone new."<br/>
<br/>
"We'll make it work," Eggsy shrugs, unconcerned, as he shovels more of his steak and kidney pie into his mouth and slips some chips into his pocket to give to JB later. "First years'll be flying by October, and we'll have try-outs for Keeper soon enough with the third-years and up - well in time for the opening game in November."</p><p>"Long as you've got a plan, Captain," Ryan smirks at him, clapping a hand on his shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
"There are more important things to worry about that Quidditch, mate," Jamal shakes his head in amusement as Ryan feigns an aghast expression of horror at the thought of something <em>more important than Quidditch</em>. Eggsy can’t help but smile at their antics, at the easy companionship they’ve built over the years and returns so easily, despite their time spent apart. "At least at the start of term, there is."</p><p>"I'll say," Eggsy rolls his eyes, and fights not to look up at the Professor's table.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As always, it’s a bit of a joyful chaos, bringing the first-years to the Hufflepuff dormitories for the first time. Rajesh and Chloe show them where to find the secret entrance, and how to give the correct number of taps to the correct barrel, and let one of them try it out before they enter the cozy, welcoming common room. The older students hang back, listening to the explanation as they have time and time again, relishing the surprise on the first years’ faces as Rajesh tells them about how the barrels drenching impostors or intruders with vinegar - and then the unrestrained delight and wonder as they take in their common room - their house - for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
The common room is so perfectly Hufflepuff; there’s nowhere else in the castle that Eggsy feels the same at-home, cozy comfort. It’s all plush, patterned chairs and sofas in bright yellow and black, squashy footstools and tasseled pillows in front of the low fireplace. There’s no sun streaming through the round windows, but it still feels warm, earthy, like a burrow in hillside. Plants hang near the windows and clustered in little pots on the sill - some silent and some snoring - and the first years take it all in with rapt awe. Ryan snorts to Eggsy’s left, as one of them almost trips over the corner of a chair, too busy admiring the low ceilings and burnished copper of the lamps to properly watch where he’s going.</p><p>Eggsy lets the surging bustle of his house-mates swallow him, hanging back towards the door as the first years trundle off to their rooms through the twin round doorways on either side of the fireplace, led by their prefects respectively; the older students quickly fill the common room, settling into the enjoyably lumpy furniture to keep talking before heading to bed, and that’s when Eggsy makes his exit. He’s got his own plans.</p><p>It’s not hard to duck out of the common room, down another tunnel-like hallway to get closer to the kitchens. He and Roxy have been meeting in the kitchens for years, ever since they realized that the house elves were too fond of Eggsy to ever report him - and that once dinner has been served, it’s usually empty enough for them to be left to themselves.<br/>
<br/>
It’s got the added benefit of leftover pudding from the Great Feast, too, and Eggsy knows that Roxy has something of a sweet tooth - even if she won’t admit it.</p><p>The Gryffindor prefect knocks gently on the kitchen door in warning before she enters - just in case, as they’d long ago established - arriving only minutes after Eggsy himself had gotten settled with a plate of leftover pasties and two goblets of pumpkin juice. The house elves, it seemed, were as happy as the students to be seeing the school once again filled and full of life. Eggsy smiles around his mouthful, gesturing for her to sit on the short stool across from him and nudging the overflowing plate in her direction.<br/>
<br/>
“Sorry about that,” she says, rolling up her sleeves before selecting a pasty and taking a bite. “Some of the Gryffindor girls wanted to swap beds and, well - they’ve barely just gotten their wands, let alone learned how to do anything with them, so it was up to me and Rose to <em>Wingardium Leviosa</em> their trunks for them.”</p><p>“S’ all right,” Eggsy mumbles, taking a gulp of pumpkin juice and swallowing. “Haven’t been here long at all.”</p><p>“Good,” Roxy smiles, adjusting the fall of her robe over the back of her stool, brushing crumbs off to the side of the table so she won’t put her elbows in them. “Hufflepuff is fine?”</p><p>“Hufflepuff is always fine - we’re not like Slytherin or Gryffindor; we ain’t got house rivalries or house drama to worry about, especially not this early in the year.”</p><p>“God, don’t remind me,” Roxy rolls her eyes, exasperated, and Eggsy shoots her a frown.</p><p>“Nothing happened, did it?”</p><p>“On the first night of term? No, thank Merlin,” Roxy says, and then gently winces - now that they’re back at school it’s time to avoid using the phrase, lest the Headmaster catch them and tell them not to take his name in vain. “Just Charlie being Charlie.”</p><p>“You mean, Charlie being a Slytherin arsehole,” Eggsy translates, and Roxy gives him a look that says she wouldn’t have put it like that, but it’s not far off the mark.</p><p>“Don’t start anything with him on my accord, Unwin,” she says, using what Eggsy calls her Stern Prefect voice. It’s surprisingly effective - though rarely against him. “I can handle my own.”</p><p>“I know you can,” Eggsy replies, taking another great bite of his biscuit, “Don’t mean you should have to put up with him, though.”</p><p>Roxy sighs. “Hufflepuffs,” she says, affecting exasperation, though she reaches over to ruffle his hair before taking another biscuit for herself.</p><p>“What?” Eggsy cocks an eyebrow, “Got enough of me on the train, did you?”</p><p>Roxy wrinkles her nose and nibbles at a biscuit, shaking her head, her long ponytail brushing against her shoulder. “One trip on the Hogwarts Express does not equal the summer full of letters you promised to write and then <em>didn’t</em>. Poor form, if you ask me - especially for a Hufflepuff, the House known for loyalty in friendship.”</p><p>“Oi, I sent you <em>some</em> letters,” Eggsy protests, “Not my fault JB don’t do well with long journeys. He’s just a wee thing.”</p><p>“Your tiny owl is not responsible for <em>you</em> not writing letters in the first place,” Roxy laughs, resting her chin on one of her hands and knocking her knees against Eggsy’s underneath the short table. “He certainly can’t write them for you.”</p><p>“Now <em>that</em> would be a magical pet,” Eggsy quirks a grin at her, and Roxy chuckles again.</p><p>“Really, everything’s okay?”</p><p>“With me? Yeah, just busy this summer, is all,” Eggsy shifts in his seat, rubbing the back of his neck before settling his elbows on the table, willing his hands to stay still. He knows it’s one of his tells - and there’s no reason to burden Roxy with his troubles the first day back at Hogwarts. “Daisy’s getting big, she’s getting harder and harder to keep up with.”</p><p>Roxy studies him for a moment, lips pursed; there’s a keenness in her eyes that Eggsy knows means that she’s cottoned on to him, but she’s not going to push - yet. But the moment passes, and she dimples a smile at him at the mention of his younger sister. “She’ll be coming to - Daisy will make a great Gryffindor."</p><p>"Hufflepuff," Eggsy snaps back, without heat. But then he smiles broadly, leaning back in his chair and crossing his arms. It's another one of their old, hashed and rehashed arguments, and falling back into their patterns of conversation makes something warm settle in Eggsy's chest. "C'mon then, Rox. Remind me again what our schedule is tomorrow, and why I should wait until the Quidditch season to punch Charlie's dickhead face in."</p><p>"Eggsy," Roxy groans, though there's amusement in the slant of her eyebrows and the pull of a laugh in her lips. "Where do I even start? Which should I address first - your use of your position as a beater to commit violence against another student, your need for reminders about our NEWT level classes - or dare I ask if you speak like that in front of the first years?"</p><p>"You're such a prefect," Eggsy shakes his head, and Roxy kicks him gently, laughing. He jerks away from her - more pretending to be offended and hurt than he actually is, which makes Roxy snort, though she can’t stop smiling. There’s a simple joy in just being in each other’s presence again, in picking up their easy friendship where it had left off.</p><p>Eggsy leans forward in his stool, resting his crossed arms on the table, and Roxy does the same. They look properly conspiratorial now, Eggsy knows, though the effect is somewhat lessened by the cheerful plate of sweets between them.</p><p>"Start by telling me when we have Defense Against the Dark Arts,” Eggsy says, “and we'll go from there."</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p>The first few days of classes are a bit of a blur - but an enjoyable one, at the least.</p><p>Harry does genuinely enjoy teaching, and it's nice to see his colleagues again after the summer holiday - not two days in and Professor Ashwick already seems to be nearing the end of his cool, collected patience for tolerating the suave, easy charisma and confidence of Professor Lance, and there is one morning where Harry thinks he'll be late for his sixth years' class because Professor Hadley won't stop chatting about the Fanged Geraniums she'd started to culture for her fifth years. But still, it feels good to be back in the castle again, good to see the halls lit with torchlight, cheerful voices echoing in the corridors, students spreading out in the courtyard to enjoy the last of September's warmth before the chill of Scotland's fall sets in.</p><p>But the hectic nature of reviewing his course plans and learning the names of his first years and giving introductory lectures about the nature of Defense Against the Dark Arts and the books needed for the course reading - well, it means that half the week has passed before Harry even sees his favorite class.</p><p>Harry can admit to himself that the seventh-year Defense Against the Dark Arts class is his favorite to teach. By seventh year, the only students taking his course are the ones that have passed their OWLs for it and have a marked interest in the subject - many of whom Harry knows are hopeful prospective curse-breakers, healers, magizoologists, medi-witches and wizards, and members of magical law enforcement - including aurors. His students are bright, driven, ask questions and seek out answers for themselves - they're a good bunch, Harry knows, and bound to excel at anything they put their minds to.</p><p>The course itself, by Harry's design, is also more hands-on than any of the first through sixth year Defense classes - which by Harry's standards, makes it all the more fun.</p><p>When Wednesday's lunch comes around Harry's looking forward to the rest of the afternoon, the first session of the seventh years' class spanning the double block from lunch until dinner. He gives a perfunctory glance over his notes as he eats, ignoring Lance and Ashwick snipping at each other to his left. Merlin's nowhere in sight to stop their bickering; Harry rather thinks Merlin's interventions could be skewing their bet of when Percival Ashwick and James Lance are going to go from in each other's faces to in each other's pants, but Merlin consistently plays the <em>I'm the Headmaster</em> card whenever Harry brings it up. (Harry continues to woo Merlin's cat, Circe, into liking him more than Merlin in retribution.)</p><p>He's finished his lunch and is wiping away the chalk notes from his previous class with absent-minded flicks of his wand when the first of his seventh years start to trickle in, coming in from the Great Hall in groups of two and three. The class is a mix of all four houses, since there isn’t a big enough need for more than one session; though his back is to the rest of the classroom as he brushes chalk-dust off his robes, Harry can hear the gaggle of Slytherin boys - Charlie, Hugo, Rufus, with Jen sitting behind them - and the cluster of Ravenclaws - Amelia, Eric, Michael. Even with the full class, there aren’t enough students to fill every seat in his classroom, but Harry knows there are still a few missing when he finishes with the blackboards and takes a seat on the desk in the front of the room, rather than behind it, and waits for the rest of them before he begins.</p><p>He smiles at seeing their attentive faces, crossing his legs at the ankle as he leans against the desk and waiting patiently. He hadn’t heard her enter, but the dark-haired Slytherin Sophie is in the back of the room near Jen, eyes as sharp as ever - and across the aisle from her the Gryffindors sit together in solidarity.</p><p>Well, most of them.</p><p>It’s moments before the after-lunch bell rings that Eggsy Unwin and Roxy Morton bluster into the classroom, robes swinging as they come to an abrupt stop at finding the rest of the class there and Harry watching the door, patient and amused. Their eyes are twinkling with mischief already - and Merlin, it’s only the third day of classes, Harry thinks to himself. He’s not sure he wants to know what the pair of them have already gotten up to.</p><p>He nods for them to take their seats, and they shuffle into two chairs near the front of the room, too excited to even look sheepish at their close call with tardiness, and Harry stands when they’ve righted themselves and turned their attention towards him.</p><p>He puts his hands in his pockets, drawing up to his full height - it’s the first day of class for them, after all; he can’t help a little pomp.</p><p>“Welcome to seventh year Defense Against the Dark Arts,” he says, scanning the room to meet them each by eye, ensuring their full attention. “I hope you’re prepared for dark arts, and defending yourself against them.”</p><p>"I hope you've all had a nice holiday, because we're going to be diving into coursework right away," Harry continues, "As you're well aware, this is the only session of Defense Against the Dark arts for seventh years - all of your are planning on careers that require knowledge of a wide range of subjects, this one being perhaps the most challenging because it incorporates so many other disciplines of magic."</p><p>A few of them nod along to his words, attention unwavering. "Herbology, Transfiguration, Potions - I know many of you have a full schedule of courses, and while the NEWTs seem far in the distance, I can assure you that they'll loom ever-closer, faster than you expect. It's my job to prepare you for the exam, and with your continued cooperation, I'm confident you'll all be doing very well indeed."</p><p>Harry shifts, adjusting his glasses on the bridge of his nose before moving to the blackboard, giving a gentle tap to one of the fresh pieces of chalk with his wand. It gives a little shiver and then floats upward, around eye-level and poised to write, as he begins to speak again. "I've made up a list of subjects we're to cover, of course, but I thought it would be worth asking what you'd like to learn - if you have any suggestions."</p><p>There's a beat of silence where the Ravenclaws exchange glances with one another, and Harry catches Eggsy out of the corner of his eye, eyebrows raised. But Harry’s always conducted his sixth and seventh year classes with informality - not without respect - so it only takes a moment for one of them to pipe up.</p><p>"As in," Amelia says tentatively, "What subjects we'd like to review before the NEWTs? Things we would like more practice on?"</p><p>"If you'd like," Harry shrugs gently, "We at least began to cover many of the Defense Against the Dark Arts subjects relevant to the NEWT exam last year; we now have the ability to go more in-depth in certain subjects, as well as engage in more advanced practical work - I can assure you that we'll be doing more interactive spell-work and hands-on experience rather than writing essays and taking tests - though I can't let you off too easy." Harry's mouth twitches into a small smile. "There is a written portion of the Defense NEWT, after all. Suggestions, though?"</p><p>From near the back, Jen Pinkstone raises her hand tentatively, biting her lip. Harry motions for her to speak, turning to look over his shoulder as he points his wand at the chalk, ready to write.</p><p>"Curse-breaking," Jen says, "Not just resisting them, but - breaking them, on cursed objects as well as people."</p><p>"Very good," Harry says, and flicks his wand - the chalk starts to jot in neat cursive, starting a list in flowing, looped handwriting: <em>Curse-breaking.</em></p><p>"Nonverbal spellwork," Michael adds, gesturing to Harry - as he'd just done exactly that. The chalk squeaks as it writes, adding that to the board as well.</p><p>"Wandless magic, then, too," Roxy says, and Harry nods - another smart suggestion.</p><p>It only takes a few minutes for them to build a rather thorough list - it contains maybe two-thirds of the subjects Harry had been planning on covering anyways, plus a few items that would be revision topics from years previous. Below <em>Wandless Magic</em> is <em>Building and Breaking Wards</em>, followed by <em>Stealth and Tracking</em>, <em>Advanced Defense Charms</em> - which had prompted Harry to say <em>Martial Magic</em> as well - <em>Disguises, Recognizing Dark Objects,</em> and <em>Even More Dangerous Creatures</em>.</p><p>Harry stands back to look at the list, murmuring, “<em>Finite incantatem</em>,” and catching the chalk in his palm as it falls out of the air.</p><p>“I’ll have to make plans with some of the other professors to cover some of these,” Harry admits, turning to face the class again and pocketing the chalk. “Not to mention you’ll be visiting the Restricted Section probably more than you ever have before to do some of the class readings and research before we tackle some of these more serious topics.”</p><p>He resolutely tries not to notice how Roxy and Eggsy glance at each other at the mention of <em>being in the Restricted section more than ever before</em> - but he can see their matching smirks, and finds himself once again in the position of wondering what in Merlin’s name they’d gotten up to in previous years that he didn’t already know about. At least in his class, they’d be going there with true academic purpose, and not whatever trouble they seemed to find themselves in time and again.</p><p>“For today, though,” Harry rolls up the sleeves of his robe and starts to undo the French cuffs of his shirt beneath it, smirking at the curious expression of his students, “let’s spend the afternoon with some friendly warm-up dueling practice, to get right back into the thick of things after the holiday. Although -” he adds, as he finishes pushing his sleeves up his forearms, “let’s endeavor to keep the title of First Hospital Wing Visit of the Year away from my classroom, yes?”</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Something in Eggsy’s stomach curls, warm and waiting, as he watches Professor Hart push back the dark sleeves of his robes to reveal the snow-white shirt beneath, and then start undoing the cuff-links at his wrist. There’s no time to think on it, though - not beyond abstractly admiring the lean muscles of his exposed forearm, and noting the unusual wizard watch on his left wrist - before he’s saying they’ll be <em>dueling</em> that afternoon, and there’s a joyful chaos as everyone jumps up and starts moving the desks to the edges of the classroom so they have plenty of space in the middle. </p><p>The rest of the afternoon passes in an active - but not unpleasant - blur; Professor Hart has them pair off - Eggsy takes a comically wide step to his left to take his place at Roxy’s side, and he swears Professor Hart nearly shakes his head, unsurprised, when he sees him do so - and then it’s casual, warm-up dueling for the rest of the double block.</p><p>That isn’t to say that it’s entirely easy, though.</p><p>Roxy’s got that mischievous smile on her lips when they turn to each other and take out their wands. They don’t bow to each other - it’s a practice and they’re best friends besides, there’s no need for the formality - but Roxy dips her head to him in a slight not and he returns the gesture, winking.</p><p>“Think you can take me, love?” he asks, twirling his wand in his fingers as they back up a few paces, putting space between them before they begin.</p><p>“We’ll see if you can even keep up,” Roxy replies, chin tilted up in a challenge, and she flicks her ponytail over her shoulder before settling into a dueling position, leading with her right shoulder and foot, turning counterpoint to Eggsy as she raises her wand. Eggsy mirrors her position, raising his eyebrows as a beat passes, both of them waiting and watching for the other to make the first move.</p><p>Roxy doesn’t give him more than a second to think before she’s throwing a Stinging Hex his way, and it’s only because Eggsy’s light on his feet that it misses his left arm by a few inches.</p><p>She quirks an eyebrow at him and then, catching movement out of the corner of her eye, dodges a stray spell from one of the other dueling pairs near them - leaving herself open for the slightest moment, and Eggsy jumps at the opportunity, flinging out a quick, "<em>Expelliarmus</em>!"</p><p>Roxy's able to put up a shield before the red bolt from Eggsy's wand disarms her; her shield sends it, crackling, into one of the nearby stone walls, narrowly missing a window.</p><p>"Careful," Eggsy laughs, and she snorts, lunging at him with another spell on her lips.</p><p>They dance around each other like that, not venturing beyond anything nastier than a Bat-Bogey hex, enjoying the chance to practice magic once again after the summer holiday and testing their reflexes, their reaction times and spells they know from memory. They circle each other, robes whirling, not staying on a traditional linear dueling path - and avoiding the spells ricocheting around the classroom from the other students as well.</p><p>Professor Hart makes a circuit of the room, stopping to watch each pair of students; Eggsy can't help but show off when he nears them, and knows Roxy is silently judging him for it - but he wants to be an auror, wants to impress his favorite professor, start the year off on a good note. He tucks into a roll when a burst of crackling light flies from the tip of Roxy's wand as she shouts, "<em>Everte Satum</em>!" and is back on his feet in a flash, sending a Leek Jinx over his shoulder at her.</p><p>"Creative," Professor Hart comments, smiling at Eggsy and side-stepping a <em>Locomotor Mortis</em> spell so it diffuses against the classroom wall, moving away without even looking in the direction of the wayward spell - an auror's heightened sense of magical perception, Eggsy admires, before his eyes flick down from the gleam of amusement in the Professor's eyes to his bare forearms, the strong band of leather of his wristwatch, the firm grip he has on his wand even though it isn't raised-</p><p>A stinging hex cuts him across the cheek out of nowhere, snapping him out of his thoughts with a bright blossom of pain against his skin, and he gasps in surprise.</p><p>Professor Hart's eyes snap to his as Eggsy slaps a hand to his face, feeling the tender sting of pink, raised skin and thin line of blood warm underneath his fingers in an inch-long cut that hurts, fuck, but isn't deep at all. His fingers barely come away red when he glances at them, rubbing at the mark on his cheek with the back of his hand.</p><p>Roxy's looking at him, an eyebrow raised - equally surprised that he'd gotten distracted enough for her to land such a simple spell - and she slides her wand into her pocket with pursed lips, approaching him in a few quick strides.</p><p>"All right?" she asks, putting a hand on his elbow and waiting for him to move his hand so she can get a proper look at the cut.</p><p>"Just a stinging hex," Eggsy shrugs, eyebrows pulled together in a frown, lips twisted as he grimaces, "but bloody fuck, Rox, it does sting - good one."</p><p>"Language," Professor Hart says mildly, though there's something like a wry smile on his face, and he gestures at Roxy - she releases Eggsy's arm and shuffles back so he can step forward, leaning in to peer at Eggsy's face. Eggsy tries not to blush under the scrutiny of his keen eyes, focuses instead on the cheerful red-and-gold stripes of Professor Hart’s Gryffindor tie rather than meet his eyes from so close.</p><p>"May I?" he asks, finally holding up his wand - and Eggsy does look at him them, nodding tentatively.</p><p>"'s fine, really," Eggsy says, brushing off the wince of pain he makes when he tries to give them a confident smile and the cut pulls.</p><p>"Even so," Professor Hart reaches slowly, making his intent clear as he takes Eggsy's chin between his forefinger and thumb, tilting his face gently to the side so he can see the mark better in the afternoon sunlight. "I'd really rather you didn't go to the hospital wing - you needn't go for something so small, anyways, but we can't have the Headmaster breathing down my neck about the endangerment of my seventh year students during the first week of classes." He smiles genially at Eggsy, hair lit from behind in a silver-gold halo, light catching on the lenses of his glasses as he peers closer.</p><p>Eggsy tries not to breathe.</p><p>For a former auror and Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, Professor Hart is steady and gentle, hands practiced and warm. He brings his wand up and lets it hover millimeters from the broken skin, murmuring "<em>Episkey</em>." There's a ripple of magic as the spell does its work, knitting together the edges of the cut and feathering out into the pink abraided line from the stinging hex, until the skin is clean and whole. Eggsy reaches up to run his fingers across his cheek when Professor Hart pulls away - and the tips of his fingers can't find where the mark was, or any bump or raised mark that would betray where it had been only moments before.</p><p>"Thanks," Eggsy grins at Professor Hart - and finds that though his face has been healed, the tender sting still lingers under the skin.</p><p>"You're welcome, Mr Unwin," Professor Hart replies, and nods to them before moving on to the next pair of students. Eggsy watches him go, hand lingering on his cheek - he feels the heat rising in his face, and resolutely ignores the curious glances Roxy sends his way.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What was that, anyways?" she asks as they walk down the narrow hallway away from the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, making for the Great Hall - an afternoon of practice dueling has made them both quite ravenous and looking forward to dinner.</p><p>"What was what?" Eggsy asks, fidgeting with the strap of his bookbag across his shoulder, not meeting her eyes.</p><p>Roxy pinches his cheek, and snorts when Eggsy bats her hand away, saying, "Oi, Rox! It still stings a bit!"</p><p>But she doesn’t press, doesn’t pry; Eggsy knows that it won’t be forgotten or brushed off, but for a Gryffindor, Roxy’s adopted a rather Slytherin strategy of waiting people out, let whatever it is she’s trying to figure out bubble to the surface without too much prodding. She’s willing to wait - as longs as she thinks it’s the right course of action, of course.</p><p>They move on to other subjects at dinner - Defense Against the Dark Arts isn’t their only NEWT-level class, after all, and Eggsy’s glad for it. But he can’t help replay the moment in his mind, when Professor Hart’s eyes - brown, they’re a rich amber-brown - caught the sunlight as he leaned in and his finger brushed against Eggsy’s chin. He fights down a blush at just the though.</p><p>He’s really not sure what’s going on, either.</p><p> </p>
