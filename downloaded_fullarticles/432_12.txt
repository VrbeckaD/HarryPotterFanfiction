    <p>NINETEEN FORTY FOUR was an oddity,</p><p>especially for a sixteen-year-old Harry Potter who was completely out of his element as he stood on the platform, in a sea of unfamiliar faces. He glanced around the crowd, nervous first years were pacing back and forth while older students reunited with old friends. Then there was Harry, who stood completely alone near the end of the train attempting not to bring attention to himself.</p><p>As he boarded the train he managed to face first into another person a tall, broad-shouldered body that quickly steadied him before he could fall backward.</p><p>Alphard Black.</p><p>Harry paused before passing the young man and continuing down the crowded train till he found the only empty compartment. He sat near the window watching the scenery pass by as his heart sunk. For a few moments, he wallowed in his own loneliness and felt pity before the compartment door slid open.</p><p>A young man tall and broad-shouldered stepped in, still, mid-conversation with a woman Harry was unable to see. He seemed to be caught off guard by Harry's presence as he glanced around the nearly empty compartment.</p><p>"Who are you?" Tom asked rather coldly as he stepped into the compartment, Harry looked around the compartment nervously.</p><p>"Harry Potter." He answered meekly, standing up from his seat and making as if he was going to leave. Tom stopped him rather swiftly, towering over the young man who anxiously took a step back.</p><p>"He's new Tom." The young woman behind him explained, placing a hand on the broad shoulder of Tom Riddle who backed down within seconds.</p><p>"Where are you from?" He asked angrily, not taking an eye off of Harry as he stepped further into the compartment.</p><p>"Castelobruxo." Harry lied as the young man and woman stepped into the compartment.</p><p>"Tom be nice, he didn't know." The girl said pulling Tom into his seat opposite Harry, who was secretly thankful for the dark-haired girl sitting across from him.</p><p>The young woman snaked her arms around his shoulders and kissed him on the cheek, immediately he seemed to relax. They were quite the pair, both stunning sixth years with dark hair and a sense of entitlement. They reminded Harry of Draco and Astoria, with a difference in hair color.</p><p>"My name is Druella." The girl said removing a hand from her boyfriend's shoulder and extending it to Harry, who shook it gratefully.</p><p>"Tom can be a bit of a prat sometimes so I apologize on his behalf." She giggled, glancing at Tom who only glared at her in response.</p><p>"What house are you? If you know of course." Druella asked kindly kissing her boyfriend for the second time.</p><p>"I believe Slytherin, or maybe Ravenclaw. I don't quite remember." Harry said honestly, feeling slow for having forgotten some of the information the order had given him.</p><p>"Oh, I hope it's Slytherin, although Ravenclaw is also adequate." She said watching Harry who smiled nervously. Tom glanced at Harry for a split second, and the younger could feel a slight shiver descend him in that moment.</p><p>Efe iska?</p><p>Both Harry and Druella stared at Tom, who was glancing out of the large window.</p><p>Sā.</p><p>Harry found himself responding, a look of understanding washing over Druella.</p><p>Hásim?</p><p>Druella asked to the surprise of Harry, who was still slightly taken aback at the sudden change in dialect.</p><p>Tænas.</p><p>With that, the door slid open, and a round-faced woman with a card full of sweets beamed around the compartment.</p><p>"Would you like anything of the trolly?"</p>
