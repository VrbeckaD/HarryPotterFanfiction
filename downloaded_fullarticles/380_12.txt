    <p>"Come on, we get it, you two have bad blood, but can't you two please put that behind you and just try to be friends like me and Harry did" Draco Malfoy exclaimed in an outburst. He and his lover, Harry Potter, had invited their two closest female friends over for a dinner. They had hoped that event would be lively and help the two girls get to know each other better so that they could all hang out together, but so far the only thing that had come from it was awkward silence and a few rushed moment of dialogue.<br/>Pansy scoffed and rolled her eyes at her friends outburst. "Draco there isn't bad blood between us, at least, not from my side" she said, turning to look inquisitively at Hermione before turning back to face Draco, "and unlike with you and Harry there wasn't years worth of mutual pining before we became friends, and then lovers".<br/>Harry intervened telling her she understood what Draco was saying, and if he could forgive Draco for bringing an army of Death Eaters into the school, then they could forgive each other for whatever happened at Hogwarts, or at the very least make basic conversation with each other. <br/>"It isn't like we're trying to avoid talking to each other" Hermione said, quickly turning to look at Pansy and saying "I'm truly not, I hope you don't think that" before smiling when Pansy shook her head and said she completely understood. "but we just don't know anything about each other, our lives and such are complete mysteries to each other".<br/>Harry and Draco suddenly got a look on their faces and said "exactly!" at the same time before Draco continued on, "and you'll never get to know anything about each other unless you two talk to each other, so please, at least try".<br/>Hermione sighed before turning to Pansy. "Pansy, how have you been?"<br/>"Okay I guess, I just got a cat" she said with a laugh, "he's very noising and a bit excitable but I love him, and he has the cutest paws".<br/>Hermione smiled, remembering when she first got Crookshanks. "I know the feeling, when I first got my cat I didn't understand how he could eat so much, then sleep for three hours, luckily for me I got to miss out on his playful stage".<br/>Pansy looked shocked, forgetting that Hermione had a cat before asking her if she still had him. <br/>"I do" she said before taking a sip of the lemonade that Draco had offered her when she first got to the house, "Though he's nineteen, so I don't imagine he has much longer".<br/>"I'm sorry, I know the impending lost of a beloved pet can be hard, when I was six I had an owl, but he was very old and by the time I was eight he was gone" Pansy said, trying to give Hermione a sympathetic smile. <br/>"I don't want to spend any more of his days worrying that he will soon be dying, that is to painful, instead I'll enjoy him while he's here, and miss him when he's gone" Hermione said, and Pansy nodded to her, trying to show her support. <br/>"See, it wasn't to terrible was it, now you just need to ask more questions and spend more time together, but I suppose it's to late now, we all have to work tomorrow" Draco said, clearly proud of himself for uniting the two friends. <br/>"I suppose you're right, good night Draco, good night Harry" Pansy said, smiling at the boys before turning to face Hermione. "Good night Hermione, I look forward to seeing you in the near future, if these two have anything to do with it I imagine we'll be bumping into each other again soon.  </p>
<p>The next time they saw each other was when they ran into each other at a muggle bookstore a short eighteen hours after they first saw each other. <br/>Hermione had been so focused scanning the titles of the books that she paid no attention to where she was going and ran into Pansy, knocking the book out of her hands. <br/>At first they didn't recognize each other but once Hermione picked the book up and handed it back to her they suddenly realized it was them. <br/>"I know I said I thought we would run into each other again shortly, but I didn't think it would be less than a day in between meetings, and that Draco and Harry wouldn't organise it" Pansy said, as she gratefully took the book from Hermione. <br/>Hermione let out her loud laugh, which made Pansy smile, before saying "as far as I'm concerned they probably did plan this whole thing, they probably put a spell on us to make sure we would be here at the same time, they're probably watching right now to make sure everything is going to plan".<br/>Pansy giggled merrily, before trying to focus on the book she was wondering whether or not to buy. "Have you ever read this, I'm thinking about buying it, but the plot seems a little strange to me, and the writing style confuses me, but something about it intrigues me".<br/>The book in her hands was a murder mystery that took place aboard a boat in the middle of the pacific ocean. The first murder happened two days into the sixteen day journey. To try and stop the murders from taking their next victim, two girls from first class join together to solve the mystery, and in the process found themselves falling in love. It was one of Hermione's favorite's, and it helped her understand the feelings she was having and gave her the support she needed to come out as pansexual.   <br/>"I love it, it's one of my favorite's in my private library, and it feels like it's my go to feel good book, plus it really helped me understand myself, it features a queer relationship" Hermione said smiling as she looked at the updated cover of the book. This cover was less shameful about the two girls' relationship than the one she had brought. There was a picture of two girls kissing on the roof of a cruise ship on this one, while on her's there was just a picture of the front of the boat. <br/>"Oh I know about the queer relationship" Pansy said quickly, "it's what actually attracted me to it".<br/>Hermione made a look of shock before saying, "oh, are you into that sort of stuff, sorry if that sounds rude I just, I had no idea".<br/>Pansy let out a sweet giggle again before explaining to Hermione that while she was pretty good at hiding it from everyone who wasn't important to her her close friends and family had known all along, and were so glad when she finally came out so she could stop pretending to like boys who she had no connection to. <br/>Hermione smiled at her before asking what she identified as. <br/>"I'm a lesbian, oh god, its taken me a long time to finally feel comfortable with saying that" she said with a chuckle, and then she placed the book in her shopping basket, before asking her "what about you, are you straight or?"<br/>Hermione smiled, glad that she finally got to say it to someone. Her friends had already known so when she hooked up with a girl after the war they left it at that, and by the time she realized how she had obliviated her parents and they were long gone. "I'm pan" she said confidently, and was glad to see Pansy smiling at her. <br/>"Well, I suppose Draco and Harry were right, we do seem to have something in common" Pansy said, before she payed for the book and walked outside with Hermione beside her. <br/>"I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm happy for it" Hermione said, and with that they split and went their different ways.</p>
<p>The next time they saw each other was two weeks after the bookstore. <br/>Hermione had decided to come over to Harry and Draco's apartment to offer to babysit Teddy on valentines day, as she was certain they would want to do something romantic. <br/>But when she got there and was let into the house she was greeted by a tired looking Pansy, who was still wearing her pajamas. <br/>Hermione made a look of shock before immediately apologizing, saying she was looking for Harry or Draco<br/>"Unfortunately they've gone out to do some grocery shopping" she said before giving Hermione an apologetic smile, "but I suspect they will soon be back if you want to come inside, I'm watching a movie, and I've just made some tea".<br/>"If I'm not intruding" she said, and once Pansy reassured her that she wasn't she walked through the doorway. <br/>On the left of the doorway was the kitchen, and just past the kitchen wall was the living room. <br/>She had clearly spent all day there, as there were possibly hundreds of papers and at least ten textbooks spread over the table, and on the small table next to the lounge was a bucket of popcorn and a smoothie<br/>"Sorry about the mess" she said as she tried to clean up the books and paper, "I often create messes when I spend the day at home studying".<br/>"Oh, what are you studying?" Hermione asked in a surprised tone. She had expected Pansy to live out her life in a mansion somewhere like most pureblood family's who had not been actively involved in the war and therefore were allowed to keep their money. <br/>"I'm going to become a healer" she said, and recognising the unspoken question on Hermione's face she continued with "I thought about it for a long time you know, retreating to a nice house in the woods and living my days out on my parents money, and then whatever was left of my inheritance, but my parents where horrible people, and I have never felt better than when I decided that I was done with them and I became independant". <br/>"Is that why your living with Harry and Draco?" she asked before she could really think about what she was saying, "oh my god I am so sorry for saying that, I wasn't thinking" she apologised, her face going red. <br/>"It's fine" Pansy said, stifling a laugh, "I do live here, though not because I don't have somewhere to live, my apartment building is being renovated so I won't be able to go back there for at least till the end of the month, and Draco and Harry were kind enough to let me stay here".<br/>"How are you able to afford an apartment?" she said, before mentally slapping herself for bringing up the other girls finances. <br/>She looked like she didn't mind, and answered by telling her the way she was studying allowed for her to do basic cases and make an earning off of them, but also learn most of the day.<br/>She nodded and sat down on the lounge before asking "so why are you home today?'.<br/>"Oh today is my study at home day, St Mungo thinks it's important that students keep a good work life balance, but all we do is study so there's really no point of it, but I prefer to study at home than in that ugly white building" she said with a laugh.<br/>Abruptly, Hermione offered her hand to the other girl. "Can we please be friends, you seem like a remarkable person, and I would love to get to know you better, I would love to hang out with you, on purpose and not because of Harry and Draco".<br/>"Of course" Pansy said shaking her hand before letting out a laugh, "I can't believe the brightest witch of her age just called me remarkable".</p>
