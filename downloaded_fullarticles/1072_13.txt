    <p>They would never say it out loud, but Hadrian, their adopted son, was not as normal as they had first foreseen.</p><p>If there was someone to blame, then they had to blame themselves. The workers in the orphanage had warned them that while he was pretty, the kid was too smart for his own good, and a bit dangerous, but they were blinded by his striking eyes and sweet smile. They adopted him, but only Melissa felt like he was her son.</p><p>Arthur only watched from afar.</p><p>The first few days they were embracing their ignorance with the warm feeling of being newly-made parents, simply stating that his son was special, pretending that the red flags weren’t present and waving wildly at them. They taught him how to speak Polish and French, and showed him their family through photos; Melissa couldn’t hide her excitement to show her family how beautiful her son was, and would never hear any comment that they make in a negative light against him. She couldn’t bear a child, and this one was hers. </p><p>Arthur tried to remove the blindfold off of her eyes, but she held tightly against the fabric, pressing him tightly to his chest as if could do no evil.</p><p>Hadrian was impolite, border lining on rude towards others, holding zero trusts on adults, going as far as ignoring them, much to his mother’s consternation. She never really saw those attitudes that Hadrian’s previous professors would criticize, but she was aware of other things. </p><p>He had the strange habit where his eyes would wander around, with an absent-minded expression on his pale face, or suddenly glare at something on an empty wall, but it was fine. It was all completely fine, she stated, no matter how much Arthur would shake her shoulders to try to make her see reason, her son was just different.</p><p>It was, in her opinion, almost a sin to blame a kid for things they can’t stop, not that she could have voiced that without Arthur laughing at her. </p><p>Melissa also noticed some other things: how fast he healed, once he fell from the top of a tree and injured the entirety of the left side of his face, only for the next day to have no mark or sign of any trauma, but she just shrugged that and appreciated that his son was no longer in pain, instead of wondering how did he do that. </p><p>He was also a private boy and would prefer to be by himself all the time. He didn’t care if the house-workers would tell him they had to be present to make sure he was safe, Hadrian would simply glare at them until they retired, and only then they would hear again his voice fill the room.</p><p>The only word that could be used to tag the boy was: odd.</p><p>Arthur wasn’t going to have any of that.</p><p>He started to organize play-dates with his acquaintances’ sons, concerned by his lack of… everything. He thought that maybe he would be excited, but the boy simply shrugged and mumbled how it was better to play by himself. Arthur didn’t care for what he wanted, the kid needed to be more normal, so the next day they prepared everything for their first play-date.</p><p>One of the kids ended up with a twisted ankle. Until days later they received a call from his mom, and that ‘twisted ankle’ became a broken one. Melissa felt terrible for Alfred, who loved to play football and possibly couldn’t do it ever again.</p><p>That was the last time that any other kids came to their home. And she knew that behind closed doors, the mother’s were blaming them.</p><p>Her son would only get private lessons with his tutor, Winston Blackfield, a man that Melissa hated with a fiery passion. </p><p>She was not dumb. She heard how Blackfield spoke to her son, and she wasn't happy about it. When she confronted Arthur he dismissed the situation, stating that Hadrian needed to build a stronger character and that she should stop trying to spoil him. That ‘everyone goes through the same and that that wouldn't break him.’ She wanted to reply, but he left her in the middle of the hallway announcing how busy he was, and that she should stop trying to fight over that topic anymore.</p><p>There was no way for her to just ‘calm down,’ especially with knowing how tutors liked corporal punishments for what they felt were disrespectful and judging by the man’s short temperament, his kid was being constantly punished. But she couldn’t go against Arthur’s word.</p><p>Still, she warned Mr Blackfield to never harm her son again, only to have the small and rude man to dare and look offended.</p><p>"I only do what's necessary. If it’s not necessary to punish a child, I certainly wouldn’t do it. Kids now are ignoring authority, doing what they please. They have no idea how hard life is, with their <em>parents,” </em>he spat the word, making her almost step back, “spoiling them rotten, only for us to fix your mistakes. They need to understand who has the power and who needs to obey.” He made an ugly expression, looking her up and down. “It’s embarrassing that his wife can’t control herself.”</p><p>It wasn’t a surprise that Arthur came home furious with her, but she didn’t bow down. She felt helpless in a world where she had no voice, and where her husband appeared to be blinded by his queer hatred towards her sweet boy. He seemed so fragile, so small, so tiny. She certainly couldn’t grab him and run, just escape from this place and leave Arthur behind if he had no interest in protecting them both.</p><p>Melissa sighed heavily as her paintbrush slid a bit too far and made the sunflower on his painting look a bit too… She get’s a clean brush and a bit of brown paint and transforms the mistake into the shadow made by the flower with a soft smile. She could probably hang this in Hadrian’s bedroom. A knock on the door makes her turn on her chair.</p><p>“Yes, Finnian?” The boy bows his head a bit, throwing a glance at the two men standing next.</p><p>“Excuse me, miss. These gentlemen need to speak with you,” he says in his low voice, trembling a bit. </p><p>“Oh? I didn’t know we were expecting anyone,” she says calmly, putting down her brush in the dark water and taking off the apron that was laced over her cloth to protect her from her usual messy painting. She puts it all down and walks towards them, and putting all her effort on not judging their strange fashion, she extends a hand for them to take. “What may I help you with?”</p><p>“We need to speak in private,” they said calmly startling Finnian who threw a glance at her before bowing once more and leaving them alone in the room. Melissa clears her throat that was suddenly dry and steps back a bit to get more distance between them. “This is about your son, Madam.”</p><p><em> Hadrian? </em>“What do you have to say about my son?” She asks with a frown. She didn’t like people wanting to talk about Hadrian. She didn’t want that name on anyone’s lips to muster with so much contempt. “What is it that there's to say about him?”</p><p>The one that appeared to be in charge gestured towards the light-blue armchair just behind her.</p><p>“It’s better that you sit, ma’am. This won’t be easy to explain.”</p><p>But he simply didn’t care to make it easier. He simply shrugged any care on the world and blurted out the words as if they were nothing, only for his partner to take the floor and give a more in-depth… translation of what she was listening to. The world around her was spinning out of control, and the floor seemed to shake like a leaf, just like her chest. They let her panic, but do nothing to calm her, nor even to help her breath. Melissa blinks away the confusion but asks for proof. Maybe they were fooling her, maybe they were lying, but then the one who spoke first wiped out a long thin stick from under his sleeve and a small ball of light coming from the tip of it. She couldn’t believe it. She thought about all those tricks that some magicians would do to fool the audience, the less-educated people who were easily impressed by any cheap ruse, but then, after seeing her doubt, he pointed the stick towards one of her paintings and she jumped to her feet as this was floating. Melissa held her chest when it touched the ceiling very lightly, just a quick tap, to return to its place on the nail. </p><p>“Ok… I’ll believe you… My son…”</p><p>They waited for her.</p><p>“My son is a wizard?” She says or asks. It sounded like a question but after seeing… that, she did not doubt that he could do stuff like that. Her mind flashes with that time in which his toys appeared in the drawing-room even if they were under a locked toybox. How fast he healed, how his wishes magically came true, how the people that harmed him were dealt with. Her eyes glanced around, lost, looking for something to fixate on to not feel so alone. They were there, still standing straight like soldiers, but uncaring of her fear they didn’t bow down or tried to look less frightening. She swallows, but there was no saliva, “I…” Her mouth shuts again, to try and swallow again. Melissa looked at her table but her glass of water was empty. </p><p>“Allow me,” the glass flew to his hand, and his partner filled it up with water that came right from the wand. She blinks a couple of times with the glass still held firmly. “It’s safe to consume.”</p><p>She has to believe, for his throat was starting to hurt and drinks the whole glass in three big gulps. <em> Too unladylike, </em>she can almost hear someone whisper in her ear as she slumped on the armchair. Her legs were trembling too much for her to remain standing. Melissa clears her throat.</p><p>“I understand,” she accepts at the end, but they give no response, “I understand and… yes, he is a wizard. That’s… amazing. But that doesn’t answer me why are you here?”</p><p> </p><p>------------------</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian’s classroom was a small room on the Mansion, perfectly transformed for him to have all of his classes under the watchful eye of the house-workers and his overprotective mom. It had a desk, several bookcases, and a bigger desk for his private tutors. The room had plenty of outside light and had a perfect temperature. </p><p>But the window was now open, blowing away all the papers that were previously stacked on his desk, next to his pen and ink and a small pouch for his belongings and a comfortable wooden chair. Nothing else. </p><p>But the chair had fallen back, and the desk had been thrown to a wall, causing the wood denting on the area of collision, some books of the bookcase had fallen from their place, and in the middle of the room, over the blue carpet was his used-to-be professor lying face-down on the floor. Motionless and in silence.</p><p>The thoughts on his mind had been filled by panicked screams and cries, even if his exterior was calm and collected where he was sitting under the window with his knees pulled to his chest and his arms around his legs. He was a clear image of regret and fear.</p><p>“I killed him,” he muttered with no emotions, doing his best to repress a burst of loud booming laughter from the depths of his stomach. Hadrian said it out loud instead of thinking those three single words, for someone was listening. <em> He </em>was always listening. Not Mr Blackfield, no, he won’t be able to listen to anything ever again. He looked down at his arm, where the deep cut the man had down with the metal rod was starting to close, and the blood to dry and there was nothing but a pink scar that looked like the scales of an animal. In fact, they were more like the scales of a snake than an actual scar, he was grateful that his mom never noticed before. </p><p>He looks again at the corpse with a sigh. Half of him was relieved that the man was gone, that that irrational side of him that had always wanted to harm the Muggle, from the very first moment he stepped in his home and stare down at his mom like she was nothing. When he saw that he felt his magic starting to tingle in the tip of his fingers, but he closed his fists to repress that. This wasn’t supposed to happen: the killing, or even harming. Hating should be just that: a burning distaste for someone, but it should have never raised to reeling on having them dead on the floor of the Mansion.</p><p>Hadrian was mad at himself, and at his impulses. He wasn't supposed to bring attention, he wasn’t supposed to get more watchful eyes glaring down at him. This is what he feared so much when <em> He </em>decided to bring him back, back to his childhood, for he had no real control on his magic, but he had the same amount of power from when he died. If his magic used to be a wild card, now it was the whole damn deck of cards.</p><p>He hears his irrational side jump in again, debating on where to hide the body, while his more rational side, although not fully aware, was just chanting repeatedly to Obliviate his mom over and over again.</p><p><em> It wouldn’t be the first time, </em>it mumbled against his ear with a hissing and cold laugh that made his insides freeze. Guilt took over at it. She was sweet, caring, lovely, the best mom he could ask for, but more than once she appeared when he was conversing with a grass snake or making things float to test and practice his powers. Her blue eyes would just suddenly open widely, glancing at whatever she walked in, they will fill with an awestruck and fond shine that made a warm and comforting feel expand on his chest like one of her hugs. But then, after processing what she was seeing that reaction would only morph to overwhelming horror and he’ll have to act. </p><p>His whole body shivered when the door started to crack open with a quiet <em>screech. </em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
