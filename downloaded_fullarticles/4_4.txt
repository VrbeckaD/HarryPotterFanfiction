    <p>Blaring lights, noises filled the small room.</p><p>Peeling his eyes open his view came into focus.</p><p>White. </p><p>Pale.</p><p>The warm body that sat next to him, clutching his hand sniffed.</p><p>Who? </p><p>Turning made his head hurt, it sent sharp pain spiraling up his head, stabbing at his eyes.</p><p>Why? </p><p>Questions came to his mind in fragments, not full thoughts, only fragments.</p><p>Who? </p><p>They began repeating themselves, but, for different reasons.</p><p>Pale light. </p><p>Two words now. </p><p>Bright. </p><p>Warm. </p><p>Thoughts made his head hurt, he began trying to stop them, however, that only made it worse.</p><p>Fuck. </p><p>Words, annoying habits of our brain.</p><p>"Stop trying to move." The person besides him spluttered. He sounded congested, like he had been crying.</p><p>Who? </p><p>Why? </p><p>Pale. </p><p>Light. </p><p>Warm.</p><p>The man shook his head, sending spirals of pain shooting through his head.</p><p>His mouth was dry, but, he couldn't find the words to tell the man sitting beside him that.</p><p>"Don't move." The man stressed the fact he wasn't supposed to move.</p><p>The hand tightened ever so slightly.</p><p>Tight. </p><p>The man lying in the bed licked his lips.</p><p>"Is your mouth dry?" The warm entity asked.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>"The doctor said it would be, why don't we get you up and get you something to drink?" Then the hand left the man's hand, pulling him up ever so lightly.</p><p>Gone. Was the next thought. </p><p>Small. </p><p>White. </p><p>Noisy. </p><p>He turned his head slightly. </p><p>His eyes fell upon a beautiful man, he had pale alabaster skin, almost translucent, he had snow white hair that sat in heavy waves on the top of his head, and striking blue-gray eyes. The only thing was, he had red rings under them.</p><p>"Hello, My name is Draco Malfoy, and yours is Harry Potter." A single tear ran down the pale man's cheek. He sniffed.</p><p>"Let's get you some water, shall we?"</p><p>Sad was the next thought.</p>
