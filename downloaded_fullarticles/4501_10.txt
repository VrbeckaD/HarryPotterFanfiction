    <p>“You got the pages?” Ron asked as Hermione hurried up to the Gryffindors crowded together in the snow-filled courtyard. The mystery of why Granger was making a jingling sound was solved when she pushed a heavy handbell into Ron’s grasp.</p><p>"Sure. Enough for everyone, I hope. If not, we can share.”</p><p>"Do we have to do this?” Seamus complained as he accepted one of the sheets that Hermione was thrusting around. Dean and Neville waited on the reply as well before either accepted a page.</p><p>“It’s worth ten extra points each,” Hermione reminded them. “Professor McGonagall said she would join us.”</p><p>“Who are we going to carol to? Slytherin?” Seamus laughed rudely. </p><p>“It’s the last night before break. No harm in it,” Neville urged Seamus and Dean. “I can use all the extra points I can get.”</p><p>“Where do we start?” Ron asked, staring around. </p><p>Hermione scanned around, at a slight loss. Hagrid came dragging a tree across the lawn right at that moment, followed by Professor Flitwick and Harry. Flitwick was floating several lit candles, and Harry was wrapped in yards of tinsel and garland.</p><p>“We’ll try it on them first,” Hermione decided, rushing towards them. The other students followed as if tethered to her. “Another voice is always welcome,” Hermione said, pulling Harry to her side and showing him the page. </p><p>“I....my....voice...” he squeaked. </p><p>You’ve been sounding much better all week,” she told him before he could weasel out of it. Ron quelled a chuckle and poked him in the arm.</p><p>“We’ll sound terrible together, and no one will know who to blame,” Ron urged him. “You have to. If you can’t sing, you can ring the bell,” he added, shoving the handbell at Harry. Unspoken in that was Ron’s feeling that if he had to make a fool of himself, everyone should also be obligated. Hagrid unwound the shining silver strands from around Harry’s robes, motioning for him to untangle the garland too. Harry was clutching it very tightly as if he didn’t want to give it up. Hagrid began to tug, and Harry let released it, nearly dropping the bell.</p><p>“Go on ahead, lad. Professor Flitwick and I will see that the tree is replaced. I wish we knew who was snatching them though,” Hagrid said. </p><p>“Someone who doesn’t want a tree in that particular spot, it would seem,” Harry mused.            </p><p>“Tell us how we sound, and be honest,” Hermione said. The Gryffindors hummed a single note together and began to sing. Hagrid and Flitwick smiled anxiously but patiently– after all, they were wearing earmuffs. No matter how bad it actually was, and it was perfectly horrendous, they could keep on smiling. Two choruses later, Hagrid put up a hand and waved for them to halt. The singing stopped at different intervals, falling away like lumps of mangy hair.</p><p>“That’s lovely. Time to go. You lot should get inside out of the cold. Try the main hall, or the corridors. I think I see a light on in the dungeons,” he chuckled. Hagrid patted Harry on the head before shoving the children along.</p>
