<p>Prophet Pin Up</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“I hate you,” muttered James.</p>
<p>“Why? I’m lovely.” Scorpius pivoted, showing off his backside. James looked away guiltily. </p>
<p>“You tricked me into this, you…Slytherin!” </p>
<p>Scorpius flipped his hair over his shoulder, smouldering at the camera. “It’s for a good cause, so hush and keep posing. And you <i>love</i> that I’m Slytherin.” </p>
<p>“Whatever,” James grumbled, but he did smile as the <i>Daily Prophet</i> photographer continued snapping pictures. </p>
<p>Finally, just when James thought he was going to collapse, the photographer said, “That’s it! Thanks, lads.” </p>
<p>“When will it be published?” Scorpius asked, Summoning a dressing gown. </p>
<p>“This weekend.”</p>
<p>Scorpius smirked. “Perfect.”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Wow,” said Albus Severus, holding up the <i>Daily Prophet</i> for everyone to see. “You make a great a pin-up, bro.” </p>
<p>Shaking his head and silently vowing retribution on Scorpius, James bent low over his breakfast, but that didn’t stop his siblings. </p>
<p>“Oooh,” said Lily, pretending to swoon. “You’re famous! May I have your autograph, Jamie?” </p>
<p>Harry shook his head. “That’s enough.” He winked. “You’re embarrassing our newest underwear model celebrity.” </p>
<p>Severus, beside him, smirked. “Potters do love notoriety.” </p>
<p>Harry grinned at him. “Seriously, James. Congratulations.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. Congratulations.”  </p>
<p>James sighed. “Thanks, Dad. Severus.” Yes, he was going to kill Scorpius Malfoy.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Arriving at Malfoy Manor, James demanded to see Scorpius. The house-elf, eyes wide, took him to Scorpius’ suite. </p>
<p>James knocked, and when he didn’t hear anything, opened the door. “Scorpius?” </p>
<p>Scowling, James looked around. Several copies of the <i>Daily Prophet</i> lay about, and James rolled his eyes. </p>
<p>“Ohhh, James,” Scorpius moaned from an adjoining room. </p>
<p>“Oh, har har, very funny,” James said, walking over. “My family did that all morning over breakfast—Oh shit!” </p>
<p>Scorpius, on a chair, legs spread, was wanking, his head thrown back. And the moment he saw James, he bit his lip and came, cock pulsing. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Fuck,” James muttered as he paced. “Shit.” </p>
<p>As he was about to Disapparate, the door opened and Scorpius emerged, fully dressed, expression unreadable. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry!” James blurted. “I shouldn’t have barged in.” </p>
<p>Scorpius raised an eyebrow, looking for all the world like he hadn’t just been coming hard moments earlier. “How did you get in?”</p>
<p>“House-elf,” James choked out. </p>
<p>“Ah.” Scorpius gestured, and all the <i>Daily Prophets</i> folded themselves into a neat pile. “Well, I suppose it’s time you found out.” </p>
<p>“Found out?” </p>
<p>“That I fancy you.” </p>
<p>“Right.” James exhaled. “I…wow.”</p>
<p>Scorpius smiled faintly. “Good wow?”</p>
<p>James swallowed. “Very.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“I wish you’d just joined me earlier,” Scorpius murmured. </p>
<p>James, staring at the ceiling, frowned. “Hm?” </p>
<p>“I was dressed for two minutes.” Scorpius waved at his crumpled robes at the foot of the bed. “Wasted a fabulous outfit.” </p>
<p>James snorted. “Just quit wearing fancy robes.” </p>
<p>“Why?” </p>
<p>“So I won’t have to rip them off.” </p>
<p>Slowly, Scorpius smiled. “Maybe I’ll go shopping.” </p>
<p>Growling, James rolled over on top of him. “Yeah?” </p>
<p>Scorpius looped his arms around James’ neck. “Paying that <i>Daily Prophet</i> photographer was worth it.”</p>
<p>“Wait, you <i>paid</i> him? Why?” </p>
<p>“I needed wank material.” </p>
<p>James smirked. “Now you don’t.” </p>
<p>“True.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Once they’d caught their breath, they gave it another go, James moving slowly as he explored Scorpius thoroughly. By the time he entered Scorpius, James was barely clinging to sanity, fighting not to come too soon.</p>
<p>Somehow, James managed to wait until Scorpius came before finding his own pleasure. </p>
<p>Afterward, as they curled together, Scorpius hummed. “One question.” </p>
<p>“Mmhm.” </p>
<p>“Is there something you need to confess about your family?”</p>
<p>“No. Why?” </p>
<p>“Earlier when you came in, you said your family was wanking to your <i>Daily Prophet</i> picture.” </p>
<p>“What? No!” </p>
<p>“But you said—”</p>
<p>“I thought—” James groaned, kissing Scorpius. “Never mind.” </p>
