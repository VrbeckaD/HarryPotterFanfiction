          <div class="userstuff"><p>She was never a girl to do things like this.<br/>Never the one to fall into it so easily.<br/>Never a girl to be fooled with.</p><p>But here she is.</p><p>In the same muggle park, outside of London, waiting for him.</p><p>She hates it really.<br/>To be this weak!<br/>To always return.<br/>To be the one to wait!</p><p>Because not once has she been certain he’s coming.</p><p>And yet she’s here,<br/>waiting<br/>and however pathetic it sounds,<br/>hoping he’ll come.</p><p>He’s like an addiction she can’t fight.<br/>A magnet pulling her to him no matter how she tries to fight back.</p><p>He’s inevitable.<br/>Uncontrollable.</p><p>And without him, she feels she’s wilting.</p><p>It’s insane.<br/>Immoral and unforgivable.</p><p>But she’s still here.</p><p>Still under this same tree in the shadows of the twilight.<br/>Waiting for him.</p><p>Because she’s weak.</p><p>And the want,<br/>the need,<br/>is too strong!<br/>Too much for her to stand against.</p><p>She fought a war but she can’t fight desire.</p><p>How pathetic.</p><p>She should never have let him under her skin.<br/>Under her.</p><p>Should never have given herself a taste.</p><p>But she did.</p><p>And with that one taste, she was hooked.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>She was never meant to meet him.<br/>He was never supposed to be there!</p><p>She was never supposed to storm out of her apartment after another fight with Ron and end up in the muggle club with Ginny.</p><p>She was never supposed to be there either!</p><p>But she was.<br/>And he was.</p><p>And that’s how it started.</p><p>There were champagne and tequila.<br/>More than one shot of vodka and more than one drink of gin and tonic.<br/>There were more than a few people,<br/>and the music was more than loud.</p><p>She felt more than lonely, even with her friend as a company.</p><p>But the loneliness drowned in the alcohol.<br/>The anger dissolved in the glass she was holding.<br/>And then all that was left was the boom of the bass and the flashing of the lights.</p><p>Bodies covered in sweat dancing on the packed dance floor and the absolution of alcohol in her veins.</p><p>Ron would have disapproved her behavior.</p><p>She had never left like that.<br/>Or even when she had, she’d come back an hour later and apologize.</p><p>But that was the problem.</p><p>It was always her. Always her apology and his forgiveness.<br/>Never the other way around.</p><p>Never.</p><p>And tonight, she didn’t want to care.<br/>Let him find her for a chance.<br/>And if not,<br/>Let it be his loss.</p><p>She did love him.<br/>He was her best friend.</p><p>But she felt empty.</p><p>After everything they went through.<br/>The war and the dying and the recovery.<br/>She felt like she didn’t know where she wanted her life to take her.</p><p>He wanted a family.<br/>But she was only twenty!</p><p>Too young, she’d told him.<br/>And he said he was ready to wait.</p><p>But still, she was almost sure it was the very thing that made a rift between them.<br/>Prevented them from finding each other in a way they once did.<br/>Left her hollow and in need of something she couldn’t put a name on.</p><p>But she loved him.</p><p>And she couldn’t leave him.<br/>Because who was she without him?</p><p>Even now, dancing her heart away, alcohol pumping in her veins and the music electrifying her body, she felt the same hollowness.</p><p>The feeling of being completely alone.</p><p>Ginny leaves for the toilet and she’s left on the dance floor, surrounded by strangers.</p><p>But it doesn’t matter.</p><p>She lets herself drown into the bass and the flicker of lights.<br/>The song changes and suddenly there’s a hard body pressed against her back.<br/>Strong arms grab her hips as he moves with her.</p><p>She doesn’t mind.</p><p>This is a club, people dance, She could excuse herself if she wanted.<br/>But the heat is what she needs at the moment.</p><p>So she carries on dancing.</p><p>The stranger behind her moves her hair away from her neck and whispers in her ear,<br/>“Fancy seeing you here, Granger.”</p><p>His voice makes her flip around.</p><p>And then she’s facing him.<br/>His hands are still on her hips.<br/>They’re still moving, but the world around her has muted.</p><p>Maybe it’s the alcohol,<br/>or the heat,<br/>or the proximity of him,<br/>but he looks different than in her memories.</p><p>She should push him away,<br/>slap him,<br/>tell him to fuck off and leave her alone.</p><p>But the commands don’t register in her brain as they should.<br/>Nothing about him registers as it should.</p><p>His eyes are dark,<br/>his blond hair mussed and he’s wearing a white shirt with rolled sleeves.<br/>He looks better than she remembers him looking.</p><p>The spots where his hands touch her hips send jolts of electricity all over her body.</p><p>No matter how she tries to think that it’s him!<br/>Her body reacts like he’s just another attractive man seeking her attention.</p><p>That’s when she decides not to care.</p><p>She could act like he’s just another attractive man on the dance floor of a Muggle club.<br/>She could be careless because in the end she’s with Ron<br/>and she’s going to leave with Ginny and return home<br/>and this could be just dancing anyway.</p><p>So she just locks her eyes with him and starts to move again.</p><p>Try me,<br/>she tells him with her eyes<br/>I dare you.</p><p>And they dance<br/>the only way they know how to,<br/>like it’s a competition.</p><p>She’s not sure what’s the price?<br/>Or what are they trying to do to each other?<br/>But his hands never leave her hips.<br/>She shakes and grinds shamelessly.<br/>He matches her every move.</p><p>She has never danced with anyone like that.</p><p>Ron doesn’t dance.<br/>And what reason has she had to dance like this with other men?</p><p>But this is Draco Malfoy<br/>and when it comes to him there’s always something to prove.</p><p>She doesn’t see Ginny again that night.<br/>And Ginny doesn’t see her.</p><p>Thank god!</p><p>All she sees is him.<br/>And all there is, is his body against hers and his hands on her hips<br/>and the rhythm.</p><p>“I need to get air!” She yells to his ear after what feels like hours.<br/>And then,<br/>without thinking what she’s doing,<br/>she takes his hand and pulls him out to the summer air.</p><p>She doesn’t know why,<br/>And maybe she never will,<br/>she doesn’t stop there.<br/>But pulls him to an alley behind the building and drags him to an alcove of a door.</p><p>Like someone might catch them.<br/>Like they were doing something forbidden.</p><p>He looks at her with his darkened grey eyes.<br/>Doesn’t say a word but the look is amused.</p><p>And she starts to laugh.<br/>Uncontrollably and happily.<br/>Because she feels unreal and crazy and…free.</p><p>“Hello, I’m Hermione Granger.” She tells and offers him her hand.</p><p>Like she doesn’t know him.<br/>Like he doesn’t know her.</p><p>Who knows, maybe they really don’t know each other.<br/>Especially not like this.</p><p>He plays along and takes her hand, “Draco Malfoy.”</p><p>It’s not exactly a handshake.<br/>And he doesn’t let go as he should.</p><p>“You’re a great dancer, Mr. Malfoy.” She looks at him boldly, not even trying to pull her hand away.</p><p>If there was any sense left in her, she’d run.<br/>Because the feelings in her chest are like a roaring flame.</p><p>The flickers his touch sends through her...<br/>like hellfire.<br/>Like something she has no control over<br/>something she can’t stop.</p><p>He smirks, “I had an excellent partner.”</p><p>She lifts her eyebrow.<br/>Very much aware that she’s standing way too close.</p><p>Ron! She tries to think.<br/>But again, the words don’t register as they should.</p><p>Her eyes dip to his lips.</p><p>She never lived through a life where you could hook up with a random stranger in a bar.<br/>She never had any interest in things like that.</p><p>Except he’s not a random stranger.<br/>And she still isn’t free to do things like that.</p><p>But why is the taste of his lips the only thing invading her mind at the moment?</p><p>“Granger…” Her drawls.</p><p>She lets out a breath she didn’t know she was holding.<br/>And the next thing she knows,<br/>though only vaguely,<br/>is that they’re kissing.</p><p>He’s pulling her to him sliding his hands on her hips.</p><p>She’s charged.<br/>Electrified from head to toe.<br/>His touch sends lightings through her body,<br/>making her feel like she’s going to burst out of her skin.</p><p>She’s mindless.<br/>And completely out of control.</p><p>His tongue parts her lips as he pushes her against the tiles of the wall.</p><p>She lets him.<br/>Does her share.<br/>Grabs the front of his shirt and pulls him closer to her.<br/>Moans against his mouth when his hand cups her breast.</p><p>The time she should have told him to stop,<br/>the time she should have backed away is long gone.</p><p>She has already floated too far in the open sea.<br/>The shore is nowhere to be found.<br/>So she lets the waves drown her.</p><p>Not surrender!</p><p>She’ll never surrender!<br/>Not to him!<br/>Not to anyone!</p><p><br/>Everything they do is competition.</p><p>It used to be a competition of hate.<br/>Now it’s a competition of lust.<br/>Of lips and tongues and hips and hands.<br/>And there’s no way to tell who's winning.</p><p>“Do you want to get out of here?” He whispers, trailing his lips against the skin of her throat.</p><p>No! That’s what she should say.</p><p>NOOOOO!</p><p>But she does.</p><p>She’s too far past the point of no return.<br/>So she nods.</p><p>And then they’re in his bed.<br/>In between silky sheets as slick as her morals.</p><p>She has only ever been with one man.<br/>And that one man, never made her feel quite like this.<br/>Like she’s floating on water,<br/>flying in the air<br/>and burning with fire<br/>all three at the same time.</p><p>There’s no hesitation in her hands either.</p><p>Like she knows how to touch him.<br/>Even though how could she know?<br/>She doesn’t even know him.<br/>Yet the way he touches her is like he knows exactly how to touch her.<br/>Like he knows exactly how to make her forget everything else.</p><p>And then he fucks her.<br/>Like no one ever did before.<br/>Slides her hands above her head and forces her to look at him as he enters her.</p><p>It’s a gift and a punishment.<br/>It’s tender and rough and all-consuming.</p><p>He makes her forget everything.<br/>Everything!<br/>As their bodies move together.</p><p>She claws his back<br/>and he bites her lip<br/>and sucks her neck,<br/>her chest,<br/>her breasts.</p><p>If she was in her right mind,<br/>she’d know they’ll both be scarred tomorrow.<br/>She'd care that bites like that are not easy to cover.</p><p>But she’s not.</p><p>He flicks them around in a sitting position and pulls her hard against him.<br/>Buries his hand to her hair and makes her look at him again.</p><p>“My name, Granger.” He breathes out as he thrusts into her.</p><p>She’s shivering above him, the waves of pleasure rolling through her,<br/>like the storm they ignited in the bar is reaching its breaking point.</p><p>“Say it.” He orders.</p><p>And she obeys because it’s the only thing she can do anymore: to scream.</p><p>And he follows her suit. Burying his face to her neck.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It’s been six months.</p><p>And she’s here.<br/>And she is still cheating on her boyfriend.<br/>And he has a fiancée for Christ sake!<br/>And still she can’t stay away.</p><p>He is fire<br/>and ice<br/>and water.</p><p>Burning hot,<br/>freezing cold<br/>and flowing like a liquid.</p><p>Hellfire and holy water.</p><p>And she can’t let him go.<br/>No matter how she tried.</p><p>She couldn’t.</p><p>So she’s the other woman.<br/>And he’s the other man.<br/>And no one has any idea of the double life they live.</p><p>It should hurt her to hurt the ones she loves.</p><p>But it doesn’t.</p><p>Because letting him go, would hurt more.</p></div>
