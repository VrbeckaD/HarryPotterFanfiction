I can't believe you and Sirius talked me into this,” she whined.</p><p>“Don't you want the perfect birthday party for Harry?”</p><p>Lily bit her lip. “Of course,” she admitted after a moment and sighed. “But this is so degrading.”</p><p>“And it gets better. Look what I have here!” James announced in a song- song voice.</p><p>“Yeah, thanks, I hate it,” Lily stated as she stared at the glittering red bridle. The worst part: golden lametta was attached to it.</p><p>“The matching saddle is in the living room. Mh, I thought you'd like the colors. Gryffindor for the win,” James teased and Lily rolled her eyes.</p><p>“It's not the colors!”</p><p>Remus chose this moment to join them.</p><p>“Lily, the cake looks amazing. Harry will be thrilled when he sees it.”</p><p>Lily’s face lightened up. “Thank you!”</p><p>“Remus, my man, always knowing what to say to make the ladies happy.”</p><p>Remus blushed lightly when James put one arm around his shoulder.</p><p>“Ignore him. I bet all the kids are waiting for the cake, so let's -”</p><p>“Actually,” Remus interrupted and grimaced, “they want to ride the ‘pwetty pony’.”</p><p>James stifled a laugh as Lily's smile faded and Remus shrugged apologetically. “Sorry.”</p><p>“It's okay. I'll do it for Harry,” Lily said and straightened her back before snatching the bridle out of James’ hands.</p><p>“Remus, if you would be so kind … There's no way I'll let James or Sirius bridle me. I'd never hear the end of it.”</p><p>“Of course,” Remus said.</p><p>She glared at her husband. “And I'm still convinced you planned this all along. You were the one suggesting a horse for my animagus.”</p><p>“That was years ago! How should I have known?!”</p><p>“Oooh, don't play innocent with me. Remus, we're going.”</p><p>With that she left and Remus followed her out into the backyard.</p><p>James snickered, returned to Sirius and the children and announced that the ‘pwetty pony’ would be ready in a few moments, gaining loud cheers from about twenty children.</p><p>“I'm glad Harry has so many friends,” he thought and watched the little rascals running around. “Though I almost feel bad for Lily.”</p><p>He saw Remus getting the saddle and could almost hear his sigh when he noticed the golden fringes.</p><p>James grinned. “Almost.”</p></div>
