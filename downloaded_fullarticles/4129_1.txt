  <span>Lance rubs his eyes and groans to himself, turning to the clock to check the time which reads 1:09 AM. He drops his quill and smiles to himself, realizing it’s an hour past the beginning of his 13th birthday on June 26. Lance looks back at his essay on witch-burning and suddenly loses all motivation to finish it tonight. He told himself he’d get it done at the beginning of the summer so he’d have the rest of it to relax, but that didn’t happen. His family went on a trip to the United States for a few weeks so he wasn’t able to start it. He knew doing it this late could wake the rest of his family, but he didn’t care - one, because Marco’s the only room next to his so waking him up wouldn’t upset Lance and two because it’s his birthday!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Excitement fills him as he puts his paper, ink, and quill away back on his desk. He suddenly can’t wait to enter his third year at Hogwarts. Marco would be entering his fifth year while Hannah and Lucy will be entering their seventh year. Lance is a bit sad Hannah and Lucy would be gone the following year and would rather have it be Marco, but it’s too late for any schemes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smiles to himself and thinks about what the rest of today will bring him when they celebrate. Hunk and his family would definitely come over for a potluck dinner. Lance sent an invite to Pidge, but she said her family would still be on vacation, but wished him the best. Lance is still sad at the fact that his mom won’t be here to celebrate, but he reminds himself she sacrificed herself to save him at the hands of Lord Zarkon. He then thinks back to his own encounters with Zarkon during the previous two years - the first one with the Balmera’s Crystal and the second in the Cavern of Mysteries - and feels relieved to have lived long enough to see his 13th birthday.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance turns when he notices an odd flapping thing approaching his window, but opens it once he realizes it’s three owls. They enter and he recognizes his own, Blue, and Hunk’s family owl, Vector, but doesn’t know the third one. He looks closer at the third little one and sees brown and white speckled feathers and yellow eyes.</span>
</p><p>

</p><p>
  <span>“Rover?” Lance whispers to the owl.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The owl ruffles his wings and headbutts Lance gently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance giggles. “It’s nice to finally meet you,” He removes the package and note from him and sends him back out the window. Lance opens the note and sees a picture of Pidge’s family in Egypt with a letter describing the trip. He sets it aside to read later before opening the package, smiling when he sees a Sneakoscope, which is a type of dark detector that looks like a glass spinning top; it lights up, spins, and whistles if someone is doing something untrustworthy nearby.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He ruffles Vector’s feathers, takes the note from him, and then sends him back out the window. Hunk’s note wishes Lance a happy birthday and says he’s excited to come over for dinner. Lance then removes the package from Blue and sees it’s a present from Slav. He opens it and sees the school book </span>
  <em>
    <span>The Monster Book of Monsters</span>
  </em>
  <span> attached with a note wishing Lance a happy birthday. He looks around disappointed when he doesn’t see anything from Keith, but tells himself that Keith’s foster dad is a jerk and probably didn’t let Keith get anything for Lance</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lastly, also attached to Blue is a letter from Hogwarts requesting that the form attached be signed by a guardian to allow the student to venture into the wizard village of Hogsmeade. Lance smirks to himself, knowing his father, Luis, would let him go since he allowed all of his other siblings to go before him. He falls asleep that night with a huge smile, knowing his birthday tomorrow (well, technically today) will be great.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The next morning, Lance runs down the stairs into the kitchen where his sister, Isa, has made breakfast. She smiles when she sees Lance. “Oh, Lance! Happy birthday!” She gives him a tight hug and kisses his forehead. “How did you sleep?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pretty good,” Lance replies. “Whatcha makin for-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“LANCE!” a voice shouts from the living room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance whirls around and yelps when Carlos tackles him to the ground. “OW! CARLOS!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Birthday tackles!” he exclaims with Lance pinned down. “You’ll never beat me!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance grumbles from underneath Carlos. “GET OFF YOU FAT OAF!” He tries shoving Carlos off of him, but to no avail. Lance grunts and tries kicking Carlos, but he still doesn’t budge. He huffs in defeat and slumps back on the floor. “Fine…you win.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carlos smiles widely at Lance and hops off of him. “That’s what I like to hear!” He extends a hand to help Lance up. “Maybe one day you’ll be close to beating me, but, for now, you’re still the smallest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance crosses his arms. “I’m the third tallest in the family! I grew out of my school robes!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carlos laughs. “Blah blah blah! You’ll always be my-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“¡Cállate!” Marco yells from the living room. “¡Estoy tratando de ver algo!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carlos, Isa, and Lance all exchange annoyed expressions before Lance leads Carlos into the living room where they find Marco watching a teleport of a dangerous escaped convict from Beta Traz. He uses the remote to turn the volume up. A wanted poster flashes on the screen of a woman with short black hair and pointed chin, yelling while being held against a wall so her picture can be taken. “Who’s Krolia Madelina?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s what I’m trying to find out!” Marco yells.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luis walks in the room and grabs the remote, turning the TV off. “That’s enough of that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wha-hey! I was watching that! I want to know who Krolia Madelina is!” Marco complains.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s the reason why your mother is dead,” Luis replies curtly. “That’s all I’m saying on the matter, alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance, Carlos, and Marco exchange a nervous expression with each other before nodding at their father. They know Rosa McClain’s death is still a sore subject for Luis, but he’s getting better with it. “Dad? Are we in danger?” Lance wonders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luis sighs and pulls Lance into a hug. “No, Lance, we are not in danger. The Ministry will catch her and she’ll be put back where she belongs, okay? Don’t fret about it, especially on such a special day!” He pulls away and smiles at Lance. “I think I smelled bacon in the kitchen!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance smiles widely. “YES! Oh, thank you Isa!” He runs over to hug her once she finishes setting the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aw, you’re welcome, Lance,” she replies with a smile. “I already ate because I have to go meet Pat at the train station. I need everyone to be on their best behavior, okay? No pranks!” She turns and glares at Carlos. “That means you and Ryland!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about me?” Ryland wonders, yawning as he hops from the last stair and leaps into the living room. “Sorry, just woke up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If either you or Carlos prank Pat today, I’ll end the both of you,” Isa threatens, grabbing her wand from the table. “I mean it!” She glares at them one last time before apparating out of the house with a flash.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carlos and Ryland exchange a confused expression. “I have no idea what she’s talking about!” Ryland exclaims. “She’s gone mad, I tell you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I agree, but she’s been like this since I’ve known her,” Carlos replies.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As if!” Hannah exclaims, stepping into the room. “You both are idiots and </span>
  <em>
    <span>always</span>
  </em>
  <span> get into trouble! If anyone’s gone mad it’s you two!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance frowns and crosses his arms. “Stop fighting! This is supposed to be a happy day for me!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Marco rolls his eyes. “Whatever.” He grabs a small plate of food and storms back upstairs, nearly plowing into Lucy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucy blinks in shock before shaking her head and hobbles over to Lance. Ever since she fell off her broom last year, she hasn’t been able to walk properly. Sometimes she needs crutches because the pain is too much to bear, but today seems like one of the days where she can handle it. “Well, he clearly woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.” She smiles at Lance. “Happy birthday to my favorite brother!” She gives him a tight hug and kisses his cheek. “Sorry Marco’s being a jerk.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine. He can do whatever he wants,” Lance replies. “I’m just excited for when the Garetts come over with more delicious food!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucy smiles at Lance again. “That’s the spirit.” She turns to Ryland when he walks over to her. “Hi.” Lucy giggles when Ryland pulls her close and kisses her gently on the lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey there,” Ryland whispers with a smirk. “Fancy meeting you here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance gags and turns away. “STOP IT! GROSS!” He glares at them. “You two are worse than Tasha and Hannah!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ryland laughs loudly and points at Hannah. “HAH! Lu and I win!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hannah sticks her tongue out at him and rolls her eyes. “Whatever! It wasn’t a competition anyway!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance huffs in annoyance and grabs a plate of pancakes and bacon before walking out onto the back porch to sit down. He sighs and pokes at his pancake with his fork, suddenly not hungry anymore. All of his siblings have someone here to hang out with who they care about, but Lance doesn’t have anyone! Well, he has Hunk, but he lives across the street and he’s been on vacation all of June so he doesn’t count.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He misses Keith. If Keith were here, they’d challenge Ryland and Carlos to something stupid then Lucy and Isa would have to yell at them. He chuckles to himself, remembering the Quidditch games they’d play in the backyard with Lance’s siblings and Hunk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance shakes his head, not wanting to make himself sad. He lifts up a piece of bacon and goes to eat it, but stops when he sees something furry run across the yard. “What the-” Lance says to himself as he stands to go investigate. He walks over to the tree and yelps when something pounces on him, knocking him to the ground. “OW! Who the-” He gasps when he comes face-to-face with an orange and black green-eyed cat. “Red?!”</span>
</p><p>

</p><p>
  <span>She meows loudly and shakes her front left foot in Lance’s face to show him a piece of parchment tied to it. Lance sits up and unties the paper from her paw, unrolling it to see a note from Keith.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Lance: </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> I hope this letter finds you…I don’t exactly have an owl to send out, but this is the best I could do. I can no longer stay at the foster home anymore. I somehow used magic in front of the muggle kids and the foster dad’s sister so I had to leave. Please take care of Red for me. </em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <em> I’ll see you at school…hopefully. </em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <em> Keith </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh no…Keith,” Lance whispers to himself. He scratches Red behind the ears then hoists her up into his arms. “Come on, let’s get you inside.” Lance walks back inside and finds his family still in the living room, but runs into Carlos in the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you have a cat in your arms? Wait…is that Red?” Carlos asks. He sets down his glass of orange juice and strokes Red’s back. She purrs and leaps into his arms. “What the hell is she doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance grimaces and shows Carlos the note from Keith. “We have to find him, Carlos.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We have no way of contacting Keith.” Carlos peeks into the living room then back at Lance. “Okay, so, we can’t let anyone know Red is here or else dad and Isa will explode. I’m sure Keith doesn’t want Shiro to get involved otherwise he’d send Red to Shiro. You distract everyone in there, I’ll get her up to your room.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance nods and heads into the living room. “So, is Isa back yet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucy turns to him and shakes her head no. “I have no idea what’s keeping her. The Garetts will be here soon.” She narrows her eyes at the paper in Lance’s hand. “What’s that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance quickly shoves the paper in his pocket. “Just a birthday letter from Pidge.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ryland raises an eyebrow. “Lance, my dude, you’re one crappy liar.” He smiles smugly, casually putting an arm around Lucy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance crosses his arms. “Why would I lie about a birthday letter? That seems stu-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly Isa and Patrick apparate back in the room along with all of Patrick’s bags. He smiles widely at everyone. “Hey everyone!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucy squeals and leaps up from the couch to hug him. “Ahh! You’re here! How’s Romania? How’re the dragons?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How’s Norbert?!” Lance asks with a wide smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Patrick laughs and winks at Lance. “Norberta actually!” He moves his shirt collar so it shows his shoulder, revealing a large scar. “Female dragons are much more violent than the males.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Isa gives his hand a squeeze and kisses his cheek. “Come on, let’s get your stuff up to my room then we’ll get Lance’s party started! The Garetts should be over soon!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Soon enough, the Garetts arrived and everyone celebrated Lance’s 13th birthday. Before dinner, Lance, Ryland, Carlos, Isa, Patrick, Hannah, and Hunk all got on brooms to play some Quidditch. Ryland and Carlos each declared themselves captains of their own teams while Patrick declared himself the referee. Since they didn’t have enough for two full teams, Lance and Hannah both made themselves Chasers. Ryland chose Isa and Hannah for his team while Carlos picked Lance and Hunk. Isa played as Keeper for Ryland and Hunk played as Keeper for Carlos. Lance expected Patrick to be a bias ref, but he surprisingly was very fair. He called fouls on both teams equally, but Carlos’s team prevailed nonetheless - Hunk truly was an amazing Keeper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once they were called in for dinner, Lance opened his present from the Garetts and saw that they bought him a Broomstick Servicing Kit. Lance was very grateful for the gift, but admitted he’d been using Isa’s old broom at school. Luis then brought out a brand-new Nimbus 2001 to which Lance screamed at and hugged his dad tightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After dinner once it gets late, the McClains say goodbye to the Garetts and everyone heads to bed. Lance walks to his room and sees Red curled up in a ball on Lance’s bed. He smiles at her and spots the Hogsmeade slip on his desk which had already been signed by Luis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance falls asleep that night with a big smile on his face.</span>
