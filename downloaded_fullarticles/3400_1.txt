    <p>The sound of the screams echoed in her head.<br/>
She felt sick to her stomach. How could this happen?<br/>
13 bodies lied in front of her.<br/>
She almost didn’t notice when the Auror’s arrived, wands ready to take her down, the small, terrified house elf accompanying them, pointing at her.<br/>
Merula felt as if everything had ended for her, once again.</p>
<p>WIZARDING TURNABOUT</p>
<p>OCTOBER 9, 8:00 AM</p>
<p>KHANNA RESIDENCE</p>
<p>“WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP” My wand kept screaming, flashing a light on my face and poking my ribs, forcing me to open my eyes. “Ugh, I really need to learn how to wake up in the morning.”</p>
<p>My name is Anon Ymous, attorney at law. It had always been my dream to become an attorney, even before I discovered that I was a wizard. My father, a muggle defense attorney, was a great source of inspiration while I grew up. I always admired the old coot, even if his methods of dealing with the law and his opponents where kind of “unorthodox” to say the least (the duck and the boot cases still come to mind every time I think about him).</p>
<p>I already successfully dealt with two cases so far, starting my career in a pretty decent way, if I do say so myself. Busting my ass at N.E.W.T.s and that damn magical law proficiency test had to serve to something.</p>
<p>I quickly get up, putting on my already trademarked blue-striped suit, just a little reminder of my time at Ravenclaw, and moved to the kitchen, where I find my best friend already making breakfast.</p>
<p>“Hey sleepy head, good morning” Says Rowan, flipping pancakes with the precision of a master duelist launching spells at an unfortunate target.</p>
<p>Holding back a yawn, I sit at the table and pick the morning newspaper, the front page flashing pictures of a quite gruesome case that apparently happened yesterday ‘THIRTEEN DEAD AT THE MURK RESIDENCE, DARK WIZARD SUSPECTED’.</p>
<p>“Morning Khanna, where’s Penny?”</p>
<p>“Oh she, had to go to work already, said she had to deal with some nasty enchanted toilet seat or something” Rowan began serving some pancakes on my plate, and quickly took a seat in front of me.</p>
<p>“Being a stay-at-home-daddy must be hard work, eh man?”</p>
<p>“Hey, I can managed, at least I have my own home already, ye bloody leech” Said him with a shit eating grim, sipping his coffee.</p>
<p>I’ve been staying at Rowan’s home for a while now, after my last case made me a prime target for a gang of leprechauns that really, really wanted to put my head on a spike, so it was safer to stay away from my old apartment. But hey, getting some good homemade food and clean bed sheets was a nice change of pace, really.</p>
<p>“Hey, you know that aint my fault, right? And besides, your home was bought by your wife, so you’re as much of a leech as me.” I begin to eagerly eat my serving of pancakes. Goddamn that stupid Indian can cook.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but we still make more money than you, so its even.”</p>
<p>“No need to poke me where it hurts dude.” Rowan lets out a slight chuckle, almost chocking in his own serving of pancakes.</p>
<p>After eating, Rowan rose up from his seat. “Anyway man, I gotta wake Hazel up, if I let her oversleep again Penny’s gonna kill me.” The ever so worried father quickly walked towards his daughter’s bedroom. Its still pretty hard to accept that that studious bookworm not only managed to date one of the prettiest girls in Hogwarts history, but ended up marrying her shortly after graduation and got a lil daughter to boot.</p>
<p>While eating my breakfast, I notice a small bang sound repeatedly at the window. Taking a glance, I see its an old black owl, carrying a letter on its left leg. “Oh Turles, why do you do this every time.” I open the window, letting the animal inside, ruffling its feathers and desperately going towards my food, gorging in pancakes.</p>
<p>“Why did I ever buy you, really” Using the moment of distraction, I take the letter addressed to me. “Oh, its from the Wizengamot, maybe its something about my next case.</p>
<p>Opening the letter, I start to read it. It was indeed about my next case. As I was reading it, I felt the color coming out of my face, my eyes darting around the letter, incredulous of its contents. I quickly take a seat, ignoring the happy chirps of my owl while I reread it repeatedly.</p>
<p>After my fifth reread, Rowan entered the kitchen again, accompanied by his petite daughter. At 7 years old, Hazel Khanna was a weird, but quite adorable mix of both Penny’s and Rowan’s features. Her dark gold hair, that was waist length, was unruly and chaotic early in the morning, her blue eyes looking tired after being awake. Scrubbing her eyes with her small hands, she started to move towards the table. “Morning, Uncle Ymmy” She said, as she sat on her elevated seat.</p>
<p>“Hey man, you look like you saw a ghost, what happened?” Rowan quickly approached a worried look on his eyes.</p>
<p>“Welp, I might as well, have, really.” I give him the letter, and as he read it, his expression started to match mine.</p>
<p>“Whats wrong daddy?” Said Hazel, between some decisive bites on a few pancakes.</p>
<p>“Nothing, dear, its adults stuff. Finish your pancakes, alright? Dad and uncle Ymous have to talk for a bit.” I start to follow a clearly worried Rowan, while a still groggy Hazel played with Turles between bites.</p>
<p>Sitting on the couch, Rowan started to read the letter out loud, as if he was trying to make it seem less surreal.</p>
<p>MISTER YMOUS</p>
<p>We from the Wizengamot hereby convoke you to preside as the defense attorney on the court session number 993598, Merula Snyde V. The Wizarding Community, to be held at the Tenth of October, 1999, at 10 AM.<br/>
We believe that choosing you as a member of the defense team will help to bring closure to the matters at hand, as the defendant is believed to be an old acquaintance of yours.<br/>
As the time for the trial is nigh, we recommend that you quickly go talk to your client, currently being held at the precinct of the Department Magical Law Enforcement.<br/>
For more information, talk to Detective Olivia Gumshoe.</p>
<p>May justice prevail,<br/>
Elphias Doge, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot</p>
<p>“Good Merlin, its Merula” Rowan said, his mouth agape.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I really cant believe it! They found her!” I said, a smile forming on my face.</p>
<p>Merula Snyde. Calling her a simple “acquaintance” was quite off the mark, really. The self declared “Greatest witch that ever attended Hogwarts” was a continuous pain in the butt for most of my school life. Most, because as we both grew older, our feelings of mutual hate became something more, culminating in both of us finally dating at the end of our fifth year. As time passed, everything indicated that we would find happiness on each other well after we ended our studies, but one day, right before our graduation, she simply vanished. I went to look after her right after I got out of school using all of my resources, traveling across all of England and beyond to see if I could find her again, to no avail.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but… she’s being held in a trial, this cant be good, really.”</p>
<p>“I know, but its Merula! Just the fact that shes alive, and that I can talk to her makes me happy man, really.”</p>
<p>“I really cant believe that you’re still in love with her, after all this time.” Rowan looks at me with with worried eyes, but I ignore him, as I was feeling legitimately happy.</p>
<p>“I sure am, shes the love of my life after all.”</p>
<p>Rowan sighs heavily, placing his hand on my shoulder. “Look, I know you’ve been looking for her for a long ass time, but really, did you ever thought about why she ended up disappearing? Especially since right after she went away we started to hear reports of attacks against muggles and what not? And with You-Know-Who coming back, and all that, it makes everything even more disturbing. Not to mention that case yesterday…”</p>
<p>“Sheesh man, calm down” I say, looking at him directly on his eyes. “I trust Merula, really. I know that even if she ended up on Lordy Moldy-Butt’s side she wouldn’t hurt a soul, shes not that kind of girl.”</p>
<p>“You say that, but she assaulted you so many times at school that Madam Pomfrey started calling you ‘The Snap-Man’ since you broke your arms like, 20 times in one year.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know, but this is different! This is a chance to finally learn the truth about what happened, so I cant let this pass.”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright, I know that nothing that I say can make you change your mind, especially since these are orders from the Wizen’ itself. I just want to make sure that you don’t end up getting hurt after all of this ends.”</p>
<p>“I know, and I appreciate that man, but”- I get up and start to walk towards the front door-“ I have to set this straight” I look at him with fire in my eyes, ready to finally meet Merula again.</p>
<p>“Heh, you never change really.” Rowan got up and gave me a quick friendly punch on my shoulder. “Well, im going to look after Hazel for now, if anything happens you let me know, alright?”  </p>
<p>“Sure, I promise.” I open the door and start to walk away from the Khanna residence, thinking about Merula, my chest tightening. “Time to pay Clumsy a visit.”</p>
<p>OCTOBER 9, 9:07 AM<br/>
MINISTRY OF MAGIC</p>
<p>“Merlin’s trousers, if I have to pass over one more freaking magical detector im going to lose my mind!” I say, as I walk inside of the Ministry. Ever since You-Know-Who was defeated, a lot of changes started to be made on how the Ministry worked. Dozens of new defense mechanisms and extra personnel where put in charge, especially since the hunt for rogue Death Eaters was still in progression.</p>
<p>After finally getting past another quite annoying ‘DE Hunt-a-thon 3000’ I finally start to approach the elevators that would take me to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, but im stopped by a heavy hand on my shoulder. “Ey, im in kinda of a hurry man, cant talk rig- Oh Hey Barnaby!”</p>
<p>“Yo, Ymous, how ya doing” The muscle head said. Barnaby is a good friend from my Hogwarts years, having helped me crackle a lot of problems while I was in school. While he was already huge as a teenager, he only became larger as the years passed, with him now standing at almost 7 feet tall, coupled with the hugest muscles I ever saw in a wizard. It was only natural for him to be hired as a security guard in the ministry.</p>
<p>“Im fine man, im fine. Got a few good and bad news today, and a new case to booth.” I say as i enter the elevator with Barnaby and push the button.</p>
<p>“Its not about leprechauns again, right? Last time one of those buggers kept on following me for almost a week, screaming things like ‘shekels’ and what not”</p>
<p>“Nah, relax, its nothing like that this time. Its about Merula” With a cheeky grim, I look at Barnaby’s shocked expression.</p>
<p>“You mean they found her?! Since when dude?!”</p>
<p>“I dunno, really, im heading for the department to figure this out right now.”</p>
<p>As the elevator stops, a happy voice echoes across the speakers “Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Wizengamot court, Precinct and Auror’s Office”</p>
<p>As we both get out of the elevator, a radiant Barnaby accompanied me towards the precinct, passing through the cubicles where dozens of diligent law workers went through their day.</p>
<p>“Ha, that sure is good news my man.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but im still a bit worried, shes being held in trial tomorrow. I sure hope that I can help her about this.”</p>
<p>“Hey man, you’re the best attorney that ever appeared on this place. You’ll get your girl scott free, im sure of that!”</p>
<p>As I was saying thanks to him for the compliment, a little paper plane started to darts towards Barnaby, hitting him right on his forehead. “Ouch, whats is this?” As he picked it up, the plane started to open itself, revealing to be a howler, that screamed with an ever so familiar voice. “BARNABY LEE, GET YOUR ASS IN YOU POST RIGHT.NOW. IF I CAUGH YOU SLOUCHING OR GOING CHIT-CHATTY AGAIN IM GOING TO MAKE YOU SCRUB ALL OF THE TOILETS IN THE ENTIRETY OF THE MINISTRY” As the howler started screaming, all of the people in the cubicles started looking, but when they noticed that it was about Barnaby they quickly lost interest, as if it was a common occurrence.</p>
<p>Putting his right hand on the back of his head, Barnaby looked at me in an apologetic manner. “Sorry ya had to see that, my boss is on my ass all the time.”</p>
<p>“Dont worry, but you better get back on your post ASAP dude, I don’t want to see Felix mad at you again.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, im going then, smell ya later Ymous! And say to Merula that I said hi!” The big guy started to run towards the elevators again.</p>
<p>As I approach the door to the precinct, I feel my stomach churn in anticipation. Its been a while that I’ve felt so nervous, but I steeled myself and opened the door.</p>
<p>OCTOBER 9, 9:28 AM<br/>
PRECINCT</p>
<p>Two steps inside the precinct, and I already hear the distinctive sound of someone tripping over something. “God dammit, not again!” I approach the source of the sound, to see one old friend on the floor, having somehow managed to drop a step ladder on top of herself (where did she even find one?).</p>
<p>Olivia Gumshoe, noticing my getting near her, quickly get up, giving me her best ‘whooopsie’ smile.</p>
<p>“Still the same as always, eh Clumsy?”</p>
<p>“Heh heh, you know how I am Anon” She says, rubbing the back of her head with an apologetic smile.</p>
<p>Olivia, or Clumsy, as everyone calls her, completely deserves that nickname. Ever since we were kids she managed to get herself in all kinds of different predicaments, like falling down stairs, dropping dangerous potions on the ground, even making a few professors stay in the care of Madam Pomfrey for a while (poor Snape, may he rest in heaven). How in the hell she ended up landing a job as a detective for the ministry totally failed me, but oh well, im not the one in charge of hiring people here.</p>
<p>“So Anon, what do you need? Im kinda busy today.”</p>
<p>“Oh, its nothing, I got a letter from the ministry today and I kinda need to talk to someone on the precinct today, you know?”</p>
<p>“Oooh, a new case? Who’s the detective in charge?”</p>
<p>“Its you, Clumsy” “Wait, what, I don’t remember being in charge of any ne- OOOH yeah the Murk case!”</p>
<p>“Yep, and I need to talk to the suspect, they put me as her defense attorney for her trial tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Clumsy furrows her brow in a quizzical manner. “They are already holding a trial? That’s kinda quick, eh pal.”</p>
<p>“That’s how the ministry works I guess.”</p>
<p>“No need to beat around the bush then, best we get you and her talking. But im going to warn ya, she seems, a little ‘different’ than the last time”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ll manage.”</p>
<p>“If you say so, to the visitors area we go then!” She say cheerfully, and just like that, Clumsy starts to walk, guiding me to the visitors area.</p>
<p>“Wait, wrong way.” She turns around and steps on my feet, twice, quickly regaining her pace while she apologizes to me. She truly never changes.</p>
<p>OCTOBER 9, 9:34 AM<br/>
PRECINCT, VISITOR’S AREA</p>
<p>I sit quietly, waiting for her to arrive. I feel the nervousness building inside of me. Its been what, 8 years ever since I saw her last time? The last thing that I recall is her saying that she loved me the night before she went away. These memories still hurt, beyond what I could describe.</p>
<p>Before I could decide on what to say, I hear the door beyond the glass protection in front of me opening. Raising my head, I see a guard motioning someone to enter the room. As she finally enters, I take a few seconds to ingrain her appearance on my mind.</p>
<p>She looked almost the same as she was 8 years ago. Her hair was longer, going beyond the shoulders, but her distinctive patch of golden hair was still plastered on top of her head. She looked thin, weak, her pace a little discomposed. But something seemed different. Her purple eyes, the same ones that looked at me so tenderly before, where now bloodshot, looking at me with anger, and her beautiful features where twisted in a scornful smile, her small button nose perking up in disgust and bravado.</p>
<p>“Long time no see, Ymous.” She said, as she sat down on the opposite end.</p>
<p>“Merula, you… seem different.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, my dear little Ymous, im the same girl as aways!” She says, giggling to herself.</p>
<p>Her mannerisms have changed quite a lot in these recent years. She always had that aura of supposed superiority, but never of utter disgust over the people near her. And any kind of warmth that she had on her voice seemed to have disappeared as well.</p>
<p>“Perhaps you want a little smooch of something, to remember the old times, eh?” Making a kissing face, she looks at me in a manner that begged everything, minus a kiss.</p>
<p>“Well, I missed you, really. What happened to you? What did you do to get here? Tell me, please.”</p>
<p>She snorts once, and looks at her now broken nails. “Oh, you know, simple girly stuff, went to travel a lil bit, joined the death eaters, beat the shit out of a lot of people, you know, simple.stuff.” She emphasizes the last two words, as if everything that she just said was something that she did on a Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>“But this time, oooh this time it was fun my little Ymous! It was delightful to see those little weepy mudbloods dying in front of me! It was so much fun you know? Great, great fun! Haha!” She spins on her seat, a look of bliss on her face.</p>
<p>“You killed those people then. Why?”</p>
<p>“oh, why, my dear? You ask WHY? They were mudbloods of course, do I even need any other reason?”</p>
<p>“Huh, I guess not eh? So you became a pure blood supremacist after all this time. Well, no matter. I came here to, besides seeing you, to inform that I am now you lawyer. Your case will be tomorrow morning and I will be defending you.”</p>
<p>“Ha, good luck at that, Ymous.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry Merula, im going to free you, and im going to find the truth about this case.” I say, getting up, a look of determination on my eyes.</p>
<p>“We’ll see about that.” She says, getting up as well, her scornful smile changing in a serious, violent face.</p>
<p>As I make my leave, Clumsy was waiting for me in anticipation. “So, how was it pal?”</p>
<p>“Well, I got a few things about the case already, but im going to need your help, Clumsy.”</p>
<p>“My help? Really? Well, what do you need, im all ears.”</p>
<p>“Im going to need the autopsy report for the victims, and I need access to the crime scene.”</p>
<p>“Oh boy, this is gonna be kinda hard, but I will see what I can do. But why, did she say something weird?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she did. But im certain of one little thing.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“That woman, she surely isn’t Merula.”</p>
<p>OCTOBER 9, 9:50 AM<br/>
MURK RESIDENCE</p>
<p>The landing was easy, I ended up falling on top of a soft patch of grass. The problem was the slightly heavy clumsy witch on top of me. “Ugh, I really, really hate portkeys.” Tossing the old boot aside, Clumsy quickly gets up.</p>
<p>“Tell me about it, and hey, shouldn’t you stop with the donuts? You getting a little on the heavy side of the spectrum, you know.” I say to her, getting up as well.</p>
<p>As red as a tomato, Clumsy puffs her cheeks. “Hey pal, I don’t tell ya how to live your life!” She starts walking away from me, stomping her feet, almost falling by stepping on her oversized coat. Its always fun to tease her.</p>
<p>I quickly get near her, looking on my surrounding’s. We are near an large state on top of a steep hill, the color green plastered all over the place. When we get near the entrance, we see the name on top of the gate ‘MURK STATE’.</p>
<p>“Never thought Ismelda would have such a large mansion.”</p>
<p>“I know right.” And with that, Clumsy pushes the gate open, and we enter the old mansion.</p>
<p>As we walked by, I noticed the various members of the police force running around, talking with the employees of the mansion.</p>
<p>“Hey, you still didn’t explain to me what you meant about that.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“You know pal, about the Merula that we captured, that she isn’t the real one and what not.”</p>
<p>“Oho, don’t worry, you’re gonna get it soon enough.” Looking at her with a small smile, Clumsy raises her eyebrow in confusion.</p>
<p>“And by soon I believe it’s the trial.”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>“Sigh, alright, alright, I cant really get what’s on your mind anyway. Im going to talk to a few of my men, just do your thingy and I will get your autopsies reports and what not.” Clumsy then goes inside the mansion, but not before she manages to fall on top of a poor house elf that was running around. I hear a muffled ‘goddamit’ in Clumsy’s voice.</p>
<p>Helping the poor creature get up, I notice how much he/she was shaking. I can never tell which ones are male or female, but no matter.</p>
<p>“Hey little buddy, you alright?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes master, pardon Screech’s clumsiness, Screech shouldn’t make an honorable wizard like you w-worry about a thing like her!” Her voice was cracky, like a literal screech, guess that’s how she got that name. She starts apologizing and weeping, holding her small hands on top of her eyes.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, calm down. Its no biggie, really. Say, can I talk to you for a sec, Screech was it?”</p>
<p>Her eyes get slightly bigger (if that is even possible) when she looks at me. “O-of course, it’s a pleasure to talk to such an honorable wizard like you!”</p>
<p>“Alrighty then, do you work here Screech?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do, I serve the honorable M-Murk family, sir. Lady I-I-Ismelda and her husband Sir Avery.”</p>
<p>“Good, then you can answer a few of my questions.” Putting the thought that Ismelda actually married on the back of my head (I don’t keep contact with that thing, really) I clear my mind and start to talk.</p>
<p>“Do you know what happened here?”</p>
<p>The question makes her flinch a little, her eyes darting around. “Y-yes, I do. A-a few days ago, this h-honorable guest came to visit us, she stayed for a while in my mistress company. B-b-b-b-but one day, she- ARGH DON’T.TALK.ABOUT.IT.DONT.TALK.ABOUT.IT.” She drops on all fours and starts to bang her head against the pavement.</p>
<p>Picking her up before she breaks her head, I notice that she is clenching her fists. Something is clearly wrong. “Ok, calm down, calm down. I know about most of what happened, I just wanna ask you if you know about anything that I don’t.”</p>
<p>Calming herself a little, she rubs her forehead. “I d-don’t know sir, my mistress said that I shouldn’t say m-much to outsiders, I cant tarnish the h-h-honorable name of the Murk family!”</p>
<p>This sure feels hopeless, I think but I cant help but feel that this little thing knows about something important. “Well, can you at least tell me about you? Do you like working here, Screech?”</p>
<p>“I-I do… I feel proud of my work, and lady I-Ismelda treats me well….” Ismelda, treating someone well, now thats a surprise.</p>
<p>“She must have changed ever since I went to Hogwarts with her then, she wasn’t really big on the ‘treating well’ business while I was there.”</p>
<p>She looks at me with scared eyes, backing away a little.</p>
<p>“Whats wrong?”</p>
<p>“Y-you know the mistress? Y-You cant be here then! You really need to go away sir!”</p>
<p>“Why, is something the ma-“. Before I can finish, I see the biggest, oldest house elf running towards us.</p>
<p>“OY, SCREECH, WHAT ARE YE DOING ‘ERE, YE SHOULD BE IN THE BLOODY KITCHEN YE STUPID GIT” When the thing approachs, he picks Screech by the neck, lifting her up easily, and gives me a crooked smile.</p>
<p>“ ‘orry ye had to see dat sire, Creep here lost track of time ye see, and the little bugger managed to slip by me old fingers. Off we go now!” And just like that, the both of them went away with a small crack, apparating back towards the place they came.</p>
<p>Well, better talk to Ismelda then.</p>
<p>OCTOBER 9, 10:05 AM<br/>
MURK RESIDENCE, ENTRANCE HALL</p>
<p>The place was tidier than I expected, especially considering that a murder took place in here not long ago. Besides the officers running around (and a few bloodstains and body marks) the entrance hall was quite the typical old wizard home, with a good chunk of talking portraits making a ruckus. Hard to believe that this is Ismelda’s home, I was expecting a lot more skulls and corpses hanging around. Weirdly there's no clear signs of struggle as well.</p>
<p>Clumsy notices me, and then waves to get me close to her. Besides her was a meek looking officer of the department, carrying a good amount of papers and fliers.</p>
<p>“Hey pal, got ya reports here.” She says, picking a small amount of fliers from the top o the pile. Poor guy, he seems to be close to collapsing from the weight.</p>
<p>“Thank you Meekins, you can go now.” She says to the scrawny guy. “S-SIR YES SIR, IM GOING NOW DETECTIVE GUMSHOE SIR.” He almost trips on himself trying to salute, and then stumbles away.</p>
<p>“I swear, that guy is almost as clumsy as I am.”</p>
<p>I flip through the fliers. All of them show the same cause for death: blood loss and severe injury. The photos weren’t pretty to look at, each of the corpses looked more beaten and mauled than the other.</p>
<p>“Damn, that’s quite the gruesome way to die, kinda hard to believe that someone managed to do this to a bunch of wizards.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and all of them were muggle borns too, with no correlation to each other, you see.” She points to the names, Walker, Suomy, all of them from different parts of England, there was even a brazillian dude in the middle of it.</p>
<p>“Do we even know what spell was used to make this much damage?”</p>
<p>“Sadly no, we didn’t manage to find her wand.”</p>
<p>“Huh, interesting. Well, im going to do a little digging myself, thank you for the help Clumsy.”</p>
<p>“No problemo pal, when ya need to get back just tell me, I got another portkey ready for us both.” She says, taking a coin from her pocket. Ugh, I hate portkeys.</p>
<p>Excusing myself, I pick up my wand and start flicking it, chanting a few detection charms. No luck. It seems that no spell was used in here, besides the ones used by the department to preserve the scene. Huh, no wand and no spells, probably something else was used as the weapon for the crime. But what could make so much damage?</p>
<p>Not convinced, I flick my wand again, trying to catch anything, even a glimpse of magic that could have been used in here. After a solid minute of tinkering, I feel a small, faint chink of magic. “Its seems someone used the eradication spell, hah!” A coy smile forms on my face. Someone tried to hide the traces of magic used in here, but made a sloppy job to hide the charm used to do so! That’s great evidence.</p>
<p>Moving along, I decide to check the upper floor now, to see if I can find Ismelda or her husband, Avery.</p>
<p>OCTOBER 9, 10:22 AM<br/>
MURK RESIDENCE, UPPER FLOOR</p>
<p>Going up, I arrive at an rather luxurious looking dining hall, with a long table in the middle of it. Sitting on eat, enjoying what seemed to be a normal breakfast, was a rather nice looking man, with a long mustache and a pale complexion, with a gentle smile on his face as he was eating his serving of fruit. Besides him was… Ismelda, probably the last person I wanted to see in the world, if not for the circumstances.</p>
<p>She was wearing a simple green dress. She still had her weird man-jaw, but besides that she almost seemed pretty. Her eyes were lacking her old, usual hate filled gaze, being replaced by a gentle, calm look. When she noticed me, she waved, a small smile on her face. She took me by the hand to greet me.</p>
<p>“Hello Ymous! Its been a while, hasn’t it? What do I owe you the pleasure?” Her smile is more gentle than I remembered.</p>
<p>“Oh, eh, hey Ismelda. Well, Im here In official business, actually.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see. Well, care to join us for our meal? Ah, and what are my manners, this is my husband! Say hello to him, Avery!” She gestures to the older man, who quickly gets up.</p>
<p>He takes my hand on his and shakes it firmly. “Hello there, my friend. The names Avery, previously Niceman but now a proud Murk! And what is yours?”</p>
<p>“Its Ymous, Anon Ymous.”</p>
<p>“Oho, my dear Ismelda told me about you, sir Ymous. A good friend from her school years I see.”</p>
<p>Good friend? Well, I wouldt put it that way really. She usually tried to kill me, even more than Merula. Either way, I take their offer and take a place across the table, picking a serving of pickled fruit. Cant refuse free food man.</p>
<p>“So, what business do you have at our lovely home?” Ismelda says, gently eating from her plate. Theres really something wrong with her, I can tell.</p>
<p>“Well, im here to see the scene of the crime. I was appointed as the defense attorney for this case, you see. I need to build the case for the suspect.”</p>
<p>Avery looks at me, his warm eyes looking a little bit more stern. “Is that so? Well, im afraid theres not much of a case for you in here, mister Ymous. You could clearly see what that woman did to our home. And to even think that we gave shelter to that Merula!” The mention of “Merula” made Ismelda shiver.</p>
<p>“That’s for me to see Mister Avery, I need to see my job trough, and try to prove the truth if possible.”</p>
<p>“Either way, I’d like to make a few question to you both.”</p>
<p>“Hah, go ahead, but im afraid we don’t have much information that you cant get from your officer friends.”</p>
<p>“Well, where were you both during the night of the crime?”</p>
<p>“We were playing quidditch with a few friend of ours, im afraid. In this case, our alibi is air tight.” Chuckling to himself, Avery picked a little more food from the table.</p>
<p>“I see, and what about that part where you said you gave Merula shelter?” Another shiver from Ismelda.</p>
<p>“That woman arrived a few day ago, saying that she was an old friend of my wife. We gave her a place to stay and warm food, but the second we leave her alone she does such a… such a horrible thing to our house!”</p>
<p>“Interesting, did she ever tell you both were she came from?”</p>
<p>“She said she was fleeing from something, we didn’t want to pry so we didn’t ask her much.”</p>
<p>“I see, so, can you say to me th-“ Avery raises his right hand, interrupting me. “Im afraid this is enough, kind sir. I will ask you to leave us alone now, we want to enjoy the rest of our meal in peace.”</p>
<p>“Very well then.”</p>
<p>As I was getting up, Ismelda grabs my hand and shakes it again. “It was a pleasure to see you again, Ymous.”</p>
<p>Looking at her eyes, I see a faint glimmer of something that seemed sadness. Before I could ask anything, I feel Avery’s heavy hand on my back, hushing me to go away.</p>
<p>As I went down the stairs, I notice a small piece of paper, folded on my hand. Opening it, theres a single phrase written on it, in a red ink. “HELP ME”</p>
<p>Feeling a tinge of dread, I dart back up, just to see that no one was on the table anymore. Before I leave, I see a single, small bottle on top of the table, on the side that Ismelda was sitting. Picking it up, I notice that theres still a little bit of whatever it contained. I pick the bottle and put it in my pouch, taking my leave.</p>
<p>OCTOBER 9, 10:40 AM<br/>
MURK RESIDENCE, ENTRANCE FLOOR</p>
<p>I look around for Clumsy, ready to talk to her about my worries, but I don’t find her anywhere. I don’t see any of the officers as well. Noticing my confusion, a portrait of a bearded, aged man starts to talk to me. “Your friends are outside already, friend. Orders from the head of the house, ya see.”</p>
<p>"Thank you. I will take my leave then.” Motioning myself towards the exit, the portrait calls me. “Be careful around others, boy! Appearances can be deceiving, especially to wizards!” Laughing heartily, the portrait ignores my barrage of questions, and I promptly exit the mansion.</p>
<p>OCTOBER 9, 10:45 AM<br/>
MURK RESIDENCE</p>
<p>I finally see Clumsy, who was waiting for me down in the hill. It seems all the other officers went home already. When I approach, she looks at me with a curious expression. “What happened, pal? You look pretty bad.”</p>
<p>“Theres something really wrong with this place.”</p>
<p>“No kidding, while we were just minding our business that weird house elf, I think his name is Creeapo or something, appeared and started to scream ‘OY YE GET THE HELL OUTTA MAH MASTERS HOMEY’” Making her best house elf impression, Clumsy starts to laugh, and I (initially reluctantly) join in too.</p>
<p>Our laughter was interrupted when we heard a loud screech, that sounded like a wounded animal. Giving Clumsy a quick glance, I dart to the source of the sound, a small wooden house, hidden at the side of the main mansion.</p>
<p>When we arrive, we see the cause for such a commotion: A large, beautiful Hippogriff, chained to the wall of the house, being beaten by that weird, old house elf.</p>
<p>“YE DO THE THINGIES MASTER WANT YA TO DO PROPERLY, YE STINKY BIRD POO-“ Noticing us, he stops, and quickly apparates away. The proud animal looks at us with sad eyes, motioning us to open his lock. I feel pained to see the animal in that state, but as I move to help it, we hear the distinctive sound of steps, a lot of them to be exact.</p>
<p>Picking my hand, Clumsy looks at me. “We have to get out, I have a bad feeling about this.” She then picks the portkey and I feel the distinctive hook in my belly button, pushing me forward.</p>
<p>OCTOBER 9, 10:53 AM<br/>
PRECINCT</p>
<p>Clumsy once again lands on top of me. “Goddammit Clumsy, this hurts!”</p>
<p>She gets up once again, puffing her cheeks. “What am I supposed to do, I cant help it!”</p>
<p>Straightening my back, I pick the small vial on my pocket and hand it to her.</p>
<p>“Hey, whats this?”</p>
<p>“I found it at the Murks, I feel its important stuff. Can you and your team analyze it for me? I need to know what type of potion this is.” She looks at the pallid liquid.</p>
<p>“Huh, I don’t know what this is, but im sure of one thing, someone mixed the content with a hide-away potion.”</p>
<p>“And whats that?”</p>
<p>“Its quite the convenient little thing, actually, you just mix it with your potion and you change the color, taste and even stickness of the potion. It doesn’t work in all of them though. I’ll have It analyzed ASAP, so don’t worry pal.”</p>
<p>Giving me a thumbs up, Clumsy excuses herself, going inside a door, but not before she said goodbye. “Also, say to Rowan and Penny that I said hi!” Clumsy then falls face flat on the ground again, making poor officer Meekins fall alongside her.</p>
<p>Better go back home now, before she falls on me again.</p>
<p>OCTOBER 9, 12:10 AM<br/>
KHANNA RESIDENCE</p>
<p>When I get home, I’m greeted by a ever so happy Hazel, jumping on my neck and almost making me fall on my ass. “Uncle Ymmy! You’re finally home!” She snuggles on my chest, smiling happily, her hair braided on two long braids, like her mother used to wear. Rowan appears, picking Hazel up (much to her protests).</p>
<p>“So hey, how was it man?”</p>
<p>“Sigh, stressing, difficult, and kinda weird, actually.”</p>
<p>“Really? Well, do you even have a case then?” He looks at me, and I give him my best smirk, the one reserved to the times we both made some remarkable scheme when we were at our old school.</p>
<p>“I sure do buddy.”</p>
<p>As we were both chatting, we hear the door opening, just to see miss Khanna (neé Haywood) entering. Sporting her hair in a simple, bob cut that screamed “MOM”, Penny was still a beauty, even after giving birth. Rowan sure is a lucky bastard.</p>
<p>“Mommy!” Hazel gives Penny of on her characteristic neck breaker hug, the young mother looking quite tired.</p>
<p>“Hey, sweetie, how are you?” Rowan goes towards them both, picking the groceries and putting them on the table.</p>
<p>“Tough day, Penny?” I ask her, motioning her to sit down.</p>
<p>“Yep, 5 jinxed toilets, 8 muggles soaked. I swear in the name of Merlins beard, if I catch the guy that did this im going to strangle him by his- hair” Noticing Hazel, Penny quickly watches her language. Cant have the child cursing as much as the mother now.</p>
<p>“Anyway, what about you, did you do anything interesting?”</p>
<p>I tell her about everything that happened so far, about the latter, Merula, the Murks, and the poor Hippogriff. When I end, she looks at me, mesmerized.</p>
<p>“Wow, you sure had an way more interesting day than I did.” We small talk for a bit, Rowan bringing us a bit of his homemade cooking, and soon Penny goes back to her job, giving both Hazel and Rowan a small peck on the cheek.</p>
<p>“Well, im going to write a few things down now. I need to prepare for the big day tomorrow.” As I get up, Hazel tucks on my leg, with pleading eyes.</p>
<p>“Uncle Ymmy, you wont play with me?” She looks like shes ready to cry.</p>
<p>With a look of exasperation, Rowan just shrugs at me. “You gotta do your part too, Uncle Ymmy.”</p>
<p>Sighing, I sit down with a now joyful Hazel, feeling like im as much of a parent to her as Rowan and Penny are.</p>
