    <p>The sittingroom of Number 12 Grimmauld Place was oddly quiet as Sirius, Harry and Alessa sat, all glancing at the fireplace every few seconds. The only sound to be heard was Kreachers footsteps coming from the kitchen, and the sound of the boiling teapot.</p><p>Soon enough, exactly at a quarter to four, the fireplace roared with emerald flames, and from them stepped out Narcissa and Draco Malfoy. It was the second week of the holidays and the Malfoys were coming for afternoon tea for the first time. Though Narcissa and Sirius had been rather civil in their previous meetings, everyone felt that this was the true test of wheter the two families could learn to get along.</p><p>"Good afternoon" Narcissa greeted them with an elegant smile. <br/>
"Hi!" Draco gave them an awkward wave. He was the most anxious of all about this meeting. Greetings were exchanged as the Malfoy's sat down on the armchairs Sirius motioned them to. <br/>
"Would you like some tea, Narcissa?" Sirius asked- rather unnecessarily as they were here for, <em>well</em>, tea.<br/>
"That would be lovely, Sirius"<br/>
Thus, Kreacher was summoned from the kitchen and came with a tray full of steaming tea and freshly baked pastries. The elf was now in much better shape. His clothes, and his self, was clean and he wore a smile as he served them their tea. <br/>
As he left, Narcissa looked around. <br/>
"I haven't been here in ages, but I must say, it's looking a lot brighter than I remember it."<br/>
"Yeah" Sirius chuckled lightly "I changed the drapes."<br/>
"Did you manage to get rid of those posters in your room?" Narcissa asked, teasingly. "They're not very age appropiate now, are they?"<br/>
This time, Alessa and Harry were the ones to laugh- Draco looked puzzled. <br/>
"I'm afraid I did too good a job sticking them on in the first place." Sirius' eyes twinkled "How mad was mother?"<br/>
"Excessively." Narcissa simply replied, but she was grinning as well. It was strange, seeing such an unladylike expression on her face after her presentable image in public.<br/>
"Are you really... cousins?" Harry let out "Not to be rude, but I don't really see it."<br/>
Narcissa shook her head. <br/>
"Our families got along well, and we had a common ancestor generations ago, so we were raised as such, but that was only because they wanted to emphasize their connections to other 'respectable' families. Truthfully, we're so many generations apart that I doubt we share any more genes than most pureblood families always do." Narcissa explained.<br/>
"Actually, they apparently hoped you would get married to me or one of my sist- "<br/>
"WHAT?!" shouted Draco and Sirius simulteniously.<br/>
"Yes," Narcissa Malfoy chuckled again. "Then they realised Sirius was... not an ideal fit. My mother told me all about it a while before she passed. Highly disturbing news."</p><p>After this conversation, the tenseness of the room was relieved. Narcissa had clearly shown that she was willing to 'let down her hair', if you will. She and Sirius got to talking about the old days and what had become of everyone in the past 13 years. Seeing this, Alessa figured it was alright to leave them alone. She took her tea and a plate full of pastries and mimed Harry and Draco to follow her. She took them up to her room in the attic. Sirius and Remus had managed to widen the small window for her, and add another one to the roof- a skylight. The room was decorated with rustic furniture made of dark wood. One side of the room was devoted to her magic ingredients: crystals, potions ingredients, candles, herbs and much more were both stuffed in a large dresser, and splayed out on top of it.<br/>
"Nice room" Draco remarked as Alessa carried the emerald armchair next to the bed and sat down, indicating the boys to sit on the bed.</p><p>Draco's summer wasn't going as bad as he'd thought. He explained that his father mostly ignored him, and usually worked late or visited someone after work. He had the distinct impression that his mother wasn't on good terms with the man, and though Lucius looked more scary from the outside, the actual head of the Malfoy Household was Narcissa.<br/>
"I think it's because of something he said about me." Draco explained "Mom once hinted at something of the sort during dinner."<br/>
Then, it was Harry and Alessa's turn to tell Draco about life at Grimmauld Place. <br/>
"Lupin moved in with you?!" The blonde asked in surprise.<br/>
"Yeah, dad convinced him that Remus owed it to him to help him readjust." Alessa supplied. "Apparently no DADA Professor managed to last nore than a year since the 40s, so Lupin didn't want to stay in school and risk it anyway."<br/>
An hour or so later, Kreacher knocked on the door and informed them that the adults had asked for them.</p><p>"Why didn't anyone tell me that the Quidditch World Cup Finals were in Britain this year?" Sirius asked, excited. He <em>would</em> have known, if only he'd bothered to take one look at the newspapers Remus had been buying.</p><p>"I didn't know" Harry said while raising his hands defensively.<br/>
"I don't care" Alessa said truthfully, and cheekily grinned at her father who grunted.<br/>
"Well, you should. We're invited." Sirius said, obviously conflicted.<br/>
"By whom?" Harry asked.<br/>
"The Minister of Magic. He feels that <em>'the Ministery owes us a lifetime of apologies, and wishes us to accept his offer to accompany him on the top box of the match, as dear guests of the ministry'</em>." Sirius crinkled his nose. "12 years of Azkaban, and he's trying to apologise via <strong>sports tickets</strong>. Nevertheless, I want to go" <br/>
"And we'll be there too." Narcissa added. </p><p>That night, Harry received an owl from Ron, again inviting him and Alessa to the match. He quickly wrote back that they'd already be there, and apparently so would Draco. He was filled with excitement. <em>The Quidditch World Cup</em>. He wondered about witches and wizards from other countries. He'd never given a lot of thought to them, even though his adoptive sister was an American, descendant from Greeks. Were there other schools like Hogwarts? There must be. But then, if there were schools of witchcraft and wizardry in say, the US, why hadn't Alessa attended one? Perhaps her grandfather found it silly to send her to a school when he clearly thought her faster and better? Alessa could do magic the likes of which Harry had never seen before, even from older witches and wizards. She knew about things that he doubted professors knew. Like that locating spell she'd done last year to find Pettigrew. It was so... simple, yet so foreign. He really should ask her to teach him a little about these types of magic. <br/>
He shook his head upon hearing Alessa's tremendous yell.<br/>
"<strong>HARRY! DINNER!!!</strong>"</p><p>"You could just go up a few stairs you know" he said as he came down. <br/>
"Yes, but I don't have to and thus, won't" she grinned. "Now come on, we're all starving"</p><p>As they scarfed down Kreacher's wonderful chicken and potatoes, Sirius filled Remus in about the events of the day.<br/>
"Can you imagine, Narcissa Malfoy has a sense of humor! But more importantly, I got a letter form the Minister. He's invited me and my family to the Quidditch World Cup finale to apoligise for my 12 years in Azkaban. No arguing, because I already sent the letter to reserve four seats." He looked at his friend triumphantly.<br/>
"Four seats?" Remus said "Oh! Thanks Sirius but you really didnt have-"<br/>
"I said no arguing. If you don't go, a seat at the top box will be empty. Now, that's just a waste" the two men grinned at each other as if they were still mischevious schoolchildren, as they so often did without a proper reason. <br/>
"Oh, the Weasleys will be there too" Harry added. "Ron just sent a letter inviting us. Strange coincidence, huh?"</p><p>The time untill the match went by quite fast. Draco stopped by a few times, and was again accompanied by Narcissa once. Alessa wrote to Daphne and Blaise to find out that they were also coming, but didn't have quite as good seats. Neville and Luna were not coming. Neville sounded rather depressed about this, but while Alessa hadn't heard from Luna, she doubted the blonde was upset. She was out on some adventure with her dad, which was why the group had pushed their meeting in Diagon Alley to a few days after the match in the first place. Still, that was almost all of them in the same place- which excited Alessa. She'd missed her friends, and would see them soon. She'd attend the finale of the Quidditch World Cup, and maybe finally get why people found the game so wonderduf- the games at school hadn't really impressed her. Everything appeared to be set.</p><p>What could go wrong?</p>
