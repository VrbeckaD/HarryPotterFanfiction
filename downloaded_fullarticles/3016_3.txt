    <p class="p1">With dinner finished and music playing, the head table seemed to empty rapidly. Harry and Ginny were making their rounds and even Neville had gone off, talking to Hannah Abbott it seemed in a corner by the bar. Aware of Ron’s eyes on her, Hermione had turned to say something to Luna only to find her missing as well, across the dance floor entertaining a young group of children with a peculiar dance. </p><p class="p1">The chair beside her moved, and when she turned around Ron was sitting in Ginny’s empty seat. She’d managed thus far to avoid him for the weekend, shielding herself by talking to Luna or Neville and making a point to sit as far away from him as possible except when their best man and maid of honor duties demanded they be close to one another. Their conversations had been civil and short though she stammered like an idiot whenever he was around. It seemed Ron didn’t fancy starting rumors either.</p><p class="p1">“That bloke over there keeps looking over,” he whispered in her ear, making a motion to his eyes to a rather unruly looking man who was indeed trying to make eye contact with Hermione.</p><p class="p1">“Right,” Hermione said, feeling quite nervous as he made eye contact and seemed to see it as an invitation to come over. Rapidly Hermione stood. “Quick,” she hissed, grabbing Ron’s hand. “Dance with me.”</p><p class="p1">Ron didn’t need another invitation. He stood, taking her hand in his, leading her over to the group of witches and wizards who were swaying to some orchestral tune which seemed much too old for Harry or Ginny’s tastes. Easily he led her into a slow step, turning her away from the wizard who, after a moment, frowned and wandered off.</p><p class="p1">“He’s lost attention,” Hermione whispered once certain that he was gone. Ron didn’t say anything, continuing to lead her in a small step.</p><p class="p1">“Victor Krum is trying to catch your eye now,” he answered and with a blush, Hermione hid her face in his chest. Ron chuckled, pulling her closer. For perhaps another minute they swayed on the spot until Ron nodded. “He’s gone then.”</p><p class="p1">“Thanks,” Hermione answered, pulling away from him.</p><p class="p1">“Oh come on,” Ron said, looking rather disappointed at her. “It’s just a dance.”</p><p class="p1">“I didn’t know if-“ Hermione started and then faltered into a smile, putting her hands properly in his.</p><p class="p1">Their eyes locked. It was the first time since she’d been back that she could remember properly looking at him. Though only a year and a half had passed since she’d graduated from Hogwarts, he seemed to have aged a great deal. His hair was neatly kept and short atop his head, and a mature, managed, stubble was on his chin. Realizing not for the first time how attractive he was, Hermione felt a familiar pang of guilt. For a moment she wondered what would have been if she hadn’t left if she had decided to stay and patch things up or even if she hadn’t let him go at all. Would it still be Harry and Ginny’s wedding that they were dancing at? Or would it be their own, Hermione in the white dress and the unfadeable smile on Ron’s face? Would they have even survived this long?</p><p class="p1">“You’re staring,” Ron whispered and Hermione felt her face grow red. “It’s alright, I don’t mind.” He teased.</p><p class="p1">“Stop it,” she said, face breaking into an easy smile. “You look well,” she said after thinking it over for a minute. If she wasn’t mistaken his smile grew wider.</p><p class="p1">“And yourself,” he answered, looking down at her bare shoulders. “Italy seems to suit you quite well.”</p><p class="p1">“I like it there,” she agreed and he spun her around. Hermione felt dizzy when she was back in his arms.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“Why are you so keen on rejecting everyone?” he asked as she moved closer, fending off another man who appeared to be making his way over. Easily Ron wrapped his arm around her for a moment until the bloke stopped to chat with someone. “Not all of them are unattractive.”</p><p class="p1">“Trying to be my wingman?” Hermione teased. Ron’s eyes twinkled for a moment and then the sad look from before was back. “I’m sort of involved with someone back home.”</p><p class="p1">“Oh?” Ron asked, eyebrows raised. “Ginny didn’t mention anything. Why isn’t he here?”</p><p class="p1">“Ginny doesn’t know,” she answered the first and easier statement. The barkeep set their drinks before them on the counter and Ron handed her one, gesturing to an empty table at the back of the tent for them to sit at. “And it’s complicated. Not to mention he doesn’t speak a lick of English.”</p><p class="p1">“No English?” he asked, a clever smile on his face. “Does that mean that you speak Italian?” he seemed rather excited by this revelation and Hermione nodded, blushing for some reason. “Let’s hear it then.”</p><p class="p1">“I’m not fluent or anything,” Hermione told him, her face feeling hot again. “I use English at work mostly.”</p><p class="p1">“You must know enough if you’re dating someone,” he persisted. “Don’t tell me that you don’t talk at all.”</p><p class="p1">“We’re not dating,” she insisted, looking around quickly. “And we do talk.”</p><p class="p1">“I won’t ask about him if you don’t like,” Ron said good-naturedly, lifting his hands away from the table in surrender.</p><p class="p1">“Thank-you,” Hermione said, trying to keep civil. She busied herself with her drink.</p><p class="p1">“Though I still want to hear you speak it,” he whispered.</p><p class="p1">Hermione was aware suddenly that he’d leaned in closer. Without anyone else near them, she was keenly aware of the smell of his cologne. She felt transported back, and dizzy again though they weren’t moving.</p><p class="p1">“Come-on Hermione.” He was only inches from her ear. With a grin, she looked at him.</p><p class="p1">“Ciao, come sei stato?” She said in a quiet voice, checking around to make sure that no one else could hear.</p><p class="p1">His pupils dilated as she spoke, their faces close enough together she could see them widen. The look on his face was familiar and he placed an arm on the back of her chair, the tips of his fingers brushing against her skin.</p><p class="p1">“What did you say?” he asked, in the same quiet tone.</p><p class="p1">“Hello,” she translated, “How have you been?”</p><p class="p1">“Wow,” Ron said in a voice that could easily be mistaken for a moan though her translation wasn’t particularly exciting.</p><p class="p1">Her lips suddenly felt very dry and she licked them, though her mouth felt just as dry. The look in Ron’s eyes was of pure lust and though her drunken haze, though she couldn’t remember getting drunk, she couldn’t think of a single reason why she would push him away. He leaned in closer to her, fingers moving absentmindedly on her skin.</p><p class="p1">“Wanna get out of here?” he whispered in her ear and Hermione nodded quickly.</p><p class="p1">“We’ll have to wait and say goodbye to Harry and Ginny,” Hermione said trying to regain her composure as they stood, though she cared very little for having to walk over to them or do anything but run out of the tent and apparate away with Ron.</p><p class="p1">With a disappointed groan, he nodded. Without Ron so close, Hermione was suddenly aware of how cold it had gotten and shivered as they picked up their glasses and scanned the tent for their friends. Before she could think for another second on it, Ron’s coat was on her shoulders, wrapping her in warmth and surrounding her with his sent.</p><p class="p1">Thankfully, no one seemed to have noticed their private conversation as Ron guided her back to the cluster of people, his hand on the small of her back. Easily they found Harry and Ginny who seemed to have eyes for no one besides one another. They separated when Ron and Hermione approached them, but either didn’t notice or simply didn’t say anything about how closely the two were standing.</p><p class="p1">“Mum says that your car is about to arrive,” Ron said as Ginny gave a hug to Hermione.</p><p class="p1">“Thank-goodness,” Ginny whispered in Hermione’s ear with a wink.</p><p class="p1">Rolling her eyes, Hermione moved to Harry who looked momentarily sad at the sight of her. “I’m glad that we’ve gotten to see you.” He told her and then kissed her cheek. “Don’t be a stranger alright?”</p><p class="p1">Hermione nodded, as others seemed to gather around. When they retreated to the edge of the tent, Ron seemed to grow more bold, his hand on her hip and the same look back in his eyes. He wasted no time in collecting their things, and stealing a bottle of wine before they departed, hands intertwined and they were kissing as soon as they’d landed outside an unfamiliar home. Unlocking the door without his lips leaving her skin, Ron led her inside, dropping everything in his arms and slamming the door behind them. Hermione quickly pushed off his jacket, letting her own purse fall to the ground and wrapped her arms around his neck. With ease and practice, he lifted her off the ground and stumbled blindly towards his bedroom.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“So this is your home?” Hermione asked as she examined the collection of items on his bookshelf.</p><p class="p1">“Yeah,” Ron answered from the kitchen, rummaging through a drawer loudly. He looked up at Hermione, wearing only a shirt of his which was quite large on her. “Moved in right after you left. Couldn’t stand living with my sister and Harry, ah!” he said, shutting the drawer with his hip and held up a corkscrew victoriously. “I’m happy for them, honest but-“</p><p class="p1">“I understand,” Hermione agreed with a small chuckle, running her fingers over the spines of books that looked well read. “What are all these?”</p><p class="p1">“I’ve been trying to study up,” Ron answered, glancing at her again through the opening. “I don’t think we ever really appreciated you Hermione, but you were a walking library.” There was the sound of the cork being removed and then the clink of two glasses. “I had to keep up somehow.”</p><p class="p1">Hermione nodded, moving to the mantel which was decorated with pictures and various nicknacks. There was only one picture of her, standing with Ginny, Harry, and Ron. It appeared that she was trying to get them to take a nice picture, but they kept making her laugh. She smiled at the memory, it having been taken just before she’d gone off to Hogwarts and they to auror training. Her eyes drifted to the picture next to it. Harry and Ginny stood next to one another, and Hermione had been replaced by a girl with straight blonde hair.</p><p class="p1">“Who’s that?” Hermione asked as Ron came to stand beside her, putting an arm around her and handing her a glass.</p><p class="p1">Ron didn’t say anything, resting his head on her shoulder as he looked at the picture. “Oh,” he whispered, not sounding very happy about it. “That’s Katie.” He muttered. As he leaned closer to the picture Hermione could see that Katie didn’t look as happy with the Ron beside her as she had just a moment ago.</p><p class="p1">“Oh?” Hermione asked, turning her head to look at him, her cheek brushing against his.</p><p class="p1">“A teammate of Ginny’s,” he whispered, straightening up but didn’t move away. “We dated for a spell.”</p><p class="p1">“She wasn’t at the wedding,” Hermione commented, looking at the girl for a moment more and then back up at Ron.</p><p class="p1">“No,” Ron agreed, and then there was a faint blush on his cheeks. “According to Ginny I’m not very good at breaking up with girls,” there was a twinkle in his eyes. “You got off easy.”</p><p class="p1">Hermione scoffed but allowed him to kiss her neck to distract her as he tipped down the frame to hide the picture.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“Anyway you’ll stay?” he asked. They lay, side by side, his fingers running up and down the skin of her arm absentmindedly.</p><p class="p1">“Ronald,” she sighed, making to move away from him but he gently he held her back. She settled for looking up at him. His blue eyes were sad again and her heart felt like it was breaking.</p><p class="p1">“I know,” he said, staring at her as if trying to memorize every tiny crease of her skin, every inch of her. “But I had to try Hermione.” She sighed, nuzzling against his arm and he kissed her forehead. “How long until you go back?”</p><p class="p1">“My train leaves tomorrow afternoon.” She answered.</p><p class="p1">“Wanna grab lunch?” he asked of her. Hermione looked down, fidgeting with the blanket uncomfortably. “Right,” he answered, sounding quite disappointed.</p><p class="p1">“I’m sorry,” she told him honestly, looking up at him and sighed. “It’s just I haven’t packed yet and-“ he searched her eyes for a moment and then shook his own head. “I don’t feel like it’s fair for you.”</p><p class="p1">“I understand,” he told her dryly.</p><p class="p1">She could feel him pulling away and it broke her heart again.</p><p class="p1">“Please don’t be cross with me,” Hermione begged of him, kissing his shoulder gently and took his hand, intertwining it with her own. “We’ve had a really lovely time, don’t ruin it now.”</p><p class="p1">For a moment longer he was stiff with her and then seemed to make up his mind, relaxing his hand in hers and nodded. “I’ve missed you, Hermione Jane, you really should visit more often.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“What are you doing here?” Hermione asked in surprise as she walked up the stairs to her room, intent on packing and finding a strong cup of coffee before her train arrived. She found Harry exiting the bedroom with a smile on his face.</p><p class="p1">“Ginny forgot something,” he answered, holding up a pink bag. He looked her over for a moment and then frowned. “Are you just getting in?”</p><p class="p1">“Yes,” she answered defensively and before he could say anything more she walked past him into her room, wishing she was wearing something other than Ron’s sweats. She could still feel Harry’s eyes on her back.</p><p class="p1">“Where did you spend the night?” Harry asked accusingly. Hermione didn’t answer. “Who Hermione?”</p><p class="p1">“I’m perfectly at liberty to sleep with whoever I want Harry Potter.”</p><p class="p1">“Not while you’re staying under my roof!” he shouted.</p><p class="p1">“Don’t worry,” Hermione spat back. “I’m only here to grab my things, I won’t be here for long.”</p><p class="p1">She turned away, not really fancying an argument when she already felt so much regret for what she’d done, for how she’d left things with Ron. Every fiber in her was screaming at her to go back into arms, beg him to take her back and pray he might have the compassion to start things with her again. It was only her brain able to remind her of the mistake she’d made all those years ago, ending things when they were eighteen.</p><p class="p1">“You can’t keep doing this!” he yelled suddenly. Hermione stopped, turning back to face him. She’d never heard him yell before, not like this and certainly not at her. He seemed to realize what he was doing but was unable to stop. “You can’t keep fucking with him, Hermione.”</p><p class="p1">“How dare you,” she whispered in a hushed tone. “How dare you, Harry Potter.”</p><p class="p1">“Well! You don’t get it do you? You broke his heart Hermione, you ruined him. You can’t keep coming back messing with him and running away. Because you’re not the one who has to stay here. I am. I’m the one who has to clean up your messes because we’re not good enough for you.”</p><p class="p1">“That’s not why-“</p><p class="p1">“Why you abandoned us? Why you moved four countries away the second you could and will only see us when you’re sent a fifteen dollar invitation?” Harry’s face was alight with anger and he threw down the bag he’d been holding. “You don’t even write, you don’t visit. We’re not people you shared a cab with Hermione.”</p><p class="p1">“There are things you don’t understand Potter.” She whispered, aware of the tears dripping down the sides of her face.</p><p class="p1">“Like hell,” he snapped. “Hermione we grew up together, we spent seven years seeing each other nearly every day, we fought in a war together you were the only person who never left my side, who never questioned me and now you’re a stranger who lives in a different country with a different life.”</p><p class="p1">“I’m sorry I didn’t fancy staying here and playing house, I’m sorry everything didn’t just fall back into place after the war ended.” She let out a long breath. “Not all of us inherit houses and fortunes, some of us are left with our marks and a legacy of fucking up my parent's memories so badly they didn’t even have a flicker of recognition. Some of us don’t end up with the person we date at nineteen.”</p><p class="p1">“You loved him Hermione and you-“</p><p class="p1">“Loved him?” she asked, “Loved him? Harry, we dated for nine months, he was my school-boy crush and a war had just ended. That wasn’t love it was infatuation.”</p><p class="p1">“And you broke his heart!”</p><p class="p1">“I’m sorry I don’t fit in your neat little narrative,” she spat. “That’s what you wanted for me, isn’t it? You wanted this nice tidy future where your best friend married your other best friend so you didn’t ever have to pick or worry about keeping us around. You wanted a life where we all ended up related and raised our kids together and you never bothered to ask me if it’s what I wanted!”</p><p class="p1">She panted with the effort of shouting at him, waving her wand around to pack her things. Her trunks landed with a loud thud beside her when she finished, the room looking spotless and as if she’d never even set foot in the home.</p><p class="p1">“You were happy and you gave that up Hermione,” Harry told her in a low, quiet tone. “Let’s not talk about what I wanted.”</p><p class="p1">“Let's talk about what I want then! I want to live in a world where I can do research and revolutionize the wizarding world as we know it. I don’t want a life where I’m attached to your name like a footnote. I want a life where I can be happy and can sleep with my ex if I want to and my best friend can be happy for me.”</p><p class="p1">“And I want a world where I don’t have to spend months picking up my best mate after the girl he loves leaves him again.”</p><p class="p1">“Your best mate,” she breathed, feeling as if the air had been knocked from her. “Harry you wonder why I don’t visit it’s because you have already chosen who’s side you’re on.”</p><p class="p1">They stared at each other in silence. Tears continued down Hermione’s face as she stared at her best friend, the person she thought would never leave her, no matter what happened. He didn’t refute her, he didn’t argue with her anymore but instead adopted an exhausted expression. He looked ten years older from the Harry who had been laughing at his wedding the night prior, the man who had managed to light up more still when he spied his best friends with their arms around each other.</p><p class="p1">For perhaps five minutes he stood there, staring at her as if seeing her for the first time and without a goodbye, without a final word he turned suddenly and stomped out of the room. Hermione winced as he stormed down the stairs, each loud step feeling like a dagger to her heart. The front door slammed, vibrating through the house long after his crack of apparition whisked him away.</p>
