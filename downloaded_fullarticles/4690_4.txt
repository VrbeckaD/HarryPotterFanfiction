  <span class="s1"> “Bullshit,” Haggy calls and the few or so around him titter. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> The warm night swells into the room from the open doors and into Theodore’s heart. Faint light blankets this home born of windows and openness, belonging and not belonging to a man who never belonged. The gathering has delved well into the evening, reaching rosy cheeks from laughter or wine depending on the person. People tell stories—Theodore hears old Dom crafting something entirely made up about an opera brawl. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Theodore is blessed at his old age to have an evening grandeur in its company, to know such a vast group considered his family and to have been surrounded by them his whole life. There are newbies here, too, beloved friends and significant others brought along for the first time by the younger folk, many of whom sit around him.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Someone Theodore has yet to be introduced to supports Haggy’s disbelief, saying, “You might as well believe in magic if that’s true.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Guardian angels do exist,” Theodore insists, relaxed against the cushions. “At least, there is one we know of and if you don’t, then I feel sorry for you.” He winks. More laughs. “You all really haven’t been told the greatest love story to exist, then?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> They shake their heads. A few new people join them, sitting on armrests or on the floor, comfortably leaning against someone’s legs. Haggy has the right to look offended for not knowing this story in the roots of their history. His older cousin, Harriet, catches Theodore’s eye a little ways away. Her chest heaves with a sigh, her obligatory smile bittersweet.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Greatest love story?” Haggy prompts.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “The most tragic,” Theodore says. “Now, hold on close, because this won’t be anything the likes you’ve imagined before.”</span>
