  <span class="s1">Barnaby Lee liked ants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ants were always crawling around- sometimes in an ordered line, sometimes all over the place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was interesting to watch them, Barnaby thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Especially when he was upset.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He sighed and settled onto his stomach in the mulchy earth below a tree, watching the ants crawl up and down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were in a line today, but Barnaby couldn’t see where it went.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t particularly care, really.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He just liked watching them, with their six scurrying legs carrying them along, up and down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was calming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He rested his chin on his hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today’s Care of Magical Creatures Class had been rough.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barnaby usually loved Care of Magical Creatures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The creatures themselves were always interesting to work with, of course, and Professor Kettleburn hardly ever wrote anything on the board.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was easy to listen when professors talked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But when they were writing, Barnaby could never remember what they wrote.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if he copied it down, re-reading his notes was rarely edifying. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Edifying.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was a new word Barnaby had learned yesterday, from his friend Connor Murgatroyd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Ravenclaw boy had befriended Barnaby back in third year, and didn’t mind helping with homework.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes he used big words that Barnaby didn’t understand, but he would always stop and explain them if Barnaby asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Connor’s best friend Rowan Khanna studied with them too, sometimes, reading the textbook out loud.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Connor always said that going over the lessons to Barnaby helped him remember the details, and Rowan just seemed to like reading textbooks. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Today, though, Connor and Rowan hadn’t been able to help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Professor Kettleburn had assigned different groups than usual in Care of Magical Creatures Class, and Barnaby had been obliged to work with Merula Snyde, with whom he was no longer friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had been tasked to observe and draw a particularly fidgety krup.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barnaby didn’t really like drawing, and it was even harder when he couldn’t fix his mistakes because Merula had stolen his eraser.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barnaby had tried to work with the third member of their group, fellow Slytherin Ivan Ahlgren, but the short, slight, boy generally avoided conversation, and had tucked himself into a corner where he focused on his own drawing and nothing else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barnaby spent the class trying to draw the krup and tune out Merula’s constant droning about how her drawing was going to be the best in the class and she really could be an artist if she wasn’t such an accomplished student, and how she really pitied Barnaby’s drawing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had left him feeling stressed and drained.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He readjusted on the forest floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Watching the ants was relaxing, though.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just scuttling up and down the tree bark, over leaves, under roots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was peaceful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He inhaled deeply and closed his eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Suddenly, there was a loud CRACK just above him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With reflexes honed by years of living in a Death Eater household, he was on his feet in an instant, and suddenly had an armful of his fellow Slytherin fourth-year Liz Tuttle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He staggered under the impact and they landed in a heap on the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barnaby suddenly became aware that his left hand was very firmly on her upper thigh, just below her rump.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He quickly scooted away from her, shoving his hands into his pockets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They blinked at each other for a moment.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Liz brushed some leaves and twigs out of her braided hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hi Barnaby!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sorry I fell on you.” She glanced up at the tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Guess the branch wasn’t as strong as it looked.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What were you doing up there?” asked Barnaby.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“There’s a robin’s nest up there,” Liz explained, “A cat nearly caught the male a couple weeks ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was injured, and I wasn’t sure if the same healing spells that work on humans work on animals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I managed to help him, and bring him back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His mate seemed to appreciate the help, with the babies about to hatch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I helped bring some worms to the nest a few times, at the parents invitation, of course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, the babies are just about ready to fly, so I climbed up after class to wish them luck.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You can talk to birds?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Not exactly <em>talk, </em>no.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I understand them and they understand me, if you know what I mean. Do you?” Liz asked, regarding Barnaby through her thick-framed glasses.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I think so,” Barnaby nodded, “Magical creatures always seemed to make sense to me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He noticed Liz was clutching her arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Wait!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are you hurt? Let me see!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Am I?” She pulled up her sleeve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A shallow gash ran up her forearm where it had been scraped by a branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My shoulder feels a little bruised too, now that you mention it.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We should go to the hospital wing to get you cleaned up.” Barnaby got to his feet. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Liz tried to do the same and winced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think my ankle is hurt too.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Barnaby approached her and offered his hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She took it, breifly startling Barnaby with the softness of her skin, and managed to balance against him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Can you make it?” he asked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Liz smiled at him and nodded, and they crossed the lawn towards the castle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barnaby kept his arm firmly around her waist and tried not to think about how this was the first time he’d walked arm-in-arm with a girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><em>I’m just helping.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s good to help people who are hurt.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They reached the steps that led up to the castle entrance.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“This is going to be more difficult,” mused Liz, “I’ve seen some students Wingardium Leviosa themselves, do you think…?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Barnaby shook his head, “I’m not so good at Charms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I could probably carry you up the stairs, no problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean, if you don’t mind.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Liz regarded his muscular, then nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“As long as you don’t drop me,” she chirped, wrapping her arms around his neck and allowing herself to be lifted, bridal-style, into his arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barnaby swiftly mounted the staircase, trying not to think about the closeness of their bodies or the scent of lake water and hay that filled his nostrils. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What’s your favorite class?” he asked, in an attempt to make conversation.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Care of Magical Creatures, definitely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Though I don’t mind Herbology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Transfiguration is the only class I don’t really like- I always worry the animals we are Transfiguring might get hurt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What about you?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I also really like creatures,” Barnaby said, “And I don’t like classes where I have to sit still and read, so that’s… most of them.” he sighed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You don’t like reading?” asked Liz.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s hard for me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whenever I’m trying to read or write, I can look at the letters but they just don’t make sense, and I can never remember what they say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Merula say’s it’s just because I’m not very smart.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“People can be smart in different ways,” said Liz, “You were the only one in our class to be able to ride a Hippogriff on the first day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, I was a little surprised when I saw a big guy like you taking care of those tiny baby Bowtruckles.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I like Bowtruckles,” Barnaby said, “They’re a lot stronger than they look.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And did you know that they eat all of the insects that might threaten a tree?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I knew they ate insects already, but I just learned that it actually helps the trees when they do it!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Liz beamed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Most creatures are really important to their ecosystem!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even things we think are boring, like Flobberworms.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Barnaby nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sure, Flobberworms turn the soil, just like any other worm.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“A lot of people don’t know that, though!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Have you read Newt Scamader’s latest publication?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It talks a lot about the relationship BETWEEN different creatures, rather than just each creature’s relationship with wizardkind.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I… I would, but reading is…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Right!” Liz slumped with embarassment in Barnaby’s arms. “I didn’t mean… I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They had arrived outside the hospital wing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barnaby carefully lowered Liz to the ground and held the door open so she could hobble inside.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Madame Pomfrey was rifling through a cabinet, organizing various potions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked up at the two Slytherins.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Miss Tuttle, Mr. Lee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What brings you here today.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Liz pulled up her sleeve and showed the cut on her arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I also hurt my ankle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I… fell.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And Mr. Lee?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m ok. I just helped her get up here.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Good to help your friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now Miss Tuttle, let’s have a look.” Madame Pomfrey ushered Liz into the ward.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Barnaby sank into a chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Madame Pomfrey had called Liz his friend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Were they friends?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were both Slytherins, they had seen each other in classes before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Merula had always told Barnaby that she and Ismelda were his only friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That had changed when he started to spend time with Connor and Rowan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were always nice to him, and didn’t make him do things he didn’t want to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Liz seemed nice too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even nicer than the Ravenclaw boys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And she was pretty, Barnaby realized.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And liked creatures and…</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Barnaby gasped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had heard classmates talking about having crushes and wanting to go on dates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hadn’t quite understood it, certainly not when Merula wouldn’t let him spend much time with other students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Suddenly, now, though, he knew what it felt like.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wondered if Liz had ever had a crush.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The ward curtain opened and Liz appeared, looking much less disheveled than she had before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Barnaby!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’re still here!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He nervously ran a hand through his hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I thought I would wait and walk down to dinner with you.” He glanced at his watch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’re a little late, but the Great Hall should still have food.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Liz beamed at him, “Sure!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pomfrey just told me to get some food soon anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Healing spells tend to take some energy from the recipient, so I’m pretty hungry.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Barnaby opened the door for her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As Liz started down the corridor, she turned to him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I was thinking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even though you don’t like reading books, do you like listening to other people read?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah, actually,” said Barnaby, “Do you know Rowan Khanna?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He likes to read the textbooks out loud and I always feel like I understand it better when I hear it.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Then, maybe,” Liz shyly pushed her hands into her robe pockets and regarded him, “Maybe I could read Scamander’s new book to you, and then we can talk about it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not a lot of people are really interested in creatures, and you seem to be, so…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Barnaby’s face broke into a grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That sounds great!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And the two fourth-year Slytherins continued to the Great Hall, both delighting in the fact that they had found someone who shared their passion.</span>
