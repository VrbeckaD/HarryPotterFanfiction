    <p>Prologue</p>
<p>My name is Elizabeth Hart and today I find myself in a hospital bed wishing I was somewhere else. The doctors told me that my chances to survive were very slim and that they were shocked that I was even awake. I wished that I had my books with me not that I could read them as I laid there unable to move. I had been in a car crash and I had all these tubes going into me. They were waiting for my father to come before they did anything else to help me further. I decided to let my body rest so I closed my eyes not knowing that when I opened them again I would be somewhere else completely a World of magic with witches, wizards, and dark lords.</p>
<p>Little did I know that a world like this could be real. Or maybe its just my own way to believe it could my own peace of Heaven. Because of my love for these books it became my tiny peace of heaven in hell.</p>
