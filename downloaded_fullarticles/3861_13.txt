  <span>“You mustn’t worry yourself so much, Minerva. You’ve done just fine, and you will continue to do so.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not </span>
  <em>
    <span>worried,</span>
  </em>
  <span> I just--”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Professor McGonagall halted her pacing along the foyer, thousands of eyes tracing her every step. Her gaze, however, rested on that of a single being’s--those vacant, blue eyes, swirling behind a glass frame. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We have been blessed,” she said, “with this grace period. I cannot help but wonder, like before, if it is simply the calm before the storm.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The portrait of Albus Dumbledore simply hummed. “Peace would not exist without storms to give it meaning. Has Professor Trelawney--”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No,” McGonagall snapped irritably. “Not one. She’s been as light as a feather, but I know better. I’ve felt it for weeks, and yet...yet…” She sighed. “I’m at a loss.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And what exactly do you think is coming?” he asked. “I had never known you to show psychic abilities, Minerva. Perhaps it is just anxiety that is causing you to fuss.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not divination,” McGonagall agreed. “More so my instincts, my...my </span>
  <em>
    <span>intuition.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” The headmistress shook her head. “ I can sense it, but--nobody else can.” She raised her eyes to the portrait. “The four are coming,” she told it. “And soon. I can feel it in every breath I take, and every rattle of my bones.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ah,” said Dumbledore, “lovely. I’ve so looked forward to meeting them. Send them my way when they arrive, quite regularly if you will. My lifelong curiosity will be sated.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The pieces--”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Are all safe,” interjected Dumbledore, “and accounted for. Furthermore, as the moment stands, they are entirely unnecessary.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Potter had been close to accessing it,” fretted McGonagall, as she continued her pacing. “I had thought that perhaps--perhaps, even as all Gryffindor’s, Potter, Weasley and Granger had possessed the traits, the requirements…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And yet, they had not.” The portrait’s steely eyes trailed every nervous movement of the headmistress, taking it in. “Because, they were not the ones.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“There should not even </span>
  <em>
    <span>be</span>
  </em>
  <span> ones!” McGonagall insisted. “Everything we have done--every precaution, every step--”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I do not think,” said Dumbledore, “that it is not such a bad thing, this prophecy. Surely an ancient one, but not bad. It will lead to a peace within Hogwarts that the school has never felt before.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall scoffed. “And the casualties?” she asked. “What of the losses that will come from it? You cannot truly believe that this peace within the school will make up for it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Certainly not,” said Dumbledore. “And yet, there is no need to fret over it. It will happen, whether we worry or not. All we can do is sit back and wait for the students who will pave the future into a better place.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And if they fail?” McGonagall asked. “They’ll be but children--barely old enough to wave their wands around outside of school, let alone take on such…” she shivered, “...horrors.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They are the chosen ones of legend, a legend that we have hidden for a very long time,” Dumbledore replied calmly. “It is a tale that has been hidden within the castle walls for centuries, held only between the headmaster and their approved successions. Even they, unlike Harry Potter, will not know--not until the time is right. Then, they will act. Which is why we must always do our best to ensure that students of Hogwarts,” he said, “</span>
  <em>
    <span>all</span>
  </em>
  <span> students, should be shown the light in the world. Despite the pasts of their families.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Professor McGonagall’s lips pursed together tightly. “Perhaps,” she said. “I cannot help but wonder with the young Lupin--”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You still have a year to prepare,” the portrait reminded her gently. “And then seven more for the oldest of Potters, I believe. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You know your duties, should the time arise,” Dumbledore reminded her. “Who knows--it may occur beyond your time.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I just don’t see why </span>
  <em>
    <span>it</span>
  </em>
  <span> must remain here,” McGonagall admitted, shaking her head. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>It</span>
  </em>
  <span> should be gone elsewhere--far away, where no students will stumble across it and bring the prophecy to life.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And yet,” Dumbledore said, “it was Rowena who chose to keep </span>
  <em>
    <span>it</span>
  </em>
  <span> on the grounds, despite the warnings of Godric and Helga.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall huffed. “Then perhaps she was not so wise after all,” she stated.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Quite on the contrary, Minerva,” the portrait grinned, “she was wiser than us all.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The headmistress contemplated for a moment, only to scoff, shaking her head. “I fail to see the logic,” she said, “in keeping such a dangerous object on school grounds.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“There is none, of course,” replied Dumbledore. “It is the last place one would expect </span>
  <em>
    <span>them</span>
  </em>
  <span> to be. Which is why we, like the other major wizarding schools throughout the world, wear them on our sleeves where no one will find them.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonnagall whipped her head to the portrait, eyes as wide as golf-balls. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You mean to say,” she spoke quietly, “that...the other </span>
  <em>
    <span>objects...</span>
  </em>
  <span>they also lie within the grounds of wizarding schools?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Have you not </span>
  <em>
    <span>listened</span>
  </em>
  <span> at all, Minerva?” drawled a snarly voice from the wall.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Quite the contrary, Severus,” Dumbledore mused. “She has listened extraordinarily well. I was equally astonished when I was informed of the locations of </span>
  <em>
    <span>the objects.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Albus,” Minerva pushed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You worry too much, Minerva,” Dumbledore replied. “There is nothing that you can do, other than your best. While it is true that the other </span>
  <em>
    <span>objects</span>
  </em>
  <span> lie amongst the ten other major wizarding schools of the world, you have no purpose in interfering nor caring for them.”</span>
</p>
<p><span>“But there are </span><em><span>lives</span></em><span> at stake!” exclaimed the headmistress in alarm. “And those of children, too! Their very lives are acting as the shields against these...these </span><em><span>cursed</span></em> <em><span>objects!</span></em><span> Should the prophecy not come true--should the chosen ones fail, these children--”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>“Will be under the protection of their own headmasters,” interjected the portrait. “As well as the ministry, no doubt. Likewise, you seem to forget that it’s not Hogwarts alone that will offer up heroes in this war.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonnagall’s lips pressed into a thin line. “Children,” she sighed tiredly, shaking her head. “Why is it always </span>
  <em>
    <span>children</span>
  </em>
  <span> that are prophesied to save the world? Why do we put so much on their backs?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Because it is they who offer the key to the future,” Dumbledore hummed. “For it is they who still see the light.” </span>
