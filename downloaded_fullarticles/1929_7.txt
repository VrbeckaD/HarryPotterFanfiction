    <p>The smell of fresh scones made Hermione stop just outside the shop and breathe in. It was a Sunday, her favourite day of the week and she had absolutely no obligations to anyone. She was going to get herself an Americano and one of those sinful black currant scones, park herself in the corner she loved secluded by the window and read as long as she pleased.<br/> Her parents were having a date day and taking some time for themselves. Of course, she loved being with them, and she was thrilled that with help she had been able to restore their memories. But ever since they learned what she had been dealing with for the past year they were hovering over her, Hermione needed space.<br/> Learning to be independent so early as a teenager, hunting Horcruxes and basically taking care of two teenage boys by herself. Then going back to once again living in a home with your parents wasn't exactly the most natural thing. So much had happened, and it was no surprise that they wanted to make up for lost time, but she was delighted that for the day she had some time just for herself. Over the last few months, Hermione had been working for them. Their Australian counterparts had opened a vineyard and winery. When they returned after having their memories restored both decided that continuing the business was what they wanted, instead of going back to dentistry. Most of the production takes place in Sydney, but they had a booming store just outside of London with a small vineyard attached. Dentistry to wine seemed quite the leap, but it seemed to make them both happy, Hermione couldn't complain about that. Working for them in the shop was also quite pleasant, she enjoyed watching the process and selling people something they loved.<br/> Every Sunday she had made a habit of going to the coffee shop to read whatever newfound novel or begin studying a subject that fascinated her. It was a peaceful existence, but she needed it after all the hell the recent years had brought to everyone.<br/> The day was still somewhat temperate, the early September air was beginning to cool but not excessively. She was even able to wear a dress without tights, something that would be a thing of the past in just a few short weeks. That and the ability to dress for herself in general, Hogwarts was requiring that all returning “8th” years continue to wear a uniform. Personally, Hermione didn’t mind this so much, but Ginny was outraged, she had spent the whole of Thursday evening dinner at the Burrow lamenting about the woes of wearing a uniform once again. Hermione wasn't concerned so long as she was allowed to go back to school in general, after they passed the appeal to allow them back. She had wanted to cry for joy and was a bit heartbroken when the new Ministry announced that Hogwarts would open a month later than per usual, as repairs were still being done. They had offered all three, she Harry and Ron passes for the NEWTS, but they had all refused. Hermione was surprised that at least Ron didn’t take it, perhaps Mrs Weasley had something to do with that fact.<br/> Swinging open the glass door, she let herself into her favourite coffee shop in London. Jamie the barista who always worked Sundays was waiting at the counter, he gave her a grin. They had been talking back and forth since she started coming there. Hermione had learned that he was majoring in law at Cambridge and loved to read, they hit it off obviously right away, now Hermione very much looked forward to their discussions.<br/> “Hello there,” Jamie tossed his unruly auburn hair and scooted her Americano toward her already made and steaming in the cup.<br/> “I’ve become much too predictable,” Hermione laughed grabbing the cup and handing him some money.<br/> “I like it! No fuss, it makes for a good work day.” Jamie bent behind the counter and came up frowning, “I thought we had another scone, but I think the guy that came in before you got the last one.”<br/> Hermione smiled, “its okay,” looking in the glass case she pointed at a chocolate croissant, “I’ll take that one.”<br/> Pastry and coffee in hand Hermione looked up to thank Jamie, and he gave another sheepish smile, he was charming Hermione could not deny that in the slightest.<br/> “I think you may have to find a new spot today, that guy not only took your scone but also your chair.”<br/> Hermione peeked around the corner to her usually tucked away, isolated area and sure enough, she could see a dark head visible tucked in HER corner. Nope. Hermione was not going to allow it to dampen her mood. She shrugged a little less nonchalantly than she wanted but smiled and looked around for another secluded seat.<br/> Soft folksy music floated through the shop, the smell of coffee grounds lifted her spirits once again. Apart from that other person, she was the lone customer in the shop. There was a small armchair away from the door… though without the window of her other chair.<br/> Situating herself comfortably in the seat she took a sip of her Americano and pulled out a battered copy of Wuthering Heights. Waving it cheekily at Jamie as he looked up from wiping down the espresso machine. They both had a love of the Bronte sisters, but Jamie preferred Anne to Emily. He shook his head at her making auburn curls fall in his eyes. Now, thought Hermione turning, tucking her feet up under her and opening the book, it was time to get lost on the moors with Cathy and Heathcliff.<br/> Light outside was beginning to dim when she finally reached the end of the tragic tale, and a shiver ran through her at the remembrance of Cathy at the window, begging for entry. It was a part of the story that had always spooked her as a younger reader. Closing the book, Hermione checked her watch and saw that it was almost a quarter past five. Yawning she stretched and looked around.<br/> Jamie was drying cups, and the rustle of paper alerted her that the man in the corner was still there as well. Getting up she brought her plate and cup to the counter.<br/> “She’s alive!” He joked winking at her, “how was the book?”<br/> “Good as usual!”<br/> “Heathcliff it's me! Cathy, I’ve come home!” He singsonged in a high-pitched voice.<br/> Hermione narrowed her eyes, “I believe that is a Pat Benatar song.”<br/> He pretended to shiver visibly, and she giggled.<br/> “When do you leave for school again?”<br/> Hermione tensed a little, she had tried her best not to give away too much of her schooling to Jamie when they talked about it. “October 1st.”<br/> “Hmm, that seems like a while for the fall semester.” He mused leaning toward her over the counter.<br/> “Yeah, I don’t know, I just follow the itinerary.” She lied.<br/> “Well,” he leaned forward tapping her forehead with his finger softly. “If you decide to put that brilliant noggin of yours to good use, you know I have pull with admissions.”<br/> Hermione bit the inside of her cheek, Jamie had been trying to get her to apply to Cambridge nearly since they had met.<br/> “Then I will know where to find you, night Jamie.”<br/> As she walked to the tube that night Hermione thought about it, she could get a good education and be closer to her family. She wouldn’t have to relive any of what had happened. Inadvertently she touched her forearm, over her scar that she glamoured in public, shivering Hermione decided she wouldn’t think about it right now. Later... maybe.<br/> …<br/> Severus sucked in a deep breath of morning air. Stepping out onto the balcony of his flat, overlooking a public garden. He brought a cup of tea to his lips and sat himself in the chair he had positioned out there in just the right spot. He had placed a charm over the balcony which allowed him to sit outside in his dressing gown and loungewear without anyone seeing him. The book in his lap was one of pure recreation, entirely without motive, that was leaps and bounds from where he had been a year before. Tucked in the first page was the letter he had received from Minerva the day before, asking if he would return as Potions Master of Hogwarts. Holding it up Severus pursed his lips and debated incinerating it right there. After a moment or two he placed it back in the book and began to read the prologue, he could think about the letter later.<br/> That day Severus went to a small coffee shop he found and rather liked. It was quiet and generally empty on Sunday’s with the occasional person coming in or out. The baristas were not incompetent, and Severus had to admit that they made the best scones he had ever tasted. Yet another perk of no longer being subservient to crazed men, he had time to eat and an actual appetite. To the point where he had gained all the lost weight back and a little more. For once when Severus looked into the mirror, he didn’t find a gaunt and tired looking man, but a healthy well rested one. On top of it all, there was something oh so refreshing about no one around him knowing who he was, or what he had done.<br/> Severus discreetly charmed the latest copy of the Daily Prophet, so it looked like your average newspaper and began to read. Immediately grumbling at the lack of tact the Prophet was still showing, Severus only read the damned thing not to be entirely in the dark of what they were spewing to the public, sometimes about him. Often about him. Today that was not the case, instead, he found a piece on the Golden Trio. Severus rolled his eyes; the Ministry had offered them all completion of their schooling if they wanted it. The whole of the wizarding world always handing out passes to those particular three. The thing that caught his attention was that none of them had accepted the offer. From Granger that wasn’t shocking, expected even, but Potter and Weasley, good Merlin that really gave him an excuse not to return to that wretched school.<br/> Though he hated to admit it, being wholly isolated was getting to be a bit lonely. It would be nice to at least have an option to talk about constructive things with a likeminded individual. Absent from popular belief Severus did on a rare occasion enjoy the presence of someone not entirely encompassed by stupidity. His colleagues were not exactly exceptional for such needs, especially when most of them were still very much standoffish with him and of course, it was the summer holiday. In personal respect there weren't a lot of people who would ever give friendship with him real thought, Severus was a complicated and difficult human, he knew that. He liked his privacy, emotions came with difficulty and obviously his past was... difficult that was putting it easily. Of course, there were a few witches Severus could call upon if he wanted a different form of stimulation, but real discussion was another thing entirely.<br/> Shaking it off and quickly deciding he’d had quite enough of the Prophet for the moment at least putting it away in favour of his copy of The Count of Monte Cristo a classic Severus had meant to read for ages but had been otherwise engaged.<br/> …<br/> A week gone, and Hermione was exhausted. They had been clearing out sections of the wine stores in preparation for more stock coming in and lugging boxes around constantly in fear of dropping and breaking one was far from her idea of fun. Not to mention Thursday night dinner at the Burrow had been frustrating. Though Ron and herself had decided mostly mutually weeks before that, they were much better off outside of a romantic relationship Hermione was confident that Mrs Weasley did not think along that same line. An icy dinner ensued consisting of mostly kind and careful statements made by Gin and Mr Weasley, to ease a bit of the tension, it didn’t exactly work out. It had been a consistent struggle missing Fred, it was very hard for everyone to George's mentality. Usually, he was the life of the party, but now George was deflated, unsure how to proceed it seemed.<br/> With all that together Sunday coming around was just what Hermione needed. As gloomy and grey as it was she couldn’t think of anything quite so enjoyable as sitting and reading at the coffee shop.<br/> A drop of rain slid down her neck as she entered, and it made her shiver, hugging the jumper she wore closer, the weather was changing. Jamie was in his place, this time putting out what looked to be freshly baked pumpkin scones.<br/> “Early start to autumn then?”<br/> He looked up and rolled his eyes, “the boss, says its what the people want.”<br/> Hermione chuckled a little but frowned when she noticed the pastries displayed in the case, “no black currant?”<br/> Jamie shook his head and snapped his fingers at his blunder, “damn, sorry, that same guy, I should’ve thought to make extra.”<br/> “Sounds like pumpkin it is.”<br/> Jamie gave her a sheepish smirk, “coming right up.”<br/> Hermione was also displeased to realise that her favourite chair was once again taken. Frowning she took her pastry and coffee to the table across the shop and settled in.<br/> ...<br/> An hour or so in, Hermione was having a hard time focusing. Dinner at the Burrow kept running through her head. How did anyone, Molly included think that she and Ron were well suited for each other? They were about as unlike as Hagrid and Professor McGonagall, but so many people around them seemed to think that they belonged together. You would think after everything they had gone through people would start thinking of them as the adults they were, or at the very least that they were capable of making decent decisions for themselves. Hermione wanted so badly for someone to talk to, not about mundane things but deeper, more profound conversation. It would be lovely if she could find someone who was able to have that and also understood her, who she was and what she had been through. A little physical attention would not go unappreciated either, though not in the way Ron or Victor Krum had been. All about themselves not caring about her pleasure or needs. Yeah, right, finding a man that would be like finding a unicorn in muggle London.<br/> Snapping the book closed she leaned back in her chair and rubbed her eyes. The idea of starting all over was so very tempting, she could still practice magic, get a muggle degree and live her life somewhere in between. Something about it was wrong though, she belonged in the wizarding world, wasn’t that what half of all this been for? As a muggle-born Hermione was just as much a witch as any other.<br/> Glancing at the counter to make sure Jamie hadn’t seen her throw her little fit, Hermione could see that he was in the back and the rest of the shop looked empty. Biting her lip, she sighed, it wasn’t that she hadn’t wished things would work out with Ron, she really had.<br/> Hermione heard the rustle of pages and looked up, it was coming from her corner. God, she wished he would leave, it was petty, but Hermione wanted her corner. Deciding she could go for a refill and perhaps would be able to spot who it was that had snatched her scone, and her corner two weeks in a row, Hermione went to the counter.<br/> Jamie was still in the back, so she set her cup down and casually stepped to the left, leaning to see clearly her comfy armchair. When she got a clear view, her mouth fell fully open.<br/> It was Professor Snape, hooked nose buried in a book and wearing a black muggle suit the jacket discarded on the arm of the chair and black tie slightly loosened.<br/> “Hermione?” Jamie asked walking up with her new coffee his voice confused at the way he found her gaping. Coincidently his voice was also loud enough to jar Snape from his book.<br/> Slowly looking up Snape’s eyes locked with Hermione’s a moment of surprise flashing fleetingly, then his features descending into a displeased scowl. </p>
