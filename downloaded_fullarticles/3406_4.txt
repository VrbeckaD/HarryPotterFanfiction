          <div class="userstuff"><p>You really hate how the first thing Monday morning is a double Potions class with the Slytherins. It just seems so unfair that that's how you start your week. Not only does Serket take points from Hufflepuff at <em>any </em>opportunity, but her daughter is in the class too and she pesters you <em>the whole time</em>. </p><p>'Did you know that if the Sorting Hat takes more than five minutes it's called a Hatstall?' Vriska says. </p><p>You groan into your textbook, as if that'll stop her from talking.</p><p>'The hat took over six minutes on you! That only happens, like, once every 50 years.'</p><p>'I don't <em>caaaaaare</em>!'</p><p>'2 points from Hufflepuff, Mr Egbert, for disturbing the class,' Serket says, conveniently ignoring that you're trying <em>not </em>to talk to her daughter. You keep your annoyance to yourself though. You don't want to lose any more points. </p><p>'So, what took it so long with you?' Vriska asks, not bothering to lower her voice. 'Which house could you have been in if not for Hufflepuff?'</p><p>'Mind your own business,' you hiss. </p><p>'It was probably Gryffindor, right?'</p><p>'Ugh, Vriska, ugh!' you say. 'That's like, the oldest trick in the book! I'm not gonna tell you just because I want to correct you!'</p><p>She's quiet for a few blissful minutes while she skins her shrivelfigs and considers that. She's annoyingly good at Potions, but you bet her mom taught her before she came to Hogwarts like a cheat. </p><p>'Bet it was Slytherin,' she says. </p><p>'Yeah,' you say sarcastically, 'but I saw you were in Slytherin and I begged the hat to let me go anywhere else instead.'</p><p>She makes a disbelieving noise and flicks her (illegally not tied up!!!!) hair over her shoulder. </p><p>'Egbert comes before Serket,' she says. 'Besides, you <em>loooooooove </em>me.'</p><p>You faceplant back into your book. You hate Mondays. </p></div>
