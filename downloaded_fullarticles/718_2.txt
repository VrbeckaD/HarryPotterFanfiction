    <p>There he was again. Sirius noticed him, as soon as he stepped inside the laundry room. The tall slim figure, the golden-brown curls that fell into his eyes when he walked. Oh, that hair. Sirius would be lying if he said he hadn’t dreamt of running his fingers through it.</p>
<p>Sirius wasn’t sure when he’d started to notice the boy, but he’d seen him many times before: in his Psychology classes, his English Literature classes, and just around campus, usually accompanied by his laptop or with his head buried deep in a book. </p>
<p>“Huh.” The voice of James Potter, awfully close to his ear, made Sirius jump and look away from the curly-haired boy, who had just gotten in line for the laundry machines. </p>
<p>“You’re distracted again,” James pointed out. </p>
<p>Sirius huffed and rolled his eyes, but didn’t answer James. He <em>had</em> been distracted and hadn’t heard whatever his friend had been talking about. </p>
<p>“But by what?” James asked thoughtfully. A grin spread on his lips. “Or… by who?”</p>
<p>“By no one, James,” he said, leaning against the wall and trying his best to replicate the nonchalant look that usually came so naturally to him. “I was just thinking about... homework.”</p>
<p>James snorted and crossed his arms. He lowered his head and looked over his glasses to give Sirus a disbelieving look. “Bullshit,” he said. “C’mon, mate, just admit it, someone has your… attention. And that someone isn’t me, which I consider a crime!”</p>
<p>Sirius shot his friend a teasing look. “I was under the impression that you only wanted the ‘attention' of a certain redhead, but if you that’s how you feel about me, you could’ve just said it,” he teased.</p>
<p>James shoved at his shoulder. “That’s not what I meant, you moron. But whoever you have your eyes on is taking your attention away from my very thrilling tale of how I scored that perfect touchdown at the last game, so he must be pretty special.”</p>
<p>“Or maybe I’m just not interested in hearing you talk about football twenty-four/seven,” Sirius clapped back.</p>
<p>James shook his head, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. “No, that can’t possibly be,” he said with a cheeky grin. “Come on, Siri. Which one of these handsome young fellas-” he gestured at the long line of students waiting with their laundry, “has made you, Mr. Cool-And-Punk, all soft and mushy?”</p>
<p>Sirius groaned. “<em> James </em>.”</p>
<p>“You might as well tell me,” he said, throwing an arm around Sirius and following his eyes around the room. “Or I’m gonna find out by myself.”</p>
<p>“I hate you,” Sirius said, knowing fully that James was going to keep pestering him about it until he told him. “Okay, you see that guy who got in line not long ago? The tall one with the curls.”</p>
<p>James stretched his neck to look over the crowd, a dumb thing to do, considering he was about the same height as Sirius, who had no trouble seeing the mysterious handsome student.</p>
<p>“I don’t see him,” James said after a little bit, turning back to Sirius. </p>
<p>“Well maybe you need stronger glasses,” Sirius sneered. “He’s standing next to the girl in a bright yellow jumper. He just took his phone out of his pocket.” He wondered if the boy was texting anyone but quickly shook the thought away. </p>
<p>“Oh, I think I see him now!” James said, again cocking up his head to look at all the students. “Tall, slim build, wearing an oversized, knitted jumper?”</p>
<p>Sirius nodded. “That would be him,” he confirmed. “Are you happy now?”</p>
<p>James turned back to Sirius, grinning. There was a strangely mischevious glint in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh no,” Sirius muttered. He knew that look. </p>
<p>“He’s cute,” James said, crossing his arms. “You should do something to get his attention.” He stroked his chin in pretend thoughtfulness, then, as though he was hit with a sudden stroke of genius, he snapped his finger and exclaimed: “Ahá!”</p>
<p><em>“What</em>, James?” Sirius groaned impatiently. </p>
<p>“How about you walk up to him right now and introduce yourself,” James suggested.</p>
<p>Sirius glanced over at the boy, still standing in line for a laundry machine. He tried playing a hypothetical interaction out in his head. What would he even say to him?</p>
<p><em>‘Hi, I’m Sirius’</em>?</p>
<p>He could already imagine the boy glaring at him as though he thought Sirius was insane. He imagined he would say something like, <em>‘Okay?</em>’ or ‘<em>Please leave me alone’</em>. </p>
<p>“Are you insane?” Sirius sneered. “I can’t just walk up to him like that! He’s gonna think I’m a creep!”</p>
<p>James sighed. “Sirius,” he said, placing a hand on each of Sirus’ shoulders and forcing him to face him. “I’m sorry but you leave me no other choice.”</p>
<p>“No-” Sirius had to stop James before he said it, <em>the sacred words</em>, but it was too late:</p>
<p>“I dare you,” James said, letting go of Sirius and standing back, watching him with a pleased expression. </p>
<p>Sirius groaned. He hated how well James knew him. For the two of them, saying <em>‘I dare you</em>’ was like a holy pact. Once it was said, you had to do the thing. No ifs, ands or buts.</p>
<p>“I hate you,” he sneered at James for the second time that day. “You sadistic motherfucker.”</p>
<p>James grinned, completely unfazed by his friend’s harsh words. “Come on,” he said. “You’ll thank me later.”</p>

<p>Remus bounced his leg impatiently as he waited in line for an available laundry machine. How long had he been standing here for now? An hour? Okay, maybe not an hour, he thought to himself, but it felt like forever. Every moment he stood here was a moment wasted.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but think of the overwhelming amount of homework he needed to do. There was no way he would be able to finish all of it and also get to bed at a reasonable time. He cursed himself for choosing to do his laundry on a Sunday. Shouldn’t he know by now that Sunday was the day practically everyone on campus chose to do their laundry?</p>
<p>Remus slipped his phone out of his pocket; If he was going to stand in line for an eternity, he might as well entertain himself somehow. </p>
<p>The internet was a grim place. Politics, climate change, a single cute cat video and then <em>more</em> politics. Remus was tired of hearing about Brexit, so instead, he checked his messages. Lily had texted him about 10 minutes ago:</p>
<p>‘Can you be a sweetheart and take my laundry with you today? I’ll owe you big time!’</p>
<p>He bit his lip and texted back:</p>
<p>‘oof, sorry. already went down to the laundry room before i saw your message.’</p>
<p>Hoping Lily wouldn’t be mad at him, and that she would be able to survive without clean laundry for another day or so, Remus closed both Twitter and the Messenger app. He still needed time to pass. Did he have any games on his phone? He rarely had time to play anything, as he was always doing homework or honing what little social life he still had, which was almost none, other than occasionally hanging out with his roommate, Lily. </p>
<p>Turned out he did have a few games on his phone: finally something he could do to pass the time. Once he got wrapped up in matching the colourful boxes on the screen, time did actually pass pretty quickly. Finally, it was his turn for the next machine. With a gratified sigh, he slipped his phone back into his pocket and waited patiently. </p>
<p>The clothes spun around inside the machine in front of him. Soon, the time would be up and Remus could finally get his clothes washed so he could return to his homework. </p>
<p>Only two minutes left of the other person’s laundry time. Then only one minute, and suddenly, the machine beeped, indicating that it was done. A girl in a brightly coloured jumper opened the machine and unloaded all of her now clean clothes into a basket, before leaving.</p>
<p>Remus smiled triumphantly. The laundry machine was his at last.</p>
<p>Or so he had thought. </p>
<p>Before he could get to the machine, someone else stepped in, right in front of his face, and took it. </p>
<p>“Hey!” Remus exclaimed. “You can’t just skip in line like that!” He had been waiting in line<em> forever</em> and was ready to murder the guy if that’s what it took to get his machine back.</p>
<p>The wicked laundry machine-thief, merely grinned at him, leaning back against the big machine. His hair was dark, swept up into a messy bun, but a few strands fell down, perfectly framing his face. </p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry,” he said, for a moment leading Remus to believe that he was actually going to apologize and step back. But then he continued:</p>
<p>“You can have it back if you… kiss me.”</p>
<p>Remus was taken aback by the strange request but quickly recomposed himself. He wanted to push the guy right into the machine behind him but instead, he closed his eyes, took a deep breath, the opened them again.</p>
<p>He needed that machine. If he didn’t get his laundry done soon, very soon, he wouldn’t have time for all his homework. What else was he supposed to do?</p>
<p>In a moment of infuriating desperation, he grabbed the guy by the collar and pulled him into a kiss. </p>
<p align="center">-</p>
<p>Sirius didn’t know what he had expected.</p>
<p>But it certainly wasn’t this.</p>
<p>All he could do was stand there, paralyzed, as their lips met. He thought he might’ve let out a soft moan, but he wasn’t sure: all he knew was that his whole body ached, buzzed with electricity, a warm tingle that went through his chest, into every cell in his body. </p>
<p>When the guy broke the kiss and stepped away, after what had probably only been a second, Sirius was left breathless, with a heart that threatened to jump out his chest.</p>
<p>He looked at the guy, searching for something to prove that he had liked it too, but he merely looked annoyed as he picked up his laundry basket again. “Can I have my machine back now, please?”</p>
<p>Sirius nodded and stepped aside. Slowly, he brought his hand up to his lips. They still felt tingly from the unfamiliar touch. Sirius closed his eyes, let out a sigh, and promised to himself that this wouldn’t be the last time he kissed the tall, handsome student with the golden curls. </p>
