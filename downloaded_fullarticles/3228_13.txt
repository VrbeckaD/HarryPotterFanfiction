    <p>“Perce, I got a letter from Tina.”</p><p> Percival turned away from the occamy nest to see Newt coming towards him from the shed. Sure enough, the red-head was holding a parchment, but what grabbed Percival’s attention was the worried look on the other man’s face.</p><p>“Is something wrong?”</p><p>Newt sighed and handed him the letter. “I don’t know how to tell you about this so you are just going to have to hear it from Tina.”</p><p>Percival’s brow furrowed in confusion but he looked dutifully down to the letter and started reading.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Newt,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A mutual friend of ours that had been presumed dead has recently approached me – very much alive, needlessly to say. We are not sure what the next steps for this friends should be and would very much appreciate your help.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Kind regards,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tina.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Who…?” Suddenly it downed on Percival who said friend was. “The Barebone boy!”</p><p>“Yeah, uhhm, we should probably go back to New York.”</p><p>Percival felt cold and hot at the same time. He loosened the tie around his neck in hopes of being able to breathe more easily and then ended up sitting on the ground. The occamy’s wasted no time to surround him playfully.</p><p>“Perce, I…” Newt started stammering in a way he hadn’t around Percival since they first met.</p><p>Percival put his face in his hands and could easily feel the scars there, the scars that he had hoped would wipe away the atrocious acts committed with his face.</p><p>“I never knew him, you know,” he said quietly. “I saw him maybe once around the whole fiasco of Tina’s demotion, but I never spoke to him. Grindelwald jumped me around that time and apparently decided to use to his advantage the fact that the boy was lost and alone in a cruel world, starving for affection,” Percival drew in a shaky breath.</p><p>Newt crouched down beside Percival and shooed a few of the occamy’s out of the way so he could take Percival’s hands and look him in the eyes, something he rarely did, even now that they had begun a romantic relationship. “You know this isn’t your fault,” he said steadily. “There was nothing you could have done to prevent what happened.”</p><p>“But it was done with my face,” Percival could tell that Newt was going to object and stopped him before he could. “Logically I know that this wasn’t my fault, but I still wonder if there wasn’t something I could have done to prevent what happened to Barebone. It’s the part that I feel most responsible for – Grindelwald managed to fool an entire department of aurors and the president of MACUSA herself, whatever he did there can just as well be blamed on them as me. But Barebone was an innocent bystander – one that didn’t even know about the Wizarding World, let alone some dark wizard and his horrible schemes. Everything Grindelwald did to Barebone he will undoubtedly always connect with my face.”</p><p>Percival hadn’t noticed that he was crying until Newt wiped his cheeks with his thumbs, then holding his face still between his hands and kissing him softly. Percival melted into the kiss and wondered yet again if he would even still be alive if this strange and wonderful person hadn’t forced his way into his life.</p><p>“I can’t imagine what you must feel or what you are going through,” Newt said, still stroking Percival’s cheek soothingly. “But I think it might do both you and Mr. Barebone a world of good if you met each other.”</p><p>Percival leaned his head on Newt’s shoulder and let out a sigh. “You are right of course, as with everything else. Besides, we need to help the Goldsteins’ and make sure MACUSA doesn’t decide to try to execute Barebone.”</p><p>“Maybe it would be best to get Mr. Barebone out of the States, at least for a time, he needs to be hidden from Grindelwald and, no offence, but I do not trust the Magical Congress of America not to try to murder Mr. Barebone again so we will also most likely need to hide him from them.”</p><p>“Things are never easy,” Percival said with a wry smile.</p><p> </p>
