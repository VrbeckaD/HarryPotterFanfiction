    <p>Chapter 1.The Spy next door.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath. It was over. The war, Voldemort, danger. But the death eaters remained. She walked through the halls until she found both her best friends and hugged each of them one by one.</p>
<p>Then took a step back looked at their amazing, beautiful, miraculously unharmed faces and all three of them laughed together.</p>
<p>Even though they were standing in a newly rebuilt Ministry of Magic with shackled death eaters led by aurors walking on either sides of them, they were laughing and as they realized the absurdity of the situation, they laughed harder.<br/> “It’s over ‘mione” Harry said and Hermione nodded fervently, while Ron just slapped Harry’s back and guffawed.</p>
<p>“Not yet it isn’t.” said Professor McGonagall coming towards them. Hermione stopped laughing and turned to her.</p>
<p> “What do you mean, professor?” Harry and Ron also stopped laughing and turned towards their teacher.</p>
<p>“There are still death eaters left to sentence, Miss Granger.” Ron rolled his eyes. “Just throw the lot in Azkaban.” The professor gave a cursory once over towards Ronald and turned to Hermione and Harry. “And what do you two think about this?” Harry shrugged and Hermione cleared her throat.</p>
<p>“I think that they should all be held up for trial. Not every death eater is evil. Some simply didn’t have a choice when Voldemort took over. It was either join or die.” Hermione ignored Ron’s exasperated expression and continued, “Personally, I think a lot of them might even be under the imperius curse. We cannot send someone to Azkaban without being absolutely sure that they are evil.”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall smiled proudly and nodded, “exactly what we are trying to do Miss Granger.” She turned towards the two boys, “we need both of you and Miss Granger in the judgment chambers. The trials of some of the more dominant death eaters is going to begin.” She smiled once more at the trio before saying “I am proud of you three.” And hurrying away.</p>
<p>Hermione beamed at her friends. She jumped a little as both the twins joined them. <br/> “Ron.” Said George. <br/> “You’re needed.” Said Fred.<br/> Ron smiled at his brothers, he was extremely happy that the Weasleys had survived the battle alive. “Why?” <br/> The twins looked at each other than screamed in harmony, “They’re making dad the new minister!!!” Hermione gaped at both twins as Harry and Ron whooped and laughed – a big smile appearing on her face. Nothing could destroy the euphoria she felt right now.</p>
<p>“They thought about Dumbledore first but he wanted to stay headmaster, they thought about Kingsley but he said he wanted to stay an auror. So dad was nominated.” Fred continued and George chimed in, “they need statements from the family too and since we can’t choose our family,”<br/> “Your statement is needed twerp.” Fred finished. Ron smiled and hugged Harry and Hermione before hurrying away with his brothers.</p>
<p>Harry was whipped away by a journalist who wanted a statement and Hermione found herself walking alone in the corridor leading to the judgment chambers. As she turned a corner she saw Andromeda walking from the other end talking animatedly to someone. Her hair bright pink and her eyes shining. Hermione started towards her but stopped when she noticed who Andromeda was walking <em>with</em>. Silver blonde hair, and the same walk of power and arrogance – Draco Malfoy, renowned death eater.</p>
<p>Hermione’s mouth opened in surprise when she noticed that Draco was <em>not </em>in shackles, he wasn’t even restrained. Andromeda and Draco walked past her. Hermione stared at Malfoy. He stared back at her with his gray eyes. While his stare had always held prejudice and contempt before today it was different. His eyes looked tired but had a shine in hem. Both were hidden behind two incredibly dark circles that only made his already creamy complexion look even paler. The years had not been kind to him. There was a good chance that his exhaustion even rivaled her own. It looked like he had not slept in months, maybe longer.</p>
<p>But when his gaze met hers, he grinned a wide grin and Hermione’s already open mouth opened wider. He held the stare for a moment more before winking at her and passing Hermione. Andromeda hadn’t noticed her standing there and continued talking to her nephew.</p>
<p>Hermione kept standing there, trying to wrap her mind around what had just happened. She was still standing when Harry and Ron caught up with her. They stood behind her trying to look at whatever she was looking at before Ron waved his hand in front of her, “Earth to Hermione.” She broke out of her reverie. <br/> “You all right?” Harry asked. Hermione looked at him and nodded before walking again towards court.</p>
<p>                                                          XXXXXXXX</p>
<p>“Rodopholus Lestrange is sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban prison for the killing and terrorizing of innocent muggles and muggle-borns and aiding Voldemort with no evidence of being imperiused.”  Professor Flitwick announced.</p>
<p>Three death eaters had already been sentenced to the same punishment – Stuart Parkinson, Yaxley and Walden Macnair. Harry, Ron and Hermione were sitting with their teachers, the Weasley family, Hagrid in the second row. Dumbledore and the order of the phoenix sat in the first row. The rows overlooked a small platform upon which the criminal stood – awaiting trial. Professor Flitwick stood beside the platform jotting down the details on a piece of parchment.</p>
<p>As Rodopholus was led away, professor Flitwick looked at Dumbledore and nodded once. Dumbledore nodded back and stood up. Hermione turned a little to see her headmaster clearly. He smiled before speaking loudly, “The next trial is a <em>very </em>peculiar case and I want you all,” he looked towards the trio, “to keep your minds open and your hearts clear.” He turned back and nodded towards Flitwick who spoke loudly, “Draco Malfoy.” Hermione straightened up in her chair. Her eyes fixed at the door. From the movement beside her, Harry and Ron were doing the same.</p>
<p>All the previous accused were led in by aurors but Draco Malfoy ambled in –  with a small smile on his face, his eyes shining – with Severus Snape (who had already been vouched for by Harry and Dumbledore and cleared of all charges). He wasn’t restrained and Hermione could see his wand poking out of his jeans. She wasn’t the only one that noticed because as soon as Draco was on the platform, Ron was standing, “Someone take his wand.”</p>
<p>Draco’s smile grew, “I know wandless magic, Weasley.” Ron opened his mouth to say something but was cut off when Dumbledore stood up and shot him a sharp look, “please calm down Mr. Weasley.” Harry pursed his eyebrows, “But professor…” Dumbledore’s gaze went from Ron to Harry. “Let me explain, children, why Mr. Malfoy still has his wand.” <em>And isn’t restrained, </em>Hermione thought.</p>
<p>He waited for Harry to nod before sitting down and giving Snape an A-Okay sign. Snape cleared his throat, “Mr. Malfoy still has his wand and is not restrained” – he glanced briefly towards Hermione, <em>is he reading my thoughts?</em> She thought – before droning on, “Because he is innocent.”</p>
<p>Shouts of outrage filled the chambers and immediately stopped as Dumbledore stood up again – “Silence!!!” he boomed. “Continue Severus.” Snape nodded, “Mr. Malfoy has been working as a spy since birth, aiding me and his father. He has been learning occlumency from me as soon as he could talk. There is no one more skilled at legilemency than him – not even me.” Hermione gasped and glanced at Ron who was red with anger. Harry stood up, “And how are we supposed to believe this?”</p>
<p>Snape looked at Harry before smiling slightly. “Dumbledore and a few other members of the order knew that the Malfoys were spies for the order since the very beginning. Lucius has helped me keep my cover on several occasions even if it meant receiving the cruciatus curse. He has taken the blame for my shortcomings. He has been tortured, beaten and ridiculed multiple times simply so I could stay in Voldemort’s good graces. Narcissa has helped Draco on several occasions and let’s not forget,” Snape glanced at Harry. “She saved Mr. Potter’s life.”</p>
<p>Ron lost all patience as he stood up “Oh please, this coward has done nothing but tried to kill us since day one.” Draco spoke for the first time since entering the chamber, his eyes glinting. “Have I, Weasley?” “Yes.” Ron spat.</p>
<p>Draco took a deep breath before looking at Flitwick, who nodded and spoke, “Ms. Granger, Mr. Potter and Mr. Weasley please stand up.” Hermione took a deep breath before straightening her robes and standing up. Her friends followed suit. Flitwick motioned towards Draco who began, “I have always been near you three, not to <em>kill </em>you but to <em>protect </em>you. I even tried to befriend Potter to stay close to him. But when you wouldn’t be friends I became the next best thing – an enemy.” Before Ron could say something, Hermione – overwhelmed by curiosity spoke – “Protect us how?” Draco turned towards her, the corner of his mouth lifting upwards. “World cup? Fourth year?”</p>
<p>And it came back to her – death eaters, looking for muggle borns, the dark mark – and <em>him. </em>He had warned her.<br/>                                          <em>Keep that bushy head down, Granger. <br/> </em>“Exactly” Draco said and Hermione realized she had talked out loud. “You warned me?” Draco nodded, “Chamber of secrets, second year, library?” Hermione saw it, the page about basilisks, she had found it on the floor. Waiting there. As if someone… “You left the page?” she gasped and looked up at Draco who smiled “course I did.” he continued, “And not just that. I helped you <em>all</em>. During triwizard, I combined my accio with Potter’s to make it strong enough for the broom. During first year I left the book about Nicholas Flamel on your desk Granger.”</p>
<p>“Just because you left a book here and there doesn’t make you a spy, Malfoy.” Ron spat. Snape spoke up, “he has been providing information to the order for over two years, keeping his mind locked from Voldemort, trying to keep his death eater persona up Mr. Weasley.” Ron opened his mouth to retort but Draco cut him off.</p>
<p>“I’ve helped <em>you </em>too Weasley.” He began, “Your brother, the twin, Dolohov had him cornered, wandless. I killed Dolohov to save him just now.” Ron’s face lost color as Fred stood up and corroborated Malfoy’s statement. “He saved me too.” Andromeda said. “Voldemort had caught me and was going to kill me. He helped me escape.” Hermione looked at Harry – whose face was unreadable.</p>
<p>Dumbledore stood up. “Ms. Granger. When you were at the Malfoy Manor, Bellatrix cut your arm. Tell me what happened.” Hermione took a deep breath as the words <em>mudblood </em>burned a bit on her arm. “She used a curse, a very painful one. One which is supposed to hurt more than the cruciatus curse but…” Hermione’s eyes opened wide as her face lost color. <br/> “But?” asked Dumbledore.<br/>  She looked at Draco, “It didn’t hurt that much… but how… What did you do?” Draco looked at the floor before mumbling a small “numbing charm.” He looked up at Harry. “I also let you take my wand without a fight when you were at the manor.” Harry nodded. “And the time turner during third year. That was also my idea.” He motioned towards Hermione.</p>
<p>“Please sit down everyone.” Dumbledore began. Everyone took their seats and he continued, “Draco knows about the horcruxes and helped me destroy one of them and destroyed another alone.” <em>The ring, </em>Hermione thought<em> but another one...</em> “Alone?” she mumbled and Harry shrugged.</p>
<p>“Yes, Ms. Granger. There was one more I did not tell you about. Draco destroyed it for us and I assure you. We could not have done it without him.” “What was it?” Harry asked. “A jeweled hairpin. It belonged to Tom Riddle’s girlfriend.” Hermione gasped “Voldemort had a…” Dumbledore smiled at her. “Indeed the dark lord was a peculiar child but he<em> was</em> a boy.” He winked playfully at the crowd. “What happened to her?” “She disappeared Ms. Granger. And Draco found out about her while going through the old Hogwarts records. There was a picture and Tom Riddle had his arm around the girl. Us aurors would have thought nothing of it but Draco did.”<br/> “And what did he do?” Harry asked. <br/> “He asked everyone he could. Turned every page around. Spent months awake going through the old records and everything he could find out about the girl. Every picture, every mention of her name until he noticed something peculiar. He noticed she always wore a bejeweled hairpin.”</p>
<p>“It looked familiar.” Draco said. “I had seen it before. Inside my house, I was sure.”<br/> “So?” Hermione said. <br/> “So I turned the house upside down till I found it.” “He nearly died while doing so.”  Dumbledore said while Draco waved his hand absently. <br/> “What did you do once you found it?” asked Ron. <br/> “I took it to professor Dumbledore. I didn’t know about horcruxes then, just thought it could be a cursed object or something. Dumbledore told me about them and gave me the sword you know… the one that belonged to Godric Gryffindor.” <br/> Hermione and Harry nodded. Ron grunted. “And…I killed the thing.” Draco smiled, obviously very proud of himself. <br/> “Did it… fight you?” Hermione asked and Draco’s already pale face became paler as his eyes glazed over. Hermione bit her cheek – immediately regretting her question. <br/> “Ms. Granger, Draco would rather not talk about it just now.” Dumbledore said kindly and Hermione nodded. Dumbledore thought for a moment before continuing. </p>
<p>“We simply could not have killed Voldemort if it had not been for the keen eyes of Draco. Even I missed the possibility of any <em>romance</em> in Tom Riddle’s life but Draco picked it up immediately and devoted all his efforts to finding that hairpin.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked at Hermione, “He also saved your parents.” Suddenly Hermione couldn’t breathe. They did not remember her anymore. Why would they be targeted? “What?” “The death eaters tracked them and brought them to the manor with a mind to torture them to death or worse – insanity. They didn’t know they were your parents. Simply muggles who had crossed their paths. They found your mother… pretty.” Hermione gasped as her hand flew to cover her mouth. She looked on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>“Nothing happened Granger, trust me.” Draco said. “Draco saw an opportunity and restored their memories before helping them escape and delivering them to the order. You can meet them soon enough.” Dumbledore finished.</p>
<p>Hermione looked at Malfoy – her sworn enemy since first year and felt gratitude so deep, her eyes began to tear again. “I vouch for Draco Malfoy as innocent.” Draco looked at her and grinned. <br/>  “Here here!” Drawled Severus Snape. <br/> “I vouch for Draco Malfoy as innocent.” Said Fred. <br/> “I vouch for Draco Malfoy as innocent.” Said George.  <br/> “I vouch for Draco Malfoy as innocent.” Said Dumbledore. <br/> “I vouch for Draco Malfoy as innocent.” Said Snape. <br/> “I vouch for Draco Malfoy as innocent.” Said Andromeda. <br/> “I vouch for Draco Malfoy as innocent.” Said Kingsley. <br/> “I vouch for Draco Malfoy as innocent.” Said Harry Potter. “Draco Malfoy – is cleared of all charges and released as a free citizen…and a hero,” Flitwick said.</p>
<p>And the journalist took a picture there and then, which was printed in the following day’s prophet. It was an article telling of Draco’s innocence. A smiling Draco was at the top and under him was the headline. “THE GOLDEN TRIO PLUS ONE.” </p>
