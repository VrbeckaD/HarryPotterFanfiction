    <p>“Go on a date with me, (Y/N).”</p>
<p>(Y/N) choked on her bread mid-chew, struggling to breathe, as the boy in front of her panicked.</p>
<p>“Water! She needs water!” He shouted dramatically, to no one in particular. She couldn’t decide if he was deliberately ignoring the water pitcher right in front of him.</p>
<p>Others at their table paused their dining, watching the scene unfold.</p>
<p>“Ak-!” She sputtered, finally reaching for her glass filled with pumpkin juice. With a long gulp, she successfully forced her food down with the drink. “James Fleamont Potter! You do not scare someone while they have food in their mouth!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, love.” James apologized, although not very sincerely, from the smirk on his face. “I didn’t think asking you out on a date would make you choke yourself to death. A simple no would’ve sufficed.”</p>
<p>His teasing was met with a biscuit thrown at his face- which he quickly caught before it hit his nose, much to (Y/N)’s dismay. She was tempted to throw another one, but she knew he would catch it regardless, thanks to his quidditch reflexes.</p>
<p>“What on bloody earth made you think I would go on a date with you, Prongs?”</p>
<p>James smiled, making his friend furrow her brows in confusion.</p>
<p>“Because, Moony thinks Lily will finally say yes, the next time I ask her out!” He exclaimed, gesturing with his hands animatedly in the air.</p>
<p>“Great. So ask her out then, doofus.”</p>
<p>“I can’t. Not yet at least. Not before I think of the most romantic, best date ever, that will make her want to become Mrs. James Potter by the end of it.” James replied, like it was the most obvious answer in the world. “And that’s where you come in. You can be my guinea pig.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, let me think…” She saw James’ eye light up in anticipation. “No.”</p>
<p>“Come on, love! You just need to go on the planned date with me and tell me what I should fix.”</p>
<p>“While I would love to tell you what you need to fix about yourself,” she grabbed his hand in a comforting gesture, “-which is a lot, I’m going to have to pass.” She patted his hand with a sad smile, ignoring his offended expression and returning to her plate of food.</p>
<p>“Come on, (Y/N). It’s not like you’ve got anything better to do this weekend.”</p>
<p>“You do know I have other friends than you and the rest of your group?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you mean our group?”</p>
<p>“Not this weekend I don’t.”</p>
<p>He took away her plate of food, just as she was about to grab another forkful.</p>
<p>“C'mon.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Please?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Not even for your best friend?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Fine! If you help me, I’ll do your Potions homework for a week.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“A month!”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“A year!!”</p>
<p>(Y/N) scoffed at his offer. “Please, you and I both know you don’t even do you own homework.”</p>
<p>“Ugh! You’re so frustrating, (Y/N)!”</p>
<p>“Good. Now leave me alone,” she responded, grabbing back her plate.</p>
<p>Thankfully, she was saved from a response by Sirius, who decided to sit down and distract him with talks of another prank.</p>
<p>And with a biscuit in hand, she quickly fled the scene before James could notice, and proceeded to avoid him for the rest of the day.</p>
