  <span>When the truth had come out that </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bellatrix Lestrange </span>
  </em>
  <span>had been the unsung hero of the Order of the Phoenix, the double agent so deeply embroiled in the dark that she no longer cast a distinguishable shadow, Hermione was doubtful to say the least. Bellatrix was not the professor in the headmaster’s pocket, whose loyalties were constantly tested by whoever had the upper hand on the day. Bellatrix was not the repentant recruit who had been dragged into the business by her father. She was no sleeper agent, nor assassin. Bellatrix was just a Death Eater who happened to say some very interesting information in front of people whose loyalties could not be assured, who happened to boast about her role in upcoming assaults to people who would love to see her fail, who hissed hints about a certain Gringotts vault to little mudblood girls. Who shot her Lord in the back with an Avada Kedavra. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But some scars remained. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no telling where Bellatrix the lieutenant ended or where Bellatrix the traitor began, and Hermione had to guess that the woman herself would be unable to draw the line. Bellatrix never swore an unbreakable vow to Dumbledore, and in fact had nearly nothing to do with him- and she liked it that way. She wasn’t beholden to the Order and all of its flaws. Her loyalty to her sisters was about the only thing she held any true investment in, but so long as they were alive she was willing to sow the seeds of destruction in the cracks of Voldemort’s ivory veneer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then she met Hermione, not for the first time but for the first time since replacing her Death Eater mask with a new one. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione, ever the detective, decided her new goal was to figure out the </span>
  <em>
    <span>real </span>
  </em>
  <span>Bellatrix Lestrange. She wanted to figure out where the woman </span>
  <em>
    <span>really </span>
  </em>
  <span>stood, how well she could be trusted not to regress into a volatile beast, why she felt the need to risk her life, health and sanity for her sisters but was happy to sacrifice her cousin for the cause. She’d run out of things to do since Voldemort’s death, anyhow, so her new project took up most of her time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione saw the first signs when they met up at a ball- some soiree held in France, dedicated to celebrating the anniversary of the Dark Lord’s death. Bellatrix was wrapped up in black of course, with bold red trims that screamed of blood rather than the valiant Gryffindor hues of victory. She was cold to the touch, which Hermione knew because her hands pressed against the bare skin of an exposed shoulder as they waltzed together. Yes, Hermione saw the signs. But she ignored them, because those blood red lips capturing her own could be very distracting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What Hermione could deduce, first and foremost, was that Bellatrix was a through-and-through Slytherin. Not just for the cunning that betraying the Dark Lord required, as that was a given, but also for the way snakes seemed to brave the open spaces of the outdoors just to bask in her presence, and for the way her tongue slithered across open planes of skin to settle between a pair of battle hardened thighs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bellatrix had a way of always getting what she wanted. To others, a stern tone and a commanding presence was enough to send them running to comply with her requests, to Hermione, a smile and batted eyelids, and a suggestive eyebrow raise. And who was Hermione to deny her? Nobody else did, so who was she to buck the trend? Despite being such a controversial figure, people fell over themselves to tend to her whims. She was a hero now, didn’t you hear? There was just something about Bellatrix, Hermione decided, that made people want to serve her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione thought she’d had her figured out a little more when she revealed her collection of photographs. She was a sentimental person, who held love for very few- but for those she did, she did with such vigour that it was near aggressive. A photo album began with images of bouncing baby girls, three sisters so alike but so very different. They aged across the pages, pulling each other’s hair and tugging on each other’s matching dresses even as they traded ribbons for pearls and mud for makeup. There was even a photograph of Bellatrix and her sisters alongside her as she stood in her white lace wedding dress. The album was absent of her husband. And when Hermione turned the page again, there was a new familiar face. Her own. That there was space for her in Bellatrix’s exclusive but passionate heart was all she needed to know. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Hermione offered her the ring, Bellatrix treasured that too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>One cold December morning they lay tangled underneath the sheets, pale limbs clinging together in search of warmth and something more. A hand skittered over a shoulder, past knotted and bed crunched curls, to rest on an elegant cheekbone. Bleary eyes flickered open, and they were crimson. Only for half a second, before melting away into sleepy dark chocolate,  but it was half a second enough to freeze Hermione’s heart.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bellatrix frowned at the shock carved out on her wife’s face, and willed it away with a gentle squeeze of her palm onto Hermione’s hand. Hermione’s face smoothed somewhat, and she sunk back into the bed with a tired exhale. A kiss pressed against her collarbone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it, love?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re his Horcrux,” Hermione whispered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both knew it all along, but there was no more denying it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to tell anyone?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione shifted her head to look down at Bellatrix, tucked away in the crook of her neck, and knew there was no way she could ever oust her the way she had done her Lord. This was the woman who she knew inside and out, who once held pureblood ideologies but shelved them for the sake of her sister, who sat through fourteen years of imprisonment in Azkaban with only dementors for company because she was certain Voldemort wasn’t truly dead, who liked a spoonful of honey rather than sugar with her tea. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was the woman she loved. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In figuring out the real Bellatrix Lestrange, Hermione found that she had figured out a part of Voldemort too. They were part of the same person now, after all. But Bellatrix had love, the most powerful kind of magic of all. And with Voldemort’s guidance, and Hermione’s protection, there was nothing that could stop them. </span>
