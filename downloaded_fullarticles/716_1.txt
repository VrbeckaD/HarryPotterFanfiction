    <p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Hermione, Harry and Ron, were invited to a christmas dinner at Malfoy Manor three years after the war.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Actually it was the third time Narcissa had invited Hermione, but Hermione couldn't come the first two times...</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">And actually Hermione had invited Ron, because he was one of her best friends still.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco and Harry, and Hermione and Draco had started writing letters, and at their arrival, Draco hugged Harry tight, and also looked at Hermione, who gave him a gentle smile, before he also hugged her.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Hey Draco..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Hey, Mione..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Malfoy..." Ron greeted Draco, and Draco only gave him a cold nod.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Come... I'll bring you into our parlour." Draco said, and led them upstairs, and Hermione hissed: ,,Could you please behave yourself?! We are guests here..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,The last time, we were "guests" here, his mother's deranged sister tried to kill you, Mione... Oh wait, I've forgotten. This is like your second home, since you've decided to study potions by that bitch..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,If my sister wanted to kill her, she would be dead." Ron was interrupted by a voice from behind them, and Hermione turned around, and smiled at the older witch.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Hello Narcissa..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Narcissa smiled back, and kissed Hermione's cheek.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Hello Darling..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Hermione blushed heavyly, and Ron rolled his eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Harry." she greeted him, and he also greeted her back.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,And of course... Grinch number two." Narcissa said, and looked at Ron. ,,Don't give that gaze. You look like my stupid ex husband..." she muttered and led them all into the parlour...</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Lucius Malfoy was very quiet during the dinner, until his silence became very uncomfortable, and once in a while, Hermione took a glance at him...</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Alright." he said out of sudden, and everyone at the table flinched a bit. Except of Narcissa, who just eat her meal.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,I do understand, why my ex wife is celebrating in this house, after she had had a little accident in her own Manor a few days ago, and because my son and I are still under this stupid arrest, but..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Are you alright...?" Hermione whispered, and Narcissa nodded and gave her a small smile.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Shut up, mudblood, you are just the student of my ex wife."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Lucius, before you continue..." Narcissa said gently, and he looked at her.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Don't make a fool of yourself."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Lucius thought about it for a moment, before he continued: ,,This house once belonged to a proud family, of purebloods and their pureblood friends..."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,And he makes a fool of himself..." Narcissa muttered.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,And now... three years after the fall of the dark lord, it is the guest house, of a fag, a blood traitor, and a fucked up mudblood, who is just the student of my ex wife, who apparently had lost any pureblood pride."</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,Alright, asshole..." Hermione started, and stood up.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">,,You dare to talk to me in my own house, you filthy litte mudblood?!" Lucius asked, and Hermione nodded: ,,I do, and first of all, he is no fag, he is my best friend, and imagine that, Draco became my best friend too. Second, Ron might be have a huge lack of manners, but I invited him. And yes, I am a filthy little mudblood. Bellatrix had made that very clear, and I'm sure the whole wizarding world knows that since a few years now, but... your ex wife did not lost any stupid pride, she's a brillant witch, a great teacher for me, and the most important thing, she is no inhibited human like you are. And third, it is christmas for the love of Merlin, so could you please just shut the fuck up, and pretend for a few hours, that you are not the Grinch, who has a stick in his ass?!"</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">With that she sat back down, and Draco, Harry and Ron must held back a laughter, Lucius continued with his meal, and Narcissa leaned in, and whispered: ,,When this meal is over, I will show you, how less you are "just" my student..."</span>
