    <p>Chapter 1.</p><p>'Warm summer is the season which our adventur and war end, in return with a peaceful and normal life... but in my opinio, it's always a begging of a new bloody quest.' Annabeth read.</p><p>'Do you really know how to write a poem, Perseus Jackson? Although your poem is horribly similar to our life, but unfortunately, your style is not the one like Will said.' Annabeth said to him while shaking her head.</p><p>'Also, your "adventure" and "opinion" spelled wrong.' Like Percy Jackson was not stupid enough, she added.</p><p>Our big hero, Percy Jackson, frowned at her girlfriend's cruel respond. 'You have always known that I have a serious problem of dyslexia, and I have ADHD, so it is already a miracle that I wrote you a poem.' He said unhappily like a 5 year old children who didn't get the last cake (and it's blue!), but Annabeth just rolled her eyes.</p><p>'Try this,' Annabeth said, while throwing her perfectly written poem at him.</p><p>He caught it in the mid- air, put the paper near to his eyes and read:</p><p>'Summer draws near,</p><p>Where wars end further,</p><p>But with a strike of lighting,</p><p>It always means a new mission coming.</p><p>Oh how I hope there is a happy ending,</p><p>Like the tales my daddy kept saying.'</p><p>'... Of course yours are better than mine! You are the Owl head I am not! You- ' Guess who said that.</p><p>'Hey darlings, sorry for disturbing your sweet little talk, but that ghost boy is finding you guys.' said Drew, who came here for not learning how to write poems, but to flirt with Will.</p><p>Not wanting to be shadow travelled suddenly, they ran out to meet a very annoyed Nico, who crossed his arm and waited them impatiently.</p><p>'Have you guys done fighting? I can literally hear you from China.' said Nico with the sound like an angry kitten.(A kitten with sharp teeth and claws.)</p><p>'Hey death boy! Oh no, have you been shadow travelling again? You have to--'shouted a now looking at them Will, completely ignored the 'showing-her-incredible-beauty -and-get-Will-in-her-bed' Drew.</p><p>'JUST GET US TO WHERE WE HAVE TO GO OR I WILL KICK YOU TO THE SKY NICO DI ANGELO!' Annabeth exclaimed, not wanting to see more flirting between these two 'I-am-a-bright-sun-and-everyone-knows-I-like-Nico-di-Angelo-except-Nico-di-Angelo' and 'I-hate-the-world-but-i-love-Will-Solace-that-hot-guy' and grabbed her dear boyfriend and cousin to the nearest shadow.</p><p>The boys look at each other, one afraid that himself would be strangled by his girlfriend, one afraid that himself would be throw to the sky and got stricken, with both boys afraid of Annabeth's anger the was much horrible than Zeus, Nico di Angelo used his fastest time to shadow travel them to:</p><p> The Big House.</p><p>...........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</p><p>'Thank you, heroes, for coming to the meeting of today.' said Chiron. 'As you have seen-' He tried to not notice two boys and a girl screaming when they fell from the shadow which was on the ceiling. '-Lady Hecate is here today-' and tried not to fight back the heroes surprised and annoyed sighs. '-to inform us a new quest.' And finally completed his short sentence.</p><p>A silence.</p><p>The beautiful Lady at the back of the room, stood up, and used her stunning purple eyes to look at the heroes.</p><p>The boy on the left, Frank Zhang, whose eyes showed his worries;</p><p>The girl next to him, Hazel Lévesque, well they met once;</p><p>The lonely boy sat in the shadow of Hazel, Nico di Angelo, showed a blank face, but with slightly shaking hands;</p><p>The girl sat on the sofa, Piper McLean, was wondering if charmspeaking can be used on goddess;</p><p>The blond boy that stand behind her, Jason Grace, made the electricity in the room sparkled;</p><p>The boy that hugged the blond girl Annabeth Chase, Percy Jackson, his eyes showed anger and tiredness towards the gods;</p><p>The girl with black hair, Thalia Grace, showed confidence, but there were also fear in her blue eyes.</p><p>'Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, Jason Grace, Piper McLean, Frank Zhang, Hazel Lévesque, Nico di Angelo and Thalia Grace, I am here to give you a new quest, a new mission... to gain glories.' Hecate said softly.</p><p>We were never here to gain glory, all the war heroes thought. We never said that we would like to have missions to cause more blood and deaths.</p><p>'As you have seen, not all the gods are willing to give blessings to heroes, not to mention mortals. As for me, I am generous enough to give some magic blessings to some mortal. For a long time, they had a peaceful life and their magic talent grew stronger, but like every human, they forgot my blessings . When their magic talent was shown to other mortal without magic talent , they were forced to be underground, and was under-covered until today.' The magic Lady closed her eyes, the thousands years of the world's memories flashed through her brain.</p><p>'And today, their numerous history is glorious, but it was built by millions of wizards and witches, sweat, tears and blood.' The pain of the lost of the wizard world pained her.</p><p>'And now, a prophecy of years ago reappeared, and it controlled the whole world's future, especially the magic world, whether we can keep our normal life, or our beautiful world will be turned into Hell...'</p><p>None of the people in the room were pleased by her word.</p><p>Actually, they were terrified.</p><p>Even though many of them didn't go through hell, but it was sure that it is not the perfect place to go on summer vacations, having drinks with little umbrella on top.</p><p>'Now heroes , I grant you a quest... a quest to defeat Tartarus.'</p><p>A complete silence. A completely uncomfortable silence. A completely uncomfortable, terrible silence.</p><p>...Even the air have the smell of fear.</p><p>'But excuse me, Lady Hecate, I am pretty sure me and the Romans' have defeated Tartarus before this war, am I correct?' Jason asked.</p><p>Hecate sighed. 'Mr Grace, war never ends. It was just a little war in Tartarus opinion. This war is a war that begins years ago... And it continued until now.'</p><p>'What is the prophecy?' Annabeth asked confidently. As the strongest and smartest girl on team, she understands that she need more information about the quest.</p><p>Hecate took a deep breath.</p><p>'You shall go to Hell,</p><p>Say goodbye to the one you tell.</p><p>Pain and death you shall seek,</p><p>And love shall make you weak.</p><p>Go back to your home by own,</p><p>And stay forever alone.</p><p>Until the shadow and bones,</p><p>Stayed with you for 90.'</p><p>The poem that slide from Lady Hecate's beautiful mouth was shocking. Not liking others prophecies they have heard, it was horribly simple, clearly said that someone will die, and have already had. This is a short poem, but it was like a blade with poisons, you could feel the coldness of deepest fear, and the hopelessness have already got into your mind, like a sliding black snake.</p><p>'It is not the prophecy that is for us, right?' Thalia asked calmly.</p><p>'No... It was for a young, brilliant, brave girl that bravely took this mission... But it have taken her to much...She have lost too much: family, lover, hope, sanctity, honour... She was a hero, but Tartarus killed her everything.'</p><p>...</p><p>'Mmmmm... So Lady, may I ask you that where their mission locate?' Chiron used a fake calm voice to politely ask.</p><p>The purple eyes looked into the dark grey eyes.</p><p>'Hogwarts, England.'</p><p>...........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</p><p>Miles away, a dark haired boy putted his wand down. They had won this war.</p><p>He's dead.</p><p>He-who-must-not-be-named is dead.</p><p>Voldemort is dead.</p><p>The boy, Harry Potter, thought blankly,</p><p>before wales of cheers hit him.</p>
