    <p align="center">I plan on making a few more like these for the same series, so keep an eye out! d(￣◇￣)b this first character is Ciro, an original character in the fic. He doesn’t spend too much time in there at all, we don’t actually ever REALLy get to meet him, but he’s still important to the story so I wanted to draw him &lt;3<br/>

This method of hanging was a common punishment at the time for traitors in Italy. However, the solemn expression on his face traditionally suggests that he is there by his own accord, and the card is meant to represent self-sacrifice more so than it does corporal punishment or criminality.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>
