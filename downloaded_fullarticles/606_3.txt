    <p>“I-it was the last DA meeting,” the wizard crumpled before him stuttered out, limbs twitching in the aftermath of Lord Voldemort’s powerful curses. Long had the man tried to resist, but in the end, all fell before the dark lord. “We were working on our animagus forms. There was an e-explosion,” the man panted, forcing his words out between wheezes. </p><p>“And then?” Voldemort demanded when the man - Macmillan - fell silent, gasping quietly in pain.</p><p>“G-gone,” the man sobbed. They disappeared. The three of them. Just… gone. No one has seen them since.” Despair coated his words, his hope lost with the disappearance of the golden trio.</p><p>“How did this happen?” The dark lord leaned forward, eyes narrowed. “Why? Did someone betray them? A spell gone awry? Tell me, blood traitor. Tell me what you know.”</p><p>“I - I don’t!” Macmillan denied fervently. “I don’t know why it happened. Or how. All I know is that one moment they were there and the next they weren’t. I swear, I don’t know anything else!”</p><p>Voldemort sat back, disappointed that he could learn no more from this man. For three years now he had been hunting the infernal golden trio after they had disappeared during their sixth year at Hogwarts. His victory had been swift with none strong enough to oppose him, but it felt hollow. Incomplete. As if he had cheated his way to power.</p><p>So now he hunted. He would find them and destroy them, ensuring his win, his indomitable reign. </p><p>Severus discouraged his obsession, claiming that they had likely killed themselves in their foolish endeavours, but Voldemort was not so sure. He had a connection with Harry Potter, after all. One that he did not fully understand, yet could not deny. And it irked him that the Chosen One could elude him for so long, despite their strange connection. </p><p>At one point Voldemort had used the connection to his advantage - had manipulated the Potter boy to his will. But now the link seemed… distant. Faded. As if something was interfering with it.</p><p>And it angered Voldemort to think that someone else might have gotten their hands on what belonged to <em> him </em>.</p><p>A wave of his hand had one of his Death Eaters scurrying to remove the sobbing blood traitor from his presence, and he sat back on his throne, a hand reaching up to stroke his chin in thought. If what Macmillan said was true and they had been practicing their animagus transformations, then perhaps there was a different explanation for the warped link. Because while similar, animal and human brains did not work the same way. </p><p>More than once he had sent his consciousness into Nagini’s mind to spy through her eyes. And it always took him a few moments to reorient his thoughts to suit the way Nagini’s mind worked. </p><p>So then, perhaps…</p><p>A hint of a suspicion flittered across his mind, but it was gone before he could quite comprehend it. Nonetheless, he dismissed his Death Eaters and sat for a long moment in the silence of the hall, with only the sound of his breathing to accompany him.</p><p>Large and empty, the room felt as hollow as his victory.</p><p>Closing his eyes, Voldemort ignored the stifling emptiness of his surroundings and instead fell inwards into his mind, to the link he had come to know so very well. </p><p>Once white-hot and electrifying, now it lay almost docile, flowing in a slow and steady beat, muted but for the odd pulse that jumped upon the rare occasion.</p><p>He approached it slowly and brushed alongside the tantalizing river of energy and magic - one that made him want to devour what was on the other end. To keep it inside him forever. </p><p>Voldemort pushed away his possessiveness - for such desire would not aide him now. Instead he settled into his baser instincts - those of survival. Of hunger and fear. Of curiosity and wariness.</p><p>Remembering how it felt to be a part of Nagini’s mind, Voldemort merged with the flow that linked him and Harry Potter. He released all human thoughts, all complexities of emotions, and drifted forward, slow and subtle, like the snake that he was.</p><p>It grew lighter the further he went. There was the beginning of an image forming in his mind. Sunlight and sand. Water. The sound of birds. </p><p>It felt as if he had opened his eyes as the world around him flared to vivid clarity. It was mostly rocky, with coarse sand and bold blue water. There was lush foliage in the distance that was distinctly tropical. </p><p>Around him, dozens of black and white birds lingered, some tending to their young, others just returning from the sea, bellies full of fish. He himself was stretching, slightly warm from the summer sun. He - no, not he. Voldemort was no bird. But - </p><p>Triumph flashed through his veins and heated his thoughts and for a moment there was a strange dichotomy of victory and confusion colliding within his mind. Then his vision blurred and he opened his eyes to the black hall void of all life but his own.</p><p>And he smiled.</p><p>He had found Harry Potter. He knew where he was. His smile widened, his white teeth flashing in the darkness as he stood, his wand slipping into his hand. </p><p>He would have little need of it, of course, for Harry Potter in his animagus form was no threat to the all-powerful Lord Voldemort. But he would not put it past the boy to flee if given the opportunity. </p><p>He did not know what type of bird the boy was, but he would not risk Potter taking to the sky and losing him there.</p><p>Closing his eyes for a moment, he visualized the place he had seen, then spun on his heel and disappeared with a sharp <em> crack </em> of displaced air.</p><p>And he landed almost right on top of a snoozing penguin.</p><p>It squawked in alarm, rolling onto its side before bumbling upwards with a clumsy flailing of its flightless wings. It was small, Voldemort noticed as he watched it with narrowed eyes. It had the usual black and white feathers and unique markings around its eyes. But while the others had a trail of white that curled behind their eyes and down, this penguin’s markings looked suspiciously round, one circle around each eye, and a patch just above its eye that looked remarkably like a lightning bolt.</p><p>Voldemort stared.</p><p>The penguin stared back.</p><p>Then it turned, and began to waddle away as quickly as it could, its wings spread out for balance. </p><p>Voldemort watched as it hopped and slid, tripping twice, and then a third time, as it made its way away from him and towards the water.</p><p>Then his smile returned and he chuckled, a mocking sound that surely reached the penguin’s ears, for it seemed to redouble its efforts to get away from him.</p><p>How.. ado- Voldemort cut the thought off before it could fully form. He strode forward instead, catching up to the wayward wizard with ease. He bent down, and scooped the penguin up into his hands. </p><p>It squawked and wriggled, reaching down to try and peck at his hands, but he squeezed warningly and it froze, before relaxing into a helpless sulk. </p><p>It was surprisingly soft and warm, and it felt rather strong and healthy for a wizard who had spent so much time in its animagus form. </p><p>“I finally caught you, Harry Potter,” Voldemort said, his red eyes gleaming as they stared into the dark soulful eyes of the penguin in his arms. “I will give you this one opportunity to change back. Duel me properly, Harry Potter. Let us finish this.”</p><p>The penguin stared at him, then lowered its beak and chirped in bird-like mortification.</p><p>Voldemort raised a brow. “You can’t be serious,” he muttered. “You can change back, can you not?”</p><p>Its wings flapped half-heartedly</p><p>Voldemort stared for a moment longer. “Then I suppose,” he said, “I will have to bring you back with me until you can change back, that we might duel as equals.” Yes, they would duel, and Voldemort would win, and keep Harry as a prisoner - a prize, forever after.</p><p>It let out a sad croon, and Voldemort pursed his lips. “It is not <em> my </em> fault that you stuck yourself in this form.”</p><p>The penguin sighed.</p><p>Then there was a scrabbling noise behind the dark lord, the sound of two angry penguins, and the sudden feeling of two angry beaks trying to peck at his legs.</p><p>Glancing down, Voldemort saw two more penguins, one with a reddish tint to its feathers, and another that had strangely frizzy feathers. They were flapping their wings as if to give themselves further momentum in their attack, but they could not penetrate the thick robes he wore, nor the thick leather of his dragonhide boots.</p><p>He glanced at the penguin in his hands. It was staring at him with dark, liquid eyes, and Voldemort wondered if he should perhaps change his plans. He had a strange suspicion as to the identity of the two new penguins, and he tilted his head, eyes narrowed calculatingly.</p><p>Then he pulled Harry Potter closer and shifted him to sit in the crook of his left arm, a warm weight against his heart. With his right hand he flicked his wand, levitating what was undoubtedly Granger and Weasley, just as stuck as Harry Potter. They wriggled as they were held aloft in the air. </p><p>“You, Harry Potter, shall be coming with me. I won’t let you escape again. Not ever again.” A questioning chirrup came from the penguin in his arms. “And these two shall be my prisoners, to ensure your good behaviour. They will come to no harm, so long as you do not disobey me.”</p><p>Harry Potter wiggled in his little body, then lifted his beak and nibbled gently on the side of Voldemort’s jaw, a soft brush of understanding.</p><p>His skin tingling strangely from Potter’s touch, Voldemort gathered the two protesting penguins and apparated home.</p><p>He strode down the hall, still holding on to the three birds, as he did not trust them to obey his orders quite yet. He paused as he came upon his potions master.</p><p>“Ah, Severus,” he said, watching as the man’s eyes grew wide, his jaw dropping in uncharacteristic surprise. </p><p>“M-My Lord…”</p><p>“Prepare a room. A suitable habitat for these three.”</p><p>Severus’ eyes lingered on Harry Potter, still wide in slight disbelief, but nonetheless he bowed. “Of course, My Lord…” Weak as Severus’ voice might be, Voldemort was pleased to have such a loyal Death Eater in his service.</p><p>Voldemort nodded curtly. “Good. I expect it done within the hour.” Then he moved off again, this time towards the bathroom adjoined to his room. He would fill the bathtub and keep them in there until their room was ready. </p><p>“And if you respect me and my rules,” he told them as he placed them one by one into the water, “I shall allow you to wander freely outside of your room.”</p><p>A chorus of chirps rang out in response, and Voldemort nodded in satisfaction, standing and closing the door behind him. </p><p>Finally, he had caught his nemesis. His victory was final. None would stand to oppose him now, and Harry Potter would remain his, now and forever.</p><p>
