          <div class="userstuff"><p>“What?!”</p>
<p>Surely, Harry must’ve heard wrong. There was no way Slughorn would suggest that—</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, my boy, but the only way for you to pass my class is to get a tutor. Is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?” Professor Slughorn asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, but—”</p>
<p>“Then I’m afraid there is no other option.”</p>
<p>“But <em>Draco Malfoy</em>? We’ve been at each other's throats for years! Are you sure there’s no one else?”</p>
<p>“He is the only one with free time available.”</p>
<p>Harry sighed and gave up. “Alright,” he mumbled.</p>
<p>“Wonderful,” Professor Slughorn said. “Now, Mr. Malfoy has agreed to meet you here after dinner every other day.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Professor,” Harry said glumly.</p>
<p>“I’m sure it’ll be fine. Afterall, I don’t recall seeing Mr. Malfoy speak an awful lot this year. I’m sure he’s put whatever little grudge you had behind him.”</p>
<p>Harry doubted it, but he didn’t say anything. He explained the whole situation to Ron and Hermione at dinner. Ron reacted as expected, with a groan and a “rotten luck, mate,” however Hermione said something that surprised him.</p>
<p>“I think it could be good for the both of you.”</p>
<p>Harry and Ron looked at her like she had three heads.</p>
<p>Hermione sighed and rolled her eyes. “I mean, now’s a chance for you to stop your stupid rivalry. I dunno, he <em>did</em> help you in the war,” she said carefully. “And he’s all alone now. It’s all a bit… sad.”</p>
<p>Harry looked across the hall to where Draco was sitting at the edge of the Slytherin table. There was a very noticeable gap between him and the rest of the house. He felt a little pang in his gut. Was that guilt? Pity? Harry guessed Hermione was right. Not that that was a surprise to him.</p>
<p>The first meeting went relatively okay, though something about Malfoy unsettled Harry. There was nothing in his voice when he spoke. His grey eyes looked dull and lifeless. The hair that he usually gelled back, flopped down in front of his face, so that he had to keep pushing it away.</p>
<p>Okay, that last one didn’t unnerve him. He actually thought it suited Malfoy better. Not that he’d ever tell him that.</p>
<p>“Any questions?” Malfoy asked once he was done explaining something.</p>
<p>“Er—”</p>
<p>“Are you even paying attention, Potter?” he asked with the slightest bit of annoyance in his voice. At least it was a break from the monotone.</p>
<p>“Right. Sorry,” Harry said sheepishly. “Got a little distracted.”</p>
<p>Malfoy let out a sigh. “Potter, how are you supposed to brew the potions if you don’t know the theory? You’ll get hurt.”</p>
<p>“Since when do you care?”</p>
<p>Malfoy looked down at his book, flipping through it absentmindedly. “I don’t. I care that you’ll be brewing it around <em>me</em> and<em> I</em> could potentially get hurt as well.”</p>
<p>Harry let out a small laugh. “Typical.”</p>
<p>That was usually how the meetings went in the beginning. Malfoy would explain something, Harry would get distracted, and Malfoy would let out some snarky remark about how Harry’d get them both killed.</p>
<p>Harry liked those moments. It almost seemed like things were back to normal between them. Though, there was less malice than there was before the war. It seemed very… friendly. At first, Harry dismissed the thought. Him and Malfoy couldn’t be friends. But the more time passed, the more he realized that they <em>were</em>. They were more casual with each other. It felt less like Draco was tutoring him because he <em>had</em> to and more like Draco was helping out because he <em>wanted</em> to.</p>
<p>After about three month of tutoring, Draco walked into the Potions Classroom unusually late. “Sorry,” he said as he dropped his bag on the seat opposite Harry’s. “There’s mistletoe everywhere. I had to take the long way to avoid it. That, and I had to push through a crowd that was watching Romilda Vane and Anthony Goldstein snog.” Draco scrunched up his face in disgust.</p>
<p>Harry laughed. “Sounds traumatic.”</p>
<p>“I <em>was</em> traumatic. I’ll never get that image out of my head.” He tried to keep a straight face for as long as possible, but eventually his lips quirked up as he looked through his Potions textbook.</p>
<p>“Are we finally brewing today?” Harry asked. “I’m so bored of reading theory.”</p>
<p>“Amortentia is an extremely difficult potion. You need to know the theory or else it becomes toxic and combustible,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Harry waved him off, like nothing he’d said was of any importance. “So are we, or not?”</p>
<p>Draco sighed. “You’re a menace, Potter.”</p>
<p>Harry flashed him a smile.</p>
<p>Draco gave a small smile in return. “Alright, then. Let’s gather the ingredients.”</p>
<p>They both went rummaging through the supply cabinet and came out with everything they needed. While they brewed, they stood shoulder to shoulder. Draco read out the instructions and helped Harry chop everything up.</p>
<p>Halfway through, the recipe called for it to simmer for an hour. Harry had to deal with wait times like that back when he first started getting tutored as well. He always whined when he saw that particular instruction. Draco told him to grow up and that it wasn’t that long of a wait, but it didn’t stop Harry from pouting.</p>
<p>Now, Harry didn’t mind it so much. He put his feet up on the table and leaned back in his chair. Draco rolled his eyes and sat down next to him.</p>
<p>“How’d you get that cut?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Harry reached out and brushed his thumb over the top of Draco’s lip.</p>
<p>Draco coughed and looked down at his notebook. “Oh, right, that.” His face had gone slightly pink. “Er, we’re doing banishing spells in Charms and my partner doesn’t have very good aim so…” he trailed off.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Draco sighed. “He said it was an accident, but…”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head in anger. “Why didn’t you go to Madam Pomfrey? You know she could heal that in a second.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to bother her. I’m sure she has enough on her plate. Besides, it’ll go away on its own.”</p>
<p>They were silent for a moment.</p>
<p>“I could heal it for you,” Harry offered.</p>
<p>Draco let out a short laugh. “You?”</p>
<p>“Well, don’t look so surprised. Hermione taught me and Ron some healing spells last year, you know… when we were hunting for horcruxes and stuff,” Harry explained, his voice getting progressively quieter.</p>
<p>Draco gave him a look that he couldn’t decipher. “Okay,” he said after a while. “Go for it.”</p>
<p>Harry took his feet off the table and scooted closer to him. He grabbed Draco’s chin in his hand and held his wand up to the cut. The cut vanished in an instant. Harry lingered for a second, not sure why other than the fact that the scent of cedar came wafting off of the other boy.</p>
<p>Draco cleared his throat, pulling Harry out of his reverie. “T- thanks. Does it, er, look alright?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Harry said, a bit breathless. “Fine.”</p>
<p>Once the hour passed, there were only a couple more steps left. Those were done fairly quickly and soon the potion was done. Draco inhaled the fumes, a tiny grin appearing on his face.</p>
<p>“It’s— yeah, it’s good,” he said, avoiding Harry’s eyes. “You did well.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded. “Thanks.” He leaned over and smelled the potion for himself. The first two scents were the same as when he first smelled it in sixth year. Treacle tart and the woody smell of a broomstick handle. Though, the last smell was different. Cedar. Just like he’d smelled on Draco only minutes ago.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>“Er, Draco?” Harry said as Draco proceeded to vanish the potion and tidy up their work station.</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Can Amortentia change?”</p>
<p>Draco looked at him. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Like, the smell. Can it change?”</p>
<p>“I suppose it could. It smells of what attracts us and if something changes, the smell will change as well,” he explained. “Why? Has something changed for you?”</p>
<p>Harry felt his face heat up. “Er, yeah. I used to smell Ginny in there, but…”</p>
<p>“You don’t anymore,” Draco finished.</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>“So…” Draco started slowly. “What do you smell now?” There was something in his voice when he said that, though Harry couldn’t quite place it.</p>
<p>“Oh, er, it’s not important.”</p>
<p>Draco nodded. “Okay,” he said. Harry was glad that he dropped it. “I’ll see you on Friday.”</p>
<p>When he got back to the common room, he told Ron and Hermione about what happened.</p>
<p>Hermione laughed. “I knew it!”</p>
<p>“You what?” Harry said.</p>
<p>“What, you think you were obsessed with Malfoy in sixth year for fun?”</p>
<p>“He was up to something!”</p>
<p>Ron snorted. He had a hand covering his mouth to hide his amusement. “You have to admit, mate, it does sound like you’ve fancied him for a while.”</p>
<p>Harry groaned. “Not you too.”</p>
<p>“Did you tell him?” Hermione asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “I didn’t wanna scare him off, you know? This whole friend thing is so new.”</p>
<p>“Harry, are you thick? He likes you too, idiot,” Hermione said. Harry looked shocked. “C’mon. He constantly sought your attention for <em>years</em>. What would you call that?”</p>
<p>“A rivalry?” Harry guessed.</p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “Tell him when you next see him,” she said. Harry was about to protest, but she stopped him. “You’re not asking him out or anything. You’re just stating a fact.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“Look, after the war, you kind of shut yourself off. The first time I saw the old you again was when you started spending time with Malfoy. He’s good for you. I don’t want you to close off again.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Ron added. “He makes you happy… even if he is a git.”</p>
<p>Harry let out a soft chuckle. “Alright, alright… I’ll tell him.”</p>
<p>All throughout dinner on Friday, Harry couldn’t sit still. At first, Hermione was sympathetic. “You have nothing to be worried about,” she said. “He likes you too.” But that did nothing to calm Harry’s nerves.</p>
<p>He started bouncing his legs up and down, making the whole side of their table shake. Hermione kicked him in the shin. So much for being sympathetic.</p>
<p>When he entered the classroom, Draco was already there. He was reading a book. When Harry caught a glimpse of the cover, he smiled.</p>
<p>“<em>The Great Gatsby</em>?”</p>
<p>Draco looked up and grinned when he saw who it was. “Yeah. I’ve been getting into muggle literature recently. It’s very good.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never read it. Hermione references it sometimes.”</p>
<p>“You could borrow my copy… if you want. Once I’m done.”</p>
<p>Harry sat down next to him. He gripped his chair to stop his hands from shaking. “Then Hermione will finally stop pestering me about it.”</p>
<p>Draco laughed.</p>
<p>They stared at each other for a moment.</p>
<p>“So,” Draco started as he rummaged through his bag. “Let’s—”</p>
<p>“Actually,” Harry cut him off. His heart sped up. Was he really doing this? “I, er, I have to tell you something first.”</p>
<p>Draco raised an eyebrow. “What is it?”</p>
<p>“Erm…” Harry looked at the ceiling, the floor, the desk. Anywhere, but at Draco. “Remember when you asked me what I smelled in my Amortentia?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>
<p>“Well, it used to smell like Ginny… but it doesn’t anymore. It smells like something else. Some<em>one</em> else.”</p>
<p>Draco watched him intently. “Oh,” he said quietly. “W- who does it smell like?”</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath and finally met Draco’s eyes. “You,” he said.</p>
<p>Draco looked like someone had just hit him with a stunning jinx. “Oh.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Harry looked away and started fiddling with the cuff of his shirt.</p>
<p>“Well…” Draco said slowly. “My Amortentia hasn’t changed since I first smelled it in sixth year.”</p>
<p>“Right,” Harry said, feeling his heart deflate. “Right, yeah. I didn’t expect you to, you know, like me back or whatever. I just... thought you should know.”</p>
<p>The corners of Draco’s mouth tilted up. He shook his head. “No, you tosser, I smell you in the Amortentia too.”</p>
<p>A jolt went down Harry’s spine. He sat bolt upright. “You do?”</p>
<p>Draco grinned properly. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>“But that means… you’ve fancied me since sixth year?”</p>
<p>“Since fourth year actually.”</p>
<p>Harry choked out a laugh. “So Hermione was right. That’s why you tried to get my attention all those years.”</p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes, but the smile never left his face. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>Harry laughed again. “Fourth year? Really?”</p>
<p>“Shut up,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“What did it for you?” Harry continued. “Was it when I was fighting the dragon? No, wait, it was when I was coming out of the lake, wasn’t it?” He ran a hand through his hair obnoxiously.</p>
<p>Draco reached over and clamped a hand over his mouth. “Shut. Up.” Harry licked the palm of his hand. Draco withdrew rapidly. “Ew! That is disgusting!”</p>
<p>Harry chuckled as the other boy wiped his hand off on Harry’s shirt. Draco shook his head. “I hate you,” he said with a grin.</p>
<p>“Oh? So, if I ask you to go to Hogsmeade with me tomorrow, you’d say no?”</p>
<p>Draco crossed his arms. “I could be… persuaded.”</p>
<p>Harry bit his lip. “I’ll buy you some sweets from Honeydukes. Anything you want.”</p>
<p>Draco pretended to think for a second. “Alright,” he said, not bothering to hold back a smile. “I’m in.”</p></div>
