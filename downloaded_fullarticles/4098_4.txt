    <p>I walked down the street and noticed neon lights flashing on top of every muggle club.</p><p>I entered the third one, on the left, which displayed COMET in a blinding, glittering green light.The music thrummed in my ears, the low, deep beat.</p><p>I pushed through the ocean of sweating bodies, all moving, dancing and grinding themselves unvirtuously and made my way to the counter, ordering two shots of vodka.</p><p>I gulped down the colorless liquid. As it burned the insides of my throat and made my head feel dizzy, I lazily glanced around the Pub, multitude of figures, all mushed.......That's when I saw</p><p>
  <em>Him.</em>
</p><p>A mesmerizing beauty, none like any I've ever seen before.</p><p>His head bobbing to the beat,</p><p>hips shimming sinfully,</p><p>hands moving tantalizingly.</p><p>Eyes closed,</p><p>lips mouthing the lyrics,</p><p>The disco lights like colorful freckles on his face, that looks like its lost in time. No. It is Timeless.</p><p>He opened those fragile lids to showcase a breathtaking pair of what looked like turquoise eyes, under the changing lights.</p><p>And then he looked at me, his eyes raked down my own frame and he smiled.</p><p><em>This Stranger</em>.</p>
<h3> </h3><p>*******************************************************************************************************************************</p><p>The feel of Harry's warm hand on my shoulder as he urges me to follow him, is so satisfying.<br/>
"Come on, Tom!" he says "we have a long way to go before we reach the top. Don't want to keep Mione and Ron waiting now. Do we?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Harry sits on the grass and lays back beside me, I can't help but observe his calm demeanor. His eyes turned out to be a gorgeous green shade.</p><p>Our shoulders touch and I feel my heart beating out of my chest.</p><p>He takes hold of my hand, interlocking our fingers, as though asking me to keep him safe at the same time telling me that I will be safe.</p><p><em>This crush of mine</em> .</p><p>*******************************************************************************************************************************</p><p>In the background i can hear the sound of some muggle televison show and the rain impinge the balcony.</p><p> Harry cuddles up to me and rests his head under my chin, his smooth black hair tickling my jaw.</p><p>he holds a cup of warm coffee in his hand as he skims through the pages of a magazine.</p><p>I slowly get up from my lethargic position, only to be pulled back.</p><p>"Stay. You're warm."</p><p>I sigh and sit back down pulling the covers against us.</p><p>
  <em>My boyfriend.</em>
