    <p>     "School," Harry says slowly and clearly to the bulbous eyed cross between a human and a hairless cat that is trying to ruin his life "is how I learn to live on my own and not die. If I do not learn how to live on my own and not die, and it is your fault, then you will have basically murdered me."</p><p>    The creature attempts to slam its head into jelly using Harry's sock drawer as a bludgeoning object.</p><p>     "If you are too loud and I don't get fed, then me starving will <em>also</em> be your fault," Harry points out reasonably. The creature wails in distress, which is the exact opposite of the effect Harry was hoping for.</p><p>     "Shut up and go awaaaaay," he whines, logic at its limit.</p><p>     There is much repetition of his full name and begging for forgiveness. Dobby's ears flop wildly and he offers to provide Harry with food. Harry's hands twitch while he wonders if he could tie said ears into a bow.</p><p>     Eventually, harry just switches to ignoring it in the hopes that it will lose interest and go away like Dudley does sometimes. Later he can't get through the platform and tries to calculate how many bus changes getting to Scotland will take.</p><p> </p><p>     <em>Dear Professor Snape,</em> he writes, <em>The platform isn't working so I will probably be late to school. Please could you owl me a more precise location than 'Scotland' so that I might find my way to the castle once I get nearer.</em></p><p>     <em>Regards</em>.</p><p> </p><p>     Harry doesn't say "best" or "kind" because being pointlessly falsely polite is a waste of his time. He doesn't sign it because if the professor doesn't recognize his handwriting then he can just compare the letter to essays from every student in the castle, and then maybe rethink assigning them all so much homework. Doing so should only take him a day at most, so by the time Harry gets to Scotland he ought to have an idea where to head.</p><p>     Three bus transfers and two trains later Speckles returns, followed on broom by an irate looking Professor Snape.</p><p>     "Did it not occur to you to wait on the platform-" he begins seethingly, and Harry interrupts with a snort.</p><p>     "Wait for what; my letter to be intercepted and to find myself murdered?"</p><p>     "How did you even get an Oyster card, Potter? Unless you've just been stowing away on all these trains."</p><p>     Harry squints up at his teacher, and determines that the man is serious. His estimation of Snape's cleverness drops a few points accordingly.</p><p>     "You do realize," he says slowly, in the manner one says obvious things, "that galleons are made of <strong><em>gold</em></strong>, right?"</p><p>     Severus Snape rubs his temples in despair. He has six more years of this to look forward to, and at the current rate of proceedings he'll have aged ten years by the end of it.</p><p>     "I don't need your sass, Potter, just grab my sleeve and hold tight."</p><p>     Harry does, and then throws up bile all over Snape's robes after being forcefully shoved through space in a way that should not be possible or legal either one.</p><p>     "This is Hogsmeade, and as close to Hogwarts as apparation can take us." As he says this he waves his wand, and his robes are once again pristine and vomitless.</p><p>      "Please refrain from doing that again. In fact, everything you have done today is not to be repeated."</p><p>     Snape then lists everything that he perceives Harry has done wrong, from using such a recognizable owl to traveling long distances alone to wearing clothes like that in public.</p><p>     He delivers Harry to the great hall with a dozen detentions, since last year effectively proved that Harry does not give a single hoot about house points.<br/>
</p>
<p>     Harry counts arriving at Hogwarts at all as a win, and starts his year musing over what an idiot the new defense teacher is likely to be.</p>
