    The last time anything like a flu had brought Theseus down, he was
    thirteen, still too thin for his own good, and stupid enough to sneak out
    of the Hogwart’s gates in the freezing Scottish evening to practice night
    flying in the Quidditch quad (so the week he spent in misery and
    potion-smelling air following his stunt was well-earned and even formative,
    as Nurse Pompfrey didn't fail to remark while dumping medium-sized pyramids
    of Transfiguration homework on his lap).
</p>
<p>
    But after growing into the body that would bless his youth and middle age –
    jutting bones turning into toned muscle and broad, elegantly male lines –
    and becoming marginally less dumb, no flu or cold or stomach bug had
    managed to slow him. There was a quiet, sturdy strength at the center of
    Theseus Scamander (of all Scamanders, included the little brother who
    trudged through malarious swamps and serpent-infested tropical forests with
    the steadiness of a British stroller), and almost nothing seemed able to
    gnaw at it. Even during the War, even in the months Theseus found himself
    swimming in his army coat and carved down to his bones, he was still able
    to carry fallen comrades on his back all the way to the hospital tents. The
    tiredness he brought back to London from France had had nothing to do with
    meager rations and overflowing cesspits. Theseus had learned to doubt of
    many things, but not of the solid companionship of his body, the easy power
    in it.
</p>
<p>
    So the day the slice of London skyline in his office’s windows faded into
    gray-white and Theseus came back to himself in a crumpled heap on the
    floor, Aurors fluttering around like startled birds, he had three precise
    thoughts popping up in his mind in quick succession.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Head foggy. Throat hurts. </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Weasley is screaming – not helping, lad. </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Am I sick? Oh </em>
    fuck<em>, I'm sick. </em>
</p>
<p>
    He had no idea how it happened. No bloody idea, Merlin’s wrinkled arse. He
    was pretty sure that was what he mumbled to Potter, as they prepared to
    Apparate him home, muttering half-coherently into the shoulder of his poor
    Second. (The boy was promising and fiery, but also made entirely of sticks:
    how he managed to hold up his boss’s bulk while Theseus's legs were as
    solid as wet cotton was behind him.) He was never sick. It wasn't even
    winter yet – the soggy yellowish rain trickling down from the sky almost
    balmy by the standards of October in London. He couldn’t come up with a
    single reason he should be fainting in the middle of his office like a
    starving starlet after too many martinis.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Maybe spending the night trudging through that sewer channel on your
        own wasn't such a good idea, sir,
    </em>
    was Lovegood’s answer, the voice fluff-soft and amiable and absolutely
    implacable as the girl always was.
    <em>
        Maybe you should have at least taken your coat. Dried your shoes before
        coming to the office. Eaten something
    </em>
    .
</p>
<p>
    Theseus frowned as he chewed through the words, his brain feeling
    uncomfortably padded with concrete.<em> Ah,</em> he mused. And then, with
    more feeling: <em>Ah.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>That,, </em>
Theseus was forced to admit, as his flat coalesced into bright spots –    <em> bright, so bloody bright</em> – around him and Theseus's stomach came
dangerously close to make an acquaintance with Potter's shoes.    <em>Well, that makes a lot of sense. </em>
</p>
<p>
    Maybe he <em>did</em> know how this happened, after all.
</p>
<p>
In the pounding of his temples, the memory Nurse Pompfrey pinched face    <em>tsked</em> at him – and Theseus found nothing to say in his defense but
    sheepish apologies.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Oh – I don’t think you're not stupid, Mister Scamander. Also, did you
        just call me Nurse Pompfrey?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Yes. No. Just leave me alone, Potter. </em>
</p>
<p>
    Time stretched and twisted in the most prodigious way after that: Theseus
    had a vague recollection of hands stripping him of his layers – a sharp
    sting of yearning for other, way more pleasant occasions where hands are
    supposed to ease him out of his clothes; the sheets of his bed brushing
    against hot skin, words like ‘fever’ and ‘healer’ and ‘rest’ floating above
    him like pastel-colored clouds.
</p>
<p>
    Then – a potion down his throat, a click-clacking of hurried feet
    scampering around his hardwood floors, the loud voices of people more used
    to bark orders than to tend to feverish bosses; and finally, finally,
silence. Potter touching his hand one more time,    <em>you need anything else, sir?</em> and Theseus croaking something in
    response, half-coherent enough to want to reassure the boy.
</p>
<p>
    He was a grown man; London’s best Aurors couldn't play nurse all afternoon;
    they should be heading back to the office. He was going to be all right.
</p>
<p>
    And he was going to be. He knew it.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Yet, yet – </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Merlin, he had forgotten how miserable this was. </em>
</p>
<p>
    The flat emptied, and in the space left my his Auror cubs, illness flooded.
    Fever embraced him, wrapped him in cold, wet arms, hungry as a lover. His
    throat burned; full consciousness slippery as soap. Theseus prided himself
    in never forgetting he was ultimately made of flesh and bone, that there
    was a fragile human being under his medals and his muscles, and he was way
    better at remembering it than the flocks of cocky officers and pampered
    Minister's officials around him. But this, this was new: this was
    unexpected. He didn’t quite know what to do with this shaky weakness in his
    limbs, these bones melting into water. <em>This vulnerability</em>. A hazy,
    contemplative part of him, projected high above the mist of the flu, could
    almost see the outline of him: golden Theseus, the lion of England, winking
    on and off like a dying firefly, pinned in the middle of his sprawling
    monster of a bed, his tasteful Belgravia apartment quiet around him,
    curtains drawn by the housemaid. And everything so silent – so silent.
</p>
<p>
    <em>If they come for me now,</em>
    he found himself thinking, words electric and sluggish, the <em>they</em>
    as mysterious and undefined as things are only in dreams,
    <em>
        I can't do a bloody thing about it. They can slit my throat, hex me to
        death, and I won't even know it. Won't even spit at them.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Won't even say goodbye, in my head, in the heart. </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Oh, don't go there Thes. </em>
</p>
<p>
    Theseus reined his his jumbled thoughts, pulled brutally back from that
    edge – from the faces floating there, the memories of touching and kissing
    and smiling beyond it. But it was too late (it was always too late). Here
    was his little brother: the feeling of Newt's preteen body tangled with his
    under the covers on Saturday mornings, whispering him the secrets of toads
    and lizards he had discovered that week and smelling like moss and green
    things. His mother, kissing his cheek with her chapped lips, her
    weather-rough skin. And Percival. <em>Percival</em>. Oh, imagine that –
    Percival's lean body straddling him, clever hands working his shirt out of
    his trousers, the thrill of a shape so like his own and so different in his
    arms; the coffee ghost on his lips. Theseus's tongue lapping up the hint of
    sugar at the bottom of it, at the bottom of Percival Graves.
</p>
<p>
    At the brightness of that memory, Theseus's ribs crushed down around his
    heart. Eyes burned harder, knees went weaker. A single name undoing a
    strong man: a spell, that one, a real spell, of magic way older than
    theirs.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Gods, Theseus. You idiot. </em>
</p>
<p>
    Know this: Theseus wasn't a lonely man. He was an <em>independent</em> man,
    which was a completely different thing, and an accomplished bachelor, and a
    busy Auror graced with the time and means to try and fix the lumpy glory of
    the British Wizarding world. (He was an ambitious man, too; though you
    wouldn't see it unless you were looking real close.) But he had friends, a
    squad of Aurors who very nearly worshiped him – at least when he wasn't
    drooling over them and mistaking them like intimidating Hogwarts nurses; he
    had women and men who partook of the games Theseus offered in his bed, too,
    and who would do it again with pleasure if he decided to call them.
</p>
<p>
    No, he wasn't lonely. He had lovers, a family; a best friend – who was
    also, incidentally, the blinding light nestled at the center of his heart,
    the thing that made him wake up smiling when he remembered a particularly
    good quip from his letters. He wasn't miserable, either; never blind to the
    privilege of his classy apartment and his childhood memories, of talent
    coupled with money.
</p>
<p>
    But. But that wasn't it, was it? The meat of the question was deeper.
    Simpler – animal.
</p>
<p>
    Theseus dragged his hands past his chest, dug them into his closed eyelids,
    the heat of fever coming off them in fluttery pulses. He rasped out a sigh.
    Saw what he wanted materialize in the dark, in swirling colorful spots –
    the hard slant of the eyebrows, the unmistakable line of the shoulders.
</p>
<p>
    The truth was that, like every human being who had ever lived since we
    dragged ourselves down Pleistocene moss-dripping trees and started
    sculpting things out of rocks, Theseus was sad and sick and angry at his
    being sick, and wanted the one person in the world who could do it to sit
    at his side and chase away the anger and the fear.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Simple. Animal.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Theseus pressed harder against his eyes, till the Percival of splotchy
    light got smeared enough to be unrecognizable.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Completely impossible.</em>
</p>
<p>
    It wasn't self-pity; it wasn't even resentment. He knew – at least, Normal,
    Capable Theseus knew: the half of him who wasn't whimpering and shivering
    under several layers of embroidered quilts – that if he fumbled to summon
    the phone and called Percival to tell him how bad he felt, how miserable
    and small he was right now, he would come: without asking for a single good
    reason, probably hanging up on him to speed things up. But that would be a
    problem. Percival would be forced to put on hold current investigations;
    the cases hitting the desk of Director of American DMLE weren't stuff that
    should be put on hold. He would probably pass them to his second and his
    squad of young bright things – harassing them with bullet point lists and
    instructions so complicated and articulated they would forget half of it by
    the time he flashed away in the Port-Key magic; he would therefore worry
    about them for the whole time he would spend in London – worry about them
    handling the case, about them being reckless and stupidly self-sacrificial
    – and once here, he would be intractable. Restless. And angry.
</p>
<p>
    It wasn't Percival's fault; and it was actually less despicable than it
    sounded – being angry at a man who literally collapsed with fever in his
    office. He was sure Percival wouldn't snap at him either, or outright tell
    him he was wasting his time and he had better, more important things to do
    than holding an adult man's hand as he sweated his cold away in his bed.
    (Unlike most people making the claim, that was usually actually true for
    Percival, which softened the blow a lot.) Instead, he would chain-smoke his
    thin Egyptian cigarettes, perched on the windowsill so Theseus's flat
    wouldn't stink with it, and smile mechanically whenever he came in his
    room, and follow all the rituals Percival followed when pretending to be
    softer and gentler than he really was.
</p>
<p>
    The problem was, Theseus knew him too well not to see past the cracks. And
    he liked what he saw past them: he didn’t want to force his friend to
    swallow such a big part of himself just to make himself more pleasant. The
    Gods knew he had to do it already enough.
</p>
<p>
    They had talked about it, years ago – when they were still young and
    tentative and endlessly hungry for each other, still shocked by the
    privilege of being alive and being together. They had just come back from a
    Gala, in the lavishly vintage halls of the Ministry's ballrooms. Percival
    had been charming and brilliant all night, glowing like good champagne in a
    crystal flute. Now he was pressed against the brick facade of his London
    hotel, snow peppering his hair and his eyelashes. Theseus was pinning him
    there with his hands on either side of his head, and trying to convince him
    there was no need to ask him to come to his room – because he had watched
    him all night and knew that his beautiful Yank wanted nothing more than
    burrow under his covers with a trashy novel, blissfully alone.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        That's not true Scamander – I like spending time with you. I like it a
        lot.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        I know you do. But I also know you've had enough social interaction
        back there to last you for an abundant two days, and that you need some
        space. And it's
    </em>
    okay<em>. </em>
</p>
<p>
    Fever gave a silver sheen to the memory: a quivering quality. Theseus
    remembered how Percival lifted his eyes, then, and looked almost vulnerable
    – <em>almost</em>, his indomitable Graves –for the first time since the
    night before the German attack they had been both sure they would die in.
    He remembered how all Theseus could think of where the snowflakes trapped
    in his lashes.
</p>
<p>
    <em>I don't want you to think I'm some sort of picky misanthropist. </em>
</p>
<p>
    Theseus had cupped his cheek. Curved over him to kiss him.
</p>
<p>
    <em>I love pricky misanthropists, Graves. </em>
</p>
<p>
    He'd given him nothing but the truth, back then. Theseus didn't want the
    prepackaged Percival the world got every day, the dazzling socialite, the
    charismatic leader. He wanted the cracks, he wanted the hard edges; he
    wanted Percival not to have to change one thing about himself to spend time
    with him.
</p>
<p>
    Theseus Scamander – who was by nature a man of robust appetites, with a
    robust desire to hoard and protect that fed those appetites – had long
    since decided that this was the single thing he was allowed to be
    ferociously possessive of: Percival Graves's flaws, which no one would see
    but him.
</p>
<p>
    So, no – he wouldn't call Percival. He wouldn't wake a man in the middle of
    the night – or was it already morning there? Bloody time zones, he had
    never been able to wrap his head around them – unless he was bleeding out
    on the grit-smeared floors of an abandoned warehouse, mortally and
    hopefully heroically wounded.
</p>
<p>
    He wouldn’t call him, even if he knew how Percival grew hot and soft in his
arms, how tender is the line of his clavicle under his teeth, how    <em>his</em> this man was.
</p>
<p>
    Theseus gave a second sigh: felt it rattle up his battered throat, tasting
    like the dying things he felt on his tongue. He sank under his icy-hot-icy
    duvet.
</p>
<p>
    Told himself to be brave.
</p>
<p>
    And then –
</p>
<p>
    An electric shock, somewhere in the back of his head. Skin burning. An
    easing, somewhere under his breastbone.
</p>
<p>
    That tricky old magic, again.
</p>
<p>
    There was someone outside the door. Theseus vaguely recognized the sound of
    feet on the hallway carpeting, the buzz of another wizard's power frizzling
    against the wards of his door – and beyond it, dimly, impossibly, he
    recognized something more. The pressure of a presence: a warmth in a
    familiar shape. He could see it behind his eyelids, burning bright, coming
    closer.
</p>
<p>
    Theseus’s breath itched, and it had nothing to do with the fire in his
    lungs.
</p>
<p>
    He knew his scent even before he heard his voice.
</p>
<p>
    A honeyed kind of cologne; the ozone of his magic; a dash of rain. They all
    rolled ahead of the soft <em>click</em> of the door charms opening, of the
    rustle of clothes, of the “Theseus” whispered in the silence – so tender
    and hushed it made his voice nearly unrecognizable.
</p>
<p>
    <em>This, this. If I got blind and deaf and lost,</em>
    Theseus thought, savagely,
    <em>
        if I forgot everything I've ever been and loved, I would still know
        this.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    He knew he was probably hallucinating. He knew some things happened only in
    those sap-dripping, swashbuckling Fae novels Percival gorged himself on,
    and in that case they happened to slender young elves, not grizzled magical
    coppers. It still didn’t stop him from fighting out of his grave of covers,
    snapping his eyes open. It didn’t stop him from <em>hoping</em>, wildly.
</p>
<p>
    And he was rewarded for it.
</p>
<p>
    There was a man standing by his bed: watery light falling on good cloth,
    slick black hair.
</p>
<p>
    Theseus had to lick his lips twice before mustering a voice which didn’t
    completely sound like a peeping chick.
</p>
<p>
    “Graves.”
</p>
<p>
    Graves was there – in London, in his flat. He was sheathed in a tailored
    gray three-piece, his scorpion pins gnawing at his black silk tie, and he
    wasn’t smiling. As Theseus watched him lower himself on the side of the
    bed, dark coat shrugged off with efficient ease, he noticed there were
    worry lines around Percival’s clever coffee eyes, mouth a line, pale and
    worried. He vaguely mused it made him look older, a man of forty instead of
    the ageless half-god he usually presented the world with, and painfully
    young at the same time. It didn’t matter, though.
</p>
<p>
    <em>It certainly didn’t make him any less kissable, </em>
    Theseus’s muddy mind mused again.
</p>
<p>
    “Scamander...”
</p>
<p>
    Uncharacteristically, Percival stopped halfway through the sentence.
</p>
<p>
    The bed had dipped under his weight with a discreet <em>puff</em>: He was
    close enough Theseus could distinguish the smattering of raindrops on his
    collar, on his neck, as if in the haste he had forgotten to cast himself an
    Umbrella Charm.
</p>
<p>
    If this was still a figment of his delirious mind, Potter’s potion was way
    more powerful than anything an Auror should be able to legally purchase.
</p>
<p>
    But no, no: he was there.<em> Percival</em><em> </em>was there. Theseus
    knew it in his bones: in the tug under his skin, wobbly with recognition.
</p>
<p>
    Then the handsome man on his bed leaned in to cup his cheek, each callus a
    map Theseus had imprinted to the inside of hi heart, and every lingering
    incredulity waned to nothing, and a relief so pure it nearly hurt flooded
    his chest.
</p>
<p>
    <em>You can die, from a love like this, </em>
    was what he had meant to say: which sounded dramatic and poetic and
    charming enough for the occasion. What his cotton-stuffed brain actually
    managed to say was:
</p>
<p>
    “if you were a murderer, you could have slit my throat without even waking
    me up.”
</p>
<p>
    The sentence left him wheeze: both with the effort and with the sheer
    stupidity of it.
</p>
<p>
    Percival’s fingers froze, still pressed against his cheek, and his eyebrows
    climbed his forehead all the way to his hairline like startled birds. Then
    he grinned, and Theseus felt marginally less of a twat, just because of the
    marvel of Percival Graves smiling.
</p>
<p>
    “Well, inext time I drop by to sit at your deathbed, I can bring a
    butcher’s knife and try to kill you, if you want.”
</p>
<p>
    Theseus shook his head, the movement enough to make him dizzy. Careful, oh
    so careful of not dislodging the hand on his face. “You’re too cocky to off
    me like that. Wouldn’t be flashy enough.”
</p>
<p>
    “You sorely underestimate my sneakiness, Scamander,” Percival replied.
    “You’re bigger than me, and we both know in a bare-knuckle fight I wouldn’t
    stand a chance; it would be reasonable to take advantage of you in this
    state.”
</p>
<p>
    The smile wavered around the edges. He slid closer, knotting his fingers in
    Theseus’s hair, folding his whole body around him. He reminded Theseus of
    the wing of some dark, elegant bird, shielding him from light and rain and
    cold.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, Thes,” Graves said – voice curling sweetly around the word, making it
    secret, precious. “You should have called. You look –“
</p>
<p>
    “Like shit,” Theseus helpfully rasped out. “I know. Illness doesn’t become
    Scamanders. We’re too pale not to get all flushed and too ruddy to make it
    look pretty. Noses get red, eyes puffy and squinty. I probably look like
the illegitimate lovechild of an albino troll and an    <em>Amanite phalloides</em> –“
</p>
<p>
    “You <em>collapsed,</em> Scamander,” Percival blurted out – and something
    in it made Theseus catch his breath. “I stopped by the office – your Aurors
    told me. You collapsed in the middle of the gods-damned office, and they
    had to slap you for half a minute before you were coherent enough to
    understand what they were saying.” A ripple pulsed across Percival’s face –
    a flash of bared teeth. “I nearly ripped them a new one for leaving you
    here alone. Ungrateful children, the whole of them.”
</p>
<p>
    “C’mon. They’re good chaps, they did everything –“
</p>
<p>
    “I know,” Percival replied, ferociously. “I just <em>wanted to</em>. And I
    wanted to break things. I just wanted to break things because you should
    have <em>called me</em>.”
</p>
<p>
    The fingers in Theseus’s hair were shaking, slightly. For a moment he
    thought he was the one shivering – his blood still feeling unruly,
    smothering him in waves of heat, and cold, and scorching heat again – but
    no; no. It was Percival the one trembling: in his hands, in the contracted
    muscles in his jaw, in his lips.
</p>
<p>
    Realization came to Theseus in degrees: moving to the surface through
    molasses. Saying the words felt awfully bad and awfully good at the same
    time, the taste of honey in viciously dark tea. “Graves. Were you...” His
    mouth was filled with sawdust. He swallowed around it, tried again.
    “...Were you worried?”
</p>
<p>
    Color bled out of Percival’s face.
</p>
<p>
    “Of course I was. Of course <em>I am</em>.” Graves bit his lips. He craned
    his head, so Theseus couldn’t see his eyes, but only the flickering pulse
    in his throat.
</p>
<p>
    Very unhelpfully, his mind remarked how satisfying would it be to kiss him
    there.
</p>
<p>
    Under the sheets, Theseus dig his nails into his palms hard enough to
    stifle the urge.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Stop it, Scamander. It’s not kissing time. It’s comfort time. Stop it
        right now.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    But stopping it was growing exponentially hard. Having Percival there,
    whispering soft truths to him, pale and shaking with worry for him, was
    almost too much – almost intoxicating. It would take a man with a heart
    made of steel not to get drunk on it, not to yearn to sweep him up and
    crush him to his heart and gulp down all that miraculous warmth. Theseus
    Scamander was many things, but not a steel-hearted man, not at all.
</p>
<p>
    He rubbed his cheek against Graves’s palm – nuzzling it. “I will be all
    right, Graves. No need to fuss,” he croaked out. “I may look like something
    a kraken swallowed and then threw up, but it’s just flu. I’ll be all right.
    Everyone gets sick.”
</p>
<p>
    Percival’s nails caressed the back of his neck. He was holding him with
    painful care and with a trembling kind of strength at the same time, the
    way you hold a hatching egg. “You don’t.”
</p>
<p>
    “I usually don’t,” Theseus admitted. He closed his eyes, brushing a kiss
    against Percival’s hand. “But it’s still just flu. I swear.”
</p>
<p>
    “You still should have called me.”
</p>
<p>
    Theseus shook his head. He was going to tell Percival all the reasonable
    things he had thought about his job and his ambition and the careful dance
    required to make different hearts tolerate each other, to remind him how
    much he liked to know his hard edges – when a thought popped up in his
    brain.
</p>
<p>
    Bounced off it, swelling into understanding, a sudden burst of inspiration.
</p>
<p>
    “...Graves,” Theseus asked, very calmly. Opened his eyes again. “Why are
    you here?”
</p>
<p>
    Percival sucked in air through his teeth. “By the Gods, Scamander. I
    understand the whole stoic lawman persona, but if you really would rather
    have me fuck off then you just have to say –“
</p>
<p>
    “No,” Theseus replied, “I didn’t mean that. You said you stopped by the
    office, and that Potter and the rest told you about my little fainting
    stunt.” He blinked, hard. The molasses was thick, deductions sticky. “So
    they… didn’t call you. So you couldn’t know I needed – that I was – ah,
    hell, about <em>this</em>.” He shuffled one hand under the sheets,
    gesturing to the whole of his sorry person. “The point is – you couldn’t
    know I was sick, Percy. So either Macusa had been developing some bloody
    terrifying long-range mind-reading charms my government should be quite
    worried about, or I have no idea why you hurled yourself across a whole
    ocean for no particular reason.”
</p>
<p>
    Silence. Theseus dragged his eyes back to his best friend’s face, and saw
    astonishing things happening there: eyebrows twitching, mouth clapping open
    and closed and open again. Percival seemed on the verge of saying
    something, thought better of it. He tarted pulling at a loose thread in the
    blanket.
</p>
<p>
    With a small thud of shock, Theseus realized he had left him speechless.
</p>
<p>
    “It was a hunch,” Percival finally mumbled, the words all jumbled together.
    Still picking at the blanket.
</p>
<p>
    "You don't do hunches," Theseus replied, matter-of-factly. Three things in
    this mad world of ours he knew for sure: London is hellishly nosy and chock
    full of terrible people and he loved with his whole heart; tea will always
    be vastly superior to coffee; and Percival Graves was the most rational man
    he'd ever known. Graves had a decent gut feeling – all good Aurors do – but
    Theseus had the impression it almost irked him. He had never imagined the
    word <em>hunch </em>and his best friend in the same setting.
</p>
<p>
    A second sign of strangeness: Percival didn’t agree with his evaluation,
    nor he disagreed. He picked harder at the cashmere pattern under his
    fingers, a slight flush rising on the back of his neck.
</p>
<p>
    Theseus wanted to kiss him there, too. Instead, he settled for shoving at
    him through the blanket.
</p>
<p>
    "Humor a poor ailing man, Graves. Explain yourself."
</p>
<p>
    The flush deepened. "You're never going to let me live it down."
</p>
<p>
    "Probably. But consider it my dying wish."
</p>
<p>
    Percival's eyes found his face again – not quite his eyes, but the line of
    his jaw, the curve of his nose. "Don't say those things," he said, and damn
    him, the ache in his voice made Theseus’s heart skip a beat. He was still
    rewarded with a quiet huff, a silent armistice.
</p>
<p>
    "Fine,” Percival relented. “I’ll humor you. It… It really was a hunch,
    Thes. I don't know how else to describe it." He ran his hand down Theseus’s
    cheek, all the way to his chest. "I was at the office, shuffling through
    the disaster Delgado would like me to believe it's the Smirnov report, and
    suddenly – I felt it. A tug, right there, under the sternum. It felt like
    electrocution. It felt like a stunning hex you didn’t see coming – and I've
    got plenty of those, so I know what I'm talking about."
</p>
<p>
    "Let's make the ban on macabre jokes mutual," Theseus protested, who had
    been there on several such occasions had held Percival's limp body
    screaming at him to keep breathing as he struggled to make his lungs work.
</p>
<p>
    "Fair enough. Well, I was there, sitting at my overly ugly throne of a desk
    chair, perfectly safe – and yet I was suddenly filled with fear: sudden,
    adrenaline-bright fear, the kind that makes you angry and savage. It was as
    if the animal side of my brain was absolutely certain it had to get up and
    protect its people – except there was no immediate danger to any of them.
    There was no immediate danger to <em>anyone</em> I knew. And as soon as I
    thought that – your name exploded in my mind. <em>Theseus</em>. My heart
    raced. My magic was all over the place. For some reason, my stupid monkey
    brain was absolutely sure you were in distress, and that I needed to get to
    you." Percival shook his head. "I haunted the office for a couple of hours,
    making everyone abundantly miserable because I couldn't focus on shit and
    growled at anyone approaching. Then I. Then I told Delgado and Goldstein I
    was taking the day off, reminded them they better made sure nothing went up
    into flames in my absence, and took the first Port-Key for the London
    Precinct."
</p>
<p>
    Percival blinked. His face slowly filled with a gentle wonder, a
    disorientation that made his lines softer, newer. Usually, Percival was a
    barrel of a gun, all focus, all steel: now he smudged his own edges, and it
    was unexpected, and it was magnificent.
</p>
<p>
    "I think…,” he breathed out. “...I think I <em>felt </em>you, Thes. I felt
    you needed me. No matter how dumb it sounds."
</p>
<p>
    Theseus felt himself opening up – a feeling so unbearably large and raw it
    spilled out, like yolk.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        That this man simply felt he was needed, and crossed the world for him;
        this was old magic.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    This was something Theseus refused not to be in love with.
</p>
<p>
    He had enough of this distance. Theseus struggled to free his hands from
    his blankets, ignoring the sloshing of the brain in his skull. He needed
    the contact now: he needed to feel the skin against the skin. He reached
    out, to the hand Percival had still pressed against his chest, and wrapped
    his fingers around it. He felt Percival stir under the touch, react to him;
    he felt him not pulling back.
</p>
<p>
    "Percival…"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I know. It sounds as tacky as the stuff in my Sean Lugson's novels.
    Feeling my beloved’s distress – shit, I think not even that pooka would
    stoop so low, and Merlin knows the crap he put in his books –"
</p>
<p>
    "<em>Percival</em>." A victory like no other – his voice cracking like a
    baby raven, and still this powerful man shut up at the sound of it. “I
    don't think it sounds dumb. I, I think is…" He swallowed. Broken glass
    rolled down his throat, but he didn't mind, not really. "... You really
    felt I needed you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," Percival answered, without a beat of hesitation – obviously before
    he could catch himself. Theseus grinned. Percival’s flush turned
    beetle-red.
</p>
<p>
    "I knew it. You'll never let me live this down. And it doesn't make any
    sense. It's so <em>illogical</em> –"
</p>
<p>
    "We're wizards, Percival. I don't think ‘illogical’ is a good category to
    judge by-"
</p>
<p>
    "Magic is a perfectly scientific pursuit, Scamander. It has laws which
    differ from the one of the mundane physics, but laws all the same. This,
    this is sentimental nonsense. Unfit for serious wizards."
</p>
<p>
    Theseus let his eyes flutter closed for a moment. He was in no condition to
    face a philosophical debate with Percival's cunning mind. So he did the
    only thing a man stricken with weakness and so clearly overwhelmed could
    do.
</p>
<p>
    He took advantage of distraction.
</p>
<p>
    And momentum.
</p>
<p>
    Before Percival could fully realize what was happening, Theseus's other
    hand reached across the space between them and sneaked around his collar –
    stopping his flow of words. Then he gave a vicious pull with both hands –
    at his neck, at his wrist – and tugged Percival down on the bed.
</p>
<p>
    Clumsy, but efficient.
</p>
<p>
    Percival landed on the mattress with an undignified squeak: Theseus reached
    out blindly to wrap his arms around him. The sputtered curses, the flying
    limbs, the London rain trapped in his hair – Theseus pressed them all
    against his chest. It was like hugging a struggling bird of prey: the same
    fluttering of strong wings, the unspent energy. There was never anything
    static in cuddling with Percival Graves.
</p>
<p>
    Fuck, he had missed this.
</p>
<p>
    "Scamander-"
</p>
<p>
    "I love your monkey brain, Graves," Theseus whispered in his ear; the rust
    in his lungs making his voice deeper, thicker. "I love your monkey brain an
    awful lot."
</p>
<p>
With this, he kissed the strip of tender skin below Percival’s ear –    <em>finally, finally</em> – his pulse point, the curve of his jaw, still
    redolent of aftershave. The body under him shuddered: the curses turned
    into sighs. He felt Percival's arms close around his chest, his legs wound
    tight around his hips, vine-like, and for the first time since he watched
    him come in, Theseus allowed himself the privilege to wonder if Graves
    missed this as much as he did.
</p>
<p>
    "You'll get wet," Percival mumbled. Mouth moving over Theseus's clavicle,
    which wasn't the best way to make him desist.
</p>
<p>
    "You'll get contaged," Theseus replied. With Percival’s warmth leaking
    through their joined limbs, he found himself more balanced, something like
    focus piercing the fog. It was still raining: the square of sky framed by
    the window sable-colored, sheets of a rain as thin as needles slapping the
    glass. He took a slow breath, and once more pitied the men and the women
    born in places like California or Florida, where the sun always shone,
    because they would never know the pleasure of watching the world washed
    away in cold rain when you are warm and loved. He heard Percival grab at
    the blankets, dragging them over the both of them, and smiled, secretly.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I should at least make you drink some tea, right? Check your
    temperature. Make chicken soup. Do the things people do when taking care of
    their loved ones, I guess."
</p>
<p>
    "Later." Theseus kissed the curve of one eyebrow. Slipped his hands under
    Percival's shirt – because Graves wasn't the only one skilled at the
    delicate art of extracting people out of elaborated clothes."Later."
</p>
<p>
    Percival arched against him. "Later, then.”
</p>
<p>
    Theseus closed his eyes. He was still so weak; the strings attached to his
    limbs growing tangled again. He listened as Percival kicked his shoes out
    of the bed, and pressed their fingers together under the sheets, palm to
    palm, every inch of skin flush against his, a mirror image. Their magic
    swirled to the surface, his soft golden buzz, Percival's silver pulse.
</p>
<p>
    "It's… actually really bloody sweet you felt I wanted you here, Graves.
    Coming here with no umbrella, no change of clothes – you, of all people.
    Really bloody sweet."
</p>
<p>
    Percival groaned. "Oh, don't start again with that –"
</p>
<p>
    "No, I'm serious; it is sweet." He tilted Percival's chin up with his free
    hand till they could meet eyes; let their magics brush against each other,
    flicker at the familiarity. "I want to do the same for you, Graves. If you
    ever need it, need me – I hope I'll feel it. I hope I’ll be there before
    you can think it."
</p>
<p>
    Percival smiled: the smile bright, unreadable, still beautiful. "I know you
    will, Scamander."
</p>
<p>
    Theseus nodded; closed his eyes. He fell asleep to the sound of Percival's
    kisses peppering his neck, the steady tempo of his heart.
</p>
<p align="center">
    ***
</p>
<p>
    Years later, and so many things had changed. The sky still gray, swollen
    with rain; the air still freezing enough to make you breathe through
    snowflakes – but this was January's cold, which is more vicious and less
    hopeful than October’s. And under it not London's Gothic spires, but towers
    of glass, a jungle of darker brick. Busy, so busy this place: this New
    York, jittery as only young things can be, people and cities alike.
</p>
<p>
    Theseus was sitting on the sidewalk outside the dignified, glossy Manhattan
    building of the Macusa headquarters, business men in long dusters flashing
    in and out its revolving doors. He was smoking a cigarette. He felt one
    step from throwing up.
</p>
<p>
    This time, it had nothing to do with fever. It had everything to do with
    broken promises, with the photos burning in the report Phina had let him
    see, with how fucking blind he had been.
</p>
<p>
    (Seraphina had dispensed him of going through the usual protocol, didn't
    even pretend he would follow the rules in this; still, they couldn't look
    each other in the eye. They would see their own reflection there, and oh,
    they were not brave enough for that, not now.)
</p>
<p>
    He saw the photos against his eyelids, even now. The apartment trashed.
    Books everywhere – the spines split where they landed in a heap, the covers
curled and charred by magical fire. Geography, mathematics; Sean Lugson's    <em>Fey Flame</em>, last book in the series, a pencil still tucked between
    the pages as bookmark.
</p>
<p>
    (Absurdly, that detail was what had broken Theseus for good, what had made
    him flee the Auror office and the worried faces there and collapse in a
    heap just outside the Woolworth.)
</p>
<p>
    He saw the smears of blood on the carpet, too. The signs of struggle.
</p>
<p>
    <em>He fought</em>
    , of course Seraphina had said.
    <em>
        He didn’t make it easy for that bleached bastard. And after taking his
        place, Grindelwald didn’t
    </em>
    <em> even clean them up – he was </em>
    that<em> sure to get away with this. </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>He did,</em>
    Theseus had blurted out. He had enjoyed the pain on her face then, the
    shock of grief. It had made it marginally easier to breathe, for a couple
    minutes.
</p>
<p>
    Now he sucked on the stub of his fag; tossed it into the gutter under his
    feet. He raked his hands through his hair so hard nails scraped the skin.
</p>
<p>
    He had been so sure, back then, during the quiet days of his recovery from
    the flu: so bloody confident he would feel Percival's distress, the ache
    and the tug he had talked about, and come to the rescue. He was the warm
    one after all; he was the generous one, chivalrous Theseus, passionate
    Theseus.
</p>
<p>
    He had been so sure. And what was worse, a thousand, a million times worse
    – Percival had believed him, too.
</p>
<p>
    Instead, he hadn't felt a thing. Through Grindelwald, through the ambush in
his apartment – a shudder in the dark, a hand around Percival’s neck,    <em>powerlessness</em>, such atrocious <em>powerlessness</em> – through the
    pretense of the next six months, he hadn't felt a <em>thing</em>.
</p>
<p>
    And now. <em>Now –</em>
</p>
<p>
    Theseus's brain sputtered. He refused to push his mind further down that
    path: his legs wouldn't carry him there.
</p>
<p>
    There were still no bones, no recognizable body. Rescue squads were still
    swarming New York, combing the grime of sewers and subway tunnels, looking
    everywhere they could reach.
</p>
<p>
    If Macusa was still moving, If Percival's Aurors were still trying, so he
    would. He would still try, too.
</p>
<p>
    (There were questions, of course. What they could find now, so many months
    after the damage was done; if there was some of Percival still alive, what
    would it be – but no, no; he shouldn't go there either. Theseus would take
    whoever, whatever they found; take it and thank the gods for it, again and
    again, even if some nights the thought made his hands shake with the sheer
    weight of it.)
</p>
<p>
    A spray of dirty rain on his cheek; the wind finally picking up, the sky
    cracking open. Rain, washing away the dark snow in the corners, drenching
    his hair, the back of his neck. <em>Good; good</em>.
</p>
<p>
    He didn't have the strength to pull himself out of it. He barely had the
    strength to close his eyes, take a breath, and try again.
</p>
<p>
    For the millionth time since he got here, Theseus reached into the darkness
    beyond his eyes: the inner thrumming of his body, the pulse and shift of
    living flesh. He reached beyond them, too, past the memories, and past the
    grief, even if that felt like slime polluting the whole of him. And there,
    silence: a core of pure perception, pure listening. A core of older magic.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Please, please, Graves,</em>
    Theseus screamed into that space, ignoring the selfishness in the thought;
    ignoring how much like a heartbroken hobo he should look like to the New
Yorkers shuffling past him. If<em> you're there, if you're </em>anywhere    <em>, let me hear you. Call me. </em>
</p>
<p>
    He would not cry. He was crying. An itch in his eyes, and then a tear
    rolling down his cheek, another.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Call me. </em>
</p>
<p>
    He licked his lips. The rain tasted like salt.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Call–</em>
</p>
<p>
    Right then, at the last possible moment – something. Theseus felt it blaze
    through him, transparent and cold, so subtle he would have missed it had he
    been doing anything but waiting for it. But he was. Gods, he was.
</p>
<p>
    In the black space at the center of him, a tug. A stunning hex to the
    heart.
</p>
<p>
    A <em>call</em>.
</p>
<p>
    (He learned then, the hard way, that true hope hurts.)
