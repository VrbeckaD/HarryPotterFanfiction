<p>Hermione Granger had always been the type of girl that had no idea just how radiant she was. As a woman she was even more clueless; a fact Draco Malfoy was all too happy to exploit, considering how complex their relationship had become in recent years.</p>
<p>Working alongside the ‘Golden Girl’ was a new brand of torture for the man that was formerly her most reliable tormentor. Childish quarrels were eventually set aside, prejudices were carved out (not all of them were his) and replaced with compromise (and behaviour that often oscillated between mumbled compliments and gentle, bitless teasing).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, getting to know his enemy left him vulnerable. With no hatred-enforced distance to protect himself, he came to more than a few difficult conclusions regarding the jumble of feelings he had for the brightest witch of their age.</p>
<p>Introspection truly was the harbinger of havoc in his case. The study of self under new criteria bore stranger truths than he ever could have imagined.</p>
<p>For example; Recollection of the first time he truly let himself be in awe of her.</p>
<p>He could just about visualise his fourth-year-self watching her accidentally make a grand entrance at the Yule Ball; he’d been struck dumb, unable to tear his eyes away from the sight of Granger, looking rather more like an angel in periwinkle than the unappealing visage (exaggerated beaver-teeth and all) he had conjured and spent years layering over her features in the depths of his mind.</p>
<p>She smiled brightly, sparkling golden, as her nickname suggested with each twirling pass beneath the pale, artificial moon hung high above them, dancing with grace he hadn’t thought her capable of; until, unfortunately, Weaselbee went and ruined it for everyone (read; himself and Krum… But mostly him), resulting in her tearful, hasty exit.</p>
<p>The fact he almost followed with the intention of at least offering her a handkerchief, perhaps a shoulder to cry on despite their past, proved it was possible to break his programming.</p>
<p>Hard as he tried to deny it, his beliefs were more than shaken. In fact, they were comparable to a broken watch; one cog dislodged, and his entire system failed. Unfortunately, he didn’t notice he’d stopped ‘ticking’ for quite some time.</p>
<p>Years later (and in less denial) he still wondered what he’d been thinking. As if she’d ever deign to accept his kindness. At best she would have assumed he came to gloat over her pathetic sobbing, at worst; that it was all a cruel joke intended to take advantage of her weakness.</p>
<p>Somewhere very, very, very deep down he despised possession of such knowledge and in the wake of his revelation, Draco’s constitution crumbled; the veil of prejudice fell from his eyes to reveal one glaring, cold, hard truth.</p>
<p>His admiration stretched further back than he wished to acknowledge. Before blood, status and house rivalry, there had been an undeniable spark, one he doused with a dam’s worth of misplaced faith in the teachings of his father; in reality, their great feud stemmed from the fact he lacked the ability to change the factors that predestined it. (And if that didn’t just sum up his entitled nature: prone to childishly lashing out when he couldn’t have what he wanted).</p>
