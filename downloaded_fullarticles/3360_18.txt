    <p>Dumbledore pushed his half-moon glasses further up his nose with his forefinger. What could their next move be? More and more Order members were either disappearing or being found dead, many believed it was becoming almost unreasonable for him to send people to complete tasks now. Although, for the sake of helping all of Wizardkind - Dumbledore believed it was very much justified.</p><p>He looked up from his desk to the doorway of his office, where the stone gargoyle had begun to bang and shake. Minerva McGonagall became visible in the doorway, lips tight, a panicked look upon her face.</p><p>“Albus, I…It’s happened. He’s found them.”</p><p>Dumbledore’s eyes met McGonagall’s for a long moment. Then he sighed deeply and looked at the desk. “They were so sure, they were certain that Black would never betray them. You saw yourself during their school days and -“ </p><p>Albus wait there’s more” She interrupted. Dumbledore paused, waiting for her to continue.</p><p>“The boy, Harry Potter, he’s alive.”</p><p>Albus stood up suddenly. “And Voldemort ?” he asked. </p><p>"Gone, dead, appears as if the killing curse backfired on him.” she informed him. He walked around his desk and approached her. </p><p>"We need to contact the ministry and inform them of what’s happened, and somebody has to deal with Severus. I know he will almost certainly know that Lily Potter is dead by now, but if he returns here he must be dealt with away from the students. Also, I must go and fetch Hagrid.” </p><p>"Hagrid ? Why whatever for?” she asked, truly puzzled. </p><p>"I am sending Hagrid to go and retrieve the boy.” </p><p>"Oh Albus, are you sure that’s wise ? Trusting Hagrid with something as important as this?” </p><p>"Minerva I would trust Hagrid with my life.” He stated simply, before sweeping out of the room, McGonagall following him.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Tears were leaking down Hagrid’s face before he could even see the little cottage. As he walked up the street, the violent destruction became evident. The cottage had virtually no roof left, the walls crumbling down and smoke still faintly wafting from a small fire on the ground floor. He quickened his pace and burst through the front door, pointing his flowery pink umbrella at the fire. Water spurted out and it died instantly. Hagrid listened, a faint cry was coming from upstairs. He found the staircase and headed up, turning to enter the only open doorway upstairs. As he approached the cot, he stared down, blinking slightly, unable to believe his own eyes.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Dumbledore appeared on Privet Drive with a sharp crack. A softer crack sounded seconds afterwards, McGonagall had apparated less than a meter away from him. “Always so peaceful aren’t they, muggle neighbourhoods?” Albus asked aloud, retrieving a small metal object from his pocket and clicking it. The lights from every street lamp went out and flew directly into the deluminator.</p><p>The entire street now laid in dark silence, only faint rustles of the wind blowing against bushes and trees could be heard. The two people waited silently, staring upwards as if waiting.</p><p>“I think this is him Albus” McGonagall said, looking up into the dark sky where two lights had appeared, much closer than the distant twinkling stars. The motorbike became closer and closer until Hagrid’s massive body could be seen upon it. Dumbledore and McGonagall moved aside, and seconds later the flying bike crashed down next to them on the road.</p><p>“Everything go well Hagrid ?” Dumbledore asked with a small smile, but it fell as he saw Hagrid’s concerned face. </p><p>"Well I don’t know what to tell yer Professor, so just have a look for yerself.” Dumbledore stepped forward, peering down into the blanket.</p><p>Two pairs of eyes stared up at him. One pair bright green, a red and jagged lightning bolt shaped scar newly etched upon the baby’s forehead. The other eyes were dark, almost black. The babies looked from each other, to Dumbledore, back to each other again.</p><p>“How can this be ? Did the Potters hide a second baby from the world ? What would be the purpose?” McGonagall asked, utterly astounded by what she saw in the blanket. </p><p> Dumbledore frowned, “I’m not sure Minerva, However I have met Harry before and I know that he is the one with the green eyes, his mother’s.”  He brushed his hand over the scar. “Apparently Voldemort has left a mark on him.” He looked concerned, but then regained a steady look. “The plan shall not change. We shall still leave Harry with his Aunt and Uncle. I will take the other baby back to Hogwarts, until we can find more out about their identity. Harry is the one in danger, the prophecy spoke only of one boy.”</p><p>Hagrid removed his giant scarf, handing it to Dumbledore to wrap around the second baby. The moment the two babies were separated, they both began to cry. “I don’t think they want to be apart Professor.” Hagrid chuckled. </p><p>"I don’t think we can expect the muggle relatives to take in both children Hagrid. I’m afraid we have no choice. Only Harry should be in danger after all, the second child can be raised by wizards, so long as they present magical ability.” Dumbledore explained. He hushed baby Harry, wrapped him tight in his blanket and attached a letter to him. He quietly stepped up the drive to number 4 and placed Harry on the front door step.</p><p>McGonagall looked down at the second baby, worry etched on her face. “He’s a he” Hagrid informed her, and she nodded. </p><p>"Albus, do we know anybody who would be looking for a child to raise?” She asked, but Dumbledore shook his head. </p><p>"I am not sure yet. But I am sure somebody will be willing. Although I think it is wise to not inform just everybody that the Potters had two sons. We shall have to come up with a new identity for him.”</p>
