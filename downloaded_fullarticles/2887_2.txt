    <b>Chapter 1: The Boy Who Lived</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
<li>I absolutely love the title of the first chapter, because it is so telling. Harry Potter has always been a story about life &amp; death, about loss &amp; grief, light&amp; darkness. Harry, as a character, has always been a symbol for life, light &amp; hope, for new beginnings and the world of the living. And in a weird meta foretelling it does right here already answers the question if Harry is going to survive or not. Of course he will live, because that has been who he always was.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>And of course we start this story about magic in the most unmagical place of all – at the home of the Dursleys. Of course from a narrative point it makes sense that Harry will stumble into the world of magic as unknowingly as the reader themselves, asking all the questions we might ask. But the Dursleys themselves are here because they present something familiar – everyone knows people like them, people who fear they could be anything other ordinary.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>“<em>They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense</em>.” - Even before we learn how they treated Harry I remember disliking them, because why wouldn’t you want to be involved in strange mysteries?</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>
<em>“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”</em> – Of course the most famous wizard of all time would be given the most common name. I bet there are a dozen of real Harry Potters out there, and they are all getting tired of your jokes.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>Dumbledore says that they hadn’t much to celebrate for the past eleven years – given that both Lily &amp; James were 21 when they died they both spent their entire time in Hogwarts and as young adults living in fear. Especially Lily who would have never experienced a magical world without Voldemort and Death Eaters. This might also explain why they married so young &amp; started a family right away.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>
<em>“… but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?’ ‘We can only guess,’ said Dumbledore. ‘We may never know.’”</em> – SPOILER: He did, in fact, know.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>I always found it weird that Harry really only had his aunt &amp; uncle as relatives left. I think the real reason might have been indeed that it was safer for Harry to grow up far away from the magical world, away from the fame he couldn’t understand, and some complicated magic that I don’t think will be explained until book 5.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>The other chosen one, as we later learn, was of course Neville. I think the biggest difference however would have been their upbringing. Neville would have still grown up with his grandmother, but with all the attention Dumbledore tried to avoid to bring to Harry.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>I wonder if McGonagall feared Harry would end up as a spoiled brat just like Dudley, when she voiced her concerns.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>
<em>“[…]there will be books written about Harry – every child in our world will know his name!”</em> – The most meta commentary ever.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>Oh yes, scars can be very useful. Like this one, who will always tell Harry when Voldemort is near or angry. Of course he has to keep it.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>I still can’t believe they left a one year old alone in the middle of the night in November. Three grown-ups decided this was the best they could do. Luckily none of them works with children – Oh, wait.</li>
</ul>
  <ul>
<li>Also a freaking letter? Clearly Dumbledore couldn’t be arsed to find some time to actually explain to the Dursleys what happened, or to tell Petunia her sister died in person.</li>
