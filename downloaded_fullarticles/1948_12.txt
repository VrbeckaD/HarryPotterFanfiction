    <p>Fred and George had been hard at work all morning shifting stock in the backroom of the shop at number 93 Diagon Alley. All was quiet except the occasional sneeze from stirred up dust and the sounds of wooden crates, laden with the outcome of countless hours of their work, landing heavily on the stone floor. They had propped the ancient window open with a defective trick wand in the hopes of bringing in fresh spring air to cool the perspiration on their brows. Usually they would do this sort of thing by magic, but the risk of dropping a crate and damaging their products was one they wouldn't take the day before their shop was due to open.</p><p>A sudden sound of wings drew their attention as Errol entered in through the open window and flew headfirst into the nearest stack of crates containing boxing telescopes, landing as a lump of pathetic gray feathers at the bottom.</p><p>"Bloody owl, who sent you all this way?" Fred asked, abandoning his crate and approaching the geriatric owl with exasperation. That was when he saw it- bright red and attached to Errol's leg was a howler. He no longer wondered who had sent the owl. Pulling the envelope free he called to his twin, "oi Gred!"</p><p>"Yes Forge?" George didn't bother to look over from the stack of crates that he was shifting.</p><p>"Our dear mother has written to us," the envelope was already smoking at one corner and growing hotter in his hands.</p><p>"What does she say? 'Congratulations on your spectacular exit from Hogwarts, you've made the family proud?'" </p><p>"I'm not sure, but we're both about to find out," he opened and let go of the burning letter, and almost instantly Molly Weasley's voice was thundering throughout the tiny space.</p><p>"FRED AND GEORGE WEASLEY! HOW COULD YOU BE SO RECKLESS? SWAMPS AND FIREWORKS AND TERRORISING A TEACHER? WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE ENOUGH ON OUR PLATES WITH THE ORDER AT THE MOMENT WITHOUT THIS JOKE SHOP RUBBISH! I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE ASHAMED OF THE PAIR OF YOU! YOU WILL FLY BACK TO HOGWARTS AT ONCE TO BEG NOT TO BE EXPELLED! YOU WILL CLEAN UP THAT SWAMP AND YOUR ACTS AND THERE WILL BE NO MORE TALK OF QUITTING SCHOOL!"</p><p>The envelope smoldered and dissolved into ashes at Fred's feet, his ears ringing in the sudden silence.</p><p>"Well that was pleasant," George said cheerfully, "how shall we respond?"</p><p>"Clearly she's upset she hasn't received an invitation to the Grand Opening," Fred answered with a smile.</p><p>"How rude of us to forget to invite the guest of honour, we'd better remedy that," George answered turning back to his crates.</p><p>"Indeed," Fred said, helping the exhausted bird to his feet.</p>
