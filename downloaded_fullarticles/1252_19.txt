<em>4:21pm, Remus</em>: Hey Harry, I hope you are doing good. Did you talk to your guardians? <br/>
<br/>
<em>4:23pm, Harry</em>: Hi! I'm alright, and you? No, not yet. I wasn't sure. <br/>
<br/>
<em>4:24pm, Remus</em>: Did you change your mind? It's completely okay, we'll understand. <br/>
<br/>
<em>4:25pm, Harry</em>: No! I didn't. I really want to live with the both of you. <br/>
<br/>
<em>4:27pm, Remus</em>: I see. You thought that we changed our mind?<br/>
<br/>
<em>4:29pm, Harry</em>: Well, it was a possibility, wasn't it?<br/>
<br/>
<em>4:30pm, Remus</em>: No Harry, it isn't. I know we didn't know each other for too long but me and Sirius want you in our life. We won't change our mind. <br/>
<br/>
<em>4:33pm, Harry</em>: Oh, I really want to be in your life too. I'll ask them to sign the papers, then. <br/>
<br/>
<em>4:35pm, Remus</em>: Do you want to come in my office after? We can take some tea.<br/>
<br/>
<em>4:36pm, Harry</em>: I'd love to! Could you help me for my history essay ?<br/>
<br/>
<em>4:38pm, Remus</em>: Of course! </p>
<hr/><p align="left"> </p><p><em>5:51pm, Harry:</em> Petunia, I know you don't want me to send you a message but it's important. Two peoples I met recently, want to actually adopt me. When I come home, could you sign the paper?<br/>
<br/>
<em>5:53pm, Petunia:</em> Why would I do that?<br/>
<br/>
<em>5:54pm, Harry:</em> You don't even like me, as you always said, I'm just a burden, right?<br/>
<br/>
<em>5:56pm, Petunia:</em> Fine, but I don't want to see you freak face ever again, did I make myself clear?</p><p><em>5:58pm, Harry</em>: Don't worry about that. </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p><em>7:34pm, Sirius:</em> Hey, how's school going? <br/>
<br/>
<em>7:36pm, Harry</em>: It's okay, I guess. I've still some problem with history and chemistry, but Remus helped me a little. We drank tea. <br/>
<br/>
<em>7:37pm, Sirius:</em> That's great sweetheart, I wanted to let you know that I would be here for your next match. <br/>
<br/>
<em>7:38pm, Harry:</em> Really? <br/>
<br/>
<em>7:40pm, Sirius:</em> I promise! I want to see you playing. Can you tell me when is it?<br/>
<br/>
<em>7:41pm, Harry:</em> Next saturday, the 20th! At 6pm!<br/>
<br/>
<em>7:42pm, Sirius</em>: Great! I'm excited to see you again, unfortunately I won't be at home this weekend, so I don't know if you plan to go at your aunt house or at our home, but I won't see you. <br/>
<br/>
<em>7:44pm, Harry:</em> It's alright, I actually don't know. Petunia said she would sign the paper. <br/>
<br/>
<em>7:46pm, Sirius:</em> I'll go with Remus sign the paper at her home probably tomorrow then. <br/>
<br/>
<em>7:47pm, Harry:</em> Do you need me to be here?<br/>
<br/>
<em>7:49pm, Sirius:</em> Nah, don't worry about it! Also, I had a question. Do you want us to change your name to Harry Potter-Lupin ?<br/>
<br/>
<em>7:50pm, Harry</em>: Does professor Lupin know about that? <br/>
<br/>
<em>7:51pm, Sirius:</em> Of course, he does. We talked about it last night. I'm not gonna lie, we'd really love if you'd take our surname but it's totally up to you. <br/>
<br/>
<em>7:54pm, Harry:</em> I'd really love to! <br/>
<br/>
<em>7:56pm, Sirius</em>: Awesome! I'll tell Remus the news, sweetheart. Call me tonight? Before going to bed?<br/>
<br/>
<em>7:58pm, Harry</em>: Don't need to ask twice! </p>

<em>7:59am, Ron:</em> come on! It's almost eight, I'm starving <br/>
<br/>
<em>8:00am, Harry:</em> You're always starving <br/>
<br/>
<em>8:01am, Harry:</em> Look in my closet, dickhead <br/>
<br/>
<em>8:02am, Ron</em>: You're a piece of shit, you know that?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<em>9:02am, Ron</em>: You don't want to be late because the teacher is professor Lupin, if it was chemistry you wouldn't care. <br/>
<br/>
<em>9:04am, Harry</em>: Well, there's a big difference between Remus and Snape. <br/>
<br/>
<em>9:15am, Ron</em>: Do you have some news from your aunt? The professor kept smiling at you <br/>
<br/>
<em>9:16am, Harry</em>: She said she'd sign the paper. <br/>
<br/>
<em>9:18am, Ron</em>: That's great mate!<br/>
<br/>
<em>9:19am, Harry:</em> Yeah, Sirius said he would be here for our next match<br/>
<br/>
<em> 9:21am, Ron</em>: Nervous?<br/>
<br/>
<em> 9:23am, Harry</em>: Kind of. I'm not used to have someone who would want to see me playing. What if, if we lose?<br/>
<br/>
<em>9:25am, Ron</em>: You know very well that we won't, and even if we do, it won't stop Sirius to adopt you. He'll be proud of you no matter what<br/>
<br/>
<em>9:27am, Harry:</em> If you say so.<br/>
<br/>
<em>9:31am, Ron</em>: Please, the first time he saw you, he wouldn't stop smiling. He already loves you. <br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><em>9:33am, Remus</em>: Hide me that phone before I take it, young man.<br/>
<br/>
<em> 9:34am, Harry:</em> oops.<br/>
<br/>
<em>9:36am, Remus</em>: Stop answering! <br/>
<br/>
<em> 9:37am, Remus</em>: I can see you smiling to your phone<br/>
<br/>
<em>9:38am, Harry:</em> What's the answer to question 4?<br/>
<br/>
<em>9:39am, Remus</em>: Really?<br/>
<br/>
<em>9:41am, Harry</em>: Wrong number!<br/>
<br/>
<em> 9:45am, Remus</em>: HARRY DO NOT CHEAT <br/>
<br/>
<em> 9:46am, Harry</em>: I was kidding!<br/>
<br/>
<em> 9:47am, Remus</em>: Do your exam!<br/>
<br/>
<em> 9:51am, Harry</em>: I've already finished it lmao<br/>
<br/>
<em>10:05am, Harry</em>: Did Sirius told you about what we talked yesterday?<br/>
<br/>
<em>10:06am, Remus</em>: He told me you were okay for changing your surname, and that we were going at your aunt's house to sign the paper at 2pm. Is there something else?<br/>
<br/>
<em>10:07am, Harry:</em> Well, you can say no, it's alright, but he said I could go at your home?<br/>
<br/>
<em>10:08am, Remus:</em> Darling, of course you're coming with me at our home. I'll wait for you at the parking, you know which one is my car, right?<br/>
<br/>
<em>10:12am, Harry:</em> Yes! Thank you! <br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><em>01:23pm, Hermione</em>: Why are you smiling like an idiot ?<br/>
<br/>
<em>01:24pm, Harry</em>: Sorry if my smile is bothering you <br/>
<br/>
<em>01:26pm, Hermione</em>: Stop being a little bitch.<br/>
<br/>
<em>01:28pm, Harry:</em> First of all, I'm tall <br/>
<br/>
<em>01:29pm, Hermione:</em> Oh yes, you're big big big grown man<br/>
<br/>
<em>01:31am, Harry:</em> yes <br/>
<br/>
<em>01:32pm, Harry:</em> I'm just happy bc of the adoption. And Remus said I can go at their home today. <br/>
<br/>
<em>01:34pm, Hermione</em>: You thought you weren't going?<br/>
<br/>
<em> 01:35pm, Harry:</em> I don't know. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy with them adopting me but wouldn't it be better for them to adopt someone younger? <br/>
<br/>
<em>01:37pm, Hermione</em>: If they wanted a baby, they would have adopted a baby. They want you to be their, so one or fifteen year old, it doesn't matter. <br/>
<br/>
<em> 01:39pm, Harry:</em> I just don't want them to regret it. <br/>
<br/>
<em> 01:41pm, Hermione:</em> Harry, breath. They want you, no one else. They won't regret it, I've been your bestfriend for the past five years, and I don't regret befriended you. <br/>
<br/>
<em>01:42pm, Harry:</em> Okay, yeah, you're probably right.<br/>
<br/>
<em>01:43pm, Hermione</em>: Repeat after me, “I'm valid and I'm worth it. People cares about me.”<br/>
<br/>
<em>01:44pm, Harry</em>: I'm valid and I'm worth it. People cares about me.<br/>
<br/>
<em>01:44pm, Hermione</em>: Wasn't so hard, was it?<br/>
<br/>
<em>01:46pm, Harry</em>: No it wasn't mum <br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><em>05:56pm, Harry</em>: Hey, can I ask you a question ?<br/>
<br/>
<em>05:58pm, Sirius:</em> Hey sweetheart, of course you can<br/>
<br/>
<em> 05:59pm, Harry:</em> Well, are you sure it's a good idea to adopt me?<br/>
<br/>
<em>06:02pm, Sirius:</em> sweetheart, personally I think it's the better idea I've ever had.<br/>
<br/>
<em>06:03pm, Harry:</em> It's just I'm fifteen, and you and Remus could adopt a baby or a child. <br/>
<br/>
<em>06:05pm, Sirius:</em> But we want you, not a baby or a child <br/>
<br/>
<em>06:06pm, Harry:</em> are you sure?<br/>
<br/>
<em>06:09pm, Sirius:</em> I'm more than sure. You're worth it Harry. <br/>
<br/>
