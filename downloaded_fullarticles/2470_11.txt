    <p>“All the time we were together, I was thinking about him.”</p><p>Harry didn’t dare look up in the silence that followed. They’d been talking about Ginny for what, three sessions now? And Harry had thought about saying those words out loud over and over again, only to swallow them back into the pit of emptiness that was his chest, too ashamed to admit it. Too scared it would become real the moment he voiced it.</p><p>“Was this why you were so quiet last week?” Jane asked. “Because you wanted to tell me this, but couldn’t get the words out?”</p><p>How did she know him so well? <em> Therapists have superpowers, mate</em>, Ron would’ve said.</p><p>His voice shook when he mumbled a strained, “Maybe.” He swallowed. Lying was no use, was it? “...Yeah.”</p><p>“What kind of thoughts did you have about him?”</p><p>The fact she knew exactly who that ‘him’ referred to without Harry having to say his name upset him. Had he really talked that much about Draco?</p><p>“I… I’d tell Ginny about my day, and when she replied, I’d imagine what he would say in her place. I’d think about him while I cooked — about how he’s always saying how much he loves an extra bit of salt on his food. I’d—” He bit his lip. Was he really going to say it? “I’d fantasise about him, too. In… bed.”</p><p>And to think he’d started going to therapy because he'd died and come back to life… he felt deeply embarrassed, but the tightness in his chest was already starting to ease as he let out the thoughts he’d been fighting to keep inside.</p><p>Merlin, but did he feel weird.</p><p>“Do you still think about him now that you’re single?”</p><p>Harry raised his head when he realised he was staring at his own fidgety hands. He smiled awkwardly at her. “You know I do.”</p><p>She smirked back at him. “I do. I wanted to know if you’d admit it.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, that wasn’t easy to say,” he mumbled, trying to lighten the mood. Then he forced his next thought out before he could change his mind. “I should also admit that… that I think I love him. I… I may have for a very long time now. I’m not sure, though.”</p><p>“What’s your definition of love?”</p><p>Ah, that was the question, wasn’t it? Perhaps if he knew the answer he wouldn’t be so damn lost, but alas, Harry hadn’t exactly had much love in his life. Not even when he’d thought he had.</p><p>“I don’t know. If I’m honest, I only called it <em> love </em> because that’s the word everyone uses when they can’t stop thinking about someone else, and about just <em> being </em>with them.” He was fidgeting again, but he couldn't do anything about it. “I just want Draco by my side, all the time. I adore his sarcastic remarks, and I like it when he talks Quidditch with me, and — Merlin, I even love the way he sneezes, he’s just too cute. And when I’m with him, it’s like… like we walk at the same pace. When I’m with him, I don’t feel like being left alone, which usually happens with everyone else but Ron and Hermione.”</p><p>When he looked up again, Jane was smiling, this time in amusement. Harry brought a hand to his hair, sighing. He felt so stupid.</p><p>“I think what you’re describing matches the definition of <em> infatuation</em>, Harry. Or as you kids call it nowadays… a <em> crush. </em> There’s nothing wrong with that, of course, but seeing as it’s been going on for so long and it’s making you upset, perhaps it’s time to consider doing something about it.”</p><p>A chill passed through Harry, and the only thought he could process was that he did <em> not </em>want to cut Draco from his life. Under no circumstances.</p><p>“Do you mean that as in…”</p><p>“I mean it as in doing something you haven’t tried before. Like telling a friend how you feel, or perhaps, if you think it’s safe, telling <em> him </em>how you feel. Do you trust him enough to do that? Do you think he’d be understanding about it?”</p><p>“I—” Harry stuttered. “I mean, we’re friends. More or less. But I don’t think I can do it.” Or could he? Fuck, the mere idea was unravelling a sea of hypothetical scenarios in his mind, and each one was crazier than the last. But there was just too much between them. And how would he even explain? How could he tell Draco he’d been fantasising about him while dating Ginny? What if he ruined their friendship?</p><p>What if… what if Draco liked him too?</p><p>Feeling brave, he closed his fists to keep his fingers still and said the words that were blooming inside him, powerful and thrilling. “Or… you know what? Perhaps I can try.”</p>
