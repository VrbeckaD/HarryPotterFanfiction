    <p>Draco stood in the Hogwarts grand hall. He was alone, lonely but not sad. He was staring off into space. His deep and dark thought of death the universe and everything. His thoughts were really deep man even though he was only a teenager. Everyone else just didn’t understand. </p><p>He thought about harry potter. Boy did he hate that stupid arrogent asshat with his beautiful raven black locks and sparkling emerald orbs. Harry potter was draco's true antithesis. They were complete opposites. Always fighting both verbally and physically. They had a true hate that ran deeper than even Draco’s thoughts on death. </p><p>Suddenly Dubledore entered the great hall</p><p>“I have an announcement. Due to the Global pandemic of covid-19 we are pushing up the field trip to space, both to socially distance and to escape the virus raveging down here on earth. So pls check the wall for your room assignment.”</p><p>Draco slowly and romantically saunter over to check the wall to see who he would have to unfortunatly be rooming with for an undisclosed amount of time in the cold dark reaches of space. Who he saw made is throat drop into his cheast….. It was…… HARRY POTTER!!!!</p><p>“Ha look im rooming with that little fuck draco” Harry laughed maliciously to his two friends Hermione and Ron.</p><p>Draco had always had unrequited feelings for hermione. She hated him thogh. She called him racist but he loved hudbloods like her. It was just his father who believed in voldemoert. </p><p>“Stop it will you” Draco yelled angerly “ Or ill make your life in space true hell.” </p><p>“Try it and i’ll slit your throuat and watch your pure wizard blue run red all over your bed. Don’t try telling anyone about that threat and no one will belive you, I’m harry potter the boy who lived. The magical boy who saved the world, your some lil emo boy with daddy issues who supports the evil he who must not be name.” </p><p>Draco had nothing to say. All he could do was cry. He ran up the stairs into his room. Why couldn’t he just die. He’d rather die than live with Harry Potter, that horrible boy in space. But thats life and we really have no control ever. We are just pawns to sistuation. Slaves to the ideas of others, and then we die. Draco thoguht this while he cried.</p>
