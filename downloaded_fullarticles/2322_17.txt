    <p>1979</p><p><br/>“I’m sorry Mr. Potter, but we weren’t able to save your wife,” said the doctor when she got out of the operating room. "There was a complication. The...”</p><p> </p><p>The next words coming out of the doctor's mouth were white noise to him as he prosessed the grave news.  </p><p>
  <br/>
  <em>Oh, Mia. </em>
</p><p><br/>Harry couldn’t help but blamed himself for her death. He knew about her untimely death, yet…</p><p>
  <br/>
  <em>There’s nothing you can do Harry. If it is my fate, then it is what it is. I’m just glad that I’ve met you and I got to have this little baby growing inside of me. It’s been a great life, you know? </em>
</p><p><br/>After the war and the devastating death of his two best friends, Harry couldn’t handle the pressure of being famous and alone; thus, he took the time off of England to explore the world. He always wanted to go to America, so that’s where he met his wife.</p><p><br/>Mia Antonia Russo was his first friend in America. They met under unfortunate circumstance, where she was going to jump off a bridge when he met her and saved her from making her biggest mistake.</p><p><br/>And under emotional grieve, one thing let to another, which meant they had a one night stand where an 18 year old Harry impregnated the 18 year old recently orphan girl, whom was suicidal. His intention to console a mourning girl led into both of them being young parents. Fortunately, the pregnancy led to an unexpected occasion for the both of them.</p><p><br/>Of course, when they found out about the pregnancy, Harry immediately pursued Mia to marry him. There was no way he would let Mia be a single mother at such a young age. And by marrying to him, Harry could tell Mia about the wizarding world and ensured her and their child’s life with Potter and Black inheritance.</p><p><br/>This pregnancy has helped Mia got her spirit to live back. She smiled more than before and bought many baby clothes. She read stories to her tummy at night and cooed at her big bump. The girl turned woman couldn’t be happier when the baby kicked in response.</p><p><br/>This baby brought hope of having a family of his own back to Harry. He couldn’t help but be amazed and excited at the thought of being a father. After Death claimed him as her master, he dismissed his dream of having a family. Of having a little girl or a boy who would call him Dad.</p><p><br/>Then, death whispered to him one night, that Mia was going to die if their baby was to be born. Devastated could not even be compared to what he felt that moment. It’s cruel to have to choose between the child that he loved and the wife he was hoping to have a long future with. The woman whom, not only he saved but in turn saved him from sadness and wandering aimlessly.</p><p><br/>Still, the choice was taken off of his hands the moment Mia pestered him about what’s bothering him.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <em>I’ve just got an extended time when I met you, Harry. You and our baby save me. Now, at least when I die, I get to save you from loneliness and bring ‘Anthony’ into this world. </em>
</p><p><br/>His wife has been prepared to sacrifice her life when even the thought of sacrificing one life he cherished for another he loved couldn’t be processed by Harry’s mind. Mia was always the strongest of them both, even when her mental health was delicate.</p><p><br/>As the doctor brought him to see their baby, Harry was in the state of denial. The young father felt the moment his wife took her last breath because of his control over death itself; yet, he wasn’t able to grasp the fact that his friend and dear wife has left the world.</p><p><br/>The thought circling in his mind right now was what would he tell Anthony when he grew up? That his mum chose death to bring him into this world? That Harry let his mum died because he loved him more than her? That even though his da was the master of Death, he couldn’t mess with fate? That he was glad that his mum had chosen Anthony over herself? Letting her fragile mind controlled her choices?</p><p><br/>“There you are, Mr. Potter.” A nurse called him when he entered a white plain room where the hospital put the babies to rest in their tiny private boxes. She was holding a blue bundle of baby with a little tuff of black hair appearing from under it in her arms. “Here is your daddy, little boy.”</p><p><br/>His focus broke the moment the nurse hand the bundle of joy onto him. He was met with the most intelligent brown eyes in the world. The eyes that he inherited from his mum. The grieve and self-hatred was tucked into the deepest part of his mind the moment those pair of beautiful eyes looked at him curiously.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <em>I have a feeling that you and Anthony will do great things in the future.</em>
</p><p><br/>For the first time in his life, Harry felt in love.</p><p align="center"><br/>***</p><p>Three hours later…</p><p><br/>It was…</p><p><br/>Nobody would have imagined that something soo stupid as the press could ever exist in the world.</p><p><br/>Not in a million years would Harry thought that by letting Anthony be held for a moment by a woman, would let the press go wild. Turned out, the sad mother whom just lost her baby was none other than Maria Stark herself.</p><p><br/>No one could predict that one of the press would sneak up into the well guarded hospital and took a photo of her holding his darling Anthony.</p><p><br/>In under an hour, the whole city knew about his baby. And under a couple of hours so did the whole United States of America. And soon the whole world would know. The worst thing was that they thought Anthony was the Stark heir.</p><p>He never wanted this for his son. Never wanted him to be under everybody's gaze and microscope. It was uncomfortable for him, he couldn't imagine his son being brought up under the keen eyes of strangers and the whole world.</p><p><br/>But, there was nothing he could possibly have done to prevent this. He could not just obliviate the whole world. He was a grieving father and husband, and this mess wasn’t supposed to happen.</p><p><br/>His plan was to have a quiet service and cremation for Mia, then go home and think of the ways to take care of his baby and be a single parent. Not having to deal with Mr. Stark (whom soo old, he thought the man was Mrs. Stark’s father, not her HUSBAND) or the heartbroken Mrs. Stark (whom in her 40’s and had a miscarriage in the last stages of pregnancy, or so he was told).</p><p><br/>They were a prominent strong couple. This misunderstanding could blow their company’s stocks if the truth were to get out. Yet, Harry couldn’t care less for what’s happening to the Starks. He just wanted to be alone with his Anthony and grieved for his wife’s passing.</p><p> </p><p>The idea of running back to England passed his mind for a second, but the nightmares of war and death kept haunting him. England has always been his home, but since the death of Sirius and later everybody he loved, Harry couldn't stay there without seeing and remembering what he had lost in that country. Even though he had a godson there, it wouldn't be enough reason for him to step back into the land of his birth. </p><p> </p><p>Harry thought to himself, he could have gone travelling. He and Anthony could have just do the whole sightseeing of the world. </p><p> </p><p>But then, Harry put those thoughts away. A child needed stability. His son needed a home. A permanent home would be better. A place where he could grow up, learn and have friends, like what Hogwarts was to him. </p><p> </p><p>Harry himself was only 19 and it's not like he hasn't had confidence in himself to raise a child, but he himself has always dreamt of having a family, particularly a big family. Like when he had Sirius, Remus, Ron and Hermione with him. </p><p> </p><p>When he looked at Mr. And Mrs. stark, the way they really mourned for their baby and the love they have for their baby if only he lived, shown through their sadness, it helped to ease Harry's mind and his decision about their characters. </p><p> </p><p>This old couple wasn't only thinking of their reputation, they genuinely wanted to help (even if the arrogant husband still tried to keep his true feelings to himself), especially Mrs. stark. The hesitation yet loving look she had as she held Anthony, moved Harry. The lady just wanted a baby, but didn't want to monopolize him.</p><p> </p><p>Then he made up his mind.</p><p> </p><p>After a long discussion, he confided with the Stark couple. He would let his son be named Stark as long as the boy knew who his real father was and Harry got to stay with him no matter what happened. The only one who knew the truth would be the Stark couple, Harry and The Jarvis couple. (mr. stark had assured him that they were loyal and trustworthy)</p><p><br/>The Brit would be a protégé to the Stark’s family butler, to hide his real identity as the boy’s birth father and as reason for having Harry around Anthony. He could teach his boy about his heritage and secretly tutored him from a child since sending Anthony to a wizarding school would jeopardize his identity as Anthony Stark and put a target on his back as Harry’s son. (Not all Voldemort’s followers have been captured by the ministry)</p><p><br/>Anthony would be treated well and loved by them; therefore, the second Harry see Anthony got treated badly whether they were verbal or physical abuse, Harry promised that the couple would never see them again. After living in an abusive household for a decade and a half, Harry would never let his son go through what he went through.</p><p><br/>In return, Harry got to have help in raising his boy. The perks of not being a single father or lonely also allured Harry. He felt hope blooming inside of him. This was his second chance at gaining a family. For himself and his boy.</p><p><br/>Thus, the birth of one Harry James Evans and Anthony Edward Stark to the world.</p><p align="center"><br/>***</p>
