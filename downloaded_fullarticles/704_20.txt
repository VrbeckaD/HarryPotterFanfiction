    <p>
  <span>Every day only felt worse than the one before. Yes, Lily loved her job, but every day took just enough out of her that she couldn’t recover with sleep. Getting out of bed was one problem - she’d only woken up more and more tired, even though she started to let herself sleep in later and later.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it was at night when she felt the worst - when she was alone, struggling not to think about work, but unsure of how to actually settle into something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wished James were here. It was the fourth week in a row he was away, and she still had no idea when he was coming back. If he were here, he could help her stop thinking and remember that everything’s okay now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, her brain only imagined wild scenarios: James’ tour bus getting stranded, or him getting kidnapped on a plane. James getting hospitalized with no way to call her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All she could do was thumb through the notebook he’d left her. She re-read the note on the first page before flipping to today’s date.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lils,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’re sending me away for a while. It’s a long promotion tour, so I’m really not sure where we’re going. I love you, and I wrote you something for every day I might be gone. Hope it’s enough, for now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Love,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tonight’s note was the second part of a story he’d been telling her. She tried to imagine his voice reading it. Her laying on his chest as he spoke, feeling the vibrations echo through his lungs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yesterday, the story’s protagonist ended on a cliffhanger. He was a spy, and he received a tip about precious cargo that he was sent to find and capture.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Except, instead of being information, it was a woman. By the time he’d found her, so had the other side, and he had seconds to escape with her before they gunned them both down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily was thankful that neither of them faced such a thing. She was a doctor, and while sometimes her patients gave her trouble, most of them only had acute injuries that could be treated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James was a writer, and for some reason his work had become a hit abroad. His management company swept him up on a multi-country tour, and he was so busy that they’d barely had a chance to call one a week.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the story, the protagonist and the woman escaped by jumping across a rooftop, finding a pay phone, and calling the spy’s emergency line for rescue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Curiously, the number was written out on the page. It was a specific detail that the rest of the stories normally omitted, and it caught Lily’s attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On a whim, Lily decided to call it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A woman answered the line, and offered the same greeting as the story: “Hello, this is the Grand Hotel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily tried the pass-phrase: “Prongs over the gate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hold please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the other end of the line, a man picked up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Shite. This is Lily, yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is she.” Panic shot through her spine. In the story, the emergency line meant they were in serious danger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look, shite. It wasn’t supposed to get this bad, and he was supposed to be home before you got to this story. My name’s Sirius, I’m James’ partner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily remained silent - she was confused, but in the back of her mind, one of her crazy ideas began to sound less crazy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shite. Okay, here’s the quick and dirty. James has been working with MI6 for the last few years. I’m his handler. He’s been undercover for weeks and missed his last check-in. He left this number in the book in case something happened to him. Don’t worry - his life’s not in danger. But it means something’s made him play up his character.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wh-what does that mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It means we need you to get him out.”</span>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <b>Moldova. Nov. 25th.</b>
</p><p>
  <span>James walked through the large castle doorways with a confident swagger. He didn’t actually feel so confident - he really was just a writer, despite what his MI6 handler might suggest. Typically, all they ask him to do is offer copies of his books to persons of interest. The books were probably edited - coded for agents, or bugs or something - but he never asked and they never said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Today’s mission, though, was a bit special. He was tasked for a personal book delivery to Elisabeth Fortuna, Duchess of Moldova herself. The massive castle loomed in front of him, and he felt a little pinch of worry sa he stepped through the doors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was just a drop off, but somehow, the Duchess was related to a case that none of his handlers could figure out. Other agents had disappeared for a few days, missed a checkpoint, and got sent home, but until they managed to get to their house, it was almost like they’d had a concussion. They had forgotten key details, like why they were out on the mission in the first place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He figured, though, that this would be quick. The butler or some other would take the package, ask him to sign them personally, and he’d be on his way. It was better that way, because he still had a book signing to get through before he could finally call Lily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been a long three weeks of not seeing Lily, and each day he missed her more and more. He was hesitant to accept the press tour for his books - because of the unsure length (</span>
  <em>
    <span>“We’ll fit as many in as will have us. This is an opportunity to break into a fresh market James!”</span>
  </em>
  <span>, his manager had said) and because it would take him right through not so friendly territory, something he tried to avoid during missions for MI6. But it really was an incredible opportunity, and Lily had told him she’d be in a busy season for patients anyway, so he’d accepted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He blushed thinking about her. Or rather, thinking about the last time they were together - the night before he left. He had given her the storybook he’d written once he’d agreed to go, months worth of stories and love notes to remind her of him while he was away. And then - he hid his smirk behind a closed fist and feigned a cough - he recited his vows to her slowly, mouthing them into her skin and -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Footsteps interrupted his thoughts, and he hastily recollected himself. Down the staircase came a tall woman, wearing a long gown and an expensive headpiece.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Potter, a pleasure to meet you,” she said, quickly crossing the space between them to shake his hand. “I am Duchess Fortuna, but you may call me Liza.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still holding her hand, he gave a quick bow. “My pleasure to meet you. I have a case of my books for you - I heard you were quite the fan?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James was willing to leave his charm on - he didn’t use it much since being married, but it certainly had its perks. He ran his hand through his hair before raising the bag of books in his hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, come sit. My assistant will take the books to my study, but I wanted to ask you a few questions before you left. You have some time, yes?” She was already walking past him, towards another grand set of doors that led to a sitting room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The conversation was surprisingly pleasant. She was quite a fan - she knew to ask about the most minute of characters, and was curious about where the story of the next set of books were headed. She seemed so aloof that ,for a moment, he wondered why MI6 would want him to run a mission to her home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tea, Mr. Potter?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just James, please. And yes please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An assistant dressed in a sharp suit brought him a cup of tea, and he took a sip. He hadn’t yet had proper tea in Moldova. Despite being a beautiful country, it certainly didn’t have English tea. But this cup was just sweet enough to be pleasant, and just bitter enough to be sharp.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He drank most of the cup through the conversation, and as he did, he began to feel drowsy</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you a married man, James?” The Duchess had a smirk on her face that made James feel uncomfortable. He didn’t much believe in the sixth sense, but he’d been on enough missions to know that this feeling was bad news.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Liza. In fact, once we wrap up here, I’m on my way to give her a call.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s her name? Is she lovely?” Again, that smirk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lily. I miss her to death,” he replied. “If you don’t mind, I’ll be on my way out in a moment, I have another reading in the city as well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Liza watched him for a moment, then checked her watch - wait, was she always wearing that watch? The colors of her dress began to blend together, reds spun into white. James knew he needed to get out of there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A shame,” said Liza.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stood, but before he could take a step, his legs gave out on him. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Shit, the tea.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>James managed to mouth the words “Lily” before falling unconscious.</span>
