          <div class="userstuff"><p>We sat in the grove, our hands entwined,<br/>As I told you of a world that you’d soon find,<br/>You looked at me with eyes so bright,<br/>To learn of it from me despite<br/>The knowledge that your sister’s heart,<br/>Would fill with hate, that you must part.<br/>The curious glint within your eye,<br/>Awoke in mine a vain reply,<br/>My heart was filled with something new,<br/>A feeling that I must pursue.<br/>But knowing that it was too soon,<br/>The moment was not opportune,<br/>I waited to speak, to well reveal,<br/>The object of my heart’s appeal.<br/>But as we grew, I soon did find,<br/>That you are far above my kind.<br/>And so my love I did conceal,<br/>Comforted that it was real,<br/>But afraid that it was unreturned,<br/>That if told, my love be spurned.<br/>We sit in the grove, no more entwined,<br/>And how I wish I were unconfined.</p></div>
