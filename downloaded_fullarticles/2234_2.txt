  <strong>Grindeldore- “Since when are we getting married?”</strong>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Bathilda entered her house, excited to see there the ones she had just been thinking of.</p><p>“Why hello, Albus.” She said cheerily.</p><p>Albus stood, following Gellert as he formally greeted the ageing woman, “Sorry for inviting myself. Gellert promised you wouldn’t mind.”</p><p>“Of course he is right.” She assured. The words held even more truth today, “It is always good to see you.” She looked over the pair, “Very good indeed.” She seemed as a young child with a secret, just barely containing it, “Please sit.” She motioned.</p><p>Albus nodded, accepting her offer.</p><p>Gellert noticed how different his aunt was acting from usual, “Is there something you would like to say? Something for me to do?” Gellert asked. Normally Bathilda would leave them be. But she just stare at them… waiting. For what? Neither boy knew.</p><p>“No no.” She spoke all too quickly, “But if you have something to tell <em>me</em> you know I am always here.”</p><p>Gellert suddenly had a very uneasy feeling, thinking he may have forgotten something he shouldn’t, “Not particularly.” It couldn’t be such a concern if his aunt was in such high spirits.</p><p>“I see.” Bathilda seemed a bit saddened at this, “Maybe later then.” She left her offer open, turning to leave the two.</p><p>After she left the room Gellert and Albus exchanged a confused expression.</p><p>But it was not important enough to distract them from their latest lead.</p><p>A few hours passed of relative normality. Once and a while Albus would catch Bathilda peering in at them, only to disappear when she was noticed.</p><p>Such strange behavior, almost manically giddy.</p><p>“I hope she is alright.” It seemed as though Gellert had also noticed.</p><p>“She has a habit of drinking too much tea when a new book deadline is coming close.” Albus already knew of his neighbors pattern, “Perhaps it is a result of that?”</p><p>It was a rational enough explanation.</p><p>“Boys. Tea is ready.” Bathilda called.</p><p>Albus smiled smugly, as though the call had proven his point, “Care to take a break?” He asked, welcoming the distraction if it was tea.</p><p>And Gellert agreed, following the other as he made his way to the table.</p><p>Bathilda was already seated, hands folded in front of her... waiting.</p><p>“Thank you very much.” Albus said, wondering if they should advise against her consuming any more tea.</p><p>But Bathilda did not seem the least bit interested in the beverage before her.</p><p>“You do not seem like yourself.” Gellert finally spoke, no longer able to ignore it, “Did something happen?</p><p>He did not expect the reaction they received.</p><p>“I’m just so happy.” Whatever she had been holding back all day was released as she got up quickly from her chair, rushing over to embrace the two boys, “Congratulations!”</p><p>“On what?”</p><p>Bathilda pulled away, swatting at them playfully, “On your engagement, of course? Really, did you think I wouldn’t find out.”</p><p>“Since when are we getting married?” Gellert questioned, looking toward Albus with wide eyes, “Don’t tell me-“</p><p>“Please don’t look at me, I made no such plans.” Albus tried to assure, hoping it would calm the other’s fear.</p><p>But Gellert only seemed offended, “Why would you not want to marry me?”  </p><p>“Gellert… we can’t!” Albus reminded, surprised that was what his partner was choosing to focus on. He turned to Bathilda, as Gellert continued to grumble something under his breath, “Professor, where did you hear this news?”</p><p>“You told your father so.” She motioned to her nephew, still not fully realizing that this was all just a misunderstanding, “He has such a big mouth and just had to write me for information.”</p><p>Now it was Albus’s turn to be surprised, “You wrote your <strong>father</strong>… and about<strong> us</strong>?” He was doubly shocked, “But we can’t marry.” He reminded again.</p><p> “Apparently-” Gellert crossed his arms, “-even if we could, it doesn’t seem as though you’d want to.”</p><p>“I had assumed you would have had a simple hand fasting. But now your father is hounding for details and your mother is dreaming plans for a large ceremony.” Bathilda continued.</p><p>Gellert seemed to snap back to reality at this. Realizing the true magnitude of the situation, “But why do they think this? I do not remember the specifics, but my letter to father was very ordinary, a formality.”</p><p>“So you aren’t engaged?”</p><p>“No.” Albus shook his head, adding when he saw Gellert glaring at him through the corner of his eye, “Not that it wouldn’t be wonderful for us to be.”</p><p>This seemed to satisfy the other for now.</p><p>“Oh, what a problem we have on our hands.” Bathilda whispered to herself, realizing what a mistake she had made.</p><p>Gellert only shrugged, I will just write father another letter and let him know he was mistaken.</p><p>“Not that.” Bathilda looked away a bit embarrassed, “I was so very excited when I received the owl this morning. And when I was out in town I ran into …”</p><p>
  <em>Please don’t say … please don’t say…</em>
</p><p>But it was.</p><p>“Aberforth.”</p><p>And Albus felt as though he might faint on the spot.</p><p>Luckily Aberforth would never tell a soul. But Albus couldn’t imagine the explaining that would have to be done when he returned home that evening.</p>
