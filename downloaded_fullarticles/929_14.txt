    <p>"Potter, Harry" The stern Scottish woman called from her parchment.</p>
<p>Poppy yawned discreetly, after the excitement and thrill of the train journey she was feeling rather weary. Not to mention the scars on her back were itching as she hadn't applied any ointment since she first woke up.</p>
<p>Part of her was thrilled to be here another was rather bored. She had read the customary <em>Hogwarts, a history </em>which was honestly a great read but some facts seemed a bit embellished and other facts curiously absent. Poppy honestly didn't think she would ever be here. Her papa wasn't too fond of Hogwarts. Then again, her uncle attended Hogwarts and made a few comments about what house she might be in before he died and she went to live with her papa. She couldn't really remember because she was so young but thought back fondly on him talking about the Houses.</p>
<p>Poppy watched in fascination as the <em>Harry Potter </em>sat upon the stool, the sorting hat looking ridiculously large atop his head. He was just a young boy – surprisingly her age – and looked no greater than any other first year. In fact, he looked scruffier and smaller than most. Poppy evaluated the boy in front of her with shrewd eyes like she was taught. Untidy, home cut hair meaning his guardian doesn't care about his outward appearance and presentation to the world. Reasonably expensive robes, tailored but not buttoned and wearing in the correct manner so he has money but no one has shown him the differences in styles. Glasses were outdated, unfashionable and looked cheap. Thin and small. Very thin and small. Quiet manner looks uncomfortable in front of a crowd and is hunching as if ashamed – low self-esteem and confidence. From her knowledge of Harry Potter, he was an orphan like her. His guardians must not care for him. Not physically abused, but emotionally and mentally? Yes, neglected. He cares too much what others think of him but doesn't know how to make a good public front, definitely neglect but not too severely.</p>
<p>As Poppy analysed the boy, she remembered what her papa said to her, <em>"Poppy dear, Harry Potter survived a killing curse but this does not make him powerful. He is merely a part of the bigger picture. Different magic and forces protected him, those unique circumstances happen once in a lifetime but nothing the boy did, or is, had any influence. If it was you, it would have had the same outcome"</em></p>
<p>Poppy knows she shouldn't look up to the papa anymore. After all, she did run away and start a new life at bloody Hogwarts to get <em>away</em> from him. But he <em>never</em> lied to her. She didn't agree with his dark magic and twisted view of the world but he was rarely wrong. Try as she might, she still loved him.</p>
<p>Shaking her head she came back into focus as the sorting hat screamed, "<em>GRYFFINDOR"</em></p>
<p>The table on the right roared and praised the boy-who-lived as a member of their House. She actually thought some might be weeping. Poppy felt pity for the boy, she knew what it was like to try and live up to unachievable expectations. She decided then she would try to give some normalcy to him.</p>
<p>"<em>Stark, Poppy" </em>The Scottish women called again.</p>
<p>Poppy made her way confidently to the front. She had an easy smile and big hopeful eyes but inside she was sweating and heart was pounding.</p>
<p>That was because Poppy had no idea <em>why </em>she received a Hogwarts letter.</p>
<p>You see, she was abandoned in an orphanage just before her first birthday. She never knew her biological parents but was luckily adopted by her uncle. He was a British Wizard and attended Hogwarts but only <em>actual</em> British citizens ever received letters. It meant that she, herself, was British. It gave her a tiny clue to her identity - though something that could be reasonably assumed - it was now confirmed. Her uncle never spoke to her about where she came from or who her parents were but it was quite possible, very possible, if they were magical (which statistically was more likely) they would have attended Hogwarts.</p>
<p>She didn't know if the Professors would recognise her, maybe she looked like her parents? Or her <em>sperm donor and egg carrier </em>she preferred to think of them as. The ignored the old familiar pang of shame when thinking of being abandoned. She never knew why she was unwanted and from then on a desire to <em>be the best </em>was her goal in life... Unfortunately, that path led her to her papa after her uncle's death.</p>
<p>Anyway, Poppy didn't have a second name and the letter didn't even state a surname as she couldn't really go by her uncle's surname and <em>definitely </em>would not go by her papas.</p>
<p>In the letter to accept, she wrote her current second name and it must have been added.</p>
<p>As Poppy sat on the stool, she ignored the stunned and cliche '<em>like she's seen a ghost look</em>' from the Professor at her side as Poppy looked back and smiled calmly. She hoped to god no one knew of her biological donors. Poppy's hair was dark – almost black and eyes a bright emerald. Her hair was streaked with two white lines that framed her face. This was the result of her great escape from her papa and proof of her animagus form. She tried to dye the hair but it would not budge. The pure white lines would stay. Evidence.</p>
<p>The hat was placed atop her head.</p>
<p>'<em>Now now... where to put you...' </em>The hat spoke inside her mind.</p>
<p>Poppy did not outwardly react to the surprise. Making brief eye contact with the Professor, she saw the woman visibly startle at seeing her eyes, her own brown orbs widening in response. She ignored her.</p>
<p><em>'I don't suppose Slytherin?' </em>She asked hopefully.</p>
<p>The hat chuckled and replied, <em>'You do have surprisingly sharp cunning and ruthless mind for a child but these traits aren't you natural for you. I understand you rebelled quite strongly against this...'</em></p>
<p>Poppy felt a stab of panic and shame at the mention.</p>
<p><em>'You have little to no ambition and this would not suit Slytherin, perhaps Ravenclaw might suit you well... truly brilliant mind. You will go far, of that I have no doubt. I have never been wrong. Very loyal, hard working, seen horrors no one, never mind </em>child<em> should have seen...'</em></p>
<p>Poppy ignored the thundering of her heart and kept her limbs relaxed, a look of small nervousness and excitement masked firmly on her face.</p>
<p>She felt eyes boring into her back from the Professor's table and the looks the Professor at her side was giving someone behind her wasn't helping.</p>
<p>
  <em>'I believe either Slytherin or Gryffindor for you, your preferred choice?'</em>
</p>
<p><em>'Slytherin' </em>She replied immediately, with a little relief.</p>
<p>The hat seemed to hum, <em>'are you sure not Gryffindor? you would do exceptionally well there. House of the brave. Your strongest trait is your courage and resilience. It was very brave to leave everything behind to start a new life'</em></p>
<p><em>'No, Slytherin's fine for me. I'm bloody </em>tired <em>of being brave' </em>She replied, irritation seeping into her body. Who wanted to be brave? No, it was something you <em>had </em>to be, not wanted to be. Being afraid and doing what has to be done to survive. That was bravery. It wasn't something she wished upon anybody. Why would she want to keep being afraid?</p>
<p>The hat nodded on her head, <em>'good choice, many great witches and wizards have come from Slytherin House'</em></p>
<p>Poppy immediately scowled and struggled to keep her face impassive, <em>'I don't want to be </em><strong>great</strong>' she protested internally, <em>'I want to be </em><strong>good</strong>'</p>
<p>Almost immediately the hat bellowed, "GRYFFINDOR"</p>
<p>Poppy tried to keep the rage from showing on her face. Bloody hat. How dare it.</p>
<p>Outwardly she sent a lazily grin to the Professor on her right who was looking a little teary eyed and a little bit like she, Poppy, was a miracle... The newly sorted first year beamed and waved, being accepted into the loudly cheering table. Poppy sat down next to Harry Potter and smiled at him happily.</p>
<p>"Hey, Poppy Stark. And you?" She asked, pretending she and everyone in this Hall didn't know.</p>
<p>The boy looked pleasantly surprised and a little awkward sitting there, "Harry. Harry Potter" He said quickly with a grim smile.</p>
<p>She nodded happily, "Lovely to meet you Harry, Harry Potter. Is it just me that finds the goo-goo eyes and obsessive looks in our direction ridiculously creepy?" She raised her voice at the end and pointedly started at a few people further down the table. The girls blushed and looked away while whispering to each other.</p>
<p>The boy looked surprised, perhaps by her bluntness but smiled genuinely, "You have no idea. People actually bowed to me in Diagon Alley" He confessed quietly but with a little relief.</p>
<p>Poppy threw her head back and laughed, "bowed? Like what you were a prince or dictator" She guffawed incredulously. As her papa used to say, '<em>never be surprised by the idiocy of the masses</em>'.</p>
<p>She donned a star gazed look and gasped, "My deepest apologies, Prince Harry. How shameful of me not to worship myself at your feet? I am so embarrassed, grand emperor. Would you like to me hand feed you? Kiss your hand? Anything to make up for my slight upon your honour, your majesty" She gushed.</p>
<p>Harry himself, was chuckling and nodding with wide eyes as if to say, 'that's exactly how people are acting. Crazy isn't it?'</p>
<p>At that moment, someone decided to but into the conversation from across the table.</p>
<p>"No way. I can't believe it. Your really <em>Harry Potter.</em> Did you really survive the killing curse? Can I see your scar?" The boy gushed, he must have been a third year perhaps but clearly had more bravery than the people around him who were all staring avidly at the fringe of Harry's hair.</p>
<p>It made her feel sick.</p>
<p>Harry seemed to duck his head and look uncomfortable again. She hated idiots.</p>
<p>"Are you actually kidding me? Who do you think you are? How rude can a person get" She demanded with a frown.</p>
<p>The boy with sandy hair, looked surprised then scoffed at her, "Rude? Your the one hogging <em>Harry Potter</em> to yourself"</p>
<p>Poppy started directly into the boys eyes with a look of intense dislike, "Hogging him? He isn't a toy, he's a human being. I am not hogging him and actually, I was referring to you asking him to <em>recount the night his parents were murdered. </em>What is wrong with you? Can I see <em>your</em> scars? Has anyone ever tried to murder you? Or permanently scarred your body? Would you like to tell the whole bloody story to the Great Hall? Maybe it's rude and <em>disgustingly </em>shameful to ask someone to recount the night again, <em>their parents were murdered" </em>Poppy did not shout at the end but almost hissed the words. Her temper did not burst and was not fiery but was ice cold burning that crept through her veins like blood. The boy paled, muttered an apology and ran away from her.</p>
<p>This was the house of the brave?</p>
<p>Poppy scoffed and then continued listening to the last few people getting sorted. A red head boy just came to sit next to her, a few other redheads clapped him on the back in congratulations.</p>
<p>She felt a tap on her shoulder and looked at the boy on her left.</p>
<p>He looked serious but kind of startled, "Um thanks for that... people don't really put two and two together and how hard for me to talk about it..." He said very quietly, eyes cast down.</p>
<p>Poppy sighed, "don't worry about it. I know how much it sucks. I'm an orphan too and my 'parents' weren't killed. They just didn't want me. So I know how it feels to be alone and how insensitive people can be. I always get asked <em>why </em>my parents didn't want me. Didn't <em>all </em>parents love their children? Why not me?" She confessed and made it sound non-nonchalant but the boys head shot up and they made eye contact for the first time.</p>
<p>Poppy blinked in surprised, "Hey, we have <em>exactly </em>the same eye colour-" She began but was interrupted by the voice of the Headmaster.</p>
<p>The great and powerful Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Poppy took the man in and didn't for a second believe his genteel manner. He was more powerful than he let on. She gulped. The robes were ridiculously bright and he looked frailer than he actually was with that beard. She looked curiously for his wand, wondering where he might be hiding it and if he would be demonstrating any magic for them. Probably not. But it would be interesting to see.</p>
<p>She ignored the welcoming speech and silly words of the Wizard before food suddenly appeared before them. A few people oohed and ahhed at this but she ignored it and began eating calmly.</p>
<p>Her mind drifted to the course work and wondered how difficult it would be. She probably already covered most of it with her papa. Yay for his disregard for laws and regulations and obsession with training her. But that left her utterly bored. Though she could be the best and drive ahead, what good would it do her really? It would draw attention to herself. Then uncomfortable questions would be asked.</p>
<p>Yes, she would get praise and attention but Poppy quickly learned that did not equate to acceptance and love. No, it meant expectations and responsibility. She was tired of that. That was her life with her papa and she ran away for something different. True love, acceptance and family. Like before with her uncle. That's what she wanted.</p>
<p>Poppy ate silently as she pondered her revelation. That's why she was put into this House, her previous ambition and hard work didn't motivate her anymore. What good was being great when you were alone? Her papa said love was a weakness well who cared? She would rather be weak and happy than strong and alone.</p>
<p>Poppy decided to be honest with herself. The last few years of her life were hard, full of pain and work. So much work. She worked to be better, the best. In the end, she worked so hard to finally be accepted and loved but she realised that would never happen. Love and acceptance were unconditional. What did she want now?</p>
<p>...To be happy.</p>
<p>That's it really. Happiness. She enjoyed studying and reading but the strenuous schedule really sucked the fun out of learning. Deep down, deep deep down in a place she would never admit to under veritaserum all she truly longed for in life was a family. But her biological donors didn't want her.</p>
<p>The depressive thoughts swirled around her and absorbed her attention so completely she didn't even notice the redheaded boy on her right stealing glances to the bespectacled boy on her left and said boy on her left looking increasingly despondent and uncomfortable with stares.</p>
<p>Suddenly Poppy snapped out of it, so what if her 'family' didn't love her? She had a wonderful loving uncle for <em>years</em> until he died which was more than most. How dare she be so upset and put his memory to vain. She would find a <em>new</em> family. She was an adult now, in <em>school</em>. She didn't have a guardian or anyone to protect her. She was on her own, who cared if she wasn't loved? She would love herself twice as much! She would be herself and be bloody happy that way. She could finally have friends and build a life around her full of fun, happiness and love.</p>
<p>With a new found determination that she lacked since running away, Poppy turned to her left and inwardly decided Harry Potter would be her new family. He didn't have parents either and looked lonely too. Not to mention he looked as depressed as she was a moment ago.</p>
<p>Poppy turned with a bright smile, used all of her charm and friendliness on the boy beside her. He smiled and gasped and chuckled at her antics and Poppy knew she had scored a winner. A friend. He <em>would</em> be. Harry looked like he needed acceptance as much as she.</p>
<p>Poppy let the boy on her right - desperate to talk to the boy on her left - into the conversation. She joked and used her people skills to lessen the awkwardness and tension and soon everyone was happy.</p>
<p>Though one thing started to bother her as the night wore on. Poppy thought the stares from the staff table were towards the boy on her left. It would make sense, Harry was a celebrity but it soon became obvious they were on her. Suspicious and panicky Poppy did not let it show despite her increasing levels of anxiety. Did they know about her past? Were they suspicious?</p>
<p>Poppy ignored to looks and continued on happily with her new friends, despite the creeping level of foreboding clutching at her heart. Something wasn't right and she had a feeling there would be a problem sooner rather than later.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The feast was a success. Poppy really hit it off with the redhead; Ron Weasley his name was and her future friend Harry. Poppy was excited with how quickly her plan was working. Of course, it would take years and tough times to formulate a friendship that was strong enough to be considered family but she was hopeful. Ron, although apparently had a huge family, they were all kind and welcoming it seemed. Well known pureblood family, the Weasleys. Secretly, she preferred Harry. Poppy may be biased but she <em>swore</em> she had an instant connection with him. As soon as she spoke to him it just felt <em>right. </em>Like they were supposed to be together. A team.</p>
<p>But then Harry made her feel less alone and alienated. Poppy noticed the people around her were just so... immature and <em>young. </em>The naivety, from even older kids was astounding to her. Her uncle was a firm believer in, 'knowledge is power. Naivety puts you at a disadvantage' and if that was his view, her papas with ten thousand that. He taught her so much and it was evident she just had more... <em>life experience</em> than these kids.</p>
<p>They didn't know what it was like to feel ashamed of yourself, to strive so hard for acceptance and recognition only to realise that you couldn't <em>earn </em>it. They didn't know what it was like to not sleep at night because your muscles burned and wounds screamed in protest from laying on them. They didn't know about nightmares, terror, pain, controlling emotions, manipulating others and strict self-discipline. That was clear. She was different.</p>
<p>These depressive thoughts swirled until she took a quiet deep breath to concentrate her thoughts. Her recent readings on muggle mediations and of course occulemcy were extremely helpful dealing with the stress and chaotic thoughts after running away. Poppy laughed and made a funny comment about the story from the boy on her right and the rest of the table laughed. Not once did her mask slip.</p>
<p>Not once did her mask slip.</p>
<p><em>Positive thoughts, positive thoughts, positive thoughts... </em>Well, honestly she wasn't completely different from everybody around. The closest Poppy could relate was to the boy on her left. Harry. He seemed subdued and knew how lucky he was to be there. The rest of the table seemed almost entitled as if they deserved to be there but he did not. He did nothing to keep the happy, elated and almost at peace look on his face. He didn't have a mask. None of these children did.</p>
<p>Another chubby boy who claimed himself to be near squib and the <em>funny – </em>abusive – ways in which his 'family' tried to 'get the magic out of him'. She related to a little. He yearned for acceptance, to be a good wizard, so did she at one point. Unfortunately, this was a lesson she couldn't tell him. Eventually he would learn to accept himself.</p>
<p>Then there was a bushy haired girl sat on the periphery of the conversation, occasionally looking in and making a comment or two. Although these comments were rude you could see her genuine desire to fit in and have friends. Poppy didn't know about her. She was intelligent, yes but it depended if deep down, after all of her annoying, self-righteous and superior attitude, she was a good person. Poppy would wait.</p>
<p>The feast ended and the Hall was to be led to their common rooms by prefects. <em>Thank Merlin,</em> Poppy thought. She could see being sociable, bold and funny was <em>very </em>important in this House and acted accordingly, not that it was difficult – honestly quite fun – but she was still exhausted from the interaction. Being around people was truthfully exhausting at the moment and she just wanted to apply ointment to her back wounds, meditate to clear her mind before bed and catch a decent four hours. That sounded heavenly.</p>
<p>Although it seemed her hopes were for nought as the strict woman who placed the hat on her head – her Head of House – approached her.</p>
<p>"Miss... Stark. If you would please accompany me to the headmaster's office for a few short moments. I shall escort you to your common room afterwards" she explained with a less stern look to her than usual.</p>
<p>Poppy traded a confused look with the boys and looked back to the Professor blinking, "I <em>can't </em>be in trouble already" She gasped, looking comically horrified.</p>
<p>A few people chuckled and sniggered at her antics, particularly a set of twins. The professors genial look disappeared and were replaced with a sterner and reprimanding expression.</p>
<p>"Follow me, Miss Stark" She commanded primly.</p>
<p>Poppy nodded and followed the Professor, waving to the boys who were now making their way out of the Great Hall. Poppy walked with a skip in her step and smile but deep down was thinking back to when the Professor first addressed her, <em>'Miss... Stark</em>'.</p>
<p>She knew something about her biological parents. The Professor knew something. <em>She knew something. She knew something. She knew something.</em></p>
<p>This was her internal mantra as she smiled and asked dumb questions that Poppy already knew from <em>Hogwarts, a history </em>and smiled every time the professor pointed out errors. Teeny, tiny errors but still, it said a lot. Also asking general questions about the curriculum and wanted to moan in complete horror at the... <em>easiness </em>of it. But then again, she knew everyone had to start at the beginning, of course, they did. They would reach more advanced things later on in the year.</p>
<p>They reached a gargoyle and the Professor gave the name of a sweet and stairs appeared. She was not surprised but made a mental note about Albus Dumbledore, 'he was silly. Probably did this to be more approachable to students'. It was amusing but cunning.</p>
<p>Poppy hummed a muggle song and rocked back and forth on her toes.</p>
<p>Walking into the office, Poppy was very strict in keeping her body language and face from giving anything away. She continued humming and looked curiously around but not in a suspicious manner but merely as a child, looking a little intimidated with a dash of wonder.</p>
<p>Secretly, she was rather annoyed by the act she had to play. She ran away to get rid of this and be herself but reasoned after she settled in then she would let it go.</p>
<p>Poppy continued looking around as the Transfiguration Professor moved up behind the desk to a chair seated conveniently beside the Headmasters desk. She was not the only one. A man with a hooked nose, greasy hair was glaring at her in condemnation. He was sat at the staffs table during the feast. Poppy could tell despite the proper manner of the Transfiguration Professor, she was sympathetic and slightly protective of her. Poppy was excellent at discovering others motives. Perhaps it was being in her House? Or something to do with her biological donors? Whatever motivated the slight protective instincts of the woman were clearly also motivating the man beside her to a completely different outcome.</p>
<p>Poppy did not make eye contact with Professor Dumbledore though she could feel his gaze on her. It was foolish to believe he wasn't a Legimens. Heart beating erratically and sweat dripping down her back, burning her wounds, were signs she desperately tried to hide. Poppy prayed to every deity that she knew that Dumbledore wasn't a suspicious or naturally unforgiving man.</p>
<p>Either way, she would tread carefully.</p>
<p>Poppy bounced, pretending to be anxious in a childish way and not a, 'actually guilty' and hiding secrets way. Yes, it was an awkward thing to try and achieve.</p>
<p>"I'm not in trouble already am I?" She spoke nervously, true worry seeping into her voice.</p>
<p>Poppy looked at the Headmaster but avoided direct eye contact. The man smiled gently and welcomingly at her when a musical whistle and gust of warm air swirled around the office, caressing her face.</p>
<p>The girl tried not to outwardly show her annoyance or panic at the realisation, a <em>Phoenix </em>was in the room! Merlin's Beard, why in the name of all that is holy is a Phoenix in the room with them?!</p>
<p>Poppy's eyes darted to the side of the room where a perch that one might have for an owl was mounted beside the desk. It was much larger of course and much fancier. She made direct eye contact with the Phoenix and sent out slight waves of magical energy. Dark swirling eyes, suspicious and dangerous eyes locked with hers.</p>
<p>Poppy had come across a Phoenix before. After she first managed animangi transformation, one found her and at first, she was relieved as it acted as sort of a guide but Poppy quickly found out one thing. A fellow light creature or not did not make them innocent. The creature was curious and treated her more like a novelty. It tried to protect her, yes, but within this it also tried to control her. Poppy didn't know anything about her animangi form before she first changed and there still wasnt much information out there. But she did know it wasn't normal that she retained some magical abilities and two stripes of white hair as a consequence but there wasn't anything to be done about it. She was also a magical <em>creature </em>and not an animal.</p>
<p>Part of her felt bad as they weren't truly malicious but Pheonix's were really too intelligent for their own good. She was done being controlled and the presence of one here within the Headmasters office was certainly not a good sign.</p>
<p>Poppy let out tiny wave of invisible light magic as a warning - courtesy of her animagus form - and the Phoenix shook his head and immediately flattened his wings. The creature bowed it's head in respect to her but she simply stared back blankly, deciding not to fall for its charms.</p>
<p>The bird ruffled it's magnificent feathers and let out a soft welcoming call as if to show a child to show not to be afraid but Poppy did not move her stance of an intense blank stare. The bird dropped his head in sorrow but eyes also took her in greedily.</p>
<p>She had found out that these creatures were <em>extremely </em>curious and this one must be infinitely so about her. Was she was a witch or magical creature? Who knew anymore.</p>
<p>The bird swayed it's head elegantly and was gone in a flurry of flames only to appear by the Headmasters side. Poppy's eyes followed this progress unblinkingly and did not miss the very same extremely curious blue gaze now on the Headmaster as he idly began stroking the bird absent-mindedly.</p>
<p>Poppy tried to keep her expression blank but did not like this development at all. The Phoenix had bound itself to Albus Dumbledore. She could feel the faint pulses of it in the air. This was not good. In some ways, her papa would be jealous but mostly scoff at the foolishness of such a thing. Witches and Wizards believed that being bound to a Phoenix was a bit like having an owl. It was not. These were near eternal light creatures that have possessed and had control over magic longer than the oldest pureblood family line. If you were bound to a Phoenix it was more like <em>you </em>were it's pet, under it's protection and scrutiny. It was much like a partnership in many ways but this proud and independently minded creature would bow to no one.</p>
<p>The fact that this Phoenix was bound to the Headmaster told Poppy a lot about his character. Then again, if he was bound to a Phoenix then the things this said about him may be even worse for her...</p>
<p>"Very curious, he has never reacted this way to anyone before. I do so apologise if he startled you Miss Stark" Dumbledore spoke in a curious but not yet suspicious manner. Either way, Poppy knew he would not stop until he found an answer and was most likely creating several theories already.</p>
<p>Poppy nodded her head shortly but kept her face stony, eyes drifting impassively from the creature to the Headmaster. She was uncomfortable and her act was slipping but for the life of her she couldn't keep up her ruse at the moment. Her spine was military stiff, hands folded behind her back and she could tell if she didn't stop this soon the curiosity and confusion would mount to suspicion, as it was starting to do.</p>
<p>The young girl closed her eyes and took a deep breath, <em>'your only a child. Use this to your advantage'</em></p>
<p>When she opened them again, she allowed the wariness, slight fear to enter her green eyes. She deliberately made eye contact with every adult in the room to make this known. Fortunately, they all seemed somewhat intuitive and all saw what she was trying to convey. The Transfiguration Professor's own eyes softened, the Headmaster shifted his face into something more comforting and the greasy haired man... well he stared deeply into her eyes then darted his own dark eyes away very quickly as if scalded. That was an interesting development, the man had seemed gruff and antagonistic until this point.</p>
<p>Poppy took a steadying breath and took the seat across from the desk and ignored her wave of irritation at being at some a... <em>subservient </em>position to anyone. '<em>no, that's just papa talking. Your not like that'.</em></p>
<p>Try as she might, his disrespect for authority was ingrained into every part of her.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, sir... I don't really like Phoenix's" She said quietly but honestly. She let this show in her voice.</p>
<p>The first year kept her head down but could almost feel the confusion and curiosity in the room rise.</p>
<p>"You have met a Pheonix before?" The headmaster asked curiously.</p>
<p>Poppy nodded her head jerkily, "Yes and I don't really want to talk about it" Her voice was tight and uncomfortable which was not faked. She was extremely uncomfortable and let everyone in the room know this through her body language.</p>
<p>She kept her gaze firmly on the floor.</p>
<p>"I see. Forgive me my dear for my curiosity, it is just very rare for a Phoenix to reveal themselves to anyone" He said genially.</p>
<p>Poppy jerked her head a little and sighed, finally looking up. She made eye contact and was pleasantly surprised he did not try to penetrate her mind.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it was... a special circumstance I guess. And your probably wondering why I don't seem to like them much. It's nothing too bad I suppose I just find them stupidly noble and too nosey for their own good" Poppy huffed and crossed her arms across her chest and shot a look at the creature that cawed in indignation at her assessment.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore chuckled kindly, "I understand my dear but I can assure you that Fawkes will not harm you. I believe he is just being, as you said, <em>'too nosey for his own good' </em>when it comes to you" The man appeared amused by the entire situation but blue gaze also swirling and extremely curious.</p>
<p>Poppy nodded her head quickly then sighed, "Is there a reason that I'm here sir? Not to be rude but I am quite tired"</p>
<p>The old man's face lost his deeply curious look and became much softer and more hesitant. It appeared he wasn't certain how to begin the conversation. Poppy had a good idea it was about her past but kept quiet waiting for the Headmaster to take the lead.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore continued to stroke Fawkes as the bird stared deeply at her but seemed to put his musings on the backburner before he spoke, "Please excuse our questioning but we were hoping that you would answer some rather personal questions if you don't mind, Miss Stark"</p>
<p>Poppy was not surprised and nodded jerkily, like a child would and smiled a little, "Okay, sir" She replied, feeling rather uncomfortable as she had only ever addressed her papa as 'sir' before.</p>
<p>"You see when a magical child in born in Britain or to British parents then they are automatically registered on the reserved list for Hogwarts students. This isn't something I, or any board members have any control over. So I was a little surprised that your initial letter did not state a surname and in your acceptance letter you had to provide one for us. Do you have any idea why this is?" He asked her, continuing to watch her, peering down through his glasses. His interest was more than Headmaster duties. This was not good for her.</p>
<p>Poppy tried not to frown. The old man gave her little snippets of information to distract her then asked a very broad question in order to probe for information. It would be rude to ask outright her background but he done it in a very subtle way. Sly old bugger.</p>
<p>Poppy nodded her head, "No I don't but I can wager a fairly good guess" She replied calmly, watching as the two other Professors in the room looked more interested and paid close attention to her.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore nodded in a way that said, 'continue' so she did, "I don't technically have a surname. I was dropped off at an orphanage when I was around one so that's probably why I don't have a name in the letter. I go by Stark now but I suppose it isn't my <em>legal </em>surname" Poppy shrugged. She left out that she was adopted by her Uncle almost immediately and that her legal surname was his surname, of course. If she also implied she still lived inside an Orphanage, well it isn't her fault that they assumed things.</p>
<p>The Professor's looked between themselves before the old man shot a warning look to the Transfiguration Professor. The woman frowned, looking silently furious with thinned lips as if she was trying to contain herself. McGonagall looked away. The greasy haired man looked on impassively, none too bothered by the exchange and simply watching her with dark eyes. Something about this man made her curious and suspicious, she decided to do a background check on the Professor. Apparently, the three of them had a disagreement of sorts and her Head of House does not look pleased with the development.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore looked back to her and smiled calmly, "I see. We were just checking because for our records we must we aware of the guardians of our students, in the event of an emergency" He said to her. <em>'Dragon dung' </em>she thought internally but nodded dutifully.</p>
<p>"What is the name of the orphanage you live in?" He asked. Poppy had some sort of a revelation. The man was looking for holes or an explanation. He knew something about her past... Albus Dumbledore knew something didn't add up. It would make sense. The man had been a Professor here for almost one hundred years. The older woman must have been teaching for quite a while as well. They knew something about her being abandoned as a child and the identity of her donors. Perhaps she resembled them in some way.</p>
<p>Poppy had a choice here and the decision she made then was something she would come to regret years down the line when she was blind-sighted with the truth. Her uncle warned her ignorance was dangerous. Her papa told her that knowledge was power and without it you were weak. She should have listened to them.</p>
<p>She decided not to inquire about her biological donors. The young girl didn't think she could handle it, to be truthful. She was emotionally fragile as it was, she didn't need anymore baggage. She didn't care who these people were that didn't want her. No she didn't.</p>
<p>"Well I was dropped off at St James' Orphanage in Scotland in 1981 but I was adopted very soon after. Unfortunately it didn't stick and I was sent back into care but because I had moved down to London with that family, I went to Wools Orphanage instead" Poppy was fortunate she had background knowledge on this. Her almost year in different care homes and Orphanages before her papa took her in after her uncle died was something she would never likely forget.</p>
<p>Curiously Albus Dumbledore's blue eyes flashed with something dangerous at the mention of the despicable place they dare to keep children but it was gone so fast she wasn't sure it was even there in the first place. He evidently didn't have a good opinion of the place. He must know of it well. Good.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore paused noticeably at the revelation and then nodded before asking, "I see. Your letter was addressed to a small inn in Rothenburg, Germany. Forgive me for being so curious, my dear" He asked while watching her still.</p>
<p>The old man was sharp as she expected. Truthfully she had hoped not to garner enough attention yet but it seems like luck was not on her side. The wizard didn't have cause to be suspicious of her yet and hopefully was softer on children.</p>
<p>Poppy just smiled a childish grin before nodding her head swiftly, "Yeah, it was <em>great! </em>Because I'm still quite young I get fostered out a lot and the Marshall family was so great they took us on a holiday. Me and three other kids, it was great. Ben moaned that it wasn't a sun holiday but we were right next to the forest and it had <em>unicorns </em>in it. Sarah didn't believe me but she's muggle and I gave them all a big fright when an owl swooped in and dropped off the letter" Poppy giggled at the fabricated story.</p>
<p>The adults seemed to believe her, after all, why would she make this up? Would they believe the truth that she had just run away from her papa and was travelling around to hide from him in different inns and hunting in the wilds in her animagus form before the letter arrived? No, probably not.</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded again, still curious but it seemed to have been sated for the moment.</p>
<p>Poppy yawned then and McGonagall stood and spoke tersely, "I see, well I believe that's all we needed to know, Miss Stark. I will show you the way to your common room and dormitories. You will need to get a good rest tonight for classes tomorrow"</p>
<p>Poppy nodded and waved tiredly to the other men in the room that watched her leave and she knew that she would be the topic of conversation as she left. The greasy haired man did not look pleased but was still impassive as she shuffled out the room with the Transfiguration Professor looming beside her.</p>
<p>The Professor beside her was silent and provided her with the password to the common room which was lovely and showed her her new room which she shared with three other girls. That was bothersome but not too problematic.</p>
<p>Poppy nodded sleepily as the Professor left her. The other girls curtains were drawn and were all hopefully deep in slumber for she had a lot to get done tonight.</p>
<p>Poppy pulled her curtains for privacy before shifting silently into her animagus form. Her paws sunk uncomfortably in the mattress and she watched the room through her new advanced vision. Seeing through the bits of fabric covering the beds she noted that her roommates were asleep.</p>
<p>Poppy used her abilities to turn herself invisible before creeping silently through the room to the wall facing the grounds. Closing her eyes and calling her magic she shifted into a wispy, light creature version of the flesh and blood animal she was before. She tried not to glow so brightly before she slipped through the wall and flew through the night, racing off into the dark.</p>
<p>She had business to attend to.</p>
