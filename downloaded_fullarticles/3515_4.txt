<p>Parental Woes</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“However did Molly manage?”</p>
<p>Harry slowly rolled his head to look at Severus. He looked as exhausted as Harry felt. “Well, in her defence, she was younger.” </p>
<p>Severus snorted. “Not by much.” </p>
<p>“She had no choice.”</p>
<p>“That excuse only works for the first child. What about the other six? And she had <i>twins</i>!”</p>
<p>Harry sighed. “I’ll ask if she’ll babysit Teddy next time, but since Andromeda asked us—”</p>
<p>“Indeed.” Severus went quiet for so long, Harry wondered if fatigue had made him drift off. “Still, it is good practice.” </p>
<p>Harry froze. “For?” </p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you?” Severus hummed. “We’re expecting.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“A baby?” wheezed Harry. “We’re having a baby?” </p>
<p>“No, we’re having a Kneazle.” Severus snorted. “Yes, a baby! Magic can accomplish many things, but it—Oof!”</p>
<p>“We’re having a baby,” whispered Harry several minutes later once he’d stopped peppering Severus’ face with kisses. “Bloody hell! I’m a dad!” </p>
<p>“You certainly recovered from your fatigue quickly,” murmured Severus, smiling. </p>
<p>Harry shook his head. “Oh no, I’m still exhausted, but news like that deserves a celebration.” </p>
<p>Severus slid his palms over Harry’s thighs, which were straddling him. “Not too much celebrating. That’s what got us into this situation in the first place.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“You’re having a remarkably easy pregnancy,” said Healer Brown, lowering her wand. “Everything’s going splendidly. No nausea?” </p>
<p>“No,” said Severus, hands cradling his swollen belly. “Just occasional fatigue and odd food cravings.”</p>
<p>“He tires easily,” said Harry, hovering anxiously beside Severus. “Is that normal?” </p>
<p>Healer Brown raised an eyebrow. “You try growing another human inside you and see if you’re not fatigued at times.” </p>
<p>Harry blinked. “I’m told it’s going to be my turn next.” </p>
<p>Brown smiled. “Well then, it looks like you’ll get to see for yourself soon enough. Now, off with you! I need to see sick people.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“That was…amazing,” whispered Harry, sitting on the bed. “<i>You’re</i> amazing.” </p>
<p>Severus, holding their son in his arms, yawned. </p>
<p>“Fatigued? I can hold him for a while.” </p>
<p>Nodding, Severus handed him over, and Harry stared down into his son’s dark eyes. “How about James Albus?” </p>
<p>Severus snorted. “That’s just asking for trouble.” </p>
<p>Harry laughed. “Fair point. All right. Sirius Albus?” </p>
<p>“That’s even worse!” </p>
<p>“James Tobias.” </p>
<p>“Ugh!” </p>
<p>“Harry Severus the second?” </p>
<p>“Merlin, no!” </p>
<p>“I was joking.” </p>
<p>“I should hope so.” Severus’ eyes drifted closed. </p>
<p>Once he was asleep, Harry kissed his forehead and whispered, “Sleep, love. You’ve done good.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“And to believe I thought I was fatigued before,” lamented Severus. </p>
<p>Harry, leaning against the wall, watched Liam Elliot chasing Teddy. “Sorry, what? I think I’m in a waking dream.” </p>
<p>Severus pinched him hard. “Does that feel dreamlike?” </p>
<p>“Ow!” Harry rubbed his arm. “That wasn’t a nice thing to do to the father of your child.” </p>
<p>“Until you bear one yourself, you’ve no grounds to complain.” </p>
<p>“I guess that means I can start complaining, then.” </p>
<p>Severus froze. “You mean—?”</p>
<p>Harry grinned. “Brown confirmed it today.” </p>
<p>Severus whooped, hugging him. Then, he sighed. “We’re never sleeping again, are we?” </p>
<p>“Apparently not.”</p>
