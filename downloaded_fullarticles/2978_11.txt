    <p>It came as a shock to find that the mangled body in fact still held life within it. It took quite a few Healers, and then some, to attempt to put the broken pieces back together. One Healer had quietly suggested that perhaps it was kinder to let the poor soul finally rest. But Harry was adamant. He’d lost so many people, friends, his only family. He couldn’t bare to lose another, not when there was the barest, slimmest chance that the man could still be saved.</p>
<p>Harry fought tooth and nail, using his newfound leverage as the “saviour of the wizarding world” to do everything in his power to bring the tattered spy back to the land of the living.</p>
<p>He didn’t once pause to consider that maybe the Healer had been right, because that would mean it was all his fault that one more life was lost.</p>
<p>He even managed to clear his name, so that once the man awoke he wouldn’t be immediately carted off to Azkaban.</p>
<p>And wake up he did, one unusually warm autumn day, a few months after the war had been won.</p>
<p>Harry wasn’t there when he opened his eyes, being too wrapped up in Auror training, but the minute Harry heard, he immediately dropped everything and Apparated to St. Mungo’s.</p>
<p>He excitedly entered the room, filled to the brim with a heady sense of accomplishment that he had done the impossible, and saved the life of Severus Snape. Finally Harry felt as if he was paying back Snape for all the times the man had saved his.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~**********~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>It was quiet. Too quiet.</p>
<p>Severus Snape slowly opened his eyes. It was also extremely dark.</p>
<p>Too dark to make out shapes or forms in the pressing darkness around him.</p>
<p>He breathed in deeply through his nose. The cold, antiseptic air told him he was most probably in St. Mungo’s. How, he had no idea.</p>
<p>He had purposely left the healing potions he always kept in a deep pocket of his robes untouched. He had completed his mission, and had been more than happy to finally leave this cruel, hateful world behind.</p>
<p>Unless this was the afterlife, but somehow he just knew that it was not.</p>
<p>The ache in his neck was too strong, the smells too familiar, and the bone-deep fatigue too real.</p>
<p>Minuscule vibrations through the rather uncomfortable mattress alerted him to the presence of another human being in the room that seemed to be heading in his direction.</p>
<p>He sat up quickly, immediately regretting it when his stomach gave a rebellious lurch.</p>
<p>“Who’s there?!” he tried to shout, but no sound issued from his throat.</p>
<p>The vibrations stopped abruptly.</p>

<p></p><div class="post_body"><p>Severus ran his fingers over his smarting neck. There was a sizable scar there, and it wasn’t just the size of a huge snake bite. It spread out in thin ribbons, clambering up his jaw and even reaching down to his collar bone. He became aware of a rather jarring fact.</p>
<p>He had been rendered mute through his injury.</p>
<p>Something suddenly brushed his knuckles, and he started so badly he nearly toppled off the bed.</p>
<p>Another something grabbed his shoulder to steady him, and he realized it was a person touching him.</p>
<p>His heart rate sped up.</p>
<p>He had no idea if the war had been won, or if the Dark Lord had even been defeated. He hoped that was the case, but he didn’t trust anyone who tried to touch him in a pitch black room.</p>
<p>It then occurred to him that the person who had touched him had made absolutely no sound.</p>
<p>A terrible suspicion wormed its way into his thoughts.</p>
<p>What if the room wasn’t dark at all? Perhaps that pleasant warmth draping across his right shoulder was glaring sunlight.</p>
<p>The vibrations returned, and he became aware of a somehow oddly familiar presence coming to a stop on his right, blocking the warmth.</p>
<p>Someone took his hand, and this time he didn’t flinch away. His mind was still trying to process the increasingly obvious signs that Nagini had not only stolen his voice, but his eyes and ears as well.</p>
<p>The person holding his hand lifted it slowly to what felt like their forehead. Severus couldn’t imagine why, until he felt the shape of an all-too-familiar scar beneath his fingertips, and then the cool metal of those blasted round glasses.</p>
<p>The gesture confirmed beyond a doubt that his eyes and ears were functioning as well as his throat.</p>
<p>But with that painful realization also came a startling, though thankfully not as unpleasant knowledge.</p>
<p>Harry Potter, the unbearably lucky nuisance that he was, was somehow alive.</p>

      </p>
<p>The thought was so loud that it hurt. Or maybe that was because it was a very clumsy bit of accidental legilimency on his end.</p>
<p>But the truth was there now, in all its beautiful and agonizing glory.</p>
<p>His job was done, he had succeeded, he hadn’t failed Lily.</p>
<p>And yet, his chest felt so tight he could barely breathe.</p>
<p>He hadn’t meant to survive. <em>He didn’t want it</em>. Especially not this terrible, terrible dark silence that made him completely useless, if he hadn’t already been so.</p>
<p>He drew his hands up to his face, grasping at his shorn hair, his entire being suddenly flooded with an overwhelming sense of despair.</p>
<p>He barely noticed the tears dripping onto his lap.</p>
<p>He longed to be numb, to feel no pain, to simply cease existing.</p>
<p>It was such a simple wish, one he’d had since he was twenty, and still, still his miserable life persisted.</p>
<p>
        <em>I wish I were dead.</em>
