    <p>October is a fickle creature; it can be beautiful, a season of shift and a harbinger of change. It can bring unexpected warm days, and crisp, clear evenings. But October is also unpredictable, and not always lovely. Some years, it would rain for weeks, bringing grey, impenetrable clouds or early snow, the smell of wet leaves and decay.</p>
    <p>If October is fickle, October in the Highlands of Scotland is the most capricious of all. Some years, the first frost fell before even the hardest working farmers had found time to pull in the crops; the late summer barley would die, and frozen, brittle wheat stalks would snap in the wind. Those years, the sheep would huddle together on the hill, and even still, some would die. The wind would gust so violently and so cold that it could cut to the bone. There were no bonfires and no revelry; just grumbling through the rain to try and finish preparing before the snow fell in earnest. In those Octobers, the ground would freeze solid and take with it the roots of the perennial plants, and even the scrub brush looked cowed and bent, dead before the month was out.</p>
    <p>This was not one of those years.</p>
    <p>Oliver breathed deeply, taking in the smell of the wildflowers and the grass of the hills, the smell of the tarps that blew in the gentle wind. This was the sort of October where it would still be warm enough on All Hallow's to sit out and have a picnic, singing songs till the early morning and burning the last of the summer brush. The people would have parties and there would be so much fruit stored for the winter that the extra cider from the foul fruit would be plentiful.</p>
    <p>He forced himself forward, taking in the sight of the one place he had missed, the one thing that had always felt safe and perfect, no matter what else was going on.</p>
    <p>The Quidditch pitch at Hogwarts looked exactly the same, although he knew for a fact that it had been taken down and rebuilt at least three times since he had left school. All a part of the magic of the castle, he supposed, that it looked as ancient and noble as it always had; the golden hoops stood still in the wind, higher than he’d remembered. The turrets of the stands held the same striped flags, each house’s banner dotting the corners proudly. The short clip of the lawns was soft under his boots, grass which was never cut and yet always smelled like it had just been trimmed.</p>
    <p>It was beautiful.</p>
    <p>It was home.</p>
    <p>Oliver smiled to himself and set down his pack, unclipping his broom and laughing at himself. He was still half pretending that he was only here for the meeting; to appease an old mentor, to hear McGonagall out. Yet, he had all of his things packed into a trunk he’d left by the gates, and his broom was here, in its travelling case, clipped and well cared for. Ready.</p>
    <p>He held his hand over the sleek cherry wood and smiled down as it gracefully floated into his grasp. The team’s broom-maker had hated his decision, asking for the broom to be made from the light, strong wood. He had grumbled about ‘young fools’ and promised that Oliver would never be able to control it. Oliver had insisted, and had never once regretted it; he listened now for the gentle hum that he imagined he could hear from the broom when he was alone. He knew it sounded crazy, but he could always feel its magic beneath his palms, always knew that it would twist and spiral gently in his grip, until it was tuned to his own signature. The broom barely required his touch, as though it already knew what he wanted and where he was going. He mounted it, tucking his feet onto the brass rails and gripping gently.</p>
    <p>As they rose as one unit into the sky, Oliver let out a relaxed breath, one of contentment and ease.</p>
    <p>He whooped with joy as he got to full height, taking lazy, slow loops around the pitch, occasionally spiraling into a dive, threading himself through the hoops, revelling in the ability to fly without a goal or a purpose in the crisp air.</p>
    <p>October had always been made for Quidditch.</p>

    <p>Far below, unnoticed by Wood, Marcus Flint was admiring the same field. He was breathing in the same scents and experiencing the same resetting of all his emotions. He had felt so uneasy for the past year, and he knew now that he’d just missed <em>this</em>. He had been homesick without even knowing what home meant anymore. He held tightly to his broom, the old Clean Sleep that was trusty if not flashy, well-cared for and worth the extra effort. It may not be as fast as some of the newer styles, but it was never out of sync, never prone to hexing or fatigue. Marcus loved it like a child.</p>
    <p>He saw the dot of flight high above him and instinctively looked up. He knew, of course, who it was; there could be no mistaking the glide, the spins, the loops. There were few people who flew like that; flew as though they were made from wind and feathers, untroubled by gravity or laws of physics.</p>
    <p>He inhaled sharply. He’d known it was possible, likely even, that he’d find Oliver in his return. There had been hints in Minerva’s last three letters. But he didn’t expect to run into him here. <em>Alone</em>. Immediately.</p>
    <p>He felt foolish for not realising that <em>of course</em> this is where Oliver would come first, too. Of course he would fly before doing anything else. After all, that’s why he was here, wasn’t it?</p>
    <p>Marcus walked to the end of the pitch and pulled out a set of worn, beaten practise balls, releasing only the Quaffle and hoping against all hope that he would survive the next fifteen minutes.</p>

    <p>When a Quaffle flew past, Oliver instinctively knocked it away from the hoop with the end of his broom before looking around wildly, on guard and wary; this may be the school pitch, but a solo flier was rare and strange. The identity of the other person was obscured by the wild dive they had taken to grab the ball out of the air, and then by the desperate twists the player took before sending the ball toward him again. There were no hints in clothing; likely not a student, then, given the lack of school practice gear or house colours. Oliver saved the goal easily, dipping and turning three more times before the other player finally slowed close enough for recognition.</p>
    <p>“See you still use illegal feints. I figured the League would have cured you of that by now,” a voice called.</p>
    <p>Oliver didn’t reply. He looked toward the other player, the wind waffling through his ears, and without thinking, he sunk to the ground quickly, feeling his pulse shift beneath his skin. He felt the other broom land beside him, and he kicked off, dropping his own to the ground. His anger, flaring and flagellating him, felt foreign and unfamiliar; it was rusty, after all. He’d not had to deal with this particular emotion in a long time. When he turned, Marcus’ face told him everything he needed to know. Flint was terrified, and Oliver was not about to make him feel safer.</p>
    <p>“What are you doing here?” Oliver said, an icy deadliness to his voice that he hadn’t heard from himself in a long time.</p>
    <p>“I imagine the same thing that you are,” Marcus responded, taking a step to dismount his broom, standing still and looking at the ground.</p>
    <p><em>Wise,</em> Oliver thought. <em>No eye contact. Won’t save you, but wise.</em></p>
    <p>“That’s it? That’s going to be your opening line? A quip about my flying?” Oliver felt his fists tighten into balls, and his vision tunnelled.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what you want me to say,” Marcus replied, sounding both hardened and broken, all at once, as only a Slytherin can.</p>
    <p>Marcus Flint knew what he’d gotten himself into. He’d tried everything he could to just walk away when he had arrived to find Oliver flying peacefully in the cool October breeze, gently caressing the air around his broom, just as he always had. Even once he’d thrown the ball, Marcus had wished there was another way, a way to back down and run.</p>
    <p>The first punch was vicious, grabbing his jaw and throwing him off balance, largely because Marcus didn’t raise his fists to retaliate. Oliver, though light and wiry, had always had an effective right hook. The second swing caught him across the other cheek, and still, he left his hands at his sides despite Oliver’s angry shouts for him to fight back. The third blow hit his ribs, taking his breath away, though the accompanying scream is what really broke him open.</p>
    <p>When the fourth attack from Oliver collided with his left arm, Marcus reached out and pulled Oliver close, into an embrace that the Gryffindor fought with his entire body, the whole time growling and clawing and screaming. Marcus just held on, dealt with the pain of the scratches, until finally, slowly, Oliver collapsed into him, his screams turning wrung out sobs that destroyed Marcus’ ability to think straight.</p>
    <p>“You fucker. You absolute fucking...I can’t even...you left,” Oliver was sobbing, tearing at the back of Marcus’ jumper, his head buried deep in his shoulder. “You just left. No more letters. No explanation. And then you just turn up here, as though-”</p>
    <p>“Yes,” Marcus whispered, still clinging to the man that was trying desperately to get away from him. “Yes, Oliver.”</p>
    <p>When Marcus finally stepped back, stepping space between them where there had never been space before, he saw that Oliver’s resolve had returned.</p>
    <p>“Fuck you, Marcus Flint,” Oliver said quietly, no anger or spite left in his tone. The sentence cut to the quick as a result, and Marcus had to rub his hands across his face to watch the other man walk away.</p>
    <p>“Flint! Wood!” A familiar voice called from the edge of the pitch. “I thought I might find you two here. Come quickly. This is not the sort of conversation one has on a Quidditch pitch.”</p>
