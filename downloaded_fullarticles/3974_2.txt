    <p>A tall woman, probably around fifty years of age, stood in the ruins of what was once a house. In her arms, a baby.<br/>Not any baby, of course — this baby was Harry Potter, the one who would become known as the boy who lived. The only person who had ever survived the killing curse.<br/>“Minerva?”<br/>She turned around, black robes billowing around her, wand ready in case there was a threat.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore stood behind her. The headmaster of Hogwarts, Britain’s school of witchcraft and wizardry.<br/>“Thank you for coming, Albus.” She graced him with a small smile, then gestured to the sleeping boy swaddled in her arms. “He has nowhere to go, am I correct?”<br/>Albus nodded. “His only living relatives are muggles, and it’s not safe to leave him with them. I am well aware Remus would’ve taken him, but he and Sirius can’t really take care of a child his age, especially considering Remus’ little… problem.”</p>
<p>Minerva pondered his words for a second before making a decision.<br/>“I’ll be taking him. He’ll live at Hogwarts with me, although I expect him to receive his own chambers."<br/>“Of course. I’ll have the elves see to it immediately after our return.”<br/>The two professors apparated to the little village outside the large castle that acted as school grounds and slowly but surely made their way back to the school.</p>
<p>They hadn’t gotten far into the building when they ran into Severus Snape, the Potions professor with long black hair and one hell of an attitude. This attitude rarely saw the light of day again, though, because Harry awoke just then, opening his green eyes.<br/>“Could it be… Harry Potter? Is this Lily’s son?”<br/>Minerva gave a bittersweet smile and a nod. “He has nowhere else to go. I’m taking him in.”</p>
<p>Severus’ eyes widened. He leaned over the baby in Minerva’s arms, smiling at the little boy and cooing when he smiled back. Every professor and student around them stared in shock at the usually so stoic man showing any form of affection, but they quickly turned around, pretending they never saw anything, when the professor himself shot a death glare towards anyone who looked in their direction, effectively shutting down any whispering.<br/>“I’ll take him.”</p>
<p>Minerva just stared at him in shock, unable to utter a word. She looked over at Albus, but his face bore the same expression.<br/>“I suppose that’s fine… Make sure you give him a room in your chambers, then. Come get me if anything goes wrong."<br/>Minerva handed over the curious baby, who had been staring at the different patterns of the ceiling the whole time, to Severus.<br/>He knew he would come to regret this decision at some point. Probably really soon, actually. He was practically feeling the regret creep up behind him, ready to pounce. But, he promised himself he’d keep Lily’s son safe. It was the least he could do, after all.</p>
<p>And so, Harry’s life began. His family would come to look a little weird, but what’s there not to love about it?</p>
