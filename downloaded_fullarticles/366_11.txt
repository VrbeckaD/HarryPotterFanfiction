    <p>March, 1960<br/>Malfoy Manor</p>
<p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>A large chandelier glittered and refracted light from a crackling fire as it hung over a long, rectangular table. Three fourths of the table were completely empty. At one end, three people stood over a cradle. </p>
<p>“He is a handsome child,” a tall man with dark hair and piercing, soulless black eyes said. He stood over the child, examining him in a clinical manner.</p>
<p>“He – he is, my lord,” the second man in the group responded. He clutched the arm of the woman next to him. Her grey eyes were fixed on the Dark Lord with an intensity that warned him to stay away from her child. </p>
<p>“Calm yourself, Mrs. Black,” Lord Voldemort chuckled. “I shall not harm the child.”</p>
<p>“Yet,” she hissed under her breath. </p>
<p>The Dark Lord sneered. “I was led to believe that your participation in this…experiment…was consensual. After all, I highly doubt your husband would be able to complete a…spell…of this calibre.”</p>
<p>Slightly mollified, Walburga lifted the baby from the bassinet into her arms. Orion, standing next to her, was silent and stoic, tense against the threat of the monster in the room.</p>
<p>“May I?” The Dark Lord asked. He did not wait for a response, immediately running a hand over the infant, casting silent detection spells. Walburga refused to relax, as the Dark Lord had ordered, until the man had moved away from her firstborn, a fierce light in her eye. </p>
<p>“Hmm,” the Dark Wizard hummed contemplatively. “Yes, he will do nicely. He has power, but not enough to combat that of my ancestor. He will not let Slytherin’s magic go to waste.” He flicked his gaze over the infant’s mother, a formidable woman in her own right. “What is his name?” he asked. </p>
<p>“Sirius Orion Black,” she informed him, her hostile tone subdued by her own fear and her husband’s hand, holding her arm with an iron grip. </p>
<p>“Wonderful,” the Dark Lord breathed. “He is too young now, and we have no one whose blood is closely related enough to his. A brother, or sister I suppose, would be ideal.” He fixed his stare upon Orion, who straightened. “Once he is of age, his magic and body will be mature enough. You, my dear, will cast the curse. And then, the great Salazar Slytherin will once more be among us.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my Lord,” the parents murmured. The three stood there for a moment, then the Dark Lord held his hands out expectantly.</p>
<p>Walburga's grip on her son tightened, and a small, pitiful cry escaped him. "Walburga," Orion breathed, a tense edge to his voice. The couple exchanged a glance. Her jaw ticked, and she dared to look the Dark Lord in the eyes. He smiled, a vicious grin. </p>
<p>With shaking hands, Walburga passed off her only son to the Dark Lord. The man gazed at the infant with maniacal glee. Cradling the boy in his arms like a father, he easily slipped into Parseltongue. </p>
<p>“You will be a great host,” Lord Voldemort hissed, a cruel smile on his face. “We shall do great things, you and I.”</p>
