    <p><strong>May 1, 1998</strong><br/> Quick now, here, now, always-<br/> Ridiculous the sad waste of time<br/> Stretching before and after.</p>
<p><strong>May 1, 2012</strong><br/> Home is where one starts from. As we grow older<br/> the world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated<br/> Of dead and living.</p>
<p><strong>May 1, 1999</strong><br/> For our own past is covered by the currents of action,<br/> But the torment of others remains an experience<br/> Unqualified, unworn by subsequent attrition.<br/> People change, and smile: but the agony abides.</p>
<p><strong>May 1, 2013</strong><br/> If you came this way,<br/> Taking any route, starting from anywhere,<br/> At any time or at any season,<br/> It would always be the same: you would have to put off<br/> Sense and notion. You are not here to verify,<br/> Instruct yourself, or inform curiosity<br/> Or carry report. You are here to kneel<br/> Where prayer has been valid. And prayer is more<br/> Than an order of words, the conscious occupation<br/> Of the praying mind, or the sound of the voice praying.<br/> And what the dead had no speech for, when living,<br/> They can tell you, being dead: the communication<br/> Of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living.</p>

<p>“Hermione! There’s our birthday girl!”</p>
<p>I’m out of breath from running. My hair is coming loose and I can feel bits of it plastered to the sweat on my cheeks. I’ve probably got ink on my nose so I swipe my sleeve across it, hiding the temporary loss of a smile. I’m ecstatic to see them but also wary, defensive, because last time we were all together Ron and I had an enormous row. Ginny and Luna are already here, and Harry’s arm is round Ginny’s waist. Luna is sitting across from her, and then there’s an empty seat. Then Neville, smiling and clapping, shouting “Happy Birthday”. Ron’s gaze is fixed on the far wall, and he looks bored and irritated. Petulant. Harry’s drug him along. My stomach twists with the knowledge of how fragile, how circumstantial our friendship was. It couldn’t survive a dearth of war, couldn’t survive the rhythms of a regular life. The attraction is gone, fled the moment I realized that his version of Hermione and mine couldn’t coexist, but I still miss the friendship. I thought we were great friends, once.<br/> <br/> Harry reaches me, wraps me in a hug and pulls me up so that I’m dangling with my toes brushing the floor. I cling, starved for affection, and squeeze him tightly as he sets me down.<br/> <br/> “Missed you, Harry.”<br/> <br/> He looks a little pensive, but just for a moment, and then he carefully offers “You don’t have to stay here.”<br/> <br/> I shake my head. No, and no again. I do have to stay here, as I’ve said before. “Not again, please.”<br/> <br/> “All right. Let’s get you a butterbeer, yeah?”<br/> <br/> I sit between Luna and Neville. There’s an awkward exchange of pleasantries with Ron, during which Harry looks increasingly distressed, and so Ginny – as always – jumps in and saves the conversation by telling Neville all the things he’s missing at Hogwarts now that she’s Head Girl and Luna’s the Ravenclaw 7th-year prefect. I listen to this with half an ear, laughing at the appropriate moments, but if I’m honest I also feel a little left out. I wasn’t here last year. They have all these inside jokes, these stories that I don’t share. I love Hogwarts and I’m happy here, but somehow I’m no longer part of the social fabric. No one really treats me as a student, not even Ginny and Luna.<br/> <br/> The boys look smart in their red auror robes, and I’m a little surprised when I suddenly notice that somehow Neville has become handsome. Not just passable, but…terribly good-looking.<br/> I find my gaze flitting between him and Luna, wondering if something more than friendship will blossom there. That would be lovely.<br/> <br/> Which is no doubt exactly what everyone thinks about Ron and I. Wouldn’t it be lovely? I know it’s Harry’s fondest wish, and Harry’s is Ginny’s and Molly’s and Molly’s is Arthur’s. It’s an endless circle, and it really would be lovely if only it would account for the fact that Ron doesn’t like me very much.<br/> <br/> Ron is still staring into space as if he’s not here. I realize Harry’s noticed me looking at Ron, and I cringe as I feel his fingers tugging at my hand under the table. It’s too late to pretend it didn’t happen, so I look up and nod and then Harry and I extricate ourselves and head for the door. We fall into step beside each other, and we don’t really have a fixed destination but we wander together as we’ve always done.<br/> <br/> I can’t explain my love for Harry. I don’t have any brothers or sisters, so I don’t know if it’s really like that or not. I just know that it feels like we’ve always been friends, always been this close. I can remember a time when he wasn’t my companion, and those were lonely years; years where there were people, even kids who visited to play and went to the zoo with us and came to my birthday parties, but they weren’t really friends. I couldn’t talk to them.<br/> <br/> I don’t care what they say; we’re always going to be friends. Even if Ron and I can’t find our way back to friendship, Harry and I will always have this bond between us, one that goes as deep as family, all the way down to our bones. Marrow is thicker than blood.<br/> <br/> We come to the fence, and pause. Before us, up the hill, is the Shrieking Shack. I’ve just now noticed the direction we’ve headed and I stare up at the bare wood beams, the crazy tilted angle of the walls. The thing is going to implode one of these days, fall in on itself. Isn’t anyone tending to it?<br/> <br/> I feel Harry’s thumb rubbing the skin around my jaw, and he lets out a little hoarse chuckle. “You’ve got ink on your cheek, like old times. Isn’t anybody taking care of you?”<br/> <br/> I push his shoulder with my hands playfully, shoving him away. “As if I need a keeper!”<br/> <br/> “Keeper, seeker, I don’t care what position he plays. We need to find you a bloke.”<br/> <br/> I roll my eyes, but my smile ruins the effect. He’s trying to tell me it’s okay if I don’t bend myself into a twist in order to meet Ron’s needs, and it feels good to know that Harry can accept it, that he won’t hold it against me. “I don’t want a bloke, Harry. I just want to make a difference.”<br/> <br/> “Merlin, haven’t you already?” I hear disbelief in his voice, even wonder. It never crossed my mind that he doesn’t feel this also, this sense of the battle having just begun to take shape. There’s still so much to do, so much to learn, so many things that need to be fixed. It’s difficult to know where to begin. I feel like I’m flying without a broom, pulled on some invisible current. If I keep learning, opportunities will come. Already I’m learning to live with this sensation that things were broken – things which will be difficult or impossible to mend. Childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies, and in that sense my kingdom is ruined. Hogwarts is just a place to begin.<br/> <br/> Harry shifts beside me, mussing his hair. It’s a nervous gesture, so my senses sharpen. “Right, Hermione – “<br/> <br/> “Just spit it out.”<br/> <br/> He nods toward the shack, and I realize that he led me here deliberately, and I know what he’s about to say. “The Minister is having him declared deceased this week so that the Wizengamot –“<br/> <br/> “Damn it, Harry!” But it isn’t his fault. I know he wants to believe – maybe more than I do, because his is personal. Mine is just fury at the injustice of it all, dosed with regret for things I’ve done – in ignorance, but done all the same. I swing my leg over the fence and draw my wand, and I know that Harry is right behind me.<br/> <br/> “Kingsley’s tried to find him, you know that, but we’re at the point where he can’t put any more into it unless we’re calling it a manhunt. If he really is out there, do you think he’d rather be a criminal than a dead hero?”<br/> <br/> Harry can be really insensitive the way he says things, but I know what he’s trying to say. I understand it. It’s just –<br/> <br/> “He wasn’t dead when we left him, but until – “ Until I saw what death actually looked like, up close, when you touch skin that used to thrum with energy and find that it feels as if you’re touching stone, feels like something strange and inorganic, when you see the jaw distended and eyes like paper and the lips peeled and static...until Fred and Tonks and Professor Lupin…<br/> <br/> “If he wasn’t, he was close.” Harry says it with the authority of one who’s seen a lot more of death than I have, so I have to accept it as truth.<br/> <br/> Maybe. Maybe he was. By the time it occurred to me – this is death, and it’s not how Severus Snape looked, felt – and I’d crawled back through the tunnel, he was gone. Professor Snape – or his body, because there was blood everywhere and surely nobody could’ve survived that and fled under their power – had disappeared.<br/> <br/> Did I want him to be a fugitive or a blessed martyr? I don’t think he’d want either. All told, I’m pretty sure if he had a choice he’d want to be alive. And left alone.<br/> <br/> So does it really matter? I pull my wand, focus all the energy and emotion I’ve wasted on pressing Harry and The Minister and Minerva to search until they found him, and work it into a preservation spell so strong I’m pretty sure the Shrieking Shack will last almost as long as the castle. At least his resting place will – “Conservare In Memoria.”<br/> <br/> “Merlin’s Bloody Arse!”<br/> <br/> I drop my wand, aghast at what I’ve done. I’d meant to keep it from falling apart at the first Windmonath gust.<br/> <br/> “That’s…it’s…”<br/> <br/> It’s beautiful. The wood is dark, the windows warm and yellow instead of jagged and splintered. The house still tilts at odd angles, but now the planes all nest together. There’s some sort of dark red moss covering one side of the…it’s much more of a cottage than a shack now, so the name doesn’t fit…domicile…mausoleum…structure in front of us. It’s too edgy to be like the homes in Witch’s Weekly, but just as striking.<br/> <br/> I sigh. “Why do I feel like we always get it wrong? It’s one indignity after another, you know. I was trying to help but he’d hate this. You know he would.”<br/> <br/> Harry whistles. “It’s a really nice house. I can almost forget everything that happened here. Happy Birthday Us.”<br/> <br/> I laugh. It feels so good to laugh. Harry pulls me in, and I lay my head against his shoulder. The night isn’t so cold we can’t stand out here a while longer. Harry’s mourning right now, because even though he knows that it’s all arbitrary and political he still really seems to believe that once Kingsley Shacklebolt signs the Certificatorium Morte Professor Snape will die. Officially.<br/> <br/> That’s just how Harry thinks. My mind churns with possibilities, hundreds of them. Anything could have happened, really.<br/> <br/> “Rest in Peace, Sev,” he says gravely, and I have to bite my lip to keep from laughing again. He’s so earnest, trying so hard to honor Professor Snape in his mum’s place, but I’ve seen that vial of memories and I knew Professor Snape, and if he’s dead he’s rolling in his grave at Harry’s familiarity and presumption.</p>

<p>“It’s eleven o’clock, Granger. What are you doing here?”<br/> <br/> I hold up the bottle of Ogden’s, wave it in the air, then drop it back on the table. “Drinking, obviously. What are you doing?”<br/> <br/> He edges closer to me. “It’s my night.”<br/> <br/> “Ah.” I take another drink. Instead of leaving, he sits down across from me, transfigures a tumbler, and pours himself a finger. He holds it up, examining the flames.<br/> <br/> “This is swill. What are we drinking to?”<br/> <br/> “Thirty-fucking three, huzzah.” I’m drunk, probably – or I’m just so tired that it feels that way. “Sorry,” I clarify. “Sorry. Minerva’s health, of course.”<br/> <br/> “Slainte mhath,” he responds, and sips at the whisky. He’s on duty, whatever that means. Playing Headmaster for the night with no more authority than Umbridge wielded. “It’s your birthday?”<br/> <br/> I nod, hoping we can skim past it. But no, he looks at me with something like pity. “Have you had any sleep?”<br/> <br/> I nod to the stack of books on the table, to the tome that lies open in front of me. “I’m researching curses. I haven’t found anything yet.”<br/> <br/> “St. Mungo’s best are working on it.” He sounds dismissive, as if he doesn’t think that the Hogwarts librarian has any business dabbling in something the experts have already covered, and he’s probably right. I can’t just sit here any longer, though, while Minerva lies comatose in the infirmary and the castle attacks itself.<br/> <br/> Entire rooms have closed themselves off since Minerva collapsed. The healers have described it as a sort of occlumency; her brain is active, but she’s vegetative, unable to respond to stimuli.<br/> <br/> “I can’t just do nothing,” I say, swiping at my eyes with my fingers. I can’t imagine anything worse than crying in front of him. “I keep asking myself what Professor Snape would do if he were here, and –“<br/> <br/> “He’s dead, Granger. We’re the adults now. You’re thirty-three, too old not to take better care of yourself.”<br/> <br/> “Piss off, Malfoy,” I snap, but I’m laughing a little.<br/> <br/> He dumps the remainder of his drink in my glass and then transfigures his tumbler back into the signet ring it began as.<br/> <br/> “Happy birthday,” he whispers, and exits the library as quietly as he entered it.</p>

<p>“You haven’t eaten a thing,” I chide. The bowl is still full, and he hasn’t touched the spoon I left on the table or the teacup. I don’t know what to do; I don’t know why I thought this was a good idea.<br/> <br/> And yet I can’t help but think that I didn’t have a choice once I realized that it had already been done.<br/> <br/> I never bothered to ask how it worked; efficacy, not method, as always.<br/> <br/> It’s too late for second-guessing. I sit down on the bed. His body is stiff and rigid, but he won’t push me away. He doesn’t lash out, he curls inward. He retreats. And now he doesn’t eat, or drink. He’s starving himself.<br/> <br/> “Severus, please,” I beg, rubbing my hands together.<br/> <br/> I don’t try to touch him anymore. I wouldn’t have in the first place except that in those first feverish weeks he clung to me and I let him. Sometimes he called me Lily, or Poppy. Minerva. Mum. A few times, toward the end of that stage, he called me Granger, as if he almost understood. Since he came to his senses though, since I told him what I’ve done and why we’re here, he hasn’t spoken. His eyes are lucid, but cold.<br/> <br/> I made him my prisoner, my dependent, when all he wanted was freedom. There’s freedom in death. I realize that now that it’s too late. And I’m scared, so scared that this won’t end up the way I believed it would. I’m trying not to cry. It won’t make what I have to say any easier. It’s easier if I look at the wall, with its pink floral wallpaper, or the curtain fluttering in the breeze.<br/> <br/> “Right now, I’m standing with Harry outside the Shrieking Shack. He’s going to tell me that everyone’s given you up for dead.” I pause, and I glance pointedly at the teacup. “You seem determined this once to prove him right.”<br/> <br/> No trace of a smile. I didn’t expect one, but…perhaps I hoped. I swallow and look away again. “The choice wasn’t mine to make. It still isn’t, but…I needed your help. I did it because Dumbledore said…if I ever felt like we were going to fail…”<br/> <br/> It’s a lame excuse. It sounds lame when I say it. Dumbledore meant fail in defeating Voldemort, and we both know that. He didn’t mean if we had some problem we couldn’t solve on our own, no matter how minor, no matter how distant in the future. He isn’t responsible for any of it. “Forget I said that. I know I had no right to do this. I’m sorry. It doesn’t fix anything but I’m sorry.”<br/> <br/> He doesn’t move. His breathing is even and unlabored, his eyes shuttered and dark and gazing into the middle distance. He’s wearing a black jumper beneath the sheets, and probably track pants as well.<br/> <br/> I haven’t seen his skin beneath the clothing since he came to consciousness, and then it was pale and fragile and dry from the venom and antivenin and antibiotics and strengthening potions. He was already too thin and now he’s nothing more than skin and bones.<br/> <br/> I take a deep breath. He spent much more time preparing me to face the truth; I’m so unprepared. I rest my chin on my hands and sigh, expelling all of the air until I rasp. “That’s bollocks. We both know it. Severus – “<br/> <br/> There’s a slight rustle behind me. He’s moved; I don’t turn to see how much.<br/> <br/> “You asked me to do this. Just before I left.”<br/> <br/> I don’t extrapolate. From here on, it’s on him to come to his own conclusions, to ask the questions he needs to ask. He’d do – has done – the same for me.<br/> <br/> After a long moment, the bed begins to shake. Fucking hell; I’ve made him cry. I don’t look back at him as I push myself off the mattress and walk out of the room. He’s got no dignity left; I do my best to spare what shreds I can.</p>
<p>
  <strong>September 19, 2012</strong>
</p>
<p>The cat is on my feet, the house is quiet, and the wine is good. I’m in bed with a book and a slice of cake. It’s chocolate ganache with a marzipan layer – heaven on earth.<br/> <br/> This is heaven. I don’t want to leave it, but I will surrender it, hopefully temporarily. Soon. Not yet, not yet. The door creaks and I drop my book on the bed. I try to chew the cake as attractively as one can chew a jaw full of pastry, which is to say – not very. Ginny’s the only one who ever managed.<br/> <br/> It happens. I feel that twist in my chest, a burst of melancholy, but this time it’s followed by envy as I stare at the man in the doorway. So soon now, he’ll have them all.<br/> <br/> He doesn’t notice that my mood’s just soured. He tosses the book on the floor, crawls under the covers, and then kisses me before I’ve had a chance to swallow the last of my cake and it should be gross because he’s licking the crumbs from the roof of my mouth as his fingers hook under the waistband of my fuzziest, most disgusting track pants.<br/> <br/> “Sev’rus –“ I warn. I’m not really in the mood, but that’s never stopped him because he knows how easy I am to seduce. What he wants is usually what he gets – his fingers are winding into the hair behind my ears, and he lowers his mouth to my ear.<br/> <br/> “John’s asleep.” He bites his way down my neck, sliding my fuzzy bottoms over my hips. My stomach is pudgy and my breasts have been ravaged by gravity but he never seems to notice or care. His fingers slide over my skin, rubbing and caressing and pinching by turns, and he buries one of his hands between my legs. “It’s going to be a long seven months without you.”<br/> <br/>The fire catches, and inflames. He’s whispering happy birthday and my name between nips at my breasts.<br/> <br/> An image – a memory – flashes through my mind. My skin was soft, not fresh but still smooth and supple. Beautiful. I was beautiful.<br/> <br/> Now I understand why he looked at me the way he did, full of fire and adoration.<br/> <br/> He’s paused, he’s removing his jeans and pants. There’s a bit of gray at his temples, in the stubble on his cheeks. I love him more now than ever, when we’re about to come full circle. We’ve always been heading to the place where I let him go and hope he’ll come back to me, and somehow we’re almost there.<br/> <br/> “I’m going to seduce you,” he whispers.<br/> <br/> He doesn’t believe it, this future I’ve laid out before him. He’ll do it, because I’m asking, but he doesn’t believe it.<br/> <br/> He tells John he’s got to go away for a while. He tells him he’ll be back.<br/> <br/> He won’t. He’ll never come back here. I can feel it in my bones.<br/> <br/> I can feel it through his skin, where it lays against mine; the fire, the pent up energy, the magic that courses through his veins.<br/> <br/> This isn’t his life. His life is there.<br/> <br/> He slides into me. He is fifty-two, neither old nor young, and he’s a powerful man. He’s at ease with himself, with his life. He loves us – then, now, always. All of us, because love isn’t some sort of finite resource. It’s the only thing that increases the more that we give it away. Love is what’s calling him home.<br/> <br/> He slides into me with a grunt and a moan, and then begins rocking against me, his sharp pubic bone drawing supplications from my lungs and the strength from my muscles. I give in; I surrender.<br/> <br/> Love is what’s happening between these walls, right here, right now.<br/> <br/> Time contracts and recedes. I finish; he follows.<br/> <br/> He tucks his head against my neck, his breath hot against my skin. “You first made me laugh on your birthday, you know.”<br/> <br/> He’s wrong. I remember the first time I made him laugh. In my memory, it’s when I called him a hero. In his, it’s when I set fire to the Aga, finally drawing him from his room. Neither were on my birthday.<br/> <br/> “When you blamed this whole cock-up on me,” he explains.<br/> <br/> At first I have no idea what he’s talking about. And then the memory of my worst birthday, my thirty-fourth, comes back to me. I don’t have any memory of him laughing. He cried, and then –<br/> <br/> “You were laughing? I thought I’d made you cry!”<br/> <br/> And he does it again, laughing silently, with tears on his cheeks. He’s laughing so hard the bed is shaking.<br/> <br/> And the only difference is that now I can see him, and I know what this is.</p>
