    <p>
  <span>In the middle of a crater stood a child with dark red hair blackness oozed out from their mouth as they coughed choking on the darkness lodged in their throat as they tried to scream but no sound could escape. The world was burning metal. The child fell to the ground. There was nothing left. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Suddenly they were running, down a street in a city, but the buildings, all around the buildings crumpled to ground leaving nothing but chaos and dust in their wake, and there was no sound, just a static numbness that seemed to fit well until there was sound. All around there was screaming and bodies. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Oh gods!</span>
  </em>
  <span> The kid thought as bodies seemed to push into them from all sides, screams seemingly echoed in the space between their ears. Green eyes stared horrified into matching green eyes, but those ones were empty, the life inside long gone the kid tried to scream, only the black ooze came out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Inside the barn where no one goes they stood, looking up at it the machine, the child felt </span>
  <em>
    <span>hope</span>
  </em>
  <span> when looking at it a machine that was magical as well as muggle made, the best of both worlds, this machine would be what saved them… </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>If only the child had realised. How certain events can come into play due to the actions one takes to avoid them. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was too late by the time Lily Potter realised she should never have created the machine.</span>
