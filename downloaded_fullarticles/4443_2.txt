    <p>Harry's mind vaguely registered Ron talking animatedly with Dean about this year's Quidditch championship. Any other day he would've added his own opinion but his heart wasn't really in it. The year was already starting to look like a bad one, with the ministry hearing over the summer, and the skeptical whispers about Harry's sanity behind his back, he was starting to think this would be miserable year indeed.</p><p>"Have you noticed?" Hermione's voice jerked Harry out of his depressed reverie.</p><p>"Noticed what?" She rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Hagrid! He's not here." Harry scanned the high table and found she was right. Really there was no missing the man, twice as tall as any normal human and three times wide Hagrid was hard to miss.</p><p>"Maybe he isn't back yet." Harry whispered. "You know, from his mission for the Order." Hermione nodded but looked concerned. Harry let Hagrid's mysterious absence slide from his mind as his gaze traveled the the High table.</p><p>Dumbledore sat in his high back chair chatting with professor Mcgonagall. Snape was in his usual sullen mood glaring harshly at the mashed potatoes sitting innocently on a golden platter before him. No doubt the potatoes had somehow personally offended the surly teacher.</p><p>Harry gasped as he moved his gaze to the next person. A very pink, very short, and very toad like women.</p><p>"I know her." He hissed.</p><p>"Who?" Ron asked, his mouth full of food, tuning into his best friend's hushed conversation with Hermione.</p><p>"That women in pink, Umbridge, I think her name is. She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge." Hermione's eyes widened.</p><p>"Wat sh doin ere en?" Ron said his mouth still full. Hermione sniffed disapprovingly but before she could reprimand him Harry cut across her.</p><p>"Maybe she's teaching defense against the dark arts."</p><p>"But there's an empty chair." Hermione commented. There was indeed a lonely chair placed next to Umbridge.</p><p>Just then the side door to the Great Hall burst open and a cloaked figure glided in. Harry found his gaze drawn to hooded man as he approached Dumbledore, his steps light and graceful.</p><p>To Harry, Hermione, and Ron's surprise Dumbledore stood and bowed. His elegant bow was returned and the wizard stepped closer to converse with the figure. He seemed to ask the man something but the man shook his head and Dumbledore laughed merrily. Nodding the Headmaster gestured to the chair next to Umbridge and seated himself back in the headmaster's chair.</p><p>"Who do ya reckon the new bloke is?" Ron asked, attacking the beef roast. Hermione was watching the stranger intently as he sat down neatly and began to extract small bits of food onto his plate. Strangely the mysterious newcomer still had not lowered his hood.</p><p>"No idea." Harry said beginning to lose interest but Hermione was still observing the new teacher.</p><p>The food vanished to be replaced by puddings, tarts and other sweets, when those too had been consumed by the ravenous students the tables emptied themselves as Dumbledore stood to address the school. Harry turned his attention to the elderly man comforted by the familiar routine.</p><p>"To our newcomers welcome, to our old hands welcome back." He started, eyes twinkling in his age lined face. "Let us begin with some staff announcements.</p><p>"We are happy this year to welcome back professor Grubbly Plank who will be taking over care of magical creatures while professor Hagrid is away. I am also pleased to introduce Miss Delores Umbridge a representative from the Ministry of Magic who will be observing the running of Hogwarts this year."</p><p>He paused for the polite but unenthusiastic clapping. "And finally we have a very special guest who has graciously agreed to take over the subject of defense against the dark arts as a favor for an old friend of mine. Please welcome Professor Legolas Thranduilion to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!"</p><p>Harry focused on the stranger who rose slowly pulling back his dark hood. Harry felt dumb struck, Hermione's mouth fell open along with half the school.</p><p>Beneath the cloak were the most beautiful features Harry had seen. The new professor was young, maybe around twenty, and he put their old DADA teacher Lockhart to shame. His long gold locks framed a fair face with high cheekbones and chiseled chin giving way to clear cerulean eyes and elegantly slanted eyebrows. His visage bespoke of nobility and confidence framed by a healthy ethereal glow.</p><p>Harry couldn't help but stare. He faintly registered girls giggling or making fish like mouth movements across the great hall. Harry was almost sad when the stranger, giving a gracious nod, took his seat again allowing Dumbledore to continue.</p><p>Legolas walked towards the elder man with a long white beard reaching all the way to his belt as soon as he entered the side door to the school. The prince knew he was late but Mithrandir wasn't very specific in his instructions and the elf had to ask the trees for help twice before he made it to the school.</p><p>The headmaster, a wizard by the name of Dumbledore, rose and bowed formally to him. Legolas approached the head table putting one hand over his heart and inclining his head in the usual gesture of greeting for elves.</p><p>"Mae govannen." He greeted.</p><p>"Gi nathlam hí." Dumbledore replied. Legolas looked up surprised.</p><p>"Pedig edhellen?" The wizard chuckled.</p><p>"I'm afraid not. I never had the pleasure to maser that beautiful language of yours. I am sure you will not mind indulging the common tongue for our benefit?"</p><p>"Of course not." Legloas smiled.</p><p>"I must thank you for taking up this post it has saved me a great deal of trouble."His gratitude shining through piercing blue eyes.</p><p>"It is my pleasure." The elf replied politely.</p><p>"Now for introductions would you like titles?" Legolas shook his head.</p><p>"I think just my name will do. No need for titles, I will have quite enough attention and questions as it is." He replied hastily. Dumbledore laughed knowingly.</p><p>"I believe you are right, for no one here, other than myself, has had the pleasure of meeting one of the Eldar. Very well then." He gestured to an empty chair by a short, pink, women and the prince took his seat.</p><p>Legolas smiled with mild amusement at the reaction he got when he lowered his hood to greet the school as their new teacher. He had of course expected the reaction to a degree and was careful to keep his golden hair loose to cover his pointed ears, he would deal with one shock at a time from the student body.</p><p>Dumbledore smiled in his direction and Legolas returned it before resuming his seat. The women next to him, dressed in shocking shades of pink, smiled at him but there was no warmth behind her eyes. The elf was already beginning to feel uncomfortable with the human and focused his attention on Dumbledore.</p><p>In all honesty the prince was not very familiar with the old wizard. Gandalf had simply shown up in Rivendell and asked the elven warrior for a favor. The wizard said he had a friend who was in need of a defense teacher for a year and that the man was trustworthy. However Mithrandir had forgotten a few minor details such as the school was an institute for teaching magic and was actually in a world apart from Middle-Earth.</p><p>Legolas sighed but took it all in strides. He already had experience with rather strange things in his millennia of life, especially when he was around Gandalf the Grey.</p><p>Legolas imagined the enraged face of his father when he learned his son had once again managed to slip off on an escapade without his knowledge. A year was nothing to an elf but Legolas still was hesitant to accept the request. He was enjoying his time with Estel in Rivendell and the elf knew how good the idiot Ranger was at getting himself into trouble.</p><p>No way in all of Arda the future king could last an entire year without ensnaring himself in some catastrophe or another. The prince smiled fondly at the memory of his friend before turning his attention back to the elderly headmaster.</p><p>"In other news Quidditch tryouts will take place…."</p><p>"Humm hum." Dumbledore paused as the pink women who Harry was beginning to dislike for reasons he couldn't quite explain stood to make a speech but no one was listening. Students were still too focused on the mysterious figure now gazing politely at Professor Umbridge but his expression was rather blank like the rest of the student body.</p><p>Harry was snapped back to reality only when Dumbledore dismissed them and the hall was filled with the scarping of benches as students shuffled tiredly to their dormitories.</p><p>"Whatcha think of the new one? Professor Thran-du-something." Ron asked Harry and Hermione. They were sitting in three plush armchairs by the Gryffindor common room fire.</p><p>"It's Tranduilion." Hermione said snappishly.</p><p>"Yeah that one!"</p><p>"Well I think…"</p><p>"He's perfect." Lavender said dreamily startling Harry by appearing right next to him.</p><p>"Well that wasn't what I was going to say but yeah, I guess he is different." Harry said.</p><p>"In a really good way." Hermione said her eyes distant.</p><p>"Not you too Mione." Ron cried in exaggerated horror. She blushed and recovered her businesslike pose.</p><p>"Well I have to admit he is different like Harry said but I think he'll be a good teacher."</p><p>"You're only saying that because he's handsome." Ron said shrewdly.</p><p>"I am not!"</p><p>"At least the DADA professor isn't that Umbridge women. I don't like her." Harry noted, stopping Ron and Hermione before their bickering got out of hand.</p><p>"I don't like the fact that she's at Hogwarts. It means the Ministry is trying to interfere." Hermione said seriously.</p><p>"She isn't just here to 'observe the running of Hogwarts' that's for sure." Harry said bitterly. "She is not going to be good for Hogwarts."</p><p>"If by that, you are referring to her appalling cardigan then yes I agree wholeheartedly." One of the Weasley twins, probably Fred, popped up leaning against Ron's armchair.</p><p>"I agree." George said solemnly. "It is truly sad to see the day that cardigan has been allowed to enter our proud and noble school." Harry smiled lightly at the twins antics standing to head upstairs.</p><p>"No matter what kind of teacher he is I guess we will find out tomorrow." Harry said stepping up the spiral staircase with Ron behind him.</p><p>"Yeah. I hope he's good but I mean considering the DADA teachers we've had it's a real fifty-fifty shot ain't it." Ron yawned.</p><p>"Guess so." As Harry lay down in his warm four poster bed his mind was still wondering about the enigmatic new teacher.</p><p>Thranduilion, what a strange name. Harry thought to himself and even as sleep began to claim the young wizard Harry couldn't shake the feeling that there was something different about the new defense against the dark art teacher.</p><p>Something not normal…something not quite human.</p><p>Elvish Translations:</p><p>Mae govannen - Well met</p><p>Gi nathlam hí - You are welcome here</p><p>Pedig edhellen - You speak elvish?</p>
