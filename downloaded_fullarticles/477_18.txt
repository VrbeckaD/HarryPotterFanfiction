    <p><em>‘I shouldn’t have said that.’ </em>It ran through Harley’s mind on repeat as she stared at the closed yard door of a small home in Surrey. She’d been frustrated, angry. There were spiders in the cupboard, she didn’t like spiders. It felt weird when they walked on her. Dudley’s room didn’t have spiders. She just wanted a room that didn’t have spiders and there was an empty room on the second floor. She just wanted to sleep without spiders walking all over her. Was that too much to ask? Instead Vernon pulled her by her arm and threw her outside into the backyard. She had heard the door lock click into place.</p><p><em>‘This will teach you to be grateful for what we give you, you little freak.’ </em>Her eyes stung and she felt tears coming. She couldn’t cry. Crying meant bad things would happen. She sat at the small step and buried her face in her knees. A sob escaped her throat and she quickly cowered her mouth with her hand. She sat there just listening. Listening for the doors unlocking, for Vernon’s barking voice, for a hand coming for her face.</p><p>But there was nothing, no noise at all. Maybe they couldn’t hear her. She hoped so. Better to be sure. Better to be far away if they could. She quickly got up and ran to the small shed at the back of the yard. She hid behind it among aunt Petunia’s rose bushes. The sobs were muffled behind her hand. She leaned her head back trying to make the tears stop, tried to make them go back.</p><p>That is when she saw it, a single shooting star.</p><p>
  <em>‘If you want something really, really badly, Dudleykins, you should ask a shooting star for it.’</em>
</p><p>Aunt Petunia’s voice came to her. Something she wanted really, really badly. “I, I wi-wish for a friend,” she said slowly. “A best friend. Someone to listen to me and someone to talk to.” She bit her lip. She remembered looking at Dudley and his friends at the playground. “And someone to play with.” Vernon’s angry purplish face flashed before her eyes, his hand raised. “A-and someone to, to protect me.” A sob left her. “An angel.” That sounded like an angel to her. Someone kind and caring and protective and patient and playful and good. “Send me the nicest angel you have…please.”</p><p>.</p><p>Harley looked around, her eyes darted about quickly trying to take everything in. She was standing in a park, a park she didn’t recognize. There were also no people around her. She’d been by the shed, she was sure of it. And it had been night just a second ago, it was midday here, wherever here was. This was weird and scary. She didn’t like this at all.</p><p>“Hello!” She yelled out. No one answered. She was getting really scared now. Anyone would have been fine, even Dudley. She gripped the bottom of her shirt her knuckles turning white and her lip between her teeth. Maybe, maybe they just didn’t hear her, that had to be it. “Hello!” She yelled out louder.</p><p>“Oi!” A shout came from behind her. She turned around her eyes wide. Unsure of who she would see.</p><p>There stood a boy with a scowl set on his face. His red eyes glared at her. “Erm, hello?” She said unsure of herself, he looked mean. Immediately the boy yelled out something at her, she jumped slightly. It sounded like a bunch of garbled sounds with no rhyme or reason. “I, I don’t understand you.” His eyebrows drew together and he tilted his head in thought. It looked like he didn’t understand her either. Oh. That, that could be a problem.</p><p>There had to be a way for them to communicate. To at least find out each other’s names, aunt Petunia always said you had to introduce yourself. It was only polite. An idea came to her. She swallowed and put a hand to her chest. “Harley.” His scowl dropped and he looked thoughtful for a second. Then he pointed a finger at her.</p><p>“Hali.” He said. She frowned but nodded in the end, all the kids had a problem with her name, this was close enough for now. Then he pointed to himself. “Katsuki.”</p><p>“Kat-Kat...Katsu…su.” She tried her hardest. Well he shortened her name first, didn’t he. “Suki.” She finally said with a nod. He looked annoyed at that.</p><p>“Katsuki,” he repeated his name slowly, each letter passing between clenched teeth in a low hiss.</p><p>“Suki.” She answered with a shrug. His nose wiggled in distaste. It did sound a bit girly if she were honest, all the boys at her park wanted to be seen as tough. Dudley wanted to be seen as tough. And girly things weren’t exactly tough. He mumbled something at her again, something short she couldn’t understand. He let out a frustrated huff before grabbing her hand and pulling her along. They looked together around the park and found no one, so they expanded their search to the surrounding streets.</p><p>Suki seemed to know the area so she was perfectly alright with being pulled around by the blonde. But the longer their search went on the more scared they both became. Suki covers his fear with anger and annoyance. He shouted things at the houses, things that sound angry and insulting. But she could feel his hand shaking every time they turned a corner and the street was empty. She squeezed his hand to try and reassure him. His head snapped towards her, red eyes glaring. She tried to tell him that it was okay, through just her expression. That she was scared too, but they had each other and they would find someone and they would be fine. They <em>would </em>be fine. His glare let up and he nodded. A smile overtook her face.</p><p><em>‘Wake up freak!’ </em>A shout startled her. It sounded distant, yet no less frightening. She dug her feet in, now truly scared. Vernon was angry at her. This wasn’t good. It wasn’t good at all. Suki looked at her in confusion. He hadn’t heard anything. He said something. A question probably, but no sound came from his mouth. She tried to say something anything, but before she could she was shaken awake. Suki’s worried face was replaced by Vernon’s purple, angry face. She flinched away, her back hitting the shed wall behind her. Something dug into her back uncomfortably.</p><p>“Get up you freak,” he said, much quieter that he normally would have. They were outside now, of course, the neighbors could hear. Can’t let the neighbors hear. “Get up and get inside, before one of those noisy bastards sees you,” he hissed at her. The sun had barely risen, she realized. It was early, she realized, really early, no one else would be awake now. No one would see her coming into the house. She scrambled up, the thorns catching on her clothes and skin. Vernon was already walking towards the house when she got up. She ran after him, he might just change his mind and leave her outside for the day if she was too slow.</p><p>She stumbled into the kitchen. Vernon was glaring down at her, his mustache moving as he grumbled something at her. “Get upstairs and clean yourself. And clean your clothes, you ungrateful freak.” His mustache moved as he muttered to himself. “Dirtying up the clothes we gave you.” He continued in a louder tone then. “Then you’ll help Pet make breakfast. Am I understood?” His words were harsh, but Harley just nodded quietly. He hadn’t raised his hand yet, he wasn’t so angry. She would like to keep it that way. She didn’t want to sleep outside again. “Good. Get going.” He snapped and she was out of the kitchen before he even finished. Trying to finish up in the bathroom as quickly as possible.</p><p>The warm water felt nice on her skin. She hadn’t realized how cold she had been until the scalding hot water hit her back. She had gasped loudly at the feeling. She scrubbed herself clean as quickly as she could. After she was done she took the dirty clothes and quickly scrubbed all the dirt stains. She scrubbed until there was no dirt on them before stuffing them into the washing machine. It wasn’t time for the white clothes to be washed, small miracles. Harley grabbed some clean clothes from her cupboard. All her clothes were in a cupboard in the bathroom, a small thing stuffed in a corner next to the toilet. There just wasn’t enough room under the stairs.</p><p>Once dressed she went back to the kitchen. Aunt Petunia was already there humming as watched something sizzle on the stove. Vernon was sitting at the table with a cup of strong tea and todays newspaper. “Harley, hand me the plates,” aunt Petunia ordered, her tone light, but there was no doubt it was an order and not a request. Unlike Vernon aunt Petunia never hit her, she never yelled at her and she was never mean. But the woman was dismissive of her. She looked at her niece like one would at a stray dog they were forced to take care of. Aunt Petunia was her favorite relative, even if it didn’t mean much.</p><p>It was while she was helping aunt Petunia make breakfast that she had remembered the blonde boy with red eyes. She wondered about him. Now it seemed obvious that she had been dreaming. But why had she dreamt up the boy? And the neighborhood they were in, she had never seen it before. It looked nothing like the neighborhood park aunt Petunia took her and Dudley to. And she couldn’t understand a word the boy had said. Why did she have such a weird dream?</p><p><em>‘Send me the nicest angel you have…please.’ </em>The words came back to her slowly and her eyes widened. Was Suki her angel? Did the shooting star make her wish come true? But…But that had been only one dream. She’d wished for a friend and a protector. How would Suki protect her if she saw him only in her dreams. And what if it had been a onetime thing only? What would she do then?</p><p>“Get to it girl.” Aunt Petunia snapped at her, tone harsh and annoyed, startling the living daylights out of Harley. She scrambled to get the plates to the table and almost fell in the process. Vernon would have hit her if she had dropped the plates, there was no doubt about it. Dudley was thundering down the stairs just as she set down the last plate.</p><p>She was given little food compared to what Vernon and Dudley ate. Aunt Petunia usually ate just a piece of buttered toast with her tea for breakfast. Still there was enough food for Harley to feel full at the end. Aunt Petunia watched her like a hawk as she ate. She was making sure Haley has eaten everything on her plate, always did, they weren’t going to be wasting food aunt Petunia had told her once.</p><p>She watched the three of them interact at the table and felt like an outsider looking in through a window. Dudley was saying something about an adventure and his friends and how high he had kicked the ball yesterday. Aunt Petunia called him Diddy and stroked his blond locks lovingly. Vernon’s mustache wiggled happily as he praised his son for some minor thing he had done.</p><p>There was a strong pang of jealousy and longing, it griped her heart and Harley couldn’t quite breath in properly. Her lungs felt constricted. She wanted to say she had kicked the ball higher than Dud, that she had out run him and his friends. She had wanted aunt Petunia to stroke her hair and to tell her how good she is. She swallowed heavily, the jealousy dropped down to her stomach where it felt like it was burning through her. She averted her eyes back to her plate.</p><p>Would she see Suki again? Would he care?</p><p>.</p><p>Katsuki looked around himself. He knew this park like the back of his hand, but usually there were people around, now there was no one. It was just him. He frowned. This was the second time this had happened. Except there had been a red headed girl around last time, a girl with startling green eyes and baggy boy clothes. He didn’t wish to admit it, but last time he had been scared. There had been no one there, not even the old hag and she was always around. Always. And the kid kept talking weirdly, he couldn’t understand shit.</p><p>He knew he was dreaming this time. He remembered going to bed, remembered lying in bed and thinking about playing with his friends tomorrow. Then he had appeared here. So where was the redhead. Last night he had found her by the swings, so maybe. He was already walking there without really thinking about it. He wasn’t used to being alone, usually he was the center of attention, the leader. He was the best after all. But now there was no one around and it was scary. There was no gravel crunching under sneakers as his friends scrambled to follow. Just silence. He hurried his steps and hoped the girl was there. He didn’t want to be alone, dream or not.</p><p>She was. Her head was turning around as she looked at the park. Her movements weren’t as jittery as yesterday. She was not scared. He wondered at that. Why wasn’t she scared of being all alone? Was she expecting him to show up again?</p><p>“Hali,” he called at her. Her head turned to him. Eyes the color of poison blinked for a moment before a giant smile overtook her face as she recognized him. “Suki!” she called back happily. He was startled a little at that, she was so happy, so happy to see him. Not even Izuku was that happy to see him and Izuku adored him, worshiped him almost. He was almost as good as All Might in Izuku’s mind. He had known Izuku since forever and yet the girl he had known for only one dream was so much happier to see him. He liked her already. She already knew how awesome he was.</p><p>He gave her a confident grin, a grin that showed all his teeth. Hali ran towards him and she was surprisingly quick for such a small slim thing. She pulled at his hand and garbled something at him happily. He glared at her in annoyance, she couldn’t have forgotten already. “I can’t understand you, dummy.”</p><p>Her eyes widened and her mouth fell open in an o shape before her brows drew together in thought. Suddenly the grin was back and her eyes sparkled. She poked him in the cheek, said something short, before she ran away. His wide eyes followed her in confusion as she ran away. What was she up to? She got quite far away when she turned around and poked her tongue out at him. That was a challenge if he ever saw one. His grin was only slightly bloodthirsty, he swears. It was a challenge he planned on winning.</p><p>With a roar he was running after her. Hali let out a squeak before running away. They were both grinning. In the end he barely caught her and only because she had tried jumping over the swing and had tripped, her foot caught on the wooden seat. She hadn’t fallen but it had slowed her down enough for him to catch up and tackle her to the ground. They were both on the ground panting hard and grinning at each other. Hm, he would have to get faster. He doubted she would trip like that a second time. And he was the best, couldn’t have this slip of a thing faster than him.</p><p>That is how the rest of the dream went. The two of them ran around and played, issuing small challenges to each other. Katsuki was better at ball juggling but Hali managed to get up to four kicks after trying it only a few times. Hali was a quick and nimble climber, but Katsuki was stubborn enough to follow her as high as she would go. Katsuki was better at skipping stones, but Hali wasn’t entirely hopeless either. They communicated the best they could through gestures and facial expressions and wild hand movements. It was one of the best experiences either of them had.</p><p>And then, one moment Katsuki was staring at Hali’s grinning face as she waved wildly at the swings and the next he was looking at the soft brown eyes of his dad. He blinked in confusion, this was very disorienting. “Come on Katsuki, time to wake up.” He blinked up at the man, confused, brain still not adjusted at the sudden shift of reality. “Brush your teeth and get downstairs, breakfast is almost ready.” Dad gave him a soft smile before leaving the room. Katsuki sat up in bed and looked after the man. That was the second time he had dreamt about Hali.</p><p>And then the words registered in his brain. He barely kicked the blanket off his feat as he scrambled to get up. It was pancake day, mom promised last night. He had to get downstairs before old man ate them all! And he would if given the chance. He ran from his room, his feet sliding slightly on the shiny wood in the hallway. The dream and Hali were far away from his mind.</p><p>It was only later on in the day that he remembered Hali again. He was with his friends at the park and he was showing off how awesome he was at ball juggling. He managed to get up to twelve this time, a new personal record, and the other three gushed at his awesome self, Izuku especially. It was while he was looking at Izuku’s amazed face that Hali came to his mind.</p><p>Hali reminded him somewhat of Izuku, she too was small and thin and somewhat timid. At times she had seemed like she was afraid of something. But as soon as he had showed some skill of his off she took it as a challenge, her fears forgotten. There had been a sharpness to her eyes at that moment, a competitive edge that poked right at his own. Was Izuku the same? Timidness that hid a competitive spirit and a will to be the best? Izuku had always said that he would become a hero, a number one hero. You had to be competitive to become number one. You just had to. There were so many losers trying to be number one. You couldn’t just let them walk all over you. No one was going to just hand the title to you either, you needed to have the drive and skill to get it yourself. To snag it in front of everyone’s noses. You would have to claw at others to get to the title.</p><p>“Why don’t you try it?” He asked Izuku, his hand holding the ball towards the greenhaired boy. It was a test. Izuku’s eyes sparkled and he took the ball. He tried it for the first time and his foot had completely missed the ball. The other two laughed at his attempt and Katsuki grinned smugly, just as he expected. Hali had done the same the first time she tried it. He expected Izuku to scoff at the ball and try again, his pride hurt but still willing to be better. He expected Izuku to be just a bit angry at his failure. Katsuki was wrong, he didn’t like being wrong. Instead the boy had grabbed at the edge of his shirt and looked down at his sneakers and Katsuki could see tears gathering in his eyes. He felt…disappointed.</p><p>He shrugged it off. Maybe Izuku just wasn’t good with the ball. It wasn’t Katsuki’s favorite either. They need to try something different. Katsuki couldn’t have been wrong about Izuku, he was never wrong, he refused to be. Hali had been good with the monkey bars, he remembered. She could swing herself upside down and hang on with just her legs while poking her tongue out at him in challenge. Maybe Izuku would be good at the monkey bars too.</p><p>Katsuki managed to get across no problem, he wasn’t sure he could hang upside down like Hali. He was not sure how she had done it. So, he wasn’t willing to embarrass himself like that. He would watch closely what she did next dream and would just copy her. Easy. The fat one could barely make it up to the top bars, his arms were too weak, while the other one with big teeth could make it just to the middle before his hands just slipped off. And Izuku, Izuku was too afraid to even climb all the way to the top. And again Hali, came to his mind. She’d climbed a tree as good as any monkey would have when their ball got stuck in one of the branches and had thrown the ball down at him. There had been no fear in her expression and the tree had been so much higher. Disappointment mixed with something else, something scalding, churned in his stomach again as he watched Izuku cling to the fourth bar, his knees shaking and his eyes filled with tears. He’d been wrong again.</p><p>.</p><p>It was only the third dream and this time Hali showed up with a giant cotton bandage around her left arm all the way up to her elbow. She was grinning happily at him, but his eyes were glued to the bandage. He was pretty sure he could see some sort of discoloration on the bandage. It looked yellowish and he wondered what kind of wound she had under there. Why was it yellow? Blood was red, he was sure of it. It had been red the one time he scraped his knee. She was in front of him now, babbling something or other in that language of hers he couldn’t understand. Katsuki grabbed her around the wrist, right where the bandage ended.</p><p>“What is this? What happened?” He asked, no demanded, he needed to know. Had she fallen and scraped her whole arm? Had it been something else? Red met green and he saw her expression fall. Her eyes were dull and glassy. She mumbled something at him again and frustration bubbled to the surface. He was not okay with it anymore. He was not okay with not understanding her words. He snarled, pivoted on his heel and dragged her along.</p><p>She was saying something. It was a question he was fairly certain. Her voice had that small tilt he was starting to recognize. “To my house,” he answered. He knew she couldn’t understand, hell maybe that hadn’t even been the question. But it felt better to try and explain. He knew the path between his house and the park very well. They were at the front door sooner than he expected, it felt like they skipped a part of the path. Katsuki put it out of his mind, it wasn’t important now. He was barging through the front door. Hali hesitated at the door and he had to pull harder on her wrist to get her moving again.</p><p>He led her up to his room. Once there he dropped her wrist and started searching the boxes next to his desk. He was sure the cards were somewhere in there. He had seen them just a few days ago, he was sure of it. A quick winning yell left him when he found them. He turned around towards Hali. She wasn’t looking at him. Instead she was looking around the room, her fingers hesitated over a few things, All Might toys and a few books. It was almost as if she was too afraid to touch anything.</p><p>“Hali,” he called and she turned around her eyes wide. He waved the cards in front of her, a happy grin on his face. “Come on.” He tugged her hand towards the bed. She followed her brows drawn together in confusion. Once they were both sitting on the bed facing each other did Katsuki decide to reveal his master plan. He picked a card, looked at it for a moment before showing it to her.</p><p><em>“</em>Inu.” He told her. Her eyes widened in surprise. “Inu.” He repeated, more forcefully this time. His stare pointed. He wanted her to repeat after him. She was confused for only a moment longer, before there was an answering grin.</p><p>“Inu.” She parroted back and now they were both grinning like loons. Hali grabbed the card from his hand before turning it back at him. <em>“Dog.” </em>Hali told him and it was his turn to blink in confusion. <em>“Dog.” </em>She repeated in that same forceful tone he had used and he understood. It felt like she was challenging him again.</p><p><em>“Dog.” </em>He repeated cheerfully, some smugness bleeding into his voice. He was going to win this.</p><p>Cards got picked up quickly, one after the other. Both of them struggled with some sounds but it never took them more than four tries to get the words right. Neither wanted to lose. Neko was cat. Car was kuruma. Josei was woman. Flower was hana. And so on it went until they were out of cards. They were both glaring at the cards, there was no clear winner and they were out. Then Hali grabbed at one of the cards, looked at it for a moment before grinning and showing it to him.</p><p>“Neko.” She said and he understood immediately. <em>“Cat.” </em>He said right away she huffed at him in frustration, her plan foiled. The card started a new pile between them. And now they were going through the pile again. Every time Hali didn’t know the word it went into his pile and Katsuki smugly turned his nose up and Hali huffed at him, her brows together. Every time he didn’t know a word it went into Hali’s pile and she poked her tongue at him while he glared, his teeth grinding against each other.</p><p>And just as they were about to count their cards he woke up to dad’s happy face. He glared at the old man. He was sure he had won that one!</p>
