  <strong>Author's Notes:</strong>
</p><p>Ok, so this is mostly canon-compliant up until the beginning of HBP, the only big things really being different that Harry is a girl, and Barty Crouch Jr. got away at the end of GoF. Otherwise it's pretty much all the same, she still awkwardly dated Cho during fifth year while running the DA, Sirius still died at the Department of Mysteries, the Dursleys are still awful and Dumbledore is still a manipulative fuckwit. The biggest change is that she took Ancient Runes as a subject as well as Divination and Care of Magical Creatures, since she's closer with Hermione in this and takes her studies more seriously. Turns out she really loves the subject and is something of a Runes prodigy, especially when combined with her aptitude for DADA and her self-taught skills in thread magic. It's not touched on too much initially but will be very important later, along with the fact she's a Parselmouth. This will get increasingly dark as she becomes disillusioned with the manipulations of the Light and is drawn towards the charismatic Dark Lord who is determined to win her to his side. Any especially graphic or violent scenes will be tagged and listed in the end notes, so always check those if you're concerned about the content.</p><p>
  <strong>Reader's Notes:</strong>
</p><p>So, this is the first time I've recorded a podfic- I apologise for the bizarre accent in advance and hope it's okay to listen to! And do go check out the original work- it's 28 chapters in and genuinely one of my favourite on this site. Oh, and I re-recorded during the actual chapter if I stumbled- that bit at the begining was just because I did it when people were coming in and didn't want to explain to them what fanfic was so had to get it Done before the weekend. Also, I couldn't figure out how to embed the player, but the link works ^^' hmu if you know the way to embed dropbox? Either here, or my tumblr is kelpiesofthenorth. Thank you! Enjoy!</p><p>Â </p><p><strong>Edit 18/3/2020: </strong>I missed the first paragraph of the story during recording- please find it now added!</p>
