    <p>Draco Malfoy had a headache.</p><p>A headache that was not helped by having an extra cup of tea at dinner.  Nor was it helped by Pansy rubbing his temples for twenty minutes (though he claimed to her that it did so she would stop). </p><p>It wasn't helped by going to bed early.  Especially when Crabbe and Goyle both decided to go bed early with him and the giant oafs snored like dragons with sinus infections.</p><p>He knew he could go to the Hospital Wing and Madam Pomfrey would look after him.  But he didn't feel like dealing with her tutting and complaining.  Wandering around in her robe to fetch a headache powder and bemoaning her missing sleep.</p><p>He was quite sure that would CAUSE another headache as soon as the first was cured.</p><p>So he lay awake in the dark, staring at the small patch of moonlight he could see on the floor between the curtains of his bed.  He watched it crawl across the floor as the rest of his year came in and got into their beds.  Watched it as even deep breathing of a bunch of other bodies joined the snores of his two 'friends'.  And then when it had moved so far that he couldn't see it anymore, he slipped out of bed.</p><p>He was quite confident there would be no one else up now.  He could go into the quiet of the common room where the air was lighter and he could lie on a couch and stare up at the glass domed ceiling.  Watch the mer-creatures moving around in the dim green light. </p><p>It wasn't the best night, but it was the best he could make of it.  And he was becoming rather a champion at making the best of bad situations.</p><p>He pulled a heavy fur throw from a nearby arm chair and slid down onto the couch with a low sigh, shifting onto his back to look upwards, hoping maybe that would lull him to sleep despite the pounding of his head and the ache in his shoulders.</p><p>It seemed to be working.  Or at least he knew he was drowsing and dozing a little bit when he heard the soft ripple and shift of pages in a book.  He turned his head a bit, at first thinking maybe he had imagined it, but after a moment he heard the slide of a book being pushed back onto a shelf and another one slide off.  The ripple again, the quiet 'shhft' of the paper rubbing against itself as the pages were turned.</p><p>Draco sat up slowly, ready to blast whoever it was, but he found that when his eyes landed on the offending party, he didn't recognize them.</p><p>His eyes moved over the other boy quickly, taking in the smooth dark hair and mature but roundish face.  He had on Slytherin robes and yet, Draco had no idea who he was.</p><p>"What are you doing?"  He demanded.  He figured it didn't really matter if he recognized him or not.  He was still up far too late and was still disturbing him.</p><p>"Trying to find a book I haven't read."  The other boy said, sighing softly and sliding the one he was holding back on the shelf.  "Read that one, too.  Maybe this isn't the shelf I left off on..."</p><p>"Can you stop?  I have a headache, I was trying to sleep.  You should have looked for books earlier."</p><p>"Couldn't."  The boy said, clearly preoccupied as his finger moved to count the book shelves and move one over from where he was.  Then another before he stopped again and ran his finger along the book spines.</p><p>"And why not?"  Draco was a little put off by such a curt answer, as though the other boy had no idea who he was talking to.  And that absolutely would not do.</p><p>"I don't like to come in here when so many others are around.  I didn't even know you were here until you sat up."  He selected another book, then opened the cover and thumbed through the pages.  Sighing rather noisily as he snapped it shut.  "Why do none of these books have any sort of identifying features on the outside that would make it far easier to tell which I've read and which I haven't."</p><p>Draco watched in silence as the boy re-shelved yet another book then trailed his finger down to a lower shelf, picking up a very large and very fat book.  The boy hefted it on one arm to open it, flicking a couple of pages and then smiled in satisfaction.  </p><p>And then the boy walked over and sat himself down in the middle of the couch directly opposite the one Draco himself was occupying. </p><p>"Do you <i>mind</i>?" Draco asked, utterly appalled by this boy's lack of ability to read social cues.</p><p>"No, not at all."  He said with a wave of his hand towards Draco.  "Go ahead with whatever you were doing, you won't bother me."</p><p>Draco just watched, slack jawed, as the other boy crossed his legs and opened the book across his knees, seeming to settle in quite comfortably with it and quite oblivious to the outrage that was coursing through Draco's veins.</p><p>With a huff he flopped back down on the couch, staring murderously up at the glass ceiling of the lake bottom.</p><p>He could, of course, have just gotten up and gone back to his room and his bed.  But doing so would mean this other boy, whoever he was, had won.  And he could <i>not</i> win.  </p><p>And it did have to be said that regardless of how rude this boy was, the soft sound of him turning pages was a lot less intrusive on his head than returning to the snores and nose whistles of his dormitory.</p><p>So he laid there, looking up at the ceiling again, trying to forget that he wasn't alone.  Which was rather hard to do when someone was only a few feet from your face.</p><p>Eventually he turned his head, looking sharply over at the other boy to speak to him again.  "What year are you in?"</p><p>"Seventh."  The boy said without looking up.  He was reading intently from the massive book and looked relatively happy.</p><p>"You can't be in seventh."  Draco said as he sat up on the couch, glaring harder at the other boy.  "I'm in seventh."</p><p>"So because <i>you're</i> in seventh year, I can't be as well?"</p><p>"No."  Draco rolled his eyes, then squeezed them shut with a sigh when that seemed to hurt his head even further.  "I <i>meant</i> that if you were in seventh year I would know who you are.  And I don't."</p><p>"I try not to socialize much."  </p><p>"Or got to any classes?  Or sleep in the dorm?  If you were in seventh year we would have been sharing a dormitory for seven years."</p><p>"Maybe I have been and you just didn't pay any attention to me.  I am not particularly important or very commanding of attention."</p><p>Draco scoffed, sliding back down onto the couch with a huff to follow the scoff.  The mock tone of humble unimportance from the other boy was maddening to say the least.  He was <i>sure</i> he would recognize him.  Seven years at the school, in the same year, he would KNOW who this person is.</p><p>"Are you going to make rude noises all night?  Because if so could you leave?  I wanted to read in quiet."</p><p>Draco's eyes narrowed almost to slits as he sat up and GLARED at the other boy.  This horrible other boy.  He no longer cared if he didn't recognize him and he WAS in his year, he was insufferable and he greatly hoped he never ever noticed him again.</p><p>He got up and even though it hurt his head he made as much noise as possible returning to the dormitory.  He hurled himself into bed fuming with anger.</p><p>He tossed and turned for a long time, before falling into a restless sleep rife with angry dreams that were full of swimming green light, green water and snakes.  He woke again just after dawn, long before anyone else would be awake.</p><p>Coming out of those dreams had felt like he'd swum up through the lake and resurfaced.  Like he'd had to drag himself out from a very far way to make it back to the world.  It left him feeling disoriented and like the whole world wasn't quite real.</p><p>He sat up, rubbing his eyes and carefully probing his temples to see if if the headache was still there.  He rolled his shoulders a bit and smiled as he realized the pain was fully gone.</p><p>As he got up and went to pull on his uniform and robes, he thought about the night before.  About the boy he'd seen.  The mystery boy who was supposedly in the same year as him.</p><p>It seemed a little fuzzy and murky.  Not quite all there and mostly dream like.  He wondered if in his half awake state and the headache he'd had if he hadn't just dreamed the whole thing.</p><p>It actually made more sense that he'd dreamed it.  And the lack of clarity and memory around it made it seem like a dream, just as real as the green light, the water and the snakes that had also plagued his dreams.  He knew he'd been dozing in the common room on the couch.  Quite likely he'd fallen into a deeper sleep for awhile and dreamed the whole thing...  </p><p>To be honest, he wasn't even completely certain he'd even gone out to the Common Room at all.  He might have just thought he had and been sleeping the whole time.</p><p>More to content himself than anything else, he turned to look around the room.  He counted the beds even though he knew by heart how many there were and who slept in them.   If there was another boy, somehow, in seventh year, there would be a bed for him.</p><p>And there definitely was not.</p><p>So Draco Malfoy, without a headache, squared his shoulders and smoothed a hand through his hair.  He didn't think anything else about the weird dream and the strange rude boy in it.</p><p>He should have guessed he was a dream, anyways.  No one would dare speak to him like that and actually get away with it.</p><p>He left the Slytherin Dorms without walking through the middle of the common room or getting anywhere near the couches and the fire and so he didn't see the fur blanket he'd used still puddled on the floor in front of the couch.</p><p>Nor did he see the large book on the floor half hidden under the second couch.  Shoved there as if someone was fully intending on coming back for it.</p>
