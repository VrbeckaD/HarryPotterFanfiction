    <p>It had been a month after the wedding and during that month, nothing regarding the war had changed. Peter was nowhere to be found and muggles, muggleborns and aurors were still dying. Severus worried everyday for his dear friend Lily but James assured that she would be save. Jayden would protect her and he and the remaining marauders would check up on her now and then.</p><p>"Besides, she can protect herself pretty well." James said as he adjusted his glasses. "I know.." Severus said but he wasn't convinced of her safety yet.</p><p>"Severus, I just want as bad as you that the war was over. We all want that." James said and he hugged his husband from behind. The thought of him being married to Severus and him calling Severus his husband did make him smile. "I'll protect you with my life." James said.</p><p>"Don't be silly, Potter. I can protect myself." Severus said.</p><p>"Oh well, Mr. Potter. I knew that." James said and Severus chuckled at that. He was glad that he took James' name though.</p><p>"James, how are your parents?" Severus asked after a short silence.</p><p>"Not too well, they're sick and I'm sure it won't take too long before they..." James sighed. "Even if they don't pass away from the illness...they're so old, Severus." James added.</p><p>"James, didn't you say that they'd like a grandchild before they passed?" Severus brought up.</p><p>"Yeah but since you're a man as well they said it would be impossible to get a baby unless we adopted one so they weren't upset about it." James said.</p><p>"James, men can get pregnant." Severus said softly.</p><p>"What?" James asked in disbelief.</p><p>"Well, at least wizards can. It requires some magic but..it's possible." Severus said. James looked at him, still in disbelief but then he was about to ask if Severus knew what kind of spell they needed to make it happen.</p><p>"It's not a spell but a potion and it's fairly easy to make. I have all the needed ingredients except from..." Severus looked at James.</p><p>"From what?" James asked.</p><p>"Both of our DNA's." Severus said.</p><p>"Merlin, do I need to cum into a potion?" James asked a bit horrified.</p><p>"No, James, no. I need some hair from you and from me as well." Severus said and James sighed in relief and then went with his hand to his hair, ready to pull a few hairs out but Severus stopped him.</p><p>"James, do you really want a child with me? I mean, are you sure you want it to possibly look like me?" Severus asked and James leaned closer to him.</p><p>"Of course, why not? Severus, if it will turn out to be anything like you, they'll be brilliant." James said and Severus turned red. "You're too sweet, James.." Severus muttered.</p><p>James just smirked a bit and pulled a couple hairs out before handing them to Severus. "Thanks..." Severus said softly and then he remembered something.</p><p>"A boy or a girl? And who carries?" Severus asked.</p><p>"Well, how can you decide beforehand if it's a girl or a boy and I'm not sure about who should carry, Sev." James said and he thought about it.</p><p>"I can by either adding red berries if we want a boy or rosemary if we want a girl." Severus said.</p><p>"I don't know about you but... I don't care if it's a boy or a girl." James said and he followed Severus to the potion room in their house.</p><p>"I don't care either.." Severus said and in the potion room he put James' hair aside before he got the kettle ready for the potion. He got the other ingredients he needed and prepared them the way they needed to prepared before putting them into the kettle. Then he put the few hairs in that James gave him before he pulled a few of his own and put them into the kettle as well. James watched him while he brewed the potion.</p><p>"So... who carries?" James asked softly.</p><p>"Hmm, maybe you could? I think you'd be able to handle it better than me." Severus said.</p><p>James looked at him but then nodded. "Alright, do I just take the potion?" James asked.</p><p>"Yes, you do so after...intercourse." Severus said softly.</p><p>"Why are you still so shy about that, Sevie?" James chuckled.</p><p>"About what?" Severus looked at him before looking back to the potion.</p><p>"About sex." James clarified.</p><p>Severus blushed and James just chuckled more. Despite Severus' shyness, it was actually James who was on the receiving end.</p><p>"The potion is ready." Severus said and he took an empty bottle and filled the bottle with the potion before closing the bottle.</p><p>"So when do we...?" James asked.</p><p>"Whenever you want..." Severus said and that made James pull him closer.</p><p>"Right now?" Severus blinked but he didn't stop the other. They tried that night but unfortunatly they were out of luck the first time and a few couple times after that.</p><p>It actually ended up taking them a year but eventually in late 1979, James got pregnant and although his parents wouldn't be there to see the child, they at least got the news before they passed away in January 1980.</p><p>James gave birth on the 31st of July in 1980, coincidently a few days after Lily gave birth to her own son and Remus and Sirius happened to have adopted a child a few months prior.</p><p>"It's a boy..." James said softly, holding the little baby wrapped in a red blanket close to him. "What's going to be his name?" Sirius asked as he held an one year old girl in his arms. Her name was Rachel and she had been left orphaned after her muggle mother died and her wizard father had left her at the orphanage for magical children.</p><p>"Well..." James looked at Severus. "What about Harry?" James asked him.</p><p>"Yes. It's very fitting." Severus smiled and he kissed Harry's forehead.</p><p>James smiled at him. He was tired but he was so happy because he was finally able to see his baby and he was able to see Severus smile again. It had been a while that Severus genuinely smiled ever since what happened at the wedding with Peter. But he also knew deep down that Severus was now going to worry even more now they had a child to care of and to protect. James was worried as well but he would never let anything happen to Severus or to Harry.</p>
