    <p>“Hello there.”</p><p>Anna Strong jumped and nearly tripped over the hem of her robe as she tried to move away from the soft voice by her ear. She whirled around and came face to chest with a Slytherin boy- a year older than her, she believed, and not liked by anyone that she knew.</p><p>“Hello,” She replied, folding her arms around the books she held to her chest and tucking them into her robe. The frigid air had moved in earlier that week and there were a few snowflakes drifting from the sky.</p><p>“I’m sorry to startle you,” The boy spoke quietly and calmly, his eyes never blinking or moving from her face. It made Anna feel very uncomfortable. “But I don’t think I’ve seen you around before.”</p><p>Contemplating the boy before her, Anna subtly took a step away but he moved closer almost immediately.</p><p>“No, I don’t suppose you would have. Our dormitories are not near each other’s, after all.” She replied calmly, although trying to lean away from him.</p><p>“What a shame.” There was an awkward, cold silence for a few seconds before Anna decided to break it.</p><p>“Sorry, I must be getting back.” She hurriedly replied before going to move past him.</p><p>“My name’s John,” He called after her. “John Graves Simcoe. I hope I’ll be seeing you around more often.”</p><p>Anna hoped otherwise.</p><p>~*~</p><p>“Seriously? He just popped up behind you and started chatting?” Abe said through a mouth of mashed potatoes.</p><p>“You’re disgusting. But yeah, right behind my ear. It was creepy, I didn’t see or hear him coming. It was like he apparated.” She shuddered, piling more food onto her plate and smacking Caleb’s hand away from her cup as he landed on the bench beside her. “Get your own.”</p><p>“No can do Annie, this is a flying visit.” He grinned before nicking a sausage off of Abe’s plate and downing a cup of pumpkin juice. “Gotta find Ben.”</p><p>“Oh yeah, how’s your boyfriend?” Abe grinned over his cup.</p><p>“Great.” Caleb winked, grabbing a sandwich from one of the plates before jumping up again. “See ya’ll at Astronomy.” Then he was gone.</p><p>Anna shook her head, turning back to her food just as Mary sat down next to Abe, kissing his cheek. </p><p>“Afternoon Mary,” She greeted, before wiping her fingers on a napkin. “If you’ll excuse me, I have to go to the library.” The words were immediately ignored by the couple before her and Anna rolled her eyes, gathering her things before leaving.</p><p>~*~<br/>
When Anna had finally climbed to the top of the Astronomy tower the rest of the class were already there and waiting to start, but for once she wasn’t the one holding them up. Professor Sinistra was deep in conversation with a fourth year Hufflepuff- she’d seen him around the tower before but they had never spoken, him being a year above her and her friends.</p><p>“… and you see, professor, the alignment of the stars this weekend is particularly important because-“</p><p>“Yes I understand, Edmund. Unfortunately, I have to attend a staff meeting, I will speak to you later about arranging for you to be here unattended but for now I have a class,” She motioned to the third years gathered around, who all sat to attention the moment her gaze was turned to them.</p><p>The Hufflepuff looked around, as if suddenly realising how many people were gathered around them before turning red and stammering,<br/>
“I-I am so sorry, professor, I did not- I- I’ll go, now. Sorry.” He muttered, grabbing his bag and what was presumably his telescope case before hurrying towards the exit. His eyes met Anna’s as he passed and his cheeks reddened further before he vanished down the stairs. </p><p>“My apologies class, I did not realise that talk would take me so long.” The Professor addressed them, before gesturing to the board and giving them a rundown of the lesson.</p><p>When Anna, Caleb and Abe got back to their dormitory it was well past 3AM and Anna merely threw her books by her bed before collapsing face-first on it. She heard a rustling from the bed opposite hers before someone landed beside her and she groaned.</p><p>“How was Astronomy?” Peggy asked, laying on her back beside Anna and turning her head to look at her face.</p><p>Anna grunted in reply and turned over, burying her head under a pillow before remembering something.</p><p>“You’re friends with Andre, the fourth year right?”</p><p>Peggy smirked at her.</p><p>“Friends isn’t the word I’d use, but close enough. His name’s John, by the way.”</p><p>“God, what is it with all the fourth years being called John.” Anna muttered before uncovering her eyes. “D’you know some fourth year called John… Simcoe, I think? Slytherin, about six foot and-“</p><p>“Creepier than a Thestral? Yes, he’s in John’s potions class. No-one likes him but he’s the teacher’s favourite.” Peggy made a face before reaching over and tugging on Anna’s hair.<br/>
“When will you let me do something with this?”</p><p>“I like Thestrals. And when I have a date.”</p><p>“That means never, doesn’t it?”</p><p>~*~<br/>
The next morning found Anna crossing the courtyard, arms ladened with books and her robe attempting to slip from her shoulders as she crunched through the snow towards her transfiguration lesson. She had a few minutes to spare and she was hoping that for once she would get there in good time-</p><p>“Hello again.” Simcoe had yet again appeared without preamble, right at her elbow.</p><p>“Oh- hello.” She replied, trying to quicken her pace. Much to her annoyance he kept up easily, being at least half a foot taller than her.</p><p>“Where are you headed? I’d like to accompany you, make sure you get there all right.” He was doing the creepy non-blinking thing again, and it made Anna want to get as far away as possible. </p><p>“That’s quite alright, I don’t have far to go. I really should-“</p><p>“No need to rush.” Simcoe halted and grabbed her arm, making her drop half the books she was carrying into the snow. “Surely you can spare a moment for a chat.”</p><p>His hand was heavy and cold on her arm, the tight grip not showing signs of letting her go. </p><p>Anna went to grab her books but he beat her to it, gathering them with the hand not holding her wrist. </p><p>“Let go of me.” She let all friendliness out of her voice and tried tugging her arm away, but to no avail.</p><p>“No. It’s not polite to turn down someone’s attempts at friendship at the first go.” He replied, voice hard as he stared at her.</p><p>“I said let go!” Anna raised her voice and was about to stamp her boot on Simcoe’s foot when another voice rang out.</p><p>“I believe she asked you to let her go.” Anna turned her head and was surprised to see the Hufflepuff from the Astronomy tower, standing several feet away and glaring at Simcoe with what could only be described as hatred.</p><p>“Hewlett. I believe that it is none of your business.” Simcoe replied, grip not wavering. “I was speaking to the lady kindly and she was rude to me. I am merely-“</p><p>“You are harassing a younger student with no provocation than her trying to get to her class. If you don’t desist then I will be forced to make you.” </p><p>Anna glanced down and saw the wand that the Hufflepuff- Hewlett, she renamed him in her mind- gripped firmly in his hand. </p><p>There was a few moments of silence before Simcoe’s hand finally released her and he stepped away.</p><p>“Fine. I was only trying to be friendly.” He coolly returned, extending the books to Anna before dropping them in the snow by her feet. “Whoops. Have a nice day.”</p><p>With that he turned and left, not sparing a glance to either student behind him. </p><p>Anna watched him go for a short while before turning to pick up the books, then jumping slightly in surprise when she found Hewlett holding them out for her. </p><p>“I, ah, I dried them for you. The pages may be wrinkled by now but- well.” He looked uncomfortable and Anna took the books, flicking through them before tucking them under her arms. She made to reply when the older boy spoke again,</p><p>“I am sorry, about him. Simcoe has a habit of appearing when unwanted- which is most of the time, of course. I’ve tried to have words with the teachers about him and his… mannerisms, but they see no fault.” He rushed, eyes darting around nervously before settling on her. “Oh! Oh dear, you’re nearly late for the next lesson time. What do you have?”<br/>
There was a beat of silence before Anna replied.</p><p>“Transfiguration. What do you have?”</p><p>Hewlett managed a small smile before shrugging. “A free period, luckily. I am trying to set up a viewing for a certain star alignment at the weekend, you are more than welcome to- what am I saying, you need to get to your lesson. I shall see you around!” He gave a sort-of bow wave before setting off at a fast pace in the opposite direction.</p><p>Anna was left standing in the courtyard by herself for a minute or so, wondering what exactly just happened.</p><p>~*~</p><p>“Annie, Annie, Annie. You have so many admirers!” Peggy laughed in delight, swinging her legs over the side of her bed.</p><p>“They’re not admirers! They’re- I don’t know what they are, but one’s creepy and the other’s just a bit odd. I probably won’t see them again.” Anna replied, exasperated. Simcoe, she definitely didn’t want to see again. He was unnerving and there was something definitely off about him, but she wasn’t sure what. “And don’t call me Annie. Caleb is an awful influence.”</p><p>“Okay, so Simcoe’s definitely off the ‘I would’ list. What about Hewlett?” Peggy glanced over her nails at Anna, narrowing her eyes and ignoring the comment on her name.</p><p>“What about him? I’ve talked to him once and he practically ran away from me, after ‘valiantly defending’ me and drying my books.” She replied dryly, flicking through her transfiguration book.</p><p>“John knows him. My John, not creepy John. He’s kind of a huge nerd. Doesn’t get out much and doesn’t have many friends, but the teachers love him and he spends most of his time in the astronomy tower.” She grinned and rested her chin on her hand. “I talked to him once, he was a bit hard to get talking but wow, once he saw my star chart we couldn’t get him to shut up.” </p><p>“Can we just drop this? I’m not looking to date anyone so please stop trying to set me up.”</p><p>“Okay, okay, fine. Anyway, about John,”</p><p>Anna tuned out of the conversation when Peggy started talking about her sort of boyfriend, concentrating instead on her book before her mind drifted and she ended up falling asleep early, the events of the afternoon fresh in her mind.</p>
