<hr/><p> </p><p>I was reviewing WizardGirl on "War Song" which is uploaded to FF.net and it gave me an <em>idea/vision/could-be-fanon-for-this-fic</em> for an add-on/omake type thing.</p><p> </p><p> I don’t know if it meshes with your [<em>WizardGirl's</em>] vision of Harry or not: So, canon!hp is sensitive and a good listener right? And I sort of imagine - after puberty and growing a little more than canon - that god!hp is as well. But also different in the way he wouldn’t give you what you wanted to here but what you needed?</p><p>So, imagine: Hp, when Chiron or the councillors aren’t available, becomes the sorta go too camp councillor.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>It started a little more public at first <em>(of course</em>) - usually when public arguments get out of hand and Hp just comes in to: (all three at once)</p><p>1 beat some sense into them,</p><p>2 yell (beat) some harsh truths into their skulls, and</p><p>3 call it training (I’m assuming he drags them off to the training arena - unless he's too pissed off...).</p><p> </p><p>So Hp solves a few problems loudly, publicly, and humiliatingly:</p><p>“If you want to drag your fucking issues out in <em>public</em>, you better fucking believe their going to be <em>sorted</em> out in public you dipshits!”</p><p>And</p><p>“No one <em>else</em> here deserves to be treated with your fucking <em>angst</em> - so if you bring it out it’s <em>free fucking game</em>!”</p><p>... eventually the year-round campers learn <em>not</em> to bring their shit out in public, it’s less humiliating <em>and</em> less likely to earn them bruises.</p><p>(It's amusing to watch the summer/new campers take forever to learn this though).</p><p> </p><p>And then you get the small kids who gather enough courage (are too intimidated to turn to Chiron, aren’t comfortable with their cabin councillor, and don't even <em>think</em> about Mr. D) to talk to Hp (this is mostly helped by Teddy, naturally). Eventually word spreads <em>quietly</em> amongst the other demi-gods that Hp doesn’t give a shit whether or not you come to him and, <em>get this</em>, actually gives pretty good advice. Not to mention he actually <em>listens</em> to what you have to say.</p><p> </p><p>Terrified about this new situation? Feeling betrayed by your godly parent who hasn’t got off their arse to claim you? Problems with your powers/afraid of your powers? Considered weak and/or useless?<em> No problems</em>, Hp will help train you personally (<em>in </em>your<em> free time</em>), bitch about the idiocy of the gods without fear (<em>and sometimes explain that the ‘darker and/or older’ divine beings learnt that claiming their children only made them a target...)</em>, help you face your fear (<em>whether you want to or not</em>), and tell you all the ways you can fuck shit up under your own power (<em>you better hope it’s this and not designing you a personal -</em>terrifying<em>- training program to make you </em>stop<em> being useless</em>).</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>I don’t really know what effect it would have on canon, but you get the jist...</p></div>
