    <p>Scream.</p><p>All he could do is scream.</p><p>This was punishment.</p><p>Not for him, but his father's.</p><p>He knew it was coming, but not like this.</p><p>
  <em>NEVER LIKE THIS!</em>

</p><p>
  <em>Make it stop!</em>

  <em>Can't-!</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Fenrir licks his lips, fingers caressing the soft flesh underneath him.

<hr/><p>Feet stomp on wooden floors. A pair of hands tie long platinum-blonde hair into a messy bun. </p><p>Draco Malfoy stops before the couch. It's occupant snoring in the nude. "Fenrir."</p><p>The man grunts.</p><p>"We're out of meat."</p><p>He grunts again.</p><p>"Go hunt."</p><p>Fenrir opens an eye, sharp teeth smiling at the younger man. "Do I get anything in return?" He fondles his balls.</p><p>Draco raises a brow. "You get to sleep in the bed."</p><p>Fenrir snarls. "I want to fuck you."</p><p>"And get me pregnant again. No." Draco turns on a dime, "Get us food."</p><p>"I'll use a <em>condom</em> this time!" He speaks the word as though it stung him.</p><p>Draco stops and smirks at the older man. "You have two hours before the kids come back." He continues to head towards the kitchen. Without looking, Draco can hear Fenrir running out the door and take to his wolf form. The front door closes just as it opens.</p><p>Draco went through letters, text messages, and emails as he sat at the dining table. His home was a humble, not as luxurious as the Malfoy Manor and not so small to be called a shack. The house was mostly made of wood along with everything in the house. This was because the children made a habit of scratching and breaking almost anything delicate and expensive. Wood was the safest route without paying for constant replacements. </p><p>Their wooden mansion was located in Tongass, Alaska. The most protected werewolf community in the world. When Draco had the children, he wanted a safe place for his offspring. A place he can call home, use magic freely, and tend to his werewolf needs. </p><p>It was hard at first, as such a place didn't exist on European soil. Witches and Wizards alike had always shunned his kind. His father no longer acknowledges him and his mother sends him a weekly owl and gifts for the children during holidays but never visits. Not even a floo.</p><p>And it turns out that even friends are temporary.</p><p>As much Wizarding Britain was his past, Alaska was his present and future with his family. Prejudice against werewolves is... more tolerable. It had more to deal with werewolves killing humans and humans religiously believing werewolves are evil. Schooling was fair as the professors here are willing to teach the pups with loyalty and full responsibility. Not to mention, the next generation of children are starting to adore werewolves <em>and</em> vampires.</p><p><em>Americans are weird</em>. Draco thought as he reread the Werewolf Public Service Announcement.</p><p>The front door opens.</p><p>Draco sniffs and smirks. "Had any trouble?"</p><p>Fenrir walks around the door frame, biting the buck's head in one hand as he drags the rest of the deer into the kitchen with the other. "Ran inta' Charlie."</p><p>Draco lifts a brow.</p><p>"His pack is a little concerned, but nothing they can't handle."</p><p>"Bears?"</p><p>Fenrir drops the head in the kitchen sink and strolls into the dining room. The blood covering Fenrir's face and chest got Draco fidgeting. The smell of blood, the arousal of his mate, all so intoxicating. Fenrir knew this, can smell it on Draco as he strokes himself. "Big ones." He leans over the table and sniffs his mate, licking his neck with his blood-covered tongue.</p><p>"They have been marking their territory in ours." Draco licks his lips, the taste of blood was so close. "Alpha..."</p><p>Fenrir growls.</p><p>"You have an hour left..."</p><p>Fenrir doesn't hesitate as he yanks his pretty mate by the back of his nape and tosses him face-first into the table. With one hand he rips his pants off and lifts his hips higher for that perfect angle. He sloppily eats Draco's ass, blood and saliva smearing the pink pucker in between his cheeks. Tongue fucking him to work out those beautiful moans and whimpers from his pretty little mate.</p><p>"Accio condom." Draco grips the parchment and rips it open with his teeth. "Put it on." He shoves the rubber in Fenrir's hand. "NOW!"</p><p>Fenrir does, rolling the rubber to cover his large cock.</p><p>"Forty-five minutes..." Draco growls.</p><p>"Fuck off!" Fenrir thrusts straight in. Pulling out immediately and shoves back in. In and Out. In and Out. The sounds of slapping skin getting louder with each hard merciless thrust. Draco screams as he pushes back, lifting his hips as high as he could to get his mate deeper inside of him. The heat pooling in his stomach as the pain and pleasurable aches reaches up to his climax. "Mine. Mine. You're my bitch. You're my fucking whore. I'm gonna fill this pretty tight ass with my seed and watch you carry my pups! I want you pregnant and covered in blood n' cum. FUCK!" </p><p>"Fenrir! More! More!" </p><p>"Mine. Mine. Mine."</p><p>"Yes! Yes!" Draco's eyes roll back, panting. "I'm yours! Take me...take me..." </p><p>"Don't you dare cum without my permission!" He grips Draco's dick tightly, forcing his mate to yelp.</p><p>Draco whines, wanton. </p><p>Fenrir doesn't relent as he pounds harder into his mate. Faster. Harder. He can feel the table breaking at the legs.</p><p>"Fuck you! Ten minutes-!"</p><p>The table gives and Fenrir comes.</p><p>Draco screams his release.</p><p>They pant, sweety, sticky, and in absolute bliss.</p><p>Fenrir snuggles his mate, wrapping his arms around the man's waist. "You were right..."</p><p>"Huh?" Draco blinks to focus his thoughts.</p><p>"You were right. The wait was worth it."</p><p>"Three months without sex. I was beginning to believe you were fucking our food."</p><p>Fenrir growls and nips Draco's ear.</p><p>"Ow."</p><p>"Shut up, you love it."</p><p>Draco laughs. "Five minutes."</p><p>"Don't care."</p><p>"I do, and you broke the table."</p><p>"<strong>We</strong> broke the table." He corrects his mate.</p><p>"Three minutes. We should get rid of the smell before they come home."</p><p>"Keep the smell and I'll make dinner."</p><p>Draco looks over his shoulder into his mate's eyes. "Add in a blowjob and it's a deal."</p><p>Fenrir nuzzles his mate. "Deal." He removes himself from the inside of Draco, taking his time to enjoy watching the abused hole opening and closing. "God I want to fuck you again."</p><p>"After dinner." Draco nuzzles back as a promise.</p><p>A door knocks.</p><p>"That will be them."</p><p>"Right. Dinner." He leaves the dining room to go clean.</p><p>Draco eases his way to his feet and fixes the table with wandless magic. </p><p>Another door knocks.</p><p>"Coming!"</p><p>Draco walks to the front door and opens it. "How was the ki-?" Draco takes a deep breath at the figures at his door.</p><p>Standing in front of him were the three people he had least expect.</p><p>She was older than he remembered. Gone was the atrocious wavy hair, replaced by lovely long curls in a tight professional bun. A witch's business robes and shiny new heels Draco knew had to hurt her feet. "Hello, I'm Hermione Weasley." The woman was looking down at her papers. "I'm here for a werewolf by the name of..." She looks up, "...Atavus?" She was shocked at seeing him. Her eyes blown open wide, he can even smell the anxiety waving off her.</p><p>"<em>Malfoy</em>?" Behind her was the rest of the 'Golden trio'; the Weasel and Saint Harry fucking <em>Potter</em>. Just like their female companion, they looked older when he last saw them, the Weasel more than most. Potter looked just about the same but in need of a shave. Draco glimpse at their clothing and recognize the standard Auror uniform. </p><p>Draco snarls, territorial. "What you want?"</p><p>Draco doesn't have to look to know the males hand their wands out. Hermione, however, blushes and remains civil. "I'm here for Atavus. Do you know by chance where we can find them?"</p><p>Draco slams the door in their faces.</p><p>Rushing up the stairs, he ignores the door banging and looks for his mate. He follows the sound of running water and the smell of sandalwood and lemon soap. Draco enters the bathroom, seeing the older wolf working to get the blood off.</p><p>"Who was it?"</p><p>"Just some Ministry official and Aurors." He takes off his clothes and joins his mate in the shower. Sure he can use magic to be rid of the filth and cum, but that takes away the enjoyment of hot water. "Not to worry, I took care of it."</p><p>Fenrir stood back letting his mate inside the shower. "I heard the door slamming."</p><p>"I would like to avoid conflict."</p><p>Fenrir laughs, grabbing hold of his mate again. He wraps his large arms around his waist, slowly grinds his hips against that perk ass. "Mine."</p><p>"Fuck." Draco hisses, feeling his mate getting hard again. "It's a miracle we only have four children." He grinds back, wanting to feel his mate's cock again. Inside. Pumping. Throbbing. Hot.</p><p>"Bend over."</p><p>Draco does, hands gripping the metal railing.</p><p>Fenrir surprises Draco by washing his ass out, using the same rag he used. "You still had blood on you."</p><p>Draco blushes. "I forgot." His thought came to imagine what he must have looked like in front of those 'three'.</p><p>Fenrir grins. "I know. That's why I didn't say anything." He leans over his mate and bites into his neck. Rubbing his nose in his mate's pretty long hair. "I did say I wanted you covered in blood and cum."</p><p>Draco moans, whimpering at the gentle treatment his mate was giving him. "Shut up. You just want a blowjob."</p><p>"Three months is a long time."</p><p>"Fuck. Too long." Draco shoves him off and gets to his knees. He grips Fenrir by his shaft and licks his balls, rubbing his nose in the thick curls. He takes a deep breath off his masculine scent, drowning his senses in a deep thick fog of derive pleasure. Sticking out his tongue, he takes his mate deep in the back of the throat, stroking himself as he relaxed his throat more.</p><p>Fenrir growls, grabbing his mate with both hands as he proceeds to fuck his mouth. Long silky hair, bruised pink lips, flushed body by the hot water, tears falling from his eyes, stroking himself as he gazes deep into his eyes. Draco had years of practice, lots of practice. He doesn't bite, not even a single scrape. It gives Fenrir all the more encouragement to thrust even deeper.</p><p>Not at all like their first time...</p><p>Fenrir stops.</p><p>Draco leans back and detaches himself from his mate's cock. Frowning at what he saw. "You're soft..."</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>Draco blinks and glares up at his mate. He snarls, "I don't need fucking pity." He stands up and leaves, drying himself off. "We've been through this before."</p><p>"I'm-</p><p>"Apologize again and I will -!" Draco can feel his claws coming out, fur forming at the edges of his arms and legs. "Everyone is dead. I accepted what I am. You're my mate. My alpha. I don't need this shite when I'm trying to get off!" He takes a deep breath, easing his way from his wolf form. "Accio wand." His wand lands in his hand. He tries not to flinch of how unfamiliar his wand felt. He dries and dresses with a flick of his wand and leaves. "I'm getting the kids."</p><p>Draco takes the back entrance of the house, not wanting to see Potter and his tag-alongs. Seeing the trio brought back memories. Memories Draco had long forgiven after so many blame. Memories of long ago nightmares that no longer haunted him. Memories of renewed deep trusts and new companions after so many betrayals. Thoughts that no longer haunted him. All except for those endless apologies...</p><p>Two words he had come to loathe after repeating them so many times.</p><p>He had to teach his children how to <em>apologize</em> in different ways.</p><p>All to avoid those two words.</p><p>"Mommy!"</p><p>Bringing him out of his thoughts, Draco stops to see his four children running at him. he smiles, bending down to get tackled by his rowdy pups. The Omega of their pack, Lance Hamwey, jogs up nearly out of breath. "Forgive me Draco, they're faster than I thought."</p><p>"It's fine. As long as they're safe." Draco nods to him and smiles at each of his children, sniffing and nipping each one of them.</p><p>"Hey, mommy! I got an A in math!" Cissy Malfoy, his youngest with Draco's white hair and grey eyes. The little pup had always enjoyed putting flowers in her hair, smelling of flora and sweet candy with a pinch of her father's musk. "I got second place!" Her little accent sometimes tumbles between American and British.</p><p>"Did you? I'm very proud."</p><p>"Mum, when's dinner?" His third eldest, Geri Greyback, asked as he rubbed his stomach. </p><p>"Yeah, I'm starvin'!" Freki Malfoy agreed.</p><p>Geri and Freki were twins, and like most twins tend to get into trouble. Geri has Fenrir's bright blue eyes and Freki Draco's grey eyes. Both have coarse brown hair with a single strand of white hair on opposing sides. Both have their parents' accent but had a funny way of switching in and out of American slang. And true to their names, they have a constant appetite.</p><p>"Your father is cooking tonight."</p><p>"Yes!" The twins' high-five. </p><p>"Mum, I have a presentation due next Friday for Mrs. McGulligan, and I need help understanding Charms. I can't configure a healing and containment spell without the two rebounding." Fenris Greyback, named after his father, looks every much Draco in his younger years but with Fenrir's sharp jawline, blue eyes, and dark hair. He's dedicated to becoming a healer, finding ways to prove for his pack.</p><p>Looking at him reminds Draco how long ago he left home.</p><p>...Sixteen years.</p><p>Seventeen by next month.</p><p>"Have you tried healing inside containment?"</p><p>"<em>Inside</em>..? Aaah!" He rubs his head in frustration. "How can I be so stupid!? I've been struggling for days, and the answer was so simple."</p><p>"What's it for?"</p><p>He smiles, his canines noticeably larger than normal. "It's a surprise. I'll show you after the presentation, promise."</p><p>"As long you don't set the house on fire."</p><p>"That was that one time. Accident, I swear."</p><p>"Just try and be careful is all." Draco nuzzles him. "Now let's go home before your father forgets to cook."</p><p>"Race you there Geri."</p><p>"You're on Freki."</p><p>The twins take off.</p><p>"Wait for me!" Cissy runs after them.</p><p>Fenris picks Cissy up and runs with her in his arms. </p><p>Draco looks back at Lance. "You look tired."</p><p>"I'm not as young as I used to be." Lance, though an omega, was the oldest wolf in Alaska. None of the other packs had room for him, so when Draco needed a babysitter he would always call Lance. After months of trust and care, he became part of their pack. One would imagine Draco's surprise when he found out the man was a muggle. Tough muggle, the man could make deserts one swear was magic.</p><p>Draco pats his back. "I'm afraid not." They walk back together. "Any news?"</p><p>"Yeah. Longpaws drove the bears out of the territory. No one's hurt, thank god." He snaps his fingers. "There's also some British people-I think, came askin' around for Atavus. Know 'em?"</p><p>"Yes. Just ignore them and act you don't know what they're talking about. You know...be muggle."</p><p>Lance laughs. "Right."</p><p>"How are the others?"</p><p>"Ross is going through the cycle right now, making deliveries. Cinder- I don't know what's up with her. She has yet to text me. Also, there's a new pack in town. Led by a Witch going by the name of Frost."</p><p>"That makes seven packs in one place." Draco furrows his brows. "Anymore and we have to extend the barriers for more hunting grounds."</p><p>"Lester suggests extending business practices with more wizards. I quote, 'We might as well deal in with the black market if push comes to shove'. I tend to disagree."</p><p>"As do I."</p><p>"I can start a potion-making business. Produce by the masses and deliver. Potions is a perfect position for both political and financial standing."</p><p>"Where are you going with this..?"</p><p>"A wizarding business that can help purchase more land for werewolves."</p><p>"Why not a muggle business? We got to hit both ends right?"</p><p>"That's true."</p><p>"We could deal with food products."</p><p>"Real estate. Potion making, complete with personal delivery services on the Wizards' end. For muggles, we can deal with purchasing land and renting to farmers. This way we can spare resources and save money." Draco opens the back door to their home, sucking his teeth at the mud tracking across the kitchen. "Bloody urchins. Scourgify." The mud vanishes.</p><p>"Resources for what?" Lance stomps the mud off his boots before he enters the house.</p><p>"Making potions. You think dragon's blood and mermaid tears grow off of whomping willows?"</p><p>"I...have no idea what you just said. But I'm going to answer <em>no</em>." Lance closes the back door. "They don't."</p><p>"Right you are."</p><p>Lance walks over to the sink and picks off a piece of meat from the buck's head. "Mm. I can make Key Lime Pie for dessert."</p><p>"God please yes!" Draco leans back onto the counter. "I've been dying for some of your sweets."</p><p>"It's only been a day."</p><p>"A day too long. I'm already having withdraws."</p><p>Lance laughs. "With or without the cinnamon sticks?"</p><p>"With please. Before that, can you make sure Fenrir skins the animal right this time? Last time he cooked he forgot to bleed the bloody thing out."</p><p>Lance smirks as he left, "<em>I~</em> don't think that was a mistake." </p><p>"Course not." Draco mumbles. Sighing, Draco takes his seat at the bar. He stares longingly at the cabinet full of wine, knowing it was off-limits until another year. Needing something to do, he goes to check on his kids.</p><p>Heading upstairs, he passes three rooms until he comes up to Fenris' room. He sees the house elf Num-Nums standing guard nervously. "Forgive me Master Draco. Young Master Fenris wishes not to be disturbed and ask me to keep anyone from enterin'." Num-Nums was Fenris' personal house-elf. A gift from his mother during his oldest's third birthday.</p><p>Actually, he was the only house-elf.</p><p>The only house-elf that survived Fenrir's wrath.</p><p>Poor things.</p><p>"As long it's not impeding his health, it's fine."</p><p>"Of course Master Draco."</p><p>Draco leaves and moves across the hall where the twins share a room. Odd in Draco's opinion for fraternal twins, but they fought him on it and he caved. He looks on in disbelief, seeing the demolished and beheaded dolls wrapped up in... "Is that...<em>toilet paper</em>?"</p><p>The twins stop and stare at their mother. "Charlie cheated on her boyfriend, so she's being mummified." Freki clarified like it was a normal occurrence.</p><p>"And Steven on his wife, so he's getting beheaded and mummified." Geri shakes the doll for emphasis. </p><p>Stunned speechless, Draco just nods. "Don't forget to do your homework."</p><p>"Okay, mum!" The twins said in unison and went back to blackening out their eyes with markers.</p><p>For a moment Draco wondered where they got the dolls in the first place. "Better not to ask." He then stops at his youngest room, seeing Cissy playing Tea party with her stuff animals.</p><p>"Would you like some more Mr. Tumbly?" She mocks the bear's voice, "Yes please lady Cissy. Your tea is the most scrumptious."</p><p>Draco knocks, "You have room for one more?"</p><p>Cissy looks up with a smile. "Hi, Mommy! You can sit down next to Mrs. Rainbow." She points to her stuffed toy dragon.</p><p>Draco quickly plays the part, smiling at his daughter. "My, dear Lady Cissy, you're Tea Party is the finest party I've ever come to visit."</p><p>"Thanks, Mom- I mean, Mrs. Malfoy. Your compliment gives me great joy." Draco tries not to laugh at his six-year old's acting of adults. "Would you like some more tea?"</p><p>"Don't mind if I do?"</p><p> </p><p>With the buck already skinned and the intestines dumped in a bucket, Fenrir licks the knife before he goes to ripping the limbs with his bare hands.</p><p>"Greyback!"</p><p>Fenrir stops to look over his shoulder. He grins, "Chief! What brings you here?"</p><p>The Chief nods to Lance and goes to stand by Fenrir. He was a middle-aged Native man, an alpha to the Longpaw pack, standing a head shorter than Fenrir. He always wore the turquoise and beige choker necklace with the wolf's paw in the middle. The man never took it off, even when he turns. Fenrir could only guess it had something to do with the ancient magic tied to it. "Strange people came asking for Atavus." The man had this accent that confused Fenrir at first, a slow and steady speech that left no room for confusion. Every he spoke was deliberate and with purpose. A pearl of deeper wisdom hidden underneath the truth. <span>"Said, they needed help teaching their boy how to be a wolf."</span></p><p>Fenrir laughs. "Who doesn't?"</p><p>"Harry Potter was among them. Mentions he knew your mate."</p><p>Fenrir doesn't answer.</p><p>"There are times when we think our past are tracks one day to fade. When in truth they are our shadow. A reflection in a different form willed by our actions." There it is. Wisdom.</p><p>Fenrir rips a flank and wraps it in the skinned fur. "I'll speak to them. Have a round of alphas meet at The Point." He hands the wrapped meat and fur to the man. "For the wife."</p><p>The Chief smiles. "You spoil her more than I do."</p><p>They laugh, sharing an inside joke.</p><p>"Ahéhee'." The man thanks Fenrir, patting his back and nodding again to Lance as he leaves.</p><p> </p><p>Night comes around and Draco had the children wash up for dinner.</p><p>The front door opens with two people entering. "We're home!" A woman shouts.</p><p>"Aunt Cindy!" Cissy runs over to hug the woman.</p><p>"Hey there munch Kin-kins!" Cinder Sani picks Cissy up and gives her a well-deserved raspberry. She's a broad Nigerian-American woman, standing taller than Draco and just centimeters shorter than Fenrir. Short hair in the blackest color Draco has ever seen, and dark skin that looks caramel in the sunlight.  Long story short, she was going into Herbalism hoping to support herself and her family. She was bitten in Nigeria visiting her grandparents and fired when her boss found out. Pissed, she searches far and wide looking for a way to live and ran into Fenrir hoping to be part of a pack. Fenrir needed a beta, so he agreed to take her in. "I got something for ya'." Cinder plops a halo of flowers on her head. This time it was Gardenias and Peony.</p><p>Cinder was the real reason why Cissy loves flowers.</p><p>"Manners Cissy." Draco reminds her.</p><p>"Thank you, Aunty!" And she goes to kiss Cinder's cheek.</p><p>"You're very welcome Munch Kin-kins." She sets the child down and pats her to leave.</p><p>The man behind Cinder was the newest member of the pack. He was a bit shorter than Draco and kept mostly to himself. Probably around his twenties or thirties with a bushy beard and barely kept hair. Fenris had taken pity on the man when he found out his entire family was killed during a summer vacation hiking trip. They were in Nevada when his wife and two daughters were... eaten. Sunk in depression, and not wanting anyone else to suffer the same fate, the man journeyed North to grieve. He never gave his name, but the kids came to call him 'Lupin'.</p><p>Draco tries very hard not to remember his old Defense Against Dark Arts teacher. He focuses more on the orange juice in his cup. Watching Fenris doing his homework across the table, "Where's Ross?"</p><p>Cinder shakes her head. "That <em>yaro</em> said he's got one more delivery before he comes home." She walks over to sit next to Draco at the dinner table.</p><p>Draco frowns looking at her. "Why so late?"</p><p>Cinder shrugs, "Dunno, some weird client confidentiality." She whips out her phone and shows it to Draco.</p><p>Draco sneers reading the message, "That's a sorry excuse."</p><p>"He might be fucking that Canadian <em>yarinya</em> by the post office." She tucks her phone away.</p><p>Fenrir growls, "He knows better than to fuck outside the pack." He flips the seasoned meat in the frying pan. "If I get a single whiff off of him-" </p><p>"His ass is grass!" Geri and Freki finish.</p><p>"Language!" The adults scolded.</p><p>"Beta," Fenrir looks over his shoulder, "There's a meeting with the alphas at The Point."</p><p>She nods understanding, "I'll clear my schedule."</p><p>"Lupin, I want you to check out the new pack that settled in. Make sure they're not causing any trouble or marking territories." The silent man just nods.</p><p>Draco raises a brow. "When was this?"</p><p>Fenrir looks at his mate. "You didn't tell me the Potter kid was here."</p><p>Draco smiles into his cup, remembering slamming the door in their face.</p><p>"Harry Potter was here?!" Fenris shouts in excitement. He turns to Draco, "Why haven't I heard of this?"</p><p>Cinder laughs. "'Cause everyone 'ere knows you have a hard-on for the 'scar-head'."</p><p>"I do not! He's just the most famous wizard in all the world! He killed the Dark Lord! He died and came back to life! He found the Deathly Hallows! What I give to have an interview!"</p><p>"You're virginity, maybe?" Cinder laughs when Fenris tosses a crumpled paper ball.</p><p>"No, throwing things at the dinner table!" Draco glared.</p><p>Fenris flinch, going straight back to his work.</p><p>"Ugh! I'm starving!" Freki complains.</p><p>"Me too!" Geri not far behind his twin.</p><p>Cissy watches Lance moving in the kitchen. "Is uncle Lance making dur'zert?" </p><p>"Hell yeah!"</p><p>"Fuck yes!"</p><p>Draco growls, pointing his wand at the twins. "Another bad word from either one of you two and you'll both be tasting soap for the rest of the week."</p><p>The twins cover their mouths in horror.</p><p>Fenrir grabs his plate and piles large amounts of food on it. "Dinner's done! Come serve yourselves you lazy fucks!"</p><p>In true wolf hierarchy fashion, the alpha is the first to eat. Next was the beta Cinder, then Draco, Fenris, Lupin, the twins, Cissy, and finally the omega Lance. All sat at the table and dined. Sharing jokes and mocking others for their actions. Fenris had to shield his plate from the twins trying to steal his meat. Cissy kept asking for vegetables until there wasn't anymore. Soon, Lance brought out the dessert of Key Lime pie. Extra cinnamon sticks for Draco, and whipped cream for everyone else.</p><p>With bellies full and several yawns, it was time for bed.</p><p>"Time to wash up!" Draco ordered the children. "Come."</p><p>The twins raced up the stairs, taking both the first and second bathrooms. Fenris sighs, <span>not bothering to wait for the twins to finish bathing he </span><span>waves his wand to clean and dress in fresh pajamas. Draco took Cissy to his and Fenrir's shared bathroom. The six-year-old looking very tired on her two feet, rubbing her eyes and slowly nodding off.</span></p><p>After the bath and brushing her teeth, Draco tucks her in. He kisses her forehead and tucks all her favorite stuffed animals in the blankets with her. He leaves the door ajar and checks in on the twins. Both were in their beds doing...</p><p>"You're just now doing your homework?" Draco spoke in a stern voice.</p><p>The twins try to hide their paper. "No." They both replied.</p><p>Draco glares, "You better be up on time."</p><p>"We will!" And they go back to studying.</p><p>Draco sighs closing their door. Next was his oldest. He knocks and waits.</p><p>Fenris opens the door slightly. "I going to be up a bit."</p><p>"Your project?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Don't wake your siblings."</p><p>Fenris had a curious look on his face. "Wouldn't that be the other way around."</p><p>Draco blushes. "You little-</p><p>"Love-you-good-night!" Fenris shuts the door.</p><p>"You better be up on time!"</p><p>"Silencing charm!"</p><p>Draco blushes a bit brighter. "Not a very good one if you can still hear me."</p><p>Satisfied he walks to his bedroom and proceeds to undress. He turns the water faucet on.</p><p>He feels his mate fondle his rear. "Someone owes me a blowjob."</p><p>"You're still not sleeping in the bed."</p><p>"I'm not shaving."</p><p>Draco shrugs. "You shave or you don't. You're choice, but you're not sleeping in the bed until you do." He turns around and kisses his mate, tugging at the scraggly beard. </p><p>"I've already fixed my teeth," he licks his pearly white sharp teeth, "trimmed my hair, and take baths whenever I smell. Now, you want me to shave."</p><p>"Just the face." He gives Fenrir's left nipple attention, gently nibbling and licking the appendage. "I'm not asking you to take a waxing. Though you are in desperate need of one."</p><p>Fenrir drags Draco in the shower with him. "If I were to shave?" He goes for Draco's neck, leaving marks.</p><p>Draco groans feeling Fenrir's shaft growing hard between their bodies. The warm water lubricating the friction. "You can grow...ah-! better one. Alpha..."</p><p>"On your knees." He commanded. </p><p>Draco gets to his knees. Slowly he works the thick hot meat, lapping only the tip to tease his mate to perfect hardness. The scent of his mate's musk drives him to work faster, his own erection begging for attention. </p><p>"Swallow."</p><p>And Draco does. Sticking out his tongue and relaxing his throat, he takes Fenrir all the way down to the base. The scent -God the scent! It makes him want to fuck. He moans, feeling himself tipping over the edge.</p><p>"Make yourself cum."</p><p>Draco goes for his penis.</p><p>"Rear only."</p><p>Switching quickly, Draco lifts one leg for a better angle and fingers his opening. He can feel his mate grip the back of his nape and proceed to slowly fuck his throat. It was shallow like thrusts which Draco realized Fenrir wouldn't let go until he came first. He digs deeper into his anal canal, doing all he can to come from just his fingers alone. </p><p>Fenrir laughs. "Remember that night the twins were conceived?" Draco moans. "How I stuffed my entire hand in your tight cunt? How you begged me to not stop even when you started bleeding." Draco shivers, digging deeper inside himself. "How you cried, moan, howl my name. Fuck. It was the damn-est thing I have ever seen." He starts picking up his speed... "But not as much as I fucked you afterward."</p><p>Draco hoves his finger faster in and out, thinking of that night. How the entire room smelled of sex and blood after days of pure fucking. Fenrir constantly ramming into him. The full moon days away. Claw marks. Blood. So much BLOOD!</p><p>He comes.</p><p>Fenrir rips him off his cock.</p><p>"AAAAAAaaaahh!" Draco grabs for his mate, gulping down fresh air. "Alpha...Alpha...alpha...alpha..."</p><p>Fenrir pets Draco, watching his pretty mate's eyes fog over with sex. He bends down and kisses him, tongue fucking him as his mate still struggles for breath. He pulls back groaning. "I want another pup."</p><p>"No."</p><p>Well, guess he wasn't that far gone. "I'll bargain."</p><p>Draco looks up curiously. "You shave."</p><p>"Done."</p><p>"<em>And</em> we go to see my parents."</p><p>Fenrir flips his mate over.</p><p>"Swear on it! Damn it!" Draco moans as Fenrir lines his cock with his entry. He so badly wants to push back.</p><p>"I'll shave, you have more <em>pups</em>, and we'll see your family <em>with</em> the pack." Fenrir holds himself over Draco, waiting for his answer.</p><p>Draco tries to pierce himself on his alpha's shaft, but the man pulls back. Draco whines, "Two and no more."</p><p>Fenrir growls, happily. He thrusts.</p><p>"Ah! Fuck yes!" Draco pushes back. "Alpha, more. I want more!"</p><p>"I knew you were a slut for my cock! All you want is my shaft to fill you up!" Fenrir fucks his mate into the bathtub's floor. The sound of flesh slapping against flesh as the water gets them slippery.</p><p>"Yeeees!"</p><p>"You're going to carry my pups?" He growls in his ear.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>"Want me to full you with my seed?"</p><p>"YES! Fuck! Yes! Take me- take me-! Alpha!"</p><p>Fenrir comes with one last thrust.</p><p>Draco moans as he comes, falling silent, content against the porcelain surface and tangled soaked hair. His mate lays on top of him, still buried deep inside with his rear riddled with semen.</p><p>"Three months is too long." Fenrir licks his neck.</p><p>"Absolutely." Draco barely mumbles.</p>
