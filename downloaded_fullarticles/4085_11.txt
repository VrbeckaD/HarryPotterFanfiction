  <em> Meet me at our old place. </em>
</p><p>Remus reread the most recent text his ex had sent this morning. He looked up to read the fading letters of the coffee shop. Remus blinked, fighting off painful memories. He hadn’t stepped foot in there for months. But with just a glance at the blooming sunflowers, the smell of freshly brewed coffee, the darkened floor to floor windows, the old little gate in front; and the past possessed his entire being. Instead of the yellow flowers underneath the windows, he saw strong fingers plucking one from its roots and tucking it behind his ear. Instead of freshly brewed coffee, he smelled woodsy cologne and midnight nail polish. Instead of the vacant seats behind the dark window, he saw two men sitting. Laughing. And instead of a locked gate, he saw a man holding it open for him.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he opened the gate himself, began walking forward, and entered the shop, the tinkle of a bell announcing his entrance. Keeping his head down, he walked quickly past the counter, to the back door where he found their old place.</p><p>It was exactly the same as it had been the last time. But it was so different.</p><p>Fallen leaves scattered the small patio, the yellows and deep reds and burnt oranges adding color to the peeling fence and the rustic tables.</p><p>No one was there.</p><p>His heart squeezed and his fingers trembled as he typed a quick response.</p><p>
  <em> I’m here. </em>
</p><p>He got a reply immediately.</p><p>
  <em> Shit. Alarm never went off. I’ll be there in 5. Please don’t leave. </em>
</p><p>Remus checked his watch.</p><p>1:17pm.</p><p>Who the fuck slept past noon on a Monday?</p><p>He should’ve known something like this would’ve happened. It always does. The bastard asks for something and never follows through himself. Whether it was arriving late at dates <em> he </em>had planned or forgetting anniversaries. It was always something.</p><p>1:22pm. Five minutes later and nothing. Had he really been such a sodding idiot to believe <em> he </em> would stick to his word?</p><p>1:27pm. Nothing. Remus stopped pacing and kicked over a chair in anger. Anger at himself for not knowing better. For having this stupid hope inside him whenever it came to him.</p><p>Hope.</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>Scowling at everything in sight, Remus ran through all the scenarios in his head. Arriving back at his flat ten minutes after he had left, Lily firing question after question. It would be humiliating. Or maybe bumping into <em> him </em>and James at some party that was bound to happen, and hearing about how bloody fantastic he’s been. Why did he have to hope when there was nothing left to stay for? No one saying, “I made a mistake - give me a second chance. I love you.” Hope is for the fools who dare to dream, to extend that vulnerable part of themselves and blindly give it to someone.</p><p>A growl escaped his throat as he yanked open the door back inside the cafe just as someone pulled it on their end. Remus’s head snapped up just in time to see Sirius staring at him with wide eyes, his hand on the door handle.</p><p>Remus released the door with a huff to let Sirius through.</p><p>“I’m so sorry I’m late. I set the fucking alarm for the wrong time.” A nervous laugh.</p><p>“Yeah. I got that. It’s fine,” he said dismissively. Running a hand through his disheveled golden hair, Remus gestured to the nearest table. “Shall we?”</p><p>They sat down on the rusting chairs, avoiding each other's’ gaze as soon as they settle in.</p><p>“Did you, er… did you want coffee? Tea?” Remus never heard Sirius stutter before.</p><p>“I’m fine. Thanks.”</p><p>A tense silence followed. Sirius played with his rings under the table, biting his lip anxiously as the other man bit his nails (a nasty habit). The only tangible sound was that of the distant calling of names inside the coffee shop and the occasional bird call. Remus finally broke the quiet and stared down at him hardly.</p><p>“Why did you want to meet with me? After not talking for, what was it? Five months?”</p><p>“I didn’t think you’d want to talk to me after everything that happened.”</p><p><br/> “Bullshit.”</p><p><br/> “Come on, Re - ”</p><p>“Don’t fucking call me that. Ever.”</p><p>Sirius leaned back with wide eyes, hurt painted across his shadowed face. It was as if Remus had slapped him, but the blow was much worse. Deadly, even. he stared at the man he used to be in love with; the man he snuggled with on late Sunday mornings, the man he kissed endless amounts of times in thousands of places, the man with whom he shared sundaes and hot chocolate. The man who he stayed up all night with when night terrors struck. The man who, six months ago, he thought to be the person he would spend forever with.</p><p>And all that had vanished into… meer memories. It was now a chasm of “remember when’s” and drunk nights trying to forget the reel of movies that they had created.</p><p>Now, the man that sat before him was cold and hard. Not a sliver of the witty, all consuming person he fell in love with. Only calculating eyes, an unshaven jaw, and a permanent frown. He was entirely… closed off.</p><p>And it was all Sirius’s fault.</p>
