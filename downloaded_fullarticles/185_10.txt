    <p>“From the man with the blue jacket.” The bartender slid the drink towards her, winking before quickly busying himself with a very used rag, scrubbing the bar balcony as he had been doing for the past hour, subtly glancing her at every opportunity; that is, when he wasn’t fixing free drinks for her. She was pretty sure half of the bar had, at least, already attempted to send her something.</p><p>She didn’t bother to glance at the man who paid her the Apple Martini. She softly swirled the glass with her fingers before taking a sip from it. She decided she’d keep it when she felt the sweet flavor dance inside her mouth. A loud cheer was heard and she couldn’t be sure, obviously, but would bet her new Jimmy Choos that it had come from the man. He must have been watching her reject the majority of the drinks sent to her over the last sixty minutes.</p><p>She could care less, though. Between the very-eager-to-please-men and the fool-no-one-bartender, she started to wonder why she’d thought coming to a muggle bar was such a great idea. One would think her thrall would be weaker in muggles. One couldn’t be more mistaken. Just like wizards, they were the same drooling idiots. And one of them was making his way over her that exact moment. She eyed him sideways. Blue jacket. She groaned to herself. The Apple Martini wasn’t even that good.</p><p>“Excus-”</p><p>One icily glare was enough, thankfully. She raised an eyebrow and stared him down until the color disappeared from the man’s face and he mumbled apologies at her. </p><p>She flipped her hair with a huff and turned back to her original position as he all but stumbled out of her sight. The man almost managed to utter a whole word; she had to give him some credit. Most of them just seemed to lose the ability to talk altogether when facing her. She then proceeded to sulk; grumbling inaudibly about how hard could be having some time for herself.</p><p>“Fleur…?”</p><p>She snapped her head to the side when she heard the familiar voice.</p><p> “Hermione,” She smiled more out of manners and anything else. Here she was, assuming the only ones that could possibly disturb her solitude moment were muggles.</p><p>“I didn’t expect to find you here…”</p><p><em>Likewise</em>, she scorned in her head.  </p><p>Hermione shifted from one foot to another, clearly uncertain of what to do next. Perhaps Fleur was disturbing her solitude moment too? She looked into deep pools of chocolate before deciding not make the situation any more uncomfortable than it already was.</p><p>“Would you like to join me?” She pointed to the empty stool beside her.</p><p>“I…” Hermione hesitated. Fleur wondered for a second if, should she pay attention, she’d hear the gears and engines running inside the brunette’ brain. “Yes, why not?”</p><p><em>Why not indeed.</em> The blonde noted, quite aware that Hermione hadn’t found a plausible excuse to refuse her invitation.</p><p>“Care for a drink? It’s on me.” <em>Or well, almost</em>.<em>  </em>Fleur motioned to the aligned glasses she had decided to keep.</p><p> “Thank you.” The brunette took a reddish drink with tentative fingers.</p><p>Hermione didn’t comment on the reason she had such amount of alcohol before her, and for that she was grateful. The woman just sipped the cosmopolitan quietly, her eyes trained on the glass.</p><p>“How is life treating you?” Fleur asked out of a sense of duty. They weren’t family anymore, <em>per se</em>… but had been for quite a while. Also, Hermione would still visit the Weasley’s from time to time. One might think her and Ron’s break up would be an inconvenience, but not for the oh-so-mature Hermione Granger. How many times had she heard that word leave Molly Weasley’s mouth? You never should have let her go, Ronald Weasley, she’d say. When you’ll find such an intelligent, nice and <em>mature</em> girl like her again, Ronald Weasley?</p><p>If she weren’t (it pained her to even think of it) jealous of the woman, she’d pity the poor redhead. But she wasn’t immune to the eventual pangs of jealousy. Even after breaking her youngest son’s heart, Molly was still greatly devoted to the brunette. And even after four years being married to her oldest son, the woman would still watch Fleur warily, as if expecting her to make a mistake, to say something wrong. Not that it matter, anyway. Not anymore.</p><p>“I can’t complain,” Hermione answered, breaking her train of thought. The brunette didn’t look up, apparently finding the cherry on the bottom of the glass far more interesting. “Yours?”</p><p>“Oh… you know…” Fleur trailed off, her airy tone seeming artificial even in her own ears.</p><p>She berated herself inside her head. How hard could it be saying <em>“Great, thank you”</em>?</p><p> “How is Bill?” The brunette asked in what Fleur thought to be an attempt to break the ice. She couldn’t possibly know that there wasn’t any worst subject at the moment, right?</p><p>“Same old, same old,” She murmured, tracing her fingers around the rim of her Apple Martini glass, finding herself abhorring apples.</p><p>Hermione tilted her head in acknowledgement before resuming her action to stare intently at her drink.</p><p>“You visit muggle bars a lot?” Fleur asked after a minute. She had just felt compelled to say something… anything ought to be better than awkward silence.</p><p>“I suppose,” Hermione shrugged.  “They’re great places to let off some steam.”</p><p>Fleur hummed understandingly. For a muggle-born it made a lot of sense to go collect their thoughts in a muggle bar. For a veela, on the other hand…</p><p>“I’ve never entered this place, though. There is a pub one block away that has the best margaritas,” Hermione continued softly.</p><p>Fleur released a somehow relieved breath. The brunette wouldn’t pry away her reasons or her presence there - which was, admittedly, a little strange. For what Fleur had grasped of her, she’d always been quite curious, that woman.</p><p>“I’ve never took you for a margarita kind of girl,” The blonde quipped, eagerly taking whatever chance she got to fly further and further away from dangerous subjects.</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione raised an eyebrow, amused. “What have you taken me for, Fleur?”</p><p>“Hm…” The blonde tapped her own chin. “I’d say white wine kind of girl.”</p><p>Hermione snorted.</p><p>“White wine sounds awfully like you.”</p><p>Fleur smiled her first genuine smile of the night.</p><p>“It does, doesn’t it?”</p><p>Hermione chuckled.</p><p>They fell silent again, but for Fleur’s bewilderment, it was neither awkward nor uncomfortable. She gave up finishing the damn martini before placing her first order of the night.</p><p>“Well… you were right!” Fleur justified herself when she felt Hermione’s curious gaze upon her.</p><p>“So it seems,” The brunette said with a grin.</p><p>The blonde hided her smirk with her glass of white wine.</p><p>“I don’t, you know…” Fleur caught herself making conversation… again. “Usually come to muggle places.”</p><p>“I see,” Hermione wasn’t going to ask, that much was very clear for the veela already. But maybe it was that inquisitive glint in her eyes… Fleur just answered anyway. </p><p>“I wanted to conduct an experiment,” She chuckled. There was a slight chance the alcohol she consumed had started to get into her system. “A social experiment.”</p><p>“Perhaps I could help? Have you assessed your results yet?” The brunette seemed too amused, and Fleur could only hope it wasn’t on her expense.</p><p>“Oh, ‘Ermione, let me walk you through it first so we can make the best out of your ‘elp, oui?” Fleur drawled, her French accent slipping easily into the words as her tongue was embraced by a comforting alcohol-induced dullness.</p><p>“Fair enough,” Hermione smiled and propped her elbow on the balcony, supporting her head on her palm.</p><p>“I ‘ave zis problem…sometimes I don’t want to be bother by ze effects of my thrall in others,” She mimicked the woman’s position, leaning close as if she was revealing a secret. “And I assumed it would not ‘ave ze same effect if I was surrounded by muggles. So I ended up ‘ere, eager to put my theory to proof… ” Fleur tucked a lock of blonde hair that insisted to fell in front of her eyes behind her ear. She then brought her glass to her lips, deliberately swallowing its contents. She watched Hermione’s eyes follow her movements, resting upon her lips for a second.</p><p>The brunette shook her head once before chuckling softly.</p><p>“Have you reached a conclusion?”</p><p>“I believe you already know zat answer,” She sighed, pointing to the still untouched drinks again.</p><p> “Well, I’ll have to trust that my assumptions skills can discern as much,” Hermione finished her cosmopolitan and, before she could ask for something else, Fleur handed her another drink.</p><p>“I shouldn’t,” Hermione started, eyeing hesitantly at the glass.</p><p>Fleur waved the protest off, “Everything will most likely go to waste if ‘ou don’t ‘elp me.”</p><p>The brunette still didn’t seem very certain as she accepted the second drink.</p><p>“I’m sure your admirers didn’t see how wonderfully sending you drinks could backfire,” Hermione smirked.</p><p>“Nonsense. Zey paid for an attractive woman to drink. I’d say zey accomplished zeir goal, non?”</p><p>“That must be the most self-centered compliment everyone has ever paid me,” Hermione laughed amicably, her cheeks tinged with pink. “But I do think said admirers would beg to differ.”</p><p>Fleur scoffed.</p><p> “Don’t be silly, ‘Ermione.”</p><p>“I’m really not,” Hermione answered matter-of-factly, shrugging.</p><p>Fleur straightened her back. If she were to read between the lines, sure she’d find praise there. She didn’t expect to feel the heat spreading across her cheeks and neck at the mere notion of it. People praised her for her looks all the time. Why would this one be different?</p><p>“It’s mostly ze thrall to blame. Without it-”</p><p> “Now you are just fishing for a compliment,” The brunette interrupted her and smiled.</p><p> “I’m most certainly not!” She huffed with feign offence, her mouth hanging open mockingly.</p><p>“Right,” Hermione chuckled.</p><p>“I am not!” She insisted forcefully, trying to suppress the smile that was threatening to break across her face, because yes… maybe she was. Not that she was going to admit it in the near future. Or ever.</p><p>This time the woman just smirked with a sparkle in eyes, as if she could see right through Fleur, who fought the urge to lower her gaze to her own hands. They faced each other silently and unblinkingly for several seconds, until the peculiar sound of glass breaking somewhere behind them pulled the blonde back to reality.</p><p>Fleur cleared her throat, not having expected to share such an intense moment with anybody in that bar, let alone Hermione. “So, are you one of Ginny’s maid of ‘onor?” She blurted out the first random question that came to her mind. Not one of her finest moments, she admitted it.</p><p>“Yes,” Hermione rolled her eyes. “Luna and I.”</p><p>Fleur chuckled.</p><p>“You don’t seem very excited.”</p><p>“That’s because I’m not,” The brunette answered automatically before stopping dead on her tracks for a second and abruptly turning her neck to look around the place. Once her inspection was completed, she faced Fleur again, giving her a pointed look.</p><p>“I am not telling,” She assured, but her smile was definitely impish. Well, she wasn’t about to spill her guts, but there was no problem in having some fun.</p><p>Hermione narrowed her eyes at Fleur, scrutinizing her carefully.</p><p>“You wouldn’t,” The brunette decided with a nod, apparently saying more to herself than to her. “Not if you like your pretty head attached to your neck,” Hermione added the threat a second latter.</p><p>Fleur laughed at that, catching herself by surprise at how carefree it has sounded. Now, how long has it been since she had laughed like that?</p><p>“One would zink a girl would be excited to play such an important role in her best friends’ wedding,” Fleur teased.</p><p>“I was at first,” Hermione sighed. “Now it got tiring. Ginny and Mrs.Weasley planning a wedding together is almost a recipe for disaster, they don’t seem to agree with anything. And Harry is freaking out every now and then at the possibility that Ginny will not want to go through with the wedding. As if!” Hermione scoffed. “She’s too busy trying to drive me and everyone else around her insane to even think about calling off the whole deal.”</p><p> “Zat sounds so much like fun!” Fleur laughed, giving the woman a playful smile.</p><p>“I just try to stay away from the crossfire, really,” The brunette deadpanned.</p><p>The blonde giggled.</p><p>“I know well ‘ow Weasley women behave at weddings,” Fleur tried to sympathize, but immediately regretted it. The bitter taste that started in the pit of her stomach rose up to her throat, and she had to swallow the imaginary lump down again to avoid vomiting right there; or to avoid screaming and throwing the nearest object to the ground. Rather likely to avoid the screaming thing.</p><p>Once again brown eyes that seemed to know everything, including what Fleur was thinking, rested upon her distressed blue ones. Hermione smiled softly and that was just too much to bear. She didn’t want any of that; the assumptions, the pity.</p><p>She wasn’t to be pitied! And hated every second she had to endure the charade any longer.</p><p>Fleur, against her better judgment, ordered another glass of wine. But right now, the numbness the alcohol provided was helping a great deal to keep her inner veela at bay. The rage inside her was boiling and if she didn’t manage it right, a very unpleasant side of her would make an appearance. And that was the last thing she needed there, surrounded by muggles and…well, Hermione. That somehow mattered.</p><p>“I’m sure you do,” The brunette whispered after a second and followed Fleur’s lead, ordering herself a margarita.</p><p>“You really are a margarita kind of girl, aren’t you?” Fleur giggled.</p><p>Hermione raised an eyebrow, but said nothing.</p><p>“My date was supposed to meet me here one hour ago,” The brunette confessed out of the blue.</p><p>Fleur gaped in surprise at the abrupt turn of events.</p><p>“Ze nerve of zat person! ‘Ow could a wizard stood you up?” She scoffed.</p><p>“It’s a muggle,” Hermione shrugged and smirked.</p><p> “Well! It’s ‘is lost. You are a delight!” She announced loudly for the whole bar to hear, glaring around.</p><p>Hermione blushed and hide behind her hands when a few heads turned, but a second later she was laughing.</p><p>“And you are drunk!”</p><p>“Poprosterous!” Fleur huffed and flipped her hair, even though she was, indeed, very much drunk.</p><p>“<em>Preposterous</em> you mean?”</p><p>“That’s what I said.”</p><p>“Sure,” Hermione chuckled.</p><p>“But seriously, zis guy is a ‘uge idiot,” Fleur insisted.</p><p>“It’s ok. I’m just hungry, though. We were supposed to eat afterwards,” Hermione grabbed her purse to pay for her margarita, and looked at Fleur after seeming to contemplate for a moment. “Want to grab some late dinner?</p><p>Fleur really thought about that for a moment, but after her little and sudden outburst she just felt silly.  She enjoyed Hermione’s company a lot… but just how much more tiptoeing around sensitive subjects was she up for the night?</p><p>“Maybe some other time, oui?” She smiled.</p><p>Hermione smiled back and nodded, rising from the stool.</p><p>“It was nice meeting you,” She stood awkwardly besides the blonde, who also rose on her feet after a second.</p><p>“You too,” Fleur answered honestly, leaning in to kiss Hermione’s cheek, but ending up catching more air than skin.</p><p>The brunette smiled one last time before heading towards the door. She just took two steps before turning her head and saying behind her shoulder:</p><p>“Oh, and Fleur… for future reference? I drink red wine.”</p>
