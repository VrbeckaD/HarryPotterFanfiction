    <p>
  <span>Ottery St. Catchpole, the magical community made up of modest family homes like </span>
  <em>
    <span>The Burrow</span>
  </em>
  <span> and more impressive estates like </span>
  <em>
    <span>Winterfell </span>
  </em>
  <span>and </span>
  <em>
    <span>Storm’s End</span>
  </em>
  <span>, was an idyllic place for young witches and wizards to grow up. Most adults turned a blind eye to their kids whizzing about on their pilfered brooms and casually left spell books lying around as a matter of course. So if two enterprising young people taught themselves to become Animagi long before the arrival of their Hogwarts letters without a single responsible adult being any the wiser, to whom could the blame be apportioned?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It had been somewhat of a blow to Robert Baratheon when two years earlier his strapping son, Gendry, had been sorted into Hufflepuff rather than Gryffindor, even if the boy’s house scarf did perfectly match the family crest. At least he felt better about that than the fact that his other three more, </span>
  <em>
    <span>ahem</span>
  </em>
  <span>, legitimate offspring had been sorted into the closest thing Beauxbatons had to Slytherin.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Catelyn and Ned Stark had now amassed such a tangle of various house-coloured uniform items that the fact of their younger daughter, Arya, being sorted into Gryffindor, now that she’d </span>
  <em>
    <span>finally</span>
  </em>
  <span> followed her best friend to Hogwarts, barely elicited an interested nod from either of them. However, Jon, the sole Gryffindor amongst her siblings, had appreciated the news, and that was all that mattered to Arya.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That first night at school, long after the feast was over and the first years were snoring behind their drapes in their newly appointed four-poster beds scattered about the castle, a wolf padded stealthily across the lawn towards the Forbidden Forest. Waiting for her in the shadows was an enormous stag, the span of his antlers impressive for one not yet fully grown.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The two animals travelled deep into the forest before they silently transformed into their human form - one male, one female. The boy grew taller even than the apex of his antlers whereas the girl would not have attained the point she could reach as a wolf standing on her hind legs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Though they were restored to their humanity, neither of them seemed to feel it necessary to speak, continuing to rely for some time longer on the non-verbal cues they used in their animal form as they trudged deeper into the forest.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was the boy who spoke first. “At least your parents won’t be annoyed like my Dad was.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I had wondered about that,” the girl replied. “But didn’t Shireen get sorted into Hufflepuff too? You’re not the only Baratheon not to be a Gryffindor.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not even a Baratheon,” said the boy dully. “But he would have liked me to be a Gryffindor anyway. How will your family feel when they hear about it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Robb and Jon had a bet going.” The girl laughed. “Robb’s losing big ‘cause I didn’t get sorted into Slytherin.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The boy didn’t speak but she appreciated his prickled sense of outrage at the mere suggestion.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I am sad about one thing, Gendry,” she said after they’d emerged into a suitable clearing. “After all this time apart since you started school, I’d hoped you and I would at least get to hang out in the same common room and eat at the same table in the Great Hall.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s why we brought the tent,” he replied, shrugging a small backpack off his shoulders. “And given that Arya Stark of Winterfell only gets the very best for her birthday...”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She smiled up at him. “Our very own common room.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The two of them stood back a way as Gendry threw the tent onto the ground in front of them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It didn’t look like much more than a puddle of beige canvas at first, but that was the wonder of wizard tents - utterly unassuming from the outside.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Arya pulled out her wand and raised the tent as she’d learned on family holidays, watching with a little smile as it seemed to self-inflate, guy ropes flying out and tethering themselves to shining pegs in the uneven ground. Gendry wouldn’t have to bend his head too far to get in but other than that it appeared as any other ordinary piece of camping equipment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She indicated with a point of her wand for Gendry to enter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, after you, m’lady,” he insisted with a playful mocking bow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She thwacked him soundly as she strode into the tent, dramatically swishing the flaps aside.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Even Arya Stark had to gasp at what she saw.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The entrance was grand - all exposed stone and rough-hewn wood with an imposing candle-lit chandelier hanging in the centre that lit the space with a flickering warmth. Large wooden doors stood directly opposite the entrance and two staircases ascended to the next floor on either side of the entrance hall.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This will do nicely,” she observed, working hard to keep her tone nonchalant after her initial surprise. She didn’t want Gendry getting too big for his boots.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t make your judgement yet,” he urged, pulling the tent flaps back across the entrance to stop the light from spilling out into the forest. “Wait ’til I’ve given you the tour!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He half jogged across the expansive foyer and wrenched open the double doors, standing to one side to once more allow Arya entry ahead of him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Still endeavouring not to reveal how impressed she was, Arya strode into the large room she knew Gendry had spent no small part of his summer holidays dreaming up. One glance around her and all her pretence slipped away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Gendry?” Her voice was barely more than a whisper.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Arya felt him grinning over her shoulder.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You like it, don’t you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She nodded dumbly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, I won’t let it go to my head.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s a bit like home,” she sighed, wandering into the room and running her hand across the back of the huge couch that reminded her of the one in her favourite den at Winterfell.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I knew you’d never say it out loud,” said Gendry quietly, “but I knew you’d miss it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s perfect.” She looked up at him. “What about your place? Aren’t there things you miss about Storm’s End?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Gendry shrugged. “After two years, I’m pretty used to Hogwarts. Besides, your place has always felt more like home to me than mine.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>All of a sudden, Arya threw her arms around Gendry’s neck, standing on tiptoe to squeeze him tight.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Gendry felt the flush creep up his face as he bent down to return her hug. He was further rewarded by a brief press of her lips against his cheek. Having Arya at Hogwarts at last was possibly going to be more complicated than he’d anticipated.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s upstairs?” she asked eagerly, pulling away from him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We each get our own bedroom for when we need to escape our dorms.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“With open fireplaces?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He nodded, smiling. “And a massive en-suite each so you can soak in the bath after Quidditch training.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I better make the team,” she said, biting her lower lip anxiously. “I’ve only been dreaming of playing Chaser for Gryffindor since I was four. Robb will never let me live it down if I’m the first Stark not to play Quidditch for my house in first year.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Making the team is your first challenge,” he laughed. “Getting anything past me will be where you </span>
  <em>
    <span>really</span>
  </em>
  <span> meet your match.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But everyone knows Hufflepuffs are too friendly to put up anything like an aggressive defence,” she retorted, skipping out of his reach.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Come back here and say how friendly I am,” Gendry shot back, laughing as he lunged for her. “I’ll show you an aggressive defence.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Arya sprinted up the staircase and ducked into the first door she came to, Gendry hot on her heels.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is your room?” she asked, turning on the spot in the middle of the polished floorboards, taking everything in.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Gendry momentarily forgot that he’d lumbered up the stairs to give chase.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah,” he said, glancing around, pleased with his work. “What do you think?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Arya ran a hand over the dark mahogany bedhead, hand-carved by Gendry to resemble stag horns.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re really good at this stuff, you know?” she said. “Muggles call this art.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thanks,” muttered Gendry, rubbing at the back of his neck, conscious once more of that warmth creeping up his throat.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Now I want to see my room!” she cried, pushing past him to run to the next door. She yanked it open and wandered inside open-mouthed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Where the downstairs room was a loving tribute to the den at Winterfell, her room was an exact replica of her bedroom at home.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I didn’t even know you’d been in my room,” Arya breathed. Ned and Catelyn had a strict “no boys in the girls’ rooms” policy that Gendry had never previously been brave enough to ignore despite Arya’s utter disregard for the house rules.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He looked at the floor rather than meet her eye.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Jon knew what I was up to,” he said quietly. “He let me in a few times when no one else was home.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She flopped into the wooden chair at the large desk by the window and looked at Gendry. “You made all this by hand?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He nodded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“For me?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He shrugged. “Who else?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re the best friend, you know,” she said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thanks,” said Gendry bashfully.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Arya surveyed the detail he’d painstakingly replicated, even down to family photos, until she finally spotted one item out of place.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She held up the framed photo of her and Gendry, his arm slung casually around her shoulders while their moving forms pulled ugly face after ugly face at the camera.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is new,” she observed quietly. “I don’t think I have any photos of you in my room at home.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“An oversight I took the opportunity to rectify,” Gendry replied. “Can’t have you moping about the place ‘cause you miss my face.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Arya laughed. “I’m hardly going to have a chance to miss your face anymore, am I?” she shot back. “I’m going to see you every single day. Besides, when I’m in here looking at your ugly mug in the frame, the real thing will be in the very next room.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Gendry looked at the floor. “I’ve missed your face while I’ve been here without you the last couple of years,” he said quietly. “Wish I’d had one of those in my room. Might have meant everyone could have eased up on calling me grouchy all the time.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Arya nudged him in the ribs, not without affection. “Nah,” she said. “You’ll still be grouchy now that I’m here. I’m a right pain in your arse, remember?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Gendry grinned. “How could I forget?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll make sure to remind you anyway,” Arya promised. “Every chance I get.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She turned on her heel and swanned out the door.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Gendry lingered a little while, looking at their photo and grinning to himself. At last, now he’d been reunited with the one he secretly thought of as his other half, his magical education could begin in earnest. All his schemes improved exponentially the minute Arya Stark got involved.</span>
