  <p>"She is lodged in me like a knife and yet I am beginning to forget her. Already the image of her that I hold in my head is fraying, bits of pigments, flakes of gold leaf, are chipping off. Will the entire canvas be empty one day? I have come to realise how little I knew her, I mean how shallowly I knew her, how ineptly. I do not blame myself for this. Perhaps I should. Was I too lazy, too inattentive, too self-absorbed? Yes, all of those things, and yet I cannot think it is a matter of blame, this forgetting, this not-having-known. I fancy, rather, that I expected too much, in the way of knowing. I know so little of myself, how should I think to know another?"</p>

Hagrid had told her that Harry's eyes had been blue for the first few days of his life too. James' had muddied into Weasley brown in the months after his birth, and teenage Ginny had chided herself for being disappointed.</p><p>She’s not disappointed now.</p><p>He barely has anything else of hers. The curve of his jaw, and maybe his ears. Ginny can’t remember Harry’s ears, and all the photos she ever sees his mop of unruly hair is hiding them. She can’t remember his voice very well these days if she’s honest. What she can remember is how happy they’d been together. It had filled every part of her life like a balloon. Being with him had made everything more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Your rabbits are getting toady Ginny dear” Her mother calls from across the steaming kitchen. Ginny blinks and looks at the last few soldiers in her line of napkin animals, and sees that they are indeed leaning toward the more amphibian side of things. She twitches her wand and the cloth napkins starch, then begin to stretch, until all of them have matching drooping ears.</p><p>James loves rabbits and to all the Weasley siblings great shock, had been allowed two pet ones in the garden, big Flemish meat rabbits, intended for one of Molly’s stews.</p><p><em>‘</em><em>I had to beg to keep Pidgewideon in my room, if I paid for all his feed, and he was a gift!’</em> Ron had protested at the time. But Percy had elbowed Ron, and Ginny thought they’d all understood pretty well, even Luna who’s views on reality were misty if one put it kindly. James was a version of Harry Molly and Arthur could pour all their love into. The older she gets, the more Ginny marvels how her parents bore the knowledge that the child who was visiting them for holidays, the near-son who they sent presents to, might meet his doom at any minute.</p><p>So James is knitted for, taught to fix muggle motors, is offered second helpings of everything, is allowed rabbits and his own bedroom. They’re still her parents though, and Ginny knows James also has to weed and de-gnome the garden, collect eggs every evening, and feed the ghoul every other week. He prefers a muggle bike his grandad taught him to repair over the old broomsticks in the shed. Sometimes he brings blackberries, or once even a little bouquet of thistles back from his sojourns in the country lanes.</p><p>Ginny doubts today will be such a day though. For one it’s early February, and for another what newly eleven-year-old boy thinks of anything but himself on his birthday? The best either of them will get is a haphazard kiss on the cheek and a one armed muddy hug.</p><p>Molly is frying homemade beef patties, orbited by various knives chopping various greens. Ginny had made the mayonnaise earlier that morning, just before James’ letter arrived over breakfast. She’d seen him tuck the green-inked parchment into the stack of books in his backpack before he’d ridden off. No doubt he’s up high in the branches of some tree right now, reading and re-reading the letter, happy in the glowing knowledge that soon he’ll have his favourite meal and open his presents.</p><p>Ginny remembered her own eleventh birthday the same way. They’d been poorer so there’d been less presents, but the clear bolt of joy running through the day was the same.</p><p>She runs out of napkins, and begins to take mismatched silverware out of the drawers. She lines it up around the plates framing the magically extended kitchen table. They’ll have a full house tonight. Percy, George, Bill, Fleur and Victoire have all promised to be there. Even Ron said he’d pop around, leaving Luna and Artemis alone for the first time since the baby’s birth. Ginny and George had firmly promised each other they wouldn’t kill him. Even if he did start talking about the benefits of Horngobbler milk again.</p><p>In the centre of the table are a few sprigs of oak arranged around a thick candle that’s been lit for the whole of James’ birthday. Ginny knows that to an outside eye she looks like an attentive, if somewhat young mother, laying out the ingredients for her son’s eleventh birthday. She’s tied her hair back, and the bottom of her shirt bears a stain from the batter of the enormous cake her and Molly have stashed away in the pantry.</p><p>Maybe still to some she's a semi famous Quidditch player, if one <em>‘slightly too prone to fits of rage’</em> as one careful commentator noted as she hit a famous Norwegian beater with his own bat, after he had the gall to kiss her to cheers from the crowd. To others again she’s a war hero, nearly legendary within her own right now for having a son with the Boy Who Lived and, eventually, Died.</p><p>What she really is, is a woman who’s waiting.</p><p>She tries not to let her eyes flick to the window too often, but they seem to wander there of their own accord. <em>Will she be here this time…?</em></p><p>Hermione had made it to only one of James’ birthdays in its entirety. It had been the year they started living together. <em>‘Eight’</em> She’d said to James, very seriously <em>‘The infinity symbol.’</em> There’d been something in the way she said it. A gravity. Ginny had watched her grey eyes clear as they regarded James. Hermione always listened carefully to what her son said. She lent him books she thought he might like. She talked to him like he was a person in his own right, quite outside of the ivy of myth that had sprung up around them, and deserving of respect.</p><p>The others loved him yes. But they each saw an aspect of James that they particularly cherished. Ron talked to him like they’d been eleven together and defeated a mountain troll. With George he became a strange blurred copy of Fred. James could be funny if he was in the mood for it, but sometimes his volleys with her brother became uncanny enough for Molly to have to excuse herself to cry in the kitchen.</p><p>Only Hermione seems to see him, like Ginny, as simply James. And now she's going to miss his eleventh birthday.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>Ginny watches the clock over dinner.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She watches the sky darken outside as they sing an out of tune ‘Happy Birthday’.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Teddy is particularly bad. His grandmothers thin voice isn’t much better. Ginny is touched they made the journey, but a big part of her eyes Andromeda sitting in what was meant to be Hermione’s chair with unease.</p><p>In the low birthday candlelight she’s nearly someone else. Ginny watches the way the shadows play on her high cheekbones. Watches the black glimmer of her eyes. She knows the suspicion is unfounded, knows the Department of Mysteries examined Andromeda even more closely than they examined Hermione once the dust settled, but sometimes she wonders. <em>What if…?</em> It would have been so easy, stepping into a weaker sister’s life.</p><p>And no one ever did see the body. <em>It was all burnt away</em> one of the older Aurors had told Ginny. <em>‘Conjured fire infused with powerful emotion has a way of even burning bones into nothing’</em> he’d said.</p><p>Ginny knew of course who’d lit that fire. Every half decent historian of the Second Wizarding war knew that. It's the same woman who’s late to her son’s birthday. She’d disappeared during the battle and had come back, sixteen hours later, looking on the edge of death herself. Then she'd disappeared to another continent. Hermione’s whole history of the war had been one of Elsewhere, starting with her strange kidnapping by Bellatrix Lestrange.</p><p>Ginny knows this line of thought isn’t fair- Hermione’s absence had culminated in triumphs each time. She’d destroyed one of Voldemort’s seven horcruxes, she’d killed his foremost lieutenant and her high ranking husband, and she’d returned from Japan with a fervour to improve magical society for the least fortunate.</p><p>Strangely enough though her Order of Merlin hadn’t come. Harry had gotten his posthumously. First Class of course. Ron had received Second Class, and so had Neville. There’d even been talk of awarding Luna a Third Class one.</p><p>But Hermione had received nothing. Ginny thought she knew why. She frightened people. There was something about her after her three great vanishing acts that said ‘Get away and don't look back ’.</p><p>Ginny hadn’t kept away. Or at least not for long. She’d emerged from her years of self-destruction, and then Hermione had come to her, colder than she remembered her friend ever to be, and Ginny had set herself a challenge. At first it was something of a game. Sometimes if she dammed the stream of their conversation just right she could coax Hermione into smiling.</p><p>She’d done it quite by accident the first time and the rush of happiness that had come with it seemed to have wandered in from a long gone life.</p><p>So she’d kept experimenting. There were lots of things Hermione found amusing, and even a few that would make her laugh. She wanted nothing of Ginny, and it was surprisingly easy to cook dinner for her, and watch terrible muggle shows and occasionally ply her with alcohol. She watched Ginny as steadily as if the younger witch was a bird that had flown into Hermione’s house, batting its wings and causing a mess. <em>Or perhaps she is the bird</em>, Ginny muses, receiving her slice of birthday cake, <em>and I'm the one with the outstretched hand, trying to coax her into landing.</em></p><p>The door opens. Ginny looks up, and there she is.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>She’s tired,</em> is Ginny’s first thought, and then the other witch is obscured from view because James has flung himself into her arms. Ginny’s eyes snag on the bit of pale wrist that shows underneath her gloves where she cups James’ head. When she looks up Hermione is looking at her. Her hair is curled over her shoulders. She's gotten a few new wrinkles this year that have nothing to do with age.</p><p>Before Ginny can decide why she suddenly feels like she’s about to throw up, Hermione walks over to her and hovers a gloved hand as if to cup her face. At the last minute she withdraws. “I’m sorry I’m late” She says, quietly, just for Ginny to hear.</p><p>There’a no reason for Ginny to feel this relieved. <em>It’s just a birthday party for Merlin’s sake.</em> They would have still lived together tomorrow and all the foreseeable nights after that. So why does she feel like some great test has been passed? Why are her hands clammy and her mouth full of wool?</p><p>“That’s okay” She manages. Hermione’s eyebrows knit together briefly, then she kisses Ginny right on the cheek, her own face cool from the early spring air, then draws back, eyes clouding over-</p><p>“Hermione!” The moment breaks, and Hermione receives her squeeze from Molly. Ginny wonders if anyone else sees the way her shoulders tense. She doesn’t like to be touched, which makes the kiss doubly strange.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ginny watches for it and catches the exact moment Hermione’s eyes land on Andromeda. She flinches. <em>Every time</em>, the Auror in Ginny whispers. But she recovers well enough, even manages to ask after Narcissa Malfoy of all people.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Then she asks Teddy if he's looking forward to third year, and just like that both him and Victoire are off , chattering excitedly about the prospect of Hogsmeade. James sits next to Hermione and shows her his letter while they chatter. Ginny touches her wand and the rest of the talking mutes to her ears. She still has to strain to hear what they say.</p><p>“Will you take me shopping for supplies?”</p><p>Hermione peers over her reading glasses from the second page of the letter. A tiny line sits between her eyebrows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Won't your mother want to take you?” She asks, low and thoughtful, smoothing the hair away from his face. He rolls his eyes and shrugs away from her.</p><p>“Three people can go shopping.”</p><p>Just then Hermione looks up, and Ginny manages to look interested in the conversation around her. She feels Hermione's gaze on her and she makes an effort to nod attentively to whatever the still muted Ron is saying to her. It's the height of rudeness to listen in, but some field-work habits are hard to shake. Whatever Ron is saying is obviously very dramatic, judging by the wild gesticulations that accompany it. Merlin, she hopes it's not another anecdote from the birth. The last five tidbits had left her queasy enough.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The prickly feeling of being watched finally leaves her. She touches her wand a moment later.</p><p>“…and that's why the amino acids in Hobs milk are absolutely essential for any growing infant” Ron finishes smugly. “Im so glad you're finally coming around to our view of things.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>“Weasley!”</p><p>When Robards calls her to his office Tuesday morning, Ginny is still in a good mood. The rest of James’ birthday had been a sweet evening.They'd walked a little ways into the cold country night after dinner, James dragging Hermione by the hand to show her a pixie nest he'd found earlier in the day, Ginny lagging behind, content to watch them. </p><p>Seeing Allegra the night after also hadn't hurt. They had a routine almost. Dinner at the tiny Ethiopian place near the Ministry’s east entrance, then a pint at the Hound and Fox. Sometimes some light necking at Allegra’s. Sometimes more than that. Allegra worked in the department of Sub-Regulations of Magical Transport, a dull limbo that had no business harbouring anyone half so pretty.</p><p>So Ginny was still only half stepped of a pleasant haze. A haze swiftly punctured by her boss. With just nine words.</p><p>“You went to school with Draco Malfoy, right Weasley?”</p><p>She frowns at the wealth of images that conjures up. Of them palling around in the lawn. Not being tortured by his cronies every other day.</p><p>“Together is a strong word sir” She hedges. She likes Gawain Robards. Likes his lack of patience and his pushes on utilising muggle law agency networks for their own ends, but he has a habit of becoming irate very quickly if reality doesn't line up with his pronouncements. “He was a year above me.”</p><p>Robards is still regarding her, arms folded in front of his muggle style business shirt. “You know you're one of my best Weasley”</p><p>Something in her still glows at that. But on the outside she just rolls her eyes. “What boring job is hurtling my way guv?” She asks, knowing that it's something of an honour in itself to be the only Auror under thirty to be trusted with anything amounting to more than showy headhunting.</p><p>“Malfoy’s up to something. I want eyes on him and I want them to be your eyes”</p><p>Ginny can't believe she's about to say the words but she does.</p><p>“But Malfoy was acquitted. Both him and his mother were. Coercion. And they tried to save-”</p><p>But suddenly in this room, with the chatter of the Auror cubicles behind her, smack-dab in the sun of her new life, she can't quite say Harry’s name aloud. She blinks away the moisture and looks at Robards. He's seen her falter of course. Hard not to when every quirk of her face has been catalogued by <em>Witch Weekly</em> at least five times. She's better at not slipping up these days. The undertow hasn't pulled her below in a while.</p><p>“Either way." He clears his throat loudly, and the room comes back into focus. Ginny thinks of Hermione. Her impassive face captured in the <em>Daily Prophet,</em> so unlike the emotional girl she'd been at school. Thinks of her own face in better articles. She's an Auror. A good Auror even. She can do this. She tunes back to Robard's voice. "That weasel is up to something. I'm hearing all kinds of unpleasant whispers from our various shadowy corners. I want to be on top of the situation before anything happens.”</p><p>Ginny chews her lip. “How do you want me to do this? We honestly have nearly no history. Unless you count him calling me a blood traitor every other year.”</p><p>“Sniff around. Befriend his wife.”</p><p>Now Ginny snorts. “I have even less in common with Daphne Greengrass than I do with Malfoy. What in Merlin's name would we talk about?”</p><p>“Beauty charms, nails, shoppin-ouch!” He counts them off on his hands and laughs when Ginny zaps his index finger. <em>Nails indeed.</em></p><p>“Talk to his business contacts. Get a feel for his company. Make yourself part of the furniture.”</p><p>Robards waves her away from his desk, knowing full well that he's just ruined her life for the foreseeable future.</p><p>“Oh yes. And make sure he doesn't notice”</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>“N’uck te chu”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Nah wrong again” Ginny answers, feet up on a pillow, and Lord Amersham’s extensive Mermish dictionary making her lose feeling in her thighs. James is still at her parents. He's spent the better part of the winter there. Ginny doesn't begrudge him this. They're both boring when they're immersed in new projects. And James' whole upbringing has been more on the village than nuclear side.</p><p>Hermione frowns. She'd been sitting on the couch when Ginny first offered to do this, but she's migrated to one of the wooden dining chair barely a minute after being joined there. Ginny tells herself very sternly to not be hurt by this. It's just Hermione’s way.</p><p>Instead she flicks a few pages forward, past the basic courtesies Hermione is trying to learn. A silverpoint of a Pacific Merwoman fills the whole page. Her nipples have been drawn with great detail. Her face is rough by comparison.</p><p>“Bit of a creep old Am-Sham” She mutters. Hermione slumps in her chair and snorts. Ginny feels herself glow from the minor victory.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“He's the best Greater Pacific Mermish source we have.” Hermione says, stretching her arms out above her head and closing her eyes. A thin strip of skin shows at her midriff. Ginny looks away. “They don't have a written language themselves, barely a phonetic one, and no one has ever bothered to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>go into such detail as this creep”</p><p>Ginny looks at the mermish woman again. Even in his crude hand, Amersham has conveyed something of her strangeness. A creature merely trapped for a moment in the hum-drum of the everyday world. She wonders how the old Lord met her. Had he tried to work her out too, or was she too foreign in the end that even he had to concede their acquaintance doomed? </p><p>“He killed three of them you know.”</p><p>Ginny looks up to Hermione studying her. There's a look of challenge in her eyes. And something else. Something darker.</p><p>“He wanted to see how they worked” She nods to the face still underneath Ginny’s fingers “Dig up all their dark secrets.”</p><p>Ginny snatches back her hand as if burned. Hermione looks pleased, then annoyed. She pushes two thumbs into the curve of her left eyebrow, her usual signal for one of her headaches.</p><p>Ginny knows that this is her signal to leave. The first jab should have sent her packing already. It happens every other week. The Other One will make an appearance. That's what Ginny thinks of her as. Like a Mr Hyde ‘evil’ version of her best friend.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Except Ginny can't really make out her eyes, and she has a feeling they aren't Hermione's at all.</p><p>So she stays where she is, counting the minutes on the clock on the fireplace behind Hermione's pinched face. <em>Every minute I stay is another strike in my column and someday it'll mean something</em>.</p><p>These moments are like a jail cell in the usual bright world of their friendship. Ginny thinks of herself as a prisoner, just as Hermione must have been, scratching lines on a wall while the sun is eclipsed. She thinks on Hermione as she last remembers her Before. They'd been sitting together at the Bill and Fleur's wedding. Hermione had giggled at something Ron said behind Aunt Muriel's back. Her dress had been red and her hair pinned up. Ginny hadn't seen her that at ease since.</p><p>If Bellatrix Lestrange wasn't already dead, Ginny would very much like to kill her.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>Tailing Malfoy has been one of the more comfortable jobs of Ginny's entire Auror career.</p><p>The prat spends most of his time having business lunches at extravagant prices, taking jaunts cross country to various mines and the rest behind the closed gates of his mansion.</p><p>He's had a son, Ginny learns through her preliminary paper research. Scorpius Narcissus Malfoy. Three years old and startlingly healthy considering his difficult infancy. Both Daphne and the child nearly died a few times. Ginny almost feels bad for the kid. He's in for a time and a half with that name at school.</p><p>The Auror Office would 'iron out the kinks' while Ginny did her preliminary legwork, which was why she now sat next to Gaspard de Putte, an indolent Belgian heir that she'd busted a year ago over some unsavoury business with a Banshee. He has a new tooth gem that Ginny wants to pry off on sight, long blonde hair and a way of drawling his words that signals not just his boredom with her, but with every other human being in Greater London. Possibly Britain. Ginny actually thinks she might have preferred Malfoy's direct company.</p><p>Still, Putty is to be her occasional ticket into spheres of wizarding society that she would have no reason to enter alone. On paper it made some level on sense Ginny muses, spearing another edible poesy out of her salad, while listening to the business lunch Malfoy is conducting two tables over. Nothing fascinating has been said thus far, and Ginny has the sinking feeling that, in true Pureblood waffling fashion, nothing of substance will be said for the next three courses.</p><p>Ginny lets part of her attention drift to the rest of the gilded cafeteria. A quartet of witches play in the far corner. The strings on their instruments gleam like unicorn hair. Ginny knows Hermione would have words to say on that. The rest of the room is full of the same set of wizards, that questionable margin who never actually joined the Death Eaters outright, but never said <em>boo</em> against them either. Ginny has a sinking feeling that she's due for a run-in with Pansy Parkinson sooner or later on this job.</p><p>She just hopes that this one can be kept out of the gossip papers for another few weeks. She's had a few jobs go south like that. Hard to be innocuous when you're being trailed by photographers. But they'd mostly lost interest in what's left of the Golden Trio these days. Wizarding Britain is on the mend. There are pop-stars and socialites on the cover of Molly's <em>Witch Weekly</em> subscription again, and Ginny knows they are all glad of it.</p><p>And besides, it's one thing to sit with Putty (<em>Gaspard</em>, she must remember to call him <em>Gaspard</em>) in a borrowed lavender top that shows off more than a hint of cleavage, and quite another to explain it to Mum, whose mentions of<em> 'a nice boy'</em> have steadily increased as James approaches Hogwarts age.</p><p>"- we'd need more time to move them" Ginny's ears perk up as the younger of Malfoy's business contact leans forward and finally gets to it. "The border being as it is-"</p><p>Ginny keeps her eyes on Putty. He's a terrible job of keeping the conversation up as she listens in, staring off into the distance, and slouching in his seat. Ginny knows at least three seperate pairs of feminine eyes are glaring daggers at her in jealousy. She hopes they have better use of him than her. She takes a large sip of her magically refilling glass and gives him a swift kick under the table. He sits up a little straighter.</p><p>Ginny looks past him, straight into Malfoy's narrowed eyes. The moment has come a little sooner than she planned, but she tilts her head and smiles. She also ends the eavesdropping spell. One can never be too careful, even with a bonafide prat like Draco Malfoy.</p><p>Putty snorts when she looks back at him. "Caught huh?" He says, looking into the golden bowl of his wine. Ginny wonders why anyone would have any other emotion towards him but rage.</p><p>"Always part of it" She answers tightly, throwing a silky curl of her own red hair back over her bare shoulder, and noting the way Putty's eyes track the movement. "Hide in plain sight" She reaches forward and takes the wine glass out of his hand, touches it to her lip and takes a sip. The imprint of her coral lipstick on its rim is it's own little story, paired with the way Gaspard swallows-</p><p>"I didn't know they let you bring pets in here" Malfoy drawls, travelling coat slung over his arm, coming to a stop at their table. Ginny sets down the glass. Wipes her mouth with the back of her hand, knowing she's smudged what little remains of her lipstick.</p><p>"You'll have to take your esteemed patronage elsewhere" She answers, slurring her words a little. Not too much. Just enough to make Malfoy feel he's got the upper hand. His eyes still narrow. He, like every other wizard in Britain with a <em>Prophet</em> subscription, knows what Ginny does. It's the thing that makes her job the hardest.</p><p>"Shouldn't you be catching muggle maimers?" He asks, and Ginny takes another long drink of her alcohol-free champagne.</p><p>"Shouldn't you be in Azkaban?" She shoots back "Just like dear Daddy before you?" </p><p>Now she definitely sees rage in Draco's eyes. <em>Good</em>. Let their personal history take up his vision. That's a smokescreen she can use.</p><p>Malfoy surprises her however, seemingly mastering himself and turning to Putty. "Gaspard de Putte. We met last year in Fez at that horrid Diplomat's Dinner."</p><p>Putty nods, regally, like a prince having finally been addressed in the correct form. "How anyone could overcook fish so I don't know."</p><p>"An interesting match for you Weasley. Punching a bit above your weight?" Malfoy says turning his attention back to Ginny. "And anyway, I thought you were busy pining after Granger?"</p><p>The words hit Ginny with the force of a small meteor. Pining after Hermione? <em>Pining?</em> How did Malfoy of all people know - did this mean it was common gossip - did <em>everyone</em>-</p><p>"A beautiful woman is a beautiful woman" Putty says, looking somewhere over Malfoy's shoulder. Ginny would be annoyed at him for that pathetic defence, but she can barely nod, can barely take another sip of wine.</p><p>Malfoy tilts his blonde head. "No offence meant Mr de Putte. Give my warmest regards to your father." He seems about to leave, but turns back once more.</p><p>"Do tell Robards to send someone else to tail me to the port next week." He walks away from their table, and the still stupefied Ginny "Five years of school together was quite enough."</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">Ginny feels beyond exhausted when she finally mounts the townhouse steps.</p><p align="left">Malfoy's words gnaw at her. She doesn't 'pine' after Hermione. She's there for her. They're there for each other. They need each other. Besides what does the slimy Death Eater git know? Ginny is Hermione's friend. Her best friend- the only one who knows how to make her laugh and-</p><p align="left">"Bad day?"</p><p align="left">Hermione peeks her head out of the kitchen, still in her office clothes but with bare stockinged feet. Ginny can smell onions and garlic wafting out of the kitchen behind her. </p><p align="left">She shrugs, drops her gym bag and opens the fridge for a beer. She's scrubbed off the make-up, and returned the lavender top to Allegra. She even managed to go for a run. Hermione goes back to grating carrots, eyes skimming over a report she's propped open with the ceramic butter dish. Ginny eyes the little lines of concentration around her eyes, and takes a few more pulls of cold beer.</p><p align="left">"What are you making?"</p><p align="left">"Sort of pasta thing with hidden vegetables" Hermione answers, not taking her eyes off the parchment of minutes, but smiling faintly "One day your son will eat an asparagus without being tricked into it."</p><p align="left">"One day" Ginny scoffs "Should I cut up some chicken?"</p><p align="left">Hermione's back in report-world, and just nods absently. Her blouse has come untucked from her skirt, and Ginny feels, as always, a strange sense of privilege washing over her, knowing she's the only one who gets to see this somewhat relaxed version of Hermione, one so unlike her stern portrait in the Ministry hall, or her scowling image in the <em>Daily Prophet,</em> all hard lines and arguments-</p><p align="left">"What?" Ginny looks up to find Hermione staring at her. Her face heats. To anyone on the outside that would have appeared like she was staring at her best friend's ass, when really it was just the adorable puff of her untucked shirt, but how does she even say that without sounding even battier-</p><p align="left">"Work was terrible" She blurts, for want of a convenient asteroid hitting their kitchen "Robards took me off a really interesting case - it was about-" She nearly says <em>that prat, Draco Malfoy</em>, but something stops her. "Just some trading stuff - but really interesting." She finishes lamely.</p><p align="left">Hermione looks at her for another long moment. A shadow passes over her eyes. Ginny has the weirdest urge to run upstairs, grab James and barricade the door. But why? It's just Hermione, even if there is a hint of the Other One in the air. Hermione would never hurt her. Not intentionally. Though when they were at school together Ginny is sure Hermione didn't have this many...gaps. She disappears almost. But then it's not as though they spent that much time together at school, and if they did, it was with Harry.</p><p align="left">She remembers the first time she saw Hermione was with Harry. She'd been tanned from her holiday abroad. Diagon Alley had been loud around them, and Ginny had been so excited to join them at Hogwarts. Then at <em>Flourish &amp; Blotts</em> Harry had stood up to Draco's father, for all the good it had done her. He'd rescued her in the end. She'd never forget that as long as she lived. Harry's dear face, covered in muck, telling her that everything was going to be okay now, that Riddle was gone.</p><p align="left">"What are your plans for tomorrow?" Ginny blinks. Hermione seems to have returned enough to be annoyed. <em>Annoyed at me?</em> Ginny thinks with a pang. <em>Pining after Granger</em>, Malfoy's voice echoes in her head.</p><p>"Uh- I'm off that case - so maybe just some paperwork. Feeling sorry for myself most probably." She attempts to smile at her own lame joke. Hermione's lips twitch, but the serious look remains. The darkness is gone from her eyes though. Ginny feels like she can breathe again.</p><p>"We still have to buy James something for school."</p><p>Ginny has a sinking feeling at these words. She's sure she mentioned it, but perhaps she did forget with the new case taking up so much of her thoughts. The worst part is she can see the three of them on a sunlit day in Diagon Alley. Just like the day they met, so long ago. She realises she wants it quite desperately.</p><p>"Mum and George already took him" She says, hating every pleading look that lead her to agree to this request. "You know how George is with him. I half think he's expanding into Hogsmeade so he has a chance to hang out with James."</p><p>Hermione doesn't seem put out. She rolls her eyes "I meant gifts - not school supplies. Not everyday your only son starts at Hogwarts" She lowers her voice and Ginny's heart does a weird jump. "I have a cancelled meeting after lunch. Pick me up then and we'll get him a surprise for when we pick him up."</p><p>Now Ginny sees the two of them, looking into muggle shop windows together, maybe grabbing an afternoon drink-</p><p><em>Pining after Granger</em>, Malfoy's voice cuts through her mind once more. It doesn't deflate her growing sense of happiness. Not in the least. </p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">The next day seems to drag into a small eternity.</p><p align="left">Ginny writes up her notes on the Malfoy case, taking care to note his dubious connections to both the Balkan black market, and to a disgraced Dragon-keeper in North Africa. It's still thin. She's not had enough time to put together a stronger case and it bothers her how light the file remains.</p><p align="left">There's something criminal going on there, she can feel it in her teeth. Draco Malfoy never stopped being the evil little prat he was in school, no matter what the Wizgamot thought. Ginny knew him then, and she knows him now.</p><p align="left">She sits in on the brief for the two dour Aurors who are taking over the case. Heathcote and Finch. They're older than her by a decade and they both dislike her. She's used to this. '<em>Golden Trio Status</em>' some of the more vocal players on the old Quidditch league used to call it. She had <em>Golden Trio Status</em> and thus she could do no wrong. Apparently it opened doors for her and it set up cushy positions. She'd like to tell them all to go and french a Dementor. </p><p align="left">The rest of Ginny's morning is spent dreading the flying missives that whir overhead. Hermione has cancelled plans before, and within the hour. Nothing personal, Ginny reminds herself, just her job.</p><p align="left">But when lunch comes, no missive has appeared, and she nearly spills her cold tea in her haste to stuff all her papers into her desk.</p><p align="left">"Got a hot date Weasley?" Marcus from the cubicle opposite coos, to appreciative hoots from around the room. She flips him off while she zips up her jacket.</p><p align="left">Hermione's still at her desk when Ginny arrives, slightly out of breath after tearing past Flo's outer office, five minutes later. Her mouth is set in a thin line, and she doesn't look up when Ginny all but crashes into the chair opposite her.</p><p align="left">"You ready?" Ginny ventures, still wheezing a little, and palming a stitch on her left side.</p><p align="left">Hermione signs another document. Her quill scratches hard lines into the parchment. She stamps the scroll with so much force that Ginny jumps slightly in spite of herself. Their eyes meet. Ginny's stomach drops. She's not seen Hermione this angry since they knocked back that last House-elf reform bill.</p><p align="left">"Flo!" Hermione calls, breaking the moment, and hands off the bundle of rolled parchment to her assistant. Ginny tries to catch her eye, as Hermione frowns back at the document in front of her. Flo mouths <em>'I don't know</em>' and makes an equally hasty retreat.</p><p align="left">"What were you doing with Gaspard de Putte?"</p><p align="left">Ginny's stares at her. "What?"</p><p align="left">"Gaspard de Putte. You. Him. Lunch." Hermione spits out the words, then takes off her reading glasses and pinches the bridge of her nose. Ginny sees Hermione's wearing the pearl studs she got her last Christmas.</p><p align="left">Is she... jealous?</p><p align="left">The novelty of this thought momentarily silences Ginny. She's dated a few people since they've lived together, even if she never brought many of them home (<em>'Why must we always do this at my place?'</em> Allegra, lips red and pouting) but Hermione never seemed to mind them.</p><p align="left">"I-" She begins, heart beating hard and unsure how to begin. Hermione being jealous would mean Hermione was possessive of Ginny? Possessive of their life together? Or of Ginny herself - or of -</p><p align="left">"His father owns the largest commercial asp-coral plantation in the Phillipines" Hermione continues "It is a sacred plant to the local merpeople - and its farming by a European company is a violation of a hundred different trade laws." Hermione's voice is as cold as Ginny's ever heard it. It sends a shaft of ice through her heart. Her whole body gets cold and then hot. Her vision blurs - how <em>stupid</em> could she have been to think-</p><p align="left">"Ginny?" Now Hermione sounds concerned and if Ginny could make out her face, she's sure she'd see her customary frown, like Ginny was another point on a very long list of problems she had to deal with. So she wants to answer Hermione- she's not a burden - that's the whole point - but she can't quite get the words out, choking on the force of her emotions before Hermione shot them to hell.</p><p align="left">A hand, a cool hand on her forehead, and Hermione's concerned face much too close to her own- she pushes it away and stands, nearly stumbling away from the desk in her haste.</p><p align="left">"Who told you that?" She manages, able to speak now they have some physical distance between them. Hermione's hands still hover, and she frowns fiercely. </p><p align="left">"It was - never mind that." Hermione takes a cautious step towards Ginny, hands held palms up, as if Ginny is a wounded animal she might startle "I should have known it wasn't true." Her voice is pitched to soothe, and Ginny tells herself to calm down, to explain the obvious mistake here.</p><p align="left">"Are you feeling alright?" Hermione takes another step closer. Ginny's eyes catch on a little silver ring glinting on her pinky. The noise of the Ministry comes back in increments.</p><p align="left">"Yeah" She manages "Yeah - just had a faint spell." She gives Hermione the ghost of a winning smile. "Probably just need some food."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">That's how they end up at what she's come to think of as Allegra's pub. Ginny really does feel better after a lager and a serving of greasy chips, and more than a little silly.</p><p align="left">Hermione hasn't said much, just sits quietly across from her, sipping a glass of pumpkin soda, and watching the other patrons. Ginny has never seen her really drunk. It would entail a loss of control. She takes a chip whenever Ginny wordlessly passes her one.</p><p align="left">The silence is nearly awkward, and suddenly Ginny hears herself say "I did have lunch with Gaspard." Hermione looks at her, expression carefully neutral, obviously giving Ginny space to explain herself.</p><p align="left">"He's an asset from the Auror's office. We have something on him - so sometimes he gets pulled into our investigations. A sort of ticket to certain places."</p><p align="left">Hermione huffs out a breath. "Well, I feel like a right fool."</p><p align="left">"You didn't know" Ginny says, and gifts her another chip. Hermione takes it and eats it in two dainty bites.</p><p align="left">"I jumped down your throat Ginny" She wipes her fingers on the napkin her glass sits on, a flicker of distaste passing over her features "I honestly don't know what came over me."</p><p align="left">Ginny remembers thinking she knew and flushes.</p><p align="left">" 'S okay" She shrugs, and gulps down the rest of her beer to hide her red face "Buy us another round and all is forgiven."</p><p align="left">She means this with every fibre of her being she realises. She would forgive Hermione anything. It's odd. Her and Harry never had a chance to walk very far down this domestic road. She wonders if she would have forgiven him anything too.</p><p align="left">To Ginny's surprise, Hermione doesn't return with a beer, but two decorated cocktails. Ginny eyes the pink carbonation and raises her eyebrows.</p><p align="left">"Most expensive drink on the menu" Hermione shrugs, a little half-smile playing around her mouth, and Ginny wonders where she keeps this side of herself for the rest of her life. This light, airy Hermione who fastens her lips around the little plastic straw and then winces.</p><p align="left">"Merlin that's sweet!"</p><p align="left">Ginny, feeling boneless and happy again, lifts her glass.</p><p align="left">"To friendship" She says, and means it. If this is all they can ever be to each other, Ginny will take it. Hermione holds on to her glass a little longer, face thoughtful.</p><p align="left">"To you." She finally says, low and sincere, and Ginny has to look away from her eyes.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="left">Muggle London, while dreary and uninspiring most days Ginny dips into it, can also produce some startling gems.</p><p align="left">Ginny and Hermione are in the local muggle high street, hands pressed against a cool glass shop window, the afternoon sun warm on their backs. Ginny is full of a fried muggle confectionary Hermione recommended (<em>Dough-nuts</em>, she'd enunciated very carefully, before watching Ginny take a bite of one the way a scientist might study a bug) and the sort of elation she usually feels on the Quidditch pitch.</p><p align="left">"That one would definitely go over well." Ginny nods towards the James-sized teddy bear propped up in the display behind the shop window.</p><p align="left">"He'd never speak to us again!" Hermione half-hiccups, turning around and closing her eyes, the sun full on her face. </p><p align="left">Ginny stays focused. "No" She says "I can definitely see that one would be a winner in the Gryffindor boys dormitory."</p><p align="left">Hermione snorts and leans her sun-warmed shoulder against Ginny. Then loops her hand through Ginny's arm and pulls them on. She lets go not two seconds later, but still. The street is full of muggles, just enjoying the spring day. The muggle council has put the flower baskets out on the lampposts already. Ginny loves every person out today. She loves the whole day.</p><p align="left">"Who says he'll be in Gryffindor anyway?" Hermione says archly, making an elaborate show of matching Ginny's step. "I was nearly in Ravenclaw."</p><p align="left">Ginny loops  her arm through Hermione's. "He might not take after you." She says, enjoying this fantasy. </p><p align="left">Hermione feigns outrage "Of course he will- James has taste! He's reading at least three grades above his own."</p><p align="left">"Out of self-preservation I'm sure" Ginny says, even though the sight of Hermione and James engrossed in their reading is the one that comes to mind when she thinks <em>home</em>.</p><p align="left">They pass the last cluster of shops, and take a turn down to the canal. A cluster of baby swans float past them. Ginny is overcome with the urge to tell Hermione how much she loves having her in their lives. She bites her tongue. She knows from past experience how quickly the other woman startles. And what is a declaration of love anyway, except for a cage? Ginny is someone Hermione should feel free with.</p><p align="left">"It's nice here" Hermione says, surprising her "Quiet."</p><p align="left">Ginny has ridden her bike down this particular canal a lot. Mostly with James. There's a lake a little further down, and a cafe that used to be a watermill.</p><p align="left">It doesn't shock her that Hermione's never been here, even though it's practically right around the corner from their house. Work always kept her indoors. But Ginny doesn't mention this, just hums in agreement. She does risk resting her head on Hermione's shoulder. She risks closing her eyes. It feels nice.</p><p align="left">"Ginny?"</p><p align="left">Ginny opens her eyes reluctantly. The sun has dipped behind the bare blackberry brambles. Hermione doesn't seem entirely giddy anymore. Ginny lifts her head and looks at her. Hermione looks back.</p><p align="left">Her eyes flicker to Ginny's mouth, and Ginny holds herself so still, wanting to be sure who initiated this, who leaned in until their breath was touching, until she could see the freckles dusting the bridge of Hermione's nose-</p><p align="left">Her breath is warm on Ginny's lips. A diorama from a picture book. The lady leaning down from her horse in a field of flowers. The knight gazing up. In the low light Hermione's eyes appear almost black and Ginny feels an all-too familiar shiver of fear, of uncertainty- but she stays still anyway, because she'd do anything for this woman, follow her anywhere she wanted to go-</p><p align="left">"<em>No.</em>"</p><p align="left">The snarl is feral, a completely alien sound ripped from Hermione's lips. She shoves Ginny away, and for a moment Ginny feels sharp nails, and smells something like heated metal, even though she knows Hermione keeps her nails short and favours a floral perfume.</p><p align="left">They stare at each other. Hermione's chest heaves and her mouth is slightly open, pretty and inviting enough that Ginny sways forward without quite meaning to, if only to touch-</p><p align="left"><em>Pop</em>.</p><p align="left">Hermione's gone and Ginny stands alone.</p>
