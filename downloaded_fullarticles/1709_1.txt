    <p>Red stalked his prey through the human den meant to confine him, his paws skimming soundlessly over the smooth ground. He had woken up here in this prison of stone and steel and had been unable to escape no matter how hard he threw himself against the walls. It had made him angry. And he was so <b>hungry</b> . The human male he was stalking was oblivious to his fate. Curly fur on his head and golden eyes, with a stolid build. There would be so much <b>meat</b>. When he was out in the open, Red pounced. The human fell to the ground with a cry, and Red slashed his claws across his stomach, easily disemboweling him. He took a bite of hot, steaming entrails, gulping them down with delight. A shaking human hand came up to touch Red’s head, stroking gently. “Allen… I… love you…” The hand fell to the floor, lifeless. Red’s ears flicked, ridding himself of the oddly familiar sensation of that human’s touch, and went back to eating.</p><p>Allen woke up.</p><p>He found himself lying on the floor, naked, something itchy and uncomfortable crusted onto his skin. He looks down and realizes it’s blood. A sinking sensation made its way into his gut. He’d gotten attacked by some sort of big cat, sure, and maybe his recovery was a bit faster than normal, but it was only a wild animal. Werewolves were the only thing that infected people.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Then the smell hit him.</p><p>It was overpowering. It smelled <em> good </em> too, which was why Allen was standing and taking stumbling steps towards it right before he realized what that smell was a second after he saw the body.</p><p>Allen fell to his knees.</p><p>He can’t</p><p>He can’t</p><p>
  <em> Mana. </em>
</p><p>He threw up all the contents in his stomach. Then he threw up again upon seeing what had been <em> in </em> his stomach, clenching his fists so hard it hurts until there’s nothing left and he’s dry heaving next to his father’s body.</p><p>Tears streaming down his face, he moved to cup what was left of Mana’s face. Then he pressed his forehead against his and sobbed.</p><p>He doesn’t move for a long time after that.</p><p>Allen wakes up.</p><p>Instant nausea assails him, his stomach roiling. He hops out of bed and runs to the bathroom, Timcanpy hissing his displeasure at being disturbed. Allen shuts the door and just makes it to the toilet before he throws up all the contents in his stomach. Allen’s left eye alerts him of one of his dorm mate’s approach, Timcanpy around his shoulders. Luckily it’s only Inali.</p><p>Inali opens the door and Timcanpy immediately flys over and lands on Allen’s shoulder, preening his hair with a worried chirrup. Inali comes in and–oh, good, he brought gloves–sits down next to Allen on the floor. “Hey, Allen. Are you okay?” Inali asks, taking Allen’s hand with a worried glint in his eye. The texture of fabric on fabric is a soothing balm to Allen’s nerves.</p><p><em> “I would like to know this as well,” </em> Timcanpy says, fluffing out his feathers and repositioning himself on Allen’s shoulder with his toe claws.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Allen says, sending Inali a reassuring smile. <em> “You don’t need to worry.” </em> He says, looking to Timcanpy.</p><p>Timcanpy looks him in the eyes, his green eyes glowing in the dim light being filtered from the Black Lake. He dips his head, and goes back to grooming Allen’s hair with his beak-like snout.</p><p>Allen turns back to Inali. “I’m feeling a lot better now.” Allen says with a reassuring smile. He grimaces. “Though, I think I need to take a shower, or at least wash my hair.”</p><p>Inali smirks. “You poor, deprived child.” He yawns. “Well, if that’s all, I’m going back to bed. See you in the morning.”</p><p>Allen nods, with a smile. “See you. Goodnight.”</p><p>Quietly grabbing some clothes from his trunk, he steps into the shower with Timcanpy draped around his shoulders, delighting in the hot water. Allen always turns it on especially hot when it gets close to the third quarter moon. It eases the ache of his spine and the throbbing of his shoulders, and he relaxes into the shower. By the time he's finished he's relaxed and also–unfortunately–completely awake.</p><p>It was a good thing most of his friends were night owls.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Allen goes looking for Lavi first, because if there's anything guaranteed, it's that the Bookman heir will be up at this hour reading a book or performing his Bookman duties. The Ancient and Noble House of Bookman was a mysterious family. Everyone knew that they basically knew everything about everyone, from a juicy gossip piece to their deepest, darkest secrets. Whether through spywork or an information network so convoluted that not even Master can pin it down, they were a force to be reckoned with. Another of the odder things about them was how their house gained the next heir. Rather than having someone who was related to them, they chose someone from the magical world to be their heir.</p><p>Lavi claimed they were chosen for their intellect and stunning charm, and Allen had to agree– at least, about the intellect part.</p><p>He went to the library first. A quick walk around while scanning with his eye, however, showed that Lavi was not there. Feeling disappointed, Allen droops against a bookcase. He quickly shakes his head however. Lavi wasn't in the library. That must mean he was somewhere else on the castle grounds. Standing up straight, Allen closes his eyes and reaches out his senses, searching for a certain redhead. He might be completely out of Allen's range, but there's no point in not trying, right?</p><p>In his mind's eye, he flies through the halls of the castle, passing moving staircases with ease until he's on the castle grounds. He soars over the surface of the Black Lake, the calm surface disturbed by the giant squid. Two familiar lifesigns ping on his senses, one a vibrant red that is sharp and focused, one a cobalt blue that's as calm as a pool of water, centered and focused compared to the writhing storm waves it had been doing earlier.</p><p>The red signature is by the Black Lake. The blue, however, is in the Forbidden Forest.</p><p>Allen huffs.</p><p>It figures Kanda would break the rules when it suits him and then judge Allen for doing the same.</p><p>
  <em> “So what do you think, Tim? Kanda, or Lavi?” </em>
</p><p>Timcanpy cocks his head in consideration.<em> “Our Kin would be best, I believe. The Snake-Headed One is most unsettling, even if the snake only is your odd mammalian hair.” </em></p><p>Allen flicks him on the forehead with a snort. <em> “You’re odd.” </em></p><p>Timcanpy snaps at Allen’s face, settling into a sulky silence.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Allen finds Lavi, or rather, his trunk, on the ground by the Black Lake.</p><p>He whispers the password and climbs in, stepping down off of the stairs and into Lavi’s library. Each wall is lined with bookshelves filled to brimming with books, in no particular order– though Lavi swears there's an order to the chaos. And he never loses anything, so Allen supposes it might be true. Allen maneuvers around precariously piled stacks of books, some of the tomes on the bookshelves looking older than sin, until Allen finally finds Lavi hunched over his desk, reading a book in some foreign language that Allen can’t quite make out, while translating feverishly on a seperate notebook.</p><p>Allen looks over his shoulder. “Hey, Lavi. What are you working on?”</p><p>At the sound of Allen’s voice, Lavi jumps like he’s been poked with a pincushion and slams the book shut, quickly covering it with some old herbology notes. Inwardly, Allen narrows his eyes. <em> Well, that’s not suspicious at all. </em> Outwardly, however, he simply smiles and says, “Bookman business this late, Lavi? You should really be getting some sleep.”</p><p>Lavi laughs and rubs his head sheepishly. “Well, you know me.”</p><p>Allen smiles and shakes his head, covering his mouth as he yawns. “I’ll just leave you to it, then. It is pretty late.” He says. <em> And I’ll also wonder why you were translating something in Celtic about werewolves. </em></p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lavi is sneaking inconspicuously out of the restricted section, plunder in hand, when Lenalee says from behind him, "what are you doing?"</p><p>Lavi jumps. <em> Shit. </em> Well, when caught in the act, bullshit like hell.</p><p>Lavi grins. "Hey, Lena." He says, crossing his arms behind his head and, incidentally, hiding the book he had gotten from view. "I was just leaving the restricted section. You know how it is."</p><p>Lenalee crosses her arms. Lavi can see Kanda looking at him from behind a bookshelf, which means Alma can't be too far behind. Lenalee stamps her foot, "yes, I do know how it is. Which is why I know you," she points at Lavi, "don't <em> sneak </em> out of the restricted section. You walk out of it like you own it."</p><p>Lavi winces and doesn't meet her eyes. She reaches up to grab his chin and forces him to meet them anyway. "Lavi," she says softly, "what's going on?"</p><p>Lavi grimaces and looks away, only to see Kanda standing behind Lenalee's back with his arms crossed, Alma with their killer doe eyes out in full affect.</p><p>Lavi sighs and runs a hand down his face. "Fine, fine! I'll tell you. But you can't tell anyone else. Not even Komui." He looks at Lenalee at this point.</p><p>Lenalee nods seriously. "Of course." The Hufflepuff says, and Lavi supposed her answer should have been obvious.</p><p>"So?" Kanda prompts impatiently.</p><p>Lavi looks around the library. No one looks particularly interested, but that doesn't mean they aren't. Especially when it comes to them, the friends of the Destroyer-Of-Time.</p><p>While no one is exclusively outside of Allen's circle, it's easy to tell who's a friend and who's a <em> friend. </em></p><p>And that's almost exclusively because of their reason for wanting to be friends with Allen in the first place.</p><p>Whether it's Lenalee because Allen so desperately <em> needed </em> a real friend, Alma because they have something in common, or Kanda because… <em> Kanda. </em> (Lavi feels like that one's self-explanatory). And, of course, Lavi himself has his own reasons for being Allen's friend. Some not particularly benign.</p><p>But he was his friend.</p><p>And he would do what was best for him, even if it meant going to illegal measures to do so.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>They're skipping out on lunch while the rabbit waffles over whatever the hell he has to tell them. This better be good.</p><p>Kanda's been getting good at <em> reducto </em>.</p><p>If the rabbit doesn't answer quickly, he might just shave him bald.</p><p>Though that'd be much more satisfying to do to the beansprout.</p><p><em> Though I'd do that and more if any of the Archfiend families decide they have a bone to pick with him, </em> another part of Kanda growls angrily.</p><p>"And I really don't know how to explain this…" the rabbit keeps babbling, and Kanda's temper snaps.</p><p>He doesn't slam his hand down on the table, but it's a near thing. "Hurry up, rabbit. I'm missing soba for this."</p><p>The rabbit sighs and then looks around furtively. "It's about Allen." He whispers, and immediately Kanda can sense several auras perk up with interest. Cursing–and what the fuck Lavi, why would you reveal whatever the fuck this is in a <em> public </em> library–Kanda draws his wand and erects a privacy ward.</p><p>Their eyes are all firmly fixed on Lavi now. <em> Just fucking say it already. He's still alive so it can't be that bad. </em>  Lavi takes a deep breath. "Allen is a shapeshifter."</p><p>Well, fuck.</p><p>Lenalee bites her lip. "But Lavi, the moons…"</p><p>She was right, of course. They would have noticed by now if Allen had disappeared every full moon. He does, however, disappear every so often, with a perfectly reasonable excuse on his lips every time he returns. Kanda had just been resigned to the bullshit, except now that he's counting them up, he can't help but notice a pattern.</p><p>Kanda meets Lavi’s eye. “The half moon?” He asks seriously.</p><p>Lavi nods. “That was what I couldn’t figure out before. But in this book,” Lavi hefts up a a humongous book and slides it on the table, and Kanda catches the title before Lavi flips it open.</p><p>“<em> Lore of the Shapeshifter </em>?” Kanda asks skeptically.</p><p>Lavi nods with a grimace. “I thought it was junk, too, at first. And some of it is a lot of baseless theory packed with a lot of discriminatory garbage, but. This passage, right here. It says, ‘The Mngwa, however, transform during the phase of the half moon.They can transform outside of the half moon, however that does not make them any less…’”</p><p>Lenalee frowns. “Any less what, Lavi?”</p><p>Lavi frowns. “‘any less vicious.’ But look this author is obviously biased. He said in the first thirty pages that you could fend a werewolf off with a wooden cross, and everyone knows that isn’t true.”  </p><p>Underneath the table, Alma grips Kanda’s knee in a death grip. Kanda looks over to see Alma looking shaky, their eyes a bit bright. Kanda could have kicked himself. He had known of Alma’s fear of werewolves ever since they had nearly gotten bitten when they were nine. Tiedoll had scared it off, but it didn’t exactly leave Kanda feeling charitable towards werewolves.</p><p>But this was the beansprout.</p><p>And now Alma was afraid of him.</p><p>Kanda took Alma’s hand in his, squeezing gently. Alma started breathing again. They shot Kanda a grateful smile, eyes still bright.</p><p>“Well obviously it isn’t true.” Kanda snaps. “But what are we going to do about it?”</p><p>Lavi smiles, his expression sly. “I have a plan.”</p><p>As they planned, a person watched in the background, and the more they watched, the more their smile grew.</p>
