    <p align="justify">Harry sighed. He had no idea why he was so melancholy lately. At the back of his mind was an odd impression that he was forgetting something, something important. It was like a vague itch, too faint to scratch but distracting nevertheless. People were acting a bit strange towards him, too. In itself, that wasn’t so unusual, but…the best he could describe it was that it was a weird kind of odd. Different to the usual Harry Potter-related weirdness. He’d tried to ignore it but with his N.E.W.T.s coming up, he couldn’t afford anything that took away from his concentration. With all other options exhausted – as in, none – he found the only person he knew could help.</p><p align="justify">“Look, Hermione,” he found himself saying, ten minutes later. “You are the only person I know who can help me with this!” He ran a hand through his hair in frustration, trying to keep his voice down. They were in a secluded corner of the common room, and it was largely deserted, but still. “People are being weird. Weirder than normal,” he added, knowing what she would say. “I just…there’s something I’ve forgotten, something important, and it’s driving me crazy…there!” he pointed at her triumphantly.</p><p align="justify">“What?” she asked, startled by his sudden movement.</p><p align="justify">“That look!” he said. “That’s the look that means you know exactly what I’m talking about. Please, Hermione!”</p><p align="justify">She looked torn, and he knew then that his hunch was correct – she knew what was going on. “This will be easier with the Pensieve,” she told him abruptly. “Come on.”</p><p align="justify">Sneaking up to McGonagall’s office wasn’t necessary now – Eighth Year students had no curfew, and McGonagall had made her office open to Harry. It had been a useful refuge at times, but he wasn’t sure it extended to use of her magical items. The desperate need to know what was happening to him overrode any doubt, though, and Harry found himself whispering <em>‘Onoprodum acanthium’ </em>to the gargoyle that guarded her staircase. Inside, Harry nodded at the former headmasters and headmistresses stirring in their portraits while Hermione extracted her memories.</p><p align="justify">“Harry,” she said, wand holding the silvery strings over the Pensieve, “before we go in there, I want you to remember you asked me to show you this.”</p><p align="justify">“What’s that supposed to mean?” he asked, but she’d dropped the memories and the liquid was swirling. Before he could speak again she’d grabbed his hand and they were toppling headfirst into her memories.</p><p align="justify">+++</p><p align="justify">Harry blinked. He’d landed on the Quidditch pitch. It was night time and, from the look of it, winter. Snow was falling, and there were two figures standing next to each other. No, facing each other, facing off against each other in the middle of the pitch as though they were about to fight.</p><p align="justify">“Hang on, that’s me!” Harry told Hermione. He glanced around and saw the tension on her face. They were standing next to Memory Hermione, who was crouched in the shadow of the grandstand, wand at the ready.</p><p align="justify">“What the hell are you doing?” Harry asked Hermione. He pointed to himself in the middle of the pitch. “And what am I doing?” He tried to walk closer but couldn’t – he was bound by Hermione’s memory. Irritated, Harry squinted at the figures. One was definitely him, and the other…</p><p align="justify">“Is that Draco Malfoy?” he asked in astonishment, a frisson of energy shooting down his spine. As he watched, the two of them argued. Malfoy shoved him, and he shoved back. He couldn’t hear what they were saying, but it didn’t seem to be too amicable. Abruptly, Draco turned to walk away, and to Harry’s amazement, he grabbed at Draco’s arm. Draco shook him off, and it looked as though Harry was asking him something. Begging, Harry would have said, had it been anyone but Malfoy. Mesmerised, he watched himself take Malfoy’s hand and tug him away towards the Gryffindor team change rooms. Malfoy seemed reluctant, but he followed the grip on his arm.</p><p align="justify">When they disappeared, the crouching Hermione didn’t move, though her wand drooped. “Oh, Harry,” she sighed, and conjured herself a three legged stool on which to sit.</p><p align="justify">“You haven’t answered a single one of my questions!” Harry hissed at Hermione.</p><p align="justify">“I told you, you need to see it, Harry! Watch it all then I’ll answer your questions.” She directed him back to the memory, which was swirling and coalescing again. It looked the same – Quidditch pitch at night. No, the shadows had moved – the moon was at a different angle, but they were still standing in the same place, beside Hermione on her stool. As Harry was about to ask yet again, Hermione shot him an exasperated look and pointed at the far side of the pitch. Malfoy was stumbling out of the change rooms, tugging on his robes.</p><p align="justify">“No!” his voice was loud enough to carry this time; he was shouting, and loudly. “No more, Harry!”</p><p align="justify">As Harry watched, his memory-self stumbled out too, also fixing his robes. “Draco! Draco, wait, please…” strangely, his sobs were also audible.</p><p align="justify">“I had an Extendible Ear out by this point,” Hermione explained. “So we can hear you.”</p><p align="justify">Across the pitch, Harry was grabbing again at Malfoy’s robes, urging him to stay, to listen.</p><p align="justify">“NO!” Malfoy tried to roar, but his voice broke. He stopped trying to pull away and turned on Harry. From the other side of the pitch, it looked like he was crying, but that couldn’t be right…</p><p align="justify">“No <em>more</em>, Harry. No more late nights where nobody can find us. I want to be with you. Not just like this, where nobody can see your shameful little secret,” he spat out the last phrase, “Harry Potter’s fucking a wannabe Death Eater.”</p><p align="justify">Harry’s ears filled with white noise, and it was a few seconds before he realised it was the memory and not the shock generating the noise. He focussed again, but everything looked frozen. “What’s happening?” he asked Hermione.</p><p align="justify">“I paused the memory,” she said. “Thought you might need some time to come to grips with that bit.”</p><p align="justify">“Right, well I’m fine,” Harry lied, “so can we get on with it please?”</p><p align="justify">The noise ceased and the memory started up again. Harry watched himself try to convince Malfoy to stay before the sobbing blond finally turned and fled. Harry suddenly looked very small and alone, and as they watched, he fell to his knees and covered his face. His sobs were so loud Harry thought the Extendible Ear wasn’t even necessary. As they watched, Hermione stood, Vanished her stool and started striding across the pitch to the still-sobbing Harry.</p><p align="justify">Harry and Hermione followed, watching Hermione help a distraught Harry to his feet and hold him as he cried into her robes. “He doesn’t understand, he won’t listen…”</p><p align="justify">“I know, Harry,” Hermione said, and the way she spoke made it clear that she had already known about Harry and Draco, and probably disapproved, Harry thought. When the sobbing subsided, Hermione ignored her tear-stained shoulder and conjured a handkerchief so Harry could blow his nose.</p><p align="justify">“You followed me down here,” Harry said, wiping at his face.</p><p align="justify">“Of course I did. There are only two reasons you sneak out at night, and Buckbeak’s still protecting his baby from everyone,” she said. The look on her face was painfully close to pity. “Harry, you can’t keep doing this.”</p><p align="justify">“I know,” Harry said in a whisper. “Draco…doesn’t want me anymore.” His face collapsed in as he whispered, “He doesn’t love me anymore.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m not sure that’s exactly what he said,” Hermione protested carefully.</p><p align="justify">“He wants us to parade around, showing ourselves off. Like I need another reason for people to point and stare when they see me!” Harry flared. “He doesn’t believe you can love someone unless you shout it to the whole world!”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t think that’s quite true,” tried Hermione again. They stood in silence for a long while, Hermione’s face miserable while Harry’s was blank with grief.</p><p align="justify">“Hermione, do you still have that Memory Charm?” he asked suddenly, raising his tear-stained face. “Remember you did that extra work for Flitwick on targeted Memory Charms?”</p><p align="justify">When Hermione nodded hesitantly, Harry’s face set, still pale but now determined. “I want you to do it on me.” He drew in a shaky breath. “About Draco. Malfoy, I mean. All the stuff with him.” He stopped, then pinned her with a pleading look. “Please Hermione. He doesn’t want to be with me, and I can’t not be with him. Not if I know…” he trailed off, closing his eyes to breathe deeply.</p><p align="justify">“Are you sure?” Hermione asked doubtfully. “The new one’s pretty experimental, I mean they developed it to use against Death Eaters, to make them forget Voldemort…”</p><p align="justify">“But you did the old one it on your parents,” Harry protested, then froze as Hermione let out a tiny, agonised squeak. “Oh, Merlin, I’m sorry...”</p><p align="justify">“Harry,” Hermione whispered. “I don’t know how to reverse it. What if it goes wrong? Can you live with that?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes,” Harry said firmly. He squared his shoulders. “Do it now.”</p><p align="justify">“Now?” Hermione yelped. “Harry, I should check the incantation, and the new recommended wand action is very tricky…”</p><p align="justify">“Please, Hermione,” Harry begged.</p><p align="justify">With a look of serious reservation on her face, Hermione slowly took out her wand. Harry, standing back from the memory pair, felt Hermione slip her hand into his. He looked over at her to see tears sliding down her cheeks. “I’m so sorry, Harry,” she whispered, and Harry had the peculiar idea she was talking to both versions of him.</p><p align="justify">Before them there was a loud bang and Harry staggered, a grunt coming from his throat as he dropped his sodden tissue.</p><p align="justify">“Harry?” Hermione asked, her voice tense, wand still pointing at him.</p><p align="justify">“Hermione.” Harry replied automatically. He looked around. “What are we doing out here?”</p><p align="justify">“Um,” she said, “we followed Malfoy out. Wondered if he was up to something.” She waited, not breathing as far as Harry could tell.</p><p align="justify">Harry raised his eyebrows, and for a moment he didn’t speak. “Did we?” he said finally. “Up to his old tricks, is he?”</p><p align="justify">“What tricks?” Hermione asked carefully, still watching Harry.</p><p align="justify">“Oh come on, the usual ‘My father’s going to hear about this, I don’t have to follow the rules’ kind of stuff.” Harry looked at her with an odd expression. “Don’t you remember?”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, of course,” Hermione said, her voice falsely high. “Let’s go back to the dorm, shall we?”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” Harry said, and they set off towards the castle. He touched his cheek, frowning, then shrugged it off.</p><p align="justify">Harry stared after the pair for a moment, until Hermione tugged on his arm, and they were flying backwards out of the Pensieve.</p><p align="justify">+++</p><p align="justify">When they landed, Harry allowed his knees to crumple as they’d been threatening to do since Malfoy had shouted at the memory of him and walked off.</p><p align="justify">Hermione slid down to sit beside him, tears still running down her face. “I’m so sorry, Harry,” she said.</p><p align="justify">“Thank you for showing me that,” Harry said. He wrapped one arm around her. “I can’t believe I asked you to do that. I didn’t even ask if you’d be okay with it. Merlin, I should be the one that’s sorry.”</p><p align="justify">They sat in silence for a moment.</p><p align="justify">“Do…do you have any questions?” Hermione asked.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” Harry said slowly. “I mean…can you just tell me what happened? I mean from the start. I don’t know, when that was, or when it all started, how you found out…”</p><p align="justify">“Okay,” Hermione said. He could see her order her thoughts before she began. “It started….it was about…October, I guess. McGonagall was all into cross-house friendship, and she’d paired up the Eighth-Years with each other to sit at each other’s tables, be seen around the castle together, that kind of thing.” Harry made a face at this. “Yeah, it wasn’t great. But most people just got on with it, and it wasn’t terrible. It was kind of working, really.”</p><p align="justify">“Hang on, I don’t remember that at all,” Harry said. “I mean, I remember the idea of it, but I don’t remember being part of it.”</p><p align="justify">“You were paired with Malfoy.” Hermione told him. “I have no idea why. You seemed to hate each other. You certainly complained about him enough, though in retrospect it was a bit of a love-hate thing. By New Year’s, you were spending a lot of time ‘on your own’, and in the only reasonable conversation I had with my less-than-delightful partner, Pansy Parkinson, we realised you and Malfoy were spending time ‘on your own’ at the same time, all the time.”</p><p align="justify">“Parkinson knew?” Harry said.</p><p align="justify">“She’s friends with Malfoy, so she agreed not to say anything.” Hermione explained. “I confronted you, and you admitted you and Malfoy had been seeing each other for a while.” She sighed. “I’d been convinced you were pining after someone – Ginny, maybe. But when you talked about him, you were happy, really happy, you should have seen your face... Nobody knew except Pansy and I, and we tried to make sure nobody else realised you were both disappearing at the same time.”</p><p align="justify">“Right.” Harry said, his head whirling with this information. He just couldn’t resolve the idea of himself and Draco. “Hermione, did I mention anything about how we got together? I mean, we kind of hated each other for a long time…”</p><p align="justify">She sighed. “Apparently you were fighting about something after one of the Hogsmeade trips. He’d said something about your family, and you’d said something about his. You got pretty loud and Neville had a go at both of you, reminding you that everyone’s families were changed by what happened.” She shrugged. “You said it made you look at him differently. Draco, I mean. The way his father was, what it must have been like growing up like that. And the things he’d lost in the War.”</p><p align="justify">“What, so I just started being nice to Malfoy?” Harry asked in disbelief.</p><p align="justify">“Not right away,” Hermione said. “I don’t know what happened after that, specifically. You just said you and he had understood each other better, and then…” she shrugged. “You were together.”</p><p align="justify">“Right.” Harry said. “And then that happened.” There must have been some pretty heavy conversations, he mused. A lot must have happened for him to be that emotional about Malfoy. And yet, he’d seen it with his own eyes…</p><p align="justify">He waved one hand at the Penseive, indicating the memory he’d just experienced. “When was that, anyway?”</p><p align="justify"> “Ninth of February,” Hermione told him. “You and Malfoy had been arguing about Valentine’s Day since the start of the month. He wanted to do something special but you refused to do anything that might put your relationship out in the open.” She sighed again. “I think it had been an ongoing problem, to be honest.”</p><p align="justify">“So that’s it, then.” Harry said flatly.</p><p align="justify">“Yes,” Hermione said in a small voice.</p><p align="justify">“I think I need some space,” Harry told her. Hermione nodded, and they descended the stairs together. When Hermione turned for Gryffindor Tower, Harry gave her a brief smile then continued on his way, wandering aimlessly through the castle. The irritating itch he’d been desperate to scratch was gone – but it had been replaced by something far bigger and more painful.</p>
