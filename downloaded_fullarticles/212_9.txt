    <p>It was Viktor's going-away party. The last time Viktor was to see Hermione and the last time Hermione was to see Krum.<br/>
But it didn't snap inside of her before she looked into his eyes from across the room. They were brown hidden behind his big bent nose. If eyes are the windows to our souls, through his eyes she could finally see all his sweetness, all his loyalty and every single one of his impulses. If they hadn't been surrounded by people she would have raked her hand over his head, through the tiny hairs of his buzz cut one last time. But as it were, it was the last time any of them were to see him because he was flying home that night. So she simply let her feelings be what they were, feeling trapped by everybody who was coming to say goodbye to him.<br/>
While Hermione was combating her emotions, Viktor was combating his urge to abduct her and be alone with her in these last few hours. But there he was, and Sirius had organized this whole going-away party just for him. Knowing Sirius, it hadn't been easy. Sirius wasn't the most organized host-father. Viktor wasn't the most organized seventeen-year-old host-son either though, so it was a good match. Viktor felt he couldn't have gotten a better home to stay in, in all of England. The stay with Sirius and his godson Harry had been all he could ever want. Sirius had adopted and raised his godson unexpectedly after Lily and James Potter's untimely death when Harry was not yet one year old, which made Viktor love them both for who they were all the more.<br/>
During his exchange year in England, Viktor had met many new people. Sirius' lover Remus, the Weasley's and his best mates at school Fleur and Cedric. But the best person by far was Hermione Granger who at the going-away party looked at Viktor with the deepest heartache a fifteen-year-old girl could muster.<br/>
Where Sirius' lawn was dried out, weathered down and with an unfixed doorbell to top it off, the Granger's lawn was tended-to, freshly cut and beautifully grown. He had seen her lawn every morning when he took out the bike to get to school, building up a fear of meeting Sirius' neighbours, even though Sirius had informed him many-a-time that the Granger's were absolutely wonderful, they do everything for me! When the day came, after a week or so, that Harry, Ron and Hermione were sitting around Sirius' dining table doing homework, Viktor knew right away that she had to be Hermione Granger. It was in her poise, in the way she had pinched her upper lip, and her pulled back curly hair. She was so proper, but she was so enchanting with her beautiful brown eyes and her glowing complexion.<br/>
"Hermione, have you done french Homework yet?" Ron asked.<br/>
"Are you kidding me? It was due yesterday..," Hermione answered.<br/>
"Hey Viktor." Harry said, having finally noticed Viktor who was stood silently in the doorway.<br/>
"Er- hi." Viktor said, before he mentally berated himself for being so awkward. He closed the door behind him and took off his shoes.<br/>
When he had looked down however, Hermione had looked up. She saw an older boy and noticed his short hair, his heavy brow and his still thin teenage body in a sweater too spacious for him. She bit her lip.<br/>
When Viktor was at the going-away party he couldn't help but think back to that day, when the autumn weather hadn't yet quite settled in, when the following year was yet waiting to happen. It seemed so long ago, although he remembered it like it was yesterday. While Hermione was sat with Ginny, nursing her tea sadly and appearing deep in melancholia for a reason nobody knew but herself and Viktor, he stood among an older crowd talking to Cedric, Fleur and Bill. Both of them stole glances at each other without the other knowing.<br/>
When the party ended, Hermione was one of the first to leave. Originally she had wanted to get him alone, so she could give him one last goodbye kiss, but she got scared and went home instead.<br/>
Later though, when everybody had left and it was half an hour till Sirius had to drive Viktor to the airport, Viktor went up to the Granger's house and he didn't even have to ring their doorbell before Hermione opened up, having mustered up the courage to go speak to him.<br/>
"Er- Hi Viktor," She said.<br/>
"Hi," He answered his accent thick, "where ere you going at dis lete hour?"<br/>
"I was going to meet you, actually," she blurted out.<br/>
"Oh," he said.<br/>
"Yep," she said<br/>
"Well- I just wanehted to geeve you a proper gudbye. Er-" He said, hinting at the door behind her. She closed the door and they went to stand by her fence, further away from her parents.<br/>
"I was thinking the same thing," she said, giving him a small smile.<br/>
"Hermione," He said<br/>
"Yes?"<br/>
"Come visit mi in Bulgaria," he said, gripping the fence and leaning closer to her.<br/>
"I can't, Viktor. I don't want to," she answered for the last time, looking at the ground.<br/>
"Why not?" He asked with a smile on his face, as they'd had the conversation so many times it was funny to him.<br/>
"It's too far... and I'm going with my family to France," she said, still not looking up.<br/>
"Fuck France," he said.<br/>
"I will if you keep asking me to," she said, finally looking up with a teasing grin on her face.<br/>
"You'd forgo mi so fast?" He chuckled, but not because he found it funny.<br/>
"Yea," she said, even though it wasn't true. Then she reached up and kissed him. It was different from the chaste kisses he had stolen in the daylight of Hermione's bedroom before, under the pretense he was helping her with maths homework. It was different from their first kiss, when Hermione had grabbed his face clumsily while Harry visited the bathroom. It was different from the long lazy kisses he had given her when he knew she wanted them just as much as he did. It was different because it was filled with longing and loneliness and greed.<br/>
"Write mi? Please?" he said when it was done, which made her giggle.<br/>
"Yes, Victor, of course I'll write you," she said. Then he leaned back in to kiss what he knew he would never kiss again.</p><p>The next morning Hermione was fast asleep in her bed and Viktor was far far away.</p>
