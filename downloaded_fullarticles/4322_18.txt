    <p>Dean wasn’t bad at walking.<br/>Even when it had been snowing.</p><p>But his best friend and life-long crush Seamus was.<br/>Especially when it had been snowing.</p><p>Shouts sounded behind him, and Dean slowly turned around to ask what was the matter when he saw Seamus sliding down the hill leading towards Hagrid’s hut.<br/>The only thing blocking him from a smooth slide down was<br/>Dean.</p><p>‘Move! Run! Run!’ Seamus was shouting,<br/> and Dean blinked,<br/> one second of perfect clarity,<br/>before Seamus collided harshly with him.</p><p>He fell face first on the ground, automatically holding out his hands to cushion his fall, but his head collided with a rock with a harsh <em> crack </em> that sounded sickening in Dean’s mind. Then everything faded.</p><p>⇄<br/> <br/> Dean sure enough recognised the Hospital wing. <br/> <br/> Its view was quickly obscured by Seamus’ face though. <br/>Happiness and knee-buckling relief filled Dean.</p><p>‘You’re awake!’ Seamus exclaimed loudly, a relieved smile spreading across his slightly blurry face.<br/> <br/> Dean blinked to try and erase the blur, but his vision remained hazy. <br/> <br/> ‘I don’t… see you clearly,’ Dean tried. <br/> Talking was also difficult. Like his tongue suddenly weighed tons more. <br/> <br/> ‘Am I a looker now?’ Seamus grinned. <br/> <br/> Dean laughed tiredly. <br/> <em> You always are.<br/> </em> <br/> The sound of heels clicking on the floor approached them, and Dean heard Madam Pomfrey telling Seamus to get lost. <br/> <br/> ‘You’ve done enough damage as is,’ she scolded him. <br/> <br/> Even though his vision was still blurred, Dean somehow knew Seamus was gone, a strangely hollow feeling filling his chest. <br/> It was a stark contrast with the happiness and relief he’d felt earlier. <br/> <br/>‘Sorry, Mr. Thomas,’ Pomfrey said. ‘But you’re going under again.’</p><p>‘‘S okay,’ Dean mumbled. ‘Wake me when Seamus’s here.’</p><p>He didn’t hear her reply.<br/> <br/>⇄</p><p>Dean woke up to an uncomfortable pain in his chest and left arm. He groaned as he tried to sit up, looking for Madam Pomfrey, but it was darker now and his vision was still blurred around the edges.<br/> <br/>The pain didn’t go away however.</p><p>It only got worse,<br/> and Dean’s left arm started itching, not in the way it normally did when he wanted to pick up a pencil to sketch,<br/> but like it had been burnt. <br/> <br/> ‘Madam-’ Dean tried, but his throat was intensely dry after not drinking for who knows how long. <br/> <br/> He fell back onto his bed again. <br/> <br/> The pain was now very uncomfortable. <br/> He had no idea how he was going to get through the night. Turning onto his side, Dean tried to get comfortable, to maybe sleep some more,<br/>when his eye fell on the sleeping draught on his nightstand.</p><p>Oh thank goodness.</p><p>Dean reached out with his uncomfortably itchy left hand and knocked back the draught.<br/> <br/> The pain was still present when his eyes started feeling heavy, and it was still uncomfortable when he eventually fell asleep. <br/> <br/>⇄</p><p>Uncomfortable<br/> was an understatement when Dean woke up again. <br/> <br/> Because light assaulted his eyes, he concluded it was morning, but that was about as far as his conscious got before he groaned in pain, curling in on himself to stop it from hurting. <br/> <br/> His left arm however didn’t cooperate anymore, lying oddly beside his body, feeling cold and stiff. <br/> It would probably concern him more if he wasn’t so focused on desperately trying to stop himself from hurting. <br/> <br/> ‘What are you feeling right now?’ <br/> <br/>Madam Pomfrey’s urgent voice sounded through the pained haze.</p><p>‘Pain,’ Dean groaned.</p><p>‘Can you tell me where?’<br/> <br/> ‘Every-’ Dean started,<br/> but then he heard hurried footsteps,<br/> felt impatience and concern,<br/> and somehow, through the haze, saw Seamus running towards him.</p><p>It must be some kind of miracle, because the pain slowly lessened.<br/> <br/>‘You need to leave, Mr. Finnegan,’ Madam Pomfrey said, shielding Dean slightly with her body. ‘He’s having a fit of some sort.’</p><p>‘No,’ Dean managed, trying to sit up. His left arm still wasn’t cooperating though. ‘No, it’s getting better.’<br/> <br/> Madam Pomfrey turned on him with a skeptical look in her eyes. <br/> Dean realized with a start that the blur had also vanished.<br/> <br/> ‘Really?’ <br/> <br/> ‘It’s just my arm now,’ Dean said. <br/> <br/> ‘Can you move it?’ Seamus asked, stepping around Madam Pomfrey and sitting on the chair next to Dean’s bed. <br/> <br/> ‘Don’t think so,’ Dean said, trying to make a fist with his hand. <br/>His fingers twitched, but otherwise didn’t move.</p><p>Seamus looked at them in concern.<br/> ‘They’re not really moving.’ <br/> <br/> Madam Pomfrey sighed. <br/> ‘Is the pain gone, Mr. Thomas?’ <br/> <br/>‘No, still there in my left arm.’ Dean said. ‘It’s just bearable now.’</p><p>‘I’ll try to find something against the stiffness,’ Madam Pomfrey said. ‘Try moving your hand some more.’</p><p>With that she left.</p><p>Try as Dean might, he couldn’t really move his fingers more than an awkward wiggle.<br/> <br/> ‘What happened?’ he asked instead. <br/> <br/> Seamus shifted on his chair, obviously uncomfortable. <br/> ‘Me an’ Neville were goofing around, but then he accidentally pushed me and I tripped. Collided with you. You fell pretty badly, there was like this huge gash on your forehead, mate. I tried to patch you up, but-’ <br/> <br/>‘Wait,’ Dean interrupted him. ‘You tried to patch me up? You don’t know any healing spells.’</p><p>‘I panicked!’ Seamus exclaimed. ‘You were bleeding heavily an’ I thought you were going to die or something. So I just pointed my wand at you... Can’t really remember anything else, ‘part from this bright orange light. But the bleeding didn’t stop.’</p><p>‘You just pointed your wand at me?’ <br/> Dean had trouble keeping up with Seamus’ logic.<br/> ‘You do know you usually blow things up when you point your wand at them, right?’ <br/> <br/>‘I know,’ Seamus looked down at Dean’s hand, and there was a sadness in his eyes that Dean had never seen before. It looked horrible, and he wished he hadn’t argued about this. ‘I was just scared. Like I said... I don’t want you to be… gone, y’know?’</p><p>Something clenched inside Dean, and he felt a terrible sadness wash over him.<br/> <br/> ‘I’m here though,’ Dean said. ‘So you must’ve done something right.’</p><p>‘Yeah,’ Seamus smiled, but it was still a sad smile.</p><p>Still, making an effort to be cheerful again, Seamus reached out and bumped Dean’s left hand with his own.  <br/> <br/>‘Mate, that was the worst fistbump ever,’ Seamus commented. ‘You’ve got to try harder than that.’</p><p>Dean wanted to reply, but something strange had happened when Seamus had touched his hand.</p><p>Feeling flooded back into Dean’s fingers, slowly but surely.<br/> When Dean tried to move them now, they could almost bend all the way.<br/> <br/>‘Do that again!’ Dean said to Seamus.</p><p>So Seamus reached out and bumped their fists together again.<br/> This time, Dean could almost return the gesture. <br/> <br/>‘Woah,’ Dean said. ‘I can feel my arm again. It happened right after you touched me.’</p><p>‘For real?’ <br/> <br/> Seamus reached out, but instead of bumping their fists together, simply laid his hand on top of Dean’s. <br/> <br/> Feeling,<br/> warm and tingly,<br/> burst through Dean’s hand and shot through his arm,<br/>and Dean suspected he could move everything again if he tried.</p><p>‘How’s that?’ Seamus asked.</p><p>And all of a sudden, the situation was brought to the forefront of Dean’s mind.</p><p>They were holding hands.</p><p>A blush spread across Dean’s cheeks, and his stomach swirled.<br/> <em> It’s wonderful. </em> <em> <br/> </em> <br/>‘Better,’ he said instead, not meeting Seamus’ eyes. ‘I think I can move it again.’</p><p>When Seamus pulled his hand back, Dean’s arm felt colder, but when he tried to move it,<br/> it cooperated completely. <br/> He pushed himself upright. <br/> <br/> ‘Alright. Thanks.’ <br/> <br/>‘No problem, mate.’</p><p>‘So,’ Dean started. ‘You have no idea what kind of spell you hit me with?’</p><p>Seamus sighed miserably.</p><p>‘No clue.’</p><p>Suddenly his eyes widened.<br/>‘Think that,’ he nodded to Dean’s arm. ‘Had something to do with the spell?’</p><p>‘Could be,’ Dean mused,<br/>but he felt like that might also be an understatement.</p><p>⇄<br/> <br/> ‘If all goes well tonight, you can leave tomorrow.’ <br/> <br/> Dean trusted Madam Pomfrey to know what was right for him, but still, he dreaded waking up in the evening to the mysterious, uncomfortable pain. <br/> <br/>‘Can you leave a sleeping draught on my nightstand again?’ he asked.</p><p>⇄</p><p>And was glad for it.</p><p>Because again, Dean’s eyes flew open, only to see vaguely in the darkness.</p><p>His body was hurting and aching,<br/> a mysterious pain that made him feel hollow,<br/> made him want to curl up,<br/> and his left arm was lying uselessly on the bed. <br/> Awkwardly pushing himself up, he tried to reach for the draught, but a shock of pain made his body spasm and he lost his balance, nearly toppling out of bed. <br/> <br/> Dean sobbed, but gritted his teeth and tried again, hand stretching towards the draught when-<br/> Someone gave it to him. <br/> <br/> Frantic as he was to drink it, Dean didn’t register who it was until he’d chucked the potion down. <br/> <br/> Eyes wide and frightened,<br/> Seamus was sitting next to the bed, wearing his pyjamas, and his hand was grasping Dean’s tightly. <br/> <br/> Only now did Dean notice that his pain was already receding, <br/> but before he could comment on it, he fell asleep again. <br/> <br/>⇄</p><p>‘Think you’re up to going back to your lessons?’ Pomfrey asked.<br/> <br/>‘Yeah…’</p><p>She laid his clothes on the bed. <br/>‘So last night went okay?’</p><p>The only thing Dean remembered about last night was panic<br/> pain<br/> and then the pain receding when Seamus had held his hand. <br/> Which sounded absurd, because where had Seamus come from? <br/>It had probably been a fever dream.</p><p>‘Yep,’ Dean said cheerfully. <br/> <br/> ⇄<br/> <br/> The relief Dean felt when he saw Seamus was unnaturally strong,<br/>but he thought he saw it echoed in Seamus’ smile as well.</p><p>‘Good to have you back, mate.’</p><p>‘Thanks for hexing me into the hospital in the first place,’ Dean teased.</p><p>‘Naw, no problem,’ Seamus grinned, and together they started walking towards their Charms lesson. ‘Hope you enjoyed the few days off.’</p><p>Dean laughed.<br/>‘It was nice, but please don’t do it again.’</p><p>‘I’ll say,’ Neville added, joining them. ‘Gave us all a good fright there.’</p><p>‘Yeah, it’s different without you in our room,’ Seamus nodded.<br/> <br/> ‘You mean without someone telling you you should go to bed?’  Dean teased,<br/> but it felt oddly nice to be missed.<br/> <br/> ⇄<br/> <br/> The strangest thing, however, happened a few days later. <br/> <br/> Dean was out practicing with Ginny, partly because he felt like getting some fresh air and partly because he missed flying.<br/> They were just chasing each other around, a bit of horseplay at the end of their practice before they needed to get back to the castle, when Dean’s left arm suddenly started hurting <em> badly </em>.</p><p>Just like in the hospital, Dean’s control over it quickly lessened, until his arm just hung painfully against the side of body.</p><p>‘Dean!’ Ginny yelled in concern, already flying towards him. ‘Are you okay?’<br/> <br/> Dean grit his teeth against the waves of pain assaulting his body. <br/> ‘No.’ <br/> <br/>‘Let’s get down.’</p><p>Ginny grabbed his broom with one hand and together, they slowly flew to the ground.</p><p>Stepping off his broom, Dean nearly fell to his knees from the pain, but Ginny quickly supported him, throwing his right arm over her shoulder.</p><p>‘We’re going to the hospital wing,’ she said, trying to sound reassuring, but Dean could tell she was stressed. ‘Madame Pomfrey’ll know what to do.’</p><p>Dean wasn’t so sure.</p><p>If only Seamus could hold his hand or something.<br/>That seemed to work last time.</p><p>⇄</p><p>It was like Dean had used <em> accio </em> , because while they were walking on the staircases, Seamus came running their way, eyes wide in panic as he saw the way Dean was slumped against Ginny. <br/> <br/>It seemed like too much of a coincidence, but Dean didn’t know what else it could be.</p><p>‘Can you support his other side?’ Ginny asked, voice sounding strained from holding Dean upright. ‘We’ll get him to Pomfrey. Be careful, that side’s painful.’</p><p>And then the strangest thing happened.<br/> <br/>When Seamus gripped Dean’s left arm, draping it over his shoulder, all the pain seemed to leave Dean’s body, and he could once again move his arm.</p><p>Now, Seamus finding them had been a lucky coincidence,<br/>but Seamus relieving Dean’s pain every time he touched him probably wasn’t.</p><p>Dean sighed in relief at the absence of pain, subconsciously slumping against Seamus.</p><p>‘What happened?’ Ginny asked frantically.</p><p>‘I think…’ Seamus said slowly, like he was also figuring out what Dean just realized. ‘That he’s passed out.’</p><p>Or not.</p><p>‘I’m not passed out,’ Dean protested weakly. ‘Doesn’t hurt anymore.’</p><p>‘It doesn’t?’ Ginny asked in surprise. ‘Do you think you can stand?’</p><p>Dean really wanted to lean against Seamus for a bit longer, but that was bordering on creepy, so he said,<br/>‘Yeah, think so.’</p><p>They both released him carefully, like he was a toddler who just learned how to stand, but Dean managed.</p><p>‘I’m okay,’ he said, trying to smile reassuringly.</p><p>He was met with two tight faces, looking at him in concern. <br/>Yeah, if Dean was them, he would probably be worried too.</p><p>‘Let’s go to the common room,’ he proposed.<br/> <br/>The entire way there, he felt Ginny and Seamus watching his back apprehensively. When he let himself fall on the couch near the common room’s fireplace, they finally seemed to relax.</p><p>‘Alright,’ Ginny said, leaning forward. Because she was sitting next to him, she was all the more difficult to ignore. ‘Tell me what that was.’</p><p>‘Um,’ Dean said nervously. <br/> <br/>‘‘Twas my fault,’ Seamus immediately spoke up. ‘Crashed into him outside and panicked when I saw he’d nearly broken his head, so I shot a spell at him.’</p><p>‘What spell?’</p><p>‘Dunno.’</p><p>‘Excuse me?’ Ginny asked, perplexed.</p><p>Seamus nervously ran a hand through his hair, which made it stand up a bit.<br/>It looked ridiculously cute, and Dean’s heart jumped inside his chest.</p><p>Seamus gave him a strange look, before replying, ‘I mean, I don’t know. I just fired something at ‘im, thinking how I wanted the wound to close.’</p><p>‘Huh,’ Ginny said,<br/>and Dean could tell from the expression on her face that she was lost in thought.</p><p>‘And after the spell, Dean got random bursts of pain?’ Ginny asked a moment later.</p><p>‘Yep,’ Dean nodded.</p><p>‘But why did it stop?’</p><p>Oh, this was the awkward part.<br/> <br/> ‘I think it’s because Seamus touched me- my hand,’ Dean stammered.<br/> <br/> ‘Really?’ Seamus asked in surprise. <br/> <br/>Oh, he really hadn’t figured it out.</p><p>Nodding, Dean couldn’t quite meet his eyes, feeling a blush creeping onto his cheeks.<br/> He thanked his darker skin for making it more difficult to see if he was blushing. <br/>Too bad Seamus knew him inside out.</p><p>‘Guess I got a magic touch,’ Seamus laughed.<br/> <br/> Dean blushed madly,<br/> but made appropriate gasping noises that could pass for laughing. <br/> <br/>⇄</p><p>‘Mate,’ Seamus whispered in the darkness. ‘You still awake?’</p><p>Dean turned to face Seamus.</p><p>‘Yeah,’ he whispered back.</p><p>‘D’you reckon it had something to do with my spell?’</p><p>‘The pain?’<br/> <br/>‘I meant me touchin’ you, but now that you mention it...’</p><p>Dean sighed. <br/> <br/> Seamus was quiet for a while, and Dean was already drifting off to sleep before Seamus finally asked,<br/>‘Does it hurt now?’</p><p>‘No.’</p><p>‘Oh…’</p><p>Dean’s mind was already spiralling down into sleepy, barely formed thoughts before Seamus’ voice startled him awake again.<br/> <br/> ‘You wake me up when it starts hurting, yeah?’ <br/> <br/>‘Yeah,’ Dean murmured sleepily.</p><p>⇄<br/> <br/> But it didn’t. <br/> <br/> Dean woke up the next morning feeling better than ever. <br/> Relief flooded him, the same knee-buckling, all encompassing relief like before. <br/> It felt strangely out of place. <br/> <br/> When he turned towards his trunk, he saw Seamus watching him. <br/> That was strange. <br/> It was normally the other way around. <br/> <br/>‘Good morning,’ Dean said.</p><p>Startled out of his staring, Seamus gave Dean a big, bright smile.</p><p>‘Morning, mate! Feeling okay?’</p><p>‘Never been better,’ Dean smiled.</p><p>‘Knew it,’ Seamus said, and he sounded <em> very </em> relieved. <br/> <br/> ⇄<br/> <br/>‘Where’re you going?’ Seamus asked, peering over the top of his book at Dean, who was collecting all his pencils, putting them back into his case.</p><p>‘Flying with Ginny,’ Dean replied, clicking his pencil case shut and moving to his feet. <br/> <br/> A sudden feeling of unease filled his mind, and he wondered why. <br/> <br/>‘Sure yer going to be alright?’ Seamus asked, sounding uneasy.</p><p>Dean narrowed his eyes.<br/> Something about this seemed a little too coincidental.<br/> <br/> ‘Mate?’ Seamus pressed, and he really did seem nervous and worried, fingers pulling at his sleeves. <br/> <br/>‘Yeah, I’m sure,’ Dean replied. ‘I’ll only be gone an hour or what.’</p><p>Yet Seamus still looked at him like he wanted to ask something.<br/> <br/> After a minute, Dean felt a bit awkward standing there for so long, in complete silence,<br/> so he took a hesitant step towards the exit.<br/> <br/>‘Oh,’ Seamus called out after him, and Dean turned around expectantly. ‘Want me to, er, touch you?’</p><p><em> Oh sweet death. </em> <em> <br/> </em> Dean already saw the headlines. <br/> “Student at Hogwarts killed by burst of hormones” <br/> <br/> ‘W-what?’ he stammered.</p><p>‘I mean yer hand,’ Seamus said quickly. ‘Since I made the pain go away an’ all that.’</p><p><em> Yes </em> , Dean’s heart swooned. <br/>But there was a reason Dean didn’t listen to his heart all that often.</p><p>‘It’s not hurting right now though.’</p><p>‘Good, good,’ Seamus nodded anxiously.<br/> <br/> Dean saw there was a faint pinkish tint to his cheeks and felt his heart do a flip inside his chest. <br/>Seamus was concerned about him, wanted to help him, and Dean was turning him down?</p><p>‘But I guess it couldn’t hurt…’ he said slowly.</p><p>Seamus sat up excitedly.<br/> ‘Yeah, for good luck an’ all that, yeah?’ <br/> <br/> Feeling incredibly nervous, Dean walked over to Seamus, who was already holding out his hand. <br/> Dean swallowed.<br/>Right.</p><p>He was sure Seamus saw his hand shaking as he reached out, but if he did then he didn’t comment on it.</p><p>Dean grabbed Seamus’ hand carefully,<br/> and then they were holding hands again, for the second time in a month.<br/> <br/> Dean’s heart was pounding wildly in his chest as he tried not to notice too much,<br/> as he tried not to watch Seamus’ face, or their hands. <br/> <br/> Then Seamus brushed his thumb softly against Dean’s knuckles and the sensation <em> shot </em> through Dean’s body with an electricity that was totally inappropriate for the moment. <br/> <br/>Dean instantly took back his hand.</p><p>‘Thanks,’ he said quickly, not meeting Seamus’ eyes.</p><p>‘Good luck flying with Ginny,’ Seamus said happily.<br/> <br/> Dean took that as his cue to not quite run out of the common room. <br/> <br/> ⇄ </p>
