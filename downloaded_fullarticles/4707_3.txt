    <p>"Hogwarts, seal the school. Do not let anyone leave or enter until I ask you to let them." Everyone in the Great Hall heard and felt all access seal the school.</p>
<p>Everyone looked around to see who this was coming from. Surprisingly, it came from a small, skinny boy with black messy hair and bright green eyes. And atrocious glasses.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter! What are you playing at? This is a school, not your personal residence." Minerva McGonagel snaped.</p>
<p>Harry didn't respond to her. Nor did he respond to Hermione who was trying to make him sit down and shut up. He, finally, turned to her and told her to leave him alone and be quiet. Her face flushed red, her eyes started to water, but she stopped talking and sat back down in her seat. Ron, however, was still turning bright red as his anger mounted. Harry was doing something, again, without involving him it. This was not right. Harry was supposed to be his best friend. Ron was supposed to be involved so that Ron got the attention that Harry seemed to not want.</p>
<p>Neville, Luna, the Twins and, surprisingly, Draco, looked interested to hear what Harry had to say, and see what else happened.</p>
<p>"Hogwarts, restrict the voices of, and bind Umbridge and Dumbledore."  Suddenly, both staff members were wrapped in ropes, trapped in their seats and, while their mouths were open, no sound came out. A gasp went up across the Great Hall at this. What was the Boy-Who-Lied doing now? They would be sending owls to their parents as soon as they left breakfast. He wasn't supposed to be doing things like this at all.</p>
<p>"Hogwarts, show them who I am." At that, Harry was surrounded by a golden light and all four founders's houses badges showed on his robes - and glowed. Fawkes appeared on his shoulder and visibly bonded with him. Hedwig appeared on his other shoulder and the birds greeted each other.</p>
<p>"During a Gringotts visit last summer, I discovered that I am the Heir of all four founders. I discovered that I actually own this castle, Hogsmead, and the Forbidden Forest. For those of you who have parents on the Board of Governor's, please be aware that they are being notified today that the Board has been disbanded. The Board was set up for when the founders heirs were not available to administer for the school. I am thinking of setting up another Board of Governor's to deal with certain issues like staffing.</p>
<p>"Madam Umbridge, the Ministry of Magic does not, and has never, had the right to a say about Hogwarts whatsoever. You will be leaving this castle in a few hours. You will be taken to a holding cell in the Ministry of Magic, by Aurors, because of your illegal use of blood quills on the students here. The house-elves will be packing up your office and housing and taking it to the head of the DMLE. The elves have already found quite a few illegal items in both your office and living quarters. You will not be allowed to step foot in this school ever again. You betrayed the very basics of teaching. You harmed, with vicious intent, the students you were hired to teach. Personally, I would be very surprised to see you ever leave Azkaban. If Fudge has truly signed off on what you have been doing, he will be put on trial, too."</p>
<p>Umbridge, at being addressed thusly, went ballistic. Thankfully she was still restrained and muffled. But the hate coming from her was very clear. And it was all directed on Harry.</p>
<p>By this time, the students in the Great Hall were not making even a small sound. They wanted to watch what was happening so that they could send the details to their parents. They were, also, delighted that the pink toad was being forced to leave their school, and was being forced to stop torturing the students.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the doors to the Great Hall slammed open, letting Madam Bones, the head of the DMLE, along with a contingent of Aurors into the castle. She looked around at the Great Hall. Took in the silence of the students and the staff. She, also, saw Umbridge on the dais roped and silenced. Raising one eyebrow, she turned to Harry.</p>
<p>"Lord Hogwarts, I received a message that you requested my presence on a criminal matter. Would you care to explain?" The students were now whispering about the latest revelation. </p>
<p>Zacharias Smith stood up and yelled, "You are not a Lord, let alone Lord Hogwarts. All you are is an attention seeking half-blood."</p>
<p>Harry smirked and said that if he really disbelieved that he was Lord Hogwarts, then the was going to have some major problems with the rest of the school year, because he had already taken control of the castle and school, with Hogwarts full cooperation.</p>
<p>Harry turned to the Headmaster. "Dumbledore, you have several options, unlike Umbridge. Like her, you have tortured the students here by manipulating their lives in some kind of power game. I have pensieve memories going back 50 years to prove it." At this, Dumbledore paled and tried to speak. "You are no longer Headmaster. I will find a replacement for Headmaster, hopefully within the next week. While Umbridge has been cleared out of her office and living area in anticipation of her leaving this school, you have been cleared out of your office and living area and your things have been moved to a monitored guest room. I and the staff will be interviewing. In fact, there are several job openings that we need to interview for. The options for you - you may choose to apply for a teaching position is you have a mastery in the subject. You may apply to become a Teacher's Assistant if you don't have a mastery in the subject. You may not apply to be a Head of House. You do not have my, or Hogwarts's, approval of you having so much control over the students. I will continue this discussion in a few moments, after Umbridge is dealt with."</p>
<p>Harry turned to the Head of the DMLE and walked over to hand her a list of the detentions the Umbridge had done, and what they resulted in. He handed her photo's on the effects of the blood quills. Harry, also, handed her a package of Umbridge's Decree's and who they were countersigned by. Fudge. "Rita Skeeter has a copy of all this and will be publishing it in the Daily Prophet. Please don't try to stop her. We are trying to make sure that these get prosecuted to the full extent of the law. If all of this is published, it will be more difficult to simply dismiss the charges. There is, also, a certified set of copies in Gringotts. The Goblins are NOT happy that this has been happening and will do everything within their considerable power to make sure that this is stopped and that it never happens again." He handed Bones the list of illegal items that were found within Umbridge's office and living area, also.</p>
<p>Madam Bones, and the Auror's, retrieved Umbridge from the teacher's dais and left. Bones had a shark-like smile as she left. She'd been wanting to take Delores down for a very long time.</p>
