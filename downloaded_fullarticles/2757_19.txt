    <p>A rapid pounding on the door startles Sirius so that he falls off the platform and into the lava below for the fifth time in a row. Cursing, he throws the controller behind him on the couch and stomps over toward the door, annoyed both with the level he’s been stuck on and the unexpected interruption. The knocking pauses, before picking up even louder than before.</p><p>“I’M COMING, HOLD ON!” he hollers at the door down the hall. Pausing just long enough to peer through the peephole and be vaguely certain the person isn’t there to murder him, he yanks the door open just before they can bring their closed fist down on the door again. “What?” he demands.</p><p>The man in front of him squares his shoulders, nostrils flaring. “Don’t even fucking start with that attitude, as if I’m some sort of inconvenience to <em> you </em> after everything you’ve done to fuck over my life, you, you-”</p><p>Sirius blinks in surprise, recovering just before the man can charge on. “Look, I’m sorry I took the last bag of crisps from Tesco yesterday, I can definitely see how that would put you in such a strop on a Friday night.”</p><p>He smirks when the man’s eyes go even wider, mouth gaping open and closed like a fish while he searches for a response. Sirius crosses his arms and leans in the doorframe, waiting with mock patience for him to respond. “You think this is a bloody <em> joke?” </em></p><p>Inspecting his fingernails, Sirius tries to scrape out the charcoal stuck there to no avail. He’s not entirely sure why he tries, since it just ends up there again the next time he’s in the studio, but in the moment it feels like the right thing to annoy the stranger who so rudely interrupted his lazy Friday night. “The only joke I see here is that swotty cardigan.”</p><p>The other’s face flushes red with a violent blush and Sirius <em> almost </em> feels bad, because yeah alright, maybe that was a bit insulting if you don’t know Sirius and his brand of playful humour. He pushes away the feeling though, because this bastard is the one who was pounding on his door just to start hollering at him for no apparent reason. He’s never even seen the man before.</p><p>“Yeah, sure, steal my bird and then insult my clothing. Why not?” He waves a hand flippantly but Sirius stands up shocked.</p><p>“Wait, what?”</p><p>“Which part are you confused by?” the man seethes, eyes narrowed dangerously. “The part where I know you’re sleeping with my girl, or the part where you insulted my clothes two seconds ago.”</p><p>“The first - I’m very aware about the cardigan joke.”</p><p>“There’s no point in playing dumb, I fucking know.” The other sighs, all of the wind gone from his sails, shoulders slumping as he rakes a hand through disheveled curls, damp from the spitting mist outside. “Reversed the number on her phone found the billing address.”</p><p>“I didn’t steal your girl, mate. I mean, I’m fucking sorry because that’s horrible, but it wasn’t me.” A snarl pulls up the others lip, he glares with disdain, but Sirius holds his hands up before he can continue. “I’m <em> gay, </em> for fucks sake. Like, <em> really, really, </em> gay. You’ve got the wrong bloke.”</p><p>Face slack, eyes rake over him and Sirius is suddenly acutely aware of the fact he didn’t bother to put on a shirt and is standing in his baggiest joggers and barefoot. “Oh,” the man replies eloquently. He licks his lips, then digs a note from his pocket, the handwriting on it hurried and thick from too much pressure. “So you’re not, Benjy Fenwick?”</p><p>Sirius freezes midway through fidgeting with his hair, his heart similarly feels as if it has stops in his chest. “No…” he says slowly, leaning to peer at the note as if it will be different than what the man has said out loud. “But that’s my boyfriend’s name…”</p><p>“Oh. <em> Oh. </em>” Eyes wide, the man looks horrified and guilty, despite having done nothing wrong aside from interrupting Sirius’ night and accusing him of cheating with his girlfriend. And turn Sirius’ world upside down. He shoves the note toward Sirius, who verifies that, yes, that is Benjy’s phone number, and name, and Sirius’ address on the paper.</p><p>“Well,” Sirius says heavily, shoving all of his swirling emotions away into a box to be dealt with later over a bottle of scotch. “I was just playing some Super Mario Brothers, but it looks like I have some redecorating to attend to. Did you have any plans for your evening or do you feel like helping? Might help with your own anger, since you didn’t get to properly yell.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’d actually love to lend a hand,” he answers with relish. “Remus Lupin, by the way. And, sorry for shouting. And almost breaking down your door.”</p><p>Sirius shrugs nonchalauntly, as if both happen on the regular. “Sirius Black. Come on in.” He stands back, gesturing the other into the apartment. “Luckily we have nice weather for this.” Finding a jumper he had left draped over the sofa, Sirius throws open the balcony door and ignores the way the fine mist immediately wets the floor. He peers down at the empty lawn beyond the railing before returning to Remus who is still watching him with a certain level of guilt. “I’ll pile stuff for you of his and you can have the pleasure of tossing it out front?”</p><p>Remus nods wordlessly and Sirius sets to work, collecting the things that Benjy has accumulated in his apartment over the 9 months they’ve been dating. Clothes and books, toiletries, coffee mugs, and that ugly painting of a cat in a top hat that Sirius loathes because he is a <em> dog person thank you very much. </em>At first Remus just drops the items gingerly over the railing, but when he starts really getting into it, throwing things with more force and spreading it across the lawn beside the walk up, Sirius can’t help but grin. He throws the stupid cat painting himself, the last thing to go, and rests his elbows on the balcony next to Remus.</p><p>“What a sight that is,” he admires, bumping his shoulder against the other. “Great job. Thank you for the help.”</p><p>“I’m sure you could have handled it yourself,” Remus mumbles, fidgeting with his cardigan sleeves. “But thank you for letting me help. Felt pretty good. Probably better than yelling.”</p><p>“Did you not do the same with her stuff?”</p><p>Remus’ shoulders slump, but he follows Sirius back into the flat when he tugs on him gently by the elbow, pulling him out of the rain that has started coming down with conviction. Sirius indulges himself with thoughts of Freyr bringing his wrath down on Benjy’s possessions for his virile infidelity.</p><p>“No, I came from texting her to have her things out by the time I get back home. I thought if I came and yelled at him… well, I don’t know, what I thought to be honest.”</p><p>“I don’t blame you. I’m not entirely sure what I think either.”</p><p>“Had you any idea?”</p><p>“None. Wonder if that’s where he’s at right now, helping her get her shite for your place and no idea his is out in that sodden mess.” Sirius tries to laugh, but falls short, instead settling for crossing to the kitchen pulling out a hardly touched bottle of scotch and two glasses. “Have a drink with me?”</p><p>Remus hesitates. “I’d hate to further impose on your night.”</p><p>“No imposition. Friendly drink among commiserators, hmm?” He shakes the bottle in temptation while Super Mario Bros pause music taunts them merrily in the background.</p><p>A drink and a half later of Sirius’ best single malt sees them on the sofa, backs against each arm to face each other with a plush blanket thrown across their laps. The alcohol has long since stopped to burn and Sirius just sighs in pleasure at the pleasant heat as another swallow warms his belly.</p><p>“At least you hadn’t been together long?” he offers, knowing that it’s very little by means of consolement to this kind of hurt.</p><p>Remus scoffs, staring into the amber liquid before taking a hearty swig. “Honestly, I’m not even upset she’s gone, just pissed she cheated. Like, what’s the fucking point in that? Just break up and whatever, don’t cheat.”</p><p>“Right!” Sirius agrees vehemently, pushing himself more upright with his elbows, leaning forward with intensity in his gaze. “You deserve way better than that, what a bitch move. I mean, I guess especially since you haven’t been together that long? Just call it off and move on. How did you even meet her?”</p><p>Rubbing the bridge of his nose, Remus has his eyes closed and Sirius takes the opportunity to really study the man without drawing attention to the fact his eyes are lingering. He could always blame it on the alcohol, and with that in mind takes another sip.</p><p>“She’s the coworker of a good friend who says I have shite taste in men.”</p><p>Sirius chokes a bit on his drink, the other’s soft green eyes opening in amused concern.</p><p>“Yes, I’m bisexual. Though, I take it you don’t have a problem with the principle itself, although perhaps have more of a problem with it than usual at this particular moment.” He looks away, pulling the sleeves of that damn cardigan down over his hands and wrapping them around the glass, cradling it like a crux.</p><p>“Benjy’s a right asshole, but that doesn’t reflect on all bisexuals,” he says darkly. “My best mate’s wife is bi and I have choice words for anyone who shows a lick of biphobia.”</p><p>Remus chuckles with relief and sinks lower into the corner of the couch. His feet are tucked between Sirius’ side and the back cushion. Sirius doesn’t even think as he settles his hand on them, absently stroking a wool covered ankle.</p><p>“I didn’t mean it about your cardigan, by the way.” Remus raises an eyebrow in mocking question, the edge of his lip twitching in amusement. “Well, no, I did mean it. It’s a right swotty sweater, but I realised as soon as I said it you didn’t know me or that I was just playing or that I don’t think swot is a bad thing. What I’m saying is, I didn’t mean it to be offensive, and I had no idea your girl had been cheating on you and I was adding insult to injury.”</p><p>The other man just shrugs and drains the rest of his glass. Sirius leans over the edge of the couch to make an ill fated acrobatic grab for the bottle, narrowly missing the corner of the coffee table and shouting a triumphant <em> ah hah! </em>while still dangling awkwardly. After righting himself, he holds the bottle aloft, bowing as best he can, like a knight returning from slaying a fire breathing dragon with the scotch as his trophy to the roaring crowd of Remus’ unfettered laughter.</p><p>Brandishing it with a flourish, he offers silently to pour more into Remus’ empty glass. “I really shouldn’t,” he offers weakly, even as he holds it out for Sirius to reach more easily.</p><p>“The weather is shite. I’m not sure whether you walked or drove, but either way I think you’re best staying on my couch, in which case you might as well continue to indulge with me.”</p><p>Remus opens his mouth to respond, but at that moment Sirius’ phone rings shrilly, vibrating from its place on the coffee table and lighting up with Benjy’s name. Setting the bottle down, Sirius reaches for the phone. “What was your ex’s name?” he quickly inquires.</p><p>“Emmeline.”</p><p>Swiping to answer the phone. “Hullo?”</p><p>“Hey, babe,” Benjy’s voice sounds strained and out of breath.</p><p>“Babe? You must have the wrong number, this isn’t Emmeline.”</p><p>The silence on the other side makes Sirius smile ferally, especially when Remus has to cover his mouth to keep from laughing.</p><p>“It’s not like that, Sirius,” the other finally offers feebly.</p><p>He rolls his eyes. “Yeah, I can tell. Your shit’s outside. I’ll have the locks changed tomorrow, so don’t bother returning the key.”</p><p>“Does this mean we’re done?”</p><p>“Yes. Yes, it fucking means we’re done Benjy.”</p><p>Remus’ jaw drops in shock and Sirius shakes his head in equal amazement that the man even had to ask. He doesn’t wait for a reply and opts to hang up. Staring at the phone in his hand, a hysterical laugh bubbles in his chest until tears are streaming from his eyes.</p><p>“Did he really fucking ask if you were done?!”</p><p>“Yes! He bloody well did! Can you believe that?! What an arse.”</p><p>“Fuck him. Fuck ‘em both, pass me that controller. Let’s play some video games.”</p><p>Sirius <em> meant </em>to go get in bed. He thinks he even said it outloud once or twice that he was going to. But somewhere between Layer-cake Desert and the final castle in Frosted Glacier, Sirius lost himself in the plains of Remus’ freckled cheeks, in the flickering glow of candles burning low and bouncing off curls of too-long hair tumbling into soft Irish eyes, and the long fingers that frantically brush them away during heated moments between platforms.</p><p>As his blinks became longer in the comfortable darkness of 2am, his head pillowed on his elbow and sleep dragging him down like an anchor mooring him at home port, his last thoughts were of eyes lingering on him and soft curses of distracted deaths.</p><p>Therefore it shouldn’t have been as disorienting as it was now, waking up on the couch in a tangle of limbs, screen faded with the pause menu darkened and controller having turned itself off where it lay beneath Remus’ sleeping hand. Careful not to wake the other boy, Sirius reaches for his phone still on the coffee table where he threw it after Benjy’s call. The battery has almost died, but he manages a quick text to James’ dad, who owns his apartment building, about getting the locks changed.</p><p>When he returns from plugging the phone in, Remus is shifting lazily, sage-green eyes blinking open but still clouded with sleep. Sirius perches on the edge of the couch, leaning back across Remus’ legs. “What do you think about going out to grab breakfast together?” he inquires softly.</p><p>Eyes closed, Remus nods emphatically with a small grunt. They head out not long after, walking side by side in comfortable silence. Sirius inhales deeply of the fresh just-rained air that makes him feel invigorated, as if he can do anything, be anyone, with a completely clean slate.</p><p>“You’re awful chipper this morning.”</p><p>The <em> for someone who found out last night that his boyfriend was cheating on him </em> goes unsaid, but not unheard. “That’s the funny part, isn’t it? I should feel upset, or offended, but really I just feel. Relieved. Alive. Like I can take on the world.” He looks over at the quirk of lips, the relaxed gait and soft eyes. “That’s odd isn’t it? We should be a mess.”</p><p>“Well, I think we both are a bit of a mess, but not over last night we aren’t, you’re right. Guess that just means they weren’t the ones, yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Sirius agrees easily. He holds the door open, waving Remus inside his favourite diner.</p><p>“Oh, my friend works here.”</p><p>“Yeah??”</p><p>“Yeah, Dorcas Meadowes? She waits here.”</p><p>“No shit! Dorcas is a peach.”</p><p>“Her girlfriend is the one who introduce Em and I,” he says lowly as they’re lead to a table.</p><p>“Well, I’ll have to have a talk with Marls, then, about her choice in partners for her friends.”</p><p>Remus chuckles from behind the menu and Sirius is staring at the single dimple that has appeared in his right cheek. Until he realises that just over Remus’ shoulder is a too familiar face. Biting back a laugh he gently kicks Remus under the table, and before the man can ask him if they’re really playing footsie, he jerks his chin toward the other table.</p><p>With a dubious look and a poor attempt at inconspicuousness, Remus peers over his shoulder and then whips back around, eyes wide and hand slapped over his own mouth to keep from laughing aloud. His reaction is confirmation enough for Sirius that, lo and behold, their exes have decided on the same restaurant for a breakfast date.</p><p>Smugly, Sirius notes that neither look as happy or comfortable as he and Remus do. A better man would say he hopes they’re happy together - Sirius hopes they’re both miserable and realise they will never find someone as great as Remus or himself. He’s caught up in his catty thoughts when Remus nudges him under the table, leaning forward with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.</p><p>“Want to have some fun?”</p><p>“Always.”</p><p>Holding his gaze, Remus reaches out and laces their fingers together on top of the table, within clear sight of Benjy and Emmeline, if either decide to look up from where they were playing on their phones.</p><p>Sirius wets his lips, squeezing Remus’ hand and dubbing the heat in his belly as a mixture of last nights scotch and hunger. (He does allow himself the small guilty pleasure tucked deep in the recesses of his mind of not specifying what type of hunger.)</p><p>“We have some things to talk about later,” Dorcas says in lieu of greeting, reaching across their conjoined hands to set down Sirius’ usual cafe latte and a breakfast tea for Remus, cream on the side.</p><p>“I was going to say the same thing,” Sirius replies, smiling too sweetly at her. She knows him well enough to flinch from the threat, her eyes darting toward the two at the other table. “You and Marls want to come round for dinner tonight?”</p><p>“Mmmhm. I’ll tell her to pick up your favourite take-away,” she placates. “Remus, you’ll be there as well?”</p><p>He studies Sirius’ face, eyes searching and guarded, but relaxes at the thumb stroking a soft pattern on the back of his hand. “Yeah, alright.”</p><p>They place their orders, and Sirius makes it a point to laugh a bit too loud at something Dorcas says, but doesn’t look over to see if it’s enough to draw attention to their presence. After she leaves, he finds the conversation flows so naturally he forgets he’s supposed to be pretending, and instead is mostly surprised he and Remus haven’t met before now. They run in the same circles but seem to have just missed one another at every party or get together because of one thing or another.</p><p>On their way out, Benjy hesitates next to their table, and Remus takes the opportunity to lean forward and wipe a bit of jam from the corner of his mouth. As he starts to pulls his hand away, Sirius grabs him by the wrist, sucking his thumb into his mouth. “All clean,” he says cheekily, relishing the surprised blush that paints the others cheeks a maddening shade of red. Benjy hurries off without a word.</p><p>After breakfast, Remus goes home to shower and change, and make sure all of Em’s stuff is gone, and returns shortly after Dorcas but before Marlene. The girl walked in, waving a white pillowcase in one hand and holding two bags of takeout in the other. “I know, I know, I’m the bloody worst.” Her shoulders slump and she holds her arms wide to Remus. He shakes his head with a fond smile before walking into her waiting arms and enveloping the smaller girl in a hug. “I’m so sorry, Rem.”</p><p>He plants a kiss on the top of her head. “If you’ve got sweet potato roti in there, all is forgiven.”</p><p>“As if I would even bother to show up without it, honestly.”</p><p>Marlene leans down to plant a kiss on Dorcas’ lips where she’s seated in the arm chair, before claiming a seat on the floor in front of the coffee table. Sirius brings out plates and cutlery and they fall easily into a night of regaling the girls with last nights events, Remus filling in what happened before he turned up on Sirius’ doorstep, and both gasp and guffaw at all the right moments.</p><p>From then on, dinners between the four become a common occurrence. Occasionally they’re joined by James and Lily or Peter and Hannah. Sometimes is James, Peter, Remus, and Sirius, with all the women insisting they need a break from the boys’ nonsense, and Sirius realises he’s missed this. He knew that none of his friends much cared for Benjy, but it became quickly apparent just how <em> much </em> they hadn’t liked him, how much time he <em> hadn’t </em> been spending with his friends that he hadn’t even noticed, and how much time he had been spending home alone because he didn’t feel like he could be around people.</p><p>It took losing his boyfriend for him to realise just how much he had lost by being with him. The addition of Remus is just the cherry on top of what Sirius is quickly coming to appreciate as the happiest has has been in his life.</p><p>The two have accidentally stumbled on Benjy and Emmeline on dates twice since and hammed up pretending to be on a date together as well, earning numerous dirty looks from the other two. Sirius loves spending time with Remus, whose dry wit and sarcasm not only match his own level of humour, but keep him in check in a way he’s known he needs but refused to admit until now. Their exes looking miserable together and at them having a great time, and an excuse to hold Remus’ hand, or lean against him, or rest a hand on his waist, is just an added bonus.</p><p>Sirius is standing behind Remus, his chin resting on the other man’s shoulder, and just generally being a nuisance while he dices tomatoes for dinner, when Marlene makes a casual remark about Em telling her about reservations she and Ben have for this weekend. Remus’ hands pause, head cocking curiously. “That’s a <em> really </em> nice restaurant. For how miserable the two always look, I’m surprised they’re putting that much money into a date.”</p><p>“I was thinking the same. Sex must be really good for them to be trying so hard to make it work,” Marlene muses.</p><p>Sirius scoffs. “If it is, it’s not because of him.” Remus snorts in amusement. “What, is she?” he asks despite the pain in his chest telling him he’s not sure he wants to hear the answer to that question.</p><p>“A gentleman doesn’t kiss and tell.”</p><p>“Bollocks to that. Ben is lazy and lacking in all adventure and passion.”</p><p>“Are we still talking about in bed?” Marlene asks.</p><p>Pulling back from Remus, Sirius leans against the counter, arms crossed and brow furled as he thinks. “All around, actually. Bloody hell, how did I stay with him <em> nine months? </em> Why didn’t you lot knock me over the head?”</p><p>Marlene pulls a face. “Honestly, you weren’t around enough for us to do it.” Sirius’ face must have dropped because Marlene makes an apologetic motion. “It’s in the past, and thank goodness for that. Let’s just leave it there.”</p><p>“Still, though. Weary Traveller is supposed to phenomenal. I think James has taken Lily a few times and both raved about the food and atmosphere, I’d love a chance to go.”</p><p>“Going to invite yourself along as a third then, are you?”</p><p>Sirius narrows in on Remus, but his back is to him and doesn’t see the danger coming. Marlene does, though, knowing him all too well. “Oh no, Sirius.”</p><p>“Hush, you. I’m scheming.”</p><p>“I can see that,” she says tiredly.</p><p>“Say, what are you doing Saturday night, Remus?”</p><p>Glancing briefly over his shoulder in surprise, his eyebrows ask the question before they leave his lips. “Me??”</p><p>Sirius rolls his eyes. “No, the other Remus in the room.”</p><p>“What are you thinking, Sirius…” his voice is heavy and Sirius can’t tell if he’s actually tired of Sirius’ antics or if there’s a certain level of intrigue - if the weight is hiding a similar endearment that Sirius has found it harder and harder to mask himself with regard to the man who charged into his life.</p><p>“Fancy a date with me?”</p><p>Remus hesitates, not looking at Sirius. “I don’t know. I mean, every other time we just happened to run into them and it was a fun way to deal with the awkward situation and make it not awkward. Well. For us. I’m sure it was pretty awkward for them. But <em> planning </em> to crash a date seems...petty and like we care. Which, I don’t.”</p><p>“Neither do I,” Sirius insists. “But don’t you think it would be fun?! Plus it’s an excuse to get dressed up, have a nice meal in a super fancy place. It’ll be fun, Remus! It won’t seem like we care to them, either, because they won’t know it’s intentional that we’re there at the same time. When Emmeline sees you all dressed up it’ll be that last little push of <em> oh I fucked up </em>. You didn’t throw her stuff out the window, consider it your revenge.”</p><p>He wipes his hand on a teatowel before turning and stabbing a finger in Sirius’ chest, the effect of which is lost in his smile. “That! That’s petty!”</p><p>Sirius grabs his hand, wrapping it in his larger one. “What, and helping me throw Benjy’s stuff over the balcony in the rain wasn’t?”</p><p>“That’s different.”</p><p>“No it isn’t, and you know it. Them aside, I’ve wanted to check that place out for ages but didn’t feel like taking Ben, and don’t want to go alone, so you’d be doing me a favour. My treat. Pleeeeease, Moony?” He adds the new nickname he’s given him, knowing that Remus secretly loves it.</p><p>When he sighs, Sirius knows he’s won and pumps a fist in the air in triumph.</p><p>“Fine, you win. But we are <em> not </em> doing anything to ruin their night. I don’t want a scene and I do <em> not </em>want any bloody chance of either of them trying to get back with us.”</p><p>Sirius doesn’t miss he says <em> us </em> rather than <em> me </em> and has to swallow past the excitement bubbling in his stomach. <em> . </em>“I completely agree. The past few weeks have been the happiest I can ever remember being. I wouldn’t risk going back to that for anything. Just a fun night out, gentleman’s honour.” Sirius holds his hand up in a mock swearing, his heart thrumming in his chest when Remus mutters a retort about the state of his gentleman’s honour as he turns back to the dinner prep.</p><p>Forgetting entirely about Marlene’s presence, he swoops in and leaves a quick kiss on Remus’ cheek. “You’re both blushing,” she remarks.</p><p>The men startle, jumping at her voice, eyes wide as she flicks her blue ones back and forth between them, a knowing smirk on her lips.</p><p>“No we aren’t,” they say at the same time.</p><p>She’s still laughing heartily when Dorcas comes through the door.</p><p>“Your girlfriend is a menace,” Sirius mumbles, moving to the sitting room with the excuse of putting on music.</p><p>That night he walks home, hands shoved deep into his pockets, his thoughts filled with firm intentions to regather the scattering pieces of his tenuous grasp on his sanity before Saturday night.</p>
