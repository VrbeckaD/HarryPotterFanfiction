    <p>Ever since entering Hogwarts, the boy's her age haven't looked at her until fourth year. Harry Potter was required to participate in the Triwizard Tournament, even if she didn't wanted it.</p><p>However there was someone who had looked at her in a sexual way that Harry didn't know about, and that was Severus Snape. Ever since seeing her for the first time within the Great Hall, he couldn't stop looking and just….stare. </p><p>She was just like her mother, the exact copy except her hair was black, just like James. Harry had looked up at him from where she was sitting at the Gryffindor table and caught him.</p><p>Severus had given her a sneer and with that day, he tormented Harry Potter but the sexual desire lusting for a student had stayed secret. It was indeed forbidden for a teacher/student relationship, unless you were seventeen.</p><p>So fourth year came and during the Yule Ball, Harry Potter was asked to the danced by both boy's and girl's in different years. She was flattered and decided to go with a boy from Ravenclaw.</p><p>At the end of the Yule Ball, when the two were alone within Hogwarts, the boy, name Charles Greene became agressive as they sat on the steps and were making out.</p><p>Charles wanted more as he would groped her breast and try to unzip her dress from behind. He succeeded but not by much if it wasn't for Severus Snape.</p><p>Harry's dress was pulled down and her bra was showing when Severus came into view. Harry was trying to push Charles away but since he was older, she couldn't.</p><p>Severus took so many points off of their houses that neither Ravenclaw nor Gryffindor could win the house cup that year. He gave Charles detention for a few months with both him and Filch.</p><p>Harry was a bit grateful as Severus took her to Madame Pomfrey to get checked. During fifth year, Harry was too busy with dealing Umbridge.</p><p>It was also during fifth year that Umbridge tried to rape her. It happened near the end of the year during detention, that instead of writing lines, Umbridge kissed her.</p><p>Harry was shocked when Umbridge had leaned over the desk and kissed her unexpectedly. It was that heated moment that Harry should had stopped but didn't as Umbridge climbed over the desk without breaking the kiss.</p><p>It was also Umbridge who used a spell to take away their clothing after the kiss as she sat on Harry's lap. The two were making out again and touching each other's breasts as the door opened with a slam.</p><p>There was a sudden spell as it threw Dolores Umbridge back to her seat and another spell as their clothes were put back on.</p><p>"She's underage, Dolores! I have no choice but to fire you. Severus, bring Miss Potter to the infirmary while I'll deal with Dolores," the voice said as Harry turned around and saw Albus Dumbledore beside Severus.</p><p>Harry knew that she will be having a lecture about something. Sixth year started but it was the year that Harry left to find the horcruxes to defeat you-know-who.</p><p>She left to go on the run with her two best friends and didn't return to Hogwarts to find the last one. It wasn't until she was standing beside Severus Snape who was dying from Nagini's bite that she felt something for the man.</p><p>It was regret and sorrow that Harry almost cried right there but knew she couldn't. It was the memories that he'd given her that made her shocked.</p><p>(Flashback - first year)</p><p>"I'm not a pedophilia, Albus! I'm not going to touch her," Severus said with a sneer.</p><p>"I know that, my boy, but teacher/student relationship aren't forbidden if the student is seventeen," Albus replies.</p><p>Both Severus and Harry were staring at the Headmaster in shocked. "I thought I read all the rules…." Severus mutters loud.</p><p>"She's an adult at seventeen, she can make her own decisions, Severus. She's almost like Lily Evans, isn't she?" Albus asked.</p><p>Harry gawked as she looks back and forth between the two. They were talking about her! "It's just a crush, Albus. What I feel about Miss Potter would go away throughout the years," Severus said.</p><p>"So you aren't in love with her because of Lily?" Albus asked.</p><p>Severus snorted, "Lily and I were just friends, nothing more. Miss Potter is a different reason," he said.</p><p>The memory began fading as Harry was too shocked to even noticed.</p><p>(End flashback)</p><p>She defeated Voldemort that year and not everyone have survived the war. A ceremony came and went, the ministry wanted everyone that missed sixth year to go back to Hogwarts to finish their schooling.</p><p>Nobody at Hogwarts could persuade the ministry officials otherwise, although they were able to make an agreement. Instead of staying for two years, it would just be one since Harry and her classmates were already sixteen that year.</p><p>Many of her classmates protested but they didn't have a choice. As of right now, they were on break as teachers and the ministry fixes up Hogwarts before the school term starts.</p><p>"This is insane," Ron Weasley said huffing annoyed as he, Hermione and Harry were sitting at the dining table of the Weasley home.</p><p>"It's only one year, Ron," Harry replies.</p><p>"We will be as the same year with Ginny," Ron said.</p><p>"Is that so painful?" Hermione asked as she was reading the Daily Prophet. </p><p>Ron was about to say something but he heard Hermione gasped. "What is it, Hermione?" He asked worriedly.</p><p>"Read this page on the Daily Prophet," Hermione said as she slid the paper towards to Harry and Ron.</p><p>The two looks over and gasped. Right there in bold letters, were:</p><p>SEVERUS SNAPE LIVES! TRIAL FINDS HIM UNGUILTY AND IS SET TO BE HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS.</p><p>Harry's head was spinning at the revealation as Arthur Weasley came into the kitchen with a tired look on his face. She frowns as she suddenly knew where Arthur was the last few days. "You knew!" She screeched out at Arthur, startling all three that were present in the kitchen. "You knew and you didn't tell me that he was alive?!" She asked angrily.</p><p>Arthur sighed as he knew that this would come eventually. "It was not my place to tell, Harry. The ministry wanted it a secret until school started and somehow word leaked out," he said.</p><p>"What are you doing now?" Harry asked curiously.</p><p>"Investigating, you don't need to worry, Harry. Just worry about school," Arthur said with a smile.</p>
