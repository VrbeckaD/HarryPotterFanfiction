          <div class="userstuff"><p>The students of Hogwarts were cleaning-up after Voldemort’s defeat and found Snape. He was still in the Shrieking Shack, alive. Just try to get him out - he is heavy. So, they used Mobilicorpus to get him out. They put him onto a Hogwarts’ hospital bed and poured him some milk.</p>
<p>And Snape is just lying there and isn’t moving.</p>
<p>He lay thus for an hour and then another.</p>
<p>Then he pulled out his proverbial nose and sniffed.</p>
<p>What’s this smell?</p>
<p>Snape got up, saw the milk and drank it. He finished it and laid back down.</p>
<p>And then the Aurors arrived, an argument began - and Snape was able to apparat unnoticed, because he’s that good.</p></div>
