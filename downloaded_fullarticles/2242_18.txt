"Sure."</p><p>Molly beamed, "There's something that sets you apart from the other boys in my year and I'm glad because I adore your strange love for all things muggle."</p><p>Arthur smirked. "When we first met, you said I was just a no good muggle hugger."</p><p>Molly replied, "I regret calling you that every day since we met."</p><p>Arthur answered, "I know and you shouldn't regret it because if you hadn't called me that, I might not have been as determined to befriend you as I was."</p><p>Molly responded, "Well then, I don't regret nothing because here we are; together at last."</p><p>Arthur smiled. "The way it was always meant to be."</p></div>
