    <p>She’s livid and storming down the halls of Hogwarts and it isn’t even the first time today. Harry’s obsession with that book never fails to irritate her. The fact he is blatantly cheating and benefiting from it rubs her in a way she wishes she is beyond. She doesn’t like him doing better than her, not when he’s cheating. If it was fair she may not have this gut wrenching disdain. She can admit to herself that even then it might irk her. She’s had to fight the twitch in her hands that wants to cuff him over the head and lecture him for hours.</p>
<p>She still did but at least she pretended to try and be mature about it.</p>
<p>Ron is even worse. Whenever he isn’t off cavorting with Lavender he’s an ass to her. He is combative and mulish at the best of times but that combined with Harry’s state and it ends up a constant disaster.</p>
<p>She feels a visceral disconnect from her friends. </p>
<p>She needs out of Hogwarts and away from them. She needs a break from their drama and all it entails. The way they act as if she is unreasonable for calling a suspicious book into question. As if Ginny hadn’t been tormented by a mysterious book. As if anything in their world could be trusted at face value. </p>
<p>She follows a path they had learned when they’d been organizing for Dumbledore’s Army. She spent days looking at that map just as Harry and Ron did to make sure and note the passageways. Fred and George told Ron some of the paths that were obstructed, others they had to find themselves. </p>
<p>She doesn’t have the map to monitor anyone’s movements so she hopes she won’t cross their path on her way out of the school. She pulls her cloak around her tighter as the cold air crept over her. She paves her way through a tunnel leading outside of Hogwarts grounds and into Hogsmeade. Her shoes crunch against the snow when she finally emerges into the town.</p>
<p>She lets out a relieved breath, finding an ease with distance between her issues. That disconnect between her friends has been slowly extending towards the rest of her life. She feels disconnected from all her friends, not just Harry and Ron. This year has been different than the last few. </p>
<p>It’s more like her first year, before the troll. She knows that she has friends but it doesn’t feel that way. She worries herself in circles. She wants to find that Gryffindor bravery and confront them but people are distinctly more terrifying than facing down a basilisk or Death Eaters. That’s why she spent so much of her first year alone. Still, Harry and Ron are supposed to be different but this year has discombobulated their friendship. </p>
<p>She continues along the path towards the town but doesn’t enter it. She doesn’t want to risk someone noticing her and reporting her. She lingers around the town, able to hear the laughter and see the lights but doesn’t dare go beyond. She hugs herself tighter against the brisk wind, finding a fallen tree to sit on. She has to brush the falling snow off but luckily it's not packed too tightly. Her outer robes may get wet but she’ll survive. </p>
<p>She sits down and leans forward onto her knees. She knows this can’t continue. This strain between them all. The way Ginny’s lips tighten at the book Harry hoards selfishly. His obsession with Draco that has doubled this year. How Ron and Hermione can’t even seem to be in a room together anymore because of his obnoxious behavior and her knee jerk harsh responses.</p>
<p>Harry has tried to comfort her, believing her anger is due to feelings for Ron. It isn’t but he didn’t believe her when she said this. She loves Ron as she loves Harry, as a brother. It is his behavior she finds herself constantly bothered by. It’s tearing them all apart and they have to fix it. </p>
<p>She knows that they won’t. They stubbornly refuse to believe that there is an issue. Rather, they know there is one but they refuse to admit any fault. It will have to be her who approaches them about it. She lets out a frustrated huff, it’s always her. </p>
<p>She loves her friends, enough that she doesn’t know how she’d go about living without them. However, at times like these she has to grit her teeth at their antics. She hates that they force her into this role. The mediator, the one who has to confront them. She wishes for once they’d take responsibility for their own actions.</p>
<p>“You look frustrated, girl.” The voice comes from behind her. Close, too close. Hermione’s hand is flying to her wand before she can doubt herself. Before she can turn on the man, his arms lock around her in a tight and unyielding grip. She can smell his overabundance of cologne, feel his body against hers. “At least you won’t be frustrated for much longer.” His laugh is as rough as his voice. It raises the hairs on the back of Hermione’s neck. She attempts to lash out at the man, shove him off. She only needs a moment to get ahold of her wand. </p>
<p>She doesn’t know enough about wandless magic to use it against her assailant. If she gets ahold of her wand she can take the man out in moments. Harry and his training fills her with a confidence in her actions. </p>
<p>Despite all this, despite the years of surviving and fighting, she isn’t fast enough. His hand reaches into her hair and tugs her head to the side, revealing her throat. Wasting no time, he buries his teeth into her flesh. </p>
<p>Pain explodes across the site of his bite. Hermione continues her attempts to struggle, tries to throw him off. It only tears the skin around his teeth, no, fangs. She feels terror spread throughout her body. She tries to scream only for his hands to cover her mouth. </p>
<p>She didn’t want to be near Harry and Ron but now she wishes she hadn’t left. She should have just stayed in Hogwarts, in her bed, where she was safe.</p>
<p>Now she is sitting here in a cold that is slowly burying itself in her limbs, nearly as deep as his fangs. She didn’t tell anyone she was leaving either. Nobody knows she’s missing and she can’t reach her wand. She’s struck with the absolute clarity that she is going to die. Blanketed by snow still falling as if nothing changed with only her murderer for company, buried in a coffin of ice.</p>
<p>The cold bites into her more with each lap of his tongue over the wound, with each drop sucked from her. She’s always been curious about vampires. To think this is how she finally meets one. </p>
<p>After what feels like a lifetime, his teeth finally withtract from her and his grip leaves her the same moment. She drops into the snow beneath his feet. Her vision is blurred, she feels her eyes becoming heavier with every blink. He stands there in nice robes, slight stubble, completely unremarkable. He looks like anyone else with the exception of her blood smeared across his face.</p>
<p>His expression goes from pleased to surprised. “Hermione Granger?” His laughter causes her to shiver. She wishes he would just leave her to die in peace but as he crouches near her she knows she won't be so lucky. “I wonder what would happen if one of the golden trio would join our bloody ranks.” She is filled with such a hatred for this man she hopes they find him. She hopes they bestow no mercy upon him. </p>
<p>“Shall we find out?” His teeth are now digging into his own wrist. The sound of flesh splitting is too loud, echoing in the silence around them. The blood patters into the ground, white running red. </p>
<p>He brings his bleeding wrist towards her lips and she uses the last vestiges of energy to try and twitch away from him. “None of that now.” He warns as he lays his wrist over her mouth. Despite her best wishes the blood makes it past her lips and it's like a jolt to her system. </p>
<p>Her blurred vision fades and her waning energy is replenished. She locks onto the source of the blood, sucking deeper and quicker as she is not only refilled but going beyond that. He takes his wrist back, shoving her away. “Greedy. Nonetheless, that should be enough. Have fun.” </p>
<p>As quick as he came, he leaves. Hermione attempts to stand only to trip and fall back down. She then tries dragging herself back onto the fallen tree, hands uselessly clawing at the wood. She isn’t anymore capable of that then standing.</p>
<p>Hands now splintered, she falls into the snow once more. She rolls onto her back and gives into her own inability. A new pain begins. It doesn’t remain in her neck as the bite had but it spreads throughout her body. The pleasure of the blood transference long gone leaving behind an agony. </p>
<p>She isn’t a fool. She knows exactly what’s happening. They’d read about it in class and she’d read a bit more at the library when her curiosity was piqued. For whatever reason he’d decided to change her instead of letting her die. She knows the process will take a few hours and it will be agonizing. </p>
<p>The thought that causes her brain to slam to a stop is the idea of after. No magic. He had not only ripped away her humanity without a second thought but he’d taken away her magic. </p>
<p>She lets out an angry scream at the thought. The rage becomes overridden by pain. Everything becomes overridden by pain. She feels herself drift in and out of consciousness. Her senses dulled, everything is distant and muffled. </p>
<p>Hours pass. The night is silent. She can no longer hear the clamor of the nearby town nor see the light. She can only feel the transformation. The change from human to inhuman. It is when two of her teeth are driven out of her mouth, to make room for her new pair of teeth, that awareness starts to leak back in. </p>
<p>She can feel it when it finally robs her of her magic. The connection that had existed between her and her magic is severed. Snipped as easily as a thread, the Fates reigning chaos upon her life. Everything is bleary once more. She numbly raises her hand, finally able to move it again. She wipes at a tear track and it comes away red. Blood. Even the reminder, the word, sends a thrill of desire through her system. </p>
<p>She unburies herself from the coffin of ice that had indeed claimed her as she had feared. She stands shakily, unused to this new body she finds herself inhabiting. She becomes single mindedly focused. Blood. It keeps repeating in her mind like a broken record. She needs it. Her mouth is dry with the longing, her body moving forward towards the sound of heartbeats. The sound of shifting bodies and warmth waiting to fill her hungry body. </p>
<p>Every sound except those steady heartbeats is dull, uninteresting. One heartbeat is closer than the nearby cluster. It is quickly growing closer and closer. It is running towards her. Gargled words meet her ears, a hand against her shoulder. </p>
<p>Blood, heartbeat, teeth. </p>
<p>The warmth floods her mouth before she can consider her actions. She bites deeper at the taste. Fangs burrowing their way into foreign flesh. A yelp and a pained groan, her name, hands attempting to shove her away. She understands, she tried to shove him away too. Like her, eventually the heartbeat reaches for a wand. Hoping that a stick can provide the protection they were sworn. The heartbeat isn’t any luckier than she was. She shoves the heartbeat down and traps it beneath her, pinning thrashing hands.</p>
<p>Blood, heartbeat, fangs.</p>
