    <p>During her imprisonment within the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter had a great deal of time to reflect on her own stupidity.</p>
<p>Sixty-two full days, if her tally count was right.</p>
<p>If storming the Ministry chasing false visions, against all the advice of her friends, had been stupid. Rushing into the strange archway, filled with whispers after Sirius had been even stupider. She was lucky she was alive to be imprisoned.</p>
<p>Harry tried to concentrate on this fact as she went through her hourly ritual of standing, and stretching out each muscle starting with her neck and working her way down to her toes.</p>
<p>A veteran of many unjust confinements, Harry knew that if she didn’t get up and move around at regular intervals, she’d waste away to nothing before she was released.</p>
<p>That being said the Unspeakables made better jailors than the Dursleys. There was a witchlight floating in the confines of a sconce just inside the door that brightened or dimmed with the hour of the day, she received three regular meals at precise intervals. There was a water pitcher and a glass, spelled unbreakable, for drinking, and a basin that filled twice a day with hot water, for washing. Her water pitcher never ran dry, her chamber pot vanished her waste promptly and the pallet on the floor was more comfortable than her cupboard-bed had ever been.</p>
<p>She suspected a great deal of that was thanks to the monitoring of a house-elf, but as she hadn’t seen them, she couldn’t be sure.</p>
<p>She’d slept peacefully nine nights out of ten her nightmares, when they came, blessedly normal and pain free.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for the complete and utter isolation from other beings and the crushing boredom that came with being in a windowless cell without books or paper or her wand Harry might have even said it was relaxing.</p>
<p>As it was, she spent an awful lot of energy figuring out how to use wandless magic to make her tally marks on the far wall of her cell. Once she’d figured that out, she’d begun work on levitation and summoning spells. Just simple things that she’d seen adult witches and wizards do easily and thoughtlessly.</p>
<p>It was all much harder than it looked not because it required a lot of power but because it required a lot of focus. Mental discipline.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t Snape be so proud if he could see how far she’d come.  </p>
<p>Harry let out a snort, that sounded too harsh and too loud in the silence of her cell.</p>
<p>If Snape had thought that locking her away would have any benefit whatsoever, she had no doubt he’d have left her in an oubliette with nothing but a textbook and her cauldron in first year.</p>
<p>Harry reached down and put her hands on the floor, rocking forward and back on her toes examining her too-long toenails critically and wondering if there was anything that could be done about that, when the door to her cell opened.</p>
<p>Harry startled, badly, and nearly fell over. Reached for a wand that wasn’t there and then finally grabbed the handle of her water pitcher.</p>
<p>It vanished from her hand before she could decide if she wanted to throw it, and two Unspeakables with their faces hidden in the deep shadow of their grey-hooded cloaks took hold of her arms, and frog-marched her, barefoot and squinting, into the hall.</p>
<p>Behind her the door to her cell swung shut, and became indistinguishable from all the other doors in the long hallway. She tried to count how many doors they passed, but she suspected that the hall was enchanted because she lost count every time she reached thirteen, and it took her a long moment to focus again.</p>
<p>Still, eventually they came to the end of the hall, and there was a sensation like being squeezed through a tube, and they appeared in somebody’s office.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said the somebody behind the desk, an attractive man in his middle-years with dark brown hair going silver at the temples. “You may go.”</p>
<p>Beside her the hooded and cloaked Unspeakables vanished with a sucking-pop.</p>
<p>“Please, sit,” said the man, gesturing to the chairs in front of the imposing blackwood desk.</p>
<p>Gingerly, Harry sat across from the man, very aware of just how grimy she was after sixty-two days without a proper shower or even a cleaning charm.</p>
<p>The man turned to face her, steepling his fingers under his chin and sitting back in his desk chair. He was dressed in the grey robes of an Unspeakable as well, but his were left open over a smart dove-grey suit and a silky looking black cravat.</p>
<p>His shoes were shinier than Draco Bloody Malfoy’s.</p>
<p>He had grey eyes that put her in mind of Snape and those oubliettes she’d just been thinking about. There was something familiar about him, though she couldn’t quite put her finger on it.</p>
<p>Something about the eyes…</p>
<p>“You’ve held out rather well, girl,” he said. “Usually I’d expect to see at least some raving after two months without human contact.”</p>
<p>“So sorry to disappoint,” said Harry, before she could think better of it.</p>
<p>Her voice was a jagged rasp, not nearly as sharp as she’d been hoping.</p>
<p>The man flicked his wand absently and a tea tray appeared at her elbow.</p>
<p>A cuppa sounded fabulous right about then, but Harry knew better than to reach for it.</p>
<p>The man seemed amused, in a distant way, almost fond, but not quite.</p>
<p>“If I wanted you dead, young miss, I certainly wouldn’t need to stoop to poison in your tea,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” agreed Harry.</p>
<p>She didn’t reach for the tea set.</p>
<p>For a long moment she and the man stared at each other.</p>
<p>“Your case is a curious one,” he said, after a long moment. “Not a single person has ever come through from beyond the Veil, alive or dead. Those who pass through from this side, vanish, become a whispering voice, the kind you can’t quite make out. You know the kind I mean?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>The man gave a small but supremely self-satisfied smirk.</p>
<p>“I thought you just might.”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t know what to make of this man, this Unspeakable. Her instincts said he was dangerous, not to be trusted, but he seemed very pleased by her chilly reception to his cryptic remarks.</p>
<p>All in all, quite the odd duck.</p>
<p>“Sir,” she said, feeling like it was time for a bit of daring. “If you don’t mind, I am not so desperate for entertainment that I need you to beat around the bush all day. What exactly is going to be done with me?”</p>
<p>“Well, that entirely depends on you,” he said. “You are less than a ghost in this world, I could keep you here forever, and no one would bat an eye. In fact, some of the gentlemen in research and development insist that I use this opportunity to provide them a chance at human trials.”</p>
<p>Harry fought the urge to finch.</p>
<p>“Of course, I told them no,” said the man, chuckling a bit. “A girl who can walk through the Veil of Death unharmed is not likely to provide an actionable set of baseline data. No, you may be relieved to know that I have decided to set you loose on society, provided you can agree to a few simple conditions.”</p>
<p>Harry would have liked to tell him where he could shove it and demand to be let free on the basis of human bloody decency, but the fact of it was that the last two months had proven that no one was looking for her—otherwise surely Dumbledore would have found her by now—and that he could and probably would keep her locked up for the rest of her natural life if he wanted.</p>
<p>“Name them,” Harry said.</p>
<p>“You are the magical Heir to the House of Black,” said the man. “Just recently come into your own, perhaps, but the inherited magic runs strong and pure through you. I want you to assume that role here, in this world, as well, and swear on your magic that you will not attempt to return to your own beyond the Veil. That you will not attempt to circumvent, in any way, your duty as Heir Black.”</p>
<p>“That’s—”</p>
<p>“Additionally,” continued the man, blithely. “You will bear, in your own womb, the next Heir Black, a witch of suitable power, bloodline and fertility to carry on the legacy.”</p>
<p>“B-bear,” sputtered Harry, flushing.</p>
<p>The man, a Black, Harry was now pretty sure, offered her a look. Something that wasn’t quite pity and wasn’t quite condescension.</p>
<p>“You are a vessel for great power. An unlooked-for chance to see the return to glory for our family, but that is your role. A vessel. You are to carry the power and pass it to the next generation.”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t know how to respond to that. Not at all. Dimly, she recalled Ron mentioning something about Ginny and the family magic. Neville as well.</p>
<p>It was one of those things that purebloods all understood but wasn’t ever written down anywhere in any useful way, not that Harry had ever gone digging for that kind of information. When she wasn’t busy facing Voldemort, she was busy trying to be normal. Just Harry. Neither of those two things had ever required her to consider why purebloods were the way that they were.</p>
<p>It was a little surprising, and possibly related to Voldemort being as half-blooded as she herself was, but for a man who had seduced most of the heirs of old families into his half-baked conquest of the Wizarding World, pureblood culture was not often relevant to his goals.</p>
<p>In any case, Harry had always been more worried about making it to her next birthday in one piece. She’d never considered…bearing, pregnancy, children, or shady inherited magics. Heck, she hadn’t even been sure she’d liked boys as well as girls until just a few months ago.</p>
<p>“I don’t—”</p>
<p>“If you need time to think, of course, your cell will be available to you for as long as you have need of it.”</p>
<p>Harry wished desperately for her wand.</p>
<p>She would feel much, much better if only she had something between her and this smug bastard. Some kind of weapon.</p>
<p>She was a Gryffindor, a woman of action. She didn’t know <em>how</em> to leverage this situation to her advantage with just words.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?” she asked finally, unable to think of anything better to say.</p>
<p>He smiled though, as though he thought she’d done something particularly clever.</p>
<p>Bloody purebloods.</p>
<p>“Arcturus Magnus,” he said, easily.</p>
<p>His chin lifted and his shoulders squared, just slightly, just enough that Harry could notice it.</p>
<p>He was proud then, of his name. But wracking her brain for what she remembered of the Black Family Tree, each Lord or Lady’s name in shining silver instead of gold thread, there hadn’t been an Arcturus as the head. She was sure of it. She’d spent enough time staring at the bloody thing.</p>
<p>After Phineas Nigellus, there was Sirius Aquilanus, then Lycoris Oriana, Cassiopiea Pandora, Charis Thalassa, and finally Walburga Honora, before in quick succession Regulus Arcturus and Sirius Orionis.  </p>
<p>No Arcturus Magnus in that broken line.</p>
<p>Of course, if this was a different world, that might not be true any more but it was the only thing she could think of to say that might put off needing to make this decision.</p>
<p>“You don’t have the authority to make this bargain,” she said, slowly. “You’re not the Lord.”</p>
<p>Arcturus Magnus Black didn’t seem upset by this declaration. In fact, he laughed a little before waving over a roll of parchment sealed with black wax stamped in the Black crest.</p>
<p>“There, girl, your geas, written in my niece’s own hand.”</p>
<p>The seal sparked with static electricity when Harry broke it.</p>
<p>Written in what Harry had a sneaking suspicion was blood, and spiky calligraphy, was a contract positively humming with magic.</p>
<p>It outlined the same terms Arcturus Magnus had stated.</p>
<p>She would abandon all claims to her former family, name and life. Never attempt to return. Act in the best interests of the Black family, as Heir Black and then Lady Black.  Bear a strong female heir to a man of suitable power and lineage…etcetera, and so forth…this being a binding and unbreakable agreement on your life and magic you so swear.</p>
<p>It was signed Lycoris Oriana, Lady Black.</p>
<p>It might as well have proclaimed: <em>abandon all hope, ye who enter here</em>, because that was what Harry would be doing if she signed it.</p>
<p>She’d buy her freedom from her little cage in the Department of Mysteries at the cost of ever going home.</p>
<p>She’d never see her friends again. She’d never know what had happened to them in the battle. She’d be abandoning whatever destiny that blasted prophecy she’d stolen had laid out for her. And she suspected that meant letting everyone else, trusting anyone else to, take care of Lord Voldemort.</p>
<p>Of course, if she was confined to the Department of Mysteries for the rest of her natural life, she’d have to do all of those things anyway.</p>
<p>It was a choice that was not a choice.</p>
<p>It was just that she would have felt better spitting in Arcturus Magnus’ smug, annoying face and plotting her escape from inside her bloody cell however long it took.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>She was trying not to be stupid.</p>
<p>The last time she’d belligerently tried to do everything herself all she’d done, in the end, was get Sirius killed. Her friends hurt. She’d given Voldemort exactly what he wanted and only smashing the prophecy on the floor at the last moment and the arrival of the Order to clean up her mess had kept him from a total victory.</p>
<p>She’d walked right into Voldemort’s trap, because she thought she knew best.</p>
<p>She might not have been a trained Slytherin, but she didn’t have to charge into this new situation wand blazing either.</p>
<p>What she really needed was more information, and she wasn’t going to get it stuck in her little cell.</p>
<p>“I’ll need a quill,” she said.</p>
<p>If Harry had thought that Arcturus Magnus was smug before it was nothing compared to how smug he was when he took a blood quill wrapped in black silk out of the top drawer of his desk and handed it to her with a courtly flourish.</p>
<p>Harry took it and scrawled her signature on at the bottom, unsurprised at the sting of the quill.</p>
<p>Then, figuring that if she was in for a penny she was in for a pound, she used wandless magic to pour herself that cuppa.</p>
<p>She’d just signed away her life and magic, she certainly deserved one.</p>
