    <p>Sirius glanced around the area. He was standing next to his mother and father under a canopy that protected them from the searing sun. They were placed on the edge of the square where the military camp’s Via principalis and Via praetoria met. In front of them the Praetorian Guard, their army’s elite unit, was being prepared for a strike against the werewolves.<br/> As long as he can remember, the so called beasts were a huge threat to his family’s reign. A couple of years ago a wolf named Romulus had been able to unify a couple of packs, forming a group that had been becoming more of a problem than anybody would have guessed. On a regular basis they were raiding trading carts, military squads and royal escorts, sometimes even groups of pilgrims yet no one was able to get a hand on them.<br/> Sirius’ cousin Bellatrix – whom he despised with every inch of his body – had suggested an alternative plan: She had sent out a toy of hers, an enslaved beast, she had claimed for herself, to infiltrate the pack and provide information about their plans and location in exchange of a handful of freedoms. His mother had accepted reluctantly, not liking the idea of an even partly independent beast but the threat the group had posed seemed to be greater than that.<br/> And as it seemed, the chosen wolf had finally delivered.</p><p>The Black focused his gaze on the Praetorian’s general, Abraxas Malfoy, and his son Lucius. Both of them were part of the royal guard, following the family tradition of protecting the Blacks. Now they were dressed in combat armour while preparing their men for the upcoming fight against the beasts.<br/> Sirius couldn’t (or didn’t want to) prevent his gaze from roaming Lucius’ body. The fair-haired man may have been one of the most stuck up and annoying people existing in the royal ranks (plus he was engaged to Sirius’s cousin Narcissa) yet Sirius was able to appreciate the physique of the other one.<br/> His long, almost white hair was tightly braided and put up so it wouldn’t pose as a possible danger. His shoulders were broad and his arms strong from the physical training he was required to keep up for unarmed fights – a situation that had a high potential of arising while fighting beasts. He grinned slightly, imagining that a body like this would come in handy, it at least promised a lot of stamina.</p><p>Before he could lose himself in his own thoughts, his mother hit his arm with her fan and shot him a dark look. Rolling his eyes, he turned away and looked over to the cart that was prepared in case they were actually able to capture the pack’s leader. His parents already had filed out a perfect sentence for him and the others.<br/> If they were able to catch him, he would be executed publicly in front of his pack, the rest of them were a refreshment for the arena. Sirius always had despised fights between werewolves. They were predictable and barbaric, usually ending with one wolf tearing the other into pieces. The winner was dragged back into the arena’s dungeon to wait for the next fight.</p><p>Sirius adjusted his toga, the heavy linen cloth only adding to the heat. Even though his hair was braided up, he was able to feel drops of sweat running down his neck, vanishing under the seam of his tunic. Usually he would have only worn the lighter garment only yet his father had insisted on him draping himself in the white sheet too, since he would have to present himself properly in front of part of the army, he was to lead someday.<br/> Once the squad had departed, making their way to the location they hoped the beasts’ camp would be, he was finally able to apparate back to their house.<br/> The second he had reached the atrium, the cool air inside the house sent a short shiver down his spine but he was thankful for it.</p><p>There was a pool in the centre of the room, directly positioned under the open part of the roof. It was richly decorated with small statues and ornaments, simply designed to catch rainwater. It was surrounded by a couple of columns that supported the roof. Opposite of the main entrance, two staircases opened the way into the upper levels, between them an empty doorframe that led to the back part of the house, the peristyle. It was a small garden, also covered by a roof with a hole in the centre. That was used to water the herbs and flowers his cousins Andromeda and Narcissa were growing back there. His mother also used a part of that area yet she only grew poisonous plants, while Bellatrix never set a foot there.</p><p>He went up the stairs to go to his room. They were arranged around the open centre of their house. The main bedroom was the one above the entrance, belonging to his parents. His room was next to it (or more around the corner, since the room took up the whole front of the house), the ones belonging to his cousins were up here as well. Luckily, every room had its own separate bathroom, so he wasn’t able to run into one of his cousins or even his parents trying to take a bath. The slave quarters, kitchen and other mundane places were found at the base level as well.<br/> Sirius stepped into his room, closing the doors. Upon entering, he got rid of his shoes. The leather had been annoying him the whole time, especially after a handful of sand had found its way between his skin and the leather strips. He also dumped his toga onto one of the low chairs next to the small table in one of the corners of his rooms.<br/> He knew, it was preferred to wear sandals inside yet he preferred walking around barefoot, especially on hot days like this. The cold marble that covered the floor and most of the walls was a dearly welcomed change to the hot and dry stones outside of the hose. Sirius partially loosened the belt around his waist and grabbed a handful of grapes. There were still some hours left until his parents, who directly apparated back to the Senate, came back home. He had given his personal slave the permission to spend her day the way she wanted since he had hoped for some peace and silence.<br/> With an apathetic huff, he let himself fall onto his bed, taking a book he had found quite interesting and tried to get some order into his lately restless mind.</p><hr/><p>Remus stood next to Romulus in the leader’s tent. They bent over a map together, discussing placements for their next raid in the morning. There was a third person with them, Randall. He was the latest gain for the pack. He neither looked nor acted likable in any kind of way. His body was big, broad and covered in scars. Even though scars were nothing abnormal for any werewolf, something about them awoke an unsettling feeling in Remus, something he couldn’t quite place. The man’s face had brutish streaks and was disfigured with scars on one side of his face and a nose that had been broken more than once. Maybe he once had been a handsome man once but neither the time nor his opponents had been gentle with him. He never hid the beast inside him, always portraying fangs and the yellow wolf eyes. His stare made everyone uncomfortable, even Remus couldn’t help but stiffen once the others gaze was on him. Even though he despised him, something about Randall felt familiar and that caused Remus to get even more distance between them than before.</p><p>Romulus on the other hand didn’t seem to mind the company. There was no denying that Randall was an experienced fighter but Remus doubted his intentions. He was gone too often, was behaving strangely and one time they had found a corpse of one of their members. Remus had been sure, that the dead one was seen with Randall before plus he had smelled blood on the latter yet Romulus wasn’t listening to him.<br/> With a furrowed brow, the younger one tried focusing on the map, then shook his head. “That’s never going to work. We either have to go in before that point or after the entered the forest, otherwise were too much in the open”, he explained, gesturing and pointing out better starting points. The leader nodded thoughtfully, his arms crossed. “I think, the forest is our best option. They are going to be constricted by the trees and we know that terrain. If anything goes wrong, we are able to get back to the camp safely.”<br/> Remus nodded slightly “That’s what I had been thinking, too” He felt the piercing gaze of Randall on him and tried to ignore it, tried to focus on his task. Romulus was quiet for a couple of minutes, then he spoke up again “Randall, what do you think about that? Would you agree?” The bigger one grinned and looked at the map. “Well, you know me, I wouldn’t care if we were in the op or not but I understand your thoughts. And the little one is the brain, right? So he probably knows better.”</p><p>The younger one clenched one fist under the table. He knew, he wasn’t as well built as most of the other werewolves but that didn’t mean he was unable to fight. Yes, he preferred to stay at the camp, to help training and planning instead of participating in raids but nonetheless, he was one of the pack’s quickest and most agile fighters. He had to be, otherwise he wouldn’t have survived that long.<br/> Noises from outside changed the trios focus. Remus pushed himself off the desk. “I’m going to see, what’s going on” but Randall already had reached the tent’s entrance. “No need for that, I’m going to be right back.” He hesitated but relaxed again after receiving a signal from Romulus. As the bigger man left, he could see that the sun almost had vanished behind the hills. Rubbing his neck with one hand, he turned back to the table, trying to ignore the commotion from outside and focus on finalizing their plan. He knew that sending him outside had been a mistake and his feeling was confirmed once he came back.</p><p>“Well? What is going on out there?” Romulus asked once the entrance opened up again. Remus raised his gaze to see Randall grinning. Suddenly, he took everything in at once. There was someone behind the big werewolf, someone with blond, almost white hair. The sound outside now had transformed into screams and fighting noise. There was something else, often followed by cracking or a pained scream. It was too late, when he recognized the sound.</p><p>Spells. Someone was casting spells.</p><p>He sprinted across the tent, trying to get to Randall, but the other one stepped aside, revealing the man beside him. Before Remus could make out any kind of detail, he was blinded by a light and thrown back into the table. He groaned out of pain and tried to get up but was pushed into the dirt again by something heavy. No, someone heavy. Remus tried to struggle but Randall only laughed. “You were smart, little one. The only one that saw through me. Kind of at least. And yet you weren’t clever enough to prevent all of this.”<br/> The younger one was forced to watch as Romulus fought against the wizard but even the strongest and fastest one couldn’t avoid the spells that flared around the tent for a long time. It didn’t take long and the wizard conjured a spell that put Romulus in shackles. Remus gave of a desperate scream as his leader, his idol, his friend got dragged out by a chain that connected to the collar around his neck like a dog. With a last attempt Remus tried to free himself, seemingly surprising the one that held him down so he could actually break free from the hold. He rolled to his feet, then attacked Randall blindly. Never in his life had he been that angry. He had never wanted to kill someone. Until now.</p><p>The other werewolf didn’t seem to have expected his sudden movement and was thrown to the ground by him. “You traitor! How could you? How could you betray your own kind?” In any other situation, Remus would have been shocked by his own actions yet right now his mind was hazed with fury. He had fought for this group, given everything to them to free his people, trying to find a way to get rid of the royal families. And now everything he had done, he had sacrificed, it had been for nothing. Useless. His friends and family, the people he had spent most of his life with were out there, getting killed or put in chains.<br/> He tried to break the bigger ones defence and couldn’t get his mind to care for his surroundings. It was clear that what he did was a huge mistake but he’d rather die now than get enslaved by the ones that degraded his people.</p><p>Without a warning pain shot through his body. Something had cut through the back of his tunic, cut into his flesh. While his body tried to cope with the pain, he got slammed into the ground by Randall. Looking up, there was the wizard again, wand directed at Remus’ face. “Good, job, Fenrir. Your Master will be pleased.”<br/> Remus stiffened. Fenrir. He knew that name. He knew that man. Now it was clear, why he always had seemed oddly familiar. His body went limp and he closed his eyes, remembering the night when someone had broken into their house, killed his parents and transformed him. New scars had changed that face and Remus had been blind enough to ignore the feelings telling him that something was wrong.<br/> His mind wandered back to the current situation. Fenrir was holding his arms in an iron grip behind his back and pulled him onto his knees. Opening his eyes again, he looked the wizard straight into the eyes, expecting this to be his final moments. To his surprise, the fair-haired man only flicked his wand, chaining Remus up like he had done it with Romulus. “He is strong. He will be a good addition to the arena. Get him to the others.”</p><p>Fenrir dragged him onto his feet and outside. The fight was over. He could see the corpses of the guards. The survivors ware lines up behind a wagon. On there, Romulus sat, chains keeping him kneeling on the wooden planks. His eyes were closed and he didn’t move. Of course, they had taken out the leader to get the rest of the pack to surrender. Even the children were in chains and Remus clenched his fists again. He was pushed in line, his gaze mounted onto Romulus back.<br/> The wizards set fire to the tents, burning down everything the pack had owned and while the orange flames were devouring the hopes of his kind, he was dragged forward, forced to walk. He knew where they were going. And nothing but pain and death would await them there.</p>
