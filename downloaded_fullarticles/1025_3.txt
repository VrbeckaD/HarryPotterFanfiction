    <p><br/>Our only hope was dead. Harry had been killed by Voldemort. Ron was brought down by Fenrir Greyback and Hermione perished in a duel with Bellatrix Lestrange. She held her own along with Ginny and Luna for as long as they could. There were only a few survivors left, including Professor McGonagall. We were barricaded in the Great Hall. “Take this.” She hands me a strange looking object. “You are our last hope for the future. Turn the dial once and it will take you back to before it all began. Make sure that the same mistakes aren’t made in the past.” I nod. “Now, go.” I turn the dial once and everything begins to get blurry, and I pass out.</p><p><br/>I feel myself begin to come to conscious. “Thank you for bringing her here. Mr. Riddle.” I hear a female voice say. “She could have died from the cold out there. To think, wearing these odd and flimsy clothes out in the cold.”</p><p><br/>“I was just doing my rounds, Madam Causer.” A silky-smooth male voice replies, and I open my eyes, and squint at the bright light.</p><p><br/>“Can you turn that down?” The light dims, and my vision starts to come back. “Thank you. So, why am I here?”</p><p><br/>“Mr. Riddle, over here, found you outside by the Great Hall.” Madam Causer explains. “Do you know who you are?” I look at Tom briefly. Damn, I gotta admit, he’s good-looking but I turn my attention towards Madam Causer.</p><p><br/>“Géroux, Reine Géroux.” I decide to use my middle name instead of my first name. “I probably should have asked first but, where am I?” I have to make my story believable and thank god, I know how to barrier my mind.</p><p><br/>“The Hospital Wing at Hogwarts.”</p><p><br/>“Right, what’s the date?” Madam Causer narrows her eyes. “I mean, how long have I been out for?”</p><p><br/>“A couple of hours.” Madam Causer answers with a kind smile. “It’s still the 2nd of January. How did you end up here?”</p><p><br/>“Well, I’m a transfer student from Beauxbatons and something went wrong with my portkey.” I lie. “My mum wanted me transferred here to not be on mainland Europe due to Gellert Grindelwald at large, and the World War.” Madam Causer nods in understanding.</p><p><br/>“Understandable.” She replies. “From my scans, you are completely fine to go now. You did have a split lip, several cuts on your face as well as bruises, and a dislocated elbow but they’re all healed. Mr. Riddle, would you mind showing Reine to the Headmaster’s office? He should still be up doing paperwork.”</p><p><br/>“Of course, Madam Causer.” Tom replies and I stand up.</p><p><br/>“Oh, before I forget, wear this elbow brace for the next two weeks.” She places it on my bad elbow. “As a precaution.” I smile.</p><p><br/>“Thank you for treating me, Madam Causer.”</p><p><br/>“You’re very welcome, dear.” She responds. “Now, off to the Headmaster’s office.” Tom and I walk out of the Hospital Wing, and we walk in silence before he breaks the silence.<br/>“What was it like at Beauxbatons?” He asks, and I shrug.</p><p><br/>“Magical.” I tease, and I see him raise an eyebrow. “No pun intended. It was brilliant. What’s it like at Hogwarts?”</p><p><br/>“Magical.” He repeats, and I raise an eyebrow at him. “Hogwarts is like home. Slytherin is the best house, of course. Then Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Gryffindor.”</p><p><br/>“Oh, and you’re not biased at all.” I point to his uniform and he smirks. “I don’t get the whole houses thing. We didn’t have them at Beauxbatons. All it would cause is inter-house conflict, right?”</p><p><br/>“Well, you’re not wrong.” He supplies. “There are house rivalries between Slytherin and Gryffindor.”</p><p><br/>“Because of the rivalry between Salazar Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor?” Tom nods. “By the way, Reine Géroux.” I stick out my hand.</p><p><br/>“Tom Riddle.” He shakes my hand. “Pureblood.” I roll my eyes.</p><p><br/>“Don’t tell me that you care about Blood Purity?” He raises an eyebrow.</p><p><br/>“And you don’t?” He retorts.</p><p><br/>“No, of course not.” I answer. “There were plenty of muggle-borns in Beauxbatons.” I pause for a moment. “Anyway, I’m a part of one of the Wealthiest Pureblood families in Europe, I can think what I like.”</p><p><br/>“I knew that I knew your surname from somewhere.” Tom says after a long moment. “You come from a very long-line of Purebloods. The oldest in Europe. The Géroux have a rare trait of being Metamorphmagus like the Gaunts, Slytherin’s descendants, can speak Parseltongue.” I nod.</p><p><br/>“That’s right, we do. We are descended from the original Metamorphmagus.” I explain, and I change my hair to bright blue. “Like that.”</p><p><br/>“I prefer the brunette colour.” I roll my eyes and change it back to the original colour. “We’re here.” He says the password and we move up the stairs, and he knocks on the door.</p><p><br/>“Come in.” A voice says from the other side and we walk in. There was Headmaster Dippet and a younger looking Professor Dumbledore on some chairs. “Hello Tom, Hello Miss…?”</p><p><br/>“Géroux. Transfer from Beauxbatons.” He pauses for a moment and considers my eyes as I plead for him to not expose me.</p><p><br/>“Of course, Miss. Géroux. Thank you for leading her here, Tom.”</p><p><br/>“Of course, Headmaster.” Tom says with a nod. “I must be getting back to my rounds.”</p><p><br/>“Of course. You’re dismissed.” Tom takes his leave and I slump in a chair.</p><p><br/>“Tea?” Professor Dumbledore asks with a twinkle in his eye and I nod. He pours me some tea.</p><p><br/>“I need help.” I state to both Dumbledore and Dippet. “I’ve been sent from the future as we have lost our only hope in surviving.”</p><p><br/>“Surviving what?” Headmaster Dippet asks.</p><p><br/>“The Wizarding War.” I confess after a few moments. “I’m from the 2nd of May 1998.”</p><p><br/>“That explains the clothes.” Dumbledore muses. “What exactly happens?”</p><p><br/>“If I tell you this, you cannot tell anyone else.” They both nod. “It starts in the 40’s before Dumbledore defeats Grindelwald in 1945.” Dumbledore widens his eyes. “Tom Riddle creates a horcrux.” They both take an intake of breath. “He creates it in June of 1943. Wait, what’s the year?”</p><p><br/>“1943.” Dippet states.</p><p><br/>“Thank god, I’m in time.” I pause for a moment. “He creates the horcrux by using the Basilisk to kill Myrtle Warren. Yes, he is a Parselmouth and a direct descendant of Slytherin himself. His mother was Merope Gaunt. She died in childbirth.” I pause for another moment. “In August of this year, he kills his father and creates another horcrux using the Marvolo ring then frames his uncle who if we are being honest, is quite mad.” I pause. “Between 1946 and the 70’s, he creates 3 more horcruxes. Slytherin’s locket, Hufflepuff’s Cup and Ravenclaw’s Diadem. Tom rises to power as Lord Voldemort in the 70’s but is defeated on the 31st of October 1981 which concludes the First Wizarding War but, what we didn’t know until recently, was that he created a Horcrux in Harry which is the person who defeated him. Then, he came back at the end of my 4th year. This starts the Second Wizarding War where Voldemort then creates another horcrux using Nagini. Voldemort wins on the 2nd of May 1998. I am the last hope in changing the future. So, can you help me? Or not?” They both stare at me for a couple of minutes.</p><p><br/>“You may have been right about Mr. Riddle, Albus.” Dippet apologises.</p><p><br/>“He had us all fooled.” Dumbledore forgives. “What exactly is your strategy?”</p><p><br/>“Being one step ahead. First, we are going to kill that Basilisk.” I answer.</p><p><br/>“Where is this Basilisk, exactly?”</p><p><br/>“In the Chamber of Secrets, of course.” I answer. “The Basilisk is Slytherin’s monster in the Chamber of Secrets.”</p><p><br/>“You know where it is?” They ask.</p><p><br/>“Of course. Luckily, I know a bit of Parseltongue because Voldemort’s trait passed onto Harry.” I explain. “So, we are able to get into the Chamber.”</p><p><br/>“But how do we kill it?” Dumbledore questions.</p><p><br/>“Godric Gryffindor’s sword killed it in my future.” I reply. “And the Basilisk fang can be used to destroy a Horcrux if need be.” They nod. “Second, we steal Marvolo’s Ring. We make sure that Morfin is arrested again which will be easy because he likes to mess with muggles. Then, we move the Riddle Family out of the area completely. Like, maybe to South Africa or something. By the way, Tom’s a half-blood not Pure-blood, and he’s ashamed of it.” Dumbledore raises an eyebrow. “Third, we need to steal the locket, the cup and the diadem before he can create them into Horcruxes.”</p><p><br/>“This is all well and good but what if he just uses other objects for horcruxes?” Dippet asks.</p><p><br/>“Good question. Professor Dumbledore, in the future, you are the Headmaster of Hogwarts for most of my Hogwarts’ career. You always say that Tom Riddle could never love but what if we try? Maybe someone he loves could pull him out of his childish beliefs that kill thousands of people.”</p><p><br/>“From what you told me, the whole story, I don’t think someone who loved could do that.” Dumbledore points out.</p><p><br/>“We have to try, please.” I beg. “For the greater good. There must be someone in Slytherin right for him?” They both frown.</p><p><br/>“He’s never really shown an interest. He just uses his gentlemanly charm.” Dippet responds. “We’ll work on that, in the meantime, let’s stick to this strategy.”</p><p><br/>“When do Prefect stop their rounds?” I ask.</p><p><br/>“Right about now.” Dippet answers.</p><p><br/>“Then let’s go and kill a Basilisk.” I reply and get up.</p><p><br/>“We need the sword.” Dumbledore retorts and I smile before getting the sorting hat. Don’t fail me now. I put my hand in the hat and pull out the sword. “Only a true Gryffindor can pull out the sword when in need.”</p><p><br/>“We need to go to the second-floor girl’s bathroom. That’s where the entrance is.” I instruct and we make our way down to the bathroom. It was weird not seeing Moaning Myrtle flying about. Dippet creates wards in the bathroom, so, no one could come in. I make some hissing sounds and the chamber opens. I could tell that Dumbledore and Dippet were awestruck. “Ready?” They nod and I jump down first, landing on the bones again. Ugh. After they were down, we make our way through the cavern and to the big metal door. I say some more hissing sounds and the door opens. We climb through and stand in the big chamber with Slytherin’s face, and there was the door. “You must remember to not look at the Basilisk in the eye. It will kill you. If you the Basilisk’s eye in the reflection of the water, you’ll only be petrified. I’m hoping that it’s sleeping.” I cross the water and hide to the side of the entrance in Slytherin’s beard. I make sure more hissing sounds and the door opens. I heard the hissings of the Basilisk and as soon as it pokes its head out, I impale my sword through the top of it’s head. It screeches in pain and withering about, before flopping down, dead. “We did it…”</p><p><br/>“This has just certified the truth for me.” Dippet comments.</p><p><br/>“Why didn’t you ask for my memories?” I ask with a frown.</p><p><br/>“Memories can be altered.” Dippet answers and I nod in agreement. That was true. “Now for the second thing that needs to happen, we can have a weekend at Hogsmeade, and you and Albus can apparate and sort out the situation. I have to keep a close eye on things here.” I nod in agreement.</p><p><br/>“Okay.” I agree. “So, who wants to sleep?” They chuckle as we make our way back to the surface. “So, I’m going by the backstory that I’m a transfer from Beauxbatons. I know I’m 18 but I must be 16 to be disguised in Tom’s year. Professor, I need you to get in touch with Delphine Géroux and Franҫois Géroux. They are my great-grandparents. They need to be informed as well because I need to pose as their daughter and I know, Professor Dumbledore, that you know them.”</p><p><br/>“Of course.” Dumbledore replies as we get back to the surface. I hiss again and it closes. “Now, where for you to sleep?”</p><p><br/>“You’ll be placed in the guest wing and you’ll be sorted in the morning. I’ll borrow a potion from Horace for getting your age back to 16, so, you’ll pass for a 5th year. I presume that you need to be sorted in Slytherin for this to all work?” I nod. “Discuss it with the hat, he’ll understand.” He leads me to a door. “Here is your room. It can only be opened by you until you are sorted. 8:30am in the hall.” I nod.</p><p><br/>“Thank you, Headmaster Dippet, Professor Dumbledore.” I thank them before going into my room and laying on my bed, quickly falling asleep.</p><p><br/>I walk up and widen my eyes in surprise to the robes folded on my bedside table with a potion. Thank you. I get dressed and down the potion, and make my way to the hall. I approach the table where Dippet smiles at me before standing up as I stand next to him. “Hello, students. We have a transfer student from Beauxbatons, Miss. Reine Géroux. She’ll be in 5th year but needs to be sorted.” I sit on the stool and Dippet places the hat on my head.</p><p><br/>“Hmm…I seem to have done this before to you but in the future.” The hat muses. “Your future is devastating from what I see, so, you need this plan to work.”</p><p><br/>“Yes.” I reply in my head.</p><p><br/>“Then in that case, better be…SLYTHERIN!” The hat shouts and Slytherin table claps, and I make my way down. A girl stands and waves me over, and gestures for me to sit, so, I do.</p><p><br/>“Hello, I’m Walburga Black, 6th year and prefect.” This is Sirius’ mother?! I shake her outstretched hand.</p><p><br/>“Reine Géroux.” I reply and I shake multiple hands with 5th and 6th year girls. A couple of Burke’s, Rosier, Yaxley, Greengrass, Avery, Lestrange and obviously, Walburga from the Black Family. “So, what am I in for at Hogwarts?”</p><p><br/>“Well, people will try and get engaged to you.” Walburga says, bluntly. “Orion, my second cousin, has been trying to for years. He’s a 2nd year.”</p><p><br/>“Seriously?” I ask and Yaxley nods.</p><p><br/>“Yep, and you have just become game.” Erica Yaxley, 5th Year, answers. “Considering that your family is one of the oldest and wealthiest Pure-Blood families in Europe, everyone will want your hand.”</p><p><br/>“Fuck.” I curse under my breath. “Luckily, my parents always said that I could choose who I marry. Actually, most of my family have illegitimate children.” They gasp. “It’s a French thing.” Complete lie.</p><p><br/>“Oh, different culture to ours, I suppose.” I nod. “Do you just speak French, or do you speak other languages as well?”</p><p><br/>“I speak English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Romanian.” I respond. “My parents and I moved a lot.”</p><p><br/>“Impressive.” Michelle Avery, 5th Year, murmurs. “Is it true that every Géroux family member gets a tribal wolf tattoo when they’re 16 or when they marry into the Géroux family?” I raise an eyebrow. “It’s an honest question.”</p><p><br/>“It’s true but I can’t show you it, it’s against the rules.” I insist. “I was 16 back in November. I got it done at Christmas.”</p><p><br/>“Was it painful?” Yaxley questions.</p><p><br/>“Not at all.” I answer. “But pain is different for each person.”</p><p><br/>“Should you ladies be talking about such crude practices?” A boy with platinum blonde hair asks and I roll my eyes. Of course, it’s a Malfoy.</p><p><br/>“It’s a custom that has been in my family over two millennia. We can trace the custom that far back and we can trace our lineage even further.” I pause for a moment. “Tell me, how far can you trace your family lineage to?”</p><p><br/>“The Normal Conquest.” He answers, sneeringly.</p><p><br/>“Only a thousand years?” I shake my head in disapproval. “Shame.” The girls around me snicker and I turn my attention to them.</p><p><br/>“You certainly took him down a notch or two.” Rose Burke, 6th Year, says in approval and lowers her voice. “Be cautious, Abraxas Malfoy is not one to mess with.”</p><p><br/>“Trust me, I am very proficient at duelling and transfiguration.” I mutter back. “I could turn him into a ferret.” They all start giggling. They don’t seem so bad now. Why are they so bad in the future? Is it Riddle’s influence?</p><p><br/>“Miss. Géroux?” I hear the voice of Horace Slughorn call as he approaches. “I’m Professor Slughorn, I’m the Head of Slytherin house.” I shake his hand. “This is your timetable. You’re taking an impressive 10 subjects but your transfer papers all indicated that you were the top of your class.” It was always between Hermione and I, but I guess that isn’t the point. “Well, good luck to you and if you have any questions just ask.” He looks at the entire table. “I think all of you should be thinking about going to lessons now.” With that, we make our way to our first lesson, transfiguration. Transfiguration was always my favourite subject. I learnt how to be an Animagus in 3rd and 4th year. Unregistered but still, I learnt. Well, there isn’t a registry in France, there is one in Britain which I don’t have to sign on because I’m French. I follow all the ladies into Transfiguration and walk to the desk where Professor Dumbledore sits.</p><p><br/>“Professor Dumbledore, where should I sit?” I ask.</p><p><br/>“Ah, Mr. Riddle.” I turn towards Tom. “You seem to have, now, gained a partner in Transfiguration.” I nod and walk over, and sit next to him.</p><p><br/>“How good are you at Transfiguration?” He whispers asks.</p><p><br/>“I’m so good at transfiguration that I’m already an Animagus.” I answer. “We don’t have a registry in France to register on and because I’m French, I don’t have to sign the British registry.”</p><p><br/>“That’s a nice loophole.” He muses. “But you’re going to have to prove it.” I shrug and transform into a grey wolf. Professor Dumbledore and the students turn to stare at me.<br/>“It seems we have an Animagus in our midst.” Dumbledore states with a twinkle in his eye. “Thank you for the demonstration, Miss. Géroux. I award you 10 points for this wonderful display. You may turn back now.” I turn myself back and pick up my pen again, and turn to Tom with an eyebrow raised.</p><p><br/>“Point taken.” He murmurs and turns to the board. I smirk and turn towards the teaching. It continued like this for most of the day. Tom seemed to be the only person who always had a space free next to him. Clearly, he likes to work alone. Evidently, it’s how he is in the future. I make my way to Slytherin table for dinner. Suddenly, an owl stoops in and drops a letter at me.</p><p><br/>“Probably my parents,” I mutter and open the letter.</p><p> </p><p><em>Pour ma fille chérie,</em><br/> <em>Je sais que quitter Beauxbatons était soudain. Cependant, je vous ai entendu vous installer. Slytherin est un bon choix. Slytherin est ambitieux, comme vous. Envoyez-nous une lettre bientôt. Nous t'aimons.</em><br/> <em>Tes parents,</em><br/> <em>Delphine and Franҫois x</em></p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore did it and I smile. “As I suspected, just my parents congratulating me on getting into Slytherin. Poor owl had to travel from Spain, so, he’s probably hungry.”<br/>“You could take him up to the owlery?” Walburga suggests. “They have owl seeds in there.”</p><p><br/>“Good idea. Save me some potatoes, please?” The girls nod and with the owl on my arm, I walk to the owlery. I pass Flitwick’s future office and make my way up the icy steps. I had to be very careful here, but I make it. I place the owl in the owlery. “I’ll send a letter tomorrow morning, alright? You rest here.” The owl hoots before eating the seed I place in front of him. “Good owl.” I abruptly turn and bump into Tom. I narrow my eyes. “Why are you here? Sending a letter?”</p><p><br/>“No as Prefect, I’m meant to make sure people don’t get lost.” I raise an eyebrow. “Although, you surprisingly knew where you were going.”</p><p><br/>“Oh, Headmaster Dippet showed me a map of the school.” I reply. “It was quite interesting.” I felt something try to invade my mind. “Really, Mr. Riddle? All children of the Géroux are taught Occlumency before they go to school. I’m also a proficient Legilimens myself but I don’t use it to invade people’s minds when I don’t need too.” I narrow my eyes at him and he had the decency to look sheepish.</p><p><br/>“First, you end up at Hogwarts, bruised and battered. Second, you know how to turn into an Animagus. Third, you know Occlumency and Legilimency.” He lists off. “Anything else to add?”</p><p><br/>“I’ve been able to do a Patronus Charm since I was 14.” I whip out my wand and my Patronus runs around before disappearing. “Naturally, it’s also a wolf.”<br/>“And you know the Patronus Charm.” Tom adds in. “Who are you?”</p><p><br/>“Reine Géroux.” I answer. “Now, I’m getting back to dinner. I’m hungry.” I brush past him. “Are you coming? It is rude to decline an invitation of dinner in Britain, I hear.” Tom snorts.</p><p><br/>“It is.” Tom confirms and holds out his arm for me to take. I do, and we make it down the icy steps.</p><p><br/>“They should really put more precautions on those steps in Winter.” I mutter and Tom nods in agreement.</p><p><br/>“Quite a few students have fallen up and down them.” Tom explains, and we make our way into the hall, and make our way to our respective seats when the hall falls silent.</p><p><br/>“Did you just walk in with Tom Riddle on your arm?” Rachel Burke, 5th Year, leans over and whispers.</p><p><br/>“Yes, is that a bad thing?”</p><p><br/>“He is the most handsome and eligible bachelor in school.” Avery explains.</p><p><br/>“I’m not looking for someone to court.” I reply, and they give me a look. I decide to tell a white lie. “My betrothal passed away over the Summer. A blood malediction. It resurfaced after generations had passed.” They look at me, sympathetically and say their condolences. “It’s alright. I’m through the grieving process.” Well, I was dating someone called Edmund Gottschalk. A half-blood at Durmstrang. I met him during my 4th year and it went from there. He died by Rodolphus Lestrange hand. Technically, if I’m here and the future didn’t happen then he isn’t dead because he doesn’t exist yet. <em>I do love him but I don’t think I was in love with him.</em></p>
