    <p class="p1">There was a part of Harry that wanted to retreat and hideaway inside Grimmauld Place after the war. There had been to much loss, too much hurt and pain. He couldn’t face the Weasley’s, they’d lost Fred<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>because of him. He couldn’t face Hermione who had gone to Australia to find her parents only to find that they had been killed in car crash two months previously. He blamed himself for that too. For two months he holed himself up in his house, not accepting visitors or messages. The only reason he stayed alive was down to the crotchety old house elf who he lived with.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">On the day of his birthday he refused all visitors, left gifts unopened and replied to no ones messages. That didn’t stop Andromeda Tonks. For a fortnight she hounded him until poor Kreacher caved and let her past. She was a Black descendant after all.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">She took one look at Harry and ordered Kreacher to pack a bag for Harry and took him back to her own house. “Dora and Remus would never forgive me if I let you live like this Harry. You’ll stay here until you’re better.” Harry hadn’t known he was unwell until she’d said it.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">The next thing he knew she’d placed a crying baby in his arms and a bottle. “Your godson needs you Harry.” He held the bottle to Teddy’s mouth and he quietly latched on and began drinking the warmed milk. Teddy’s changing shades of blue eyes held onto Harry’s own and for the first time in months he felt something other than emptiness and guilt.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">From that day onwards he’d been seeing a healer at a specialist clinic in London to help him. It came as no surprise when the healer suggested that Harry was suffering from PTSD, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. After all he’d been through it was no surprise really. His healer was helping him repair friendships and connections with the people he loved the most and therefore pushed away to protect himself. On the hard days it was Teddy who brought him round and made him get out of his bed and go to his sessions. There was something about the ever changing features of his godson that made him want to be better, made him want to recover.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">One of those steps was selling Grimmauld Place. He couldn’t stay there. Kreacher had been horrified to find out his plan and had hated the idea of leaving the house that had been his home for so long but he’d taken a paid position at Hogwarts over being freed.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Another step was for Harry to return to school and finish his education. That had taken him some convincing on both Hermione and his healer’s part. To return back to the place where so many of his friends died. To the place he died.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">But that’s where he found himself on September first. Sitting at a table in the room he’d fought Voldemort in, in the room the dead had been laid out in. He felt sick to his stomach but he didn’t let it show on his face. Instead he sat quietly, clapped when he was supposed to and pushed food around his plant to fool those around him that he was eating. When the headmistress sent everyone to their common rooms except the small class of eighth years he sat quietly and listened, longing for the moment he could lock himself in his room for the night.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1" align="center">***</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“But Professor that means-“</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“Yes Miss Granger it does. This was the fairest way.” McGonagall explained, “Now off to bed with you all classes start in the morning.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Ron and Harry both looked at Hermione neither understanding her conversation with the headmistress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Are you going to explain?” Ron shrugged.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“We’ve been allocated rooms based on alphabetical order.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“Yeah and?”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Hermione exhaled loudly, Ron and Harry could be so dense at times. “Boot and Cornfoot are in room 1. Seamus and Justin are in 2 and Goldstein and Neville are in 3. Which means that,” Hermione paused to take a breath. Only she was beaten to it by the blonde walking past them.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“You’re in room 4 with me Potter.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“No fucking way!” Ron swore. Harry didn’t say anything he’d been too busy watching Malfoy walk out of the Great Hall who was quickly followed out by Pansy and Blaize. Malfoy was the next step in his recovery.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“It’s not fucking fair. He’s just killed fucking Snake Face and now he has to share a room with Ferret Face! How can McGonagall do this to him?”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“Ron!” Hermione hissed through gritted teeth, her eyes flicked in the headmistress’s direction.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">McGonagall cleared her throat and all eyes turned to face her, Ron’s face went as red as the hair on his head. “I think Mr Weasley, we need to have a chat in my office. I hope Mr Potter that you and Mr Malfoy will be dealing with the situation with maturity?”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Harry gave a swift bob of his head, “Yes Professor.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">“Good. Now off to bed with you all. Mr Weasley follow me.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">The rest of the eighth years exited the Great Hall quickly not wanting to be on the end of a telling off from McGonagall on their first night. Harry didn’t wait around for Hermione he just wanted to go to bed. He didn’t want to talk about the injustice. Injustice was being wrongfully killed before leaving your teens, not having to share a room with someone you didn’t like.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1" align="center">***</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Draco Malfoy didn’t want to be back at Hogwarts. He’d rather be anywhere else. But he wasn’t. He didn’t have a choice. It was his punishment.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">His father, Lucius Malfoy was currently serving an indefinite sentence at Azkaban for his role during the war and despite a testimony from Potter himself stating that she saved his life, his mother, Narcissa was on house arrest for a year for her involvement. Draco’s own sentence was similar to his mother’s. The Wizengamot decided that his choices were not his own and that of his father and that they saw a chance for redemption. Draco had been ordered to return to school to complete his schooling or face Azkaban himself.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">So at eleven o’clock this morning he found himself sat in a compartment at the back of the train trying to keep away from everyone else on his way back to Hogwarts. A place that had been haunting his dreams for the longest time. Now he was back he didn't think that this would change.</p>
