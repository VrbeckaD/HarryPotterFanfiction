  <em>Wolfbane couldn’t see. Everything was as black as pitch. He couldn’t speak. No matter how hard he tried to, he couldn’t seem to even mutter a word. He couldn’t move. He strained his muscles, trying to blink, scratch his nose, anything. But nothing happened. All he knew was that it was cold. So cold.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The teenage boy started to hyperventilate. He hated the dark and the creatures that seemed to stalk him when the lights went out. His breathing increased in pace until his body was shaking and he had to gasp to even inhale properly. Suddenly, a small light, like the flickering light of a candle, appeared in front of him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Wolfbane stood, despite the protesting in his legs, and tried to walk towards the light. Instead of getting closer, like he expected, it seemed to get farther away from him with every step. He started to run at the light, thinking that the faster he traveled towards the small pin prick of light, the faster he would arrive in front of it. Unfortunately, Wolfbane’s theory was incorrect. The faster he ran, the faster the light seemed to travel away from him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He fell to his knees, wheezing and gasping, trying to regain his breath. The air around him was so frigid that his breath came out in a wispy cloud of white. Wolfbane shivered violently. He spat a curse and slammed his shaking fist into the ground, letting out a broken sob when he realized how much it actually hurt. The sound seemed to echo, sound waves bouncing off of the walls and ceiling for what seemed like forever. Eventually, after an eternity of listening to his broken sob again and again and again, the sound faded into the endless black that surrounded him, and he felt alone again.</em>
</p><p><em>Then, a haunting melody seemed to seep through the infinite blackness, bringing with it color. Beautiful blues, and gorgeous greens. It started out soft, so soft that the blonde boy had to strain his ears to hear it, but the volume was increasing with every second. The music seemed to paint a picture around Wolfbane. He sat and listened to it for what seemed like hours, the classical music, which sounded suspiciously like Schubert’s </em>Serenade, <em>comforting him, yet sending a chill running down his spine at the same time. After watching blues and greens and purples run together in front and around him, he was quite startled to see a stunning scarlet suddenly bloom like a crimson rose on the ground in front of him.</em></p><p>
  <em>Wolfbane extended his arm in front of him, trying to touch the red. When his fingers finally came in contact with the pool of scarlet, the scene suddenly changed. He was on his knees in the middle of his living room floor. His hand felt something warm and thick . He brought his hand up in front of his face. To Wolfbane’s horror, his hand was stained with blood. He looked down at the floor, and immediately found the source.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Wolfbane’s entire family lay in crumpled heaps on the floor. He saw his older sister, Belladonna, her black hair spilling about her like silk. His twin sister, Atropa, laid with her pale face toward the ceiling, her brown eyes open and seemingly lifeless.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Wolfbane, who couldn't find the strength to stand, crawled over to his twin. Out of all the blood that was oozing onto the floor, hers was the most sickening to look at. He picked up Atropa’s hand and held it to his cheek. He started sobbing uncontrollably. He cried like that for several minutes before he heard a rasping sound, which was coming from his twin's throat.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"W-wake u-up." Atropa said in a soft, raspy voice. Wolfbane opened his eyes, which he had closed when he had begun to cry, and looked at his twin's face. Her eyes, once a rich coffee brown, now a color equivalent to ditch water, were trained on his face. She opened her pale, chapped, lips, and said, "Wake up!" The voice in which she spoke was not her own. It sounded suspiciously like his mother.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Wolfbane looked over to where his mother was lying, and found that no, his mother was not the one that was speaking. This confused him greatly, because he had been sure that the voice he had just heard was his mother's. The teenage boy felt a tug on his wrist and he looked back down at his twin. She shakily raised her eyebrows into an elegant arch, and said in a much louder voice than before, "WAKE UP!"</em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Wolfbane sat up quickly, knocking his head against something solid, making the headache he had developed even worse. His eyes felt like they were throbbing in the sockets, and his brain didn’t feel much better. He opened his eyes and saw his mother standing over his bed, holding her forehead. Behind her were his two sisters, both looking genuinely concerned.</p><p>“Ouch!” His mother said. She rubbed her forehead to try and get rid of the dull ache.</p><p>“Sorry, Mum.” Wolfbane said quietly. He pinched the front of his long sleeved shirt and pulled it away from his chest, finding that it had been plastered there with sweat. As he stretched, his joints cracked and popped in a way that felt satisfying. Wolfbane tried in vain to remember what his nightmare had been about, but no matter how hard he tried, his mind kept drawing a blank. All he knew was that it left a bad taste in his mouth, and that he would rather let it be forgotten.</p><p>Atropa, who had noticed that her twin brother had been tensely spacing off, carefully tread over to his bedside. She took his slightly trembling hand from beneath the covers where he had had it, and started to stroke her thumb over his palm in a circular motion. The action had always calmed him, even when he had been a toddler, and he calmed down almost instantly as his sister's comfort took affect. Wolfbane leaned into his sister’s shoulder, and took a shaky breath.</p><p>The sleeve of his shirt began to ride up his arm slightly, showing the beginning of starch white bandages. Bandages that covered raw, open patches of pink flesh that Wolfbane had afflicted upon himself. Not that the act of afflicting such marks was an entirely conscious decision when such a thing happened, but nevertheless, they were present on his skin. Wolfbane noticed the appearance of his bandages, and was quick to yank his sleeve back down.</p><p>His mother gave him a tense and worried look before saying, “You three are going to be late for the train if you don’t hurry up and get dressed.”</p><p>Belladonna, who was already dressed in a black sundress and a pair of silver leggings, came over and gave them both a hug. She gave Wolfbane an extra kiss on the forehead for comfort, and then proceeded to pull Atropa out of the room so that Wolfbane could change in privacy. His mother followed the two girls and shut the door with a soft click.</p><p>Wolfbane stretched again and threw his legs over the side of his bed. He slowly walked over to his wardrobe and grabbed a blue and black flannel, a white tank top to go under it, a pair of jeans and his favorite pair of converses.</p><p>As he changed, he took time to re-bandage the most recent raw spots on his arms and sides, which he had gotten from a rather nasty anxiety attack. He always hated this part: the sting and burn of taking off the adhesive bandage, the shame and self-hatred as he took in the damage and assessed how the wound was healing, and the new burn and sting as he re-bandaged the wounds. As much as he hated this part, though, it was much better than having to deal with an <em>infected </em>wound, which just prolonged the pain as well as the process.</p><p>When he was done re-bandaging, Wolfbane tilted his head up and looked in the mirror. A pair of green eyes looked back at him from the mirror, and he was ashamed to admit that it took him a moment to truly register that they were his own eyes. In that moment, he blankly stared at the mirror, only seeing components of himself and not the whole. His face was thin, and his pallor did nothing to hide the bruise-like half moons under his eyes. Wolfbane also noticed, with a sense of careful indifference, that his face was rather blotchy and oily that morning. He didn't have the energy to do anything about it, though he wished he did.</p><p>After parting his short blonde hair and gelled it into place, he grabbed his prescription glasses, put them on his narrow nose, and went downstairs.</p><p>Peppermint, his pet peregrine falcon, was perched on the stairs railing, waiting for Wolfbane to come down and feed him. The auburn colored falcon, who had originally been the family messenger, but had become Wolfbane's personal companion (Atropa hated when he called Peppermint or any other non-human member of the family a 'pet'), had a parchment envelope clutched in her beak, and looked rather put out that he had not come down sooner to retrieve the note.</p><p>“Hey girl.” Said Wolfbane, gently petting his companion between her wings. He took the letter, and then promptly fed her a falcon treat that he had gotten at Eeylops Owl Emporium the other day when the family had taken a trip to Diagon Alley.</p><p>Wolfbane walked over to the kitchen table and sat down, setting the envelope on the table. He opened it, and read the letter. The letter was from his best friend, Aster. They had asked how he was and if he was doing okay. Seeing as he would see them on the train to Hogwarts today, he didn’t see reason in writing them back.</p><p>His mother, father, and both of his sisters all shuffled into the room, some of them (particularly Father) were still blinking sleep out of their eyes. Wolfbane quickly hid the letter, and acted like he wasn’t doing anything in particular. He didn’t want them to worry about it, because it would just cause stress in their lives that they didn’t need.</p><p>His mother (having had breakfast prepared before she had woken him up, apparently) placed a plate of food in front of him. It was filled with eggs and bacon and hash browns with little bits of green bell pepper in them. In all honesty, it looked delicious, but Wolfbane didn’t want to eat. His twin grabbed his hand under the table, and Wolfbane decided that one plate of food for his twin sister was the least that he could do.</p>
