    <p><em>It seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found dead in the roadway opposite it's master's yard. It had been fighting, and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away, and it's belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.</em> – Bram Stoker’s Dracula.</p><p><img title="2AC3A851-52E0-4AF0-8DDE-D2E5694F3A38.jpeg" src="https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/sugarwiccan/69428188/1436/1436_600.jpg" alt="2AC3A851-52E0-4AF0-8DDE-D2E5694F3A38.jpeg" data-pagespeed-url-hash="691647951" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/> </p><p> </p><p>   Harry traces his fingers indolently across the faded page his book, the old, yellowing paper feeling rough and fibrous beneath his fingertips, like a sheet of industrial fibreglass before it’s pressed and brushed with resin. It flakes and causes shreds of compressed pulp to come loose and dust the thighs of Harry’s jeans, and a piece of dried skin on his index finger catches near the bottom half of the page, pulls back a small flap of skin, making it rip and bead with blood.</p><p>Harry sucks the digit into his mouth in an attempt to smooth the crack with his tongue, staring idly down at the now blurred, black lines laid out before him: the words having merged long ago.</p><p>In the distance, he can hear the crashing of surf into the nearby cliffs, can almost feel the spray collecting on the evening wind, and it makes the air around Harry’s hotel room fetid with the briny smell of salt and fish as it is pushed through the gap of his open window.</p><p>It’s after another minute of enjoying the tranquillity of Poseidon’s domain before he’s resetting the book back upon floral sheets—trying not to dog-ear anymore pages—then he rises to meander over to said open window, leaning low over the cushioned window seat and splaying his hands on the white-glossed ledge.</p><p>A glance to his left shows a seascape of charcoal waves stretching out and coalescing with the darkening sky, still streaked in hues of rose, and two stark silhouettes of an old, disused lighthouse and walkway, both obscuring a quiet harbour; the lighthouse’s existence still known to seafarers by a red beacon of warning fixed upon it’s roof. Straight ahead, in the near distance, there’s the gothic ruins of Whitby Abbey and small church and graveyard before it, their shadows distinct and eerie against the crimson flushed sky. Harry can see the unwholesome allure that the ruins exude, understands why so many come to appease their morbid fascinations with death and the mythological romanticism surrounding it. He can see the peace and humility in walking the dirt paths between each gravestone and ruin, remembering that no matter the choices you make in life or the paths you choose to take, death comes for us all, at one point or another, and leads us back to the earth.</p><p>Harry wonders if a wizard’s magic is absorbed back into the earth when they die, wonders if that’s why earth magic is one of the rawest, most powerful forms of magic you can wield. He’s only ever attempted earth magic once, back when he’d found a tome on necromancy in the Black family library at Grimmauld Place. He’d only meant to open the veil and see Sirius, ask if he was alright—well, as alright as the dead can be—but what he’d gotten instead was the unwelcome apparition of Walburga Black—who had emerged shrieking from her God forsaken portrait.</p><p>For a week Harry’d had to endure Bloodist slurs following him around the house, even to the bathroom, and had had to put up with moving furniture and locking doors, his shower running too hot or too cold, or flooding the en suite and ruining his bedroom carpet. On one afternoon when he’d returned home, exhausted from Auror training, his sofa had even tried to eat him, pulling him back into the plush cushions until they’d covered his face and he couldn’t breath. That had been the last straw, well and truly. But it’d taken another three days before Harry’d figured out how to get rid of the old hag. In the end, he’d had to <em>Avada Kedavra</em> her portrait straight off the wall and burn it during a rather lengthy cleansing ritual. On the plus side though, Grimmauld Place seems a little more cheerier in Harry’s opinion.</p><p>He runs an even hand through his hair as he chuckles, remembering the outraged screams of Sirius’ mother as she’d faded away and the wailing cries of Kreacher as he’d sobbed in the back doorway, and his finger snags on a knot in his fringe, tightening it as it refuses to loosen, even as he tugs. Harry huffs and pulls his fingers free completely, leaning back on the window ledge.</p><p>Below him, the main road of West cliff is unusually free of traffic. Only a couple of cars are parked along the roadside, probably belonging to some of the hotel staff or guests, and across the way the Whalebone Arch’s usually whitewashed appearance is bathed in a honey hue thanks to the golden lights of the lampposts dotted along the street. The sun hasn't quite set yet, but already the lights surrounding the town of Whitby have begun to chase away any unwelcome darkness. An oddity, Harry is sure, that has continued on since the abhorrent days of the early 19th century.</p><p>This place is shrouded in history and folklore, and Harry had found it fascinating when he'd read through the case file that had landed on his desk Thursday morning; he’d headed straight down into the Ministry’s archives and pulled up old documents and articles—some dating back to the 12th century—depicting all sorts of unusual and arcane events that had warranted Ministry intervention, including the clearance of an infestation of Hobs at 109 Church Street.</p><p>The most notable, and relevant occurrence, however—the one that Harry had been the most interested in—was an esoteric ‘incident’ in 1890 that had to be concealed from Muggles in the form of a well orchestrated, mass Obliviation. Within that folder Harry’d found references to Abraham Stoker and, at the time, had obtusely wondered why a Muggle novelist had been documented as a key witness instead of being Obliviated along with the rest. It was only after a brief query with Rigel Rutherford (archive director) that Harry had discovered that Bram was not only a Wizard but that the 1890 ‘incident’ was Bram’s inspiration for the renowned gothic horror novel Dracula.</p><p>Harry snorts at his own naïvety; thirteen years in the wizarding world and he’s <em>still</em> learning. He sighs, bracing his arms across the window ledge to get more comfortable. The window seat edge digs into his thighs as he shifts but he pays no heed, simply shuts his eyes against the sharp breeze that tussles his long fringe aside, revealing his infamous lightning bolt scar.</p><p>Salt in the air grits into his skin, stings slightly, and for a suspended moment Harry fears that his now dormant cicatrix is active again. He chuckles at the absurdity; it hasn’t hurt once in the last five years since Voldemort’s demise, yet it's presence still hangs heavily over him like a suffocating smog. The pathetic blemish is a curse all on its own, a foreshadow that he’ll never have a simple life or a happy one, he knows. It’s a reminder of the darkness after the final battle, of the nightmares he couldn't escape from, of the arguments he couldn't let go of—the people he's lost.</p><p>He is tainted thanks to the horrors he’s faced, and sometimes he wonders whether some part of him got left behind in the forest that day. Or whether something had latched onto him at King’s Cross Station and hitched a ride back, marring his heart and sucking away all forms of emotion, leaving him empty. Disassociation the Mind Healers called it, and it had taken several different specialists two years to diagnose it as such. Harry hadn’t particularly cared about the names of what was wrong with him, he’d just wanted help.</p><p>Harry shifts to run a hand over his mouth, lets it linger there. Three years after Sirius' death he’d finally begun to mourn the loss. It’d hit him suddenly, seemingly out of no where on a Saturday afternoon when he was rinsing his favourite ‘Accio Coffee’ mug. And at the time, Harry hadn’t recognised it for what it was, he was just so overcome with longing and remorse for all the words left unsaid between him and his Godfather that he’d felt unreasonably panicked with anger and guilt. He’d had this frantic need to just have the impossible: a simple thing as having Sirius clap him on the back and say, “everything is going to be ok, Pup.”</p><p>Harry’d hated the universe right at that moment, had cursed it for it’s unfair cruelty, for taking what could have been and of what should have been, of not granting one simple wish to a grieving boy. A gaping hole bloomed in his chest that night, longing to be filled with love and happier memories before everything had gone to shit. It was too much—on that dreary Saturday night, it was simply too much.</p><p>In psychogenic hysteria, and delirium from a bottle of Ogden’s Old, Harry took his red Diablo out of London and pushed it to full throttle going up the M1; over revving the engine even though he was in 5th, his dash dial paused at 200mph even as he pressed harder on the accelerator. He’d just wanted to get away, be free from the darkness growing in his chest—but it was futile. He made it somewhere near the outskirts of Northampton, Rob Zombie’s Dragula (Hot Rod Herman Remix) playing full blast, before the rain logged road caused him to lose control, had caused the overpowered back end to flick out and make the car slide horizontally for at least 50 metres before Harry’s harsh foot on the break and wheel caused the car to finally flip.</p><p>It took him two days to wake up in St Mungo’s, and whilst there he’d been praised (again) for his overwhelming magical ability to survive; apparently he had unconsciously conjured a powerful variation of <em>Protego</em> just before his car had impacted with a concrete barrier, Hermione had said. It could have been worse, in Harry’s opinion, if he had found that necromancer book back then.<br/> <br/> Fortunately, when back at Grimmauld Place, his nightmares resurfaced and consumed most of his life. He’d wake up most nights, drenched in sweat, to the memory of his mother’s screams. And unable to get back to sleep, he’d wander down to the kitchen for a glass (or two) of Elven wine—to make it easier to relax enough for sleep, he’d tell himself. And he’d usually find Kreacher there meandering about in the pantry or near the stove, mumbling some such bollocks under his breath, and the sight of him would remind Harry of Dobby, of Regulus, and, consequently, of Sirius.</p><p>On those nights, Harry’d stay sat at the overly large kitchen table and drank glass after glass of wine, moving on to whiskey around 5am, telling Kreacher to “fuck off” every time the elf would try and badger Harry into going to bed. He’d stay and cry silently into his tumbler, head in his hand as he slumped drunkenly across the table, the grains of wood coming into focus and then out, wondering whether he'd get to hold his family again if he died—the kind where there was no coming back.</p><p>It would be so easy to just end his anguish, Harry thinks. And he hates that, hates that he can feel that way so readily.</p><p>Worse still, it occurred to him one day, months after the ‘accident’ as Ron and Hermione had deemed it, that he had no living family left (excluding the Dursleys, of course, who Harry pretended didn't exist after the hardship they'd caused him.) And even though the Weasleys accepted Harry as a son and brother, he’d never felt that he truly belonged; he loved them as they loved him, but they just didn’t feel like his family—they were the Weasleys, and he was a Potter; the last Potter.</p><p>He thinks that was why he’d suggested settling down to start a family with Ginny straight out of school. It was vacuous, looking back, and Ginny had point blank refused right out, declaring, "I’m only 18, Harry. I've only just come of age and I've got the opportunity of a lifetime with this training. I'm not ready to settle down. Will you wait for me?”</p><p>Foolishly, Harry had agreed. He’d waited for a further two years, by which time he was halfway through his Auror training and Ginny had finished her apprenticeship and accepted a permanent place with the Madrid Mosquitoes. Unsurprisingly, they’d hardly spent any time together, what with Ginny living all the way across the Channel and Harry busy sitting alone at Grimmauld Place with his bottles of alcohol.</p><p>He had visited her a few times when he could, of course, but he had felt just as lonely with her, even when they slept together. The last time they’d had sex, Harry had just lain there in the scrambled sheets, his eyes shut; the thrusting movement above him was enough to keep his erection from flagging, but he'd felt nothing. Still, he’d indulged her by waiting for her to slowly stop moving and cry out his name, keeping his eyes shut and trying to find arousal in the feel of her juices smearing into his pubic hair, dribbling down his balls and inner thighs—but he'd felt nothing, absolutely nothing.</p><p>“You haven't come... Do—do you want me to finish you off?” Ginny’d looked so confused and innocent as she’d stared down at him, which was ironic considering what they’d just done.</p><p>Harry’d opened his eyes to see her looking slightly offended too, even more so when he shook his head. She’d stared into his absent green eyes for a long moment, noting that there was no sentiment there, and slid off his withering cock to sit on the edge of the bed. With a slight frown she’d said, “I think we should talk Harry,” before looking over her shoulder at him still laid there staring at the ceiling.</p><p>That night she'd cried as she’d said, “it’s over” and “it’s for the best,” that she hoped Harry could find what, or who, he was looking for. Not likely, Harry had thought. And not that he even cared...</p><p>A knock at the door banishes Harry’s reverie. He turns towards it somewhat before, with a heavy exhale, he reaches to pull the window shut, slamming it and twisting the metal scroll on the frame to lock it. He bends to tighten the tanned leather strap on his thigh holster, placing his wand securely in it. Another final huff and he moves towards the door, finding Dean Thomas on the other side of it looking impatient and only slightly jaded.</p><p>“Took you long enough,” the dark skinned man says with a grunt, his voice deeper now than it was during the final years of Hogwarts, and he turns to walk down the hall, his bulky, Auror standard boots thudding dully against the carpet.</p><p>Harry makes sure his room door is shut and secure—trying the handle twice—before following after him, his own heavy boots scuffing in rhythm with the thuds coming from Dean’s.</p><p>They descend the communal staircase in silence, entering a small reception area where Dean nods to a busty brunette behind the front desk. She blushes beautifully, averting her gaze back to her computer screen, but not quite hiding a pleased smile. Harry raises an eyebrow at the exchange but says nothing as he and Dean push through the double doors to exit on to East Terrace.</p><p>Outside, the air is crisp, cool, and Harry can taste the surf on his chapped lips, salty and sour. His team is already waiting for him across the street, jacket collars pulled up around their necks to try and fight the bitter breeze.</p><p>Harry nods to Dean, who has stopped beside him in the middle of the deserted road, hands in his trouser pockets, awaiting instruction, and gestures for him to join the other three awaiting Aurors. Dean moves to stand before a bench that Terry Boot and Blaise Zabini are sat upon: Terry reading a leaflet that Harry has seen on a table in the hotel entrance hall, Zabini slouched with his legs stretched out and laughing along with Seamus Finnigan, probably about something that happened at last night’s pub crawl before they all port-keyed up here. Harry wouldn't know, though, he's only been four times in the whole three years it's been a tradition. It’s not something he’s interested in—socialising. He tends to get irate too easily and that doesn’t provide a good foundation for social interaction, he’s found.</p><p>As he approaches the group he notices that Seamus is bouncing his left foot against the front slat of the bench, and Harry grits his teeth together in exasperation as creaks of wood carry periodically across the small lea. He digs his nails into the palms of his hands in an attempt to try and quell his irritation. It’s then that Zabini notices Harry; he twists and jumps up to kneel against the bench, draping his arms across the back as he seems to study Harry as he nears.</p><p>“Come on Boss for Merlin's sake!” He shouts acerbically across the green, causing the other three Aurors to turn.</p><p>Harry frowns but nods at the group as he rounds to stand before them all, stuffing his hands into his jean’s pockets and widening his stance.</p><p>"Right—er, from what I've gathered in the reports from Robards, it's some sort of Canis we're after.” He ignores Zabini’s supercilious grin as the man moves to slump back down on the bench and face him properly. “Could be a werewolf. But, er—although, the body they found last week was obviously mauled outside of the full moon,” Harry mutters mostly to himself; he feels sick remembering the crime scene photos from the latest attack. Fortunately, or unfortunately, they’d been Muggle shots so they hadn't shown the true extent of blood still dripping from the victim's neck, her jugular shredded and exposed through the ripped skin of her throat.</p><p>“Hmm.” Zabini crosses his legs so that his foot brushes the inside of Harry’s calf and crosses his arms. “The muggle victim was so fucked up and eaten they couldn't determine an identification, could they?” He smirks when Harry takes a step back, brows knitting further. “Can't see regular old Clifford or Rover doing that.”</p><p>“Exactly, so I'm thinking werewolf,” Boot comments, folding his leaflet into his jacket pocket. “Which means it's pointless being here, why don't we come back in eight days—“</p><p>“Because we need to memorise and analyse our surroundings if this whole place is to be our hunting ground,” Harry huffs. He isn't having anyone weasel out of duty, not when he needs this case; the nightmares have started up again and he hasn't been able to draw his mind away from the Buck-Hunter knife nestled in his duffle bag upstairs. He needs the distraction. “Now let's split up and survey the area like we were deployed to.” He looks pointedly at Boot, who shifts uncomfortably.“And, er, look for tracks, magical abnormalities, disruptions, the usual.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes roam over the group. “Any questions?”</p><p>Seamus raises his hand. "Yeah. Why ‘as the Ministry sent five of us on an evidence scout?”</p><p>Harry sighs. “Well—“</p><p>“Because this is a high profile case and Robards want’s to see Potter here lead a team successfully and prove his worth before becoming the next Head Auror,” Zabini interrupts, regarding Harry with a contemptuous expression, a glint of teeth shining in the lamplight as he sneers. He widens his arms across the back of the bench and lounges back as though he’s on fucking holiday.</p><p>Harry’s nostrils flare and he hardens his stare as he faces Zabini more bodily.</p><p>"I won't be the next Head Auror," he corrects lowly. "But you're right, this is high profile. The Ministry is worried there may be a repeat performance of the events that happened back in 1890. It started out just the same, with animal attacks, after all."</p><p>Zabini snorts but makes no further comment, already standing and striding away, his Cuban heels clipping rhythmically against the road’s tarmac. The rest of the group slowly disperses too: Dean and Seamus heading along Cleveland Way and Boot making his way down a set of steep steps towards Khyber Pass.</p><p>Harry stays rooted to the spot as he follows the retreating figure that is Blaise Zabini wandering further down East Terrace. He wonders what’s got the former Slytherin in such a snit; he’s usually quite agreeable to Harry’s ideas and instincts, not cynical and sarcastic. Despite the Ministry’s culpability in most things and their blatant misconjecture, Harry knows that they have every right to feel nervous about a link between this case and that in 1890 after reading what he had in the archives.</p><p>It's common knowledge within the Wizarding world that Bram Stoker was a Muggleborn who lived within the Muggle world due to his ongoing interest with it’s culture and growing technology. What most didn’t know, however, was that he also worked as a Ministry philosopher within the Department of Mysteries and that his wife, Florence, was part of the Wizengamot.</p><p>Harry discovered that during Bram’s visit to Whitby in 1890, he was pulled into a local investigation that centred around the discovery of various mutilated animals being left around the grounds of Chole Manor. Bram reported that they had been strategically placed around the moors and gardens, with one Leporidae being tied to the front doors by its entrails. He sent the report of his unease to the Ministry and within five days a team of three Aurors had been dispatched to the small fishing village with the assumption that these strange occurrences were somehow connected to the supernatural world they were trying desperately to keep hidden.</p><p>The following day, while the Aurors conversed ideas with Bram over breakfast in his cliff hotel, they revealed that they had recently been to a horrific scene aboard an abandoned cargo ship further down the coast, near Flamborough Head. They spoke about how all sixteen crew members had been murdered and left with various body parts missing, their blood drained and their gold gone. It was with this knowledge that Bram suggested they were dealing with a vampire and that the animals being scattered around the moors surrounding Chole Manor were ‘gifts.’</p><p>His suspicions were confirmed on a Monday, he wrote in his statement, when the Mayor of Whitby had asked for his assistance—believing Bram to be a doctor—with his daughter, Charlotte. She had been acting peculiar, said the Mayor, and that she had a high fever and waxy complexion. Bram had immediately attended and, once examined, it was obvious to him that Charlotte was victim to the vampire; they’d already started her conversion to vampirism due to two small incisions on her wrist.</p><p>Further in the notes Harry had read, Bram wrote that he had tried to give Charlotte blood transfusions, to flush out the infection, but it was unsuccessful. He also wrote that he had had to give the Muggle Mayor and Chief constable a false name, a name of Bram Helsing (which Harry had chuckled at) and that he became mediator between the Muggle police and the Aurors.</p><p>It wasn’t until July 16th that the vampire finally revealed himself, presenting himself as Hans Muller just after having murdered the town’s Mayor and hanging him up from the bracing arches of Chorley House upon East cliff. He had called out Bram as a challenger—due to his futile attempts to help Charlotte—misspeaking his name as Van Helsing, and insisted that they duel right there and then upon the moors. He hadn’t, however, anticipated the many Aurors that had slowly started to circle him whilst he’d preened. And, in a fit of resigned rage, he’d jumped and shape-shifted into a giant, black dog, disappearing up onto the moors in a great blur.</p><p>It was another couple of days before more animal carcasses were found, and Bram was beside himself with anger and guilt over being unable to save Charlotte, stating that he sat beside her bed with a wooden spear, watching the unsteady rise and fall of her chest.</p><p>On July 22nd Bram stated that he’d managed to create a serum that would allow Charlotte to die peacefully and unturned if Hans made another attempt to get her (there had been four attempts since the 16th) and he injected her with it that same night. Then, sometime around 3am Bram supposed—he and the Auror on watch had fallen asleep—he awoke to discover Charlotte missing. They raised the alarm immediately and went in search; they found her on the morning of July 23rd up on the marshland near Whitby Abbey, her clothes gone and her skin cut in animalistic swipes. There wasn’t much blood, Bram had noted, which indicated that Hans had tried to turn her completely (like Bram had suspected) and she had died peacefully due to the serum he’d created. But then—probably upon discovering Bram’s deceit—Hans had taken his frustration out on the body afterwards—it’s only a small blessing that she was already gone.</p><p>In the nights following Charlotte’s death, the team of Aurors, and Bram, were subjected to numerous attacks and mental torture as Hans tried to foul their minds with depraved illusions: one Auror lost his arm and another his eye.</p><p>It wasn’t until early August before the beast was finally apprehended—and it had taken a team of twelve men, Bram included, to trap and secure him. And, unwilling to take him back to the Ministry cells, they were authorised to dispose of him with the ritual of Strigoi (something else Harry had never heard of.) So, on the morning of August 2nd, they nailed Hans to a wooden plank soaked in Holy Water using silver nails and dragged him up onto the sacred grounds of the Abbey. Then, as the sun rose, they burned him; flakes of ash charring and beginning to upsurge and dance within the sea breeze as Bram’s final word carried across the plane,<em> “Iertare.”</em></p><p> </p><p>†††</p><p> </p><p>   Harry finds himself walking along New Quay Rd, alongside the River Esk. He’s just passed the tourist information point on Langbourne Rd, and the tiny fishing boats lined along the walkway are bumping together and against the concrete barricade, grinding their wooden hulls in a teeth clenching squeak. Their nets and ropes scratching along the boats’ sides as they sway in the water’s current. Across the street is heaving with bodies falling in and out of The Angel Inn pub, a pounding bass emanating over the rumble of shouts and chatter as people move from club to pub to club.</p><p>It's a Friday night, around 10:30 pm, and even with the biting breeze, the harbour is packed. Harry worries that he won’t be able to do what he needs to (it’s not like he can pull his wand out in a crowd full of Muggles) and he can only hope that the old town is quieter, less dense.</p><p>He steals himself to emerge from the shadows he’s subconsciously skulked into, glad that he'd decided to wear the nicer of his civilian clothes: faded Henley’s, plain white shirt and dark leather jacket, nothing fancy.</p><p>He takes a deep breath and exits the shadows, manoeuvres his way towards the wood and tarmac swing bridge, pausing as a group of girls fall into his path. They cling to each other, singing out of tune to Summer Jam, clutch bags and bottles of Smirnoff Ice raised in the air. Harry smiles at them when they turn to apologise in a fit of giggles, giving them a polite nod as he side steps their groping hands. He leaves the drunken group laughing behind him and strolls further around the bay, hands in his pockets.</p><p>The swing bridge is right before him now, and water laps at the thick wooden stoops that anchor the bridge in place. The music over here is less pounding and more acoustic. Harry’s pretty sure that that’s Oasis’ Supersonic belting out from The Golden Lion.</p><p>He glances over at the small pub, sees the bistro style tables and chairs outside filled with patrons jovially singing and catches the lyrics, <em>“I know a girl called Elsa, She's into Alka Seltzer. She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train...”</em></p><p>Harry grins, he knew it. He turns to make his way across the swing bridge, tugging up the collar of his jacket as it’s cooler here with no buildings to help block the wind, when he makes out a familiar figure strolling down St Ann’s Staith, Cuban heels clicking against the paved walkway.</p><p>Blaise Zabini saunters elegantly along the barricade, also adjusting the collar of his Italian made coat. Harry assumes he's come from the back streets where the Magpie Cafe resides on Pier Road and is now ready to investigate the main shopping district just past NatWest Bank. There shouldn’t be any need to intervene, to ask for an update on his progress. They’re only familiarising themselves with the area after all, checking for magical abnormalities, and assumes Zabini will continue on up Baxtergate.</p><p>It’s a surprise when Zabini doesn’t, that he pauses at the end of the walkway and then swiftly enters The Golden Lion; pushing passed a couple in the doorway and appraising the young woman with long, blonde hair as she exits with her partner.</p><p>The air around Harry suddenly feels charged and prickly, causing his skin to break out in goose-pimples and the hairs on his arms to stand up on end, catching on the lining of his jacket. He tells himself he should charge over there and demand to know what the hell Zabini thinks he’s doing. But a glance at his watch shows that it’s after 11 pm now, and that is the time they’re officially off duty.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Harry spins on his heel and stomps angrily away. He doesn’t have the luxury of calling it a night; he’d spent so much time up near the mariner that he’s behind schedule and still needs to analyse the magical flux, if any, in the old town.</p><p>He strolls passed the closed rock and sweet shop and chippie on Bridge street before turning left to go up Church, tripping on a loose cobble. The street is narrow, cobbled and paved, with tall buildings towering over him at each side—some painted and others not—with hanging signs or flower baskets, brass lamps illuminating them.</p><p>Most of the display windows are large and wooden framed, coupled with ornate pillars on either side to distinguish each shop. The doors are all solid wood, too, with knobs instead of handles, no shutters for security, and each has their own bottle glass window—the swirl distorted and discoloured in places.</p><p>A pub on Harry’s right looks dark and deserted, considering the hour, and the old service alley beside it smells of stale ale and urine, ruining the aesthetic of the rest of the street. He moves on, admiring a café with bayed, checkered windows that reminds him heavily of the shops on Diagon Alley, before coming to a slow stop within the town square—under the stone pillars that make up the old town hall. It’s pretty quiet this side of the river, even with it’s few pubs, and the only people he sees are a group of seven that, if Harry’s heard correctly, are on a ghost walk tour.</p><p>Harry watches cautiously from the shadows under the town hall as the tour conductor articulates an elaborate tale of murder and mayhem involving a brothel and a jealous madam who’d fancied the local vicar, the small gathering laughing as he points to an upper window of a shop where the madam was said to have done her business.</p><p>They move on as the tour guide points out an alley where the madam had had the vicar shot and hung up to display what happens when she is displeased, and Harry shivers as he steps out of his hiding place, taking extra care to ensure that he’s alone this time.</p><p>He glances at the alley, wondering if the tale is true as he frees his wand from it's concealed confinement on his thigh. It very well could be if it’s from the 18th century, Harry thinks, checking the area again to see if the coast is clear (he’s not about to break the Statute of Secrecy) and contemplates casting a blood reveal charm that they use at crime scenes; like Luminol, it illuminates traces of blood by reacting with the iron, even when it’s been cleaned away and can’t be seen with the naked eye. That’s stupid though, Harry chastises himself. Even if there had been a crime, after 200 years there wouldn’t be any evidence left now.</p><p>He mentally slaps himself and turns back to the task he’d originally started, casting a whispered <em>Facti Revelio</em>—not at anything in particular, just to the area in general—and observes as the entire square and surrounding buildings become engulfed in a light blue mist. It swirls and contorts until slowly, a bright, electric blue begins to appear along the main walkways and paths, deep black weeping from the centre of it until it is completely engulfed.</p><p>Harry curses under his breath but is unsurprised by the findings that whatever, or whoever, has travelled along these streets has a very dark magical core, one that he doesn’t recognise the signature of. He frowns and ends the spell with another flick of his wand. The mist clears as quickly as it had come and he pulls out a small piece of parchment from his inner pocket, murmuring a brief account of his findings so he can go over them later and make a more substantial report.</p><p>                             <img title="873152E3-92FD-4D0C-832F-5B4C2C39D477.jpeg" src="https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/sugarwiccan/69428188/526/526_600.jpg" alt="873152E3-92FD-4D0C-832F-5B4C2C39D477.jpeg" data-pagespeed-url-hash="828961055" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></p><p>The sound of rolling waves lapping onto shore suddenly attracts Harry’s attention. He knows there’s a beach just beyond the town square he stands in, one you can only get to when the tide is out.</p><p>Curiosity gets the better of him and he advances down a narrow gutter that is covered by a brick arch, stepping over an old grate and avoiding a dripping pipe that has some sort of green plant growing out of it. Almost immediately, he’s hit with a strong gust of wind that knocks him backwards when he comes out the other end. It throws salt and grit into his face, his eyes not even protected by his glasses, and he has to turn away, using all of his will power to not rub at his eyes. He should probably turn back, go back to the hotel and take his potions before bed—they’ll settle him enough for sleep, he’s sure. But as another wave echoes around the bay behind him he suddenly doesn’t want to do anything else, like he’s being drawn towards the sea, and, not for the first time, Harry wonders if there’s a Siren hidden out there in the waters.</p><p>The waves are rhythmic, shallow considering the wind, and sound like, to Harry, the opening to Champagne Supernova, and the thought brings him comfort as he recalls Sirius playing it at Grimmauld Place. It had been so out of character for his godfather who, Harry knew, had grown up with 70s rock: The Clash, Ramones, Black Sabbath. He’s seen Sirius’ record collection and band T-shirts; Harry often wears most of them, his favourite being an early, signed, Sex Pistols shirt.</p><p>Another crash and echo resounds behind Harry and his mind is made up. He fumbles for his wand, casts a hasty shield charm from the wind, and strolls along the paved barricade with purpose.</p><p>Luck is on his side it seems as the tide is receding and the small beach is deserted, nothing but a stretch of pebbled shingle and sand, some minute puddles further out to shore. The waves are frothy and dark, pushing up onto the beach and shoving long pieces of seaweed back and forth as they’re caught on various rocks.</p><p>Harry sits down with a sigh in the rough, shingle sand, stares out into the black void that is night and sea, the arse of his jeans slowly soaking up the left over damp from high tide, his hands stinging with the feel of sand and salt where he absently claws at the sea logged earth. There are no lights along the horizon tonight, no stars scattered across the heavens. No life, no presence, just the sound of rippling waves as they creep ever further away with the tide. It feels peaceful, tranquil, calm. It’s a place where you can come to think, come to be alone where no one can judge you because they’re not there to see you. You could reveal your deepest secrets and let them be taken away by the wind and shore, and no one would be the wiser. You could walk out into the water until it was up to your chest and kick out to swim adrift, keep going until you were caught in the current, and no one would help you because they wouldn’t know, wouldn’t see…</p><p>Harry stares as a rather large wave crawls up the shore and spills into a sunken hole behind a cluster of stones, filling it up in a water whirl of froth, before retreating. He pulls his knees against his chest, boot heels dragging in the sand, and wraps his arms tightly around them as he rocks back and forth slightly. He hadn’t known he was cold, not until he’d felt a treacherous tear drip down his cheek and cause him to shiver, making the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end and goose-pimples to break out so bad he can feel them prickling his skull.</p><p>He looks around, thinks about the journey back to the hotel and how long it would take him. He can't stomach the thought of being in this mood whilst walking all the way back.</p><p>With a quick wipe of his eyes with the back of his hand, Harry stands and stumbles on the uneven ground as his boots sink into the shingle.</p><p>Growing ever more agitated, he rips his wand free in a frantic tug, the leather strap tearing somewhat in his hast. And, not bothering to check whether anyone can see him, he raises it above his head in a shaky grip, his chest beginning to burn now that he’s panting like a poisoned Crup.</p><p>After a muttered incantation, he disappears with a sharp, echoing pop, leaving behind a trail of boot prints.</p><p> </p><p>†††</p><p> </p><p>   Harry tugs at his hair, the knotted mess fisted between both hands as he cradles his head. He’s rocking back and forth before the foot of his bed, the curve of his spine slamming into the divan on every backwards thrust.</p><p>It's been over an hour since he'd drunken his medi-cocktail of potions but the heavy feeling pressing on his chest hasn't lifted.</p><p>He can't breathe, he feels as if can't <em>breathe.</em></p><p>He opens his mouth in a futile attempt to suck in air, gasping like a dying fish, but it hurts his lungs and burns the back of his throat, his mouth feels dry, even as his face feels clammy. Sweat trickles down his temples, down the back of his neck so that his shirt collar becomes stained and damp. He knows that sometimes the potions don’t work the way they’re promised to, and tonight appears to be one of those nights.</p><p>So, as another trail of sweat drips down his back, Harry scrambles pell-mell to his feet and casts frantic, wide eyes around the room, feeling desperate for some sort of outlet.</p><p>Then he remembers—curses himself for his own mindlessness—and hastily throws himself onto the carpeted floor beside his bed, yanking open the bedside cabinet door so it slams against the bed, and drags out his duffle bag.</p><p>How foolish that he’d forgotten he’d packed his black box; it’s something he cherishes more than his whiskey. Another surprise that he’d come across in Sirius’ old room.</p><p>He rummages through the bag, pulling out some rolled up mismatched socks and boxers, nicking his finger on the Buck-Hunter knife that he hasn’t folded away properly, and gingerly lifts out his black box, blood smearing onto the underside thanks to his now cut finger. He sucks the bloody thing into his mouth as he flings his almost empty duffle bag away, not a care in the world as to where it lands, and kicks at the pile of clothes he’s pulled out so that he has some clear space for his box and it’s contents.</p><p>Belatedly, he pulls his finger free and crosses his legs, placing the small black box just before him on the carpet and takes out some white papers and card.</p><p>Using his index and middle fingers he grasps both ends of a paper and folds it into a V before resting the paper on the carpet. He tears and rolls up a small piece of thin card to place at the end, then tentatively sprinkles brown and green herb within the centrefold. Carefully, he picks the full paper back up and lightly licks the side, attempts to roll it so non of the herb falls out and taps it at the end to make sure it’s secure.</p><p>Harry repeats the process three more times before he’s satisfied he’s made enough.</p><p>He replaces the left overs back into his box and hides it back in the bedside cabinet, then pushes himself up to stroll over to the window. There’s something missing though, he realises, and glances at the small plasma Tv sat adjacent to the bed. He grins and uses the remote to switch the Tv on and then to AV—turning the volume up passed 25–before realising he’ll need to cast some sort of silencing charm if he doesn’t want to deal with some rather irate Muggles.</p><p>A wave of his wand around the room and a strong <em>Muffliato</em> later, and he’s charming the Tv to play a home burned CD in his player back at Grimmauld Place; a neat little incantation he’s learned from a book of shadows—as it were—written by The Marauders but modified by Hermione.</p><p>Glorious sound begins to stream through the speakers, crackling at first before the charm stabilises.</p><p>Then the TV settles into playing Track 1 as Harry gradually increases the volume, so much so that the window pane begins to vibrate. But that's good, he thinks, it’ll drown out the already pounding beat in his chest. He’s only satisfied it’s loud enough to wake the dead across the way in St.Mary's graveyard when the high volume starts to hurt his ears.</p><p>
  <em>“You're such an inspiration for the ways, that I will never ever choose to be. Oh, so many ways for me to show you, how your saviour has abandoned you.”</em>
</p><p>Harry shuffles over to the window and slumps down onto the cushioned seat. Rests his exiguous spliffs on the ledge and flings open the creaky window pane with more vigour than he’d intended. It flys open wider than he’d wanted (he’ll probably have to spell it closed later as he won’t be able to reach) but hey-ho, the cold night air is a welcome solace after the stifling heat of the room. He ignites one of the spliffs using the tip of his wand, sucks and inhales with a contented sigh as he leans back against the wide window frame, pulls up a leg so that he's half leant out.</p><p>
  <em>“Your Lord, your Christ, took all you had and—still you pray, never stray, never. Never thought to question why.”</em>
</p><p>Harry’s loved this remix since he’d heard it on a film he’d been to see last week—it had taken him an era to find the track and burn it.</p><p>He does have the original acoustic version somewhere too, but he prefers this one, prefers the bass in it and the raw assiduity of tribulation.</p><p>“It's not like you killed someone. It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side. Praise the one who left you broken down and paralysed. He did it all for you—!” Harry screams, the veins on the side of his neck pulsating and bare, his muscles contorting with the strain. He laughs neurotically to himself, watching the cream swirls that he exhales happily dance in the early morning wind, thunks his head back to blow smoke up towards the sky.</p><p>
  <em>“Oh, so many ways for me to show you, how your dogma has abandoned you. Pray! To your Christ, to your God. Never taste of the fruit. Never stray, never break, never—choke on a lie! Even though he's the one who, did this to you, you never thought to question why.”</em>
</p><p>Harry lights his second smoke, flicking the butt of his first out and onto the street below. He adjusts himself on the seat and shoves himself up, dangles his raised leg out of the window frame so that he’s now straddling the outer ledge. His boot scrapes against the stone face of the hotel.</p><p>
  <em>“It's not like you killed someone. It's not like you drove a spiteful spear into his side. Talk to Jesus Christ as if he knows the reasons why. He did it all for you—!"</em>
</p><p>Wind catches on an superfluous droplet as it slides freely down Harry’s cheek, drying it into a crystalline streak as he lifts his spliff up to chapped lips. The paper around the rolled card sticks to his bottom lip when he pulls the spliff away, so he licks his tongue over it to help ease the way. Dawn is about to break upon the horizon near East cliff; a grey haze splitting the still jet sea from the dark sky over West, and Harry exhales quickly through his nose as he stubs out the end of his second smoke, dabbing it into the grooves of the window and marring a black dot into the white paint.</p><p>He glances briefly over his shoulder, to the shining metal knife just visible on the top of his scattered clothes, before swiftly looking back out of the window; none of that tonight, he thinks. Not when he’s out of the comfort of his own home.</p><p>He rolls the butt of his second spliff between his fingers, then sends it hurtling through the air to land on the green across the street. "Fuck your God!" He roars into the night air, laughing aberrantly whilst he lights up a third.</p><p>
  <em>"Your Lord, your Christ. He did this!"</em>
</p><p>The familiar clench of loneliness creeps up his spine, claws into his stomach and makes him gip as he begins to extemporaneously tremble, and his manic laugh turns into a cry as he bawls, "Took all you had and left you this way! Still, you pray, never stray, never—never taste of the fruit. Never thought to question why!"</p><p>He fists his hair again, the small blunt crumbling in his fingers, but not before it singes his fringe, as a broken sob falls forth. And now he’s shaking with anger, deep, uncontrollable, and yells to the heavens, to the universe in general. "Fuck your God!" His boots kick into the wall, inside and outside, as he sends his middle finger towards the sky, then slumps back in a panting heap, his throat hoarse and his breaths uneven.</p><p>
  <em>“Fuck your God!”</em>
</p><p>Harry lets the damaged spliff fall from his fingers with a slight grimace and an apt curse as a distant, muffled noise has him snapping his attention in the direction of the Whalebone Arch.</p><p>He watches as two figures ascend up the steps, walking arm in arm as they titter and giggle, shouldering each other and stumbling along the inclining path. Harry immediately recognises Zabini as the man on the right, the unmistakable clipping of his Cuban heels and the heavy sway of his Italian coat hard to miss, but Harry can't quite make out Zabini’s companion.</p><p>He swings his leg inside the window—to kneel on the window cushion—and casts a quick Notice-Me-Not charm, sits back on his calves. Lighting up the joint that he didn’t destroy, he watches Zabini grab his partner as they trip over a loose flag stone, watches them both laugh as Zabini props the man up against the lamppost directly across from Harry’s window.</p><p>Harry can now make out a golden-hued, blonde head on the other man. It’s a truly stark contrast when held next to Zabini’s dark chocolate, shorn locks, and Harry’s curiosity is peaked as he wonders who the other man is. He takes a long draw on his blunt while Zabini wedges himself between the blonde’s legs, the other man raising his knee to brace his booted sole on the widest part of the lamppost. His thigh is almost hooked over Zabini’s and a pale, thin arm moves up to drape itself over Zabini’s shoulder. Nothing is said for a moment, it’s just the sound of the subtle wind that resounds and whistles as it rushes passed the window where Harry sits; it’s like the pair are paused in time, two animals suddenly caught in the headlights of an on coming car and unable to move.</p><p>Harry slowly exhales. Then the serene instant is suddenly shattered—Zabini brutally shoves the blonde up against the lamppost, so violently that it causes the light it to flicker with the jostle, and presses himself more firmly against the pliant body beneath him. The blonde doesn’t seem to mind, however, as ivory arms snake around Zabini’s waist in a sedate embrace, and Zabini takes it as incentive to start rolling his hips, his hand moving to pull the blonde’s leg up and around his waist. He keeps his thrusts leisured and staid, a steady rut of hips against hips as he tilts his head and leans in for a kiss. But the other man turns his face away, to rest it in the crook of Zabini's neck and shoulder, and Harry smirks. How unfortunate, he muses, blowing and making a ring with his smoke, watching it disperse and fogging his view. He exhales heavily through his nose. He's still irritated; it’s just so easy for Zabini to charm everyone he meets with his bodacious attitude, taking advantage and attaining all he covets, and Harry can't even work up the effort to talk to most people, never mind seduce them. He can't remember the last time he's fucked anything other than his right hand. It must be at least 8 months, he reflects, maybe more. And isn’t that a just little sad.</p><p>Harry picks up his wand, adjusts the charmed Tv to skip to Track 8 and loses himself in the satiate bass of Joy to the World by Combichrist. He draws in another puff off his joint and lets the smoke escape his open mouth thereafter.</p><p>The cool morning air catches the dull cream swirls and expands them into etiolated clouds. They remind Harry of the mist like swirls he’d seen at King’s Cross Station those few years ago. The thought is oddly assuaging.</p><p>He sighs and adjusts himself on the window seat so he can lean back and unfold his numbed legs, pins and needles hitting almost immediately. <em>Merlin’s balls!</em> Harry clenches his jaw as he endures the prickles that spread up from his feet to his thighs, circulation rushing back.</p><p>Down below, he overhears Zabini groan in recognisable pleasure, and Harry is unable to simply not look, can’t stop himself from leaning over the window ledge to witness Zabini still vehemently frotting against the blonde.</p><p>The flickering lambent of the lamppost has dimmed, casting heavy shadows across both bodies but Harry can still make out the overt show. That is, of course, until the blonde throws his head back in latent bliss and causes the light to dout completely.</p><p>Harry frowns, only a little disappointed, but then a whimper escapes the blonde, high pitched and effusive, and Harry can’t help but lean out more. Moonlight reflects off of the lenses of his glasses and the blonde’s menial whimpers turn into a full blown moan. At that, Harry sits back, can’t help but ponder if the blonde can see him now that his face is tipped back in direct line of Harry’s window. It would be unlikely with the Notice-Me-Not charm but something in the pit of Harry’s stomach is telling him that this, right now, is somehow portentous—yet he can’t explain why.</p><p>His imagination is unfairly running away with itself, expeditiously abusing him with visions of the blonde hooking his leg around Harry’s waist instead of Zabini’s; of pupils blown wide with pleasure and eyelids fluttering as they try to stay focused but losing; of a well kissed, pink mouth, open in a perfect O, panting shamelessly into Harry’s neck as they thrust in unison, both chasing their own completion.</p><p>Harry sighs, grasps his growing cock through his jeans and squeezes the length in a painful grip to stop it’s progress; he won’t be perverted enough as to sit here and wank while Zabini dry humps his latest toy. He savagely bites his bottom lip in an attempt to stay attentive.</p><p>“Oh, <em>fuck</em>—“ Harry hears the blonde moan, and looks down to see the lucent moon over head shining off the blonde’s wide open eyes. He freezes, suddenly entrapped by the shimmering orbs staring back at him, hand still on his cock and heartbeat static in his own ears. He contemplates, once again, if the blonde can actually see him.</p><p>Impossible, he tells himself, relaxing back against the window’s frame and adjusting his cock so that his zip is no longer digging into the side of it.</p><p>But below him, the blonde moans again, a long, drawn out, salacious, <em>“fuck, yes,”</em> that is hissed towards Harry’s window. And now Harry frowns as he hesitates to recast the Notice-Me-Not charm.</p><p>In the end, he simply picks up his forgotten blunt and relights it, saliently licking his lips, running the tip of his tongue over his top lip and then sucking his bottom one in between his teeth. He raises his spliff to his mouth and makes a show of sucking on the end, hollowing his cheeks and exhaling through his nose while he lets his free hand drop back to his crotch. The blonde is now moaning continuously, bounteous little whimpers drifting up for Harry to hear, and he takes them in charily, his gaze unwavering from the blonde’s not visible face as he slips his fingers into the waist band of his jeans. In mere seconds the blonde cries out in sated satisfaction, bowing over to lean against Zabini, who Harry had actually been able to ignore successfully for the last few minutes, and grips the lapels of his coat, alabaster skin stark against the dark wool.</p><p>Harry huffs in illogical disappointment, flicking the butt of his spliff onto the street and rising to stretch his legs and then arms, his shirt riding up his stomach and his spine popping in several places as he glances back out of the window; the coming horizon has the lower sky streaked in vivid reds and lucid purples. Harry pointedly ignores the allure to return to the open window and goes to take a slash before bed, his half hard cock having him wonder just what in Merlin’s name he’s just done.</p>
