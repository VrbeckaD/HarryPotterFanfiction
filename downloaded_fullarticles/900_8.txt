  <em>
    <span>Isn’t it funny where fate leads you?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>For example, if Remus hadn’t missed the bus on that fateful morning, he would have never met Tonks. If he had gotten to work on time, he wouldn’t even know of her existence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Except he </span>
  <em>
    <span>did</span>
  </em>
  <span> miss the bus. Meaning that he did get to meet Tonks. And this simple-yet-complicated event leads to many other important times in Remus’s life. All because he had been running late.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“WAIT!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus stood on the sidewalk and stared in disbelief as the bus sped off without him. Sighing, he checked his phone and found out that the next bus wouldn’t be around for another 20 minutes or so. He phoned the school and explained his situation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus saw a young woman on her knees, quickly gathering her things. Remus bent down to help.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s fine, I can do it myself,” the girl stammered. Remus handed her a thick book, a curiously painted calculator and a phone in a blue rabbit phone case. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus stood up and let the girl stuff the rest of her belongings into her rucksack. He caught a glimpse of a watercolour paint set and a few brushes, he wondered what she did. He helped the girl to her feet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The bus finally arrived, and a small group of people boarded the bus, including Remus and the girl. Remus found a spot to stand at and reached for the handle, not paying attention to where his hand was. His fingers brushed against something warm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus saw the girl again. She had stuffed her hands into her sweater pockets and was blushing profusely. “That’s okay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus pondered about what to say next. “Have we met before?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Minutes ago, at the bus stop?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus had to strain his ears to be able to hear her soft voice. “No, not that. I think I’ve seen you before, at a cafe, I think.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wait for tables at the Burrow in the evenings.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus paused for a while. “Why evenings?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In the mornings, I work at a tattoo parlour.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus was surprised that this girl was so open about her work. “Do you paint or draw in your free time?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The girl looked at him, eyebrows raised. “How do you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus waved his hands, a little frantically. “I inferred, you seem to have a lot of sketchbooks and paints and other art supplies in your bag.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you an English professor?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could say that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The girl smiled, her pink lips curving upwards. Remus didn’t know why he noticed this. “I’m Nymphadora, but you’re better off calling me Tonks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m Remus, pleased to meet you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two shook hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The bus stopped and Remus quickly waved. “Bye, Tonks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bye.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus quickly got off the bus and ran to the school. He pushed open the doors to the office.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus quickly headed to class and greeted his waiting students. While he taught, he found that he had trouble concentrating on his lesson. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was glad when the day was over.</span>
