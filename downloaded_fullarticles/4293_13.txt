<p>James Potter gazed down at the three sleeping infants in his and Lily's arms. "They're beautiful, Lil's," he said as the youngest began to move. Lily nodded, flushed with exhaustion but a proud smile on her face. "They are," she gently touched the second youngest's hand, gasping slightly when he clasped onto her finger.<br/>The two sat holding their babies until one of the nurses bustled in, wand in one hand and several sheets of paper in the onther. "Hello dears, just some finalizations and then everything will be all set," she said as she placed the papers onto a small side table. "What is the eldest's name?" She asked, wand poised above the birth certificate. James cleared his throat, "Michael Sirius Potter." He glanced at the black haired baby on his right with a smile as the nurse hummed. "A fine name. And the middle child's name?"<br/>"Harold James Potter," Lily said, smiling down at the baby in her arms. "And the last one's Charles Remus Potter," she said. The nurse nodded at each one, muttering "A fine name" as she wrote everything down. Finally the nurse turned to the Potter's, handed them the stack of papers, then with a cheery "See you in a bit, dears" she left. Moments later the door opened again and three wizards trampled in. "The nurses said we could come in," Remus Lupin said while Sirius Black talked over him saying, "Which one is mine? They're so tiny!" Peter Pettigrew just shared a look with Lily before saying, "He wanted to come in as Padfoot."<br/>"Kids like dogs, Wormtail," Sirius defended, glaring slightly at the pudgy wizard. James cut in before a fight could start, pointing Sirius in the direction of Lily. "Sirius, will you be Harry's godfather?"<br/>"It would be my honor to uphold the marauder spirit in this tint being," he sad seriously before going over to Lily and Harry. "Pete, Remus, will you two be Michael and Charles' godfathers?" The two men quickly agreed and within an hour Sirius, Remus, James, and Peter were escourted out of the hospital room, the triplets taken to the NYCU, and Lily was left to rest before the next day's visit.</p>

<p>Lily couldn't believe how much her children had grown in such a short time. Michael looked like Lily but with the signature black Potter hair and hazel eyes; he was a very calm baby and very protective of his younger brothers. Harry looked like an almost exact copy of James with his messy black hair and features but he had her startling green eyes; he was also calm and seemed to have a knack for getting into trouble. Charles was the only one to have her red hair and his eyes were a peculiar shade of maybe hazel maybe green; he was the most active and curious of the three.<br/>Currently the three boys were sitting down in the living room with James not getting into trouble.<br/>Lily raised her eyebrow when she saw the three dressed in minture deer costumes to match her currently a deer husband. "When I said get them ready for bed, I didn't mean dress them as yourself," she said, picking up Harry and Charles from the floor and setting them back on the couch with Michael. In a second the deer vanished and James took its place, glasses skewered and a sheepish grin on his face. "But Lily, look how cute they are. And they like Prongs," he added, running a hand through his hair, ruffling it even more. "Even so, they need a bath and then bed." And with that she picked up two of the kids and headed upstairs to the bathroom. She set Charles and Michael on the flolr while she ran water into the tub, not the least bit surprised when James came in a moment later carrying Harry. The bath was uneventful and soon the two had the triplets dried, in pajamas and were about to put them to bed when a soft thud echoed through the hall. The two shared a look before taking out their wands. James handed Harry to Lily and slowly, sliently, crept downstairs. He checked the living room and kitchen, found nothing and then went to the foyer where the front door and dining room were.<br/>He moved along the wall and, with his wand in front of him, turned to the foyer and froze. The front door was cracked open. Without warning red light shot at him, forcing him to duck and turn into the foyer completely to avoid it. "Lily, run!" He called out as he fired off a curse at the intruder. The back and forth dueling went on for only a minute before the intruder cried, "Avada Kedvara," and shot green light at the other wizard. James tried ducking away but was pinned in the cornor, unable to avoid it. Seconds later his lifeless body slumped to the ground and the cloaked intruder headed upstairs.<br/>Lily, hearing nothing from below, grabbed the kids and rushed to their room, dropping her wand in the process. She set them in one bed and pushed the other two in front of the door as she tried figuring a way out. Apperation was out, there was only one fireplace in the house and it was downstairs so floo was out, and her broom was also downstairs. She went to the window and tried lifting it but couldn't and there was nothing near by to break it open with either. Before she could search for something to break the window, the door knob rattled then the cribs began inching away from the door as it opened. Lunging forward until she stood in front of her children, Lily watched in horrified silence as the cloaked intruder entered the room.<br/>"Please not them, not them. Please have mercy... have mercy," she begged the figure as they approached. "Step aside, girl. You don't have to die," the figure said in a smooth, quiet voice. "No, not them," she said, "take me. Take me, instead," she begged. The intruder raised his wand and tried pushing her away but Lily, with a manic shriek, lunged back at him, trying to knock him away from her kids.<br/>With a growl the intruder kicked her away and before she could get up he sent a ball of green light towards her, hitting her in the chest and knocking her back to the floor. Without anymore obsticals in his way, the intruder lifted his wand and once more sent the green light at the children.<br/>It happened so fast, one moment the triplets were covered in the green light and the next it was bounding towards him twice as fast. With a screech the intruder clawed at himself as he burned up, leaving only a pile of smoking cloth, ashes, and a slightly singed wand pointing toward the triplets.<br/>Within minutes a giant of a man came in, sniffling as he looked from the body on the ground to the triplets, sitting up in bed and calling out. He carefully picked each child up, wrapped them in a blanket, then took them downstairs and out into the cool night. He hopped onto the motorcycle he'd gotten from Sirius earlier that night and, placing the children in the side car, started driving until the motorcylce had enough speed to fly.<br/>After a little, bit the giant man landed in a dark neighborhood only to be greeted by a strict looking woman and an elderly man. "Evenin' Professor Mcgonagall, Professor Dumbledore," he rumbled as he stepped off the motorbike.<br/>"Good evening, Hagrid. Did you bring them?" The elderly wizard, Dumbledore, asked kindly. "Yeh, the they fell asleep as we went over Bristol," Hagrid said as he plucked three bundles of blankets from the sidecar. "I can't believe what 'appened to Lily and James. And leavin' their kids so young," Hagrid sniffed. While Mcgonagall comforted Hagrid, Dumbledore took one of the bundles and set it on the doorstep of number 4, Privet Drive. He carefully set a letter with the name Harry Potter next to the baby before bending down to whisper, "Good luck, Harry." Then he straightened up and turned back to the pair.<br/>"Albus," Mcgonagall hissed, "are you really leaving him here, alone, with these people?" Dumbledore sighed wearily. "My dear Professor, this is one of the safest places for him," he explained. Mcgonagall huffed, "And why can't the tree of them be raised together?"<br/>"It will be harder to keep three children, all of whom defeated Voldemort, safe together than it will be apart." Mcgonagall huffed again, "I still don't like this, Albus," she said. Dumbledore nodded, "I agree but it is for the best. We should leave, there's no need to dwaddle. Go, celebrate— today is finally the end of the war," he said. Without anymore protests, Hagrid lumbered back to the motorcycle and Mcgonagall, as a cat, slunk towards an alley before dissappearing around the cornor. Dumbledore glanced between the two Potter boys in his arms and the third one on the doorstep before he turned around and apperated away to deliver the other boys to their new homes.</p>
