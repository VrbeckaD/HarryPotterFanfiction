    <span>Chapter One</span>
  </b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Draco woke up with a mouthful of grass. Spitting it out in disgust, he sat up. Every muscle in his body protested the movement, and his head spun for a worrying moment before the dizziness subsided.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>As he looked around, Draco recognised his surroundings as the grounds of Hogwarts. But that was wrong; Draco had been at Malfoy Manor. The visible presence of grass was wrong, too, because right now it <i>ought</i> to be the middle of winter. And yet the air was warm, and there was no snow or frost in sight. The sky was a beautiful, clear blue which suggested spring.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Draco tried to remember how he’d ended up here. His memory of what had happened last was missing bits, but some fragments of memory were still intelligible. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Ulysses Carrow had dangled a stolen Time Turner for them all to see – someone had tried to curse Carrow – there had been a duel between Carrow and the others, as Draco had tried to shield himself and duck at the same time–</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Every memory after that was too fractured to make sense of. All Draco knew was that something terrible had happened during the fight, something too terrible for him to remember, and then he had woken up at Hogwarts on a warm spring day that ought not to exist.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>There was a noise like the world splitting open, a booming <i>KRAKATHOOM</i> sound, and Draco scrambled around to see what had made it, reaching automatically for a wand that wasn’t there. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>His heart pounding, Draco stared at the figure that had appeared on the grass a few feet away.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>It was Harry Potter, Draco recognised that immediately – but not as Draco knew him.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Whereas the Potter that Draco knew was short and thin, usually with an under-fed look to him that was always at its worst at the beginning of the school year, this Potter looked very different. For one thing, he was an adult, and had obviously been one for some time. Draco put his age at somewhere around twenty-five; perhaps even a little older.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>This Potter was taller, broader, and positively glowed with good health in a way that Potter never had. Potter’s usual sickly start-of-term pallor was nowhere to be seen. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>This Potter was also dressed very differently, wearing old-fashioned battle-robes made of some kind of dark-green hide that had obviously been made with his exact measurements in mind. The sturdy boots he wore were made of the same material. A strap of leather went across one of Potter’s shoulders and down, and the sheath for some kind of long blade hung from where the strap crossed over at Potter’s hip.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>It took Draco a moment to realise that the changes in Potter were more than skin-deep. But this Potter held himself with a relaxed readiness instead of being constantly tense and jumpy like the Potter Draco was familiar with, and his eyes held a glint that was dark and dangerous.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Before Draco could do more than gape at this Potter, horror stealing over him at the <i>wrongness </i>of it all, Potter laughed.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Well, well. Isn’t <i>this</i> interesting?” Still smiling, he took a step towards Draco.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Draoc went scrambling back, his heart in his throat.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Potter stopped where he was. But the dangerous quality to him had vanished, leaving him instead with cheerful expression that wasn’t much more reassuring.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Potter scowled. He brooded. He glared in fury at Draco. He didn’t look <i>cheerful </i>in his presence.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>But Potter didn’t seem to understand that his expression was uncharacteristic.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Relax,” said Potter, and then, “You didn’t intend to travel to an alternate universe, did you? Just checking.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“What?” Draco tried to make sense of Potter’s words, and failed. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Alternate universes,” Potter repeated, like his words might make sense if he said them a second time. “Universes that differ from one’s own.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“<i>What?</i>”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Never mind,” said Potter. “I’ll explain later. But first–” </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>And Potter <i>moved.</i></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Draco tried to dodge, he really did, but Potter’s speed and reflexes had obviously only gotten better with age. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Up you get,” said Potter, hauling Draco to his feet with a firm grip around Draco’s upper arm. Draco thought of trying to break free, but he still feel queasy and disoriented from whatever had happened with the Time Turner. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Besides which, Potter’s grip was like steel, and Draco wasn’t sure he could have escaped it even if he’d tried.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Get off me,” he snapped at Potter, instead.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Sorry, but no.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Then, with another sound like the world was cracking in half, they were somewhere else.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>The two of them were standing in a great stone room that looked like the interior of an ancient castle, and people were turning their heads to stare at the new arrivals, but Draco was busy trying not to gape – because there, sitting at the large table at the front of the room, was someone looked like… <i>him</i>. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Older – by a good ten years or so, and wearing imperial purple, a colour Draco would never have dared to wear in the Dark Lord’s Britain – but still identifiably Draco <i>himself</i>.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Draco’s doppelganger stared at them for a moment. Then–</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“For Heaven’s sake, Merlin!” said the Draco Lookalike, sounding beyond exasperated. Draco did a double-take at the name he’d used. “What have you done <i>now?</i>”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Potter put on an air of exaggerated hurt that even Draco could tell was entirely feigned.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Me, my King?” he asked, and Draco goggled at that, too. “All I did was investigate an incursion into our universe. Perfectly routine, all in the interests of protecting the kingdom. And look what I found!”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Before Draco knew what was happening, he found himself dragged forward towards the Draco Lookalike.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Unhand me!” said Draco, attempting to squirm free. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Potter ignored him, grinning.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Isn’t he interesting? He’s from an alternate universe.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Draco had heard the phrase <i>alternate universe </i>three times now, and he still had no idea what to make of it. He expressed his confusion the best way he knew how.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“What in the Dark Lord’s name is an <i>alternate universe?</i>”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Everyone in the room went still, Potter and Draco’s Lookalike most of all.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“The Dark Lord,” Draco’s Lookalike repeated, with an expression that was frankly scary. Apparently the other occupants of the room agreed with Draco on that, because they began excusing themselves and exiting the room.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Ah, bugger,” said Potter. “That makes sense.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Draco had no clue what was going on, and he probably would have resented that fact if his instincts hadn’t suddenly begun <i>screaming </i>at him that having captured this other Draco’s full attention was a Very Bad Thing. As it was, he stayed very still and tried not to twitch under the gimlet-eyed stare.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Explain,” Draco’s Lookalike snapped out at Potter without removing his gaze from Draco, his voice sharp and authoritative. It was evident that he was just as confused about events as Draco was, and rather angry about it. Draco found that seeing that particular, rather frightening expression <i>on his own face,</i> while being worn by someone else, was deeply unnerving.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Well,” said Potter. “First you have to understand, there is more than one universe.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <i>
    <span>What kind of bollocks is this?</span>
  </i>
  <span> Draco thought. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>But his Lookalike only fixed Potter with an intent, angry look and said, “Go on.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Potter gave a tiny bow, a smile playing about his lips, and began to explain.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“There are, in fact, an infinite number of universes. Each one only slightly different from the one next to it. But if you take one universe from the beginning of the sequence, and compare it to one from the other end, the differences between them are, well, innumerable.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“So, the boy. He’s… me? From another universe?” </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Deep down, somewhere at the back of his mind, Draco was offended at being called <i>the boy</i>. But the rest of him was too busy being afraid.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>At least his Lookalike’s attention was all on Potter. Who was nodding.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Only three or four universes along from ours, I would say – but with some very important differences.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“The Dark Lord,” said Draco’s Lookalike, with a disdainful curl of the lips. While Draco was boggling at that reaction – torn between fascination and horror – Harry gave a nod.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Exactly. Something happened in this Draco’s universe, which allowed his rise to power – or alternatively, <i>didn’t</i> happen.” </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Potter’s gaze suddenly switched to Draco, who shrank back under the intensity of that stare. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“You. Young Draco. When did your Dark Lord return to a body?”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“At the end of my fourth year,” Draco said, feeling shaken and off-balance, and beginning to panic as the import of Potter’s words began sank in. “He used Potter for some sort of ritual, I heard.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>It only occurred to Draco a moment later that he could have refused to answer the question – that indeed, to do so would have been wiser.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>But other worlds? Other versions of <i>him? </i>A world where, if Draco’s suspicions were correct, the Dark Lord <i>wasn’t</i> in power? It seemed unthinkable – and yet… </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“<i>Ha</i>,” said Potter, as though Draco’s words confirmed something. “See what I mean?”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Draco had been acquainted this Potter all of five minutes, and already thought he was insufferable. He wondered how Lookalike put up with him.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>But Lookalike had other concerns.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“You didn’t destroy Voldemort’s anchors in his world, did you?” Lookalike’s eyes fixed on Potter, paying no attention to Draco’s reflexive flinch at hearing the Dark Lord’s name spoken aloud. “But why not? You’re <i>Merlin</i>.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <i>
    <span>He’s what? </span>
  </i>
  <span>Draco thought. Surely Lookalike didn’t mean that the way it sounded.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Yes, but the Harry Potter from this Draco’s world isn’t,” Potter answered Lookalike. “I’m singular. I have to be, because of my heritage. Demons exist outside of the universes, and so there is only one of them across all the worlds. They don’t have iterations. And any child of sufficient power doesn’t, either.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <i>
    <span>Demons?</span>
  </i>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Lookalike furrowed his brow at that, like he was trying to get his head around the idea. He didn’t seem concerned at all by the fact that Potter had <i>just admitted to demonic heritage</i> in front of him. Instead he asked,</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“So you – Merlin – never existed in this Draco’s universe?”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“I did, because other universes, including the one we’re currently in, branched off from the original universe that our past selves were born into,” said Potter. “Think of the universes as like leaves on a tree: some of them come from common branches.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>While Draco tried desperately to make anything that he was hearing <i>make sense</i>, Lookalike’s mouth pursed.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“So this version of me, he’s from a universe that branched off our original universe?”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Just <i>yes</i>. As though this wasn’t some guess Potter had made by extrapolating from an abstract theory, but something he knew to be factually true.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>The grass was green, the sky was blue, and Potter could make factual pronouncements about the nature of the fabric of reality.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Draco felt a sense of dread crawl up his spine, and shivered. He dearly wished that Potter would let go of his arm.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Lookalike rubbed at one temple, as though trying to get his head around the concepts Potter had explained was giving him a headache. Draco sympathised, somewhere under his sense of impending doom.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“So what do we do with him?”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Potter gave Lookalike a grin.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“What, with a version of you who’s a Death Eater unwillingly Marked, yet potentially still holds blood-supremacist views?”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Draco’s heart pounded in sudden terror at the <i>unwillingly Marked </i>bit. <i>No one </i>should have been able to guess that! Draco’s very <i>life </i>and that of his parents depended on it!</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>But Potter went on talking as though Draco hadn’t just frozen in his grasp in fear, still grinning widely.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Good question, my King. Why don’t we ask him?”</span>
</p>
