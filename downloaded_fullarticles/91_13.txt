    <p>The night is cold. Beneath the sparkling blanket of stars which drapes itself across the sky, the air is frigid, and though the wind is nigh on still, the chill seeps into the bones of the many souls on the streets. For most, it is ignored in favour of celebration, a mere afterthought in comparison to their joy and merrymaking. For one, however, the cold is a deadly weapon, stealing all too quickly through tiny limbs and slowing blood to a sluggish trickle.</p>
<p>It is a bad night to leave little Harry James Potter, only one year of age, out on the streets.</p>
<p>By the time Petunia Dursley opens the door, the boy is sickly, cold to the touch and white as the blankets he’s been swaddled in. Confused and suspicious, she peers down at the small infant for a moment, wondering with a faint touch of horror if the poor child might be dead, but then she sees the faint rise of a ribcage and springs into action, snatching the baby up and reaching for the phone. Only the emergency services, she thinks, can save this child.</p>
<p>As she fills in the operator on the situation – “I – I don’t know; he was just left here, and he’s so <em>cold</em>…” – she goes to wake her husband, shaking him insistently until he blinks blearily up at her then gesturing frantically to the infant in her arms and the phone. After listening to the phone call for a matter of minutes, Vernon Dursley’s bushy eyebrows rise in incredulous horror, then he’s swinging his feet around onto the floor and reaching for his dressing gown, hurrying downstairs to see if there’s any explanation for the child’s mysterious appearance.</p>
<p>All that’s left is a single side of oddly thick parchment, which he gapes at in silence even before bothering to read it. The act of reading itself certainly doesn’t give him a higher opinion on the situation; those freaks left <em>his nephew</em> on a doorstep in late October, mere hours after the deaths of his parents, for God’s sake! The poor child’s nearly dead – which this Albus Dumbledore fellow surely couldn’t have intended, given that the letter begs them to raise the boy.</p>
<p>Shaking his head, he takes the letter but remains in the doorway to wave down the approaching ambulance, sticking his head back into the house to call for his wife then stepping out of the way of the paramedics.</p>
<p>“We’ll follow behind,” he tells the paramedics firmly while little Harry is tended to, handing the note to Petunia to read. “I found a letter which was left with him – apparently he’s our nephew.”</p>
<p>“Lily’s <em>dead</em>?” Petunia whispers, horror and grief in her tone, then her face twists with anger. “Lily’s dead, and they left <em>her son</em> to die of cold on a doorstep!”</p>
<p>The anger crumbles into grief once more as she collapses into Vernon’s chest to sob; Vernon lifts one arm to rub up and down her back in gentle comfort, the other lifting to wave in confirmation that they’ll follow to the hospital in a few minutes.</p>
<p>“I never got to – to tell her I – I –” Petunia stutters out, but apparently can’t get any further before the sobs take over once more.</p>
<p>“She knew,” Vernon assures her softly. “She knew, Pet. And she loved you too.”</p>
<p>He doesn’t attempt to tell her that it’s alright; her sister and brother-in-law have died, and she’s been given the news in the form of a callous, pretentious letter.</p>
<p>“We’ll just have to raise little Harry as best we can,” he murmurs after a good five minutes of tears. “Come on, we’ll wake Dudley then head to the hospital – once that’s sorted, I’ll make sure you have your time to mourn, alright? But for now, we have to keep moving.”</p>
<p>Shakily, she peels herself away from him, lifting trembling fingers to wipe daintily beneath her eyes, then sucks in a quivering breath and turns for the stairs.</p>
<p>“I – I’ll get Dud,” she tells him, then sniffs. “You g – get dressed.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As luck would have it, Harry is fine; he will, they’re told, have a weaker immune system for some time, but there’s no permanent damage been done. On hearing the news, Petunia slumps in relief, Vernon holding her steady by the arm around her shoulder. They can take their nephew home tomorrow, but if there do look to be any other problems after that point, then they should call in at once and explain the situation.</p>
<p>While Harry stays in hospital, Vernon arranges the spare bedroom and shops for the necessary extra supplies they’ll need, keeping his son entertained while his wife mourns the loss of her last remaining family. It’s in doing so that he starts to realise how terribly unfit he is; walking up and down the stairs just once leaves him out of breath, never mind multiple times, and with a baby in tow at that.</p>
<p>He will, he decides, have to go on a diet – and looking at Dudley, he’ll have to be careful about what his son eats, too. Vernon has never had a brilliant relationship with food, and he doesn’t want to pass that on to Dudley if he can help it, so it’s probably time he started looking into healthy eating patterns – see if he can get Petunia to eat a little more while he’s at it, even.</p>
<p>Over the next eight years, Vernon gradually gets himself down to a manageable size, discovering that he quite enjoys his weekly gym trips and the rugby he’s recently started playing for the first time since his school years – enough that, when Harry and Dudley are old enough, he brings them along and lets them endear themselves with his teammates and eventually join the minis. Petunia appreciates the small break it gives her at the weekends and one other evening a week to relax and eventually start up a cleaning column in the local newspaper, more for her own enjoyment than from any commercial benefit; when it starts to gain popularity, she’s shocked but pleased, and certainly honoured to accept a position with a much larger paper, writing for them every week.</p>
<p>Harry and Dudley grow up happy and healthy, as thick as thieves and more. The pranks that they play together are never malicious, and on the odd occasion someone does get upset, Petunia and Vernon teach them to apologise at once and make sure that their ‘victim’ is alright. Every time, such behaviour earns them a new friend in the form of the kid whom they’ve just picked off the ground or helped to clean up.</p>
<p>So really, life is going well for their small family of four. Harry’s accidental magic is treated with fond eye-rolls and just the slightest hint of caution – after some early freak-outs before they realised what was going on – and Dudley <em>loves</em> it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s two days after Dudley’s ninth birthday that their world is flipped on its head once more, in the form of a brilliant flash of light in their backyard, flaring out to fill the enclosed space before shrinking back in, the brightness concentrating at a single point of such intensity that they all have to look away, Petunia pausing in her writing and Vernon drawing Dudley and Harry towards him, rugby ball forgotten for the time being, to shield them. When the light fades, Vernon remains in place, holding the two boys away from whatever the source might be in case it remains dangerous.</p>
<p>“Did either of you do this?” he asks, and both shake their heads, eyes wide with shock. “Alright, I –”</p>
<p>“Vernon!” Petunia calls, rising from her lawn chair as Vernon twists towards her and pointing with one trembling finger towards the origin of the light.</p>
<p>There, limp and unmoving on the grass, lies an unfamiliar man.</p>
<p>“Pet, take the boys inside,” Vernon tells her without hesitation, because priority number one is that they remain safe themselves, and who knows who – or what – this man is. “I’ll see what’s going on.”</p>
<p>Gently, he nudges Harry and Dudley in her direction and watches them closely as they run to her, waiting until all three are safely inside before approaching the newcomer, who now appears to be shifting weakly as his eyelids flutter. At least he doesn’t look like much of a threat.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Vernon demands, unable to feel bad about the rude tone he takes, when this man has appeared in his back garden where his boys were playing and his wife writing.</p>
<p>The man groans softly, blinking and shaking his head as if to clear it, before dazed eyes fix on Vernon’s; Vernon finds himself struck by the thought that this man’s eyes are exactly the same shade as Harry’s.</p>
<p>“Salazar,” comes the hoarse croak in reply, followed by a cracked laugh which evolves swiftly into a seemingly painful coughing fit which leaves this ‘Salazar’ clutching at his ribs and groaning. “Salazar Potter, Salazar Slytherin, take your pick – it doesn’t matter. It won’t last.”</p>
<p>Then, to Vernon’s confusion and faint discomfort, the strange man’s chest stutters with a dry sob, though Salazar bottles it in before it can become anything more. More pressing, though, is that Vernon’s almost certain that this man is a wizard, and he said ‘Potter’, which <em>could</em> be a common name in the magical community, but Vernon suspects otherwise.</p>
<p>“Potter?” he demands, Salazar blinking up at him before nodding shakily. “As in… James Potter?”</p>
<p>“James?” Salazar repeats at once, attempting to push up onto shaking arms before the limbs give way to leave him slumped on the grass once more. “You know James? Where is he? I need to – I need –”</p>
<p>Taken aback, Vernon can only blink for several seconds, struggling to find anything to say. Either this man is too dazed to remember – concussion is probable, to be fair – or he simply doesn’t know that James Potter is dead. Vernon’s not sure which will be a harder situation to deal with.</p>
<p>“How do you know James?” he settles for asking, then meets the eyes which narrow at him.</p>
<p>“I’m his brother,” Salazar tells him warily. “I had an… accident – I haven’t seen him in many years.”</p>
<p>In the back of Vernon’s mind, a bell rings faintly. He remembers Petunia mentioning a brother, once – a twin who had disappeared in a freak magical accident at the age of fifteen, whom no one spoke of and whom the Potters had never given up on looking for.</p>
<p>“Why are you here <em>now</em>, then?” Vernon presses, suspicion hardening his tone.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Salazar tells him with a helpless shrug. “I don’t – I ended up… elsewhere, and I thought I was stuck there. I made a new life there, and then – then it was <em>torn </em>from me just like – just like –”</p>
<p>Another ‘freak magical accident’? Is that what this stranger is implying? Vernon doesn’t know whether such a thing is plausible or not, but he accepts it with a nod.</p>
<p>“And how do I know you’re telling the truth?” he asks pointedly.</p>
<p>Salazar sighs, head dropping back against the soft lawn beneath himself.</p>
<p>“Gringotts?” he offers. “We can go there and ask the goblins.”</p>
<p>Before Vernon even attempts to work out if this ‘Gringotts’ is a real place, never mind if goblins exist and can confirm this man’s identity, he decides that he should <em>really</em> talk to Petunia and see what she knows.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With Petunia having declared Salazar’s similarity to the pictures Lily once showed her, they head for Gringotts – Harry and Dudley in tow, because they’ll have to get a glimpse of the magical world at some point, and why not now? Vernon is all about giving both of his boys some real-world experience from a young age, so that they’ll be able to stand on their own two feet when they need it. A trip to a magical bank sounds very much like something they could benefit from.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, knowing that the bank – alongside the street it can be found on – is magical-community only does not prepare him for the sights, sounds and smells that he’s met with on stepping through a moving brick wall at the back of a <em>pub</em> of all places. Colours dance around him, mixing with bright flashes of light and the shrieking of children, owls and God knows what else, the air thick with the aroma of fresh bread, chocolate, mint, <em>blood</em> – Jesus Christ, is that a <em>vampire</em>? – and so much more that Vernon doesn’t think he wants to even attempt to identify. Salazar leads them through the commotion without batting an eyelid, Vernon holding his composure together for the sake of Harry and Dudley, the former clinging to his hand and the latter to Petunia’s, both gaping around at the spectacle in much the same way as Vernon desperately wants to.</p>
<p>“Here,” Salazar announces finally, twisting briefly as if to check that he hasn’t lost one of them in the bustle then looking back up at the looming marble structure before them. “Merlin, it’s been a while…”</p>
<p>Only briefly does Vernon catch a glimpse of some sort of inscription on the door before Salazar ushers them inside and makes for the nearest goblin – <em>goblin</em>, Vernon’s mind shrieks frantically – to stop in front of its towering desk and meet its sneering gaze. All Vernon can do is try not to stare.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Master Goblin,” Salazar greets, inclining his head in a shallow bow, and Vernon thinks he sees the goblin’s expression soften just a fraction. “I would like to access my vault, and prove my identity to my companions as well.”</p>
<p>The goblin’s chin lifts in the slightest of acknowledgements.</p>
<p>“Name?” it asks flatly.</p>
<p>“Potter,” Salazar replies, apparently unfazed by its unfriendliness, which in turn falters a little at the name, the goblin apparently surprised. “Salazar Potter.”</p>
<p>The goblin pauses in its other activities – sorting gemstones – for the first time, then, and peers down at Salazar in silence for a long moment.</p>
<p>“Gornuk!” it calls, then sits back as another goblin arrives, gesturing to its companion. “Gornuk will attend to your business. Gornuk, this is Salazar Potter, who wishes to prove his identity and visit his vaults, and his companions.”</p>
<p>Vernon is surprised to find ‘Gornuk’ much friendlier than the last goblin, ushering them away to a much smaller room with a small incline of the head and staying only for a moment to converse with the original goblin before following them in. Really, he should have known better than to assume that just because the first goblin he met was curt then the rest would be too.</p>
<p>“Mr Potter, it is good to see you alive and well after so many years,” Gornuk begins as soon as the door is closed, waving them all to seats (Vernon doesn’t know whether or not to be surprised that the seats are of exactly the right number, and a perfect size for each of them). “Before we go ahead with your business, I feel it prudent to ask you a few questions to establish the situation and avoid misunderstandings. How aware have you been of everything that has happened since your disappearance?”</p>
<p>At that, Salazar looks away, deflating outright for the first time since it was agreed that they would go to Gringotts in the first place.</p>
<p>“I have no idea of anything that has happened,” he admits slowly. “I have been… Well, it’d be nice to find out what year it is, to start.”</p>
<p>To Vernon’s surprise – he’s getting a little tired of constantly being caught off-guard – Gornuk stiffens.</p>
<p>“Is this a time-travel incident?” the goblin asks carefully, eyes closing for a second when Salazar nods.</p>
<p><em>Time travel</em>? Vernon hadn’t even thought that possible – though he’s starting to think that maybe he should take an approach of assuming everything possible until proven otherwise.</p>
<p>“Time travel?” Harry whispers at his side, eyes wide, and Vernon shushes him fondly, trying not to laugh at the boy’s pout.</p>
<p>“It has been…” Salazar appears to count it through, “Around fourteen years, I would guess. It was… hard to keep track.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Gornuk nods. “We can verify that for you as well. Fourteen years have certainly passed in our time – to the day, I would add. And you do not know anything that has happened in that time?”</p>
<p>Blankly, Salazar shakes his head.</p>
<p>“We don’t appear to be at war anymore?” he offers hesitantly.</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Gornuk repeats, then frowns. “The sooner you know, the better, I suppose. Your parents are, unfortunately, dead, as is your brother and his wife. Killed by You-Know-Who on the same day that he tried and failed to kill your nephew, Harry.”</p>
<p>It’s… a blunt way of putting it, and certainly not the way Vernon would have done it; he would have found some chocolate, built a rapport, and broken it slowly and gently, feeding it in chunks that the receiver could handle. This is a quicker way of doing it, though, and perhaps that is, in some respects, more merciful. Carefully, he reaches out to squeeze Petunia’s hand when he hears her sniff, to be rewarded with a shakily grateful smile.</p>
<p> “<em>What</em>?” Salazar whispers, face white as a sheet, and for a moment, he seems about to crumble under the weight of it all; Vernon can only imagine what a blow this must be – assuming, of course, that he is who he says he is.</p>
<p>The next second, however, any hint of emotion is gone, locked away from sight and seemingly existence as blankness falls over the man’s face.</p>
<p>“Probably for the best,” he announces to the room at large, his voice dropping in volume a moment later. “At least I won’t lose them again.”</p>
<p>Gornuk watches him in silence, apparently as aware of the sombre atmosphere as the rest of them, then nods in acceptance.</p>
<p>“Have there only been the two time-travel occurrences?” the goblin asks, making a note on parchment with a quill – a <em>quill</em> – when Salazar nods. “Fourteen years apart. Hmm…”</p>
<p>Vernon shares a weighted look with Petunia, glad that Harry and Dudley seem aware that now is not the time to get restless or complain of boredom.</p>
<p>“I built a new life,” Salazar mutters, staring fixedly at the desk which separates humans from goblin. “I had friends, family, a reputation… And then it was torn away from me. Again. I suppose I’ll end up there again in another fourteen years and find Godric killed by Vikings.”</p>
<p>The words are bitter, and they mean little to Vernon, but Gornuk’s eyebrows rise with interest.</p>
<p>“Godric killed by Vikings?” the goblin repeats, spindly fingers caressing its chin as it eyes Salazar in silence. “Around when did you spend your last fourteen years, Mr Potter?”</p>
<p>Salazar takes in a deep breath, something about the glint in Gornuk’s eyes and the tension in Salazar’s shoulders telling Vernon that, whatever is about to come out, it will have serious significance.</p>
<p>“Around the 10<sup>th</sup> Century,” Salazar admits. “I… was given a different surname, by the friends I met. We decided to build a school together.”</p>
<p>“And that surname was…?” Gornuk presses, and Vernon can also imagine that, if it had less decorum, it would be salivating at whatever prospect it can see.</p>
<p>“Slytherin,” Salazar sighs, folding his arms. “Salazar Slytherin.”</p>
<p>“Lord Slytherin,” Gornuk all but purrs. “It is an <em>honour</em>.”</p>
<p>For the next hour or so, Vernon sits and tries to keep Harry entertained as quietly as possible while keeping an eye on proceedings between Salazar – who has indeed confirmed his identity, and in doing so, his apparent status as ‘Lord Potter’ – and Gornuk – who Salazar explained was female while the goblin was out of the room, not that Vernon has any idea how Salazar knows that. At any rate, the two have settled into quite a comfortable, efficient conversation on accounts and affairs, Vernon unable to keep track of much given both the clear differences in the magical system and his own preoccupation with a slightly grouchy Harry. Apparently, it is a very big deal that Salazar has no heirs and will never be able to have them; Vernon isn’t sure whether he’s surprised or not that the man survived being a homosexual <em>with a male partner</em> in the 10<sup>th</sup> Century, but he decides not to question it too closely, more interested in Salazar’s outrage that the man who killed James and Lily has been claiming to be the ‘Heir of Slytherin’, whatever that means. (And admittedly, he’s rather uncomfortable with the idea that his nephew might be related to a homosexual, but he can work out what to do about that at another time.)</p>
<p>Then, apparently, there’s the disrepair that the Slytherin estate has fallen into, Salazar despairing that all of his hard work has been mistreated to such an extent. After that, there’s the ownership of Hogwarts, which Vernon very easily recognises as the name of the magical school which James and Lily both attended, and which Harry will likely attend in future, and the ‘dissatisfying’ alterations which the current headmaster has supposedly made. The political side of it all – the ‘Wizengamot’, the seats, the ‘Light’ and ‘Dark’ and ‘Grey’ – make no sense at all, and Vernon does not even attempt to follow it. Politics have never been his strong point, and certainly, magical politics make no more sense than the normal kind.</p>
<p>Finally, when Harry is grumbling and fiddling with the zip on his hoodie as Dudley pokes the leg of his chair moodily with one toe, they move onto the Potter estate. Honestly, Vernon’s not sure why they’re even still here, but it soon becomes apparent that their presence is indeed necessary for this part of the conversation.</p>
<p>“Vernon and Petunia Dursley currently have guardianship of your nephew,” Gornuk tells Salazar, peering down at her documents. “Petunia Dursley is the sister of Lily Potter, who was in turn your sister-in-law.”</p>
<p>“That’s us,” Petunia offers quietly, and Gornuk looks up, Salazar twisting to blink at them in apparent surprise. “I’m Petunia. This is Vernon, our son Dudley… and our nephew, Harry.”</p>
<p>Harry jumps at his name, glancing around at them all with clear confusion, and Vernon pats his shoulder lightly in reassurance, watching emotions flit over Salazar’s face too quickly to be registered.</p>
<p>“He has the eyes,” comes the quiet observation finally. “James must have been so p – annoyed that he got the Potter eyes.”</p>
<p>So the green is a Potter trait? Vernon had always assumed that it came from Lily – though he won’t deny that Lily’s eyes were never <em>quite</em> so bright as Harry’s.</p>
<p>For several long seconds, Salazar remains transfixed, then with a deep breath, he returns his gaze to Gornuk.</p>
<p>“And who had control of his inheritance? The estate? His seats? Those would have passed to him when he came of age, would they not?”</p>
<p>Gornuk sifts through documents until she finds the ones she apparently wants, frowning visibly at whatever she sees.</p>
<p>“Albus Dumbledore appears to have taken control of everything for himself,” she announces, and then her frown deepens. “He has spent more than he should have been permitted. <em>Far</em> more. And these suggest that he has active use of the seats, but that should not…”</p>
<p>“I want that sorted,” Salazar announces, Gornuk nodding immediately in agreement. “<em>Albus Dumbledore</em> should not have a single <em>hair</em> in my nephew’s inheritance, never mind the family estate or seats. Anything he has taken, I want returned. I want my brother’s will reviewed, and –”</p>
<p>“It was never opened,” Gornuk observes, almost more to herself than Salazar, who stops talking instantly with a sharp inhale. “It was sealed. Both the previous Lord and Lady Potter’s wills were sealed.”</p>
<p>By the flaring of Salazar’s nostrils, Vernon can only assume that such news is bad. It’s good, he thinks, that Salazar seems so intent on protecting Harry already, though he vows internally to keep an eye out and ensure that the man bears no ill will towards their nephew. If all is well, then it will be good for Harry to grow up with one foot in the magical world already, prepared for what he will be diving into.</p>
<p>“Who by?” Salazar demands. “If it was –”</p>
<p>“Albus Dumbledore,” Gornuk grits out, seemingly as furious as Salazar himself. “We will have this rectified, Lord Slytherin. You understand that the title of Lord Potter will pass to your nephew when he comes of age.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes,” Salazar waves it off, clearly agitated. “That’s fine. That’s good. It should be his. It would never have been mine if James –”</p>
<p>He stops, inhales sharply, and continues.</p>
<p>“I’ll simply have to do what I can to repair whatever damage cannot be reversed until that time – and I don’t suppose <em>anyone</em> has offered him education on his role, his future…? I’m seeing too many blank faces in this room to believe that he has been given the support he needs, never mind the family.”</p>
<p>Gornuk peers down at her documents.</p>
<p>“According to these,” she sighs, “Those duties would have fallen to Albus Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>“Of <em>fuh… udging</em> course,” Salazar grits out, a quick glance in the direction of Harry and Dudley preceding his hasty switch away from outright cursing. “Right. Fine. I’ll do that. Perhaps it would be best to leave the rest until another day, when the problems already identified have been rectified.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Gornuk agrees, standing. “If you would prefer, I can have the current account manager removed under investigation and assign someone else?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Salazar confirms, nodding as he, too, rises, and Vernon takes that as a sign to finally push up and out of his chair to stretch his legs with a quiet groan of relief. “I’d like to request that you take over for the time being, if that’s possible.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Gornuk assures, inclining her head. “We will arrange a secondary appointment for next week, Lord Slytherin, though of course we will make contact sooner if necessary.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Somewhat confused about what has happened but very much aware that he should be angry, Vernon offers a polite smile and nod to Gornuk and follows Salazar from the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Salazar waits until they arrive back at the home of Vernon and Petunia to sit down with his… Well, he’s not entirely sure what the apt term would be, but his nephew’s aunt and uncle, at any rate. Internally, he can only be grateful that, despite their appalling lack of support from the magical community, they have managed to raise Harry as a healthy, happy boy with good levels of accidental magic and a sensible head on him – or so it appears, after spending but a matter of hours with them.</p>
<p>Further down, deep inside his heart, something aches for his losses, which seem to be stacking up faster than he wants to count – Helga, Rowena, Helena, <em>Godric</em>, Mum, Dad, <em>James</em> and the sister-in-law he never knew – but he will deal with that later, once he has everything else sorted. Really, he has no idea how long he’ll be here, no way of knowing when next he’ll be whisked away – the image of Godric’s face, contorted with grief and misery as they both fought against the magic which tore them apart, will sear Salazar’s mind for years to come – but all he can is make the most of what time he does have, and do his best by the people he’ll leave behind, namely, his young nephew, whom he has yet to properly introduce himself to.</p>
<p>“We have much to discuss,” he tells Vernon and Petunia when they’re all sat, mugs of tea clasped in white-knuckled hands; the couple facing him seem to know that something is very, horribly wrong.</p>
<p>“Could you start from the beginning?” Petunia – his sister-in-law’s sister, or his brother’s sister-in-law – asks softly. “From what happened to you originally? I don’t remember Lily ever writing about you, and she wrote about everyone she met at Hogwarts – even the ones she didn’t like.”</p>
<p>Salazar has to snort wryly at that, even as he realises that this ‘Lily’ could well be the same as the poor girl James had been moping after since the age of eleven. Perhaps, it would be best to explain it all, as requested.</p>
<p>“I was home-schooled,” he starts slowly. “I have a… condition, where my magic is… Well, it’s harder to control. No one could explain it, no one could treat it, and although Hogwarts has accepted students like me in the past and helped a great deal, the headmaster of the time, Albus Dumbledore, decided to refuse me entry. My parents did not want to argue, because he had – and apparently still has – a lot of power in this country. Never mind that he was happy to admit a werewolf…”</p>
<p>Shaking his head, he moves on. Remus Lupin was very much a decent boy, he remembers, and a good friend of James’. He doesn’t begrudge the other anything, and certainly, he hopes that Remus is alright, wherever he has ended up.</p>
<p>“At any rate, I had a slightly unusual education as a result, because I was not permitted a wand – Dumbledore, again – so could not learn magic in the usual way. I learnt politics, economics, and the like, and whatever magic my parents could teach me without a wand, to the point of teaching me the same magic but without a wand to use as a conduit. It was… harder, but it helped me strengthen my magical ability a lot. Unfortunately…”</p>
<p>Looking away from their watchful eyes, he coughs to clear his throat as his voice scratches roughly.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, strength was the last thing I needed – I believe the problem was that my magic was <em>too </em>strong to be easily controlled. I needed the control that learning to channel through a wand would teach me, and instead, my parents were forced to do whatever else they could for me, which just happened to worsen my condition – not that they knew. The time-travel was… It was one of those accidents, when I simply could not control what I was doing. Where – or when, I should say – I ended up, I met people who helped me to understand my condition and how to cope with it. I created a wand, and that seemed to help. The accidents went away, and I made a life for myself. We built a school, and I had my friends and family… and then the accidents started again. We tried to work out what was wrong, and we were…”</p>
<p>He clenches a hand tightly into a fist, digging the nails into his palm and biting down briefly on the inside of his cheek in an attempt to stop the tears that threaten to fall. Even having glossed over as much of his life as he can, to avoid the pain of thinking about everything that he has only just lost, it all seems overwhelming, his heart aching with Godric’s absence.</p>
<p>“We were close,” he croaks out. “Very close. But too late.”</p>
<p>At least, he thinks they were close; they just weren’t certain if they were right, and Rowena had some last tests to do before they could put everything that they were fairly certain of into practice. Perhaps the tests would have failed, perhaps they were on completely the wrong track, but Salazar is utterly convinced that they were right. All of his notes on the subject are gone, though – lost alongside his family and his home.</p>
<p>“I woke up,” he continues, realising that he doesn’t have the air to complete the sentence and quickly drawing in a breath, “In your garden. This morning. To find that my first family – those I knew, at any rate – are all dead, killed by a man whom we were still fighting when the first accident occurred. The man who denied me a chance to control my magic has seized my family’s estate and sought to control my nephew’s life in the most horrific of manners, I can only assume, and I do not know how long I will be here – how much time I have – but I will do what I can to help Harry. Which starts, really, with telling you everything I know about the situation.”</p>
<p>Taking a moment to compose himself now that there is nothing more to recount to them, he licks his lips and readies himself to explain what Albus Dumbledore has done. Then, he will need to know everything that they can tell him.</p>
<p>“Before I returned,” he starts carefully, well aware that he is the full focus of their rapt attention, “The situation was a little different, so we’ll go into that first. Harry was the Heir of House Potter, which meant that, when he came of age, he would take on the title of Lord Potter. He would have ownership of our family’s estate, and would carry the full political power of the Potter Family. He has seats in the Wizengamot, which is the… council of Magical Britain, you might say. The Wizengamot is responsible for governing our community – for creating laws, and for maintaining them. The parliamentary and justice systems, all rolled into one. Harry will have considerable influence once he is old enough to take on the seats for himself.”</p>
<p>He pauses, just for a moment, to ensure that they are following him, and is satisfied with the nod he gets from Petunia; as long as one of them understands, then that will do them for now.</p>
<p>“When there is no one around to take on such duties for a House – to hold the mantle of Lord, or in a family which is not noble, that of Head – then normally, the estate is maintained passively by Gringotts, with no active development or political movements taking place until the Heir comes of age. If the entire family dies out… There are normally wills which will direct what happens, or Gringotts and the Ministry will do as they see fit. Wills can also be used if there is an underage Heir, and likely, James and…” he struggles briefly for his sister-in-law’s name, “Lily will have stipulated their wishes accordingly. However, their wills were sealed and never read, and instead Albus Dumbledore took responsibility for Harry and for control of the House without anyone’s permission. It is not really a legal move, but I imagine no one dared to challenge him, if they even thought to do so. However, it can be easily challenged by Gringotts now that their attention has been called to it, and certainly by me.”</p>
<p>Again, he pauses, letting the information sink in, and continues only with another nod from Petunia.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore has a lot of power, as what we call a Light Lord. There are three – Well, there <em>were</em> originally two… <em>factions</em>, you might call them, of magic. The Light, and the Dark. The Light were about progression and development, the Dark about conservation and protection. The Grey then arose as a compromise of sorts, and thus we now have the three. The Light and Dark traditionally have a leader, called a Dark Lord or Light Lord – not that they are always men these days, but rather, when a motion was called to allow flexibility in the naming of the position to recognise the women who had started to hold the roles as well, it was questioned that those without a male or female identity would then struggle, and as such it was decreed that the titles would remain ‘Lord’ regardless of gender. But I digress…”</p>
<p>Quickly, he regathers himself.</p>
<p>“The Dark and Light <em>always</em> have a Lord, whereas with the Grey, it is an occasional occurrence. Dumbledore is currently the Light Lord, and last I knew, He Who Must Not Be Named – who killed James and Lily – was the Dark Lord, though I am unaware of who will now hold the mantle. As I say, Dumbledore holds a lot of power as the Light Lord, and will likely have used that to his advantage to escape opposition over his actions regarding Harry.”</p>
<p>Here, he pauses, because his throat is tight with the thought of James’ death, and the clear desire in Petunia’s expression to ask a question provides a suitable excuse for him to take a second and compose himself once more.</p>
<p>“This… ‘Dark’ faction,” she hedges. “They were allowed a mass murderer as their ‘Lord’?”</p>
<p>“It’s…” Salazar hesitates, trying to find the right word, and eventually settles on, “Complicated. He was charismatic, held a lot of sway among the Heirs of traditionally Dark families, and he was magically powerful, too. A suitable candidate. No one realised that his plans were not simply to lead the Dark, but to rule the country – and possibly the world. By the time it became clear…”</p>
<p>Trailing off, he shakes his head and grimaces.</p>
<p>“Normally, the Lords of the Dark and Light – and Grey – <em>are</em> Lords in their own right, but it is not a requirement. If someone holds sufficient power and footing in, say, the Dark, then they may simply become the Dark Lord on their own merit. He Who Must Not Be Named had simply too much power. It was something of a coup, really. It became an all-out war, and many lives were lost over more than a decade.”</p>
<p>“A <em>decade</em>…” Petunia whispers, Salazar nodding in grim confirmation, trying not to think too hard himself about how much longer it all stretched on for after he found himself displaced.</p>
<p>“I have much to catch up on regarding current affairs and the impact of the war,” he admits. “From what I gather, the foundations remain the same, but I am reasonably certain that some things will have changed. Once I know where everything stands, I will start to become active as Lord Potter, to repair the damage done by Dumbledore over the last… however many years.”</p>
<p>He doesn’t know how old his nephew is, he realises – never mind how long it has been since James and Lily died. All Gornuk told him was that the war lasted more than a decade, and that it ended when Harry somehow survived a killing curse – which Salazar really must look into, too.</p>
<p>“The damage?” Vernon asks, speaking for the first time since Salazar starts his explanation, and though he does not seem to have followed it all quite so well as his wife, he looks suitably troubled.</p>
<p>“The Potter Family are traditionally Grey – and close to Dark, at that,” Salazar sighs, shifting his grip on his mug and only then realising that the tea inside has long since gone cold. “Dumbledore has used our seats for his Light agenda, directly against the views of our family. That will have to be rectified.”</p>
<p>
  <em>And Albus Dumbledore will have a lot to answer for.</em>
</p>
<p>“Until Harry is seventeen, I will remain Lord Potter as well as Lord Slytherin, and take on the responsibilities of teaching him – and your son, too, if you would like. I’m sure the lessons will be somewhat applicable to the non-magical world, if Dudley does not turn out to have magical capabilities himself.”</p>
<p>“Dudley?” Petunia blinks, glancing at her husband. “Magical?”</p>
<p>“Mmm…” Salazar cocks his head, a little surprised by her reaction. “You’ll likely have passed down your own latent magical ability, and with both your own presence and Harry around to cultivate it from an early age, I could well see Dudley exhibiting magical abilities.”</p>
<p>“<em>My</em> latent magical ability?” Petunia echoes, apparently bewildered. “What – I’m not…”</p>
<p>For several seconds, Salazar can only stare at her blankly, before realisation hits. He’s spent the last decade of his life seeking out those with magical abilities when one mistake could mean death for both himself and others; he doesn’t make mistakes about these things, and yet she’s clearly not faking her oblivious reaction.</p>
<p>“You don’t know about it?” he hedges carefully, mind starting to click through the gears as she shakes her head, because if the magic he can <em>clearly</em> feel coming from her isn’t the most she can manage with full effort, then there must be more to come; she <em>must</em> have some usable ability, surely. “In that case, I feel that the best thing to do would be for you to come with me when I return to Gringotts next week, and we’ll see about cultivating that – if, of course, you wish to.”</p>
<p>“Cultivating it?” she repeats, eyes wide.</p>
<p>“So you can use it,” Salazar nods. “I don’t think you’ll ever be a natural spell-caster, but I’m sure you could manage a few things with the right wand in your hand.”</p>
<p>Her frantic nod is something of a surprise, but he decides not to question it or the desperate glint in her eyes, merely returning the nod more sedately.</p>
<p>“I’ll teach all three of you, then,” he settles on. “Dudley and Harry, I’ll teach what Dumbledore should already have taught Harry – and more besides. You, I’ll provide the education you should have had alongside your sister.”</p>
<p>To tell the truth, Salazar’s more than a little exhausted by the constant need to adapt to everything new which is thrown at him. In one day, he’s lost his family, friends, home and work, returned to his original time – at least, in line with his body’s aging – and discovered that his previous family is dead and buried, and found a new family instead, alongside an apparent long-term plot from, Salazar can only assume, the Light Lord himself. After all, it would have been Dumbledore who decided not to admit Petunia Dursley, or whatever her surname was back then, and Salazar can’t help but wonder who else, besides Petunia and himself, has been denied their proper education by the man simply for not having the ‘right’ kind of magical ability.</p>
<p><em>As if there could </em>ever<em> be a ‘right’ kind.</em></p>
<p>“Perhaps,” he begins, stifling a sudden yawn, “We should continue this tomorrow. I will finish explaining what I need to, you can tell me what we know, and then… Well, then we can go from there, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Vernon nods, smile understanding, and Salazar reflects briefly that it’s strange how familiar they seem after just one day.</p>
<p>He tries not to think about the fact that he could just be getting used to starting anew.</p>
<p>“Come on,” the larger man continues, apparently oblivious to Salazar’s musings. “We’ll introduce you to Harry and Dudley properly.”</p>
