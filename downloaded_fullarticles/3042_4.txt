    <p>The Gryffindor common room was mostly empty right now due to the fact is was one in the morning. It was still dark and gloomy outside if one was to look out the window. It was so silent that if a pin would drop, no one but the house elfs would hear it. Just about everyone was asleep right now, save for two 5th years James Potter and Remus Lupin.</p><p>James Potter liked to think of himself as someone that is smart, popular, and loved by everyone (except maybe his Lily-Flower but she will come around). He considered himself one of the coolest guys at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At the moment, James was feeling less than stellar. Lily rejected him cruelly once again. She made it very clear at dinner that she would rather date the giant squid in the black lake than him. All he had done was have her dessert explode with confetti falling on her. He had even been holding lilies (note the flower, he was not actually holding Lily) for her. To make matters worse, Professor McGonagall was laying on so much homework because this was the year that OWLS were taking place. So, he did what any (un)reasonable stressed out 15-year-old would do. He started drinking a bottle of firewhiskey. By that point, he considered it would be more fun to drink with another person.</p><p>James first went over to Peter’s bed and shoved him face through the curtains.</p><p>“Peeeeter, wake up. Wanna get drunk with me?”</p><p>“The mummies are coming! Mummies are going to wrap us all up in blankets!!!” Peter whispered rapidly to James in his sleep.</p><p>James shook his head as he wobbled across the room to Sirius. James crouched down by Sirius’s ear and blew in it. Sirius grumbled in his sleep to go the fuck away Reggie. James sighed sadly as he moved sluggishly across the room.</p><p>James was starting to feel down. Everyone seemed to be asleep but him. Life kind of sucked right now for him. All he wanted was for one of his friends to be awake. He headed back towards his bed when a light bulb went off above James head. He grinned as he remembered that Remus had weed hidden underneath his bed. He had one last chance. James, being slightly (read intoxicated) intoxicated, didn’t have his normal coordination. One could almost say he was as quiet as a deer when walking. He smashed his toes up against the bed pole. An almost silent bloody hell was uttered.</p><p>Remus Lupin was thought of as the tame one of the Marauders. Most students and teachers thought of him as someone smart and hardworking. He was never caught cheating or playing a prank during a class. On the other hand; Peter, James, and Sirius caught red-handed almost every single time. There were few that actually pieced it together that Remus had just as much to do as the rest of the Marauders. Most thought, ‘oh poor Remus getting dragged into the rest of the Marauders pranks’. Little did they know, he was the mastermind of the execution of the pranks. That worked perfectly fine for him; it gave him very little detention unlike Sirius, James, and the occasional Peter who would get caught. He knew not getting caught was very much so in his advantage because it gave him the ability to get the rest of his friends out of detention.</p><p>Remus was laying on his bed trying to think of different ways that he and his friends could prank the school. He knew for a fact, that Sirius and James would twist any idea to make the prank harsher to the Slytherin students. Remus sighed loudly. He was grateful the rest of the guys were sleeping. That was until he heard someone stumbling around. A quiet bloody hell was heard.</p><p>“Psssst, Remus. Are you awake?” whined James.</p><p>Remus briefly debated saying no because he wasn’t sure if he was willing to be social at this late (early) hour.</p><p>“Yes, James. I’m awake” Remus mumbled as he opened the curtain facing James bed.</p><p>James stumbled out of his bed holding two bottles of firewhiskey, one was a third empty and the other was unopened. He flopped into Remus bed and held out the unopened bottle of firewhiskey to him. Remus grabbed the offered drink with a crook of a smile, causing a little dimple to appear on the side of his mouth.</p><p>“Remus” * hiccup * “My brother from another mother”</p><p>“I know you have weed hidden underneath your bed. Sirrrrrrriuuusss told me about it” James hiccupped again.</p><p>Remus felted a vague sense of annoyance towards Sirius, due to the fact he told him in private while they were cuddling but that was not something he wanted to mention to James right now. Remus leaned his body over the bed, while using one hand to balance himself and the other to go and grab the shoebox with the weed in it.</p><p>“Reeeemmmmus, man, you gotta catch up with me. I can’t be the only one.” James sat up and took the unopened bottle from him and swung it back and forth.</p><p>Remus snatched the bottle away from James, and used his teeth to pull away the cork from the top. He spat out the cork screw and chugged it down. Feeling the firewhiskey was a welcome distraction from James staring at him like an eager puppy.</p><p>“I think I should roll the weed since you look like you are about to fall over.” Remus said grinning before he burped loudly.</p><p>James was already giggling at this point because the alcohol had hit him hard. Remus shook his head fondly at him. He took the first drag and held it in and exhaled the smoke out in the shape of an O. James made grabby hands at Remus to pass it over, Remus skillfully dodged and took another hit before giving it to James.</p><p>Remus felt himself fully relaxing as the alcohol and drugs kicked in. He closed his eye for a moment, making a promise to himself that he would do this more often. He glanced over at James, who was tracing random squiggles in the air. It was nice having just the two of them relaxing. With how hectic classes were becoming and trying to plan more elaborate pranks, it was nice to slow down.<br/> ______________________________________________________________________________</p><p>It was now two in the morning and both boys were a giggling mess. They were attempting to keep the other from being too loud and waking the others. At some point, they had both started to get rowdy and giggly. Being crossfaded gave the boys a nice buzz.</p><p>James was staring up at the overhead curtain, he was deep in thought about what he wanted his future to be like. He knew that he wanted to marry as soon as he graduated from Hogwarts, just like his parents had done. He had always looked up to them because of how much they loved each other. James’s parents had a healthy relationship, especially because they came from pureblood families. He just really wanted to find happiness like that. James really hoped it would be Lily. Lily was the love of his life, right? He was feeling less sure every time she yelled something insulting at him. The creeping feeling of self-doubt was quickly approaching him. Begging him to let it drag him down and under. James shook himself out of those thoughts.</p><p>Remus was having similar thoughts of his future. Well, perhaps one furry difference. He was worried about what he was going to do after school. No one was going to want to hire a werewolf, no matter how good their NEWTS and OWLS were. He was a monster. He was lucky even got to go to Hogwarts. And even more so, he had four amazing friends.</p><p>James turned on his side so he could face Remus. He looked at his friends scar that ran down his face to part of his chest.</p><p>“Remus” James whispered.</p><p>“James” Remus teasingly mocked.</p><p>“What if we wrote a book about our lives in the future. We could add in stuff to give it dramatic affect and stuff” James was talking in a smaller voice while playing with his fingers.</p><p>Remus was still quiet, which was causing James slight panic.</p><p>James rushed in to tell him, “We could write it together. We don’t have to tell anyone, not even Peter or Sirius. It will be our secret.”</p><p>Remus spoke softly, “Our lives aren’t exciting enough to write about, James”.</p><p>James was moving his hands wildly now.</p><p>“But that’s the point right. We can make it anything we want! My parents have always told me writing can help you work out stuff” James was bouncing up and down now on the bed.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“YEEEEESSSSS!!!!” James shouted.</p><p>“Shhhhh! James, we don’t want to wake up the others” Remus scolded.</p><p>“Right. Right. Sorry.”</p><p>Remus was yawning, and told James, “Let’s talk more about this in the morning, okay?”</p><p>James easily agreed. He decided that he was going to sleep in Remus’ bed tonight. Remus just looked amused and let James cuddle in with him. They both were passed out in less than a minute. Little did they know, their story was going to get blown out of portion by their 7th year.</p>
