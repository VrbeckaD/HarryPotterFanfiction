    <p>Harry stared at the ceiling with unblinking eyes. He could almost remember the sunshine. He wondered if it was even summertime. It was hard to keep track of time in a place like this.</p>
<p>There were shouts from down the dingy hall, but Harry was a pro at ignoring noise of any kind. Although no one went crazy from Dementors anymore, thank Merlin they were gone, many inmates went crazy from the isolation. Or maybe it was cruelty heaped upon them from fellow inmates. Who knows what truly triggered the insanity.</p>
<p>There a loud thump from next door. Harry didn't tear his eyes away from the ceiling. Rabastan periodically banged against the wall that separated their cells. It was an attempt to draw Harry's attention. It never worked.</p>
<p>Just like he knew would happen, Rabastan started talking. "You're so quiet, Potter. It's unnerving."</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a loud door banging open. For the first time in what was probably hours, Harry sat up and scooted so his back was against the hall. He held his breath as a human guard walking up and down the aisle. He prayed for the guard to pass him by, but his luck had always been shitty.</p>
<p>The guard stopped in front of his cell and stared at him with cruel eyes. The shiny key on the shiny ring magically appeared and before Harry knew it, his cell was opened and he was magically bound, being levitated behind the guard. He didn't struggle to get free. What was the point?</p>
<p>He was taken to the back office. He didn't show any fear. He wouldn't give the bastard that satisfaction. In a lot of ways, this was worse than what many of the prisoners did to him. They were criminals; he didn't expect them to show basic human decency. Guards used their power to intimidate and hurt because no one cared about what happened to a lowly prisoner. It was disgusting!</p>
<p>The guard undid Harry's trousers with rough hands, never even pretending gentleness of any kind. And without any sort of preparation, the nameless guard entered Harry in one smooth motion. Harry was used to it by now so didn't even wince at the unwelcomed intrusion.</p>
<p>With the uneven rhythm started by an overweight, grunting guard, Harry's mind wandered so he didn't have to be in the here and now as he was brutalized. He thought about how he came to be here.</p>
<p>The war had been going on full force for three years. Remus and Sirius had already been killed by Death Eaters. Others had fallen, of course, but no one that meant more to him than those two. Remus had been killed while his wife was pregnant and Tonks was shipped to a safehouse. Everyone had been scared she'd be a target. She fought it, wanting to fight and avenge her husband, but her need to protect her unborn child, the only link she had left to Remus, made her see reason. She and her father both went to the same safe house since he was in danger as well because of his blood status and the fact he married into a prominent Pure-blood family. Andromeda would have gone as well, but she was a trained Healer, and it was decided her skills would be useful to have during the war.</p>
<p>Harry had hardened. He lost his remaining two family members. The Weasleys also suffered some loses. Fred hadn't survived. Neither had Ron. Hermione was hurt so badly that she was in a coma, and no one knew if she'd ever wake up.</p>
<p>Up until then, Harry was doing everything he could to not go too far, but Hermione was the last straw. He starting using the killing curse against Death Eaters. Dumbledore always said he shouldn't fight with Unforgivables, but the Death Eaters were using them. And if the light side had any hope of winning, they needed to fight fire with fire as the Muggles would say. Simply disarming wasn't working. They were losing people! Harry felt fully within his rights.</p>
<p>Some agreed with him, but they were in the minority, and the ones who did agree weren't brave enough to actually go against Dumbledore and use the unforgivable curse.</p>
<p>Even though they disagreed on fighting styles, Harry couldn't believe that Dumbledore decided to throw him into Azkaban at the age of seventeen. How could Dumbledore put him here? He was trying to win a war with as few casualties on their side as possible. Dumbledore's way wasn't going to win it. Harry did what he thought was right, but Azkaban was where he was now. He wasn't sure what game Dumbledore was playing, but obviously, only the old man knew the rules. The prophecy said Harry alone was the one who'd defeat Voldemort. How did Dumbledore expect him to do that from Azkaban?</p>
<p>Hips that sped up brought Harry back from his reminiscing. "You're such a slut," the man grunted. "You like my big cock, don't you, you little bitch."</p>
<p>If Harry wasn't so tired, he would have rolled his eyes. The words were so unoriginal. They always said the same things.</p>
<p>Finally, the man spilled himself inside of Harry. He made the mistake of grimacing at the stickiness and the guard raised his hand and backhanded Harry for his attitude, knocking him to the floor.</p>
<p>"Just for that, I'll make sure you're not done yet. I happen to know someone who loves to have you as a playmate." The guard lifted him up, and while keeping a beefy arm around Harry's neck, pulled up the dangling trousers, not snapping the buttons closed, and dragged him to the cells.</p>
<p>There were jeers and laughs about him taking it up the ass like a good little slut. They stopped in front of Rabastan's cell and once the cell was opened, he was unceremoniously thrown in and the door slammed shut behind him.</p>
<p>"Have fun, Lestrange!" the guard taunted.</p>
<p>There was shuffling as Rabastan came to him. "You okay, Potter?" he whispered, careful to not have any of the other prisoners overhear them.</p>
<p>Harry didn't take his eyes from the floor. "You ask stupid questions," he whispered back.</p>
<p>Rabastan gripped his chin and raised Harry's head so their eyes met.</p>
<p>"You going to take your turn?" Harry asked. He wasn't afraid to show a little bit of his backbone to Rabastan.</p>
<p>"If I don't, the guard will give you to someone else who will."</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes as Rabastan's lips touched his forehead. He knew it could be worse. Out of everyone in Azkaban, prisoners and guards included, Rabastan was the one who took the most care and tried to not hurt Harry. He even tried to get Harry to enjoy it. It could be much worse than Rabastan.</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes and dragged Rabastan's lips to his in a hard kiss. Rabastan groaned, his tongue pressing against the seam of Harry's lips. The younger man opened his mouth and gave into Rabastan's hands."</p>
<p>"Let's do this quickly," Harry whispered harshly.</p>
<p>A shadow seemed to cross Rabastan's eyes before it was gone so quick Harry thought he might have imagined it. "Of course. Just lay down and let me do all of the work."</p>
<p>Harry did as he was told.</p>
<p>Rabastan pressed against Harry's neck, kissing and biting, sucking on the pulse point. His hands pressed against the cock that was hiding by Harry's trousers, palming it with a soft hand.</p>
<p>"Hurry up," Harry said. "I'm already loose. Just get it over with!" he ordered.</p>
<p>"Of course," Rabastan agreed. He undid his own trousers and took out his cock that already half hard.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't help but watch as Rabastan brought himself to full hardness. There was something that Harry found enticing to watch. He didn't understand it, but he had such few pleasures in his life now. He wasn't truly going to question it.</p>
<p>When Rabastan was fully hard and ready, he hovered Rabastan and entered him slowly, stopping every inch or so so Harry could adjust. He just had a cock in him so he was still pretty loose, but Harry did appreciate the consideration.</p>
<p>And once Rabastan was in up to the hilt, he thrust in and out, his hips snapping forward with a fierceness that always took Harry by surprise.</p>
<p>Harry wrapped his legs around Rabastan's waist, and Rabastan went deeper with that position.</p>
<p>Rabastan leaned down and kissed him, their tongues tangling as thrusts became more frantic. Rabastan groaned into Harry's mouth, sending shivers up and down Harry's spine.</p>
<p>Rabastan pulled back, and they looked into each other's eyes. Rabastan grabbed Harry's cock that actually got hard this time—it didn't happen every time—and he pumped it, teasing the sensitive head, in time with the snap of his hips.</p>
<p>As both of their orgasms neared, Harry felt a sliver of affection for Rabastan. After all, Rabastan was the only one who didn't go out of his way to hurt Harry. How could he not feel some affection for the man?</p>
<p>And together, they erupted. Harry's release ended up all over Rabastan's chest while Rabastan's seed slid out and down Harry's legs.</p>
<p>They breathed deeply as Rabastan pulled away, stuffing himself back into his dirty grey trousers.</p>
<p>Harry sat up and did up his own grey trousers. "You think that will satisfy the bastard for a while?"</p>
<p>Rabastan grabbed Harry's hand in answer and leaned forward, pressing a soft kiss to Harry's lips. The once-upon-a-time-savior quickly backed away. They never kissed when the sex was done. It was an unspoken rule, and Harry didn't like that Rabastan was changing the rules. It unsettled him.</p>
<p>Harry scooted away and went to the far wall, where he leaned his back and waited for the sadistic guard to come and put him back in his own cell. And he did whatever he could to not meet Rabastan's gaze.</p>
