  <span>“James? Lily?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ten years ago, Sirius struggled through the bricks and wood and whatever else, desperately trying to find some sign of life. A small part of him said he shouldn’t shout so loud, that the Muggles will hear, but most of him didn’t care.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“James? Where are you, you-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stopped. Some flaming red hair under a pile of bricks. He moved them aside, desperately, and was met with a face he knew all too well. She’d been his friend for years now, he was best man at her wedding, but now…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now her fair skin was white, and cold. Her beautiful green eyes, once sparkling with life, were glassy. He closed her eyes, he couldn’t bare to see what has gone. He held her to his chest, silently sobbing for this life that had been taken. He knew no collapsing house killed her; this was the killing curse. He knew there’s no way James could be alive. He wept for his friends, for the life they could have led.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A noise startles him out of his reverie. A shifting noise, and something almost like a voice. For a second he thinks of their cat, but it can’t be. It sounds like a baby!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He moves bricks aside swiftly yet carefully, and reveals the one scrap of life left here. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry,” he whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hadn’t even allowed himself to consider Harry, to think about that poor boy, probably already dead at barely a year old. But here he was, warm, and alive, in Sirius’ arms. His fingers brushed the boy’s forehead. A scar, like a bolt of lightning, cut through it. He didn’t mind, for a baby to come out of this completely unscathed would be nothing short of a miracle, one scar is a small price to pay, and it wasn’t even bleeding. The boy opened his eyes, and smiled at the familiar face of his uncle Padfoot, not noticing the carnage around them. Sirius saw those eyes, so alive in Harry while they were - not, in Lily. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>He heard footsteps behind him, but didn’t truly recognise it until he heard a familiar voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“S-Sirius!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hagrid was blubbering, looking in disbelief at the carnage. Sirius didn’t blame him. In fact, he was surprised by his own composure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When they said - oh, but I didn’t think it’d be this bad…” he lamented.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hagrid. Lily - she’s…” but Sirius couldn’t continue. He broke into tears, and could only feel Hagrid’s large hands patting him gently on the back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, kid. I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And James? I couldn’t find him. Do you know, is he-” Sirius manages to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid so. He’s over there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Through eyes blurred with tears Sirius followed the hand of the giant over to the front of the house, which he must have overlooked. He stumbled over there, Harry still clutched tight in his arms, and caught sight of his friend. A strange mirroring of the boy he’s carrying, even this young. The same dark skin, and hair. They’d always looked so similar, since the day Harry was born. And here they are, separated so soon, one drawn beyond the veil, into death.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He dropped to the ground, watering the earth with his tears of lament over this brave man - this poor boy, who died in a man’s war - as he felt a hand once more on his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius can just find the energy to nod his head slightly, and allowed himself to be heaved up onto his feet, still clutching the child. He looked up into Hagrid’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry’s alive?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius nodded again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t know how… a little baby. When-” and Hagrid broke down again. “But anyway. I’m sorry, Sirius, I’m gonna have to take ‘im.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius looks up in shock and horror. “Take him? Where, why? Hagrid, why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dumbledore’s orders, ‘mafraid. Says he gotta be taken to ‘is family.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry hasn’t got any family. He’s-” Sirius fights for control over his voice. “There’s nobody.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dumbledore said ‘e’s got an aunt an’ uncle. An’ a cousin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius’ eyes widen in comprehension. “Not - not Lily’s sister? And her husband? They came to the wedding, no idea why, they - they were horrible! Left before the ceremony. And Dumbledore wants Harry to live with them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hagrid nods solemnly. “Dunno why. But you know Dumbledore - he always knows best. C’mon, Sirius, give me Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius thinks for a moment. For a moment it looks like he’s actually going to hand the boy over, but he draws him back into his chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I used to think that about Dumbledore too,” he says darkly. “He always knows best. Well I think that’s true enough. He knows what’s best for Harry, sure. Doesn’t mean he’ll do it. He knew what was best for them, too-” he begins to look towards James’ body but he can’t quite do it. “And look where that got them. He knows </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Dumbledore does. Knows how to use people.” He looks down at Harry’s face, sleeping again. Peaceful. “He will not use Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sirius, yeh don’t know what yer saying…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh I know exactly what I’m saying! I just can’t believe it’s taken this to help me see it. He always has, always. Dumbledore. He collects people, does Dumbledore. He builds an army without his army knowing they’re being built.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He crouches down beside James. Beside what was once James, anyway. “He takes the best in the school at charms and transfiguration and tries to turn him into a warrior, to fight in Dumbledore's war. All he wanted was a family, all he ever wanted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stood up, looked over to Lily. “He takes the best potioneer of her generation and uses her talents for his own. And she could have done anything, she could have been so brilliant, but he wasted her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked back to Hagrid. “And he takes this boy - what, fourteen? This boy who has been cast out of his only home, and he takes advantage of him, until years later that boy can’t even see fault in his mentor when he’s killed-” he pauses. He has to take a breath, and he doesn’t like the look on Hagrid’s face. “When he’s killed that boy’s friends. He’ll still do his bidding. Still take innocent lambs to the slaughter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment Hagrid looks angry, but then he drops his head in sadness. “Yeh don’t know what yer saying,” he just said again. Quite pathetically, Sirius thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hagrid, you’re getting Harry. I’m sorry, but he’s not going to that bitch and her husband.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hagrid shakes his head incredulously. “Yeh going to take ‘im?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’ll come see yeh tomorrow. Or someone will, I dunno. See how yeh feel then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Feel free,” Sirius said grimly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wrapped Harry in the blanket he’d picked the kid up in, and tucked him under his jacket, hitting him with as many sticking and protecting spells as he could think of. He then got onto his bike, and drove off into the night.</span>
