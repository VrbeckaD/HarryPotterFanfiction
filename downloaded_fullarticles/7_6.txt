    <p>A week later, after the incident with the Death Eater targeting his sweet Harry, found Severus exiting the bathroom after taking a shower. A towel was wrapped around his waist, as water dripped from his steel black feathers, he walked over to the edge of the bed. His onyx eyes staring down at his beloved Mate. Harry was sleeping on his side naked, with his hands tucked underneath his cheek, the blanket lying over his hips and thighs. His small fluffy wings seemed to take on a glow from the sunlight radiating through the windows. And, when Severus trailed his eyes down to Harry’s stomach, soft tendrils of green and gold intertwining with each other. The gold forming a soft circle of light that seem to shine from within Harry’s stomach, while the bright soft green light formed a ring of circle around Harry’s waist and hips.</p><p> </p><p>Watching in amazement and in awe, Severus watched the golden light pulsing like a heartbeat. Unknowingly, and perhaps subconsciously, Harry, who was still fast deep in sleep, rolled onto his back as he brought his hand over his stomach. Severus’ breath hitched in awe when wisps of golden light touched and encased Harry’s fingers. As if their newly formed unborn baby knew and wanted to meet their Mother. Swallowing, Severus sat at the edge of the bed, eyes focused on Harry’s stomach. Leaning over, Severus pressed his lips just beside Harry’s hand, where he had laid it on top of his stomach.</p><p> </p><p>Nuzzling, Severus basked in the warmth of the golden light, that now, had reached up to touch his cheek. It made him smile. He wonders if their unborn baby will be a boy or a girl. It would be nice to have a little princess running around. A little girl to spoil and love. Though, no matter the gender, Severus only wanted a healthy baby after all. That’s all it matters. Straightening himself, he continued to watch Harry sleep. He closed his eyes, going deep within his own mind. Within his own mind, he stood on a island surrounded by water. The skies were black. An endless amount of nothing but darkness. And above him, Severus looked up at the brightest star. His Harry. His Mate. Within his mind, Severus tilted his head as his eyes search the night sky.</p><p> </p><p>He let out a soft gasp. There it was. Their baby. A tiny ball of light surrounded by gold and green light.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, hello…” Severus murmured at the little Star.</p><p> </p><p>The tiny ball of light descended down to Severus, making him reach up with the tip of his finger to nudge at his little one. It flickered and then pulsed, radiating happiness and love. Oh…was this what their little one was feeling?</p><p> </p><p>“I cannot wait to meet you, little one.” The Headmaster whispered. “You’re very precious to your Mother and I.”</p><p> </p><p>As if it knew and understood him, the ball of light circled around him—bouncing happily before it flew right back up into the night sky, shining its soft bright light. Though, not as bright as Harry’s but if Severus had to guess, the light will become bigger and brighter as their baby develops.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Waking up from his happy dream, Harry felt something heavy lying on top of his stomach. Glancing down, he smiled at what he saw. Severus had his face pressed against his stomach, nuzzling and kissing. He feathered his fingers through the Headmaster’s locks. The softness of Severus’ hair always amazes him. No matter how much his Mate spends his time brewing and making potions. Harry spent years pining over Severus. The pull and force to need to have Severus take him overwhelmed him so much, that instinct took over the day that the Death Eater had attacked him on school grounds. He needed his Mate to protect him and he did. Severus was so dangerous and perfect.</p><p> </p><p>Harry slid his fingers down Severus’ shoulder blades, and onwards towards the dangerous looking wings. He’d seen how deadly those wings were. They may look soft but in reality they could become sharp and can cut through anything. He’d seen how Severus used his wings to take down the Death Eater. It was bloody. Brutal. And it made Harry shiver in delight. Oh, yes. His Mate was dangerous and sexy. Harry slipped a feather between his fingers, rubbing the soft feather, before he pressed his entire hand into the wings, while his other free hand laid on top of Severus’ head.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm…” He sighed in content.</p><p> </p><p>He felt his Mate freeze. As if he’d caught him in the act of doing something, he didn’t want Harry to see. Chuckling, Harry whispers, “Good morning, Sev.”</p><p> </p><p>Leaning back further into the pillows, Harry glanced down as his Mate’s wings ruffled and flared back. The Boy Who Lived swallowed, mouth going dry as his Mate looked dark and predatory. Suddenly, feeling insecure, Harry reached down to grab the blanket to cover the rest of his body. And when he tried to, his hand was snatched up in an iron tight grip. Gulping, bright green eyes peeked up at black onyx eyes. Only to find such heated gaze upon him.</p><p> </p><p>His Mate took his hand that is in his hand, placed it behind his beck, all the while, his free hand snaked around Harry’s smooth back, and settled there. His Mate pressed his mouth on Harry’s neck, nuzzling and kissing, before biting on that soft pale flesh.</p><p> </p><p>“Mngh!” Harry gasped in shock.</p><p> </p><p>His own wings shivered in delight, which suddenly made Harry dangle his head back, letting his Mate nibble and sucking on his neck. He was starting to grow wet between his thighs. His cock was started to swell up, as well. Oh, it felt good, he thought. It felt <em>really</em> good. The blanket fell down to his hips, barely hiding his cock, until Severus pushed Harry down.</p><p> </p><p>“Oof!” Harry yelped. “Severus—” He protested until he saw the look on his Mate’s face.</p><p> </p><p>It was a vulnerable look.</p><p> </p><p>A broken, vulnerable look.</p><p> </p><p>A frown was on his Mate’s face. Mouth pinched.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s wrong, love?” Harry asked, gently. He raised his arms out, hoping his Mate could take a hint, and when Severus let Harry wrap his arms around him. Severus’ wings hovered around him. “What’s wrong?” He asked once more. Harry touched their bond and felt a mix of emotions from Severus.</p><p> </p><p>Anxious. Nervous. Sad. Happy.</p><p> </p><p>“I will protect us.” Severus murmured softly. “You will never have to be alone anymore. I’ll do anything to make you and your Mother happy.”</p><p> </p><p>Mother?</p><p> </p><p>What?</p><p> </p><p>“Severus, wha—” Harry was, once again, interrupted and cut off when Severus pressed his lips over his.</p><p> </p><p>Severus deepened the kiss, letting his tongue slip and dance with Harry’s. Their kisses were wet and loud. It was burning Severus from the inside. With the need to make Harry happy. To make their unborn child happy and content. To never be bullied and hurt. The memories of Harry’s scream and his horrified reaction when the Death Eater was about to touch and tore at his wings, made Severus angry. He will never ever want to see his Mate nor his child react like that ever again.</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t know what’s gotten into Severus. But something about his comment he made just moments ago. Suddenly, he felt a large hand rubbing circles on his stomach, as their kiss still continued on. Breaking away from the kiss, Harry looked down to see his Mate’s hand over his stomach. He watched lazily as Severus press his fingers in circular motions, then stopped.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry…”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes?” Green eyes blinked a couple times in confusion.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m terribly sorry for the way I’ve treated you over the years…” Severus apologized softly. “I know you wouldn’t want someone like me as your Mate, yet, here we are. Stuck together for eternity.” His Mate winced.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, love.” Harry smiled softly. He pulled Severus down, pressing his Mate’s head into his neck. “Don’t be like that, please. You are the One for me. My Mate. Who will protect me and our future little ones. I’ve chosen you a long time ago, but our biology seemed to kick our arse to get a move on with it.” He chuckled.</p><p> </p><p>“Then…” Severus pulled a bit back, eyes drowning in Harry’s beautiful eyes. “How do you feel about having a little one now?”</p><p> </p><p>Blinking, Harry asked, “You want to have a baby with me?”</p><p> </p><p>Chuckling, Severus replied, “Harry, you are pregnant.”</p><p> </p><p>Wait.</p><p> </p><p>Wha—</p><p> </p><p>“—at?” Harry squeaked.</p><p> </p><p>Sneering, Severus said, “Potter, you are indeed pregnant. With my child. Your body seem to have accepted my seed so early, that our child is already slowly developing within your womb.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ooohhh….my…” Harry breathed out. He placed his hands over Severus, and then, closed his eyes. His magic reaching out to feel that underdeveloped but faint magical core within him. The moment his magic touched that faint magical signature, Harry felt a burst of love and happiness, and excitement from the baby that sat in him. Suddenly, tears started streaming down his face.</p><p> </p><p>Severus cupped Harry’s face as soon as he saw that first tear drop. “I’m so sorry, Harry. If you were not ready to have a little one now, I support you in whatever—” His words were cut off as Harry wrapped his arms around his neck, sniffling soft hiccups into his neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up, you git.” Harry mumbled. “I’m not sad, nor angry. I’m so happy, Severus. I’ve always wanted to have a family. And now that I do…” Harry leaned back, smiling up at him. “I’m so excited for our baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Sighing in relief, Severus kissed Harry again.</p>
