    <p>There it was again, that sneer. It was the tiniest curl of his upper lip, barely noticeable to anyone around them. Yet Harry caught sight of it again, noting the way the blonde’s brow furrows at the same time as he fights the urge to roll his eyes. He feels eyes on him, and he turns to meet the brown eyes of Hermione as she frowns at him.</p><p>“What?” His voice is defensive as he straightens up in his seat. The Great Hall clatters around them as Hermione studies his face for a few moments.</p><p>“You were staring,” she lifts an eyebrow as if asking a question. Harry opens his mouth to disagree with her and her brow arches higher. He presses his lips together in a thin line as he shakes his head at her, his shoulders raising as takes a deep breath.</p><p>“He’s up to something,” he finally mumbles as he glances to the table to grab his goblet.</p><p>“Who’s up to something?” Ron puts his knife and fork down loudly as he tunes into the conversation happening across the table. Harry doesn’t meet Hermione’s eyes as he swallows a large mouthful of pumpkin juice.</p><p>“Malfoy,” he can feel Hermione’s eyes burning into him as he focuses on Ron’s freckled face. He can tell that her eyes are narrowed in suspicion and she would be biting her lip to stop whatever was in her mind from coming out. “He seems sick of Zabini and the others,” he chances a glance across the Great Hall and meets the grey eyes of Draco and his gaze quickly switches back to Ron with a gulp.</p><p>“So?” Ron looks confused by Harry’s words. “You’ve been kinda obsessed this past term, Har,” Harry can feel his cheeks burn at Ron’s words and he looks away from his friends, his jaw clenching tightly.</p><p>“Sorry that I’m concerned about Death Eaters trying to infiltrate the school,” he stands up abruptly and grabs his bag before heading out of the Great Hall alone. Hermione turns to Ron with a sigh.</p><p>“Really, Ron?” Her tone is soft as she rubs a hand over her face.</p><p>“He is!” The red head throws up his hands in disbelief at Hermione’s reaction. “He’s always staring at him, watching him, following him…” he trails off as he realises Hermione is barely paying attention to him, her eyes instead focusing on the blonde as he begins leaving the Great Hall, his gang all following closely behind him.</p><p>“We should get down to Potions,” she looks back to Ron who’s staring at her with his mouth slightly open. “Look, I’m just not sure we should be accusing Harry of being obsessed.”</p><p>“But he <i>is</i>,” Ron grumbles as they make their way down to the Dungeons. They enter Slughorn’s class to hear him asking Harry what he could smell in the classroom.</p><p>“Hardwood, rose and musk,” Harry shrugs as his friends drop into the seats beside him with a small nod to the Professor. Hermione takes a deep breath and realises she smells fresh cut grass and Ron’s body wash.</p><p>“Mister Malfoy?” Slughorn rubs his hands together as he looks around the class waiting to pick his next victim.</p><p>“Lavender, chamomile and salt,” the blonde sneers as he focuses on the most powerful scents. He manages to form the sentence into not being as creepy as it sounds in his head. <i>Sweat</i> wasn’t exactly a smell you would admit to noticing.</p><p>“Mister Finnigan?”</p><p>“Ginger, Christmas and coconut,” the Irishman nods as Hermione clicks to what the Potion was in the large cauldron at the front of the room.</p><p>“Miss Patil?”</p><p>“Lavender and incense,” she sighs softly as she exhales.</p><p>“Mister Zabini?”</p><p>“Roses and earthy tones,” the Slytherin glances at Harry.</p><p>“Any guesses what we’re brewing today?” Hermione’s hand flies up into the air as expected and Slughorn waves his hand for her to speak.</p><p>“Amortentia?” Her voice wavers ever so slightly as she answers and Slughorn grins. “It smells like what you desire,” she adds in almost a whisper as Harry’s eyes snap to her.</p><p>“Correct Miss Granger!” Slughorn claps his hands as the class simultaneously inhales, trying to work out if they had smelled the specific scent outside the classroom. “We will be brewing Amortentia over the next nine days in pairs, and I will be checking everyone’s pockets and bags before they leave. This Potion is extremely powerful and dangerous, and I cannot allow it out of this room.”</p><p>He waves his wand towards the board and a list of pairs appears, Hermione and Harry, Ron and Draco, Seamus and Blaise, Pansy and Millicent, Neville and Theodore, Dean and Parvati.</p><p>“Good luck,” Harry nods to his best friend as the red head grabs his bag to go to Draco’s table. Hermione opens her book to the instructions, and they set about preparing to make the Potion. Ron and Draco share a glare as they each open their own books, the two of them heading to the supply closet to collect their ingredients.</p><p>“Look, Weasel, I’m not going to let you choose sub-par ingredients and ruin this Potion,” Draco’s lip curls as he bumps the red head’s hand out of the way. Ron’s face scrunches up as the scent of toothpaste and leather clears from the air in the space away from the Potion and he sniffs slightly as the blonde passes him ingredients.</p><p>“I’m not your slave,” he looks at the bags Draco had handed him, and he shakes his head as he sees the fresh roses in one of them. “Also, we only need the thorns,” he adds holding up the roses as if offended by them.</p><p>“The thorns we have in here are dried, and fresh works much better for Amortentia,” Draco rolls his eyes as he grabs the Standard Potioning Water and shoos Ron out of the ingredient closet. “You’re holding five things; you can move a bit quicker.”</p><p>“I think he’s right,” Harry taps his pocket where the Half-Blood Prince’s Potions book was and Hermione sighs heavily.</p><p>“Harry, the textbook doesn’t say anything about the thorns not being dried,” she grabs the bag of thorns from the shelf and Harry begrudgingly takes them and the rest of the ingredients as Hermione grabs the base.</p><p>The class sets to work brewing the Potion and Slughorn watches happily from the front of the room as the pairs from the same house whisper about what they had smelled from the Professors Potion. He notices the inter-house pairs don’t talk to each other unless necessary, except Ron and Draco who keep trading barbs as they battle to be top dog.</p><p>“Okay!” He claps his hands together as the bell rings. “Cover your Potions with the silk cloth and place them under your tables,” he pauses as they do as he says. “And now, for the next nine days one of you needs to come down every day to stir the Potion, I don’t care when you choose to do it, but it <i>must</i> be done.” The class ripples with the pairs agreeing who would come down and when as they file out of the classroom, most opting to come down during lunch taking turns each day.</p><p>Draco surreptitiously places a charm on the cauldron so he could check whether it had been stirred and he nods as Ron says he’ll do the first stir tomorrow.</p>
