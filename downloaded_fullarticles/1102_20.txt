    <p>Chapter 1<br/>
Back to hogwarts<br/>
Meagan Cardosa did not want to be like her sister.</p>
<p>As she stepped off the scarlet steam engine she heard the familiar friendly voice of hagrid " firs years this way". His voice boomed over the excited chatter of everyone scrambling off the platform which was understandable considering he was half giant. Meagan made her way to where the carriages that always pulled themselves were waiting to bring the rest of the students up to the castle, she leaned against a stack of luggage and hoped no one would talk to her, or notice her, she was sure they knew, they had to. Meagan put a cigarette to her lips and lit it by just thinking about it, it was a neat trick she learned back in her 4th year. Teachers didn't usually travel by the hogwarts express and Hagrid  was already halfway across the black lake so she was fairly certain she wouldn't get caught. She took her time smoking, concentrating on every breath she took, in her effort to be unseen Meagan had failed to notice the huge black winged creature that had a carriage attached to it's behind.<br/>
"Fascinating aren't they" said a soft but husky voice behind her. "This is the last carriage so I hope you don't mind sharing". Meagan just stared.<br/>
"I'm professor remus lupin your new defence against the dark arts teacher, it's nice to meet you".<br/>
Good for you Meagan said without tearing her eyes away from the sky that was now moving unnervingly fast as the creature obviously had little care for it's passengers.<br/>
Would it be rude to ask why she could see threstrals remus lupin thought as he stared at the girl in front of him, she had long curly raven hair that was glowing bright green at the bottom, her dark hair didn't do her any favours though as she was really pale, maybe, he thought, she's like me? No there's no way, Dumbledore would have said if there was a student with the condition.<br/>
"Yes"<br/>
"Excuse me?"<br/>
"Yes it would be rude to ask me why I can see threstrals professor lupin and besides it's not like I'd tell you, I only just met you and I haven't decided if I like you or not."<br/>
Professor lupins mouth hung open<br/>
"I I ddidnt  say that out loud"<br/>
"No you didn't, it seems you don't have the balls to say what you think, professor lupin" meagan smirked.</p>
