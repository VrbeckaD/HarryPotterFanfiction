  <em>I remember tears streaming down your face when I said I'll never let you go </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>When all those shadows almost killed your light</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">"What are we looking for again?"</p><p align="justify">"An Antipodean Opaleye. Or two. It's scaring the Muggles and stealing their livestock."</p><p align="justify">"And we're going to deal with it? Just the two of us?"</p><p align="justify">"No, of course not. I'm – we're just here to confirm that there indeed are dragons here and then we can call for backup."</p><p align="justify">"Oh, right."</p><p align="justify">The two trudged through the forest between the valley and the village. Newt had been asked to investigate some sightings of scarlet flames and dragon fewmets, and naturally, Tina had come along.</p><p align="justify">Two hours into their journey, the temperature dropped suddenly.</p><p align="justify">"Is this supposed to happen?"</p><p align="justify">"No, it isn't. This doesn't look good. Wand out, Tina."</p><p align="justify">Both drew their wands and continued forward cautiously. Soon, they entered a stretch of forest which was totally covered in fog. There were twin sharp intakes of breath as they understood their predicament.</p><p align="justify">"Surely not in this part of the world?"</p><p align="justify">"You said they only lived in Azkaban!" Tina said accusingly.</p><p align="justify">"I thought they did."</p><p align="justify">Without warning, three dementors burst through the fog. Tina screamed as they made straight for them. Newt could feel the dementors devouring his happiness, feel them making him miserable and desolate. Tina seemed more affected by them than he did, sinking to the floor and curling up in a ball, sobbing.</p><p align="justify">"Make them go away, make them go away! No, don't kill him, take me!" Newt knew all too well what was going through her mind; the memory had resurfaced in his mind too. He stood there frozen as the dementors headed straight for Tina. Just as they were bending over her, he came to his senses.</p><p align="justify">He called forth every moment spent with Tina, every time he had heard her tinkling laugh, every time the corners of her mouth turned up in that wide, sweet smile. He recalled her childlike excitement, her affection for his beasts and her voice, her American accent that he so loved. He thought of when he nursed every animal in his case back to health, remembered the familiar smells and sounds of his case and his precious, precious beasts. All this, and a deep, desperate hope to save her. </p><p align="justify">He opened his eyes and took a deep breath. "EXPECTO PATRONUM!" A basset hound burst forth from his wand, diverting the dementors' attention from Tina. He carefully sidled towards the Auror and put an arm around her as the cloaked figures turned to the Patronus he had produced. All was silent except for Tina's ragged breathing as they watched the Patronus disappear into the fog and the dementors after it.</p><p align="justify">"Come on, we need to get out of here before more come." Newt made to help Tina up, but she rolled over to the side and vomited, still weeping. "Oh, no," he said, concerned, and rubbed her back as she retched, and then, thoroughly exhausted, fainted. Newt put down the bags they'd been carrying, slid his arms under Tina and lifted her up. With much difficulty, he got his case open, and, casting a few silent protection spells around it, made his way down the steps clumsily. He laid Tina down on his bed and pulled the covers over her. There was nothing he could do now, only to let her rest and wait for her to wake up. He decided to check on the beasts to make sure everyone was all right.</p><p align="justify">He was counting the Bowtruckles when he was interrupted by a soft "Newt?" from in the shed. Stripping a few leaves from the tree and being squeaked at angrily by its residents in his haste, he sprinted to the shed and threw open the door. To his relief, Tina was awake and looking much better, the colour returning to her previously ashen face. She attempted to sit up but was gently pushed back onto the covers by Newt.</p><p align="justify">"How do you feel?"</p><p align="justify">"Much better."</p><p align="justify">"That's really good." It was all Newt could do to stop himself from flinging his arms around her, and an awkward silence took over between the two.</p><p align="justify">"Newt, you saved my life back there."</p><p align="justify">He shifted uncomfortably at this proclamation. "It's nothing." </p><p align="justify">It wasn't. It was everything. Somehow, in the turmoil of the past few months, despite (or was it because of?) everything that had happened, Tina Goldstein had wormed her way through the chinks in the armour that had protected his heart for so long, and made herself at home. He shuddered to think of how close he'd come to losing that beautiful soul that had accepted him so readily and turned his life around. She wasn't 'nothing', she was his everything. And the realization struck him like a bolt of lightning.</p><p align="justify">"No," he said, surprising himself.</p><p align="justify">"I take that back. It wasn't nothing."</p><p align="justify">Tina looked annoyed and grateful at the same time. "Why didn't you go?"</p><p align="justify">"What?"</p><p align="justify">"Why did you stay? You could've run, they were coming at me, you could have gone! You didn't need to help me, you could have gotten hurt too!"</p><p align="justify">"Why would I do that? You could have been Kissed!" When met with no reply, he took a deep breath and continued, "Tina, I'll never, ever, let you go."</p><p align="justify">Tears streamed down her face once more, but this time they were silent, dripping onto the pillow. She sniffed and shifted around on the bed.</p><p align="justify">"Really?"</p><p align="justify">"Really."</p>
