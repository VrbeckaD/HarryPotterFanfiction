    <p>Harri scrambled around a fence into a large park, her breath fast and panicked. Dudley's gang had decided to spend their evening chasing her through the neighborhood, and though she wasn't sure what they'd do if they caught up with her, she certainly didn't want to find out. The sounds of pursuit had begun to fade a few blocks ago, and Harri hoped that they'd grown bored of her. As she came into view of the small playground nestled at the centre of the park, she stumbled to a stop under a large tree, trying to catch her breath.</p>
<p>It had always been forcefully made clear to her that she meant absolutely nothing to the Dursleys. Now that Dudley had collected a group of friends to torment her, she truly believed that she was insignificant to the rest of the world as well. A sob caught in her throat, then her tears began to fall freely.</p>
<p>All she wanted was to be loved. Desperately, she wished that she had someone- even one person- who cared about her. To whom she was more than just a momentary distraction. She wanted a friend.</p>
<p>Closing her eyes, she let herself imagine it. A protector. Someone who wanted her to be happy and safe. Someone who - she dared to think - would love her.</p>
<p>"hey, kiddo," said a low voice, startling in its gentleness. "you're looking pretty bone-ly."</p>
<p>Harri started, looking around for the source of the voice. When she saw the only other person in the small park, she almost screamed.</p>
<p>In front of her, there stood a grinning skeleton, glowing silver-blue. He had appeared seemingly out of nowhere.</p>
<p>She tried to back away, but tripped over a tree root, and fell painfully. Gravel dug into her palms, almost breaking skin.</p>
<p>"don't worry!" the skeleton said, holding up his hands. Harri could see in between his bones. It didn't seem to be some sort of trick, or like it was fake. "i'm not going to hurt you. just wondering what a kid like you is doing all alone." He looked up at the sky, and the stars, and although his grin didn't fade, something else came into his expression.</p>
<p>"You're glowing," Harri said tremulously, the words coming out unbidden. "You're a skeleton."</p>
<p>The skeleton looked at himself. "so i am." He shoved his hands into his pockets. "say, kiddo, can you tell me- is this the surface?"</p>
<p>"The surface? Of what?" Harri said, eyes growing wide.</p>
<p>The skeleton rubbed the side of his head, and closed his eyes. "don't worry about it. man, i've forgotten my manners, huh?" He held out a hand. "i'm sans. sans the skeleton."</p>
<p>Gingerly, Harri shook his hand. "I'm Harri. Harri the... human?"</p>
<p>Sans laughed, a rattling sound that shook his whole body. Then he looked at her closer. "do you mind telling me how i got here? i was back home, and then suddenly, poof!” He animated the sound with hands. “i was here. did someone summon me?"</p>
<p>Harri swallowed. She was going to get in trouble again, she just knew it. "I don't know, Mr. Sans. I'm sorry." Closing her eyes, she tried to hold back tears.</p>
<p>"no, hey, kiddo- don't cry," Sans said, coming closer and pulling the little girl into a careful hug. She was so small that he was still taller than her. "i'm not mad at you; i'm just confused. it takes someone pretty strong to cast whatever spell brought me here. is there anyone else around?"</p>
<p>Harri shook her head. Sans let out a sharp breath, and leaned back against the tree. He thought about closing his eyes and going to sleep; maybe he would wake up to find that this was just a really weird dream. But then a thought occurred to him. He looked back over at the small girl currently watching him with wide, nervous eyes. "did you summon me?" There shouldn't have been any way a child so young could have summoned him but stranger things had happened.</p>
<p>Shaking her head vehemently, Harri leaned away from Sans. "I'm not strong enough to do anything special."</p>
<p>Sans frowned. That wasn't the sort of attitude a kid should have. "everyone can do special things, kiddo."</p>
<p>"Not me," Harri said with a shrug, looking down.</p>
<p>Gently, Sans reached out and took one of Harri's hands. The glow that enveloped his entire body flared brighter suddenly, lighting up the park in its intensity. "i'd say i have a gut feeling that you're wrong, but i don't have guts."</p>
<p>The light reflected in Harri's eyes. "You mean... I'm doing that?" She didn’t know what the glow meant (neither did Sans, for that matter) but just touching it made Harri feel better.</p>
<p>"yup."</p>
<p>"How?" Harri ran a hand through the light, watching it curl around her like a puppy begging for attention. She looked up at Sans again. "Is it bad?"</p>
<p>"no way. it's super cool." Sans felt his heart ache. Why was such a lively, powerful little girl so unhappy? With a quick gesture, he created a handful of bones, and arranged them into the shape of a floating heart. "see? i can do it too."</p>
<p>Harri's gasp of gleeful astonishment hung in the air. But as she reached out to touch the bones, they began to fade. She looked to Sans. His glow had dimmed as he began to fade too. "Wait! Don't go!"</p>
<p>"sorry, kiddo," he said. "looks like the spell's ending. don't worry- i'll be back when you call."</p>
<p>And with that, he vanished.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Harri curled up in her cupboard. Her uncle's angry words still burned in her ears. Coming home late had resulted in a scalding lecture, and no dinner. For once, though, the shame she felt wasn't the first thing on her mind. Instead, she couldn't stop thinking about the skeleton she had... summoned? Sans.</p>
<p>He had hugged her. And said she could do things. He'd acted like she mattered to him. And now that he was gone, she missed him.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, she tried to figure out how she had made him appear the first time. She had imagined kindness, love, protection. She closed her eyes and focused on those feelings again. Hoping against hope, she pictured Sans appearing again, with his glow and his grin, and his warm, bony hug.</p>
<p>But nobody came.</p>
<p>As she squeezed her eyes closed to hold back tears, she could have shouted with frustration. Sans had promised. He'd said that if she called, he would come. He'd promised.</p>
<p>"hey, kiddo?" said a quiet, quiet voice. "Are you in there?"</p>
<p>Harri spun to the door. A faint blue light shone through the vent. "Sans?" she whispered, desperate not to wake the Durselys.</p>
<p>There was a quiet sound of metal on metal as Sans unlocked the door to the cupboard. "what are you doing in there? who locked you in?" His eyes were absolutely black, without any of the playful light in his pupils.</p>
<p>"It's my room," Harri explained. "I have to stay inside until Aunt Petunia lets me out. I came home too late."</p>
<p>There was a long still silence as Sans processed her words. "move over, then. i think there's enough room for both of us."</p>
<p>Harri moved to the side, and Sans squeezed into the small space beside her. She watched as he examined the cupboard, a frown growing on his face. "Is something wrong?" Harri asked.</p>
<p>Sans' eyes dimmed. "this isn't a proper room for a kid," he said. He couldn't stop his confusion and frustration from seeping into his voice. "it's so small. and where are your toys?" Comparing her room to Papyrus' was inevitable. He thought of his little brother's display of action figures, his racecar-shaped bed, the bookshelves from which Papyrus could pick out his bedtime story.  The bed alone was larger than Harri's tiny cupboard.</p>
<p>Harri, meanwhile, was thinking about Dudley. Sans' genuine concern sparked a forbidden thought. Dudley had two bedrooms, and more toys than he ever played with. She wondered what it was, exactly, that made her unworthy of such things. Her  uncle called her a freak, but what was it precisely that set her apart from them?</p>
<p>"Sans?" she said.</p>
<p>He mussed her hair. "yeah?"</p>
<p>"How did I summon you?"</p>
<p>"oof, big question." Sans leaned back, resting against the wall. "short answer? magic. but i don't know exactly how you did it. if you'd like, i can ask some of my friends. it'll be some work, and i'm not usually up for that, but i wouldn't mind spell-ping you."</p>
<p>Harri laughed, a quiet sound. "That's a terrible joke!" As Sans laughed too, a thought came to her mind. "So then... you can do magic too? And your friends?"</p>
<p>"yup. everyone I know can do magic, because we're monsters. it's rarer for a human to be able to use it." He gave her a real smile. "you're pretty special, kiddo."</p>
<p>"Magic isn't bad, then?" Harri grew nervous, looking down at her hands. "It doesn't make me a freak?"</p>
<p>Someone was in for a bad time. Sans was absolutely sure of that. But right now, he needed to be comforting Harri, even if he'd rather be blowing whoever had made her sad into dust. "you're not a freak. you're a mage, harri. and mages are special." He made a decision, suddenly. "tell you what. you summon me again during the day, and i'll teach you how to use your magic so that you can do some of the things i can."</p>
<p>Harri's eyes practically glowed with joy. "You will?"</p>
<p>"yeah, of course." Sans yawned. "but first, i need some sleep.” Gently, he poked her nose. “and so do you. i guess it’s time for you to send me home."</p>
<p>"How do I do that?" Harri asked reluctantly.</p>
<p>Sans hesitated. Harri made a good point. Sans didn’t actually know how her magic worked, only that it was very different than a monster’s magic. The first time, the accidental nature of the spell had meant that it faded away on its own, but this more intentional spell was going to be a bit trickier. Intent mattered to magic.</p>
<p>And that gave him an idea.</p>
<p>“try focusing on the spell,” Sans suggested, “and then, uh… turning it off?”</p>
<p>Harri laughed. “Like a light?” Sans was sure she meant it as a joke, but it was actually a fairly effective analogy.</p>
<p>“exactly. you got this.” Harri’s eyes lit up at the encouragement, and she furrowed her brow in concentration. The silvery glow around Sans flared, and then began to dim. “just like that!” he said, as he began to fade. “you’re a natural.”</p>
<p>The last thing he saw before the scenery around him blurred, and then changed completely, was Harri’s huge smile, and he felt guilt rise up in his chest.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Sans couldn't support Harri and Papyrus at the same time.</p>
<p>He could take care of both of them, but it meant jumping between them. Kids deserved to have protectors all the time, not someone who had to magically split his time between them and another. He'd figured out that when Harri summoned him, his body simply fell asleep in the underground- which raised some really interesting questions about what that spell actually was- which meant that he was still somewhat present to papyrus while he was with Harri. She had no such comfort.</p>
<p>The picture he had been able to paint of Harri's home life was a dark one. And it made him angry, but more than that, he was furiously guilty. He couldn't fix it. He would take her to the Underground if he could, and yet he knew that it would be even more dangerous for her than her current home. She was human, and with only one soul more needed to break the Barrier, it was too dangerous for him to even consider smuggling her in.</p>
<p>But that didn't mean he could leave her defenseless. He was going to teach her magic, he had decided, and make sure that she was powerful enough that no one, whether they were her odious family or Asgore, would be able to hurt her. He might not be the best teacher, but she was powerful. It would be enough. It had to be, if only to soothe the pain eating away inside him.</p>
<p>The front door crashed open. "SANS!" his brother shouted, forcing Sans' mind away from his dilemma. "I HAVE RETURNED FROM UNDYNE'S HOUSE! ARE YOU AWAKE?"</p>
<p>"oh, hey bro," Sans said, leaning on the arm of the couch. "how was your playdate?"</p>
<p>"IT WAS NO SUCH THING!" Papyrus said indignantly. "IT WAS A TRAINING SESSION! UNDYNE IS A ROYAL GUARD, AND SHE'S TEACHING EVERYTHING SHE KNOWS."</p>
<p>"cool. what did she teach you today?" Sans didn't know how he felt about Papyrus joining the guard. It was his brother's biggest dream, but it could also be dangerous. Not usually, but things always became.... interesting when a human fell into the underground. That hadn't happened since Sans was a small child, but he remembered it clearly.</p>
<p>"HOW TO MAKE SPAGHETTI!" Papyrus said. Sans tried not to let his relief show. It seemed that Undyne felt the same way about Papyrus that he did. "IT IS AN IMPORTANT WARRIOR'S SKILL."</p>
<p>"you'll have to-mato me some for dinner,” Sans said. As Papyrus wailed, Sans stood up and stretched, chuckling at his brother’s expense. “what? is that such an im-pasta-ble request?”</p>
<p>Continuing to make (increasingly worse) puns while his brother complained, Sans came to a decision. It wasn’t possible to take care of Papyrus and Harri at the same time, but he was going to do it anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, this was going to be interesting.</p>
