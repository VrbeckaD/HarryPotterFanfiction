          <div class="userstuff"><p>Voldemort was about to enter the Potter Household when a figure crashed upon him at random and killed him immediately. It was a instant death for the man. Died right on impact. There was no hidden horcrux. Just a sad, small man in a dark cloak laid dead at the doorstep of the Potter household. James loomed over at the unexpected crasher adjusting his glasses. </p><p>He watched as the visitor jumped to their feet and shrieked then run off in horror of who had cushioned their fall. </p><p>James didn’t know what to think except:</p><p>
  <em>I could have died tonight.</em>
</p><p>All as he relaxed and lowered his wand at the crushed figure of Voldemort.</p><p>“Lily!” James called. “The war is over! He is dead!”</p><p>Lily joined his side carrying Harry and lowered her wand, once she saw the man was still, falling relieved. </p><p>“Thank Merlin.” Lily said. </p><p>James looked toward Harry and smiled. </p><p>“Who gets to grow up with their parents and godparents?” James cooed. “Who? Who? Whooooo?”</p><p>Harry looked around, confused, blinking.</p><p>“You, Harry.” Lily said with a grin. </p><p>James tickled the baby earning precious pearls of laughter then the small family went inside the manor and closed the door behind them.</p><p>All was well and the unexpected crasher never popped up in their lives again.</p></div>
