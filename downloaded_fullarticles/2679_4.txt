    <p>He was 40 minutes early for the train.</p><p>It happened every year - Sirius, anxious to leave, arriving earlier and earlier as the summers grew worse and worse.</p><p>He walks now, one hand jammed in the deep pockets of his ribs, the other lugging the heavy oak trunk behind him. He knew that behind him, Walburga was laughing, likely levitating Regulus’ trunk, but Sirius doesn’t particularly care as he stalks down the platform. The lines on his back ache, his teeth carving divots into his lip, and Sirius stifles a groan as he steps onto the train. He doesn’t bother to turn around, to say goodbye to his mother, doesn’t bother to even acknowledge her existence as he boards the train, the doors hissing shut behind him.</p><p>He walks down the corridor, each step coming faster and faster, each breath easier and easier, as he flings open the door of the second-last compartment and stumbles in. He lets the trunk fall with a bang, shoving it undeneath him, before collapsing onto the closest chairs.</p><p>He’s shaking, trembling really, blood filling his mouth from his torn lip, as he stares blindly ahead of him. The summer had been hard, worse then last year. His mother was more drunk, his father more angry, curses and lashes and pain and fear. Nights of torture blending into days, the walls echoing with his stifled screams.</p><p>Sirius grits his teeth, pressing his forehead into his knees, hugging himself tighter. He can feel the arm of the chair digging into his back, rubbing against the cuts there, but he ignores it, closing his eyes. The darkness beckons, solitude and silence, and Sirius presses himself tighter against it.</p><p>He remembers the nightmare, the same one. Every night, every time he closed his eyes: Regulus, scars from Crucio on his back, James, with his broken fingers and snapped legs. Peter, slowly choking to death, Lily, unconscious on the ground and -</p><p>It was always this, the one that broke him. Remus, slumped against the wall, silver chains covering him, the sounds of his harsh breathing filling the room.</p><p>Remus. Against his legs, Sirius mouths his name. It always seemed to be him. That whole summer, when his bones were snapping and his skin was burning and all he could do was try not to scream, the only thing that got him through was Remus.</p><p>There were other dreams too, ones where Remus was laughing, his hair mused and messy, light filling his eyes as Sirius held him. Dreams where they were together, Walburga a distant stain, where they were free to love, to smile, to be happy.</p><p>But those dreams always seemed to vanish, disappearing into the darkness of reality.</p><p>Dimly, Sirius feels a hand, warm through his robes, and he glances up.</p><p>“Hey. Alright?”</p><p>Sirius nods, folding his legs underneath him as James sits next to him. “Yeah. Great.”</p><p>“Bullshit.” Sirius rolls his eyes, as James frowns. He had gotten taller over the summer, more tanned, hair longer and messier as James leans back in the chair. “Come on, mate. You honestly look horrible.”</p><p>He’s too tired to argue back, raising an eyebrow at James instead. “The hell I do.”</p><p>James shakes his head. “Look buddy. You’re so pale - have you even stepped outside all summer? You’ve got that hollow look in your eye, you’re obviously exhausted and you’re so damn skinny.”</p><p>Sirius sighs. “Stop fussing.”</p><p>With a curse, James’ hand shoots forwards, grabbing Sirius’ wrist so hard, it hurts. He shoves the sleeve up, baring the forearm.</p><p>Sirius stares down, the pale skin and the scars that shot across it. When he looks up, James’ face is set.</p><p>“She’s hurting you again, isn’t she?”</p><p>Sirius lets out a dark laugh. “When has she ever stopped?”</p><p>James drops Sirius’ arm, his fingers drumming a rapid beat against the glass. The sound is repetitive, echoing in Sirius’ skull, as James swears. “Shit, Pads. Shit. She can’t do this to you. Like… that’s just screwed up.”</p><p>Sirius shakes his head. “What am I supposed to do, Prongs? Shove my wand up her - “</p><p>“You could run.” James’ voice is steady, his eyes dark. “Pack a trunk, and get out. My parents would take you in, I know they would, and we could help you until you turn 17.”</p><p>Sirius closes his eyes. “I can’t.”</p><p>“Why not - “</p><p>“Because!” He sighs. “Look, James. Think. I’m the only one between Reg and my parents. If I leave - “</p><p>James’ fingers still on the window. “They hurt Regulus.”</p><p>Sirius exhales. “Yeah.” He pauses. “Look. Better me then him.”</p><p>There is a silence, stretching out, before James next speaks. “Goddamn it.” He kicks out, the chair in front of him groaning as he rakes his hands through his hair. “God-fucking-damn it.”</p><p>Sirius shrugs. “It’s fine. I’m used to it.”</p><p>James shakes his head. “No one should be used to getting a goddamn unforgivable curse out on them.”</p><p>“Remus goes through worse. Every fucking full moon.” The words spill out before he can stop himself, tumbling together like waves.</p><p>James exhales. “I know. I goddamn know.”</p><p>He’s biting on his lip, copper in his mouth, as Sirius swallows. The blood slides down his throat, the skin on his lip ragged, and Sirius takes a breath. “I need to tell you something.”</p><p>James scoffs, digging around in his chest. “Yeah?”</p><p>“I think I’m in love with Remus.”</p><p>James whips his head up, disbelief on his face. “What?”</p><p>Sirius swallows. “I think I am in love with Remus.”</p><p>“Holy - “ James rakes his hands through his hair, one hand fiddling with his sleeve. “Like…love love?”</p><p>Sirius rolls his eyes. “No, like hate love. What the fuck, Prongs, of course love love. Jesus Christ.”</p><p>James nods slowly. “Wait, don’t get me wrong, I support you, and I’m honored you told me. But Remus?”</p><p>“Why? What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Nothing. I just thought…” James shrugs. “I don’t know, I never thought you would go for Remus.”</p><p>“Who would I go for then?”</p><p>James shakes his head. “I dunno. Severus?”</p><p>Sirius flips him off, smacking him with his wand. “Shut up! Piece of shit.”</p><p>“What’s wrong with Severus? All dark and sullen and brooding - “</p><p>“If you’re so fascinated with him, why not shag him?”</p><p>And they are laughing, laughing so hard, that Sirius almost misses the soft snick of the door being closed. He stops smiling, leaping forward to see Regulus’ face in the narrow window, having heard every bit of their conversation.</p>
