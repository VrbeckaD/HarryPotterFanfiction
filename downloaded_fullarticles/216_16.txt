    <p>The rumbling on the tracks, although no different in reality, resonated differently this time. Loud enough to notice to the average person, but for Harry, swirling in his thoughts and numbing them simultaneously. The foliage of the countryside flew past his window in a whirlwind of green, yet he didn’t really see it. It only reminded him of their screams…</p><p> </p><p>“Harry?” His gaze focused on Hermione across from him, her eyes boring into his.</p><p> </p><p>“Er—what?”</p><p> </p><p>She smiled softly, pulled her wand and let the shutter on the window fall closed. The green blur disappeared. “Better?”</p><p> </p><p>He nodded, staring at the thin cloth shielding him from his thoughts. Ron cleared his throat and tore his eyes away. “Do you want anything from the trolley, mate? It’ll be by any minute.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry shook his head to clear his thoughts, then scooted one seat over from the window. “Yeah, actually. I think I’ll have a chocolate frog.”</p><p> </p><p>Ron grinned. “I could always go for a chocolate frog.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione didn’t glance up from the book she had her nose buried in. “You could always go for any type of food, Ron.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not true! I can’t stand those bogey flavoured beans…”</p><p> </p><p>Harry snorted. “Can anyone? Does <em>anyone </em>actually like those?”</p><p> </p><p>“No… I s’pose not.”</p><p> </p><p>The three are silent for a few moments, each caught up in their own thoughts, or, book. Harry fiddled with his wand between his fingers, the scar on his right hand catching the light. He glanced away from it to the untied lace on his shoe. Hauling his leg up onto the seat he slung one into a loop and tied it. “It’s weird, isn’t it? Coming back here? After everything… and it’s supposed to just go back to normal? I mean… nothing feels normal. I certainly don’t. This train ride doesn’t… how is this school year supposed to?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione glanced up at him as he let his leg land back on the floor. “Maybe that’s the point. McGonagall invited us back as the first ever eighth years to finish our education… and if I’m right there’s thirty-three of us returning. Some of us have been injured, some scarred, others traumatized. It’s not <em>supposed </em>to be the same.”</p><p> </p><p>Ron looked between Harry and Hermione. “Wait… there’s only seven dormitories. Where are we supposed to sleep? On the floor?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione laughed. “You’re just thinking about this now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, yeah! I was kind of caught up in other thoughts this summer, and was excited just to go back…”</p><p> </p><p>Harry furrowed his brows. “You think they’ll make another dorm? For the first years? Because every year we’ve had the same dorm.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not sure,” said Hermione. “But I’m sure they’ve thought of something.”</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>The Great Hall looked just as magnificent as it had before the Battle of Hogwarts. The windows had been repaired, the ceiling as well, and the tables stood in exactly the same places as they had when Harry had last seen them on a normal school day. Although, despite its beauty, he couldn’t stop himself from tensing when he walked in. Many of the eighth years did as they entered together… all remembering the scene they had left behind the previous year. The bodies strewn on the ground, the yelling, the screaming, the blood and jets of light flying past your head… barely allowing you another day. Of course they all remembered that… who could forget?</p><p> </p><p>They joined their peers at their house tables silently, sliding along the wooden benches to their desired places. Although the school was open, the Hall seemed incredibly empty. There were less students than there had previously been… Harry glanced down the table at the spot where he normally would’ve seen Colin Creevey, his camera lens glinting. The table of Hogwarts staff where he should’ve seen the scowling face of Severus Snape… And, the vacant space at the Slytherin table that belonged to Vincent Crabbe. He could still hear the boy’s scream as he fell into the fire, the look on Malfoy’s face as he watched his friend disappear, and they way that he had gripped Harry as they’d flown out of the inferno— from one monster into another.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy was sitting at the Slytherin table with the other Slytherins who had chosen to return. Among them were Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Goyle, Daphne Greengrass, Theodore Nott, Millicent Bullstrode, and Tracey Davis. It seemed to Harry as though the only Slytherin in his year whom had not returned was the one who couldn’t. His gaze strayed to the slumped figure of Malfoy. The boy who had grown up as his rival, yet during the war had turned around and saved Harry’s life. Of course, Harry had done the same in turn… but where that left them, he wasn’t sure.</p><p> </p><p>Professor McGonagall cleared her voice at the front of the room, causing every head to turn in her direction. She stared out at the faces before her, smiling warmly at her students who had decided to return this year, all eight years of witches and wizards. “The sorting ceremony will now commence! Professor Sprout will bring in the first year students momentarily. As it is our first year post-war, some may be frightened. Many of you, I’m sure, were not convinced about returning this year yourselves. Please make them feel welcome. Treat them well, and each other well, also. That is all.”</p><p> </p><p>The doors of the Great Hall swung open revealing the familiar face of the students’ Herbology professor, who led a group of about thirty students into the hall. The upper-year students all cheered, shouting their welcomes to the shy eleven-year-olds walking past. Their eyes moved sky-wards to the enchanted ceilings, roamed over the long tables and the smiling faces of students. Some smiled, some bit their lips… others looked downright terrified.</p><p> </p><p>The group stopped in front of a stool at the front, where the Sorting Hat, battered but intact, perched. Professor Sprout took her seat at the staff table, and McGonagall held up a piece of parchment.</p><p> </p><p>“Argeynt, Alice!”</p><p> </p><p>A slim, sandy-haired girl stepped out from the crowd. She turned, sat on the stool, cheeks flushed pink as the hat was lowered onto her head. The whole school paused as the Sorting Hat thought to itself and muttered to Alice, and then… “Slytherin!”</p><p> </p><p>Eyes at the Slytherin table went wide as they stared at the sweet looking girl in front of them. Of course, many of them remembered being so young an innocent, it was only that none of them felt that way anymore. Alice blinked at them, confusion evident on her face. She didn’t quite realize what was going through the heads of her peers… the first student sorted right after the war, the war started by Slytherin supremacists, and not fought against by many Slytherin students, was one of them. However, unlike past years, there was no booing. Only stunned silence.</p><p> </p><p>Clearly, the other three tables noticed this hesitation, because soon all three tables were clapping and cheering. The staff joined in, followed, half-heartedly, by the Slytherin students.</p><p> </p><p>Harry watched Alice move to her seat as the next student was sorted. Alice walked along the table, staring at the students at her table who were either shocked or horrified. She caught Malfoy’s harrowed, icy eyes as she approached where the prefects sat. She stopped momentarily and watched his unmoving stare. Suddenly, he tore his eyes away and stared at the table. Alice watched him warily as she sat across from Pansy, who instead gave her a smile and introduced herself and Draco.</p><p> </p><p>“Chang, Jadzia!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s attention shifted entirely to the front of the room. The young girl who sat on the stool looked exactly like the young version of Cho Chang that Harry could remember. He pursed his lips, nodding to himself.</p><p> </p><p>“Ravenclaw!”</p><p>Of course she’d be a Ravenclaw. Just like her older sister.</p><p> </p><p>“Dangen, Norm!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hufflepuff!”</p><p> </p><p>The Hufflepuff tabled cheered as their, apparently, second student of the sorting joined their table. Harry had missed the first, and apparently another Ravenclaw as well.</p><p> </p><p>“Flynn, Ned!”</p><p> </p><p>A scrawny boy with mousy hair clambered onto the stool. He stared into the crowd for a second, then closed his dark eyes tightly. The hat paused, muttering to the boy, who shrugged. “Gryffindor!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor table cheered as Ned beamed, hopped off the stool, and strode down the aisle to where the prefects at the table sat. Ned slid onto the bench beside Hermione, staring at Harry. Harry smiled at the young boy. </p><p> </p><p>Hermione turned to him, hand outstretched. “Hi, Ned. I’m Hermione—”</p><p> </p><p>“I know who you are,” Ned whispered. “Hermione Granger. That’s Ron Weasley, and he’s Harry Potter. Everyone knows who you are…”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione nodded, sighing as she looked across at Ron, who sat beside Harry. Ron coughed. “You know our names and what we’ve done, maybe… but that doesn’t go for everyone here.”</p><p> </p><p>Ned glanced up at Ron. “A lot of us do. Well, at least, the one’s who grew up as wizards or have older siblings. I don’t mean to sound rude… it’s just intimidating. Being a Gryffindor. I don’t know if I can hold up what you guys have left for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s heart clenched just as another cheer erupted from the other Gryffindors. Lafayette, Faith, was just sorted into Gryffindor. A darker skinned girl bounced over towards them, brown hair bouncing on her shoulders. She slid in beside Ned, looking at the three eighth years. “What were you guys talking about?”</p><p> </p><p>Ron jumped in before Ned could pick up where he left off. “About how much you first-years know about the older students here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah,” she said, smiling at the bunch. “We know a lot. Is that what you were telling them, er…”</p><p> </p><p>“Ned.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ned, got it. I’m Faith.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hello. I was saying that we all know who they are, and a lot of the others, too.”</p><p> </p><p>Faith turned to Harry. “He’s right. I know that you three saved the Wizarding World. That’s Neville Longbottom over there… he killed the bird!”</p><p> </p><p>“Snake.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right… sorry. That’s Luna Lovegood, at Ravenclaw, right? I know she was part of that group you all formed a few years ago!”</p><p> </p><p>Ned smiled at her, then turned to look behind him at other students. “And that’s Draco Malfoy. None of us want to mess with him, we were all saying that outside. He’s evil.”</p><p> </p><p>“How did he not end up in jail?” Faith whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“Beats me,” spat Ned. “He should’ve been sent to Azkaban. A lot of this is his fault, he would’ve deserved it.”</p><p> </p><p>Ron hid a snort with a cough as Harry spoke up. “I wouldn’t say that about him.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why?” Faith asked.</p><p> </p><p>Harry glanced passed them to the blond who sat with his eyes downcast, trying to sink into the floor. He looked back at the two first-years, but Hermione had started for him. “He saved our lives from Voldemort,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>They turned to Harry again. Ned spoke. “But we thought you hated him.”</p><p> </p><p>“We were rivals, that doesn’t mean I hate him. I don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then are you friends?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Harry said. “We aren’t friends either. I just don’t hate him.”</p><p> </p><p>Faith opened her mouth to object as McGonagall’s voice filled the room. “Good evening everyone, and welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few announcements before we begin the feast. First off, I would like to welcome back our eighth years. They are students who’s final year was interrupted during the Wizarding War, and have been invited back to finish their NEWTs. Please treat them as you would any other student.</p><p> </p><p>“Secondly, I would like to introduce our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Spunks! He has gladly accepted the position and is excited to teach you all this year. Treat him well.</p><p> </p><p>“Thirdly, because of the events of last year I feel it very pressing that I comment on this. The war was fought bravely, and although there were tragic casualties, the students that you see in this room were all very brave and valiant. All of you deserve to be here. Please respect each other. No house is better, nor worse than another… and neither is any student. Work together, support each other… you have all seen some horrible things. The staff have been trained to help you deal with your trauma, and we would like you to know that there is always someone here to help you.</p><p> </p><p>“To my first years, we all welcome you with open arms. If you do not know me already, I am Headmistress McGonagall, as well as the Transfiguration Professor. This school is your new home, and your peers, your family. The staff are here to support you as you develop into wonderful young people and perfect your magical abilities. Enjoy your time here, seven years will have gone by before you know it.</p><p> </p><p>“As always, no one is to go into the Forbidden Forest. It is still off limits, as it the Restricted Section of the library, unless you have a signed note from a teacher.</p><p> </p><p>“And lastly, to my eighth years, once again. I ask you to please stay behind after the feast has ended. I will be leading you up to your new dormitory, as we do not have room for another dorm in your old ones. The staff and I have worked incredibly hard on it, so we sincerely hope it is to your tastes. And with that, let the feast begin!”</p><p> </p><p>
