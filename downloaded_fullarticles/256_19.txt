    <p>Neville didn’t fully comprehend the tragedy of his parents. Before he learned the truth, every time his grandmother would scold him in that stern voice of hers; every time he visited them only to see blank faces, he felt an immense frustration. It filled his chest and his head and found its place in the backs of his eyes. He never left St. Mungo’s without tears on his cheeks. He simply didn’t <em>understand.</em></p><p><em>Especially</em> after what happened when he visited the summer before his third year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry</p><p>That August evening, Neville’s grandmother sat him down to talk</p><p>“Neville, do you know why your parents cannot take care of you?”</p><p>Neville shook his head.</p><p>“There are three people in Azkaban right now that are serving time for torturing your parents to insanity.”</p><p>It would take days for the horror of what his grandmother just told him to properly settle into his mind. But, for now, all he knew was that there were <em>people</em> responsible for his parents’ incapacitation. Living human beings.</p><p>Gran continued. “Their names are Bellatrix Lestrange, Rodolphus Lestrange, and Rabastan Lestrange. One of them, Bartemius Crouch Jr., died. But he is no less guilty. Memorize those names, boy. Never forget. Be proud of what your parents sacrificed.”</p><p>She repeated them many times after this. No matter how forgetful Neville was, he would never forget those four names.</p>
<hr/><p>Neville Longbottom was boarding the Hogwarts Express for his third year of wizarding school. He had his toad, Trevor; if there was anything he would never misplace after his first year at Hogwarts, it was Trevor.</p><p>He hugged his grandmother; she kissed his forehead. In parting, she told him, “Remember your parents. Now that Sirius Black is out,” Neville felt a pang of anxiety at the name, “now, more than ever, you need to know how to protect yourself.”</p><p>He nodded dully. Ever since the Azkaban break-out, Gran’s words from weeks ago about his parents clung insistently to his brain.</p><p>Neville boarded the train soon after, Trevor’s cage in hand. He shared a compartment with Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, as he had done the previous two years. As Neville entered the compartment, Seamus was already ranting to Dean about football. Neville had actually been to Seamus’s house, along with Dean, over the summer to watch a game. It was fun, but only in a sense that he got to spend some time with good friends. The game itself was just a less exciting version of Quidditch.</p><p>Seamus heard the door open and immediately asked, “Neville! Did you keep up with the National Competition after we met up?”</p><p>Neville looked at Seamus. “No, I don’t really have a television to watch it on. I asked my gran about it once, but she didn’t want to go to a Muggle store.”</p><p>“Shame,” he replied absentmindedly.</p><p>Neville walked inside, intending to sit opposite of Seamus and Dean, when the train suddenly lurched forward, causing his leg to hit the edge of the bench painfully. He yelped. Neither of his compartment mates said anything.</p><p>Neville clung to Dean and Seamus, at first, out of necessity. Since he had no previous friends to speak of, Neville had walked on to the Hogwarts Express his first year to the first compartment with an empty seat. Hermione Granger, Dean, and Seamus were all in there, talking excitedly about what was going to happen when they got to Hogwarts. Over that first year, Neville spent a lot of time with Dean and Seamus, since they all lived in the same dormitories. Hermione Granger, eventually, joined Harry Potter and Ron Weasley to form their own friendships.</p><p>Neville was grateful for <em>any</em> friends, to be honest. He had never made a proper friendship for the first eleven years of his life. When Dean and Seamus slowly began talking to him more and more, Neville felt ecstatic. He was able to at least tell <em>someone</em> about how his parents were in the hospital, for reasons he did not yet know…</p><p>Neville spent the rest of the train ride looking out the window, thinking about his parents and Sirius Black and <em>them.</em></p><p>
  <em>Bellatrix Lestrange, Rodolphus Lestrange, Rabastan Lestrange, Bartemius Crouch Jr.</em>
</p><p>If Black could get out, surely <em>they</em> could escape too…</p><p>Gran had informed him that the last one, Bartemius Crouch Jr., had died shortly after being imprisoned. She also made it clear that the other three were very much alive and in Azkaban.</p><p>Which, to Neville’s shock and horror, was a lot less secure than he once thought.</p><p>Neville could see the beginnings of a storm in the distant sky when the food cart stopped by the compartment. He wasn’t really in the mood for sweets, but he bought a Chocolate Frog anyways, because they always traded cards on the way to Hogwarts.</p><p>“Does anyone want my frog?”</p><p>Seamus made a near immediate grab for Neville’s frog and, without a second’s thought, bit into the head.</p><p>Neville picked up his card. “I’ve got Morgan le Fay.”</p><p>“Sweet!” said Dean. “I need that one, could I trade it for a Merlin?”</p><p>“Come on, Dean, everyone’s got Merlin,” Seamus said exasperatedly.</p><p>“It’s fine, Dean,” said Neville, “I’ll just give it to you. I don’t need Morgan or Merlin.”</p><p>Seamus looked at his card. “I’ve got Dippet! No way I’m trading this.”</p><p>As the Dean and Seamus began arguing amongst themselves, a familiar blonde head popped into the compartment.</p><p>"Hey, Longbottom. Have fun this summer? I assume you spend it in St. Mungo's, of course. Not the best of company, you get there, huh?"</p><p>Neville felt a horrid lurch in his stomach. He didn’t like hearing or thinking about St. Mungo’s.</p><p>Seamus made an immediate grab for his wand. "Go away, Malfoy."</p><p>Malfoy ignored him. "Have you told these two? Or are you too ashamed?”</p><p>"I'm warning you, Malfoy." Seamus lifted his wand to Malfoy's chest.</p><p>"Okay, but if you don’t tell them, I will!" Malfoy made a quick exit before Seamus made good on his threat.</p><p>The mood in the compartment had immediately darkened. Neville wasn’t sure he wanted to explain exactly <em>why</em> his parents were in the hospital, what with the knowledge being so fresh in his mind, wreaking havoc on his emotions.</p><p>As the train moved along, the view outside was quickly becoming a flat sheet of gray. Neville remained entranced by the droplets racing on the window, and he refused to let himself think about his parents or Sirius Black or <em>them</em>. He thought of rain, nature, Herbology. He loved Herbology. He couldn’t wait to go back to the class and talk to Professor Sprout and to visit Dogweed and Deathcap in Hogsmeade.</p><p>Neville’s Herbology-themed trance was interrupted by a sudden lurch that indicated that the train was slowing down.</p><p> “There’s no way we’re there yet,” said Dean, who was looking at his watch.</p><p>The lamps suddenly extinguished, causing Neville to flinch horribly. He was always easily startled by stupid things.</p><p>Seamus stuck his head out of the compartment just as the train jolted to a stop, causing someone’s luggage to fall and the door to close on Seamus’s shoulder.</p><p>“Ouch – OK, so Harry is in the compartment next to us, so we can ask them if they know what’s going on.”</p><p>Neville found himself getting out, asking what direction he needed to go (“Left!”) and stumbling that way, his anxiety starting to build. He opened the compartment door and immediately fell forward as he tried to step in.</p><p>“Sorry -- d’you know what’s going on? — Ouch -- sorry—”</p><p>“Hullo, Neville,” he heard Harry’s voice say.</p><p>Neville felt himself being pulled up by his cloak.</p><p>“Harry? Is that you? Do you know what’s happening?”</p><p>“No idea — sit down — "</p><p>As he tried to sit down, he realized too late that what he was trying to sit on was much too lumpy. And sharp. And it made a hissing noise.</p><p>“Ah! Oops!”</p><p>He didn’t think his heart could take another scare.</p><p>“I’m going to go and ask the driver what’s going on," said someone that sounded a lot like Hermione.</p><p>The door opened again and there was a thud, paired with twin yelps.</p><p>“Who’s that?”</p><p>“Who’s <em>that</em>?”</p><p>“Ginny?”</p><p>“Hermione?”</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>“I was looking for Ron—”</p><p>“Come in and sit down—”</p><p>Across from Neville, Harry said “Not here! <em>I’m </em>here!”</p><p>He felt his toes being stepped on (“Ouch!”) when a voice Neville didn’t recognize said, “Quiet!”</p><p>There was a crackling noise as light began to fill the compartment. Neville could suddenly see the tired face of the unknown man.</p><p>“Stay where you are,” He said, his voice distinctly hoarse. The man tried to get to the door, but something outside got to it first.</p><p>In the door was a dark cloaked figure. Neville had a feeling he knew what it was. The figure stuck it's hand out of its cloak; it looked slimy and rotten.</p><p>The creature drew a breath, and, in an instant, Neville knew he was right about the creature. Neville felt cold wash over him, and he was overwhelmed with a distinct feeling that nothing would ever be able to warm him. Before he knew it, he was drowning, his eyes closed, he wasn’t going to live any longer…</p><p>
  <em>His mom was screaming and writhing in her hospital bed. He had only come to visit, and she had suddenly begun convulsing, and screaming. He would never get that scream out of his head…</em>
</p><p>“Harry!”</p><p>“Neville!”</p><p>Someone was shaking his shoulders. When he opened his eyes, he could see Ginny and Hermione above him. He felt like his muscles would never move again.</p><p>Hermione and Ginny helped him back into his seat across from Harry. The unknown man and Ron were helping Harry do just the same. The train was moving again, and the lanterns were on.</p><p>“Are you two okay?” asked the unknown man.</p><p>Neville looked at him. “I guess—who are you?”</p><p>“Remus Lupin, I’m your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”</p><p>“Professor,” Harry cut in, “What happened? Where’s that—that thing? Who screamed?”</p><p>Neville felt even more weak at Harry’s words. <em>What did he see?</em></p><p>Ron squirmed nervously. “No one screamed.”</p><p>“But I heard screaming—”</p><p>Lupin began snapping apart a chocolate bar, scaring everyone but Neville, who had been watching the man.</p><p>“Here,” Lupin said, giving both Neville and Harry large pieces of the chocolate. “Eat it. It’ll help.”</p><p>Neville took his and ate it right away, trusting that Lupin was telling the truth. The chocolate warmed him from the inside out. It felt unlike any Warming Charm he had ever experienced. Neville figured that such a charm wouldn’t work on the kind of cold he had felt from the dementor.</p><p>Harry, without eating his chocolate, asked, “What was that thing?”</p><p>Lupin was giving chocolate to the other passengers. Neville knew the answer to Harry’s question, but the professor beat him to it.</p><p>“A dementor,” he said. “One of the dementors of Azkaban.”</p><p>Lupin turned back around to Harry. “Eat. It’ll help. I need to speak with the driver, excuse me…”</p><p>“Are you sure you two are okay?” Hermione asked anxiously.</p><p>“I don’t get it… what happened?</p><p>Neville’s grandmother had taught him all about Azkaban when Sirius Black broke out. His voice returned to him. “Dementors. They’re the guards of Azkaban. They’re very Dark creatures…”</p><p>Everyone in the compartment stared at him.</p><p>Neville shrugged. “That's what my gran told me, at least.”</p><p>Ron continued explaining what happened. “When you two passed out, you both went rigid and started twitching, like you were having some kind of fit—”</p><p>“And Professor Lupin stepped over you two and walked toward the dementor,” Hermione explained. “He pulled out his wand and said ‘None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.’ But the dementor didn’t move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it, and it turned around and sort of glided away.”</p><p>“Was it just me and Neville who passed out?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Yes,” said Hermione.</p><p>Neville averted his eyes, feeling something horrible in his stomach at the thought that he had passed out just because the dementor had been in the room. He quickly stood and addressed the cabin. “I guess I better get back to Dean and Seamus before they start worrying too much.”</p><p>Lupin was just outside the door as he was heading back to Seamus and Dean.</p><p>“Hey, are you okay? Did you eat all your chocolate?” Lupin asked, seeming fussy and worried.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, I just thought I’d get back to my compartment,” Neville said, anxious to avoid further questioning.</p><p>“May I ask, what’s your name?”</p><p>“Neville.”</p><p>A short pause.</p><p>“Well, Neville, I’m sorry to meet you in such an instance, but pleased to meet you all the same. I’m sure we’ll be seeing more of each other throughout the year.” Lupin gave Neville a tight smile and made for Harry’s compartment.</p><p>As Neville opened the door to his own compartment, he was immediately bombed with questions from Seamus.</p><p>“What took you so long? I saw that thing pass by our door. What the heck was that?”</p><p>Neville explained as much as he could without mentioning the fact that he and Harry passed out.</p><p>“Man, that’s weird. You say they were looking for Sirius Black? I mean there’s no way he could be on the train…”</p><p>Seamus gave a shrug, seemingly to nobody, and switched topics to Quidditch.</p><p>Neville looked out the window, still a near constant grey. He wondered <em>why</em> he had passed out, and, even more why <em>Harry</em> had passed out. As the train moved along the Scottish wilderness, Neville tried to think of reasons why. He would ask Lupin, since the man seemed pretty knowledgeable on the topic of dementors, but he felt nervous at the idea of approaching the man.</p><p>Eventually, the train pulled in, and Neville silently picked up Trevor’s cage and got out of the train.</p><p>He, Seamus, and Dean got in the same carriage. The horse-like creature that Neville didn’t know the name of let out a long breath and began to pull forward. Neville had always been able to see the creatures, but when he had asked Dean and Seamus if they knew what it was last year, Neville found out that the other two couldn’t see them. He’s wondered since then about the strange, pitch black, sometimes-invisible creatures who led the carriages.</p><p>They slowly approached the school, and Neville took a moment to remember how <em>grand </em>the castle really was. He sometimes wondered why they needed such a big castle when they didn’t even have that many classes available. He wondered a few times if he could get away with trying to explore the castle for little-used corridors or hidden rooms, but he always dismissed the idea, scared of being caught or lost.</p><p>Neville got out of the carriage once it stopped and began ambling into the entrance hall of Hogwarts. He was behind Harry, Ron and Hermione, about to walk into the Great Hall for the Sorting, when--</p><p>“Potter! Granger! Longbottom! I need to see you three.”</p><p>The three kids turned around, surprised. It was Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor House, the house to which Harry, Hermione, and Neville all belonged.</p><p>Neville was immediately nervous. He had a knack for getting himself in trouble for stupid mistakes. He had certainly been reprimanded by McGonagall before, and didn’t want to ever be on the receiving end of that wrath again.</p><p>As the three approached tentatively, she quelled their worries. “There’s no need to look so worried—I just want a word in my office.” She looked at Ron, who had joined his friends; Seamus and Dean had long moved on into the hall already. “Move along there, Weasley.”</p><p>Harry, Hermione, and Neville were guided back across the entrance and up a marble staircase.</p><p>As they entered Professor McGonagall’s office, she motioned for the three to sit down. “Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you two had taken ill on the train,” she said, motioning to Harry and Neville.</p><p>There was a knock on the door and Madam Pomfrey, the school’s nurse, was soon swooping in to care for the two boys.</p><p>Neville didn’t need a mirror to know his face had started turning red, and a glance to the side showed him that Harry was in a similar state. He couldn’t help but feel like there was a bit of an overreaction here.</p><p>“What happened to you two?” Pomfrey asked.</p><p>McGonagall answered, with a dark look on her face. “It was a dementor, Poppy.”</p><p>“Tsk, tsk, tsk.” Madam Pomfrey had been feeling Harry’s forehead and was quickly moving to check Neville’s. “Setting dementors around a school. They won’t be the last ones to collapse. Yes, they’re both clammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they have on people who are already delicate—”</p><p>Harry vehemently denied the idea that he was delicate. Neville, however, just became even more red in the face. He knew he was weak. He thought of what his grandmother would think.</p><p>“What do they need?” McGonagall asked, “Bed rest? A night in the hospital wing?”</p><p>“I’m <em>fine!</em>” Harry exclaimed.</p><p>“I’m doing okay, if you don’t mind,” Neville said timidly. “I think Harry and I will be fine.”</p><p>“Well, you two need chocolate at the very least.” Madam Pomfrey said.</p><p>“We’ve already had some,” Harry cut in. “Professor Lupin gave it to us.”</p><p>“Did he now?" Pomfrey asked approvingly. “So, we’ve finally got a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies?”</p><p>“Are you sure you two will be alright?” McGonagall asked.</p><p>“Yes.” Neville and Harry said in unison.</p><p>“Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Mrs. Granger about her course schedule, then we can go down to the feast together.”</p><p>Harry and Neville looked at each other, confused, and got up, Madam Pomfrey following. She immediately left for the hospital wing, leaving the two boys in awkward silence until Hermione exited the office looking very happy, Professor McGonagall in tow. Neville wondered absently what the professor said that had made Hermione so happy.</p><p>As they walked toward the Great Hall, Professor Flitwick, the wizard who taught Charms, was leaving the hall with a three-legged stool and an old large hat.</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione exclaimed, “we’ve missed the Sorting.”</p><p>Harry and Hermione moved to sit on either side of Ron, while Neville silently made for the opposite side of the table to sit next to Seamus.</p><p>“Hey, where did you go?” he asked.</p><p>“McGonagall. No big deal.”</p><p>Neville had barely finished answering when Dumbledore stood to speak.</p><p>“Welcome…”</p><p>From the moment Dumbledore began speaking, Neville’s mind returned to the –</p><p>“…dementors of Azkaban, who are here on Ministry business…”</p><p>After the incident on the train, Neville couldn’t help but feel uneasy at the idea of dementors staying at Hogwarts year-round.</p><p>
  <em>Besides, won’t that mean less security at Azkaban?</em>
</p><p> “…First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”</p><p>Neville perked up at the name and clapped loudly amongst the mostly unenthusiastic applause.</p><p>“As to our second new appointment… Rubeus Hagrid has agreed to take on Care of Magical Creatures in addition to his gamekeeping duties.”</p><p>Many people, especially at the Gryffindor table, applauded loudly at this announcement.</p><p>“Well I think that’s everything of importance,” said Dumbledore. “Let the feast begin!”</p><p>The table filled with food and drink. Neville wasn’t particularly hungry, but he grabbed some bread to stave off the hunger he knew would come eventually.</p><p>The feast ended after an agonizing two hours. As Neville made his way up to the Gryffindor Common Room, the school’s new Head Boy, Percy Weasley, pushed past him.</p><p>“Coming through, coming through! The new password’s ‘Fortuna Major’!”</p><p>“Oh no,” Neville groaned. He was rotten at remembering passwords.</p><p>Everyone, except Neville, went straight up to their beds. Neville had a feeling that he wouldn’t be able to get to sleep just yet. The gravity of what he experienced on the train was hitting him full force.</p><p>It’s one thing, reliving that particular memory in his dreams. But experiencing it because of the dementor was another thing entirely. It was as though he was there, in the moment, experiencing it for the first time, although <em>now</em> he knew exactly why the memory was so horrible.</p><p>Neville sat in front in front of the fire for a while, staring at the flames, feeling horrible waves of emotion in his chest as he tried not to think about it.</p><p>Trying not to think about it, he soon figured out, was a surefire way to remember <em>exactly</em> what he was trying to forget. He gave up, and slipped into memories of the last time he went to St. Mungo’s, the visit that changed everything…</p><p>
  <em>Going here always made Neville feel slightly sick. It had a specific smell, the kind of smell that was forever associated with horrible memories.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He and Gran went all the way up to the closed ward. It was his first time coming here since Christmas, so he wasn’t so surprised to see new faces in the beds. People came in and out of here every six months or so. A lot of them would simply die, overcome by the condition they were brought in for.</em>
</p><p><em>However, he </em>was<em> surprised by one of the new faces.</em></p><p>
  <em>“Gilderoy, sweetheart, it’s lunchtime.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Neville turned his head as he walked in, only to see the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher from the school year that had just ended. He knew the professor wouldn’t be returning to teach; however, he hadn’t known exactly what happened to the man.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Good afternoon, Mrs. Longbottom,” said Tillie, one of the nurses he recognized from last time. He was surprised; not very many nurses stayed in this ward. It’s a very demanding job, requiring constant awareness.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“They’ve been doing just fine,” Tillie continued. She didn’t say much else, as Gran was already on her way to the curtained off beds in the corner.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Neville followed, carrying the stuffed lion they had bought in Diagon Alley before coming here. His parent’s loved stuffed animals, especially his mother. He was never exactly sure why. They were one of the only things to which his parents responded.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Neville passed by the curtains after his grandmother, and he took a good look at his parents.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Grey, unkempt hair, old and empty faces. Dad was lying down, looking blankly at the ceiling. Mom was sat up a bit with the last stuffed animal he brought, a snowman, in her hands. She rubbed back and forth on the snowman’s belly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Neville walked cautiously up to his mother’s bed. She looked up at him. Her eyes were unknowing. He handed her the lion. She dropped to snowman to grab the lion and it fell on the ground at his feet. He kneeled, picked it up, and brought the snowman to the space between the beds, which was filled with stuffed animals from previous visits.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He looked at the stack and picked up another lion; Neville wasn’t there for the purchase of this one. He put it on his father’s hand, and only then did he move out of his trance. He picked up the lion and began tossing it a little between his hands.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Neville turned back to his mother, and she, surprisingly, looked back. She was almost… seeing.</em>
</p><p><em>And then, horrible screams filled the room. Coming from his mother’s mouth.</em> <em>All he had done was look at her, and she was suddenly writhing in the bed, making horrible noises.</em></p><p>
  <em> The nurses had moved fast, putting up spells to contain the sound to just within two feet of her. Neville soon heard silence again, but he was shocked to his core. He continued to look at his mother, unable to move his eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>This had never happened before.</em>
</p><p>Neville was so sunk into his memories, he failed to notice that none other than Harry Potter himself was travelling down the steps that led to the boy’s dormitories.</p><p>“Hey. I noticed you hadn’t come up.”</p><p>Neville noticed for the first time the wetness on his face. He ducked it, moving quickly to wipe it away.</p><p>“Yeah,” he responded.</p><p>“Not tired?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Same here...”</p><p>Harry sat down in the big fluffy chair next to the sofa on which Neville was sat. Neville hoped that Harry hadn’t seen him crying.</p><p>Harry cleared his throat. “Um, I was wondering, um, if you knew why it was us two who passed out? Why it wasn’t the others?”</p><p>Neville just looked at Harry for a moment, feeling brittle, not trusting his voice to be steady. He couldn’t remain silent, though.</p><p>“I’m – I’m not sure… I was thinking about asking Professor Lupin…”</p><p>Neville moved his eyes back to the fire, though he felt the other boy’s eyes remain locked onto him.</p><p>“Did… you see anything? When you passed out?”</p><p>Neville didn’t respond. He didn’t even shake his head. He felt almost paralyzed by the horrible feeling in his head and chest and throat.</p><p>Harry was quickly flustered from the shock of asking the question. “Ah - I’m sorry – I shouldn’t have asked  – good night.”</p><p>Harry made a quick exit. Neville didn’t exactly feel like following and remained in the chair.</p><p>It’s wasn’t that he didn’t feel proud of his parents, that he didn’t appreciate their sacrifice. He just desperately didn’t want to talk about it. The knowledge of the full truth was still too fresh. Harry Potter had it easy in that aspect. Everyone in the wizarding world was already familiar with his story. One look at his forehead and everyone knew what had happened to his parents. Neville, meanwhile, was still unable to give a proper explanation to most people as to why he was in the care of his grandmother.</p><p>Neville waited a good amount of time to be sure that Harry would be asleep before heading up to the boys’ dormitories. He got ready for bed, but when the time came, it took a while before he could go to sleep. <em>Their</em> names kept repeating in his head.</p><p>
  <em>Bellatrix Lestrange, Rodolphus Lestrange, Rabastan Lestrange, Bartemius Crouch Jr.</em>
