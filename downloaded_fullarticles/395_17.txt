    <p>Remus knew and had always known that things weren’t all well within the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black especially when it came to its eldest heir. The scared and quiet way Sirius slunk around the castle for the first days back from summer vacation every year was a carefully ignored sign of the reality that his friend was living in. But there was some kind of fierce pride that burned inside Sirius still, an aristocratic pretension that he never seemed to make the full effort to try and shake completely. The reality was that cutting ties would be disastrous for Sirius in ways the others could only guess at and that the Black name still opened doors that would have otherwise remained closed.</p><p>“They’re still my parents,” Sirius said one fateful day in the January of their 5th year, only minutes back from the Christmas holiday. They were sitting in the dormitory, Sirius allowing Remus to spread healing ointment on his split lip and bruised cheek with all the goodwill of a cat being forcibly bathed while James paced furiously nearby. </p><p>The low golden light of the dormitory cast shadows beneath Sirius’ tired eyes, the bit-lipped frown of his mouth. The bruises, spreading even now, looked like purple thunderclouds beneath his pale skin. In his distraction, Remus poked a little too hard. Sending Sirius wincing, pulling away from the steadying hand Remus had placed on the back of his neck. He pushed his hair out of his eyes with an unsteady hand. </p><p>“They’re fucking cunts is what,” Said James, bitterly, pulling at his hair in frustration and taking the corner a little too hard, almost crashing into Peter who was sitting on the floor by the furnace “Why I ought’a…”</p><p>“Language, Potter,” Sirius said, tsking in perfect imitation of McGonagall “What would Evans think?” </p><p>“She’d probably be just as murderous as our Jamesy” suggested Peter, then added, quietly to himself, “what a woman, honestly”</p><p>James cast the stinging jinx, sending Peter squealing into a corner like a rodent. </p><p>“Merlin’s hairy nuts, James! That hurt!” </p><p>Sirius laughed along with James, loud and happy, seemingly back to his old self, but he pressed his knee a little harder into Remus’ thigh as if he needed the sensation of steady ground beneath it. It was Remus who had to pull away from the contact; too angry to be steady. He was angry at Sirius’ parents mostly, something of the wolf in him longing to bite off the hands that had caused such harm, but he was also angry at Sirius for going back again and again, at Peter and James for brushing it all off so easily and at himself for being angry in the first place. The rawness of the look Sirius shot him at the loss of contact only served to dig that hole of self-loathing even deeper. </p><p>That was the first time Remus began to comprehend how complicated Sirius’ relationship with his family was. Nothing was ever purely black and white; there was pain and there was anger but there was loyalty too - Padfoot the dog always loyal no matter how many times he was kicked. If Sirius couldn’t hate them Remus would. </p><p>The school year continued as usual for the next few weeks - Sirius and James got into trouble and invariably dragged Remus and Peter with them, they served detention, went to class and teased James for his pining after Lily. Sirius and James went to quidditch practice and came back again (and again, and again), while Remus ached abstractly for something he didn’t understand. Everything in its right place, safe as houses, safe as ever. </p><p>Then the whispers started, soft sounds echoing through the castle hallways. Horror stories, half-believed half derided, passed from student to student in the dark like contraband. Muggles missing, half-bloods murdered in their beds, bands of werewolves - made rabid by magic and promises of power - roaming the country in packs, turning everyone they came across. Students stopped coming back to Hogwarts. First mainly Slytherins, then from other houses too. One or two students left in the middle of the night, disappearing as though they’d never been there at all. </p><p>Sirius began saying vague and cryptic things about “taking up the mantle” and “family responsibility” always semi sarcastically and with enough derision that the others mostly ignored it. Remus, sensitive to Sirius’ moods for reasons he didn’t like to examine too closely, was the only one who seemed to see how much the idea truly repulsed him. In hindsight, of course, it made sense that Sirius would be the first to feel the wind changing. He was privy to the echoes of whispered conversations, the behind-closed-doors meetings his parents held after hours, the meaning-laden small-talk during the posh old money dinner parties he did his best to drink his way through. He knew, had always known, had seen this storm coming.</p><p align="center">--- </p><p>In their 6th year, Sirius returned from the autumn break without Regulus. Remus found him on the roof of the Astronomy Tower, curled on the ledge of the parapet, bottle of firewhisky dangling precariously from between his fingers. He looked tired, completely worn, something bruised and almost scared in the way he hunched his shoulders against the spring chill. </p><p>He hadn’t bothered to change into his robes, still wearing his torn jeans and leather jacket, his dirty Gryffindor house scarf wrapped snugly around his neck. His hair was a little longer than when Remus had seen him last, curling against his shoulders and the sharp, starved line of his jaw. He started at Remus’ approach, but his expression gentled with recognition after a short moment, a smile flashing across his pale face, his bitten lips -  momentary softness in his cut-glass eyes. </p><p>“I should give you a dress code violation,” said Remus, in the same tone he would use to gentle a frightened animal “and detention for the drinking”</p><p>“It’s the least I deserve,” he said by way of greeting, scooting to make room beside him on the ledge, tipping the bottle in drunken salutation and causing the contents within to slosh alarmingly “I’ve been a bad son” he continued “and a worse brother, and an even worse friend” </p><p>Remus gently took the bottle from his limp hand, setting it down on the floor so he could join Sirius in his nook in the wall. He was longer than Sirius, lankier, and had to curl his knees much closer to his chest to fit. With a heartbreaking sigh Sirius, seemingly unconsciously, curled himself towards Remus, body a limp crescent of warmth against Remus’ side. The weight of Sirius’ head on his shoulder caused a wave of emotion so complicated and inexpressible that Remus’ heart skittered, terrified, like a rabbit before a fox. Sirius smelled of soap and smoke and something musty and uncomfortable and cold that must have been the smell of Grimmauld Place. </p><p>“Reg is with them; he’s always been the better son, done what they want, <em> been </em> what they want. I’ve tried, you know I have, sometimes, only a little really” his words were slurred, the soft waves of his hair under Remus’ cheek so dear and fragile suddenly, the warmth of his breath seemingly the only proof of life. “But there are things that I <em> can’t do </em> , <em> won’t do </em> and they know that and it makes them angry. It’s the fact that I won’t pass on the family name that makes them angriest I think; Reg is their last hope. They want to keep up appearances, for now, but Jesus Rem, the things they would do to me..” He shivered, whether from cold or the horror of the things he wasn’t really saying Remus didn’t know. Sirius dropped his voice to a whisper, dispassionate as breaking glass “Everything they’re saying, everything, all those horrible things are all true”</p><p>The sun had disappeared behind the mountains but a rim of light still lingered at the horizon, red and bloody as a fresh wound. Remus thought suddenly of violence and war and what it would be like to die.</p><p>“Surely,” said Remus, sounding unsure even to himself “surely it’s not as bad as all that”</p><p>“You’re right” Surius barked, somewhere between a laugh and an agonized shriek “it’s worse, it’s so much worse”</p><p>He seemed to calm for a moment, to reel himself back from whatever precipice he had approached. Loose-limbed he pulled himself upright, turning to face Remus, his body a dark shape against the backdrop of the bloody sky. Curled as he was Remus was of a height with Sirius, truly face to face with each other as they hadn’t been since second year. Some long-dormant feeling woke in the pit of Remus’ stomach and started roaring.</p><p>“There’s so much wrong with me” Sirius said, voice low, eyes half-lidded and glittering in the dim light. His breath was warm and alcoholic against Remus’ mouth, the proximity of him electric. </p><p>“Oh, God” said Remus, to whom he wasn’t quite sure; himself perhaps, or no one, certainly not Sirius, not when his mouth was pressing against Remus’ with something adjacent to tenderness, not when there was the unsure flutter of his breath against his cheeks and the soft brush of his eyelashes, or, <em> or </em>. </p><p align="center">---</p><p>They didn’t talk about the kiss. In all seriousness, Remus would have believed that Sirius had been too drunk to remember if it wasn’t for the cagy way Sirius acted around him afterward. Sirius had always been embarrassingly tactile, always throwing his arms around people, laying his head in their laps, hugging, holding hands, and leaving slobbery kisses on the cheeks of even his least friendly acquaintances - his affection was boundless and enthusiastic and physical. </p><p>Remus hadn’t realized how much he had come to rely on Sirius’ physical proximity until suddenly it was gone. No more shaggy black head resting in his lap during long study nights in the common room, no more gentle tugs on his hair in greeting when they passed each other in the hall, no more skinny arms forcibly linked through his on the walks to and from classes or the dining hall. Instead, he was faced daily with a shaky, unsure Sirius, who made a point to sit on the other side of James at meals and spoke to him only when asked a direct question. The lack of contact made him feel unmoored, adrift, lonely in a way he’d never felt before. </p><p>Beyond the lack of contact with Remus, Sirius seemed to be his same old self, same tactile, slobbery Snuffles but something about it bothered him like it hadn’t before. He didn’t begin to realize why until a specific event began to put the pieces into focus.</p><p>It happened on a sweltering evening in May, right after the advanced level charms class that Remus and James took with the 7th year Slytherins. Over the course of the year, it had become Sirius’ habit to meet them outside the door afterward and walk with them down to the great hall for dinner. On this particular occasion, he didn’t show up. They waited for a few minutes, standing on a window ledge to see over the tide of students leaving class, looking out for Sirius’ shaggy head and artfully safety-pinned robes among the crowd. </p><p>“Come on Moons, I’m starving” James whined, clutching his stomach melodramatically “He probably just forgot” </p><p>“Yeah, fine” said Remus, shaking his head to clear it. He got spaced-out and ornery during the week leading up to the full moon, the wolf growing stronger by the day until his body physically couldn’t contain it anymore. If he was acting particularly weird and prickly this month neither James nor Peter had said anything. </p><p>They hopped down off their ledge and took off in the direction of the great hall. James was rambling about something inane - some new and exciting items that had just been stocked at Zonko’s, how good Lily looked in that green velvet dress she wore last weekend, what he was going to eat at dinner - but Remus wasn’t paying attention. He was distracted, feeling more wolf than usual, spiritually itchy, the wrong shape for his own skin. </p><p>Turning into a shortcut corridor they almost ran smack into a figure - two figures - standing in the middle of it.</p><p>It was Sirius, caught up in the arms of a taller boy, their mouths pressed together in open-mouthed passion. The other boy had his hand in the curls at the base of Sirius’ neck, his long, sure fingers resting with care along the sharp curve of Sirius’ jaw. </p><p>James wolf-whistled, causing the happy couple to jump apart self-consciously. Sirius’ eyes were glazed, his lips, kiss-reddened, curled into a smile when he saw it was only James and Remus. He said something to the other boy - Evan Olcott, Remus remembered, unhelpfully - who gave him a fond smile and a kiss on the cheek before retreating down the hall. Sirius bounded over with all the excitement of a puppy, wide-eyed and innocent, happy for once. </p><p>Remus was struck by the sudden and overwhelming desire to be sick. </p><p>“Hell yes, Black!” James said, pulling Sirius in for a noogie “My little boy finally grown and getting some sweet loving!” </p><p>“Oh  come off it!” He was red with embarrassment but his smile was pleased “We off to dinner then?” </p><p>“Yeah, I’m starved, and you need to give me details, all of them”.</p><p>“Yeah right. No way” Sirius laughed, making a disgusted face, then, turning back around to look at Remus, who was still rooted to the floor in shock “Coming Rem?” </p><p>“I-” Remus felt like his heart had dropped out of him completely, leaving a hole of sucking emptiness in the middle of his chest. “I - bathroom” he finished lamely, fiddling with the frayed strap of his book bag to avoid looking Sirius in the eyes. </p><p>“Yeah, fine fine” said James who was pulling on Sirius’ arm impatiently “but I need food and gossip <em> now </em>. I can’t believe you didn’t tell me!” he chastised. Sirius’ reply was lost as they rounded the corner. </p><p>Remus spent a moment wrestling with himself and the urge to vomit all over his shoes. He knew all about homophobia, of course. Hope Lupin, while she had been steadfast in her decision to raise her son with the values of the rather more lenient Wizarding World had been unable to convince Remus’ grandparents to be anything other than ‘<em> of their time’ </em>. He’d sat through many a Sunday dinner during which the topic would turn to “those blasted homosexuals” as his grandfather called them and Remus would curl a little bit closer in on himself, feeling like there was something very very wrong with the world. </p><p>This emotion wasn’t disgust, or at least not of the same furious kind exhibited by his grandfather. It was more accurately described as a mixture of deep-seated pain and heart-rending fear. It was as though he had been walking around with a broken leg his whole life without realizing it and the sudden awakening to the pain of his shattered femur only served to make him wonder what else he’d been ignoring. </p><p>He made his way back to Gryffindor Tower in a daze, absentmindedly walking <em> through </em> at least one ghost without realizing it. He wished he was someone else, or maybe dead, he couldn’t quite decide. Maybe if he was <em> normal </em> Sirius would like him instead, if he was pureblood, if he wasn’t a monster. </p><p>It was Evan Olcott that Sirius had been kissing; the Hufflepuff head boy, a handsome, old-family, 7th year with a shaggy blonde crew cut and the beginnings of a mustache who wore red high top sneakers under his robes and liked the Muggle band The Rolling Stones - not the brightest but he was kind and gentle and human, the opposite of Remus - what Sirius deserved. </p><p>The thought of <em> what Sirius deserved </em> infuriated him, on the one hand he was furious with Sirius for kissing someone else but on the other, and more important, hand he was furious with <em> himself </em> for even thinking that way. This was a theme in Remus’ life, being angry with himself for being angry. He made up his mind to pretend the whole thing had never happened, electing instead to go to bed early and parry Sirius’ attempts to rouse him with the excuse of a vicious, moon-related headache. </p><p align="center">---</p><p>It took an entire day for Remus to finally boil over. All four of them were sitting in their accustomed corner of the common room. Peter was reading the funny pages from the Evening Prophet under the table, his intermittent sniggering like nails on a chalkboard to Remus’ moon-sharpened nerves. Sirius, playing a game of chess with James, kept glancing up at him from beneath his shaggy fringe, a half-smile on his lips as if in challenge. They were ostensibly studying but Remus was the only one who had cracked a book all evening, nevermind that he’d been reading the same page over and over for the past half hour, vision gone red and a furious pounding in his ears.</p><p>He thought about the possessive way that Evan had clutched at the back of Sirius’ head and wanted to rip that hand off. He thought of the way Sirius’ mouth had felt against his all those months ago on the roof of the Astronomy Tower - the white-lightning crackle, the soft perfect heat - and wanted to feel that again. He thought about how much he wanted to kiss Sirius again and wanted to blow out his own brains (and round and round and round).</p><p>It all became too much suddenly, causing him to slam his book into the middle of James and Sirius’ game, sending pieces flying. </p><p>“Merlin’s Balls, Moony!” yelped James, leaping backward to avoid a startled knight who, in its panic, was attempting to stab everything in sight, including James’ hand.</p><p>“What is wrong with you?!” Remus yelled. Conversations in the common room ground to a halt, confused and curious faces turning in their direction. Under normal circumstances, he would have been embarrassed, lowered his voice, taken the argument elsewhere or even simply sat down and let the others forget about it. Not tonight. Tonight he was furious for no discernible reason and the wolf would be satisfied with nothing short of a shouting match. </p><p>“Me?” Asked Sirius, crossing his arms and leaning back in his chair “do you want a fucking list?”  </p><p>“Remus” James hissed, trying to place a comforting hand on his shoulder and pull him back into his seat at once “What on earth’s got your knickers in a knot?” </p><p>“It’s him!” he shouted, jabbing a finger at Sirius who was still looking infuriatingly impassive “He’s the fucking problem!” </p><p>“What on earth did I ever do to you?” </p><p>“You..! you…! <em> You </em> saw him!” he turned to James for help, both of whom looked completely shocked and at a loss for words “After Charms on Wednesday, playing fucking t-tonsil hockey with Evan Olcott in the middle of the hall!” </p><p>Sirius barked a laugh at that, hunching forward a little. If he had hackles they would have been raised - it was a relatively new movement, learned from his dog form, the sight of it sent Remus into a tailspin. “Wasn’t aware that I was talking to my damn mother. Didn’t know you had it in you to be such a bigot, Moony” </p><p>That brought him up short and sputtering “I’m not - I’m not…” </p><p>“Does it bother you that much?” Sirius had stood up, his hands claw-like on the varnished surface of the table, his expression mocking, his eyes like chips of ice “the idea of me snogging a boy. I bet you’re just curious, bet you wish I’d told you that we do other things together, that I let him put his cock in my ass and that I really really like it when he does -” </p><p>Someone in the room whistled, someone else shouted: “tell us more!” The wolf inside of Remus snapped, something unhinged and possessive coming loose suddenly and overwhelmingly. </p><p>“I wish you would both just piss off and die!” </p><p>Remus wished he could take the words back as soon as they left his mouth, a pit of dread and regret opening in his stomach. It felt like falling over a cliff, suddenly he’d gone too far and everything he cared about was freefalling towards the unforgiving ground below. Sirius looked like he’d been slapped, his mouth opening on nothing and his eyes going wide and hurt. A moment of stunned silence followed, during which Remus heard, rather than felt, Sirius cut him off entirely.</p><p>“Sirius” he said, all the anger gone suddenly, guilt sitting heavy in its place, it felt like a knife had been plunged into his chest, every breath hurt “Sirius, I..” </p><p>“You know what, Lupin?” he said, venom layered on thick “I just fucking might”</p><p>There were tears on his lashes, just glimpsed, before he shoved his hands in his pockets and, with lowered head, pushed past Remus to the portrait hole and out into the hall. </p><p>The common room was utterly silent, all eyes on Remus who was feeling more and more awful by the minute. He wanted to run after Sirius, to apologize, to explain, but he was rooted to the spot by the weight of everything he’d just done, pinned like a fly to a specimen card by all the judgment in the room. </p><p>“Nice one Moony” James hissed, jostling painfully into Remus’ side on his way after Sirius. </p><p>“Yeah, nice one Moony” said Peter from under the table “What do you care who he snogs anyway? it’s not like you’re sweet on him or anything”</p><p>The stinging jinx he cast on Peter was, perhaps, a bit stronger than he’d meant it to be but he couldn’t bring himself to care. He found his feet suddenly and took the stairs to the dormitory two at a time, hoping he was far enough away from the common room by the time he started sobbing that no one would hear. </p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p>He didn’t see Sirius for the entirety of the next day, not at breakfast, or lunch, or in any of the classes they were supposed to share that day; for all intents and purposes, it was as though Sirius had simply disappeared. He was sick with worry and guilt, turning the things he’d said over and over in his mind, hating himself more and more with each revisiting. </p><p>By the time the school day was done and Dumbledore was carefully locking him into the shrieking shack with a plate of sandwiches for his dinner, he was feverish with anxiety and shame, wondering if the others would even show up, if they were too angry with him, if he would have to face the moon alone for the first time in over a year, if he’d just ruined everything by being so selfish. </p><p>For the first time, he welcomed the wolf, the clarity and emptiness that came with it. In that momentary clarity before the wolf clawed him open he came to a realization; he loved Sirius, perhaps always had, perhaps would never love anyone else. Admitting that was like surrendering to a heart attack; a surrender of his entire life. He gave himself over to the pain and let it consume him.</p><p>The wolf howled and the world faded into black and white.</p><p align="center">---</p><p>The fact of it was, Remus had little memory of what his wolf-self did - it was a bit like being black-out drunk; he would feel only moderately altered while it was happening, but would wake to find he’d done things he didn’t remember and that the course of the night. After so long the only thing to feel during a shift was fear, not at <em> becoming </em> the wolf - he’d long grown past that - but at what he would consciously do and then forget about when he came to. </p><p>Remus often wondered, for philosophical purposes, which was his real self. If he’d been a monster for so long that it didn’t matter that he’d been born human. He began to feel that he was only truly himself when he turned, that the wolf was the only thing that allowed him to let loose - to feel strongly enough that he broke. </p><p align="center">---</p><p>He woke to the comforting white walls and herbal smell of the hospital wing. His wounds had been bandaged and charmed into submission and every bone in his body ached like a growing pain - nothing new. He groaned as he rolled his head to the side, cracking the vertebrae in his neck only to be brought up short. There was someone in the chair by the side of the bed. Remus’ heart leaped into his throat and started attempting to take evasive action. </p><p>“Wotcher” said Sirius. He was hunched over with his elbows on his knees and his chin cupped in his hands, a hank of hair falling in a perfect superman-style ‘c’ shape over one eye. He looked a mess -  hair tangled and unwashed, circles the color of bruises under both eyes, lips chapped from being worried at - but he was still the most beautiful thing Remus had ever woken up to.</p><p>“I’m sorry” he said, all in a rush, his voice scratchy and mouth feeling as though it was filled with cotton “Gosh Pads I’m so so so sorry. I didn’t mean it, not even for a minute. I’d understand if you don’t want to be friends anymore but I must express how truly sorry I am. I let the wolf get the best of me which I know isn’t any sort of excuse… who you snog and where isn’t any of my business, unless of course you do <em> you know </em> in my bed in which case I’d have a problem with that -” He trailed off in confusion, heart feeling wrung out. Sirius’ had covered his face with his hands and his shoulders were shaking but he wasn’t crying, he was.. Laughing? “What? What did I say?”</p><p>“Remmy” He peeked out between his fingers at Remus, storm-cloud eyes bright with mirth “you are honestly the only person I can think of, besides maybe my uncle, who would use the phrase “I must express...” completely seriously”. </p><p>“I mean it” </p><p>“I know” </p>
