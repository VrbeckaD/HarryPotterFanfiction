    <p>Dumbledore was scanning the latest Daily Prophet when his hand suddenly shook a little, a movement hardly noticeable if only the cup of tea held in his hand hadn’t sloshed over onto his fine-tailored grey vest. He dapped at the black simmering tea quickly with the neatly folded handkerchief and narrowly pinched his eyebrows at the boldface-typed, eye-catching title written in the biggest size covering nearly half of the front page saying: GELLERT GRINDELWALD THE DARK LORD RETURNED: the Ministry broken into in five minutes, Security emergency levels red.</p><p>This was ridiculous, yet it had happened. Dumbledore hadn’t heard anything about Grindelwald since the last interview he had with Newt, which meant that the Dark Lord hadn’t conducted any heinous attacks since his last time in France. Well, it now seems that he was conspiring all the time. The ministry always has a way to underestimate its enemies, Dumbledore found it quite ironically amusing to think so actually.</p><p>Shaking his head with a dash of disapproval expression, Dumbledore forced himself to think no further and wasted no time in checking out the following detailed information:</p><p>Later that night on April 24, 2019, a carefully planned fire and explosion took place in the Ministry of Magic. Caught off guard, all of the officials down in the ministry hall were disarmed and controlled by a squad of crack, fake Aurors. At the same time, a dubious male wizard wearing a black windcheater walked blatantly into the ministry in the broad daylight, who later turned out to be the world-wanted notorious dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald. according to the witness on the corridor, he saw Grindelwald stalked straight to the third room on the floor which was the office for the Department of Mysteries, the officials of which later confirmed this testimony…… the intention of Grindelwald planning this attack was not clear yet, despite the fact that this dark wizard left an arrogant message on the desk of the minister’s office declaring that he just stepped by and felt an impulse to break into the place and so did he, which is hardly believable. Our Aurors are searching day and night to find out the true reason. luckily, no man was hurt severely in this attack, though several places of the buildings which undertook the explosions were strongly damaged.</p><p>There was also a picture of the messy ministry after attack, and now it turned into the imagine of Gellert Grindelwald smirking mysteriously at the reader before the largely opened door. As long as Dumbledore finished his reading, he couldn’t help training his eyes to the blonde wizard, the one whose mismatched breathtaking eyes always had the strong power to grab your heart in a minute.</p><p>Dumbledore put down the newspaper before leaning back against his chair, quirking a bitter smile. </p><p>some birds warbling outside, Dumbledore trained his eyes to the window and found it somehow broadly open now. blew open by the wind again, Dumbledore thought. it’s time to cast the rusted blot a repairo. Or maybe next time. he tilted his head, staring at the puffy, cotton clouds and beautiful cobalt sky outside, finding the soft breeze quite pleasant. </p><p>if only all of the memory could be rubbed away smoothly and everything in the past could be as beautiful as this sight…… Dumbledore frowned painfully and massaged his temples, trying not to suck into the bitter, terrible, turbulent feelings before a staccato of knocking stroke and the door wrenched open.</p><p>“Professor,” a terrified boy went in, voice trembling. “professor, Nicolas went fainted in the exam!”</p><p> </p><p>******<br/>It was not until 9:00 p.m. had Dumbledore finished his job in taking care of the freak-out boy as well as his other daily routines.</p><p>He must admit that sometimes he preferred to be occupied. He was knackered and left no strength to give a think about this forlorn situation every time he returned “home”? he guessed. Well, it was a bit bad but not that bad actually, as tonight the moonlight was glistening like surging waves outside. Despite the fact that he was not in the very mood to appreciate it, it was a quite pleasant, breezy night.</p><p>Dumbledore was one of that kind who preferred to soak in the beauty of moonlight rather than turning on the dazzling white light. He quickly lighted a candle before holding it to the bathroom where he would need a shower.</p><p>With all the soft wind breezed in from the window, he generally enjoyed this precious hot-tub moment. If everything went on smoothly, he would only have one lesson to teach tomorrow. Or maybe, considering this situation, he thought he would soon be inquired by the ministry, bound to be a little bothersome. But well, he can handle that.</p><p>The hot water shimmering around mirrored the moonlight, whose silver waves was flowing around like an ocean in the nut, Dumbledore closed his beautiful blue eyes and lurk into the water to immerse himself into some meditation before something far away flow into his ears.</p><p>He burst out from the water and opened his eyes beadily. There is someone else in this room.</p><p>There definitely is.</p><p>he picked up his wand and walked out from the tub before wearing his dark blue night-robe. </p><p>The slight sound came closer and closer. A lazy, cat-like movement, Dumbledore thought. there was a brittle of tension and all of a sudden it was erased by a soft breeze seep into his glistening skins and the materialization of the people hiding in the dark.</p><p>The people immersed in the moonlight, his blonde hair seemed exactly the way he looked like in all the newspapers Dumbledore had read. it’s not very much like what he was in their days, he used to be tall, lanky. but now he looked like more seasoned and willful. He tilted his head, seemingly pondering yet eyes glimmering all the canny things.</p><p>O Gellert Grindelwald. </p><p>Dumbledore lost his breath.</p><p>It seemed like to be an eternity before he started to talk. The air was frozen and the moonlight now was sewing  nothing but chill into this dark room. The longer and deeper Dumbledore stared and bored into him, the harder he found he could breathe.</p><p>“So,” the dark lord made the scene look that as though he was wondering, but god damn it it’s him who should be wondering. gindelwald turned around, “this is where you live”</p><p>“this is where I live, and WHY ARE YOU EVEN HERE?” Dumbledore rolled his eyes, enunciating in clipped syllables.</p><p>“Well it seems,” Grindelwald’s mismatched eyes were sparking glistening, mysterious light. He walked towards Dumbledore and that was the time he retreated back a few steps.</p><p>And it hit him that they were still in synchronization.</p><p>Not only hit, it hurts.</p><p>Grindelwald drawled in again: “Well it seems clearly that…… I have came here to meet you.”</p><p>“Then what have you been doing all over the twenty years?” Dumbledore snapped impatiently, glaring and scowling.</p><p>“WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING OVER THE TWENTY YEARS?” he kept going, “if you want to rekindle me, you should do it twenty years ago.”</p><p>“You are getting nothing from me.” He concluded.</p><p>“You were the one who missed the boat. You just walked away from my life and let me die breathlessly in the seashore, choked by the immense airshift of heated sunshine.” </p><p>For umpteenth time had he pictured about this scene before- this pathetic reunion full of tension where he would shout and inquire on the verge of obliteration, he could haul the collar of Grindelwald's shirt and shove the tip of his wand against his thoat and curse him with every malice he well and truly meant. </p><p>But none of that happened. </p><p>It turned out that, when this day actually came, he was just more tried of the past. </p><p>Perhaps, he just felt wronged. </p><p>He hadn't noticed his tears until Grindelwald reached out his hands to wipe them away. </p><p>Oh Merlin, am I crying now? His knuckles are as pale and cold as the snow, his eyes closed painfully and his lips trembling, and…why?</p><p>why does he pinched his eyebrows so painfully that he seemed to be suffering from a emotional torment right now? Dumbledore could not ban himself from wondering, nor could he resist the impulse to touch his opposite.</p><p>And that was the time when Grindelwald's eyes opened with the heartbreaking expression remained in his pale, chilling face. </p><p>He stared into Dumbledore's eyes and seemed to have gathered all his power to placate him gently and softly.</p><p>"I am sorry, Albus, I am and I was so so so sorry to--" </p><p>and that was the time he threw himself into his arms and erupted into tears.</p>
