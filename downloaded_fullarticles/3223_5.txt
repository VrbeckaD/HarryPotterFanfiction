    <p>He was blind and deaf and drifting all at once. There was fire coursing through his veins and he felt as though he was being slowly turned to ice while a sharp daggar pierced his organs. It made no sense in his mind, he knew enough to know that his body was simply lying down and that it had only been like that for no more than a few seconds, but the pain and fear and nothingness made it feel longer.<br/>
Moments later the fire recided enough that he could open his eyes and turn his head with minimal pain.<br/>
To his left was the bottom of a dark blue dress, its once white trim gray from the dirt on the floor and its wearer's lack of care.
On his right was a pale arm covered in a golden sleeve that stopped before a delicate wrist and a nimble hand. He knew there was a third person somewhere, and as much as he tried spotting them, the pain that was once dulled burned brightly. He stilled as the pain burned through him and then just as suddenly as it began, everything stopped. He could move his body and feel the smooth stone floor underneath him.
Straining he could hear the muffled moans coming from the woman in blue, the light panting from the woman in yellow, and the faint swears from behind him. He gathered all of his strangth and asked in a strained voice, "What the bloody hell was that, Sal?"<br/>
The swearing stopped as a raspy voice replied, "I don't know. Something went wrong and I don't know what."<br/>
"At least," the woman in yellow huffed, "it wasn't permenent."<br/>
"That we know of," was the sharp reply from the woman in blue. The four remained silent as the slowly picked themselves up of the ground. Finally standing, the man looked at the other occupants in the stone chamber. The woman in blue looked ruffled,  her long black hair dishevled and her slender face smudged with dirt. The woman in yellow wasn't much better, her honey blond hair was partically out of its bun and her rounder face also covered in dirt. The last occupant, a young man in a stained green shirt with brown trousers, looked the most grimey. He didn't think he would be much better and when he caught sight of his appearence in the floor, he grimanced. His red hair looked more gray with all of the dirt and wilder than usual, and he also had the beginnings of a nasty bruise on his jaw.<br/>
"Well, what were you working on this time, Sal?" The yellow woman asked the other man.
"Originally a potion that when poured on flames they would freeze and then become water," Sal replied, running a hand through his dark red hair. "I was positive that I had it but..." He sighed and gestured around the destroyed room.
"A better question would be if there are side affects to whatever we were doused with," the blue woman said, gracefully walking towards the yellow woman.
"Helga, would you mind checking us over? You are much better at dignostic spells."<br/>
"Of course." Helga took out her wand and waved it over the woman before moving on to the other two.
"Nothing wrong beyond a few scrapes and bruises." she put her wand away as the blue woman nodded.
"What do you think, Godric?" She asked, turning to look at him.<br/>
What did he think? The sharp, burning pain was just a memory yet it carried something— possibly harmless— over. He even said as much, getting a huff from the blue woman and a grimance from Helga.<br/>
"Stop pesturing, Rowena," Salazar grumbled, red hair on end. Godric tried smiling at him but the bruise made it feel more like a grimance.
"We should head back up," he said finally. "The children will be here soon."<br/>
"And we shouldn't meet them looking like we rolled in a sty," Helga added, getting a scowl from Rowena.
"Please," she scoffed, brushing at her dress with no avail. "We look like we went one on one with a hundred trolls and lost."<br/>
"Well put." Godric gently grasped Rowena's and Helga's hands and led them towards the door. Sal grumbled before carefully rightening the desk and various cauldrons before joining them.<br/>
As the door closed shut and the four walked away towards their quarters, something amazing happened. In the chamber white light pulsed slowly from one of the still up-right cauldrons. The light shifted, gaining a blue tint then darkening to red before lightening to yellow, green following afterwards before the lights started shifting faster. The colors merged and changed, blinking rapidly before a flash of white and the brief sound of ticking, the chamber became once more dark.<br/>
The failed potion was gone, the cauldron clean expect for the faintest of tints. The four friends never saw nor heard anything as they greeted the newest students to Hogwarts and returned the older ones smiles.<br/>
Later when the feast was over and everyone in bed, Salazar would go down to clean and the cauldron would be missing. The only evidence that it had existed in the first place was a small ring of ash where it had once been and, if you listened closely, the barest of ticking could be heard.</p>
