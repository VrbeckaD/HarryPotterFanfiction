    <p>Eight year old Harry Potter was working in the garden attempting to finish his long list of chores. The sun was scorching hot and he felt weak and dizzy from dehydration. He knew he could make water appear if he tried hard enough. He also knew if he was caught doing anything unusual he would live to regret it. </p><p>Harry was smarter than most. He knew it wasn't normal for children to be treated the same way he was. Dudley was always given whatever he wanted, while Harry was barely given enough food to survive. Dudley even had a second bedroom just to fit all of his <em>toys.</em></p><p>He wished more than anything his parents hadn't died so he wouldn't have to live with his Aunt and Uncle. Sometimes he even wished they would get sick of him and send him to an orphanage. At least then he wouldn't have to listen to their annoying voices.</p><p>He hoped to one day escape the Dursleys and get revenge for everything they had done to him over the years, but for now he was stuck. As an eight year old he had nowhere else to go. He tried running away once before, but the police found him and brought him back. That night was one of the worst in his short living memory. He truly believed he was going to die, but luckily enough he didn't. Slowly over the next couple weeks his body managed to heal.</p><p>Thinking back to that time, Harry's hatred for the Dursleys grew, and his eyes burned with tears. Someday he would return the favor he vowed. </p><p>Someday when they were least expecting it he would kill them. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry was trimming the rose bushes when he accidentally grabbed into a thorn. He winced as the sharp point pierced his skin, leaving behind a crimson bead. He watched, transfixed as the bead ran down his palm. He sighed and concentrated on closing the wound. Soon enough there was only a small pink mark left behind, a bright spot contrasting with his tanned skin. He wiped the blood from his hand on the grass before turning back to his work. </p><p>
  <em>"Stupid humans, thinking they can keep me in a cage. They can't keep me from hunting mice outside"</em>
</p><p>Harry looked around, trying to see where the voice was coming from.</p><p>Suddenly he looked down and came face to face with a beautiful snake, covered in shining black scales. It was thin, and only about a foot long and possessed dark red eyes, not unlike the blood he had just wiped on the grass moments earlier. He stared at the snake incredulously, wondering if he actually just heard a snake talk.</p><p>The snake seemed to glare at him, if that were possible for a snake, and hissed,<em>"Another stupid human! Maybe I should bite this one since he interrupted my hunt!"</em></p><p>Harrys eyes widened at that. He actually heard an animal speak. He quickly realized the snake was about to bite him, so he said, <em>"Please don't bite me! I mean you no harm, and I'm sorry for interrupting your hunt!"</em></p><p>Now the snake seemed to stare at him incredulously. It was silent for a few moments before it replied,<em>"A speaker!! I have never met a speaker before! The last speaker that existed was my mother's master! You will be my master now. I will protect you speaker!"</em></p><p>Harry was confused when the snake called him a speaker. What did the snake mean that he was a speaker? He spoke English just like everyone else? <em>"What do you mean I'm a speaker?"  </em>He asked.</p><p>The snake seemed almost giddy with happiness at this point,<em>"You speak the snake tongue! Almost no humans can speak the snake tongue!"</em></p><p>Harry started to say that he was speaking English, not a snake language, but then he noticed the strange hissing that came out of his mouth. He became even more confused and asked, "<em>Why can I speak to you? It sounds like English when I hear you speak to me. Why aren't there other people who can speak the snake tongue?"</em></p><p>The snake seemed surprised for a second before replying,<em>"Only very rare wizards can speak the snake tongue! Wizards that are descended from Salazar Slytherin! It's a very special gift!"</em></p><p>Harry gapped at the snake. He couldn't help it. A wizard?!? Was that what he was?? Was he using magic to make strange things happen?? <em>"You mean that I'm a wizard? I can do magic?"</em></p><p><em>"Of course! " </em>The snake replied,<em> "Only wizards can be speakers. Other humans with no magic can't speak the snake tongue. You are my master now, I will stay with you forever to protect you."</em></p><p>Harry's mind was going a million miles an hour. He was a wizard! That meant there must be other wizards out there. He wasn't unusual, he was special. Harry was brimming with happiness. Maybe someday he would find a way to escape and live with his own kind. </p><p>Just as Harry was imagining the possibilities, his Aunt Petunia called from in the house, "BOY GET IN THE HOUSE AND MAKE DINNER!!"</p><p>Harry's happiness dimmed slightly. He looked down at the snake and said, "<em>My aunt is calling me to cook dinner, I have to go."</em></p><p>The snake then surprised him by wrapping around his waist under his shirt so it couldn't be seen by his aunt. The snake was angry as he hissed, <em>"My master cooks dinner for the ordinary humans! That is not acceptable! My master should not have to cook for anyone! I am coming with you, you are my master and I shall not leave you."</em></p><p>Harry smiled at the snakes reply. For the very first time in his life he wasn't completely alone. He then dashed into the house to cook dinner for the Dursleys, feeling better than he had in a long time.</p>
