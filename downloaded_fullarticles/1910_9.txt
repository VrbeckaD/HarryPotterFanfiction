    <p>There was a palpable tension around the dinner table. Harry nervously eyed his two friends, who in turn seemed determined to look anywhere but at each other. This had become, of late, a regular feature of their meet-ups.</p>
<p>Harry, Ron and Hermione had for years been meeting for dinner on a regular basis. It was a means of keeping them close; Hermione and Ron had been married for years, and Harry knew that they had feared that their union would push him away. These meet-ups were supposed to ensure that this could never happen.</p>
<p>Of late, however, there had been an atmosphere between them. Or more precisely, between Ron and Hermione. Harry had been reluctant to interrogate them about it; he didn’t want to find himself in a position where he was forced to pick a side. </p>
<p>“Can you pass me the peas?” Harry asked politely. It was a banal attempt to break the silence that had descended on the table. </p>
<p>The dish was located between Hermione and Ron. They looked at each other briefly before averting their eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s closer to you.” Ron said gruffly to his wife. </p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes and passed it across the table. “There you go Harry,” she said in a deliberately sweet voice. </p>
<p>Harry looked at Ron, then at Hermione, and then back at Ron. “Look,” he said. “I can see something’s going on here. Maybe it’d be better if you guys took tonight to hash this thing out, and we could meet another time.”</p>
<p>“No, don’t go.” Hermione said quickly. </p>
<p>Now it was Ron’s turn to roll his eyes. “What, can’t stand the thought of being alone with me?”</p>
<p>Harry shot a glare at his friend. Ron was a good mate and a great guy, but he could be unbearable in this kind of mood. </p>
<p>“I knew you’d pick her side.” Ron grumbled. </p>
<p>“Ron, I’m not on anyone’s side…” Harry said.</p>
<p>Ron was not to be persuaded, however. He rose from his seat and dumped his plate in the sink. Neither Harry nor Hermione tried to stop him when he stormed out of the room. He’d come around eventually, and they’d have a laugh about it. </p>
<p>They heard him stomp upstairs. When Hermione was satisfied he was out of reach, she picked up her wand to cast a muffliato charm on the room. Whether this was to help Ron sleep or to give them some privacy, Harry was not aware. He did not intend to stay long, regardless.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Harry.” Hermione sighed after a little while. “We’ve ruined tonight for you.”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. “Don’t worry about it. But what is going on between you two?”</p>
<p>Hermione blushed. “It’s embarrassing.”</p>
<p>When she did not elaborate, Harry said: “Fair enough, I won’t pry.” In truth, he had little desire to know. Their antics had tired him out, and he wanted to get home to Ginny sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>“How do you and Ginny stay so strong? This never seems to happen to you.”</p>
<p>“We have our share of arguments. But I dunno, I guess the passion is still there. If the passion’s there, it makes it easier.”</p>
<p>Hermione nodded gravely. “I think that’s it. The passion. I mean, I still love Ron. But the passion’s not there, if you know what I mean.”</p>
<p>Her intonation was intentionally suggestive. Harry furrowed his eyebrows. “Erm, not really.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s cheeks reddened further. She averted her eyes from his.”What I mean to say is… it’s embarrassing… well, you know. We love each other, but Ron has trouble demonstrating his passion… if you know what I mean.”</p>
<p>Harry was initially still confused, but he eventually caught what she was attempting to convey. He held back a grimace. The thought of Hermione and Ron having sex was not a welcome one. </p>
<p>“Listen, Hermione. I’m not sure I’m the right guy to talk to about this.”</p>
<p>In the two decades they’d known each other, Harry wasn’t sure they had once discussed sex. </p>
<p>“Oh, okay.” She said, embarrassed. “I understand, I know it’s awkward. Can I just ask one question, though?”</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>“With you and Ginny, when you say there’s still passion. The sex is part of that, right?”</p>
<p>When she said “sex”, her voice dropped almost to a whispher. It was remarkable - Hermione could be as assertive as witches came on most topics, but remained utterly embarrassed with regard to this particular one. </p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess.” Harry replied. This was truthful. Ginny liked sex. A lot. </p>
<p>“I think that’s what Ron and I are missing.” Hermione said, nodding sagely. “We love each other, but our passion doesn’t seem to extend into the bedroom. Ron isn’t… I don’t know, enthusiastic. We don’t try new things. It’s just stale.”</p>
<p>“Hermione, I’m really not sure I should be hearing this.” Harry warned. He felt almost as though he was betraying Ron just by hearing the details of his under-performance in the bedroom. </p>
<p>Hermione either did not hear his last remark or chose to ignore it. “It’s not stale for you and Ginny, is it?”</p>
<p>“Hermione…”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’ve gone too far. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable. I’ll stop asking questions.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled despite himself. Her penetrative question did make him somewhat uncomfortable, it was true. He had no great desire to hear about Ron and Hermione’s defective sex life, nor to divulge information about his own fruitful one. But this was Hermione’s nature. She had identified a problem, and she would not stop until she had devised a solution.</p>
<p>He reached out and touched her hand softly. His gesture was returned with a small smile. </p>
<p>“Okay, look. You can ask me whatever you want. I want to help. If this helps solve the problems you and Ron are having, I can cope, however embarrassing it is.”</p>
<p>Hermione beamed at him. “I can’t tell you how much I appreciate this, Harry. I promise I won’t make you answer anything you’re uncomfortable with. I just want me and Ron to be like you and Ginny.”</p>
<p>“Ask away, then.”</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, and her cheeks began to pinken again. “You and Ginny… what’s the key to your sex life? Do you, y’know, mix it up?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Okay, well I’ll be blunt. And you don’t have to answer this if you don’t want to. But, what are the most adventurous things you and Ginny do in the bedroom. To keep things from going stale?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Jeez, Hermione…” Harry puffed out his cheeks. “If I tell you this, you have to promise it doesn’t leave this room. This is pretty personal stuff.”</p>
<p>“I promise.” She said, and gripped his wrist tightly.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess we mix it up in terms of who’s in charge. Sometimes she’ll be in charge, other times I will be.”</p>
<p>“Interesting.” Hermione said. Harry could tell from the expression on her face that she was filing this information into her mental library. “What else?”</p>
<p>“Erm… okay, don’t be disgusted at this… but, sometimes we do it, y’know, up the bum.”</p>
<p>Harry noticed that Hermione was beginning to squirm in her seat. </p>
<p>“Ginny likes that?” Hermione asked breathlessly. </p>
<p>Harry snorted. To say that Ginny “liked” anal sex would be a gross under-statement. She loved it. She often begged for it, and Harry was happy to oblige. “It’s one of her favourites.”</p>
<p>“Ron has never been keen on the idea.” Hermione divulged.</p>
<p>“You’ve asked him to try it?” Harry asked, dumbstruck. Hermione, of all people, wanted to try anal sex?</p>
<p>She blushed furiously. “I was curious!”</p>
<p>By this point, Harry was beginning to wonder whether he was in a surreal dream. He’d known Hermione for two decades; an entirely new side to her character was revealing itself before her eyes.</p>
<p>Unwelcome images began to seep into his head. He’d never seen Hermione as anything other than a sister. He’d never seen her in sexualised terms. But now, inevitably, the image of Hermione bending over… presenting herself to him… begging him to do that  to her. </p>
<p>“Have you got any other questions?” He asked weakly, and he found that he hoped that she did. </p>
<p>“Only if you sure you’re okay with it,” she said. She was clearly conscious of the effect that her admission had had on him.</p>
<p>“Fire away.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” she said gratefully. “Again, you don’t have to answer this if you don’t want to. But, when you finish, where do you normally do it?”</p>
<p>Hermione was asking him where on or in his wife he preferred to ejaculate. This had to be a dream. </p>
<p>“We have a lot of places.” He said weakly.</p>
<p>“Give me your top three.”</p>
<p>“Erm, well she likes to taste it. So in her mouth quite a lot. In her arse, if we’re doing it that way. And please don’t feel less of me for saying this, but probably our most common is on her face.”</p>
<p>She was squirming in her chair more now. “Why would I think less of you for that?”</p>
<p>“Y’know, some women find it degrading.”</p>
<p>“And for others, that’s what makes it sexy.” Hermione pointed out.</p>
<p>“That’s what Ginny says.” Harry agreed. “I just wasn’t sure if you’d agree.”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>Merlin. Hermione’s sexual tastes certainly were adventurous. He would never have expected it.</p>
<p>More images began to flood into his head. He found now that he was hardly even trying to restrict them. She was on the floor in front of him, on her knees. The same position Ginny had been in hundreds of times for him. She was looking up at him. Her mouth was open, her tongue sticking out. </p>
<p>“Ron doesn’t like the idea of that either.” Hermione awoke him from his reverie. “He only really likes doing it inside. It’s the same every time.”</p>
<p>Harry reached over and clutched her. “Listen, Hermione. You have to tell him this. Try and persuade him to try some new things. It’s obvious that you’re not satisfied with how things are at the moment and if he’s not willing to experiment a bit to meet your needs, he doesn’t deserve you.</p>
<p>She nodded. “I’ll try,” she said. But she didn’t sound hopeful.</p>
<p>“If he doesn’t agree, maybe we can talk about this again another time.” Harry suggested. Despite his initial unease, he had enjoyed their conversation more than he cared to admit. </p>
<p>“Okay.” She said, and she smiled at him brilliantly. “Thank you so much for talking about this with me, Harry. I know this is new ground for us, but I just didn’t know who else I could turn to. And I just want to fix things with Ron. I really think that if we can sort things out in the bedroom, our problems will go away.”</p>
<p>“I hope they do.” Harry said. “And you know where to find me if things don’t change. We’ll find a way to solve this.”</p>
<p>“We will.” She smiled, and Harry thought she looked happier than she had done all night. </p>
<p>He got up from his chair and they embraced. </p>
<p>“I’d better be off then,” he said once they had pulled apart. “Ginny will be waiting for me.”</p>
<p>Hermione raised her eyebrows and said daringly: “I hope you two enjoy the rest of the night.”</p>
<p>Harry smirked and said, before disapparating: “Something tells me that we will.”</p>
