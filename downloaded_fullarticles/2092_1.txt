    <p> </p><p>Chapter One<br/>
Found</p><p> </p><p>Rain was bucketing down the city and Splinter was doing his very best to find anything that would serve a purpose in ensuring his young sons were cared for.  He didn’t do too bad, managing to find a number of items, be in food or other, but it still didn’t seem to be enough.<br/>

Then he heard it.  At first he wasn’t sure what it was and was prepared to ignore it, believing it was something else.  Yet, as he was about to turn away and head away, the same sound came, only it appeared to have multiplied.  With his keen ears he carefully followed the trail along the alleyway he was in, until he came upon a dumpster, where the sounds were now much clearer.<br/>

Opening the lid, Splinter nearly dropped it out of shock to the discovery; lying in soggy blankets, shivering and crying were a pair of very, very small babies.  Not even questioning on his next actions, the Mutant Rat quickly scoops up the precious little beings and tucked them against his warm fur and kimono and hurried to get them to his home underground.<br/>

Once there, he didn’t waste time in doing what he could to warm these infants up, whilst also doing his best to not disturb his four sleeping sons.  Discarding the wet blankets for fresh clean ones, ensuring they were nice and thick.  He also took notice that these babies were completely naked, (and that they were both female as a result), so he made the point of making some sort of makeshift cloth nappies, before wrapping them both firmly into the blankets.  These actions, in themselves, helped the babies to soften their cries, when they felt themselves warming up.<br/>

Splinter had to really think on what was safe for them to have to fill their tiny tummies.  He checked the fridge and saw a quarter full carton of goat’s milk, of all the luck, to find.  Knowing he couldn’t think of anything else that seemed remotely suitable, he snatched it out, grabbed a small cup – sterilised it as best as he could, warmed just enough of the milk up to the best of what he had, (putting the rest back in the fridge for later), selected small spoons of which he thought would be suitable for use and quickly made his way back to the babies, which he left in makeshift bed – which he made out of a large shallow laundry basket and enough blankets.<br/>

With just as gentle care, he made sure each baby got their fill of the goat milk.  Though it didn’t stop him from worrying and hoping that he wasn’t accidentally harming them by making sure they were looked after.<br/>

With some satisfaction, but no trace of his worry going, Splinter contently placed the now sleeping babies in their laundry basket crib.  He made a quick check in with his four sons, all of them still very much asleep in their beds; he noticed that Michelangelo, the youngest, had crawled in with the eldest Leonardo.  Not wanting to disturb them, the father rat went back to where the babies were and got comfortable on the couch.</p><p>###</p><p>“They can’t have just disappeared!” Severus Snape strained; his voice frantic.<br/>

“Don’t you think I don’t know that?” says Remus Lupin, just as anxious.  “They were in their beds, you saw them yourself, Severus! I don’t know what happened!”<br/>

The two men were on their way the one person they thought might be able to help.  Severus stopped and turned face Remus, who was not too far behind.<br/>

“How could you not know? They were in the safe house! Which was provided to us, to make sure they, we, were kept from being exposed to those who would love to get their hands on them and potentially kill us to ensure we didn’t get in their way?”<br/>

Remus gapped at the other man for a moment.  “You honestly believe that after every precaution that we have made to ensure our daughters are safe that I wouldn’t keep doing that? I was checking on our girls for every thirty minutes for heaven sake!”<br/>

“Yeah... and then you fell asleep!”<br/>

“That’s not fair, Severus, and you know it!”<br/>

Severus knew that it wasn’t fair to have said that to Remus, but he was deeply afraid right now and couldn’t help it.  Remus knew, but it didn’t stop him from being stung.<br/>

They finally reached the house they intended to get to and banged on the door.<br/>

Within moments the door was opened and Albus Dumbledore stood before the two men, with his elegant robes of midnight blue and long silvery beard.<br/>

“Severus? Remus? What on earth brings you hear at this time of night?”<br/>

“We need your help!” Remus says; urgency in his tone.<br/>

“Our daughters have been kidnapped!” Severus didn’t waste time.<br/>

“Kidnapped?” Dumbledore frowns slightly.  “Are you sure?”<br/>

Severus explains; “I came home after finishing the assignment you wanted me to do, and when I went to check on them, they weren’t in their room.  I checked to see if Remus had them, but he was fast asleep.”<br/>

“Did you hear anyone coming in?” Dumbledore asks.<br/>

Remus glumly shook his head.  “I am afraid not.”<br/>

Seeing the desperation on their faces, Dumbledore stepped back and told them to come in.<br/>

“We will find your daughters,” he assures.</p><p>###</p><p>Splinter woke up to see that his sons had all woken up and made their way into the living area, where he had chosen to stay, to be close to the babies.  His sleep wasn’t deep, but enough to feel somewhat rested, especially when the babies stirred on and off, wanting to be cared for.<br/>

He was grateful that his four turtles decided to stay quiet, but he wasn’t sure just how long they were up for.<br/>

“Good morning my sons,” he says lightly, blinking a few times until he was sure to have his eyes as open as he could get them.<br/>

“What are they?” Raphael asks, pointing at the babies.<br/>

“They are babies,” Splinter says, with a small smile.<br/>

“Where did they come from?” asked Leonardo.<br/>

“I found them while I was out looking for supplies and I had to help them,” said Splinter.<br/>

“Where are their daddy?” this was Michelangelo.<br/>

“Or mommy?” Donatello says.<br/>

Splinter shakes his head.  “I am uncertain on what has happened to have me find these two, but I knew I had to make sure they were safe.”<br/>

The babies themselves were sleeping rather peacefully; one of them was sucking on her fist, while the other just had her hands up over her tiny face.  Now that there was a little more light – their Lair seemed to have a natural skylight of sorts in varying areas, (but made so that rain didn’t come in and ruin the place) – Splinter was able to have a slightly better look at the pair.<br/>

They had fair skin, but he couldn’t help but notice that there were some faint markings in varying areas about their bodies, such as their temples and elbows.  He didn’t notice them at first, but then he was too concerned to ensure they weren’t going to die to really see anything of clear interest.  The markings didn’t appear to be bruising, if anything, they looked almost like birthmarks... or scales...?<br/>

Every feature the babies had was identical, from the same darkish blonde coloured hair, the same noses that each had a small hook-shape in their bridges, interesting on how it seemed to really suit them.  Splinter knew that there just had to be a way to tell them apart, but for now, he had other matters to attend to, such as sorting out breakfast for his sons and then figuring out what is was to do about the two babies.<br/>

In his mind, he wanted to take them to the nearest hospital or fire station drop off, but his gut was telling him not to, as if there was some instinct trying to explain that these girls would be better off with him and his turtles.  He still also had to finish the supply run he had to cut short.  So much to do, so much to think, but right now, all he could do for now was simply go to the kitchen and cook up some rolled oats to give to his four boys.</p><p>###</p><p>“I may have a lead,” Dumbledore announces, walking into the house Severus and Remus occupied together; the very same house that was meant to be a safe haven until recently.<br/>

“Really? You found our girls?” Remus asked eagerly.<br/>

“Where are they?”<br/>

Dumbledore held up a hand, a signal to tell the young men to calm.  “I’ve been told they were taken to New York in the United States.”<br/>

“New York!?” cried the men in shock.<br/>

“How?”<br/>

“Who?”<br/>

Again the older wizard placed his hand up.<br/>

“As you already know when you came to me with the news of your missing daughters, I don’t know who took them, or even why! Let alone how! Only that I did remind you over and over on the risk it would be to have them in the first place, and that there are those who would sort opportunity to steal them,” Dumbledore’s tone giving a sort of firmness.  “I have only been given a location of where they are, and if you are willing, I would gladly give the exact map on where they are likely to be.  I would lead you there myself, if you wish.”<br/>

Not even questioning on how their old Headmaster even got the information, Severus and Remus were just eager to get to their children.</p><p>###</p><p>“Why are we in an alleyway?” Remus questions, frowning at Dumbledore.<br/>

Dumbledore returns the younger man’s concerning face with a sort of comforting face.<br/>

“It’s just where I was told we may find them,” he simply says.<br/>

Severus was already looking around the place.  Puddles of last night’s rain were still pooled in varying areas and the stench that was coming from the dumpster – which was completely full and near overflowing - didn’t help.<br/>

“In an alleyway?” Remus didn’t retreat from his frown.<br/>

“You mean to say that whoever took them, exchanged them to someone else in this alley?” Severus decides to ask, clearly unsure on what else to go on right now.<br/>

Dumbledore shifts for a moment, about to answer the fully black wearing wizard, but was interrupted by the sound of something that was very, very familiar to the young man, as well as the other.<br/>

“That sounds like...” Remus goes to say.<br/>

“Freya!” Severus finishes looking about for the location of the cry.<br/>

“Are you sure?” Dumbledore asks; neither Severus, nor Remus, noticed the change in expression on the old man.<br/>

“Positive!”<br/>

“But I don’t hear anything,” says Dumbledore, shaking his head a little.  “Perhaps it’s some other baby; we are in a busy city after all.”<br/>

“Maybe...” said Severus, rather doubtfully.<br/>

“Are you sure this is where they were taken to?” Remus pressed.<br/>

“It is what I was told, Remus.  Someone saw someone rather suspicious around the area and when their back was turned, the babies were gone,” Dumbledore tells the two worried fathers.<br/>

“That is something you left out,” said Severus.<br/>

“Left what out?”<br/>

“The part about someone taking our daughters from whoever saw them and however they ended up here.”<br/>

“I must have forgotten,” said Dumbledore.<br/>

“How can you forget?” Remus asked.<br/>

The cries happened again, this time it was closer.<br/>

“Now that is definitely Freya!” Remus exclaims.<br/>

“Sounds like Athena as well,” Severus adds, noting a second, but slightly softer, cry.<br/>

They sounded as though they were being echoed.<br/>

Just then, not far from where the men were standing, they heard a scraping sound.  Turning, they see a manhole cover being pushed up and aside.  Then, catching virtually everyone by surprise, a great big rat’s head and torso, with one of his hands on the ground around the manhole, pops straight on up.<br/>
Splinter was, unsurprisingly, alarmed when he saw three wands pointed at him.<br/>

“I wouldn’t do that if I were you!” he dares to speak.  Normally he would be popping straight back down and hurrying away, but somehow this seemed different, so he took the risk of more exposure, and fully stepped out of the hole in the ground, levelling with the three strangers before him.<br/>

“And why wouldn’t we?” Dumbledore asks.<br/>

Cries were then heard once again.  It was upon this, when Severus and Remus saw the makeshift baby carrier secured to the five foot tall rat’s chest.<br/>

“You’re the one who stole our children?” Severus suddenly accused.<br/>

Splinter frowns deeply; “I abhor to kidnapping of innocent children.  No, I found them in that dumpster shivering and starving.”  He points to the overflowing dumpster.  “I do not know how these angel girls came to be in there, but I know my morals and wasn’t about to allow them to suffer, unlike the akuma who just left them there.”<br/>

This surprised both Remus and Severus, mixed with their emotions upon hearing this.<br/>

“You... you looked after them? Our daughters?” Remus wanted to be sure he heard right.<br/>

“Yes,” said Splinter.  “I returned here, to see if I could find any clues as to who or how these two got in the predicament, knowing they wouldn’t have done it on their own.  Convenient how I find you three gentlemen here when I do arrive.”<br/>

“Are you accusing us of doing this to our own daughters?” Severus spat.  “We find they are taken from their beds, led here by a tip off our friend here learns about, and then you accuse us -?”<br/>

“Where in my words have I blamed you for your children winding up here?” Splinter returns, though a little perplexed to hear two of the gentlemen both laying claim to the two babies, but decided to not go into it and deciding right then and there that it didn’t even matter, he could hear the very tones true parents would often express in such situations as this one; no doubt he, himself, would be of similar sorts if any of his four young ones were in trouble.<br/>

Severus stopped before he could answer, because he then thought over what had been said in that short space of time.  He then takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself.<br/>

“I am sorry, this experience has just taken us out of our depths,” he then says, sincerely.<br/>

“May we have our daughters back?” Remus then asks.<br/>

Splinter doesn’t hesitate on this request.  His heart warmed a little when he saw the two men take their two daughters and held them firmly against their chests, make shift blankets and all.<br/>

“It seems very lucky that you came when you did... er... what is your name?” Dumbledore then decides to speak after being quiet for a while, observing the scene before him.<br/>

“Splinter,” said Splinter, twitching his tail a little.  “I don’t know if luck had anything to do with it.  I, myself, am a father, and was simply trying to find supplies to feed my own children, it was chance that I was here last night, especially when it was raining for most of the night.”<br/>

“You have children?” Dumbledore says.<br/>

It seemed almost too simultaneous when the old man said it, because at that moment, a toddler sized turtle, wearing an orange bandanna came up from the manhole.<br/>

“Splinter! Raph won’t let me have a turn of the skateboard!”<br/>

“It’s still my turn, Mikey!” a voice calls up rather loudly.<br/>

Mikey looks back down the hole he was halfway out of; “You had it for ages!”<br/>

“Have not!”<br/>

Remus had to do his best to suppress a laugh just then.<br/>

“I think that answers your question, Albus,” said Severus, surprised by his own amusement by what he was seeing in front of him.<br/>

Dumbledore didn’t betray anything by withholding all emotion.<br/>

“Again, it was a good thing that you were there to help the infants,” he simply said.<br/>

“Indeed,” said Splinter, studying this older man a little.  “But as much as I would like to stay around and talk more, I have obligations to attend to.  Plus I believe you would like to take your young ones home.”<br/>

“Thank you, Splinter,” said Remus.<br/>

Splinter simply nods and turns to retreat down the manhole, where his young son was still located and seeming to be observing these strangers.<br/>

“I still would like to know their names!” Michelangelo then says.  “Splinter named them Asami and Kazumi because we didn’t know what else to name them.”<br/>

“Yeah, because it was way better than Sprite and Pixie,” spoke a voice, which belonged to another toddler sized turtle wearing purple. “That is what you wanted to name them, Michelangelo!”<br/>

“You wanted to go with Arsenic and Mercury, Donatello!” Michelangelo fired back.<br/>

“Hey! You actually said those two words right!” Donatello grinned.<br/>

“I did?” Michelangelo replied.<br/>

Donatello nods.  “Yep!”<br/>

Glee was written on the young orange wearing turtle’s face.<br/>

Splinter places a hand to his face.<br/>

“Asami and Kazumi?” Severus decides to intervene to save Splinter any further grief from the two young boys.<br/>

“Japanese names, from where I am originally from,” Splinter explains.<br/>

“What do they mean?”<br/>

“Asami means morning beauty, and Kazumi means harmonious beauty.”<br/>

“Asami is the one you’re holding,” Michelangelo says to Remus.<br/>

“Her actual name, since you asked, is Freya,” said Remus, “and this is Athena,” indicating to the baby Severus was holding.<br/>

“Nice names,” Donatello comments.<br/>

“Now that you have your answers, it is now time for us to go,” said Splinter to his two sons.<br/>

“But will we get to see Freya and Athena again?” Michelangelo blurts, looking from his father to Severus, Remus and Dumbledore, sounding as though he didn’t want them to go.<br/>

Remus and Severus looked at each other, looking as though they were locked in some sort of mental conversation.<br/>

“I don’t think that is wise,” said Dumbledore.  “These girls are way too special to be around just anyone.”<br/>

“That is not your decision to make our behalf, Albus,” Severus speaks in a stern tone.<br/>

Remus addresses the now four Turtles; Leonardo and Raphael got tired of waiting down below and decided they wanted to see what their brothers were seeing, too.  

“Tell you what, for now we will take them home to England with us, where they belong.  We can set up a way so you can keep in contact and when they are a little older you might be able to see them? If that is permitted by your father.”<br/>

“Please Master Splinter!”<br/>

Splinter could see how keen these children were.  He was determined to keep his children safe and hidden, but this placed him a position he hadn’t counted on before.  While he still didn’t understand how the babies got to where they did, but it did lead to now, and his gut was telling him that they were okay... well most of them, he still wasn’t too sure about the older man who was with them.<br/>

“I believe such an arrangement can be made,” he then decides to say.<br/>

After a few quick exchanges of goodbyes, Splinter herded his sons down the manhole to head home to their underground him, while Remus and Severus eagerly went to get their daughters home, with Dumbledore slowly following behind them.</p>
