    <p>This was an ending.<br/>
<br/>
Not for the first time, the realisation hit me like a Whomping Willow branch to the stomach. I stood in my bedroom and stared around at the prim décor, soft in the morning summer light. The bed was made, the pastel green blanket piled with sleek, fawn-brown cushions. The study desk, for once, was tidy. I’d packed away my parchments, removed the ink splotches with Mrs Skower’s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, and my books were back in the cherry wood shelves that took up one wall of the room. Mum and Dad hadn’t let me have more than one bookshelf.<br/>
<br/>
‘It’s a fire hazard,’ Dad always said, and he remained infuriatingly stubborn about it.<br/>
<br/>
I’d be returning here, of course. But this was, technically, the last time I could call myself a citizen of the muggle world. When I graduated, I’d be a witch first and foremost.<br/>
<br/>
It left an ache in me, but a thrill at the same time, like an exhilarated gasp unable to break free. I was leaving my childhood behind.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming I made it past June 30th.<br/>
<br/>
<em>No.</em><br/>
<br/>
I curled my fists. No giving up. It was my one rule.<br/>
<br/>
I whispered goodbye to my room and lugged my trunk down the stairs to where my parents were waiting. Dad was misty-eyed. They hadn't planned to send me to boarding school. If I hadn’t been a witch, we never would’ve been so far apart.<br/>
<br/>
And what sort of distance would separate us once I got a job in the wizarding world?<br/>
<br/>
‘Haven’t forgotten anything?’ Dad said, taking the trunk from me. His voice was croaky.<br/>
<br/>
Crookshanks lazed in a pool of sunlight by the front window; I hauled him into my arms, his warm weight a comfort. It gave me the strength to answer without being croaky myself. ‘Everything’s checked off the list.’<br/>
<br/>
‘Good girl,’ Mum said. She patted my cheek. My parents weren’t particularly versed in physical affection.<br/>
<br/>
‘And you’re sure you don’t want to come home for Christmas?’ Dad said.<br/>
<br/>
‘Not this year,’ I said. ‘Not with my N.E.W.T.s.’<br/>
<br/>
Mum and Dad chuckled at this. They’d always found wizarding things charming. Magic – newts – <em>funny</em>. They wouldn’t be laughing if they knew the amount of study that went into passing the seventh year.<br/>
<br/>
Mum walked with us to the car. She had to work, so after a brisk goodbye she left, and it was just me, Dad, and Crookshanks.<br/>
<br/>
The drive was about half an hour. Dad asked if I wanted him to go to Platform 9 and three quarters with me, and I almost said yes.<br/>
<br/>
But I wasn’t sure whether my bravery would hold up if he came with me. Would I cry and tell him everything as I boarded the train? Would my summer of careful, secret research – and my plans for the rest of the year – be ruined for this one moment of weakness?<br/>
<br/>
I pictured his expression if I were to tell him the truth. The expression I would have to live with for almost a year, seared into my mind.<br/>
<br/>
No. He didn’t have to come with me. We parted ways. It took all my strength not to look back.<br/>
<br/>
The bustling atmosphere of King’s Cross changed the instant I stepped onto the Hogwarts Express platform. While the noises were the same as always – the hiss of steam, the hoot of owls, the chatter of children – the people weren’t. Most faces were sombre; adults spoke in hushed tones. The younger students still ran around laughing. They didn’t really understand.<br/>
<br/>
Many people wore black armbands over their wizard robes. Harry and Ron did, too.<br/>
<br/>
‘Here,’ Ron said, passing me one as soon as I joined them on the platform. ‘Mum’s got a bunch.’<br/>
<br/>
Harry’s face was wan. He looked like he’d lost weight over the summer.<br/>
<br/>
‘How are you?’ I said, setting down my trunk and Crookshanks’s basket to hug him.<br/>
<br/>
‘Oh… you know.’ He tried to smile, but I could see the effort it cost him.<br/>
<br/>
‘Grimmauld Place was okay?’<br/>
<br/>
The attempted smile turned into a grimace. ‘As okay as expected, with Kreacher and Mrs Black still rattling around. But at least it wasn’t my aunt and uncle’s place.’<br/>
<br/>
None of us brought up Professor Dumbledore, even as I slipped on the armband.<br/>
<br/>
‘How was your summer?’ Ron said. ‘I didn’t hear from you.’ His grin was a little less forced than Harry’s. ‘Expect you were doing all the N.E.W.T. readings, yeah? You’d probably be able to pass the exams already.’<br/>
<br/>
‘Shut up, Ron,’ I said, giving him a not-too gentle punch on the arm, and it felt good, for that one moment, to be with my ridiculous friends again.<br/>
<br/>
The moment was wrenched from me when I spotted a shock of blond hair in the crowd. My good humour crumbled.<br/>
<br/>
‘What’s <em>he</em> doing here?’<br/>
<br/>
Harry let out a long sigh as we watched Malfoy slouch onto a carriage. ‘Mr Weasley told me he managed to worm his way out of a real prison sentence because he didn’t actually do anything.’<br/>
<br/>
‘Didn’t…?’ I spluttered, momentarily unable to find words. ‘He pointed his wand with the intent to kill!’<br/>
<br/>
‘Yes, but he didn’t go through with it. The Wizengamont took into account his history and his position…’ Harry gave a one-shouldered shrug and ruffled his hair. ‘They sentenced him to spend the summer in Azkaban, at least.’<br/>
<br/>
My indignation calmed somewhat. ‘Oh. That’s better than nothing, I suppose.’<br/>
<br/>
‘Wonder what those Dementors are like now you-know-who is gone,’ Ron said.<br/>
<br/>
‘Ron.’ I exchanged an exasperated grin with Harry. ‘Voldermort’s dead. You can say his name as much as you like now.’<br/>
<br/>
‘Yeah, but…’ Ron lowered his voice, glancing around furtively. <em>‘Ghosts.’</em><br/>
<br/>
It was enough to get us laughing again, and we boarded the train in a better mood. Ginny joined us after prying herself away from her multitude of friends. Harry put his arm around her as she sat next to him by the window.<br/>
<br/>
‘You’ll never guess who’s our new DADA professor,’ she said, eyes shining.<br/>
<br/>
‘I’m just glad it’s anyone but Snape,’ Harry said.<br/>
<br/>
‘I’d take the giant squid as a professor over Snape,’ Ron said.<br/>
<br/>
‘Boys!’ I didn’t so much say it as snap it. Both of them stared at me. I pointed to my armband. ‘A little respect for the dead, please.’<br/>
<br/>
‘Murderers don’t deserve respect,’ Harry said coolly.<br/>
<br/>
Ron reached for my armband. ‘If he’s why you’re wearing it, I want it back.’<br/>
<br/>
I wrenched my arm away, glowering. ‘You know he only killed Professor Dumbledore because he was asked to.’<br/>
<br/>
‘Sure, sure, he was working for the good guys all along.’ Harry gave a dismissive wave. ‘Doesn’t make up for everything he did beforehand.’<br/>
<br/>
I curled my hand over my heart, where the burn mark still scorched my skin. Harry was right – Professor Snape had been truly awful for the entire time we’d known him. But in the end, the man had died because he’d chosen to save my life over escaping Voldermort.<br/>
<br/>
Well, not save my life. Prolong my death was a more accurate way of describing it.<br/>
<br/>
Didn’t that make him… not a saint, but perhaps, not evil? I wasn’t sure. Never had the line between good and bad been so blurred.<br/>
<br/>
‘Hello?’ Ginny said after a stretch of silence. ‘Focus here, people. New DADA professor.’<br/>
<br/>
‘Hey, how do you know, anyway?’ Harry said. ‘I’ve been trying to pry that information out of McGonagall all summer.’<br/>
<br/>
‘I used my wily ways,’ Ginny said, wiggling her eyebrows.<br/>
<br/>
‘On Professor McGonagall?’<br/>
<br/>
Ginny tossed her shiny red hair and laughed. ‘It’s Lupin.’<br/>
<br/>
<em>‘What?’</em> the three of us said together.<br/>
<br/>
‘Better believe it. With Mr Malfoy off the school board, no one else had a problem asking him to come back.’ She clapped her hands. ‘DADA is finally going to be good again!’<br/>
<br/>
Considering our last two teachers had been Professor Snape and Umbridge, it was an understatement. I smiled to myself. It would be good to have Lupin around, especially this year.<br/>
<br/>
The thing I’d worried about most during the train trip was having an attack. I’d only had a two over the summer, and I had no idea if or when another one was due. It would be difficult hiding them in Hogwarts, but impossible on the train. How could I explain randomly falling to the floor in agony without telling the others my secret?<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, we arrived at Hogsmeade station without any problems, and I almost staggered off the carriage in my haste to break free of the confined space.<br/>
<br/>
Harry dropped his trunk to steady me. ‘You okay?’<br/>
<br/>
‘Eager to get to classes?’ Ron said with a teasing grin. ‘You know they don’t start ‘til tomorrow, right?’<br/>
<br/>
‘You’re so funny, Ron,’ Ginny said, deadpan.<br/>
<br/>
‘Hey, hey, hey.’ Seamus and Dean raced up to us with the air of two people who were desperate to spill gossip.<br/>
<br/>
‘You’ll never guess,’ Dean said.<br/>
<br/>
‘We already know Professor Lupin is our DADA teacher,’ I said.<br/>
<br/>
‘No, it’s – What? Seriously?’ Dean let out a whoop and high fived Seamus.<br/>
<br/>
‘No, but really,’ Seamus said. ‘You want to hear even better news?’ He leaned in so we all had to gather around to hear him. ‘No one let Malfoy sit in their carriage.’<br/>
<br/>
Ron moved away, scoffing. ‘What about Crabbe and Goyle?’<br/>
<br/>
‘As if,’ Dean said. ‘He turned on his “Death Eater” duties. They don’t want him. And Pansy Parkinson doesn’t want him now he’s a loser. Well,’ he amended, ‘more of a loser than usual.’<br/>
<br/>
‘Even Millicent Bulstrode wouldn’t have him,’ Seamus said, and he and Dean sniggered.<br/>
<br/>
‘Serves him right,’ Ginny said.<br/>
<br/>
‘He had to sit in the corridor the whole trip,’ Seamus said. ‘Almost fell over him on my way to the bathroom.’<br/>
<br/>
I caught sight of Malfoy then, trudging across the platform, dragging his trunk behind him. His head was bowed and his white fringe fell over most of his face. There was no sign of his eagle owl.<br/>
<br/>
It was easy to hate him when he was cocky and proud. I reminded myself of the things he’d called me over the years; of the horrific way he’d behaved. But pity nudged me, all the same. He looked so… broken. Had Azkaban done that to him?<br/>
<br/>
‘Not so arrogant now, is he?’ Seamus said.<br/>
<br/>
‘I heard he’s a child of the state now,’ Ginny said. ‘Because all his family’s in jail.’<br/>
<br/>
Harry took her trunk with his own and led her towards a horseless carriage. ‘Seriously, how are you getting this info?’<br/>
<br/>
He’d grown noticeably less sickly in her presence. She was good like that.<br/>
<br/>
They kept chatting as they climbed in. Ron gestured for me to go ahead of him, and Seamus and Dean gleefully hurried away to spread the word about Malfoy’s lonely train ride.<br/>
<br/>
I found myself looking at Malfoy again as he tried to get a horseless carriage. People kept closing the door on him. He sighed each time but seemed unsurprised.<br/>
<br/>
After the fourth shut door, he happened to glance my way. Our gazes caught. His desolate expression morphed to a scowl, and he turned away.<br/>
<br/>
Guess a stint in Azkaban hadn’t changed him, after all.</p>
