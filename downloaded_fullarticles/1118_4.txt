<p>Harry opened his eyes suddenly in surprise, trying not to choke on the coffee he’d been in the middle of sipping. </p>
<p>
  <em>Bzzzzzzt</em>
</p>
<p>Across the table from him, Ron and Hermione each checked their phones, before looking at Harry expectantly. Harry set down his coffee cup and fidgeted in his seat. “....it’s Tom,” he admitted nervously, shifting in his seat again.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>His friends continued to wait. Harry looked down, adjusting his position in his seat.</p>
<p>
  <em>Bzzzzzzt</em>
</p>
<p>“Well, aren’t you going to answer him?” Hermione demanded hotly, obviously considering it the height of rudeness to ignore a phone call.</p>
<p>Harry wiggled in his seat, pulling out his phone-</p>

  <em>Bzzzzzzt</em>
</p>
<p>-which lay silently in his hand.</p>
<p>“He’s, err… He’s not calling,” Harry admitting, shifting in his seat again.</p>
