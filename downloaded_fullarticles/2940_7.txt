<p>The hustle and bustle of the winter season was upon the magical word, most people had been getting their last minute shopping in, but most people weren't Hermione Granger. She was at the Lotus Children's Home she founded when she left Hogwarts, it was a foster home and orphanage for the children victims of the last war. It was a lot of hard work but she enjoyed it, the job was very rewarding on its own. She knew that she could make more in the Ministry which had been her original work plan, but she knew that it would have been something that was as amazing as this was.</p>
<p>At that, Hermione was pushing herself to get everything ready for the Christmas Eve party that she was throwing at the home. The children had been very excited about it, especially since the other two members of the trio would be there as well. This would have been Harry's first time shouldn't up at the home, and she really hoped that he would be impressed. Ron didn't go the first Christmas Eve party that Lotus Children's Home had because of their somewhat recent breakup but he came to every one since then. He and George are very supportive of the home.</p>
<p>This would be the first time that Ron brought a guest though. Luckily, Katie Bell thought that the idea was of the home was amazing, and didn't mind sharing her boyfriend for the night. Unlike Harry's ex-girlfriend Ginny Weasley who refused to share Harry and said that the Holidays were only for family. Once, Ginny and she had graduated Hogwarts their friendship deteriorated, the younger girl became distance and more controlling over Harry. The bad part is that Harry allowed it to happen, and he only really seen Ron at Weasley family events and Hermione if he ran into her. It was almost like Ginny was jealous, which didn't make much sense.</p>
<p>In fact, Hermione eventually stopped trying to keep in contact which is why it came as a shock to her when he asked her to join him for Christmas Eve. The funny part was her reply to him, which was 'Do you have Ginny's permission.' Harry didn't think that it was funny and informed her that they had broken up much earlier that year.</p>
<p>She couldn't wait for this to be ready for the children. It didn't take that long to finish getting all the decorations and the food organized. Every year she did this and every year and every time she still got a bit nervous about getting everything perfect. It was just that these kids lost so much that she wants to make things as good for them as possible. They deserved that. After setting the heating spell on the food, she quickly gets ready for the occasion.</p>
<p>"Ms. Granger the children are very excitable about the party I am not sure I can control them much longer," Flora Carrow told her, she had joined on as a house parent when she left Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"Very well, you can go ahead and send them into the lobby," Hermione replied.</p>
<p>"Of course, also little Nathan is upset again," she told the older girl as she went to direct the children.</p>
<p>"I will talk to him," Hermione answered as followed Flora to the playroom.</p>
<p>As Flora steered the children to the lobby, Hermione approached the young Nathan. He had been having problems ever since the Ministry allowed his baby sister and him to be separated. Hermione and her staff had fought that but lost.</p>
<p>"Nathan come here," she called to him.</p>
<p>"I don't want to,"  the young boy replied.</p>
<p>"Why not?" Hermione asked him as she went to sit beside him.</p>
<p>"I don't have my mommy and daddy and now take took my sister away," he told her.</p>
<p>"We are working hard to fix that Nathan," she let him know.</p>
<p>"I just want them back," he sniffled.</p>
<p>"I know you do, everyone here wants to make things right for you, come down to the Lobby with me," Hermione stood up and held out her head and led him to the lobby before he ran off with a friend.</p>
<p>The kids were all running around, but at least now they were all generally well behaved. Technically the party would be starting soon, but with the children having fun it felt like it already started. Everything was already in place, so she just relaxed until the other guests showed up.</p>
<p>Flora's twin sister Hestia showed up. Both girls were in the Slug Club with her, both were in Slytherin, and a few years younger than her. Flora was more maternal and understanding, while Hestia was a bit more snooty and cold. While Hestia the younger of the two had never been rude to her the younger twin certainly had never been friendly either. The Carrow Twins were both circling the lobby while talking to the children and the other staff members.</p>
<p>The main donor of the Lotus Children's Home walked in and all the children ran to the silver-blond male as he has his house elves pass out presents to them. Hermione couldn't say that she approved but at least he treated the house elves well and the kids were happy.</p>
<p>"Granger," he greeted walking up to her.</p>
<p>"Malfoy, thank you so much for the donation," she welcomed back.</p>
<p>"I like the idea of my father's money going somewhere that he would have hated," he replied glancing behind her before placing a chaste kiss on her cheek.</p>
<p>"Did Astoria not want to come with you?" she asked looking at the man who changed so much since they were at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"We broke up, and it really upset my mother," Draco stated as if he didn't really care, before addressing the person she didn't know was behind her. "Potter."</p>
<p>"Malfoy," Harry acknowledged, as the five-year-old in his arm waved his toward the light haired man.</p>
<p>"Cousin!"</p>
<p>"Hey Teddy, how is my favorite cousin," he asked the kid.</p>
<p>Teddy started laughing and giggling as Draco kiss the boy on the forehead and waved them off.</p>
<p>"Your here," Hermione stated.</p>
<p>"I am," Harry responded.</p>
<p>Even with the weight of holding his godson in his arms, Harry looked better than ever, even if he looked a bit tired. She had always knew that he was a good looking guy and she might have even had a crush on him before she started liking Ron, but the flutter in her stomach was different this time. This felt different from before, but she was determined to ignore it. She didn't want to mess up him coming back into her life. Before would have kissed him on the cheek or hugged him, but she also had not seen him for a while and he was carrying Teddy.</p>
<p>"So, you know Malfoy he is the main donor for the home," as she said this she could have sworn she seen a fast flash of a frown on his face, but it was so fast she couldn't be sure. "You remember the Carrow twins?" she asked as he nodded, "Well, Flora works here as a house parent," she added as she walked around the lobby and told him more about the home, the kids, and the people who worked here.</p>
<p>"Ms. G, can you hold me?" Little Chloe came up with her arms out.  </p>
<p>"Of course Chloe," she said as she picked the little girl. Chloe wrapped on arm around her neck as she leaned her head under Hermione's neck with her thumb in her mouth.</p>
<p>Taking her thumb out of her mouth, "Your Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"I am," he replied.</p>
<p>"Who are you," she pointed at Teddy.</p>
<p>"I'm Teddy, who are you?" He questioned back.</p>
<p>"Chloe."</p>
<p>The two children talked animatedly back and fore in the older pair's arms.</p>
<p>Harry was obviously very good with children with the way that he handled Teddy and the children at the home. He was someone who would obviously make a good father figure, and that was very attractive in a man. The young woman could feel her body temperature warm up a bit, she hoped her face wasn't red. The heart in her chest was thumping quite quickly.</p>
<p>"Are you okay Hermione?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"I'm fine just a bit heated, I think I will just get some air outside really quick," as she put Chloe down a move which her friend followed, they watched the two run to a group of other children before moving to the entrance. Harry's hand sat on her lower back as they made their way outdoors.</p>
<p>As soon as the door closed a redhead and blonde walked up.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Ron jogged forward and kissed Hermione on the cheek then smacked Harry on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"Glad your here Ron!" Hermione greeted back.</p>
<p>"Hey mate," Harry responded.</p>
<p>"You both remember Katie Bell right?" He introduced their old classmate to them.</p>
<p>"I do, I'm so glad you came Katie," Hermione thanked.</p>
<p>"Hey Katie, long time," Harry welcomed.</p>
<p>"Thanks Hermione, I am happy to be here. It has been a long time Harry, we will have to catch up soon."</p>
<p>"Certainly," Harry said.</p>
<p>"We will meet you inside, I want to pick on the midgets," Ron joked as Hermione shook her head.</p>
<p>"Don't start a fight with Malfoy again this year," Hermione called back after him.</p>
<p>After a few minutes the two of them joined the party, and the kids had all already started eating. So, after everyone else was served is when the two of them grabbed a plate.</p>
<p>"Wow, who made this Holiday Roast?" Harry asked her.</p>
<p>"I did, I wanted to make it special for the children. What do you think of it?" She asked back.</p>
<p>"This was really good, I didn't know you could cook," He stated.</p>
<p>"Well, one can't get take away every night, so I got some tips from Molly and practiced," she laughed.</p>
<p>"Hey Hermione! If I knew you could cook that well I would have kept you around longer" Ron yells as some people laughed as Katie punches his arm.</p>
<p>The night came and the party had come down to the end Hermione and her staff was cleaning up for the night while Floria and a few other of the house parents gathered up the children for their bedtime. Harry and Teddy had already left to go to Andromeda's where she would meet up with the three of them.</p><hr class="hr"/>
