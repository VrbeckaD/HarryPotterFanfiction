    <p>
  <span>I was his passion project, his idea on a whim decided one July day. His theory, his experiment. His favorite little muggle, his girl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They kidnapped me on my 14th birthday, in the middle of the night. I remember the black cloaked men pulling me out of my bed with their wands at my throat, silencing me with their magic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I cried and cried and cried, wanting to get out of their grasp and back to my family who were still sleeping in their beds. But the cloaked figures wouldn't allow it, and I was taken away from my home and back with them to theirs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I was one of 20 girls they kidnapped, all with no special or magical abilities and so many questions. They kept us all in a basement cellar, and one by one they would take us out for a couple hours and put us through extreme simulations and tests. Situations that would push your mental, physical, and emotional limits. Some would come back down to the cellar, some would not, but soon enough there were only ten of us left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The challenges soon became different, and it was no longer an individual test that would lead your death. Instead, it evolved to putting two of us in a massive cage.  They would leave us there for days on end with nothing but each other, and when we would beg for food or they would tell us one thing. “Only one of you can leave, only one of you can survive, kill or be killed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I didn’t attempt to murder my opponent at first, trying to find any other way. But when she was on top of me, about to strangle me to death, something happened. An instinct kicked in I had never felt before, a feeling that I needed to stay alive no matter the costs. So I kicked her off of me, knocking her unconscious, and put my foot to cut off her air supply. I kept it there until she was no longer breathing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>One by one the fights kept happening, some with me in and some without. But soon enough there were only two of us left, the best two, the two with the most to live for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The fight was long and hard, and quite bloody. But in the end, I won by strangling her. I watched her life drain away by just a squeeze of my fingers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> I was overjoyed when I realized it and finally felt like this was my ticket out of the hell hole my last year had been. But that was when the cloaked figures sat me down and gave me a simple explanation, I was never going to leave.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then they told me they were wizards, magical people who have special abilities. And therefore they were above me, and I was below them. I was to obey and stay with them, or they would hurt me in ways I didn’t even know existed. I laughed, like I would believe them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t until they waved their wands that I saw the truth in their words. With a simple phrase, I could feel unbearable pain, almost like I was being burned alive. I screamed at first, falling to the ground in agony. But my screams turned to whimpers as I just thrashed in pain on the floor. Because it was then I realized these special people would never let me go. If they held this much power in a flick of the wrist, who knows what they could do to me when they really tried. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But they wanted me for something, I could tell. They didn’t put me through those tests, to prove I was the strongest, for nothing. So when the horrible curse was removed from me, I shakily got back up, asking them one simple question. “What do you want with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And with that, the figures took me to the mastermind of my existence, the man that would become my world and my worst nightmare all in one. The one and only Lord Voldemort.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>—————————————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I remember our introduction as it was yesterday. His cloaked soldiers lead my weak form to another room, one where there seemed to be a giant throne with a figure sitting on top. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man’s face sent shivers down my spine. With his chilling white skin, snake and human features, as well as glowing red eyes that stared into my soul. It made me want to shrink and curl into a ball, shying away from the world. But when we approached him, I didn’t let it overtake me. I looked him straight in the eye, even when the rest of the room was bowed down. I wanted to show him I wouldn’t be broken, but after a minute of eye contact, the man burst out into weird laughter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who is she?” The man hissed to his followers, “I find her rebellion amusing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The muggle you ordered my Lord, the strongest.” One of the cloaked figures replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My new little weapon?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes my Lord.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And with that he descended from what would be his throne, walking down tile steps until he stood in front of me. His long, white fingers grabbing a chunk of my hair and tucking in behind my ear. Spending extra time dragging his fingers along my neck. “She will do very nicely.” He whispered, face gravitating even closer to mine, “Very nicely indeed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But then, as if he snapped out of his trance, he pulled his hand away from his face. Disgust fled his emotions as he took a step back, turning away from me. “Have you told the girl her purpose yet, the reason for her pathetic existence?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No my Lord, only about magic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well then, let me take this moment to enlighten our little guest.” He said as he turned around again, this time feet ahead of me. “About a month ago I had an idea, a fantasy if you will, about muggles. The idea of a worthless muggle girl forever only doing my bidding. Whether that be sex, or torture, or my favorite, cold-blooded murder. Anything I would want, she would do, no matter what the cost.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I shivered, my face falling and my eyes meeting the floor, but he continued. “I don’t know if my followers have told you, but I am fairly new to this. Only been at it for a little under ten years.  But my goals are tried and true, to take and purify the Wizarding World, eliminating all filth, with includes you.” And with this, he paused, almost like he was regrouping, and then continued. “But right now I want you to be that muggle girl from my fantasy. You were the strongest out of your group, the one with the most will to live for. And therefore you will, from now on, obey everything I say or do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Or what!” I said with venom in my mouth, trying to not act scared. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Or I kill that precious family of yours, still living in that stupid muggle house.” He hissed back, running back up to me and grabbing the back of my head, his touch sending sharp pain throughout my body.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No.” I whispered, tears dripping down my face for the first time since being kidnapped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What was that? I can’t hear you!” The snake-faced man said as the pain only grew worse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then, after several moments of excruciating pain, I let out a small “Yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> It was quiet, and I wasn’t sure if I could even hear it myself. But he did, and with it came the absence of the searing pain. I let out a gasp at the relief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Have her taken to my chambers, she will do just perfectly.” He said as I was grabbed by his hooded followers and lead away. To what was possibly would be the first day in the rest of my miserable existence. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>--------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I did what he asked, and I did it for seven long years. I slept with him, and whoever else he told me. I was passed around as a reward to his followers and eventually did it with pleasure as I became close with almost every single one. But, I lost all care for the sacretidy of sex. It became just another endless task he asked for, and actually my favorite thing he asked for. Because it was better than the alternative.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The other options started with torture, and it consisted of him bringing prisoners in and his followers teaching me how to hurt them. First in small ways, and then until they begged for death. After that, it became just giving them what they asked for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I lost my mercy and empathy, I took a life from this world every evening, hunting and killing whoever he wanted. It started with muggles, just like he had fantasized, but progressed to wizards too, his own followers even. But I did it all hoping I would one day reunite with my family, that they would be waiting for me with open arms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When Voldemort disappeared the first time, I rejoiced. This was my moment to be free of the abuse I was constantly inflicted. I turned myself into the Aurors that same day, explaining to them my whole story, and after a long deliberation, they let me go. I think it was maybe my absence of magic or the evidence that I had no choice. But there was one condition, one simple favor. To do as I did for him, but this time for the Ministry. Now it wasn’t as messy, or as cruel as the Death Eaters wanted. But it was the same concept, kill who they told me and anyone in my way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> It was under the table, and most of the time all they wanted me for was protection of top-ranking officials. The same officials that threatened me for sex. Then once again I was in the same position as before. With only one difference, while in power Voldemort had bound me to him. Magic so old and dark that when he disappeared something inside me stopped, and I was forever destined to live as a 22-year-old. Not aging, or with any chance of death, until his own final demise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But what really broke me was the news I got on turning myself in, that the family I had worked so hard to get back to was gone. The Death Eaters killed them the night I was kidnapped. My Mom, my Dad, and my baby sister were all dead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I became truly heartless, but most of all I became what he truly wanted, I became his weapon. </span>
