    <p>Later, he'll say he did it because of the constant nightmares and lack of sleep. He'll say it was because of the repressed fear that's been aching in his back and hurting his head. It's the isolation and the fact that Voldemort's out there while he, Harry, is stuck at Privet Drive.</p><p>Right at that time, it's a very hot day and the sun is scorching his reddening neck and shoulders. His head is heavy, too warm and too tired, his pulse beating in his temples. The dandelions in the lawn are stubbornly deep-rooted and his fingers are black with dirt and sap, a knuckle bleeding sluggishly where he scraped himself on the weeder.</p><p>Dudley is sitting on the garden wall a bit away, two of his friends standing on the sidewalk, kicking dust as they're waiting for something. Dudley said goodbye to Aunt Petunia earlier, no doubt to stop his friends from finding out that he goes by Dudleykins at home. They've all got backpacks piled by their feet, and Piers's one clucks suspiciously whenever he moves it. Not that Harry cares. Apart from a few comments when Piers came and the stray glance, he's perfectly content to be ignored by the other boys.</p><p>A car honks and the thump of loud music approaches. Aunt Petunia's not going to like that, Harry thinks and throws a ruffled dandelion on the growing pile by his side. Pushing his glasses up, he looks over the wall to see a battered old Mini Cooper brake harshly just outside of Nr 4. The windows are down and the radio is blaring. It's a far cry from the polished minivans parked on the drives of Privet Drive.</p><p>The door is thrown open and a guy comes out, a stubbly grin on his face and a hand with rings on it reaching up to stroke his auburn hair back. He's taller than even Dudley, but where Dudley's all fat, this guy seems to be filled out with muscles. Whoever he is, Harry hopes they're going far away for a long time.</p><p>"Hey man, this is where you live? I barely found it, it's bloody easy to get lost when all the houses look the same!" The guy gives a short laugh - Hah-ha! - and the words tug at the corner of Harry's mouth.</p><p>Harry digs the weeder into the ground to bend up another dandelion and doesn't listen to Dudley's grumpy come-back. His head feels hot and the air is standing still in this corner of the garden. He'd kill for a glass of water but Aunt Petunia is never going to let him into the kitchen looking like this. He rises with a hand against the garden wall, takes his glasses off and pulls up Dudley's old t-shirt to dry his sweaty face.</p><p>"Hey, who's this? You never told me you have a brother, D!"</p><p>Harry starts and looks up. Even without his glasses on, he can tell Dudley's looking as aghast as he's feeling.</p><p>"We're not brothers!" he blurts at the same time as Dudley exclaims "He's not my brother!"</p><p>A moment of silence follows where Harry puts on his glasses and catches the new guy raising his brows, grey eyes going back and forth between them.</p><p>"Okay… Is your not brother coming with us, then, D?"</p><p>"No, he isn't."</p><p>Piers and Malcolm are looking increasingly awkward, staring down at their feet and shuffling a bit.</p><p>"Oh, come on, we've got space for another one! It's way too hot for gardening - you'd rather come swimming with us in the Wey, right?"</p><p>Dudley starts bumbling about "special school" and Harry being a real headcase, but going swimming does sound like a good step up from that glass of water. Now that he thinks about it, they're all wearing swimming trunks and sandals and Malcolm's got a rolled up towel peeking out of his too full backpack.</p><p>"Yeah, sure, I'm coming."</p><p>He's dropped the weeder and jumped the wall before he knows what he's doing. Dudley, Piers and Malcolm are all glaring at him but the new guy is grinning.</p><p>"Brilliant! Hop in, lads!"</p><p>The backpacks join an assorted mess of blankets and plastic bags in the trunk and they all squeeze in, Dudley in the front and Harry pressed against the door in the back with Piers and Malcolm. There's only seat belts for two in the back, but they're crammed together so tight they mights as well have sticking charms keeping them in place.</p><p>"I'm Andy!" the guy shouts as he gets into the driver's seat and cranks up the radio a little bit more. "What's your name?"</p><p>"Harry!"</p><p>"Have some water, Harry! You're getting me thirsty just looking at you!"</p><p>He reaches back with a dented plastic bottle and Harry accepts it gratefully. Twisting the cap off, he downs half of it, not caring about the water he spills down his chin and not noticing Andy's eyes in the rearview mirror.</p><p>Music blaring, they drive off at a speed that can't be allowed on the quiet streets of Little Whinging. Andy's driving with his arm hanging out the window and a hand resting lightly on the steering wheel, nodding along to the beat. In the seat in front of Harry, Dudley fiddles with the buttons on the radio.</p><p>"Shit, I left the chocolate in my backpack!" Malcolm realises and twists in the middle seat.</p><p>"You bloody idiot!" Piers shouts when he gets squished.</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes and pretends neither of them exist. Leaning his head out the window, he closes his eyes and enjoys the wind against his face.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>River Wey curls it's way through the fields and towns of Surrey, now and then doubling back on itself, in places spilling out into lakes. Andy turns off the road and sends the little Mini jumping down a pair of bumpy wheel tracks across a field. Piers curses loudly when Malcolm knocks his chin with his elbow and Harry holds on to the door for dear life. The tracks snake in among the trees, oak and ash growing tall around them. Andy takes a sharp turn and the little car lurches as it bounces in and out of a hole in the ground. Harry's thrown forward and hits his forehead against the back of Dudley's seat, and then they've stopped.</p><p>"That's it, everyone!" Andy calls and turns the radio off, the sudden silence like a heavy blanket over their ears. "We're here!"</p><p>Harry scrabbles at the door, finds the handle and stumbles out of the car. On the other side, he hears Piers fall out onto the ground with a yelp and Malcolm and Dudley laugh as they climb out of the Mini.</p><p>"Here" is a grove of trees in a crook of River Wey, a willow with long, rope-like branches bending over the water and reeds and Indian Balsam growing tall along the grassy riverbank. Spots of sunlight dance over the ground and the splash of the river fills the grove, drowning out the sounds of a passing car on the road across the field.</p><p>"Let's unload, lads! Hey, Polkiss, you got the drinks?"</p><p>The trunk pops open and there's a general scuffle of bags and stuff. Harry leans against a nearby tree and looks out over the river, sunlight sparkling on the ripples.</p><p>"Hey, Harry! Catch!"</p><p>He turns around and his Quidditch reflexes kick in. A can hits his palm and he looks down at a Strongbow that's been thrown his way, then looks up when Andy whistles.</p><p>"Nice catch! You play baseball or something?"</p><p>"Or something," Harry mumbles.</p><p>"If you're gonna come along you can at least help," Dudley calls and chucks one of the backpacks at him. Harry snatches it out of the air as its about to sail past him and puts it down on the ground. Unzipping it, he raises his brows at the load of sausages and marshmallows that could feed at least ten people.</p><p>"Hey, anyone know how to put up a tent?" Andy asks, holding up a long, blue nylon bag.</p><p>"Last one in the water has to put up the tent!" Piers calls and sets off towards the river, throwing off his t-shirt as he goes. Dudley and Malcolm drop what's in their hands and thunder after him as Harry stares at Andy.</p><p>"A tent?"</p><p>"Yeah, where did you think we're gonna sleep?"</p><p>"Wait, we're staying the night?"</p><p>Andy gives that short hah-ha laugh and nods. "Come on, Harry. Seems we're in charge of the tent. Might as well take a swim before we figure out where the sticks gotta go."</p><p>Harry glances towards the three boys already in the river and grimaces when Dudley seems to make a valid attempt at drowning Malcolm.</p><p>"I'll just stay up here with this," he says and holds up the can of cider. He cracks it open, then yelps when it fizzes and sprays foam.</p><p>Hah-ha-ha! Andy puts down the tent and comes over, taking the can from Harry's soaked hands with his thumb and index finger.</p><p>"The Strongbow has spoken!" he declares.</p><p>"I didn't bring trunks!" Harry hisses and glares down at the stain on the old t-shirt. At least he didn't get any cider on his joggers, but the knees are dark with soil from kneeling in the garden. Come to think of it, his hands are still covered in dirt and dandelion sap and he's sticky with sweat as if he forgot to shower after Quidditch training.</p><p>"Oh, come off it, Harry - we're all lads here! Who cares? Hop in in your pants if you don't wanna go naked."</p><p>He puts the can down and holds his arm out in a you first gesture. Harry frowns at him, glances to the glittering water, and sighs. Pulling the string on his trousers, he kicks off his worn sneakers and the trousers, which he puts on the backseat of the Mini followed by his glasses. With the trees and reeds a blur of green and brown, he gingerly follows the sparkle of sunlight in the water. The shouts and splashing of Dudley and his friends are loud against a backdrop of rustling leaves and rushing water.</p><p>There's the rapid thump, thump, thump of running feet. A pair of arms lock around his shoulders and a body crashes into his back. He screams and flails when he's launched into the air and for a breath of a moment, they're flying. Then they're plunging into the river, water closing over Harry's head and blanketing his hearing, rushing into his mouth. He kicks out and finds nothing, then kicks again and hits the loose sediment on the bottom. Breaking the surface, he sucks in a deep breath and coughs, his nose burning as he palms the water out of his eyes. The hoots of laughter from Dudley and his friends cut clean through the water in his ears and Harry glares at them through his dripping finge.</p><p>"There you go! Not so bad, is it?"</p><p>"Oh, fuck off, would you?" Harry shoots a glare at Andy, turns his back to him and wades off a bit. His toe is smarting from where he stubbed it on a stone and he digs a pinky finger into his ear to get the water out. It's pretty obvious now, how Dudley knows Andy; they're obviously the same sort.</p><p>The wet t-shirt is glued to his skin and quickly turning cold, so he grabs the hem and peels it off. Scrubbing it in the water to get the cider and dried-in sweat out, he uses it to scrub off. Splashing water into his face and stroking his hair back, he ignores the ruckus Dudley is making and looks up at the blurry greenery with suds of light coming through.</p><p>There's a bit of a splash right behind him and Harry turns to squint at Andy over his shoulder. Even without his glasses, he thinks Andy's grin seems a little less confident.</p><p>"Hey, are you okay?"</p><p>"I didn't drown, did I?" Harry snaps back and turns away. Snatching up the sopping wet t-shirt, he ruffles his hair to get some of the water out and wades back to the riverbank. Maybe he can steal Dudley's towel and dry off without his cousin noticing.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Harry pulls his trousers back up and ties the string to keep them from sliding down. Like most of his muggle clothes, they're Dudley's hand-me-downs and several sizes too big. Going down to the river, he washes his hands off before making a turn, trying to find where he put his beer in the darkness among the trees. To his disappointment, he does find it precariously balanced atop a stone. In spite of Piers's half-hearted protests, Andy handed it to him when they lit the disposable grill earlier and Harry quickly realised that muggle beer is nothing like butterbeer. If the bitter taste wasn't enough, it had also grown stale as Harry grimaced and sipped his way through it.</p><p>Picking it up, Harry shakes it a bit and sighs when he realises half of it is still left.</p><p>The grove has gone quiet. The Wey rushes by, the sound of moving water blending with the crickets from the fields and the coo of a nearby dove. Dew is gathering on the grass and Harry shivers and rubs his arm as he picks his way through the darkness back to their "camp". The Mini is snugly parked between the trees and the orange tent is up by the water, a collection of sleeping bags piled inside. The others are sitting around the disposable grill, the last coals burning red and a blackened hot dog laying forgotten on the grate. Harry's stomach grumbles at the loss - he only managed to nick one sausage for himself before the others had shovelled the rest of them down.</p><p>His t-shirt is hanging like a ghostly flag on a branch and he pulls it down. It's a bit stiff and very wrinkly, but at least it's dry so Harry pulls it on. He pokes his head into the tent and frowns; in difference from the tent he stayed in at the Quidditch Cup last year, the inside is actually as small as the outside. There's no way the five of them are going to fit in there - considering how big Dudley and Malcolm are, Harry reckons only the two of them are going to fill the tiny space. There's a towel someone's thrown in there. It's not completely dry, but it's better than nothing so Harry takes it and wraps it around his shoulders.</p><p>"Harry? What's it like?"</p><p>Harry starts and turns around. Piers and Malcolm are sitting with their heads together, giggling quietly about something, and Andy is sitting on the other side of the fire, a Strongbow in hand. Cans, food packages and burnt marshmallows litter the ground. Dudley is right next to Harry, and he's staring up at his cousin with wide eyes wand distant gaze.</p><p>"What's what like?"</p><p>"Magic," Dudley breaths and Harry feels his brows climb up. "It gotta be pretty cool to have magic. Can you make shit fly and stuff?"</p><p>Harry takes a quick glance around the camp, but Piers and Malcolm are obviously not listening and Andy probably can't hear anything from across the grill.</p><p>"Yeah. Yeah, I can make things fly."</p><p>"Wow."</p><p>There's something wrong with Dudley's eyes - it's as if he's stargazing rather than looking at Harry. His pupils are blown wide and he can't seem to focus properly.</p><p>"Could you, like… sit in the couch and get the crisps to come to you? That'd be pretty sweet, not having to get up to get them."</p><p>"Dudley, are you… Are you high or something?"</p><p>Dudley widens his eyes even further and his jaw slackens. "How did you know?"</p><p>Harry takes a step back, staring down at his cousin. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon definitely don't know about this. His gaze wanders to Piers and Malcolm who both seem pretty sloshed, but maybe they're not just drunk. Is this what they came out here to do? What the hell have they taken?</p><p>"Hey, Harry?" Across the fire, Andy smiles and gets up, jerking his head further down the river. "Let's go over there for a bit."</p><p>"I wanna make the crisps fly," Dudley mumbles and lies down on his back, smiling widely at the canopies overhead.</p><p>Weirded out, Harry walks a big circle around the grill, keeping an eye on the three of them. "Are they going to be okay?"</p><p>"Yeah, they'll be fine." Andy waves his hand dismissively, takes a sip of his cider and starts down the river. "They'll probably have a bit of a headache tomorrow, but it won't be worse than a hangover."</p><p>Harry glances back at Dudley and his friends - Dudley's now got his hands up and making whooshing noises as if he's mimicking flying crisps - then goes to follow Andy. They find a tree that's fallen halfway into the river and sit down on the trunk, the moonlight shining through a gap between the trees. Andy bumps their cans together and takes a few deep swallows while Harry takes a tiny sip of his beer.</p><p>"So if you and Dudley aren't brothers, what are you?" he asks.</p><p>"What? Oh, right. We're cousins."</p><p>"Cousins, huh? So you're staying the summer then?"</p><p>"Something like that." Harry stares out over the dark river water. He can feel Andy's gaze on the side of his face and tries to change the subject: "How do you know Dudley?"</p><p>"I'm their senior from Smeltings. Just graduated, so after summer I'm off to Uni. You don't go to Smeltings, do you?"</p><p>Harry hesitates, but what could it possibly matter? A muggle's not going to know what Hogwarts is anyway. He shakes his head and says: "I go to a school in Scotland. You won't have heard of it - it's called Hogwarts."</p><p>Andy chokes on his beer and coughs. "Hog warts? Really?"</p><p>Harry nods with a snort and looks down at the can hanging loosely in his hands between his knees. "Yeah, really."</p><p>There's a splash and Harry turns his head, trying to catch sight of what made the sound. The constant flow of the river has already washed the ripples away, and whatever made the splash - a fish, maybe? - has disappeared below the surface. Andy shifts beside him, their shoulders bumping. There's the crinkle of plastic and then a palm-sized resealable bag is dangling in front of Harry's eyes. Inside, there's a small pill that looks just like a painkiller, white with a faint line running down the middle of it.</p><p>"You wanna try some?"</p><p>Harry stares at it for a moment, then flinches back and turns sharply to Andy. "You're the one that gave it to them?" he asks and jerks his head back towards the camp.</p><p>"Yeah, they asked me to bring it. Swimming was just a bonus."</p><p>Harry eyes the bag and the pill inside. It looks innocent enough but if it could get Dudley to say magic is cool…</p><p>"What is it?" he asks and from the corner of his eye, he sees Andy grin.</p><p>"It's bliss, Harry. Trust me."</p><p>Harry hesitates, then shakes his head and pushes Andy's hand away to get the pill out of his sight.</p><p>"Come on, Harry. It'd do you some good. Help you relax a bit."</p><p>When did he last get to relax? When did he last go a day without worrying about Voldemort? When did he last get a full night's sleep? He's seen the dark circles under his eyes in the mirror, felt the knots of tension in his shoulders. Dudley did look as if he was floating on clouds... and Harry must be worse off than he thought if he's actually considering this.</p><p>"You take it. I'm fine."</p><p>He shivers in the chill of the night and tugs the towel tighter around his shoulders. Merlin, he's tired. Maybe he should take a spot in the tent for himself before the others come around.</p><p>An arm settles around his shoulders and Andy pulls him close. Harry tenses in surprise, but Andy, having had the foresight to bring a hoodie, is warm. Keeping his eyes on the can hanging loosely from his fingers to not look at the other, Harry hears the crinkle of plastic and then Andy lifts his cider with his free hand. He'd never admit it, but Harry's actually a bit… disappointed.</p><p>The hand on his shoulder squeezes lightly, the thumb running firm circles into a tense muscle. It's… nice. With his head bowed, Harry stares down into his can and feels the hand stroke its way up, leaving goosebumps in its wake. It cups the side of his neck, then shifts again, the thump finding a snug behind Harry's ear he never really thought of before. It brushes against the temple tip of his glasses, pushing them slightly askew, and the palm cups his jaw, warm and big as the fingers splay out across his cheek.</p><p>Harry turns his head and opens his mouth to ask Andy what he's doing, but then there are lips on his and a tongue pushing inside. Harry grunts in surprise and hears the slosh of his beer spilling when he drops the can. Then there's cider pouring into his mouth and the hand holding the side of his face won't let him turn away so he swallows and feels the round hardness that washes down with the drink.</p><p>He coughs and the hand let's go. Leaning forward with his head between his knees, he hacks and the hand returns to massage his neck.</p><p>"What the hell, Andy?!" he shouts and swats the hand away, glaring up at the other.</p><p>"Easy now. It's okay. You shouldn't worry so much."</p><p>Harry dries his mouth on the back of his hand. "Well, fuck you," he snarls and puts a hand on the trunk to get up.</p><p>Andy grabs his arm and pulls him back down. "Come on, Harry. It's harmless."</p><p>Harry scowls down at the beer can between his feet. It's on its side and the beer has glugged out into a dark puddle in the grass. He's tired and hungry and a bit cold, but apart from the gross taste of cider in his mouth, he doesn't feel any different. Maybe he did overreact. He doesn't actually know anything about these things, and Andy the bastard does seem to know what he's doing. Perhaps it's not so bad after all?</p><p>"So you and Dudley don't get along all that well, do you?"</p><p>Harry snorts. "What gave it away?"</p><p>Hah-ha! "Then why are you staying the summer?"</p><p>"It's not like I have anywhere else to go."</p><p>There's a moment of silence when Harry looks up through his fringe at the purple flowers growing on the edge of the water and waits for the question that's sure to come. Then Andy's warm hand settles on the nape of Harry's neck again, kneading the tired muscles in a way that makes Harry drop his head forward.</p><p>"What about that school of yours then? I heard Dudley thinks it's some kind of special school."</p><p>"Hogwarts… Hogwarts is amazing." Harry closes his eyes and sighs, grudgingly admitting to himself that Andy's hand on his neck does feel pretty good.</p><p>"I don't know anyone who'd think their school is amazing."</p><p>"It's this really old castle in the Scottish Highlands, right by a lake. Our dorm is high up in a tower and we can see the Quidditch pitch and miles of the Forbidden Forest through the windows and everyone eats in this hall where you can see the sky through the roof."</p><p>"That does sound pretty cool."</p><p>Andy gives his neck a firm squeeze and Harry bites his lip to stop himself from groaning.</p><p>"So what's Quidditch?"</p><p>Harry freezes. Shit, he's said too much. What else did he say? The hand stops for a moment, then starts kneading again.</p><p>"It's just a sport. A… a Scottish sport."</p><p>"Oh, yeah? I've never heard of it. Do you play?"</p><p>"Yes…"</p><p>"Are you any good?"</p><p>"I'm the best seeker in school," he boasts before he can stop himself, then squeezes his eyes shut and swears a long string of curses in his mind.</p><p>"I guess that's why you're so lean, then."</p><p>…</p><p>Huh?</p><p>"Hey, are you still cold? Move a bit, would you?"</p><p>Mind scrambled, Harry lets Andy shift him around until they are both straddling the trunk with Harry's back against Andy's chest. Andy slings an arm casually around him, his hand coming to rest on Harry's stomach. It's… warm. Harry blinks slowly and follows the tree with his gaze to where the naked branches are dunked into the river. The dry branches are white like bones in the moonlight and point like broken fingers towards the sky. It's a dark indigo, bluer than Harry has ever seen it before, and the stars are shining so sharply he almost has to look away but when he looks closely enough, he can see the heavens turning slowly around them.</p><p>"I heard you and Dudley talking about magic," Andy says and his voice is low and right in Harry's ear.</p><p>"Hm?" Harry rolls his head back and tries to look Andy in the face, but ends up digging his nose into Andy's neck instead. "Wait… You heard that? You weren't supposed to hear that…"</p><p>"No? Why not?"</p><p>"There's this thing called the Statue of Secrecy. We're not supposed to tell muggles about magic."</p><p>"Muggles?"</p><p>"People who don't have magic, like you and Dudley."</p><p>"And you do? Are you like Merlin, or what?"</p><p>"No! Merlin's the most powerful wizard there's ever been! And he's been dead for ages."</p><p>Andy laughs and it's not that short hah-ha but a deep, rolling laugh that makes his chest shake against Harry's back.</p><p>"You really are a bit of a mental case, aren't you?"</p><p>Harry frowns, then sighs and rolls his head to the side to look out over the river. "It's better if you don't believe me or they might come and Obliviate you."</p><p>"They might what now?"</p><p>"Obliviate you. It's when they charm your memories away."</p><p>"Sounds scary."</p><p>Harry nods slowly, staring up at the turning stars. They seem so close. "We had a teacher once… He went around and Obliviated people and took credit for all the things they'd done… He almost Obliviated me, but it backfired and the tunnel fell in..."</p><p>Warm fingers close around his chin and tilts his face up. Harry blinks slowly at Andy as grey eyes move back and forth between his own green ones, a strangely serious frown wrinkling Andy's brow. This close, his irises are implosions of sky blue, grassy green, sharp white and steely grey with streaks of galleon gold. Then Andy's grinning again.</p><p>"There we are," he mumbles and leans in.</p><p>His lips brush over Harry's, softly, barely there. The thumb on his chin tips his mouth open and Andy leans his head to the side, his nose brushing Harry's cheek. His tongue sweeps over Harry's bottom lip, then dips inside, finding Harry's own tongue then drawing back. The next moment, his lips seal over Harry's, now kissing him full on, then nibbling his bottom lip.</p><p>"Mmgh." The sound bubbles up from somewhere deep inside of Harry that has never made itself heard before and he gasps into the kiss. The hand on his stomach starts moving, rucking his t-shirt up and the stroking its way in under the shirt. It's pure heat against Harry's chilled skin as it trails up, pressing over Harry's wildly beating heart that's like a drum in his head and then stroking it's way down, down to the lining of his joggers. The muscles jump under his touch and Harry is suddenly very deeply aware that he's not wearing anything else under those trousers.</p><p>Harry finds Andy's arm and grabs it hard, fingers digging into his lower arm. Andy's tongue dips deep into his mouth, stroking along his palate all the way to the back as the hand on his jaw moves down to rest over his collarbones. The hand on his stomach moves, stroking sideways along the lining on his trousers, fingers curling into the soft hairs trailing down from his navel. Harry tightens his grip on Andy's arm, unable to stop him from moving, not even sure he wants him to stop, but very much needing to hold on to something.</p><p>Andy sucks on his bottom lip, then dives in for another one of those deep kisses and Harry groans at the sharp taste of cider. He reaches up, blindly, and finds Andy's head. Moving down, he grabs Andy's neck, fingers pulling at the tiny hairs there and Andy hisses into the kiss. One of his fingers dips into Harry's navel, his thumb teasing its way below the waistline. It sends a shiver of anticipation through Harry and Andy laughs into the kiss and pulls back.</p><p>Harry blinks up at Andy, his chest heaving as he pants breathlessly, his glasses askew. Andy is grinning down at him, and the hand on Harry's chest moves up to stroke his lips, then push his fringe out of his face, fingers pausing on his forehead.</p><p>"How'd you get this?"</p><p>"Wh... what?"</p><p>"This scar, right here," Andy says, his fingertips tracing the firebolt shape.</p><p>"It's a curse scar… from when Voldemort tried to… tried to kill me," Harry explains, trying to catch his breath, his mind flooded with a feeling that's both a sedate, luxurious heaviness and a jittery, sharp tingle.</p><p>Hah-ha! "Well of course it is." Andy grins wryly and Harry's breath catches when he leans down and presses a kiss to the scar.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>There's the chirp of birds, the rustle of leaves and the wind shaking the reeds. Harry groans, raises a unwieldy hand and rubs his eyes. His head… hurts. It hurts like it's been pumped full with wool and is about to crack open, the wool pressing against his temples and the back of his eyes. It's also very, very heavy. It doesn't help that the temples of his glasses are digging into the side of his skull, so he straightens them and cracks an eye open, then promptly pulls his head back when Andy's chin appears right in front of his nose.</p><p>Andy is sleeping, his mouth open and an arm thrown across his face to block out the sunlight. Harry opens both of his eyes and takes a quick look around, his mouth opening into a knut-sized "O" when he realises he is spread out on top of Andy. They're in the cramped backseat of the Mini with an orange unzipped sleeping bag that has slipped down onto the floor behind the driver's seat, only part of it still covering Harry's legs. With one leg between Andy's and the other trapped against the back of the seats, he had been sleeping with his cheek on Andy's shoulder.</p><p>His mind makes a mad scramble, trying to piece together what happened last night, and he squeezed his eyes shut when he remembers the pill, the tree trunk, the… kissing. It felt really good. Merlin, how embarrassing. He pales and quickly looks down at Andy's sleeping face. Did he really, actually… tell him? About magic, and Voldemort, and…? What happens to people who break the Statue of Secrecy? Are they put in Azkaban? But… it should be okay if the muggle doesn't believe it's real, shouldn't it?</p><p>Harry swallows hard, then puts a hand on the back of the driver's seat and pulls himself up slowly, careful not the jar Andy. Pushing the sleeping bag onto the floor, he fumbles with his free hand behind his back and finds the door handle. With bated breath, Harry pulls the handle and hears the click of the car door opening. With his weight on the knee between Andy's legs, he backs out slowly, his searching foot finding the ground. He holds his breath until he's standing on his own two feet in the grass, then doesn't dare close the car door again should he happen to wake Andy.</p><p>He lets out a breath and turns around, and is met by a disaster zone worthy of the potions classroom. There's a half-melted plastic bag on the grill and the ground is littered with blackened marshmallows, spilt mustard and crinkled up, empty cans. Amid it all, Malcolm is snoring loudly, curled up in a bright purple sleeping bag with a trail of drool running down his cheek that makes Harry reach up and rub the corner of his own mouth. From the tent, Dudley's even louder snores rumble and a familiar foot sticks out from under the half-closed flap.</p><p>With his stomach rumbling wetly and his eyes barely open, Harry spots a water bottle that's halfway under the tent and bends down to pick it up. There's only about an inch of water left, but it's better than nothing. Twisting the cap, he empties it in a couple of deep gulps. His mouth is still dry and his tongue sticks against his palate. The wooly feeling is turning into a bludger-worthy headache and he throws the water bottle aside to hold on to his thumping temples.</p><p>What was he thinking? He only met Andy yesterday and, Merlin, he doesn't even know what that pill was! It could have been anything! And that… the… the things that they did - that Andy did!</p><p>Harry groans. Face flaming, he staggers down to the river to dunk his head underwater and, potentially, drown himself. As soon as they get back to Privet Drive, he'll forget everything and the Statue of Secrecy be damned if Dudley every mentions anything.</p>
