    <p>Gellert, 20, UK</p><p><strong>Looking for:</strong>  Men</p><p>
  <strong>More about me :</strong>
</p><p>My friend describes me as a dreamer.</p><p>It’s true that I do try to change the world one day at the time. I enjoy the dark arts, reading books, dark clothes and heartfelt debates. I speak six different languages and I’m a complete nerd. I also have an unnatural obsession with a stupid kid’s book. I can sometimes be a dramatic bitch, full of myself and a bit of a slut, but deep down I am a great guy. My most redeeming quality is my small tight ass.</p><p>My best friend, an absolute queen among mere mortals and whose fashion sense is so much better than mine, may or may not have written this.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>‟Oh Merlin Vi, look at this one!” Gellert snorted out loud as he continued to scroll through the messages he had received during the night on his phone and showed pictures now and then to his best friend, Vinda Rosier.‟ OR THIS ONE!”</p><p>The two had met in Durmstrang a few years ago and had been inseparable since then.</p><p>When Gellert had been expelled from the Institute after he had defiled the school’s property and for an outrageous use of dark magic; and had been thrown out of his family’s estate a few days later by his crazy father, he had taken refuge in the Rosiers’ mansion in France…</p><p>Until both he and Vinda had been thrown out by the Rosiers a few weeks later, when an argument between Vinda and her mother about the fact that at nineteen she still wasn’t dating a proper pureblood boy and hadn’t provided them with an heir yet, had blown out of proportions that is...</p><p>Nasty curses had soon been thrown between mother and daughter and the two best friends had ended up in Gellert’ s great-aunt’s kitchen in the UK at two in the morning that same day with nothing else than the clothes they were wearing on themselves.</p><p>The kind old witch, who had always had a soft spot for her great-nephew, had soon found them an apartment to live in, close to her place in Godric’s Hollow, but even closer to Propentia, the renowned wizarding university which was located in Cerne Abbas in Dorset.</p><p>The two friends had been living together in their small flat for the last few months since then…</p><p>This morning, Vinda was wearing a silk and lace nightie, while Gellert wasn’t wearing much except the boxers she had bought him last Christmas as he was showing her some more disturbing images.</p><p>To an outsider, they seemed to be the perfect picture of domestic bliss and looked like a cute young couple in love…</p><p>Except they weren’t; because they both played for their team.</p><p>‟If you keep up showing me these Gell, I will throw up; I swear!” Vinda declared as she applied a second coating of dark red nail polish on her perfect nails. She then used a quick spell to make them dry faster as Gellert, who was still scrolling on his phone, let out a shocked scream.</p><p>‟I bet this one used Engorgio on his.” The blonde frowned and pulled a face as he quickly shoved his phone back in front of his best friend’s face. ‟This one’s downright disgusting. This is nightmare material right there! Look at that vein...”</p><p>Vinda really gagged upon staring at the picture and pushed Gellert’s phone away. ‟ See? That’s why I hate men and I’m so glad I love women. Do those idiots really think that upon seeing pictures of their dick you are going to swoon and message them?”</p><p>Gellert shrugged as he finally put his phone down. ‟I guess it must work sometimes; otherwise they wouldn’t do so.”</p><p>Vinda quirked an eyebrow at him. ‟You better not be posting pictures of your dick on the Internet Gellert Grindelwald; otherwise, I’ll tell your great-aunt and she’s going to find those pictures and will never let you live them down.”</p><p>Gellert seemed outraged by his best friend’s declaration. ‟Me? Never!”</p><p>The gorgeous witch seemed to doubt his words, but didn’t reply anything else in the end, since they had class in a few hours and weren’t ready to leave for uni yet.</p><p>Being beautiful certainly was time-consuming.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>If Gellert had joined <em>Wicked</em>, the latest dating app for the lonely wizards and witches, it was solely because his great-aunt Bathilda had told him that he would be able to find interesting new lads on it; since he seemed to be in dire need of some fun between the sheets…</p><p>It was also because she, along with Vinda, had thought that this would help him forget about Alexei, the Russian who had crushed his heart a few years ago and who had been responsible in part of Gellert’s expulsion from Durmstrang.</p><p>Vinda had been there at the time to witness the ugly-crying and the massive ice cream eating and wasn’t keen on repeating the experience, though.</p><p>At first, Gellert had thought that subscribing to <em>Wicked</em> was a ridiculous idea, but two hours later, with Vinda’s help, he had successfully completed his dating profile.</p><p>The two best friends had then spent the rest of the afternoon snapping selfies so Gellert would have a nice picture to go along with his profile and Vinda would be able to update her Facebook page.</p><p>Little did Gellert know just what he really had signed for that day…</p><p align="center">***</p><p>

She quirked an eyebrow at him as he propped his feet up on her bed frame and she looked at his app:</p><p align="center">
