    <hr/><p> </p><p><em>“There’s no vocabulary For love within a family, love that’s lived in But not looked at, love within the light of which All else is seen, the love within which All other love finds speech. This love is silent.” </em>  —TS Eliot</p><p align="left"><br/>

A loud bang echoed through the room, drumming against Harry’s ears,  rousing him from sleep. He rubbed his eyes and sat up in bed, reaching to the nearby night table for his glasses. Normally, he liked to sleep in on a Saturday, but Draco had other ideas. He looked around and sighed. The left side of the bed, Draco’s side, was untouched. Last night, Harry had tucked himself into bed and not disturbed the other half. It wasn’t unusual for Draco to rise obscenely early on the weekends. Harry was certain that Draco was a masochist and perhaps even a touch insane. He had suspected that Draco would sleep on the couch again and avoid him. As much as he hoped to be wrong, the proof stared him in the face.<br/>
<br/>
Harry shook his head and dragged himself out of bed, brushing his hand against the cool side of the bed, wishing it were warm instead. Harry knew that his relationship with Draco wasn’t real—that it was a farce for the Ministry’s sake. But that didn’t make his feelings any less real. His heart clenched every time he noticed how far Draco continued to pull away. Apparently, just the thought of having to share a bed with Harry repulsed him.<br/>
<br/>
Harry made the bed, straightening out the sheets in the way that Draco had showed him.  Then he stood up straight, reaching his arms behind his back, stretching. Although Draco’s bed was one of the most comfortable beds he’d slept in ages, if not ever, he wasn’t used to sleeping on such a soft mattress. Sometimes, his back muscles protested, perhaps from stress.<br/>
<br/>
After alleviating his aching back, Harry put on his slippers and examined his appearance in the full-length mirror. For a bloke who claimed he didn’t have time to care about his appearance, Draco seemed to have a mirror in every room of his house. Frowning, Harry ran a hand through his sleep-tousled hair, trying to flatten it. Half of his hair stood on end as if he had rubbed a balloon against it. His fussing only seemed to make it stand up more.<br/>
<br/>
He shrugged; his hair was less than cooperative after a long shower and Draco’s special conditioning treatments. In the morning, his hair appeared to be as grumpy he was. <em> Oh well </em> , Harry thought. <em>It’s not like Draco even wants to be in the same room with me. It’s doubtful he’ll even notice my hair</em>.<br/>
<br/>

</p><p> </p><p><br/>
“Potter? Is that you? Get your arse in here.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry yawned. With his hands rumpled in his dressing gown, he shuffled down the hallway and toward the living room where Draco was waiting.<br/>
<br/>
“What?” He stifled another yawn. “Why are you yelling at this god forsaken hour?”<br/>
<br/>
Draco blanched. “Are you kidding me, Potter? It’s 8.35!” He widened his eyes and cupped his hands behind his neck, elbows pointing outward. “Don’t tell me you forgot what day it is?”<br/>
<br/>
Harry sighed. He did not want to argue with Draco so early in the morning, especially since arguing was all they did lately. Sure, Harry knew this marriage of theirs wasn’t real—that it was two adults and a child playing house—but a part of him had hoped that they would grow closer and not bicker at each other like children.<br/>
<br/>
“Of course, I haven’t forgotten,” he said, keeping his voice even. “That lady from the Ministry is coming today for an inspection.”<br/>
<br/>
Draco threw his hands in the air. “A lady? You mean Agent Rebecca Summers, Head of the Department of Family and Social Affairs.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry shrugged. “Yeah, that’s the one. The social worker.” He ignored Draco’s dirty look and sat himself on the couch. “The meeting isn’t until 11. We have plenty of time. Why don’t you relax? It won’t kill you.”<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t want to relax, Potter! You’ve been no bloody help at all.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry bit down on his lip and regarded Draco closely. Draco had always been attractive. Even when he was the biggest prat to walk the planet back at Hogwarts, he was still a gorgeous, annoying prat. He'd always been immaculate and fastidious about his appearance, always put together without a hair out of place.<br/>
<br/>
In the past few years, Draco lost some of that fastidiousness, at least when it came to clothing, preferring to dress for comfort rather than fashion. He claimed that single fathers and Healers had more pressing matters to deal with than keeping up with the latest fashion trends. Usually, he strolled around in his oversized Healer’s robes. If not, he adapted a more casual style of jeans and a jumper.<br/>
<br/>
Harry loved this more down to earth and simplified Draco. But he might have to eat his words.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, Draco wore a grey striped button-down shirt and a fitted pair of trousers. A crimson tie hung around his neck, and his chin length hair that he usually kept tied behind his neck fell in loose layers around his face, softening his angular features. He was breathtaking. Without realising it, Harry must have opened his mouth, causing Draco to narrow his eyes and scowl.<br/>
<br/>
“Not one word about my tie, Potter.”<br/>
<br/>
The intensity in Draco’s glare disturbed him. That look was too familiar. It brought him back to their school days when Harry found himself on the wrong side of Malfoy’s wand more times than he’d like to admit.<br/>
<br/>
“I wasn’t,” Harry lied. “I didn’t even notice.” He offered Draco an innocent smile. “I think you look nice.” Nice was an understatement. The truth was Harry wanted to bend Draco over the couch and fuck him right there. He couldn’t actually say that. But fuck, did Draco look good in red.<br/>
<br/>
Draco softened his glare but still regarded Harry coolly, as if he were deciding whether Harry was joking or not.  After several seconds, he responded, “Thank you."</p><p><br/>
“You’re welcome.” Harry continued to stare at Draco with a stupid smile, trying to ignore the way his pulse quickened. Then he noticed a faint shade of pink spread down Draco’s cheeks. For someone so gorgeous, Draco didn’t know how to take a compliment.<br/>
<br/>
As he widened his smile, Draco turned away from him. Harry sighed, trying to ignore the deep pang in his chest. That short conversation about Draco’s tie was the most civil conversation they’d had in days. Even though he looked delectable in his outfit, Harry knew that Draco was stressed. Dark shadows hung under his eyes, which were bloodshot and heavy-lidded. Harry wondered if he had slept at all.<br/>
<br/>
“What time did you get up?” Harry asked, trying to keep the concern out of his voice.<br/>
<br/>
The scowl returned, Draco's lips pressed into a thin line, brow creased. “At 6, Potter,” he snapped. “I apologise for disturbing your beauty sleep, but today is a rather important day for <em> some </em> of us. Not all of us can rely on our—” he puckered his lips and stared at Harry as if deciding what type of insult he wanted to spew, “ <em> charm, </em> to get through life.”<br/>
<br/>
“Right.” Harry fidgeted with the string on his pyjama bottoms. “You could have woken me up. I wouldn’t have minded.”<br/>
<br/>
Draco snorted. “Oh, yes, you’re such a morning person, Potter. Spare me.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry blushed. “Well, no, but I still would have got up. For-for Scorpius.”<br/>
<br/>
Draco blinked and then looked away. “Well, you better get ready then before the little monster comes storming in here and sees you. You only have—”<br/>
<br/>
“Three bloody hours to get ready. How will I ever manage?” Harry attempted to raise an eyebrow and smirk, mocking Draco with his favourite expression.<br/>
<br/>
Draco was not impressed. “Stop that.” He rolled his eyes. “You look ridiculous. Now go get dressed. I’ve already picked out your outfit. It’s hanging on the back door of the closet.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry raised an eyebrow again.<br/>
<br/>
“What? You actually think I’m going to trust you with something this important, Potter.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry frowned but didn’t respond.<br/>
<br/>
“Besides, if this is supposed to be real, no bloody husband of mine would ever be caught dead in,” he wrinkled his nose in disgust, gesturing at Harry’s outfit, “whatever that is. Now, go and change.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry opened his mouth to protest. Really, Draco had no business criticising his choice of pyjamas not when Harry had seen him sleep in an oversized tee shirt that said “Number 1 Dad” just days earlier. Then he noticed the deep creases in Draco’s brow, the worry lines that were starting to etch themselves into his forehead. Draco was too young for those lines. He had an overabundance of stress in his life. It wasn’t fair for Harry to add to it.<br/>
<br/>
“Fine,” Harry grumbled, avoiding Draco’s eyes. “But I’m going to need some coffee first.”<br/>
<br/>

  <b>: : :</b>
</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Three extremely weak cups of coffee later, Harry found himself back in what he started to think of as <em> his </em> bedroom since Draco never slept there. His head still throbbed from all the orders Draco had barked at him, but he decided to let his aggravation slide, believing that Draco was just concerned about his son. Harry was about to plop down on the bed for a quick rest when he realised that there was a large bump underneath the covers that hadn’t been there earlier. He was certain that the bump was indeed a miniature Malfoy since it was round and squirming, yet he decided to play along for Scorpius’ sake.<br/>
<br/>
“What do we have here?” Harry asked, amused. He scooted to the end of the bed and poked the lump with his index finger. “I have no idea what that could be. But it sure is squishy.” He gave the child-shaped lump another poke. “And warm. I hope it’s not a monster.” He bit down on the corner of  his lip to fight back a smile.<br/>
<br/>
A few moments earlier, he'd been in a foul mood, but Scorpius always found a way to make him smile. “Especially not a ferocious one.”<br/>
<br/>
He pulled back the covers and then let out a high-pitched screech when Scorpius jumped out and attacked him. Harry made a fuss of falling on the bed,letting Scorpius think he frightened him. “Oh, no,” he cried, “please don’t hurt me, scary monster!”<br/>
<br/>
“Rooarr!” Scorpius could not manage a complete growl as he collapsed into a fit of giggles.<br/>
<br/>
“Ahh!!” Harry attempted to hide his grin by covering his face with his hands. “What kind of monster are you anyway?”<br/>
<br/>
“Tickle monster!” With a loud thud, Scorpius jumped on top of Harry’s chest, knocking the wind out of him. He began tickling Harry furiously, starting at his sides, working his way up to his chest.<br/>
<br/>
“Stop, stop!” Harry failed to escape Scorpius’ tickle attack, instead dissolving into his own fit of giggles.<br/>
<br/>
“No!” Scorpius pouted. “Not until you surwender.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry grinned. The boy was too adorable for his own good. He was brilliant for a five-year-old, but sometimes when he became too excited, his pronunciation of certain words faltered, especially ones with double consonants. “I surrender, I surrender.”<br/>
<br/>
After stealing a few extra giggles out of Harry, Scorpius stopped tickling him. He crawled up further into Harry’s chest, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck, cuddling his face into his chest. Harry looked down at the small boy and sighed contentedly. He stroked the pale white-blond hair out of his face, which was so much like Draco’s.  </p><p>He smiled. No matter how much Draco frustrated him, whenever Harry looked at Scorpius – or worse yet – when he snuggled into his chest like this – Harry could not regret his decision to take part in this fake marriage. This so-called marriage might be hard on Harry’s delicate ego, but this wasn’t about him.</p><p>It was for Scorpius.<br/>
<br/>
Harry would do anything for this little boy, who had won him over since the first time they'd met. Scorpius Malfoy might look like a miniature Malfoy clone, but he hadn’t inherited the Malfoy sullen disposition. Instead, he was a sweet and loving child, always smiling. Harry liked to tease Draco, claiming that since Scorpius inherited all of his father’s physical traits, then he must have inherited his personality from his mother. As expected, Draco did not find the joke amusing, arguing that he'd directly influenced all of Scorpius’ best qualities.<br/>
<br/>
Although Harry agreed, he would never admit it to Draco. The git’s head was already big enough. Still, the man Draco was today – a brilliant father and compassionate Healer – was worlds away from the smarmy pointy-faced git he'd been at Hogwarts. It made Harry wonder what had happened in Draco’s childhood to cause such a drastic change. Perhaps Draco had also been a sweet and loving boy.</p><p>Either way, staring into Malfoy silvery-grey eyes made Harry’s heart flutter, his head spin. It was sobering that at least one pair of grey eyes didn’t flinch away, regarding him with wide-eyed adoration.<br/>
<br/>
“Love you,” Scorpius whispered into his chest.<br/>
<br/>
“Love you too,” Harry replied, still stroking Scorpius’ soft hair. The words slipped out, but they were true. Even if Scorpius had only been in his life for a few short months, he loved this little boy with all his heart. It wasn’t fair that Scorpius was ill, and it was unreasonable that he was treated like a second class citizen only because of his parentage.<br/>
<br/>
For months now, the new Ministry AV, had been passing unreasonable laws against former Death Eaters. They had once again taken things too far by no longer allowing Death Eaters or any of their immediate family members to be treated at St Mungo’s. Luckily, Harry had found a loophole around the law. Since he didn’t have an heir, if Draco and him married and he legally claimed Scorpius as his heir, Scorpius would no longer be subjected to the unfairness of these laws. In the Ministry’s eyes, continuing the Potter line was more important than punishing a former Death Eater. No matter what happened with Draco, Harry knew that he would make sure that no harm came to this precious child.<br/>
<br/>
Things had not always been so complicated. Harry could still remember a time before these two Malfoys had squirmed their way into his life, before they had stolen his heart. Six months earlier, Harry hadn’t been in contact with any Malfoys for years. Sure, he assumed that Malfoy was still alive somewhere. He figured that he would have heard if he died or something.<br/>
<br/>
And Malfoy wouldn’t bugger off and die. There were so many people that he still had to annoy. Harry was certain that the universe would never allow it.</p><p> </p><p>
