  <em>Yoongi</em>
</p><p>SEOKJIN WAS BEING AN asshole, Yoongi decided. He glared at his boyfriend from the opposite seat in the train carriage and more firmly tucked himself under Namjoon’s arm.</p><p>His other boyfriend snorted. “Careful, Jin, Yoongi is one step away from glaring you to death.”</p><p>Jin let out his windshield whippers laugh. “It’s going to be so good! I can’t wait to see your faces!”</p><p>“They never should have made you prefect,” Yoongi grumbled. “The power has gone straight to your head.”</p><p>Jin threw his arms wide in a dramatic gesture. “Who am I? I am Jin!”</p><p>“You’re an idiot,” a new voice said from the door. Taehyung slid into the compartment, Jungkook right behind him.</p><p>Jin gasped, “How dare you!” But even as he mock glared at Taehyung, he opened his arms to give Jungkook a hug. “My son, I’ve missed you!”</p><p>Namjoon snorted. “He’s not actually your son, Jin.”</p><p>“Lies!”</p><p>They’d met Jungkook last year through Taehyung. He’d entered Hogwarts as a first year at eighteen, while Taehyung was a second year. Of course, they’d heard about Jungkook long before that. He and Taehyung had been together since before Hogwarts, and Taehyung had spent the whole previous year bemoaning his missing boyfriend. Yoongi had been a little worried about introducing another person to their group, but the moment Jungkook showed up with his rabbit face and Bambi eyes they’d all fallen in love. He was the youngest of the group and Yoongi readily admitted that they all babied him, especially Jin who’d promptly declared Jungkook his son. What that made him and Namjoon, Yoongi didn’t know.</p><p>Taehyung sprawled out on a cushion and eyed the three of them as Jin continued to hold Jungkook in a choke-hold hug. “Anyway, how were your summers? Yoongi looks like he’s going full cat-mode.”</p><p>“Fuck you,” Yoongi said succinctly.</p><p>It was true of course. Yoongi was curled up against Namjoon, one of Namjoon’s hands distractedly rubbing Yoongi’s head. If Yoongi was a cat, he’d be purring. Jin watched them with a fond smile. Yoongi had barely seen either of them over the summer. Their pureblood families made visiting unpleasant, and there was only so much either of them could get away. They weren’t like Taehyung and Jungkook who basically lived out of each other’s pockets despite how they appeared sometimes.</p><p>“Fine. How were your summers?” Yoongi asked, drawing the attention away from himself.</p><p>Jin finally released Jungkook who moved to sit next to Taehyung. “It was good,” Jungkook said. “Spent most of it with my parents helping them with their bookstore.</p><p>Taehyung visited. Did a lot of training.”</p><p>“You’re going for it then?” Yoongi asked curiously.</p><p>Jungkook ran a hand through his black hair in embarrassment. It was longer than it had been last year, now with a slight wave and pulled back into a man bun. Jungkook had also bulked up more, and Yoongi admitted that he looked good.</p><p>“Got to try at least,” Jungkook said.</p><p>Jungkook played quidditch. Last year, he’d been the only first year on a House team. He was a natural, and it had been largely due to his Keeper skills that Hufflepuff won the Quidditch Cup. Yoongi and the others had been trying to convince Jungkook to play Quidditch professionally after Hogwarts.</p><p>“Good for you,” Namjoon said approvingly.</p><p>Jungkook shrugged in embarrassment.</p><p>“Where’s Jimin?” Jin asked.</p><p>Taehyung snorted. “Where do you think Jimin is? Flirting with everything that moves.”</p><p>“We’re the ones he hasn’t seen all summer!” Jin protested.</p><p>“Hoseok is trying to wrangle him,” Jungkook said. “He was coming here but he got distracted.”</p><p>Yoongi snorted. That sounded like Jimin.</p><p>They were an odd group altogether. Jin was the oldest at twenty-three and the only fifth year. He was a Gryffindor and now a prefect, Merlin save them all. With his black hair and clean-cut image, he looked like the pureblood son he was. But when he opened his mouth, it was immediately apparent that he was an idiot who communicated almost entirely through dad-jokes and bad puns. Then there was Namjoon, a fourth year Ravenclaw too smart for his own good. The only thing that kept him from being unbearable was that for as smart as he was, he was incapable of doing anything else. He was banned from ever getting on a broom for the safety of himself and everyone around him. But Yoongi certainly wasn’t going to complain about his silver hair and glasses that made him look like the heir of a muggle mafia.</p><p>Yoongi and Taehyung were both Slytherins, but Yoongi was a fifth year with Jin and Taehyung a third year. They couldn’t be more different, and sometimes Yoongi wondered if he understood Taehyung at all, but he also felt a kinship with Taehyung for reasons Yoongi couldn’t say out loud.</p><p>Jimin and Hoseok finally made their appearance, bursting through the door, and the others greeted them with cheerful mockery. Yoongi stared at Jimin in horror. “Your hair is pink!”</p><p>The third year Hufflepuff smiled, his eyes scrunching up into half-moons. “I wanted to start the year off strong. What do you think?”</p><p>“It certainly leaves an impression,” Namjoon said diplomatically.</p><p>“You look like a lollipop,” Yoongi said.</p><p>“I’m sure every woman between the age of sixteen and twenty-five is going to fall madly in love with you,” Taehyung said to his best friend.</p><p>Jimin threw himself down next to Taehyung and gave him a hug. “Thanks Tae.”</p><p>Yoongi rolled his eyes. Jimin was a player. They all knew it. It wasn’t that Jimin was manipulative or flitty. The opposite really. It was just that Jimin really loved everyone.</p><p>“What about you, Hoseok?” Taehyung winked. “Is this going to be the year you finally meet your true love?”</p><p>It was well known that the fourth year Gryffindor wanted to fall in love. But unlike Jimin who was always seeing someone, Hoseok claimed he was holding out for “the one.” Hoseok shook his auburn head. “Well between you and Jungkook and those three, it’s the only way to survive.”</p><p>“Hey!” Jin sat upright. “What do you mean by ‘those three’?”</p><p>Yoongi rested his head against Namjoon’s shoulder and let his friend’s teasing wash over him like a blanket. It was good to be home.</p><p>Yoongi’s good mood lasted up until the thestrals. Getting into the carriages at Hogsmeade Station, Yoongi and the thestrals engaged in a silent battle of wills. The thestrals didn’t care about most of the students, even the ones that could see them, but the thestrals hated Yoongi almost as much as Yoongi hated them.</p><p>Namjoon dragged him into a carriage. “Live to fight another day,” his boyfriend laughed.</p><p>Yoongi decided Namjoon was also being an asshole.</p><p>Hogsmeade was just as Yoongi remembered it, and there was comfort in its unchanging nature. It was the only entirely wizard community in Britain, and that meant the village had an otherworldly quality that Yoongi wasn’t used to after spending a summer with his dad in London. Nevertheless, as the carriages rolled down High Street and they passed the shops with their bizarre window displays, Yoongi couldn’t hide his grin.</p><p>When Hogwarts came into view, the last of Yoongi’s tension faded away. It wasn’t a perfect place. Yoongi had a list of grievances a mile long. If the general student population ever found out his secret, he’d probably be out on his ear. But he couldn’t help but love every turreted tower and stained-glass window and secret passageway.</p><p>It was a good thing the others couldn’t hear his thoughts or they’d be laughing their asses off.</p><p>By the time the carriages reached the courtyard and all the students piled into the Great Hall for the feast, Yoongi only reluctantly let go of Namjoon and Jin’s arms. Jin blew a kiss and disappeared off to the Gryffindor table with Hoseok, while Namjoon left for the Ravenclaw. Yoongi scowled.</p><p>“C’mon, you grumpy old man,” Taehyung said as he dragged Yoongi towards the Slytherins. He waved goodbye to Jungkook and Jimin before they were swallowed up by Hufflepuffs.</p><p>They found seats at the Slytherin table, and Yoongi slowly relaxed into the familiar sights and sounds and smells. The ceiling reflected the uncharacteristically clear night sky, a full moon shining bright. It was an auspicious beginning to the year. Hundreds of candles floated above them, their flames adding a warm glow to the otherwise drafty Great Hall. For now, the tables shone with silver plates and silverware and glass goblets, but soon they’d be ladened with all the food any of them could eat.<br/>
Yoongi had had a good summer with his dad. He’d made a score for his dad’s new radio show, and written several songs that he’d waited to show Namjoon and Jin until he could do it in person. But Hogwarts was home, despite everything.</p><p>The boisterous hum of chatter was interrupted by the arrival of the first years, all bearing mixed expressions of determination and trepidation. There were those who were born to wizard parents and had been waiting their whole lives for this moment. And then there were those born to muggle parents who’d probably been planning to go to college or start working until they got an owl and ended up here. Yoongi grinned and crowed along with everyone, but he didn’t pay all that much attention until a just Sorted first year Slytherin sat down opposite them. Taehyung smiled at him. The first year promptly looked like he was going to faint.</p><p>Yoongi nudged Taehyung with his elbow. “Stop that,” he said.</p><p>Taehyung looked at him innocently. “Stop what? I smiled at him. I was being friendly.”</p><p>Yoongi snorted. “You didn’t just smile,” he said. Taehyung was anything but innocent. He didn’t know how Jungkook survived.</p><p>Because the thing about Taehyung was that he was half-Veela. There weren’t any male full Veela and very few male half-Veela. Veela blood just tended to produce females. But even being male, with his Veela blood, there were very few people who could resist Taehyung, especially when he made an effort. His combination of long wavy black hair and come hither-let’s fuck eyes certainly didn’t help.</p><p>It had actually worried Yoongi and the others in the beginning, when they learned that Jungkook and Taehyung were together. But then they’d gotten to know Jungkook, and it had been quickly apparent that super-seducing powers or not, Taehyung was just as gone for Jungkook as Jungkook was for him.</p><p>Following the Sorting, the tables filled with food. Yoongi ignored the beginning of the year announcements given by Deputy Headmistress Magorian in favor of the lamb ribs and pumpkin pasties before him. But when Headmaster Rookwood wrapped his goblet with a knife, Yoongi abruptly remembered Jin’s teasing from the train. He exchanged a glance with Taehyung who had a similar glint in his eye.</p><p>“What do you think it is?” Taehyung asked.</p><p>“We’re about to find out,” Yoongi said dryly.</p><p>“Welcome all,” Rookwood’s voice boomed out through the Great Hall. “Welcome back to another year at Hogwarts. And to our first years, a very warm welcome for the first time. This year we have a special announcement of the most unusual kind.”</p><p>Rookwood paused for effect, and his gaze moved over the hall as if he could land on each student. First years quickly learned that Rookwood had a flare for the dramatic. His long black and white streaked hair only added to his image, and bets were placed every year over whether it was natural or not. They still didn’t have an answer.</p><p>“Along with our first years, we are welcoming some additional new students.” Rookwood swept his hand to gesture at the doors. Everyone turned to look. “Long have they been our neighbors in the Forbidden Forest. Please join me in welcoming three centaur students to Hogwarts!”</p><p>The Great Hall’s doors swung open in the shocked silence that followed Rookwood’s announcement. And indeed, there stood three centaurs, two women and a man. It was hard to tell their ages, and Yoongi knew that centaurs had longer lifespans than humans, but they looked young. One of the women had deep auburn hair that matched her equine body. She wore a Hogwarts polo that looked uncomfortable, as if she wasn’t used to wearing shirts like that. The other woman had deep black hair and darker skin, while the man was all chestnut. They approached in a group that looked defensive to Yoongi’s eyes, but maybe he was sympathizing too much.</p><p>“Professor Magorian,” Rookwood clapped his hands. “Bring back the Sorting Hat. We have three new students to Sort.”</p><p>Rookwood wasn’t stupid. Far from it. But Yoongi suspected that he sometimes got carried away by his own excitement. Either that or Rookwood was purposefully ignoring the tension that had filled the hall.</p><p>Centaurs had been given the option of being classified as Beings by the Ministry of Magic, but they had turned it down in favor of Beasts. They claimed they hadn’t wanted to be labeled Dark Creatures along with hags and vampires. Nevertheless, they often occupied similar spaces as wizards due to their proficiency in the divining arts.</p><p>The Sorting was done in strained silence as one by one, the three centaurs were Sorted into Ravenclaw. Confused and smattered applause filled the Great Hall. Yoongi tried to see Namjoon but he couldn’t from his seat.</p><p>The Second Wizarding War had ended over twenty years ago and a lot had changed. Purebloods, while still making up the upper crust of wizarding society no longer held the same domineering power as they’d once held. People were generally more accepting of various half-breeds and creatures, and the practice of enslaving house elves had been almost entirely abolished. But none of that progress was to say that anyone was comfortable with centaurs being students at Hogwarts. Yoongi could already see the flood of aggressive parental letters that was going to descend upon Hogwarts in the coming week.</p><p>Rookwood smiled brilliantly when the last centaur took her place at the Ravenclaw table. “Excellent,” he said. “Now, with that settled–”</p><p>But Rookwood’s speech was interrupted as the doors were abruptly flung open once again. Yoongi’s whole body tensed. A woman stood framed in the doorway. Her clothes were worn and ripped, and she was covered in dirt and dried blood. But none of that was what made Yoongi catch his breath in panic. The paleness of her skin was unmistakable as were the fangs protruding from her teeth and her red eyes that spoke of severe blood deficiency.</p><p>She was a vampire.</p><p>There was an instant uproar. The cry of “Vampire!” was taken up along with “Dark Creature!” Students everywhere stood up and the ones closest to the doors backed away.</p><p>In the cacophony of voices, Rookwood shouted, “SILENCE!”</p><p>Silence fell and the woman stumbled forward between the tables. She was clearly injured or very sick. “Sanctuary,” she gasped. “Please, I ask for sanctuary.”<br/>
The silence this time was shocked.</p><p>“Sanctuary from what?” Rookwood asked.</p><p>“I’m being hunted, please–” but then the woman collapsed onto the flagstones.</p><p>Students jumped up again and Rookwood called, “Madam Everard, please take this woman to the Infirmary.”</p><p>From the head table, Madame Everard jumped up and hurried to do so. A moment later, she had vanished with a still motionless vampire. Unlike centaurs, vampires were classified as Beings, the same class as wizards and muggles. But they were also generally considered to be Dark Creatures and widely reviled by the wizarding community.</p><p>Rookwood clapped his hands once again. “That is more than enough excitement for one evening,” he said briskly. “Prefects, please escort your Houses to their dormitories. Classes will begin tomorrow and you all need your sleep. Announcements will be made as necessary.”</p><p>The moment students stood up, Yoongi darted away, ignoring Taehyung’s surprised shout. He knew Jin would be leading the Gryffindors away, so he hurried over to the Ravenclaw table. With relief, Yoongi found Namjoon waiting for him. Namjoon immediately enveloped Yoongi in a hug and rested his chin on top of Yoongi’s head.</p><p>“C’mon,” Namjoon murmured. “Let’s go back to Jin’s. He will join us as soon as he can.”</p><p>Yoongi nodded but didn’t trust himself to speak. There was too much tension in the air, most of it directed at the vampire woman.</p><p>Sleeping arrangements were always a question to be solved given that they were all in different Houses. Technically they slept in their House dormitory. First years all slept together and then after that they branched into rooms of two or three. In previous years, Yoongi, Namjoon, and Jin ended up making deals with their roommates, but this year Jin had a room to himself in the Gryffindor dormitory as a prefect.</p><p>Yoongi followed Namjoon to the Gryffindor common room, saying hello to the Fat Lady on their way inside. Calls of “glad to see nothing’s changed over the summer” greeted his and Namjoon’s entrance, but Yoongi ignored them in favor of hunting down Jin’s room. The moment they closed the door behind them, Yoongi jumped onto the bed and muttered an enlargement charm to make the bed big enough to fit three people. A moment later, Namjoon joined him.</p><p>Yoongi curled into him, grateful for his larger frame. “There’s a vampire at Hogwarts,” he muttered into Namjoon’s chest.</p><p>Namjoon rubbed a hand across his back in soothing circles. “I know.”</p><p>“They’re going to kill her, if they haven’t already.”</p><p>Namjoon was silent for a minute. “I think Rookwood would try to stop that.”</p><p>Yoongi shook his head. “Did you see the students’ faces? They wanted to kill her the moment they saw her.”</p><p>“We’re not going to let anything happen to you,” Namjoon said soothingly.</p><p>“It’s not just about me!” Yoongi snapped.</p><p>Namjoon’s hand didn’t stop rubbing Yoongi’s back, but he also didn’t say anything.</p><p>“Sorry,” Yoongi muttered.</p><p>He felt Namjoon take a breath, but then the door opened and the bed dipped and Yoongi felt Jin curl up against his back. An arm wrapped around his waist and Jin murmured in his ear, “How you doing, love?”</p><p>“Fine,” Yoongi muttered.</p><p>He felt Jin shake behind him in what could only be a laugh. “Of course you are, love.” Then Jin’s broad shoulders tightened over Yoongi’s back.</p><p>“Shut up,” Yoongi grumbled. But the light teasing helped him breathe easier.</p><p>“There is something else we wanted to talk to you about,” Namjoon murmured.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>“We were thinking that we should tell the others.”</p><p>Yoongi jerked his head up to stare at Namjoon. Then he swung around to look at Jin. Both of them looked serious. Jin jumped in before Yoongi found his voice. “Taehyung could never hate you for that, and Jungkook could never go against Taehyung. And even if Taehyung wasn’t in the picture, Jungkook idolizes you. And I’m pretty sure that Jimin is incapable of hating anything, and Hoseok has only ever been supportive of us.”</p><p>“If there’s anything that could upset them, it’s the fact that we’ve kept it from them this long,” Namjoon added.</p><p>Intellectually, Yoongi knew they were right. But the thought of voicing it out loud still sent terror flooding through him. “Fine,” he muttered.</p><p>“Fine?” Namjoon repeated clearly surprised.</p><p>“Yes, fine, let’s tell them,” Yoongi said. He grabbed Namjoon’s arm and drew it to his mouth. His eyes flicked up to meet Namjoon’s.</p><p>Namjoon’s eyes softened and he nodded. “Take whatever you need,” he said softly.</p><p>Yoongi swallowed and licked the skin, breathing in the scent of blood rushing beneath the surface. Then he bit, breaking the skin and blood rushed into his fangs. He inhaled it greedily and a buzz filled his mind, soothing away his anxiety.</p><p>Because if the school was ready to attack a wounded vampire on sight, what would they do to a half-vampire masquerading as one of their own?</p><p> </p>
