    <p>Remus wasn’t surprised to find that Sirius was out by the lake again. As he approached him, he could see the numerous half-empty bottles of firewhisky surrounding him. Hogwarts curfew was long gone, and there was a soft stillness to the night that surrounded them.</p><p>“I wish you would stop sitting out here so late. It worries me,” Remus said as he took a seat in the grass a foot away from Sirius.</p><p>Sirius did not startle at Remus’ words, and Remus’ reasoning behind them hung unspoken in the chilly night air. Remus didn’t want Sirius so close to the water when he was this drunk. He had told Sirius that before, but both boys didn’t expect nights like these to end anytime soon.</p><p>“I’ll be okay,” Sirius responded, his voice low and heavy with alcohol.</p><p>Sirius’ words felt like a joke when Remus really thought about them. He knew he was responding to Remus’ worry over sitting out so late, but with all these bottles around them, and the quiet sound of Sirius throwing pebbles into the lake, Remus wondered if they were true; if Sirius really would be okay someday.</p><p>He looked up at him, taking in his ivory skin and the way his dark hair seemed to be falling in his face more often these days. Sirius had hollow cheekbones and a sharp jawline that made his face all sharp wonderful angles with perfect black hair to frame it.</p><p>Sirius was attractive.</p><p>It wasn’t something Remus could lie about. Everybody knew it, and not just all the girls that Sirius took out, but even all of Sirius’ mates. James knew it, Peter knew it, Sirius definitely knew it, so Remus didn’t feel bad admitting it himself.</p><p>Sirius might have grown much taller since they were little, stronger too, but lately there was something about the way that Sirius’ appearance had changed over the years that Remus couldn’t stand seeing.</p><p>Remus’ gaze must have been strong enough to draw Sirius from his drunken stupor because Sirius turned into it, staring right back. And that was when Remus could see so clearly the thing that drove him mad.</p><p>Sirius’ eyes used to be a gray color that lit up the room every time he laughed, but now all Remus could see in them was the heavy weight of life. A weight that had drawn all the light from his gray eyes and filled them with something akin to sadness.</p><p>“What do you find so fascinating, that you can’t help but stare at me?” Sirius asked, his voice slurring in a way that his usual confident self only did on nights like these.</p><p>“Your eyes are not looking as gray as they used to,” Remus whispered.</p><p>There was something about the night that made Remus want to whisper. Maybe it was because it was already so quiet that any kind of disturbance seemed wrong and much too harsh. Or maybe Remus just hoped Sirius wouldn’t hear him.</p><p>“They’re the same,” Sirius assured Remus before turning back towards the lake.</p><p>The lake was pretty. It was a moonless night, which meant Remus did not have to avoid the ugly reflection of the moon on the water and could instead enjoy the look of the stars filling up the night sky.</p><p>It was hard to stay focused on the water, though. Remus was curious about what had happened to bring Sirius out here again tonight because, despite what Sirius said, there was always a reason. The silence dragged on until Remus could not take it any longer.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it?” he asked.</p><p>Sirius took another swig from a bottle and sighed.</p><p>“It’s nothing worth your time.”</p><p>“Sirius,” Remus started, “you’re always worth my time.”</p><p>Sirius turned his head sharply to where Remus sat, trailing his eyes from where Remus was playing with the grass between his fingers to his shadowed face. He stared until Remus wouldn’t let him anymore and met Sirius with an exasperated look.</p><p>“Well then it’s a good thing this isn’t about me,” Sirius finally said.</p><p>“Your parents?” Remus guessed.</p><p>Sirius glared at him with cold eyes.</p><p>“Drop it Remus.” He snarled, whipping his head away again so that he could angrily glare at the water.</p><p>They both sat in silence for a bit. Remus didn’t feel bad for asking because he knew Sirius felt bad for snapping at him. He also knew that Sirius would tell him eventually anyways. He never seemed to have a filter when he got this drunk.</p><p>Just as Remus was about to speak up again, a soft weight fell on his shoulder and the smell of alcohol and leather filled up his senses. Looking down, Remus could only see Sirius’ dark eyelashes and black hair. It was falling into his face, but he didn’t seem bothered by it.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Sirius whispered, his hand absently tracing circles in the grass next to where Remus was picking at it.</p><p>“Tell me what’s wrong,” Remus mumbled back, tilting his head towards Sirius as he spoke so that his words were whispered directly into the boy’s soft hair.</p><p>“It’s nothing really,” there was a long pause. “It’s just, I got another letter today from my parents about becoming a Death Eater.”</p><p>Sirius’ words were all slurred together and hushed from how he was angling his head.</p><p>“They can’t be serious. They know you’re not on their side by now.”</p><p>Sirius audibly scoffed and sat up a little. “Please. What they <em>think </em>they know is that their prized pure-blooded son is just going through a terrible phase, and I’ll come back to them eventually. All I need is a little pushing.”</p><p>Sirius’ words were cold as ice and had the cutting edge of a sword. He threw another rock into the water, but this time much harsher.</p><p>“A little reminder here and there,” he said, and threw a rock. “A letter once and a while.” His words were getting louder and angrier, cutting into the peace that the night once had. “Put me in my place when I come home.” He threw another rock. “Because their perfect little son is still in there. Maybe enough crucios will draw him out.”</p><p>It was only on this type of night that Sirius had outbursts like these. It was only the influence of alcohol and Remus sitting beside him that would bring Sirius to actually voice his pain. His anger.</p><p>Remus placed his hand on Sirius’ before he could throw another rock. He knew that Sirius’ parents had used the cruciatus curse on him, but Sirius didn’t talk about it often, so he didn’t know how to respond.</p><p>“What if they’re right?” Sirius muttered.</p><p>“Sirius stop,” Remus said, his voice pained. “The only opinions that matter are those from the people who actually know you. James, Peter, Lily,” there was a barely noticeable pause, “me.”</p><p>Sirius nodded like he already knew that somewhere deep inside.</p><p>“And what’s your opinion?” Sirius said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“About me. If you know me so well, what is Moony’s opinion about the famous pure-blooded Sirius Black?”</p><p>Remus smirked softly to himself, thinking of all the things he could say. He didn’t even know where to start. Did he begin with first year when a very loud and excitable Sirius Black had taken in Remus as a friend without taking no for an answer. Remus, who in first year had scars all over and a terrible habit of stuttering.</p><p>Did he bring up the time in second year when Sirius had gotten a whole month of detention for fighting every last Slytherin in a group that had ganged up on Remus in the halls.</p><p>Glancing at Sirius and seeing him with his glazed over eyes made Remus wonder if he even remembered that he had asked a question in the first place.</p><p>“My opinion is that Sirius Black should really drink less.”</p><p>Sirius burst out laughing and turned to look at Remus, his eyes sparkling.</p><p>“But then when would I ever get time alone with my precious Moons?”</p><p>Remus tried to ignore the way his stomach fluttered at Sirius’ words. </p><p>“Come on Pads; lets get you back to the dorms.”</p><p>Remus looked down at Sirius and sighed. It was not going to be easy getting him back to their room. Sirius looked up at Remus and smiled his stupid little innocent smile like he knew exactly what Remus was thinking. </p><p>“Oh come on,” he said, grabbing Sirius by the arm, and hauling him up, ready to fall into bed and never wake up again.</p>
