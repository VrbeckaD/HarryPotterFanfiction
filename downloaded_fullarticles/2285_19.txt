    <p align="left">Everything I know about my life can be summed up into five things. These five things are things I know as a fact, as an undeniable truth, and cannot and will not change in my life. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">One, my brother and I will always have each other, no matter what.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Two, I am not loved by my aunt and uncle, if anything they resent my existence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Three, if I do not do anything for myself no one else will.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Four, no matter what I do I cannot make everyone happy.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Five, no matter what happens life will continue to go on, with or without me.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">These five things make up the foundation of who I am.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Who am I? I never did introduce myself did I? I'm Helena, Helena Lily Potter, and yes as in that Potter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I can't tell you about my birth. I don't remember it. I cannot tell you about most of my infant years, I don't remember much. All I remember is chilling laughter and my mother's pleas. I hear the monster who took my parents away from me try to take my brother away from me too. I see that acid green light. Then I feel the worst pain imaginable as the backlash of the extraordinary magic that spared my brothers life washed over me. I feel the pain of a lifetime of memories fill my head. I feel what it means to be reborn. And let me tell you it is nothing like you can imagine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Everything has a price. What makes you think that being reborn, of gaining memories of a past life doesn't. My parents are dead, my brother will forever be marked by a monster's attempt to murder him and I will always be torn between now and what used to be.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I can't say I don't think about my past life. I do, and sometimes it hurts. I have had a lot of time, nine years now, to get over myself and move past the urge to wish I was back in that life. That doesn't mean that my past life doesn't still affect me because it does. It has shaped me, made me stronger and made me aware of life and death and the inbetween. It made me surprisingly well adjusted. I know that life moves on and that makes it all the more important because I know that I want to go to my death having lived the very best life I could. To make sure that those I care about live the very best life they can.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The fact that the life I live now used to be a book series, well, mostly used to be a book series, seems pretty unimportant compared to everything else. I mean being reborn in general kind makes it hard for the little things to really freak you out.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That, and when I am curled up with my brother in the room that would have once been my cousin’s spare, it's hard to ever think of him as a book character. He's breathing and existing right beside me and I can't help but love him. I can't help but love this life simply because it's mine. Life is something I remember all too clearly can be taken away suddenly. So, why would I spend this second chance freaking out about what can't change?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I am not sure where I am going with this. Or if I started telling you this story the right way. I probably messed this beginning all up, but I guess that's a bit like life, it doesn't start pretty. It's a bloody mess honestly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Like life, this story of mine will be a bloody mess, because the story I am about to tell you is about my life.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Crap, why is so hard to write beginnings? Even the beginning of your own story. You'd think that would make it easy. It doesn't.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Let me try again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The night when my brother and I became orphans, my brother got a scar and I got the memories of my past life. This is how this story starts. In death and surviving past it.</p><p> </p>
