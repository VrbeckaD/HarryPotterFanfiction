It's the day after the first task of The Triwizard Tournament, but our story follows what Marcus Flint is doing with his boyfriend Theodore Nott after returning from his busy Quidditch career.</p><p>Theodore asked, "What do you plan on doing with me today, Marc?"</p><p>Marcus smirked.

"Now, what's this about a stroll?"</p><p>Theodore grabbed his hand and beamed, "I hear the lake is beautiful this time of year."</p></div>
