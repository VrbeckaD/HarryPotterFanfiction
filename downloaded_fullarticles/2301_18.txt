Rapid clicks of keys on the door made Harry stop his nightly talk with the caged Hedwig. The door was slammed open and there stood uncle with a frown.<br/>
<br/>
“ Get your things .”<br/>
<br/>
“Why?”<br/>
<br/>
The question made uncle Vernon's already scarlet face even redder. His left eye twitch and his hands curled into a fist but his uncle only sputtered out.<br/>
<br/>
“ You’re leavening, boy!”<br/>
<br/>
What?!</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"><br/>
<br/>
So as it turned out his escorted to the magic world, Professor Snape was now not only his head of the house but also his potion teacher.<br/>
<br/>
He was a strict man, Freddy could tell, a strict, cold man who, for some reason, had a burning hatred for his friend Harry.<br/>
<br/>
Things Draco claimed to be missing? Blame it on Harry first before figuring it out that it was in Draco’s trunk all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Potion exploded? Blame it on Harry and completely ignored that Harry didn’t even touch it.<br/>
<br/>
Shoes on the floor? ” Potter, Slytherin does not tolerate littering. You are not an ape, pick up your clothes.”<br/>
<br/>
” Professor that’s Goyle.”<br/>
<br/>
And really Freddy was about done it with the old man.<br/>
<br/>
“You're not bothered by this?” He asked after Professor Snape has done scolding Harry for the day.<br/>
<br/>
“ Not really,” Harry shrugged. “ It’s way worse back home.”<br/>
<br/>
And it was at the moment that Freddy knew what Harry’s home life was like. </p><p align="center"> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"><br/>
Not Slytherin he wanted to argue. Not Slytherin with Draco who insulted Hagrid, not Slytherin where wizards went bad, not Slytherin where Freddy Freeman now sat.<br/>
<br/>
Harry didn’t get a chance to argued. Well, it was more like he didn’t. He just sat there as the hat yelled Slytherin on the top of its non-existing lungs.<br/>
<br/>
It was fine he thought, he got Freddy. One of his very first friends by his side and that was fine.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p align="center"><br/>
Red eyes darted around the forest. Harry watched in horror as a green light strike a beautiful horse-like creature, burned into its flesh before it died. As dark incomprehensible whispers filled his ears. A feeling of something dark and evil surrounded him.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted to close his eyes, to move, to do something to end this but he couldn’t.<br/>
<br/>
Until…<br/>
<br/>
The whispers become gentler and kinder. Harry focused on it, he pushed away from the vision and ignored everything as he focused on the whispers. While he was still unable to understand it said but Harry could feel the comfort in it.<br/>
<br/>
Before he drifted away once again he could have sworn he heard a whisper of ‘I’ll take care of you’</p><p align="center"> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"><br/>
<br/>
“ You should eat more,” Freddy repeated Billy’s favourite sentence to Harry as he eyed his roommate shirtless form.<br/>
<br/>
“ Oh, not you too.” Harry groaned putting on his shirt.<br/>
<br/>
“ Harry your basically skin and bones.” Freddy said flatly.<br/>
<br/>
“ Potter he had a point.” Blaise Zabini, who tolerated both Freddy and Harry at this point, injected from the other side of the room. </p><p align="center"> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"><br/>
After the first week at Hogwarts Harry could say that he had gotten, somewhat, used to Malfoy’s antics. He could say Freddy had too.<br/>
<br/>
Until Malfoy started to sabotage Harry’s potion in class. The first time it had happened, Harry was fortunate enough that his lab partner Freddy managed to catch it. The second time though not so much.<br/>
<br/>
“ Oh, no.” Freddy said, louder than necessary but very convincing. “ I put the Matriat roots in first instead of Newt tongue, sorry Harry.”<br/>
<br/>
He tried to take the blame knowing that if he didn’t Snape would have pinned oh Harry. Freddy got himself detentions that weekend but Malfoy didn’t stop. It had gotten to that even when Harry was working with Ron and Freddy with Hermione far away from Malfoy, the boy still tried to cause them trouble.<br/>
<br/>
But then, Draco just stormed in the sleeping quarter one night. His hand gripping on his wands and he marched over Freddy and Harry who was in the middle of a game of go fish on the ground<br/>
<br/>
“ What lies did you tell professor Snape about me, mudblood?” He pointed his wand at Freddy who just stared at him flatly.<br/>
<br/>
“ Okay, first if my blood was mud I would have noticed.” Freddy was calm, joking even and Harry had no idea how he did that with a wand pointed at him. “ Second I hadn’t talked to professor Snape at all today. I was in the library nearly the whole day after class.”<br/>
<br/>
“ Do not lie you filthy muggle if it weren’t you then wh-”<br/>
<br/>
“ I did.” Came the voice of Blaise Zabini. Draco was shocked. “ What? Why Blaise.”<br/>
<br/>
“ Because you were damaging our house’s name, We were supposed to be united as a whole outside of the common room not playing petty tricks on each other. For Merlin’s sake even Weasley caught on to it.” Zabini, as usual, was calm, collected and posed no room for argument.<br/>
<br/>
Later when Draco stormed out of the room as angry as he had entered, Freddy turned to Zabini. “ So are we friends now or what?”<br/>
<br/>
“ Do not push your luck, Freeman, we are merely associate.”<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
“ Now, now there’s no need to shout at the kid.”  An American accented voice rang out, the one similar to Freddy’s. A woman walked and stand behind uncle Dudley. She was wearing a blue jacket and some kind of corset underneath it, she had black hair and blue eyes.<br/>
<br/>
 “ You must be Harry, I’m Zatanna Zatara, I’m a friend of Freddy.” The woman flashes him a gentle smile. Harry noted how she didn’t include his last name. The woman, Zatanna, turned to his uncle. “ As for you why don’t you og riatsnwod dna ngis taht eceip fo reppap.”<br/>
<br/>
His uncle body went stiff as he made his way downstairs. Harry turned wide eyes at Zatanna, the woman gave him a wink. “ Just a bit of magic. Now, let’s get you packed up now shall we.”<br/>
<br/>
She said some strange words and in an instant, Hedwig’s cage was opened. The next minutes went by with Harry gathered everything he has and Zatanna with a flick of her hand put them all neatly in the trunk. She led him downstairs with his trunk floating and Harry himself behind her. Down in the living room, Harry was greeted with a familiar face.<br/>
<br/>
“ Freddy!” A smile broke out on his face as the other mentioned boy, who sat on the couch sipping on a cup of tea as he stared at Harry’s aunt and cousin, turned to look at him.<br/>
<br/>
“ Harry my dude,” Freddy exclaimed grabbing his crutch and stood up. “ All ready to leave?”<br/>
<br/>
” Yep,” Zatanna answered for him while uncle Dudley handed her a piece of paper.<br/>
<br/>
” But-” he tried to mention Dumbledore’s reasoning however Freddy cut him off.<br/>
<br/>
“ Relax Har, we have a plan.” Freddy tucked his arm. “ Come on, we’ll explain outside.”<br/>
<br/>
Out on the lawn, there stood Mary, Billy and professor Tawny in front of a sleek black car.  They were discussing something with a strange man. He had blond messy hair and an equally messy trend coat. He could hear them saying something about a ward.<br/>
<br/>
“Well if this goes to court, we can argue that the ward is useless and we’re just acting on muggle law.” The man said and Mary nodded, jotting down something into a notebook.<br/>
<br/>
“ I guess that cover everything.” Billy concluded.<br/>
<br/>
Harry still very confused looked around at his three friends and three adults. “ Okay, what’s going on?”<br/>
<br/>
“ We’re kidnapping you.” Freddy replied and Billy at the same time said. “ We’re legally borrowing you.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry glanced at Mary for an explanation. She let out a long sigh before she cleared things up. “ we noticed that your aunt and uncle aren’t treating you very well and don’t say it’s fine Harry they let you sleep in a cupboard before you went to Hogwarts.”<br/>
<br/>
“ And since the teachers, ” Billy continued, fake coughing with a whisper of Dumbledore. “ refuse to do anything. We decided to get you out of the house.”<br/>
<br/>
“ So here we are!” Freddy finished.<br/>
<br/>
Harry took a step back and process his situation. “ But where am I supposed to stay? Uncle Dudley and Aunt Petunia are my last living relatives, except for aunt Marge but I don’t want to go live with her.”<br/>
<br/>
“ Well, I do believe Mr, Weasley did suggest his household to you in my class before .” His defence against the dark art teacher said and Harry's cheek flushes pink as he remembered Professor Tawny calling both him and Ron out for talking in class.<br/>
<br/>
Harry considered Ron’s house before remembering what Dumbledore said about Ron’s family. Mrs. and Mr. Weasley were nice and Harry would love to stay with them.<br/>
<br/>
“ Or,” Freddy drew out. “ You can come with us.”<br/>
<br/>
He blinked. “ To America?”<br/>
<br/>
“ To America,” Freddy confirmed giving Billy a look. Billy looked like he was thinking over the idea. “ Well, I do know someone who can help us with the paperwork stuff.”<br/>
<br/>
“ That’s lovely and all.” The man in trenchcoat spoke up. “ But I think we can all agree that if all of stood here any longer people will notice. So how about we get in the car and maybe go for some late night snack?”<br/>
<br/>
Everyone nodded in agreement and began making their way into the man’s car. Mary leaned in as she walks by. “ Just think about it, Harry.”</p>
