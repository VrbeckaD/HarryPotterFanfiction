    <p>Roy Mustang sat at his office desk, the Elric brothers looking expectantly at him, Edward sitting slouched in the chair in front of him with his cheek in his hand and Alphonse standing stiff and straight behind him.<br/>
“Why‘ve you called us in, Colonel?” Ed spoke up. “Is this about our screwup last time? I’ve already been hounded enough—“<br/>
“As angry as I am about last week’s...incident, this isn’t about that. This is something new.”<br/>
Ed quirked an eyebrow. Al stayed silent.<br/>
“You’ve been assigned a special mission. It’s a little out of the ordinary from what you two are used to. It won’t just involve you two going to scope something out this time. You’ve actually been asked to guard someone of great importance. A boy.”<br/>
Edward snorted. “This is a serious matter?”<br/>
“It’s nothing to scoff at. He’s very special for reasons even we don’t understand. All we know is that him and everyone around him is in great danger.”<br/>
He pulled out a book, opened it, and turned it towards the brothers. “He is currently set to attend a very prestigious school in England, which only a few know exists. It is said that they teach magic there—“<br/>
“And you believe that?” Ed scoffed.<br/>
“Brother.” Alphonse whispered, trying to get him to stop.<br/>
“As of right now, we have no idea what else it could be.” Mustang continued. “The point is, the people that go there and everyone surrounding them are under attack. The circumstances could be fatal for everyone involved. The school is heavily guarded and protected, but the staff is still skeptical, namely..”<br/>
He turned a page in the book, revealing a picture of a very old man, with bright blue eyes that sparkled in an unnatural way, even in the photo, peering through half-moon wire glasses and with light gray hair and a beard to match.<br/>
“Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of the school. He specifically feels that even with the precautions taken, the students, namely the boy, may be unsafe. So he’s asked for our help, telling me he’d heard about the infamous alchemist brothers with a reputation for being very skilled in their craft.”<br/>
“What do we have to do to protect him?” Al asked.<br/>
“You’ll have to go undercover as students at the school to avoid suspicion. I’m told the boy is already practically famous, so him being followed around by body guards will only draw more attention to him.”<br/>
Edward shifted in his chair so he was sitting upright. “Are you gonna tell us about the boy or are you gonna keep that part a mystery?”<br/>
“Finally got your attention, have I?” Roy said, turning a page in the book revealing another photo, this time of a boy. <br/>
A scrawny, pale boy with shaggy, unkempt black hair and unnaturally bright green eyes that sat behind a pair of broken circle lenses. The most striking this was the scar on his forehead, starting at his hairline, cutting through his right eyebrow and stopping just above his eye.<br/>
“His name is Harry Potter.” Roy spoke, his voice low and solemn. “He’s well known by those who know magic for surviving an attack by one of the most powerful wizards known to them, and the one that is the most feared. He was the only survivor. That’s where that scar came from.” <br/>
He pointed at the photo with his pen. “He’s known in the wizarding world as ‘The Boy Who Lived’ because surviving an attack like that should be impossible.”<br/>
Edward stared at the photo intently, unable to look away from it. As ridiculous as he found it that anyone could even think that magic was a possibility, he felt strongly that he needed to protect this Harry Potter. After everything he had just heard, he had the feeling him and Al may be his last hope.<br/>
“When do we start?” He asked, a determined look in his eyes.<br/>
“The beginning of September.” Mustang said. “And we’ll need to do some shopping beforehand.”</p>
