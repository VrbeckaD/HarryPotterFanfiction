    <p>A knocking came from the front door.  It had been a strange day for the Webb family, but visitors in the quiet apartment complex that they lived in was something well out of the ordinary.  The knock was polite and unrushed, which in of itself made it further an oddity to Julian Webb.  Andrew Webb grabbed his son and stepped out of view. Oddities in this part of town were not something to be taken lightly. Not when you were the openly gay couple, in a less than desirable part of town. Not with all the madness that was going on in the area of recent, so many unexplained disappearances. People dead with no indication as to how, and strange happenings all around. So when the knock came for a second time, Andrew Webb was hidden in the single bedroom, away from sight.</p><p>Julian Webb opened the door to find a strangely dressed man with a long grey beard that stretched halfway down his chest. There was a kindness twinkling in his eyes, and something very disarming about him, but what caused Julian to drop his guard, was the small newborn child with messy black hair, and dark brown eyes, babbling at him happily. The infant seemed too young for that, but Julian wasn’t the most knowledgeable when it came to babies.</p><p>“Hello,” said the bespectacled old man.  His soft voice showed his age, and further disarmed Julian.  “I am Albus Dumbledore, the Headmaster for a prestigious school in the hills of Scotland. If I could be so bold as to take a moment of your time, and the use of your sink, I would be quite appreciative.”</p><p>“Oh, uh, of course,” said Julian Webb.  “I am Julian Webb.  We weren’t expecting guests, so if you would forgive the mess.”</p><p>The house wasn’t too messy, but as a toddler ran amok in it on a daily basis, it was far from perfect.  Julian didn’t mind nearly as much as Andrew did, but both accepted that children would be children.  Sometimes one would have to walk a minefield of toys to enter the house, but thankfully tonight, the tripping hazard had been limited to a single corner of the house.</p><p>The kitchen was attached to the main room, and was hidden in a small alcove just past the front door.  Dumbledore immediately filled up a bottle with lukewarm water and formula.  Once Julian had left the room to assure Andrew that all was fine, Albus was able to purify the water with a flick of his wrist. The newborn in his arms cooed at the bottle waiting hungrily.  On some level, Dumbledore felt blessed by the child’s lack of fussiness and general agreeable nature.</p><p>“So what brings you to our humble home?” asked Andrew, as he came out of the bedroom with toddler Michael in his arms.  “We don’t usually get visitors.”</p><p>“I can’t imagine why, the both of you have been more than friendly,” said Dumbledore.  “But alas, the world can be cruel to people like us.  My visit today is to talk to you about your son, and to hopefully make an addition to your family.”</p><p>“You want us to take care of that babe?” asked Julian.  “Surely there are others better suited,  we have a hard enough time with just the three of us.”</p><p>“Well, if you would indulge me, I feel it is probably best to speak of your son first,” said Dumbledore.  “Perhaps over tea?”</p><p>“Oh yeah, that would be good,” said Andrew.  “Um, give me a second, we have a large variety, so whatever you want.  Julian can you get that?”</p><p>Julian nodded and started a pot of water.  It would be a bit before it would boil, as the stove in their apartment was less than stellar.  Still, the tea selection was quite extensive, and Julian always enjoyed picking new ones at the store.</p><p>“Oh any will do,” said Dumbledore.  “Surprises are always pleasant.”</p><p>Andrew led Dumbledore into the living room, which was still joined, but it still seemed like the polite thing to do.  The Webbs only had one couch and a coffee table, as entertaining guests had never come up in their time together,  at least, not at the house.  When Andrew offered Dumbledore the only seat in the house, Dumbledore just smiled and brought out his wand.  It was a breach of the law, but that was what he was going to do anyway.  No one outside of the room would know either way.  With a flick of his wrist, a couch popped out of nothing and into existence across from the original.  It was a bit of an older one, with frayed armrests and a green velvet upholstery, outdated for this decade.  Andrew nearly dropped Michael as he stared at the wizard across from him</p><p>“H-h-how?” asked Andrew.</p><p>“Oh, I am sure you know that,” said Dumbledore.  “Magic after all, is most’s first guess, but, why now? That is a question to be asked.  Normally a wizard such as myself would not reveal this to a muggle, one with no magic, but as you eventually would have been told, a bit of an early explanation is in order. I need a favor of you. Magic is as real as anything else.  I am headmaster of a school that teaches young witches and wizards how to use magic.  A school, that in the future, young Michael will attend.”</p><p>“Michael is a wizard?” Andrew asked in disbelief.  “Honey, come in here. You need to listen to this.”</p><p> </p><p>“I can hear from here,” said Julian.  “Besides, that explains this morning.  I told you it was magic.”</p><p>“Ah yes,” said Dumbledore.  “Would you mind explaining what happened?”</p><p>“I cut my finger earlier today, making lunch,” said Julian as he came into the living room with a tray of tea makings.  “The knife slipped and I almost lost a finger.  Andrew came over holding Michael, and when Michael saw my finger, he screamed, then magically my finger was fixed.  It was the most amazing thing!  Well, until you made a couch out of nothing.”</p><p>“Quite an interesting use of accidental magic,” said Dumbledore.  “The wizarding world will be better for having Michael in it, healers are in high demand.  Do not fret about funding for Michael’s schooling.  Hogwarts sets aside some funds for muggle-born wizards each year.  Sadly, it is less than I would want provided, but it covers the basic needs of each student.  Budget concerns are a matter for the board of directors, and they tend to be a bit difficult to sway. Alas, that is neither here nor there. I would ask that you keep this knowledge from Michael, as young lips are want to spill secrets. At least until his eleventh birthday, when he will receive his acceptance letter from Hogwarts, as is tradition.  The following year’s schooling will be at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“If he would have been told on his eleventh birthday, why tell us now?” asked Andrew.  “Why keep it a secret?”</p><p>“There is a law in the wizarding world, prohibiting the revealing of magic to muggles.  A law that I have now broken by telling you two.  You would have been informed on Michael’s eleventh birthday, as the law allows for that, but to tell you now is a breech,” said Dumbledore.  He took a sip of his tea and was pleasantly surprised by the flavor.  He would have to get more of this on his way home.  “Great choice of tea.  As for the why, that is because I need a favor from you.  One that I feel would not do well to ask of you, unless you know some details.”</p><p>“What sort of details?  Is that babe a wizard or witch too?”  asked Julian.</p><p>“That they are, but no, it is the parentage of the child that is most pressing.  Normally when a child who has no family that will take them in the Wizarding world, they end up in muggle orphanages.  From my experience they never get adopted.  Young Witches and Wizards can not control their magic, and so weird, unexplained things happen around them.  Things that make them undesirable to be adopted.  I wish the case was different, but it has not been a high priority with what is going on now,” said Dumbledore.  “The wizarding world is at war with a powerful dark wizard.  As there are evil muggles, there are evil wizards.  Most are not so inclined, but some are.  This younglings parents are one such group.  Their mother gave the child up, trying to hide them from their father. The person who she gave them to, has passed away.  I wish to spare this child the grief of knowing that their father is a mass murderer.”</p><p>“Is the babe safe?  Can we trust them?” asked Andrew.  “You are asking us to take in the child of a murderer, but I have to look out for Michael first.”</p><p>“No child is born evil.  Jealousy and hatred sink into them as the world feeds them such things.  I want something better than that for the babe.  If given a loving family and home, then it is likely they will not follow in their parents' footsteps,” said Dumbledore.</p><p>“So why us?” asked Julian.  “Surely there are others who could do a better job at this than us.  Growing up with two dads isn’t going to be the most peaceful of lives.”</p><p>“Sadly, I think you are right on that last bit.  But I want them to understand that those who are different than us are human still.  That those differences are small compared to that,” said Dumbledore.  “Further, I think your family will do wonderful.  A caring older brother and two fathers who are willing to fight for their family will most assuredly give them the love they so badly need.”</p><p>“Julian, I think we should do this.  We wanted a sibling for Michael and this way we don’t have to go through the mess that was getting Michael again.  Dumbledore is right, the babe does deserve a loving family.  We can give them that,” said Andrew.</p><p>“Okay,” said Julian.  “You’re right.  We will do it.”</p><p>“Great,” said Dumbledore.  “I understand that funds may be a problem with a sudden addition to the family and I would like to put that to ease for you.  I can provide a bit of child support each month for them.  Also, as a way of saying thank you and to provide a better life later for these two I shall set up a small stipend for the two of them out of my personal pocket.  It will more than cover their needs during school and for a while after.”</p><p>“Thank you,” said Andrew.  “What is the baby's name?”</p><p>“I don’t know.  I assume that the child’s mother gave them one, but I was not informed of it.  Further still I think that such a shadow might be best lifted from them.  I had no right to name them, but you do,” said Dumbledore.</p><p>“Well, that leaves it to you, Julian,” said Andrew.  “I am horrible at names.”</p><p>“Well can I hold them for a bit?” said Julian.  “I need to get a feel for them.”</p><p>Dumbledore handed the newborn over to Julian and then proceeded to drink a second cup of tea.  It truly was one of the best tea’s he had had in a while.  Dumbledore wanted to have more time, but the longer he stayed, the more likely it would be that those the babe was to be hidden from would find this young family.  The world had enough tragedy it needed no more.</p><p>“I must bid you farewell,” said Dumbledore.  “My duties as a headmaster are never done and my other responsibilities are such that I sadly can’t take much more time here.  Thank you for that and here is the first month support.”</p><p>He left an envelope on the coffee table and with a slight pop disappeared from the Webbs house.  Andrew and Julian Webb were still just trying to process what had happened.  For one of them magics realness was the focus of his thoughts, but for Julian it was the babe that now was cradled in his arms.  A little baby boy.</p><p>“What do you think of Blake?” asked Julian.  “It means light and dark.”</p><p>“Blake Webb sounds good.  I think you have a new name now little one,” said Andrew.  He scooped up Michael, who had been uncharacteristically quiet for the Dumbledore’s visit.  “Met your new brother Michael.  I know you will look after him too.”</p><p>“Brother,” said Michael.  “My brother.”</p>
