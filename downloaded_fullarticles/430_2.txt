  <em>What the…?</em>
</p><p>A streak of bright blue hair was the only thing Draco managed to catch before the three-feet-and-a-bit menace disappeared around the corner at the end of the aisle. He had almost lost his balance as the boy rushed past him close enough for his bony shoulder to crash into Draco’s thigh.</p><p> “Teddy?!”</p><p>And now someone was hollering too? In the middle of Flourish and Blotts? <em>Blithering idiots</em>. Draco grunted, absentmindedly stroking his bruised leg as he turned back to the book in his hand. It looked promising, just what he’d been looki—</p><p>“Teddy? Teddy, where did you– <em>Malfoy?</em>”</p><p>Draco jumped at the sound of his name, snapping his head up to stare into the emerald eyes of Harry fucking Potter.</p><p><em>Oh fuck</em>.</p><p>Not that Draco wasn’t used to seeing the man, they saw each other in Auror training every day, but then he was usually prepared. Prepared to shove his inappropriate emotions into a dark corner of his heart. Prepared to act aloof and detached and uninterested; things he really wasn’t, had never been.</p><p>In fact, he had been perfectly able to deny and ignore those feelings for years, before— before New Year’s.

Are you alright?”</p><p>“Yes,” Draco lied, heart speeding, barely breathing.</p><p>“I’m— Can I treat you to some ice cream, as an apology? If you’re available, that is. We were just heading to Fortescue’s.”</p><p>“If you insist,” Draco found himself saying.</p><p>“I do,” Potter grinned, lifting up the menace — now hugging a giant teddy bear — and nodding towards the book in Draco’s hand. “Are you buying that?”</p><p>“No,” Draco murmured, returning the <em>Chief Muggle Handbook: Navigating Through Muggle Culture</em> to its proper place on the shelf.</p><p>“Then let’s go. Teddy, this is your cousin; Draco Malfoy.”</p><p><em>Oh</em>.</p></div>
