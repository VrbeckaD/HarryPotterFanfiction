    <p>A piercing, ringing sound filled the small bedroom. Tina awoke with a start and squinted at her alarm clock before rolling over and slapping it with her palm. She rolled from her side to her stomach with a groan. She stretched her arms and legs as she burrowed her face into her pillow to block out the early morning sunlight. </p>
<p>Coffee. She needed coffee.</p>
<p>Tina flung the blankets off of her and clumsily rolled to the edge of the bed, shivering as the cooler mid-August air of her bedroom touched her heated legs. She rubbed her eyes with the heel of her hands before running her fingers through her sleep-tousled hair. She pushed herself up with a sigh and padded across the wooden floor of the bedroom to push open the heavy pocket door leading to the apartment’s living space. It was eerily quiet this early in the morning. The sun had just risen and its golden rays streamed in through the windows giving a bright orange glow to the room before her. It was August nineteenth—her birthday. Tina was twenty-seven today.</p>
<p>As she made her way across the creaking floorboards to the kitchen, she remembered why she was awake so early on a Sunday. She sighed with frustration as she gathered the coffee beans and percolator, sliding them across the counter towards the sink. Today the members of the International Security Task Force would be arriving. Witches and wizards from all around the world would be convening at MACUSA and the security forces had been nearly doubled for the next few days. Tina knew that the long hours of patrols and trying to stay on top of her regular caseload was going to take a toll on her. She eyed the coffee beans and added a few more to her hand grinder. She would need an extra serving of her morning pick-me-up to get through.</p>
<p>As she placed her brew onto the stove to boil, Tina shuffled back to her bedroom. She averted her eyes from the untouched bed across the room that used to belong to her sister and made her way to the wardrobe in the corner. She picked out a smart-looking outfit, charcoal grey slacks with a short-sleeved, cream-colored blouse and a matching grey blazer. She took her clothing and toiletries bag out of her bedroom and made her way toward the apartment door. She flicked her wand toward the stove on her way across the threshold, setting her coffee to pour itself as she let the door fall closed behind her with a soft click.</p>
<p>Tina strode quietly down the hallway toward the shared bathroom, careful not to wake the other tenants in the building. She slipped inside, closing the door behind her, and made her way across the cold tile to the mirror hanging above the yellowed sink. She quickly showered and performed her morning ablutions. She dressed with care and dried her hair with a wave of her wand. It was slightly longer now, just meeting her shoulders, and the longer strands settled in a slight wave that framed her face in a soft and becoming sort of way. She carefully placed her golden locket around her neck and checked her reflection one last time. It would have to do for today.</p>
<p>Tina checked her wristwatch, seeing that she had only ten minutes before she needed to leave, and hurried back to her kitchen. She grabbed a couple of slices of bread and toasted them with her wand before adding a bit of jam to each. She sat at the table and ate hurriedly, washing her toast down with gulps of hot black coffee. She sent her dishes to the sink with a flick of her wand to wash as she made her way to the door to grab her wallet and slip her feet into her sensible black shoes. She locked her door and slipped down the stairs and out into the warm summer morning air. Taking a deep breath, she began her walk toward MACUSA’s employee entrance.</p>
<p>Her morning walk was refreshing, and it was her daily time to think. She used to love her walk to work, but now it was a chance for her mind to rehash old memories and remind her of how very alone she was. It had been nearly a year since Paris. Ten months and twenty-eight days to be exact. Ten months and twenty-eight days since she had seen her sister walk through flames, since her life was saved by the woman she had feared and been jealous of for months, since she had walked away from a cemetery filled with soot and the scent of charred flesh. That day, her life had changed forever, and now she was back in New York. Everything seemed normal to those she saw every day, but despite her collected outward appearance she still walked through life with a feeling of anticipation and dread, as if something may happen at any moment. She fingered the letter in her pocket, the smooth paper calming her as she walked. It had arrived last night, full of news from across the ocean, and it was her lifeline.</p>
<p>Tina hoped something would happen soon. She was stuck and longed to relocate, to put New York behind her and start fresh. Her sister was gone and she now was forced to live alone. She had no family, few friends, and only her job to get her through, which she threw herself into-- heart and soul.</p>
<p>After the events at Pere Lachaise, Tina traveled between Paris and London as she worked on loan to the Ministry of Magic. She collected evidence, documented the case as the investigative delegate for MACUSA, and shared that information with Theseus Scamander, her temporary supervisor. While in London, she stayed with Newt and Jacob in Newt’s small flat. She spent her evenings talking and baking with Jacob, helping with the creatures in the basement menagerie, and reading on the couch in front of the roaring fire. </p>
<p>Tina treasured the memories of those nights. She always knew that Newt would make his way up the stairs around 9:30, when Jacob went to bed, and join her in front of the fire. She always had a mug of hot cocoa waiting for him. It became a nightly tradition that they both relished, sitting on opposite ends of the couch, drinking hot cocoa, and talking about their lives. She loved to hear stories of his travels and she would talk about her childhood and her time in school. It was so much better than their months of letters, and she found herself falling for him completely. As the months passed, they found themselves slowly moving closer together on the couch, longing to be near each other.</p>
<p>In the months after Paris, both Newt and Tina were mourning their losses. While their feelings for each other remained, they both knew that it was not the right time to navigate a budding relationship. There had been too much miscommunication between them and both of their lives had shifted abruptly. For Tina especially, her equilibrium had shattered and, with the added stress of her liaison job, she was teetering on the edge of a breakdown. The months with Newt and Jacob helped her heal bit by bit until she felt herself feeling moments of happiness. She began to feel like herself again, and while her sister was still gone and she felt like part of her soul was missing, life moved on and time passed. Tina learned to laugh again.</p>
<p>Tina began to feel like she had found her new home, and it was in the most unlikely of places-- a tiny flat in the heart of London with the two greatest men she had ever had the pleasure of knowing. She knew that life would go on and that it could be good. Then, in the middle of December as a front of biting cold settled over the city, Tina received the letter she had been dreading since she had arrived, broken and terrified, in September. Her time was up and she was being called back to New York.</p>
<p>With a hug and a tearful goodbye, she left Jacob behind in London. MACUSA did not know he was in Europe and he intended to keep it that way. She would never say a word. They all knew that if he went back to New York, there was a good chance he would be obliviated. It was not worth the risk. He passed her a packet of papers as she left Newt’s small flat, the deed to his bakery and other paperwork she would pass on to a lawyer. He would sell his bakery, his life’s work, and leave New York behind.</p>
<p>Newt accompanied Tina to the portkey office at the Ministry of Magic. The corridors leading to the office were quiet and deserted. As they neared the large wooden door, he suddenly reached out to grab her hand as if in a panic, pulling her to a halt. Tina turned to face him and saw tears forming in his eyes as he looked up at her through the hair that had fallen over his forehead. She felt longing, regret, and pain as she looked into his crystal eyes, and she wondered if he was feeling the same. She loved him. She knew that she loved him, but they had let their awkwardness and insecurities get in the way once again and had done nothing about it. Now, they wouldn't get a chance because she was going to be a world away from him with no set plan for a reunion. How long would they be apart? Months? Years? She felt herself begin to panic at the thought. How could she have been so wrong? Why had they waited? Why had they done nothing? She wanted him and knew he wanted her. Regret filled her and her heart felt like it was breaking in her chest.</p>
<p>Newt rubbed his thumb over the back of her hand, pulling her from her thoughts. He addressed her in a rasping voice, full of emotion. “I don’t want you to go.”</p>
<p>At this confession, Tina pulled on their clasped hands and they met in a hug. It wasn’t a new gesture, they had done this before, but the desperation and pain added a level of intensity and intimacy to their connection. She wrapped her arms around his waist and buried her face into the lapel of his jacket. “I don’t want to go. I want to stay here-- with you.”</p>
<p>Newt’s arms tightened around her and his cheek rested against the hair on the top of her head. Tina felt him inhale slowly and release, almost as if he was memorizing her scent. “Will you write to me?” he asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she replied as she ran one hand up and down his back, “as often as I can. And I will be back as soon as they let me.”</p>
<p>“Good.” Newt leaned back to look at her face. Tear tracks were running down his face, and Tina knew that her face probably mirrored his own. “I’ll—I’ll miss you. So much, Tina.”</p>
<p>“I’ll miss you too.” Tina’s voice broke as she felt another tear run down her cheek. She raised one hand and gently pushed the hair off of Newt’s forehead. The action was reminiscent of their last goodbye, but as his eyes closed at her touch, she realized that time and familiarity had made this similar action far more intimate. </p>
<p>She looked at Newt for several beats, then bent down to pick up her small suitcase in one hand. She reached out to Newt with her other hand, lightly squeezing his own in a gesture of comfort. She inhaled deeply, then released her breath as she tried to gain the determination to walk away. It was excruciating. </p>
<p>“I’ll see you soon,” she whispered before backing away until their hands were forced to release each other. She turned and walked through the door to the portkey office. Once she shut the door behind her, Tina leaned against the wooden panel as she struggled to regain control of her emotions. Minutes later she was spinning away from the Ministry, away from London, away from Newt.</p>
