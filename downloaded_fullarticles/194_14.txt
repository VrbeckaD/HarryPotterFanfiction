          <div class="userstuff"><p>This wasn't something that Remus Lupin wasn't familiar with. He really wished it was. He wished he was a stranger to the sounds of screaming himself hoarse, voice turning into a garbled mix of boy and animal; his bones popping grossly out of place. But he wasn't. </p><p>It had been happening ever since he was a little boy. Ever since he was five-years-old. And in all that time, no one else had been there during the transformation...no one had wanted to be, of course, even thought about it. </p><p>Until now. </p><p>"Sirius," he was saying desperately. "Please. You have to get out of here--" His voice cracked slightly. "I-I don't want you to see me like this..."</p><p>"Don't push me away, Moons, please!" The other boy said in response. "You're not a monster!"</p><p>Wait. What?</p><p>"No, it's not that--"</p><p>"Then what?"</p><p>He was going to admit it, wasn't he? </p><p>"...it's just...I’m just really dumb as a wolf and I don’t want you to see me bark at a mirror for two hours..." he didn't meet his eyes, a rosy blush dusting his cheeks, but it was better than what Sirius had been thinking before, probably.</p></div>
