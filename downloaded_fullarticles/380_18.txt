    <p>He smelled like sandalwood and cigarettes.</p><p>It lingered on his sheets that morning, leaving him sighing deeply into his pillow, breathing in the scent of him as if he could will him back into his bed by pure force of imagination. But instead of lying warm in his arms, where he belonged, Remus was sleeping off the full moon in the hospital wing, under the watchful eye of Madam Pomfrey. No chance, then, to sneak into his bed instead, to hold him and remind him once more what it felt like to be human. To thread his fingers through those sandy curls and--</p><p>He bit off a groan, savoring the memory of how Remus’ lips had felt when he had first captured them with his own. Feeling, more than hearing, the surprised little gasp he had let slip. A heartbeat had passed between them before Remus, to his joy, responded in kind with bruising force, his teeth lightly grazing his bottom lip as he all but devoured him.</p><p>He smelled like sandalwood and cigarettes, but he tasted like red wine and dark chocolate, all black fruited sweetness and heady spice. Sirius couldn’t help but to drink deep of him then, swirling him around his tongue, savoring every note. He had felt soft, warm hands cup his face, thumbs stroking his cheekbones as though he were something precious, treasured even. His left hand came up to trace along the path those fine-boned fingers had travelled, trailing down his jaw to the hollow of his throat. He grinned wickedly at the memory of nearly showing up late for the Shack, James shaking his head about the love bites all over his throat.</p><p>“Ask me no questions and I shall tell thee no lies,” he had quipped with a roguish wink, while internally reveling in the fact Remus had been so passionate, so bold as to mark him, each bruise a banner shouting a single word:</p><p>MINE.</p><p>His left hand ghosted across his pulse point, where Remus had just a few hours prior been focusing his attentions, gently nipping and sucking. He had moaned then, and Remus had suddenly pulled away, looking him in the eyes. The air between the two was heavy; he could feel the tension built between them like a guitar string wound too tight. He remembered the way Remus looked in that moment: the way the early sunset shone through the windows, painting him in amber hues. His normally tidy hair mussed and falling into his gold-green eyes, widened and dark with desire, lips rosy and kiss-swollen. Sirius remembered staring back, wanting to burn the image into his memory before the tension between them inevitably snapped. He had half expected Remus to push him away then, but as always his friend surprised him. He had pushed Sirius suddenly and firmly down onto the bed and straddled him, that intense, darkened gaze never leaving his own; his expression seeking permission and finding it.</p><p>Sirius’ right hand trailed down as he remembered feeling Remus hard against his hip, discovering he was just as hard as he had been then. He freed himself, grasping and pulling at his cock like a lifeline, imagining the way Remus had run his palm down his length, feeling him through his trousers. He unbuttoned Sirius’ shirt, lowering himself over him to continue his ministrations, his kisses trailing farther and farther down. Sirius slid his left hand down to his chest, pinching and rolling his nipple between his fingers the way Remus had between his teeth. His right hand slid up and down his shaft, fingers dancing across the swollen head as he switched his grip back and forth. He stroked himself the way he had stroked Remus then, reaching through his trousers, feeling the way his breath hitched, the way his back arched and rolled his hips as he thrust into his hand, the soft mewling sound he made when--</p><p>The dam burst, and he saw stars.</p><p>His back arched off the bed, his toes curling, his release spilling onto his hands in hot spurts. It took every bit of self control he possessed to remain silent instead of howling his pleasure to the heavens. He had, after all, neglected to put up silencing charms. As he cleaned himself off, he couldn’t help but think back to the way that Remus had somehow managed the Herculean task of stopping Sirius from finishing him off.</p><p>“We’re out of time… I have to go now, or I’ll be late.”</p><p>And Sirius, good friend that he was, withdrew his hand from Remus’ trousers, taking no small amount of pride from the way the other boy whimpered at the loss of contact. He had kissed him deeply, humming as he did so.</p><p>“We can always finish this later.”</p><p>“I do so hate to leave things undone when they very much need doing.” He had pulled back to look at Remus’ perfectly innocent expression.</p><p>“Is that so, Mr. Moony? Are you implying that I need… doing?” And suddenly, the corner of his mouth had quirked up, and twisted into what Sirius could only describe as a cocksure grin. He wasn’t sure if it was out of place on him, or drop dead sexy.</p><p>“Why yes, Mr. Padfoot, I do believe I am.”</p><p>Definitely, definitely sexy. He flopped down onto the bed with a dramatic groan. What had happened to shy little Remus Lupin who couldn’t even make eye contact with anyone?</p><p>“Fuck <em>me</em>, Remus, you just had to say that right as you’re leaving for the night, didn’t you? I quite literally cannot get any more erect.”</p><p>Remus backed towards the door, his grin widening.</p><p>“Think of it this way, the anticipation will make it that much better, yeah?” He turned to leave, his hand on the door, when suddenly he paused. “Oh, and Sirius?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“You’ve got a little something, just here.” He tapped his throat with a wink, and left.</p><p>Sirius smiled at the memory, nuzzling back into the pillow that still smelled of sandalwood and cigarettes, and thinking that if he needed to be as utterly gone to pieces for anyone the way James was for Evans, then he was glad it was Remus.</p>
