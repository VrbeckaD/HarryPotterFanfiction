    <p>“War sure is hell,” Draco was standing over Hermione, clutching her wand.</p><p>She was slowly regaining consciousness, and the first thing she saw when her eyes opened was Draco Malfoy handing her wand to her.</p><p>She had to wipe some of the blood from her vision before she could believe her eyes. “Thank… you…”</p><p>She leaned up slightly, reaching for the wand. He refused to let go.</p><p>Their eyes met when the wind blew open a shutter from a nearby window.</p><p>“I need a favor,” his solemn expression was serious.</p><p>“Okay…” She rose to sit up, attempting to rise to meet his height without frightening him.</p><p>He stepped slightly closer, “Stop fighting.” He wasn’t asking. He was commanding.</p><p>“I don’t follow.” Her voice was hushed, as she could hear others fighting nearby in the abandoned house that was once a safe-house for Deatheaters.</p><p>“I don’t want to run into you like this again,” he elaborated with finality.</p><p>Relinquishing the hold on her wand, he turned from her.</p><p>With her wand returned, she wringed her hands around it, looking it over. “Why is it always you? Always you who I wake up to, when the battle’s raging and I’m sure I’ve died?”</p><p>Confusion flooding her voice, she waited for a reply.</p><p>But upon looking up, she only saw his footprints ghosting in the ash and soot of wizarding war.</p><p>She remembered the taste of clove and seaweed.</p><p>“-Kedavra!” were the final words she recalled, careening into her at the hands of Bellatrix Lestrange.</p><p>She remembered the heat that followed, and the sensation of ice pricking the hairs on her shins. The speed at which she fell was breathtaking, and there was no telling when she might land.</p><p>All at once, her breathing was calm. All in an instant, there were feathers encasing her mind. All together, they were uplifting the weights in the pockets of her soul.</p><p>The bed of leaves she landed upon held her. The universe reverberated between her fingers and toes while a bird sang a song from her childhood.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, the vividness of her elation set in as deep as bone. She was crying out joyously.</p><p>Ethereal wisps were raising her to walk, and hover, and float toward the hereafter.</p><p>The real feeling began calling to her; the pull of reality. Her entire form was engulfed in light. However, a strength unknown to her was rending her from the sweet caress of death.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, Draco Malfoy stood above her, welcoming her back to the mortal coil once again—as was their tradition.</p><p>His expression, usually smug, fell upon seeing her rise.</p><p>She was ensconced in a pile of mud and rubble. She was bound to the bitterness of a reality that refused to let her die.</p><p>He’d ‘saved’ her on many occasions. It had been nearly a year since the first of such encounters.</p><p>Every time, there was a breathlessness to her. She even thanked him a few times.</p><p>The prospect of losing her frightened him in a way that he refused to face.</p><p> </p><p>Tonight, with the rain beating down relentlessly through the destruction of battle, she lay there unspeaking.</p><p>The hollowness of her expression frightened him more.</p>
