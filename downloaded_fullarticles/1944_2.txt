</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">– <b>A high society ball in the late summer of 1993 –</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cedric blew out a breath and Theresa laughed upon his dazed look at the ice sculptures surrounding the buffet, she tugged on his hand and gently pulled him over to the sitting corner where Marcus Flint stopped glaring at his surroundings when they approached, sitting on a settee next to his, Samentha picked at the skirt of her dress. Theresa was amazed she had come in one in the first place, would have half expected her to turn up in a suit or formal robes just for the sake of it but the rebellious streak wasn't that dominant yet. Or she had simply found a dress that she liked because the red looked really great on her and when Samentha caught her eyes Theresa could see that the other girl was <em>very</em> much aware of that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Finally the age average gets lowered," Samentha greeted them with a bright smirk and Marcus seemed to breathe out a relieved sigh as well, "Looking good there." Theresa grinned, glad over the hand that Cedric raised for her so she could twirl around once, letting the deep pink gown flare out dramatically, she had begged her father for this dress for weeks and then spent every free minute of the last three days letting her fingers glide over the embroidered flowers.</p>
<p>"Is Julie here already?" She wanted to know when they got comfortable then, houseelves bringing over drinks, Samentha pointed over to where the house owners were entertaining and greeting their guests. Abraxas Malfoy was in the process of shaking the hand of Mister Greengrass, his wife tutting over Julienna's royal blue dress while Adrienna looked like she was using all of her energy to hold back on the eyeroll. Theresa had no trouble in following Julienna's mother's eyes across the room where Marculus Selwyn was laughing into his wine over her suffering, apparently only Laureen had been spared the night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Behind the hosts Lucius Malfoy was watching the crowd, Narcissa Malfoy fussing over her son's hair, Theresa earnestly hoped that Draco wouldn't think about approaching them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She smiled when Eustace appeared at Adrienna's side and some no doubt polite charming words had Julienna on his arm within seconds and him leading them away from the grown ups. Julienna sank down on Marcus' left with a huff while Eustace took an armchair for himself, "How many hours has it been?" Julienna wanted to know, despite the fact that she loved the dressing up part, she hated the whole show around it, the fakeness of it all.</p>
<p>"It's been five minutes," Samentha deadpanned and grabbed a few grapes off the tray, "I can't wait for the music to start, at least then no one will want to bloody talk." Theresa agreed, she was disgusted by the fakeness of it all as well, no matter how much she liked the formal events, the dances, the banquets, but maybe Sullivan's grinning face had caused a bit of envy in her, too, when he had waved them goodbye, too young to be taken along yet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everything had become a bit stiffling, like there were ghosts among them, and the taste of a storm on the horizon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A pureblood event and no sign of Regulus Black anywhere, there couldn't have been a better sign than that in proving to her that these people were meeting to talk about things that weren't so going with the law. She only needed to throw a subtle glance over to Thomas and his smug smile watching the room from his chair as if it was a throne, so full of himself and convinced that he was invincible.</p>
<p>"At least the food is great," Marcus rumbled out and then froze with his eyes going wide, "Damn." They all turned around or looked up, depending on how they were sitting, to turn their eyes towards the staircase that led down to the Malfoy's ballroom. "He's got balls to turn up here." Theresa could feel how her blood turned cold at the sight of the young man stepping down the stairs in robes that couldn't have looked finer, pale green eyes in a sharp face taking in the room while the room took him in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stevan Rosier hadn't been attending gatherings for a year now, and even his sister had no idea why, and now he had returned while the rumors around him were growing. Stevan moved like a predator, knowing there was nothing that could harm him, he was the direct heir to one of the oldest pureblood families, his path brought him straight towards Thomas who greeted him with a quiet sideways glance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both of them were people who were noticed without having to do anything at all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A gasp from Julienna on her right had Theresa turn her attention back towards the stairs where Silvan Rosier, his wife and daughter-in-law had just reached the end of it, they couldn't have been the reason for Julienna's brain going blank though so Theresa raised her gaze slightly and then blinked. "Wow," Samentha admitted verbally what she had been thinking, "Who got her into <em>that</em> dress?" She wanted to know and Theresa wondered the same exact thing. Up on the stairs, looking quite a bit like she wanted to die right there and then, Sarena was shimmering in a silver-green dress, her hair pinned back, no strands to hide behind for once. "Marcus, you better go and fetch her before anyone can get ideas."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"On my way."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"The fucking hell?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There had been more eloquent and graceful greetings for the equivalent of a higborn pureblood witch like Sarena Rosier whose effing cradle had been made from silver and whose swaddling clothes had been fashioned from egyptian cotton. As it was Theresa stiffled a laugh when Sarena raised a sharp blond eyebrow in Samentha's direction, sitting down with more elegance than she usually showed at school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slytherin Sarena in Hogwarts was a completely different person than Sarena Rosier out in pureblood circles with her brother's eyes pinning a target on her back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Good evening to you, too, Sammy," Sarena bit back in bleeding sarcasm, "And yes, the fucking hell indeed, he turned up out of the blue yesterday morning. Mother is happy of course, Grandfather seems only a step away from getting out the Veritaserum." She slouched for a moment and then caught herself again, throwing a look over to Julienna on another couch, eyes a little desperate and longing, Julienna gave her a smile. "I could have happily done without him, I was happy he was gone."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Where did you get that dress from?" Theresa chose to unsubtly shift the conversation into lighter territory and though Marcus and Eustace mentally shut off, Sarena beamed.</p>
<p>"Isn't it a beautiful?" She wanted to know and softly stroked through the delicate material of the green dress skirt, "I went with Grandfather to Madrid last weekend, and it was him who saw it in a windowfront, said I'd look so beautiful in it. I couldn't say no."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sarena didn't like it when people called her spoiled so Theresa and Samentha had long since chosen 'treated well' as code for it. Silvan Rosier was a great man though, and when the four of them had spent a weekend at Sarena's in the summer break after second year with Steven graduated and pissed off to Merlin knows where, Silvan had taken them all to Paris and they had all gotten necklaces and Theresa would never complain about that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"It's stunning," Julienna gushed over the dress and if her eyes were any indication she was close to drooling, Theresa snorted and then grinned when Samentha rolled her eyes, "I've never seen you wear something like this." Something this attention seeking, that was usually Julienna's and Samentha's part, even Theresa's if she was in a good enough mood, Sarena was the one moving in the shadows and keeping her eyes on everything. Here and now she shifted, bit her lips for a moment before throwing a quick look over to where her grandfather was still greeting Abraxas Malfoy, "He's been quite hit by Sirius Black's outbreak. It's...brought a lot of memories back, from the war. If seeing me in a totally over the top sparkling dress is making him smile a little tonight, then I'll gladly take the creeps staring." Sarena was a spoiled cunning Slytherin princess with a heart three miles wide and beating only for a girl she couldn't have.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Theresa smiled at her and asked more questions about the dress, at her side Cedric drew Marcus and Eustace into Quidditch talks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Boys.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Where did Thomas come from?" Julienna asked next and Theresa could only shrug, just like Stevan, Thomas had fucked off after graduation, probably even together with his best friend to do whatever. Thomas had returned a week ago and as Eustace had so beautifully put it Theresa didn't "care any bloody bit at all." Sarena gave her a wordless toast with her glass of water to that.</p>
<p>"You two are looking damn good together," Samentha turned the topic once more and Theresa flushed, Cedric twitched next to her but didn't let it turn him away from his conversation with Marcus, "Color coordinated. Very nice, Tess."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And flushed turned into blushed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cedric had only had a grey pocket square and it had been sweet annoying Eustace who had supplied him with a rose one to match her dress.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And around them this masquerade of fake friendship and camaraderie began when the host called for the music to start. The seven of them clinked their glasses together and promised each other to have fun despite it all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cedric was a fabulous dancer and Theresa found herself smiling like an idiot up at him while he moved them so effortlessly over the dancefloor, her girls were all giggling. Eustace with Julienna, looking graceful because their skills had been honed to perfection and because they were graceful people. Marcus with Sarena, who somehow managed to make it look like he was leading though it clearly was her, it was so nice what they were doing for each other. Samentha who had pulled one of the Malfoy cousins from France to a dance, rolling her eyes when Theresa caught hers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She laughed when the music picked up and Cedric swung her around, faster and faster, picking her up as if she weighed nothing and it was so beautiful and wonderful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"If I had known you were such a fantastic dancer, I would have asked you to these ages ago," she teased when a slow song came up and she could wrap her arms around Cedric's neck, his arms coming around her waist, "You really have a talent."</p>
<p>"That's only because my amazing dance partner has such great skills," he told her with a sweet smile, a little mischief in his eyes and Theresa wanted nothing more than to stretch up and kiss him, but it wouldn't be proper.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hush, you're gonna make me blush," she ducked her head down to hide exactly that from him, he was so adorable and handsome, and he wanted her, only her. She still couldn't believe it to be true sometimes, that he had walked up to her on the grounds, despite the intimidating presence of her girls and the twins, and had asked her out for the next Hogsmeade weekend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And oh, that first date had been so wonderful and magical.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I like it when you blush, you look cute like that," Cedric chuckled and Theresa kicked his left foot lightly as the song came to an end and the band announced a small break, "Come on, let's get something to drink. You can cool off your cheeks on the glass." She hooked herself under his arm and laughed, he was the sweetest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Theresa wasn't making it a habit to eavesdrop on people, she didn't really like it and only really found it acceptable when it meant spying on her brothers. In Thomas' case to look out for dangers and in Eustace's case to fish for crushes, considering that Sullivan couldn't keep secrets eavesdropping on him was boring still. At school it wasn't necessary for her to spy on people, between Samentha's connection to Fred and George who knew all, Julienna's ability to guilttrip Professor Black and Sarena's unnatural paranoia, the four of them were usually always informed about everything.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And even on this night, Tess hadn't been planning on overhearing something, she had just gone to the loo and had then wanted to quickly return to Cedric's side – despite having full trust in her girls and Eustace being able to keep Thomas away from Cedric – but then she had stumbled upon Adrienna Greengrass furiously whispering with Marculus Selwyn in an alcove in the corridor that connected the loo with the ballroom.</p>
<p>"We have to tell him, Marc, he will want to know," Julienna's mother was insisting as Theresa pushed herself against a pillar and drapes, the host's questionable taste in home decor meant that she could nearly blend in with the walls and drapes anyway. "And we wouldn't want to hear this from Silvan." Marculus Selwyn shook his head, Theresa didn't know him well but Julienna did, he had been a school friend of Adrienna's, Sarena's uncle's and Regulus Black's, his father was an important advisor of the minister and the son was raising his own influence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"We're not telling Reg, Adri, not when it's nothing more than suspicion. You weren't there when we found out about Sirius," he hissed down at her and Theresa winced, Sirius Black had broken out of Azkaban a week ago and already the whole country was being combed for him. This evening had been thrown into question before Abraxas Malfoy had put his foot down and gone through with the planning, society events were more important to these people than questions of safety, and why would Black attack his former allies anyway.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She didn't want to imagine though what her poor Professor had to feel, it must have been quite a blow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"He isn't okay, Adrienna, he's really not okay. And that damn Head Auror is convinced of his involvment still, Reg went to Brighton for a very good reason. He needs peace right now, and he will get it." Marculus was a little harsh in his tone but his body language was relaxed, not threatening at all, Theresa felt so uncomfortable but there was no way she could slink past them and going to hide out in the loo was just plain ridiculous. And humiliating, she didn't want Cedric to think she'd gotten a bad stomach.</p>
<p>"He'll get angry if he hears we had suspicions." Adrienna held against her friend in arguments and she always looked so much like her daughter like this, both of them could argue you into your grave by defeat. "We swore to him to not keep things from him just because he isn't doing so well again." Marculus sighed and Theresa wondered what that sentence had to mean.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Was something wrong with Regulus Black?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Reg had suspicions from the day we both welcomed him back into our lives, none of this will surprise him. He won't like it but it won't surprise him, so waiting another few weeks isn't going to change anything," Marculus reasoned and then scoffed, "Why are you looking at me like that?"</p>
<p>"Don't know," Adrienna said with a chuckle and boxed Marculus' right arm, "Just suddenly feeling a lot less nervous somehow. We can stop this, can't we?"</p>
<p>"We <em>will</em> stop this." Marculus gave in what sounded very much like a promise, he even leaned down to kiss Adrienna's cheek and then tugged her arm around his again, turning them to walk back to the ballroom, "And I'll talk to Reg when he's back from Brighton and if he is feeling better."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Back in the ballroom, Theresa rejoined her friends who had pulled themselves back into a corner again to sit, drink and eat while others occupied the dancefloor for the moment, older couples to the currently older music choices. As she approached the laughing and chatting group, she thought over telling them what she had just overheard, her girls would be interested, and so would Marcus no doubt, even Cedric and Eustace would want to know if something was up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Julienna and Sarena especially would want to know about worries concerning Professor Black, they were both close to him offside of school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, her mind reminded her then as she took a seat between Cedric and Eustace, maybe it was nothing and she would worry her friends for unnecessary reasons. Tension was high enough in their world already anyway, with Sirius Black being the boogeyman of dark corners and Stevan Rosier's sudden return from disappearance. It wasn't worth it, she decided and let her ears snap to the topic being discussed, namely the Quidditch league and judging by Sarena's face it had been going on a while already. Theresa gave her a wink and Sarena rolled her eyes, fond annoyance while left and right of her Julie and Marcus were stuck in a heated argument over the Harpies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over Sarena's shoulder Theresa caught sight of Adrienna Greengrass smiling that fake polite smile while Narcissa Malfoy tutted over the dress of Sarena's mother. She always looked so out of place with these high society women whose prior concerns were charities, fancy dresses and hairstyles. Marculus Selwyn had drawn Silvan Rosier into a corner, heads bent together to talk in privacy. Cedric slipping his hand into hers drew her gaze up to him and they smiled at each other, she was so happy to see him so relaxed, it meant so much to her that he was here with her, with her family.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Crap," Eustace's curse and him quickly setting down his wine glass had them all look over to him, "Marcus, get Sarena and yourself dancing." Marcus frowned but a look sent to where Eustace was glowering was enough to have Sarena and him on their feet already. Tess was still in the process of blinking in confusion when a shadow fell over her and she felt her gut rolling upon the foul-sweet voice speaking up.</p>
<p>"You should not seclude yourselves on such a night. This is no hang out," Stevan Rosier began and Tess didn't kid herself over Cedric's hold on her hand tightening, "This is a night to make contacts, to built connections and baselines for your futures." He moved a little to the side so he was standing closer to Julienna and right in his sister's path, but Tess didn't relax one bit because the presence at her back remained and it was her own oldest brother whose eyes she could feel on the back of her head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"We'll be going dancing then," Sarena announced and sent a look to her brother that wasn't a glare but it wasn't non-defying either, a move she could only get away with because her grandfather was still master of the family and he loved no one in this world more than her. Stevan inclined his head to her and Marcus with a sharp smirk and Marcus tugged Sarena away quickly. Eustace was looking intently at something behind Stevan but Theresa couldn't see what it was.</p>
<p>"Come on, let's join Flint and Sarena," Cedric proposed and Theresa was only too happy to leave, even if that left Julienna and Samentha behind. Neither Stevan nor Thomas would want to dance with Samentha, her blood was good enough to socialize with in this masquerade of alliances but they didn't dance with Gryffindors. Julienna was the one in their focus but when Theresa locked eyes with her, Julienna smiled at her, not worried at all so Theresa let Cedric lead her past Thomas who watched them with his creepy cold eyes, clearly judging everything.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"God, I hate them," Cedric hissed when they were surrounded by music and dancing people, Sarena and Marcus only three feet from them, slow-dancing as well. "You always should try to keep narrowminded prejudices from coloring your worldview but they certainly are pretentious bastardy slimy Slytherins still. No offense," he hadded in the end with a side glance to Marcus and Sarena who both rolled their eyes. Over in their corner, Eustace was now locked in a staredown with Stevan, a hand already curled around Samentha's to take her dancing or around the room, just away from those two. Theresa had heard from Eustace earlier this day that Thomas supposedly had his eyes on a girl from one of their distant relatives in Germany, so it wasn't him after Julienna's hand for a dance. It was fucking Stevan Rosier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dick move.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The whole pureblood society knew that Stevan's and Sarena's uncle had once loved Julienna's mother and rumor had it that Adrienna had only not chosen him because of bad blood in their Sixth Year. Theresa had no idea what was true in there and what was not, Adrienna didn't talk about her schooltime to her daughters and Sarena's uncle was long dead and not talked about, she just didn't want Julienna anywhere near that disgusting prick. And then Marculus Selwyn swooped in like a knight in shining armor, even if his dark grey dress robes weren't shiny at all, stepping past Stevan as if he was air, he greeted Eustace and Samentha and then held out a hand for Julienna who gladly took it with a bright grin. The look that Stevan and Thomas sent after them couldn't have been more murderous, and still Theresa turned her face into Cedric's chest and laughed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sometimes rebellions started small.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the music picked up again with the next song, Cedric swung her into a quicker dance and surrounded by her laughing and giggling friends, Theresa could forget that incident again, too happy to let herself be twirled around and then caught again by her boyfriend's strong arms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You know," Cedric began when it was just the two of them stopped at the back of the gardens, far away from those creepy white peacocks, his thumb was still stroking over the back of her hand where their hands were clasped between them, "I always knew your world was...intense but this is crazy." And he swept a hand out over the wide gardens that looked like a castle's backyard, and then the same hand towards the manor they had left behind.</p>
<p>"That's just because it's the Malfoys, they always go beyond everything, especially in taste. You know how my home looks like, and Julienna and Samentha don't live any different. And even Rosier Manor doesn't look this tacky and pretentious, even the Sacred Twenty Eight can have <em>homes</em>, Ced." Theresa reasoned with him and tugged him forward towards the neck high roses planted along a winding path. "Professor Black doesn't even have a manor, he has a townhouse, and the Blacks are the oldest pureblood family."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I'm not saying it scares me," Cedric insisted and stopped them when he correctly sensed that she wanted to smell a pink rose, "It sure is a lot but...you're definitely worth it to get used to society balls and charity dinners." She whirled around to face him, heart pumping in her chest and a grin on her lips, "Did you expect me to start running? I'm not a coward."</p>
<p>"I didn't expect you to run," she protested and stepped into the arms he spread out for her, feeling so warm and fuzzy now, "I know you're not a coward but I also know that this world is crazy and dangerous as well. What you saw tonight, with Stevan's return onto the stage, it doesn't promise anything good."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cedric pulled her against his chest and she leaned against him, smiled over the strong arms coming around her, his chin coming to rest upon her head, "I'm not scared of your brother or Stevan Rosier, nor do I fear the obvious Death Eater histories flickering around these people. I'm here because of you, Tess, because I wanna be with you." He pushed her away a little so he could look down at her, catching her eyes and smiling so happily, "I want to be a part of your world because I love you."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was like butterflys and sunshine filling every single one of her veins, a smile breaking out over her face and her eyes watering with happy tears of pure joy. She had certainly never heard anything more beautiful or wonderful.</p>
<p>"I love you, too," she whispered back at him and Cedric pulled her close again for a kiss, Tess wrapped her arms around his neck, "It means so much to me that you don't let this intimidate you." He chuckled against the side of her face, hands rubbing over her back, Eustace had been so sweet as to add some warming charms to their clothes before they had gone out because the night had already turned quite chilly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Oh, I am intimidated." He disagreed and still grabbed her hand again to get them walking once more, "All these politics, all these grudges, all this tension. Traditions and history. It's terrifying," he said but he was laughing so Theresa knew he meant it only halfway, "but I'm not going into it alone, nor am I blind. I've got Eustace, I got Flint as hard to believe as that might still be, I've got your girls and most importantly I got you." They smiled at each other again, so happy. "We've got this, Tess, together."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Together."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"TESS!" Eustace's voice came from further towards the manor, "Dad wants home," came the saving call of the night and Tess laughed when Cedric breathed out deeply in relief, she very much felt the same thing though. Sarena had left an hour before they had escaped to the garden already, back home with her mother and grandparents while Stevan had remained behind, secluded into a corner with Thomas and some others former school friends, Julienna had gone with Sarena and her mother had left with Marculus Selwyn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Samentha had been freed by her parents just minutes before Theresa had finally managed to convince her mother to let Cedric and her take a walk and Marcus had offered Samentha to apparate her home, him probably off to Wood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Let's get out of here," Theresa told Cedric and they walked back up the path again, "Start making up some fantastical stories about this night, Eustace and I, we always make up some stupid stuff for Sullivan to gape at." She explained and he laughed when Eustace already came into view, holding their cloaks, "Is Thomas coming home with us?"</p>
<p>"No," Eustace had even more good news, "Don't know where he is going, and I care even less," he made clear, handing them their cloaks, "All I want is to go home now, take this bloody bow tie off and then make sure Cedric remembers where to sleep tonight."</p>
<p>"Eustace!" Theresa hissed at her brother while Cedric rolled his eyes, Eustace smirked and then slung an arm around her shoulders, holding the other hand out for Cedric to take.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Malfoy Manor vanished with a pop and her home front door appeared within another pop in her ears, despite the late hour Sullivan was sitting on the bench in the foyer, eagerly expecting them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I'll give you fifteen more minutes of privacy," Eustace showed just then why he was the more awesome big brother, pushing open the front door and stepping inside with Sullivan already flying towards him, "After that I'm expecting you both in my room, or at least Cedric." Theresa thanked him with a hug and then pulled Cedric up to the cozy sitting room between her room and Eustace's.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It had been a great evening.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"The swans went flying when the champagner was poured," Cedric's voice was captivating and Sullivan was hanging onto every single word from him, showing once more why Cedric had been made prefect, he knew how to read people, how to comfort them, how to take their minds off of things. And apparently also how to tell complete bullshit tales to make a boy of eleven smile. Theresa bit her lips hard and saw how Eustace hid his own amused smile behind a cup of hot cocoa, they were sitting together on her brother's bed in his room, Sullivan crosslegged in a pillow nest on the ground while Cedric had claimed the rocking chair that Eustace only used on christmas to read in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Did they melt?" Sullivan whispered and his eyes flickered to his siblings who schooled their faces into shared enthusiam for Cedric's story. The ice sculptures had been truly overkill but at least they had in fact not been charmed to start flying randomly, that would have been terrifying but Sarena had mentioned that Narcissa Malfoy had used that charm on a charity tea a few weeks back and Cedric must have jumped on that now.</p>
<p>"They never flew close enough to the torches or the chandeliers but they swooped low over the dancefloor whenever someone was dancing. Sarena's hair got brushed by a wing." Cedric continued his tale and Eustace masked laughter with a cough.</p>
<p>"So you told him about Sully's crush?" He whispered over to Theresa who nodded with a grin, "Nice touch to detail, I like him even more now." He assured her and she beamed up at him, it was gonna be weird to not have him at Hogwarts this upcoming September, her big brother, the only one who counted for her, graduated and off into the real world but it warmed her heart so deeply that he approved of Cedric.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She set her own now empty cup to the side and then curled up against her brother's side, letting him wrap an arm around her, watching Cedric grin and glow while telling his story to a happily gaping Sullivan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was no masquerade here, just family and loved ones, and it was perfect.</p>
