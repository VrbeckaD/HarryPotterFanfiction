    <p>“I love you Ron.” Harry said as I lead him out of the pub.</p>
<p>“I love you too, mate,” I replied, grunting as I shifted the weight of a very drunk Harry.</p>
<p>“I know you do Ronnie. I wish I loved you the way you want me to. My life would be so much easier if I did.” Harry continued.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” I replied, pulling Harry closed to me before his ran into a street bin. I was tempted to use magic to levitate his drunk-ass home, but we were in a Muggle neighborhood, so magic was out. I was able to carry Harry on my back half way home, but saw the flaw in that plan when he drooled down my neck.</p>
<p>The second half of the journey home had Harry cradled in my arms; his head nestled against my shoulder. The brunette made a contented noise in the back of his throat as he settled in his new position.</p>
<p>I had no qualms using magic to enter our shared flat. With a turning gesture, the door unlocked and I walked in. Shifting a dozing Harry so we’d fit through the door I carefully maneuvered around the flat toward his bedroom. With another wand-less command aimed at his door, I laid him on his bed and took off his shoes, setting them on their usual place at the side of his night stand. “Goodnight Harry,” I said, leaning down to kiss the thin lightening bolt scar on the middle of his forehead. Harry turned his head up at the movement and our lips meet.</p>
<p>I immediately pulled away and stared into the unfocused green eyes my best mate. “Harry…”</p>
<p>“You taste funny,” Harry giggled before he closed his eyes and passed out.</p>
<p>With a sigh, I reached down to remove his glasses. Gently, I folded them and placed them on the night stand before leaving the room.</p>
<p>“Harry,” I breathed, closing his door and headed back out into the darkened hallway. Sliding to swat against the wall, I reached into my jacket pocket, I pulled out a box of cigarettes and a lighter. I leaned my head against the wall while I smoked in front of Harry’s door. Stress always made me smoke, and tonight I was more stressed than usual. I thought of the boy slumbering in the room in front of me and took a deep drag of the cigarette. It’s been two weeks since I had last seen Harry fall asleep without it being alcohol induced. We’d gone out pub hopping every night since that evening we spent drinking in our living room. If he kept this up he’ll soon be in St. Mungo’s for alcohol poisoning.</p>
<p>“I’m tried of the fighting.” He confided to me earlier in the evening.</p>
<p>“I’m sure she is too, Harry. You should make up with her.”</p>
<p>“How?” he asked into his bottle.</p>
<p>“Go over to the house tomorrow and talk to her. I am sure that she misses you as much as you miss her.” I tried to ignore the sick feeling in my gut as I coaxed my best mate to make up with my little sister. I don’t like seeing Harry like this, but I can’t say that I wasn’t unhappy about all the free time Harry had to spend with me lately.</p>
<p>“Do you really think that will work?”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “I don’t see why that wouldn’t be a good start.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay. I’ll talk to her tomorrow.”</p>
<p>I finished my cigarette and cleaned up the ashes with a wave of my wand. I stood up and checked on Harry before going into my room. I rubbed my eyes with the heel of my palm and sighed.</p>
<p>Tomorrow was going to be a long day.</p>
