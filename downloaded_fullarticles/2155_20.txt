    <p>A tiny figure, blurry with speed, raced through the open door of the chemistry lab and slammed it behind him. The child looked around with all the wary precision of a rabbit looking for the hawk, and froze, staring.</p><p>The graduate student stared back, at the terrible grey too-big clothes, the huge glasses held together with tape, the lightning-bolt scar peeking out behind messy black hair.</p><p>“Hello,” he said to the boy, mouth dry. “What’s your name?”</p><p>“Harry,” the boy said, adjusting his huge glasses and peering cautiously upwards.</p><p>“What can I do for you, Harry?”</p><p>A sound in the corridor made the boy freeze.</p><p>“Right,” Albus said, jerked into motion. “Come on, hide under my desk and I’ll tell them to shove off, shall I?”</p><p>And with a firm hand on Harry’s arm, he did just that. Harry was hidden, and the rampaging rhinoceroses that were Dudley Dursley and his gang were told to get out of the building, this is a place of work.</p><p>After the lumbering herd had retreated, he ushered Harry gently out again.</p><p>“So, what was that about?”</p><p>Harry stared at him, mute and considering.</p><p>He couldn’t stand seeing the kid unhappy, okay? That was why he did it, in the end.</p><p>“Want to see me turn paper different colors by pouring stuff on it?” he said abruptly, adjusting things on his lab bench. “If you’re good, we’ll melt something.”</p><p>Harry’s grin was brilliant, and motivation enough for him to keep the kid entertained, juggling beakers and vials and making things smoke and ooze, even going so far as to explain his work trying to make better plastics for cars and roads and trains, when Harry seemed genuinely interested. </p><p>Eventually, however, the sun had to set, and twilight drove the boy home to the Dursleys.</p><p>The harried time traveler ran his fingers through his tangled black hair as the door closed behind his father. All that effort to avoid screwing up his personal timeline, joining the muggle world, avoiding all contact with his future family, friends, and enemies, and <em>Harry Potter </em>waltzes into his lab.</p><p>It probably wasn’t enough to mess with the timeline, right? It had just been one afternoon and he’d spent the whole time rambling on about acids and bases, the scientific method, and putting things in solution. Sure, his babbling might have been a little panicked, but the kid was like seven, there was no way he would be able to pick up on suppressed panic.</p><p>Everything, he told himself firmly, was fine. He’d request a transfer to a different campus, this traveling fellow lark was obviously a terrible idea. He’d get back home the slow way, right on schedule.</p><p>Everything was fine.</p>
