          <div class="userstuff"><p class="p1">Once upon a time, in a far away land, there lived a princess.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now, this princess wasn’t your average princess. She didn’t have golden blonde hair or brunette locks; she had ruby red hair, that spun around her and made her look like she was on fire. She didn’t have chocolate eyes or jade eyes; she had azure eyes, like the color of the ocean on a summer’s day.</span> </p>
<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">She was fiery, fierce, and rebellious; but she was also soft, sweet, and affectionate. And while she was intelligent, she could be a bit hard-headed at times.</span>
</p>
<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">This girl was Princess Rose; perhaps you’ve heard of her?</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Now, a few months before our princess was born, in the neighboring lands, a prince was born.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">This prince was also not your average prince. He didn’t have raven hair or luscious bangs; his hair was pale blond, so pale it was almost white, and it was cut short, too short, which made him look more like a military officer than a handsome prince. He didn’t have steely silver eyes or sapphire eyes; he had emerald eyes, deep like a forest and very easy to get lost in.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He was sneaky, cunning, and deceptive; but he was also caring, tender, and maybe just a tad bit courageous.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">This young man was Prince Scorpius; you must have heard the tale of him and Princess Rose many times before.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Princess Rose was the only and eldest daughter of King Ron and Queen Hermione - they’re very famous - so naturally her birth was hugely celebrated. </span> <span class="s1">Queen Hermione invited everyone in the kingdom to see the baby - from merchant to peasant, adult to child, no man was missed at Princess Rose’s ceremony. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the party, the witches and wizards came up to bless the newborn - after all, they were the only ones who had the power to do so. </span> <span class="s1">Every witch blessed her. Rose received good looks, intelligence, kindness, everything - why, she even got some earwax from one witch. (But she was old and quite batty, so the queen let it go.)</span></p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But alas, it was all too good to be true. A day as wonderful as that one must have had something go wrong.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One witch had been forgotten. And normally, a witch was nice and wouldn’t mind too much, but this wasn’t a normal witch. </span> <span class="s1">This was the sorceress Bellatrix, who was dark and solemn and dealt in secrets. And she wasn’t at all happy with being forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">So Bellatrix stormed into the castle moodily, cutting the line of witches and wizards to reach baby Rose.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Forgot someone, Queen?” she lazily drawled, except it wasn’t lazy as much as it was threatening.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The queen visibly paled; witches were one thing, but sorceresses were another, and there was a reason why Bellatrix was a sorceress and not a witch.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, I’m terribly sorry, Sorceress Bellatrix, I didn’t mean to-”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Bellatrix held up a hand and thunder boomed. “Of all the people you could have dared to miss, it was me!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The queen shook her head violently. The king tried to interrupt, but Bellatrix quickly cut him off.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I suppose this was done on purpose. You probably thought I wouldn’t bless the princess well.” </span> <span class="s1">An ugly smirk formed on her face. “Well that’s too bad. I have <em>plenty</em> of curses up my sleeve.”</span></p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">In a billow of robes and a flash of darkness, Bellatrix was up at the cradle, stroking Rose’s cheek. “What a beautiful daughter you have. I feel sorry that she has such <em>horrible</em> parents.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Queen Hermione screamed for her to get away from her daughter. Bellatrix snapped, and the whole room froze.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">She leaned down, and whispered to Rose, deadly as a poisonous snake ready for the kill. “At your sixteenth year, at the tenth hour, you shall prick your pretty little finger on a spindle and <em>die</em>.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Satisfied, she stood up and time turned back to normal. The queen rushed over to her baby and began to cry.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Bellatrix pouted. “Oh, you didn’t really think I was going to kill her, did you? How <em>awful</em>.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a burst of darkness, she disappeared. </span> <em> <span class="s1">“Don’t you dare forget me again. Lesson learnt?” </span> </em> <span class="s1">Her last words echoed ominously in the courtroom that was so festive only moments before.</span></p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">An elderly witch came up and consoled the queen. “Let me see your daughter.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Just as I suspected. That hag placed a curse on her,” the witch said. She then explained the prophecy: how Rose would kill herself with a spindle.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Please,” the queen begged. “Please stop the curse!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The witch looked at her pityingly. “That is beyond my control. However...”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“What?” The queen was hysterical now. “Anything, anything!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I can modify the curse slightly,” she explained. “I can put Rose into a deep slumber, to be awoken by a prince. The only catch is that everyone else will slumber along with her.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The queen thought for a second but nodded; because for all the brains she possessed, her love for her daughter was far greater.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">And thus began the legend.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Now, obviously, the queen and king were not idiots. They banned spindles throughout the kingdom, and burned all of them within the fortnight. </span> <span class="s1">Thus Princess Rose grew up in a sheltered environment, learning how to be a proper lady while still being a bit of a handful. </span></p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">On her sixteenth birthday, she woke up, excited for her sweet sixteen ball in the evening. The rest of the day was spent in preparation - washing her hair, gathering her jewelry, and applying make-up. Lots and lots of make-up.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Done!” Rose exclaimed, looking in the mirror with a satisfied expression. “What do you think?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Her mother smiled sweetly at her. “You look beautiful, honey.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">(She was lying straight out of her teeth. She didn’t have the heart to tell her daughter that she looked like a ghost with a watermelon for lips.)</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Now go, everyone’s waiting.” She ushered her daughter out the room, but Rose turned back around.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I’ll come in a minute, I just remembered something that will make my outfit perfect,” Rose squealed. Her mother tried to stop her, but Rose ran away, stumbling over her billowing skirts.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Rose rolled her eyes, now that her mother was out of sight.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Did she <em>honestly </em>think I was going to wear this crap?” In two quick strokes, Rose cut her skirt, so that it now flared out and exposed one of her legs.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">She grinned. “Much better.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">(Hey. She was a teenage girl. She wanted to impress some guys. How could you blame her?)</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Done with her wardrobe changes, she began to make her way down to the ballroom-</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Until she head an odd creaking sound coming out of the door at the end of the hallway.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Rose was a curious girl, so naturally, hearing a weird sound coming from a room she was positive she had never seen before intrigued her.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Softly, she opened the door. Light spilled into the dark room, illuminating what seemed to be a small storeroom. </span> <span class="s1">Inside, there was an old lady, humming what sounded like a funeral march while spinning a wheel.</span></p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Rose had never seen a spindle before in her life; they were banned, remember? So, being the curious girl she was, she obviously wanted to know what it was.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Curiosity killed the cat; too bad that her cat, Wilbur, was out and about in the garden, because maybe then curiosity could have taken the life of him instead of her.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Excuse me,” she asked, slowly approaching the foreign object. “What is that? What are you doing?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The old lady laughed; but it was in good nature so Rose felt a little more at ease in the eerie room. “It’s a spindle, dear. Haven’t you seen one?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Rose shook her head; the lady smiled. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Come now, I’ll show you. You spin the thread around the hook and-”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Like this?” Rose had always been a bit impulsive, never waiting to listen to what others had to say. Swiftly, she stuck her hand out to touch the wheel, but instead caused the inevitable.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Ah!” Rose jumped back, blowing on her finger, which was now laced with crimson drops. “I poked my finger.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Let me see that-” the lady began but it was no use. Rose crumpled to the floor, her head hitting the stone floor with a sickening thud.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Things were quiet around the castle after that.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Now, you might have expected her prince to come for her maybe ten, or a hundred years later - after all, good things only come with time - but their tale wasn’t the average tale.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Prince Scorpius was actually not the most patient man. A few years later, at the ripe age of twenty, he ran away from his kingdom, trying to escape the marriage arranged for him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">(Funny how he ran from love, only to find it at the end of his journey.)</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius only had the innocent intention of laying low and staying single. However, fate had other plans for him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">When he reached the next kingdom, he heard the story of the next kingdom over, the one that fell into a deep slumber.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Scorpius wasn’t all too impressed - what kind of idiot just falls asleep after poking herself? But, he had a good heart, so he felt some kind of odd need to go an rescue the fool of a princess. </span> <span class="s1">So, after a few days on horseback, he reached the kingdom. </span> <span class="s1">Even though it had only been a few years, thick vines and shrubbery were growing everywhere, blocking the path to the castle. </span></p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius really wanted to give up. This was stupid, and he actually had no reasons. But,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the odd pull prevailed and his feet dragged him up into the castle.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It was dead silent. And Scorpius almost thought everyone was dead too - they were motionless, and he couldn’t hear them breathe.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Now that he was in the musty castle, the pull became stronger. Suddenly, his feet and hands were moving all on their own, and dragging him up the stairs and around the corners as if they knew where he had to go.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They finally stopped at the door to a small broom closet. He pushed open the door, and a cloud of dust hit him in the face. Coughing, he entered the room. </span> <span class="s1">It was dark, but there seemed to be some sort of spotlight on the girl lying on the floor of the room.</span></p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius laughed. She looked so stupid! She was sprawled all over the floor, as if she was trying to hug it, and her skirt was in tatters-</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Ah!” Scorpius jumped back, For a second he thought she was on fire, but on closer inspection, it was actually just her hair.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">On even closer inspection, he noticed her face. She was somewhat pretty, he would admit, but her make-up was atrocious. It was just caked on. She must have been blind not to see what a fashion disaster she was.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Scorpius cringed, averting his eyes. She was disgusting. (And stupid.) </span> <span class="s1">But then that odd pull returned, this time tugging him down even closer to her fake face. </span></p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Now that he was in close proximity with her mouth, he noticed how full her lips were. Sure, they looked like a watermelon, but they were nice lips, that actually looked quite plump and soft and kissable-</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius shook his head. Bad thoughts. No, he was just here to save the princess, not take advantage of some random girl lying on the floor of a closet.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">(But then again, she was dressed quite finely for a normal girl. It must have been for the party; maybe she was a lady-in-waiting.)</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But those lips were looking absolutely delicious now, and-</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, what the hell!” In one swift motion, Scorpius placed his lips on hers. He was a young man; you couldn’t expect much better of him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Her lips were cold and hard; it was like kissing a frozen lump. But slowly, they warmed, and suddenly she was hot, too hot for him. </span> <span class="s1">He pulled away, cursing. His lips felt like they were burning. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The girl’s eyes fluttered open, looking confusedly around until spotting Scorpius. </span> <span class="s1">“Who the hell are you?” she bluntly asked, rubbing her eyes and sitting up slowly, yawning loudly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> <span class="s1">Scorpius cringed; how un-lady-like. “I’m Prince Scorpius, of the Malfoy kingdom. Bow in my presence, peasant.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"> <span class="s1">The girl raised an eyebrow at him, giving him a once-over. He smirked. He must have been very good on her sleepy eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> <span class="s1">“You? Prince Scorpius?” She scoffed. “You look like my great great aunt Muriel.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"> <span class="s1">Scorpius scowled, flushing red. The <em>nerve</em> of this girl! Why, he ought to-</span></p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But her mouth continued speaking stupidly. “And what do you mean, peasant? Do you not know who I am?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Someone beneath me,” he spat out, wondering why he was on the floor talking to this deranged girl when he had way better things he could be doing, like throwing dung-bombs at the Chudley Canons for being such a horrible team.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“<em>Excuse me</em>, but I am Princess Rose, daughter of Queen-”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“What?” he choked, because, <em>her? </em>She was the famed princess of legend, the one that caused the whole kingdom to fall asleep? He was expecting someone far more regal, someone who actually looked like and behaved like a princess.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Wow, thanks,” she retorts, and he realized that he actually thought that aloud.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Well, no matter.” He stood up, brushing himself off and making no gesture to help her up whatsoever. The princess got up herself, grumbling. “You should thank me, for saving you, even if it was totally not worth it.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rose huffed, turning away. “As if. You don’t even deserve it, you lousy piece of-w</span> <span class="s1">ait.” She stared at him in confusion. “What do you mean, <em>saving me</em>? What happened?”</span></p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He sighed, explaining to her how she had been asleep for the past few years until he found the kindness in his vast heart to help her.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“How did you wake me up?” she asked, curious, and he blushed a rosy pink.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“That is none of your concern.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Tell me! I have a right to know,” she said.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Ikindofkissedyou,” he said in a rapid blur.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Can you repeat that?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius blushed darker, forcing out each word. “I. Kissed. You.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For a brief moment, there was silence. </span> <span class="s1">Scorpius closed his eyes and mentally began writing his will.</span></p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“What!? You kissed me!? What kind of creep are you, kissing me when I was asleep? I bet you would have gone farther too, if I hadn’t woken up then-”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">She ranted on and on and Scorpius was about to blow a fuse because <em>Merlin</em>, was she annoying, jumping to conclusions. Like he would ever want anything more with <em>her</em>.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">(But...her lips were quite nice. Like watermelon.)</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius shook those thoughts out of his head; he was just going to get out of here and avoid her for the rest of his life.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">(But...he might have liked kissing her. Just a little bit.)</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Either way, whether he liked her or not, she was getting on his nerves now. It was then that Scorpius decided that if she didn’t <em>shut the hell up </em>in the next second, he would have to make her...through any means possible.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Mmf!” Quickly, he cut her off by kissing her again.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius sighed into the kiss. This was heaven. And the silence - her voice was like an incessant mockingbird. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">She pulled away, looking disgusted, but her cheeks betrayed her, tinging red like her hair.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">He smiled. Well, if they were on the same page about kissing each other, it wasn’t that hard to figure out what to do next. <span class="s1">What else were you supposed to do in a broom closet anyways?</span></p>
<hr/>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">This story has been told many, many times, so many times that over the years it has changed and become a little different after each re-telling. It wouldn’t be surprising to find out that the actual story was quite different.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Either way, Princess Rose and Prince Scorpius eventually married, after five years of on-and-off dating, crying, and making out. They had a daughter, who inherited Rose’s red hair and Scorpius’s green eyes, and named her Ivy.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">To celebrate Ivy’s birth, Rose invited all the magical folks of the kingdom to bless her daughter.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Can you guess who she forgot?</span>
