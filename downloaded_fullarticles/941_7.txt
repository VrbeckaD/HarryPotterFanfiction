</p><p>
  <span>Hermione was reading her Arithmancy textbook in the blessed silence of an empty bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Thunk!</span>

    <span>Thunk!</span>

</p><p>
  <span>Hermione huffed and stomped over to the window. She threw it open and prepared to shout more than a few expletives at whomever was so determined to interrupt her studying. Hermione spotted a head of shiny blond hair on the ground below just as a packed ball of snow hit her in the face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“SORRY, GRANGER!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione wiped the snow from her face and flipped him off. She grabbed her coat and pulled on her trainers before half-running down six flights of stairs and buttoning her coat between floors. Hermione sprinted outside and her feet immediately sank into three inches of snow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco was still staring up at her window, unaware Hermione had left. She picked up a handful of snow and snuck over to where Draco continued to pelt her window with levitating snowballs. Hermione held her breath, pulled back his coat and stuffed the snow down his collar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco yelped, then turned around and pulled her into a kiss. She smiled against his lips before pulling back to ask,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you certain you don’t want to spend Christmas with me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course I do,” Draco grumbled, arms around her waist. “It’s your parents and that orange furball I’m concerned about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione stood on her toes to kiss his cheek and said, “How can I persuade you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco’s hands moved lower on her back and he smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll think of something.”</span>
