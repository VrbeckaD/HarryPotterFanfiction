    <p>Yaxley hated being wrong. It was something that drove him to distraction. His once formidably organized mind felt like a crushed wasp nest, his thoughts unable to find their way back home. Instead his mind wandered back to her and what he thought of her. He had been wrong for so long.<br/>
"Spare us. the brats of mudblood do not stir our sympathies"<br/>
Well this particular mudblood stirred something in him. It just wasn't sympathy. As his mind wandered back to Hermione Granger. Everything about her captivated him, her wild hair, her petite frame, her intellect, the way that she stood up for everything that she believed in, and  the way she trusted him nowadays. It had been 5 years since the end of the war and he and a few of the other Death Eaters had been deemed reformed.<br/>
The Wizarding World could not afford the losses of locking up all of the families that had been involved with the Dark Lord, so after a few years of probation and lining government pockets with galleons, he was free to move around.<br/>
During his time in probation he thought about her often, she had wormed her way under his skin. It didn't help that since she was a war heroine she often found herself on the pages of the Wizarding publications. Her beautiful face was often seen in the Daily Prophet.  Everything from her advances at work with the Ministry and Potions to speculation on her love life was a matter of public interest. Now that he was back inside the ministry working closely with her he knew how to differentiate between the crazy rumors (She was not having Potter's lovechild) and the truth (that she had made advances in perfecting the Wolfsbane potion)<br/>
He was working in the Department of Protection and Magical Law. He had to work from the ground up but rose quickly since he was familiar with the ministry protocols, and after proving himself valuable and independent he was second in command to Potter. He didn't mind having a boss that was so much younger than himself. Particularly when he was as closely associated with the witch that he had his eyes on.<br/>
I'll have a lot more than my eyes on her before the end of the evening.<br/>
That was the reason why he was so much closer to Hermione. He wasn't just assigned to protect her whenever she traveled, but had earned the respect of Potter. Thankfully Gryffindors had forgiving hearts and gullible minds.<br/>
He had a first row seat to her professionalism, and her work ethic, that and her razor sharp wit made him want to possess her even more. He had opportunities to see her in those tight muggle clothes whenever she worked in her office.<br/>
They were supposed to be professional muggles clothes. He didn't know how muggle men were able to get anything done when working if their women looked half as good as she did in those pencil skirts and heels.<br/>
They both should have been careful about trusting him with her. Treasures like her should be guarded. It wasn't his fault that he took advantage of his closeness to her.<br/>
He knew that she would be unable to control her interest in his family library, and as an excuse to offer her and Potter some reprieve from the cameras and the Wizarding media he offered his family house as an alternative place to meet. Away from prying eyes and ears they were able to conduct ministry business in a more relaxed atmosphere. She slowly let her guard down over multiple visits.<br/>
He casually strolled into the family library with the window that overlooked his expansive family garden.<br/>
He imagined having her next to the gardenias, just a few feet away from the Yaxley bridal altar where he would bind her to him.<br/>
He was the last of his family line, and Corban Yaxley was still considered an upper class Pureblood. Sure he was well into his years, if he had been a muggle he would have been considered old. As a wizard however he was well in his prime, and in need of a wife and mistress for his family home and heirs.<br/>
His ancestors particularly his father would be rolling in their graves. May they all rot in Hell. They had all been incorrigibly wrong. She was not dirt beneath anyone's feet. She would restore his family name and honor. Their future children would be the pinnacle of magical power. He just had to make sure that she had no choice in husband.<br/>
Part of the reason as to the wild speculation into her love life was that it was extremely unusual for a young eligible witch to be found unmarried. Their society was still stuck in the middle ages were that was concerned.<br/>
Which worked out for him. There were no real laws against binding a witch in marriage.  It had just fallen out of practice.<br/>
He had heard that even Malfoy had tried to fight his way back into her good graces for a shot to make her his bride. Every major family who had a son that was looking for a wife tried to curry her favor by inviting her to lavish parties and making donations to her charities, one misguided and gauche Italian Wizard had actually had a marble statue of her made and presented to the Prime Minister and Hermione during their last visit. Hermione had blushed scarlet at the state of undress of the statue and practiced extreme tact by asking for it to be placed up for auction with the proceeds directed to the educations of other muggleborns. He knew for a fact that Potter himself had bought it and had it quietly destroyed to save her any further embarrassment.<br/>
His department oversaw her safety and he had the good fortune to use his position to get rid of many 'gifts' that potential suitors sent her. Thankfully no one had enlightened her or Potter about that. She was just grateful that she was able to work without having to fight her way to her office in a sea of letters from admirers.<br/>
"Yaxley, I'll be heading home. Hermione, do you need anything before I leave?" Potter patted his robes absentmindedly while walking into the office next door that held the floo out of the Yaxley property.<br/>
"No Harry, I'll be fine" She was still pouring over the papers on her lap.</p><p>"Miss. Granger is welcome to this estate as long as she wishes"<br/>
He spoke clearly behind her. His hand itched to wrap itself around her hair and he imagined being able to hold her hair while he branded her body as his.<br/>
It'll be her home soon enough</p><p>She didn't even flinch as his proximity. She didn't have a clue to his darker desires, she just kept on working.<br/>
Potter and Yaxley walked over to the next office, where Yaxley saw Potter take the floo out of the manor, and proceeded to place the necessary charms to make sure that they wouldn't be disturbed. He summoned his top house elf and requested a light appetizer and some tea to be brought to the library.<br/>
He walked back to the library, and found a sight he hoped to see for many years to come, she had stood up and placed some of the papers on the nearby table, and was currently bent over the table. Her exquisite backside screamed at him to run his hands over it. To claim her before she could stop him. He just needed to wait a few more hours. Everything was almost in place. He just needed her to have a taste of the tea to set everything in motion.<br/>
As if on cue the house elf walked in carrying the tea and a plate tea sandwiches The tea looked like it was white tea, plain and appropriate, Yaxley knew that it wasn't. It would start something that she wouldn't be able to stop, in fact that no one would be able to stop.<br/>
"Miss. Granger, you need to eat something. The last bit of food I saw pass your lips was early this morning. You have already worked thru lunch. I won’t let you starve yourself. Even if it is for the betterment of the wizarding world.”</p><p>She smirked at him, “Yaxley, stop mothering me. I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself" She walked over  to the tea tray and picked up a cup and served herself. He had a moment of elation when she brought up the tea to her mouth, but he saw a flicker of recognition go across her face. He was glad that he had studied her so thoroughly, that he was able to recognize the slight almost unnoticeable tension on her face. She turned to him and smiled.<br/>
"Yaxley, could you please have some water brought up instead?" She placed the cup very precisely back on the tray. Delicately and smoothly. No wonder she had been central to Potter winning the war. She always seemed to figure things out.<br/>
"Sure, just give me a second" He turned away from her and felt her relax. She was processing that maybe someone else had managed to infiltrate his kitchens and attempted to give her a potion, or him. She was able but he had been a Deatheater. It just took a second to disarm her, and vanish her wand and belongings to his personal quarters, and now he had her. Just a vibrant, beautiful woman and him. Her face showed shock but not fear. She moved behind the large desk and started looking for something to defend herself.<br/>
"What are you playing at Yaxley." The tiniest crack in her voice as she screamed at him told him that maybe she was just a little afraid.<br/>
"Corban, my first name is Corban, you need to learn to call me that when we're alone." He made sure that she saw his wand in his hand.<br/>
"Now please put down the paperweight and sit down."<br/>
She stood stock still behind the desk, looking at him wearily and at the tea tray. She made a choice to try and crash everything to the floor, to destroy the potion and maybe distract him. He jinxed her, just a small jinx a mild electric shock to have her jerk back. He never wanted to cause her pain, but she had to see reason. She was meant to be with him, to be bound to him.<br/>
"What the hell is going?" she was breathing rapidly, searching the room for an escape route, the window behind her was too high for her to jump out. She was going to try and bolt past him. He would love to chase her, but he wanted to get this started, he could chase her later. He would have their entire lives to chase her.<br/>
He flicked his wand, and had her sitting as if bound to the chair, it reminded him of the position his victims had when they were interrogated in the bottom of the ministry of magic. He felt a completely different kind of joy watching her now. There was a small expanse of flushed skin exposed to his gaze. He placed his fingers on it, she was deliciously warm.<br/>
"Yaxley, look at me." She used a soft voice, a calm, reasonable voice. He met her eyes.<br/>
"What is it that you want from me?"<br/>
He loomed over her, he was after all a huge man, all long arms and limbs, and grabbed her hair making her look at his eyes.<br/>
She stared back, she was angry.<br/>
"All this trouble to fuck me? Yaxley! You couldn't have just asked me out for a drink?" She was struggling, attempting to use some sort of wandless magic to fight her way free.<br/>
"What you detected in the tea is very similar to some lust potions, but that isn't what I was giving you. You ever heard of the  binding? I wouldn't be surprised if you had, but this particular brew  is very ancient magic tied to my house, and I am shocked that you think I would be satisfied with just fucking you."<br/>
She stilled, somewhere she had come across it.<br/>
"You wouldn't dare!" All the calmness was gone from her, she continued struggling against her invisible bindings. "It's illegal! You despicable...."<br/>
She quieted as I held her face in my hands. "That's where you are wrong sweetheart. It isn't illegal, just frowned upon, I checked"<br/>
I reached out and took a sip of the lukewarm tea, her eyes widening and I crashed my mouth on hers while I forced the potion into her mouth with my kiss. I tasted her and the pomegranates, and I felt myself harden at my impeding victory.<br/>
She would be mine, and as my possession she would no longer be a distraction, but my  wife, my mistress and my obsession</p>
