    <p>If Hermione had known how the night was going to turn out, she would have shaved.</p><p>Or maybe, she wouldn’t.</p><p>The pair of hands that slid up her sides, underneath the dress, to slowly pull down the pantyhose didn’t seem to mind the hair on her legs when they caressed her naked thighs, or even when the fingertips found their way around the underwear to caress her clit in slow, circular motions.</p><p>Hermione went down the kitchen counter top, to the floor, so the touch could reach her better. A pair of lips landed on her neck and stayed there as the hand kept its rhythm. Her breath became more and more difficult, her muscles clenching as the pleasure built up. Her fingertips dug into clothed shoulder blades.</p><p>Then the pleasure reached its peak, and Hermione went limp: the only thing stopping her from sliding to the floor was the body pressed against hers.</p><p>She held back a surprised yelp when a finger slipped inside her. And a second one, in patient thrusts.</p><p>“Where is the bedroom?”</p><p>With that, Hermione opened her eyes, as if coming out of a trance.</p><p>Was she really going to hook up with Snape, right after a Ministry function?</p><p>Well…</p><p>Yes.</p><p>And she wasn’t too surprised he wanted her, either. He had a type, didn’t he?</p><p>Maybe Hermione wasn’t white or had red hair, but she <em>was</em> a muggleborn Gryffindor.</p>
