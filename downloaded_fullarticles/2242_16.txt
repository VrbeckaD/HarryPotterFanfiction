</p><p>In your hand, take this key. So long as you have the makings, then through this simple act of taking, its wielder you shall one day be. No ocean will contain you then. No more borders around, or below, or above, so long as you champion the ones you love.</p><p>Although he had been very young back then, Harry remembered his grandfather’s words very well. The words that sealed his fate as one of the Keyblade’s chosen. Ever since that day, his grandfather had taught him about the Keyblade and the wielders of such a weapon. First the basic things, stuff that a six-year-old could understand. In that magical place Merlin had created at the request of his grandfather, time held no meaning. He could hardly tell how long it was that they had been there, but he knew it was a long time. And it was there that he had been trained for quite a long time as a Keyblade wielder.</p><p>But now he was gone. His grandfather was gone, and his training had stopped. He could be ten years old, but Harry knew that the Keyblade was a beacon for the Heartless since they had begun to invade the Realm of Light a few years ago.</p><p>Things had become far more dangerous than they were supposed to be. But, then again, it was his grandfather who did all the-</p><p>“Hey there, squibby!”</p><p>Whatever thoughts he had were suddenly dispelled, as Harry’s body became stiff and his eyes narrowed slightly in annoyance. Sighing, he relaxed and quickly turned around to look at the newcomer.</p><p>Michael.</p><p>Why did he have to be so irritating? Never there was a day that he was free from his older brother’s teasing.</p><p>The eldest of the Potter children was leaning against the door frame with a smirk on his face.</p><p>He had no visible signs of accidental magic. Events of accidental magic were already rare for all wizards, and since those he had happened while with his grandfather, it only made sense that no one else had seen it happen. And for that reason, he had been “branded” by Michael as a squib. He wasn’t really sure if the older of his brothers truly meant those words, of if it was just empty teasing. Regardless, wizard or no, he would not be using a wand in the foreseeable future.</p><p>He had a good reason for that. One they could not know.</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>“Oh? Can’t I come and say goodbye to my favourite brother?”</p><p>Harry blinked, his face reflecting the confusion which now addled his mind. “Goodbye?”</p><p>“Yeah. Hogwarts, remember?” said Michael, slightly waving his wand as if trying to make a point.</p><p>“Already?” asked Harry, a bit surprised that it was already the first of September. Time really flew fast.</p><p>“Damn Harry! Is your head in another world or something?” asked Michael, amusement and bewilderment evident in his voice. “That’s all we talked about last dinner!”</p><p>Did they? Harry could hardly remember, truth be told. He had so much things on his mind that almost all background conversations simply weren’t there at all. Even now, he was half distracted, enough that he had not realized his brother was now sitting right next to him on his bed.</p><p>“Still thinking about it?”</p><p>Harry knew what was the “it” his brother referred to. It had been nearly three weeks since old Fleamont Potter had died, and while there was the usual sadness when a close family member passed away, things seemed to return to normal as the days passed. Yet of Fleamont’s four grandchildren, Harry had been undoubtedly the closest to him, and this was something all of them knew. He still hadn’t adapted to the fact his grandfather was gone, and sometimes his mind tricked him, making him briefly believe he had not died. Of course, it would take seconds for the reality to crash down hard, leaving Harry with an emptiness in his heart that could not be filled. Not to mention he was often too distracted by thoughts regarding his future. More specifically, what he had been planning to do for a few days.</p><p>He nodded in response, but before his brother could say anything else, a voice came from downstairs.</p><p>“Michael, hurry!”</p><p>It had been their mother who shouted, making the older of the Potter children groan. “Yes mum!”</p><p>He ruffled Harry’s hair, drawing a yelp from his younger brother.</p><p>“Well, see you in a year, squib!”</p><p>Harry watched as his brother ran off, the sound of his footsteps quickly fading away.</p><p>And despite everything, Harry could not help but smile.</p><p>“May your heart be your guiding key.”</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>A week had passed since then, and now Harry was at finally prepared for what would come.</p><p>Well… “prepared”. That was a lie if ever thought of one. Against what he wanted, he was forcing himself to do this.</p><p>Harry looked behind him, the shape of his house and the lights coming from inside vanishing behind the tall trees. In his hand he carried a bag filled with the essentials he would need for the future. The Black Coat he wore would shield him from the darkness in the pathways he would use, but it would also made him extremely hard to see in the darkness that permeated the woods. Unfortunately, this darkness also worked both ways, for he could hardly see anything in the dark of the night.</p><p>And yet, the dark itself took shape before him, and Harry saw a dark figure appear before him, the only discernible thing being the dark ragged robes and hood that covered the stranger.</p><p>Barely, perhaps, but he could still see the man.</p><p>“Leaving them, are you?” he spoke. “Aren’t you acting rashly?”</p><p>The voice was deep, but it held a strange familiarity to it, which Harry was unable to pinpoint.</p><p>“Who are you?” he demanded.</p><p>There was silence. Harry’s hand was twitching, as if eager to summon the Keyblade so that he could drive away whoever this was.</p><p>“My name… has no importance,” claimed the unknown man. “But I know yours, Harry Potter… chosen of the Keyblade.”</p><p>Harry felt his pulse start to race. That this man knew not just his identity but also the fact that he wielded the Keyblade was alarming. He had never told anyone, and as far as he knew, his grandfather had never told anyone else in this world.</p><p>“Tell me, are you truly willing to go ahead with this… adventure of yours?” asked the figure as it approached. “Where exactly will you go? Into light… or into darkness?”</p><p>The fact that he was being approached by the stranger made Harry immediately summon his Keyblade, pointing it at the cloaked figure.</p><p>“None of your business!” he nearly growled.</p><p>The cloaked figure made a sound which Harry could hardly discern, almost like a suppressed laugh or cough.</p><p>“In that case…”</p><p>Around him dark shapes emerged, the sound of helmet pieces moving invading the near silent forest. Harry knew what these creatures were, but he had never seen this type.</p><p>“… allow me to show you.”</p><p>Before him, the very air around the cloaked figure shimmered, and the strange man faded away, leaving Harry alone with the small group of Heartless. He immediately dropped the bag, readying himself for battle against the dark creatures. The small Heartless tried to get closer, but Harry simply slashed at them with the Keyblade. It took a few hits for each, but he managed to destroy the Heartless and leave the tense situation unscathed. But the unknown man was gone, and now he was alone in the dark woods. Harry cared little if he came back, but the fact that he had somehow controlled the Heartless made him worried. He knew that the Realm of Light was in danger from a Heartless invasion, and having around someone who could control the Heartless wasn’t good. The Keyhole of this world had been already sealed by his grandfather, so there any attempts at taking its heart would be in vain.</p><p>An invasion of the Heartless in this world would end in disaster. For a Keyblade wielder, they were fair game, but normal weapons could not harm the Heartless. And Harry wasn’t sure if the magic of this world could either. He had never seen it, and he wasn’t going to risk it. Not to mention the Keyblade itself served as a beacon for the dark creatures, which meant they would specifically search for him.</p><p>It just wasn’t safe for him to remain around. For their sake, he had to leave.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>As he left the Corridor of Darkness, Harry’s eyes were met with an orange sky.</p><p>Twilight Town.</p><p>He had been here once before. He knew little about the town, other than it was in the Realm Between, where few worlds lingered.</p><p>Right now, he was in a small clearing, behind him a path that led into the deep forest outside of the city. But his destination was not the city proper, but what lay in its outskirts. Looking at the mansion behind him, Harry saw a few things that caught his attention. More specifically, the broken windows.</p><p>He stepped closer to the gate, dropping the bag near it before looking at the chains and lock on the metallic barrier. Eyes drawn to the door behind the gates, Harry smiled.</p><p>“Perfect.”</p>
