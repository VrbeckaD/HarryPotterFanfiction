    <p>Eleanor Waters was remarkably average. Her mother and father ran a rescue shelter for injured creatures, both magical and not just outside Birmingham. They lived on three acres of land with enough space for the animals to recuperate and the cottage the three of them lived in. Eleanor had lived an altogether peaceful life. There wasn’t much need to leave home as her mother, who had a master’s in Herbology, would grow their food and more often than not sew their clothes. She lived in the company of all manner of creatures and her mother’s garden. She had begun to learn simple incantations when she was very young, just healing spells she would mutter under her breath, barely strong enough to mend an owl’s wing, but for a girl of eight, she supposed it was impressive. She was a scholar in the making, or that’s what her mother would say whenever she saw Eleanor and her father holed up in his study with piles of books and scrolls surrounding them. Michael Waters stood a 6’4” exactly. He had reached this height at sixteen and had asked Madam Pomphry to cast a spell so he would grow no taller. She obliged if purely because the idea of a seventh year standing at more than two meters high frightened the life out of her. He was a bit of a muggle enthusiast and he often exchanged letters with another such connoisseur called Arthur Weasley. Michael had a head of tousled black hair that could only belong to a scholar, brown eyes, and a pair of rectangle glasses perched on a nose that was crooked as the result of a broken bone he had never bothered to properly mend. He was significantly paler than her mother, who spent all her time in the sun. Hestia Waters was the picture of her great-great-great aunt, Rowena Ravenclaw. She had the same shade of black hair, though Hestia’s was cut around her ears and had streaks of grey, and the same blue eyes that seemed to resemble chasms, or the petals of a forget-me-not.</p><p>Eleanor had led what she supposed to be an unconventional childhood for a girl of her blood status. Most pure-blood girls grew up knowing they were being groomed to enter society and meet a good pure-blood boy, but Eleanor knew nothing of that. The most she saw of society was the odd family friend that would drop by and stay for a month or two, like one of the animals they cared for. It wasn’t until someone who was decidedly <em> not </em> a family friend dropped by that Eleanor caught a glimpse of what wizard society truly was.</p><p> </p><p>She was ten years old when the Malfoy’s came to visit. She thought Lucius looked more like a statue than a human, not only because his hair matched his skin in sickly pallor, but because his eyes were void of the spark she had attributed to humanity. That little flicker of kindness she found in beasts and people alike. Lucius had frightened her, and so would his wife had she not sent her the briefest flicker of a smile, the twitch of her lips had faded too quickly, almost as if the woman was afraid her husband would catch her with a smile on her face. They had brought along little pale Draco with them, who’s stiff countenance and posture was so opposite Eleanor’s it was almost laughable. Eleanor lived her every waking moment in the sun, her eyes were a wide glimmering amber, and her hair fell in jet black ringlets down her back. She had initially smiled at Draco when their parents had left them to convene in her father’s study, but he did not return her smile. She was inexperienced with children her age as most of her time was spent with adults or animals, but she did make an attempt to be kind to him.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco’s a funny name.” she had not said it to be cruel. Eleanor was only commenting on his originality, it had never occurred to her that being different might be a bad thing. But when his impassive statuesque expression (unnerving on the face of a child) had morphed into one of devastating rage she had realized her mistake. When Draco had left Eleanor had made it a point to tell her mother and father that the Malfoys were not very nice people. Her parents had agreed.</p><p> </p><p>It was in the spring of her ninth year that Uncle Remus had first visited. It had been seven years since the Waters’s had heard anything from their old friend. After the war had disappeared along with most of their old comrades. It was storming that night and Eleanor had been kept awake by the claps of thunder, making abrupt eye-contact with the nearly full moon. Petrified, she wanted to go to her parents but feared that she would wake them. When she heard something topple over in the kitchen she was finally induced to rise from the strangling hold of her sky blue sheets and find her mother and father. What she found instead was her crying panicked mother destroying their kitchen in a frantic search for something that apparently could not be found, and her father hunched over what appeared to be a dead body. Only it wasn’t a dead body, because it was convulsing and bleeding uncontrollably.</p><p> </p><p>“Dad? Who is that?”</p><p> </p><p>“My wand! Get my wand, Eleanor!” the girl was frozen in place, looking at the rolled over eyes on a one Remus Lupin. “Now, Eleanor!” she leaped to action. This was nothing new, it was often that she would awake to see her parents scrambling to heal some poor mangled creature, only this time it wasn’t an animal. She found her father’s wand and he began murmuring healing spells as soon as it was in his hand. Then she went to the kitchen and found what her poor panicked mother was looking for, a vial of Wiggenweld potion. Most of the potion was kept in the storehouse near the animals, it was rare that a member of the family would injure themselves badly enough to warrant anything more than a simple incantation. But it was kept on hand in case of emergency’s; like when Eleanor had fractured her skull on a rock making an attempt at levitation in their garden.</p><p> </p><p>Her mother had tutted while brushing her locks of hair away from her face. <em> “You must learn to be patient with yourself, Elly. Everything comes in time and there isn’t any rush for you to grow up so quickly.” </em> Eleanor had learned her lesson, but not quite in the way her mother had wanted her to. She stopped levitating on rocky terrain, but she continued over her bed, stabilizing herself until she was sure of her abilities. Mrs. Waters always joked and said it was no wonder Eleanor was so ambitious seeing as Mr. Waters had ended up in Slytherin.</p><p> </p><p>She stayed up all night watching over the sleeping form of Remus Lupin. It was not uncommon to find Eleanor Waters lain on the hay-strewn floor of the shelter, nothing but a wooly blanket to accompany her as she watched over a new animal. They were always the most frightened on their first nights, no doubt expecting the same heavy hand that those outside of <em> Ravenclaw's Rescues </em> used too often.</p><p> </p><p>Remus Lupin awoke to the wide curious eyes of Eleanor Waters, and for a minute he had mistaken her for an owl. She only stared at him as he sat up on the cot her parents had made up for him, not offering a word as she assessed this new acquaintance.</p><p> </p><p>“You must be Eleanor, I am Remus Lupin.” he was the first to speak, reaching his hand out to greet the girl. She placed her hand, which was four times smaller in his and gave it a firm shake.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you okay?” he grimaced as he swung his legs over the side of the cot, which no doubt pulled the still healing wound on his side.</p><p> </p><p>“Much better now thanks to your parents.” she nodded and handed him a mug of tea she had prepared for him. “Why thank you, Eleanor, that’s very kind.” he blew away a curl of steam and took a sip.</p><p> </p><p>“How do you know my mum and dad?” he paused and looked over her slowly, trying to gauge how much he was in his right to divulge.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you know anything about what happened before you were born?” she nodded proudly, despite her age her parents had not tried to shield her from the truths of the world, only help her understand how to live with them. She fancied herself a proper adult with all the history texts she had read and her knowledge of the war. Her parents were too amused to tell her any differently.</p><p> </p><p>“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named started a group called the Death Eaters who were founded on the principle that pure-blooded wizards and witches are superior to half-bloods and muggle-borns. Seeing as that’s ridiculous, the Order of the Pheonix was formed in order to put an end to his reign of terror.” Remus smiled, amused. She had recited that passage from <em> Modern Magical History, 1725-Present </em>, he remembered Mr. Waters reading it to him when the book was first published.</p><p> </p><p>“Indeed, well, your mother and father built this place as a sanctuary for injured witches and wizards during the war. Rowena Ravenclaw herself cast the protective enchantments here and it was one of the few barriers that Voldemort-” she gasped at the sound of his name, eyes darting as though he might climb from the plaster. “... could not penetrate. They are incredibly brave, your mum and dad.” Eleanor smiled and nodded, she knew this of course. Her mum and dad were easily the best people in the world, everyone said so.</p><p> </p><p>They sat in silence for a while, Remus clasping his mug and Eleanor pondering the possibility of developing a new friendship. “Are you hungry, Mr. Lupin?”</p><p> </p><p>“Starved, actually.”</p><p> </p><p>“How do you like your eggs?” she was already padding to the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>Remus Lupin stayed with the Waters for five months. They converted Mrs. Waters's indoor botany lab back into a guest room and her vials and herbs and things scattered from the kitchen all the way to Ravenclaw's Rescues. Eleanor began calling Remus 'Uncle Remy' on the second day of his stay, and they kept up correspondence long after he had left. It had been a while since Remus was Remy to anyone, much less <em> Uncle </em> Remy, so he lavished gifts upon her and never failed to visit on either Christmas or her birthday. She had a bookshelf filled with books he had gifted her, as well as the odd trinket. A Cornish music box that was said to have belonged to a cannibalistic Vampire, a toy from the muggle world called a Magic 8-Ball, that was probably the least magical thing he had given her. The best gift had been on her eleventh birthday. He had not come to give it in person as he was away Greenland studying something that was sure to be morbid in a cave that was probably cold enough to make him lose a toe or two. He sent along a picture of the icy coast, two baby polar bears wrestling in the snow. She tore through the brown wrapping like a lion tearing into a zebra. There, nestled in the paper was a wooden box, orange poppies painted on the lid. It was long, the size of half of her forearm, she opened it and her mouth fell open.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Merlin’s beard. </em>” she whispered in awe, there, laying on a pillow, was the cutest kitten Eleanor had ever seen in her life. Her mother burst out laughing when she leaned over to see what her daughter was so shocked about.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Remus! He <em> would </em> do something like this. Darling, come see what Lupin gave your daughter.” Mr. Waters chuckled fondly.</p><p> </p><p>“Well it’s perfect timing, now you have a pet for Hogwarts.” it’s coloring was Siamese, but the coat was too long for it to be purebred. She poked his black nose and the kitten blinked two blue pools up at her in annoyance, twitching its’ tiny tail and turning away from her. She giggled and lifted the kitten from its bed gently, ignoring its meows of protest. She still had an animal bed from when she had kept a family of hedgehogs in her room last summer. She set the bed beside her desk as she began to write a thank you note for Lupin.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Uncle Remy, </em>
</p><p><em> Thanks for my present! I’ve helped care for cats before but I’ve never really had one of my own so you can imagine how delighted I was when I opened the box, which, by the way, is the prettiest thing I think I’ve ever seen. I’ll be bringing both box and cat to Hogwarts when my term begins. Mum is hoping I’ll be sorted into Ravenclaw to hold uphold the family legacy, but dad reckons I’d do better in Slytherin, and I know you and all their other friends must be partial to Gryfindor so I really have no idea what to think. I’m still trying to find a name for him, I think he’s still warming up to me so after we know each other better I’ll be able to find something suitable. Despite how happy I was to get him in the post, I was disappointed not to have you over this year. You will come for Christmas, won’t you? I won’t come home at all if you don’t visit and I’ll be sure to tell my parents that the estrangement of their daughter is entirely your fault. </em> <em>How is Greenland? What are you researching? Stay safe, Uncle Remy. Don’t go getting yourself killed. And thanks again for Bird, he really is the best cat. </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Much love, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Ele</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her mother also slipped a vial of crushed Bicorn horn and Mandrake root with instructions for a dash to be put in in cup of morning tea, it would keep him warm throughout the day, and the letter was sent.</p><p> </p><p>Spring and Summer passed unremarkably. She was left to tend to customers who wanted to adopt and was also placed in charge of the upkeep of the stables. In the morning she would help her mother in the garden, though that often meant reading a book under the yew tree while Bird attacked unsuspecting bees and butterflies. When the time came to begin preparing for Hogwarts, Eleanor experienced the joy of having her first panic attack.</p><p> </p><p>She was sat on the floor of her bedroom, knees jutting sharply into the center of her chest as if that would make things any better. Bird was incredibly concerned, his meows getting louder the longer she didn’t reassure him that she was okay. But she could scarcely hear anything other than the rush of blood in her ears. The cat stood on his hind legs and placed his paws on her knees, his tiny grey face darting around, trying to understand what was wrong. She had known less than ten children in her life, and none of the few she knew kept in touch with her. What would it be like to be trapped in a castle without any means of escape? The concept of independence had always intrigued Eleanor, going off on hundreds of adventures, not a care in the world. But as the reality of being alone began to dawn on her she realized that she might not be ready for anything like that. There was a knock at the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright dear?”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine mum!" she shouted.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, we leave for Diagon alley at noon!”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine!”</p><p> </p><p>The footsteps of her mother receded and Eleanor’s panicked breaths returned, succinctly followed by a helpless sob. Eleanor squeezed herself tighter and furrowed her brow, trying desperately to calm down.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It’s just a school, loads of kids go there all the time and they’re all fine, you will be too. If all those other kids can do it why shouldn’t you? Mum and dad fought in a war, Uncle Remy travels the world, this is nothing. You could be dead in a ditch, you could be fighting in a war, this is fine. This is minor. This is fine. This is minor. This is fine. This is minor. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She repeated this mantra in her head until she felt well enough to stand. Bird had long given up meowing. He had instead lain in front of her feet, occasionally licking her big toe to remind her she wasn’t alone, or that’s what she liked to think at least. She looked into the ornamental mirror that had belonged to Rowena Ravenclaw, and now sat in the corner of an eleven-year old’s room, and scowled angrily at herself. She pushed her long hair from her face and stared at herself until the red had gone from her cheeks and the tracks of her tears had dried. She gave a deep breath and pulled on a blue cable knit jumper.</p><p> </p><p>“Mum!” she called. “I’m ready!” her mother popped her head out of the kitchen, flour on her forehead and covering her black shirt.</p><p> </p><p>“Perfect, darling, let me just change this shirt and we’ll be on our way.”</p><p> </p><p>The Waters stepped into the fireplace after Mr. Waters shouted ‘Diagon Alley’ and all Eleanor could see for a handful of seconds was green.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright darling, where do you want to go first?” Eleanor looked at her father as if he had just asked the stupidest question ever asked by anyone. He sucked his teeth in amusement. “Ollivanders. Right.” he led the way confidently, parting the crowd easily with his remarkably tall stature. Eleanor followed with her heart drumming in her chest. She was not at all apprehensive about this part of the process. This was something that Eleanor had sought too eagerly. She often fashioned pretend wands from the fallen twigs of the yew tree in her yard, flourishing them through the air best she could and yelling out spells she had heard her mother and father using. When the door to Olivander’s opened and she stepped inside for the first time she almost cried out from happiness. At last, she was becoming a proper witch. There were a pair of ginger boys already there, they stood with a man Eleanor assumed must be their father. One of the twins already had his wand, he sat with the parcel on his lap, patiently waiting as his brother tested another one.</p><p> </p><p>“Pine, Pheonix feather core, 11 ¾, flexible.” an old man said, emerging from behind a bookshelf that reached the ceiling and was stuffed to the brim with all manner of wands.</p><p> </p><p>Eleanor could tell her father was eager to speak with the red-haired man, but he waited patiently for the boy to test the wand. He did and a bright orange firework shot from the tip, exploding and scattering in the air.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ve found your wand, Mr. Weasley.” as soon as the boy’s wand was taken by Ollivander to be wrapped Mr. Waters stepped forward.</p><p> </p><p>“Arthur!" he greeted jovially. The pear-shaped man turned with a wide grin and the two men embraced, remarking on how very long it had been since they had seen each other. “This is my daughter, Eleanor, Elly this is my friend Mr. Weasley, you remember him don’t you? He’s the one you gave you that stuffed owl on your sixth birthday.” ah yes, she remembered that owl. It had been her bedtime companion for years until a particularly nasty manticore and ripped it to shreds. She also vaguely remembered the presence of the Weasley’s on her sixth birthday party. He had two boys here age who had been absolute <em> terrors, </em> she had begged her mother not to invite them back after she saw them goading a dying Pheonix, but children could be cruel. She was certain they had matured since then. Not to mention she had got on well enough with their older brothers.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes! Mr. Weasley, it’s lovely to see you again.”</p><p> </p><p>“These are two of mine, Fred, George, come say hello.” the twins stood and greeted Eleanor’s mother and father with perfectly pleasant smiles. The three adults had fallen into what appeared to be a very heated discussion about toaster ovens and Eleanor looked at the twins awkwardly as they waited for Fred’s wand to be wrapped.</p><p> </p><p>“So you two are first years?” it was a stupid question. She knew they were first years, they were the same age as her. Their faces brightened despite the redundancy of her question, however, and she was relieved. “I think I’ll be getting into Ravenclaw.” they scoffed and exchanged glances.</p><p> </p><p>“Really, Eleanor, you ought to hope for better for yourself…”</p><p> </p><p>“... Everyone knows <em> Gryffindor </em> is the best house.”</p><p> </p><p>Eleanor smiled, she was used to the playful house rivalry. It had no real meaning behind it, but it also offered a false sense of intimacy she felt she needed in order to steal her nerves and stop asking stupid questions.</p><p> </p><p>“And let me guess, your mummy told you that?” she asked with on black eyebrow arched high above the other.</p><p> </p><p>“No.”  George denied with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>“We happen to know it for a fact.” Fred put on a fake haughty air that reminded Eleanor of the very real one Draco Malfoy always wore. She laughed at him and rolled her eyes. “Though, I s’pose it wouldn’t be <em> too </em> bad to be in Ravenclaw.”</p><p> </p><p>“You do look dashing in blue, Freddie.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, but you look horrid George, it completely washes you out.” George conceded with a nod.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure you could even make Ravenclaw? Aren’t they supposed to be intellectuals?” her kind smile let them know she was joking and the twins mocked offense.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll have you know that I am supremely intellectual,” George affirmed Fred’s statement.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s true, I once saw him reading Socrates.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well color me impressed.” Eleanor did not look the least impressed.</p><p> </p><p>“Here is your wand, Mr. Weasley, use it wisely, and Mr. Weasley, that’ll be fourteen galleons.” Eleanor saw Fred and George wince when Ollivander gave voice to the total and she stepped a bit closer to them instinctively. Mr. Weasley paid without fuss and the boys immediately tore through Ollivander’s careful wrapping.</p><p> </p><p>“Where’re you off to now, Arthur?”</p><p> </p><p>“Home, I s’spect. Though Molly won’t be home for a few hours.”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you say to a glass of ale? My treat.” Arthur seemed to be about to object before Mrs. Waters stepped in.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll look after the boys, Arthur, you two go catch up.” Hestia’s smile was warm and she pat Arthur gently on the arm.</p><p> </p><p>“Only if it’s not too much trouble, Hestia- Fred and George can be a bit-” Hestia rolled her forget-me-not eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Arthur, if I can handle a room full of injured and wizards I can handle a pair of eleven-year-olds.” relief washed over Arthur’s face and he agreed to go with Mr. Waters enthusiastically.</p><p> </p><p>“Fred, George, <em> behave. </em>” the twins waved cheerily to their father and Hestia smiled at the impish boys, settling on a chair and watching Eleanor pick up the first want offered to her by Olivander.</p><p> </p><p>“Little Eleanor Waters,” his crow’s feet deepened as he smiled at her. “I was wondering when you’d come to my shop, I remember your wand Hestia, Chestnut wood, dragon heartstring core, 9 ½ inches.” she nodded, patting the pocket of her dungarees, where her wand was pressed against her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s served me well for many years.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then let’s find one that’ll do the same for you, shall we Ms. Waters?” he unboxed the wand he was holding. “Cypress wood, dragon heartstring core, eight inches, slightly springy.”</p><p> </p><p>Her hand clasped around the handle and she knew immediately this was nit the wand for her. She released it as though the wood burned her, frowning at the stick in Ollivander’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Not this one, eh? Alright...  Let’s see… Let’s see… Ah! Here we are, Dogwood, Pheonix feather core, 8 ¾.”</p><p> </p><p>Eleanor, at least, did not experience immediate revolution upon touching this want. She held it a lot and gave it a hearty slash through the air, a window shattered and she shrieked, clamping her hands over her ears. Her mother looked extraordinarily surprised.</p><p> </p><p>“Volatile,” Ollivander remarked, and he wasn’t referring to the wand. He quickly mended the window before disappearing again among the stacks of wands, giving Fred time to send her a thumbs up in congratulations.</p><p> </p><p>“George didn’t shatter <em> anything </em> while he was testing wands.”</p><p> </p><p>“Pity.” Eleanor said, still slightly jarred from the suddenness of the glass breaking. Her mother and father had experienced nothing of the sort while trying their wands out.</p><p> </p><p>“Here it is Ms. Waters! Just what I was looking for, Yew, Pheonix feather core, 11 ½, flexible.” she took it gingerly, afraid of a repeat. It was lovely polished white, the handle was carved to look like feathers. It was perfectly straight, and rather thick, though it tapered to a thin point. She waved the wand gently this time, like a conductor, and a series of purple sparks floated out, flying and filling the air, before slowly going out. “I believe we have found your wand, Ms. Waters.” Ollivander looked pleased and Mrs. Waters quickly paid and thanked him.</p><p> </p><p>Fred and George were asked if they would prefer to return to their father or go shopping for Eleanor’s school supplies. Fred looked at Eleanor and the pair smiled simultaneously, then the question was good as answered. They spent three more hours together, gathering supplies and books (Eleanor got five books that were not on the list). They were on their way to Snuddlefoot’s Stitching to pick out three pairs of school robes when Eleanor suggested they stop for ice cream.</p><p> </p><p>“Would you boys like ice cream-? Who am I kidding? What sort of child doesn’t like ice cream?”</p><p> </p><p>“One of reprehensible character, that’s to be sure Mrs. Waters,” Fred informed her. Hestia nodded solemnly.</p><p> </p><p>“I trust you Weasley boys don't spend any time with that shady lot.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not at all, Mrs. Waters, we would never hang around that sort.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good, then what flavor would you like?” she approached the counter and put in her order for black cherry and Eleanor’s of peanut butter fudge, waiting patiently for Fred and George to make their decision.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll take chocolate please,” George told the man.</p><p> </p><p>“The same.”</p><p> </p><p>Ice cream in hand, Fred and George educated Eleanor on fashion no’s, and informed her that periwinkle washed her out, though she wasn’t convinced they knew what periwinkle was.</p><p> </p><p>“And a dress, love? In my day we had balls, banquets, the like, you’ll be wanting to look your best!” Hestia practically sang as she spun down the fancy dress isle. She pulled out something with lace and tutted, putting it back.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think first years are invited to those, mum.” she frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“Pity. In your third year, then.” They stood at the entrance to the Leaky Cauldron, Eleanor wishing to prolong the Weasley’s departure. She felt for the first time in a while, at peace. Like she belonged. Fred and George had completely alleviated her fears and inhibitions, if everyone at Hogwarts was like them, forget going, she would never leave!</p><p> </p><p>She smiled sadly, unsure of what to do, they seemed to be wondering the same thing.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll see you in three weeks, then.” she cleared her throat awkwardly, turning to follow her mum into the Leaky Cauldron.</p><p> </p><p>“Er-! Say, Waters, write to me, won’t you? Maybe if I do some last-minute studying I’ll have a chance at being an intellectual, and I’m at a loss for what to read.” she grinned and tucked her hair behind her ear, pulling out a neverending ink quill she had stuck in there.</p><p> </p><p>“Give me your hand, Weasley.” he quickly obliged, all but thrusting his arm into her grasp. She quickly scrawled her address on his freckled skin. “Write me, then.” she quickly added, “You too George, some reading would do you good.” he frowned distastefully.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not a traitor like Fred,” he said pointedly, pretending to glare at his brother.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever you say Georgie.” she laughed. “Bye, then.” her eyes met Fred’s and both looked away quickly. “I’ll see you two soon.” she grinned and gave a cheeky wave goodbye, jogging after her mother who was shouting at her to hurry.</p>
