  <strong>Part 1</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>CELINE</strong>
</p><p><strong>            </strong>It had never been like this before. She was always coming and going with the rising and setting of the sun, the changing of the tides, the waxing and waning of the moon. Maybe there was no way to chart it, Merlin knows I’ve tried. She always came home though, after a day or two. I’d wake in the morning and she would be at the kitchen table, in the sun room, sitting on my bed holding my hands, like she was the type of mother who never left. This time though, I came home from school, and she wasn’t home, and she hadn’t come home, not yet, and today was the day. The most important day for her to be here. The day she never, ever let me down, until now. Which is how I found myself crying into the lap of my house elf. I heard the fire in the parlour spring into life and heavy boots stepped onto the hearth. The thud and clink of leather and metal could be heard as the unknown visitor walked anxiously through the rooms of my house and when the owner of these heavy boots found me he leaned in and took the weight I was carrying off my shoulders.  </p><p>
  <strong>SIRIUS</strong>
</p><p>            She was sitting on the kitchen floor, sobbing into her knees. Cookie, her house elf, was running her fingers through her hair and working the strands into a braid. There were tiny puddles on the linoleum where her tears had run down the curve of her knee and dropped to the floor. Her floo had been closed all summer. I’ve tried every week, and then daily. She wasn’t answering anyone’s letters, not even Lily’s. I almost didn’t try the floo today. Her mother always does her birthday up big and this birthday was the mother of all birthdays. The big 1-6. The year her mother has been eagerly anticipating and Celine has been dreading. The fact that her mother was not here to celebrate it was fucked up.</p><p>            Sixteen is the year Veela get their venom and, full use of their powers. Celine’s have been slowly creeping up over the last few months. It started with Insomnia. She would sit at the windows and stare at the moon. One night, during a full moon, we caught her scent in the woods. She was on the other side of the lake, lying in the sand, bathed in the moonlight. A light spring breeze was pulling her scent across the water and it was all James, Peter, and I could do to get Remus back into the Shrieking Shack. Demands that she not walk around the grounds at night were met with a firm “bite me, assholes” but she did agree not to wander around during a full moon. She refused to tell us how she gets outside without getting caught.</p><p>            Right around the time we took our O.W.L exams her venom came in. Pouty red lips that lured you in and stung you. A natural perfume that fogged your senses and made you want to jump off a cliff to impress to her. Celine took to these changes like a cat to water. She was angry and aggressive. Anyone that looked at her too long was putting their life at risk. She spent half of May in detention for putting a seventh year Ravenclaw in the hospital wing after he whistled at her between classes.  </p><p>            And now, here she is, on the biggest day of her life, abandoned by the person whose fault it is she is in this situation in the first place.</p><p>“Come on.” I said, wishing the anxiety I felt didn’t come out in my voice. I leaned towards her and hooked her under her arms, pulling her to her feet. I needed to get her out of here, away from the hurt. My brain scrambled for ideas on where to go. The Leaky Cauldron, my house, Hogwarts, Uncle Alphard’s, Australia…all had their merits.</p><p>“Cookie, pack her a bag.” The elf hurried to do as I asked. Her head was on my shoulder and I could feel the venom creeping into my brain. I took a deep breath in and imagined I was blowing all the poison out of my nose.</p><p>“We’re Ok Celine, I’m gonna get you out of here.”  I said, rubbing her back. <em>Where to go! Think you daft idiot!</em> I berated myself as I looked out her kitchen window, trying to come up with a solution while fighting off the goofy feeling the venom gives. There was a vase full of lilies on the kitchen counter. <em>‘Celine is lovely like a lily’</em> my idiot boy brain helpfully chimed in.</p><p>LILY.</p><p>We would go to Lily’s.</p><p>Crap. Bugger. Fucking MUGGLES.</p><p>Lily doesn’t have a floo.</p><p>Severus has a floo.</p><p>I physically shook that thought out of my head. There was no way I would floo to Severus Snape’s house.</p><p>Cookie came back with Celine’s bag.</p><p>“Ok Celine, we’re gonna go to Lily’s ok.” I took my coat off and slung it around her shoulders. “I’m gonna get us there and we’re gonna be ok.” I picked up her bag in one hand and wrapped the other around her shoulders. She didn’t say anything. Her tears had slowed. I led her outside and the screen door snapped behind us. At the end of the drive I stuck my arm out and the Knight Bus came screeching to a halt just short of our toes. My heart was hammering in my throat but, Celine was unfazed. I handed her bag to the footman and helped Celine to her seat. I rushed back and paid the driver.</p><p>“You kids alright?” He asked, taking the money from my shaking hands.</p><p>“Yea, yea we’re alright.” I lied.</p><p>I joined Celine in the seat and she leaned her body against mine. I took another deep breath in and out through my nose as she rested her head against my neck and slid her arm around the small of my back. A fresh wave of tears soaked the collar of my shirt and her ragged breaths stung my chest through my thin T shirt.</p><p>“Shhhh” I tried to soothe. I started wondering if maybe something worse had happened to Celine. I squeezed her shoulder reassuringly and the arm around my waist hugged me back. We waited for our stop, holding each other and barely noticing the craziness that is a ride on the Knight bus. Somewhere on the journey our fingers laced together and I was feeling pensive. I thought about all the times Celine and I have saved each other from our families and ourselves. I thought about how Celine and I have never touched like this and something in me wanted to savor every second of it in case it never happened again. I hoped it was the non-poisoned part of my brain that felt that way.</p><p>Too long of a time later we arrived at what I could only assume was Lily’s house. Celine didn’t say anything to the contrary so, we started up the drive, she was still nestled close under my arm. I let go to ring the bell and she stood up a little straighter. The other Evans answered the door. She stared at Celine through narrowed eyes and Celine stared right back.</p><p>“Who invited you here” she spat.</p><p>“Your mother.” Celine whipped back.</p><p>“Petunia who is it dear?” A woman called from in the house.</p><p>“No one mum!” Petunia called making to slam the door in our faces. Celine threw her arm up so fast to catch the door both Petunia and I jumped.</p><p>“Get Lily” Celine breathed, her fingernails sank deep into the wood of the door. Petunia surrendered</p><p>“HEY FREAK!” She shrieked into the house, turning her back to us. “YOUR FREAK FRIENDS ARE HERE!”</p><p>  Lily’s footsteps came quick and loud and a second later her much more welcome face appeared in the doorway, confusion and excitement changed to worry and concern as Celine threw herself into Lily’s arms and began sobbing again. The two girls hugged each other hard. Lily’s eyes found mine. I shrugged.</p><p> She cooed to Celine and waved me in the door. I followed the girls into the kitchen where Mr. and Mrs. Evans were puttering, finishing up the lunch dishes and wiping counters.</p><p>“Celine!” Mrs. Evans cried. “Are you alright?!”</p><p>Celine wiped her tears and shook her head no. Mr. Evans waved me over to the table and I heeded his call.</p><p>“Best let the birds handle this one.” He said holding out his hand. I shook it and said “Sirius Black, sir.”</p><p>“Ahh the best friend of the infamous James Potter?”</p><p>“The one and only.”</p><p>Mrs. Evans ushered the girls from the kitchen.</p><p>“Is Celine in trouble?” He asked.</p><p>“I don’t think so.” I wondered how much the Evans’ knew about Celine’s home life. About what she is.</p><p>“That mother of hers?” Mr. Evans asked, a deep frown creasing his mouth.</p><p>I nodded and leaned back in my chair.</p><p>“You were right to bring her here son.”</p><p>I let my chair fall back to the ground.</p><p>“Today is Celine’s birthday, her sixteenth birthday.”</p><p>“Is it now?” Mr. Evans said, scratching his chin. “I guess Mrs. Evans will have to bake a cake then and, if we’re having cake, we mind as well have a few more party guests, wouldn’t you say?”</p><p>I thanked him and ran out the door.</p><p>
  <strong>CELINE</strong>
</p><p>“What if she never comes home? What if she’s really left?” I was immersed in hot bath water in the Evans’ blue bathroom. Thick soapy bubbles coated the surface of the water and tickled my chin. Lily had her leg up on the edge of the tub and was painting her nails while she listened to my sorry life story.</p><p>“Are we mad about that?” She quipped. We laughed and I blew bubbles her way. “What kind of a state did Sirius find you in? He looked a wreck.”</p><p>“Crying on the kitchen floor with no one but Cookie.”</p><p>“ahhh.”</p><p>“She’s been talking about this birthday all year. It doesn’t make sense.”</p><p>Lily shrugged and screwed the cap back on the polish. “You’re here now.” She said quietly, smiling warmly.</p><p>“I’m here now.” I agreed. She left me to my thoughts and I stayed in the water a long time.</p><p>When I finally emerged from the bath I dressed in Lily’s room. Cookie packed my bag perfectly and my heart overflowed for that darling elf as I pulled on my favorite shorts and softest white tee. Out of habit, I picked up my brush and turned to the mirror but quickly turned around. Lately, my reflection showed the Veela and the Veela liked to preen. My stomach growled for what felt like the first time all month and I smiled.</p><p>A shriek from Lily sounded throughout the house and my heart hammered with excitement. I know that shriek! It’s the sound Lily makes when she’s about to throttle James! I ran down the stairs two at a time and bounded into the kitchen. Laid out before me was a tableful of sandwiches and chips and a simple birthday cake with the numbers 1-6 on top. To make this vision complete all four marauders and Lily were gathered around the table.</p><p>“Happy Birthday!” They cheered.</p><p>“How’d you all get here!” I asked through the crushing hugs.</p><p>“Sirius yanked us out of our beds.”</p><p>“It was 1 o’clock James!” Remus said.</p><p>“Exactly!” James answered, unfazed.</p><p>“Did you all take the Knight bus too?”</p><p>“Remus and I did.” Peter said. “Sirius picked James up on that <em>thing</em>.” He shuddered.</p><p>“She’s not a thing Pete!” Sirius barked.</p><p>“What or who is it?” I demanded.</p><p>“My motorcycle.”</p><p>“His <em>flying </em>motorcycle.” James corrected.</p><p>“Take me for a ride!” I asked turning to Sirius.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Don’t make me plead, I’m quite convincing nowadays.”</p><p>“Later, later let’s eat.” He reasoned, pointedly turning away from me and my tricks. I wished I hadn’t said anything.</p><p>I sat next to Lily at the table and gloried in the chaos that is eating a meal with the marauders. Peter was sat between Lily and James which was both an excellent choice and a bad one. Excellent because it kept James alive. Poor, because he was caught in the middle. Remus was to my left and his energy rolling up my spine was messing with the Veela. Memories of private moments with him kept bubbling to the surface. Thoughts of his hands holding me tight to him and the feel of his lips made my heart race and my breath hitch and the Veela reminded me:</p><p>
  <em>‘if you want him, take him.’</em>
</p><p>I pushed her down, hard. There would be none of that. Sirius was directly across from me. I felt him watching me and when our eyes met he smiled. I matched his grin and my heartrate sped up again.</p><p>We laughed, oh Godric Gryffindor did we laugh. Being with the five of them was how I always imagined having family would be like. Cousins who you couldn’t wait to see every holiday, siblings who pinched and teased and put rocks in your shoes but, went to bat for you every time anyway. The people who knew your every flaw, every sour mood, and loved you still, that’s what they felt like. I didn’t know it yet but, over the next few years the people surrounding me on my 16<sup>th</sup> birthday would shape my entire adult life.</p><p>“Sirius let me drive the bike.” I said, walking over to the window and looking for it in the driveway.</p><p>“Absolutely not.” </p><p>“You let your girlfriend on it.”  </p><p>“James isn’t my girlfriend and I let him ride it not drive it.”</p><p>“Does James always ride it?” Lily asked quirking a devilish eyebrow.</p><p>James turned red and began stuttering.</p><p>“She never said James was your girlfriend.” Peter pointed out.</p><p>Sirius leaned back in his chair and I could feel his eyes slide over my body.</p><p>“Do you guys remember when Celine only wore parka’s?”</p><p>Peter and James laughed and while he was distracted by his audience I slipped out the front door. The bike was in the driveway, high sloping handlebars, chrome lovingly polished, leather oiled, keys left in the ignition by her cocky owner. I hopped on and kicked her into life.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>SIRIUS</strong>
</p><p>I heard the engine roar and I actually looked around the room for that she-devil before I moved because I really couldn’t believe she had duped me. I scrambled to my feet feeling like Padfoot when he tries to run too fast on tile and bounded out the front door.  I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw her. She was actually on my bike, looking at me with adventure in her eyes. I wanted to fix this image in my memory forever. Celine, daring me to come and make her get off my bike, platinum locks blowing in the wind, long legs strong and bare. Years later, I would look back on this June day and think to myself ‘I think I loved her then.’</p><p>She revved the engine and I snapped out of it.</p><p>“Celine!” I yelled, ordered, begged.</p><p>She hit the gas and held up a peace sign, legs kicked out on either side. I ran after her and just managed to hop on the back as the tires left the pavement and the bike soared into the air. I slid into place behind her and relished the feel of our hips fitting so closely together. I got a mouthful of her hair and struggled to spit it out. I grabbed the handlebars and she let go. Immediately, She held her hands out like a bird and let out another whoop. I couldn’t see her face but I imagined she had her eyes closed and a smile on her lips. With a stretch to the heavens she settled back quickly and unexpectedly against me. Her shoulders leaned against mine and our cheeks just brushed and it was somewhere up here, towing the line between friends and more than friends, that I felt peace for the first time, in a long time.</p><p>“Let’s keep going all the way to Australia!” She yelled.</p><p>“Australia’s the other way!”</p><p>“Turn around then!” She laughed.</p><p>  I took us back to the Evans’ instead. We entered the house windswept and smiling and Mrs. Evans dimmed the lights while Lily lit the candles. We sang happy birthday to a radiantly happy Celine. I thought the morning seemed like a different lifetime. I watched her close her eyes and make a wish and just as she blew out the candles, her mother apparated into the room.</p><p>“Ah, shit.” James swore.</p><p>“Celine! I have been waiting for you all day!” She trilled, swooping in on Celine and fussing over her.</p><p>Hot, angry, bubbles popped in my gut.</p><p>“You weren’t home so I left.” Celine stated.</p><p>“It’s your birthday darling, I was coming.”</p><p>“You haven’t been home at all, how was I to know.”</p><p>Edahna said nothing and greeted us all, the chilly response did not go unnoticed.</p><p>“Really, what has gotten into you all?” Edahna asked. Without waiting for an answer she continued “Celine, it’s time to go home.”</p><p>“No.” Celine said. “I’m not going home, I’m going to stay here with the Evans’, this way I don’t have to be alone.”</p><p>“You won’t be alone, I’ll be there.”</p><p>Celine said nothing. After a minute of silence and staring between Celine and Edahna, Celine got to her feet and began thanking the Evans’ for the party. My friends protested. I was shocked into silence. Was Celine seriously believing that her mother would be home with her this summer?! She hugged me goodbye last.</p><p>“Thank you for everything.” She whispered in my ear. She turned away from me, snapped her fingers, and was gone. Edahna did the same, leaving a faint gold shimmer and five teenagers with very long faces, behind.</p><p>That was the last we heard or saw of Celine for the rest of the summer.</p>
