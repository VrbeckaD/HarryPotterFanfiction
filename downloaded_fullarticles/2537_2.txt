<p>"Yeah, right."</p>
<p>"Just watch."</p>
<p>"What are you up to?"</p>
<p>"Me? You're the one who manhandled me, not that I'm complaining, into a broomstick cupboard, again not complaining, but people will talk, Evans."</p>
<p>"You seriously don't know? And if you make a Sirius joke I'll .. use this on you."</p>
<p>"Decapatating me with a bog roll aside, I honestly don't know what I've done. I haven't asked you out at all this year so that can't be what's got your wand in a knot."</p>
<p>"That's the problem."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i> You want me .. "</p>
<p>"To ask me out, yes, because I've only gone and done it."</p>
<p>"What - "</p>

<p>"You kissed me, does that mean you love me again?"</p>
<p>"I never stopped."</p>

<p>"I can't believe - fine. Will you go out with me?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"<i>What!</i> You - "</p>
<p>"Ask me again tomorrow, maybe I'll say yes."</p>
<p>"<i><b>You prat!</b></i> <i>James Potter get back here and go out with me!</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Help, a mad woman is chasing me with toilet roll!</i>"</p>
<p>"I can't believe it, you were right."</p>
<p>'I know women, Moony."</p>
<p>"As your boyfriend should I be worried Padfoot?"</p>
<p>"Definitely not."</p></div>
