  <strong>April 2004</strong>
</p>
<p>Hermione was crying when she heard banging on the front door. It should have startled her, but it didn’t, it was only Ron, after all. She knew, because it came in three giant, sloppy knocks-- the first to make sure she knew he was there, the second to make sure she knew he was strong, and the third, well, just because he was drunk. He was one sip of fire whiskey away from throwing his shoulder into the hinges and tumbling in.</p>
<p>She hurried to swipe the tears away from her cheeks before remembering he often didn’t notice or maybe even care that she had been crying. By the sound of it, she could have flooded the house with her tears, and he would have simply waded through them and gone to bed. Hermione sniffed, raising her aching body from the bathroom floor with the familiar sense of obligation. Even if she felt like leaving him out there until he finally passed out in the rose bushes they had planted together, she couldn’t-- not after what just happened. His anger at the whole, wide world was almost tangible, and even though she was angry too, she was more frightened of what he might get himself into because of it.</p>
<p>“Too drunk for a little unlocking charm or did you simply forget that you’re a wizard with a fully functioning wand?” she swung open the door, shifting to the side as he stumbled over the threshold, “Ugh! You <em>reek</em>! Would it kill you to say no just once when they offer?”</p>
<p>Ron straightened up with a little sardonic sound that could have been classified as a laugh if it hadn’t come out so slurred,</p>
<p>“It’s not every day you get to see a real life, living, breathing war hero, Hermione.” his hand came down hard onto her shoulder, “Sometimes, you’ve just gotta give the people what they want.”</p>
<p>“How very gracious of you,” she shook his hand away, casting a quick glance outside for any onlookers, “You said you’d be right back, Ron.”</p>
<p>“Well,” he hiccuped, “I would have done but I stopped in at mum’s.”</p>
<p>She slammed the door, swiftly turning back around to face him with a short laugh, “You can’t honestly expect me to believe that<em> your mother</em> is responsible for this.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I fucking do because she is.”</p>
<p>Hermione flinched-- not even the warm embrace of fire whiskey couldn’t soothe him of his fury. She drew a slow, bracing breath, pulling her robe in closer to her chest. It was in her experience that when Ron acted like a child, he fully intended on being treated like one.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“I went to see mum,” he began, his voice wavering, “to tell that you lost the baby--again.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“<em>And?</em> And nothing, Hermione,”he spit, “She didn’t have anything to say to me besides maybe this all has something to do with the fact that I'm a worthless, waste of space that isn’t meant to reproduce!”</p>
<p>“She didn’t say that, Ron.”</p>
<p>“Well, I know she was thinking it!” he seethed, “I’m so sick of her looking at me like <em>that.</em>”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“Like I’m the worst mistake she ever made. Like she wishes I was the one who went got themselves killed.”</p>
<p>“<em>Oh really,</em> Ron?” Hermione sighed, unable to hide her annoyance, “How could you ever think that? Your mother loves you. She loves you more than anything and of course, she misses Fred but she doesn’t wish you were dead instead. I am so tired of hearing it. You always think that someone is disappointed in you. Do you ever think that maybe it’s because you’re so disappointed in your---”</p>
<p>“--Can you stop trying to diagnosis me for like five seconds?” he snapped, “Why don’t you take a look at yourself, Hermione? Don’t you think this whole thing has something to do with you? Maybe I’d be less disappointed if you’d stop bleeding out chunks of our children!”</p>
<p>Hearmione’s breath caught in her throat. He couldn’t have hurt her more if he had summoned a butchers knife from the kitchen and driven it straight through her heart. For a moment, she wished he would have, that way she wouldn’t have to live with the scar he had just ruthlessly lashed into her soul. She felt like taking off into the dark, raw night and letting the cold encompass her into sweet oblivion so that she never had to look herself in the face again. But she didn’t, Hermione wouldn’t have been Hermione if she did. She hardly ever let someone know that they had shaken her own confidence in herself and even Ron’s bullets of words couldn’t make her back down.</p>
<p>
  <em>“I’m sorry?”</em>
</p>
<p>“You heard me.”</p>
<p>“No, I want you to say it again.” she demanded, “I want to make sure we’re clear on this.”</p>
<p>He started to walk away with a dismissive wave of his hand,</p>
<p>“I really don’t want to do this with you right now…”</p>
<p>“You’re not walking away this time,” she lurched for his arm, yanking him backwards, “just go on and say what you want to say!”</p>
<p>He jerked his arm out of her hand,</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll say it.” his whole face had gone a new shade of red, “It’s you!<em> It’s all your fault.</em> That spiritual healing, herbal, smoke up the ass midwife is<em> bullshit,</em> and you know it! You’re lying to yourself, Hermione, you can’t have a baby and why would you even want to? You’re just hurting both of us.” he threw up four fingers and shoved them in her face, “Four times, Hermione, four times-- what am I supposed to think? It’s not working. You’re not working. This whole damn thing isn’t working.”</p>
<p>She felt the heat rise to her cheeks , “So, you think I’m the one that’s broken?”</p>
<p>“I think my family’s never had any trouble having babies.”</p>
<p>Once again she took his words like a shot to the chest-- new wounds that made her even more dangerous.</p>
<p>“No. No, of course you’re right Ron, your family never had any trouble having them, just trouble when it came to keeping them all fed!”</p>
<p>Ron’s face dropped. It was as if some unseen force had snapped its fingers and rendered him into silent stone. Hermione could hear her own, ashamed heartbeat pounding in her head over the silence. Even after all the nasty things he had said to her, the words that had just passed through her lips left a horribly bitter taste in her mouth.</p>
<p>“You know,” he began in a tone so hallow she wished he’d scream, “for the brightest witch of your age you sure never learned when to shut the fuck up.”</p>
<p>“Apparently I never learned a lot of things, otherwise I would have stayed clear of you!”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s brilliant, Hermione, it really is.” the sting in his voice returned, “Now you’re going to pretend that I’m the one trying to spiritually call a baby into my uterus to save our marriage. Well, trust me if I was it wouldn’t be with you. I’m done!”</p>
<p>For a moment, Hermione was rendered speechless. She stood there and just stared like her brain had overheated and sparked a fire. The simple word had lost all meaning. She no longer understood it.</p>
<p>“You’re done?” she repeated at length, hot anger spreading through her veins like wildfire. She shoved him hard up against the wall, “<em>You</em> don’t get to be done.”</p>
<p>Ron pushed her back, “I can’t do this anymore!”</p>
<p>“Do what? What are you doing, Ron?” she pounded his chest again, tears now leaking from her eyes “Our baby was literally oozing out of me three hours ago and you went out drinking instead of staying here with me.”</p>
<p>He took her by the shoulders, partly to keep her from hitting him, partly to shake them,</p>
<p>“I can’t even <em>look</em> at you anymore, Hermione!” he rattled her whole body, “Don’t you see? We’ve done this too many times before. It hurts me too much to see you like this!”</p>
<p>“That’s not an excuse.”</p>
<p>“I'm not even saying it is!”</p>
<p>“Then what are you saying, Ron?” she sobbed, “That after everything, after all we’ve been through, you’re done just like that? You don’t love me anymore?”</p>
<p>She dropped her shoulders and slid down the wall to the floor, burying her face in her hands.</p>
<p>“I never said I don’t love you.” said Ron, coming to sit beside her. He leaned his head against the wall and sighed, “Nothing fits. You can’t think this is working either, ‘Mione.”</p>
<p>They sat there in thick silence. Sadness and anger rushed her like a tidal wave that quickly receded back out to sea and then she felt nothing-- compete, still emptiness, which was almost worse.</p>
<p>“You know what I think.” she said finally, refusing to look anywhere near his direction, “I think you’re angry, Ron, and I think you’re sick. You hate the things we did to survive, you hate the way people look at you because you know they’re thinking about who you lost, who you hurt, who you killed. You can’t stand to be seen with me because they stare at us like we’re some kind of tourist attraction and you resent the fact that things will never,<em> ever</em> be the same. All your life all you wanted to be a hero but you never realized the price to be paid until you became one. And all these miscarriages serve as a reminder that you can be all the hero you want, but you’re still just a man, and what you thought you wanted is actually everything you didn’t. It’s the biggest disappointment of you life to finally be what you always wanted to become.” Hermione rose to her feet, “I was right here when you realized it. I saw you change and now I’m the person you associate with that disappointment. So the cycle continues, and there’s no way to stop everyone from watching it happen.”</p>
<p>The muscle at the base of Ron’s jaw flinched, his eyes stayed fixed on the floor.</p>
<p>“I’ve finally realized something, Ron-- war never really ends for those closest to it, the style of fighting just changes.” she said, “We were silly to think otherwise and get married so soon after, and I know that’s my fault, but your behavior isn’t so stop blaming me for it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go call that bullshit midwife and tomorrow probably a lawyer.”</p>
