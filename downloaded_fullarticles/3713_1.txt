    <p>Draco inhaled a deep breath and let it out slowly, for all appearances looking completely aloof and in control. He leaned against the wall of the train station as he waited, examining the nails on his left hand as he considered how he had come to be here at this very moment – waiting to meet his parents at the end of his fifth year at Hogwarts with a large black Newfoundland sitting at his feet. </p><p>Really, Draco thought, he was quite lucky to have gotten through the second half of the school year without somebody discovering that he was buggering the boy wonder. Draco hummed softly to himself, the corners of his mouth twitching up ever so slightly as he recalled how Harry had sucked his cock so well and allowed Draco to deep throat him for so long that he had lost consciousness. Draco had pulled himself off, splattering his come over the unconscious boy at his feet. </p><p>He knew Harry didn’t like it when Draco fucked him roughly, but Draco couldn’t be arsed about that. Harry did what Draco wanted him to; he deferred to Draco in everything. Draco had thoroughly enjoyed reconstructing the boy’s view of the world. With the initial encouragement from that potion Severus had given Potter in an effort to teach the idiot occlumency, Harry’s need to be with Draco had only grown stronger over time. </p><p>So what if Draco had stolen a vial or two of that same potion to dose Potter with in the months that had followed. Potter was his, and that is all Draco had ever really wanted. Under Draco’s careful hand, he had worked Potter into the firm belief that Draco was the answer to all of his problems. The fact that Draco was also the source of most of those problems was beside the point. </p><p>Draco shuddered deliciously, his cock swelling slowly as he recalled the things he had been able to accomplish. It had taken all of Draco’s cunning to drive Potter away from the Mudblood and Weasel. He had persevered in filling Potter’s head full of doubts and ended up convincing him that Dumbledore was paying the two to be friends with him – to spy on him so Dumbledore would always know what he was up to. He had enjoyed watching the heated arguments from a distance, continuing to whisper small lies in Harry’s ear while he fucked him, planting seeds of doubt that had borne plenty of fruit. </p><p>As Potter had become more distant from his friends in Gryffindor, Draco had worked tirelessly to convince Harry that Draco was the only person he could rely on. And just as Draco said it, Harry believed it. Harry lived in constant fear of incurring Draco’s displeasure, for when Draco was displeased, Harry was punished spectacularly. </p><p>Draco would fuck Harry for hours and hours and refuse to let the boy come, he’d make the boy lick his own come off the floor, he’d hit him, bind him, and refuse to give him food. But Harry lived for the moments when Draco’s anger had passed, when he would whisper of his unending love in Harry’s ear, when he would hold him gently, fuck him sweetly, when he promised that all of the bad moments would help Harry learn to be better, and when he promised he’d always keep Harry safe and loved.</p><p>Harry did not doubt that Draco loved him, and he believed whole heartedly that he deserved the punishments Draco gave him. He submitted beautifully, to the point that he would seek out Draco’s permission before doing anything at all. He had told Draco all of his secrets, all of his hopes, and desires. </p><p>So Draco was rather bemused by the fact that he had agreed with Harry’s begging only the day before. It was about a month into their clandestine relationship that Harry had told Draco that he was an unregistered Animagus. Just like his godfather, Harry turned into a large, hairy, black dog. Draco had never seen the breed before, but Harry’s animal form was just about as large as Draco was himself. </p><p>Draco spared a glance for the dog, panting contentedly at his feet. He reached out and scratched behind his ears, earning him a pleased whine as Harry pushed into his fingers. Draco traced his fingers through Harry’s fur, still rather amused that it looks as big a fucking mess as the boy’s hair always did. But just as with Harry’s actual hair, it was deceptively silky to the touch. </p><p>Draco scratched Harry’s ears some more as his mind wandered to the one question he hadn’t been able to figure out an answer to. Why did Harry want to spend the summer holiday with Draco? Harry knew the Dark Lord was living in the manor. It was a reckless move, even for the Gryffindor, but Draco had found himself agreeing nonetheless. He didn’t want to spend so much time away from Harry, but he had put his foot down in regard to one thing. </p><p>Harry was going to spend the entire holiday as a dog. Draco brushed a finger lightly over the gem encrusted collar that encircled Harry’s neck. It was black leather that was studded with glittering emeralds and diamonds, that held several strong enchantments, keeping them hidden within their glittering facets. </p><p>The collar was enchanted to prevent Harry from changing into his human form. So long as he wore that collar, he would remain a dog, preventing any accidental sightings if Harry were to slip up over the summer, something Draco had been unwilling to risk. And that was all Draco had told Harry about it. Harry himself was unaware that Draco was the only person who would be able to remove the collar from his neck, that it had a binding charm placed upon it, ensuring that Harry wouldn’t be able to be more than several hundred paces away from him at any given time, but most importantly, Draco had worked a compulsion into the leather. The wearer of the collar would be compelled to follow any command given by Draco – regardless of Harry’s feelings on the matter. </p><p>Draco had made excellent progress with Harry’s obedience over the past months, but he didn’t want to put that to the test in a house full of Death Eaters and the Dark Lord. One misstep could result in their immediate death. Besides, it rather turned Draco on knowing Harry would do exactly what he said, when he said it. Draco fingered the small pendant hanging of the collar which read Ophiuchus.</p><p>Keeping with the Black family traditions for naming, Draco had decided to call him Ophiuchus. The fact that the token Gryffindor was now renamed after a serpent constellation was of an endless amount of amusement to Draco. Harry had been oddly silent about it, but Draco hadn’t missed the slightly pained expression that crossed his face when Draco had given him a new name that was befitting of a Malfoy pet. </p><p>“Draco.” </p><p>Draco glanced up to find his mother staring at the large dog at his feet, which had started growling softly as his mother had approached. </p><p>“Ophi, <i>no<i>.” The stern tone of Draco’s command had the dog flopping down on his belly and staring up at the pair balefully. </i></i></p><p>
  <i>
    <i>“A… dog… Draco?” Narcissa’s eyes flicked to her son worriedly.</i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>Draco stepped forward and kissed her cheek softly. “Mother this is Ophiuchus. I was doing extra study for transfiguration when I came across some old information about familiars. Decided it would do well to get some extra credit and put the magic to the test. It has been wildly successful. Ophiuchus here has strong natural magic and is rather insanely protective of me.”</i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>As if to undermine the ferocity Draco wished his mother to see, Ophi rolled onto his back, his tongue lolling out of his mouth. Draco scowled and barked out, “Ophiuchus. Guard.”</i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>Faster than Narcissa could blink, the dog was on his feet, his fur bristling with tension as he bared his teeth at the nearest people to them – which happened to be a Hufflepuff first year and her parents. The girl caught sight of Ophi and squeaked before towing her parents away quickly.</i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>Narcissa stared down at the dog in curious wonder for a moment. “Well,” she began, “You seem to have done a wonderful job with him.” She reached down, her fingers stroking a soft caress of the dogs ears. Her eyes darted around them, checking that nobody was close by. “And it may well due you good to have some extra protection this summer.”</i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>At that Draco’s eyes snapped to his mother’s face, noting the dark shadows under her eyes and the somewhat unhealthy pallor of her skin. He opened his mouth to speak, but was shushed by his mother. “Let us just say that the Potter brat was able to avoid the trap the Dark Lord had been assured would work to get him what he wanted.” Draco felt the warm caress of his mother’s fingers across his cheek. “He hasn’t been overly happy with your Father, as it was your Father’s tip that indicated the plan would work in the first place.”</i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>Draco shivered and glanced down at Ophi, wondering just what sort of dangerous mess they had landed themselves in. </i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i> </i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>The moment he returned home, Draco vanished into his rooms, Ophi trotting along behind him, sniffing everything they passed. One he had reached the safety of his rooms, Draco locked the door behind him and flung himself onto his bed with a sigh. He draped an arm over his eyes as he pondered the many warnings his mother had given him on their trip to the manor. </i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>A niggling of dread had worked its way into his stomach and Draco was sure it wouldn’t be going anywhere, anytime soon. </i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>A moment later he heard the soft pad of feet as Ophi come and nestled his huge head right up against Draco’s crotch. Draco twitched slightly as Ophi snuffled and nuzzled against his trouser clad prick. Draco sighed comfortably as his cock filled, until it was straining painfully against the fabric, rising to meet the snout that was snuffling it with increasing interest. </i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>Draco pushed Ophi’s head away before he eased down the front of his trousers and pushed them down, along with his pants, letting his cock spring free. He and Ophi both stared at it, flushed an angry red and standing at attention in the cool air, demanding it be dealt with. </i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>Draco allowed his head to drop back as he brought his hand up to fist himself.  He pulled himself slowly, enjoying the tension that began coiling low in his belly. He had pulled his fist over himself a mere three times before a wet rasp had him gasping and his hand flying away in shock. Ophi had crept closer once more and had licked a stripe from Draco’s balls to his crown. He leveraged himself up on his elbows and watched, panting at the sensations as Ophi began lapping at his straining cock. </i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>They had never done something like this before and Draco found himself moaning softly at the sensation. Potter’s tongue was just so <i>long<i> when he was a dog, and it wrapped curiously around Draco’s cock, in a way he’d never experienced before. </i></i></i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>
      <i>
        <i>The feeling of Ophi’s tongue dragging across his slit had Draco panting softly, his eyes tracking every movement of the pink muscle across his prick. His hips jerked spasmodically as Ophi slowly drew his tongue up from Draco’s balls to circle pleasantly around his shaft. </i>
      </i>
    </i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>
      <i>
        <i>Ophi lapped up the pre-come that oozed from Draco’s prick as though it was the only thing keeping him alive. His tongue was doing wonderful things to his cock and Draco dug his fingers into the soft fur on Potter’s head, determined to enjoy this odd pleasure while it lasted. He wondered idly why he hadn’t thought to do more with Potter in his animagus form. His balls drew up tightly and he gripped the base of his shaft quickly to stave off orgasm, not wanting this to be over yet. </i>
      </i>
    </i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>
      <i>
        <i>Ophi growled as Draco squeezed his cock and seemed to renew his efforts to stimulate him until in no time at all, Draco was spurting come in stick ropes that were quickly vanished with a few efficient passes of Ophi’s tongue. The dog seemed to grin lazily at Draco, his tongue lolling out of his mouth while Draco caught his breath, staring at the large beast before him. </i>
      </i>
    </i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>
      <i>
        <i>“Fuck.” Draco flopped back on the bed feeling boneless. Well that was certainly one way to relax in an uncomfortable situation. The bed dipped beside him as Ophi leapt up. Draco caught sight of a red cock peeking out of his sheath and shuddered as Ophi settled down with his massive head on Draco’s stomach. </i>
      </i>
    </i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>
      <i>
        <i>Draco stroked the large head, thinking that this was going to be a frustrating summer for Potter, because there was no way in hell he was getting him off while he was a <i>dog<i>, but he was now quite sure that they were going to have quite a few repeats of Ophi licking him dry. He wondered if he could get the dog to eat out his arse, as well. That tongue could prove very interesting, now that Draco was giving it some thought. </i></i></i>
      </i>
    </i>
  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>
    <i>
      <i>
        <i>
          <i>
            <i>The pair dozed pleasantly until there was a rapid knock at the door. The only thing keeping Draco from sitting bolt upright was the weight of Ophi’s head on his chest. <i>Merline<i>. Draco was sure Ophi weighted more than he did. He shoved the dog off and quickly stood, quickly pulling up his pants and trousers before going to answer the door. </i></i></i>

                <i>“Come, Draco. We are being summoned to a meeting and the Dark Lord has insisted that you be there as well.”</i>

                <i>Draco froze. The Dark Lord had never allowed him to be in any of the meetings that were held here. He wasn’t a marked Death Eater, for one, and he was barely sixteen, for another. A cool mask of indifference slipped onto his face and he squared his shoulders. A snap of his fingers had Ophi trotting to his side. The dog looked up at Draco with it’s huge green eyes and let out a soft, nervous whine. </i>

                <i>Ten minutes later found Draco sitting at their formal dining table, his seat securely between that of his parents. Ophi was beneath the table, his large head in Draco’s lap. Draco’s fingers toyed with the dog’s ears and he was nervous enough that he didn’t even grimace at the slowly growing wet spot on his leg that Ophi’s drool was creating. </i>

His Aunt Bellatrix was sitting up near the head of the table, Crabbe’s and Goyle’s fathers, Nott’s father, McNair – who was a friend of his fathers, and a multitude of people he didn’t know by name, but by sight. </i>

As you know, female wolves are uncommon. They usually cannot hold up to the strain of the change, which means any additions to the pack must come as a result of turning verses breeding. But we have found a spell,” He shuddered visibly in delight, “That, when cast upon a male, will allow them to be bred and whelped. Pups that are bred are hardier and more vicious than those that are turned. They make wonderful additions to any pack, though the lack of females make them very uncommon.”</i>
