    <p>
  <span>Winter had arrived quickly since the start of term. Unlike the other eighth years, those who had come back willingly or, sitting their special accommodated rooms, Pansy relished the dark; the cold blistering wind swirling until is settled into a wonderland of snow, all snug over layers of clothing. Pansy walked down the dim-lit corridor, hunched to one side with her house scarf loosely flailing around her neck and a gloved covered hand wrapped under her arm, using it as something to brace her arm on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Today however, Pansy had no patience to curl up on a window ledge and look out into the white wilderness. Her current destination was the hospital wing. Ever since the start of the school year Pansy had been the target of jinxes on numerous occasions, mainly whenever a professor's back was turned. Usually, Pansy would hide inside a broom closet until the effects wore off, which meant missing classes. The professors weren’t very helpful, every missed class was just more house points lost, they did nothing to conceal their indifference - why would they help, she tried to sell out their poster boy. To many in Hogwarts and British Wizarding society she was still the enemy, not someone who was by a child herself during the recent war. The last few days students had escalated to more harmful uses of magic, which was why she was holding a broken arm and shoulder. She turned a corner before hearing some students up ahead. She quickly moved behind a statue, biting her lip when her shoulder jolted against the wall, pain searing through her finger tips and along her neck. She quietly whimpered once the students left the corridor and slowly stepped out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Parkinson.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pansy’s eyes darted to the dark space the noise came from. “Granger?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All of Hogwarts had assumed that Hermione Granger would come back the same person she always was before the war, or at least go back to how she was - their favourite know-it-all gryffindor who loved to stick to the rules - one third of the golden trio who had decided to return for her studies with the intent of being head girl. Granger had declined the position.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With nobody, not even the other slytherins wanting to associate with her, Pansy had a lot of time to people watch when she wasn’t avoiding hexes from her way. Sometimes Pansy wished to have her friends back, not those she had to associate with purely on family reputation and social circles, but friends where she could in private drop the etiquette pureblood high society facade. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Granger seemed to keep to herself, not in full isolation, but the times Pansy did watch her, she felt that Granger didn’t really want to be back at Hogwarts at all. It was two weeks into the school year before people stopped walking up to Granger when they received no response, they still watched and whispered to each other in awe, but no one wanted to walk up to the girl who had come back as if a soldier. Pansy watched Granger come out from the shadows and folded her arms, leaning against the wall with one leg behind the other; clad in a crisp trousered uniform and laced shoes - top button up and tie not a millimeter out of place, wild bushy hair now loose curls tucked in a low ponytail, her once signature bag now replaced by a backpack hanging on one shoulder. She appeared taller even with her body learnt to one side, maybe a handful of inches. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Granger’s eyes scanned her body before they rested on the arm she was hiding inside her robes. “Who broke it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Doesn’t matter..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was silence, brown eyes staring into her own before Granger lifted off the wall and inched towards her. Pansy watched, blinking at the wetness blurring her vision - she had only ever cried in front of one person on he wasn’t even in school. She saw Granger’s hand rise towards her and she unwillingly flinched. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Granger paused, her lips forming a straight line, before retreating her hand and softly said, “come on.” She then started to walk in the direction of the hospital wing. Pansy followed Granger down the corridor, looking to the ground when Granger opened the hospital wing door to let her injured self past. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Madam Pomfrey!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What seems to be the matter,” the school healer asked as she bustled over and waved Pansy to a bed. Pansy sat down, flinching slightly as Madam Pomfrey waved her wand over her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I fell over.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Madam Pomfrey sighed as she closed the privacy curtain, “this will hurt”, and helped her out of her robes, jumper and shirt before proceeding to put the bones back into place. For all that she tried, a few tears escaped her eyes. Granger had positioned herself against the end rails of the bed beside them, facing one of the windows. Once the healer was done, she pushed pain relief potion down her throat. “I’ll get you more, they should last until morning, you will wear a sling until I see you before breakfast.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Pansy murmured. Her right arm now wrapped from shoulder to fingers to keep the limb steady. The curtains fluttered as the healer walked out to her store cupboard whilst Pansy redressed. She tried to softly put her jumper on, only half successful as she winced at the dull ache when she tried to lift the bandaged arm into the other sleeve.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you need any help?” Came Grangers voice, sounding closer than she had seen her last.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pansy was going to say no, and leave the jumper off, but it was bloody cold and she just wanted to hide away in her room. “Yeah.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The curtains fluttered again as Granger appeared. Pansy couldn’t help but keep her eyes on Granger, who had her hand gently around her elbow, tight bicep against the side of her arm with the other holding the sleeved hole. Her arm was ever so gently moved until it too covered by her jumper. When she looked up and brown eyes met hers, Grange stood a foot away from hers. That’s when Pansy noticed the faint scar under Grangers bottom lip. “Your shirt, do you want it tucked in?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Wordlessly, Pansy nodded and stood up, inhaling sharply when they were face to face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hold this.” Granger said, holding up the end of her jumper, Pansy took it and lifted it to her torso. Granger pulled down her shirt before turning Pansy around. Pansy stared ahead, focused on the feeling of Grangers hands tucking her shirt inside her skirt, fingertips brushing against her cheeks and hips. A hand then turned her back around to face her and proceeded with the rest. Pansy bit the inside of her cheek knowing where Grangers hands were near. Once she was finished, Granger took back the end of the jumper and pulled it down before grabbing her green trimmed robes, helping her them on before retrieving the sling and put it over her arm, adjusting it to her own acceptance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before Pansy could say thank you, Madam Pomfrey rejoined with two vials of pain relief potion. “Here you are Miss Parkinson, make sure to take it easy with the arm. Now off you go, you don’t want to miss the end of the feast.” Granger was already by the door when Madam Pomfrey dismissed her, holding it open. Keeping her head down, Pansy walked out of the hospital wing aware of Granger’s footsteps behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you’re going to dinner, you’re going in the wrong direction.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pansy stopped but she didn’t turn around. “I’m not hungry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Follow me,” Granger said, and curiously Pansy followed. Granger led them down a number of corridors before stopping in front of a bowl of fruit painting. Confused, Pansy looked at Granger who moved closer and tickled a pear. The painting swung open to reveal a staircase. Granger walked through it, leaving Pansy but to follow behind. Pansy got to the end of the stairs as Granger walked straight to a table in the corner. Looking around at the many house elves hopping around what seemed to be a very large kitchen. “Woah.” Her eyes stopped when they landed back on Granger, who now had a jug, two glasses and plates full of food in front of her. She slowly walked over and sat down. Granger picked up the jug and poured herself some pumpkin juice, then gestured to Pansy’s mug, filling it when she gave a nod. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They didn’t speak at the beginning, though Pansy had a number of questions swimming in her mind. The situation was slightly awkward, but Pansy was sick of being in silence. “So, how did you know about this place?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fourth year, an elf Harry was friends with worked here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What happened to it, to the elf I mean.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Granger paused before cutting up a piece of steak, it was a very slight pause, if Pansy hadn’t spent the whole of seventh year watching her own back she wouldn’t have noticed. “He died, another casualty of the war.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Silence fell again, Pansy looking down at her plate and poking at her own steak, she had forked her way through all of her vegetables. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would you like some help?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pansy looked up at Granger to see her pointing her knife at her plate. “Oh, yes thank you.” Granger moved her own plate to the side, which was now empty, picked at Pansy’s and began cutting the steak up into delicate chunks. She gave Pansy her plate back once she was finished and Pansy took a bite, moaning softly. “Sorry,” she ducked her head when Granger waved her hand. Granger’s plate was once again full and Pansy couldn’t help but ask, “still hungry?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Granger glanced up momentarily, “I found that my appetite since the beginning of the summer grew. I exercise so it’s of no concern to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh no, I wasn’t -,” Pansy flushed, “I wasn’t trying to insinuate anything.” She bit her lip, grimincing in her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Granger’s softly said over her thoughts, “I know, there was no insult.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After finishing her dinner, Pansy took a sip of pumpkin juice. Granger had also finished and asked, “would you like any dessert?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No thank you, I am getting a little tired.”</span>
  <span></span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dipper,” Granger called out and an elf scurried over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes Miss Hermes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for dinner, it was lovely as always.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The elf beamed, her ears flapping as she bounced on her feet. “I make sure to tell the others. Will yous be off now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, my friend is a little tired so I will escort her back to the dorms.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The elf looked at Pansy and clapped her hands together. “Oh yes Miss Hermes yous be a good gentleman.” She then proceeded to shoo them out of their chairs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pansy, though highly confused at the phrase, quickly did as the elf wanted and but before she moved away, she thanked Dipper as well. Granger was already at the door and she avoided the Gryffindors gaze as she walked through the hole. They silently walked through the castle until they arrived at a painting of a field with a horse with a calf grazing at the grass. The horse raised its head, looking at them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Old beginnings.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The horse gave a soft neigh and went back to the grass as the portrait opened. They walked through, luckily no one was in the common room yet. Pansy walked up the stairs and down the corridor to her room. She stopped outside her door, turning to face Granger who hadn’t left. “Thank you, for this evening.” She didn’t know what else to say, fiddling with the sling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome. I’ll be here at 7 tomorrow to take you to Madam Pomfrey.” Granger stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though it was more like a demand, and Granger’s eyes exposed nothing, Pansy felt relief. It was hard being alone, and she rather missed the company of others, those who wanted to be in hers. “I’ll see you tomorrow then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Granger gave a short nod, “good night,” she said softly. Pansy murmured the same before the Gryffindor walked back down the corridor. Once Granger was out of sight, Pansy opened her door and walked through, closing it softly behind her and for the first time in a long while, she was looking forward to tomorrow. </span>
