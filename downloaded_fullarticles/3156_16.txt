          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry was humming 'it's a mans world' when Draco woke up. </p><p>"Hey baby," Draco whispered, cuddling up to Harry's chest. Harry turned and faced him, so that their legs tangled, and their faces were close. </p><p>"Morning," Harry replied. "Or should I say afternoon?"</p><p>Draco buried his head in his boyfriends chest. "Why? What time is it?" </p><p>"Half past three in the afternoon. And Ron and Hermione invited us to the pub in three hours." </p><p>Harry laughed at Draco's expression. "I really don't want to go," he muttered, and Harry sat right up, pulling Draco up too. </p><p>"Well, we're going, so come on." He demanded, quickly kissing Draco on the lips, and running to the shower.  </p><p>"No!" Draco cried. "I dibs the shower!" </p><p>"Fuck off Dray, I only need to wash my hair." </p><p>Draco rolled his eyes, and walked into the bathroom, ignoring Harry's singing. </p><p>"You better not have a shit," Harry called out. </p><p>"I'm brushing my teeth you brain dead moron, can't you hear me?" Draco replied cheekily, grinning gently to himself. </p><p>"Suck my dick Draco." </p><p>"Been there, done that." </p><p>Harry's head popped out from the curtains, pulling a fake offended face. </p><p>Draco giggled, and reached for the mouth wash. </p><p>"You walked it to that," Draco said, turning away and spitting out the remenants of tooth paste and mouth wash. </p><p>Harry laughed, putting a towel around his waist and putting his head on Draco's shoulder.</p><p>"Have you just put your soaking wet hair on my pyjamas?" Draco asked, turning around, and facing Harry. </p><p>Harry grinned innocently. </p><p>"You need to comb your hair," Draco said, grabbing for the comb and grabbing Harry's wrist. </p><p>This was going to be fun. </p><p>"No! DON'T ATTACK ME WITH IT," Harry shouted, running out to the bedroom and running around the bed in circles. </p><p>"Harry, it's a comb!" Draco laughed, wrestling Harry on to the floor. </p><p>"NO!!!! MY WILD AND SEXY HAIR!" </p><p>"YOU GOT MY PYJAMAS WET!" </p><p>Harry giggled. "That's what she said." </p><p>"Ewww, you weirdo." </p><p align="left">"You guys have no idea how weird you look," cane a voice. Harry and Draco looked up, and saw Hermione and Ron. </p><p align="left">"He got my pyjamas wet," Draco pointed out. </p><p align="left">"HE TRIED TO ATTACK ME WITH A COMB!!" </p></div>
