    <p>At times it seems as if his life is destined to be a train wreck. As if it’s going to be nothing but one long string of decisions that leads to the biggest train wreck to ever be witnessed by mankind. He has a happy life, a loving family and amazing friends. This doesn’t stop him from waking up in the middle of the night, heart pounding and screams ringing in his ears.</p>
<p>Most days, he’s happy. Some days he wants to scream from the irrational pain clutching at his heart.</p><p>
  <em>Born to those who have thrice defied him… born as the seventh month dies.</em>
</p>
<p>The Fates have had their eye on Harry’s thread since the moment he began existing. It’s a dangerous thing to piss off a being that exists solely to chart your life.</p>
<p>
  <em>round and round the wheel he goes…</em>
</p>
<p>Harry has always had a talent for pissing off powerful beings.</p>

  <em>July 1991</em>
</p>
<p>When Hari was eleven, James and Lily packed up their house and moved. Marigold and Sara had both been a little too young to clearly remember the tiny town that they lived in. Hari however, remembers the sprawling fields that stretched on for ages at the edge of the town. Remembers the graveyard at the edge and the statue of a man with a sword on his back in the middle of the town square. Remembers the way his skin used to crawl when they would pass by the house at the edge of the town. The way it’s vacant windows used to stare at him as if to say <em>you know me.</em></p>
<p>He also vividly remembers the way that a lot of the townspeople had turned up their nose at his dad. Remembers the way they had tried to convince his mum to leave them. Remembers the ladies who would stop his mum in the store and talk to her in hushed tones. The way they looked at him with something approaching contempt. He also remembers the day someone had tried to kidnap Sara out of her stroller, saying that it was for his mum's own good and that she didn't need anything else tying her to <em>that man.</em></p>
<p>When it had happened Hari hadn't really understood the implications of what the lady had screamed at his mum, but the older he got the angrier that memory made him. He’s not really sure why they lived in Godric’s Hollow. He’s never asked and with every year that passes, it seems as if his chance to ask slips away.</p>
<p>

  <br/>
</p>
<p>They move into a huge, airy townhouse in London, only a few miles from where Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus live. Which is exciting for all of them. For a while they’d only gotten to see Sirius and Remus once or twice a year.</p>
<p>The first few years, life in the city is fine. Marigold thrives in the big city, in the fresh air. Comes home ecstatic about going to a school where there are other children who look like her. Sara was only four when they moved and adapted the easiest out of all of them.</p>
<p>Mum and Dad still look stressed and throw worried looks over their shoulders when they're out but it's calmer. Their family feels more at peace.</p>
<p>And then, as usual, when everything seems at its most peaceful, things began to go downhill.</p>
<p>

<p>
  <em>September 1991</em>
</p>
<p>Hari's first day of school seems as if it will pass by uneventfully. He's sort of made friends with a boy named Dean who sits next to him in most of their classes, and there's a quiet, clumsy boy who Hari spent a good bit of time chatting with at lunch. Maybe it was stupid of him to expect to have a life changing experience on the first day of school but there was this feeling of anticipation hovering in the air. This feeling that something was coming or beginning.</p>
<p>Near the end of lunch, Hari's getting ready to head back to class when he spots a girl sitting outside, a book nearly the size of her head in her lap and a group of about four kids forming a sort of semi-circle around her. The looks on their faces are anything but kind and Hari feels a shiver of anger run down his spine. Feels the anticipation creep higher almost as if the air itself is waiting for something.</p>
<p>Later, Hari won't be able to really remember exactly what was said, but he'll always remember the look of surprise on her face when he stands up for her. He almost thinks that it works, that the bullies will leave. Then one of the kids, a blonde with an obnoxiously pointed face, makes a comment about trash seeking out trash, and Hari  punches him before he even really realizes his fist is flying. </p>
<p>He gets suspended for two days, and mum and dad both look disappointed and sad. But on the way into the house dad ruffles his hair and mum gives him an extra long hug before sending him to his room.</p><p>They don’t approve of fighting but they both know what it’s like to have someone insult an integral part of your being. His mom hugs him and when she smiles her eyes look sad. Look as if she’s felt the weight of the world and it has left her aching. It will be a very long time until he realizes why.</p><p> 
<br/></p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>The girls name is Hermione. This is her second year at Croton Primary School and from what Hari has gathered she has no friends. This is thanks mostly to the same group of kids that had been bullying her when Hari had gotten involved.  It makes Hari's blood boil. He's only gotten to talk to Hermione for a little bit but she seems like a nice person. Later, when he's talking with his parents about why he'd gotten into the fight, it’s almost as if he can see them age just a little bit. He watches the lines around his dad's eyes tighten and feels his mom squeeze his hand just a little tighter. This is the moment that he feels the first shreds of bitterness start to form.</p><p>
  <em>There will never be a world where injustice settles well on Hari’s shoulders, never be a world where he can stand back and not get involved in the injustice that is life.</em>
</p>

</p>
<p>The year passes by and as much as things change, one thing always remains the same. Harri makes other friends. Goes to football games with Dean and to the ocean with Neville. He takes his sisters to the library. Goes on long, winding hikes with his dad. Goes on adventures downtown with his mum. Yet, for all the pieces of his life that everyone else fills, no one makes him feel as complete as Hermione. When she’s around, the constant itching at the back of his brain quiets down just a bit. </p>
<p>She's wicked smart and occasionally overbearing but she sticks by his side no matter what. No matter how many times they insult her. No matter how many times they insult him. She already got bullied a lot and being friends with him seems to have made it worse. She's too smart, too ugly, hair too bushy, teeth too big, skin too dark and Hari ends up getting into more fights that year than he really should.</p><p>Hermione tries her best to get him to stop defending her. Tries her best to get him to just chill out, sit back, and focus on his studies. The anger is bone deep though. Is so deep it feels like a festering wound that he <em>needs</em> to get rid of.</p><p>"Hari, Hari, listen, they're not important. Their words don't matter." she mutters to him one day, the two of them huddled behind the bleachers at lunch.</p>
<p>Class starts in less than twenty minutes but he's scowling at the ground, Malfoy's words still ringing in his ears.</p>
<p>
  <em>It's a pity you don't look like your mother, Potter. A pity that you always hang out around trash. A pity that you --</em>
</p>
<p>"Words always matter," he says and watches the way she eyes him, sadness still lingering in the creases around her eyes.</p>
<p>"You're right. Words matter, but theirs don't." She takes his hand and squeezes it once. "I'm going to be great Hari. I'm going to make myself so great they have no choice but to respect me."</p>
<p>He watches the way the sun lingers on her skin and thinks that he believes her.</p>
<p>"I'll be right there beside you, Hermione. Watching your back like always."</p>
<p>
  <em>Those words reek of prophecy. Of forever and eternity and I will always be by your side. Nothing will ever tear me from you. Nothing will ever separate us. The words feel like an oath.</em>
</p>
<p>Hermione stares at him, eyes wide, the moment stretching out but the bell rings, the moment breaks. She smiles and they hurry off to class. Later, he’ll think back on this and say it’s the moment he knew they’d be friends <em>forever.</em></p><p>

  <em>October 1991</em>
</p>
<p>The first time Hermione meets Sirius she stares for a very long moment before turning to Hari with a betrayed face.</p>
<p>“Hari, when you said, ‘hey, come meet my godfather. He’s really cool, you’ll really like him.’ Did you forget to mention something?”</p>
<p>He sends her a blank look, “Um… He can be kind of berk when he first meets people?”</p>
<p>She sighs, running a hand over her face. “You didn’t think to mention that he’s Sirius Black. The same Sirius Black who made headlines for months when inherited his family's estate. The same estate that is home to a library that houses some of the rarest books in England?”</p>
<p>Sirius barks out a laugh at the same time as Hari, and really, he hadn’t even thought about that, but he should have known she would.</p>
<p>“Tell me, sweetheart, how many times did you try to think of a way to sneak into that library?” Sirius asks, still chuckling.</p>
<p>Hermione bares her teeth at him, a mimicry of a smile. “Who says I haven’t already found a way to sneak in there?” </p>
<p>And Sirius, for just a minute, looks like he believes her. “There’s no way. The security system on that house is insane. How would a little thing like you ever have gotten in?”</p>
<p>“I’ll guess you’ll never know. But next time you’re near the library tell me if <em>The Codex of Leicester</em> is still there?” She wanders off toward the kitchen, leaving Sirius to stare after her, a perplexed frown on his face.</p>
<p>“I know she’s lying. I do, but I still have the urge to go look for that book.”</p>
<p>Hari laughs before following Hermione into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Later, when Remus arrives, Hermione sees the book he’s got with him and immediately latches onto his side, all smiles and intelligence. Remus loves her instantly.</p>
<p>Sirius never does get Remus to understand why he pretends to be scared of her, and Hermione takes great pleasure in laughing at Sirius.</p>
<p>
  <em>Later, this is one of the memories that Hari looks back on when he feels as if he’s going to break apart from grief.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And there are oh so many moments to come. More than anyone ever could have imagined.</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>July 1994</em>
</p>
<p>Before you know it, Hari's almost thirteen. Hermione’s almost fourteen and it seems as if everything will stay calm. As if life has looked at them all and said <em>okay, just this once, you deserve a break.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>Like fate had looked at this child and said just this once you get to keep everyone you love. Just this once I won't rip them away from you.</em>
</p>
<p>Two weeks before Hari's thirteenth birthday they get a call. His dad picks up the phone and all the color drains out of his face. The phone slips out of his hand, the noise of the phone hitting the floor loud in the silence that’s swept over the room. His mum picks up the phone and she holds it for less than a minute before she goes sickly white and tears start streaming down her face.</p>
<p>
  <em>Sirius is dead.</em>
</p>
<p>Mari screams, cries, refuses to come out of her room --</p>
<p>Sara goes quiet, still too young to truly understand the idea of death, but she understands that Siri is gone and he’s never coming back. She goes quiet and it is weeks before she talks again.</p>
<p>Dad sits on a chair, blank faced, eyes dry, and Hari wonders if this is what it's like to watch someone die even while they’re still alive.</p>
<p>It's hours before James musters the will to get up, to go try and comfort Sara and Mari. Days before he can figure out how to breathe without his heart feeling as if it will fall out of his chest.</p>
<p>Lily has been outside of Mari's door since she slammed it shut, crying and trying to reason with her - trying to keep an eye on Sara. In all the chaos and all the grief, Hari just quietly leaves.</p>
<p>Looks around the house now saturated with grief, looks at his family shattering apart, and goes to the only person that will understand the rage building in his chest.</p>
<p>He shows up at Hermione's house, face blank, eyes red. She takes one look at him and tells her parents they're going for a walk. The Granger’s worried eyes follow them until they’re out of sight. </p>
<p>They end up at an empty park, the sun nearly gone and Hari <em>breaks--</em></p>
<p>Hermione sits quietly on a swing and watches him scream and cry and rage and when he finally sags onto a bench she moves to sit beside him. She holds his hand and they talk quietly about all the great times they had had with Sirius. All the fun times. All the ways he had loved Remus. The way he had never given a thought to anyone's skin color. </p>
<p>Hari cries. Hermione grips his hand so tight her fingers go numb.</p>
<p>They sit there for what feels like hours, <em>and that could have been the end</em></p>
<p>
  <em>Hari could have started to heal, but fate, fate, fate</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Fate has always had her claws sunk deeply under his skin, this life is no exception. There will never be an exception.</em>
</p>
<p>Two months later they learn that the drunk driver, who struck and killed Sirius while he was on his motorcycle, has gotten off free. The bitterness and anger in his stomach grows tighter, and he watches something hard settle in the back of Hermione's eyes.</p>
<p>
  <em>Injustice has never settled well in their stomachs and this time it's so much more personal. In this life they could have been great. Could have brought the world to its knees but fate, fate, fate…</em>
</p>
<p>Remus spends more time on their couch than in his house and there are days where Hari is scared the grief is going to take Remus away from them too. Is scared he’s going to keep losing people that he loves. Wakes up sobbing, heart pounding, convinced that he’s going to get up and his family is going to be <em>gone.</em></p>
<p>There are months where his dad sleeps on the couch next to Remus more than he sleeps in his own bed.</p>
<p>Months where his mom’s smiles never reach her eyes.</p>
<p>
  <em>In this life, James has to learn to live without Sirius. Always one dies, always one destined to live with the grief of losing a brother.</em>

  <em>September 1993</em>
</p>
<p>Life moves on.</p>
<p>And then, in between one breath and the next, they're back in school and expected to sit down, shut up, and listen.</p>
<p>Hari is beginning to get really tired of listening. Is getting really tired of blindly following. He can see the same discontent echoed back in Hermione’s eyes and the anger coils tighter, the sadness climbs higher.</p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>Hari gets home one day, in the middle of September, and finds out his mum's expecting -</p>
<p><em>A life for a death,</em> he hears her whisper when she thinks no one is listening.</p>
<p>There are days where Hari wishes he could trade this new life back for Siri.</p>
<p>Wishes they had Siri, not this child growing in his mum's belly.</p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>Deodan Sirius Potter is born February 23rd and Hari <em>loves</em> him-</p>
<p>Fucking aches with loving him with still being burdened down by grief.</p>
<p>
  <em>There are days where Mari looks at him, eyes still angry and he thinks she sees everything he's been trying to push down since Siri died. But the moment always passes.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>Life moves on.</p>
<p>Fate lounges on her gilded chair, seething as she watches Hari’s thread move along.</p>
<p>Death leans against a gravestone and watches the Potter family grieve.</p>
<p>And as much things change, some things always stay the same.</p>
