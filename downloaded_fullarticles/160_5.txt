    <p>Charlie felt frustration bubbling up, his eyes getting wet as he kept on struggling. All he wanted to do was brush his hair before class. Now his comb was stuck in his hair, painfully entangled into a massive knot he had discovered halfway through History of Magic. He had sleepily started to pick at it to entertain himself through Binn’s lecture, but now he could see he was only making it worse. Charlie let out a pained noise through gritted teeth as he tried to pull the comb out one more time. All it did was make more of the brittle teeth snap off. The sound of them hitting the floor ringing in his ears with each pathetic clatter.</p><p>He was full-on crying now, frustrated with himself and his red mess. This wasn’t the first time his hair had knotted like this. His hair, like most of Charlie, looked like his mum’s father and his side of the family. It was almost eerie looking at family photos, his siblings not believing it was another person at first when they found the Prewett photo album in storage. Coming along with his smaller nose with its flat, long bridge, square and darker eyes, tanner skin, and sharp jaw that all made him look almost nothing like his parents, came his maternal grandfather’s hair. A darker red, with a wavy, almost curly texture that his mum had no idea how to handle. Her hair was slightly wavy, but it never knotted like this. That resulted in the only method his mum knew to deal with it: cut it short. Even shorter than she demanded his brothers keep their hair.</p><p>Charlie always liked his hair, liked the feeling. He had a thing about textures and how curtain materials felt against his skin. This made second-hand shopping feel more like a Russian roulette. His hair was soft, comforting like a puff of cotton. That was why Charlie had grown it out in the first place. It came with the daunting task of ignoring Bill’s offers to cut it as he had at the Burrow when Mum was too busy, but he had made it this far. For all his trouble to get his hair down to chin-level, this is where it had landed him. He was now stuck in a cold boy’s bathroom, missing potions class, with a comb buried and broken in his hair. This was probably going to earn him a detention with Snape.</p><p>Charlie was snapped out of his thoughts by the sound of the stall door latch and the sudden appearance of another person behind him. He stared at the person through the mirror, suddenly very aware of how red his cheeks were and how much he was crying.<br/>
A Slytherin, Charlie noticed, looking around Bill’s age, maybe 12 or so? This person, which Charlie was still calling a person because Charlie couldn’t really tell if they were a boy or a girl by looking at them. They were in the boy’s bathroom, yes, but the fact that it wasn’t obvious one way or the other sparked Charlie’s interest and surprised him.<br/>
Another thing that surprised him was that this Slytherin was still looking at him, but not in a very Slytherin-y way the snakes usually did. This person looked at his situation, and their charcoal eyes turned soft. They stepped closer, digging in their messenger bag before saying, in the softest and sweetest voice Charlie had ever heard,<br/>
“Wedged in there bad, huh?” They said before handing Charlie a hankie. Another surprise for the list.<br/>
He nodded, sniffing and trying to clean up his tears before the Slytherin started to make fun of him. They didn’t look like they were going to start making fun of him, but Charlie knew by now that didn’t mean much.</p><p>“It will be okay, I have something for that. It is fixable, okay?” They said, taking a bottle from their bag. “We will fix it, and you can be on your way in no time, okay? No worries.”</p><p>They walked closer to him, their height towering over the tiny first year by about a full head. Charlie let go of the comb, which was now hanging awkwardly at the back of his head. Charlie was always taught not to trust Slytherins. He'd heard the horror stories from Bill and his parents. But he wasn’t going to get out of this by himself.  There was no way he was going to try to find Bill with that thing hanging off his hair, scraping at his neck.</p><p>They sprayed some of the product onto the knot first, carefully finagling the cheap plastic out of his hair. He had expected it to hurt more, but whatever they sprayed seemed to turn his hair to butter. They sprayed more on their fancy hairbrush, metal and sturdy looking, before completely working out the knot, then going through the rest of his hair. This had taken them 10 minutes tops, all while smiling sweetly at him and encouraging him through the whole process.</p><p>“There, all done.” They said, setting the bottle and brush down on the counter “see? Good as new.” Charlie nodded, staring at his now unknotted hair. He had always liked the feeling of his hair, but it had never felt this good. He could run his fingers through it easily, feeling like a pillow was on his head. “Your hair is really soft by the way. Color is pretty too.” They said, putting the brush back.<br/>
Charlie blushed, having never received many compliments around the subject. Comments usually ranged from “oh red hair, you’re obviously a Weasley” to “You look so different. Almost like a proper pureblood. I’d ask if you’re adopted, but the hair is a dead giveaway.”</p><p>“Thanks,” he said, his throat still tight from crying “what's that stuff anyway? It worked wonders!”<br/>
“Oh, this?” They asked, grabbing the spray bottle “An argon and coconut oil mixture. I have that sleek easy stuff too, but this seems to work well enough for me.”<br/>
They flipped their hair as to give a playful demonstration, shoulder-length black locks flicking out. “Of course it gets easier to take care of hair with your type when the hair is longer. You can braid it and stuff to keep tangles out completely, and you look like a Viking so that is always a plus.”</p><p>Charlie realized the Slytherin was trying to joke a little too late, but he liked seeing them smile and chuckle anyways. He gave them a grin.<br/>
“Thanks for the help, I would have never gotten out of that on my own. I would have been stuck here for hours.” Charlie said, not wanting to think of what Bill would say if he had been the one to find him crying over something as stupid as his hair.<br/>
“You looked like you needed it. I had a few nightmare knots like that before I made my hair routine, not fun.” They said, picking up their bag and handing Charlie the bottle. “You can keep this one if you like. I have a million bottles of these in my trunk.”<br/>
“Oh,” Charlie blinked, wrapping his hand around the product “thanks, you really don’t have to.”<br/>
“Do not worry about it. I would hate for you to get stuck like that again with no one to help you.”<br/>
Charlie nodded, putting it in his own small messenger bag. There was an uncomfortable silence as he shuffled his stuff back into his bag.<br/>
“So...you said routine, do you have other hair stuff?”<br/>
“Do I ever!” They said, dark eyes lighting up like a clear summer night sky. “Come on, I will show you!”</p><p>Charlie followed them out of the bathroom, excited but nervous.<br/>
“I’m Charlie, by the way, Charlie Weasley,” he said as they walked, bracing for impact and the wonderful excitement to fall from their face which usually accompanied his introduction.<br/>
“Blue Hepburn,” they said, smile getting bigger.</p><p>Charlie didn’t recognize the last name, which was odd. He at least heard of the pureblood names, even if he didn’t meet anyone from those families. And their first name was interesting too. He had never heard of someone named Blue. Their accent and the way they talked was cool too. Their word choice made Blue sound a bit like an English textbook, or like they were performing an excerpt from an old English novel. It was unusually exciting, and interesting, and overall intriguing. That’s what Blue was like all-around Charlie thought. With their dark olive skin, strong dancing figure, and wavy hair that was braided and clipped in all sorts of ways. It interested Charlie. Nowhere near dragons of course. For people though, Blue was getting higher on his list by the minute, and that scared him a little.</p><p>Blue walked Charlie to the Slytherin dorms. They charmed his robes green to sneak him through the dripping wall entrance. A chill went up Charlie’s body as they walked.<br/>
“Oh yeah, the dorm is charmed so non-Slytherins feel the cold down here. I had forgotten about that,” Blue said taking him through the common room. Charlie stopped to admire it. The common room was mostly empty with class still in session. There were standard common room items like the squishy looking couches and chairs, dark wooden tables that had games or books stacked on them, green-tinted lights that hung from the stone walls, and a warm fireplace. But what made Charlie stop and gawk was the massive wall and skylight ceiling of windows showing a view of the lake’s bustling creatures. Charlie saw a school of fish, mermaids, even shadows of the giant squid in the distance.</p><p>“I know the room is cool, but we have to keep moving. You are not supposed to be here remember?” Blue whispered, tugging Charlie to another stone hallway, going deeper into the unknown for him.<br/>
The Slytherin dorms weren’t much different than the Gryffindor’s rooms if Charlie was honest. The color scheme was different, green curtains instead of red, and the rooms were smaller. They had odd shapes to them, as they followed the shape of the lake instead of being round and cookie-cutter to follow the shape of a tower. Blue’s room was tiny and had no roommates like Charlie’s four. Blue mentioned that all the rooms had a different capacity, and tended to shift in shape depending on how many students Slytherin had. The older years were farther into the lake meaning they had much better views of the sea life than Blue did as a second year. Charlie still stared at their big underwater window for a good minute or so though.</p><p>“You really like sea life huh?”<br/>
Charlie nodded “I love creatures, any kind really. Dragons especially!”<br/>
“Dragons? That is so cool.” Blue said getting a bag out of their trunk. “I always thought they looked rather upset, but I guess that is just the face.”<br/>
“You’ve seen a dragon? Like up close?!” Charlie asked, excitedly bounding across the room to Blue’s bed.<br/>
“Yeah, one of my great-uncles works on a dragon reserve. He still lives in Romania where my mama is from. Teaches local wizard kids about dragons. Came to my primary school a few times.”<br/>
“You lived near a dragon reserve AND you got to go to primary school?!” Charlie gasped, regretting his lot in life just a little.<br/>
“Well yeah, everyone is required to go to primary school. There are a bunch of little wizard primaries around each city. Though Mum told me that is not what you Englanders do?”<br/>
“No, I was homeschooled. There are primary schools around our county, but they’re all muggle and fancy. Which usually means we can’t go.” Charlie said, recalling how much Charlie wanted so much to go to school, to get out of the crowded house and play with other kids his age that wouldn’t tease him. Eventually, Charlie learned to stop asking and to get out of the house with other methods. This is when he had his adventures, going all around the countryside and befriending anything he could.<br/>
“Must have been lonely being homeschooled.”<br/>
“No, I have six other siblings. One older brother and four younger, and only one baby sister.”<br/>
“That must be exciting” Blue chuckled.<br/>
“It was at first, now everybody’s just loud,” Charlie said, eyeing Blue’s ironically not-blue box. “I don’t think they like me very much.”<br/>
“Why do you say that?”<br/>
“They don’t really seem interested when I talk anymore. They just kind of nod or talk about something else when I try to.”<br/>
“That is awful,” Blue said.<br/>
“I don’t think they mean to, everyone’s just busy...all the time.”<br/>
Charlie blinked, wondering why he was telling Blue all of this and why it felt so easy. Surely he should be telling Bill all of this or writing to his parents like they said to if he had a problem. He had no idea why telling Blue felt more okay. Why Blue felt more distant.<br/>
“I am sure the house is just busy. I know my mum was busy with my little siblings when they were still really young.”<br/>
“How many siblings do you have?”<br/>
“Two younger, a boy and a girl, and we had a few foster siblings come and go.”<br/>
“I’ve never heard of purebloods doing foster care,” Charlie said surprised.<br/>
“I’m not a pureblood,” Blue said sternly. “My mum’s a squib, and mama’s a muggle. I don’t really know what that makes me.”<br/>
“Oh, sorry I didn’t mean...I just never met a Slytherin that wasn’t pureblood before.”<br/>
“They are hard to miss with how much loud hissing they do, huh?” Blue said, their face softening back again. “But who you meet is not all there is.”<br/>
“I know-I just,” Charlie swallowed “I didn’t think the hat would be that mean.”</p><p>Blue looked at him, looking a bit like a bird with their hair ruffled and eyes blinking at him. Charlie started to sink into himself. The white noise of the water outside never felt louder as it did when Blue was still.<br/>
“It would seem rather a terrible place to be from the outside, huh?” Blue asked, moving again. “It is not so bad. The bullies are loud, but there’s only a few of them. Most of us are pretty quietly trying to do our thing, trying to ignore them best we can. I want to do more, punch them sometimes, but I also want to sleep here without having one eye open.”<br/>
“One eye opened?”<br/>
“Just an expression, it means you sleep really lightly so you can hear if you are being attacked.”<br/>
“Oh, yeah that doesn’t sound nice. Sleep is normally really nice.”<br/>
“Sleep, one of life’s joys” Blue chuckled as they unlocked their box, opening it wide as Charlie shifted next to them.<br/>
“Woah, that’s a lot of stuff!”<br/>
“My collection, all the hair products, and accessories I have gotten over the years.”</p><p>Charlie peered into the well-organized chest. Bottles like the one they had given him sat at the front all neatly in a row, metal brushes and wooden combs strapped to the lid, curlers and colorful clips all in little drawers. Charlie ran his fingers along the different clips, looking to Blue before they said he could touch them. He started opening the drawers, ringing tiny bells on Christmas clips, rolling a cold braid bead on his palm, petting fuzzy cat brooches. Charlie smiled as he saw some clips with dragons on them, picking them up with the utmost care as if they would turn real at any moment.<br/>
“You seem to not have enough hair for a proper braid right now, but I could try to get those bangs out of your face for a bit,” Blue said, holding up the other dragon clips.<br/>
“My family was never big on braids having only one girl.”<br/>
“Oh nonsense, as long as the hair is well, long, braids can be worn by anybody. Come on I will teach you!”</p><p>Charlie didn’t know how long Blue and he spent behind their Slytherin green curtains. All he knew was he had learned to do a basic braid with Blue’s hair, and Charlie had two tiny lace braids on either side of his hair, held together by one green and one red dragon clip. But they talked as this happened, about nothing and almost everything at all. Charlie talked about dragons, plus the other creatures he was friends with back home, and Blue didn’t interrupt or brush him off once. Blue got talking about their interests too, hair and makeup and clothes, and how they were already planning to open a salon shop someday.</p><p>Charlie snuck back to Gryffindor tower, goodbyes said to Blue at the staircase and robes set back to their original colors. The Fat Lady (Charlie really thought the name was quite mean. He should really learn her actual name at some point) smiled as he walked to the painting, complimenting him on his hair.<br/>
“You look quite regal,” she said before Charlie gave her the password and a quick thank you.<br/>
Bill also noticed Charlie’s hair, but it wasn't anything like the portrait guardian.</p><p>“Charlie, I’ve been worried sick! McGonagall says you skipped all your afternoon classes, and now you nearly missed dinner?! What happened?” Bill said, scowling.<br/>
“I made a friend” he stated simply, a smile on his face that he couldn’t seem to wipe away.<br/>
“Oh what, did you find a braiding baboon in the forest?” Bill said, his expression reminding Charlie on when the twins tried to pull a face to look like Mum.<br/>
“No, baboons live in Africa Bill. And I suppose you could teach one to braid give it time, but-“<br/>
“Charlie, that’s not the focus of this conversation” Bill sighed “where were you?”<br/>
“I was out makin' a friend” Charlie explained, “it’s a human-looking one this time Bill, I promise. Mum told me to make those while I was here.”<br/>
“Yes, but you can’t just ditch all your classes for half the day. It’s only October, but if you miss that much school you’ll fall behind. You’ll never be able to stay on the quidditch team next year if you treat your classes like this.”<br/>
“I didn’t!” Charlie’s smile was now fading “I wanted to get to class, but I got...stuck.”<br/>
“Stuck?”<br/>
“My hair got a big knot and the comb got stuck in the bathroom trying to get it out, but my friend came and helped. They got it out see!” Charlie said, lifting the back of his hair up “and then they did these nice braids. Aren’t they nice?”<br/>
“A bit girlish Charlie” Bill said after a tut. “Look I’m glad you made a friend, but next time you get stuck just come and get me. Or better yet let me cut your hair so this doesn’t happen period-“<br/>
“No!” Charlie nearly shouted, making everyone in the common room stare at the two brothers. All the eye contact made Charlie want to huddle in a corner.<br/>
“Charlie keep your voice down. We talked about indoor volume remember?” Bill whispered “Fine, I won’t cut your hair if it’ll just make you go into one of your tantrums. But you have to explain to Mum it’s not my fault. I’m going to go tell McGonagall you came back.”</p><p>Charlie felt marginally worse after talking with Bill then he had when he got done talking to Blue. He never liked being scolded, and it seemed to bother him more than it ever did Bill or Percy. The twins acted like they were immune to yelling all together, which he really couldn’t understand, even more than the fact they thought loud noises like explosions were somehow fun.<br/>
Ron didn’t get scolded as much, and Ginny was too young to do much of anything good or bad.<br/>
Charlie walked up to his dorm room, closed his curtains and pulled out the homework he had for his morning classes.</p><p>One of his roommates Ben Copper, eventually brought him his notes for the classes he missed after dinner. Charlie had tried to spot Blue at dinner, but it was hard to sneak a look at their table for long periods of time. He promised himself to get into the habit of sitting on the other side of the Gryffindor table facing all the other tables. He had sat on the wall-facing side to avoid accidental eye contact with people, but now he had someone he wanted to spot.</p><p>Charlie fiddled with his wand as he walked back to the tower, twirling it in his hands like a gangster trying to show off a switchblade. He still remembered when he was given his 12-inch ashwood with unicorn hair wand. It was a gift, his maternal grandfather’s old wand he had when he was his age. It wouldn’t fit nearly as well as the 9 1/4 inch surprisingly swishy wand, plane tree wood and a Sânziană hair core he would eventually get when he move to Romania, but it did its job for school alright. The core was similar enough that it responded to Charlie’s magic well. The only problem he ever seemed to have was the length, as he was easily the shortest boy in his year. He didn’t know what the cause of his height problem was. His mother forced enough second helpings on him, but the growth never came. Charlie still liked George and Fred’s theory that Bill was sucking all Charlie’s height when they went to sleep. Bill was more tower than boy these days, walking beside him like a bodyguard. He always towered over Charlie, but now Bill was growing taller and fitter than everyone else too.</p><p>“Stop” Bill whispered, gently putting a hand on Charlie’s. “You’re going to accidentally shoot off a spell if you keep that up.”<br/>
Charlie tucked his wand back in his robes, his hands now just stuffed into his pockets.<br/>
“We really ought to find you a less dangerous fidget,” he said sighing, a smile on his lips now “before you accidentally give Percy rat’s ears again. It was funny at first, but you know how he is.”<br/>
“I wouldn’t want rat’s ears either. Especially if they’re anything like Scabbers’ hideous ones.”<br/>
“True, but he knows getting angry only riles the twins up more.”<br/>
“I don’t know why. Pranks should make people laugh. If they know he’s not going to laugh, why do they keep doing it?”<br/>
“Who knows, but they’ll learn eventually. Something will backfire on them, bite them on the butt.”<br/>
“If they make somethin' else explode in their room again, I think I might just bite them myself.”<br/>
Bill snickered “I think Mum will bite them first.”</p><p>They both laughed. Charlie, being so distracted with the joking that he smacked right into the back of the seventh-year in front of him. All the Gryffindors had stopped in their tracks. Stillness then turned into anything but, spells flying everywhere. Two Slytherin and Gryffindor boys dueled right in the middle of the hall. Only the steps of McGonagall and Snape managed to cut through the two yelling. Detentions were given, House points were taken, and the boys were dragged to the headmaster’s office. It wasn’t an uncommon ending to dinner. Tensions were still high from the war ending two years ago. Kids were still recovering just as much as the rest of the world, and it seemed to be going as well as the world: not at all.</p><p>The prefects shooed everyone back in the direction of the tower. Most were silent or talking in hushed tones about what just happened. No one knew what the fights were about most of the time, only that they happened and no one was doing anything about it.<br/>
Charlie stumbled as he went along, not even realizing what he tripped on was another person until he heard a sharp<br/>
“Would you watch it!”</p><p>Charlie whipped around, spotting a girl who was changing from colors that matched the wall to bright pink hair and a Hufflepuff uniform.<br/>
“Woah” he breathed as he walked closer “how’d you do that?”<br/>
“Not even going to say sorry?” She asked, “you almost scuffed my boots.”<br/>
“You’re right, I’m sorry. That would be awful. Your boots are really cool.” He said smiling down at her black leather boots, little bracelet charms attached to the laces which Charlie sat down to touch.<br/>
“Thanks, I like your clips, very punk rock.”<br/>
“Really? Cool! I liked them for the dragons, but my brother said they were kinda girly.”<br/>
“Punk rock can be girly too, but I think they suit you just fine.” She said, grinning at him. Charlie grinned back, sitting on the floor next to the pink-haired Hufflepuff.<br/>
“Thanks, I’m Charlie by the way. Whatcha doing readin’ on the floor?”<br/>
“Reading, obviously. I’m Tonks.” She said jiggling the book a bit for emphasis. “Got it from the groundskeeper.”<br/>
“That big guy in the hut with the puppy that barks at everyone?”<br/>
“Yeah, his name’s Hagrid. He invited me over for tea the first week. Said he knew my parents back in the Order. Wanted to see how we’ve been.”<br/>
“My uncles were part of the Order, but Mum doesn’t talk about it much anymore. It makes her miss them and-“</p><p>“Charlie!” Bill said, his breath hollow from running “I swear I turn around for a second.”<br/>
“Hello,” Tonks said waving.<br/>
“Oh, hi,” Bill said with a time of bewilderment. “Nymphadora right?”<br/>
“She said her name was Tonks” Charlie stated, still sat next to her with his chin resting on his knees.<br/>
“Don’t call me Nymphadora. Ever.” She said, “I take it that’s the brother?”<br/>
“Bill Weasley,” he said, sticking his hand out for Tonks to shake, which she did quickly without looking up from her book. “Well...I’ll leave you two to talk... I guess.”<br/>
Bill turned back in the direction of the tower, the look of bewilderment still on his face. He wasn’t used to his brother talking freely with other people. But if Charlie's new friend was Ted and Andromeda Tonks' daughter, Bill guessed he had nothing to worry about.</p><p>===</p><p>Bill had something to worry about. Charlie had come back to the common room the next day 10 minutes after curfew, his boots covered in mud, and flowers all over his hair. An entrance that became the standard for Charlie after that. With how much he remembered their mum yelling about Charlie or the others coming in with mud, he tried to be mad about it, but he just couldn’t bring himself to do it. Charlie looked so happy. Bill never realized how unhappy he was before this friendship started. So Bill stopped trying to scold him, stopped trying to take care of Charlie how he thought he should. He eventually just decided to teach him and Tonks the basic cleaning charm, and their shoes became cleaner after that. Not perfect, but cleaner.</p><p>Charlie also talked to Bill more, telling him in a big, happy rant what Tonks and he did that day. Most of it was them playing near the forest or the lake or having tea with Hagrid, but every once in a while he’d say that they didn’t do much that day. He came back spotless those days, with a new braid or even some eye make up and painted nails one time. He didn’t talk about how his little makeovers happened, but those days Charlie was happiest. He tried to hide that fact, but Bill knew with how Charlie started skipping and hopping around, looked in the mirror twirling and giggling, or just beaming whenever one of the girls complimented any of it.</p><p>Bill was usually anything but unobservant so it surprised him he had taken so long to realize any of this. After that small revelation Bill started to pay attention to anything and everything about Charlie. Bill worried if he missed what made Charlie so happy aside from the obvious—dragons— what else could he have missed over the years of trying to wrangle all of his other siblings. He was certain his parents hadn’t. So he knew that if he didn’t try to notice things about Charlie, no one would.</p><p>===</p><p>At least Bill thought no one else would. Tonks was observant, but mostly she just made Charlie’s lack of wanting to talk easier by doing it for both of them. Unless it was one of his special interests, then she knew to let Charlie talk and talk. She was Charlie`s best friend out in public, but in private with Blue, he felt his best. He could share all the facets of his personality with Blue, “girly” things and all. Charlie wondered if he could introduce Tonks and Blue, make things way easier. For some reason, he was always hesitant. What they had together was special. Just Charlie and Blue hidden from the world. Somehow in Charlie’s mind he and Blue being his big secret added to the excitement. It turned sitting in their dorm room or an abandoned classroom talking and doing each other's hair into an adventure. But mostly Charlie was scared. Tonks was great, and Bill was getting better at listening, but if they didn’t like Blue for being a Slytherin? What was he going to do? Charlie couldn’t lose Blue. He’d do anything to not lose Blue.</p><p>Charlie’s fear wasn’t for nothing. Going home for Christmas break only solidified his need for Blue and their space together. He was glad to be home, but the way he felt with Blue, and even Tonk and now Bill, was a stark difference with how he felt at the Burrow. He didn’t want to feel this way. All of his classmates had been ranting and raving about going home for weeks. Something that got everyone so excited shouldn’t have felt like this. And it wasn’t all the time, the first few days went without any incidents. Everyone was so excited the two oldest were home, Percy especially. He had held onto Bill for a whole minute on the doorstep before they could walk up the drive again.<br/>
Charlie did feel a rush of peace when they appeared in the front yard. The light dusting of snow covering the Burrow and its surrounding fields made Charlie almost like winter. Almost.<br/>
The first few weeks Charlie had a hard time adjusting back to life in the house. He saw Bill struggling with being home before, but he didn’t understand it fully until now. Charlie had been so used to doing things on his own, doing things outside of class and eating on his own schedule. Being back on the houses’ schedule was jarring enough to give Charlie whiplash.</p><p>Hands down the worst part of his break was his mum fretting over his hair.<br/>
“Honestly Charlie, with your hair this long it’ll be nothing but knots-“<br/>
Molly paused in her lecture, her eyebrows knitting together in confusion as her fingers went through his locks with no resistance. The oils and products Charlie was applying had been doing the trick and his hair had kept the texture without getting tangled. It was long enough that Charlie was braiding it at night now. It was nowhere near a rat’s nest when he woke up anymore. He smiled into the mirror back at his mum, chest getting puffed up.<br/>
“I have a routine now Mum” Charlie grinned, getting off the dreaded hair cut chair in the living room and sprinted to get his shoebox. Carefully laid in like a grid it were his comb, oils, the dragon clips, and a potion Blue had brewed to encourage hair to grow faster. All of it kept neatly in his tiny beat-up shoebox “look!”<br/>
“I see,” Molly said, picking a bottle up and checking the label “where did you get all of this?”<br/>
“My friend, they’ve been helping me.”</p><p>“He’s been hanging out with Tonks. You remember her, right Mum? Mr. Ted and Andy Tonks’ daughter?” Bill said stepping into the living room. Ginny was in his arms, rubbing her back as she drifted off to sleep. Percy was still trailing Bill as well, and no one blamed him with the twins watching his every move like a hawk.</p><p>“Oh yes, I remember Nymphadora. I babysat her a few times when Ted was on a mission. She’s a lovely girl if I recall, very energetic. I’m sure she’ll manage to keep up with you Charlie. It’s a good match.”<br/>
“Mum” Charlie whined “it’s not like that. Her name is Tonks, and she’s my friend.”<br/>
“I’m sure she’s just a friend now, but we’ll see how you feel when you get older, huh?”<br/>
“There’s nothin' ‘just’ about it!” Charlie was raising his voice now, clearly angry. “She’s my friend. She’s important to me. Why do you act like friends don’t matter as much?”<br/>
“Charlie, I’m just teasing. No need to get upset.” Molly said ranking a comb through his hair “just calm down so I can cut your hair. It’s terribly long.”<br/>
“Don’t wanna” he muttered.<br/>
“What was that?”<br/>
“I don’t wanna cut it. I like it long!”<br/>
“Charlie come now-“<br/>
“Mum it’s fine. He likes it long let him leave it. He knows what he`s doing with it,” Bill said, Charlie and Molly both wiping their heads around at Bill. Charlie’s mouth was opened wide in a big ‘o’ gaping at his older brother. Bill has never defended him like this to his mum before, and certainly never about this.</p><p>Molly scowled, gathering Charlie`s hair in her hands tight “Bill he’s getting a proper haircut. He’s not going back to Hogwarts like this.”</p><p>===</p><p>“Charlie? You in here?” Bill asked softly. He entered their room, the lights all dimmed, and Charlie had huddled in the corner with just about every comforter in the house. Bill could tell he’d been crying. His nose was dripping and eyes went red-rimmed. It was the only thing he could see as he wrapped himself in his blanket cocoon.</p><p>“Oh, Charlie” Bill sighed, closing the door slowly so it didn’t squeak too much.<br/>
“It’s not fair!” The little blanket lump said, the sound of little feet and fists hitting the wood floor. “It’s MY hair! What’s so bad about it?!”<br/>
“There’s nothin' bad about it.” Bill said, crouching next to Charlie “Mum just thinks certain ways about what boy’s hair should look like is all.”<br/>
“Then I don’t wanna be a boy” Charlie sniffed, burying his blanket covered head into Bill’s chest. “I’ll just won’t be anythin', then she can’t tell me how to look.”<br/>
“She shouldn’t tell you how to look anyways, Charlie. You’re not the one that needs to change.”</p><p>Bill signed again wondering if his mum was always like this and he just hadn’t paid attention.<br/>
“You know what? We can pack that hair growth potion dad has. The one he used when Fred blew his eyebrows off.”<br/>
“Really?” Charlie gasped, looking up at Bill. He could see little hair locks of what was left of Charlie’s bangs popping out of his bundle. Bill held out his hands and Charlie crawled in his lap, blankets coming with.<br/>
“Yes, really,” Bill said rubbing his back. Charlie sprang at Bill. His little arms holding onto Bill for dear life. The blankets had slipped off and Bill could see the full extent of the damage. Charlie’s hair was next to nothing. Chopped locks stuck out like they were trying to pick a direction but didn’t have any sense of where to go. Bill winced. This was excessive even for Mum’s usual cuts.</p><p>“And you know what? I’ll grow my hair out too. She’ll have to reckon with the both of us.”<br/>
“But I thought you liked your hair short?” Charlie asked with brown eyes peering up at him.<br/>
“Never tried to do anything else. Besides, if it makes my brother as happy as it does, it’s got to be worth trying at least once, right?”<br/>
Charlie let out a little sob of a laugh, nodding as he snuggled back into Bill’s chest. Bill didn’t know what had happened between the two of them that night, but him offering Charlie his solidarity felt like some sort of turning point. He didn’t fully understand Charlie, but Bill was starting to realize he didn’t have to.

All he had to do was be there and let Charlie be Charlie.</p>
