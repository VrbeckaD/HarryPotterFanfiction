    <p>Ron stumbled upon them by accident. </p><p>He’d been roaming through the Burrow, looking for his new wristwatch. It was a muggle contraption his Dad had painstakingly restored and charmed to warn of traces of dark magic in his vicinity. It was ugly and bulky and not at all Ron’s usual style, but his Dad had looked so proud when he’d given it to him for his birthday that he hadn’t had the heart to decline it. </p><p>Problem was, the damned thing had a mind of its own, always slipping off his wrist and hiding in the most difficult of places. This time, he’d spied a glimmer of its reflecting surface just off the fireplace in the small, cramped room his family jokingly called The Library. </p><p>Which is why he was now watching, hidden behind the not-quite-closed door, what he was pretty sure would lead to his brother breaking up with Draco Malfoy.</p><p>“I’m not giving up my dragons.” It was said in Charlie’s typical no-nonsense way, but it came across harsher than his brother intended, Ron was sure. </p><p>“I-,” Malfoy was shaking his head, looking up at Charlie with such open misery that Ron felt his throat grow tight. This was Draco Malfoy all right, but at this moment, he was a far cry from the arrogant boy who’d made his life miserable in school. “I’m not asking you to. Merlin, I know how much they mean to you, how deep your bond is with them.”</p><p>Charlie sighed, some of the tension leaving his broad shoulders. “Then what the fuck, Draco? We’ve been over this a thousand times, you know very well where I stand on the matter.”</p><p>“I know.” Malfoy scrubbed a hand over his face, a surprisingly rough gesture that spoke of his inner turmoil. “It’s just… I love you, Charlie, you know I do. But I can’t go back and forth like this, always having to choose between my life here and yours in Romania.”</p><p>“I thought you liked Romania.”</p><p>Ron almost snorted out loud. Charlie’s default was to assume that everyone loved Romania as much as he did.</p><p>Malfoy shook his head once, stepping closer to the other man. “That’s not the point, Charlie. Romania’s fine, your cottage there is fine, it’s just…” He laid a hand on Charlies’ chest. His fingers looked delicate as they traced the rough leather of the vest the other man was wearing. “It’s not ours, you know? Nothing is. We’ve been together for two years and yet there’s barely a trace of me there.”</p><p>“So, you want, what?” Charlie asked, obviously very much at the end of his patience. “Some decorative pillows with your name stitched on? Maybe a Slytherin shrine, green and silver all the way? Merlin’s balls, Draco, come off it.”</p><p>Malfoy pulled back at the acidic tone. “Fuck you”, he hissed, some of his old fire breaking through the carefully constructed mask of maturity. “It’s not like I’m asking for much, you arrogant prick. You didn’t even put up a single picture of us, did you notice? Not one. It’s like I don’t even exist for you.”</p><p>Ron frowned. That wasn’t true, though, right? There had to be at least some pictures of Malfoy around at Charlie’s place? And yet, thinking back on his few visits there, he couldn’t recall seeing one – or any other item that was Malfoy’s, for that matter. Huh.</p><p>Charlie slowly shook his head, wearing a – to Ron – painfully familiar expression. There had been many a lover in Charlie’s life, but none had ever been able to compete with his brother’s dedication to his work. And yet, for a while there, Ron had found himself thinking that Draco Malfoy could be the one. </p><p>“I don’t know what you expect me to do here, Draco.” Charlie sounded dreadfully matter-of-fact. “I’ve always been very clear about what I want out of this. I’m sorry if what I can give is not enough for you, but it’s not like I didn’t warn you.”</p><p>Knowing Charlie, that was very likely to be true. And knowing Malfoy, it had just as likely been blissfully ignored. After all, who could resist him, right? </p><p>There had been a time where Ron had come close to strangling him for exactly that particular kind of cheerful arrogance, but right in this moment, he wanted nothing more than for it to make a reappearance. </p><p>Instead, Malfoy seemed defeated, as if Charlie’s indifference was sucking all the strength out of him. His face was so pale it looked translucent. “I can’t do this anymore,” he breathed, voice pitched so low that Ron could hardly make it out. </p><p>Charlie frowned. The sudden tension in his body made him seem even more imposing, and suddenly it looked like he was towering over Draco’s slight form. “Do what?”</p><p>“This.” Draco gestured between them, a small aborted wave. “This travesty of a relationship where I make compromises and you just – don’t.”</p><p>The sudden storm cloud darkening Charlie’s face was as familiar to Ron as it was frightening. </p><p>“Don’t, Charlie”, he murmured under his breath, unable to help himself. “Don’t do it. Not like this.”</p><p>His plea went unheard. “Fine then,” Charlie snapped, baring his teeth in a mockery of a smile. “Let’s call it quits, yeah? I guess it has always been just a matter of time. I mean, it’s not like we were gonna get married or anything.”</p><p>Malfoy said nothing. His hands were trembling.</p><p>“Right.” Suddenly, Charlie’s wand was in his hand. “See you around, I suppose. I’d send your stuff via owl, but according to you, I don’t have anything of yours that matters.” </p><p>It probably wasn’t meant to cut as deep as it did, but Ron could see the way Malfoy flinched.</p><p>There was a minute hesitation, making Ron think his brother had come to his senses, but then Charlie huffed and shook his head. “Goodbye, Draco,” he murmured and was gone, the sudden crack of his disapparation startlingly loud.</p><p>Ron’s heart pounded in his chest. He’d always known that his brother was flighty and stubborn, commitment phobic to a ridiculous degree, but he’d never known him to be intentionally cruel. What he’d just witnessed felt exactly like that, though, and it was hard to reconcile that with the gentle dork he’d grown up with.</p><p>And Draco Malfoy, who had always been the bane of Ron’s existence, whose hubris had never known any bounds, broke. </p><p>At the first sign of tears, Ron almost turned away. It’d been a while since he’d been so close to heartbreak before, and he’d very much not wanted to repeat the experience. And yet, it also fascinated him, the wealth of emotion Malfoy displayed in that moment, the depth of what he’d been feeling for his brother. </p><p>It seemed wrong somehow for him to be all alone. Images of a similarly pale Malfoy standing alone before the Wizengamot rose, unbidden, before his inner eye. Ron had been too deep in his grief then to be able to feel empathy for the boy who had played a vital part in his brother’s death, and yet it had left a mark on him to see the youngest Malfoy break with everything he had been taught to right the wrong he’d done.</p><p>Of course, having Malfoy be an in-law of sorts had helped their relationship along as well. </p><p>“Well, that’s over now”, he muttered under his breath, and before he could think better of it, Ron stepped out of the long shadows cast by lumos-powered lamps. “Malfoy.”</p><p>Malfoy froze, then whirled away, hiding his tear-stained face from view. “What do you want?” he croaked, scrubbing a hand over his wet cheeks. </p><p>“You alright?” Ron asked, trying for a neutral tone.</p><p>Malfoy huffed out a bitter laugh. “You heard then?” He shook his head. “Of course, you did. It’s not as if anything is ever a secret in this house.” The look he shot Ron was peevish rather than nasty and Ron asked himself when Malfoy had changed into this tamed-down version of himself. “Don’t worry, I’ll be out of your hair in a minute.”</p><p>Funny, how just a few minutes ago, he’d have cheered to hear this. But thing was, he knew exactly what it felt like to be in Malfoy’s shoes in that very moment, and rival or not, there was no way he was going to let Malfoy just leave to wallow in his misery alone. “Mom will be disappointed.” </p><p>Grimacing, Malfoy murmured a quick cleaning spell and the traces of tears on his face disappeared. “I’m sure she’ll understand, given the circumstances.” His face might have been clear now, but the eyes meeting Ron’s were as dull as they had been that first day back at Hogwarts, the year after the Great Battle.</p><p>Shite. </p><p>Stepping forward, Ron grabbed the other man’s arm, halting him from lifting his wand again. “I really think you should stay. Don’t just slink off to that cold Manor of yours.” He quirked a smile at the other man. “After all, your best friend is here, isn’t he?” The fact of which was still a little awkward, even after all those years.</p><p>Malfoy shook his head, trying to escape Ron’s hold. “Let me go.” </p><p>But Ron wasn’t about to do that. “Don’t run,” he murmured. “Just, let me get Harry, okay?” </p><p>Malfoy was unsteady under his hands. His eyes were wet, but he was fighting the tears every step of the way. “I don’t want Harry. I want…” he trailed off, pressing his lips together.</p><p>“I know,” Ron murmured. Sympathy made Ron’s throat grow tight. He had vivid flashbacks to his own breakup with Hermione, remembering all too well how all he’d wanted was for the whole nightmare to be over and for everything to just go back to the way it was before. “But at least you’re among friends here, yeah?”</p><p>Malfoy lifted a shoulder, a sneer fighting to form on his face, and then someone called “Draco!”, and a moment later, Harry was there, looking all glowy and rosy-cheeked after an evening of family hijinks and great food. “There you are. I’ve been looking all over for you, Molly’s about to bring out dessert…” He looked between them, drawing his brows together. “Ron? What’s going on? Did something happen?”</p><p>Ron snorted. “Charlie is what happened, mate.” He shot Harry a meaningful glance. “Bastard just took off after calling it quits.”</p><p>“Right.” Harry shook his head, then pushed his glasses back onto his nose, a nervous habit he’d never quite been able to shake. “See, I told you this would happen. Didn’t I tell him this would happen, Ron?”</p><p>Ron nodded, because Harry indeed had warned Malfoy on numerous occasions about getting involved with his brother.</p><p>But Harry was on a roll. “I could just kick his teeth in,” he seethed. “This is just so typical for him. You know I love Charlie to death, but he can be a right prick sometimes, and he has no fucking perspective when it comes to those blasted dragons of his-” </p><p>“Harry, don’t.” The words stopped him short, soft as they were. Draco wasn’t quite looking at either of them. “Don’t say anything you’ll regret later. He’s still your brother.”</p><p>“That doesn’t mean I don’t see his faults.”</p><p>Ron had to agree. If having a big family had taught him anything, it was to take everyone as they were and to love them despite – or even because of – their imperfections. “Harry’s right,” he said. “Charlie’ll always be my big brother, but Merlin’s beard, he drives me up the wall sometimes with his selfishness.”</p><p>Malfoy’s mouth quirked. “He’s a character,” he said, sounding affectionate and so very unhappy that Ron wanted to clear his throat. “I would have lived with it all, you know,” Malfoy added, à propos of nothing. “I’d have gotten used to the damp, and to the dragon scales littering every available surface and to orange hair clogging up my drain…” He trailed off, the implications of what he’d just revealed hovering in the air between them. </p><p>Ron exchanged a quick glance with Harry, both of their eyes wide in surprise. This wasn’t how Draco Malfoy was usually like in the aftermath of a relationship gone sour. This Ron knew, because somehow, he’d ended up with a best friend who’d made an Ex-Death Eater, Slytherin snake his <em>other</em> best friend, and then his own brother had started to <em>sleep</em> with said snake, and somehow, Ron had seen far more of Malfoy over the years than he’d ever wanted to. </p><p>So yeah, this wasn’t Malfoy’s typical ‘oh well, try again next time’ reaction to being dumped and it looked like even Harry was just beginning to realize that. </p><p>Harry cleared his throat. “Draco?” he asked gently, coaxing. “What are you trying to say?”</p><p>Malfoy rubbed the back of his hand over his eyes and gave a slight half-shrug. “Nothing, just… I’ve sort of been looking at rings?” He sniffed. “I guess I should have known better…” </p><p>“Ah, crap.” Harry looked like he was about to cry himself. “Come here, love,” he murmured, not giving Malfoy the chance to pull away. He just opened his arms and gathered him in, wrapping himself around him as if he could personally soak up the pain, and Malfoy – foul-tempered, cynic Malfoy – sort of crumpled into Harry, making a low sound that Ron felt in his bones. </p><p>For a brief, crazy moment, he felt like reaching out, too. Instead, he opted for a tactical retreat, abruptly deciding that he could get his wristwatch later. “Harry,” he murmured, shifting on his feet. “I’ll go down, let the others know what’s going on. D’you need anything?” </p><p>“Nah, we’ll be fine,” Harry murmured against white-blonde hair, shooting Ron a grateful look. “Thanks, mate.”</p><p>He nodded and turned to go. He’d think of something to tell his Mom, preferably something that wouldn’t send her into a cake-baking frenzy – a break-up in the family tended to have that effect on her – and then he’d get himself a well-deserved late-night snack.</p><p>Throwing a quick glance back, he couldn’t help but be amazed at the change the relatively short time since the war had brought. At a certain point in time he’d have scoffed at the very thought of Harry Potter comforting Draco Malfoy after a breakup, and yet it was par of the course for them now. </p><p>Those first few weeks back at Hogwarts had been hard on all of them, but it had taken several years for Ron to realize that maybe Draco had struggled more than he’d been willing to see.</p><p>Not quite rehabilitated but not found guilty either, the Malfoy heir had lived a sort of half-life that consisted mostly of studying and the occasional Quidditch match. His social life was practically non-existent, and even though he wasn’t quite considered a pariah, it sure came close. </p><p>It probably would have continued on in that way, had not a certain Savior of the Wizarding World stumbled upon Draco trying to teach a First Year Slytherin how to <em>Reparo</em> his broken quill. Apparently, Draco had become quite good at mending spells, for reasons that became painfully apparent the moment they started closer attention. </p><p>He had struggled to pass the skill along, though, and the two pieces of the quill kept turning neon-green instead of fusing together under the First Year’s inexperienced wand-waving. “I’m muggleborn”, the boy had finally murmured, eyes downcast. </p><p>And Draco, despite expectations, had just nodded and repeated the correct movement. “It must be hard, never even having seen a wand before coming here”, he’d said, his face and the boy had nodded enthusiastically. </p><p>“Some of the others keep making fun of me because I know so little about the wizarding world”, he’d admitted.</p><p>Making a face, Draco had paused in his attempts to correct the boy’s white-fingered grip on his wand. “They shouldn’t be doing that. It’s not your fault you didn’t grow up with magic.”</p><p>The boy had shrugged. “Maybe not, but it still means I’m out of the loop a lot.”</p><p>Draco obviously had no idea what the ‘loop’ was in this context, but he soldiered on without commenting. “It’ll get better, you’ll see. Come Second Year, you’ll all be in the same boat. Right now, the kids with wizarding parents have an advantage because on most magical properties, there are wards keeping the ministry from detecting underage magic use. But even the most pureblooded parents wouldn’t let their kids cast anything beyond First Year spells, so that’s when you’ll catch up for sure.”</p><p>The boy had sighed resignedly. “I guess”, he’d murmured. “Right now, it just feels like there’s no way I’ll ever be as good as the others.”</p><p>Draco had looked thoughtful. “You’re the only m-muggleborn First Year Slytherin, right?” The slight stumble over the word was barely detectable. </p><p>The boy had nodded. </p><p>Draco had smirked, the familiar expression tempered by the warm glint in his eyes. “Tell you something, why don’t you read up on a book called <em>Armies of Light: Chronicling the Resistance Vol. 2</em>, pay special attention to chapter seven, <em> A mudblood’s bravery</em>, and then let me know how you feel about being muggleborn, yes?”</p><p>The boy’s eyes had glowed. At that point, everyone and their mother had written a book about the war, but <em>Armies of Light</em> was by far the most popular and infamous for its individual chapters on what the author called the <em>Hero Trio</em>. </p><p>While Ron wasn’t exactly keen on rehashing everything that had happened during the War, he couldn’t help but try to make sure that his friends were done right by the various publications, and so he worked his way through every single one of them, writing letters left and right - even getting publications pulled – until it got to a point where manuscripts had to go through him first before ever making it to the shelves.   </p><p>But even he had to admit that in a well-written book, Hermione’s chapter in <em>AoL</em> stood out. He’d been surprised that Draco would recommend it, though, as it had a rather distinct pro-Muggle tone to it that he didn’t think the Ex-Death Eater would endorse. </p><p>Obviously, he’d been wrong about that, and, bolstered by Draco’s encouragement, the next time the First Year cast <em>Reparo</em>, it went without a hitch. The two pieces of the quill snapped together as if they’d just waited for the right moment, not even a seam visible at the former break-line. </p><p>The boy whooped and squealed out an excited thanks, clutching his wand and the repaired quill to his chest and looking all aglow with his accomplishment.  </p><p>Draco had nodded and smiled and then, because he hadn’t fucked with Ron’s expectations enough at this point, he’d said: “If you ever feel looped out, you come to me. I know a thing or two about pureblood traditions.” </p><p>The boy had nodded fervently and hugged a startled Draco tightly before scampering off, looking a lot happier than he had earlier. </p><p>If Ron hadn’t seen Harry’s pensieve memory of the whole thing, he’d never have believed it. </p><p>Apparently, though, that was the moment Harry had decided to let bygones be bygones and offered Draco Malfoy his hand in friendship. The Slytherin accepted, and they were pretty much inseparable after that. </p><p>It had been hard at first for Ron to accept, this instant kinship between them, especially since it meant sharing his best friend not only with his by-then ex-girlfriend, but also with someone he couldn’t bring himself to entirely trust. By contrast, Hermione had taken the whole thing in stride - even going so far as to wave away Draco’s awkward, stumbling, and no doubt prompted, apology.   But then again, she was so caught up in her advanced study program that even her own breakup with Ron barely seemed to register. </p><p>Not that he was bitter or anything.</p><p>Looking at Harry and Draco now, it was hard to believe that they’d spent the better part of their childhood at each other’s throats. Harry had sunk into a plush armchair, taking Draco with him. The Slytherin was curled into Harry’s chest, eyes tightly closed, his wet face pressed against Harry’s throat.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, love,” he heard Harry murmur and Ron resolutely turned to go. </p><p>It was only later, with a full plate in front of him and his mother busy preparing the batter for midnight blueberry pancakes, that Ron realized that sometime between the first course and now, he’d started thinking of Malfoy as <em>Draco</em>.</p>
