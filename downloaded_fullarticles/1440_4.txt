    <p>It was cold and raining when a young wizard’s life changed forever. You would think that it’s getting your letter to go to Hogwarts, but this young wizard was too old for that and he already got his change and that did not work out for him.  No, it was the day his parents had a fight. A fight that was so loud that the young wizard ran into his older brother’s room and hugged him tightly. “It’s ok little brother. It’s ok,” his brother told him as he held him tight. The younger boy did not like hugs or people touching him but at this time, at this moment, he did not want to let go.</p><p><em>“Why don’t you take care of the little brat! He’s not a wizard and he will never be one!” </em> the brother’s father yelled to their mother.</p><p>“<em>No! I’m not taking care of him! Let's just leave the brat! Or……….”</em> Their mother’s voice trailed off as a sound filled the house. A loud boom, yes, that’s all the young wizard and his brother called it. However, that was the last thing that the brother’s heard for the house shook knocking both the brother’s out.</p><p>              <strong><em>“Scamander house up in flames.”</em></strong> That’s what was all over the newspapers all over the wizarding world. There was no news on the family that lived in this house. Which scared most wizards around. Maybe because inside this house was the children of Artemis and Marry Scamander. One was 24. While the other was 15. No one knew what happened or where they are. Time will tell, however.</p><p>             Newton Artemis-Fido Scamander. That was the boy’s name, the boy that hid with his brother that day. That cold day, or was it yesterday that it had happened. The young wizard does not know. “Theseus?” he choked out, but his voice was failing him. For he was under his brother’s bed. Newton had sensed something was wrong. He did not why or how he did, but he did. He does not know if his brother was there with him because under the bed was so dark. “Theseus…………. are………” Newton’s voice failed once again, and Newton could not speak. Not at the moment anyway.</p><p>“Newton!?” Newton heard his brother’s demanding but kind voice call to him, but he knows that he was hearing things. “Newton?! Little brother,” Newton’s eyes closed, and he passed out.</p><p>              The house was in ruin when Theseus Scamander got out of the rubble. “Newton!” Theseus called for his little brother. “Newton?” He called again getting worried. He was not too worried about his parents, however. What does that sit about him? “Newton, where are you?” Theseus called voice breaking. The good news about this was that he kept his wand close so that if he can’t find Newt, he can send his Patronus out for help. Thank Merlin he still had his wand also he had Newton’s as well. He was unsure how he managed to keep it after he got kicked out of Theseus shook his head and looked around the mess that used to be his home. His home, oh what happened? Why did this happen? “Newt where are you?” Theseus called as he looked around for his little brother, but he did not see him.</p><p>“Theseus?” Theseus’s head turned around to the sound of the voice and his heart broke when he heard someone coughing.</p><p>“Newton?! I’m coming don’t worry, stay where you are,” Theseus called as a mix of relief and fear filled his bran. Theseus then pulled apart the wood and then shined his wand onto the ground. Tears filled his eyes at the sight of his little brother. There was blood, blood on his face and arms. Theseus had to look away. Ever since the war, he could not handle blood. However, this was his little brother. “Don’t worry Newton. I’ve got you. we are going to be just fine,” Theseus said as he pulled his little brother into his arms and let the tears fall onto Newt’s blood-stained face. “I’ve got you, brother. We will be just fine,” Theseus whispered as he pulled out his wand and muttered a spell as a lion came out of his wand. “Help,” he muttered as he passed out as well.</p>
