    <p>Twas the night before Christmas and all was tranquil at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry but all Draco wanted was to bum Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Draco wasn’t an idiot. He knew Harry would never show any sort of interest in him aside from distaste, nevermind one of romantic inclinations. He was cursed to live a life he did not want to partake in.</p>
<p>From bullying Harry in his first year to becoming a Death Eater - he wanted none of it. But there was nothing he could have done; his parents would have killed him. Maybe not killed per se (Voldermort however…) but they would have been overwhelmingly disappointed in him. And Draco absolutely could not stand disappointing his parents.</p>
<p>Despite his family’s awful version of love and affection, he still loved them, even if they were fundamentally awful people. He couldn’t help it, they were bound by blood; Blood is thicker than water after all. He should have known he was doomed from the start.</p>
<p>Draco first realised the way he looked at Harry wasn’t with a look of hatred or malice but rather one of admiration and jealousy sometime during fourth year. He had always had some sort of underlying jealousy for Harry but he thought it was to do with how he was the forsaken<em> chosen one</em>. The boy who lived. He envied the attention. He envied the unnerving love Harry’s parents clearly had for him, even long after they were gone. He envied the idea of the whole world loving you for simply existing.</p>
<p>He envied Harry in every aspect he could.</p>
<p>The jealousy maybe started the first time Draco met Harry, back in Madam Malkin’s, well before the world felt so truly evil. When Draco still had optimism and so desperately wanted to be his friend. Harry had rejected his attempt at friendship when they met again on the first day of term, to what should have been no shock of his own. Draco was awful, there was no disputing that, but Harry made him want to be good, even if he was not yet aware of this fact.</p>
<p>Draco first realised his admiration wasn’t strictly platonic during fifth year, in a charms lesson of all places. It was summertime, OWLs were close and students were stressed . The classroom was sweltering hot and Harry had sweat dripping down his forehead in little beads that Draco couldn’t help but stare intensely at. He was enamoured with Harry, in such a way that could only ever end dreadfully.</p>
<p>But he couldn’t accept his admiration of Harry, he could barely acknowledge it. All he could do was repress it for as long as he could because there was not a world where he could look at Harry, not like<em> that</em>. Not like a boy is supposed to look at another boy. Not like a bloody poof.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until eighth year when he realised he was in love with Harry Fucking Potter of all bloody people. It was as if the stars had realigned to fuck him over like no other.</p>
<p>Being in love with Harry Potter was worse than any unforgivable curse. Incurable. Deadly, in an all consuming way. He loved him so much that he hated himself for loving him so deeply.</p>
<p>The realisation came about when he started to think for himself. With the war over and students returning for eight year at Hogwarts, Draco was finally beginning to think on his own. No longer a representative of the Malfoy’s and no longer a figurehead for Voldemort. He felt free. His life was finally his own, or at least in theory it was.</p>
<p>The war may have been over and he may not have been one of Voldermort’s underlings anymore but that did not mean he was free from copious amounts of teenage angst. Some things truly never change and his god-awful obsession with Harry was one of them.</p>
<p>Harry had saved his life in so many ways, Draco didn’t think he could ever thank him enough. He was the solace in his ever darkening world, the light at the end of a very dark tunnel, and the sun Draco revolved around.</p>
<p>Without Harry, Draco was not himself. But he would rather submit to Voldemort again than ever admit it.</p>
<p>Draco wasn’t sure if there was ever a self of him to begin with.</p>
<p>Harry helped him achieve a stronger sense of self than he’d ever had before. He’d always found Harry attractive, even if he wasn’t aware of it, brushing it off as general jealousy rather than attraction. And he’d always looked up to Harry in a weird sort of way, despite him not being the smartest student, Harry excelled in practical application. Almost as if Defence Against the Dark Arts had been made for him; in a way, it sort of had.</p>
<p>Harry just had so many qualities that Draco lacked but deeply wanted. From his unwavering braveness to just sheer empathetic skills, he was simply just a better person than Draco was. Draco would never amount to Harry’s level and he just had to live with that. Better off accepting it now than holding some deep-seated grudge later down the line.</p>
<p>Damned <em>boy who lived</em> just had to go and save his life and leave him with this beyond stupid (definitely more than a) crush. Bloody fucking overachiever.</p>
