    <p>Chapter one.</p><p>The evening of the 31st October 1981 saw a young boy made an orphan. Just past midnight, only a few hours later he was left sleeping on the doorstep of his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon Dursley by a tall man with a long white beard and wearing a peculiar purple cloak that swept the ground as he walked. The young child was called Harry Potter.<br/>The next morning Petunia Dursley awoke and went to do her usual morning routine. First, she got things out for breakfast, then she moved to collect the milk from the front porch, it always arrived late on a Saturday night and so it was always easier to collect it the next morning. She happily opened the front door and grabbed the milk walking back into the house, she was just about to close the door behind her when she stopped in her tracks. Was that a baby? She turned back and saw a letter on his blanket.<br/>Vernon was shocked awake after hearing a scream from his front door. He immediately ran as fast as he could, which wasn’t fast at all, down the stairs and saw his wife clutching a letter to her chest. He looked down to where she had dropped the milk and saw a baby on the floor out of the corner of his eye. He would deny it if you asked, but he had a bit of a soft spot for babies. He lent down and picked up the young child. His wife silently handed him the letter while staring at the floor in shock. He began to read the letter.</p><p align="center"> <em>Petunia,</em><br/><em>  I am so sorry to be the one to tell you the sad news, but alas, I must. On the eve of 31st October your sister, Lily, and her husband, James, were killed by the infamous wizard by the name of Voldemort. As such, their young son Harry has been orphaned. Please assure that the boy will do as I say once he enters the wizarding world, as well as putting up a fight when he is due to go. Tell him nothing of his parent’s heritage until the day he is told by either myself, or someone I have sent. Do as you wish with him, I will make sure that no one will question you or your method of raising him. I do not care for the boy, just make sure he doesn’t die.</em><br/><em>Albus Dumbledore</em><br/><em>Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorcerer, Chief Warlock,</em><br/><em>Supreme Mugwump, International Confederation of Wizards</em></p><p>He could have dropped the child. Placing the baby down he tried to keep his anger in check and told his wife to find somewhere for the “Freakish Boy” to sleep. <br/>Petunia nodded and grabbed some blankets and an old small mattress from her sisters old crib. She dumped them into the empty cupboard under the stairs. While bending down to pick up the baby she heard her own son begin to cry. The horse faced woman hurriedly put the infant into the cupboard and ran up stairs to her own child. She carried her baby downstairs and began to feed him. Once done she left the house to get the cheapest baby food possible. She knew that she would have to make sure the child did as he was told. She made a decision as she pulled into the driveway. She was going to let Vernon deal with it.</p>
