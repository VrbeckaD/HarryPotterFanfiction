    <p>It was only the beginning of October and Hermione already couldn’t accept the idea of not being the best in Potions. She observed Professor Snape complimenting Malfoy and not her so many times that she began to wish to be able to get rid of her opponent in a full-blown duel, but Malfoy was a coward, and Hermione needed to study a more cunning plan to be the best. So she had begun to approach Pansy Parkinson. The girl, after all, wasn’t so bad, even if she lacked a certain cunning that Hermione would’ve expected from a Slytherin. After two weeks, she had the first-year Slytherin lessons plan, the base of the entire plan she had schemed together with Parvati Patil in the middle of a sleepless night. Parvati’s help had been crucial, as she had brought to her hears a gossip spread by Millicent Bulstrode, laying the foundations for that crazy idea: Crabbe or Goyle, based on who had been more useless or annoying during the day, prepared Malfoy’s bag. Hermione was certain that the two idiots would’ve never dared to tell their boss they had lost one of his books and would try to replace it with one of the good copies in the school’s library, which Hermione had promptly made disappear, with Neville’s help, who, after the experience with the three-headed dog, didn’t had the courage to ask any question. Preventing any misunderstanding, Hermione had also used her influence on the sweet, tender Lily Moon, a Slytherin came to that House by mistake, apparently, and asked her to use her knowledge in Charms and to cast a Biting Jinx on the History of Magic’s books of all the other first-year students, with the promise that she would make sure that Pansy and Millicent would stop bullying her all the time. Of course, Hermione had kept her promise, made Lily’s life less a hell, and made a bet with Dean, to check that the girl hadn’t betrayed her. She had offered to do all his Transfiguration’s homework if only he had stolen the History of Magic’s book of a Slytherin of his choice, Lily excluded, since Hermione had forced her to never separate from hers. And Dean had tried, really, but he had been bitten with such force from Theodore Nott’s book that he had been taken to the infirmary and had to skip the next lesson. The complex plan, which had taken several days to prepare, was to steal Malfoy’s History of Magic book on Tuesday, as he followed that lesson before Potions, and hold him in Potions’ classroom on Friday, from which she was certain Snape would leave in a hurry, since he had given detention to the Weasley twins, who she should’ve repaid conspicously for that tacky joke on the Slytherin Headhouse. On Friday the Slytherins, after their lesson with Snape, had an hour of History of Magic with Professor Binns, who was particularly strict about carrying the necessary material, so she was sure that Malfoy would look for his book like a madman and would even listened to her, once he discovered that it was her who had the book. As expected, those who knew of her plan helped her to ensure that, at the end of the lesson, everyone would come out quickly, partly also to enjoy the Halloween celebrations for longer, and the Slytherins didn’t need to be further persuaded to leave Malfoy behind: after the first delay of almost the whole class, Binns, had taken away five points each, and the Slytherin were too competitive to lose the House Cup just to wait for a friend who didn’t treat them even then that good.</p>
<p>“Are you looking for this?” Hermione asked, startling Malfoy, and waving the book under his nose, but not close enough for him to get it.</p>
<p>“What do you want, Mudblood?” Draco asked, glaring at her. Taken alone, the boy wasn’t so brave.</p>
<p>“Your help, obviously.” she answered, enjoying the frown on his face.</p>
<p>“In your dreams.” the boy hissed.</p>
<p>“Then it will mean that I will tell Snape that you have cheated in the first theoretical task of the year.” she replied, with a victorious smile on her face.</p>
<p>“You won’t dare …” he began, but stopped immediately when he saw the determination shine in her hazel eyes.</p>
<p>“What do I gain?” he asked, finally, after a few seconds of silence.</p>
<p>“You won’t be late in class, and you’ll answer correctly to the questions the professor will ask today, making Slytherin overcome Ravenclaw in the House Cup.” Hermione replied, showing Draco the paper with questions and answers she had put on the first page of his book. The boy seemed tempted, and Hermione was more than certain that the whole situation would take place that way: he was too ambitious to throw away the possibility to shine in front of the whole class.</p>
<p>“How can you know what questions Binns will pose?” Draco asked, still on the defensive.</p>
<p>“I had History of Magic two hours ago, and everyone knows that Binns repeats the same lesson for each House and always asks the same questions. Why do you think Hufflepuff never earns points with him?”</p>
<p>Draco looked at her perplexed and Hermione rolled her eyes. “They are the first to have lessons with him, fool, so they cannot ask anyone what the questions will be. You’re the luckiest and you cannot even realize it.” she explained.</p>
<p>“I didn’t make you so cunning, Granger.”</p>
<p>Hermione tried to hold back a smile. He was calling her by last name and no longer Mudblood, it was a step forward.</p>
<p>“Now tell me what you want, before I lose my patience and decide to go tell Snape that you’re blackmailing me.”</p>
<p>Hermione wouldn’t give in to that empty threat: she knew he would never do it, not with the sentence that would have fallen on him if she revealed that he had copied during the theoretical test.</p>
<p>“I want to get the best votes in Potions.”</p>
<p>“And how can I help you? You said it, I cheated in the last test.” Malfoy replied, nonchalantly. It was disgusting how he didn’t repent for his ignoble action.</p>
<p>“Snape has a certain favoritism for you, so your presence will be enough for me.” she answered, aware she had won. “We have an agreement?” she asked, hoping to conclude. Draco answered with a grunt, but that was unmistakably a yes.</p>
<p>“See you after dinner at the Quidditch camp. And don’t think about betraying me, I still can tell him you cheated.” she replied, landing him his book. She came out of the Potions classroom without looking back, while Draco Malfoy watched, annoyed and surprised, that the girl had kept her promise about the History of Magic’s answers.</p>
