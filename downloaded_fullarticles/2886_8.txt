Or I think I'm in worm, because I don't see any worms. But this totes cool CYOA I filled out says Id be there! <br/><br/>I couldn't bring my boyfriend Draco or my friend Willow (AN: Raven dis is you!) to Earth Bet (why do they call it that is there an Earth alph?) but I was ocay because I knew one person! My super BBBFFFFFF Chris!!!!! AKAKA HOTSWAP!!!!!!!<br/><br/>I runned up to find her (bc she's a girl in this one gosh pay attention). I runned to the Protecktorate rig. "OMFG!" I said. "It's floating!" <br/><br/>"Yes," said a voice. I turned around and turned around to see a girl in a Robocop costume!!!<br/><br/>"Are you Robocop?!" I asked, turning around. <br/><br/>"No," she said. <br/><br/>"Okay!" and I turned around and went to the Rig.<br/><br/>Inside I went to the desk. "Hey I want to see my super BFFFBFBFFF Chris!!!! SHe's Hotwswap!" <br/><br/>"How did you say that word with three exclamation marks, with your mouth?" asked the dumb security guard. Pshh. He was just healuous of how muched I like MCR and GC. <br/><br/>I walked past him, turning around to find Chris's room! But she wasn't there!!!!<br/><br/>"OMFG!" I said. Then Ellen came in behind me. She was very generous when I asked wher Chris was.<br/><br/>"People should call you Ellen the Generous," I said after she explained.<br/><br/>"Thanks. Also, who the fuck are you and why are you in a restricted area?" asked Ellen but I was already on my way to find Christ.<br/><br/>ch 2: <br/><br/>AN: Fankgs to SB for bwing more supepoortive than FanFAKEshun dot net. BAck yo the storey!<br/><br/>I turned around and walked into a coffee shop. They sold coffee there. "I'd like one cofee, please!" I asked, and the cashier turned around, and it was Drago malfoy!<br/><br/>"Draco????" I asked, turning around. <br/><br/>"Who?" he said. Then I realized that it wasn't Fraco becausse I was non al aternate earth.<br/><br/>"Sorry, you look like my boyfriend." I explained.<br/><br/>"Ma'am, are you going to place your order, or what?" <br/><br/>I walked away taking black coffee (AN: black like my SOUL and also because myt name is Ebony lol) and sat down waiting for Christ.<br/><br/>Then who walked in but Chris herself!!!<br/><br/>"It's you!" I exclaimed, turning around.<br/><br/>"What the fuck who are you," said Chris.<br/><br/>"I'm your BFF!" I explaied.<br/><br/>Chris looked nervously around the room, which doesn't make sense because she's my bff, except for Willow (AN: raven dats you) but Willow wasn't in Earth Beta.<br/><br/>"Is this a fucking prank?" she asked. "Some kind of sick practical joke?" She was addressing the other patrons and Dracon. <br/><br/>I'm you ebst friend," i said. "Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way. How could you not recognize me?"!<br/><br/>Chris's face turned pale. Paler than mine after I put on my makeup. "Oh, Jesus. Repeat that name?"<br/><br/>I shurgged. "Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way." <br/><br/>"From My Immortal?"<br/><br/>"What's that?" I asked, askingly.<br/><br/>Christ put her bags on the table. "Oh, for fucks sake. I get rule sixty-three'd, and now I have to fucking deal with a crack protagonist?"<br/><br/>Chris looked at the sky. "Fuck whoever's writing this. So goddamn much." (AN: that's meaan!!!!!!!!!!!!!)<br/><br/>AN: Okay Im gonna end it here (actual A/N: because if I don't end it here, I will literally end myself. Jesus. That's painful.) Hope u liekd it!! ^^</p></div>
