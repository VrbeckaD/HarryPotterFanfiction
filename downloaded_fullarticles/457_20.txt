</center><p>Draco Malfoy wanted to apologize. Wanted to open his lips and spit out the words one after the other until they tasted better on his tongue. He thought about the words “thank you.” Considered that they sounded better and seemed easier than “I’m sorry,” but neither seemed quite comfortable. He was blank, staring, thoughts merely fleeting, one after the other. He’d nearly forgotten where he was until Narcissa lay a hand on his knee and leaned in, murmuring, “Draco, darling.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” he said, though it was something of a low grumble. The easier <em>two words</em>.</p>
<p>Amycus was dragged out of the room. Draco’s eyes caught his. He’d have thought that Amycus would put up more of a fight than he did, but instead, the man walked in shackles, led by Ministry officials, head held high, though his pace was languid enough that it was clear he wanted every last <em>moment </em>of freedom he could get.</p>
<p>Lucius was trembling. Narcissa was the picture of quiet strength. Draco looked to her; her back was straight, her gaze was forward, and her lips were pressed together in a perfect grace and sophistication. Draco realized for, perhaps, the first time that his father was nothing more than a paper man: he’d stood so proud and strong, but as soon as there was the slightest burst of wind, he crumpled underneath the pressure.</p>
<p>“Is it time?” His mother’s voice. Draco looked up to the Ministry official who was standing in front of the Malfoys, somber.</p>
<p>The official nodded. “It’s time.”</p>
<p>Draco saw his father grip his cane tighter. Lucius looked ghostly now. His eyes were sunken, his hair seemed thinner, and barely any time had passed at all. Draco, however, was entirely numb. He rose when his mother rose. Followed behind her, step after step. His father walked behind him for once.</p>
<p><em>I didn’t have a choice, </em>Draco thought, lips pressing together tightly to drown out the fear. <em>Even stupid Dumbledore knew that I didn’t have a choice. </em></p>
<p>The room seemed massive. The Wizengamot was not at all what Draco had been expecting. Potter had come here once, hadn’t he? Used magic during the summer between school years. How had he survived at such a young age? Draco couldn’t even lift his eyes to meet the gazes of those who towered above him, and he was a bloody adult now. Of course, the charges were much more serious.</p>
<p>There were arguments that Draco didn’t quite hear; blood was rushing through his ears, making him dizzy. Narcissa pulled his arm and he sat, realizing he’d been standing the entire time. Draco <em>did </em>hear one of the Ministry members argue, “Wasn’t he tasked with murdering Albus Dumbledore?”</p>
<p><em>“But I didn’t,” </em>came Draco’s voice, though it was barely audible.</p>
<p>“Speak up, son,” Lucius urged; it was clear that Lucius believed his own fate rested in the hands of the youngest Malfoy.</p>
<p>Draco’s eyes lifted, first to glare at his father, next, to the countless members of the Ministry, whose faces he didn’t recognize. “I didn’t kill the old man. The Dark Lor--<em>Voldemort</em>. He wanted me to. Tasked me with it. He would’ve killed me. My mum.” He left Lucius out, though he couldn’t be entirely certain it wasn’t on purpose. “But I couldn’t do it. That’s when Professor…” It felt wrong, somehow. Besmirching the name of the dead. “<em>Someone else </em>stepped in and did it instead.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” came a voice from above. “Professor Severus Snape, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>Draco’s moment of fiery statements halted, all words dying on his tongue.</p>
<p>Narcissa spoke up, her voice unwavering. “Draco was just a boy. He was following in the footsteps of those above him. He’s learned. He’ll be his own man from now on.”</p>
<p>“Show us.” It was a different voice. Draco’s eyes scanned the faces to see if he could spot the owner. “Show us your arms. Narcissa Black Malfoy… you never took the Dark Mark.”</p>
<p>Narcissa lifted the sleeve of her dress to show her left arm, still pristine, untouched.</p>
<p>“Draco Malfoy.”</p>
<p>Draco wondered why they were drawing this out. They knew what lay underneath his shirt. Still, jaw set and jutting forward, he pulled up his sleeve and pushed his arm forward. The Dark Mark was little more than a scar now -- <em>how do you like <strong>my </strong>scar, Potter? </em>-- settled into his skin, red around the edges, as his very own mark of shame.</p>
<p>“Lucius Malfoy.”</p>
<p>Draco’s gaze fell, following the line of his father’s movements. Lucius was slow, trembling, nothing like the man who’d once ruled the family with a fist of iron. Draco wondered why he’d <em>ever </em>been afraid of this mewling man beside of him. Lucius’s mark was healing poorly. Perhaps he’d summoned the Dark Lord one too many times. It looked burned now. Singed. A wicked reminder of his wicked deeds.</p>
<p>“Punish them separately,” a voice said. “Spare the mother.”</p>
<p>“Punish them together,” argued another. “They’re all as guilty as the next.”</p>
<p>“Punish none of us!” Lucius pled, suddenly finding his voice. “My wife saved The Chosen One!”</p>
<p><em>The Chosen One? </em>Draco scoffed. Potter had been nothing other than a name to mock, and now his father wanted to align himself with the boy? Narcissa <em>shushed </em>Draco, and his eyes and frame fell again, focusing on the floor.</p>
<p>“Yes,” a foreign voice said, “tell us how. How was it that you were able to lie to Voldemort himself?”</p>
<p>How easy it was for his name to be thrown around, now that he was dead and gone. How easy it was, once fear was excised, to pretend as though none of it had happened at all.</p>
<p>Narcissa was the picture of grace. She held herself high, made eye contact with someone that Draco couldn’t even see, as she answered, “Love.”</p>
<p>There could have been a pin that fell and landed, and everyone would have heard the echo. Even Draco looked over to his mother, her perfectly polished lips set tightly together.</p>
<p>The Minister of Magic leaned forward and pressed, “Love?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Narcissa said. “My love for my son would have allowed me to lie to Merlin himself. And it is my love for my son that allows me to make this my plea. Spare him. Spare him, and do what you must with me and my husband. But Draco has done nothing that wasn’t forced upon him. If we must die, then set us to die. If it is Azkaban, then so be it. But spare my son. I will serve his sentence, and mine. But spare him.”</p>
<p>Draco felt like a child again, and he <em>wasn’t </em>a child. He felt like he was clinging to Narcissa’s legs to escape from <em>another </em>of his father’s tirades. He could hear his father’s breath coming sharp and fast, especially when another voice from above asked, “And what say you, Lucius Malfoy? Should we spare your son at your expense?”</p>
<p>Lucius said nothing. <em>The coward</em>. Draco could not help but hold back the sneer of derision from his face. For the first time in his life, he was horrified. For the first time in his life, he saw his father for the sniveling weakling he really was. All bark. No bite.</p>
<p>“Consider yourself extremely fortunate, Lucius,” the Minister said, after far too long of a wait. “Your wife has just saved you all. One step out of line and you’ll spend the rest of your days in an Azkaban cell.”</p>
<p>There were murmurings from on high, but Narcissa took the hesitation to say, “Thank you, to all of the Ministry, for your consideration. I assure you… our records will stay clean.” She rose. Draco rose with her. Lucius’s head was hung and Narcissa took his shoulder as they walked. It wasn’t until Narcissa reached the door and saw Corban Yaxley there, awaiting his fate, that her lip began to tremble. Still, she did not cry until they had returned home and she could be in private.</p>
