  <em>-- Old Churchyard</em>
</p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>There was nothing left of Credence to bury, but his tombstone rests in a place of honor on the Graves’ estate, under the wild oak on the hill; the place Percival had chosen for his own resting place. He felt it every time he walked up that hill, sat down a spell to talk with a young man whom he had failed to save, felt the hours drag, the years stretching before him, unspooling like thread. He felt the ache in his bones, and thought it might be lingering magical damage from his weeks of captivity, or perhaps old age carrying him into oblivion finally, <em>finally</em>- but he’s not <em>that</em> old, he knows. He is… tired. He is sad.</p><p>He thinks that Tina can see it in him, <em>knows</em>, in fact, that her sister <em>does</em>. Neither one of them have said anything outright, but rather made it a point to start visiting him regularly, will often make an evening of it. There was a time in his past when Percival would have scoffed at the kindness, would have stubbornly persisted in resisting things he needed, or wanted. But he was <em>tired</em>. He never even batted an eyelash when Queenie brought her no-maj beau, Jacob. He ate the man’s pastries, laughed together with him as Newt regaled them all with tales of his Niffler, Conrad. Mercy Lewis, he’d drunk whisky with the man!</p><p>And still, through it all, he has ached in a way he cannot put into words. It is in his every look, his every gesture, the way he pours his tea or grips his cane. Like a raw, open wound that refuses to heal. Every time it becomes too much, he goes and sees Credence. He doesn’t have much else to do, these days. He’d sit with his back against the rough bark of the tree, and if the wind blew his hair from his forehead, he could so easily imagine cool fingers sweeping it back instead. Could practically feel those scarred palms against his own stubbled cheek.</p><p>A strange and troubling thought occurred to Graves as he sat at the card table in his parlor, the waning light casting long shadows through the large windows. Something that had seeped in through the cracks of his bedroom door at night, and pulled him into the depths of dreams like ocean waves. The idea that, somehow, his love should be enough; that words yet unspoken have power in them, a spark at the tip of the tongue. That, if only he should speak the words, they can light a path through the darkness so that Credence might find his way home.</p><p>In a week’s time Samhain will be upon them. The veil will be thinnest then, and Percival trembles with the realization. Queenie looks at him from across the table, having dropped her hand of cards in favor of a gaping mouth.</p><p>“Percival, you can’t mean-” she cuts herself off, probably realizing that he <em>does</em> mean, and Tina glances back and forth between them, mildly concerned at the outburst. Jacob simply looks confused, and Newt is currently out of the country, and so he doesn’t look any way at all about the situation (though if he knew, he might).</p><p>He grips his cane harder and speaks softly.</p><p>“I could use some help.”</p><p>Then, he thinks very loudly. He pictures the way Credence smiled when he saw Percival walking toward him on their third official meeting. He sees with absolute clarity the awe and wonder on the young man’s face as Percival healed the fresh welts on his palms, before either one of them had known what they were about to lose. Remembers the fine hairs at the nape of Credence’s neck, how they brushed against his fingers, how warm his skin had felt, how his sobs had settled into warm puffs of breath against his neck. He thinks of Credence until the feeling is too much for such a small, frail vessel.</p><p>He thinks of his dear boy until his cup runs over, and he is nearly undone.</p><p>“Yes,” Queenie whispers, and she is crying. “We’ll help.”</p><p>“Help what? Queenie? Mr. Graves?” Tina’s calm exterior is close to breaking, trained auror though she may be. Queenie smiles through her tears, and lets out a tinkling laugh.</p><p>“Oh, honey… <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my-aB5orbG0" rel="nofollow">we’re gonna raise the dead</a>.”</p>
