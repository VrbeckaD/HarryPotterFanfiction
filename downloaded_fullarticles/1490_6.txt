  <i>You: But why do I have to bring it to you?</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Mother Dearest: Everyone else is busy?</i>
</p><p>
  <i>You: Do u rly need it rn?</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Mother Dearest: Yes! Now get your but here.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>You: Fine but u owe me 1</i>
</p><p>You put your phone in the back pocket of your jeans as you got up off the couch.</p><p>It was your mum's fault for being so forgetful and not remembering her purse.</p><p>She was only at the garden club down the street.</p><p>You'd never been because as much as you loved plants you didn't exactly want to spend an hour every week with a bunch of middle-aged parents.</p><p>It was only ten minutes away so you decided to walk down.</p><p>When you got there everyone was listening to the instructor on how to properly plant an orchid.</p><p>As soon as your mum saw you she waved.</p><p>Not wanting to interrupt you just lifted the purse up to show her.</p><p>She smiled and pointed to your left.</p><p>There was a small row of plastic chairs. They were covered in people's bags and coats.</p><p>You immediately recognised your mum's cream handbag and headed over to it.</p><p>Just as you finished putting the purse in your mum's bag the door opened to reveal a tall, handsome boy who looked about your age.</p><p>You recognised him but brushed the feeling off thinking that he probably just had one of those faces.</p><p>You decided that it might be a good idea to wait for your mum so that you could get food with her after her garden club.</p><p>You sat on one of the plastic chairs and put the handbag on your lap.</p><p>After a few minutes of playing on your phone, your mum walked up to you and got a bottle of water and passed it to you.</p><p>"What do you want for food today?" she asked.</p><p>"Dunno. Do you want to just go to Nando's or something?" you proposed.</p><p>"A cheeky Nando's on a Wednesday. I probably shouldn't."</p><p>"Come on mum!"</p><p>"Oh alright then." she gave in.</p><p>A slim, short lady walked up to the two of you and started talking to your mum.</p><p>"...Oh yes. This is my child, (Y/N)." your mum said introducing you.</p><p>"Nice to meet you," you said, shaking the woman's hand.</p><p>"You too dear. I'm the instructor of this garden club," she explained before looking around.</p><p>"My son should be around here somewhere," she mumbled. "Neville! Come over here!" she called to the boy you saw earlier.</p><p>Right now he was carrying some garden tools to a cupboard.</p><p>He came over after putting them down.</p><p>"Neville! This is-"</p><p>"(Y/N)! Nice to see you again. How is school?"</p><p>"Good, I guess." you answered, slightly confused as to how he knew who you were.</p><p>Your mum was surprised that you knew each other.</p><p>"Alice, let's leave them to it and why don't you tell me about that vegetable garden you were thinking of getting?" she said as they both walked away.</p><p>"So how do you know who I am?" you asked Neville.</p><p>"Oh. Right. Sorry. You probably don't recognise me. Why would you? We've never talked or anything. I'm sat behind you in-"</p><p>"Potions." you interrupted. You face palmed. How did you forget the person sat directly behind you in potions for 6 years. "I'm so sorry. I'm not great with remembering people and-"</p><p>"It's ok (Y/N). I know I'm not exactly the most memorable person."</p><p>You looked at him apologetically.</p><p>"Let me make it up to you." you offered. "Dinner?"</p><p>"You don't have to d-"</p><p>"But I want to. It's on me. Come on!" you stated grabbing your stuff.</p><p>"Right now? Shouldn't you tell your mum?"</p><p>"Nah. It'll be fine. Nando's TGI Friday's?"</p><p>"Nado's?" Neville said. </p><p>"My favourite!" you replied and grabbed his hand before walking out.</p><p>"I'm stuffed!" Neville said, chuckling at your impression of Snape.</p><p>"Honestly, same!" you agreed.</p><p>
  <i>Mother Dearest: Where are you? I thought we were going to Nando's???</i>
</p><p>
  <i>You: Sorry maybe next week?</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Mother Dearest: So where are you? I saw you and Neville leave.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>You: We're at Nando's talking about school.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Mother Dearest: Ok sweetie. Be home by 10 pm.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>You: K</i>
</p><p>"I can't let you pay for this?" said Neville.</p><p>"It's fine. Honest."</p><p>"Let's at least split it."</p><p>"Fine." you gave in.</p><p>It was 9:57 pm. Neville had walked you home.</p><p>"Thanks for walking me." you said quietly.</p><p>"No problem." he replied.</p><p>"I better go. Nearly curfew." you explained.</p><p>"See you soon?"</p><p>"Definitely. See you soon."</p><p>You stepped closer and kissed Neville on the cheek.</p><p>"Bye!"</p></div>
