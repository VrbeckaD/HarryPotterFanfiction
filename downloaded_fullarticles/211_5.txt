    <p>“Oh, come on, Sirius!” Lily exclaimed, pulling Sirius out of his daze.</p>
<p>He tried to pretend he hadn’t been staring at him - Remus Lupin - but he already knew there was no point in hiding it. He couldn’t fool Lily.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you just ask him out already?” she asked.</p>
<p>Sirius had to laugh, that’s how bloody ridiculous it sounded. “Yeah,” he said. “Like someone as cool as Remus would ever like me.”</p>
<p>He doubted Remus even knew his name.</p>
<p>Lily shrugged, poking the straw into her juice box and taking a long sip before speaking: “You won’t know before you try,” she said. “Either way, you can’t just keep staring at him from across the hallway, the canteen, the bus… you stare at him all the time. It’s kinda weird.”</p>
<p>Sirius huffed, turning away from Lily. “Well, I can’t just ask him out either,” he mumbled, looking down at his uneaten lunch. “The whole school would make fun of me, for fucks sake!”</p>
<p>“You don’t know that!” Lily insisted. “Maybe he fancies you too.”</p>
<p>Sirius laughed, shaking his head. “Yeah, right,” he said. “Remus Lupin, the coolest guy in school, would definitely a fancy someone like me.”</p>
<p>Lily chuckled. “He might.”</p>
<p>“He drives a motorcycle!” Sirius reminded her, leaning in over the table. This was ridiculous. Did Lily really think-</p>
<p>“Before you murder me for this,” Lily said, interrupting Sirius’ train of thought: “Just remember I am trying to help you.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Sirius asked, but Lily didn’t answer. Instead, she turned in the direction of Remus, cupped her mouth with her hands and - before Sirius could stop her - yelled out:</p>
<p>“Oi, Lupin!”</p>
<p>The cafeteria went silent. Remus, as well as everyone else, turned to look in their direction, no doubt trying to figure out where the voice came from.</p>
<p>“What the fuck are you doing?” Sirius hissed through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Trust me,” Lily whispered, before once again turning back to Remus. “Over here!” she called, waving her hand at Remus, who seemed to finally have spotted her.</p>
<p>Sirius hid his face in his hands as Remus made his way over to their table. Most of the cafeteria had resumed their usual chatter, no longer paying attention to the commotion Lily had caused.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Remus asked, once he was right by their table. His voice had an endearing hoarseness to it: the sound always made Sirius’ heart skip a beat.</p>
<p>“Here’s the thing,” Lily said in a bold, cheerful voice. “My friend Sirius here-” as she said this, she patted Sirius’ shoulder, “-really loves motorcycles and has heard you own one. Maybe you could give him a ride? It would absolutely make his day.”</p>
<p>Why was Lily making it sound like Sirius was some sick make-a-wish kid? The only thing he suffered from was Dumbass Gay Disorder, which came to light whenever Remus was around.</p>
<p>He lifted his head, only to see Remus smirking at him and Lily.</p>
<p>“Oh, no problem,” Remus answered, chuckling as he turned to Sirius. “That can be arranged.”</p>
