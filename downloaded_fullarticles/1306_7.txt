    <p>Jacklyn Lily Potter, known more often as Jacky, was always getting in trouble. It was all because of her twin brother, Harry James Potter. The two were inseparable, even though they were in different houses. Harry being in Gryffindor and Jacky being in Slytherin, one would think that they could not be any more opposite. However, they would disagree. Maybe it came from growing up living together in a cupboard under the stairs, or maybe it was that for years they had been each other's only companions, but either way they always had each other's back.</p><p>However, while Harry was exceptionally good at magic and always got praise, Jacky was simply average. Harry was commended for defeating Voldemort, but it seemed that no recognized that Jacky had been there too. No one ever asked her about it as she had simply been a bystander. She had no scar and no attachment to Voldemort like her brother. She didn't even have any memories of their parents. She would swear that she was not jealous, especially since her brother did not want any of the attention, yet there was this small part, hidden deep down that would say otherwise.</p><p>One thing that she did have was her attachment to her brother. When their mom had put her spell on Harry, she had also put it on Jacky, tying the two twins together. She could feel his stronger feelings, when he was really scared, or when he was feeling particularly angry, and she always seemed to know where he was. It had been useful but was also a large source of frustration. When Harry was mad it made Jacky have similar feelings. It had caused unnecessary explosions from her, ones that she would have to apologize profusely for afterwards.</p><p>Throughout their first three years of school at Hogwarts, there had been many adventures. In First Year, Jacky had followed her brother down to find the philosopher's stone, throwing herself at Quirrell to stop him from hexing her brother, having the curse instead hit her. She had had to watch, paralyzed as Quirrell threatened to kill her if Harry did not do as he asked. Fortunately, Harry was able to touch Quirrell and cause him to melt away. Gryffindor had won the house cup that year, with Slytherin close behind due to her winning many house points with her sacrificial bravery. She had been teased relentlessly by her fellow Slytherins for acting like a Gryffindor, especially by Malfoy who seemed to take no small amount of pleasure in throwing insults at her and her friends.</p><p>In Second Year, she had been paralyzed, pushing Harry out of the room the Basilisk had tried to corner them in, but looking in a mirror as she did so. Her black cat, Bear, had stayed by her side, refusing to leave the hospital wing for the whole two weeks she was paralyzed. Bear was a loyal cat and a constant companion to Jacky, something that she would forever be grateful for.</p><p>In Third Year, Bear and Crookshanks had teamed up to try to catch Peter Pettigrew, their traitorous family friend. It was Bear who had first alerted Jacky to the fact that something was not quite adding up. On a Hogsmeade trip, Jacky had seen Bear rubbing up against what she had thought was the Grimm. After the initial surprise of finding out the Grimm was actually Sirius Black, and that Sirius was innocent, Jacky had been able to convince Professor Snape to not attempt to turn Sirius in. While Sirius and Snape hated each other, Snape had always had a soft spot for her, as much as a cold man like Snape could have a soft spot. She did not know why but she wondered if it had something to do with how much she looked like her mother. They had the same bright orange hair, freckles spotting her face, and bright green eyes that matched with her brother's. From what she had heard from Remus, and Sirius in his letters, Snape had been quite a friend of Lily Potter for some time.</p><p>Unfortunately, Sirius had to go on the run again. If only she had not been so injured by the smack of Remus's paw to the side of her head when he turned into a werewolf, she may have been lucky enough to say goodbye to her godfather in person as Harry had. Jacky wished more than anything that they could have gone to live with him, the Dursley's had done some truly terrible things to both Potter children.</p><p>The summer before Fourth Year had been awful as usual for the twins. They had both lost a lot of weight due to the Dursley's using restriction of food as a punishment and were constantly berated with insults to their family and themselves as wizard and witch. It had been such a relief to have been allowed to go to the Quidditch World cup with the Weasleys and escape a week of torture living with their aunt and uncle. The twins were finally free of the torturous Dursleys but were in for more than they realized when they set off for their fourth year at Hogwarts.</p><p>I have never been the Quidditch wiz that Harry was, but I have to admit, watching people fly around on broomsticks trying not to be hit by leather balls was quite entertaining. However, exerting all my energy climbing up a huge hill was not how I had to spend the day. Why we are going up this bloody hill in the first place was lost to me. Was the Quidditch World Cup so close to the Weasley's house? Fred and George had excitedly gone on about how large and loud the stadium was supposed to be, but I couldn't hear a single cheer thing. We had only just walked for an hour, surely there was no Quidditch stadium within that radius. However, after being introduced to a handsome man by the name of Cedric Diggory, Hermione, Ginny and I all looked at each other, exchanging small, knowing smiles. Everyone knew of Cedric Diggory, but he was much more charming than I had originally thought. After our meeting with the two Diggory men, with the elder Diggory fawning over my brother like every other wizard and witch did, Ginny explained that we would be taking a Port Key.</p><p>"It's a spell put on an everyday object that brings you from one place to another." Ginny tried explaining.</p><p>"Do we have to do anything special, like speak clearly when saying the destination?" I asked loud enough for Harry to hear her. He looked back and rolled his eyes, knowing full well I was making fun of him for failing his first trip with Floo powder.</p><p>"It was one time!" He complained. I laughed along with the other girls at Harry's misfortune. He really was clumsy at everything, one of the main reasons he needed someone like me there to make sure he didn't trip over his own shoelaces. I love my brother but he was, and I mean it in the most loving way possible, a hopeless case.</p><p>The Port Key ride was not what I had expected. It was like being sucked through a vacuum while spinning at 100km/h. Harry, being Harry, had almost not grabbed on in time, at the last second I managed to pull his hand towards the boot quickly and he was able to grab on. All the teens minus Cedric crashed to the ground with a hard thud. I lifted my sore head, why hadn't we gone over how to properly land before we had left? Watching as Cedric angelically floated through the air towards us did not help to ease my embarrassment. He offered her a hand when he landed beside me.</p><p>"Thanks." I said, taking his hand, my face going bright red. Of course, way to embarrass myself in front of a cute boy. Just what I wanted to do today.</p><p>The Quidditch stadium was larger than I had ever imagined. It must have been almost as tall as Hogwarts itself! Outside the stadium was miles and miles of people in old, burlap tents, everyone running around, cheering for their favourite teams. I finally understood what Fred and George had been raving on about, I had never seen so many people in one place!</p><p>Mr. Weasley ushered everyone over to a small tent. "Welcome home everyone!" He said, opening the doorway to the tent. I looked at Mr. Weasley incredulously, how were eight people supposed to fit into a tent barely big enough for two? I was shocked when I walked inside to see that it was massive! There were three separate rooms off the large main room, leaving plenty of space for everyone. Harry and I looked at each other, giddy smiles on our faces.</p><p>"I love magic." Harry said to me.</p><p>"If only we could have had this in the cupboard under the stairs!" I said, both of us giving a small laugh.</p><p>Everyone started to unpack and the celebrations began! Face paint was brought out as well as all sorts of different hats and outfits with each teams colours strewn all over them. Much to my protest, Fred and George managed to paint an Irish flag on half of my face.</p><p>"Is this really necessary?" I asked, I didn't even know if I liked the Irish Quidditch team.</p><p>"Absolutely." Said George.</p><p>"You doubt us?" said Fred.</p><p>"We would never lie to you, Jacky!" Said George, both of the Weasley twins smirking at each other.</p><p>"It's a Weasley Quidditch cup requirement." Said Fred. As it so happened it was not. Only Fred, George, and I had paint on our faces by the time we were ready to leave the tent. I gave them a withering look but held my head high and walked on. Besides, green was one of my favourite colours.</p><p>Excitement had filled the air. There were wizards and witches everyone speaking with anticipation for the match to come. We walked by hordes of people, climbing up hundreds of staircases to get to the very top, where our seats were.</p><p>You'd think with all the magic that wizards have that they would have invented a magical elevator or something? I wheezed up the stairs, not used to this kind of energy spending. One thing about being trapped in your room all summer is you don't really get any exercise and I was seriously out of shape. I eventually caught up to my brother when we were only a few more staircases from the top.</p><p>"How are you able to do this? You haven't done anything either since school ended." I asked, astounded at Harry's energy. He shrugged, a huge smile on his face.</p><p>"Just excited." He replied.</p><p>Ah yes, Harry's everlasting love of Quidditch would never slow him down.</p><p>"Blimey, dad!" Ron exclaimed. "How far up are we?" Before Mr. Weasley had a chance to respond, a familiar and very unwanted voice swiped at the chance for a snide reply.</p><p>"Let's put it this way." Said Lucius Malfoy, standing on the platform beside where we were standing. "If it rains, you'll be the first to know." I rolled my eyes. As if seeing the human embodiment of a snake was not bad enough, his son was standing right beside him.</p><p>Draco Malfoy and I had never liked each other very much. Ever since we met in Diagon Alley before 1st year we had taken every opportunity to throw insults at each other. He was a prat who took joy in putting down my friends and family, how could I not retaliate? I was forever frustrated that Snape would make us sit together, he was the best in Slytherin and I was the worst. Snape seemed to think that I could learn something from him. Instead, all that I had learned about was Malfoys weekly 'accomplishments'. Which first year he had taunted and how he had lost Gryffindor some house points. It was bad enough that we were in the same house, let alone forced to spend time together in that damp dungeon.</p><p>"Father and I are in the minister's box." Malfoy Jr. boasted, him and his father walking around the platform to where Harry and I had moved. "By personal invitation of Cornelius fudge himself!"</p><p>"Don't boast, Draco, there's no need with these people." Lucius said, using the claw end of his cane to punch his son in the stomach. As much as I hated Malfoy, I had had similar punishments doled out to me from the Dursley's and I did not enjoy seeing anyone else physically hurt by their parents. The only thing worse than putting up with Draco Malfoy was putting up with his father.</p><p>Harry grabbed my shoulder to turn me away when Lucius reached out with his cane and trapped Harry's hand on the railing. My vision went red, who did Lucius think he was, no one was allowed to touch my brother like that!</p><p>"Do enjoy yourself won't you, while you can." He said in a threatening tone. Before he could do anything else, I grabbed the cane in my hand and yanked it off my brother with a hard tug.</p><p>"Don't. Touch. Him." I growled, feeling very protective of my twin. Lucius simply smiled, but not in the way a normal person does. More like the smile of someone who has never felt happiness and instead takes happiness from other people's suffering.</p><p>"You too Ms. Potter. Have fun." He said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.</p><p>"Come on Jacky, it's not worth it." Harry said, pulling me away. I looked once more at Draco, giving my best withering look. Draco stared back and we went our separate ways.</p><p>Once we were up at the top, we could not imagine why it was a bad thing. We had an amazing view of the cheering fans and it felt like the Irish Quidditch players flew right over our heads! It was the most spectacular thing I had ever seen, outside of Hogwarts of course.</p><p>Everyone laughed and cheered as the Irish shot a great big green leprechaun into the air, it looked to be made of fireworks. It did a little jig before being exploded by the Bulgarians coming through. There was one specific Bulgarian who was doing tricks on his broom that caught my eye.</p><p>"Who's that?" I asked, having to speak loudly over the roar of the stadium.</p><p>"That, Jacky, is the best seeker in the world!" Fred exclaimed. A huge moving picture of the man was magically put over a quarter of the stadium. Everyone was cheering his name.</p><p>"Krum! Krum! Krum!" I heard them scream. Over the roar, the minister gave his greetings and the game finally started. It was difficult for me to keep up with everything that was going on as Quidditch still didn't fully make sense to me, but I could not deny that it was exciting. The players raced across the field, Irish taking the lead. They flew with such accuracy and speed that I could not help but admire. When the match was over and the Irish had won, even though Krum had been the one to catch the snitch, we went back to our tent. We laughed and ate candy, the Weasley twins danced, playing pretend instruments on the sticks of their Irish flags, and everyone teased Ron over his adoration for Krum. It was a great time to be in the wizarding community again. The support and love that I could feel was like a breath of fresh air, something I had not literally or figuratively felt for the whole summer. However, in the classic Potter luck fashion, it was over too soon.</p><p>There was yelling and screaming coming from outside the tent. There had been all night, however, this was less of a celebratory cheer and more so screams of terror.</p><p>"Sounds like the Irish have got their pride on." Fred said. At this moment, Mr. Weasley burst back into the tent.</p><p>"Stop, stop it." He said to George as he was hitting Ron with a pillow. He walked over and broke up their squabble.</p><p>"It's not the Irish." Mr. Weasley said in an urgent tone, making a pit of dread form in my stomach. Of course, we could not enjoy just one day without something happening. "We've gotta get out of here, now!" He continued, grabbing hold of Ginny's hand and ushering everyone out of the tent.</p><p>When I stepped out of the tent, the scene was worse than I had imagined. Hundreds of tents were on fire, the sky was dark and smoky, and witches and wizards were running in every direction, screaming. Spells were flying around their heads, I grabbed on to my brother's arm and took out my wand, I'd be damned if I let anyone hurt him.</p><p>"Get to the Port key!" Mr. Weasley shouted. "And stick together!" Everyone but Harry ran, staring at the carnage happening around us, he was rooted to the ground.</p><p>"Harry, come on!" I yelled, pulling on his arm, running over to where Hermione had paused to wait for us. They ran by groups of wizards in tall, black, pointy hats, long robes and skull face masks. It was one of the most terrifying outfits that I had ever seen. Caught in our fearful stare at the men in masks, we did not realize that we had been separated from the group just enough that the flow of other people around us pulled us away from our friends. It was just Harry and me now, on our own, with no idea where to go.</p><p>"Hold my hand and don't let go. We can't be separated or we won't make it." I said to my brother. He looked at me and nodded.</p><p>"Always together." He confirmed. However, as much as we tried to stay together, the stampede behind and in front of us only grew, tossing us around and breaking their grip. Harry fell to the ground, they were separated. I tried to reach my brother but I was slowly being carried away by the stampede.</p><p>"HARRY!" I yelled as he was kicked in the head knocking him unconscious. My fear spiked, feeling his distress and pain, as I watched him lay face first in the mud. Finally, with a burst of adrenaline, I screamed, fighting my way through the crowd of wizards, pushing them out of the way if necessary to get to my brother. I threw herself over his unconscious form, trying to protect him from further injury. In doing so, I opened myself up to the pains of being kicked. You'd think even in a stampede people would avoid kicking two children who were on the ground, but that was apparently not the case. And so, like my brother, I received a swift foot to the head, and I too fell unconscious. My last thought being that this really was not my best plan.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>My head throbbed when I first came back into consciousness. Why did my head hurt so much? I had a hard time remembering what had happened to me… and why was I was laying on something that was moving?</p><p>"Harry!" I exclaimed, my vision snapping back in to focus and scrambling to get off my brother's back. I heard him let out a small groan.</p><p>"Harry are you alright?" I asked, rolling my brother on to his back. He blinked blearily up at me, his hand going to rub at his head. Both of us looked around. It had gotten dark, the bright moon lighting up the sky and a thick mist had settled on the ground.</p><p>"Were you laying on me?" He asked.</p><p>"Well I was only trying to not get you stomped on any more than you already were but –" I trailed off, hearing the sounds of someone moving nearby. I didn't want to risk shouting out in case it wasn't someone friendly.</p><p>"Shh!" I whispered, putting a finger up to my mouth. Harry stilled in his spot on the ground, both of us looking towards the area where we had heard the noises. We watched in silence as a figure, one without a cloak like those that we had seen earlier, raised his wand and shouted a spell that neither of us had heard before.</p><p>"Morsmordre!" The man said, pointing his wand at the sky. A blue light shot from the end of his wand, flying high up into the sky and exploding into a large green skull with a snake slithering out from its jaw. It was horrifying and chilled me to my bones. Harry was not looking at the mark, and instead staring at the man who had cast it as if trying to figure out who he was. The man looked over their way and started to walk towards them. Bullocks.</p><p>We both scrambled to get up. We held hands, even though there was no more stampede of people, we didn't want to be separated again, and ducked behind a burnt up tent. I took out my wand, getting ready to fire a bunch of spells when I heard a faint voice.</p><p>"Harry, Jacky, where are you?" The voice called. It took me a moment to realize that it was Ron. I had never been so glad to hear his voice in her life.</p><p>"Harry! Jacky!" Hermione yelled. Even better! No offence to Ron, but Hermione was quite a lot bit better with spells and would be much more useful if it came down to a fight. I peered out from behind the tent and noticed that the man was walking away, most likely having been scared off by our friends.</p><p>"He's leaving." I told Harry. Harry breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>"We've been looking for you for ages!" Ron exclaimed upon finding us, Harry had a hard time taking his eyes off the form of the man running away. "We thought we'd lost you, mate."</p><p>Hermione ran up along with Ron and pulled me into a tight embrace. "We're so glad you're okay, we were so worried." She said. I hugged her back, starting to feel a little safer.</p><p>"What's that?" Ron asked, looking at the skull and snake in the sky. Upon looking up Harry suddenly grunted in pain, clutching at his scar. Before I had the chance to ask if he was alright, the commanding voices of many wizards and witches yelled, "Stupefy!"</p><p>Harry grabbed all of us and brought us down to a crouch, bright red flashes of the spell exploding over our heads. So much for being safe.</p><p>"THAT'S MY SON!" Came the much-needed voice of Mr. Weasley. I looked over to the ginger man charging towards us and pushing a wizard out of his way. I felt a strong love for the man at that moment, he was the kind of father I wished Harry and I had had.</p><p>"Ron, Harry, Hermione, Jacky, are you alright?" He asked urgently.</p><p>"We went searching for Harry and Jacky." Ron gave as a weak excuse.</p><p>Another man, in a large bowler hat, ran over, his wand still out.</p><p>"Which of you conjured it!" He exclaimed. "You were discovered at the scene of the crime!"</p><p>"Crouch, they're just kids!" Mr. Weasley said. I had to agree, how could this grown man think a couple of 14-year-olds were capable of doing, this serious crime he was accusing them of?</p><p>"Could you please get your wand out of our faces?" I asked, my voice dripping with disdain. Mr. Crouch eyed me warily but seemed to come to his senses and lowered his wand.</p><p>"Crime? What crime?" Harry asked. I wanted to slap my hand over my face to hide my exasperation at my brother's lack of awareness but decided it was not an appropriate time.</p><p>"It's the Dark Mark, Harry, it's his mark." Hermione explained.</p><p>"Voldemort." Harry said, the adults looking uneasy at his mention of You-Know-Who's name. Sometimes, I swore that he says Voldemort's name just to make people uncomfortable. Not that I minded the name Voldemort and would say it as brazenly as my brother, I just felt there were certain situations where you should not. For example; situations where a bunch of wizards were pointing wands their wands at our faces, was not a time where I would use a word that could upset them.</p><p>"Those people tonight, in the masks, their his too, aren't they? His followers" He asked. Mr. Weasley nodded his head.</p><p>"Death Eaters." Mr. Weasley said, addressing Mr. Crouch. Suddenly, I connected the dots. I had heard mention of Death Eaters before. There were a few people in my year whose parents had been Death Eaters. Theodore Nott, one of my best friend's father was a Death Eater. He had described the outfits and the symbol before. I was kicking myself for not recognizing this beforehand, tonight could have gone much worse than I had originally thought, had any of the Death Eaters gotten a hold of my brother.</p><p>"Follow me." Mr. Crouch said, turning to walk away.</p><p>"There was a man, before." Harry piped up. "There." He said pointing in the direction the mystery man had run off in.</p><p>"All of you, this way!" Mr. Crouch said, before him and his group of wizards ran off.</p><p>"A man, Harry? Who?" Mr. Weasley asked. Harry and I looked at each other and shrugged.</p><p>"No idea." I said.</p><p>"We didn't see his face." Harry added.</p><p>With the Dark Mark still looming overhead, we departed the now barren wasteland of the Quidditch World Cup Stadium tent field.</p><p>I had four days until we were to go back to Hogwarts. All of us were bristling with excitement at what our future would hold. I was excited to see my Slytherin friends again. Tracey Davis and Theodore Nott had been my friends since First Year. They were the only two other people in my house who were truly nice to me. We always had each other backs, and I hoped would continue to do so.</p><p>The day before the train ride, Harry and I were laying in the grass outside of the Burrow, enjoying the sun.</p><p>"What do you think it would have been like to grow up with mom and dad?" I asked, turning my head to look at my twin.</p><p>"Better than the Dursley's that's for sure." Harry said, with a chuckle.</p><p>"I imagine it would involve real bedrooms, not living under the stairs, or being treated as if we were worse than dirt." Jacky said, "The Weasley's really got it all when it comes to family. Sometimes I feel a little jealous." I admitted. Harry shrugged.</p><p>"At least we have a big family now. We may not have been with them for the first 11 years of our lives, but we aren't alone anymore. And besides, we always had each other." Harry said with a smile.</p><p>"You really are such an optimistic Gryffindor." I said, shoving my brother lightly.</p><p>"And you're a cynical Slytherin but you don't see me making fun of you for it." Harry said, his sassy attitude coming out.</p><p>"Hey!" I protested, but to my brother's credit, he was right. I had much more of a negative attitude than my twin. It may have been in part due to me taking the brunt of the Dursleys torture, trying to save my brother from the worst of it, or maybe it was that I was surrounded by cynical people all year in my house. It could also be a mix of both. Nothing I could or really cared to change now</p><p>We laid there in silence for a few moments, fantasizing about what our life would have been like had we been raised by our mom and dad.</p><p>"If only Sirius was here, then this would be complete." I said. I missed our Godfather so much. He had written to us all summer, going by the name Snuffles so no one would know it was him. I really hoped that we would get to see him again soon.</p><p>"I miss him too, but I'm sure we will see him again." Harry said.</p><p>"There we go again with the optimism!" I laughed.</p><p>"You should try it sometime." Harry said, in a serious tone, I looked at her brother and was surprised to see a worried look on his face. "Sometimes I think you are sadder than you let on. I want you to be happy."</p><p>It's hard when I can feel another person's distress. Having felt his fear while running for their lives at the Quidditch World Cup, I knew all too well the toll it took on my mental health. However, that was not the only reason. I could never understand how he was able to take the trauma of living with the Dursleys. How he never seemed to be bothered by the times that we had been thrown under the stairs, Uncle Vernon often left bruises on our arms when he did that. Or just the way that they spoke to us like we were the two worst people on the face of this planet. It really got to me after thirteen years of living with them.</p><p>"You don't need to worry about me. I'm fine, just up to my Slytherin ways." I said cheekily. We both laughed and went quiet. I loved the time when it was just us, being regular siblings and simply enjoying each other's company.</p><p>"Do you remember when we used to sneak into the kitchen at night and eat some of their sweets? Not enough for them to notice, but enough for us to enjoy it." I asked. Harry laughed.</p><p>"Of course! How could I forget? Or that one time where we took big pieces of chocolate cake and they definitely did notice. They were so angry we were locked in the cupboard for a whole week! Really it wasn't much of a punishment cause that meant we didn't have to deal with the Dursleys." Harry said, smiling at the memory.</p><p>"You've got a point there." I said. Both of us sat in silence, memories of our past flooding my mind. I secretly wished for simpler times, yet knew deep down they would not come for a long time, if ever again.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>"Tracey! Theo!" I exclaimed, having found my friends in a compartment on the Hogwarts express.</p><p>"Jacky!" They both exclaimed, getting up out of their seats to hug me.</p><p>"My dad told me about what happened at the Quidditch World Cup. Are you okay?" Tracey said, looking at me with concern as I sat down next to her. I shrugged.</p><p>"I've had worse." I said. It had been traumatic, but when was something not traumatic happening to the Potter twins?</p><p>"Though I did see the guy who put up the Dark Mark in the sky." I said. Theo froze.</p><p>"Who was it?" Theo asked, his voice sounding worried. I gave him a quizzical look.</p><p>"No idea, why?" I asked. Theo seemed to relax a little, though his eyes darted to the open compartment door.</p><p>"My dad wasn't home that night, I worry that he was there. I told you guys he used to be a Death Eater, right?" He admitted in a whisper, still seeming a little uneasy. My face softened in sympathy and we nodded.</p><p>"From the pictures I've seen of your dad and you, it wasn't him, much too thin and tall." I reassured him.</p><p>"Maybe he was just out with friends or something." Tracey offered.</p><p>"That's what I'm worried about." Theo said. We shared concerned looks before Tracey changed the subject.</p><p>"On a happier note, I hear that the Tri-Wizard tournament is coming to Hogwarts this year." Tracey said.</p><p>"The what?" I asked. I'd never heard of the Tri-Wizard Tournament before, but that was not surprising, there was still so much about the wizarding world that I had yet to discover.</p><p>"It's this big tournament where three schools pick a champion from each school and then those champions compete in a bunch of really dangerous tasks." Tracey explained.</p><p>"Oh god, I hope my brother doesn't get picked. That's the last thing we need." I said exasperatedly. Tracey and Theo gave each other a knowing look. My brow furrowed.</p><p>"What was that look?" I asked defensively.</p><p>"Nothing, just that, whether or not your brother means it, he seems to always be in the spotlight. Which often involves trouble. And then that means that you have to risk your neck to get him out of it." Theo said, trying his best to not sound accusatory. I sighed.</p><p>"You're right, I just wish that we could have one normal year." I said.</p><p>"Normal, like you could ever be normal, Potter." Came a voice from the doorway. I looked up and groaned. Draco Malfoy had stopped in front of the compartment door.</p><p>"Didn't anyone tell you it's rude to eavesdrop, Malfoy." I said, glaring at him.</p><p>"Didn't anyone tell you I don't care?" He retorted. We locked eyes, glaring at each other before Malfoy looked away.</p><p>"I hope your summer went well, Theo." Malfoy said, ignoring the glare that I was still giving him.</p><p>"It was, I'll see you in the dormitory later?" Theo asked. Malfoy nodded and glared one more time at me before leaving. Tracey got up and closed the compartment door.</p><p>"When will you admit that all that glaring leads to sexual tension?" She teased. I choked.</p><p>"Leads to what?" I asked incredulously. Tracey shrugged.</p><p>"Really seemed like you were getting lost in those silver-blue eyes of his." Tracey teased, Theo snickered.</p><p>"Was not!" I said, crossing my arms in front of my chest, feeling my cheeks blush. My friends giggled at my embarrassment. It had always been like this between us, both throwing insults at each other and a lot of glaring. Tracey had brought it up before, but I always shut her down. There was no way that Malfoy liked me and I definitely did not like him. I didn't like Malfoy, not only was he a prat who thought he was better than everyone, but he was always making fun of my brother and making our lives much harder. I would never like him, that I was sure of. No amount of glaring and teasing could ever get me to like that prat of a Malfoy.</p>
