    <p>“Oh, you.” Quirrel stood in front of a mirror Laurens was familiar with. Too familiar. A sight that confused him, hadn’t Dumbledore moved it to a safe home? This wasn’t particularly safe. His confusion must’ve shone on his face and he quickly schooled it back into a blank mask he’d perfected during the war. Quirrel made his assumptions and began wittering on with himself.  </p><p>“Snape seems the type, doesn’t he?” What? Snape? Admittedly, he had before been suspecting him, but that had fell flat after he began looking at the facts and not complete speculation, “Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor s-s-stuttering p-p-professor Quirrel?” The urge to roll his eyes behind his glasses was near overwhelming. His glasses had also become rather impractical, with his eye sight changing and the fact he was beginning to get into more fights.<br/>
To win this, he’d need some more time. He forced his voice to be confused and frightened,<br/>
“But that day, at the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me.”<br/>
“No, dear boy, I tried to kill you. If Snape’s cloak hadn’t caught fire and broken my eye contact I would have succeeded,” Thank you Hermione, he thought. It’d be horrible to die younger than his last life, “Even with Snape muttering his little counter curse.”<br/>
“Snape was trying to save me?” He hated Snape – he seems cowardly. Reminded him of Charles Lee.<br/>
“I knew you were a danger to me right from the off, especially after Halloween.”<br/>
“You let the troll in.” A scathing statement that many would be shocked to hear fall from Harry Potter’s mouth. But he wore this body like a well-fitting suit. Laurens spoke from this mouth and saw from green eyes.</p><p>His anger felt far too close to the underside of his skin, boiling his blood.</p><p>“Very good Potter,” Quirrel stood still, entirely different to his previous defining jitters, “Yes, Snape, unfortunately, wasn’t fooled. While everyone was running about the dungeons he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again he barely left me alone,”</p><p>His scar twanged, pain shooting through his head. Laurens didn’t flinch, gunshots had hurt more. Quirrel’s voice dropped to a reverent whisper. He rolled his eyes, crossing his arms over his chest.<br/>
“But he doesn’t understand. I’m never alone. Not ever.” Quirrel moved now, turning towards the mirror. Laurens side stepped slowly, shifting to look into the mirror for purely selfish reasons.<br/>
“Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire.” Alexander. He nearly keened the name aloud when he locked his eyes to those violet ones. “I see myself holding the stone, but how do I get it?” </p><p>Quirrel was pondering this question when a high, cold voice answered,<br/>
“Use the boy.” Laurens raised an eyebrow disdainfully. Quirrel flung his body around, making Laurens bite his tongue to stop the laughter that was beginning to burst from him.<br/>
“Come here, Potter!” He bellowed. He thought he should be scared. Or at least concerned by this turn of affairs. However, he never was the most stable minded man. “Now! Tell me, what do you see?” </p><p>He walked down the steps, chin tipped up imperiously. It was nearly show time. He looked up at Quirrel, slitting his eyes and sizing him up. Just stall a little longer. Flawlessly turning on the balls of his feet and stopping smartly in front of the mirror. He stood to attention, tense. Ready to strike.</p><p>Alexander smirked at the beginnings of a salute and wrapping his arms around the back of the Laurens in the mirror. His mirror image looked like he had at eleven, yet dressed in his clothes. Maybe he should dye his hair, he mused, watching as Alexander dipped his fingers into the pocket of his jeans. He drew out a red stone, winking quickly, before replacing it. He ruffled Laurens’ hair as a heavy weight dropped into that very same pocket.<br/>
He heard Quirrel draw breath to talk and faked surprise when he barked uncomfortably close to his ear,<br/>
“What is it? What do you see?” His mirror self was twenty-seven and held Alexander close, burrowing his nose into the copper locks.<br/>
That scene was his alone.<br/>
He needed a believable lie. Dumbledore had mentioned something at Christmas.<br/>
“I’m stood in between my parents.”<br/>
“He lies.” The same sinister voice from earlier. Quirrel seized the front of his jumper and Laurens concentrated on contorting his face into a frightened mask, desperately wanting to snarl. It wasn’t yet time. Soon.<br/>
“Tell the truth! What do you see?”<br/>
“Let me speak to him.” Quirrel dropped him and he took a step back up the stairs, stance widening.<br/>
“Master, you are not strong enough.”<br/>
“I have strength enough for this.” Quirrel began unravelling his turban, slowly. He obviously had a flair for dramatics. Slowly, slowly, the fabric fell away. Revealing a grotesque face. Veins stood a stark blue against the moist, sticky skin. Crimson slits for eyes and a nose in the parody of a snakes. Flat or not there at all. They locked eyes in the mirror and the pain sparked up from his scar, “Harry Potter, we meet again.”<br/>
“I’ve seen week old corpses in better condition than you.” It slipped out, rolling off his tongue as he readied himself for the fight that was sure to come. His head snapped to the side. Quirrel had slapped him and he growled quietly, clenching his fists. Soon.<br/>
“You imprudent child!” he screeched, but the Voldemort cut him off,<br/>
“I am nearly dead. Do you see what I’ve become? See what I must do to survive. Live off another and be a parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own.” Laurens rolled his eyes at the monologuing, “But there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket.” </p><p>He’d had enough waiting.<br/>
“Spin around and talk to me face to face.” He emphasised the last three words, slowing his speech mockingly. Voldemort laughed and Quirrel turned as Laurens rocked his right shoulder and arm backwards. Everything slowed. He wished for the reassuring weight of a pistol. Those eyes staring into his soul.</p><p>Now.</p><p>A feral smile tugged at his mouth and he slammed his knuckles into that smug face. The skin blistered where he connected, steam rolling off the bubbling flesh. Quirrel swore, whipping his wand out only to drop it when Laurens tackled the abomination. The world tilted and they were wrestling on the stone floor. Never had he been gladder that Wizards had terrible strength.<br/>
Straddling Quirrel’s back, he punched Voldemort again. Admittedly there might’ve been a reason he didn’t live past twenty-seven. Stupidly reckless. The skull cracked like an egg with a sound like canon fire. His hands scorched.<br/>
They screamed.<br/>
Only to be drowned out by the cries of shot steeds and whimpers of men left to die. The smell of blood, sweat, shit and gunpowder filled his nostrils. Laurens was in the war again.</p><p> Quirrel lay still underneath him.<br/>
He rolled off Quirrel, collapsing to the blood-soaked stone floor.  </p><p>As his eyes slipped closed, Alexander was the last thing he saw.</p>
