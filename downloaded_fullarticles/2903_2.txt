    <p>Hermione’s heels clacking against the stone floor were the only sound in the empty Hogwarts’ halls. She was making her way towards the Headmaster’s office at a fast pace, not daring to hope for any good news. The Unspeakables at the Ministry were delicate, yet very clear about the chances of her returning home being slim to none.</p><p>Besides the fact she had gotten herself forever stranded, there were other factors weighing in on her overwhelming sense of despair. Having any hope at all, about anything, seemed foolish. She thought it couldn’t get any worse, only to find out it could, as soon as she climbed up the steps towards Dumbledore’s office.</p><p>He was not alone. A dark figure awaited, standing nearby a trunk, clad in dark robes, raven black hair falling straight down her back. Hermione’s sharp inhale of pure shock made the newcomer turn around, arms crossed.</p><p>“D-did you call me, Headmaster?” Hermione said, weakly.</p><p>“Will you please show our new faculty member the empty chambers in the dungeons?” Dumbledore said. “I’d do it myself, but I have other matters to tend to, and I take it that you had plenty of time to get acquainted with the castle’s perils.”</p><p>“Of course. I did.”</p><p>“Professor Snape will be our new—”</p><p>“Potions teacher.” Hermione blurted out, and then realized she technically had no way to know that. “He… <em>She</em>’s here because Slughorn retired, isn’t it?”</p><p>Well, that was another thing she wasn’t supposed to have a way of knowing. Dumbledore minutely raised a single brow over his reading glasses. Hermione showed up two weeks before. Slughorn had left the castle by then, already.</p><p>“I’m glad to see you had time to get yourself well-informed over Hogwarts’ matters. I find myself forgetting, at times.” he said. “Serena, this is Hermione Granger. She will be assisting Professor Vector in Arithmancy during this term and taking you to your new rooms here in the castle. Let us hope you will get along, otherwise you’ll be forced to befriend us old hags.”</p><p>Dumbledore returned to writing down something on a parchment, letting the two young women know the conversation was over. Hermione swallowed dry and took the lead out of the office.</p><p>“Funny.” said Snape, making the hairs on the back of Hermione’s neck stand up. The tone was the very same, even though the voice was feminine, a bit high-pitched, rather than deep. “You weren’t a student at Hogwarts, were you?”</p><p>“I’m from the Salem Witch Institute. I just graduated and wanted to see what it was like in other schools.” Hermione said the lie she rehearsed. “Since I grew up around London, I thought Hogwarts would be an interesting choice.”</p><p>See, the problem with her stolen time-turner breaking during a fight with the Death Eaters was that it didn’t take her to <em>her </em>past. There were many, discreet details that were different. The more time Hermione spent stuck in that strange world, however, the more she grew to find the similarities were abundant.</p><p>Sure, Snape was a woman now, but even then, she wore the exact same black robes and had a long, hooked nose. The height and thin frame were the same, the voice, the demeanor, the way she moved.</p><p>And, Hermione was quite certain, she was, too, a Death Eater.</p><p>Voldemort existed, and so did the Order of the Phoenix and the Chosen One. Harry Potter was a year old, hiding somewhere with his parents. The Potters would be dead in two months if Hermione’s timeline of her past held up. She had no idea when, exactly, Snape started teaching at Hogwarts, but it made sense for Voldemort to put a spy inside Hogwarts at that height of the war.</p><p>Despite Voldemort having the upper hand, Hogwarts was still a safe sanctum.</p><p>“That is interesting. I didn’t know Hogwarts’ teachers could take apprentices.”</p><p>Serena made Hermione as nervous as Severus did, despite the fact whatever reasons Snape had to despise her, they didn’t exist yet. In fact, she was being rather chummy, in a way Hermione would never anticipate Severus to be.</p><p>Maybe it was the uncanny resemblance. It was hard to tell she was a woman at all, if you didn’t hear her talk and looked without paying proper attention. The men’s robes made a good job in hiding any hint of breasts — because they were made for people who didn’t have them. She was a strange woman, not pretty or beautiful in the common sense of the word, but impressive enough that it was impossible to peel the eyes away for her.</p><p>Well, not <em>strange</em>.</p><p>Just, very obviously, a lesbian.</p>
