    <p>Omega Newt is so powerful, he just underestimates the effect he has on others.</p>
<p>In New York, Newt helped MACUSA capture Gellert Grindelwald himself; he just knew what he had to do once he realized the American aurors were no match for the dark lord.</p>
<p>He lifted the enchantment that suppressed his scent and started to take off his coat to expose his pale, beautiful neck without a mark. Tina had to held back some of the alphas that were unmated; Newt’s scent was so overwhelming that some of them forgot they were aurors, trained to resist omegas.</p>
<p>But Newt had his eyes on Grindelwald, the alpha stopped cold as soon as he sniffed the air and looked back at the magizoologist. Newt was in complete submission in front of him, head tilted just at the right angle for any alpha to find it delicious.</p>
<p>Newt never told anyone, but he liked the way Grindelwald scent increased and how it seemed to surround him as the dark lord got closer.</p>
<p>“You’re my perfect match, Newton,” he purred, mismatched eyes growing dark with desire. “You belong to me.”</p>
<p>The alpha was so gone, staring at Newt with desperate want, that the magizoologist managed to take his wand, while MACUSA’s aurors captured him.</p>
<p>“You tricked me,” Grindelwald’s eyes roamed over the omega’s body as Newt put on the rest of his clothes. He didn’t look angry in the slightest, he looked delighted. “You’re perfect.”</p>
<p>Tina stood in the middle of the two and Grindelwald almost growled at her.</p>
<p>“You’re mine, Newton. I will have you.”</p>
<p>“Only if you escape,” Newt didn’t know why he said that, but he did and even Tina narrowed her eyes at him.</p>
<p>Grindelwald smirked at him over Tina’s shoulder, right before he was taken away.</p>
<p>“It’s not an <em>if</em>, darling, it’s a <em>when</em>.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When Grindelwald escapes, Newt’s brother goes completely mad; he doesn’t allow his little brother to leave the house even though Newt assures him Grindelwald is not coming after him.</p>
<p>“But you told me what he said…”</p>
<p>“That was just an alpha talking out of lust, ‘Seus,” Newt rolls his eyes at him. “I’m not the dark lord’s perfect match!”</p>
<p>Theseus protective instinct increases, Newt can smell it in the air already; his inner alpha is taking control over his rational mind.</p>
<p>“We can ask Albus if you’re so worri–”</p>
<p>“I don’t trust him,” Theseus huffs and Newt feels like he’s about to pull his hair out.</p>
<p>“You don’t trust him just because he’s an alpha. He’s my friend, Theseus!”</p>
<p>“He wants to be more than a friend, Newt.”</p>
<p>“He definitely doesn’t.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Once they set foot into Hogwarts, Theseus stays close to Newt, looking around as if he’s waiting for Grindelwald to appear at any second.</p>
<p>He grows even more tense when they reach Albus’ office.</p>
<p>“Hello, Newt,” his ex-professor greets him without turning around, which prompts Theseus to snarl. “Oh, you brought your brother with you.”</p>
<p>Despite of Theseus obvious glare, Albus offers them tea and a seat in front of his desk.</p>
<p>“Do you know why we’re here?” the omega says, making Albus smile at him fondly.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard the rumors, yes. About your encounter with Grindelwald in New York.”</p>
<p>Finally, deciding to abandon some of his hostility, Theseus asks: “Is he coming after my brother?”</p>
<p>Albus sighs, not taking his eyes off Newt’s.</p>
<p>“Most likely.”</p>
<p>“What should I do?”</p>
<p>There’s something in the alpha’s blue eyes that changes suddenly; Albus stares at Newt almost shyly right before looking at his own hands.</p>
<p>“Well… If it’s just an obsession, the alpha can lose interest if the omega is properly mated.”</p>
<p>Newt feels defeated, he doesn’t know any alpha he could mate… What if they’re not a good match? What if his alpha ends up despising him?</p>
<p>“Could it work?” Theseus says, suddenly curious.</p>
<p>“Maybe. If the alpha is powerful enough. Otherwise Grindelwald would want to kill them to get them out of his way.”</p>
<p>“Definitely not, I’m not going to risk anyone,” Newt frowns. “I’ll think of something else.”</p>
<p>“I can do it,” Theseus offers, prompting Albus’ to quirk one of his brows at him.</p>
<p>“He’s your brother.”</p>
<p>“It’s not unheard of among our people.”</p>
<p>“I won’t let you risk your life for me, 'Seus.”</p>
<p>“Your brother is right, Mr. Scamander,” Albus looks back at Theseus. “What Newt needs is a wizard powerful enough to protect him.”</p>
<p>“An equal to Grindelwald, huh?” Theseus narrows his eyes. “How convenient, Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>Both alphas are on his feet now, looking rather tense at each other. Although Albus calms himself down first.</p>
<p>“I was about to talk to Newt about it, yes. If that’s what you’re implying, Mr. Scamander.”</p>
<p>“Talk about what?” The omega looks confusedly at them both. Albus’ eyes stare back at him.</p>
<p>“I can be your alpha, Newt.”</p>
<p>“No,” Theseus crosses his arms over his chest, at the same time Newt shakes his head.</p>
<p>“I won’t risk you like this, Albus.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a risk. Trust me, Newt. Besides, I want to. I’ve been planning to court you for a while now…”</p>
<p>“I don’t think this is a good idea, little one.”</p>
<p>Newt looks up, deciding to ignore Theseus; Albus smiles at him and Newt knows he’s not lying and he also finds out his inner omega is very much pleased at the idea of mating Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>His omega seems to find powerful alphas very much attractive.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he says after a couple of minutes, blushing furiously after noticing how hopeful and happy looks Albus at the mere thought.</p>
<p>“I promise I’ll take care of you, Newt.”</p>
<p>“Little one, you should think about it first–”</p>
<p>But Newt doesn’t need to, he knows it’s the right choice. Besides, that has to be enough for Grindelwald to forget about him, right?</p>
