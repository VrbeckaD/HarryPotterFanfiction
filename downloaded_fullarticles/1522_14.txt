    <p>It all began in sixth year. Harry had found himself much too interested in every move that one Draco Malfoy was making, trailing after the blonde near constantly and finding excuses to be in the same location.</p><p>Hermione tried to convince him that either A) Malfoy was doing no wrong and should be left alone, or B) Harry was attracted to the blonde and needed to either get over him or do something about it. Neither of these situations were ones that Harry was going to accept, it seemed.</p><p>This particular stalking event - because in all honesty, stalking was exactly what he was doing - Harry found himself creeping through the hallways after Malfoy bypassed potions class and made a great effort not to be seen heading for the dungeon bathroom. He had nearly lost sight of him, but there was no mistaking the voice coming out of the bathroom.</p><p>Harry found himself slinking inside as quietly as possible, though the sight that greeted him was not what he was expecting - Draco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching either side of the sink, head bowed and shoulders shaking.</p><p>“I can’t do it… I can’t…”</p><p>Harry realised that Malfoy was crying – actually crying – tears streaming down his cheeks. The realization made the hair on the back of Harry’s neck stand on end, and his heart lurched at the pain he was witnesses. The blonde gasped, knuckles turning white as he clutched the sink and, chest heaving, he lifted his head and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder. Twisting around and drawing his wand, Malfoy found his hand shaking as he squared off against Harry. Instinctively, Harry pulled his own wand.</p><p>The two stood facing one another, hands gripping their wands tightly and waiting for the other to make the first move. He looked so broken, Harry admitted, seeing the defeat already written across Malfoy’s face. It was almost heartbreaking and the brunette found himself lowering his wand, no longer wanting to fight.</p><p>“Malfoy…” he spoke softly, tucking his wand into his pocket as he slowly approached the Slytherin, offering out his other hand.</p><p>“Stay away, Potter!” came the response, and while he still held his wand up and at the ready, his heart clearly wasn’t in the threat. Silver eyes watched emerald as Harry gently placed his hand over Malfoy’s, curling his fingers around the other’s shaking digits as he coaxed him to lower his wand as well.</p><p>“Let me help you,” he whispered, stepping closer. He surprised himself by using his other hand to gently wipe away the tears, though he wasn’t surprised when Malfoy jerked his head back.</p><p>“You can’t help me.”</p><p>“I’m the Chosen One,” Harry replied with a small smile, trying to ease the situation. “I can do anything, and I can save anyone, even annoying gits like you.” Oh yes, very smooth, insult him at the same time you offer to help him, that’s going to make everything okay. Well done, Harry.</p><p>His body was moving on autopilot, it seemed, this time cupping Malfoy’s cheek with his hand and gently wiping away the tears with his thumb. The two stared at one another as Harry released Malfoy’s wand hand and used his now free hand to make the same gentle motions on the opposite cheek.</p><p>“He’s going to kill me…” Malfoy tried, but Harry shook his head, moving his hands down over the blonde’s shoulders, across his chest, and coming to rest on slender hips.</p><p>“I won’t let that happen, Malfoy,” he promised, taking one final step forward to nearly press his body against the other teen’s. He was shorter, of course, but the motion was clear and as he lifted his chin, Malfoy allowed his forehead to rest against Harry’s.</p><p>“Why…? I’ve done things… I’ve been a terrible person…” The tears were starting again and Harry found his hands moving on their own once more, one remaining on Malfoy’s slender hip and the other lifting to one more cup his cheek.</p><p>“You haven’t done anything you can’t be redeemed for,” he answered honestly, feeling his heart beat faster as Malfoy leaned into his touch, silver eyes slipping closed. “Let me save you…”</p><p>“You can’t save him, Potter.” The voice startled both young males and Harry twisted, putting his body between Malfoy and the other male who had entered the bathroom, wand once more at the ready. Professor Snape sneered at him, waving a hand nonchalantly.</p><p>“Put that away, boy,” he said with a sigh, making no move to withdraw his own wand. “And step away from Mr. Malfoy.”</p><p>“I can save him!” Harry protested, refusing to move away from the boy he found himself suddenly very protective of.</p><p>“The only thing that will save him is not something you are capable of, nor would you be willing to do,” Snape looked down his nose at the brunette, unmoved by his plea. Harry gripped his wand tighter, his free hand moving behind him to rest on Malfoy’s hip, as though wanting to assure the blonde that everything was going to be okay.</p><p>“It’s my job to save everyone I can,” Harry asserted himself.</p><p>“Draco is destined to give himself to the Dark Lord,” Snape almost hissed, his voice dropping low. “His soul is the Dark Lord’s to take. The only thing that would prevent such actions is for him to be soul bound to another person.”</p><p>“Then I’ll do that!” Harry found himself speaking before his mind could fully process what he was hearing, nevermind the fact he honestly didn’t know what being soul bound to someone meant, or would entail.</p><p>“Potter…” Malfoy began, slowly moving out from behind the brunette and away from Harry’s gentle touch.</p><p>“I told you I would save you,” Harry responded quickly, twisting to face the blonde who was seemingly trying to escape.</p><p>“You’re just saying words, Potter. All words and no actions.” Snape seemed to only be egging Harry on, the smaller male reaching out to take Malfoy’s hand in his own once again. He once more tucked his wand away so he had a free hand available to touch Malfoy’s hip.</p><p>“Make it happen, Snape,” was the almost biting response, though Harry’s eyes never left Malfoy’s.</p><p>“Always jumping into things without knowing the consequences,” the Professor muttered, moving his gaze to his godson.</p><p>“This agreement goes both ways,” he continued, pointing a finger at the blonde. “YOU don’t know what this ancient magic entails either. Are you going to agree to this?”</p><p>“If I don’t… they’ll come for me… they’ll make me…” the words caught in Malfoy’s throat and he felt his emotions rising and threatening to spill over once more.</p><p>“Let me save you,” Harry insisted once again, squeezing the hand that he held. The two sixteen year olds observed each other for several moments before Malfoy nodded, turning to face Snape.</p><p>“Do it.”</p><p>“You’ll regret this,” Snape tried once more, heaving a large sigh. “Both of you will. Once the spell is cast, there’s no going back. Unless one of you dies, of course. Probably Potter.” Such an offhanded comment, though he lifted his wand once more and approached the pair, even as Harry scowled at him.</p><p>“I don’t want to be evil,” Malfoy almost whimpered, the fear very apparent in his voice. Snape’s face relaxed slightly and he released another sigh, this one much less frustrated.</p><p>“Draco… This is going to change your life in ways you don’t understand. As much as I want to see you taken away from your family’s way of life... “ his voice trailed off and he knew he wasn’t going to be able to talk either Draco or Harry out of their rash decision.</p><p>“I am more than the Malfoy name,” Malfoy said firmly. “Just tell us what we need to do.”</p><p>“Stand facing one another,” Snape instructed. “Grip each other by the wrist, arms crossed so you each form an X before gripping each other.”</p><p>“I’m going to owe you a big one, Potter,” Malfoy muttered, the two doing as they were told and gripping each other by the wrists. Harry shook his head, his eyes looking somewhat sad.</p><p>“What good is being the Chosen One if I can’t save at least one person who deserves it?” he asked, his voice sincere. “We can go back to hating one another as soon as this is over.”</p><p>*****</p><p>Sixth year was… terrible, and even that felt like a vast understatement. Harry was miserable, and as he turned seventeen and life progressed, things really only got worse. Even under the influence of the Horcrux, he seemed even more on edge than anyone would have expected. How Ron and Hermione put up with him was unknown, but he appreciated that they stuck with him through all of it.</p><p>Even with the fall of the Dark Lord, Harry still felt unsettled and antsy. He found himself sitting on the front steps of Grimmauld Place, chin in his hands, elbows resting on his knees, watching the world go by while he was hidden by the magic which concealed the building.</p><p>July was one of the hottest on record and while he knew he could easily cast a spell (or several) to banish the hot air and cool the house, he had yet to replace his wand. Part of him wished he had been smart enough to keep the Elder Wand, but disposing of it had seemed a safer bet.</p><p>Sirius had been trying to take his godson to the Alley to get a replacement wand, but Harry was sure it was just a ruse to get him new school books. He had missed his final year, after all, and the seventh year students affected by the war had been offered an ‘eighth’ year if they wanted to complete their schooling.</p><p>“I was thinking we could start renovating the house,” Sirius came to stand behind Harry, leaning against the open doorway and squinting in the sun. The older man was finally starting to look, and feel, ‘human’ again as he was no longer sickly skinny and had cleaned up his features.</p><p>“Harry? Are you listening?”</p><p>The brunette found his attention drawn to the park across the road, one hand drifting to touch the center of his chest as he felt something pull at him. Silver eyes found his and Harry’s eyes widened, seeing Draco Malfoy standing across the street from his home. It was only because Draco and Snape had spent time in hiding at the house that Draco could see past the wards that kept Grimmauld Place safe. He could see Harry and Sirius. The blonde stood, unmoving, with one hand gently touching the center of his chest.</p><p>“Draco…”</p><p>“Malfoy? What’s he doing here?” Sirius frowned, tilting his head ever so slightly, though he was more caught off guard by his godson moving to his feet and leaving the front steps.</p><p>“Harry?”</p><p>Harry barely glanced each way as he stepped out to cross the street, walking directly towards the blonde who stood unmoving. A car honked, coming somewhat close to clipping Harry’s heels, but he didn’t even notice. It wasn’t until he was nearly stepping on Draco’s toes that he realized he had crossed the road, surprise coloring his face.</p><p>“Why… why are you here?”</p><p>“Severus told me to come,” was the reply, Draco looking away for a moment as though embarrassed. “He… told me about what we did, in sixth year. It all makes so much more sense now.”</p><p>“What we did?” Harry frowned, finding himself unable to resist reaching out towards the blonde, though he caught himself before he made contact. Why in the world did his chest hurt? Why did he feel almost compelled to wrap Draco in his arms?</p><p>When had he became Draco and not just Malfoy?</p><p>“Can I come in?” Draco motioned towards the house, and the doorway where Sirius still stood, watching the two from across the street.</p><p>“Oh! Of course!” Harry felt flustered, reaching out and taking Draco’s hand before leading him across the street and up the stairs of his home. Sirius raised an eyebrow at the pair but said nothing, stepping aside as Harry lead Draco inside.</p><p>“Everything okay?” he asked, expecting the pair to make their way to the livingroom and instead being surprised when Harry lead Draco upstairs and towards his bedroom.</p><p>“Fine then, ignore me,” the older male muttered, returning to his original space on the couch. He, too, was without a wand and even with the windows open, the house was stupidly hot.</p><p>Draco followed Harry without complaint, not that he hadn’t been in the house before and didn’t already know where they were heading. Though he was sure their conversation could have easily taken place in the living room, or even the dining room, but he wasn’t going to complain.</p><p>“How bad have the headaches been?” he asked quietly, moving to sit on the end of Harry’s bed as he watched the other male close the bedroom door.</p><p>“How…”</p><p>“I’ve had them, too,” he sighed. “Since sixth year, actually, but they’ve been getting progressively worse. I thought maybe it was the war, you know? Severus has been keeping me safe and away from my parents ever since we were soul bound.”</p><p>“Soul bound?” Harry frowned, choosing to kick off his shoes and sit at the head of his bed, crossing his legs.</p><p>“That’s the spell Severus cast on us, in the bathroom,” Draco explained, shifting to remove his shoes as well and turn towards Harry, sitting fully on the bed. Long legs clad in denim were pulled up against his chest and he curled his arms around his knees, leaning forward ever so slightly.</p><p>“The spell he said would save you from Voldemort.”</p><p>“Yes, that one. He was right, you know, when he told us we had no idea what we were getting into. Soul binding is ancient magic… most witches and wizards have never heard of it, and it’s mostly only seen in old texts held by pureblood families.” Draco felt like he was rambling, picking at a worn spot on the knee of his jeans.</p><p>“Soul binding links two people together, for life,” he continued. “The well being of those involved are essentially woven together. It used to be a spell used instead of marriage, back when marriage wasn’t really a thing. Being soul bound to someone meant that your life was in their hands, and vice versa, and that you were to be together… forever.”</p><p>Harry was staring, he knew he was, his heart racing in his chest as he took in what Draco was saying, processing it in his mind.</p><p>“Being apart causes the soul bound to become irritable, on edge, antsy, and sometimes even physically ill. Like the headaches.”</p><p>“And Snape only revealed this recently?”</p><p>“I came to him about the headaches,” Draco sighed. “Potions weren’t working and I thought maybe he had something stronger… Turns out the headaches and insomnia isn’t something easily cured, and certainly not by potions.”</p><p>“So… we’re married? Essentially?”</p><p>“Well, it’s not like we can’t go shag other people… but being apart will wear us down more and more the longer we stay apart.” Draco knew this wasn’t what Harry was wanting to hear - the two of them were no longer enemies, but they certainly weren’t friends. They had been civil to one another while Draco and Severus had been staying in Grimmauld Place, even if Harry hadn’t been there very often after sixth year ended.</p><p>“I haven’t really thought about any sort of relationships,” Harry admitted. “I mean, Ginny approached me after the final battle, and we kissed, but it just…”</p><p>“Didn’t do it for you,” Draco sighed, knowing exactly what the brunette was talking about. He had also attempted to make romantic connections, but between being a Malfoy and the effects of the soul binding, or so he assumed, nothing had ever felt right.</p><p>“Because of the soul binding?” Harry asked, though he sighed as though he already knew the answer.</p><p>“Pretty much. Severus says the effects can be tamed by physical connections, like being in close proximity to one another. Holding hands, hugs, that sort of thing.”</p><p>“Sex?”</p><p>“Well, yes, that’s the general idea of being soul bound. It’s a lifetime commitment, usually made by couples who fancy one another. We only opted into the binding because one had to have an open soul in order to follow the Dark Lord. They needed to want to serve him and have no other ties that would prevent them from doing so. My soul belongs to you, and vice versa.”</p><p>Harry felt like his head was spinning and he once more found himself pressing a hand against the center of his chest, as though such a simple action could make everything calm down.</p><p>“I feel it too,” Draco sighed, touching his own chest. “The pull… the longing… the dull ache… like something is missing, inside.”</p><p>“I thought it was just the after effects of the battle,” Harry told him. “I never knew longing was such a real thing. It sounded like something girls giggled about, or people wrote about in fairy tales and romance novels.”</p><p>He reached out, gently taking one of Draco’s hands and tugging the blonde towards him. He didn’t have to explain, or instruct, the other boy simply crawled up towards where Harry sat. Foreheads pressed together and silver eyes met emerald green as they felt the tension within them begin to ease, simply from the contact.</p><p>“Spend the night?” Harry asked softly, managing a sort of half smile. “I think we could both do with a good rest, considering the information we’ve been given.”</p><p>“Agreed,” Draco nodded.</p><p>“I’ll get Sirius to pick up some take out and we can eat and process everything,” Harry smiled.</p><p>*****</p><p>Remus, Severus, and a white blonde male Harry didn’t recognize joined the three current Grimmauld Place residents that evening, Harry hugging Remus with a smile while Draco embraced his godfather, followed by the rather attractive blonde.</p><p>“You all made it,” Sirius grinned. “I was worried I had purchased way too much Chinese food, though I’m sure between the two of us, Harry and I could have made a substantial dent.” The shaggy haired male motioned for everyone to come through to the dining room, gently touching Remus’ hip as the smaller man walked by.</p><p>“I suppose introductions are in order,” Severus said as he pulled out a chair for the older blonde, though the other male remained standing in order to introduce himself.</p><p>“Maximus Maxwell,” he smiled, leaning forward to offer a hand out towards Harry. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, finally. I’ve heard plenty about you over the years.”</p><p>“You have?” Harry lifted an eyebrow, shaking hands with a somewhat confused look on his face. Everyone else sat down, making it known that introductions were only needed when it came to Harry.</p><p>“Severus, and then Draco, have spoke very highly of you.”</p><p>“They have?” More confusion, making Sirius chuckle and Severus roll his eyes. Draco found himself sitting next to Harry, subconsciously moving their chairs a bit closer together.</p><p>“Max is Severus’ husband, Harry,” Remus explained.</p><p>“Snape is married?!”</p><p>Draco groaned, reaching up to rub his temples. He was soul bound to a complete idiot.</p><p>“Yes, Potter,” Snape said with a highly unamused look. “For nearly twenty years now, actually.”</p><p>“Eighteen, to be exact,” Max supplied.</p><p>“I thought you were stuck on my mother!”</p><p>“I was,” Severus shrugged, nudging his husband’s chair in a tad more before he sat down as well. “She was the only woman I ever loved, and when I finally figured that out… I realized someone else had captured my heart.” Max rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Sev makes it seem a lot less romantic than it was,” he assured the brunette. “Lily and I were friends, actually, and while I didn’t spend a LOT of time with your parents, Harry, I knew them well enough. And I knew Lily well enough. And through her, I met Severus. If only he had kept his hands to himself until we had graduated, though.”</p><p>Harry fumbled the spring roll he had been collecting from the mass array of open take out containers that were spread across the dining room table. The fried torpedo of food bounced off the edge of the container and made itself a new home on Remus’ plate, making the scarred male grin.</p><p>“You are giving Potter way more details than I really think he needs,” Severus muttered, transferring food from the containers to his husband’s plate before he made any attempt to feed himself.</p><p>“Perhaps teenagers nowadays need this sort of warning,” Max grinned. “With his relationship with Draco only going to grow, they should be aware of what could happen.”</p><p>“I don’t have a relationship with Harry,” Draco tried to protest, even as he found his foot touching the other boy’s.</p><p>“You will,” Max continued, pushing back his long blonde hair. “Soul binding is what got Sev and I into trouble and it’s no doubt going to cause issues.”</p><p>“You two are soul bound?” Draco found this surprising, adding some vegetables and sweet and sour pork to his plate. Severus nodded, though he seemed reluctant to admit this.</p><p>“James made a mistake…” Remus said softly, biting his bottom lip for a moment. “There was a duel, and an accident…”</p><p>“Snape nearly died,” Sirius continued. “That Sectumsempra spell is very dangerous, and we all learned that the hard way when it bounced off James’ shield spell and reflected right back at Snape.”</p><p>“Soul binding does a lot of things,” Max said between bites of fried rice. “It can protect someone from giving themselves to the Dark Lord, like Draco, but it can also save someone from death. I was the only one who could offer my soul to help Severus. Professor Slughorn was never any good under pressure, and certainly not with healing spells… and Severus was the only one who knew how to counteract Sectumsempra anyways. But he knew how to soul bind us, and while I wasn’t with Severus at the time, I didn’t hesitate when he gave the option.”</p><p>“That’s how you know so much about soul binding,” Draco breathed, though he hadn’t realized he had been holding his breath in the first place. His godfather nodded, gently resting his hand on that of his husband and giving a light squeeze.</p><p>“Soul binding requires a connection between the two who will be bound, and it’s more than just a friendly connection.” Max spread his fingers and laced them with Severus’, smiling at the other male. “We didn’t know it at that time, but we each had a crush on one another. The soul binding just… made it official.”</p><p>Draco glanced at Harry out of the corner of his eye, finding the brunette to be staring at his plate of food.</p><p>“Well… eat up, everyone,” Remus tried to sound encouraging, but the tension between the two teenagers was almost something one could feel, and it wasn’t a nice feeling.</p><p>“How about we talk about the outcome of Mister Handsy, eh?” Sirius grinned, making Max blush brightly as once more the attention was on him and his husband.</p><p>“I… got pregnant in school…” he winced, trying to smile but it looked incredibly awkward. “We didn’t know that the soul bond could do such a thing, and it was certainly a surprise for the Healer that was brought to the school specifically to see me.”</p><p>“But… you’re a boy…”</p><p>“Yes, Harry, quite astute of you to notice that my husband is indeed sporting a penis,” Severus snipped. “Magic can do all sorts of things, and ancient magic is no different.”</p><p>“Well, it’s not like we’re going to have that problem,” Draco spoke softly. “It’s not like we’re going to be having sex or anything.”</p><p>Sirius quirked an eyebrow and found Harry suddenly pointing at him with a ‘shut your mouth, old man’ type of look.</p><p>“Silence.”</p><p>“Just sayin’, Harry,” he grinned. “I mean, from what Severus and Max have been saying, you can’t soul bond without a connection. Clearly there’s something between the two of you and it might take a while but it’s going to happen.”</p><p>“Don’t pressure them, Sirius,” Remus sighed. “If they do, or don’t, find themselves getting together, that’s completely up to them. They don’t need to be harassed by any of us.”</p><p>“I’m not harassing them!” Sirius protested, though he was quickly silenced Remus.</p><p>While everyone focussed on their food, dinner lapsed into a somewhat uncomfortable silence. Utensils clinked against plates and Harry suddenly noticed that Draco was using chopsticks, not a fork. He found himself drawn to the simple action, surprised that a pureblooded wizard would know what chopsticks even were, let alone how to use them. Long fingers wielded the thin sticks with precision and grace, bringing bites of food up to Draco’s mouth without much thought.</p><p>“Did you want some?” Draco was offering Harry a bite of his sweet and sour pork, offering it out, clasped between the chopsticks, while his free hand hovered underneath, just in case. It took Harry a moment to realize what was going on, a flush crossing his cheeks as he found himself leaning in and accepting the bite of food, the action making Draco smile. It was a nice moment… until Sirius squealed like a fangirl.</p><p>Eighth year couldn’t come soon enough.</p>
