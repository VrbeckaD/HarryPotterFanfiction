    <p>Ron was being even more frustrating than usual that day. He sat, shoveling food into his mouth, spraying everyone with mashed potato while blathering on about the Chudley Cannons and their prospects now that some star Chaser was back from a bludger induced head injury. His hand movements were becoming more and more urgent, despite the looks of disgust that Lavender and Parvati were shooting him. Harry had his usual glazed over eye look. Ron began to wave the <em>Evening Prophet</em> in front of his face.</p><p>"....and then once we sign Aidan Lynch from Kenmare,-he's moving to England anyway you know because his son will be starting Hogwarts in a few years and his wife wants to be 'close to her son' or something, even though it's really just a floo away isn't it?- wait what was I saying?"</p><p>"Something about once Aidan Lynch joins the Cannons" Hermione said with a sigh, turning the page of her book and resigning herself to further rants about Quidditch.</p><p>"Oh yeah, thanks Hermione" Ron smiled as he ruffled his hair " Once Lynch joins the set up - he is a bloody good seeker don't let the World cup fool you, he was up agaisnt <em>Krum</em> that day!- The Cannons will really be on the rise. I think we might have a chance not this year but maybe next year"</p><p>Despite the brief look of distaste on Rons face when Krum was mentioned, he hadn't been so enthusiastic or happy about anything in a long time. The death of Sirius and the Battle of the Department of Mysteries had been hard on all of them. Physically for Ron- he still had scars from the brains- and mentally for Harry who was even more reserved than usual this year. Hermione realised early on that she needed a distraction, something else to focus on beyond school work, she had found one in the library during the first few weeks of school. While Ron continued to discuss wonky feints and Aidan Lynch's record catching the snitch, Hermiones attention was quickly drawn to her distraction whistiling as she left the Great Hall in a sweep of yellow and black. Although it wasn't a Tuesday, and she really should have been studying, Hermione jumped up out of her bench. Ron looked up puzzled.</p><p>"Oh, so sorry Ron but I do have to get some study in tonight. I think I'll head to the library" Snapping her book shut and pushing it into her bag, Hermione swung the bag onto her back and made to leave before Ron grabbed her arm.</p><p>"You don't have to go tonight d'yu? We haven't talked like this in ages have we Harry?" His eyes were wide and his lip pouting. Harry made a unintelligable noise which Ron took as aggreement. "C'mon study can wait, just stay here with us"</p><p>Hermione felt her stomach drop in disapointment, and then guilt. She should <em>want</em> to spend time with Harry and Ron. At the moment though, she had someone else completely on her mind. Smoothing out her robes and clearing her throat she spoke in the most diplomatic tone possible  "I'm sorry Ron,- and Harry- but that Charms essay on the <em>Auguamenti </em>charm is due on Friday and I want to get a good start on it before tomorrow in case I get Arthimancy homework, but this weekend is Hogsmeade! We can talk more then"</p><p>Ron looked as unimpressed as Hermione felt during his Quidditch talk and gruffly said "Bye" before Hemione ran out of the Great Hall, her robes flying behind her and relief swarming in her stomach. Just as she made it through the third archway a tug on her robes sent her tumbling to the ground. Hermiones head hit the stone floor and her eyes scrunched closed as she heard a ringing in her ears. Instinctively reaching for her wand and expecting to see Malfoy or Pansy Parkinson above her she pointed her wand upwards.</p><p>"Oh Merlin! Are you okay? I'm sorry, I'm so so sorry- here let me take a look at your head" </p><p>Hermione felt herself be tilted upwards and opened her stinging, bleary eyes. Holding her was Eliza Fawley. Her <em>distraction</em>. Her wide eyes raking over Hermione while biting her lip she took out her wand and swept it over Hermiones body. Her eyes narrowing in concentration and then darting back up to meet Hermiones. Ice blue and brown connecting. </p><p>"That was just a diagnostic spell, I'll fix you up now" Another wave of the light wooded wand, this time over the back of her head and the word <em>Vulnera Sanentur </em>said with clarity left Hermione feeling less woozy. Eliza once again apologised "I'm so sorry I just wanted to pull you into my arms like one of those stupid Celestina Warbeck songs, I didn't think you would fall!" She bunched up her cloak and used it to wipe the tears off of Hermiones face.</p><p>"You are so unbearably and habitually silly" Hermione pushed herself up out of Elizas arms and started walking ahead. Eliza hurried after her and swung her arm around Hermiones shoulder with one arm and loosening her scarf with her other hand. Once the Hufflepuff scarf was no longer around her neck she wound it around her arm and used it to whip Hermione.</p><p>"Oh- stop it would you?" Hermione said with a small smile "Why did you even have that on? The castle isn't cold or anything"</p><p>"Well I had to gain your attention somehow, and yellow is a pretty bright colour so I thought if I walked past your table enough you'd stop drooling over Weasley and look at <em>me</em> for once" It was said with jest and Hermione knew it, but that didn't make the words any less maddening. </p><p>"I was not drooling over Ron" Hermione growled, grabbed Elizas hand, and linked their fingers together as they made their way up the stairs to the seventh floor. She placed a kiss on Elizas lips and clenched her hand tighter. "Why were you wearing the scarf, really?</p><p>"Well I had to hide these, now didn't I?" Eliza said blushing, with her free hand she pushed her blonde hair away from her neck to where there were deep purple bruises dotted around her neck. </p><p>"Why didn't you just heal them or something, I can do it now if you want" Hermione went to get her wand out of her robes but was stopped by a chuckle from Eliza. </p><p>"Well, its just that you're very possesive... I didn't want to upset you by getting rid of them" Eliza almost made it through her sentence with a straight face but failed, her face lighting up and her chest shaking with laughter. </p><p>"You wore a scarf all day so that you could say that to me didn't you?"</p><p>"Yes" </p><p>"Unbelieveable. I surround myself with idiots and Quidditch fanatics" Eliza rested her head on Hermiones shoulder and smiled leaning into her.</p><p>"I'm both!" Eliza said and hopped up the remaining steps backwards, she was particularly energetic today and it showed in how wide her eyes were.</p><p>"You aren't fanatical about Quidditch" Hermione knew that Eliza <em>played</em> Quidditch. She was a beater for the Hufflepuff team, which Hermione was made very aware of whenever she traced her fingers down Elizas arm. The wiery muscles protruding from her arms were <em>simply lovely</em>. "You play, you don't talk about it at all"</p><p>A very serious look came over Elizas face and she slowed down, waiting for Hermione to reach the top of the stairs. "Thats because you find it really boring, me and Zacharias talk about it for hours in the dormitory" </p><p>Hermione felt the corners of her lips curl up and realised how much she appreciated the girl in front of her. "Talk about it now" she grabbed Elizas hand and drew her whole body into herself.</p><p>"Well, there's talk that Aidan Lynch, the Irish seeker is moving to an English club. Personally that would be terrible for the Kestrels. So I decided to start a petition to send to the owners of the club to convince them to not sell THE ONLY international standard player playing for us. All the Irish students in Hogwarts have signed,And because of my family name, Father thinks it will be accepted by the club owners for review. However it would also be terrible for Irish Quidditch. We need as many of our top players playing in Ireland to provide a good network for the young players coming through,the youth system. Most of the money in Quidditch is centered around the English clubs which is just pure corruption, because the people on top in the Department of Magical sports and games are all English and pump money into their favoured teams"</p><p>"I thought Ron said Lynch wanted to move to England? because his son is coming to Hogwarts"</p><p>"Nah thats just code for the 'Kestrels aren't paying me enough'. Hopefully though with this pressure the owners can see how much we need him on our team and find a few galleons somewhere. At least until I leave school and take over the Department to fix all of this corruption" Eliza ended her statement with a clap of her hands and a lick of her lips.</p><p>Hermione looked up and realised they were at their destination, they walked up and down the corridor three times until a door appeared. "Well I do love taking down corrupt systems, so if you need help I'm in!" Hermione would always support Eliza, she still wore Hermiones S.P.E.W badge with pride over her prefect badge, and she showed interest in things well past what most usually saw. It was heartening and refreshing.</p><p>As they dragged each other inside the room, filled with a large yellow and black bed ,gold and red pillows and vanilla scented candles. They giggled and crashed their lips together tugging one another closer, ready for a very thorough study session. For which the finished charms essays in the corner of the room could attest for.</p>
