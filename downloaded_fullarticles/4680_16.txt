    <p>"Gryffindor" The loud cheer came from the third table as a response. The orange haired who sat on the stool could be oddly be mistaken for a Weasley. </p><p>The Sorting Hat was softly taken off his head and was placed right back down on the stool next to Professor McGonagall.</p><p>The boy proudly made his way to the table, plopping right down next to the friendly twins who began to evilly grin at him like a Cheshire Cat. Their beaming smiles were mischievous almost like they were ready to jump on him any point. </p><p>The boy turns to look around thinking how surreal it was to him. To be in a world filled with magic, and it was actually real!</p><p>"Slytherin" A close-mouthed cheer came from the last table. The orange haired boy named Jimin looked around confused, trying to find the source of the cheer. His very own table didn't seem as thrilled as another one joined another ranks. </p><p>The boys hair was one of mint, which suited his house choice very well. The mint boy makes his way silently and precisely, almost like a snake, to his table. The orange haired boy follows the mint's trail as he slides his way in the middle of Malfoy and Parkinson.</p><p>He places his own face in between his hands already looking bored for a 12 year old.</p><p>"Harry Potter." </p><p>The hall fills with the whisper of all, students and teachers. The rumour of the Harry Potter coming to Hogwarts was true. </p><p>The raven hair looked slightly confused with the added fuss with his name. Nevertheless, he made his way, reluctantly, to the stool and had the Sorting Hat take its place on his head. </p><p>The Sorting Hat seemed to take a longer time to decided them most, making people anxious to see the result. Jimin could see Harry vaguely moving his lips, whispering to the Hat. </p><p>'Is he telling him which house he wants? Is it rigged?' Jimin thinks to himself, growing more and more jealous by the second.</p><p>"Gryffindor!" </p><p>Harry slid the hat off his own head and handed it back to the Professor. </p><p>The huge congratulations from the Gryffindor house traveled throughout the hall as the raven haired boy quickly making his way to the space next to Jimin. </p><p>'I wonder, why is he so famous in his first year?' Jimin ponders to himself. </p><p>Jimin was a muggle-born at heart. His parents were delighted when they found out their son was the first magical being in the family during the time Jimin received his acceptance letter to Hogwarts. </p><p>He would often do accidental magic when he was younger that led to his parents trying researching the matter. </p><p>When Jimin bought his books, wand and school uniform, he didn't realize how much of a disadvantage he was at. </p><p>During the last couple of weeks, he was only able to catch up with some simple charms spells, and a bit about potions ingredients. </p><p>"Who's that?" With Jimin's pondering, he was only able to catch the end of Harry's question or the rest of the peoples houses.</p><p>Jimin notices there was another Ginger next to Harry who was probably another Weasley. And there was a bushy brown haired girl with peculiar large front teeth. </p><p>The person from Harry's question was a Professor dressed in darker than black robes, he was talking to another Professor in similar purple robes with a matching turban placed on his head.</p><p>"That's Professor Snape. He teaches potions, but we all know he's looking at the Dart Arts position. He knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape" George says turning his head - he had been talking to his brother, and meet Harry's eyes. </p><p>"What about the other one?" Jimin blurts out, turning bright red when realizing his outburst. The right Weasley twin slowly turn to him and answers his question as well.</p><p>"The other is Professor Quirrell, he's the Dart Arts Professor." He grins. But Jimin didn't pay any mind to that as Harry starts to wine, holding onto his scarred forehead. It seemed like it was burning him. </p><p>"Are you alright?" Jimin worriedly asked, holding onto his arm. As Harry seemed to be shaking his head out of confusion. </p><p>"Yeah" He draws out, Jimin could tell he was just confused as him so he decided to distract him.</p><p>"I'm Jimin Park, and your Harry Potter, right?" Harry nods his head slightly.<br/>
"Why are you so famous?"</p><p>Several gasps were heard around the Gryffindor table. </p><p>"What?" Jimin looks around in confusion. Did he ask the wrong question? </p><p>"You don't know the Harry Potter" Hermione, the curly brown haired girl spoke from next to Neville. </p><p>"What's wrong with that?" Jimin pouts. </p><p>'I knew I should of read up on History of Magic before the slightly cooler stuff' He thinks to himself. </p><p>"He defeated He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named. He's a hero in the wizarding world"</p><p>"Oh okay" Jimin's shoulders slouch and he tried to make himself appear small. </p><p>After that everyone went back to their meals. However, Harry looked right back at Jimin to stare with a slight smile on his face. At least one person would like him for him. </p><p>When Jimin looks up again, he spots the green haired boy talking quietly to a blonde haired boy on the Slytherin table. </p><p>He looks back towards his meal and slides it away from himself. </p><p>✘✘✘</p><p>The Prefect's lead each of their houses to their new common room. Jimin followed behind the Gryffindor named Percy, another Weasley. </p><p>The Gryffindor's started towards the East Side of Hogwarts, Gryffindor Tower. </p><p>Ravenclaw went to the opposite side of the castle, the West Side of Hogwarts, Ravenclaw Tower. </p><p>Slytherin, The Dungeons. </p><p>Hufflepuff went towards the Basement near the kitchen. </p><p>The group of first years start to slow down until they stopped in front of a Fat Lady's portrait. This was it.</p><p>"Caput Draconis"</p><p>What? </p><p>The portrait opened to allow the first years and Percy through.</p><p>"It means Dragon's Head in Latin" Percy replies to him. Jimin looks around bewildered until he realized he was the one that said it.</p><p>"Um, thanks" He politely thanks. The orange haired boy then hides behind Harry to engage in less conversations. </p><p>The group makes their way forward scrabbling to make room for everyone to see. </p><p>The common room was a circular shaped room painted with the Gryffindor colours, red and gold respectively. </p><p>The room was packed with armchairs, tables and a large couch in front of a fireplace  mantle with an engraved lion, representing Gryffindor.</p><p>The walls were also plastered with Gryffindor flags and posters. There were also multiple windows letting a lot of light into the room. </p><p>The student bulletin board held ads for Quidditch, Herbology after school etc.</p><p>"All of your belongings should be stationed in your room"<br/>
"Boys dormitories are located on the right set of staircase. The girls are on the left"</p><p>"There's a charm on the girl staircase which doesn't allow any of the boys up there. That should be it" Percy quickly turns around and stomps up to his room.</p><p>All of the first years make their way to their rooms. The moon was rising as it was growing closer and closer to midnight. </p><p>Jimin heads to his room, seeing his trunk and his cat, Jas. </p><p>"Jas!" He exclaims, running over to his calico cat to cuddle her to his chest. Jas starts to purr, bringing her head closer to his neck. </p><p>✘✘✘</p><p>Jimin Park ended up sharing his room with Harry Potter, Ron Wealsey, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom. </p><p>They all settle down to bed, waiting for their day of magic learning at Hogwarts.</p><p>Whilst, Jimin sat himself down near the window, stroking his cat. All he could think about was He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named and the mint haired boy in Slytherin. </p><p>He had no idea why.</p>
