    <p>
  <span>Pandora Black was staring at the TV, long after the breaking News came on. She didn't know how long she was staring at the TV, as her father turned it off long before. She wasn't sure if she even was looking </span>
  <em>
    <span>at</span>
  </em>
  <span> the TV or </span>
  <em>
    <span>past</span>
  </em>
  <span> it. They were all sitting around the TV when it came on, saying that a convict escaped. “... Black is armed and extremely dangerous…” She looked at her parents, who were sharing a look. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When she stood suddenly, they both flinched. “That's not… Black is a muggle name, too. Right? Just like…” She thought back to all of the pureblood families. Weasley, Malfoy, Potter, Black, Parkinson, Goyle… Shed never heard of those names before Hogwarts. He swallowed thickly. “He's related to me, then?” They didn't seem to say a first name that she remembered. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don't know, sweety.” She silently thanked her mother and father for being so patient with her. The end of last year, her father told her that her father, while they didn't know his name, was a really bad person. He killed a lot of people in the street which is why she was out up for adoption. She was adopted by them at three and they hoped they would never have to tell her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“God, why does my whole family have to be bad guys?” She huffed as she sat down on the floor, laying back. It seemed like everything was going wrong at once. She wasn't allowed to see Harry- his guardians rules. The last time she saw Hermione, she became so red that Hermione sent her home thinking she was sick and now a crazy relative of hers escaped prison and was on the run. Who knew where he was or who else he would hurt? Did he know about her? Would he come after her because he knew they were related?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Not only that, but her body started changing and she woke up a few nights ago sticky and groggy. Thinking that it was just sweat, she went to the bathroom and when she looked down, she screamed. Her mother was the first one in, who she cried that she was bleeding. She was then told that it's the natural process of a young woman's body. That was not a fun morning, filled with talks of blood and babies. She definitely didn't like that conversation. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After dinner, Pandora walked up stairs to Ria, her cat who was curled up on her bed. The feline grew much bigger in the summer, stretching in length and growing in size. With a great purr, Ria stretched out again, turning. Pandora sat down and began to pet the cat's soft fur.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She sat petting Ria until a tap on the window made her jump. She looked up to see an owl with a letter. When she read it, she jumped around, excited.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was from Hermione! </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Pandora,</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>I hope this letter finds you. I've just been informed that I will soon be going shopping, just as soon as I get my letter. I was wondering if you would be allowed to do your shopping at the same time that I do, and maybe we could be able to stay at the Leaky Cauldron until it is time to make our way to the train station. If you don't write back, I will be taking a room at that place and will wait for you to arrive. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione was inviting her to stay at the Leaky Cauldron so they can go shopping together! Excited, Pandora ran down the stairs loudly, tripping on the last one and falling down. Her chest and face hurt very bad as she sat up. Her nose was running, so she just wiped it as she ran into the living room. “Mum! Hermione wants to-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What happened to your face?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I fell down the stairs, I'm okay. Hermione wants me to go shopping with her when we get our letters. She's also staying at the Leaky, so she wants to know If I can stay as well.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don't see why not.” Pandora shouted out and jumped, her nose running more, so she wiped it again. It kind of hurt, but that could've been from the fall. “But can we get you cleaned up?” Her mum motioned to her hand and she looked. It was covered in blood. With a hand to her face, she realized her nose was bleeding. She chuckled nervously as she was lead to the kitchen. “Your recklessness is going to get you seriously hurt one day, Pandora.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She smiled sheepishly as a paper towel was pressed to her face to soak up the blood. It was interesting to her to see such a dark, crisp red on the white sheet. She sat there studying the color as her mother pressed another to her face. She looked at her mother, then. She hadn't really looked at her face in a long time. Kelly had deep red hair and pretty brown eyes. She had the start of wrinkles at her eyes, giving her an aged look, and she held laugh lines.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She was well in her thirties when Pandora was adopted, and that was ten years ago. Maybe age is playing a toll on her. “I love you, mum.” Her mum looked at her, straightening her back. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I… I love you, too. Are you okay?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I just figured you needed to hear it. I do love you.” Suddenly, Pandora was pulled into a tight hug. Her mother pulled her flat against her body in a tight embrace. It felt good to be held so tightly, and Pandora melted into the motherly comfort.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I love you, too, Pandora.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I think… I might want to change my name.” She was cautious. “I might take your name.” Kelly had tears in her eyes as she hugged Pandora tight again. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We'll give you this year to think about it, alright? You have this school year to think about it.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright.” </span>
