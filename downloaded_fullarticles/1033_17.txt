    <p>Wordy sighed with relief as he settled into a kitchen chair and once, <em>just</em> once, let Shelley bring him his breakfast.  Usually he didn’t like to make his wife do any more work than she already did, but after a hectic, busy week packed with hot calls and enough overtime to send the HR department running for cover, he was willing to make an exception if it meant he could stay off his feet for a couple minutes.</p>
<p>Shelley smiled at him as she brought his plate over, piled high with his favorite homemade pancakes, bacon, and sausage.  “Scrambled eggs?” she teased, her eyes dancing at the immediate shudder; Wordy did <em>not</em> like eggs and avoided them every chance he got.</p>
<p>“Very funny, Shel,” Wordy retorted, pulling his breakfast closer as if to guard it from any nearby scrambled eggs.</p>
<p>His wife laughed as she retrieved her own plate; their daughters already had their own breakfasts and the ungrateful brats were snickering at their father’s near legendary dislike of eggs.  Wordy pretended not to hear the laughter, adopting an air of studied disregard and focusing entirely on his meal.  Then Lilly tried to sneak some of the scrambled eggs from her plate onto his; Wordy whisked his plate out of range and brandished his fork threateningly, drawing shrieks of laughter from the three co-conspirators.</p>
<p>Lilly widened her eyes innocently.  “Eggs are good for you, Daddy.”</p>
<p>“They’re poison,” Wordy countered.  “Everyone who eats them dies.”</p>
<p>Naturally, this drew renewed shrieks of laughter from his girls and an eyeroll from Shelley.  The brunet constable made sure to keep his fork handy for defending his plate as he worked his way through his meal, jabbing it in the direction of whichever daughter was trying to sneak eggs onto his plate and earning giggles with each jab.  Shelley stayed out of it, though she enjoyed the play just as much as her husband and daughters did.  He was so good with them, even when he was exhausted and probably wanted nothing more than to have another eight hours of sleep.</p>
<p>She was collecting the plates and debating the best way to keep the girls busy enough that Kevin could have some time to himself when the doorbell rang.  Ally took off for the door, determined to beat her sisters, and Kevin hastily went after her; the youngest Wordsworth had yet to learn that just because someone rang the doorbell didn’t mean she should open it.</p>
<p>Shelley quickly finished her task by stacking the plates on the counter – she could put them in the dishwasher later – and followed her husband and daughter towards the door.  Ahead of her, she could hear Kevin chiding Ally for trying to open the door without even looking to see who it was.  Ally pouted at her father and Shelley sighed to herself; she’d have to have a good talking-to with Ally – again.</p>
<p>Kevin looked through the glass; Shelley saw his shoulders stiffen.  “Kevin?  Who is it?”</p>
<p>He glanced back at her, but she couldn’t read the emotions playing across his face.  Then he pulled the door open, his stance subtly changing from <em>father</em> to <em>cop</em>.  “Can I help you?” he asked the woman just outside, caution ringing in every syllable.</p>
<p>She smiled back, but it was a professional smile with only a hint of warmth.  “Mr. Wordsworth?”</p>
<p>“That’s me.”</p>
<p>“I’m here to speak to you about your daughter, Claire Wordsworth.”</p>
<p><em>Oh, Lord, they’re here!</em> Shelley realized.  Although the woman was dressed like a techie, there was a faint unease on her face, as if she wasn’t quite comfortable in her own attire.  Couple that unease with the barest hint of disdain in her eyes and the stranger bore all the usual hallmarks of a witch trying to blend into a world she didn’t have the first clue about.</p>
<p>“About what?” Kevin questioned, leaning against the door jamb and arching a brow as he crossed his arms.</p>
<p>Another smile, just as shallow and meaningless as the first.  “I represent a rather exclusive school, Mr. Wordsworth and young Claire, it so happens, meets our entrance requirements.  Perhaps I might come in so we can talk further?”</p>
<p>Kevin shifted to the side after an instant’s further consideration, silently inviting the graying blonde witch inside.  She wore a business outfit that looked like it dated to the 1980s – at <em>best</em> – in a fortunately fairly neutral shade of gray.  Her face and frame were a bit plump, giving her an almost motherly look and her hair was carefully arranged to enhance her motherly appearance.  The woman wore flat shoes instead of high heels, something Shelley approved of: flats were much better for day-to-day use than high heels tended to be.</p>
<p>“Ally, go get your sisters, please,” Shelley requested, sending her daughter off and meeting the witch’s eyes, a challenge glittering behind the politeness.  Ally darted off, somehow discerning that her parents wanted to speak to the newcomer alone.</p>
<p>“What a charming child,” the witch gushed, a flash of smugness there and gone; if Shelley had blinked, she’d’ve missed it.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Shelley replied nonetheless, gesturing their guest towards the living room.  “What sort of school do you represent?” she inquired casually.</p>
<p>The witch’s expression turned indulgent.  “All in good time, Mrs. Wordsworth.”</p>
<p>Shelley and her husband traded looks, then Shelley’s eyes widened, ever so slightly, as she realized what was going on.  The witch didn’t know!  She didn’t know that their family already <em>knew</em> about magic, <em>knew</em> that all three young Wordsworths were witches, or that Kevin was a former Auror.</p>
<p>The blonde woman noticed her husband’s devious smirk out of the corner of her eye.  The prankster in him was coming out to play.  And Shelley found she didn’t mind one <em>whit</em>.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Wordy leaned back on his couch, playing dumb for all he was worth.  Shelley’s eyes gleamed with laughter and his daughters were covering their mouths to suppress their sniggers.  For his part, the constable adopted an air of <em>extreme</em> skepticism as the witch in front of them produced a parchment envelope with a flourish.  “Magic?” he drawled.  “You want me to send my daughter off to a school so she can learn card tricks?  How to pull a rabbit out of a hat?  Maybe saw a few people in half?”</p>
<p>Lilly snorted as the visitor’s expression turned indignant with a generous helping of offended mixed in.  Ally opened her mouth to remind her father that they already knew magic was real; Claire elbowed her sister to keep her quiet.  At Ally’s outraged look, Claire hissed, “Don’t spoil it!” as softly as possible.</p>
<p>Briskly, the witch pulled her wand, an action that had the brunet tensing for action, ready to move at a bare moment’s notice.  Fortunately, his slight shift and tense muscles weren’t noticed; The visitor pulled a small glass orb from her oversized handbag and tapped it.  The glass shifted form, becoming a glass hummingbird that took flight for a short trip around the living room.  Rather than returning to the witch, the exquisitely crafted bird flitted to Claire, hovering in front of her with little cheeps of what sounded like curiosity and interest.  Claire reached out, stroking the hummingbird’s head; her sisters crowded in to pet the hovering glass animal as well.</p>
<p>Wordy stole a look at the witch and bit back a snicker of his own; the witch was gawping in utter astonishment at the three girls and the bird.  Definitely not how she’d planned her demonstration, though Wordy couldn’t see why – a <em>living</em> glass animal?  That was a near <em>perfect</em> way to demonstrate that magic was real without scaring innocent techie families half to death.  A soft chittering sound drew the constable’s gaze and he jumped; the glass hummingbird was hovering right next to his face, studying him intently.</p>
<p>The bird’s head reached forward, its beak just grazing his wrist as he automatically shifted back and lifted one hand to keep the animal away from his face.  Wordy’s eyes widened in shock as color spread over the hummingbird, starting from the animal’s beak and sweeping over the glass in seconds.  The color rapidly highlighted something else; the hummingbird, far from being smooth, unbroken glass, was almost exactly like a <em>real</em> hummingbird, complete with glass feathers, miniscule glass claws, and an intelligent glitter in its black eyes.</p>
<p>“Well, upon my word,” the witch breathed, watching the glass hummingbird flit over to Shelley, then back to the girls.  “In all my years, I’ve never seen such <em>instinctive</em> control over accidental magic.”</p>
<p>Wordy bit back a derisive noise; it was obvious to him that the woman had <em>no</em> idea how her creation had gained a life of its own and she was bluffing her way through as best she could.  Frankly, if he had to guess, <em>his</em> guess would be that the hummingbird’s behavior had more to do with the traces of Wild Magic around his whole family than anything his girls were doing.  Leaning forward, he arched one brow and drawled, “<em>Accidental</em> magic?  How do we know <em>you</em> didn’t do all that?”</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Claire jerked back in surprise as her father was dismissed as an obstructive annoyance and the witch turned towards her.  Leaning forward, the woman asked, “Have you ever made anything happen?  Anything you couldn’t explain?”</p>
<p>“Y-y-yes,” Claire stuttered; the intent expression on the witch’s face was rather unnerving to the young girl.  Her Dad stiffened, his protective instincts going on full alert, and Claire knew he would step in if he thought she needed help.  But she was a <em>cop’s</em> daughter and she wasn’t afraid of a snobby, arrogant old witch.  The brunet tilted her chin up, setting her jaw into lines her father’s teammates would’ve recognized <em>instantly</em> as Wordsworth tenacity at its finest.  Brown eyes gleamed and she gave the stranger a defiant look.</p>
<p>The witch smiled at Claire, ignoring the defiance as she held out a parchment letter.  “Not many people can do what <em>you</em> can do, Miss Wordsworth.  Your talent sets you apart and it takes a very <em>special</em> type of school to teach you how to use your abilities.”</p>
<p>“My talent?” Claire inquired, taking the letter, but not opening it.</p>
<p>“You have magic, Miss Wordsworth,” the woman explained.</p>
<p>“And how,” her father’s tone was scathing, “do you know <em>that</em>?  I don’t remember signing my daughter up for any witchy tryouts.”</p>
<p>Claire bit back a laugh, but couldn’t help but notice that the witch lady was ignoring her Daddy, as if he didn’t matter at all.  It made her mad to see firsthand how most magicals treated techies, but she didn’t dare say anything; it would ruin the prank.  Behind the stranger’s back, her father tossed her a wink and nod, encouraging her to open her letter.</p>
<p>The little hummingbird hovered downwards, trilling its own encouragement as she carefully worked the letter open, trying not to destroy the seal.  The brown wax seal, stamped with a Canadian maple leaf that was crossed with a quill and a wand, with the school’s motto around the outer edge, was a throwback to the days of old, when every letter of importance was sealed with wax.  The parchment gave way and Claire pulled the letter inside out, opening it up and eagerly reading the contents.</p>

  <em>“TORONTO SCHOOL OF MAGIC</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Headmaster: Tristan Staghorn</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Dear Miss Wordsworth,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at the Toronto School of Magic. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Term begins on 1 September.  Please give your response to the representative promptly.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Yours Sincerely,</em><br/>
  <em>Delia Eldorne<br/></em>
  <em>Deputy Headmistress”</em>
</p>
<p>The young girl frowned as she inspected the letter – why was she being told to just give her response to the representative?  Didn’t she have time to think things over?  Biting her lip, Claire stood up and took the letter to her Dad, slipping in beside him as he glanced over the parchment, his eyes turning shadowed as he spotted what she had.</p>
<p>Anger colored his words.  “This says we have to decide today,” he pointed out flatly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Wordsworth,” the witch confirmed.</p>
<p>Gray eyes snapped and Claire shifted back to be out of the way.  Slowly, he pushed himself to his feet, glaring at the gray-blonde woman in their living room.  Without an ounce of humor or playfulness, he questioned, “So, if we don’t say ‘yes’ right now, you’ll <em>Obliviate</em> us?”</p>
<p>Claire smirked as the witch’s jaw dropped open.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Despite the fury rolling just under his skin, Wordy smirked at the witch’s shocked expression, mirroring his daughter’s expression.  He let his sentence hang, but cocked his head to the side sardonically.  <em>Well?</em></p>
<p>Slowly, the witch’s chin came up, anger glittering in her eyes.  “You <em>know</em> about magic?” she nearly shrieked; her creation fled behind Lilly and Ally, chirping in alarm.</p>
<p>Wordy’s smirk widened, though he chose not to speak; he merely gave the gray-blonde an impatient look, silently demanding an answer to his question.</p>
<p>The woman rose to her feet, embarrassment, indignation, and a curious rage mixing on her face.  “Well then,” she snapped, “I leave you to consider your options, <em>sir</em>.”</p>
<p>With a <em>crack</em>, she was gone, leaving a bemused former Auror, three astounded little girls, and one <em>highly</em> unimpressed mother behind her.</p>
