    <p>“I do,” Ginny said, smile bright.</p><p>“Do you, Harry James Potter, take Ginevra Molly Weasley as your wife, to love and to cherish, to provide and care for, for the rest of your days?”</p><p>Harry was already crying for everyone to see, staring blankly at Ginny. After a moment of silence, Ron stepped forward and gave Harry a nudge. “Oh! Yes, I do. I do.” A giggle rang out among the crowd, as small as they could make it. </p><p>Half the wizarding world was trying to get an invite to the wedding of Harry Potter, to the point Harry had hired some of his aurors to attend, on paper for the threat of dark wizards, but in practice to keep out the paparazzi. All bugs in the reception were to be swatted on sight.</p><p>“Then I pronounce you: Husband and Wife.”</p><p>Ron was the first to start clapping as they kissed, quickly followed by the rest of the audience. His mother had been openly sobbing since Ginny walked out in her dress, and his dad wasn’t far behind.</p><p>Ron smiled. The last wedding the Weasley family had was Bill and Fleurs, who were trying to calm down their new baby daughter. Ron was finally an uncle! And damn his niece was loud. </p><p>Ron was the one to pull Harry out of the kiss, earning a scathing glare from Hermione across the aisle, but it dissipated as the entire bridal party descended on Harry and Ginny to give them their congratulations.  </p><p>Ron ruffled Harry’s hair, messing up what little control he had of it, and saying, “it’s official now mate, we’re actually brothers.”</p><p>“In-law,” Harry added.</p><p>“Details,” Ron dismissed, as Molly tried to bring some sense of order. She pulled Harry back so he could walk with Ginny down the aisle for their first steps as Husband and Wife, but in the chaos, snuck her own warm hug.</p><p>Harry and Ginny walked away to the tents they’d set up in the Burrow yard, taking the crowd with them. Ron hung back, waiting until enough people had passed that he could make it over to Hermione. “You are incorrigible,” she reprimanded.</p><p>“You love me for it,” he said, pulling her in and kissing her head. She had used some time consuming spell to keep it in control, which she’s offered to Harry, but his nerves were bad enough today as it was.</p><p>“Are you SURE you don’t want me to look at your speech?” Hermione asked, “don’t tell me you aren’t nervous about it, you looked at it and we’re making changes right up until we apparated.”</p><p>“I got it,” he reassured her, “come on, have a little faith in me.” He wrapped a hand around her shoulders and pulled her over to the reception.</p><p>She sighed, in a very Hermione-y way. “I have faith,” she said, “I just want to help.”</p><p>“Your presence is all the help I need,” he said, earning a confused and amused look, “you’re my muse! My inspiration, my…” he struggled to find a third word.</p><p>“Your influence?” Hermione suggested.</p><p>“See, there you go again,” he kissed the top of her head again, then tilted her head so he could peck her lips. </p><p>She giggled, both at the words and the affection. “Just making sure you don’t burn out your brain,” she said, “you still owe me a dance.”</p><p>They danced the night away, to the point she had almost distracted him from his nerves. </p><p>Almost.</p><p>The thing was, she was also the centerpiece of his nerves. What Hermione didn’t know was that a few months ago, he and Harry had made a pact, over a tense game of gobstones. Whoever won got to ask his girlfriend to marry him at their graduation (Hermione and Ginny’s, that was, Harry and Ron had decided not to return to school). Ron was still convinced Harry had cheated.</p><p>But the compromise was that the loser could ask their girlfriend to marry them at their wedding reception, thus not overwhelming the family with two weddings at once. </p><p>And today was that day. The day they’d switch and go from Harry and Ginny’s moment, to Ron and Hermione’s. Which was why Ron hadn’t let Hermione look at his speech, and also why he had been checking and editing it right up until the last minute. </p><p>Still, dancing helped. After missing so many dances with Hermione over his life, he enjoyed every minute he could. </p><p>When they finally separated, Ron went to go get them both drinks, while Hermione sat back at the table, laughing about something with Ginny and Luna. That was when Harry cornered him. “You ready, mate?” </p><p>Ron sighed, “Ready as I’ll ever be.”</p><p>“Don’t worry,” Harry said, “She loves you. Has for years, though you were too thick to notice.”</p><p>Ron glared at him for that. “I know, I know,” he admitted, “I’m just going through all the worst possible scenarios….”</p><p>“Stop it,” Harry said, putting a hand on his shoulder, “You two are the best mates I could ever ask for. You’re meant to be and all that cliche nonsense. Just trust in it.”</p><p>Ron nodded, taking a breath, “You absolutely sure you’re okay with me stealing the thunder at your wedding.”</p><p>“Mate, do you see Ginny’s dress? No one’s stealing anyone’s thunder.”</p><p>Ron made a face, “You still can’t talk about my sister that way,” Ron said, “It’s just too weird.”</p><p>Harry chuckled, “I talked about your plan with Ginny. She thinks it’s cute. Go for it.” </p><p>They turned back to their ladies. Hermione and Luna were still laughing, but Ginny’s smile seemed a little more forced as she listened to Hermione talk. She said something and then got up, making her way through the dance floor over to Harry and Ron, trying to avoid relatives where she could. “Um, Ron,” she said, trying to keep her voice low, “I need to talk to you.” </p><p>“Ginevra!” the unmistakable voice of Auntie Muriel spoke up, “Ginevra, you haven’t talked to me this whole time, come over here, bring Harold with you.” </p><p>Harry closed his eyes. For some reason, Muriel was convinced that Harry was a nickname, no matter how many times he’d explained it. “Come on, Ginny,” he held her shoulders for support, “Can’t put this off any longer.” </p><p>“But I-” She said, looking concerned at Ron. </p><p>“We’ll talk later, don’t worry,” Ron assured her, and brought Hermione their drinks. </p><p>Ginny didn’t get to connect with them before the toasts started. Arthur and Molly each got one, and neither of them made it through without crying. Luna had a speech of her own as Ginny’s maid of honor that was a little scattered, but it was very sweet. They think. </p><p>And finally, it was Ron’s turn. “I’ve known about Harry Potter, the boy who lived, since before I can remember. He was a children’s tale like from Beedle the Bard. I always expected him to be some tall, strong, wizard of legend.” He smirked, “imagine my surprise when this lost, short, nerd showed up and sat with me on the train.”</p><p>He earned a laugh from the crowd, and from Harry himself. “That day, Harry bought every sweet the trolley offered, and he shared it with me. And ever since, he’s been the best friend I could ever hope for, other than this one, of course,” he put a hand on Hermione’s shoulder, and she beamed at him.</p><p>“Throughout the years and all our adventures, Harry had proved himself the ONLY man worthy of my sister. And I’m so happy that today, the Weasley family gets a bit bigger. So happy, in fact, I think I want to expand it a little more.” There was some confused muttering at that, wondering what he meant. If he had turned around, he might have seen Ginny and Harry motioning at him to stop, stop now, but he was too focused on his task at hand. </p><p>He pulled a small ring box from his robes and knelt before Hermione. The crowd gasped.  “Hermione Jean Granger,” He said, “I love you with all my heart, would you please do be the honor of marrying me?”</p><p>Hermione stared at him, jaw dropped. Someone, probably George, wolf-whistled at them, starting a cheer all around them. Ron’s nerves were jumping like Irish dancers as he waited for some kind of response. Hermione looked around at the cheering crowd, all encouraging her to say ‘yes.’</p><p>Instead, she swallowed, shaking herself and turned back to Ron. “Can...can we talk in private, please?”</p><p>Ron’s entire being seemed to fall out of him. A buzzing went through his system, blocking his ears from the whispers, the ‘did she yes?’ ‘I think she said no’ ‘poor Ronald’ etc. as they made it out of the backyard and Hermione led him into the house. </p><p>The second the door closed behind them, Hermione released his hand and looked sheepish at him. “You don’t want to marry me?” The thought seemed to slip out his mouth without much conscious effort. If he didn’t feel his lips moving, he might have thought it stayed contained in his brain. </p><p>Hermione looked...pityingly at him. “It’s not that,” she said, “I just...I’m not ready yet. We’re still very young, and I just started my job, and…and…”</p><p>“What does that matter?” Ron asked, “we’ll still be young and starting jobs if we’re married. What difference does it make? Unless…”he trailed off for a moment, Hermione tilting her head curious, “unless you think we’re going to break up.”</p><p>Hermione shook her head, “no, of course I don’t. I love you! But..”</p><p>“But what?”</p><p>“I mean, we haven’t even been dating that long,” Hermione said, “and like I said, we’re still young.”</p><p>“We’re older than Ginny and Harry,” Ron argued, “and they haven’t been dating much longer than we have.”</p><p>“Harry and Ginny made their own decision,” Hermione said, “that doesn’t mean we have to do what they did,”</p><p>“My parents got married at our age.”</p><p>“For fucks sake, Ronald,” Hermione said, surprising him. She didn’t swear often, “look, we’re just. I’m balancing a lot right now with my job, and I just got out of school, and you and I are still learning how to be a couple and adding MARRIAGE onto that is just..just..it’s doomed to failure.”</p><p>“It’s just a party,” he said, “some vows and some different words, what does it matter if we get married now or ten years from now?”</p><p>“If it doesn’t matter, then why can’t we WAIT?” She demanded of him.</p><p>“Because I want to!” He said, “don’t you want to be part of my family?”</p><p>“Of course I do!” She said, “someday! But not yet, not right now. I’m far too busy with my work—“</p><p>“You’re too busy for me?” He said, frowning.</p><p>She sighed, “that’s not what I meant, and you know it.”</p><p>“I’m not so sure I did,” he said, “a job is just a job, it’s how you make money so you can spend time with the people you love.”</p><p>“Maybe it is for you,” She said, “But I actually LIKE my job. I’m doing important things in the magical law office, I’m working to actually change things after the takeover, and I’m proud of what I’m doing! It doesn’t mean I love you any less, it just means that needs to be my focus right now.”</p><p>“I know about important work, I’m an auror for fucks sake,” he said, “but it’s still a job and I hate it, and the only thing that makes it worth it is coming to see you at the end of the day!”</p><p>“If you hate your job so much just quit!” She yelled at him, “but don’t take it out on me.”</p><p>“I’m not taking it out on you!”</p><p>“It sure sounds like you are!” She said, “you’re incredibly smart and incredibly talented, and if you don’t like what you do, do something else!”</p><p>“Life isn’t that simple!” He said, “how are we supposed to pay for things if I'm without a job?”</p><p>“Here’s an idea:” she said, “let’s not get married for a while! Save up!”</p><p>Something ugly was twisting up inside of Ron. Every time she said ‘I love you’ just sounded like pity now, and every time she said she didn’t want to get married, it sounded like she didn’t want him. “Tell you what,” he said, "you don’t want me, you don’t have to deal with me anymore.”</p><p>“Ronald stop, that’s not what I’m saying at all.”</p><p>“Look, it’s fine, I won’t get in the way of your job anymore, and you don’t have to worry about figuring out anything.” He turned his back and started out the door.</p><p>“You’re seriously breaking up with me?” Hermione, her anger hiding most of her hurt, “are you serious Ron—“</p><p>Ron slammed open the door, prepared to re-join the wedding, only remembering at that moment they didn’t cast a muffliato charm. The entire wedding party was looking at them, dead silent except for a few judging whispers.</p><p>So he did the only thing he could think of doing.</p><p>He disapparated.</p><p> </p><p>It took 3 days before he caved and ended up back in front of Hermione’s flat in London with a bouquet of magical flowers. She opened the door and they stared at one another for a long moment, before she opened the door wider and let him in silently.</p><p>He went to the kitchen and got a vase, filling it with water from his wand, and putting the flowers inside. “I quit my job,” he said into the silence.</p><p>“Really?” She asked, leaning on the kitchen doorframe in her pajamas. Her hair was back to full frizziness, tied back as best she could.</p><p>Ron nodded. “I just thought it was normal. Dad worked a lot to keep us all happy and fed. I couldn’t imagine him really liking it.” He sighed. “George gave me a job in his shop for now, helping out.”</p><p>Hermione stepped forward, “is that what you want?”</p><p>He shrugged. “I don’t know. It’s fun for now. But I don’t invent stuff, it’s not...it’s not my place.” He sighed. “I don’t know what I want, except…” he dared look up at her, meeting her big brown eyes. “Except I want to be with you.”</p><p>She stepped forward, small smile playing on her lips. “I want you too,” She said, stepping into his arms, “I tried telling you that, if you had bothered listening.”</p><p>“I’m working on it,” He said, wrapping around her as easy as breathing, “listening, I mean. I don’t...I don’t know what I want,” He said, “and it’s freaking me out. I thought I finally had it all planned. Marry you, work alongside Harry, have a family. All that happily ever after stuff.”</p><p>“Our lives aren’t a story book,” she said, resting her head on his chest, “it’s something we have to keep working on and figuring out. And I want to be there,” she gave him a squeeze, “figuring it out right along with you.”</p><p>He squeezed her back. “Thank you.”</p>
