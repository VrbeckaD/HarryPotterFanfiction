    <p>It was July 1959 and the chief warlock and headmaster of Hogwarts school sat back in seat in his Hogwarts office feeling satisfied that  the first part of his experiment had been concluded successfully.  Both Eileen Prince and Euphenmia Potter we’re pregnant with his sons, Eileen had been easy to seduce and was now pregnant with his child and had as planned married a muggle with no future or intelligence after being thrown out of the Prince’s family.  Euphenmia Potter on the other hand had been so happy to be impregnated with a child by the illustrious Lord Albus Dumbledore, especially since her bonded of many years had not been able to naturally father a child due to the pure blood ailment that made wizards infertile due to the many years of intermarrying of pure blood families.</p><p>Albus look at his journal that outlined not only this experiment but all the other experiments that he had carried out, especially during the Second World War.  The experiment was based upon the muggle psychologists theories that had cultivated in a fierce discussion of whether children were more effected by nature or nature.  </p><p>Albus had decided that he needed for his future plans a man who was totally under his control, and he had decided that by placing two children in totally different environments he would find the young adult who he could control completely.</p><p>He had more hope that Lord Potters son who would be the young adult he could mould, as he would have almost constant contact with the child and the family.  He would be the godfather that would ensure the child got out of any trouble he found himself in, and over a period of time the child would replace his old fashioned and decrepit father as the young man moral anchor in the world.  The child would be totally under his control when the Lord and Lady Potter died suddenly of illness during the child’s sixteenth year.</p><p>The second child Eileen Prince child, would be brought up in an environment that was a harsh and in poverty.  The child would have for a father a muggle who was an illiterate blue collar worker.  Working in factories and other unskilled muggle areas.   This child would only know the bitterness of not belonging to the magical society and how disadvantaged his upbringing would be to his acceptance of his peers into Hogwarts and magical society.  He would of course guide the child as a father would do, guiding the child as Albus wanted, Albus knew that the child would be at best of average intelligence and only have the magical power of just above a squibs.  After all Eileen had been a very dim witted squib, whose family didn’t loose anytime over throwing out of the family.</p><p>No Albus spread his hands out over his desk and smiled at how easily it had been start his experiment. Hopefully in sixteen years time he would have one or both of his sons under his absolute control.    And he could sit back and watch as at least one of the young fools took out the nuisance of Tom Riddle, the young upstart that wanted to take control of Britain Magical Society from him its rightful owner.</p><p>XxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxX</p><p> Fifteen years later</p><p>Chief warlock Albus Dumbledore stormed into his office and started to destroy his office, the Hogwarts express had just left for the summer holidays and he had to acknowledge that his experiment with his two sons had been an unmitigated disaster.</p><p>Heir James Potter instead of being a mailable and man that Albus had total control over, was instead a undiagnosed psychopath.  That lead a group of three friends who terrorised not only his peers through their pranking and bulling.  But had also managed to terrorised Hogwarts staff including the house elves.  The boys known as the mauraders had for five years turned the whole school against them.  Their peers were now afraid of them, the house elves now totally despised and hated them with the passion that they had held for his other son Severus Snape.  The other professors also despised the mauraders but were so scared of them now, that they did nothing to curb their bullying and pranking of other students especially Severus Snape.  </p><p>It would not have matter that much, if his son James Potter had been intelligent and magically powerful.  But no the little psychopath was as thick two short planks as the muggle saying went, and his magical power was between a squibs and a powerfully low wizard.  And to make Albus world in worse, James Potter expected his ‘godfather’ to always come to his assistance and this now included getting him into the auror corps with his best mate the follower Heir Sirius Black.</p><p>His other son Severus Snape despised him and everybody else at Hogwarts school.  It seemed that Severus would not change his opinion of Hogwarts and its inhabitants, due his first five years at the school and how he was treated by his peers, the house elves and professors (who had taken their ques from how to treat Severus from him).  </p><p>Severus to Albus indignation was an exceptionally intelligent and very magically powerful young wizard, who had been so physically and emotionally abused by his muggle father, that he was turning towards the enemy one Lord Voldemort aka Tom Ridldle.    Albus now realised that only concentrating on James Potter and ignoring the plight of his other son had meant that Severus was never destined to rely and be controlled by him.  If Tom Riddle manages to recruit his son, then the light side that he controlled with a iron glove had lost so much and Riddle side gained so much.</p><p> </p><p>Twenty  years later, All Souls day (1981)</p><p>Albus was beside himself with happiness, from his experiment being a migrated failure.  He now knew how to raise a child to be solely reliant on him and him only!  And it was when his prodigal son had to return to him, he now had complete control over his son and it had only taken supposed kindness and unconditional love from him the great Albus Dumbledore.  Of course the great magical civil war that had almost decimated the magical society had been put on hiatus until his weapon was primed and ready to kill the now wraith Lord Voldemort.  </p><p>He had placed his grandson the Potters brat Harry, with his abusive muggle relatives.  He would guide  and become the child’s beckoning light when he was returned to the wizarding society in nine years time.  Albus would be the kindly grandfather that Harry had never had in his life before, Albus kindness and understanding would ensure that child saw him as his saviour from his muggle relatives.  Of course the child’s indoctrination to the magical light side and his total control would be engineered with help from his followers mainly including the Weasley family.  That family he was glad to say were just as fanatical followers of him as the Malfoy’s were of Lord Voldemort’s.</p><p> </p><p>Forty years later (2000)</p><p>There was a small flash of light and bang from the cupboard under-stairs in 4 Pivet Drive, Surrey.  A small eleven year old boy smiled in the dimness of the cupboard.  A twenty year old Lord Harry Potter had completed his plan and own experiment with the assistance of his friend and employee Death.  Lord Harry Potter was now back in his eleven year old body, and now knew what he had to do to stop the plans of the mad Wizarding mages Lord Voldemort and Lord Albus Dumbledore.  Everything he knew was now to play for, and the first thing he had to do was to get his guardianship transferred to his fathers  brother  a one Severus Snape!</p>
