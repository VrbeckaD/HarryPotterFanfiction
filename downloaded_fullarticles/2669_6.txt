    <p>
  <span>Ginny feels the heat in her face and can only assume by the look Demelza is giving her that she must be turning bright red. Her arms crossed and her eyebrows furrowed, Ginny has to hold herself back from practically scoffing at her own Quidditch captain. It’s absolutely ridiculous that the entire team is being told off right now when it was </span>
  <em>
    <span>clearly </span>
  </em>
  <span>Romilda’s error. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Gwenog Jones, the captain, gives Ginny the opening she needs. “Something you’ve got to say, Weasley?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I have loads to say,” she starts. “I’m sorry, Gwenog. I know we’re a team and all but this is absolute bullshit right now-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Weasley-"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We were up 140 points! The win </span>
  <em>
    <span>should </span>
  </em>
  <span>have been ours! Vane </span>
  <em>
    <span>clearly</span>
  </em>
  <span> should have been paying attention, but she was obviously daydreaming, feeling safe to do so by the lead the rest of the team upheld for her!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I thought we were up 170! I’m sorry!” Romilda injects, sticking her nose in the air. “Just because you played seeker a bit in school-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Merlin, </span>
  <em>
    <span>please</span>
  </em>
  <span>. You were ogling the enemy!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Enough, Weasley,” Jones asserts loudly. “Stay for a moment. The rest of you, go wash up and head home. I want you in a half hour earlier tomorrow for drills, alright?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ginny moves her hands to her hips, trying to mask the worry she feels of Gwenog wanting to speak to her alone. The others clear out and Demelza gives Ginny a look of sympathy as she walks out behind the rest of the team and closes the door.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Out of line, Ginny,” Gwenog starts. “I understand you’re upset, but-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Gwenog,” Ginny says, attempting to cool down the blood boiling beneath her skin. “This is the third game this season where Romilda has made a blunder like that, and she’s lucky that the last time we </span>
  <em>
    <span>were </span>
  </em>
  <span>actually up by 170.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Gwenog sighs, running a hand through her hair. “I am aware, and I will deal with Vane privately and separately. But this is also the third time you’ve spoken like that to her. I’m sorry, Weasley, but I’m going to have to ask you to stay home for tomorrow’s practice.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ginny feels her stomach drop at the absolute injustice of the situation. “And what good will that do?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It will help you cool off,” she states. “As I’ve said, we’re a team, and you can’t talk to your other teammates like that. I have no tolerance for it. Confront her calmly and speak like a level-headed adult, for Merlin’s sake.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ginny clenches her fist, taking a deep breath. “And wouldn’t you say it’s the team’s responsibility to make sure we are working </span>
  <em>
    <span>as </span>
  </em>
  <span>a cohesive team? How come I’m the only one holding her accountable? If she were really part of this team, she would take ownership of her errors and work on them.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Gwenog looks at her for a moment, then puts a hand on her shoulder. Ginny usually loves Gwenog, but she has been testing her patience these past couple of months, and she fights the urge to shake her hand off of her. “I know how much you care about this team. And you are my star chaser. But I’m warning you...anything like that again, and you’ll be suspended from the next match. Understood?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ginny nods, lips tight. Gwenog pats her shoulder and strides away. The door shuts behind her and Ginny does her best to keep her tears at bay. She understands Gwenog’s desire to keep a peaceful environment, but it only seems to be making things worse. She sits there for a few more moments, gathers herself and her belongings, and strides out of the stadium locker rooms.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As she makes her way towards the stadium exit, she sees the strangest sight. Her brothers, Ron, Fred, and George all chatting up with Harry Potter, Puddlemore’s seeker. Ron’s ears are a bit red and Fred and George are high fiving as Harry laughs. She is tempted to back into the locker room until Potter leaves but before she could even turn around Fred spots her. “Gin!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She stops in her tracks and puts on a thin-lipped smile, and she knows her brothers can see right through it. Fred and George approach her, but Ron, for some unforeseen reason, stays behind to keep chatting it up with Potter. “You were bloody fantastic,” George tells her, messing her hair. “One hundred points and ten assists!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Absolutely mad,” Fred adds, patting her back. “A shame your seeker is an idiot.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ginny snorts, but appreciatively. “Yeah, tell me about it. But I can’t go to practice tomorrow and I’m facing possible suspension for stating that obvious fact.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re serious?” asks Fred. “That’s rubbish.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You alright, Gin?” George questions, sensing her frustration.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She shrugs. “I just want to get out of here, honestly.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright, let’s grab fanboy Ronald over there,” Fred chuckles as they turn to walk towards Ron and the Puddlemore seeker, who seem to be laughing together. “We’ll apparate back to the Burrow for a bit, yeah? Dad wants to hear about the game.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ginny nods, marching forward towards her other brother. As she approaches, Harry Potter looks away from Ron and straight at Ginny, offering her a somewhat hesitant smile. Once close enough he says, “Hey, Ginny, right? I just wanted to tell you, you were brilliant out there, and-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thanks,” she answers curtly, stealing the shortest of glances at his fallen smile before she shoves Ron and says, “C’mon, let’s go,” as she walks past him further towards the exit.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She crosses her arms and waits, staring away from her brothers and her opponent, when she hears the twins approach Harry and slap him on the back. “Sorry about her,” George apologizes. “She’s got a bit of a temper on her, that one.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And an awful competitive streak,” Fred chimes in.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And too much pride,” adds George. “Isn’t that right, Gin?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Without facing them, she sticks up her middle finger behind her back. All four boys laugh and she rolls her eyes, tapping her foot impatiently.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She listens as George, Fred, and Ron each say goodbye to Potter, hears him quickly mention her name once, and the conversation ending with something about a time tomorrow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Once they reach her, Fred throws an arm around her. “Alright, miss brat, let’s get you home and fed so you could shrink back down a bit.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Without responding, they all grab each other and apparate back to the Burrow. When they land and shake off the feeling of it, Ginny asks them, “What was that about tomorrow at eight?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well if you hadn’t been so </span>
  <em>
    <span>rude</span>
  </em>
  <span> maybe you’d know, hm?” Ron comments, clearly annoyed as they walk down the path to the back door.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We invited Potter to visit Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes,” Fred tells her, ignoring Ron’s attitude. “And he invited us to all get drinks afterward.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He was </span>
  <em>
    <span>going</span>
  </em>
  <span> to ask you to join as well,” George informs her. “So he passed along the message to us. Said the invitation was open for you, if you wanted, although we insisted upon excluding you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Insisted,” Fred repeats, smiling.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll pass,” Ginny says, undoing her braid as they walk. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron groans. “What’s your deal? Didn’t you used to be in love with him or something?”’</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>No</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Ginny responds, narrowing her eyes at him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Gin, it’s us! You don’t have to lie,” Fred assures her. “We all remember your exclusive Potter commentary before you made the reserves two years ago.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You practically had his name doodled in your books.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Surprised you didn’t magically stick his poster to your ceiling.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ginny scoffs at them. Although she knows they aren’t wrong. And as mad as she is at Romilda, part of her doesn’t even blame her for ogling Potter. She has been attracted to him since the moment she first saw him in the Prophet when he made Puddlemore. And of course, she knew who he was before that, being James and Lily Potter’s son. But she doesn’t want to make a fool of herself in front of him again like she did the very first time she introduced herself her first year in the league. She knows if she pays too much attention to him on the pitch, she’ll become almost as distracted as Romilda. And as much as she would thoroughly enjoy both admiring his technique and ogling his fit physique, her high-quality Quidditch performance is at a much higher priority than a fit bloke she’s had a fangirl crush on for multiple years.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Although she </span>
  <em>
    <span>may</span>
  </em>
  <span> have a rolled-up poster of him in her closet rather than plastered on her ceiling. That she opens up and glances at from time to time. Who’s really to say.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Things change when someone becomes your competitor,” she shrugs, opening the back door that leads straight into the kitchen and going straight towards the fridge. She takes out the jug of pumpkin juice and pours some straight into her mouth, taking a big gulp. After she swallows, she turns back to her brothers, who are all sitting at the table. “Either way, Romilda is not even a </span>
  <em>
    <span>fraction </span>
  </em>
  <span>as talented as Katie was, and Potter tries to pull a Wronski Feint at least every other game because he’s so bleeding </span>
  <em>
    <span>fast </span>
  </em>
  <span>on his Firebolt that it works practically every time. He’s a pretty predictable player. She should have known.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The Potter commentary lives on!” exclaims George, raising a fist. “Keep it coming. What color are his eyes? When’s his birthday?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Green. July 31st. “So I know one of his strategies. That’s my job. Study the enemy, you know? I just wish I could play seeker against him once to show them how it’s done, but I like being a chaser too much to even bother,” Ginny finishes before passes the pitcher of pumpkin juice to the boys. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right, just about Quidditch tactics, got it,” snorts Ron, leaning back in his chair.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No matter how many fun facts you know about him, the offer still stands for tomorrow,” Fred reminds her. “We won’t tell him about your crush, promise.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>have </span>
  </em>
  <span>a crush,” she groans, trying to convince her brothers and herself. “This is what I get for being nice and inviting you guys to VIP access for my matches...And Ron, why are you even going to meet with Potter? You’re a Cannons fan! Fraternizing with the enemy, now?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron shrugs, summoning a muffin from the counter and taking a bite out of it. “I don’t know,” he says, mouth full of muffin. “He seems like a cool bloke, when he’s not destroying the Cannons at least.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just when he’s destroying the Harpies, your own sister’s team,” Ginny bites.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Be careful, Ron, or she’ll bat bogey you to smithereens,” Fred warns his brother.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No hexing in the kitchen,” says Arthur, finally making his appearance. He kisses Ginny on the temple and smooths her hair. “Your mother is asleep on the couch, so you better take it outside. No need to tickle a sleeping dragon, ay?”</span>
