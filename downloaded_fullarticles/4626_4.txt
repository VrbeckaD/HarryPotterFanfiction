    <p>Day: 0<br/>
Time: 21:45</p><p>Harry sighed as he trudged up the stairs. It had been a long day sweeping and scrubbing. He would bet some good Galleons on the fact that everything in this house was actually made from compacted dust and grime.</p><p>His and Ron's footsteps were halted at the stair landing as they overheard some yelling downstairs. From the many arguments he had with his Mother on a daily basis, Sirius’s voice was clear as could be.</p><p>“Kreature, shut up! What is wrong with you, this is my house which makes you my elf. Stop this act this moment!”</p><p>The house elf startled the two boys as instead of its usual soft mumblings to itself, or coughed out insults the creature was yelling, screaming in fact. Never before had either of them heard a house elf raise their voice above an excited squeak.</p><p>“You are not Kreatures master! Kreature master is not here. But Kreatures master is alive, and will bring revenge and violence against all you unworthy filth and garbage!”</p><p>Harry looked to his close friend for answers, but the boy looked dumbstruck. As they both turned to go watch the strange occurrence, they were stopped by Molly Weasley, who was bolting up the stairs.</p><p>“Go into your rooms! Bolt the door and do not open them, whatever happens be quiet as a mouse and do not leave! Promise!”</p><p>Both boys nodded, Mrs. Weasley looked terribly frightened. Neither had seen her so pale and shaken before. Without her normally flushed cheeks, she had put the boys into a fearful state due to her panic.</p><p>Ron and Harry ran to their room and did as they were told, soon they heard her reaching the other children, and demanding the same as she had the youngest boys. </p><p>It shocked them but Fred and George didn't argue, they stayed silent as the footsteps entered their room. Moving silently, Harry went to sit on Ron's bed so the two could whisper. The redhead ignored him and he came in close to whisper in his ear. He had to rouse his friend to notice him by waving frantically in front of his face. Ron turned to him with unseeing eyes, he leaned in again.</p><p>“Ron, what's going on!” His voice was but a whisper and still it seemed to loud.</p><p>The Weasley seemed to finally see him. </p><p>“A house elf will only yell at a human, if they have been told to, they will only yell at their master… if they are no longer their master.”</p><p>It took a minute for green eyes to understand. “Kreature has another master?”</p><p>Ron nodded sullenly “He has to, and it has to be a Black.”</p><p>Thinking for a moment he recalled the family tree he had seen while cleaning with Sirius, “But the only legitimate Black left is Draco’s Mum, and her sister right? But they couldn't have gotten to Kreature, he's been here and they haven't.”</p><p>With scared brown eyes his friend turned to him and gave him a look he'd only seen once or twice before, but never before had his friend voiced the feeling in such a scared tone. “I'm scared Harry. If they find us…”</p><p>Harry smiled and gave his friend a soft pat, “Ron you are over thinking, even if the death eaters come, Sirius, Molly and the twins can apparate, and there is always the Floo!”</p><p>Ron didn't seem to care for his friend attempting to cheer him up. “House elves have control over the house, he can stop the floo, and Mom can only take two people at most, the twins can't take any and Sirius, well if he could Apparate why hasn't he done so before?”</p><p>The ginger was beginning to panic, and the sense his words made was starting to frighten the brunette. Throwing on the biggest smile he could Harry pushed his friend in bed and covered him before going to his own.</p><p>“Don't worry Ron, we have the Order of the Phoenix on our side. Let's just go to bed, it will be all okay tomorrow!”</p><p>Ron sighed but agreed.</p><p>It took them both hours to be able to sleep, fear penetrating their psyche, but nothing could keep two exhausted teenage boys from their sleep, not even the threat of death.</p>
