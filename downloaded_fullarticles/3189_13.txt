    <p>It was a bright February morning in 2022 when Minerva felt it. A rift, almost as though something had changed.</p><p> </p><p>She glanced helplessly at the portrait of Dumbledore that she had moved to the wall opposite her desk upon assuming office.</p><p> </p><p>“Minerva,” he rasped. “Minerva, you must act quickly. Dark happenings are afoot.”</p><p> </p><p>“What was that, Albus?” she frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“That, my dear, was the universe being split in order for it to be duplicated.”</p><p> </p><p>McGonnagal frowned. That was the weirdest thing that she had ever heard, and she worked at a fucking school for young witches and wizards. “I beg your pardon?”</p><p> </p><p>“There is no time to explain, my dear. Just reach into the compartment behind Phineas. I’ve kept a spare time-turner in there~”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>What!?</em>~”</p><p> </p><p>“In the event of an emergency. Do not worry, it is preset. Just take me with you and follow my instructions word for word.”</p><p> </p><p>“Alright,” the man may sound completely nuts, but there was no denying that Albus Dumbledore was a genius.</p><p> </p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>Albus Severus Potter had been on his way to Potions Class, like any other normal Fifth Year, when suddenly he was standing in what looked like a beat-down shack. He looked around. He saw James, Lily, Teddy (which was odd because Teddy didn’t even go to Hogwarts anymore), Scorpius, Rose, Hugo… and then a bunch of strange people, one of whom looked rather like him. He would’ve guessed it were his father, except for the fact that his father was most <em>definitely</em> not seventeen-eighteenish.</p><p> </p><p>And there, in the middle of it all, stood Headmistress McGonnagal.</p><p> </p><p>“Ma’am, why are we here? Who are they?” Scorpius asked.</p><p> </p><p>“More importantly, what am <em>I</em> doing here? The last time that I checked, I was no longer in school,” Teddy rolled his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“You are here, because a great tragedy has arisen. The Dark Lord had a daughter,” McGonnagal began.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>What</em>!?” five members of the party that looked suspiciously like his, his cousins’ and his best-friends’ parents shrieked.</p><p> </p><p>“Great, Malfoy,” him-look-alike growled. “Bloody great. This <em>is</em> what you wanted, isn’t it?”</p><p> </p><p>“What? Why would I want that?” Scorpius replied, confused before the other Malfoy-look-alike could answer.</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t talking to him~ who are you?” Harry frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“I believe that some introductions are in order. First, I would like you to split up into your respective years. 1979 can stand over there,” she gestured. “Then 1998, and 2022.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>What</em>!?” they all shrieked.</p><p> </p><p>“Just do it. It will all make sense later.”</p><p> </p><p>Grudgingly they all complied, but Albus noticed that the guy that looked like a younger version of one of his namesake’s and another raven-haired guy kept a little to the side in their group.</p><p> </p><p>“Firstly, I would like you to know that Voldemort’s daughter used a time-turner to get not only her father, but <em>Gellert Grindelwald</em> himself to restructure a parallel timeline in which wizards rule and muggleborns and muggles alike are treated like slaves,” there were gasps. “The only way to solve this issue, it would seem, were to take the best and brightest from three separate generations and get them to fight it. Though I must admit that I do not know why on earth Dumbledore chose you six,” she frowned in the direction of the group from 1979. “Grindelwald wasn’t a problem for you, he was a problem for Mr. Scamander’s generation… oh well, I suppose that Dumbledore works in mysterious ways. And if he thinks that you six are needed then who are we to question his authority?”</p><p> </p><p>When everybody looked even <em>more</em> confused, she continued. “Now then, after this is all over, the spells used to bring you three here will wipe away your memory of the event, as Dumbledore does not wish to create even <em>more</em> paradoxes. Let’s start the introductions with the 1979ers then.”</p><p> </p><p>“Um, hi?” a boy with light-brown hair and green eyes started. “Uh, my name’s Remus John Lupin~” Teddy gasped, and Albus could’ve sworn that he’d heard him utter an <em>I bloody fucking knew it</em> and tear up a bit. “I recently graduated Hogwarts and work with the Order of the Phoenix, an organization dedicated to taking down the Dark Lord.”</p><p> </p><p>A man with dark hair and grey eyes swaggered forwards. “Hey! I’m Sirius Black, I’m in the same boat as my friend Remus over here.”</p><p> </p><p>Albus frowned. He’d heard that name before. A second man with dark hair, but this time hazel eyes, walked forwards. “Hello, my name’s James Potter,” his eyes widened and from the looks of it, so did Lily and James’s~ er, <em>his</em> James’s. “Yeah, same as them, recently graduated and work for the Order of the Phoenix.”</p><p> </p><p>A lady stepped forwards this time. She had fiery red hair and the same green eyes as him. “Hi, I’m Lily Evans,” Lily was the only one to gasp this time, she looked at Albus with her eyes wide. <em>Grandma</em>, he mouthed, before pausing. <em>Dad’s mom</em>, he amended, hoping that she wouldn’t think that she was Grandma Molly. “Same as them.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m Severus Snape,” Albus straightened, despite the booing and hissing by the two dark-hai~ you know what, Sirius and James. “I work for the Dark Lord~”</p><p> </p><p>“But in a few months turn double-agent because the Dark Lord wants to kill Mrs. Potter.”</p><p> </p><p>Snape stood there frozen. “He wants to what?”</p><p> </p><p>“The Voldemort in this timeline already knows that Harry is the Prophecy child, therefore in order to save Lily, who he kills to get to Harry, you have to turn double-agent~ you <em>do</em> turn double-agent.”</p><p> </p><p>Snape stood there speechless. Eventually, McGonnagal sighed. “Moving on,” she drawled.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, hi, my name’s Regulus Arcturus Black,” a boy with dark hair and a face nearly identical (albeit a bit softer and not as good-looking) as the second~ er, <em>Sirius</em> said. “I’m a Seventh-year and a Death Eater.”</p><p> </p><p>Speaking of Sirius, Albus didn’t miss the way that Sirius growled and glared whilst the boy spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s he doing here?” he spat out at portraitdore.</p><p> </p><p>“He, alongside Severus, are here to serve as spies.”</p><p> </p><p>“What makes you think that either of those two <em>Death Eaters</em> are going to join the cause?”</p><p> </p><p>“In our timeline they both give their life for the cause~ our cause, that is.”</p><p> </p><p>“So they're fickle~ they still can’t be trusted,” Sirius protested.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Black, I would advise you to please not try to start a fight amongst your team. There is a very limited number of them, most importantly there is a limited number of people in this world that you can trust~ nobody outside of this room, that is.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Fine~ but I don’t have to like it,” Sirius growled.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright then,” McGonnagal nodded before turning to the group from 1998. “Now, the 1998ers.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, hi, my name is Harry James Potter, my group of friends and I just defeated the Dark Lord… and Malfoy’s here, so that’s that.”</p><p> </p><p>“My name is Hermione Jean Granger, same as Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ronald Bilius Weasley. Same.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ginerva Molly Weasley. Same.”</p><p> </p><p>“Draco Lucius Malfoy. I didn’t fight against the Dark Lord, I fled with my parents.” Albus didn’t miss the way that the younger version of his best-friend’s father inched closer to Snape and Regulus.</p><p> </p><p>“And now for 2022 to have a go,” McGonnagal beckoned.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi! My name is Edward Remus Lupin, we live in a time of peace. I guess. I’m an Auror, but everyone else over here is still in Hogwarts.” Teddy nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“James Sirius Potter. Hogwarts student.”</p><p> </p><p>“Albus Severus Potter,” he nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“Why the bloody hell would Harry name his son after Snape!?” Uncle Ron blinked.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not sure… maybe because Snape sacrificed his life to bring down Voldemort, and did his best to protect me wherever he could from danger… I guess I’ll wind up thinking more about it in the coming years,” his younger father shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>“Lily Luna Potter,” <em>his</em> Lily continued.</p><p> </p><p>“Hugo Granger-Weasley,” Albus didn’t miss the way that his young-mother smirked at Uncle Ron.</p><p> </p><p>“Rose Granger-Weasley.”</p><p> </p><p>“D’xawww! Ronnie and ‘Mione, sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S~” his mother cackled as Uncle Ron chased her around in a circle.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr. and Ms. Weasley! You will stop that inappropriate behavior right this instant!”</p><p> </p><p>The two came to a halt.</p><p> </p><p>“Uhhh… hi, my name is Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good, now. I have here a few copies of an instruction manual compiled by Dumbledore. There’s three of them… split them up however you may wish.”</p><p> </p><p>She disapparated, leaving three copies of a book.</p><p> </p><p>Regulus stepped forwards first and grabbed the first book, opening it and frowning. “The first page is a portrait of Dumbledore.”</p><p> </p><p>“How are we splitting these up?” Sirius demanded.</p><p> </p><p>“By year?” James shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh no <em>ways</em> am I sharing a book with Snivellus,” Grandpa James shuddered.</p><p> </p><p>“James F. Potter!” Grandma Lily scolded.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, Lils. Anyways, we know when you guys are from, and your names, but can you please explain whom <em>exactly</em> you are?” Remus frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t it obvious, Lupin?” Severus drawled. “We here are three generations of wizards. We’re the first, the 1998 group is your children, and the 2022 group is their children~ your grandchildren.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hi, grandpa,” Albus nodded in Grandpa James’s direction, “Grandma,” in Grandma Lily’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Mom! Dad!” his young father ran forwards to hug his grandparents. “Sirius! Lupin! Thank the gods, you’re all still alive! <em>Snape</em>~ I can’t fucking believe that I’m saying this, but I’m glad to see you too! And… and you’re Regulus, right? RAB~ you were like the first person to find out! I can’t believe that all of you are here!”</p><p> </p><p>This was, of course, met with about a hundred questions.</p><p> </p><p>“Find out what?” Sirius.</p><p> </p><p>“Mom?” Lily.</p><p> </p><p>“Dad?” James.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Son</em>!?” both.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Still</em> alive?” Remus.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck yeah! Do I die fighting old Voldy?” Sirius.</p><p> </p><p>“Won’t this disrupt the timeline?” Aunt Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>“When’s lunch?” Uncle Ron.</p><p> </p><p>“Mom, can I have an apple?” Hugo.</p><p> </p><p>“Why don’t we just split it up by House?” Rose.</p><p> </p><p>“But there’re four Houses.” Statement. Lily. <em>His</em> Lily.</p><p> </p><p>“Uhhh… Lils,” Teddy blinked. “I’m pretty sure that I’m the only one here not in either Slytherin or Gryffindor. Pretty sure. I’m still open to a counter argument.”</p><p> </p><p>“No…” Ron frowned. “No, I’m pretty sure the rest of us <em>are</em> all in either Slytherin or Gryffindor.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then it’s settled~ we go by House,” Aunt Hermione frowned. “Though that does make the book to person ratio a little skewed.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh can the ratio talk, ‘Mione,” Uncle Ron moaned. “Look, it’s <em>obvious</em> that splitting us by year isn’t going to work~ people are going to <em>fight</em>… since the only other alternative would be giving 2022 a book and then splitting by House, and that would <em>also</em> screw whatever a ratio is~ I’m assuming it’s the number of people to a book~ it’s probably just best to go by House.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ron~ Forgoing~,” Hermione sighed. “Fine. We’ll go by House.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ummm… guys,” Regulus interjected. “I hate to be a bother, but the books already <em>have</em> people assigned to them. It’s on the second page~ it seems that each book is a mission-plan, charmed to turn into a second book upon completion.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Sirius said, impatiently. “Would it please your highness to tell us where we’re supposed to go?”</p><p> </p><p>Regulus looked hurt by his brother’s comment. “Well, uh. Group one,” he held up a book. “Albus, James S., Scorpius, Draco, Harry and Ginny~”</p><p> </p><p>“No fair!” Lily pouted. “How come you get mom and dad?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry and Ginny looked at each other in horror and blushed.</p><p> </p><p>“The second group is: Teddy~ Teddy?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, sorry, I kind of go by that~ Edward’s such a mouthful, and it doesn’t suit me anyways.”</p><p> </p><p>“You remind me of my niece, Nymphadora,” Sirius smiled. “She <em>hates</em> her name~ not even seven yet and already prefers to go by her last name, Tonks.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s my mother,” Teddy smiled.</p><p> </p><p>“Your son marries my niece?” Sirius frowned at Remus. “Uhhh… guess she’s kind of a cougar, eh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uhhh…” Teddy blushed. “Uhmmm… er… actu-actually, uh, R-Remus <em>is</em> my dad…”</p><p> </p><p>It took a moment to sink in.</p><p> </p><p>“Bloody fucking hell, Remus~ she’s not even <em>seven yet</em>!” Sirius screeched. “And wE’RE BLOODY FUCKING DONE WITH SCHOOL ALREADY!!”</p><p> </p><p>“Er~ Sorry, I guess?” Remus shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>“OK, Regulus, te~ Re-Regulus?”</p><p> </p><p>Regulus had fainted.</p><p> </p><p>Snape got down next to him and murmured. “<em>Rennervate</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Regulus woke up again, gasping. “Oh, sorry. Severus, where are we?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Snape</em>, and you just fainted at the thought of Lupin’s pedophilic relationship with your niece~ er, ex-niece.”</p><p> </p><p>“No~ it was… it was something… never mind. Let’s just finish this,” Regulus muttered, his brow sweating with effort to hold himself up and his skin paler than before. “Er… Teddy, then. Teddy, Lily L., Remus, James, Severus and Sirius.”</p><p> </p><p>“That leaves you, me, Hugo, Rose, Hermione and Ron,” Grandma Lily pointed. “C’mon… I think that you need to lie down for a moment.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be fine.”</p><p> </p><p>“Regulus,” she whispered, softly.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll <em>be</em> fine!” he snapped.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t talk to her like that,” Grandpa James stepped forwards.</p><p> </p><p>Regulus looked about to fight but Snape stepped forwards to shield the younger male. “Come on. I’ll walk you to your station… but she’s right, you know. You should probably lie down.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p> </p><p>“How about we compromise. Wherever your group goes to read your mission statement, I’ll transfigure your seat into a chaise so that you can lie down. Deal?”</p><p> </p><p>“Deal.”</p><p> </p><p>“And in return, you’ll tell me <em>why</em> you fainted?”</p><p> </p><p>“I can’~ not here,” Regulus whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, genius. We’re all supposed to be working together,” Sirius growled. “No secrets. Now tell us what’s wrong so that we can fix it.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a Slytherin thing,” Albus rolled his eyes. “Sorry if we find it hard to trust other Houses when everyone constantly discriminates against us.”</p><p> </p><p>“You~you’re a <em>Slytherin</em>!?” his father spluttered in shock.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, and don’t worry, you don’t get much better about it in the future,” Albus said, bitterly.</p><p> </p><p>He felt bad about saying it instantly. A look of hurt spread across his father’s face, his mother’s eyes flickered between the two of them as though one or both of them would explode any moment.</p><p> </p><p>“Anyways… look, Regulus. I’m sorry that you fainted, but in the room right now, I can assure you that there are in fact four Slytherins who are very willing to defend your honor,” he rolled his eyes a bit at the way he sounded. “You don’t have to worry about… about feeling weak.”</p><p> </p><p>“I haven’t eaten since yesterday,” he sighed.</p><p> </p><p>“Why not?” Sirius barked. “Why didn’t Kreacher cook for you? Where was that idiot!?”</p><p> </p><p>“I told him not to… I was supposed to go out with him today… before we got here…” Regulus frowned. “Without Kreacher though, the plan’s a waist.”</p><p> </p><p>Kreacher appeared. “You called, master Regulus?”</p><p> </p><p>“K-Kreacher? How did you get to… whenever this is?”</p><p> </p><p>“House Elf magic,” Kreacher shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t make <em>any</em> sense to Regulus or anyone there but really, none of this did. Frankly, Albus was too mentally drained by all of this to care anymore.</p><p> </p><p>“Why didn’t you want to be fed? Where were you going?” Sirius pressed.</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t hungry. Out.”</p><p> </p><p>“Out <em>where</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>“Out none-of-your-business~”</p><p> </p><p>“Why you f~”</p><p> </p><p>“Sirius! Regulus! Enough bickering! From what we know this world is in grave danger! Can we all just try to get along long enough to complete these bloody tasks! <em>Huh</em>!?” Grandma Lily grit out.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Regulus nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, Lils,” Sirius nodded, still glaring at his brother.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait!” Albus interjected before they could continue. “Before we go off… my brother and sister are called James and Lily, and I know that our grandparents have the same names…”</p><p> </p><p>“Bloody hell, Prongs. You’re a grandpa!” Sirius laughed.</p><p> </p><p>“Jokes aside, what’re we going to do about names?”</p><p> </p><p>“James S. and James P.?” his brother shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>“No, too much of a mouthful,” grandpa frowned. “How about… how about I go by Potter, and you can keep James.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait,” Draco looked scandalized. “Does that mean that I have to start calling Potter by his <em>first</em> name!?” he shuddered.</p><p> </p><p>Albus noticed his father do the same.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d guess so,” Mom nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t see what the big deal is,” Albus frowned. “You’ve gotten a lot closer the past year.”</p><p> </p><p>“Umm… Al, I <em>really</em> don’t think that it’s a good idea to tell them why at the moment,” Scorpius whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“I second that,” James nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“Why?” Harry frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll tell you eventually. Right now it doesn’t seem like the best option. Yet,” James said.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll go by my maiden name. Evans,” Grandma Lily smiled.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, since we’re all working together and whatnot, I feel as though it is my duty to mention that I~ I’m a werewolf,” Remus sighed.</p><p> </p><p>There was no reaction.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you kidding me? My life’s secret, and <em>none</em> of you <em>care</em>!?”</p><p> </p><p>“Everyone in our generation knows because you took the cursed DADA position,” Harry shrugged. “And you also fought in the final battle against Lord Voldemort~ I’m pretty sure Werewolf-wizard was written in your memorial in the Prophet.”</p><p> </p><p>“And you’re Teddy’s dad, so <em>of course</em> we all know,” Albus shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>And that just left one person.</p><p> </p><p>“You greasy git,” Sirius gasped. “You told, didn’t you! <em>Didn’t you</em>!?” he brandished his wand at Snape.</p><p> </p><p>“Calm down, Black, no I did not.”</p><p> </p><p>“He really didn’t,” Regulus interjected, “I hate to break it to you, but you Marauders aren’t exactly the best at keeping secrets. I figured it out in my first year, just like how I know that you guys all became Animagi to protect him. And that you guys have a ‘secret’ map that lets you stalk all of us.”</p><p> </p><p>“H-how!?~” Sirius spluttered.</p><p> </p><p>“In good time, dear brother. All in good time.”</p><p> </p><p>“We’re not brothers.”</p><p> </p><p>“You know what I meant.”</p><p> </p><p>“Guys,” Teddy groaned. “Can we <em>please</em> <em>just read the bloody instructions</em>!?”</p><p> </p><p>Once more, the two brothers Black blushed.</p><p> </p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>“OK, who’s reading?” Harry asked.</p><p> </p><p>“I will,” Scorpius volunteered,</p><p> </p><p>“<em>You are currently in the year 1990.</em></p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“By this year, the revolution is over (has been over for a decade). There Potters are all dead, and the Weasleys have all been branded ‘Bloodtraitiors’ and made slaves (they serve different families: Ginerva, George and Bill serve the Malfoys; Fred, Molly and Arthur serve the Blacks; Ron, Charlie and Percy serve the Notts.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“The Battle for Hogwarts occurred during the 1980s, pre-Draco, therefore the Malfoys are still within the good graces of the Dark Lord. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Nobody here from the year 2022 has been born yet.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You will need to use this to your advantage. Your task is to rescue the Weasleys. To win this war you will require an army, this is how you shall begin to build it.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“OK,” Harry frowned. “How the ever-loving-hell are we going to do that?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not sure,” Ginny frowned as well. “Maybe we ought to find a member of each family and get access?”</p><p> </p><p>“Or we could just use Kreacher,” Draco drawled. “He <em>is</em> a house elf and <em>does</em> have access to any room he could possibly want.”</p><p> </p><p>The entire table turned to him.</p><p> </p><p>“That could work,” Harry nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“But there are some rooms that not even a house elf can access,” Albus pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll use Kreacher to sneak us in. Only three of us, though. One of us under the disillusionment charm, and the other two under my father’s invisibility cloak~ hang on a second… to my knowledge, he ought to have it as well.”</p><p> </p><p>“I have it too,” Albus held up his.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s bloody brilliant! Then we can launch this at the same time~ it would avoid the risk of someone catching on and barring us access to their house.”</p><p> </p><p>“And all of the houses would be accessible anyways. All three families are very loyal to the Dark Lord, <em>must be</em> to have slaves. If he is unable to apparate into your home regardless of circumstance, there are punishments to be dealt with,” Draco shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>“Excellent!” Ginny grinned. “Well, how about Albus and James go together, I’ll go with Harry, and you can go with Scorpius. If we don’t make it back here within a given time limit, then we go searching for the others.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agreed,” Scorpius nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“Agreed,” they all agreed.</p><p> </p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Group 2,</em>” Teddy read,</p><p> </p><p>“<em>As your group will need to raise a small army in order to fight, you are tasked with finding a safe location to store them~ offsite where they do not pose a threat to you if they turn out to be spies.</em></p><p>

</p><p>
  <em>“In this universe the Potters do not exist anymore. Remus and Sirius are slaves to the Rosiers, and Severus has maintained his position beside the Dark Lord as his Potions Master. Nobody from 2020 has been born yet.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“But where?” Remus frowned. “We don’t know <em>anything</em> about this land!”</p><p> </p><p>“Well then, I guess we ought to go exploring. Let’s take Lily, Potter and… huh, I guess just me, then. Remus and Sirius ought to stay here unless they wind up picked up off of the streets or something.”</p><p> </p><p>“I can go~ I’ll just transform into Padfoot,” Sirius shrugged, turning into a dog.</p><p> </p><p>“Woah! That’s neat! You guys’ve got to teach me that one!” Teddy beamed.</p><p> </p><p>“What of Lupin and I?” Snape drawled.</p><p> </p><p>“Think of how to lay out the secret shelter.” Teddy shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright.”</p><p> </p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>“Group three,” Regulus began.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>In this universe, Lily is dead. Regulus is alive. Hugo and Rose were never born. Hermione is the Averys’ slave, Ron is the Notts’ slave~”</em></p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“That’s <em>awful</em>,” Hermione gasped.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“This world was created by a time-turner and is in no-means stable. Your task is to figure out this universe’s weak spot (an object of sorts) and destroy it. It is likely held by either Delphini, Grindelwald or Voldemort.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“What could it be?” Lily frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, the Voldemort in our world was using Horcruxes to keep himself together~” Hermione began.</p><p> </p><p>“What are those?” Evans asked.</p><p> </p><p>“No, that wouldn’t qualify as a ‘weak spot’ as it is Voldemort specific,” Regulus frowned, ignoring Evans. “Hmmm… if their time-turner was capable of creating a new universe… maybe smashing it would work? I dunno, it would depend on how unstable it was…”</p><p> </p><p>“How about the Elder Wand? Both Voldemort and Grindelwald would have it,” Hermione added.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmmm… that would definitely help if we could find a spell to undo this world… I’d need to go through a library though, my family one is pretty extensive, most old families have large libraries. If I could just get access to it~”</p><p> </p><p>“I have a few books from there in my satchel!”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve been in my family’s library?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, the Order used it when Voldemort came back as a hideout~”</p><p> </p><p>“Be careful when you say his name, it might be a taboo~”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m sure that Dumbledore would’ve made this place impenetrable~”</p><p> </p><p>“Still. Anyways, you were saying that~”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah yes, we were on the run from the… Dark Lord, we were Horcrux hunting~”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait! There’s more than one!?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah! There’s seven! The ring, the cup, his highschool diary, the diadem, the locket~ which you found~ Nagini and Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nagini!? <em>Harry!? </em>I thought that you couldn’t place a Horcrux in a living creature!”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I’m not sure how he got it in Nagini, but in Harry it was an accident~ don’t worry though, Voldemort removed it.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Willingly</em>?” Regulus frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“No. He never knew about it. Dumbledore set the whole thing up.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, of course. And I’d assume that he made the other objects Horcruxes because of their ties to the founders of Hogwarts, given his ties to Salazar Slytherin?”</p><p> </p><p>“What ties?” Evans asked.</p><p> </p><p>“You won’t get anything out of them at the moment,” Ron whispered to her. “Not when they're on like this. Best thing to do is let them keep going, eventually they’ll get tired.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you know what ties?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. Voldy’s real name is Tom Marvolo Riddle Junior, he’s a half-blood descendant of Slytherin. You know Moaning Myrtle?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>“When he went to school at Hogwarts, he opened the Chamber of Secrets and the basilisk in it killed her.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Basilisk</em>!?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, your son fought it and won~ he was only in his second year.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s so cool!”</p><p> </p><p>“So our possible objects of interest are the time-turner that they used, the Elder wands, an old book and Nagini,” Regulus concluded.</p><p> </p><p>“How’d they get there?” Hugo asked his father.</p><p> </p><p>“Beats me,” Ron whispered back.</p>
