    <p>Disclaimer- I do not own either Tensei shitara ken deshita or Harry Potter respectively.</p><p>Before the story starts I suggest reading "I Was a Sword When I Reincarnated" otherwise known as "Tensei Shitara Ken Deshita" up to chapter 227 in the Web novel that you can find online.<br/>
this is so you can have a general idea of where Fran is Starting Out in this story and get acquainted with Fran and the other characters from TSKD</p><p>Other notes-<br/>
1. I will be trying to stick the plot of the Harry Potter books but will add things in because if I didn't this story would just end up being "Harry Potter but there someone from another world"</p><p>2. I am starting off from the second book from the HP series. not because I'm lazy but because Fran would make the challenges presented to the characters in the first book just not work (AKA Fran is too op for Sorcerers Stone) </p><p>I am very sorry for my crappy writing ability.</p><p>I will try to update as often as possible.</p><p>Please enjoy the story.</p>
