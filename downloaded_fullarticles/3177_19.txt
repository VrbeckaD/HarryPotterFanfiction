          <div class="userstuff"><p>Tadashi looked at the skeptical rookie with an amused quirk in his mouth. Lots of their new recruits were like this. They came looking for people to help them get started on the Path of a True Biker, but didn't really believe the rumors about their group.</p><p>"I don't know, it's really farfetched. Did it really happen the way you are telling it?" Such a suspicious child. Tadashi let his grin grow and made an expansive gesture towards the TV at the end of the bar.</p><p>"Take a look for yourself. On his helmet, see? It's our insignia"</p><p>The kid's eyes, predicatably, grew to the size of dinner plates when he caught sight of the detail. Almost immediately, his skeptical expression changed into a starry-eyed look Tadashi was becoming more and more accustomed to as of late.</p><p>"It's really true! The Greatest Biker, Skull-sama... was part of your group!"</p><p>Tadashi rearranged his smug expression into an appropriately grave and proud one. He didn't know why their leader had tricked the rude <em>gaijin </em>that showed no respect for them into getting a helmet with their insignia, but it was certainly paying off now.</p></div>
