    <p align="center">Chapter One</p>
<p dir="ltr">       Finding oneself in the middle of an alleyway in New York City at two in the morning was not a common occurrence in the life of Delaney Rigel. Then again with what she did in her spare time it was a bit surprising that it wasn’t. The body of the victim was laid out before her, a carnation held between the two hands, coins covering the eyes. There was no blood, no visible wound that the body was even dead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I told them not to touch anything,” the lead detective for the NYPD told her. “The minute we arrived we contacted the Auror’s, then well, you know the rest."</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Jessica said this was the second?” Lane asked as she knelt down to study the area.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jessica had been handling Lane's ability for assisting on crime scenes since Lane had been thirteen. If someone could right a book on Lane and the consequences of using her abilities it was Jessica Grant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Yes,” Grant answered.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jessica Grant had told him to only give Lane information if she asked for it, to keep it to yes and no, and limited detail. Behind them a mix of NYC police and Aurors were keeping people away from the scene. An Auror had put up a shield spell up that made passer buyers walk by ignoring the flashing lights, the cops, and the magic. In the twenty years since the Magical World came out, the law enforcement was one of the first to embrace what magic could do for them. This was one of them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I have permission to touch the body?” Lane looked up at the middle age detective.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The judges agreement came just before you showed up,” Grant assured her. "As did the head of your courts."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lane nodded. Despite it being the beginning of July, she was in faded jeans and a t-shirt, a hoodie was draped over her arm. Old running sneakers covered her feat. Pulling her black hair back into a messy bun, she stood up. If she had to use certain magic she would need the hoodie despite the heat.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I might not have to touch the body, but it’s always safe to have it in writing,” Lane told him. She looked around the alley. “A lot of strong magic was used.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“One of the Auror’s said the same thing, they said to us it might feel like static electricity,” Grant said. He had learned that in a training course as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s the closest description,” Lane replied. “Stay by me, if my nose starts to bleed...”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">“Get ready to catch you,” Grant finished for her. “Jessica gave us the full rundown.” Lane smiled.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jessica Grant had been the Auror on the case of Lane’s friend who was killed when Lane was twelve. It was then that Lane recognized her unique ability, going against her mother’s wishes, Lane agreed to help Jessica and the Auror’s with hard cases. At times she also consulted with the police to rule out if magic had been used.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Taking a deep breath, Lane focused on her magical core. Over the years she had learned to control what she could do, fine tune it, and how not to let it drain her core. When she opened her eyes again the world had shifted. Now the world was on a gray scale, the only color belonged to the body and the magic that surrounded it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Spells were fired at three different points, all centering on the chest,” Lane stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Yes,” Grant confirmed her statement. Jessica had said that it was okay to confirm what Lane said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The lead aurora that was working with Grant had now joined them. "She's seeing a different reality," Devon realized as he watched her. Grant looked at him. "She can access the magical plane if theories are right."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lane nodded as she stepped around the body to examine the three different points. It was three different spells, two of which were unforgivable. But they shared the same magical signature. Like fingerprints, every witch or wizard had different magical signature. Those that were related would have similarities but that was it. And Lane could see them all, see what spells they used, how powerful a spell it casted, and damage to the area that the spell might have caused. She could also detect certain poisons. Grant and Devon followed Lane as she walked around the alleyway, Jessica had warned him that Lane could drop even without signs of over use. Between Jessica and knowing that Lane’s oldest brother was the liaison of the DMLE for the United States to MCUSA, he was not letting her drop on his watch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s all from the same wand,” Lane said. “One person did this.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Grant stared at her. This changed the case in a huge way, instead of two or three people, they were looking for one.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Are you sure?" Devon asked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Same wand, same wand signatures," Lane informed the auror.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"This changes a lot," Grant stated to Devon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They are using a version of a deflecting charm, but in this case it is allowing them to produce the three spells as if they were coming from three spots,” Lane realized as she walked around the alley.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Making us think more than one person was involved,” Devon said. "Can you decipher where they stood?" Grant asked Lane. Devon and him worked on enough cases together over the years that he understood magic. Lane focused on the charm now and pointed toward the other entrance to the alley.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That’s where they stood when they cast the spells,” Lane informed him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Grant motioned to an auror and one of his guys to head in that direction. Lane pulled herself back into the real world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Your person is a very complicated individual,” Lane warned them. “Narcissistic, angry, vindictive. The victims are connected to him but he wants them to appear random. I’m going to wager that they are highly intelligent but their education won’t show that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Grant was writing this all down. He handed her a bottle of water that one of the officers gave him. She thanked him. "Your wand core is going to be a fire based ingredient," Lane informed Devon. "Flexible for the complexity of spells. They excel at charms."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Meaning when we find them, check for wards and traps," Devon told Grant so he could note it down.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This, it’s helped us a great deal,” Grant told her.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Not going to demand I pry more, tell you what he looked like?” Lane asked curiously.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I figure you would have told me that if you could,” Grant told her. “I take it you get asked those questions a lot?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">"With what you can do, kid, I would have been happy with the one person and one wand lead," Devon admitted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There is a list of people I won’t work with,” Lane told them. “You will not be on that list.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lane heard a familiar voice behind them. She turned to see several Auror’s standing straighter than they had been a few moments ago. Assistant Head to the DMLE, Oscar Rigel, had just entered the alleyway. Lane arched an eyebrow at him, he rarely was ever at one of her scenes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Working late?” Lane asked her oldest brother. Oscar bent down to kiss her on the cheek.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Could say the same about you,” Oscar told her. “You must be Grant, my people say a lot of good things about you and your team. Devon, she isn't being too much of a pain in the ass, is she?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Thank you, I’m honored,” Grant said as shook Oscar’s hand.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"No, she has been a joy," Devon informed Oscar. Most of those who worked for the DMLE were used to the siblings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Grant realized then that the siblings were adopted. Lane was pale where even in the dark alleyway her pale skin was reflected in the night, Grant could tell that Oscar was most likely Hispanic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Are you done?” Oscar asked his sister.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We just finished up,” Lane told him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Can I take her or do you need her?” Oscar asked the detective. “I can wait if you need to finish up.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“She has given us more than what we had a few hours ago,” Grant told him. “If I need anymore I can get in touch.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lane pulled into her back pocket and handed him a slim business card. “You can reach me at these numbers.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You must be good, no one gets those cards that Lane doesn’t like,” Oscar observed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After saying her goodbyes, Lane followed her brother to the Alley entrance where she saw his bike sitting there.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“No official car? Or Family car?” She teased.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Because we are making an unofficial visit to MCUSA,” Oscar informed her as he handed her the spare helmet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“At two in the morning?” Lane asked as she climbed on the back. “It’s closer to three now but yea.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What the hell is going on?” Lane asked him despite knowing he wouldn't answer her question.</p>
