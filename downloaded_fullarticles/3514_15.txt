<p>Breaking the Non-Traditional News</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Pansy?! What’s the emergency? We’re having dinner.”</p>
<p>“It’s savoury stuffed quail, my favourite.” </p>
<p>“Daddy, Mummy, sorry to interrupt, but I…we’ve news.” </p>
<p>“<i>We</i>? Oh, is that Daphne? Hello, dear.” </p>
<p>“Hello, Madam Parkinson. Mr Parkinson.” </p>
<p>“Why so formal? We’ve been friends with your parents forever. I remember when you announced you were marrying your teddy bear.” </p>
<p>“Speaking of—”</p>
<p>“Bears?” </p>
<p>“No, Mummy! Marriage.” </p>
<p>“Oh! You’ve found someone?! You’re so proud, independent, I’ve worried.” </p>
<p>“Yes, Mummy. It’s…Daphne and I are—”</p>
<p>“Are what? Spit it out, Pansy, while we’re still healthy!” </p>
<p>“We’re in love!” </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Daddy? Say something.” </p>
<p>“Damn. Your mother won the bet.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“You <i>bet</i> on my sexuality?!” </p>
<p>“No need for shouting, Pansy. Your father and I saw the writing on the wall ages ago. And, while we’d have preferred a son-in-law, at least you picked a worthy woman.” </p>
<p>“So wait. You…knew?” </p>
<p>“We guessed. Plus, Draco emailed.”</p>
<p>“You’ve…email?” </p>
<p>“Oh yes! Email is all the rage in the Sacred Twenty-Eight these days. There’s even a list serve.” </p>
<p>“I…wow.” </p>
<p>“So, are you girls engaged, then?” </p>
<p>“Yes, Mr Parkinson.” </p>
<p>“Call me Dad, Daphne.” </p>
<p>“I’ll try.” </p>
<p>“So, I’ve been thinking. How about a wedding picnic? A non-traditional wedding for a non-traditional couple. Pansy? Pansy?” </p>
