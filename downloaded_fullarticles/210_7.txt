    <p>
  <span>Harry glared at Ron, “That’s never been proven!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron folded his arms and said mutinously, “Yeah right, he gave you the invisibility cloak, told you what that daft mirror did </span>
  <em>
    <span>and </span>
  </em>
  <span>did nothing about the restricted section of the library being broken into by an invisible person, when he’d just given away a thing that made its wearer invisible, by the way, and he </span>
  <em>
    <span>knew</span>
  </em>
  <span> we were searching for stuff on Nicholas Flamel.”  He stuck out his chin, “He knew what he was doing alright.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry folded his arms across his own chest and glared back at his best friend, “We did that all ourselves! Dumbledore had nothing to do with it.”  His face was flushed with uneasy colour and his hair seemed to fairly crackle with energy. Dawn twisted her head to look at Connor and raised her eyebrows. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Uh-oh</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron’s eyes flashed as he drew himself up to his full height of just over six feet, “Arse.”  His hands fisted on his hips, “What about when Hagrid was arrested and he knew we were in that bloody cottage, eh? Or giving you and Hermione the time thingy and expecting you to sort out Buckbeak and bloody Sirus Black?”  His eyes rolled in their sockets, “The man’s barking, Harry, admit it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry was finding it hard to breath through the ball of rage in his chest and he felt his whole body start a fine trembling as he tried to get himself under control.  Although some of the most terrifying times of his life had come about through Dumbledore’s association with him, he firmly subscribed to Hagrid’s almost religious worship of the man and couldn’t bear the thought of people looking at the Professor in anyway but with respect.  His hand reached into his cloak and withdrew his wand, “You take that back!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron’s hand shot into his own robes and then his wand was pointed at Harry’s chest, “I will not!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn moved fast and knocked Harry’s arm up towards the ceiling as Connor deftly nipped behind Ron and grabbed the taller boy’s wrist to point the wand towards the floor.  He patted Ron on the shoulder as he snarled and tried to twist his wrist from Connor’s iron grip, “Trust me, you’ll thank me for this later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn planted herself squarely in front of Harry, “What the hell is with you?”  She eyed his shaking figure up and down and then glanced over her shoulder at Connor and Ron, “We’re approaching total meltdown here. We’re gonna go get a coffee.”  She took Harry’s arm and steered him towards the door, “Sorry about wrecking your shop.” Mr Ollivander nodded speechlessly as the sweet-faced girl with the amazing green eyes marched by him, clutching one of the wizarding world’s most famous heroes like he was a wayward toddler. “Connor, we’ll meet you back at the pub.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Connor nodded and kept a tight grip on Ron until Dawn had dragged Harry out the door and up the street.  He slowly let go of the boy’s wrist and took a careful step back, “You ok?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron nodded and scowled fiercely, “Sorry.”  He kicked savagely at a wooden chair against the wall, sending it skittering across the shop floor, “He’s just so bloody blind at times.”  His chest heaved as he fought to control his temper, “He’s my best mate but he gets me so angry and sometimes I just want to…to…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Connor ignored the furious protest from Mr Ollivander and thought of all the times he had wanted to knock Dawn clear across the room when she had thrown herself blindly into danger at a word from Giles or one of the others without a thought to the consequences.  He levelled a look of wry understanding at Ron and said simply, “Tell me about it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So Ron did.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn kept moving at a brisk walk until she reached her room at the Leaky Cauldron and then she shoved Harry unceremoniously down onto her bed. “Stay there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry shook his head and stood up, “Look, I’m fine. I’m sorry about before. I just need to be on my own for a while.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn cocked her head to one side and said quietly, “No. That’s exactly what you don’t need. I’m going down to order some coffee and then you are going to sit down and tell me all about it. If you move from this room while I’m gone then when I catch up with you, you’d better be pretty damn quick with that wand to stop me knocking your stupid head clean off.”  Harry blinked as she flashed a quick smile, “Clear?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He nodded and she turned to the door, “Ok. Be back in a few.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When she returned Harry was seated on the edge of the bed with his head bowed and his hands dangling between his thighs.  Dawn placed a tray containing a steaming pot, two mugs and some milk and sugar on the table beside the bed. “I got tea. Giles always drinks it when he’s stressed and you’re English so I figured it was probably the way to go.”  She grinned as Harry lifted his head, “Plus, I figured caffeine was </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> a good idea in the circumstances.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry gave a weak chuckle and Dawn patted him on the shoulder companionably, “That’s the way.”   She poured him a steaming mug of tea and liberally dosed it with sugar and added a splash of milk, “There, good for what ails ya.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry took the proffered mug, “Thanks.”  He sipped at the strong, sweet liquid and winced as it burned his tongue, “Sorry.  We shouldn’t have argued like that in front of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn poured herself a mug and then settled comfortably on the bed, crossing her legs and leaning back against the wall with a sigh.  She took a sip of tea and grimaced, “Ugh. I hate this stuff.” She smiled at Harry’s confused look; “Giles always gives it to me when I’m upset. It’s a comfort thing more than an enjoyable experience.”  She placed the mug carefully on the table and linked her hands behind her neck as she stretched slowly, “So what’s with you and the nuclear reaction to Ron?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry flushed and cradled the mug between his hands, “I just don’t like anyone slagging off the Professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn raised an eyebrow, “I get that. But if anyone’s earned the right to do it, it's Ron from what you guys told me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry stood up and paced restlessly up and down the room, “No one has the right to say those things about Professor Dumbledore.” He gestured with the hand still clutching the mug of tea and brown liquid sloshed out to splash against the wall. “You don’t know what he’s done for me.  The sacrifices he’s made to keep us all alive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn nodded and winced as the tea began to run down her wall, “Ok, so fill me in. Tell me what makes him so great.”  Her eyes flicked back to the wall, “But if you aren’t going to drink that stuff can you put it down? I’m thinking that if the room needed a little something extra they would have added flowers or something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry looked at the wall and flushed again,  “Oh. Sorry.” He handed the mug to Dawn and then scrubbed his hands over his face, “I don’t know what’s the matter with me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn placed his mug next to hers, “So talk to me and let's figure it out.”  She patted the bed, “Sit down and have a good rant and we’ll all feel better.”  A sly grin appeared on her face, “Or are you gonna go all English and avoid the question and button up that stiff upper lip? ‘Cos I gotta tell you, I don’t take rejection that well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry made a sound that was half sob, half laugh, “Me either.”  He moved to perch on the bed and buried his face in his hands again, “I just feel like I’m sinking so fast and I just can’t seem to get a grip on anything to keep me afloat.  Everyone expects me to do great things and sometimes it’s just an effort to remember how to get dressed in the morning.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn smiled encouragingly at the bent head, “See? Making progress already.  There’s one of your problems solved, you’ve got an advanced case of Woe-Is-Me syndrome as it's known in Sunnydale.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s mouth fell open and he stared at Dawn in shock, “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn scratched idly at her neck, “Basically it means you’re going for the pity vote.”  She frowned and slipped a hand under her t-shirt to scratch at her shoulder, “We get that a lot with Buffy. ‘ Woe-is-me, I’m the Slayer’, yada, yada. ‘Everyone expects me to go out and save the world’ and then off she trots and does it.”  She sighed with satisfaction as she tracked down her itch, “Aah.” Her eyes closed as she continued to scratch, “It’s a terrible thing to have people constantly expect you do stuff that you’re capable of.” Itch scratched, she withdrew her hand and opened her eyes to nod encouragingly at Harry, “Carry on.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry spluttered indignantly, “It's not that simple. You have no idea of the pressure that I’m under every single day.  The expectations that people have of me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn blinked, “Oh dear, you have got it bad.”  She leaned forward to rub his arm gently, “And all powerful inter-dimensional being here, remember?  I get pressure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry pulled furiously away from her soft touch, “You have no idea.  My parents died saving me, other people have died saving me and Hermione and her family nearly died this year just because she knew me and Voldemort thought he could use her to hurt me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn winked, “Got that one down too.”  She leaned forward to balance her chin in the cupped palm of her hand and propped her elbow on her knee, “It’s a Sunnydale way of life to get snatched at least once a year and be held in ransom to hurt the Slayer.”  She shrugged, “You get used to it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry jumped up again and whirled round to point a shaking finger at Dawn, “Hermione nearly </span>
  <em>
    <span>died</span>
  </em>
  <span>.  She could have been killed because of </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn nodded agreeably, “Uh-huh. But she didn’t. You got her back.”  She raised one hand and punched the air, “Go team Harry!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry kicked the wall and yelled furiously, “Don’t you </span>
  <em>
    <span>dare </span>
  </em>
  <span>laugh at me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn lowered her hand and leaned forward to peer at the sizeable dent in the plastered wall, “Who’s laughing?”  She looked at Harry’s apoplectic face, “And you know you’re paying for that, right?”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who the </span>
  <em>
    <span>hell</span>
  </em>
  <span> do you think you are?”  Harry was actually starting to foam at the mouth he was so mad. “How </span>
  <em>
    <span>dare </span>
  </em>
  <span>you sit and judge me like that? And laugh at me and…and…”  His voice cracked with rage rendering him momentarily speechless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think the point is, who the hell are </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”  Dawn watched with interest as the tips of his ears actually turned purple with rage. “You’ve spent too long listening to your own publicity and forgotten that you aren’t ‘Harry Potter, Great White Hope’, just Harry Potter, teenager.”  She nodded sagely, “Just like Albus Dumbledore is a powerful man and he’s done great things, but he’s human and he’s gonna screw up sometimes.” One eyebrow raised in faint condemnation, “Like the mistake of sending three children to fight a very evil man just because he thought it was the right thing to do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry shook his head, “No. That’s not the way it happened. He saved me. I didn’t know what I was and he sent for me and saved me” He swallowed back tears, “I would have stayed with the Dursleys forever and never known what I was.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn said quizzically, “The Dursleys?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry stared at her, “My…the people who brought me up.  They’re muggles and they didn’t like me much.” Dawn raised her eyebrows and waited for him to continue, after a slight pause Harry said reluctantly, “My mother’s sister and her husband. They took me in when my parents died and fed me.  They’ve got a son, Dudley, and he made my life a living hell when I was kid. They used to keep me in a cupboard under the stairs until Hagrid came and told me about Hogwarts.” His face softened as he remembered the wonder of receiving the first kindness in his life from the giant, “He came and took me away from the Dursleys and brought me home.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn frowned, “Wasn’t there anyone else who could have taken you?  There must have been other people that could have looked after you and kept you safe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry shook his head, “No. Professor Dumbledore said that I needed to grow up without the whole world looking at me and seeing the boy who killed the Dark Lord.  To help me be normal, he said.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dawn sniggered, “Well, I think we can safely say that plan backfired.”  She raised her eyebrows at Harry’s face, “What? Leaving you to grow up in an unloving, abusive home rather than giving you to people who would love and care for you even if you got a bit big headed?” She snorted, “Oh yeah, sterling effort, right there.”</span>
