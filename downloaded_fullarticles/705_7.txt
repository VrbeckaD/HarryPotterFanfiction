    <p>It all started on October thirteenth. It was the end of the world. Thirteen used to be her lucky number, until it only brought her destruction.</p><p>Too many tragedies unfolded involving the number thirteen for Petunia to still consider it lucky. Her parents died thirteen years ago when she was just a girl and left her feeling lost. Her relationship with her sister was forever tainted by the time she was thirteen years old over an argument that would always loom over her in her dreams, and now it was the number that represented the downfall of the human race.</p><p><strong>Thirteen minutes.</strong> That’s how long it took for you to turn once you were bit by someone you used to consider your neighbor, your friend, your family. That’s what she saw on the news, anyway. It was apparently like clockwork.</p><p>No scientist in the world could figure out how this virus came about, but it spread like wildfire.</p><p>Petunia was angry, but that wasn’t anything new. She was always angry with the world. She had been for years, but she was now especially angry with <em>herself.</em></p><p>As she watched the world burn on the news and other humans ripping into each other’s flesh, all she could think about was saving her sister. After all this time, that never changed. Maybe she was still hoping the number thirteen held some kind of magic.</p><p>And as she now ran through the streets with a shovel in her hand to get to her car, she counted the cracks on the side walk as she cracked former neighbor’s skulls. The only way to save yourself from one of the infected was to kill their brain, <em>to smash it into nothing.</em> All of their memories would no longer be recognizable; their existence would be lost. All they would be remembered for was their last moments, and Petunia didn’t think that was fair. <em>They would only be remembered as monsters. </em></p><p>The first person Petunia had to kill was her seventy-six year old neighbor Lucy. She became infected in her sleep, and she wasn’t even bit. Petunia was hardly spared as tears clouded her eyes and as she gasped a prayer. She cut herself on the kitchen knife she used to put Lucy down.</p><p>
  <strong>She had to give herself thirteen stitches.</strong>
</p><p>Petunia thought it was a sick joke, or maybe it was a sign. Whatever it was, it made her stomach churn. </p><p>As she made it to her car, she wiped off her shovel on her old ripped Levi jeans and concluded that she stepped on<em> thirteen</em> cracks and officially killed<em> thirteen</em> of the infected.</p><p>She hoped Lily would still be at her flat so they could run, but at the same time, Petunia hoped that Lily wouldn’t have to see a world like this any longer. The only problem was that this contradicted her feelings about hoping Lily would have to deal with the chaos she always felt internally.  It was a never ending battle of push and pull. </p><p>
  <strong>It took thirteen minutes to get to Lily’s flat, and she was still alive.</strong>
</p>
<hr/><p>“I can’t believe you came for me. I figured you would have ditched town by now,” Lily expressed bitterly, “That’s usually what you do. You just disappear without a trace. This would have been your perfect opportunity.”</p><p>Petunia chose to ignore her comment as she packed up the remaining supplies in Lily’s flat. She grabbed the red pocket knife that used to be her father’s and slipped it into her sister's bag. She bitterly thought about how it should have been gifted to <em>her</em> and not Lily. Red was Petunia’s favorite color, but small things like that never seemed to matter when it came to Petunia. </p><p>“We don’t have much time,” Petunia told her softly, “Do you have everything you need? I heard the wilderness up north is the safest place to escape. They are setting up refugee camps.”</p><p>She watched as Lily attempted to tie her short red hair in a pony-tail. Multiple strands of hair were falling in her face. If Petunia had been twelve again, she would have offered to assist her and find a way to make it stay in place, but not anymore.</p><p>Lily slung her army green backpack over her shoulder and took one last look at the photograph of their parents on her bedside table.</p><p>“I’m ready,” she declared.</p><p>Petunia nodded as she hiked her backpack over her shoulder, and she let Lily make her way out of her bedroom first.</p><p>She looked down one last time at her combat boots to make sure they were tied, and she tried to ignore the blood stain from her shovel on her jeans. Then she dared to look back at the photograph of her parent’s smiling up at her. Her mouth felt dry, and she contemplated on leaving it just like Lily was planning, but there was something magnetic about it. There was a pull she couldn't resist, sort of like when she decided she had to save her sister. </p><p>She couldn’t leave the photo there to die along with Lily’s old life, so she quickly grabbed it and stuffed it into her bag.</p><p>
  <em>What Lily didn't know wouldn't hurt her. </em>
</p>
<hr/><p>The first few days they were on the road they hardly spoke. Like when they were teenagers, Lily took it upon herself to put on their father’s old baseball cap once she finally decided her hair would no longer stay in a pony-tail. Petunia could have told her it wouldn’t work before they even left her flat.</p><p>The only time they spoke was when they stopped for the day to get some rest and assign shifts to watch out at night for the infected. Staying up alone was Petunia’s favorite part of the day.</p><p>But one morning, Petunia was woken up by the sound of her car running and the feeling of her old scratchy seat belt rubbing uncomfortably against her skin.</p><p>She sat up in her seat abruptly and realized she was now on the passenger side. Her long blonde hair was coming out of her French braid she did three days ago, and her mouth tasted like death. She turned to her left to see that Lily was driving well over the speed limit, and her window was down so her red hair was blowing wildly in the wind.</p><p>“How did you move me over?” Petunia asked groggily, “You can’t be that strong. How did I even sleep through that?”</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes, “You haven't slept in days. I'm not daft, and you would be surprised how strong I have had to become looking after myself all these years, Petunia.”</p><p>It was another jab, and Petunia knew they would never end as long as they lived, so she didn’t say anything. She just swallowed the taste of death and hoped Lily had nothing else to say. </p><p>Hours passed before they stopped to scavenge some food. They were at an old abandoned truck stop. The world had only ended three weeks ago, but it looked as though this place had been abandoned years ago.</p><p>“You can get the food while I look for medical supplies,” Lily offered, “Or we can do it the other way around. I don’t care. This place just gives me the creeps, so I want to leave as soon as possible.”</p><p>Petunia nodded, “I’ll get some food. We’ll meet up front again in fifteen minutes.”</p><p>Lily gave her a look that meant she understood as she grabbed their father’s old pocket knife from her cup holder. Then she was out of the car in a flash.</p><p>Petunia decided to take her time. She was still half asleep and didn’t want to put herself in anymore danger than necessary. She closed her eyes for a moment and rested her head against the back of her head rest.</p><p><em>That was until she heard Lily yelling.</em> She must have dozed off. </p><p>Petunia was out of the car and running toward her sister’s voice.</p><p>All she could feel was panic, and all she could hear was panic.</p><p>This could not be the end.<em> No, no, no.</em></p><p>As she ran around to the back of the truck stop with her shovel in hand, she was surprised to see that Lily was being held hostage by a<em> living</em> human with a knife to her throat.</p><p>“Let me go, you bastard!” Lily shouted. She was struggling to get out of her captor’s grip.</p><p>Petunia lifted her shovel higher in the air.</p><p>“Let my sister go,” Petunia said calmly, “We can talk about this. You can have all our supplies.”</p><p>Lily shot her a look like she was crazy. Her green eyes were frantic with rage.</p><p>“Don’t negotiate with these assholes, Petunia! Are you crazy?”</p><p>“It might be the only way to keep you alive, Lily!” Petunia argued back.</p><p>“Since when do you care about keeping me alive?” Lily spat.</p><p><em>She always had</em>, she wanted to say. Instead, she just stayed silent.</p><p>Petunia almost forgot Lily’s captor was there until he started to chuckle.</p><p>“Well, well, it looks like we have some family tension. I’m used to that,” he commented, “But don’t worry, Petunia. I don’t want to harm your sister. Like you said, all I want is supplies.”</p><p>“Then I can show them to you,” Petunia stated calmly, “Just let her go.”</p><p>The man’s grey eyes studied her cautiously, but he surprised her by letting Lily go.</p><p>Lily stumbled forward and toward Petunia, but before Petunia could stop her, Lily had turned back around to punch him in the face.</p><p>The man stumbled back, and Petunia braced herself for the upcoming rage. His knife fell out of his hand, and Lily quickly snatched it from the ground before he could.</p><p>“That’s what you get for trying to slit my throat, you dick,” Lily told him.</p><p>Petunia couldn’t help but snort, and that’s when she heard two people chuckling behind them.</p><p>Lily straightened her cap on her head and turned around to the sound of their voices, but Petunia kept her eyes forward as she studied the man on the ground. He was spitting up blood from Lily’s punch.</p><p>“Reg, what did I tell you?” One of the men said, “Threats don’t get you anywhere unless you’re man enough to stand your ground.”</p><p>Petunia took this opportunity to turn around to see the other men approaching them. The one that spoke was smirking, and he looked shockingly similar to the one that was holding Lily captive. The only difference was that his black hair was longer and wavy, and his nose wasn’t as long. They shared the same grey eyes.</p><p>“Well, we need supplies,” the man named Reg replied, “And besides, she looked a lot weaker than she apparently is.”</p><p>“So you were going to kill me?” Lily spat, “I’d like to see you try that again.”</p><p>The man with the long hair watched Lily in admiration, and he had the audacity to approach her and put his arm around her shoulders. Lily roughly shrugged him off.</p><p>The other man accompanying them stayed silent. His light brown hair was slightly in his eyes, and that’s when Petunia noticed the scar occupying his left cheek. He noticed her staring, and she watched as he touched it with his hand self-consciously. Petunia quickly looked away.</p><p>“I’m Sirius Black, and this is my stupid brother Regulus,” the long-haired one told them, “And this is my best friend Remus Lupin. We are just trying to survive, just like you two lovely ladies. Do you two have names?”</p><p>“Like we would tell you,” Lily muttered, but Petunia shot her a look.</p><p>If Petunia was anything, it was <em>perceptive.</em> She could see these men truly meant no harm by the cautious and insecure look in Remus’s eyes and the regretful look in Regulus'. Petunia couldn’t stop staring at him, and she could see in the corner of her eye that Sirius noticed, but he didn’t comment.</p><p>“My name is Petunia Evans,” she told them, “And this is my sister Lily. Please excuse her temper, it has always gotten her into trouble.”</p><p>Lily glared at her, but Sirius smiled.</p><p>“Well, Lily Evans,” he told her, “It seems we have that in common.”</p><p>He was attractive, and Petunia could tell that Lily was well aware of the fact even through her anger. Her face turned as red as her hair, but she quickly stomped away and back toward Petunia’s car in rage.</p><p>Petunia knew she should follow her, but she was still watching Regulus. He was trying to wipe blood off of his face with his frayed sleeve, and he was picking at scabs on his knuckles. He was actively trying to avoid Petunia’s gaze. <em>Was it shame?</em> Did he feel bad for holding Lily against her will? <em>Or was it something more?</em></p><p>Sirius must have walked off and followed Lily, because only Remus was left standing with them and cleared his throat to distract Petunia from her thoughts.</p><p>“Well,” he said calmly, “I assume we can work out a deal? Maybe we can trade supplies. I can assure you Regulus was not going to kill your sister. He just acts rashly in fear.”</p><p>Petunia finally took her eyes off of Regulus and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.</p><p>“Or,” Petunia wagered, “Maybe we can just travel together. The more bodies we have, the safer we will be.”</p><p>“You trust us already?” Remus asked skeptically, “Right after Regulus held your sister at knife point? I know I said that he wasn't going to kill your sister but-”</p><p>Regulus’ head finally shot up after Remus’ comment, but he stayed silent. That’s when he made eye contact with Petunia. His eyes were soft, though he tried to his hardest to make them appear cold and hard. She could see his inner battle, and that’s when she realized they were no different. <em>Maybe thirteen was once his lucky number, too.</em></p><p>“I do trust you,” Petunia told him honestly, “And we need each other to survive.”</p><p>Remus nodded in agreement and motioned that she should follow him back to the parking lot, but Regulus didn’t look away from Petunia as she started to follow him. Petunia would be lying if she said his gaze made her uncomfortable. If anything, <em>it made her feel safe.</em></p>
