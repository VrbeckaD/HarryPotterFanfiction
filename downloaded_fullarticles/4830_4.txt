    <p>“Alison, Alison, Alison Grey!”</p><p>She snapped up, her chair almost falling back as she did, the Slytherin guys on either side of her sneering at her clumsiness.</p><p> “Now that you have decided to join us, could you please try to turn your owl into a nice pocket watch”</p><p>She picked up her wand gave it a flick and she had an intricate little pocket watch on her table.  Everyone looked at her including the professor.</p><p>“Thank you Alison for demonstrating”, he looked at the clock… “oh we have two minutes left, I am going to give back your exams.  Please try to study more next time, the class average was a 70, and this was the easy stuff guys.”</p><p>A Hufflepuff in the front row raised her hand “what was the highest grade?”</p><p>“I am not sure if the person with that grade would like me to share, but I will say it was at least a 90.”  The bell rang “Thank you class, don’t forget to practice that spell this week, I will see you on Friday”  </p><p>Alison packed up her books and was almost out the door with her test folded to hide the score.</p><p>“Alison” she stopped “Could you stay back for a minute?”</p><p>Everyone else left, she walked to the front of the room and took a seat on the front table.</p><p>“Professor Lupin I’m sorry about class I couldn’t sleep last night and…….” He cut her off.</p><p>“Alison it’s ok, I actually wanted to talk to you about your test.  I have never heard you say two words in class and you never try the practice spells or answer questions in class.  So how do you pull off the highest grade in the class; and I’m not accusing you of cheating, based on who you are next to that would not be possible.”  Professor Lupin looked puzzled.</p><p>Alison didn’t know what to say so she just said “Transfigurations is easy?”</p><p>Professor Lupin laughed “I can see that, a fifth year student in a seventh year class, I’m impressed.  Skills like that are usually only in…”  He stared at her for a minute.  “Alison I need to ask you something, and feel free to not answer, but  I am curious, are you an animagous?”  </p><p>Alison looked away, how could he  know, this is why she doesn’t participate in class.  She decided to ask a question first.  “Are you an animagous professor, or a metamorphamagous like your mother Tonks?”</p><p>He looked like he was expecting this question.  “Honestly Alison, I’m like my mother, I inherited her gift, if you can call it that.  Is that what you are, are you a metamorphamagous?”  She nodded her head.  “Than I understand why you couldn’t sleep last night.  I was up all night listening to the ministry’s new regulations for animegi and metamorphamegi.  I pity those that are not registered, the ministry will start to hunt them down if they don’t come forward”</p><p>Alison didn’t reply to that, unfortunately she did not register yet, and since she is 16, she was technically illegally using her abilities.  Lupin saw the look on her face.</p><p>“Alison you have to register, you could be expelled if the Headmaster finds out”  <br/>“I know, but if I register the ministry will keep me there until I am considered safe and I don’t want to be stuck in the ministry for weeks while I try to pass all of their tests.  Professor Lupin could you please help me, once I become more skilled at transforming I promise I will register, and I can show them that they don’t need to keep me at the ministry.”</p><p>Professor Lupin paced around his classroom, thinking about Alison’s request.</p><p>“Very well, but we can’t practice in the school, there are too many protection spells.  Friday’s class is in the Forbidden Forest, stay after class and we can start then, and you can’t tell anyone or I will lose my job and you will be expelled and arrested.”</p><p>“Thank you Professor Lupin”  Alison grabbed her bag and test, she was in such a good mood she didn’t notice the three idiots waiting just outside the classroom.  Unfortunately she walked right into the arms of Crabbe.  Crabbe, Don and Aaron had waited for Alison to leave, knowing that after Transfigurations there was never anyone in the hall.</p><p>Don grabbed Alison’s bag and Aaron grabbed her test.  Alison reached for her wand, but remembered that it was still in her bag.  Crabbe grabbed her arms, spun her back to him, and pulled her body against his.  Alison tried to run but they were all twice her size.  She was about to scream, but she could feel Crabbe’s wand pressing into her spine.  They all laughed as she struggled.</p><p>“Hey Aaron what do you think the Professor wanted with this little mudblood.” Crabbe sneered, his wand slowly moving up her spine.  <br/>“Bet he was trying to flunk her for sleeping in class.”  <br/>Don opened her test and laughed.  “I bet I know what he wanted, he showed Crabbe and Aaron her test with a large 100 in the top right corner.  Alison tried to struggle, but Crabbe’s wand only pressed further into her back.  A small gasp left her mouth.  <br/>“Bet he was having fun with his little teacher’s pet.  How else would she pass, she’s just a little slut.”<br/>By now Crabbe had one giant arm around her shoulders and his wand poking into her neck.  Crabbe’s free hand started moving down her chest “I wonder what its like to sleep with a mudblood” His hand moving down her chest, as Aaron and Don started to move in on her.  Crabbe was crushing her breast with his giant hands.  Aaron stepped closer stroked his hand down Alison’s cheek.  “She puts on such an innocent act.”  Don had started pulling up her skirt…</p><p>The door to Lupin’s office started to open, and Crabbe let go of Alison immediately.  Aaron dropped her bag and Don dropped her test, they were just turning the corner when Professor Lupin walked out to see Alison picking her things off the floor.  She gave him a convincing smile and he walked toward his next classroom.</p>
