    <p>            Hermione Granger was walking home from work on a cold Friday evening. She liked <em>walking</em> home from work, even though she could apparate straight into her studio flat. But she did it because it made her appreciative of her freedom. Even more, that is. Because since the war almost two years prior, she had learned to appreciate a lot that people always took for granted. It was a gift that she could walk freely and fearlessly through these streets. Well, not so fearlessly, since her neighborhood, muggle, was a bit prone to having some troublemakers. There were also very few Death Eaters still left on the loose, but they didn’t pose too much trouble, because they wanted to protect themselves and not be thrown in Azkabam. Still, it was nothing compared to fearing for your life daily, and fearing for the end of the magical world she had been thrown in when she was a child of just eleven, and that had enchanted her so much.  It would probably have been the end of the world as a whole, actually. As they knew it, at least.</p><p>            She worked at the Ministry, at the Magical Creatures Department. She was relatively new at her job, since she had only finished her apprenticeship a few months back – top marks and earlier than it would usually take, of course. Still, she wasn’t high up on the chain of command, and she didn’t make a lot of money – hence the studio flat in the bad neighborhood – but she liked it. She enjoyed what she did and was damn good at it.</p><p>            Her parents… well, she had already accepted that they were lost to her. At least they were alive. And one of the perks of this job was the possibility of traveling quite a bit as she escalated in the ranks, to tend to and study creatures in other countries. She had already planned it all, of course. When she did begin to travel, she would stop in Australia on the way back and check on them. She already had managed to do it a few times. Once or twice when she traveled for the apprenticeship, and once on the week she took off to celebrate having graduated early, using the savings account they had set up for her when she was a kid. She had made appointments in their little practice there and had already managed to leave a mark. They knew her. They were friendly. They were pen pals to the odd girl who went to Australia on business a lot and chose to have her teeth checked up there instead of at home. It wasn’t the ideal situation, but it was good. She could live with it. Maybe it could grow into something more as she visited more often.</p><p>            Whatever loneliness she felt was diminished by the fact that she was good friends with everyone from school still. Harry and Ron worked at the Ministry as well, so she would often have lunch with them. Ginny and Harry were set to be married soon, so she was a constant presence too. Luna was a reporter for her dad’s magazine, and they often ran into each other at the Ministry and went out for drinks. Neville was taking an apprenticeship in Herbology at Hogwarts now, and that led her to be invited to the castle often, especially for feasts. So she caught up with Neville and all the Professors she held dearly in her heart. The only one who wasn’t there anymore was Professor Snape, though Professor Sprout would be leaving very soon, making room for Neville to teach there.</p><p>            Hermione wasn’t quite sure where Professor Snape had run off to after all the commotion of the war had passed, but she regretted not being able to contact him and at least thank him for everything. She wasn’t sure someone ever did thank him. He managed, now, to avoid the papers masterfully, so he was never mentioned, but right after the war, during his convalescing, when he was on the cover every day, not all the words they had for him were nice, she saw. It actually made her furious.</p><p>           </p><p>            Despite still being in contact with almost everyone, she had to admit that things were changing. She was bound to be lonely at some point because Harry had Ginny, Ron had Lavender, and now, even Luna and Neville were together. Luna apparently had gone to Hogwarts to interview Professor Sprout about some plant that most likely didn’t even exist outside her and her father’s minds, and Neville had finally managed to make her notice him more affectionately. They really hit it off. It had come as a surprise to Hermione when they showed up hand in hand for drinks the previous week. She had invited only Luna, so she wouldn’t be the fifth wheel sitting with Harry, Gin, Ron and Lavender. Her plan had obviously backfired, and she sat there feeling awkward and foolish among the couples. It looked as if there would be a lot of that from now on. Not to mention they would naturally and gradually drift apart from her. Couples always did, from single friends. Harry and Ginny, with a wedding date already set, had already begun the process.</p><p>Hermione had no prospects for a partner or for getting one any time soon. It had taken a couple of weeks of dating Ron and a few insistent times in the sack with him for them to come to terms with the fact they had no chemistry and nothing in common to be more than just friends. They ended on good terms and mostly didn’t even remember they had been together, although Ron went back to getting on Hermione’s nerves more than she wished was the case, which made her hate him as if they hadn’t ended things as friends sometimes.</p><p>After dating him, she had focused on her studies, and found no one else to date. She was now more open to the possibilities, but was convinced there was nothing out there for her. The guys her age and single that she worked with were all idiots. Her neighbors were mostly low-lives. And when she went out for drinks with her friends, she never really paid attention to the guys at the bar. She was there to catch up with her friends, after all. Besides, if no one came up to her, it was because she was uninteresting. And she didn’t really fancy the idea of picking men up. She was a bit too romantic to get someone in this modern age, perhaps.</p><p>But there was one possibility she could maybe consider more closely…</p><p>Part of Hermione’s routine of walking home consisted on, for most of the weekdays, stopping by a charming little grocery store. She lived right around the corner from it, above a café. She liked that grocery store because it was clean and tidy and cheap. So when she didn’t decide to dine out – alone, on most days, or with her friends once every three weeks more or less – or order takeaway, and didn’t have any leftovers, she stopped there to pick up a frozen dinner for her or a few items she could whip up into something quickly.</p><p>She was therefore quite friendly with those who worked there and with a few of the regular customers. And among the employees was Max, a cute 20 year old who worked there to try to save up for school. He had short blond hair and amazing blue eyes, and Hermione was pretty sure he shyly hit on her a few times. There were days, when she was most lonely or depressed and desperate, that she thought about taking him up on his offer when he finally did ask her out, as she thought he was working up the nerve to do, or of asking him out first. On other days, though, she realized he was probably just as silly as Ron, or any other guy that age. And they probably wouldn’t have much in common, if their small talk so far was any indicative.</p><p>Hermione stopped at the grocery store and admired the vegetables on the display under the marquee outside, thinking up what she could make. Maybe some vegetable soup. Soup was warm and comforting.</p><p>“Hey, Hermione!”</p><p>She looked up. “Oh hey, Max.” She smiled.</p><p>“Not hitting the frozen section today?”</p><p>“I make no promises. The night is young.”</p><p>Max smiled as he dumped some empty cardboard boxes in the rubbish bin and headed back into the store, not once taking his eyes off her until he was inside and had to turn behind a shelf to stock it. Hermione smiled. It was nice to be admired. It did not happen too often to her.</p><p>Another employee came running out of the store in her green apron, looking very flushed.</p><p>“Cindy?” Hermione asked.</p><p>“Did I miss him? Is it time?”</p><p>“Oh!” Hermione laughed. “No, not yet.”</p><p>In a few seconds though, they could hear the roar of an engine coming from the distance, getting closer. Hermione turned around and stood beside Cindy, facing the street, to watch.</p><p>It was the mystery man they both, along with a few female customers at the store, liked to admire – and probably fantasize about. He rode by on his motorcycle every day at around the same time, probably going home from work, and God bless the traffic light in front of the store that was almost always red for him. He stopped and they stared, often exchanging crude, naughty comments.</p><p>He was always clad in black boots, black denims and a black leather jacket. His helmet was black, with a tinted visor, and the only thing of his that was revealed was his longish jet black hair, tied at the nape of his neck, pouring out from under his helmet onto his back. Every once in a while he would not be wearing gloves, and his large hands and long fingers would incite many comments as well.</p><p>The motorcycle was, surprisingly, black as well. And large, and loud and wide, with wide tires. So fucking sexy. Even though no one knew what he actually looked like, he fueled many a wet dream. Especially since one could see, even if he was all covered in black, that he had a nice body. He was not fat, nor was he too skinny and fragile. He looked like he could have one of those nice, tight bodies, not too buff like he was a gym freak, but toned and firm and nice to feel on top of you. The denims marked his nice thighs and the leather jacket, what looked like muscular arms that would know how to fucking hold you and just… take you. Just those impressions, along with the bike, apparently were more than enough.</p><p>While he was stopped there, the girls just looked and got frisky, some trying to be discrete and pretending to choose vegetables, others downright staring. He looked towards them, which rarely ever happened in all these months. Cindy and Hermione, who were just staring, seemed to be the main targets of the gaze under the tinted visor. But Cindy was quick to make herself look busy. Hermione just stared on, dreamily. He just kept looking in that direction, and not for the first time, Hermione had the impression he was indeed staring at her. Not that she could really tell, with that damned helmet.</p><p>The light turned green and he still looked at her. He took his foot off the ground and balanced himself on the vehicle once again, pushing it into gear and accelerating to ride off, all while he still looked at her. Hermione fanned herself.</p><p>“Oh, I bet he can shag like a fucking machine,” Cindy said. Hermione just nodded. She wouldn’t know what that felt like.</p><p>She arrived home with the makings of her pumpkin soup and got to work. She had her soup, and then popped some popcorn so her mouth could be distracted as she watched a couple of movies. Sleep did not come easily to her, and she found herself still feeling frisky. Since she was really shy about masturbation and couldn’t bring herself to actually touch herself properly, what she did was press her thighs together to apply the pressure her clit demanded while she thought about what that biker looked like, what he could do to her. What it would feel like to ride his bike, have it rumbling in between her legs. To ride him, be fucked into oblivion. She managed to achieve some pleasure, which unfortunately she did not know was but a fraction of what she was capable of feeling, and bliss, then sleepiness by consequence hit her. She slept peacefully and heavily.</p><p>During the next week, she had absolutely no plans after work, so her routine was to be the same. Walk home, stop by the grocery store, flirt innocently and to no results with Max, gawk at the motorcycle bad boy with Cindy and a neighbor or two who happened to be there. Go home, eat, sleep. But on Monday, a dead house elf under suspicious circumstances kept her at work for only 10 minutes over her time, and it was enough to miss him.</p><p>On Tuesday she was held behind for a few minutes by some commotion in the atrium. Apparently, Shackelbolt was announcing something or other and the press was there. She was never one for much politics to actually pay attention to what it was he was to say. As long as they were still safe, it was all good. And at least he being there kept the cameras off of her for a change. Still, it had been hard to navigate past them and to the surface.</p><p>So she walked faster than she had ever walked, as to not miss him. Geez, wasn’t that a sad little life she led? Where the most fun she had was watching a complete stranger go by and talk dirty about him to acquaintances from the street. But she enjoyed it. And she would not miss him two days in a row, no.</p><p>She was reaching the corner of the street, and she could hear the roar of his engine coming. So she hurried her step. The best view was when she stood in front of the grocery store, where he stopped for the light. She had to get there.</p><p>She hurried, almost ran, and foolishly looked back as she did, to see him coming from the street opposite the one she had come from. And of course her luck would have it that the pavement had a thin layer of ice on it – it wasn’t even that cold out anymore for Merlin’s sake – and she slipped and stumbled on one of the vegetable display racks, falling down full force to the ground, taking the display and potatoes and carrots with her. The display landed on her already sprained foot, from her tumble, and managed to break it, she was sure. It hurt like hell and she tried to hold back her tears as she awkwardly pulled herself to sit up. She didn’t need any more embarrassment today. Or for the whole month, surely. So she would not cry.</p><p>Cindy, Max, and about four more customers gathered around her, trying to help.</p><p>“Here, let me help you up,” Max said, pulling on her from behind, holding her under her arms.</p><p>“No, no, wait,” she pleaded. “I don’t think I can stand just yet. My foot hurts.”</p><p>“Cindy, go inside and call an ambulance then,” Max ordered.</p><p>“No, no, it’s probably just a sprain,” she tried. She didn’t want to go to a muggle hospital. They would put a cast on her, and she’d have to be off her feet for God knows how long. At St. Mungo’s they’d have her ready in no time. But how would she explain, ask someone to take her there. Oh fuck, the downsides of living among muggles. She would have to find a way to go on her own. Maybe there was a spell she could cast that would enable her to walk – limp – to an alley an apparate to St. Mungo’s. She desperately tried to remember one as Max said something about calling the ambulance anyway and Cindy began to go into the store.</p><p>“Get out of my way,” Hermione heard a strangely familiar, silky, male voice say rudely, which oddly was the tone that was familiar to that voice. The man this voice belonged to pushed aside the customers that crowded her and made himself seen. It was the mystery rider in black. Sans helmet this time, and Hermione could see it was no one other than Severus Snape. Holy shit. As if she wasn’t mortified enough of making such a scene. And all of it for the benefit of seeing him. Oh God. Oh Merlin. Had he noticed? He already knew it was her, obviously. That’s why he stared sometimes. Oh God, oh God, oh God. That’s why he stopped.</p><p>He knelt before her and felt her ankle. She tried not to wince or whimper but he knew it was broken as he locked his dark, deep eyes with hers.</p><p>“Hey, hey, who are you?” Max asked, kind of possessive about Hermione. “Get away from her, she’s hurt.” He always did make himself scarce when he noticed the women were assembling to drool over the mystery rider. He was jealous.</p><p>Strangely, that angered Hermione. Who the fuck was he to her, really, to fend off other men like this from her? Great fucking time to be a man and grow a pair when he hadn’t even asked her out. And Snape was the only one who could maybe get her to St. Mungo’s. If he was willing. He wouldn’t have stopped if he wasn’t. Right?</p><p>“No shit she’s hurt, Sherlock Holmes. Who the fuck are <em>you</em>?” Snape spat with an angry stare that made Max back down.</p><p>“It’s okay Max, I know him,” she said.</p><p>“You <em>know</em> him?” Max and Cindy asked in unison.</p><p>She ignored that as Snape touched her ankle over her jeans again and she felt the tingles of a spell working in her leg. She looked at him inquisitively and he only stared at her, stoic.</p><p>“It’s just a sprain. I can take her to a hospital.” He started to help her up and she felt she really could venture to stand as she was pulled up by his strong hands. That was a good pain relief spell right there.</p><p>“On a bike?” Max asked with disdain.</p><p>“Would you rather take her on foot?” Snape answered sardonically.</p><p>Once she was up and not touching her broken foot to the ground, Snape hoisted her up by the waist, her legs dangling a few inches from the ground, and walked to his bike. He mounted it and gently pulled her broken leg, the right one, over the bike, in front of him, so that she mounted the vehicle facing him. Mounted him, really, she thought as she blushed. His helmet was strapped to the back.</p><p>His arms cradled her on either side as he held onto the handles and turned the bike on.</p><p>“Hold on tight, Granger,” he said near her ear and she tightened her grip around his waist and nuzzled his neck, so her head was not blocking his view. She tried to ignore the fact that his voice so close to her ear made her whole body tingle and all her hairs stand on end.</p><p>He accelerated and they rode off. Boy, that would give her and Cindy a lot to talk about tomorrow.</p>
