    <p>Harry and Draco sat in a Compartment on the Hogwarts express together. The rest of their crew hadn’t found them yet. Their engagement had been finalized in the last week of summer and Harry was allowed to wear the ring that had hung around his neck all of last year and the summer on his left ring finger. He had Sirius go to his vault, since he was his legal guardian he could do so, and he got the Potter Family ring. Harry had given it to Draco when the documents had been signed.</p><p>The door to their compartment opened and they expected to see Pansy or even Blaise.</p><p>“Hi” a redheaded girl entered. “I’m Ginny Weasley.” She held her hand out.</p><p>“Harry” he shook her hand. “Are you related to Ronald?”</p><p>“Yes. He’s my brother. I wanted to apologize for his behavior.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“I also wanted to introduce myself. Dumbeldore came to my house this summer and wanted me to win you over with my ‘feminine charms’ and I just wanted to warn you. I don’t like the old coot.” She said. “I also don’t swing that way, if you understand my meaning.”</p><p>“We do.” Harry laughed. “We’re engaged.” Ginny didn’t bat a lash at that. This Weasley was different than her brother. “Thank you for the warning. What’s that?” he said as he pointed to a book on her lap. Draco snatched it.</p><p>“Oh. Someone slipped it into my cauldron at Flourish and Blotts. Not sure what it is, but it keeps mentioning the heir of slytherin and the Chamber of Secrets.”</p><p>“Strange” Draco said as he opened the leather bound book to see nothing there. “It’s empty.”</p><p>“Yeah. You have to write in it, it will write back.”</p><p>Draco took out a quill and wrote Hello into the journal. He was surprised when it wrote back. “You know. I’ve heard of the Chamber of secrets. Salazar Slytherin supposedly made it beneath the school.” Draco looked contemplative for a second. “Don’t know who the slytherin heir is though, I know you’re a descendant of Godric Harry.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yeah. I can look into the slytherin lineage, but I thought it had died out.”</p><p>Ginny and Harry nodded. Then Hermione, Daphne, Crabbe, Goyle, Neville, Pansy, and Blaise entered the cabin.</p><p>“Hey!” Blaise said.</p><p>“Hey Blaise, this is Ginny Weasley” Harry said while Draco continued to write in the book.</p><p>“Nice to meet you.” Blaise said as he kissed the girls hand. “So it’s official.” He motioned to Harry’s ring finger.</p><p>“Yeah. The contract was signed last week.” Harry answered. Pansy looked put out.</p><p>“My parents were thinking about approaching the Parkinsons for a marriage contract since the Malfoy one fell through.” Blaise said, his eyes didn’t stray from Harry’s face. Pansy perked up and Draco smirked.</p><p>“Really?” Pansy asked.</p><p>“Yeah. We’re planning on staying in England for the foreseeable future.” Blaise supplied finally looking at the girl. She smiled.</p><p>“So Ginny, what house do you think you’ll be in?” Daphne asked.</p><p>“Probably Gryffindor.” Ginny shrugged.</p><p>“Figures. Your whole family is in that house.” Draco supplied.</p><p>“Yeah. I might’ve gone into slytherin but I think that Ron might actually murder me in my sleep if that happens.”</p><p>The compartment door opened and a beautiful blonde stood in the doorway. “Hello. Has anyone seen a pigmy puff?” she asked slightly distractedly and her eyes wouldn’t’ focus on one person.</p><p>“No, but I can help you look.” Harry said as he rose from the seat. Draco tried to pull him back. “Let me go Draco, the poor girl needs help.” Draco reluctantly let go.</p><p>“Make sure to come back before we reach the station.” He yelled after his fiancé.</p><p>Harry didn’t answer. “I’m Harry by the way” he said as they walked along.</p><p>“I’m Luna” She looked at him straight on.</p><p>“The whole looney thing’s an act isn’t it?”</p><p>“Yes. I’m quite bright. I also have the sight. My father told me to hide it from people so I wouldn’t get taken.”</p><p>“Why tell me then?”</p><p>“I saw what you’re meant to do. I wanted to be your friend. I know you value honesty, plus it’ll help to have someone who knows at school.” Harry nodded.</p><p>“You didn’t actually lose a pigmy puff did you?”</p><p>“No, she’s right here.” Luna pulled a purple puff from her robes. “Her name’s Polly. Polly the Puff.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you Polly.” Harry said seriously. “This is Angie” Harry said motioning to his neck.</p><p>“Is that a boomslang?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Can I borrow her sometime? I’m hoping to become a magizoologist when I graduate.”</p><p>“I’m not comfortable with that. But I’ll let you hold her when Polly isn’t around.”</p><p>Luna nodded. “Well, I have to go back to being Loony for a while Harry. It was quite nice to meet you.”</p><p>“You as well Luna” Harry said as he made his way back to his compartment. He opened the door to find everyone staring at Ginny. “What did I miss?”</p><p>Draco looked at him. “Seems Ron has gone to Durmstrong. He didn’t want to be in the same year as his younger sister.”</p><p>“Oh.” Harry said. “I almost feel bad for the poor bloke.” Draco looked at Harry incredulously. “What? I said almost.”</p><p>“He really shouldn’t have taken on Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter.” Ginny said.</p><p>“So, any suspicions on who slipped that book to you?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Well. I did see someone who the twins said was Nott.” Ginny said.</p><p>“Theo isn’t the brightest of the bunch. His father isn’t either.”</p><p>Luna walked passed their compartment and Harry leapt up. “Luna!” He called. The girl turned. “I want to introduce you to someone.” The girl came up to him. He led her into the compartment. “This is Ginny. She’s a first year like yourself.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you…?” Ginny started.</p><p>“Luna. You’re lacking wrackspurts. They’re all around everyone else on the express.” The girl said.</p><p>“Well, yes. I do tend to have a clear head. Nice Spectrespecs.”</p><p>Luna smiled brightly. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Luna, would you accompany Ginny on the first year boat ride?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Only if she’ll wear my extra butterbeer cork necklace, I don’t feel like being attacked by nargles.” She took a necklace off and held it out to Ginny.</p><p>“Why not! I don’t particularly like nargles either. Come on Luna, we need to put on our robes.” Ginny said. Harry smiled.</p><p>“We have to put on our robes as well guys.” Harry said.</p><p>The guys left the room while the girls changes and the same went for the boys. They were all excited to start their second year. </p>
