  <span>“What do you mean no one told them that Dad died? I thought you were,” Steve held the phone to his ear. They’d just put away Hiro Noshimori for kidnapping his sister and </span>
  <em>
    <span>now</span>
  </em>
  <span> she wanted to tell him that their mother’s family didn’t know their father had died? Not that it mattered much considering Lily had died a few years ago and Petunia didn’t talk to them much either way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey! I tried, multiple times, but all Petunia wanted to talk about was her husband and kid. You know I can barely tolerate her,” Mary groaned. She’d touched down in New York not too long ago and was settling into her apartment. “I’m sorry, Steve. Ever since Lily died we haven’t had much contact with them and Petunia has always been so difficult to deal with. Besides, telling her over the phone seemed cruel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Steve sighed and ran a hand over his face. As annoyed as he was about this situation he understood where Mary was coming from. His sister had never been any good at dealing with giving bad news. “Alright, I’ll handle it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I really am sorry, Steve.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He dropped down into his desk chair. “It’s ok, besides, this will give me a chance to check in on Harry. I haven’t seen him since James and Lily visited us before they passed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh! Send me pictures, </span>
  <em>
    <span>please</span>
  </em>
  <span>. I bet he’s even cuter than he was when he was a tiny baby.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will, I’ll let you know when my flight is and when I touch down.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Love you, bro.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Love you too.”  After hanging up he dropped his head in his hands and let out a frustrated breath. There were still a lot of questions he needed to answer here in Hawaii but he could take a few days to see his cousin. Granted, he wasn’t a fan of hers either but he could put up with her and her husband so he could see Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door to his office opened and Danny strolled in. “You alright, Babe?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” He pulled his head up and leaned back against his chair. “I have to take a trip to England for a few days.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is this some super secret SEAL mission?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth and he shook his head. “No, family. My cousin, Petunia, doesn’t know about my dad and...she has custody of her sister’s son after she and her husband died a few years ago. I would do it with a phone call but..”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But while you don’t want to actually go there you really want to see the kid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, Danny would understand. As much as they bickered the two had come to understand each other very well. “Yeah, he’s three now, I think. The last time I saw him was when he was barely a year old.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well then what are you doing here?” He walked around the desk and jokingly pushed up and out of his chair. “Go, get on a plane already. I’ll hold down the fort here with Chin and Kono.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going, I’m going.” He grabbed his keys off his desk as he moved to leave. He’d pack and buy a ticket to London once he got to the airport. Steve stopped at the door to his office. “Danny...thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The shorter man smiled. “Get outta here, Super SEAL.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>/////</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time Steve touched down in London, it was late so he instead went straight to the hotel he’d booked before getting on the plane. He’d visit Petunia in the morning since it would be a Saturday and they were all guaranteed to be home. Not that he really wanted to have a run-in with Vernon but it would be a small price to pay to see his baby cousins.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After checking into the hotel and settling into his room he decided to head down the attached restaurant. The waitress seated him at a two-person table and left him alone with a glass of water and a menu for a few minutes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well well well, Steve McGarrettt,” a woman said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The SEAL looked up and smile curved his lips. “Iliza.” He stood up to greet her. “What are you doing here?” He pulled a chair out for her before taking his seat again. “Last I heard you were working in the Middle East.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pushed her long hair behind her ear. “I was but the job I’m on led me here. I just handed my intel in and am waiting on my next assignment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You going back to DC to see your brother?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Iliza nodded. “Yeah, as long as I get the green light from the boss. What about you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Family business. My cousin Petunia lives out here and she doesn’t know about Dad. I wanted to give her the news in person.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry about your dad, Steve. If I’d known that Hesse was going to Hawaii I would have gotten there to try and intercept him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shook his head. “You couldn’t have known, your intel about his brother was solid and in the end, we got both of them off the streets. Dad...dad would have been proud of that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The waitress returned and placed A glass of water in front of Iliza. “Are you two ready to order?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no, I’m—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go on, I still owe you from our last meet up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Iliza laughed. “I think you owe me a little more than dinner for that.” She turned to the waitress. “I’ll take the broiled salmon and vegetables.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you like anything to drink?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll stick to water, thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Steve gave his order and waited for the waitress to leave. “When’s the last time you were in the states?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shrugged. “I’m due for some time off unless they give me an urgent case I might cash in some of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should come to Hawaii, give you some R &amp; R.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I’ll take you up on that offer. I wonder if I can convince Tony to take some time off from work at the same time. He needs a break from that bear of a boss of his.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They spent the rest of their meal talking and catching up. Iliza never really giving away too many details about what she did, as was the case with CIA operatives. The reason the two even knew each other was because his team had escorted her on a mission that very quickly went south. Iliza had risked her job and jail time when she told them the true nature of why they were being hunted as they had been. Her honesty with his team when she’d been given a clear no from her handlers was what made Steve trust her. Something Iliza told him he shouldn’t do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they finished eating, Steve walked her to her room. Which just so happened to be down the hall from his own. “Hey, let me know what your plans are before you take off. We should get together before one of us has to head back to our jobs.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Iliza smiled. “I’d like that. I should be here for the rest of the week though. Debrief happened today but with the state of this job it’s going to take a few days before they can even think about sending me off on my next adventure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Though she tried to hide it, he could see the exhaustion in her voice. “Hey, if you’re ever looking for a new job, my taskforce could use someone with your skills.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed. “You’re not the first one to offer me a job. Even Tony’s bosses have offered me a place with their team. I like what I do, but I do need a break so you might find me showing up on your doorstep soon, McGarrettt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know you’re always welcome, DiNozzo.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Steve smiled as she closed the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>/////</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Steve knocked on Petunia’s door at 10 am the next morning. It was early enough in the day that it wouldn’t be an intrusion. He’d never been to Petunia’s home before, he’d been to Lily’s once or twice, but coming into London was difficult and he really doesn’t like visiting her too much. Especially when her jackass of a husband was around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door is yanked open and Steve is greeted by Petunia with a very chubby toddler on her hip. He instantly recognized the pudgy child as her son Dudley. Steve’s learned that he actually does like kids, just not spoiled ones like Dudley. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Steve?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> she asked, eyes wide. “What in the world are </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He takes a deep breath through his nose to calm his nerves. “Can I come in? This is a conversation we should really have inside.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something in his face must tell her how serious he is because she steps aside and lets him in. As he follows her, he looks around hoping to see Harry somewhere. It’s the entire reason why he’d come here instead of just calling. He doesn’t see the other little boy anywhere.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia leads him into the kitchen and sets Dudley in a high chair by the table. “So, what is this surprise visit about?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wants to ask about Harry, something in his gut is screaming at him. “Petunia, where’s Harry?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hands pause over the tea kettle she’s getting ready to fill with water. “He’s with Vernon at the market.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, he’s not. For one, Steve knows Vernon would never go grocery shopping and two Petunia doesn’t quite look like she believes it. “Well, I came here for two reasons. One is to see Harry and the other is to tell you about what happened to my dad.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sets the kettle on the stove to boil and turns back to Dudley as the boy starts fussing. “What about Uncle John?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He was killed a few months ago, someone broke into our house while I was still deployed and killed him.” He doesn’t think she needs all the details.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her entire body freezes at his words before she composes herself. “I’m sorry, Steve. Uncle John...I had no idea.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, I wanted to tell you sooner but so much happened between getting home, the funeral and so many other things I just never had the chance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It looks like she’s about to say something when a loud, miserable wail sounds down the hall. Petunia’s eyes widen while Steve’s narrow into thin slits. Dudley wasn’t the one crying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Steve—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t let her answer, instead immediately standing up and heading down the hallway to where the sound came from. He’s lead back to the entranceway where a cupboard door is set underneath the stairs. Why hadn’t he noticed the lock on the door until now?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia had followed him back down the hall. Her eyes wide as she frantically tried to get him to leave. Steve only glares at her. “Give me the key.” The cool anger in his voice has her immediately complying before stepping away from him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he opens the door, it’s to find the small huddled form of Lily’s son curled up in bed, if you could even call the mattress on the floor a bed. Harry’s green eyes are filled with so much pain and fear that Steve’s heart breaks into a million little pieces. The cloth he wears, because those rags are not clothes, hang off him. The closer he looks the smaller the boy seems. For three years old, he doesn’t look that way. In the dim lighting, he can see the bruises on Harry’s frail arms where the cloth rides up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turns a murderous glare to his cousin and she immediately backs away from him. “It’s—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not what it looks like?” he snarls. “He’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>three,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Petunia, and you’re nephew. How could you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her face twists into something ugly and she straightens her spine. “You don’t understand. He was dumped on our porch, left for us to deal with. Lily was a freak and now I’m left to raise her freak of a son? I never wanted to take him! If it weren’t for the allowance we get for him I’d put him into a home!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It takes everything in him not to slap her. No matter how much he wants to. “You don’t want him? Well, I do. Pack a bag with the things I’ll need and we’ll be out of your hair in less than an hour.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her eyes widen and her mouth drops open as though she’s going to say something but after a moment she thinks better of it and jumps to do as he says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Steve takes a calming breath and crouches down so he’s level with the little boy. “Harry,” he says. “My name is Steve.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry has his arms wrapped protectively around him. It’s clear how he expects to be hit. “I sworry,” he whispers. “I had bad dweam.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s ok, I have bad dreams too.” He holds his hand out. “Harry, I knew your mommy very well, would you like to come with me away from these bad people?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s clear how much the little boy wants to take his hand but his fear keeps him rooted to the spot. “Mama fweak, I fweak, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It takes everything in him to keep from crying. “No, Harry, your Mama was very special and very smart, and your daddy was very funny. He and your mama loved each other and you so much. Do you want me to tell you about them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The little boy stares at him for a little while before finally standing up and slowly approaching Steve.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>/////</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Iliza runs a hand through her long hair. It’d been a long mission for and she was really looking forward to having a few days in London herself. Maybe she could stop in and visit her aunt and uncle. She hadn’t seen them in a long time and she’d really like to see her baby cousin. He had to be around three or four now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She places her tea cup on the table and picks up her copy of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Daily Prophet</span>
  </em>
  <span>. There’s not much going on of note. Dumbledore was mentioned a few times in regards to Hogwarts and she can’t help but roll her eyes. Yes, the man is powerful, but to her, he seems to have gotten a little too big for his breeches.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It makes her very glad that she and Tony went to a private wizarding school in Salem. Sure it was small, but it had helped the two of them become who they are. And after their mother died, it had become the safe haven they’d needed from their father.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A loud and urgent knock on her door had Iliza dropping the paper and narrowing her eyes. Her wand was in her hand the second she was up and walking towards the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No one knew she was here other than her handlers and now Steve. Iliza glances through the peephole, her frown deepening at what’s on the other side. She relaxes her wand arm and opens the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I really need your help,” Steve says. The toddler in his arms squirming slightly and blinking at her with bright green eyes. Then her eyes zeroed in on the scare on his forehead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why was Steve McGarrett holding The Boy Who Lived?</span>
