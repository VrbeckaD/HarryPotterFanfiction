  <span>Severus was in his private quarters, sitting at his desk while he graded papers. It was well after midnight when a note appeared with a soft pop and floated down to his desk. The potions master rolled his eyes as he opened the note. </span>

  <b>
    <em>“Wish you were here.”</em>
  </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It read, with a little heart at the bottom. Severus sighed. “You’re only a room away,you impertinent brat.” He called out in exasperation. Severus went back to grading papers until he heard another soft pop, making him a sigh again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>
    <em>“I’m naked.”</em>
  </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This one read, and it even included a winking face. Severus just snorted and began putting away his papers before he extinguished the light. “Bloody Potter.” He mumbled under his breath as he headed for their bedroom. </span>
