    <p>There was a loud tapping sound and I rolled over groaning. "Leave me alone mom. Just for another five minutes."</p>
<p>The tapping wouldn't stop though so I covered my head with a pillow in hopes that it would silence the annoying sound. I could still hear it though. "Mom please." I whined. Then I shot up.</p>
<p>That's right, my parent's aren't here. I'm at the burrow. My parent's are trying to figure the war out. If they accept it, I have my parent's and their memories back. If they don't, well... they won't ever remember me.</p>
<p>That thought scared me a bit. </p>
<p>Then I remembered the tapping. I got out of bed and threw the window open. A large Eagle Owl fluttered in and perched on my desk. I giggled as I grabbed some treats out of the drawer and fed it to him as I untied the letter on his leg.</p>
<p>I flipped it over and saw the Hogwarts seal on the back. My eyes widened as I read who it was addressed to.</p>
<p>"Harry! Ron!" </p>
<p>A few seconds later both boys stumbled into my room. The owl was long gone by now which just left me by an open window, staring at the boys, while holding an odd looking letter. It would be quite an image I imagine.</p>
<p>I chuckled when I saw that both boys were still in their pajamas with very messy bed hair. </p>
<p>"What is it Hermione?" Ron asked.</p>
<p>I ushered them both over and showed them the letter. "It's from Hogwarts." I whispered.</p>
<p>"From who?" they both asked.</p>
<p>"McGonagall." </p>

<p> </p>
<p>I looked at Ron and Harry and saw them staring wide-eyed at the note as well. I was extremely excited  to be going back to Hogwarts. It was a second home to me.</p>
<p>Then I felt another piece of parchment behind the first. I pulled it out and read over the top while Ron and Harry were talking about school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center"> Dear Ms. Granger, </p>
<p align="center">This is a letter for your eyes, and your eyes only. It is enchanted so that neither Harry nor Ron, or anyone else who tries to read it for that matter, can read it but you. If you speak a word of this to anyone I can be in a lot of trouble so please keep this to yourself.</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>I looked up at the boys and saw them arguing still. "Ron you love it and you know it." Harry said.</p>
<p>"Yeah but I don't want to spend another bloody year of learning there."</p>
<p>I chuckled and looked back at the parchment so I could see what the secret letter said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">Things will not be the same this year at Hogwarts and it isn't just because we lost both Dumbledore and Snape. There are going to be a few new changes. I could get in lots of trouble for saying this but seeing as you are one of my two favorite students, I decided to make an exception.</p>
<p align="center">There is to be a new Law passed at Hogwarts. Many will not like this law and you might not either. It is issued by the Minister so I have no power over any of it. If I had, I would just allow you all to do as you please with whomever you wished. I can't say much more but I do hope that you like whoever you end up with.</p>
<p align="center">Yours Sincerely,</p>
<p align="center">Minerva McGonagall</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I stared at the parchment wondering what could be so important that she decided to tell me even though it could potentially hurt her.</p>
<p>"Are you alright?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"I'm fine." I smiled. It wasn't completely faked either. I mean I did just find out I was one of her favorite students but I couldn't help but wonder who the other might be.</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">(Draco's POV)</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>I had woken up early that morning due to some nightmares of the war. It seemed that no matter what I did, I couldn't forget those horrid events. Everything that everyone went through. It hurt. And then to see the way that <em>he</em> had ruined my family by harming me, cursing my father, nearly killing my mother and I. All for his own benefit too.</p>
<p>I shook the thoughts away and continued reading a book that I had found. I felt really bad for what I did to Hermione all those years and wanted to find out why she thought Muggles were so great. So I did some research and found a library. </p>
<p>Muggles did have some of the things we did. Well actually they had most of it but it didn't consist of magic. Anyways I went to the Library and looked for a book called Romeo and Juliet. I had heard Hermione talking about how it was one of her favorites when she was in school. So I decided to check it out. Then I found it on the For Sale shelf by the door and returned the Library's version and bought it for myself.</p>
<p>I was rereading it. It honestly was a great book. I just loved everything about it.</p>
<p>"Draco!" my mother yelled. I closed the book and opened the door. I shivered because it was really cold within the house. My room was really hot which I found sort of odd. I walked downstairs and sat next to my mom at the table.</p>
<p>"Thank you for the breakfast, Honey." I said as the elf appeared with a platter in her hand. She placed it in front of me and bowed before disappearing. My mom was smiling and so was I. </p>
<p>I always hated the way that my father treated Dobby but I was too afraid to say anything. After Harry had freed him my father had gotten a new elf. Hermione was desperately looking for people to sign up for S.P.E.W. which was a way of saying she hated that we made elves work for us.</p>
<p>I had signed up and Hermione had thought it was a joke. She threw the clipboard at me and stomped away. I just stared at it on the ground before leaning down and picking it up. On the top right corner I had written: You don't have to believe me but I really do care. I don't like the way people treat house elves. You're doing the right thing. Don't stop.</p>
<p>Then I put it back down on the ground and walked away. I never knew what happened after that because I wasn't there to see it.</p>
<p>After that day though we had put clothes on our elves. My father had agreed that it was wrong to treat them that way but if Voldemort were to ever come over, we treated them that way. But once he left we would give them extra treats and goodies because we felt they deserved it. </p>
<p>"You have a letter." my mom finally said. I frowned looking at the envelope outstretched towards me. It had the Hogwarts seal on the back and I had a small feeling that I knew what it was.</p>
<p> "Who is it from?" I asked. </p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall." she stated simply.</p>
<p>I knew that it was from her, but then I wondered what it could be about. We were there for our seven years. Well technically six. Maybe we were going to go back for another year. It seemed strange that I would be invited back though considering I was one of the people who caused the war.</p>
<p>"Thank you." I mumbled as I grabbed the letter. I placed it down next to my cup and continued eating.</p>
<p>"Well aren't you going to open it?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Well I was hoping to finish eating first." </p>
<p>She nodded and allowed me to finish eating. She decided to stay as I opened the letter and I read it silently.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>"What does it say?" </p>
<p>"It says that I need to go back to Hogwarts." I replied.</p>
<p>"Let me see." </p>
<p>I felt another piece of parchment underneath and slid it out handing my mom the other letter. She read over it and her eyes widened as she continued to do so.</p>
<p>I began reading over the second letter to see what it said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center"> Dear Mr. Malfoy,</p>
<p align="center">This is a letter for your eyes, and your eyes only. It is enchanted so that neither your Mom nor Dad, or anyone else who tries to read it for that matter, can read it but you. If you speak a word of this to anyone I can be in a lot of trouble so please keep this to yourself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I looked up at my mom and saw her staring at the letter with disbelief. "I can't believe it." she whispered.</p>
<p>I chuckled silently and looked back at the parchment so that I could read what the rest of the letter said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">Things will not be the same this year at Hogwarts and it isn't just because we lost both Dumbledore and Snape. There are going to be a few new changes.

<p> </p>
<p>I reread the note a few times to see if what I was seeing was actually there. "What's that?" my mom asked.</p>
<p>"Just a piece of parchment."</p>
<p>"Then why are you staring at it like it's your lifeline?"</p>
<p>"Because McGonagall never gives and empty piece of parchment. It's just a waste."</p>
<p>"I suppose. So it appears that you are going to have to go to Hogwarts again. Just be there... on October 5th okay?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Of course mom." I smiled.</p>
<p>I walked upstairs to find something to do for the day, with the letters in mind. One question kept resurfacing though.</p>
<p>Who is McGonagall's other favorite student, and why the hell am I one of them?</p>
