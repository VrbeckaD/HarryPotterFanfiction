    <p>" Mr Graves we're heading to the pub join us!"</p><p>" Sorry I'm busy."</p><p>" Sir there's new sushi restaurant you should come with us for lunch."</p><p>" I have my own, need to finish paperwork."</p><p>"  You know Graves you never taken a vacation yet."</p><p>" Saving them for another time Picquery."</p><p>Seraphina shook her head disappointed in the director-her friend. Percival is loyal and extraordinary worker for MACUSA but he works too much. She doesn't see how the man does it without losing his mind. She's president of MACUSA for Merlin's sake! " Times are changing you know." Seraphina looked at Queenie as she was handed cup of coffee.</p><p>" No majs are getting pretty advance with technology. Mr. Graves thinks  it's making it easier for wizards to do more crimes." <em>Maybe</em>. Seraphina thought time has changed MACUSA took top priority keeping wizardry world out of No Majs sight but even she had loosen up about them. Wizards can marry No Majs now. " You know I heard there mixing magic with all that techy stuff it's that cool!" The President arched her eyebrow at the comment, what on earth could  . <em>I wonder..</em></p><p>" Goldstein."</p><p>" Y-yes Ma'am?" </p><p>" I need you to do some research for me."</p><hr/><p>" Last one." Percival mumbled finishing up last paperwork. Cases have increase recently, criminals think just because No Majs have their eyes on screens they can just break the law with ease. That didn't stop him he should be thanking them but his aurors still bug him about <em>spending time</em> outside work.  " <em>Does he do anything besides work?</em>" Percival rolled his eyes, nice book, glass of fire  whiskey Percival's day ends perfectly. <em>Like they'll every understand me. </em> Percival came home to delivery man and rather large <em>blue </em>crate at his door.</p><p>" Are you Percival Graves?"</p><p>" I am, what is this?"</p><p>" Special delivery sir sign here."</p><p>" By <strong>whom</strong>."</p><p>" Person by the name of Picquery now please sign sir."</p><p>Percival frowned taking the clipboard signing his name. <em>This better not be a joke.</em>  The delivery man set the crate in Percival's living room and said his goodbye. Waving his hand the crate became undone on it's own Percival gasped out loud in shock. A young tall man wearing but blue boxers, messy orange hair, freckles sprinkled everywhere from his face to body. <em>Sera what the fuck did you send me?!</em>  The man was like a mannequin a hyper realistic one. Percival lighty touched the man's chest surprised his body was cold yet skin felt <em>real<strong>.</strong></em>  Inspecting the body, there was a number on back of his neck. " 0224..." Lifting his hand all material from the crate floated in the air, he spotted a dark  blue envelope that had Plaisir in fancy writing. Taking deep breath Percival open the fancy envelope that contained a letter.</p><p>

</p><p>Percival stared at the letter and back at <em>Newt</em>.  Anger boiled inside him as he balled up the paper.</p><p>
  <em>I'm going to kill Seraphina!</em>
