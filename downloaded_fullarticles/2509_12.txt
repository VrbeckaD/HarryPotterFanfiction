    <p>“Teenie, look! Oh, it’s all so pretty!”</p><p>Tina placed her book down on the leather seat and looked out the truck window. After four hours of traveling, they had finally reached the new stables. It was beautiful, she had to admit. Sprawling green grass, sleek horses and ponies grazing in pastures, some of them with their ears perked as the new trailer drove down the driveway. The stables themselves were large, with red roofs and white walls, and girls with their ponies hitched outside, grooming ponies and tacking up.</p><p>“It is very nice here. I could get used to this,” Jacob said, slinging an arm around Queenie affectionately. Queenie giggled, kissing him on the cheek, and Tina had to look away. She hated being the third wheel like this. Yes, she was happy for her sister’s recent marriage, but it didn’t make sitting through the couple’s sappiness any easier.</p><p>Jacob took his arm off of Queenie and gripped the wheel. He carefully parked the trailer in the parking lot, glancing behind him to make sure the trailer was doing okay, before finally turning off the truck and unlocking the doors.</p><p>Tina was quick to get out of the truck. She took the opportunity to stretch her legs and arms. The air was filled with a familiar horse-y smell that she had grown to love, and the sun shone warm and bright. The girls all squealed when they saw the new arrival, jogging over to the trailer, eager to see the new horses.</p><p> “It’s cramped in that truck,” Tina complained. Queenie raised her eyebrows as she got out. </p><p>“Teenie, you had more room than Jacob and I combined. You had the entire back seat.”</p><p>Tina grinned, and was about to retort when she was interrupted by a couple walking towards them. The man was tall with dark hair, bright blue eyes and a sharp jawline. The woman was much smaller and more petite, with almond-color skin, dark brown curls and dark brown eyes. Both were smiling warmly.</p><p>“Welcome to Southern Orchard Riding Academy! You must be our new riding instructor, Miss Tina Goldstein,” said the man, holding out his hand for Tina to shake. He shook her hand, then Jacob’s, then Queenie’s.</p><p>“Oh, you must be Theseus! Theseus Scamander?” Queenie said cheerfully. The man smiled again, and it was then Tina noticed the small amount of freckles sprinkled across his cheeks.</p><p>“Indeed, I am. And this-“ He gestured to the woman “is Leta, my wife.” Leta smiled, bowing her head a little in greeting.</p><p>“And I assume you must be Queenie Kowalski?” Theseus asked a beaming Queenie. She nodded, then gestured to Jacob. “And this is my husband, Jacob.” </p><p>Tina glanced around nervously. A small crowd of young girls was beginning to gather around them, all of them looking eagerly at the trailer and whispering to each other. Leta reached out, touching Theseus’s arm. </p><p>“We might want to get the poor horses out, darling. They’ll be restless and in need of stretching their legs,” Leta said softly. She looked nervous suggesting it though, judging by the way her hands started to quiver. Theseus nodded, chuckling to himself.</p><p>“My apologies, ladies. I’ll allow you to get your horses out.”</p><p>The girls stopped whispering, eyes trained eagerly on the trailer to see the new horses.</p><p>Tina swallowed nervously, but walked to the back of the trailer, pulled the ramp down and the bar on Queenie’s horse. Queenie stepped inside the trailer, grabbed hold of her horse, and backed her out.</p><p>Dixie backed out quickly, eager to get out of the trailer. She froze as soon as she was out though, ears perked nervously, nostrils flared to take in the new scents.</p><p>“Oh, she’s so pretty!” someone whispered. Dixie snorted, alarmed, and began to prance nervously in place. Queenie began to stroke her arched neck, murmuring words of comfort.</p><p>Dixie was a red roan thoroughbred, with four long legs that looked like they had been dipped in white paint and a star on her forehead. She shied when a leaf skittered by, trying to get as close to Queenie as possible.</p><p>Tina glanced over to Theseus and Leta, and she noticed that Leta looked exceedingly pale, clutching to Theseus’s arm, her legs shaking ever so slightly.</p><p>Tina slowly lowered the bar on her horse’s side before walking into the trailer and backing her out.</p><p>Cira was much shorter than Dixie. She was a dappled dun mare, with a round belly and muscular legs.</p><p>Cira sniffed the air curiously, black-tipped ears swiveling, but she remained much calmer than Dixie. She lifted her head to snuff Tina’s hair affectionately. Tina rubbed Cira’s velvety nose.</p><p>“Is this the new schooling horse?” Theseus asked cheerfully, strolling up and holding his hand out for Cira to smell. Cira gave his hand a curious sniff, then stuck her head out and wiggled her lip, seeking affection. Theseus chuckled, rubbing her forehead.</p><p>“Yes. She’s pretty good with little kids,” Tina said, smiling ever so slightly at Cira’s behavior.</p><p>“Perfect! If you don’t mind, my brother will give her a test ride tomorrow to see how she is.” Tina nodded. </p><p>Suddenly, a large, bay horse galloped past, reins and stirrups flying. Dixie spooked, jumping straight into the air and almost yanking the lead rope out of Queenie’s hands.</p><p>“LOOSE HORSE!” Theseus yelled, running after the giant bay. Tina quickly thrust her lead rope at Jacob, yelling, “Hold her! Be right back!”</p><p> </p><p>Jacob caught the lead rope, but looked at Cira nervously, as if expecting her to run off too. But Cira simply looked at him with her big brown eyes, and snorted.</p><p>Theseus and Tina ran desperately after the bay, but he seemed to have no intention of slowing down any time soon. Theseus yelled at the girls to open the gate to the breaking pen so that he and Tina could herd the giant horse inside, and the girls scattered, running towards the breaking pen and flinging open the gate. The horse charged inside, and the girls slammed the gate shut. Tina and Theseus climbed over the gate and tried to calm him down. He bolted around the breaking pen, trying to find a way out, bucking and whinnying loudly. </p><p>He finally began to slow down after several minutes of this, until he stopped and hung his head. He was caked with sweat and foam and panting heavily. Tina walked up slowly, careful not to spook him. He made no move, so she carefully picked up his reins.</p><p>“You okay, buddy?” She asked softly, stroking his nose. He tried to lean on her out of exhaustion, but she pushed him back up.</p><p>“Bucky!”</p><p>Tina turned her head to see a young man jogging up to the breaking pen. He climbed over the gate, gently taking the reins from Tina. Bucky nuzzled him and the man rubbed Bucky’s forehead.</p><p>Tina took a close look at him. He had tousled hair that seemed to be a sort of reddish-brown, with hazel eyes, and more freckles than she had ever seen on a man. <br/>He was also panting, as if he had been running for a long time.</p><p>“Newt! Are you okay?” Theseus asked, jogging up to him. The man, Newt, she guessed, nodded.</p><p>“I might have a few bruises, but nothing too serious. I’ll be fine enough by tomorrow to test ride that new horse.”</p><p>Theseus shook his head in disbelief. “What happened out there? I thought you were doing pretty well with Bucky.”</p><p>“Oh, I am! He’s been so good the past week. He cantered a whole jump course nice and quiet, and he’s much better about carrying himself at the trot. I figured I could take him out on a trail today. He was doing really well until he saw a snake, and he bolted. I stayed on for a good long while, but he finally dumped me.”</p><p>Newt seemed to find the whole ordeal hilarious, because he was smiling from ear to ear. Bucky nudged Newt again, a guilty expression on his face. He chuckled, wrapping his arms around Bucky’s massive head and kissing his forehead.<br/>Theseus cleared his throat, and gestured to Tina.</p><p>“Miss Goldstein, this is my brother, Newt.” Newt turned to Tina, and his freckled cheeks turned red. He held out his hand to shake, all the while never looking her in the eye.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s lovely to meet you, Miss Goldstein. Now if you’ll excuse me, Bucky needs a bath and a chance to cool off properly.”</p><p>Newt tugged on the reins gently, and Bucky plodded along behind him, still panting. Theseus shook his head again.</p><p>“You’ll have to excuse him, Miss Goldstein. He’s a good man, he’s just not always sure how to express himself.”</p><p>Tina looked at Newt. He was carefully avoiding the judgmental looks those around him were sending his way. Bucky seemed to notice Newt’s sudden shift in mood, because he gave Newt’s cheek a big wet lick. Newt pushed his big head away with a grin, but Bucky simply settled for nibbling at his pockets for treats.</p><p>“No harm done,” Tina said softly.</p>
