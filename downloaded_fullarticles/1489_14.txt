</p><p>“<em>Stupefy!” </em>The wand trembled in her hand as the stunner left her lips, red sparks trailing over her words as they erupted from the wood clasped tightly in her fingers. To her ears, her voice sounded rough, unfamiliar. It didn’t carry the Gryffindor courage she always believed she had. As the red sparks fizzled against the shield charm, she realized she didn’t <em>feel</em> brave either.</p><p>The stunner came again, sparking from the tip of her willow wand, her words betraying her intent. She was good at charms – no – she was <em>fantastic </em>at charms. Yet, in this moment, she found herself incapable of casting nonverbal spells. She was rendered dumb by the scarlet red eyes that bore through her, the waxen skin that was just visible beneath the shadows of night, stark against the dark robes that shrouded him. And his wand, the wood light even in his pale hands as it cut through the air, spells slicing across her skin.</p><p>Her own shield came up, bursting into a bubble of protection around her, You-Know-Who’s own spell shuddering against it. He was quicker than her, firing curse after curse before her mind could form the next, let alone her tongue. And they were growing close, much too close to the room at the end of the hall.</p><p>It was why he was here; she had known it all along, and she had done little to keep him at bay. “<em>Confri-“ </em>her throat constricted in terror<em>. </em>Terror at what was to come. Terror at the idea that she was fighting alone. That the attacks of James had not only diminished, but stopped completely. That he was lying somewhere on the floor below in broken form, badly hurt…or worse. Terror at the knowledge that if she didn’t buffet You-Know-Who’s attacks, Harry would be next. Harry.</p><p>Another spell shot from the end of his wand, brilliant green, the vibrancy of it illuminating the black hallway and the fear carved into her features. A spell she didn’t need to hear to recognize. She lurched to the side, the killing curse passing her with a surge of energy that sent chills across her skin.</p><p>“<em>Expulso!” </em>Lily roared, the ferocity of the Gryffindor inside her bursting forth. She saw his shield spring to life, the distortion it caused in the air around them the only sign it was there. The wall beside him crumpled beneath the impact of her spell, a spell that was never aimed at him in the first place. The bricks that comprised the home she loved tumbled free from their places, exploded into bits and showered them each with dust. Burying him.</p><p>She stumbled backwards, her eyes remaining on the rubble only long enough to see that he was immobile, trapped beneath her destruction. In the silence created by his incapacitation, the screams of spells coming to an end, she could hear wails.</p><p>They shrieked into the night, the lungs emitting them having grown ragged. Cries coated in agony, in dread. Her heart was held tightly inside Harry’s torment, rattling against the cage he kept it in. It pounded painfully against the walls of her chest. Just a few steps more. A few steps more and they could disapparate, could escape.</p><p>Lily reached the door, forcing it inwards as she barreled through the entryway, towards her son. It slammed against the wall, the wood rattling in the frame and frightening the boy further.</p><p>“Harry, my Harry.” Her words were tight, little more than a whisper as if they themselves might free You-Know-Who. Her skin grazed against the tips of his fingers, silken beneath her own. “Mummy’s got you.”</p><p>“Foolish mudblood.” The words were drawled behind her, laced with the murder he had meant all along.</p><p>She turned on the spot, anticipating the yank behind her bellybutton, the release of tension as they were spirited away. Instead, she felt her hand slip from her son’s tightened grasp. She felt her body collide with the carpet below. Felt her lips mutter one last spell before a scream was torn from her lungs. Darkness invaded and she moved no more.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Severus heard the hum of a passing train, the rumble as it moved across the tracks just beyond his single paned – and much too thin – window. It was common, along with the blares of horns on the London streets below. The sound of a city too restless to quiet. He’d grown used to the noise, waking only enough to readjust his position and fall back into a gentle slumber.</p><p>Wakefulness came easy for him. It had for nearly four years now, although he’d only lived beside the track for three. It wasn’t the shouts of vagrants below, the sound of tires skimming along streets in need of repair. It wasn’t even the drone of the train’s horn that rang through ungodly hours of the night. It was his job that kept him awake, or rather, his foolishness.</p><p>It was the fear that his master would call. Fear that he would spend his evenings sprawled across the cold floor of headquarters. That he would be beaten and bruised for a transgression he didn’t commit. Although, these days, he supposed it was more likely the Dark Lord <em>had</em> found him out. Had discovered that Severus was working against him. A result that would end in a fate worse than death.  A torture that would leave Severus begging for a mercy that would never come. But, was there a fate worse than the one he had already assigned himself?</p><p>He had lied, he had inflicted pain on the innocent. Had ended their lives. Any retribution would be what he deserved and nothing more.</p><p>He rolled, burying both himself and his thoughts further beneath the blankets. Cloaking his despair, his guilt in the warmth of the bed. He hoped that one day he could bury this pain inside him, that the scab wouldn’t be so near the surface, so readily torn off. But, it would not be tonight, not in this place with its incessant humming despite the lack of a nearby train.</p><p>The thought made him open his eyes. It had never been a train; the sound had never been related to muggles at all. Instead, floating in the air above him was a being of mist, the pale blue of moonlight filtering through his window. It expanded, stretching before collapsing in on itself, the shape of it ever changing.</p><p>He hadn’t seen one of these in some time and even his own was hardly corporeal, little more than a burst of light. But, this one, it was strong, even if it hadn’t taken on a shape. It had been created with such undeniable happiness it formed an ache within him.</p><p>Severus fumbled for his wand, the palm of his hand feeling the small table beside him. He felt it, smooth beneath his skin, supple. He sat, the weight of the blankets sliding from his thinly clothed body as he aimed the tip of his wand.  “<em>Venia Sermo</em>.”</p><p>Blue poured from his wand, jetting across the room to meet the patronus. The magic collided, the molecules of the patronus rearranging itself into a bleary shape. A screech of torment blasted it apart, tearing at the soul of the conjuring until the happiness that had once comprised it hung in shreds.</p><p>Severus slapped his hands over his ears, trying to mask the agony coming from a voice he knew all too well. It was interspersed with infant cries, with a high-pitched cackle, then nothing. Silence fell and the magic dissipated, leaving him in pitch black once more.</p><p>He was standing, stuffing his legs into previously discard trousers before any semblance of a thought could be formed. His fingers trembled on the button and he cursed beneath his breath. Every second it took was time away from her and every part of it mattered. He pushed it through the hole finally before forcing his arms through the sleeves of his robes and his feet into a pair of heavy boots.</p><p>He ignored the laws of apparition. He had only been to Godric’s Hollow once, the designated points of travel had been long forgotten, but he found he didn’t care. There wasn’t time for a jaunt through neighborhoods, down side streets. The Dark Lord was <em>there</em>. Severus wasn’t sure he had time at all. He spun on the spot; the Potter’s address etched in his mind</p><p>It was silent, any disruption had passed long ago. The autumn air nipped at his exposed skin, carrying his long hair back behind his shoulders. From afar it seemed to be a night like any other, unextraordinary. Children had long ago been tucked beneath their covers, and he knew that the Potter boy should be the same. But, he had heard the cries, the sharp desperation that filled the spaces around Lily’s own. And, now, Severus stood on the front walk, pieces of stone, of drywall strewn about the ground at his feet, and there was nothing coming from inside.</p><p>His wand slid from his sleeve, falling into place in his palm, the wood finding the well-worn calluses they had created. His arm was held aloft, prepared as he entered through the doorway, passing over bits of splintered wood.</p><p>There was no indication of how the Potters had lived. It was buried beneath decay, chunks of furniture, walls, everything that had once occupied this space had been blown apart.</p><p>Severus’ footsteps were heavy, carrying him unwillingly through the home. He felt as though he’d fallen in a patch of quicksand, each step harder to take as a fell a little deeper into the despair that had been created here.</p><p>There, at the foot of the stairs, lay a body bathed in darkness. In shadow and dried blood. Iron. It invaded his nostrils, dredging forth experience as he knelt on the carpet, glass digging into his knees. The glasses on James’ face had been cracked and lay crooked upon his nose. His eyes stared upward through them, seeing nothing. Severus didn’t need to touch him to know that he had passed. There was no rise and fall of his chest, no movement whatsoever, and the puddle of scarlet the man laid in was too large for any person to survive.</p><p>He moved forward, his movements the only sound in a house that had been full of life only minutes ago. One that was now too empty. His hand trailed the railing as he took the stairs, feeling the cracks of spells that had run through it, the chunks that were missing entirely. He heard the breaking of debris beneath him as he stepped, destruction having reached every corner of this place.</p><p>There had been a struggle, that much was clear. The Potters had tried their best, an attempt that would never be enough against the Dark Lord. But, it was seen. Seen in the walls that had caved in on themselves, in the way James had died, wand still in hand, in the scent of smoldering wood that indicated a fire had been cast.</p><p>Lily had always had a fascination with it, the blue the danced inside the brilliant orange, the potential for destruction it held in each flame, and the ability to keep one safe, warm despite it. And it was Lily, he guessed, that he could see just ahead.</p><p>Light spilled from the doorway at the end of the hall, artificial, yellow, not that of a lumos. In its glow lay a pale arm, fingers limp. He felt himself begin to fragment. Felt the pieces of his heart, his mind, everything holding him up crack. Felt himself threaten to fall away, to mingle with the destruction beneath his feet, yet he moved forward. Step after heavy step.</p><p>At the doorway, she came fully into view, her body crumpled unnaturally, red hair tangled about her face. He wanted to fall beside her, to draw her into her arms. He had been too late. His eyes drifted still, to the cot, to the miniature body that lay still within, the vacant eyes.</p><p>The final split within him came, spreading through his legs, his spine, until he was there beside her. His vision blurred, heat growing within them before spilling down his cheeks. His arm slid beneath her neck, her head falling to one side as he pulled her close.</p><p>She was warm. How long had it truly been? The cold fingers of death had yet to close around her, to steal the heat inside of her. His grip loosened as he blinked the bleariness from his eyes. A hand snaked up her, brushing the tangle of red away from her neck as he pressed his fingers to her carotid. <em>Thump.</em> It beat beneath his fingers, feeble, but there all the same. <em>Thump.</em> It was his voice that broke this time as his lips found the shape of her name, whispered against her skin. She was alive.</p><p>His fingers slid between the bars of the cot, hoping for the same, but it seemed that only one had survived tonight. He drew his wand, a spell of protection springing forth, a ward forming along the property line. He would be back, there would be bodies to bury, but first he had to ensure she didn’t become a third. For a second time that night, he dispparated, the two of them vanishing in the cold, Halloween air.</p>
