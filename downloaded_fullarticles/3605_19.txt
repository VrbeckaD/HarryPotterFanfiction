She woke up extra early to get herself ready for her birthday party, she put on great ripped skinny jeans and a grey tank top with a green shirt over it. Then put on green converse and curled her long back hair. She walks down the stairs to greet her Aunt and uncle Narcissa Malfoy and  Lucius Malfoy. </p><p>“Good morning Aunt Cissa and uncle Lucius.” </p><p>“Good morning sweetheart” </p><p>She smiles and then start over to the table with many presents wrapped in dark green and silver, and some red ones as well. Before she could get all the way they heard a tapping on the window. Her aunt went over and opens it for the black owl to come in, she walks over and gives her a treat and takes the letter. The owl flies away, and she looks down at the letter.</p><p>To, serephine cissa Lestrange- Malfoy<br/>At Malfoy Manner </p><p>From: Igor Karkaroff Durmstrang Headmaster</p></div>
