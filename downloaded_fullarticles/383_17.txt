    <p>
  <span>Hermione shifted in her seat and adjusted the hem of her skirt before looking up again at the positively glacial glare being unrelentingly directed at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So…” she finally said, when the five minute silence began feeling too suffocating to endure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Snape’s onyx eyes glittered with cold rage as he continued to glare at her from his hospital bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had always hoped to someday manage to astonish him into silence, but somehow the experience was less thrilling than she had imagined. In her fantasies, it has always been because she’d demonstrated exceptional brilliance in Potions or DADA. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not over the fact she had saved his life—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>—by performing an incredibly archaic and illegal marriage bond.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She swallowed, her mouth feeling dry. It would probably be a sign of weakness if she conjured a glass of water.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The illegal part was the minor aspect. A fine of fifty galleons. The Ministry was hardly inclined to do more than slap the wrists of a beloved war heroine. If she was voluntarily consenting to become saddled in (un)holy matrimony with the most unpleasant professor Hogwarts had ever laid eyes on, that was a decision of her own discretion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The issues were mostly personal. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Specifically, the issues were Snape’s utter refusal to have anything to do with her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did it never occur to you,” his sonorous voice was rasping from the damage to his vocal cords and vibrating with rage, “Miss Granger—“</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mrs Snape,” she said smoothly, cutting him off. “My legal name is Hermione Snape now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His jaw hung loose for a split second before snapping audibly shut and his glare became even colder and more deathly than before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did it never occur to you,” he said again, his soft voice even more enraged, “that I would not want to be saved by you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione couldn’t help but shift slightly in the uncomfortable hospital chair. “Not—at the time,” she said in a carefully rehearsed voice. “In retrospect, I realised it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had clearly expected her to offer a defense. Given that she had not, he subsided once again into a state of cold, yet explosive-feeling rage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We have a month before consummation becomes mandatory,” she finally said, her voice only wobbling slightly. “So—at least there’s time to become acclimatised to it.”</span>
