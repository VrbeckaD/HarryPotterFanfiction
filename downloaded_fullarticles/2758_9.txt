          <div class="userstuff"><p>When Harry is promoted to <i>Head Auror</i> the secretary follows her boss  into politics and Harry naively declares he will manage without one. That lasts three days. He scurries out of the office looking haggard to deliver his own paperwork and demands that his old partner Flint, yet to be reassigned because Harry's <i>busy alright</i>, find him a new one.  He is dismayed to see Parkinson at a desk the following morning for all of the ten seconds it registers to realise that <i>his desk</i> is now clear. Another step forward. He is ready to work. With whomever it takes.</p></div>
