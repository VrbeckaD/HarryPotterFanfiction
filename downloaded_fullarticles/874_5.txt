    <p>There were three rules the inhabitants of Godric's Hollow lived by.</p><p>Firstly, any strange events that occurred were to be dismissed. These occurrences were to be swept off as simple figments of the imagination and left in the recesses of one’s mind to be forgotten about.</p><p>Secondly, one must always be inside by the time the last rays of sunlight had set and night overtook. Doors and windows were to be locked and a candle should be lit so as to keep the shadows contained to the corners.</p><p>And perhaps most important of all was to never step foot within the forest. The Forbidden Forest as it was aptly named, was a large wood that spanned around the hollow of which it was rumored lived a world not of the villagers own. The local children often held games to see who could creep the closest to the forest's edge however no soul ever entered the threshold. In the depths of winter, one could often hear the whispered stories of young men having set quest within the wood only to never to be seen again.</p><p>Harry had grown up watching the forest and its shadows for as long as he could remember. On days when his Uncle sent him to collect firewood from the fallen branches, he always felt as though someone or something was watching him. However, when he would peek over his shoulder there would be nothing there but the silent trees to meet his eyes.</p><p>He even once remembered one early morning when going to collect eggs from the hens he had found a massacre of bloodied feathers and strewn bodies. Vernon had blamed Harry for the incident and as punishment locked him in his cupboard for a week, only being allowed out to perform the daily chores his cousin Dudley refused to do.</p><p>As he had sat curled up in his cupboard with spiders as his only companions, Harry pondered over the incident as strange for although there were wild animals who prowled the perimeters at times, this was no mere work of a fox or dog. He vividly saw in the darkness how despite the bloody scene, the hen’s necks had been slit and their bellies gutted as if by knife rather than teeth. Not to mention the half smeared bloody handprint on the latch to their pen. Strange things had always happened when it concerned Harry and because of this he simply dismissed it and the occurrence soon faded from his mind, although this would only be the beginning of the signs which were to come.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Over the years as Harry grew up into a boy of knobbly knees and constantly broken glasses, the strange incidents occurred more and more.</p><p>From his hair miraculously growing back overnight after it was all but shaved off by his Aunt to somehow being able to shrink Dudley's too large clothes when he was forced to wear them.<br/>
He tended to ignore these weird events but it did not evade the attention of his relatives. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were the type of people who in no way wanted to be associated with what they termed as "freaky events". As for Dudley, well he and his gang had enough fun harassing harry whether it being name calling or their favorite pastime of "Harry Hunting".</p><p>It was during one such game of Harry hunting that Harry found he could no longer ignore the strange qualities he had. Again he remembered the incident quite well wherein he had been desperately searching for a place to hide after being cornered by the Dudley's gang in a neighbor's small barn when he found himself squished between bales of hay. The whole ordeal had been rather disorientating but not a few seconds later he heard the voices of his chasers appear only it was as if they were coming from below him. He had waited until they gave up their search before peeking out over the bales only to see he had somehow managed to get into the hayloft. Although he was safe, this feat should have been impossible alone given that there was no ladder to climb and the loft itself was positioned too high to jump to.</p><p>The notable incidents eventually also reached the eyes of the other inhabitants in town and Harry was branded a "freak" which was in no way discouraged by his relatives.</p><p>Things had just started to look bleak in his miserable existence when Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger entered his life.</p><p>~~~</p><p>It had been a cold morning, the type of cold where you huddled together with your enemy to conserve warmth. Vernon had sent him out again to collect more kindling only this time Harry decided to instead enjoy the quietness of the morning and the fragile scenery with the falling snowflakes. Harry had been alone, sitting on the fence, which bordered the town, watching the forest when he felt a presence sit themselves down next to him.</p><p>He turned to meet the freckled face of a boy with a shocking head of ginger hair. The boy did not meet his look as he instead like Harry had done, simply stared off into the forest.</p><p>Harry had briefly hesitated, wondering if the boy had come here to mock him and if he should leave when the boy suddenly spoke. 

"My Uncles were taken by the forest." The ginger boy let out a deep breath causing a foggy cloud of smoke smoke to hang in the air.</p><p>Harry hadn't known what to say. He too had lost things to the forest and maybe the boy simply wanted to commiserate with him.</p><p>"I'm sorry," he softly said and the boy gave him a brief but sad smile in response.</p><p>"it's not your fault, besides-"the ginger shifted off of the fence to angle himself towards Harry-"the faeries are the one who took them."</p><p>Harry was slightly confused. He had never heard of what a "faerie" was. "What do you mean by Faeries," he questioned the boy. As far as he knew and led himself to believe, the forest was only home to small animals and the occasional pack of wolf of deer.</p><p>The boy briefly glanced to the forest, as if looking to see if this so called faerie would jump out a them. Assessing that the two were quite alone, he seemed to relax.</p><p>"I'm Ron Weasley," he said, sticking out his hand to harry.</p><p>Harry looked at the outstretched palm and for the first time in a while, a warmth seemed to encase him despite the snow which fell around them. "I'm Harry," he said, accepting the boys hand. "Harry Potter."</p><p>The boy, Ron, grinned at his acceptance. "I've heard a lot about you, " he teasingly told him as Harry returned his hand to his pocket.</p><p>Ah. The warmth which he had previously felt dwindled. Here it was. Harry had been right all alone. If he had heard about him then Ron would probably make fun about Harry's freakishness. Harry prepared himself for the oncoming dejection he could feel. Of course, who would ever want to associate themselves with someone like him.</p><p>"I've heard a lot about you," Ron repeated but he paused as if collecting his thoughts. Shrugging he continued on. "But I don't think the rumors about you are true."</p><p>Harry could feel a sprout of hope grow. “Really,” he questioned him, "you don't believe them?”</p><p>“Truly” Ron replied. He sat back next to Harry on the fence and from there the two boys began to talk about their lives, although they were not alone for long.</p><p>~~~</p><p>“Don't you know it's not safe to be so close to the forest," a shrill voice called, interrupting the brief budding camaraderie between the two boys.</p><p>Spooked, they both quickly turned from each other expecting to get a scolding from one of the adults only to meet the chastising gaze of a girl with rather bushy hair.</p><p>She must have seen them on the fence and crossed over to reprimand them. She reminded Harry of a cat, with her hands on her hips and bushy hair standing on end like an angry feline.</p><p>"I would warn you but I'm sure you've heard the stories," She said while glaring at them when they didn't give a response.</p><p>"Harry and I were actually having a nice conversation before you butted in," Ron grumbled at her, the tips of his ears pink.</p><p>"I'm sorry I so rudely butted in," The girl huffed out as she crossed her arms over her chest. "I was just simply trying to warn you."</p><p>Harry looked at her, and in spite of her prickly exterior, he could see the glimmer of a girl who like him and Ron, found herself alone on a cold day like this.</p><p>“It’s alright,” Harry told her and despite Ron’s clear annoyance of her, he couldn't help but feel a desire of friendship coming from her.</p><p>“Would you like to join us,” he asked the girl. Her mouth opened in shock, perhaps she thought she would have been rejected. He saw her glance hesitantly at the forest but apparently that was not enough to scare her off and she joined them onto of the fence.</p><p>That day Harry gained his first real friend and not soon after the two turned into three, as Hermione Granger as she was called, joined their friendship.</p><p> </p><p>~~~</p><p> </p><p>As Harry soon came to find out, friendship with Ron and Hermione proved to be rather interesting.</p><p>Ron he learned came from a large family and was one of the youngest of all his siblings. He always bemoaned his situation but at times Harry secretly envied him for he would much rather have Ron's family than his own relatives. For Hermione's part, she lived with her parents who worked as doctors that would regularly leave to go on call to other villages and towns.</p><p>Despite the many heated arguments Ron and Hermione seemed to find themselves in, Harry found that he wouldn't have it any other way if it meant he wouldn't be alone again.</p><p>Their lives soon however became more complicated with the sudden entrance of an Albus Dumbledore to Godric's Hollow. The man had simply appeared out of the blue one day, with no rhyme or reason.</p><p>Harry liked him almost immediately. Dumbledore gave off a sort of grandfatherly aura and he seemed to genuinely care about Harry's questions about the forest and what lay outside Godric's hollow. As the years passed, Dumbledore took Harry under his wing and it was him who taught Harry all he knew on what the forest truly held. From him, Harry learned that beings called the Fae lived within forests such as the one around Godric's Hollow and that they were the cause of all the strange incidents which occurred over the years.</p><p>Harry even came to learn that the real reasons for his parent's death was due to Fae involvement and that there was soon to be more chaos as a war between the fae and humans who resisted them was brewing. There were even fae, those like Ron as Harry came to find out, who opposed hurting humans and left their world to live in the mortal one.</p><p>As Harry learned more and more about the Fae, he could not help but feel within his heart, a stirring to protect what he knew as home. As he would grow over the years, it would be this call that ultimately change the course of his fate.</p><p>~~~</p>
