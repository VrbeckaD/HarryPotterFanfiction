  <strong>31st October, 1981.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>2:30 am. </strong>
</p><p>Outside the window, it is completely dark and silent. James is asleep in his bed, when he hears a 'beep' near his pillow. Groaning he picks up the mirror and brings it near to his face.</p><p>"Seriously Si, if you don't give me apology sex when we meet next, I am going to kill you for waking me up at this hour." says James still half asleep.</p><p>Sirius looks tired, there are dark circles under his eyes, and his hair look messy like he just woke up from a nightmare.</p><p>"Sorry," Sirius says, not sounding sorry at all, "Are you Okay? And Lily and Harry? "</p><p>"Yes, we are all Okay," James rolls his eyes but answers sincerely, "I am perfectly fine except for my beauty sleep which you disturbed," he succeeds in getting a small smile from Sirius," Harry is asleep in his room, Lily is with him, I would let you talk to her but you know how annoyed she gets when I wake her up."</p><p>"The wards, protective spells…?" Sirius tries to say.</p><p>"Everything is fine, Sirius," James says softly, "Stop worrying, when was the last time did you even sleep?"</p><p>"I was sleeping, it's just, you know." he doesn't complete his sentence.</p><p>"Your birthday is coming next week, you can come to visit then?" says James in a hopeful tone.<br/> <br/> "I'll try to come tomorrow," Sirius says after a pause and with a slight grin, "I'll also check on Peter on the way."</p><p>"Excellent," says James, giving him his best smile, "Night then, I love you."</p><p>"I love you more." says Sirius with a hint of laughter in his voice.</p><p>"If you say so." says James, putting the mirror back, and trying to go back to sleep.</p><p>He never hears from Sirius again.</p></div>
