    <p>The war was over.</p><p>Harry Potter prevailed.</p><p>Draco should be upset. After all, it is what his father would have wanted him to feel. But Draco isn’t his father’s pawn anymore. The anger running through his veins conquers the sadness in his mind. He was blinded by the thought of power. The neverending daydream of being a potent wizard with more power in the tip of his pinky than most wizards. That dream was ruined when he realized that it would never happen. Harry Potter was a prophesied wizard with the magic to take down the most ruthless wizard at the time. That proved he was stronger than Draco. Instead of angering him, it gave him hope.</p><p>Hope that he would save them.</p><p>Draco knew that he messed up. He knew that he blindly followed his father’s bigoted views, no questions asked. He admired his father. Wherever Lucius went, he commanded attention and respect. Draco admired that. He wanted to be like that. To be feared, respected, and admired. It was a selfish dream, he knows that now.</p><p>The Chosen One saved his arse in his trial. It, of course, was embarrassing to him. How many times can he save me?</p><p>He is now with Blaise and Pansy in one of the Parkinson’s safe houses in America. Blaise is in hiding, avoiding his trial in hopes that he is able to escape without anyone knowing. Pansy wasn’t part of the Death Eaters or the Light, she was able to walk away without a scratch, though that doesn’t change that her mind is now in a constant state of paranoia because of the war.</p><p>“Do you honestly think they won’t find you?” Pansy asked with a roll of her eyes. She knew hiding him was ridiculously idiotic, but that’s her friend. She can’t just let him get caught with at least not helping.</p><p>“I just need to leave. Unlike others,” Blaise pauses and looks over at Draco with a slight jealous frown, “we don’t have the Savior of the Wizarding World on our side.”</p><p>Draco glares and crosses his arms, “you act like we’re friends or something. He saved me for the umpteenth time. I didn’t ask, he just does it.”</p><p>Pansy cocks her to the side and leans into the sofa again, “he’s right, Blaise. Potter just helps him. No need to be resentful.” She then turns to her blond friend and grins, “perhaps he shares your feelings, darling.”</p><p>The blond grabs a pillow and throws it at her. Pansy dodges it and laughs.</p><p>“You’re so full of it.” He huffs. “There are no feelings. Get that through your thick head.”</p><p>Blaise snorted, “Oh, come of it.”</p><p>“Shouldn’t we be focusing on helping Blaise here?”</p><p>“He isn’t wrong,” Pansy sighs and rubs the temples of her forehead with her index fingers. “You can always live in one of the safe houses in South America. I doubt they’ll go there, plus, they’re in a muggle neighborhood.”</p><p>“You want me to live among muggles?!” Blaise screeched offendedly.</p><p>“Your freedom or your magic . . . Choose.”</p><p>Blaise swallowed the lump in his throat and turned away, casting his gaze on the dark carpet. He hated this. The feeling of always having to look behind your back. To feel as though you'll never truly be safe or free. That he’ll never be able to settle down and meet someone who will want him, even with the hideous blemish on his arm.</p><p>“Hey, we’re here for you. We go down together or we don’t go down at all.” Draco whispered.</p><p>“Through thick and thin,” Pansy added softly.</p><p>That brought a sad smile to Blaise’s face but the hot tears running down his cheeks were unavoidable. “I fucked up,” He mumbled. “I should have never done it. I’m never going to be able to go home and I’m never going to see my mother again.”</p><p>Blaise isn’t one to show emotions. They all perfected the Slytherin mask from an early age. It was something that they felt was necessary. Emotions showed weakness. Something they couldn’t afford to reveal. Blaise was one who could easily cast a blank expression even though he was breaking inside. So to see him open up like this is heartbreaking, it was raw and it hurt both of his friends.</p><p>“I’m going to be on the run forever.” He whispered. “I just wish I could redo everything, fix my errors. Be a better person.”</p><p>Both Draco and Pansy stayed quiet. Draco understood him. He would sell his soul for a second chance. He would leave everything behind just for another shot. Another shot to be a better person. A chance at redemption.</p><p>Pansy’s head was spinning. She could help him. She could save him, save Draco and exchange they could save her. She took a shaky breath in and stood. Both sets of eyes followed, they called after her but she kept walking. She walked down the hall and stopped in front of her father’s private room. With a flick of her wand, the door opened. Pansy walked in, her eyes scanning the shelves of dark artifacts, things that her father collected over the years. Whether stolen or bought, they were now in his possession. He kept them in the safe house to reduce the chance of being caught with them.</p><p>Her eyes stopped at a golden box with the words “tempus fugit” embroidered over in black lettering. She knew the box wasn’t cursed. Her father befriended a Curse Breaker to come and check on all the artifacts. Pansy grabbed the box and left the room, locking the door behind her. She was now in front of her two friends who were looking at her with confused expressions.</p><p>“I think I have something that can help you,” She paused and looked over at Draco. “Both of you.”</p><p>“What are you on about?” They both asked in synchronization.</p><p>“This is something my father took from some wizards in Egypt. It . . . It allows you to go back in time. Unlike a time turner, it allows you to go back as yourself in whatever age you choose. You will also retain your previous memories and you will start another timeline, it will overwrite this one. It will change this one.” Pansy licked her lips anxiously and opened the box. Inside was a gold ring with large sapphire and a golden core surrounding the stone. She turned it over and inside the letter R was engraved. “It is said that this ring belonged to Rowena.”</p><p>The air around them was tense. Everyone’s mind was running in circles, excitement but confusion and fright running through their senses.</p><p>“You’re . . . you’re serious?” Asked Draco.</p><p>Pansy nodded, she pulled Draco’s right hand and placed the ring on his middle finger, next to his Malfoy ring. “You need to take Blaise’s hand and say the spell. Think back on the date you wish to go back to. I've tried it once when I failed an exam. I went back to change it. You’re obviously going back for a bigger reason. You must really want it or it won't work.”</p><p>Blaise finally spoke up, “what about you? You're not coming with us?”</p><p>The dark haired girl shook her head, “I can’t. One of us has to stay. What if something happens? Besides, you and Draco need it more than I do. Fix your mistakes. Align yourself with right people. Save us,” She paused and whispered the last part, “save me.”</p><p>Draco leaned over and grabbed her hand, running his thumb over her palm, “if that’s what you want.”</p><p>She nodded, “go back and save us, Draco. Be kind, be strong, but stay cunning. Save yourself, save Narcissa, save our friends, but most of all, save Potter.”</p><p>The blond’s eyes widen, “Potter?”</p><p>“He is the Chosen One. Help him. Befriend him, take his side.”</p><p>Blaise turned away, seeing Pansy vulnerable was scary. Scary because it was raw, it was real and it made his stomach churn at the idea of leaving her behind. But the idea of going back, changing his choices and saving everyone he loves was such an enthralling thought. He turned back to her and nodded.</p><p>“I’ll do everything in my power to help everyone I possibly can.”</p><p>She gave him a small smile and turned to Draco, “when you get to that timeline, show me the ring. With that, I’ll know what’s happening and I’ll help.”</p><p>They both nodded.</p><p>“Let’s plan this out more thoroughly. Make mental lists of all the events that happened, the Philosopher’s Stone, the Chamber of Secrets and everything after that. You both need to help Potter. You must be allied with the Light. And for the love of Merlin, perfect your Occlumency so the Dark Lord doesn’t find out. We’re bending time and space here, besides it’s highly illegal.” Pansy huffed, though she gave them a smile. “I’m going to miss you both.”</p><p>Blaise pulled them both in for a hug, “we’re going to miss you too.”</p><p>“I can’t believe we’re doing this,” Draco whispered.</p><p>After a few minutes, they pulled away from the embrace and smiled sadly at each other.</p><p>“You have to. You’re going to do great Draco. Don’t let Lucius poison your mind with his blood purity bullshit.” She whispered, placing a hand on his cheek and the other on his hair. She pressed a kiss on his forehead and repeated the same action on Blaise, lingering a little longer on him. “Go on, shoo.”</p><p>Draco raised his hand towards his face, the sapphire gave the illusion of a small blue fire inside the stone. The moment Pansy slipped the ring on his finger he felt a pull of magic. His senses tripled, his mind expanded and he felt invincible. He grabbed Blaise’s hand, they intertwined their fingers and chuckled, looking over at Pansy who smiled and wiped a tear from her red-rimmed eyes.</p><p>“I’m so proud of you two.” She sniffed. “The spell is tempus fugit. Which roughly translates to Time Flies. Now, did you think about what date you’re going back to?”</p><p>Blaise opened his mouth to respond but Draco cuts him off, “July 30. It’s the day before I first met Potter. It wasn’t the best of first impressions.”</p><p>To that, both Blaise and Pansy snorted.</p><p>“Alright, July 30 is fine with me. We can meet up to get our supplies. Afterward, we’ll meet up at Hogwarts and we’ll show Pansy the ring on the train.”</p><p>Pansy nodded, “yes. I’ll have knowledge about the ring by then and once I see it, I’ll know.” She paused and pulled out her wand. “I’m going to cast an illusion spell on it. Only those who you tell about the ring or the time travel will see it. To everyone else who doesn't know or find out without you personally telling them, will only see an ordinary ring. I’m also casting a second spell that will only allow you to wear the ring. Any other person who tries will have third-degree burns.” With a Latin spell and a wave of her wand, the ring glowed a bright blue color and then went back to ordinary. “Keep it on at all times. We’ll destroy it once we win the war. I don’t even want to think of someone with ill intentions getting their hands on you.”</p><p>“I will.” Draco sighed and clenched his fist. He looked over at Blaise who nodded. He turned back to Pansy, she smiled and nodded with a proud smile. He took a deep breath in. His mind going back the morning of that faithful day. He opened his eyes and locked eyes with Pansy, “tempus fugit.”</p><p>The last thing they heard was Draco and Blaise’s gasps, their hands were clasped tightly together and the last thing they saw was the darkness surrounding them as the image of Pansy disintegrated and everything went black.</p>
