          <div class="userstuff"><p>It hurts again<br/>
Down, down where I can’t look<br/>
Perhaps it’s bleeding again, perhaps not<br/>
How would I know?<br/>
That’s not why the sheets are red<br/>
Not why something wet slowly travels down my thigh<br/>
Not why it smells metallic<br/>
I’m not bleeding, no, I don’t want to be</p><p>He does<br/>
Wants me to<br/>
But I’m not, see?<br/>
The red is spilled wine, the darker spots are simply drying, clogging ink splotches<br/>
The wet is sweat,<br/>
The metallic is the potion in the brewing room downstairs</p><p>Mother<br/>
She sometimes looks at me strangely<br/>
With that look in her eyes<br/>
That sincerity in her features<br/>
That accusing, disapproving, yet curious tilt of her head<br/>
That twitch of her mouth I never know what to make of<br/>
As if she knows<br/>
Knows?<br/>
But she doesn’t, no<br/>
She simply looks at me strangely<br/>
A seldom occurrence, but a startling one nonetheless<br/>
Just as seldom, I want to tell her<br/>
But I don’t</p><p>Severus<br/>
Not a good man by any respectable standard, I’m well aware<br/>
But kind to me when it mattered the most<br/>
Silent, always judging<br/>
But reliable nonetheless<br/>
He’s always treated my wounds, after all<br/>
Even when it was four in the morning, he’d been out in a storm, and Father told him not to<br/>
He was always there<br/>
Like a looming scarecrow you don’t know how to feel about because it somehow frightens and reassures you simultaneously<br/>
Godfather<br/>
Almost Father<br/>
What if it was him?<br/>
Would it be better?<br/>
Yes, I tell myself, anyone would be better<br/>
But Severus would always heal me when I was found<br/>
Father wouldn’t<br/>
I would be dead by now, then<br/>
Not that I would mind<br/>
Not that anyone would</p><p>The others<br/>
They laugh when purebloods marry cousins, siblings<br/>
Would they laugh at this, too?<br/>
Or would they nod and go<br/>
“Serves the faggot right, does it”<br/>
They don’t understand<br/>
With their simple, childlike understanding of the world<br/>
They don’t see evil because they don’t want to<br/>
So, they see evil people instead<br/>
They don’t understand<br/>
Never will<br/>
But they don’t have to</p><p>And Potter<br/>
I see the way he looks at me<br/>
I know, always have<br/>
That the feelings we have for each other are polar opposites<br/>
Yes, he has feelings for me, only a fool would deny it<br/>
But bad feelings<br/>
Of hate, loathing, pity, aversion, abhorrence<br/>
But most of all disgust<br/>
I disgust him<br/>
With everything I do, am, represent, display<br/>
Every fibre of my body disgusts him<br/>
And I can’t even blame him for it<br/>
Because who wouldn’t hate someone like me?<br/>
Yet I want him<br/>
I sometimes imagine it’s him on top of me<br/>
It still doesn’t wake my body<br/>
But it helps, in a perverted way<br/>
One single time did it make me hard<br/>
Strong, tanned hands instead of bony, white ones<br/>
I still hate myself for that one time<br/>
But it helped, in a perverted way<br/>
Malfoy instead of boy<br/>
Potter instead of Father<br/>
Fuck you instead of please, don’t<br/>
Hate-fucking me, punishing me, and it still hurts, but at least it’s someone I want<br/>
Even though I know he, too, only would do it as punishment<br/>
I just want him<br/>
Any way I can<br/>
Screaming into my face, fucking me open, staring at me like I’m the Dark Lord<br/>
Killing me<br/>
I just want him<br/>
Him and his green eyes</p><p>Merlin, I love him<br/>
With every fibre of my being<br/>
But he would never do such a thing<br/>
Kill me, he would<br/>
But not touch me<br/>
He would never look at a man the way I do<br/>
He’s not born wrong<br/>
He’s the chosen one<br/>
Precisely my polar opposite, I know</p><p>He’s furious<br/>
It’s in his eyes, the wild, wild fury<br/>
It thrills me to know that I, filthy faggot me, makes him angrier than the Dark Lord<br/>
That I manage to rile him up like this, and no one else<br/>
He’s mad, I know<br/>
So am I<br/>
I know what he’ll do long before he even thinks the thought, long before he understands he is even capable of it<br/>
I should be scared<br/>
He usually scares me<br/>
But I feel nothing</p><p>And when the green light hits me<br/>
All I can see is the green of his eyes</p></div>
