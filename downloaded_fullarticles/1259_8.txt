    <p>Queenie couldn’t help it. Curiosity was what killed the cat, as the rhyme always seemed to go. It also was one of her faults.</p><p>Grindelwald would be okay with it, surely? Practicing on his own mental wards. He was the one who so steadfastly encouraged her to push her Legilimency as far as she could, after all. If she got into his head, just once, he wouldn’t be upset. That was if he even noticed her presence at all.</p><p>All of it was an excuse, of course. It had bothered her slightly, from the beginning, why he always had his mind closed to her. Few people ever have such skills in Occulmency that they made their mind completely quiet to her. For a time the silence in his presence after Paris was soothing. Now, the feeling of being lied to is crawling under her skin. Queenie couldn’t remember how long it had been to push the capabilities of her powers, but it had paid off. </p><p>Yesterday she had been so close, so very close before someone had called her name and startled her.</p><p>She takes a deep breath, looking as intently to the back of his head as she possibly could. Mentally focusing on his mind and thoughts harder when she feels herself hit a wall. Then, for the first time ever, she shatters herself into someone's mind. Suddenly engulfed in all that was behind the wall Grindelwald had put up. </p><p>The things she sees make her cover her mouth and struggle to keep down her lunch. It took no time at all to realize just how many lies she had been told.</p>
