    <p>It was the third time that month that Draco had spotted Harry at <em>The Felix</em>, his favorite haunt in Wizarding London.  The music was always too loud, the room too full, the air too hot.  Draco relished in it.  It was easy to disappear in the massive crowd.  </p><p>"Two shots of firewhisky," Draco shouted to the bartender over the roaring beats.  He shuffled to the tight table that Blaise had secured, and passed him a glass.</p><p>"Cheers to getting over one week," Draco started.</p><p>"And to getting under another," Blaise laughed, lifting his glass to Draco's before slinging the drink back in one go.  Slamming his glass on the hard wooden table, Blaise began to scan the crowded bar, searching for his next victim.</p><p>"That one," Blaise called, pointing his thick finger towards a fit blond wizard in the corner.  Draco smirked.</p><p>"Bet you'll have him begging for it before you even leave the bar," Draco chuckled.  He gave his friend a rough pat on the back.  "Owl me when you get home?"</p><p>"Yes, <em>Mum</em>,” Blaise snipped jokingly.  “It might not be 'til tomorrow though," he added with a wink.</p><p>Draco watched him saunter towards the smiling wizard, who was clearly oblivious to the trouble headed his way.  Blaise had a tendency to chew men up and spit them back out, ruined and desperate for more.  Draco had fallen for it more than once.</p><p>He sipped his whisky, rolling his head to relieve some of the weeks' tension.  A raid in Seville had caused Draco to ramp up his potions production, and he had spent both Monday and Tuesday grinding flobberworms into paste to meet the demand.  He could barely function when the Aurors turned up Wednesday morning to pick up the vials. </p><p>Two days later, and Draco still hadn’t caught up on sleep.  Suddenly aching for the comfort of his own bed, Draco scanned the crowd again for Blaise and his mystery blond.  He caught the bright glint of Blaise’s silver shirt near the entrance door.  Catching his eye, Draco raised his near-empty drink.  Blaise gave him a wink and a nod, before pulling the bloke’s tie securely in his hand and walking confidently out the door.</p><p>Just as Potter walked in.</p><p>Potter, with his muggle jeans and his too-large jumper, and his worn shoes.  Potter, who was a <em>bloody </em>Auror for Merlin’s sake, and could afford to dress with a little more finesse, surely.</p><p>Potter, who looked nothing like Potter at all.  </p><p>Draco rolled his eyes, annoyed by the disguise Potter had chosen for the evening.  Brown hair, much lighter and longer than his normal shade and actually tame for once.  He had <em>whomever’s hair</em> swept up into what was clearly meant to be a tight bun despite the few pieces falling out, all of which he tucked carelessly behind pointed ears.  </p><p>The bloke had a rounder face, maybe a little taller, but Draco couldn’t really tell.  Lack of glasses; lack of <em>scar.</em></p><p>Draco didn’t blame Potter for using Polyjuice Potion when he came to <em>The Felix</em>.  For one, his face was still showing up nearly every other day in the Daily Prophet, with headlines like <em>Boy Who Lived Saves Again, </em>and <em>Chosen One Searches for His Chosen One.  </em></p><p>That last one included a detailed history of Potter’s love life, circling all the way back to Cho Chang and Ginny Weasley.  He had glanced at the article, noticing that nary a wizard was mentioned in the long stream of witches that Potter had apparently bedded over the past years.  </p><p>Draco put little stock in what the Prophet published anymore.  </p><p>As it was, however, no one knew.  Potter decked himself out as a different person, probably muggle, every time he entered the building.  Draco brewed Polyjuice on almost a weekly basis for the Aurors, especially ones that were undercover, or whose faces were common enough to be recognized by their potential culprits.  He had noticed a few vials missing weeks ago, shrugging them off as a miscount. </p><p>It didn’t matter whether Draco knew about the Polyjuice or not; nor did it matter what face he deigned to hide behind in the club. Draco could spot Potter a mile away.</p><p>Polyjuice could change his face.  It could change the way his hair sat along his scalp, and the color of his eyes, and the shape of his lips.  It could change his height and the way his muscles rippled beneath his shirt.  It could change the swell of his arse, the length of his cock.  </p><p>
  <em>Not that he was thinking of his cock.</em>
</p><p>No potion could change the pieces that make them <em>them</em>, the pieces that make <em>him</em> Harry Potter.  Draco spotted it so distinctly that night.  The way he stumbled in, tucking his hands deep into his pockets.  The way his mouth clenched as if he was constantly trying to convince himself to stay instead of flee.  The way his eyes (tonight dark brown instead of his trademark green) darted around the club. </p><p>It would help him pull, though, if he would let everyone know who he was.  Vanquisher of the Dark Lord, the wizard who knew his way around a wand.  Imagine how good he’d be in bed.</p><p>
  <em>Not that Draco thought about Harry in bed.  Stripped bare and laid out on white sheets, gripping the headboard as he moaned and writhed.    </em>
</p><p>Harry never pulled, though.  It wasn’t that he couldn’t; Draco noticed every bloke that he had potioned into was fit, young, toned.</p><p>The last one had been blond, his hair in a buzz cut above blue eyes that gazed below thick eyebrows.  A dust of stubble covered his jawline.  Draco bit his lip, wondering what the beard would feel like, scratching against his thighs as Potter nibbled softly towards his—</p><p>
  <em>Not that he thought about that.</em>
</p><p>Potter usually just sat, uncomfortably perched on a barstool as he nursed his drink of the night.  Sat as the men that surrounded him danced, and kissed, and groped.  His eyes—whatever eyes he was wearing that night—would remain focused on the liquid in his glass, on the notches in the birchwood of the bar counter.  </p><p>When a wizard approached, as they inevitably did, Potter would simply wave them off, a dark blush on his cheeks as he focused back on his drink, ignoring the crowded room, ignoring the pulsing music, ignoring the blur of men.  </p><p>Draco watched curiously over his now empty tumbler, his eyes no longer heavy with sleep, as Harry ordered a Butterbeer and grabbed it with his wand hand, an old habit hard to break after being raised muggle.  </p><p>He hadn’t expected to see the short glass of brown liquid delivered with Harry’s beer.  He hadn’t expected to see the man slide off of his usual secure chair and venture cautiously to the little table where Draco stood.  His mind went blank as Potter, the Potter he knew, placed the tumbler down and watched the liquid tremble, then still, in the glass. </p><p>Draco’s brows furrowed tightly.  Of course, Potter knew it was him; Draco had been out since the war, shedding like a snake’s skin the notion of marrying a witch and producing an heir.  He wasn’t ashamed of his sexuality.  He was ashamed of other things, yes, but his propensity to shove his cock into another man’s arse, no.</p><p>He was used to the obscenities, the spats, the sneers that followed him around for the first couple of years after the war.  <em>Death Eater, Traitor, Murderer.  </em>It had made him and Blaise develop their system: always check in, always owl.  Draco knew he could defend himself and that Blaise could handle his wand as well, but it was nice to know someone had your back.  Even if it had been years since their names and pictures were splashed on the cover of the Daily Prophet.</p><p>“Can I, erm, offer you a drink?” Potter asked, his voice barely audible over the <em>thump thump thump</em> of the bass.  “I got you a whisky.”   </p><p>“Yes, I can see that.” He bit his bottom lip, stifling the ‘<em>Potter</em>’ that threatened to slip out.  He shook his head slightly.  He knew how nerve-wracking it was, walking up to a bloke at a bar.  Especially with it being the first time, or at least the first time Draco had seen.  He added in a hasty, “Thank you,” for good measure.  </p><p>“I’m James,” Harry nodded, introducing himself.  Draco laughed inwardly.  <em>Hell, Potter, couldn’t get more creative than that?</em></p><p>“Luc,” he replied. <em>Two can play at that game.  </em></p><p>Besides, he’d used the fake name before.  Sometimes it was easier.  Knowing he had a Dark Mark made others feel <em>uncomfortable.</em>  It made Draco uncomfortable too, his biggest regret center stage on his forearm.  He tugged his sleeve down unconsciously. </p><p>Harry nodded, a brief wash of surprise rolling over his borrowed features as he took a nervous sip of his beer.  </p><p>“Come here often?” Potter asked, his eyes trained on the coated top of the table they now shared.   </p><p>Draco couldn’t help it.  He released a chuckle, raising his eyebrows at the clear pick-up line.</p><p>“What are you going to ask me next, <em>James</em>,” he questioned, emphasizing the provided name, increasing the hilarity of the situation for himself.  “What my astrological sign is?”</p><p>The stranger’s plump lips widened as he laughed, another of Potter’s tell-tale signs.  No one could smile as widely, laugh as carefree, as the Boy Who Lived to apparently see another cock.  Maybe even open his mouth to one.  Maybe even his arse.</p><p><em>Merlin</em>,<em> he was thinking about that. </em> </p><p>He was also thinking about that smile, about the last time he had seen it on his face, his real face.  </p><p>Ron had been hexed with a <em>Unigrow</em>, causing him to sprout a horn right through the center of his ginger hair.  His skin had glowed purple, little sparkles glimmering like freckles all over his chest.  </p><p>When Harry brought Ron to Draco’s lab for the antidote, he had laughed like that.  Deep, loud, uninhibited. </p><p>It had taken Draco five minutes to brew the counter-potion, but a solid fifteen to stop laughing at the Weasel.  Thinking back, it may have been the roar of Potter’s own giggles that had prevented Draco from composing himself.</p><p>
  <em>Maybe this is a joke, just another one of Harry and Ron’s gaffs.  </em>
</p><p>The men settled into a silence, surrounded by the deafening noise of the club.  Draco sipped his drink, allowing the cool dark liquid to slip down his throat, as he studied the brunet.  He watched the way his hands thumped awkwardly against the glass before pushing up on the bridge of his nose.  Draco smirked; Potter’s Polyjuice persona apparently had perfect vision, but the habit of adjusting his signature glasses was still there.  Draco allowed his mind to wander, to picture what Potter’s thick black specs would look like on that round face, framing those brown eyes.  What Potter’s scar would look like, exposed on the high forehead, not hidden as usual behind his unruly dark hair.</p><p>He realized he was staring, scrutinizing the Potter/not-Potter that stood in front of him, now slightly canting his hips to the beat, rocking slowly from side to side.</p><p>He saw lips move, but couldn’t hear what they said over the screeching sounds of the Weird Sisters.  </p><p>“What?” Draco asked, leaning his head forward.</p><p>Harry shifted for a moment, before he stepped closer to Draco, his mouth now hovering on the rim of Draco’s ear.  He could feel hot breath on his skin as the man whispered.</p><p>“Want to dance?”</p><p>The voice, so close to his ear, sounded lower, rougher than the voice he knew from school.</p><p>Draco breathed in quickly, inhaling the crisp scent of soap and spice.  Was this Potter’s smell, or the bloke whose likeness he’d borrowed?  He wasn’t sure it mattered anymore.  </p><p>He had seen Potter dance, if that’s what he wanted to call it, at the Yule ball in fourth-year.  That was formal, with formal robes and formal partners and formal duties. </p><p>The club, however, on a Friday night, bodies sliding and grinding against each other—was not so formal.  His skin itched to see Potter dance in a club like this.</p><p>He withdrew, locking brown eyes (<em>they should be green) </em>with grey.  Draco observed how Harry’s pupils were dilated, his eyebrows arched, his breath quickening.  Draco nodded, once, a brisk bob of his head. </p><p>
  <em>Maybe he’s serious.  </em>
</p><p>He followed Harry out to the dance floor, maneuvering through couples rubbing against each other until they reached a gap, the tiniest space to stand.</p><p>And stand they did.  The confidence that Harry must have mustered quickly slipped away now that they were pressed close, shoved closer by the surrounding dancers.  His eyes darted frantically, and Draco could practically see his heart beating rapidly in his chest. </p><p>Draco had felt like that before.  The first time he had come to the club, the first time he had pressed up against another man on the dance floor. Another man that wasn’t Blaise, that is.  </p><p>Draco smiled, a soft smile that was so very different from his usual condescending smirk.  Placing his hands on Potter’s shoulders, he turned him around and pulled Harry’s back to fit tightly against his chest.  Draco leaned in, placing his mouth against <em>definitely not </em>Potter’s soft neck.  </p><p>“Close your eyes,” he murmured.  “Just listen to the beat.”</p><p>With perfect timing, the DJ dropped a new track, faster, stronger than the one before.  Draco put one hand on Harry’s hip and another on his shoulder.  He led Potter into a steady sway as they began to move together.  Harry began to relax, slowly bending and weaving to the music as Draco guided them into a dance. </p><p>Draco steadily rolled his hips, thrusting against Potter’s (<em>not Potter’s)</em> arse as their pace quickened with the bass that surrounded them.  He could feel Harry against him, delighted when he felt him push back, reciprocating the rapid pace, grinding into Draco as they thrummed with the beat.</p><p>He tilted his head back, releasing a groan into the hot, loud air as he felt his cock begin to swell, encouraged by the friction of jeans rubbing against his own, of hot arse rubbing against him as they continued to pulse against each other.  He wondered if Harry could feel it, could feel his hardened length pushing against that arse, could feel how much Draco was enjoying this. </p><p>Draco shifted away, taking a moment to watch Harry’s arse (<em>not his arse, though)</em>, jut back only to find open air.  He grinned before he grabbed shoulders and whipped Potter around, pulling the taut chest against his own.  </p><p>From this new angle, he could see Potter was flushed.  He could practically feel the heat rising from his cheeks, his pupils blown, his eyes hooded as he stared at Draco.  Harry licked his top lip, the crown of his forehead sweaty. </p><p>Even before Draco slipped his knee roughly between the other man’s thighs, before he felt the sure-as-hell heavy and thick sign pressed against his chest, he knew.  </p><p>
  <em>Potter wanted this.  </em>
</p><p>He wanted a man to press, to grind, to frot against him.  Harry wanted rough hands to run over his sides, brush against his chest, grip his hips.</p><p>Was it any man that Potter wanted, or his past nemesis, now occasional friend that still bore the Dark Mark?  Draco wasn’t sure, convincing himself it didn’t matter either way. </p><p>If Potter needed to hide behind a mask, needed his first club experience to be with someone that at least felt familiar, who was Draco to judge that?  It’s not as if Draco’s first experiences hadn’t been with Blaise, his best friend after the war, jostling awkwardly in dark closets, anxious to learn what the hell they were doing before trying it out in the real world.  </p><p>Besides, he wanted to know.  Draco wanted to see what it looked like when Potter came undone, whatever body he was using that night.  He wanted to know what Harry responded to, his breath panting, his back arched, goosebumps covering his skin as Draco plunged deep into him.</p><p>Polyjuice wouldn’t disguise someone’s pleasure. Someone’s <em>need</em>.</p><p>They continued to dance, thrusting their hips against each other.  They were searching for friction that kept eluding them, that wouldn’t be sated until they were naked, grinding against a wall, a table, a bed.  Draco licked his lips.  He wanted to drive into Potter against all of them, and he wanted to start now.</p><p>“Come back to mine,” Draco murmured into Potter’s ear, no longer caring whose body it was. No longer caring if it was a joke.</p><p>Draco watched brown eyes widen before Harry nodded.  </p><p>Draco grasped Harry’s hand, leading him out the front door.  Holding onto his elbow, Draco twisted them on the spot and Apparated them back to his flat.</p><p> </p>
