    <p>Harry walked into the bachelor party, Ron and Blaise right behind him. Who would ever have expected Lavender Brown to fall in love with Theodore Nott? But after dicking around for a few years Theo had finally asked her to marry him and thus, here they were, at a bachelor party that would probably make Snape turn over in his grave. </p><p>If the bastard only had the decency to be in one already, that is.</p><p>The place was filled with former Gryffindors and former Slytherins. Inter-house coziness was starting to get to even Harry, even though he'd been done with Hogwarts for almost seven years and the fifth anniversary of the end of the second war had been just last month. </p><p>Sure, he was used to socializing with Hogwarts grads and drop-outs from all the houses, but someone had seen fit to decorate the room in green and gold, a color scheme Harry found annoying. Why not red and silver if they had to do a house color thing? It looked like every single one of Theo's old Hogwarts friends were at the party, including years' worth of Slytherin Chasers and Beaters. Of course, it was Theo's bachelor party, and Harry and he were pretty much friends now, so he needed to just suck it up and get over it, but sometimes his past just… wouldn't quite leave his mind.</p><p>And he'd just broken up with yet another man who only wanted him for his name, so perhaps he was feeling a little grumpy tonight.</p><p><i>Shit. I need a drink.</i> Harry was heading for the Firewhisky when he almost tripped over his own feet: trousers tighter, mouth dry. A blonde vision of sex and beauty was standing a few yards away, facing away from Harry and talking to Theo.</p><p><i>Great giant squid!</i> Harry thought. <i>I thought I wasn't interested in women anymore!</i> But the evidence in his briefs was indisputable. Her figure-hugging miniskirt illustrated the perfection of her tight round arse. The shining sheet of her blonde hair fell halfway down her slim back like water. Her top was fitted as well, and as she tossed her hair a bit while she spoke to Theo he could see that her blouse dipped very low, and her hair had been covering a back that was creamy and looked soft, touchable. Her shoulder blades moved as Harry watched, mesmerized. She was gesturing with her arms while she spoke and all Harry could see was her flowing hair and beautiful back.</p><p>Without conscious thought Harry began to move toward her, so unaware of his surroundings that he bumped right into Dean Thomas. </p><p>"Hey, Harry!"</p><p>"Oh, sorry, Dean."</p><p>"You looking to give Theo your congratulations?"</p><p>Harry simply nodded, wanting to get away and meet that woman, whoever she was.</p><p>"Well, you might want to wait until he's done talking to Draco. I know you two still rub each other the wrong way."</p><p>Suddenly Dean had Harry's full attention. "Theo is talking with <i>Draco</i>?"</p><p>Dean smirked. "Fooled you with his drag, did he? I thought he was a woman for a while myself. Was all set to tell Lav that her man was thinking to stray, too!" Dean chuckled at his own mistake and at sharing it with Harry, but Harry was too shocked to politely share the laughter.</p><p>"Draco?" he repeated in a slightly strangled tone.</p><p>"Harry? You all right?"</p><p>But Harry wasn't looking at Dean. Draco had turned and Harry could see no one else. Perhaps he had overheard Harry's conversation with Dean. Perhaps he'd felt Harry's eyes burning holes in his skin. Whatever the reason, he was striding toward the two former Gryffindors now, and Dean slipped away into the crowd, not wanting to interfere in something that looked like it was sure to be explosive in <i>some</i> way or other.</p><p>Harry wasn't sure whether milliseconds or centuries had passed, but Draco was standing in front of him. Draco had court shoes on, and they were suddenly exactly, perfectly the same height. Draco was wearing some sort of eye makeup. Harry stared, lost.</p><p>"Harry, are you in there?" </p><p>Harry couldn't think of an answer worth his energy or Draco's time, and he stayed quiet.</p><p>"I thought you didn't do women since Ginny left you for Padma?" Draco sounded both amused and intrigued.</p><p>"But you aren't a woman, are you, Draco?" Harry reached out and took Draco's slender wrist. He picked up Draco's hand and saw with amusement that drag had not, apparently, extended all the way to the other man's fingernails. They were short and, although well-cared for, still their natural color.</p><p>Leaving his left wrist in Harry's right hand, Draco stepped closer and lightly, teasingly, pressed his entire front against Harry. </p><p>Harry couldn't believe Draco was doing this, and in front of all these old friends. He'd seemingly never inspired anything more pleasant than mild annoyance in Draco before. Where was this mutual lust coming from? But as Draco's pretty blond hair caught the light, and Draco's hardening cock pressed into his own, Harry decided that even if he hadn't actually had any Firewhisky yet, he could just pretend he was drunk and toss all caution to the winds. It would only be for one night.</p><p>"Oh… oh." Harry moaned, as quiet as he could.</p><p>Draco's voice sent fire through Harry's mind. "I want you."</p><p>Harry threw himself in head first and forgot to care about sense. He'd never seen a more beautiful man in his life. So what if it was Malfoy. <i>Fuck polite. I'll say goodbye to Theo later.</i> "I'm yours for the night. Let's get out of here."</p><p>Draco pressed himself firmly into Harry; wrapped his arms around the other man. With no other warning than that, he Apparated them into a bedroom of what Harry fervently hoped was Draco's home in Camden. He'd only been there once, and never upstairs, but he knew Draco lived alone. </p><p>Draco opened his mouth and pressed it to Harry's.</p><p>"Oh, fuck," Harry panted into Draco's open mouth. "Please, please tell me you're a top."</p><p>Draco moved his hands to Harry's arse. "I didn't know you were a bottom."</p><p>"I usually prefer it. And I need you inside me. Right. Now. So please. Tell me you top?"</p><p>"For you, love? Anything." Harry almost thought Draco meant it, too. </p><p>Draco began to remove Harry's clothing. The tie. The cotton shirt. Button after button.</p><p>"Draco, please. Fuck me before I come to my senses and remember who you are."</p><p>"Harry…" Draco chided gently. "I've wanted this for far too long to do anything other than make it last."</p><p>"You've wanted me?"</p><p>"Oh, come on, Harry. Don't tell me you didn't know?" He looked up from Harry's pecs at Harry's eyes. Harry felt he must look quite surprised. He <i>was</i> surprised. </p><p>He put a hand on Harry's shoulder and moved Harry's shirt aside to touch the other man's neck. "You didn't know I've wanted you for, well, let's just say some time?"</p><p>"I thought you couldn't stand being in the same room as me."</p><p>"Only because I never thought, never in a million years, that we would leave that room together."</p><p>Harry felt amused and annoyed at the same time. "You've been a prickly bastard for how long instead of just trying to seduce me?"</p><p>"Harry, Harry, Harry." Draco clucked and shook his head in mock dismay. "Can we talk about this later?"</p><p>"Hell, yes!" Harry reached for the buttons of his own shirt. "But I want to be naked and under you. Panting. Screaming." He gave Draco a deep, calculating look. "Now."</p><p>"I can live with those terms," Draco answered and Vanished his own clothes.</p><p>Harry pulled off his shirt, trousers and briefs, dumping them carelessly on the floor. He sat to yank off his socks, and then he climbed into the middle of the large bed.</p><p>He got his first good look at Draco as soon as he settled his back against the pillows. His mouth dropped open. </p><p>"You like?" Draco sounded amused but he looked pleased.</p><p>"Fuck yes. I may need you to take me repeatedly before I've had enough."</p><p>"Again, I believe I can live with those terms." Draco grabbed Harry's ankles and pulled him down so that he was flat on the bed. "Do you need any foreplay?"</p><p>"I had sex this morning. And how many times do I have to beg you to fuck me, anyway?" This time Harry's voice was less raw, more playful.</p><p>Draco's face took on a look of focus for a moment and then Harry felt himself go cool and slick inside. He reached for Draco with his legs and his arms at the same time, and pulled Draco close, suddenly so desperate to be filled with cock that he felt almost unable to breathe.</p><p>"Need you," Draco panted. And he positioned his cock with one hand and then shoved in, hard.</p><p>"Yesssss…." Harry hissed.</p><p>"Fucking hell, Harry, you feel perfect." Draco slammed his cock into Harry.</p><p>"Yessss…" Harry hissed again. "Yes! Hard, fuck me as hard as you can. I need it rough and fast and raw. Give me everything!" <i>Make me forget who you are!</i></p><p>They fucked for hours. Harry came on his back, his cock in his own hand. Then he climbed onto Draco and rode him and came a second time, all over Draco's abs.</p><p>Draco finally came explosively into Harry's arse while Harry came a third time, this time on his knees leaning back against Draco's chest and writhing on the other man's incredible cock.</p><p>"Fucking hell, your staying power is nothing short of magical."</p><p>"I wanted to make this worth your while." A slight blush tinged Draco's cheeks. "I wanted you to want to do this again."</p><p>"Those terms… interest me." Harry smiled and turned to Draco to look at his face. He was so content, lethargic, sleepy. He stroked Draco's cheek gently with the fingertips of his right hand. "I think we have a lot to talk about. In the morning." <i>Just not now. I can't do it now.</i></p><p>"Yes, in the morning." And with that, Draco Noxed the lights and curled around Harry's back. Harry fell asleep quickly in Draco's warm embrace.</p>
