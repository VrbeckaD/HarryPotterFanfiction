          <div class="userstuff"><p>I watch his skilled hands pour me a hot cup of tea.  His hands have cuts and burns and stains.  But I still think that they are beautiful.  He’s careful to not bump fingers when he hands me the tea cup.  Severus is methodical in everything he does.  Even something as mundane as preparing tea. </p>
<p>“Has something caught your eye?”  He asks breaking me from my trance.  I want to taste those fingers.</p>
<p>“Severus.  I would like to take you on a date.”  I state immediately.  He doesn’t even bat an eye.</p>
<p>“No.”  This isn’t the first time I’ve asked him out.  Merlin.  I ask him almost daily.  I’d think myself a nuisance if he didn’t always allow me to spend time with him alone in his rooms like this.  He really is sending mixed signals.  I’d try to give him up if he didn’t welcome me into his private rooms each day.  He rejects me each time, but then accepts me into his room for tea. </p>
<p>“Severus.  Do you have any intentions of ever accepting?”</p>
<p>“Probably not.”  He says evasively with a smirk on his face.  “At any rate.  You shouldn’t waste your time on a person of my caliber.  I’m sure there are plenty of young witches- or wizards if that’s what you prefer- that would rejoice as having a chance at the boy who lived.”  I smile at him, and even though I was rejected… again.  It’s easy to be around him.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t you like a chance at the famous boy who lived <em>twice</em>?”</p>
<p>“Of course I wouldn’t.”  I tilt my head and only smile wider.</p>
<p>“I know.  I think you are the only person who really sees who I am.”  I grasp his hand and I’m actually happy that he doesn’t pull his away.  “I would be honored if you allowed me the privilege of taking you out on a date.  You know how stubborn I am Severus.  It’s more or less how we became friends.  Please go out with me.  Just once.  If you enjoy it then I’ll try for a second and if you do not enjoy it, then I will not ask you again.”  He observes me with his cool calculating gaze. </p>
<p>“No.  I will not go on a date with you.”  I didn’t think he’d agree.</p>
<p>“That’s fine.  As long as I still get to spend time with you like this.  I’m satisfied.”  After all, isn’t that what a date is. </p></div>
