  <i>Scene fades onto a comfortable sitting room, where we find our hero and his boy toy sitting together on the couch.</i>
</p>
<p><b>Draco:</b> Potter, what's going on?<br/>
<b>Harry:</b> I think she's being lazy, but I'm not holding it against her.<br/>
<b>Draco:</b> What the hell is she doing then?<br/>
<b>Harry:</b> Sleeping, I imagine.  She <b>is</b> on holiday, you know.<br/>
<b>Draco:</b> Do I look like I care?  I want us shagging in the next chapter or so help me...<br/>
<b>Lady B:</b> What's with all the damn shouting?<br/>
<b>Draco (</b><i>angry</i><b>):</b> Why haven't you been writing?<br/>
<b>Lady B:</b> If you'd bothered to ask, I would have told you I have been writing.  It's just slow going at the moment.<br/>
<b>Draco:</b> Well what the hell is the problem?<br/>
<b>Lady B:</b> Two words: The Crabbes.<br/>
<b>Harry:</b> Huh?<br/>
<b>Lady B:</b> They won't shut up.  I mean I have poor, sick, broken-ribbed Harry climbing a fucking ledge because they keep getting closer to his hiding spot and they keep switching topics every two seconds.  Those two have the brain capacity of a flea, and I'm being generous with that description.<br/>
<b>Harry (</b><i>laughing</i><b>):</b> Gives a whole new meaning to "flea-brained".<br/>
<b>Draco (</b><i>snorting</i><b>):</b> Indeed.<br/>
<b>Lady B:</b> Did you just snort?<br/>
<b>Draco:</b> Don't be ridiculous, woman.  Malfoys do not snort.<br/>
<b>Harry:</b> You snorted.<br/>
<b>Draco:</b> I bloody well did not!<br/>
<b>Lady B:</b> Keep telling yourself that, Malfoy.</p>

  <i>Author walks away as Draco and Harry argue over the characteristics of snorting vs "delicate laughter through one's nose".</i>
