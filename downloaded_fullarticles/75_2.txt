  <strong>A/N – Hi lovely readers, I am so excited to share this story with you. This is a short chapter as it is the prologue, the next chapters are much longer. I will post more chapters this week. Happy reading!</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Additional note: I changed the rating from mature to explicit for sexual content in future chapters</strong>

</p><p>Chapter 1: The Prologue</p><p>
  <span>A guttural scream pierced the night air, stirring the creatures in the forest outside Malfoy Manor. Narcissa Malfoy was panting and desperately gripping the hand of her sister, Andromeda, her knuckles white and her face glistened with a sheen of exertion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can see the head!” Andromeda called out, propping up Narcissa’s leg, “One more push!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s here!” She cried out, “Cissy, he’s here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Andromeda had tears in her eyes; it had been almost two years since her reunion with Narcissa. When she was disowned, she had expected to never see her sisters again. It was not until Narcissa lost her first baby that the two reconnected, sharing in the pain of their loss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gently placed the newborn into his mother’s arms. He was crying and to the relief of both witches it was a strong and healthy cry. After so many losses, Narcissa was finally holding a live child in her arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh Dromeda, he’s perfect.” Her breath hitched as she gazed down into his small grey eyes, stroking his cheek softly with her finger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Draco,” Narcissa whispered, “We’ve decided on Draco.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Andromeda smiled fondly, “I see you’re following the old Black tradition of constellation names.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Narcissa looked up abruptly, “Of course, he is a Black, after all. Family is everything,” she reached out to grasp her sister’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Speaking of family, there’s another reason that I’ve asked you to be here tonight.” She squeezed Andromeda’s hand tighter, clutching Draco protectively against her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Narcissa opened the nightstand next to her and retrieved a tome wrapped in cloth. The blanket was worn, the gold stitching faded from time but still visible. The book was a Black heirloom that Andromeda recognized immediately from their family’s library. Her eyes widened in shock and she instinctively took a step back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s his birthright as a Black.” Narcissa insisted, her chin defiantly in the air, “I need you to do this with me. It must be cast with another Black. Please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cissy...you know the potential consequences of this type of magic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, I know what it did to Bella, but that won’t happen to him. Draco will find her.” She focused her attention back down to the small bundle, suckling softly on her chest, “he has to find her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We cannot tell Lucius.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They went to work quickly, spreading out the faded blanket which was adorned with golden runes. They placed candles between each rune that lined the edges.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a rune for each earthly element and left to right the runes read:</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Binding.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Unity.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Harmony.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Desire.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Destiny.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Soul.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Narcissa tenderly laid Draco in the center of the blanket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nox.” The room was enveloped with the black of night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Andromeda used her wand to light the candles that surrounded the babe and prepared the umbilical cord from Draco’s birth. She took the cord and wound it gently around his small hand, binding it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Black sisters made eye contact and Narcissa nodded once to Andromeda.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Andromeda took a deep breath and they clasped hands over Draco’s small frame. Murmuring softly, they repeated from the open book below them. The air stilled, the hairs on their arms and neck raised. The flames from the candles grew taller, shadows danced around the room; Draco fussed as each rune lit up and a bright glow encircled him. The candles extinguished and the glow faded into nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The room was dark once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A gasp broke the silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s alive.” Narcissa’s eyes filled with tears, “He has a match and she’s already been born.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Across the country, in a muggle suburb of London, a baby girl lay blissfully unaware in her crib. A soft golden glow surrounded her for just a moment before waning. On the inside of her wrist a pink mark appeared, so small it was almost imperceptible, the rune symbol for binding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Back in Wiltshire, Narcissa’s voice broke with emotion, “It is done. Now he just has to find her.”</span>
