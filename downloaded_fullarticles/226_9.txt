    <p>One fine morning, Harry found himself opening the door to see a pair of people wearing suits and asking him if his parents were home. He honestly didn't know what to say in this situation, so he just said no.</p><p>"Oh, it's okay, sweetie. Do you know when they'll be coming home?" Well. He didn't see a point in lying, and he technically told the truth, unless these people thought of cemeteries as homes for the dead.</p><p>"Uh, they aren't coming home, because they're dead." These people didn't look too surprised. Harry wondered why not.</p><p>"Well, are your guardians home?"</p><p>"Yeah, but why are you asking?"</p><p>"We would like to talk to your guardians, please. Can you tell them that we're here?"</p><p>And that was how Harry found himself being driven away from the Dursleys by the very same people a few weeks later.</p>
