  <span>It was dark. It was damp. It was colder than he had ever thought it could possibly be. The thin rag that used to be his nicest shirt was hanging over his shoulders, doing absolutely nothing in the way of warmth or comfort. The harsh, unyielding floor dug into his knees, offering no relief. Blood smeared the floor in every which way, some his, some innocents. He had lost all feeling in his hands and arms ages ago, being shackled above his head for weeks on end. He had been here for four months now, by his reckoning. Three disastrous moons without his friends, his pack. The Wolf was restless, tearing him up from the inside. Not being able to see the moon but still being forced to go through the change was the worst type of torture he could possibly imagine. It was worse than the raving hunger from not eating anything but meager scraps of raw meat for weeks on end. </span>

<p>
  <span>Before the first moon, he had refused to stop fighting. He knew his pack, his mate, was coming for him. They would never leave him here. Sirius, his light, his star, his hope, wouldn’t sleep until he was safe in his arms again. But They didn’t like that. They didn’t want a fighter. They had gone for the smallest, most sickly one for a reason. They told him that if he didn’t stop, they wouldn’t feed him until the full moon. Of course he didn’t listen. They were surely bluffing. </span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Only, They weren’t. He didn’t see food for weeks. And the morning after the moon, he woke to the mauled body of a young muggle girl lying under him, her parents not far off. He retched  when he realized he could no longer feel his hunger. </span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The same thing went on for months. Beatings when he talked. Raped when he looked at a man wrong. He ate once a month. Soon, they didn't even bother shackling him. They would drag his naked corpse-like body into their posh, velvet covered home, and leave him curled at their feet like a prized dog. Many men offered monumental sums for him when they saw how weak and pliable he was, but still had fire in his eyes. But the pocketbooks always ended up being put away, and he was dragged back to his “room” to be shackled and sleep on his knees. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He wasn't sure how much longer he would last, but he would. For his pack. For his mate. They were coming. He knew it. Sirius was coming for him. He just had to be patient. </span>
