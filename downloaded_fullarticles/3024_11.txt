    <p>Harry stood in the room of requirement, his friends sitting around the table behind him. Horcruxes. Voldemort had made Horcruxes. Dumbledore had wanted Harry to keep it secret and chase down the cursed soul containers by himself. </p><p> </p><p>"Dumbledore is dead," Harry said. The pain of it was still fresh, but they couldn't waste time mourning. "I refuse to make the same mistakes he did. I don't know what his Order plans on doing but if you're here then we'll be doing this my way, regardless of what the Order says,"</p><p> </p><p>His friends made sounds of agreement. Harry turned away from the wall of plans to face his friends. Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Fred, George, and Ginny. </p><p> </p><p>"The wisp from my first year that was possessing Quirrell managed to create a homunculus, that was then turned into the creature he is now in after the Tri-Wizard fiasco. The diary from the Heir of Slytherin mess was a Horcrux. Basilisk venom destroyed it, so we'll be using the sword of Gryffindor to destroy the others," Harry pulled the sword off the wall and dropped it on the table. "It'll also make for a good weapon against Death Eaters. We know where the Veil of Death is, and we'll use it to our advantage. I'll also try getting a few adults to side with us, but I don't think they will. We know Riddle's snake is always at his side, his locket is at the Order's Headquarters, that the Goblet is at Gringotts and that my scar is also cursed,"</p><p> </p><p>"We don't know where the diadem is," Hermione said. "But we think its somewhere at Hogwarts,"</p><p>"I'll find it," Ginny said.</p><p>"I'll look into ways to remove the Horcrux from Harry," Hermione said. </p><p>"We'll get the locket from the Order," Fred and George said. </p><p>"I can get the Goblet from Gringotts," Neville said. "I just need to do something first..."</p><p>"I'll get the kids and non-combatants to the Safehouse," Ron said. </p><p>"I'll help Ron," Luna said.</p><p>"Sounds like a plan," Harry said. "I'll keep the Death Eaters distracted,"</p><p> </p><p>Harry took the Knight Bus to a forested area, far away from Hogwarts. He knew this was probably a bad plan, but it was what he had. With Dumbledore's recent death, and finally being informed of the real circumstances of this war, there wasn't much Harry could do. He hoped his mother's protection would continue to protect him here, or else this would be insanely suicidal.</p><p> </p><p>"VOLDEMORT!" Harry yelled.</p><p> </p><p>A team of eight Apparated into the clearing around him. Harry dodged spells and stole their wands with an 'Expelliarmus'. The sword of Gryffindor was a heavyweight in his hand, as he used it to deflect spells back towards the Death Eaters. The spells that did reach him were deflected by a red shield. Harry grinned. </p><p> </p><p>He set the dead on fire and bound the unconscious ones before he called for more. Again and again, he kept calling for Voldemort. Each time a group of Death Eaters was sent instead. The teams got larger, the longer he went. Ten, Twenty, Thirty. Purple flames engulfed him as he demolished another team of Death Eaters. Harry called for the Knight Bus as the sun began setting. Carrying his captives, those who were still alive at least, on to the bus was difficult. </p><p> </p><p>"Godric's Hollow," Harry told the attendant. "Griffin's Keep,"</p><p>"Yessir," </p><p>Harry handed over twelve galleons. </p><p> </p><p>A week of Harry single handly fighting off Death Eaters changed Riddle's tactics. Riddle stopped sending teams to cause fear and chaos, instead, he increased the teams sent to respond to the Taboo. Two weeks later, and Voldemort's was beginning to notice the lack of army he had left. The Taboo was still there, but Voldemort himself had to respond. Harry impaled the snake-faced man with the sword of Gryffindor. </p><p> </p><p>Neville killed Bellatrix, dragging her corpse to Gringotts to claim Right of Conquest over her vaults. Unfourtenetly, the Goblet had already been taken out before he got there. Ginny found the diadem in the hands of Pansy Parkinson. A fight broke out in the halls of Hogwarts as Ginny chased after the teenage Death Eater. </p><p> </p><p>"Good news is we got the locket," George said, holding Slytherin's locket. "What are you going to do with it?"</p><p>"This," Harry said, holding the sword of Gryffindor. He took the locket from the twins and laid it on the ground. He brushed his hand over the blade, the poison burning away his flesh only for it to mend itself. The sword dripped venom onto the locket. It screamed like a banshee. Everyone at Griffin's Keep watched as the Horcrux was destroyed. </p><p> </p><p>"Now what do we do?" The twins asked.</p><p>"What do you want to do?" Harry asked. "The Death Eaters have two parts of Riddle's soul. They could bring him back, but it'll take them awhile. You could back out, or help me prepare for their next attempt,"</p><p>"We'll stick with you General," </p><p> </p><p>Things seemed to quiet down after that. Harry informed everyone who had sought refuge in Griffin's Keep about Voldemort's temporary death, and his likely return. Most people took the opportunity provided to pack up their families and flee. Those who didn't flee decided to join Harry's Defense Association. </p><p> </p><p>Harry kept his prisoners fed. He gave them clean clothes, and they had a locker room for showers and washroom use. They had decent beds and plenty of blankets. Harry visited them once a week to check their Dark Marks. </p><p> </p><p>"My healers say you have some pretty bad Cruciatus exposure," Harry said, sitting with Draco. </p><p>"...It's not that bad,"</p><p>"Can you flex your left hand?"</p><p>"Yes, Potter, I can," </p><p>Harry waited. The blond sneered, lifting his hand and twitching it. He frowned, forcing his fingers to move. He did so with a cry of pain as his arm spasmed. </p><p>"That's not so bad," Harry said. "I'm sure it's nothing,"</p><p>"I get your point, scarhead. It's bad,"</p><p>"I'll send Hannah down to help you,"</p><p>"...thanks,"</p><p>"No problem,"</p><p> </p><p>Harry trained. He held training sessions for his fighters, teaching them spells and how to stay alive. Hermione kept searching for a way to remove the Horcrux in his scar. Neville grew a deadly forest of magical plants around the Keep. Ron trained to defend the Keep and those stationed there from attack. Luna and Ginny trained and made sure the others remembered to eat and sleep. </p><p> </p><p>"We've got a lead on Parkinson," Susan said. "She was seen somewhere near Helga's Gardens, not sure what she's doing there though,"</p><p>"It could be the Angel's Bloom," Neville said. "It only blooms once every hundred years,"</p><p>"Right," Harry said. "Neville, Susan, Ginny, with me. The rest of you, prepare for the worst case situation,"</p><p>"yes General!"</p><p> </p><p>Helga's Garden was a garden of rare and experimental plants. It reminded Harry of the maze from the Tri-wizard tournament. </p><p>"The Angel's Bloom creates a liquid that heals any ailment, and supposedly even makes someone younger depending on how much they drink," Neville said as they walked into the garden.</p><p>"So, it could be used to bring Riddle back to life," Ginny said.</p><p>"Yeah,"</p><p> </p><p>A vine reached out and grabbed Harry. Wrapping around his mouth, and restraining his limbs. Ginny and Susan reached for him but he was pulled into the hedge before they could. </p><p> </p><p>"So you're Skull," An unknown voice said from behind him. Harry snapped the vines holding him, dropping to his feet and raising his wand at the unknown man.</p><p>"I haven't used that name in years," Harry said. He hadn't used that name since he got involved with a gang of pickpockets and gambling in primary school. 'Circus of Misfits' they called themselves. He hadn't even spoken to them since the War started up.</p><p>"I am here to request your help," the man in the iron hat said. "Those purple flames you use, those aren't magic,"</p><p>"What are they then?"</p><p>"Dying Will Flames, you're a Cloud. The Strongest, and as such, there's a responsibility you need to bare for the protection of the balance of the world,"</p><p>"I'm a bit busy at the moment," Harry said.</p><p>"Unfortunately this can't wait,"</p><p> </p><p>Harry was knocked out. He didn't even see the man in the iron hat move.</p>
