    <p>“But I want to help!” Ron Weasley said, standing up from his chair in frustration. His brother, George, winced a little at the tone but remained largely unfazed from his place at the Burrow’s kitchen table opposite him. It was only eleven o’clock. Too early for an argument, George felt.</p><p>“I know, Ron.” George smiled, through gritted teeth. They’d been going around in circles for half an hour. “And I really do appreciate it. But I think you ought to go back to school and get your NEWTs.”</p><p>“<em>You </em> didn’t get <em> your </em>NEWTs!” Ron threw his hands up in exasperation.</p><p>“Because I wanted to run a joke shop.” George said, trying to remain calm. “You don’t know what you want to do and –”</p><p>He was cut off by Ron exclaiming: “But I do know what I want to do! I want to help you run the shop, you can’t do it by yourself.”</p><p>“That’s not what you want to do, Ron!” George shouted as he flung his hands down on the table and stood up too. “That’s what Fred wanted to do and you’re not Fred! So, don’t try to be.”</p><p>The silence was palpable. It didn’t look like George could really believe he’d said the name himself. After the funeral, Fred’s name had been mentioned perhaps twice. He’d been referred to, of course, but no-one wanted to say the name. Names have power after all.</p><p>Ron’s eyes were wide. “I-” He began finally, unsure what to say, “I wasn’t trying to suggest that I was. I just want to be there for you. You’re my brother.”</p><p>George tugged at his hair then released it with a sigh. “I know. That’s what I’m trying to say. I know. And I appreciate it. But I can hire someone, I can manage. Go and get your NEWTs, and then you can come and work in the shop until you want to move on.”</p><p>“But I won’t want to move on-” Ron began, but George held up a hand to stop him.</p><p>“You will.” He said with a finality, “I know you, Ron, and no role in my shop will keep you happy forever. I’ll be much happier knowing I was responsible, sent you back to school, didn’t give mum a heart attack by you dropping out, and eventually – when you’re truly happy – you’ll know you only have me to thank.” He finished with a grin.</p><p>Ron knew he’d lost the argument. Strange, he’d always felt with only one twin he’d have a fighting chance, but both of their faces were still there in George’s. He knew in his heart that George was right, but he didn’t like his most ridiculous brother being an adult for once.</p><p>“Fine.” Ron said, “But you have to find someone to help soon or I won’t go.”</p><p>At that moment a third voice piped up. “Who needs help?”</p><p>Both George and Ron turned with surprise. There, in striped pyjamas with sticking up hair, stood their brother, Percy. They both grinned, mischievously.</p><p>Percy frowned. “I don’t like the way you’re both looking at me.”</p><p>“Percy, it’s 11 o’clock and you’re not even up yet!” George said in mock horror, “You need a job, unemployment doesn’t suit you.”</p><p>“Yes, I know,” said Percy, uncertainly, “I’ll apply for something soon, we’ve discussed this.”</p><p>“How do you feel about helping run a small business?</p>
<hr/><p>That was how, on the next Friday, Percy found himself helping stack shelves at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. He’d been under the impression from George that he would largely be handling the accounting side, and management. He’d be purchasing materials and exporting products while keeping profit margins reasonable. He was required to do all that still, while George experimented with the creation of products, but he had discovered upon arriving that morning that there were currently no other staff members, and George didn’t want to pay for any until they were up and running again. The economy was barely recovering from the war, and most of the profit the shop had made prior had gone on rebuilding post war – and it hadn’t been doing incredibly anyway. Percy suspected this was not due to lack of sales, but to lack of proper pricing strategy.</p><p>So, all jobs were for Percy and George to do. And here they were. Stacking shelves in silence. Percy didn’t like it. Even in their teenage years, when his brothers had teased him mercilessly, he’d never felt uncomfortable around them. But today he felt as awkward around George as around a new acquaintance.</p><p>“Are you doing alright, Percy?” George asked, as he started to lay out boxes of Peruvian Darkness on a table near him.</p><p>“Yes,” Percy replied, “I’m unpacking the fourth box of skivving snackboxes. There’s only one after this. Then I’m moving onto the Nosebleed Nougats. I should be done with my half just after midday if I keep going at this rate.”</p><p>George chuckled a little. Percy felt his neck getting hot as he looked over at him.</p><p>“Did I say something wrong?”</p><p>“Oh, no not at all.” George said, biting back a smile, “You’re doing a great job. But what I meant really was are you doing alright generally, you know, in life?”</p><p>“Oh.“ Percy said. That question hadn’t really been touched within the family. He certainly wouldn’t have asked George it. How could George be doing alright? How could Percy? “Not really.”</p><p>“Neither am I.” George said, not pausing in laying out boxes.</p><p>“I’m not sure I ever will be.” Percy said, cautiously, purposely focusing on the snackboxes he was stacking rather than turn to look at George.</p><p>“No. I know I never will be.” George seemed to pause. “Sometimes you say things that actually make sense, Perce.”</p><p>“Thank you, I think.” Percy replied. He wasn’t sure if he should say anything else. Saying one thing right was a bit of a record for him and he didn’t want to mess it up. He didn’t want George to get mad at him for assuming he knew how he felt about Fred, but then Percy had lost a brother too, and a brother whose last words had been addressed to him, but the words were only addressed to him because he’d turned his back on his family and failed to trust them and stand by them and that was basically the Weasley motto and he couldn’t even do that right.</p><p>“Stop overthinking.” George’s voice broke through Percy’s cloud of monologue.</p><p>“Huh?” Percy said.</p><p>“You’re doing that thing where you think too hard about what you’re going to say like it’s a test. There’s no test in a conversation. There wouldn’t be much point if I already knew what the correct answer was.”</p><p>“Well the correct answer would be saying something like: we may never get to the place we were before because we can never erase what’s happened, but we can get to somewhere else. And that place might not be the same, but that doesn’t make it a bad place, just a different one. We’re not going to get past this, it’s part of us, but that doesn’t mean we have to always be sad, just because we carry a sad thing.” Percy said this all very quickly, and breathlessly, still studiously not looking at George. He bounced on his feet a little.</p><p>“A lot must go through your mind.” Said George, “I guess that was a decent answer. Now what would your gut want you to say.”</p><p>“It’s fucking shit.” Percy said, glancing over at his brother.</p><p>George’s eyebrows shot up, and then he dissolved into giggles. “Honestly Percy,” he said in between laughs, “See, you only needed three words to nail it.” Seeing George laughing got Percy going a bit too, he clearly hadn’t messed up too badly. This caused him to stand on a flattened cardboard box which promptly slipped from beneath him and landed him in a heap on the floor, which only made George laugh harder. George’s attempt to pull his brother up just landed them both on the floor, laughing, and laughing at the fact they were laughing, and laughing at the fact they were just laughing because they were laughing and so on. Both of them stuck on the floor with laughter, just as they had been when George was seven, and had to wage revenge on his twin who had pranked him by convincing him his thumb had been bitten off by a gnome, and he’d gone to Percy for help.</p><p>They’d balanced a bucket of pumpkin juice and slime on top of a door so it would fall when Fred walked in. As soon as he had, the two of them, sat on the bed, burst into laughter the moment the bucket fell – mainly from the thrill of it going off – just as they laughed now. But this time, there was no third person, who, after a moment of shock, began to laugh too and quickly jumped on them to spread pumpkin slime over them.</p><p>Percy suddenly wondered if George was thinking of that moment. He stopped laughing. After a few more chuckles, George did too.</p><p>“I know what you’re thinking about.” George said.</p><p>“No, you don’t, you only suspect.” Percy said, as a matter of course.</p><p>“I’m clearly a Seer, I nailed it earlier.”</p><p>“That wouldn’t be a Seer, it was in the present. It would make you a legilmens which you’re not.”</p><p>“I could be.” George countered.</p><p>“But you aren’t.”</p><p>George didn’t seem to have a response for that. They both stared at the ceiling. George touched Percy’s arm gently. “You’re thinking of the time that you helped me prank Fred.” He said, simply. “He’d pranked me three times, but I couldn’t think of a way to get him back that I was actually capable of – which I was annoyed by because we were twins so I should be able to think of something too – so I went to you to help me.”</p><p>“Maybe you are a legilmens.” Percy joked without a laugh.</p><p>“I found out later that they hadn’t been Fred’s ideas after all. He got Bill and Charlie to help him – but on the second time he’d pretended to be me so they wouldn’t feel like they were taking sides.”</p><p>“Didn’t they have eyes?” Asked Percy.</p><p>“Percy, to most people we look absolutely identical.”</p><p>“But you have a mole on the right side of your neck.” Percy began to list, “And Fred has a Dragonpox scar just above his right eyebrow. And your features are just a bit wider so when you’re relaxed you look a bit more relaxed whereas Fred looks determined.” Percy could have gone on about just <em> how </em> different Fred and George had always looked when George spoke.</p><p>“And I’m missing an ear and Fred’s dead. Some more subtle differences.”</p><p>“Bugger, fuck, sorry.” Percy said, “I didn’t mean- I just don’t understand why people thought you were the same. You weren’t.”</p><p>“I know.” George said, “And you don’t have to apologise. I think though we should get off the floor and finish unboxing. Then we should get very drunk.”</p><p>“Don’t we have that party tonight to celebrate opening this place?” Percy asked, as they began getting up and dusting themselves off.</p><p>George looked him dead in the eye. “We should get very, very, drunk then.”</p>
<hr/><p>When they finished unboxing all the products, Percy declared that 2pm was far too early for drinking, but they could go to the Leaky Cauldron for lunch, just as a treat.</p><p>Diagon Alley was bustling as it had been ever since the War had ended. Most shops were only just getting up and running again, but it certainly seemed to be more about the social scene than the shopping. There was a sense of community after the event which hadn’t been there before (or, if people were truly honest with themselves, during). George locked up and cast a couple of protection spells. In the window a big sign read “WEASLEYS’ WIZARD WHEEZES: REOPENING MONDAY”.</p><p>For a while George had been toying with calling it: Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, (part of why Ron had felt so strongly another Weasley had to be on staff) but with Percy joining, he felt that would do, it seemed.</p><p>Streams of people moved back and forth. He and George joined the current in direction of the Leaky Cauldron. Percy kept catching glimpses of people he recognised, or people he thought he did before realising it couldn’t be them as they had fled the country or (worse) had died.</p><p>Percy loved the Leaky Cauldron. He liked to sit by the window and watch all the people go by in the muggle world, all unable to see him looking and think he was strange. He was just looking. He’d originally come to Diagon Alley by floo for most of his childhood, and hadn’t entered The Leaky at all. When he was about ten, though, he’d completely worn through some shoes which even his mother couldn’t fix up with magic. His dad had also needed to come to Diagon Alley, so she’d sent them both out. Instead of flooing, though, they’d taken a portkey to the middle of London because his dad wanted to try out the buses (which had, of course, ended in them getting very lost until Percy had taken over and, with the help of three bus drivers, two old ladies, and the massive bus route map, got them to the right street.)</p><p>His dad had been so excited being in the muggle world and finding the way in from it. He’d pointed out to Percy how muggles couldn’t see it, but Percy could if he tried hard enough. Percy felt special for that. Undeservedly so, he now felt.</p><p>On their return, they’d stopped for lunch here. He’d been told not to tell his mum or his siblings, as they couldn’t afford to all do it, but Tom had given them a discount and his dad had just been paid. They’d shared some chips. His dad had spoken to him, and just to him, and they’d watched the muggles and the funny things they did. One had what looked like earmuffs on attached to a box. His dad had proudly informed him that played music through eckeltricity.</p><p>Percy had once used this memory to successfully cast a patronus. He wouldn’t tell his dad that though. It would only cement his status as a disappointment.</p><p>George had headed in to a table in the centre and was just pulling out a chair when Percy said:</p><p>“Oh, erm, George,”</p><p>“Yes?” George replied, confused.</p><p>“Do you mind if we sit over by the window?” Percy gestured to an empty table.</p><p>“Of course not,” George said, face clearing, “I forgot you liked to sit over there.”</p><p>Percy was puzzled about George’s apparent observance that he was unaware of, but they got to the table and began perusing the menu with no further words.</p>
<hr/><p>Halfway through eating, George asked,</p><p>“Why do you stare out the window?”</p><p>“Huh?” Asked Percy, dragging his eyes away from a person in a bright yellow hoodie who had taken a photo which then came out the bottom of the camera. “Why do I – oh.”</p><p>George gave him a small smile, “You can just say it’s your way of saying bog off, George.”</p><p>“I thought you were a mind reader.” Percy said, remembering his food and dipping a chip in ketchup.</p><p>George fell into an impression of Trelawny, “I cannot control when the Sight takes me!” He dramatized, flailing his arms around.</p><p>“Stop being ridiculous, we’re in public.” Percy hissed, only partly in jest. George stopped immediately.</p><p>“Sorry. No-one’s paying any attention though.” It was true. Most people finished early on Fridays, so groups of colleagues had entered as they ate and it was almost packed with people, all chatting and drinking. George had even persuaded Percy to have a pint (“the meal will soak it up!”). “The way you look at the muggles is like how dad does.”</p><p>“Like I’m going to run off and join them at any given time?”</p><p>“Okay maybe you don’t quite look at them how dad does. Just the fascinated part.”</p><p>“Maybe I do.” Percy admitted, taking a swig of beer. He really didn’t like beer much. “It’s because they’re people though, not because they’re muggles. People are fascinating.”</p><p>“I guess so.” Said George with a shrug, “I don’t think I ever really look.”</p><p>“Give it a go then.” Said Percy, returning his gaze to the street outside for a couple of minutes. “See that couple?” He said finally.</p><p>George craned his neck to see where Percy was looking. “I can’t see a couple.”</p><p>“Those two blokes.” Percy said impatiently.</p><p>“Are they a couple?” George said, interestedly, looking at the backs of the two men who were looking in a shop window. “How can you tell?”</p><p>“I just can.”</p><p>“That’s not an answer.” George said, and then whined “Percyyy,” in a purposely irritating way.</p><p>“Well from many things.” Percy said. “The way they’re purposely not touching, and jump when they accidently brush hands, but they’ve brushed hands four times in the past twenty seconds so they clearly want to. When they speak, they turn to face each other more than the average person would. They keep looking around as if someone will see them, I could go on.”</p><p>“That’s weird.” George said.</p><p>“Yeah I know, it’s stupid.” Percy said, flicking back to his food immediately and trying to ignore the flush he felt coming.</p><p>“Oh, Perce I didn’t mean like that.” George said, slightly panicked, “I don’t think you’re weird. I just think it’s weird how much people give away with body language. It’s pretty cool really – and a super useful trick. You could have just worked out all the gossip – we’d never have had to invent extendable ears!”</p><p>Percy begrudgingly smiled, ignoring the fact that he knew those ear things had been invented when he’d left the family.</p><p>“So, what’s interesting about that couple?”</p><p>“Well the guy on the right clearly wants to be open about the relationship – he keeps instigating the touching – whereas the other guy is super nervous, and would rather they weren’t in public at all. He’s actually pushed away the other a couple of times. You can see though…”</p><p>Percy trailed off, because the pair had turned away from the shop window, walked the street a little, and while the nervous one had carried on walking after a brief hug, the other had turned directly to the Leaky and began walking towards it.</p><p>Both Percy and George recognised him straight away of course; it was Oliver Wood.</p><p>Oliver looked much as he ever had, Percy felt, as he strode towards the Leaky Cauldron. Tall, with a mop of brown hair that had grown out a little since no Quidditch was currently running. Percy had barely seen him in years, though he supposed it was of his own doing.</p><p>Oliver briefly locked eyes with Percy through the window and then did a double take. His face broke into at grin at seeing Percy and George and he waved. They waved back. A couple of moments later Oliver had entered the Leaky and gently pushed through the crowd to come and talk to them.</p><p>“Hello, what do we have here?” He said with a grin, though Percy couldn’t help but notice he was mainly focused on George.</p><p>“Oliver!” George exclaimed, “How are you, mate?”</p><p>“I’m alright, yeah,” Oliver responded, shrugging off the light jacket he was wearing, “How are things with you two?”</p><p>“Yeah, okay,” George said, “Just come from setting up the shop.”</p><p>Oliver nodded, “Ah yes, there’s the party tonight, yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah, bound to be awful but mum made us.” George rolled his eyes, “Are you coming?”</p><p>“Well I wasn’t too sure but now you’ve sold it so well…” Oliver joked, “Yeah I probably will, if you want me. So, have you been helping with all this, Percy?”</p><p>Percy jolted slightly at being addressed. Surprised, but pleased, he smiled at Oliver. “Yes, I’ve been roped in, rather. I’m now an employee of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes.”</p><p>Oliver didn’t attempt to conceal his surprise, as he was always an open book, his eyebrows shot up. “That’s not really what I expected.” He admitted, “Expected you to be up there getting a prestigious ministry job. Not that working at your shop isn’t highly prestigious, George.”</p><p>George gave a little salute.</p><p>“Yes, well, I wasn’t really prepared for a return to the ministry.” Percy said, lightly. “And George needed another pair of hands at the shop.”</p><p>“I suppose he did.” Oliver replied, with a grimace. Percy glanced over at George, who looked a little uncomfortable. Oliver followed his gaze. “Ah, shit.” Oliver said, never one for keeping his thoughts in his mind.</p><p>George shook his head a little, and put on a grin, “No worries, mate, honestly. I’m not made of glass.” He stood, “I’m going to the bar. Are you sticking around a bit? Want a drink?”</p><p>Oliver smiled and his shoulders went down from where they’d tensed, “Cheers, yeah, a pint please.”</p><p>“Percy?” George asked.</p><p>Percy frowned, “We really shouldn’t drink too much so early in the afternoon.”</p><p>George and Oliver exchanged a look.</p><p>“C’mon Percy, you know you want to be completely bladdered by tonight.” George said.</p><p>Percy gave in more easily than he’d have wished. “Fine,” he said, “But get me a wine or something, I can’t drink anymore of this piss.”</p><p>George laughed, and headed off. Oliver promptly took his chair and collapsed into it.</p><p>“I think you’ve gained a bit of a foul mouth since school.” Oliver said, picking a chip off George’s plate. “In fact I distinctly remember you telling me off in sixth year for saying shit too much because I was being ‘a bad influence on the younger years’ and ‘it sounds vulgar anyway’.” He put Percy’s remarks in air quotes.</p><p>A small smile crept onto Percy’s face. “Perhaps you could have better applied that excellent memory to your studies.”</p><p>Oliver chuckled, which Percy liked – he never usually made people laugh so often. That is, laugh in a nice way – with him rather than at him as his mother always said. “Glad to know you’re largely the same, Perce. Just missing the stick up your arse a bit.”</p><p>“Yes, well, you can imagine why.” Percy’s voice lacked emotion. “When you completely betray your family and only end up on the right side of the war in time for your brother to die, you realise you’re not as good as you might have thought.”</p><p>Oliver rubbed at the side of his face as if thinking of what to say but didn’t jump in with reassurances.</p><p>“Sorry.” Said Percy. “I make things uncomfortable.”</p><p>“Things are only uncomfortable if we think them so,” Oliver said, dipping a chip in some ketchup.</p><p>Percy frowned, “And I’m not looking for any pity. Whenever I mention what happened my family starts going on and on about how they forgive me.”</p><p>Oliver swallowed his chip. “I know. You’re always very frank, Percy.”</p><p>“No, I’m always very Percy.”</p><p>It was a bit of a lame joke, but it made them both smile. Percy glanced over to the bar hoping George wouldn’t be too long, for fear they’d run out of conversation. Somehow, they’d already accidentally flown far away from small talk. He couldn’t see his brother’s ginger head anywhere in the crowd though.</p><p>“I know you don’t need lectures about how you’re forgiven.” Oliver continued, “Because you know what you think, and you know what you did, and you know that you’re part of your family still.”</p><p>“Do you forgive me?”</p><p>“I don’t see what you’d need forgiveness from me for.” Oliver said, “None of it was to do with me.”</p><p>Percy shrugged. “It was a war; it was to do with all of us.”</p><p>“I suppose.” Oliver conceded, and for a brief moment the silence Percy had feared kicked in. But then Oliver started talking about the Quidditch season, and when it would resume. When George came to the table, they talked of Hogwarts and schooldays, and all about the war was unsaid.</p><p> </p>
