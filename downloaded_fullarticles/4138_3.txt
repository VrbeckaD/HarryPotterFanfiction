    <p>May<strong> 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1999</strong></p>
<p>“Oh, Harry,” Hermione sighed in exasperation as she looked at her best friend. “Couldn’t you have dressed up just a little bit?” She shot a wild-eyed look at Luna Lovegood.</p>
<p>            Luna simply smiled dreamily at Hermione, grasping Harry’s hand even tighter than before.</p>
<p>            Unlike the Boy Who Lived, Hermione and Luna were wearing formal wear in preparation for the night’s events. Hermione was wearing a periwinkle dress that was highly reminiscent of her Yule Ball gown from what felt like a lifetime ago whilst Luna wore a soft yellow dress adorned with shells she presumably had found throughout her life.</p>
<p>            “Harry, I <em>specifically</em> sent you the dress-wear I requested for tonight. I’ve spent so long planning for this. <em>Please</em>,’ she begged as she looked the wizard up and down. Harry Potter had decided the appropriate wear for the grand re-opening of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was Muggle jean shorts with an obnoxiously bright floral shirt.</p>
<p>            “But this is <em>fun, </em>Hermione. I don’t want to be miserable tonight. This is the first time I’m stepping foot in Hogwarts since that day. If I’m in a suit it’s just going to feel like I’m at a funeral. And we’ve been to a lifetime’s worth of those,” He looked at her pointedly and he sounded quite serious. More serious than Hermione had heard him in a while, as Harry had been repressing a lot of the past year by joking around.</p>
<p>            Hermione sighed in exasperation as she looked at his ridiculous outfit once more. It was the kind of sigh that let Harry knew he won this fight.</p>
<p>            “Well you’ll look completely out of pl-“ Hermione was interrupted by Ron entering Grimmauld Place—the home Harry had been renovating and residing in since the battle.</p>
<p>            “Not you too!” Hermione cried as she realized that Ron Weasley was wearing a nearly identical outfit to Harry’s. Luna began giggling at this point.</p>
<p>            “Sorry, ‘Mione,” the readhead began sheepishly, “but Harry had a point. Tonight we celebrate—no more mourning.”</p>
<p>            “I didn’t know you two were incapable of celebrating in a suit,” Hermione grumbled under her breath.</p>
<p>            “Don’t let our attire fool you, Hermione. We are still beyond proud of all the work you’ve done this year that’s led to tonight,” Harry said, laughing, but with sincerity laced in his voice. Hermione scoffed but ushered them to the floo so they could head out. Luna grabbed Harry’s hand tight, and Hermione smiled at them. Without Luna, Hermione’s not sure how Harry would have survived this past year. Harry had fallen into a bout of isolation that nobody was able to crack through. Ginny had tried but eventually realized that the love she had held for the boy just wasn’t going to fix him, and moved on.</p>
<p>            Hermione never did find out how Luna broke through the wall the young man had built up around himself, but she was certainly glad she had. Hermione had missed her best friend, and was glad to have him back even if he was more eccentric than he had ever been before.</p>
<p>            “Are you ready, Harry?” Hermione asked, her anxiety beginning to take over. Hermione, Ron, and Luna had all been back to Hogwarts since the battle. Hermione actually led the reparation team alongside Minerva. Most of the friends Hermione had made throughout her time at Hogwarts had helped in the rebuilding process, but Harry couldn’t do it. He said he wasn’t ready. Hermione had tried to beg Luna to convince Harry, but as most people know, begging Luna Lovegood to do something doesn’t usually end in success.</p>
<p>            “I’m not sure,” he said with a shrug before throwing the floo powder to the ground and shouting, “Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!”</p>
<p>            The four arrived in the Headmistress’ office and Minerva McGonagall gave them a moment to gather their bearings before rushing up to Harry in a moment of unabashed adoration for the young man. Harry’s glasses nearly fell off with the surprising force in which the older woman embraced him.</p>
<p>            “Welcome back, Harry,” she said, before straightening herself back up into headmistress mode. She shot a look at Hermione with a question in her eyes over what in merlin’s beard the two men were wearing. Hermione simply shook her head.</p>
<p>            “Harry,” a voice softly called from the other side of the room.</p>
<p>            “Albus,” Harry responded, emotion locked in his throat.</p>
<p>            “Miss. Granger has worked so hard for tonight. It is delightful you’ve come with,” he said with a twinkle in his eye. Harry nodded and looked away, unprepared to be caught up in so many memories so quickly. Hermione had prepared for this and clapped her hands together to draw attention away from the portrait on the wall. She smirked at the obviously pretend state of sleep Severus was in in his own portrait.</p>
<p>            “As professor Dumbledore said, I <em>have </em>put a lot of work in this year along with <em>many </em>others and would love for you to see the castle,” Hermione said as the group began to leave the headmistress’ room. “Hogwarts is finally ready to open it’s doors back open. I’ve arranged some time for you three to see some of the changes before the rest of the lot comes along.”</p>
<p>            “Hermione, I think I would really love to have a conversation with Helena, as she used to be one of my closest friends during my time here—before meeting you all, of course,” Luna informed them. She pecked Harry on the cheek and skipped away to go find The Grey Lady. Hermione glanced at her friend and noticed the way he shoved his hands straight into his pocket as soon his emotional crutch was out of sight, an old nervous habit he still hadn’t gotten rid of.</p>
<p>            Despite the departure of Luna, Hermione was inwardly happy that she would have some alone time with her two dearest friends. The three of them hadn’t been alone in quite some time, especially since Ron and Hermione’s amicable end.</p>
<p>           Much of Hogwarts had been destroyed in the battle that took place one year ago, but anyone who came to the castle tonight would find it hard to recall the shambles the school had been left in as the castle looked better than it had before the final battle even took place. The Golden Trio was quiet on their walk down to the Quidditch Pitch. With the destruction of the field by Death Eaters, Ron, in one of his moments of brilliance, had proposed that they completely renovate it. All three members of the trio had received more money from the ministry than they knew what to do with after the war and both Ron and Harry had thrown some money Hermione’s way for the new stadium’s construction.</p>
<p>            “And this is Potter-Black field,” Hermione informed her friends as they approached the new Quidditch Pitch-- her hands wringing with nervousness. She hoped she had gotten this right. Harry eyes widened in shock and then looked happier than she had seen him in too long of a time. He ran up to the large golden sign that graced the entrance to the field and read out loud:</p>
<p align="center">
  <strong>Potter-Black Field</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>This field stands in memorial of James Charlus Potter and Sirius Orion Black</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Who each embodied the best qualities a Quidditch Player should hold-</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Bravery, Comraderie, and Souls that Sought Fun through even the Darkest Times. </em>
</p>
<p>            As Harry finished reading it he sprinted at Hermione and nearly suffocated her in a hug. Within his arms she gasped out “and we bought the best equipment we could as well as a set of Nimbus 3001’s for students on any team that come from families who don’t have the funds for a nicer broom.”</p>
<p>            Ron joined the embrace at this point, slowly suffocating their friend. “You’re bloody amazing, Hermione Granger, you know that?” Ron shouted. Hermione tried wiggling her way out of the embrace but found no luck and was stuck in there for what felt like an eternity. Finally she squeaked out how they needed to make it to the Great Hall, as the guests would be arriving. They let her go so they could actually <em>look</em> at the field quickly. A match amongst friends was planned by the time they sauntered back to Hermione, awaiting the return to the castle.</p>
<p>            Hermione was overjoyed to see Harry look so genuinely happy in that moment but began to worry about how he was going to handle being in the spotlight in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>            “Your lip is going to burst open one of these days if you keep gnawing on it like that,” Harry told his friend, as he wrapped an arm around her shoulder. “I’ll be okay Hermione—Now that I’m dating the editor of Britain’s <em>favorite</em> newspaper-” Hermione rolled her eyes, “the pap’s aren’t so scary.”</p>
<p>            “’Mione, you reckon we should keep these buttoned up all the way or go down a few?” Ron asked, playing with the buttons of his outrageous shirt. For the first time that night Hermione finally burst out with laughter.</p>
<p>            “You <em>arseholes!” </em>she yelled at them. It was as if the years of trauma the three young adults had endured were wiped away in that moment. For the first time in quite a while Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and Harry Potter were able to joke around without a care in the world. They were still laughing as they made their way back to the castle to meet the guests for the night’s ceremonies.</p>
<p>            ----</p>
<p>            “I am proud to announce that Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is fit to open its doors to eager young witches and wizards once more. It has been a long year. One of hardship and mourning on top of moments of beauty and rebuilding,” Kingsley Shacklebot’s deep booming voice told the attendee’s in the Great Hall, “We are all able to stand in this beautiful castle once more thanks to the help of every individual who put time, money, and magic into the rebuilding effort, lead by the brilliant Hermione Granger of the Department of Magical Education. She has poured everything she has into this project and the ministry is incredibly lucky to have her in our ranks.”<br/>             Hermione blushed bright red as the room began to clap for her, but sat up a little taller. From the time she was a young child, Hermione loved nothing more than praise by those she respected and that wouldn’t change just because she was a war hero.</p>
<p>            “We are not here tonight to weep over those we lost last year. We’ve all done enough of that. Tonight we celebrate the freedom we have gained through the death of Tom Riddle, a sick man who was nothing more than that,” Kingsley clapped his hands and a glass appeared in front of every person in attendance. “To new beginnings, to those we lost, and for those we still have,” his eyes shot kindly to the trio as he took a sip. Everyone followed suit and Hermione was stunned to see Harry down the entire goblet of alcohol in one go. He set it down and watched it refill and downed it once more.</p>
<p>            Hermione sighed but let Harry do what he wanted—this would be Luna’s problem.</p>
<p>            As the night progressed, Hermione was caught in many conversations from friends, politicians and journalists. Mrs. Weasley wept in the young girls arm thanking her for the portrait of Fred Weasley that now hung in the memorial courtyard walkway. Hermione had portraits made of each victim from the battle last year and to no one’s surprise Fred’s tended to jest anyone who walked by and the Weasley Matriarch informed Hermione that she cried the moment Fred commented that her hair was looking greyer than ever before.</p>
<p>            As the night wore on, Hermione’s chest began to ache with worry for Harry. His duel tendencies of getting feisty with reporters on top of his current problem of drinking too much in times of duress created a stress in Hermione that gnawed at her to go find her best friend. However, every time she started her search another ministry employee would corner her into a conversation.</p>
<p>            “It’s really a shame you didn’t stay in our department-“ was the intro to most of these conversations. Hermione was offered a position in nearly every department in the ministry after the war. She had spent some time interning at different departments that tickled her fancy the most and truly had the choice to start her career just about anywhere she wanted. At this moment it was Davey Gudgeon, a member of the Department of Mysteries.</p>
<p>            “I’m stunned you didn’t want to stay in our department,” he told her, with that unusual tone all the Unspeakables had. The one where you couldn’t really tell what emotion it was they were trying to convey. Davey was kind enough, and had been presumably excited about the prospect of Hermione joining the team. “You’re bright and quick on your feet and we could have really used a young mind like yours amongst us.”</p>
<p>            “The prospect of the department was enthralling,” Hermione admitted, “but my passion has always been school and I could really see the difference I could make within Magical Education. Everything within the department of Mysteries is well, a mystery,” Davey laughed in a way that was just loud enough to be awkward, “I couldn’t see where my role would be.”</p>
<p>            Davey looked uncomfortable and a little bit sweaty. Hermione had become accustomed to this sort of behavior, though, and just smiled kindly at him before bidding him a goodnight. Before she could get away he grabbed her arm and had a look of wild determination in his eyes. Hermione was unaccustomed to seeing such an intense emotion written on the face of a Department of Mysteries worker.</p>
<p>            “Well, if you need a favor from the department you let <em>me know,” </em>Davey was unblinking and Hermione was in a state of surprise, “I mean it, Hermione.”</p>
<p>            “Have a good night Mr. Gudgeon.”</p>
<p>            Hermione walked away quickly, a little dazed by the odd turn the conversation took but still intent on finding Harry to ensure he hadn’t drunken himself into oblivion <em>again.</em> He wasn’t with Ron as the redhead was sitting with Lavender Brown. Hermione made a mental note to ask Ginny if they were an item again. <em>Not that it matters </em>Hermione reminded herself. In Fact, Hermione would be quite proud of Ron if he were pursuing a relationship with Lavender. She had sustained tremendous injury after the battle. Fenrir Greyback had nearly mauled her and she was found bleeding after the battle. Her face was severely scarred and had similar side effects of lycanthropy that Bill Weasley sustained after his run in with the monster. Even with all the magic in the world, Lavender still needed a cane to help stand and walk at the young age of 19.</p>
<p>            Shaking her head of Ron’s dating life, Hermione looked amongst the crowd for the bright hair of Luna, which she found, but no sight of her best friend. Luna was sitting with her father having an intense discussion on the potential endangerment of Bowtruckles, and the possibility of a cover story on the matter.</p>
<p>            “Luna, where is Harry?”</p>
<p>            “He told me he needed some time alone and I could sense that his head was all fuzzy.”</p>
<p><em>Yes, because he’s drunk! </em>Hermione counted to five in her head.</p>
<p>            “Luna, do you think you could tell me where you <em>think </em>he is?”</p>
<p>            “I think he’s in a confused place right now.”</p>
<p>            <em>One. Two. Three. Four. Five.</em></p>
<p>            “But I know that he’s gone off to the old DA room,” she told the frustrated witch. “And I know that he needs to talk to you, Hermione.”</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>            The Room of Requirement had been destroyed by the fire, and sure enough Hermione found Harry simply sitting slumped looking at the scorched wall—one of the few walls in the building they were unable to fix. A permanent scar for the castle made by magic too dark to revert. Harry was rubbing his own scar and threw his head back, hitting the wall hard enough to make Hermione cringe. Hermione hadn’t seen Harry this drunk in a few months. Since dating Luna the drinking had diminished immensely and seeing her best friend like this reminded Hermione of the first months after the battle, and the depression Harry fell into. He couldn’t stop blaming himself for all of the deaths. He found Sirius’ secret stash of aged fire-whiskey in Grimmauld Place far too quickly for his own good.</p>
<p>            “When will it stop Hermione?” Harry cried.</p>
<p>“When will what stop?”</p>
<p>Harry shuddered. “The voices, Hermione.”</p>
<p>            Panic seized Hermione’s heart and she sank down next to her oldest friend. “Voices, Harry? That can’t be right. He’s dead. We killed him.”</p>
<p>            “Not his voice. The <em>whispers</em>.”</p>
<p>            Harry looked up at Hermione with a wild look in his bright green eyes and Hermione felt genuinely frightened for the first time in a year.</p>
<p>            “I know you didn’t hear them because you weren’t there, but the veil spoke to me ‘Mione. Luna heard it too, back in fifth year when we lost Sirius. I don’t know why but every night I hear them while I sleep. I can never remember what they’re saying. Or maybe I just don’t hear them properly. But I have to go back ‘Mione. I have to hear what they’re saying,” He looked at her desperately. “That’s why I wanted you to take that Department of Mysteries job so bad. I need to get in there.”</p>
<p>            Hermione bit her lip, recalling how unenthused Harry had been when she announced that she took a position within the department of Magical Education.</p>
<p>            “What if it’s Sirius? What if he’s trying to talk to me?”</p>
<p>            Hermione sighed. Harry never got the closure he needed with Sirius.</p>
<p>            “Harry we’ve talked about his. Sirius is dead,” her voice broke on the last word.</p>
<p>            Harry set his head on Hermione’s shoulder and Hermione could feel wetness fall down her arm. <em>Merlin he’s drank too much</em> Hermione thought. She hadn’t seen Harry cry since Remus and Tonks’ funeral.</p>
<p>            “I know he’s dead,” he said softly, “but I need this. Isn’t there any perk to saving the world? Can’t I just go see this damn veil one more time? I’ve been able to revisit the spots everyone else has died. But not Sirius’. We didn’t even have a body to bury,” his voice was cracking.</p>
<p>
  <em>Well, if you need a favor from the department you let me know </em>
</p>
<p>Hermione heard Davey’s words echo throughout her mind. The timeliness of them was somewhat startling and she was a little questionable about Davey Gudgeon’s intentions but she knew she had to do this. If only for Harry to be able to settle back into a life of normalcy.</p>
