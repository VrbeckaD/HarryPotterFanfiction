</p><p>Notice: Story has been re-written, this is AU and also what I wish would have happened. Credit to writing the books goes to JK Rowling. I just write in the amazing world she created.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The sad sun parted above Diagon Alley like it could barely hold the speechless clouds at bay. Along the sunlight path to Gringotts Bank in London, coming off like a gleaming last light. A group of people was walking towards the bank down the Alley. That is, Diagon Alley. It was a very eclectic group of people and they had been watched for all evening. It was rumored that the Black Heir, Sirius Black, Mass Murderer, had been killed earlier in the week, and people where waiting to see who was going to benefit from the man's death. The best seats of course where at Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor, and people where gossiping about what was going to happen to the Black Family Fortune. Rumor held above all that it was going to go to Scion Draco Malfoy, but others said that it wasn't so. Finally hours after the watch had first started, even the oldest hag in the Alley fell silent. The Brick entryway to Diagon Alley and breaths caught.</p><p> </p><p>At the brick entrance was Alastor “Mad Eye” Moody, wand out, one good eye and one rolling eye roving madly around the alley and then a flick of his wand back out the way he'd came and he was moving forward. The stump of his peg leg echoing in the suddenly absolute silence of the Alley. The next that came through was the tall impressive form of Kingsley Shacklebolt, wand held out as well, taking the opposite side of the Alley. Arriving in a gleam of sunlight that made more than a few witches beam at the tough tall good looking auror. Arriving through the center was dark purple hair and a pale thin face, wand outstretched and clenched around her fingers. Inside of that phalanx walked the “Leader” of the Light, Albus Dumbledore. He strode down the Alley, pausing for the groups watching to see his form, fine blue robes edged with stars, he pushed up the small grandfatherly glasses up his nose, and glanced around before walking towards the bank. Ignoring the guards who shifting eyes noticed that did not move.</p><p> </p><p>A group of red heads stepped through after them, first through was a tall redhead with a mark down his face. Then his burn scarred brother in black dragon hide, twin brothers faced outwards, wands clenched in fists, and a young girl with red hair, perhaps 14 or 15 years old in the middle, her wand white knuckled around a pinched upset face. After that came Molly and Arthur Weasley, Molly had red-rimmed eyes and Arthur, normally pleasant and happy man that was well-respected for all that he was poor looked uncommonly serious. Behind them, breaths caught and held as the phalanx of what could only be guards moved forward.</p><p> </p><p>Bushy hair and thin pale skin was the first thing spotted, and the curious behavior drew more attention. A young woman, worn jeans and a jumper that had a R on it appeared, a figure was guided by her, worn jeans, grey baggy t-shirt. The twittering stopped as it was realized who she was guiding with another red head. Someone whispered that was Ronald, Arthur's youngest boy, but it was the boy in the middle of the pair that caught the attention of the alley. Harry James Potter stepped into the brick entrance way, green eyes where red-rimmed, he looked pale, unwell, and too-skinny. Shadows under his eyes- it was plain even to the moderately unintelligent that the young man was either not well or had been perhaps even ill. It was the general consensus that the young man was not mourning his Godfather, the man had killed his parents after all. Or at least gotten them killed.</p><p> </p><p>Following them was a black headed Neville Longbottom, and a spacey looking blond, and then the aged tired form of Werewolf Remus Lupin. Ronald and Hermione where helping the dark haired young man down the alley, but it wasn't missed that each had their wands near to hand or in actual hand.</p><p> </p><p>It did not take long for the large group to be guided to Gringotts. A guard at the entrance bowed to them, and lead them towards a side door. They where expected, and the furor after they entered Gringotts rose. The Malfoy's and Tonks had entered earlier. Inside Gringotts a lawyer, and a goblin stood in front of the desk, chatting as people started filing into the room. As the group entered, wands carefully stowed as they entered the bank and then furthermore into the room. Only an idiot brought a wand out at Gringotts. A glance upon entering the room by dim green eyes told Harry that the Malfoy's where already in attendance, as where the Tonks, Professor McGonnigal, His own group, and Severus Snape. Harry was gently guided to a chair by Molly Weasley, Hermione scooted her chair over and rested her head against Harry's shoulder, trying to comfort the young man. Ronald had one hand on his best friends shoulder. Offering silent comfort as he did not know what to say. He watched as the Tonk's parents moved over to stand behind their daughter and then seated themselves behind her too.</p><p> </p><p>A guard closed the door, and a Goblin moved behind the desk, and the lawyer moved to stand next to the desk. A piece of parchment was brought out. Names called out and confirmed. Finally when the last name was called – Luna Lovegood, the Goblin started to speak, holding the parchment in his hand.</p><p> </p>
