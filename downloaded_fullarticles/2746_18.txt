Jon had stopped to gape at the bright red train awaiting the crowd of Hogwart students emerging onto Platform 9 ¾.</p><p>"I've a mind to just leave ya if you're planning to just stand there all day. Come Grey Wind!" Robb said with a smirk as he passed Jon and walked ahead of him. Panting alongside the Stark boy was a light gray direwolf pup whose enormous size made a few on-lookers gasp. Despite being just a year old, the direwolf was already bigger than most full-grown mastiffs.</p><p>"Are you excited for your first year Jon?" His little sister, Arya asked from beside him. Her dark brown hair was tied up in pigtails and she had a lollipop stick sticking out the left side of her mouth.</p><p>Jon smiled down at her, "More nervous than excited."</p><p>"I can't wait till I get to go!" she squealed. "I'm going to learn all that I can about Dark wizards and Black Magic and Dueling Spells and – "</p><p>"That's enough of that." Came a deep rough voice from behind them.</p><p>Ned Stark lay a hand on his daughter's head and smiled softly at her, "Run to your mother now. I need to speak to Jon for a moment."</p><p>Arya nodded with a grin and ran towards the direction Robb had gone.</p><p>Jon took a deep breath wondering if he was in trouble. He pulled up the strap of his knapsack over his shoulder and looked up at his Father.</p><p>Eddard Stark, Lord Duke of Winterfell and Governor of the Northern States of Great Britain, cut a striking figure in the crowd. Dressed in a Muggle business suit with his brown hair tied back in a short bun behind his head, he looked every bit the royal politician. A green pin with the direwolf sigil of House Stark was pinned on his lapel.</p><p>His family had managed to avoid the paparazzi, both Muggle and Magic, as they walked through King's Cross station. Very rarely do the Starks venture out from their Winterfell manor all together but as soon as Robb was old enough to attend the prestigious Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Ned insisted the entire family see his eldest son off at the station. Despite the initial resistance from the Lady Duchess and against the advice of his counselors, Ned asserted that he will continue to see his children off every year until all the Stark children completed their schooling.</p><p>"You all right there, Jon?" Ned Stark asked, placing a hand on the boy's shoulder.</p><p>Jon nodded as he answered hesitantly, "Yes, Father."</p><p>Ned moved in front of his son so they were face to face, the boy nearly as tall as him despite only being 16 years of age.</p><p>"I know it's never been easy for you, son. But I know you'll do well. I believe you will. This is a chance for you to find out who you're going to be and what path you'll take."</p><p>Jon stared at his feet as his Father talked.</p><p>After a few moments, Jon looked up at him, "Would my mother be proud of me? I know you never talk about her but… is she alive? Does she know where I am or where I'm going? Does she care?"</p><p>Ned moved his hand to his son's face and looked at him earnestly, "When you come home for the summer. We'll talk about your Mother. I promise."</p><p>Ned kissed his son's forehead and looked at him, "Come on. Your brothers and sisters are waiting."</p><p>Jon nodded as he followed behind his father. In a few moments, they found the rest of their pack. Lady Duchess Catelyn Stark had her hands full with both her young sons. She carried 3 year old Rickon Stark with one arm and clutching her other hand tightly was 8 year-old Brandon Stark. Arya and Sansa were bickering over who would get Robb's room for the rest of the year.</p><p>"I'm next oldest so, obviously, I get to have it." Sansa stated matter-of-factly.</p><p>Arya folded her arms in anger and countered, "I don't see why you need it. All you do all day is write long love letters to your <em>beloved Prince Joffrey.</em>"</p><p>"ARYA!" Sansa yelled as her face turned as red as her hair, glancing worriedly at her mother who didn't seem to notice as Rickon was starting to throw a fit.</p><p>"About time!" Robb exclaimed when he saw his father and brother, "The train's about to leave!"</p><p>"The train isn't going anywhere for the next five minutes." Ned stated, as he and Jon Snow joined them. Ned took Rickon from his mother's arms, and his wife glanced at him with relief.</p><p>Robb placed a hand on Jon's shoulder, "Ready? I had our things stowed away in the back, so all we need to do is get on."</p><p>"Where's Grey Wind?" Brandon asked.</p><p>Robb looked down at his younger brother and grinned, "Had to cage him. He's in the back as well with the other animals. But he'll be alright Bran, you'll see him again next year! And he'll be even bigger then!"</p><p>"Do you think I'll get my own direwolf too?" asked Bran in a timid voice.</p><p>"If you do well in school and be good, you'll get your Hogwarts letter AND your direwolf in no time. Alright?" Robb stated encouragingly.</p><p>Bran gave his brother a toothless grin and nodded excitedly.</p><p>"Goodbye, Mother." Robb said as he gave the Lady Duchess a hug.</p><p>Catelyn kissed both of Robb's cheeks, "You be good now, and send an owl to me when you get there."</p><p>Robb sighed, "I will."</p><p>He then gave each of his siblings one final embrace before turning to his father. Ned embraced his eldest son with one arm, "Watch out for Jon, won't you?"</p><p>Robb laughed, "Snow can look after himself, Father."</p><p>Jon stood awkwardly to the side as he watched Robb bid farewell to his family. Even now, he still felt like an outsider. <em>The Bastard of Winterfell.</em></p><p>All of a sudden, a pair of arms encircled his waist and Jon chuckled lightly. "I'll miss you little sister."</p><p>"Goodbye Jon! Write to me, won't you? I'm going to be so bored without you!" Arya declared.</p><p>Jon nodded, "Whenever I can. Just, don't get in too much trouble while I'm gone alright?"</p><p>Arya grimaced, "I'll try. Can't promise anything though. Now that I'm stuck with that one."</p><p>Sansa stuck her tongue out at her younger sister when she heard that. Jon looked at his other sister and nodded, "Goodbye Sansa."</p><p>Sansa looked as if she didn't hear and instead waved at Robb.</p><p>Jon sighed, he never did get along with Sansa as well as his other siblings. He approached Brandon who let go of his Mother's hand as Jon crouched down in front of him.</p><p>"Be good Bran, I'll be back." Jon said as he embraced his little brother who looked like he was about to cry.</p><p>"Will you still be there when it's my turn to go?" Bran asked in a small voice.</p><p>Jon shook his head as he pulled back to face Bran, "I'll be twenty two by the time I'm done and you'll still be fourteen. But don't worry, I promise I'll be here on your very first day just like you're here for mine."</p><p>Bran nodded slowly, "Alright."</p><p>Jon patted his little brother's head affectionately before Bran returned to Lady Catelyn's side, Jon looked up at her hesitantly. The Lady Duchess's lips were closed tightly and it was clear that the warmth she had given her eldest son was lost on him. Jon was, after all, not her son and she had never let him forget it for as long as he could remember. Jon bowed his head to her respectfully before walking towards his Father who was carrying his other brother, Rickon.</p><p>Jon ruffled Rickon's hair and the young Stark boy giggled.</p><p>"Farewell, Lord Stark." Jon said, opting to use his father's formal address.</p><p>Ned nodded at him.</p><p>Just as he was about to go to turn, he heard his father call his name.</p><p>"Jon."</p><p>When he turned, one of his father's personnel was holding a perforated box. Jon looked at his father curiously.</p><p>"Go on. Open it." His father stated.</p><p>Just as Jon opened a flap, a snow-white ball of fluff came tumbling out and into his arms. Whatever it was, yipped loudly in his ear and as he held out his arms to see what creature had jumped out at him, he found himself holding on to a snow-white direwolf pup. Its small eyes were dark red as it blinked happily at him.</p><p>"A direwolf? But... I'm not a Stark." Jon said, surprise and confusion in his eyes as he looked at Ned.</p><p>Ned smiled at his son warmly, "The direwolf is the sigil of our House, Jon. Every Stark has had one as their loyal companion for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood. Never forget that."</p><p>The whistle of the train caught their attention.</p><p>"ALL ABOARD!" the train's conductor yelled out. Students bade their families a final goodbye and quickly ran to board the train.</p><p>"Jon! Come on!"</p><p>Jon turned to see his brother Robb already on the train and waving at him.</p><p>Jon looked back at Ned who nodded his head urging him to go. Cradling the white pup in his arm, Jon gave a final wave to his half-siblings before he sprinted towards the Hogwarts Express.</p><p>"Goodbye Jon! Goodbye Robb!" yelled Arya, her red lollipop in her outstretched hand.</p><p>Jon quickly climbed into the train next to his brother. As the train began to roll forward, Jon gave a last look at his family.</p><p>The last thing Jon saw as the train pulled out of the station was his father's smiling face before it disappeared into the distance.</p>
