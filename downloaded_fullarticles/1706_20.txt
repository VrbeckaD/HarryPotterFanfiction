  <em>"You know Voldemort's snake, Neville? He's got a huge snake... Calls her Nagini... It's got to be killed."</em>
</p><p>Neville can still hear Harry's last words to him, they keep echoing in his head as he looks at his lifeless body.</p><p>Neville had promised Harry, without knowing where he was headed, without knowing what he had said meant, without knowing that it will be the last thing he would ever say to him.</p><p>And he hadn't been able to keep that promise, Voldemort was gone, and so was his snake, and in their wake was left just dead bodies, so many of them.</p><p>Ginny is crying over Harry, that he can see through his tears, he can hear the anguished cries of so many people losing so much in just one day.</p><p>Hannah holds his left hand, consoling, and in his right burns the coin that had summoned all the dead to the battle, to their deaths.</p><p>It was supposed to be a victory, supposed to be the end of all the fighting.</p><p>And yet no one has won, no war has ended, even if the battle did.</p><p>For the first time all year, he feels like a kid again.</p><p>Afraid.</p><p>Stupid.</p><p>Careless.</p><p>Harry's eyes stare at him sightless, even closed, accusing.</p><p>And Neville wants to accuse him, because he was supposed to save them.</p><p>And then he feels guilty, because Harry was just a kid like him too, how was he supposed to save them, he thinks hysterically, why did everyone believe that.</p><p>He wants to go see his parents, see them move without knowing who he is, give him candy wrappers, he wants to protect them.Â </p><p>He wants to go back to Gran, wants her to protect him, wants to hide in her arms and cry.</p><p>The cries are echoing in the Great Hall now.</p><p>His tears falls.</p><p>Hannah holds his hand.</p><p>And the coin burns.</p>
