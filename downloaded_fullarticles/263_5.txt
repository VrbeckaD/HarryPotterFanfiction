    <p>Mrs Castor woke at approximately a quarter to midnight, as she had almost every night for the last six weeks. Her baby cried in the Moses basket beside her bed, but it was unlike the crying of any other child she’d heard. It was more of a sob, a noise that could only be made by a sad little creature …</p>
<p>Mrs Castor fancied that, even at six weeks old, her little girl knew that her father had had to go away. She knew that she missed him, even without really knowing him.</p>
<p>As she slipped out of bed, moving to scoop the child into her arms to soothe her, Mrs Castor felt the coldness of the room crashing over her body like the sudden pangs of loneliness that swept in every now and again. How she missed her husband … but she knew that his absence was vital.</p>
<p>She gently bobbed up and down with the tiny girl in her arms, delicately jigging her until her cries turned to soft gurgles and finally a peaceful silence. The mother looked to her child to see her gazing up with the biggest, most loving eyes one could imagine, a small, pudgy hand raised to her wet, pink lips ready to gum in contentment.</p>
<p>Smiling, Mrs Castor sat with her baby in the large bay window, peering deep into the night sky beyond. Stars of various sizes winked back at her, glittering happily as they always did. For this reason, Mrs Castor hardly ever drew the curtains at night. On the nights where a bright full moon could be seen, the room was bathed in an eerie yet strangely comforting white glow. Tonight, however, was quite dark.</p>
<p>Soon enough, her daughter was sleeping soundly in her arms. It would not be as difficult to place her back in her own bed, now. Craning her neck down to tenderly kiss the child on the forehead, Mrs Castor whispered, “Sweet dreams, little fairy,” before tucking her into the cradle.</p>
<p>The quiet, elegant woman decided that, since it was rather late, she would go back to bed herself. However, sitting upright in bed with the duvet pulled up to her waist, Mrs Castor looked to her bedside table and picked up the equally elegant, twisted chestnut wand sat upon the bedside table. Balancing the implement delicately between her index and middle fingers and thumb, she gave a little flick of her wrist and summoned to her person an already steaming hot cup of tea.</p>
<p>With her favourite pillow plump and propped up behind her, Mrs Castor snuggled into bed as best she could, sipping the hot liquid while blanketing the slumbering child next to her with adoration, simply by looking at her.</p>
<p>She knew that it mattered not the length of the night, she would always find peace and comfort in the presence of that tiny baby girl, and she continued to remind herself of this until slowly but surely, her eyes grew heavy with sleep.</p>

<p>“(F/N) Castor, where have you been? It is well past teatime!”</p>
<p>The little girl looked up at the strict-looking woman standing before her, with her hands on her hips and wearing an apron covered with flour. The hallway seemed so much smaller with her aunt towering over her.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry Auntie Beth …” she said in a small voice. “I was out playing with Eddie, and he said he found a badger sett just the other side of the weir, so we went to have a look and lost track of time …”</p>
<p>Auntie Beth couldn’t stay cross with her niece for very long. Her kind eyes, once narrowed sternly, now crinkled at the corners with a loving smile.</p>
<p>“Did you really?” she asked with enthusiasm, ushering the little girl through to the kitchen with a floury hand on her tiny shoulder. “What, the weir in the woods behind Mrs Tanner’s house?”</p>
<p>Auntie Beth knew precisely which weir. There was only one, completely natural, and made for a nice, shallow crossing over the river. It was mid-September, so she wasn’t too concerned about the height of the water yet, but her niece was only seven years old …</p>
<p>“Yes, Auntie!” said (F/N) excitedly, bobbed (H/C) locks bouncing as she clambered into her seat at the kitchen table. Auntie Beth smiled encouragingly, having forgotten her worries from moments ago, wanting to hear all about (F/N)’s adventure. Auntie Beth set a plate with a halved, buttered and jammed scone down in front of her niece while she babbled excitedly away, telling her how Eddie said he’d never seen a badger before and then, as if by magic, a little black-and-white nose came snuffling out of the big hole in the ground. And <em>that</em>, she said, was how she knew it was getting late.</p>
<p>Auntie Beth smiled as she did the washing up. The oven was on, as was the stove, and something delicious was cooking for dinner. The sky was now orange with the setting sun, and soon it would be dark. She knew that (F/N) was a capable girl, but she didn’t like the thought of her being out at twilight. There were all sorts of things that could dwell in the countryside surrounding their village …</p>
<p>When she had finished her scone, her aunt gave her a glass of milk to sit in front of the fire with while she got dinner ready, because she hadn’t wanted to start while her niece was still outside. When Auntie Beth decided that (F/N) had been quiet for quite some time, she popped her head round the door of the living-room, only to find the girl sitting cross-legged in front of the hearth with a large book spread open in her lap and her glass of milk sitting nearby atop a coaster on the coffee table.</p>
<p>She smiled before returning to the kitchen.</p>
<p>The girl was just like her father and Auntie Beth knew precisely what to expect in the coming years. She was kind like him, and studious, and most certainly exhibited the same taste for adventure as he did.</p>
<p>Soon, the girl’s wild imagination (she always talked about magic, spinning incredible tales of magical creatures and equally magical people) would be rewarded with a truth that could not be locked away forever.</p>
