    <p>She sat at her desk, absently twisting her ring one way and then the other. Draco glanced up, watching her over the pile of parchment he was reading. Her shoulders were tight and she seemed to be curling in on herself, like she wanted to not be noticed…to disappear. She sighed heavily and looked up, catching his eye. She smiled, slightly forced and not reaching all the way to her eyes, and sent three little pulses of magic through the thread connecting them. It was their own secret signal to say “I love you” and he sent pulses back and winked.</p>
<p>She got up and stretched, rubbing the knot in her neck. Draco couldn’t help but stare as the shirt pulled tight across her chest and she moaned slightly as the muscles loosened. He looked down quickly, staring fixedly at the papers on his desk and willed his body to behave. “I’m going to the lab” she said from the doorway “Come get me when it is time to go home?” He nodded and she blew him a kiss before vanishing.</p>
<p>As soon as she was out of sigh he opened the bottom drawer of his desk and began sifting through a stack of papers. Finding the one he wanted he leaned back, drumming his fingers on the desk. It was risky, if he got caught…the thought drifted off unfinished. Was it worth it? He thought about her, thought about her eyes, the way she was going through the motions with the smile never reaching them. No one could live like that forever. Pinching the bridge of his nose he moved the jar of blue flame to the center of his desk.</p>
<p>This was another Hermione invention, like a floo version of a cell phone. Simply drop floo powder into the jar and you could make your call, it was much more comfortable then kneeling in front of a fireplace. He took a deep breath and dropped in the powder. Almost immediately Potter’s tousled head appeared, slightly distorted by the curve of the glass. “Malfoy? Is everything alright?” He sounded worried and Draco couldn’t blame him, they didn’t exactly call to gossip regularly.</p>
<p>“Everyone is safe” Draco reassured him “Do you have time to talk?”</p>
<p>Harry glanced down then nodded “Yeah, I have an hour before my next thing. Meet at the café?” Draco nodded curtly and pushed the glass away. He pulled on his robes and headed out, almost bumping into Theo.</p>
<p>“Are you headed down to the labs?” Draco asked and Theo nodded “Can you tell Hermione I’m going for an hour but will be back to floo home with her?”</p>
<p>“Sure thing” Theo said cheerfully and Draco nodded his thanks and headed out. As he walked quickly down the street toward the café his thoughts drifted back to three weeks ago, when this whole damn thing had started.</p>
<p>
  <em>“I’m going to Australia” she announced and bounced up and down in excitement. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Draco’s heart stuttered but he tried to stay calm. “Oh?” He inquired and she nodded decisively</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I’m going to marry you” she said with a smile, lingering over the words “and I want my parents to be there.” Draco inhaled sharply, he knew she had been debating since the end of the war with whether she should try and restore her parent’s memories. Her guilt and her fear and her eagerness all washing over her in turns. She continued, her face glowing “I’m going to find them and try to reverse the spell. I’ve got a Portkey scheduled for tomorrow. Before you ask, I’m doing this myself. I need to, for them and for me.” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>He had tried to argue, but she wouldn’t budge and he knew better then to try and force it. So, the next morning he walked her to the Portkey office and kissed her goodbye, putting on a much more confident face then he felt. Only after she whirled out of sight did the mask crumble and the worry show through. His skill with Occulmency had taught him a lot about how memories worked, and he had also seen minds that had been obliviated. He knew she was talented, which actually might be part of the problem. A spell as strong as she had made would be hard to undo. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She had planned to be gone for two weeks, which is why the sudden shudder of her magic and the crack of her apparition through the wards three days later made him jump. He raced into the living room, barely catching her before she fell into a sobbing tangled heap He cradled her, pouring words into her ear as she cried and between her gasps piecing the story together. She had found them, tried to reverse the spell, but it was too tangled, too embedded in their minds to do quickly. She had tried but finally gave up, afraid she would do too much damage. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>He had thought the sobs had broken his heart, but they were nothing to the resigned sadness that came after. Her refusal to talk about it. Her clipped cheerfulness and her insistence that she was “Fine, just fine.”</em>
</p>
<p>Shaking his head to clear the memory he slid into the chair. Green eyes met gray as Harry eyed him over a teacup “What did you do” he asked finally and Draco looked slightly affronted</p>
<p>“What do you mean, what did I do?” he snapped back and Harry grinned</p>
<p>“I just assumed if you were asking for my help then you must have gotten yourself pretty deep into a hole.” Harry said with a shrug and Draco rolled his eyes. Pausing for a moment to order from the waitress before turning back to man across the table.</p>
<p>“I’ll have you know Potter that this has nothing to do with me and everything to do with Hermione.” Draco fiddled with the napkin in front of him and the insecurity radiating off of him made Harry soften slightly.</p>
<p>“Alright, I believe you” he said “So what’s up? What can the Chosen One do for you today?”</p>
<p>Draco huffed a laugh and leaned back in his chair “Did Hermione tell you anything about what her plans were a few weeks ago.”</p>
<p>Harry regarded him cautiously “You mean Australia” he said finally and Draco nodded “She told me she was going, that she was going to try to reverse the spell on her parents. She asked me not to tell anyone else, not even Ginny.”</p>
<p>“Well she’s back” Draco said flatly</p>
<p>Harry looked confused and set down his cup with a clack “Wait, that can’t be right, she was going to stay a few weeks, she said not to worry that she’d get in touch when she got back”</p>
<p>Draco nodded his thanks as the waitress brought his tea and carefully stirred honey into it “She came back after three days” he said quietly</p>
<p>“Shit” Harry muttered, running his hands through his messy black hair “Three days” he repeated “I’m guessing…”</p>
<p>“She was a mess” Draco said emphatically “Cried for hours. But what’s worse is that now she isn’t crying. Now she claims she is fine. She won’t talk about it, just smiles a tight little smile and promises me everything is alright.”</p>
<p>“Which clearly it is not” Harry finished for him and Draco nodded “Ok, well, shit” he said again pushing up his glasses and rubbing his eyes with the heels of his hands “What are you hoping I can do? Talk to her?”</p>
<p>Draco toyed with the teacup and finally looked Harry straight in the eye “I want to try to do it” he said bluntly “I want to see if I can reverse the spell.” Harry looked shocked and took a long sip from his mug, giving himself time to think.</p>
<p>“Ok” he said slowly “So, once again, what do you need me for?”</p>
<p>Draco threw up his hands in frustration “I need you to tell me if this is a good idea” he snapped “I want to fix this. I want to make this better. I need to, she is hurting and this is the only thing I can think of to do.”</p>
<p>“But” Harry prompted and Draco growled with frustration</p>
<p>“If I can do it, I don’t feel like I should without her knowing for Merlin’s sake, they are HER parents. But if I can’t I don’t want to get her hopes up just to break her heart again.” Draco dropped his head in his hands and muttered mostly to herself “I can’t be the one to cause her more pain.”</p>
<p>Harry looked at him thoughtfully “What makes you think you can undo something that Hermione Granger couldn’t? I know you are smart Draco but she is SCARY smart.”</p>
<p>Draco gave a half smile and pulled out the paper he’d been hiding in his desk “I know you were shit at Occulmency and Legilimency Harry but not all of us are that bad. It is more than shielding your mind or diving headfirst into someone else’s, it is compartmentalizing memories and being able to recognize what is there and what is missing.  Living with Voldemort made me learn fast how to do both.”</p>
<p>Harry grimaced at the thought of why Draco would need to be a fast learner “Also” Draco continued “Now that I know more about how magic works, how the spells come together, I feel like I could combine the two to pick apart a spell….like we did with the Castle’s magic.” He slid the paper to Harry who scanned it quickly “I’ve been exchanging owls with a doctor in Australia” he continued “Who has been doing some research on residual spell magic, mostly in terms of jinxes and curses but the same principles might apply here.”</p>
<p>Harry gave the paper back to Draco and sat, lost in thought. Draco stilled his mind and body and sipped his tea, willing himself to remain calm. Finally, Harry refocused and looked at him “You can’t do it without her permission” he said firmly and Draco’s heart fell, he didn’t think that he could approach her with little more then a whiff of a theory “But” Harry held up a finger “You can get farther then this. Figure out if it is possible, or at least as close as you can get. Then, if you really think you can you talk to her.”</p>
<p>Draco exhaled and nodded at Harry “Thank you” he said tentatively “That’s what I thought too but I didn’t trust myself. My, I, well, this was too important to get wrong.”</p>
<p>Harry threw down some coins and stood, extending a hand to Draco “She is lucky to have you” he said sincerely “I’m glad you love her like you do.” Draco shook Harry’s hand, at a loss for how to respond, and headed back to Declaration to retrieve Hermione.</p>
