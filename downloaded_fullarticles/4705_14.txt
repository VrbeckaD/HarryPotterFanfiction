<p>Pansy waited for Daphne to show. She scowled into her glass of wine as she sat in the back of the crowded restaurant. It had been Daphne’s idea to go out, Pansy had been wallowing around her apartment, staring at all the pictures. It had been six months since her break up and Daphne had told her enough was enough. She had thought she wouldn’t fall in love but she had. It sucked hippogriff balls. The breakup while it didn’t come out of nowhere still came out of nowhere. They had been happy- or she had thought they’d been happy. at least she still had her friends, she was thankful for that at least- even if they were late.</p>
<p>She looked over the menu again, and then the wine list again. Gillyweed was a trendy new place that Draco had raved about.  Daphne in her quest to get her out of the house had begged Pansy to join her- because eating alone was sad. Pansy had rolled her eyes, calculated her months budget and agreed. She regretted it now. The place was dimly lit by floating orbs that glowed blue fire. The walls were painted a deep red while tables and chairs were some dark wood. She was glad there weren’t candles on the table. Some booths she noticed however did have candles, it was a little cliché for her- but she got why Draco came here all the time.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Daphne said. She was in bright pink robes that were, if Pansy kept up with fashion, last season. Daphne wore pearls and had her hair in a bun. She looked the part of a pureblood princess.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Pansy shrugged. She was just glad to have put on her semi-nice robes before coming.</p>
<p>“I get held up by Roger,” Daphne sighed, a small smile graced her lips before she turned narrow eyed to Pansy. Pansy waited for whatever lecture was about to happen.</p>
<p>“We should do something this weekend, if you’re not busy.” Daphne said after a moment. Pansy stared at her then before nodding slowly.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Pansy sighed, “After I give Harry some more of his things back.” Daphne paused her water almost halfway to her lips. Getting Harry Potter to take his things back was like trying to get Draco to buy a shirt for less than ten gallons.</p>
<p>“Are we ready to order?” the waiter asked. He saved Pansy from explaining herself for now, for that she was grateful.</p>
<p>“I’ll have the chicken parm,” Pansy said. The waiter and Pansy turned to look at Daphne. She turned pink and scanned the menu.</p>
<p>“I’ll have the eggplant parm,” Daphne muttered. She smiled at the waiter as he left before turning her gaze back to Pansy.</p>
<p>“So how’s Roger?” Pansy asked. He was her latest boyfriend. The best way to keep Daphne from talking about her was to have Daphne talk about herself.</p>
<p>“What?” Daphne asked confused. She frowned in thought. That was a good sign, Daphne rarely gave thought to her boyfriend of the month. She usually smiled and shrugged- maybe she was getting serious.</p>
<p>“Your boyfriend?” Pansy prompted.  Pansy didn’t really care, they’d been dating for almost eight months but Daphne hardly got pass the year point with anyone.  She was a serial monogamous when it came to men.</p>
<p>“Good, we’re…ah…we’re moving in together.” Daphne told her smiling. Pansy pretended not to be amazed. Daphne went from relationship to single as easily as a knife through butter. It was one of the reasons Pansy had been avoiding her since the breakup. She would have probably dragged Pansy on several awkward blind dates with Roger’s friends. Roger seemed like he friends would be tools.</p>
<p>“That’s great. You’ve never gotten this far before.” Pansy told her with a smile. Daphne laugh and shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>“He goes down on me too much for me to give him up. And he listens to what I have to say. I feel so sorry for Astoria. Go on and on about rights for god knows…” Daphne began. Pansy tune her out. It was easier with their meal in front of them. Pansy just nodded and kept her mouth full. The subject of her break up and whatnot were thankful not brought up.</p>
<p>“I’ll owl you about Saturday?” Daphne asked as they walked out.</p>
<p>“Fine,” Pansy sighed.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Harry Potter was always on time, which Pansy was thankful for. It meant he could get in and get out before she said something she’d regret. She had all the things ready and in a box waiting for him. Pansy had wanted to just leave the box in front of the door but decided to be an actually adult. She dreaded the doorbell when it rang- she wondered if he’d bring her.</p>
<p>Potter didn’t use the door though, he apparated right into the living room. Pansy frowned making a mental not to change the wards. He stood for a second looking around before he turned to face her. Potter had grown into a man’s body. His broad shoulders and bulky robe hid a powerful frame. Pansy remembered the first time she had seen him since Hogwarts- he had brought someone into St. Mungo’s. He had sneered and so had she but he was fit- just like the Witches Weekly suggested.</p>
<p>“Pansy,” Potter gave a weak smile. She didn’t return it. He looked like he wanted to say more but he wisely kept his mouth shut.</p>
<p>Pansy went to the front door, where he things were. Potter followed. She was glad she’d taken down all the pictures of them as they passed by a muggle picture of some princess. Astoria had told her it was classy. She didn’t have to heart to tell her she would probably sell the furniture and the apartment after Potter was done getting his stuff.</p>
<p>“Here, I don’t remember if there’s more.” Pansy told him. It was a lie but she didn’t care, she was trying not to be bitter.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to give me my stuff back,” Potter asked after a minute.</p>
<p>“No, I do,” Pansy told him flatly. Potter sighed and looked at her, she tried not to look away first.</p>
<p>“Pansy,” Potter began sighing, “I’m sorry. I didn’t…”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter does it? I’m dating again. I’m going to make sure he’s not an asshole. I’m having fun taking my mind off loving you!” Pansy cut him off. Potter scowled.</p>
<p>“You tell me that now? We were together for what almost two years. I can count on my hand how many times you told me you loved me, Parkinson,” Potter snapped.</p>
<p>“Fuck you Potter, just take your things and go. I deserve someone who loves me, values me and it’s obviously not you.” Pansy told him. He looked hurt but she crossed her arms upset. True she hadn’t said ‘I love you’ a lot but she had thought he’d know because she had showed it.</p>
<p>“I’m getting what I deserve.” Potter told her. Pansy wanted to slap him.</p>
<p>“So it’s that easy to just forget about me. I might not have said it often but you knew Potter. You fucking knew. Why would we have almost moved in together? Had Teddy be a part of my life? I thought we had something more, I thought… I hope she makes you happy.” Pansy all but shouted at him.</p>
<p>“What if this is just going to fast? What if this…doesn’t work out?” Potter asked softly. He was crowding her space, like before they broke up.</p>
<p>“And what if it did?” Pansy sighed then asked, “Did you even mean it when you said you loved me?” Potter sighed, his eyes searching for something, before his kissed her.</p>
<p>Pansy was surprised at first, her body rigid. Potter almost stopped until she kissed him back. It was stupid, but she pressed herself against him anyway. Their clothes were quickly discarded on the floor- it always felt exciting to take them off without magic. Potter’s finger slowly pushed inside her before the real thing. Pansy nearly came as he pulled out. In, out, in, out hard and fast- they weren’t going to last long. Potter sucked on her neck, right where he knew she liked it- she came. Her body felt light, she felt Potter too.</p>
<p>They stood there breathing heavy. Potter pulled out and started to pull himself together. Pansy needed a few more second before she could even start looking for her bra. She smiled slightly when Potter handed it to her. Her after-low sex haze was popped when she realized they had just fucked.</p>
<p>“Did you ever cheat on me?” Pansy asked suddenly. The need to know was overwhelming. Potter frowned at her.</p>
<p>“What?” he asked confused. Pansy felt relief, though Potter never seemed the kind of person to cheat.</p>
<p>“You’re with her now and we just had sex.” Pansy told him slowly, “So did you ever cheat on me?”</p>
<p>“No, fuck, no…” Potter sighed, “I’m not with her. And I don’t know about her or us. If she asks though I’ll tell her we had sex.”</p>
<p>“How noble,” Pansy said. She hoped it didn’t come out as bitter as she had thought. Judging by Potter’s face she hadn’t succeed.</p>
<p>“I still love her too. I love you but I just don’t know... I’m not breaking up with you to be with her. I don’t think it’s fair that I’m with you if I have doubts.” Potter told her. Pansy was extremely glad he wasn’t still inside her. She felt so hurt and used.</p>
<p>“I’m going to be gone for a week, so get all your stuff before I get back okay,” Pansy said.</p>
<p>“What if I don’t want to?” Potter asked. He grabbed the box and this time opened the door.</p>
<p>“I’m not gonna wait for you to decide, Potter.” Pansy told him. She didn’t turn to see him, it was only when the door shut that she sighed in relief.</p>
