    <p>After exiting Gringotts, Harry didn’t know where to run next, now that he had his very own bag of money. He didn’t have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life - more money than even Dudley ever had.</p><p>“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding towards Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions.  </p><p>“Wait - can i get a pet first?” Harry asked, not even trying to keep the wonder out of his voice at having his very own owl, or cat (he didn’t really fancy a toad). </p><p>“Well, sure, if tha’s what you want,” Hagrid agreed, a big smile poking out of his wiry beard. He gestured to a shop called Magical Menagerie. Harry grabbed Hagrid’s hand and pulled him along, getting some amused smiles from passers by. </p><p>Entering the shop, Harry was filled with awe. There must have been a few hundred cages of owls in a front section to the left of the door, cats roaming around behind them, which harry thought was just an accident waiting to happen. There were a few cages of shiny black rats sitting on pedestals. </p><p>As Hagrid went over to talk to the person behind the till, Harry wandered around , wondering just how he was meant to choose. He walked over to the back, where there were tanks that he hadn’t noticed before. All had yellow light shining into them. Coiled under a false rock in one container, was a small snake. The plaque on the side said:</p><p> </p><p>Ball python<br/>

35 galleons</p><p>“Hhelloo,” whispered the snake, poking her head out of the rock. “Whho might you be?” She had patterned skin, light murky green with darker splotches that looked like abstract faces, and a dark stripe down the spine. </p><p>Harry got a sudden sense of deja vu, remembering the snake at the zoo, that he accidentally broke out.  “Uh, hi? I’m Harry, and I’m looking for a pet,” He awkwardly bent down so he could be at eye level with the snake.</p><p>“Welll, have you conssiderred a snnakkeee?” she asked.</p><p>“Not really,” Harry replied, “My Hogwarts letter said only cats, owls and toads.”</p><p>“Oh, manny sstudentss buy snnakess asss petss,” she promised eagerly. “Whhy, ssomeone boought a ssnakee jusst yessterday, headingg for Hogwartss.” </p><p>“Really?” at the snake’s nod, Harry lifted his head over the tank so he could look at the till, where hagrid was standing, chatting with the cashier. “Hagrid, can I have a snake?” </p><p>Hagrid’s head turned, and he bore a reluctant expression. “Are ye sure ye wouldn’ prefer an owl? All the kids want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer post an’ everythin’,” He reasoned.</p><p>“But this snake’s just lovely,” Harry said, “Please?” </p><p>Hagrid sighed. “Well, If yer heart’s dead set on it,” Hagrid ambled over to the tank to have a look. “I’ll admit, tha’s a pretty pretty snake there.” He said resignedly. </p><p>Harry and Hagrid stepped out of the shop a few minutes later, Harry with a shrunken tank in his pocket. The cashier had said that since hardly anyone ever buys snakes, he could have the tank and all of the things inside it too for an extra fifteen galleons. Harry assumed that was a good deal. </p><p>“Alrigh’ now, let’s get yer uniform.” Hagrid lead them back over to Madam Malkin’s, and pushed the door open for Harry to pass through. </p><p>Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed in all mauve. “Hogwarts, dear?” She said, when Harry started to speak. Hagrid nodded in his peripheral vision. “ Got the lot here - another young man being fitted up just now, in fact,” </p><p>Hagrid parked himself on a chair in the front room, while Harry was taken to the back. </p><p>In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length.</p><p>“Hullo,” said the other boy, “Hogwarts too?” </p><p>“Yes,” said Harry.</p><p>“My father’s next door buying my books and Mother’s up the street looking at wands,” said the boy. he had a bored, drawling voice. </p><p>“I just bought my pet,” Harry added, slightly intimidated by the boy’s obvious knowledge of the wizarding world. </p><p>“What did you buy? My mother was talking about buying me a hawk owl from one of our private breeders,” The boy said. Harry didn’t like the fact that he couldn’t tell whether he was bragging or not. Did everyone in the wizarding world have private owl breeders?</p><p>“I bought a ball python,” Harry told, hoping it would elicit a positive response.</p><p>“A python? That’s very cool. Snakes are my favorite animal, and symbol of slytherin house, you know. Know what house you’ll be in yet?” He asked, losing the cold mask that he had adopted while talking about his family. </p><p>“No clue,” Harry admitted shyly. </p><p>“Well, nobody really knows, I suppose. But obviously I’ll be in Slytherin. All of our family have been.” He proclaimed. </p><p>“I don’t really know much about the houses,” Harry hoped the boy wouldn’t think he was stupid. </p><p>“How come? Your parents aren’t.. Muggles, are they?” Harry could practically hear the sneer the boy was trying to cover.</p><p>“No, they were a witch and wizard, but they died,” Harry felt really uncomfortable telling a boy he didn’t even know that he was an orphan, but he was reassured by the lack of pity in the boy’s voice. </p><p>“That’s… terrible.” He said quite softly. “Well, the houses are Slytherin, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. Slytherins are ambitious, resourceful and know how to get their way. Some of the greatest wizards of all time were in slytherin, but there’s this stereotype that slytherin is the bad house.</p><p>“Then there’s Gryffindor. Slytherin and Gryffindor are age old rivals. Gryffindor favours nerve, chivalry, bravery. At least that’s what they tell you. I’ve met a couple and they’re all just really impulsive and don’t like rules,” This made Harry laugh, “Gryffindors are the personal favorites of the Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>“Ravenclaw is the house that values Wisdom and Intelligence, especially creativity. If not Slytherin, I’d definitely be a Ravenclaw.” </p><p>“I don’t think I’ll be a Ravenclaw, to be honest.” This got a smile out of the boy. </p><p>“All done!” Called Madam Malkin, and Harry looked down to see perfectly fitted robes. The witch attending to the other boy was already gone, having finished while they were talking. </p><p>The boys stepped down from the stools. “What about hufflepuff then?” Harry asked. They started wandering back to the front of the shop as the boy talked.</p><p>“Hufflepuff values hard work, perseverance and patience, but that house is full of pansies. Trust me, Hufflepuff’s the worst house. Plus, yellow doesn’t look good on most people, I doubt the students would pull it off.” He said with a smile.</p><p>“So, now that you know the houses, which one do you think?” he asked</p><p>“I still have no idea, to be honest,” Harry replied stopping short of the door. </p><p>“Well, I’d think either Slytherin or Gryffindor, maybe. Who knows? By the way, what’s your name?” The boy questioned.</p><p>“Uh, Harry Potter,” Harry said unsurely, not wanting the boy to think he was lying. His eyes darted to Harry’s forehead after a moment of surprise, where his scar was just visible through his hair. “You are?” Harry asked awkwardly.</p><p>“Draco, Malfoy.” he replied, his eyes returning back to Harry’s. “See you at Hogwarts, I suppose.” Draco stretched out his hand and Harry took it. He then left, to be berated by a man with the same pale hair.</p><p>“Draco! What took so long! We have places to be!” The man scolded quickly moving him along. </p><p>Harry came out of the shop to see Hagrid through the window nextdoor. He entered the shop, which was named Flourish and Blotts. “Harry! I though’ I’d pick up yer Books for ye, Just need to pay and we can get some ice cream, eh?” </p><p>“Sounds really nice, Hagrid.” Harry replied.</p>
