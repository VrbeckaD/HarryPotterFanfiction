    <p>Mutant Harry</p><p>New Mexico</p><p><br/>Ball of flames erupted from within the diner the x men were standing outside of. Logan was sent flying through the window of the diner, and landed in front of Nightcrawler.</p><p>Kurt leaned down to held the old man up “Logan, are you okay? What happened?” The blue skinned teleporter asked Logan as he regenerated “She remembers.” Logan informed as Jean Grey walked out from the flames as the Dark Phoenix. The X men were understandably shocked… well to some extent. You have to remember that this is Jean Grey we're talking about… I'm sure it's written somewhere that she can't stay dead permanently.</p><p>The redhead woman walked over to her long time friends, Iceman and Storm “Hello Bobby, Ororo” She greeted. “Hiya Jean” “Jean” the two greeted back casually. The Phoenix tuned to face a younger version of her husband? What? “Scott… What are… You're so young.” Jean said, with a confused look on her face. The younger Scott shook his head “I'm not… I'm not who you think I am” Jean skimmed through his mind “You're scared of me.” The telepath said and Scott gave a nod “Yes”</p><p>Hank McCoy aka Beast looked at Jean with a critical eye, since it was Phoenix they are dealing with “Is this it, Jean? Is this who you are?” The doctor asked. Jean shook her head at her old friend “It's who I've always been, Hank” Hank stared at her “No, it isn't.”</p><p>Jean was about to give a response but her back erupted into flames and the Phoenix itself came out of her “Stop! Hold your fire!” Kitty Pryde ordered “This is Jean’s fight!” Storm held out her arm as it began to crackle with lightning “For the moment.” The woman said, as everyone got into fighting stances.</p><p>Jean started to get off the ground, and glared at the Phoenix “Why can't you just leave me-” Jean gasped as Annie paced out of the flames “Jean, Honey, you need to calm down!” Annie ordered. The redhead telepath glared at Annie “Stay back!” She ordered. Annie continued to make her way to Jean “This isn't right. I don't know how they're doing it, but they're tricking you.” Annie said as she held out her hand “Just talk to me.” Jean’s childhood friend said.</p><p>Jean pulled her own hand back “They're not tricking me. You are!” Jean hissed. Annie looked hurt at that “How can you-” but she was interrupted by Jean “Annie Richardson died when we were twelve. The frisbee. The car. I remember it all.”</p><p>Annie smiled “But that's the point, Honey. That doesn't have to be the end. We can make the world whatever we want it to be. You can have everything you want.” Jean’s glare could make hell feel like a day at the beach “I don't want anything.” The redhead stated.</p><p>“Yes, you do!” An all too familiar voice to Jean said “Mom? Dad?” Jean gasped “is this real?” She whispered. Her parents smiled at her “Of course it is!” Her father stayed cheerfully while her mother gave her a kind smile “Anything you want can be real. If you embrace the Phoenix.” Jean froze, realising that this was the Phoenix playing with her “Please, no. Just leave me alone.” The redhead whispered, taking a step away from her parents who each held an arm out to her “Jean dear…” her mother said.</p><p>Jean began to cry “Please! I can't take this…” she sobbed into her hands. Jean heard someone move closer to her and took her head out of her hands “Stop…” she ordered and noticed that everyone from her family was there “Sweetie, the Phoenix is the spirit of Death and Rebirth. What could be more beautiful…?” Her father tried to reason “…Than getting to save all of the people you lost? You could do that.” Her mother finished.</p><p>Jean looked at everyone with a horrified expression “No. All of you… did you all die?!” Jean asked looking at her family “You're all dead?!” A woman spoke up “You can save us, Jean. If you just-”</p><p>“NO!” Jean thundered as she used her powers to make the copies of her family disappear.</p><p>Jean turned around to the Phoenix and pointed at it “It's over!” I don't want anymore of your illusions. You have nothing left to offer me! You hear me?! NOTHING!” Jean roared at the Bird. But the Phoenix wasn't having it so it used the last trick up its sleeve “Jean?” The redhead froze and turned around “Scott…”</p><p>Out from the dust, the original Scott Summers who had died from a plague “Jean, what's happening?” Scott asked as Jean grit her teeth “I said Enough!” And she sent Scott flying across the ground.</p><p>Scott groaned as Jean looked through his mind “Not how I imagined this going after all this time.” The former x man groaned as Jean gasped “Oh God! You're real. Oh Scott… your memories. You got sick. You died” Jean said as she helped him up “I remember.” Cyclops said.</p><p>“I wasn't here to protect you. I couldn't-” Scott placed his hand on her shoulder “You died too, Jean. You know that right?” Scott smiled at Jean “And now here we are. We're…” “Alive” Jean finished.</p><p>Scott looked at his wife “I didn't think I'd ever see you again.” Scott whispered. “Take off your visor” Jean ordered. Scott looked confused “I can't” Jean smiled “Trust me.” She whispered.</p><p>Scott hesitated for a moment before taking off the visor but kept his eyes closed “Open your eyes Scott. Nothing will happen.” Jean informed. Scott's eyes glowed for a moment before dimming “I missed you so much.” Scott said. Jean smiled “I missed you too. The two kissed.</p><p>After a moment, the two stopped “I'm sorry, Jean. For everything. For what happened to you. What happened to us. I'm-” Jean placed her finger on Scotts lips “I'm sorry Scott.” Jean apologised “It's not supposed to be like this. I can't let-” Jean whispered as she and Scott hugged “I know.”</p><p>Jean leaned into Scott’s ear “We were better off dead.” Scott sighed “I'll always love you, Jean Grey.” Cyclops whispered “I'll always love you too, Scott Summers.”</p><p>Scott gasped as he began to age and once again died. Jean gently placed her now deceased husband on the ground, before turning to the Phoenix “Tell me… is that it?!” She demanded to know as the Bird screeched. Jean held out her hand as the Phoenix landed “I know what was meant to hurt me… but I got to see my husband one last time. And that was what I wanted” she said as she rubbed the beak of the firebird.</p><p>“I'm done now. With all of this. I won't play God with you anymore.” The Phoenix actually looked saddened by her words “And I won't let you hurt me or anyone I love again. All of this- hurting people. Playing with their lives. Building fake worlds-it's not right. It's not fair to that to me or anyone.” Jean sighed “Now I don't feel anything anymore.”</p><p>The Phoenix stood in front of Jean “I was supposed to die on that shuttle all those years ago. I know that now. But you keep bringing me back. You want me to be something I'm not. Something I'll never be. And I wanted things from you. Things no person should have.” The Phoenix stared the redhead telepath “I don't know what you are, what your role in the universe is, but it's not here. It's not with me.”</p><p>The Phoenix transformed Jean into her Dark Phoenix form “Don’t you understand, Jean Grey? Together we can be Gods.”</p><p>This time, her White Phoenix of the crown form “Then we can transcend this place.”</p><p>Jean's Marvel girl costume “Or hide together.”</p><p>Jeans first Marvel Girl costume “Or we can become your best self. Or we can simply go back to the way things were before any of this. We can forget any of this happened.” The bird sounded upset.</p><p>Jean sighed once more “You don't understand. That's not how things are supposed to work. You're trying to protect me from these things, but you can't. I'm supposed to feel pain. I'm supposed to know loss. And I need to be able to do it on my own.!” Jean said as she took off and dropped her Marvel Girl mask.</p><p>“You'll die without me, Jean Grey. The people you love will die.” The Phoenix said as it tilted its head as Jean gave a sad smile “I know. And I'll regret not being able to save them every day of my life… but that's my journey. That's life. You're trying to save me from being alive” the illusion of the X mansion began to fade “I don't want to die, but I need to be allowed to live.”</p><p>Jean held out we hand to the Phoenix “And you need to move on without me. I can't be what you wanted me to be. Maybe I never could.” Jean closed her eyes “You need to forget that I ever existed” Jean told the bird and let out a surprised sound as the Phoenix began to shrink and landed on her hands “Goodbye, Jean Grey.” The Phoenix whispered. Jean gave a sad smile “Goodbye” and with that, the flame of the Phoenix disappeared from Jean Grey.</p><p>Jean began to cry as she fell to her knees next to Scott “Welcome home, Jean.” Hank said, placing a hand on her back as Logan, Kitty, Ororo and Bobby looked at her.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a place outside of reality.<br/>A tall, blonde woman was sitting at a desk, filling out some paperwork her sister left for her. This woman was Lady Fate and she was annoyed and had a headache which worsened when one of her sisters entered her office, looking very smug “Death? Why are you so smug? What? did Thanos actually propose or something?” The woman asked, glancing at Lady Death.</p><p>Lady Death rolled her eyes at Fate “Another time sister. I have some very good news… well good for me.” Fate raised an eyebrow at the raven haired woman “What happened?” Fate asked as she put down her pen. Death sat down in a chair “Jean Grey of earth 616 has cut ties with the Phoenix.” Fate blinked “I'm sorry, I could've sworn you said that the Phoenix isn't with Jean Grey.”</p><p>Death smirked as she made herself a cup of tea “That, dear sister, is exactly what I said. Speaking of which.” A flash of golden light shone in the office and the Phoenix stood there. Death raised the cup of tea “Hello dear, welcome home.” The Phoenix bowed respectfully to the two beings “My lady.”</p><p>“Phoenix, what is this I'm hearing that Jean Grey and you have cut ties with each other?” Fate asked with a raised eyebrow. The bird squirmed under her gaze “She was tired of coming back to life and playing god…” the Phoenix said. Fate inhaled sharply before placing her head in her hands and let out a groan of frustration. Death smirked as an idea came to mind “Oh dear sister of mine?” Fate made a sound of acknowledgement “I think I know what to do with Phoenix.” Said Bird turned to Death “What’s your idea Death?” Came Fate’s voice. Death smirked.</p><p>In another universe<br/>Phoenix found itself in an universe so similar to the one it had just left. Flying high above the skies of the United Kingdom, the bird looked around until it found its destination, Surrey. Specifically number 4 privet drive. The home of Lady Death’s chosen heir.</p><p>Phoenix made its way to the house and even to admit that the houses weirded the bird out. Coming up on the home of Death’s heir, Phoenix found that there was powerful wards surrounding the house. While these wards were strong, they couldn't keep out Phoenix who passed through them with ease.</p><p>The house was quiet, meaning that the owners were out or asleep.</p><p>The Firebird quietly made its way through the house listening for anything. A very faint whimper could be heard by Phoenix so the bird made its way to a small cupboard under the stairs. The Phoenix fazed through the small door and made a surprised sound “Lady Death said that the abuse was bad… I didn't think it would've been this bad…” Phoenix whispered to itself as it used its wing to brush some of the hair away from the sleeping child's face.</p><p>The Phoenix closed its eyes and began to glow, as did the young child “Young Harry Potter, Heir of Lady Death. Have no fear, for I am the Phoenix. I will be here to protect you” the Phoenix spoke as it began to fade into Harry, his untamed Raven black hair began to straighten, his recent wounds began to heal.</p><p>Once the transfer had completed, Young Harry shot up in the dirty mattress with a gasp. He looked down at his legs and saw the a small pendant in the shape of a Bird, was lying there.</p><p>Back with Death and Fate<br/>The two sisters looked through the mirror “Are you sure that this is what you want, Death?” Fate asked as the mirror faded back to their reflections. Death nodded “Yes, in positive that this will work. He will have need all the help he will need to fight the battle…”</p><p>Fate and Death sat down at the formers desk with cups of tea and coffee “So… You gonna tell the others?” Death rolled her eyes at her sisters question “I will later. For now, we wait.”</p>
