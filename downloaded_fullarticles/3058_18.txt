    <p>Wanker.</p>
<p>Wankers, actually. Males in general were wankers.</p>
<p>Your ex, now, he was an enormous, cheating wanker. And he was at the same party as you with his new girlfriend.</p>
<p>The Homewrecker.</p>
<p>Alright, homewrecker might be a bit dramatic as you were only dating for a few months and really weren’t all that into him. It was the principle of the matter. He was your boyfriend. She was aware of this. Therefore, ergo, i.e. they were both horrible people.</p>
<p>And they must not know that you were at the party with your girlfriends. The humiliation would be unbearable.</p>
<p>The only solution: the next decent looking male who arrived at the party in the Hufflepuff common room without a date was going to pretend to be your date. You just needed to, well, let him know.</p>
<p>Why was this your life?</p>
<p>You made your way over to the entrance and kept your eyes peeled for an acceptable male human. Hell, human optional at this point. Bring on the Vampires.</p>
<p>You saw movement at the entryway and oh Merlin, really? Well…as they say, here goes nothing.</p>
<p>Your threw your arms around Sirius’ neck and planted a kiss on his lips. Being the suave gentleman about town that he was, he rolled with it, but his eyes held a question.</p>
<p>“Please, Sirius, tell me you don’t have a date?”</p>
<p>“Ah do you count?” he said, looking pleased. He had no idea why, but you apparently needed the appearance of a significant other, and Sirius had been wanting to appear as your boyfriend for a while now. He wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth.</p>
<p>“Yes! Thank you thank you thank you,” you said, hugging him again.</p>
<p>“Well, far be it from me to deny a pretty girl my company for an evening. Care to dance, love?”</p>
<p>You smiled brightly and said, “Oh, Sirius, you’re such an arrogant arse. Normally I’d love to slap that satisfied look off your face but I need you to be pretty and grope me a bit, so live it up!”</p>
<p>You and Sirius had been involved in a flirt/snark relationship for a few years. He was a friend, though not a close one. He was a bit of a philanderer but he wasn’t a cheat, so he was several steps above the ex already.</p>
<p>“Ahhhhh I think I see,” he said as you made your way to the dance floor. Speaking into your ear to be heard over the music, “Your ex and his new girlfriend are here and you need to show him that you can catch the best looking bloke in school, eh?”</p>
<p>“I mean…you were just the first available guy. But you’ll do,” you told him with a wink.</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon, Madam, but I will more than do. I will be the best fake boyfriend for an evening there ever was!” he said as he pulled you closer and began to kiss your neck.</p>
<p>“Is he looking or something?” you asked Sirius, winding your fingers into his hair. You had wanted him to put on a show, after all.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, I have no idea,” he said against your ear before he began nibbling the lobe.</p>
<p>“Why are you kissing my neck if he isn’t looking?” you asked irritably, pulling back to look him in the eye.</p>
<p>“Love, your neck is very kissable. I think you’ll find mine is, too. Have a taste,” he said with a wink and a tip of his head to the side.</p>
<p>Just then it occurred to you how handsome Sirius really was. He wanted to kiss a bit, so what was the harm? You leaned forward and kissed his neck just below his ear, bit his neck lightly. Encouraged by Sirius’ deep, heartfelt moan,  you flicked your tongue out to trail down to his pulse, felt it flutter a bit, then licked across his Adam’s apple and up to his other ear. “I see what you mean,” you said, then lightly bit his earlobe as he had yours.</p>
<p>Sirius placed his hands on the sides of your face and kissed you, biting your lip gently until you welcomed his tongue. All pretense of dancing had been abandoned and you kissed him hungrily until another couple who were actually dancing bumped into you.</p>
<p>You broke apart, both in a bit of a daze. Sirius took you by the hand and led you to the entrance, going away from the noise and press of the party. You moved down the hall a ways past where other couples had stepped away to have a bit of quiet and semi-privacy.</p>
<p>Sirius leaned against the wall and pulled you against him until you were resting between his legs and against his chest.</p>
<p>“You have me here,” you said, wiggling your eyebrows. “Now what are you going to do with me?”</p>
<p>“Well,” he drawled. “We’re a bit too public for what I’d really like to do. And I think we’re a bit too private for what you wanted. Meet in the middle and snog bit? Maybe I get the odd fondle in before you slap me?”</p>
<p>You rested your chin against his chest and looked as if you were really pondering his suggestion. “What if we snog a bit and then go back inside and make sure my ex sees us together?”</p>
<p>“What if we snog a bit here, go back inside and snog some more so he’s absolutely certain to see us, then I take you to Hogsmeade tomorrow and we snog some there, too?”</p>
<p>“Sirius Black, are you asking me out?”</p>
<p>“I believe I am, love,” he said with that sexy smirk of his.</p>
<p>“Hmmm. This does put me at a bit of a disadvantage.”</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>“Because if I say no then I would be ungrateful for the,” you slid your hands up his chest and pressed closer to him, brushing your lips against his as you completed your sentence, “great sacrifice you’ve made for me this evening.”</p>
<p>Sirius groaned as you made contact with his groin while you pressed yourself closer to him. He started kissing you hungrily. “No sacrifice here, darling,” he said in between ravenous kisses. “Don’t feel obligated.”</p>
<p>You arched your back and rubbed against his hardening length and he flipped you so you were pressed to the wall and he was pressing against you.</p>
<p>“Hmmm well if you’re certain I’m under no obligation,” you said as you unbuttoned a couple buttons on his shirt and kissed his chest, “then I would love to go to Hogsmeade with you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Excellent. So glad that wanker cheated on you. Been wanting to ask you out for a while now. So much easier since you got the ball rolling, ya might say.”</p>
<p>“Y’know, I do believe I’m glad that wanker cheated on me, too,” you said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Wanna go back in and show him what he’s missing?” Sirius asked, attempting to cool down a bit so he didn’t have to walk around with a visible hard-on.</p>
<p>“Actually, I think I’d like to stay out here and find out more about what I found instead of showing him what he lost.”</p>
<p>Sirius smiled, not his sarcastic grin or sexy smirk, but a genuine happy smile. “I like that idea.”</p>
