    <p>Harry's lungs were on fire, burning and aching. This wasn't new of course because he was often sick how could he not be with the way he was treated by his Aunt, Uncle and Cousin? He tried to draw another shaky breath as his body shook and pain engulfed him he wondered if he was really going to die this time. He hurt so bad. </p>
<p>Harry Potter was nine years old but his body was no bigger than a four year olds. He was vastly underweight and you could see his ribs when his oversized shirt was removed. He had messy black hair that was coarse to the touch. He had bright green eyes that often unnerved those around him when he looked at them. His skin was pale though you couldn't tell because he'd never had a bath before or if he had he couldn't remember. </p>
<p>He was startled when the door to his cupboard opened and he could hear a scream. The scream must've been loud if he could hear it. He blinked up at the woman wearing robes as she was pushed out of the way and a man in black robes knelt down and pointed a stick of wood at Harry. Harry felt a tingle of something wash over him and then another there was intense pain then he could breathe much easier. He raised shaking arms to the man hoping that the man would pick him up and take him away. The man put his stick away and picked him up cuddling him close to his chest. Harry clung to the front of his robes and snuggled as close as he could get to that warmth. </p>
<p>Severus frowned at the child in his arms. Harry Potter was supposed to be nine years old not four. Why was he so small? Dumbledore had a lot to answer for. He walked out to the living room to Lucius and the Aurors. Lucius had been fighting for custody of Harry for years and the Aurors had gotten an abuse complaint for Harry. How Lucius had convinced the Aurors to bring him along was lost on Severus and was even more lost on what he, Severus, himself was doing here. </p>
<p>"He needs intense Healing." Severus reported. He looked behind at the tapping on his shoulder. The female Auror who screamed was holding out a blue baby blanket. Severus took it and wrapped it tightly around Harry. The boy was shaking like a leaf in his arms. He put warming charms on the blanket and they all heard Harry sigh in relief and snuggle even closer. "It's okay, Harry, I'm here I wont let them hurt you anymore." </p>
<p>"Severus?" A voice he knew well asked. He looked up from the boy to the couch and there sat Petunia Evans covered in bruises clutching at her huge son who looked unharmed. "Severus Snape? It's ....." </p>
<p>"I could hardly not remember you, Tuny." Severus drawled. The woman nodded. His eyes trailed to the whale of a husband who looked to be silenced and bound his face purple. "Did you hurt him, Tuny?" Severus looked at her again. "Did. You. Hurt. Him.?" </p>
<p>"No." she said, in a shaking voice. "I tired to help him. I tried to sneak him food and help him with chores. I tried to help him with everything but Vernon....." she took a sobbing breath. "I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It was Harry or Dudley..... I had to protect my son but I tried.......I tried." </p>
<p>Severus grabbed her chin forcing her to look him in the eye then smashed into her mind. </p>
<p>"That isn't legal." An Auror grunted. </p>
<p>"I didn't see a thing." The Auror in charge replied, arms crossed over his chest looking away. </p>
<p>The other three Aurors quickly faced the opposite direction as well. Taking their cue from their leader. They really had no objections against using Mind Arts on the Muggles and  the Potion's Master really seemed to care which shocked them all. </p>
<p>"Okay." Severus said, coming back to himself leaving Petunia rubbing her head. He backed away and looked at the Aurors who were now looking at him. "She's telling the truth. Though I hate to admit it. Also her brat has magic." </p>
<p>Vernon broke the silencing charm.</p>
<p>"MY SON IS NOT A FREAK!" he bellowed. </p>
<p>Four Silencing Charms hit him in the chest. </p>
<p>"That's the fourth time he's broken that Charm." The Auror in charge growled. "Strong will for a muggle." He looked at Lucius Malfoy. " Take the kid I'll explain and start the paperwork. I'll inform you of anything concerning the family as they come." </p>
<p>"Thank you." Lucius smiled. "Come, Severus let's get Harry to a safe place and get him help."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Harry woke in a soft, warm bed wearing sleeping shorts that actually fit him. He yawned cutely and found that his baby blanket was by his side clutched tightly in his right hand just the way he always slept. He also noted that he wasn't in pain anymore. He sat up and looked around. The room was grand and very large. The bed was a toddler bed that would easily fit ten kids Harry's size and he was in the very center. His sheets were a deep green silk that he found that he liked very much. His comforter matched. He blinked as the door opened and the man in black came in followed by a man with long platinum blond hair and a man with ruby red eyes. Harry instantly focused on the man in black and held his arms up. He wanted the man to hold him again. </p>
<p>Severus let a small smile slip on to his face and scooped the boy up into his arms holding him and cuddling him. </p>
<p>"Hello, Harry." He said, softly. "My name is Severus. " Harry blinked big killing curse green eyes up at him and nodded. "This man here is Lucius." The blond smiled and messed up Harry's hair before kissing it. "and this is Tom." The ruby eyed man kissed the back of Harry's hand. "We're going to be taking care of you from now on." Harry looked back at his man in black. His Sev and cocked his head to the side. "We wont hurt you don't worry. Now we need to give you a bath. Don't worry it wont hurt, little imp." </p>
<p>Harry soon found himself in a very large bath that sat all four of them and there was still more room. The adults were wearing swim shorts but Harry was naked and was getting washed by Sev. Sev was very gentle and explained that the soap he was using was brewed by himself and that it was perfect for baby skin.</p>
<p>"Not that I think you're a baby because you're not." Severus said, quickly making Tom and Lucius chuckle he glared at them. "I'm just saying that your skin might be sensitive and that this soap wont hurt you." Harry nodded he was liking his bath. The water had turned black several times over but had always emptied and refilled with clean water. "I also brewed shampoo and conditioner like this for your hair and after this you'll get to eat okay? You'll have to take some potions and they wont taste good but they will help you get big and strong. I'm afraid you'll have to take them for a long time but they will help you get healthy."</p>
<p>"After you're done with that you can play for awhile." Lucius said, "We've got you plenty of toys." </p>
<p>Harry was shocked. These people were being so nice to him. They were washing him and had said they'd healed him so he wouldn't be in pain anymore. They were going to feed him and give him Potions to make him better plus they were giving him toys to play with? What the heck was going on? He had no idea but he knew one thing he already liked this place. He liked it very much.</p>
<p>After his body was clean of years of dirt and filth they could see the bruises and scars and they had to hold back their anger and fight not to show it to the scared child who was now getting his hair washed. They'd all noted that Harry never made a sound but was clearly enjoying having his hair washed. </p>
<p>When Harry's hair was finally clean they all got out of the bath and dried off and dressed. Harry was told that they had bought him clothes as well. He got his teeth brushed and tried to help as he'd seen Dudley do it before. After that he snuggled into Sev's arms and was carried to a small couch in front of a fire place. The men sat on the floor putting Harry on the couch. A table was in front of Harry and food appeared on it. Harry suffered through taking the Potions then he began eating the food cautiously when he wasn't punished he happily. </p>
<p>When he was done the plates vanished he held his arms out to Sev again and was picked up and snuggled. Harry was soon fast asleep again. </p>
<p>The men chuckled and tucked him into bed. </p>
<p>"He's so adorable." Lucius said, as they tucked him in. "I do hope that he likes this play house. I thought it might be his safe place." </p>
<p>"It was a great idea." Tom comforted the man, as he tucked Harry into bed and kissed his forehead. There was now no scar as Tom had realized his mistake and reabsorbed the soul inside Harry and Severus had healed the scar. "How will you keep Draco out?" </p>
<p>"Wards." Lucius deadpanned. "I will not have Draco scaring Harry by forcing his friendship on him or over whelming him." </p>
<p>Severus ran a few scans and continued his healing drawing on all of his magic. He could tell that caring for Harry was going to take it's toll on his magic pushing him to his limits in the next few months he sighed to himself. He really did need to get back to the school. He knew Dumbledore was going to question him missing his classes today but when Lucius had called he hadn't been able to refuse. He'd been pissed when he'd first figured out that they were going to see Harry Potter of all people but once he'd seen the boy he'd known everything he'd been told about the boy was a lie. </p>
<p>"May Mother Magic punish all involved in hurting this boy." Severus breathed, pushing Harry's bangs back and kissing his forehead. "Sleep well, Harry Potter."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Magic heard Severus' words and began her work. She'd wanted a shot at Dumbledore for a long time now and now she would have it. She picked and chose who she wanted and made them appear in the Hogwarts Great Hall. There was Chaos and she revealed in it readying to make her announcement. </p>
<p>Tom was shocked to be standing in the Hogwarts Great Hall with Lucius and Severus the playhouse next to them. Harry was suddenly in his arm still asleep. </p>
<p><i>I am Mother Magic and I have been called upon to dole out justice for the Maltreatment of one Harry Potter.</i> </p>
<p>Everyone watched the child in Tom's arms glow. </p>
<p>
  <i>Everyone hear must learn the truth of the lies and manipulation you have all been under for years. Most of what you think you know is lies. You will not be able to hurt each other while you are stuck here and none will be able to leave Hogwarts grounds except for the third through seventh years. I am monitoring everything. Harry Potter must remain with either Thomas Marvolo Riddle II, Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, or Severus Tobias Snape at all times if he is not in his playhouse. So that I have said it. So mote it be.</i>
</p>
<p>Silence met her words.</p>
