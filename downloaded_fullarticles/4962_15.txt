    <p>Something was wrong.</p><p>Well…not wrong but different.</p><p>You and Dean can both feel it.</p><p>Dean chose to ignore it but you...</p><p>You were skeptical on how Dean was acting.</p><p>
  <em>Dean is an alpha.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Along with Sam. Along with your father, Bobby Singer, Dean and Sam are the only alphas you seem to tolerate. They were not annoying like some. Though Dean could be on a good day.</em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <em>You being an omega, you have to keep your guard up around alphas. They take what they want without permission and then you are stuck with them forever. You always hated being an omega since you were twelve years old. You didn’t really care for it as a child, but as you got older and hit puberty you noticed the change in you and how other alphas acted around you. They didn’t give much respect to you and they would creep around you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sam and Dean were different. Sam being younger by a few years, hasn’t really noticed that you are a hormonal teenage omega. But with Dean, a horny hormonal teenage alpha…</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You didn’t mind him around at all.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Maybe it was because you knew him since he was eight years old when John would drop them off at Bobby’s. You had your first kiss with him at thirteen. You gave him your virginity at eighteen right before you left for college.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dean was pretty pissed at you for leaving him for college which struck a chord with you. You found out later that it wasn’t because you left the hunting job. It was because college was full of douche bag horny alphas who are more reckless than when they were in high school. Your father taught you a lot on how to deal with alphas.  Even the Winchesters gave you pointers.<br/>You could remember the day when you were at a party at a frat house.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> It's stuffed full of people so you thought you didn’t have to worry about any alphas. So you wore a nice summer dress and was careless about your lingering scent around a bunch of drunk alphas. Many of them tried to hit on you, but you blatantly </em>
  <em>turned them down.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>They circled around you like prey. It is not a secret that omegas are rare. That most women are betas and there is an unlikely chance of omegas being born. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>As she was turning down another guy before going back to her friend, she could sense that familiar scent. Her eyes snapped up towards the entrance to see 19-year-old Dean Winchester locking eyes with her. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He had an aura around him that she never noticed before. She was happy to see him either way. She pushed past the guys and went up to her friend. She didn’t hug him because…well…she didn’t want to scare him away that she was happy to see him. She hasn’t seen him in months.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dean grabbed her by the arm and hauled her out of there.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Let’s say that night ended with Dean having many claiming scratches on his back.  Dean’s hand prints on her body along with his scent that will linger on her for a few weeks. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dean always had a soft spot for you. He didn’t know how it started, but he didn’t like it when he was younger. Though Dean was hardly in school, when he was, he couldn’t help himself from keeping an eye on you. He could see how you react around alphas. Omegas are to be submissive and quiet around them, but you are spit fire.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You glared and talked back which ends with Dean fighting your battles then ending with you yelling at him for it. Dean couldn’t help but chuckle at that reaction you had for punching the guy for cornering her. The argument ended with you shyly thanking him and running away afterward. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>That was the most ‘omega’ you have ever been with him. When you don’t meet his eyes, a flush of pink goes across your cheeks, and you biting her bottom lip.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He noticed how your demeanor would change in high school. Puberty hit alphas first. It comes more like a wave of aggression and power. It felt as if he had to dominate something. And that scared the living shit out of Dean because alphas love a challenge and that what you was to them.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So he noticed how you would not wear your normal attire any more that you would wear your father’s, who is an alpha, old flannel shirts to mask your scent.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And he hated that.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>After college, you went back home with your father. You were kind of pissed that Dean didn’t show up to your graduation. You were looking for him in the crowd most of all. You tried not to let it show but Bobby could see right through it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“He had a case,” he said.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Don’t make excuses for him, dad,” you said as you marched upstairs to your old room.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dean was in a case facing god knows what. Some kind of demon that killed happy families or some kind of shit like that. Dean decided to call Bobby but he wasn’t expecting you on the line. He hasn’t talked to you since he saw he you on a date with a beta one day when he was visiting the town for a case. You didn’t know he was there and it hurt that you didn’t know why he hasn’t contacted you for almost a year.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Hello, Y/N Singer speaking,” you say right before yawning from your nap.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There was a long pause.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Hello?” you said.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Um, hey, it’s Dean,” he said.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Huh? Nice to know you are still alive,” you said before turning from the phone to your dad who was reading on the sofa. “Dad, Dean on the phone,” you then went to the phone. “I’m pissed that you didn’t come to see me graduate, asshole.” “So you just gonna up and leave Bobby?” he changed the subject. He wanted to say you were leaving him, but that was too… chick-flick moment for him.<br/>“I got a degree for when I get too damn old for hunting. I won’t always have the ability of a gymnastics prodigy,” she joked. But her voice got serious again. “It’s a backup plan, you ass. Did you take to heart when I left for college? I’m back with dad. And at least </em>
  <em>Sammy came, and I heard about what happened between you guys and…nice to know you might feel the same way about me leaving.” She said before handing the phone to her dad before he could say anything else.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“So you ignore me?” Dean asked her. After the hunt, they went back to Bobby’s. Dean tried to talk to you, but you won’t even look at him. She stayed in her room most of the times or would be off to god knows where. Dean decides what the hell. He went straight to the kitchen to see you eating an apple pie with vanilla ice cream on top. “And then you don’t tell me when you made a pie!” that pissed him off greatly. He loved that you can bake a pie from scratch. That you learned just for him because he loves it homemade.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You rolled your eyes and kept eating. You couldn’t help but smirk because Dean lost his concentration and distracted by the pie in your hand.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“How’s Sammy?” he diverts the conversation. You raised an eyebrow at that.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why don’t you call him? It has been almost a year,” you say to him with menace. “I don’t care that John won’t talk to him but when his big brother who has practically taken care of him don’t call that pisses me off.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well, luckily we don’t care about little omega thinks,” he said. Dean knew that you hated to be called that like it is an insult to what you is since you have no control over it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yeah…I know,” your voice now low making Dean feel bad for calling you that. “You can have the pie,” she said slamming it on the counter and pushing pass him which you didn’t succeed since Dean grabs you and corners you on the fridge.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His hazel green eyes locked on yours. “Look, I didn’t mean to say that. It… is just… Sammy just up and left us. Left me… with him. And I can’t forgive that so easily,” he said. You find it damn hard to stay mad at Dean. Especially when he looks at you with those damn eyes that clench your heart. You bite your lip and nodded, showing that you forgive him. He smirks and loosens his grip on you a bit before leaning into your lips. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>You can’t deny Dean so easily. You can’t deny him at all. You easily gave him entrance into your mouth. Your hands glided through his short hair then went to his face. Your thumb tracing over his freckled cheeks. Dean’s hands wandered as well. His rough hands went from your hips to your ass which made you squeak a bit when he had a grip on them and picked you up so that your legs wrapped around him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I missed this,” he admits before attacking your lips again. He grinds into you causing you to moan into his mouth. Dean noticed the spike in your scent. He could smell the arousal laced into your omega scent. He should have been worried since there were two other alphas in the house (one being her dad, Bobby) who will smell it as easily as he can.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And they did.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Wha—damn, idjits, right in the damn kitchen!” Bobby walks in on them and smacks Dean across the head.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>You were at your dad’s when you got the call about the Winchesters being in the hospital. Sam called you and instantly drove out there. And when you saw Dean in a coma, your heart easily broke at the sight. You cried at the sight that Sam had to hold you up because you almost collapsed on the ground. You didn’t know that his ‘spirit’ saw how you reacted. How you cried over his unconscious body and stared at him lovingly. Luckily, he didn’t remember. Sam was the only that knew that your feelings for Dean weren't just platonic.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>When Dean went to hell, you didn’t know how to react. You couldn’t eat. You couldn’t sleep. You couldn’t get the sight of Dean being mauled by the hellhounds out of your head. It has been four months of torture. You haven’t contacted your father in nearly two months. You haven’t seen Sam in three months.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So when she nearly died in the middle of the road because she fell asleep at the wheel and a truck rammed into her. She felt like she was getting a well-deserved sleep. So when you woke up to the sound of ‘beep… beep… beep… beep….’ You knew you were in the hospital. The comfy bed, white walls, and the smell. You turned your head and saw that your dad was glaring at you by the door frame. His arms crossed and he didn’t say a word. You didn’t either. You turned your head back so that you were looking at the ceiling.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Idjit,” he mumbled before leaving.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dean and Sam came by two minutes later. Sam was the first to run up to you. His puppy brown eyes watered at the sight of you. You can see all the guilt for leaving you alone those four months in those sad eyes that you forgive him easily. You cracked a smile and lifted your casted arm and ran your stiff fingers over his cheek. “It’s been a while, Sammy.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It took a minute to notice the ghost by the door that was staring at you like a stranger. Dean…your eyes widened but you didn’t let yourself cry. “Dean?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dean didn’t know how to respond when he saw you in that hospital bed. It has only been four months but he noticed the change in you. He saw that you lost weight. That you haven’t had much sleep. Dean finally walked towards you and he reached for you an uninjured hand.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Idiot,” he whispered. Sam told him how you was when he died. How for that one month that Sam took care of you because you hardly took care of yourself. And scared the shit of Dean when he came back to Bobby when he said he hasn’t seen his daughter in nearly three months.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Dean knew what was wrong now. They both was alone in the motel bedroom with you right under him as he played with the hem of your shirt. You just stared up at him skeptically wondering what was wrong.</p><p>Dean had a talk with Bobby two weeks ago about you. It was the talk that he been stalling since Bobby figured you two was frolicking since high school.</p><p>
  <em>“When you gonna claim Y/N?” He finally asked Dean. Dean looked aghast at Bobby for bringing it up. “Don’t look at me like that, kid. You and Y/N had been on some damn rollercoaster for fifteen years.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Just casual.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No, it's not. Not anymore, that is,” Bobby said. “Look, John maybe didn’t want you to quit the haunting’ but with me and my little girl… I don’t want her to be in this life for the rest of her life, you get me?” he waited for Dean to nod. “I do want grandkids soon and if you are not gonna claim anytime soon… Y/N won’t be waiting forever. It’s different with omegas. She might n to admit it, but somewhere in her, she wants to have an official claiming. She’s in her early thirties and she needs to settle down with someone she trusts. And she doesn’t trust alphas so easily.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“What’s wrong?” you asked him.</p><p>“Why me?” he finally asked you. You furrowed your eyebrows together. “I mean…it’s been fifteen years of this and you never tried to find a mate to claim you all this time,” he said. “I know you and you are gonna want the apple pie life sooner than later.”</p><p>Your right hand then slipped over his shoulder than cupping his cheek. His green eyes staring into your soul. “Because you are Dean Winchester.” You said it like it was obvious. He scoffs at that. “You and Sam are the only alphas I trust. I am not saying what you think I am saying but I like being with you.”</p><p>“Because you had many firsts with me?” he would just ruin the moment with that.</p><p>“That helped,” you shrugged. “What? Do you not want this…whatever this is?” you said. “It is not like I am holding you back. I am…<em>aware and okay</em> with you…and your one night stands.” He saw right through that lie. But he had to give you credit. You never gave him an ultimatum with them. Which made him feel worse about bringing a girl home with you there.</p><p>“Well…that’s the problem, Y/N,” he said. “I don’t want what this is,” he finally said. His green eyes then glanced at your bare neck that was waiting for the right alpha to put their claiming marks on it.</p><p>You seemed to get the wrong ideas in his words.</p><p>“I…meant…maybe…dammit,” Dean’s face was now flushed. “Maybe I am ready to settle, ya know? Claiming and all that…if you want that?” he said. You now knew what he was saying. You couldn’t help but grin. “I can see you being the perfect addition to the Winchester family,” he was now smug self.</p><p>“God, I’ve been waiting for you to say that for ten years,” you said as you pressed your lips against his. “Had to endure a lot of your bullshit but you are lucky I love you,” you said.</p><p>His smiled widened. “You are lucky I like sassy women…and you can cook a mean pie,” his lips then went to your neck causing you to shiver. “Are you okay with this?”</p><p>“Yeah.” You closed your eyes as you felt his callous hands went under your shirt as he began the claiming ritual</p>
