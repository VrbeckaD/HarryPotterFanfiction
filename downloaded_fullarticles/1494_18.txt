    <p>The great castle seemed rather alarming now she came to think about truly going.</p><p>As she sat in the back of an old run down car with her older brother Anna felt her heart pounding louder and louder in her chest.</p><p>"Relax A.."</p><p>She blinked for a moment, a small smile going over her face as she heard Remus's voice. She was relaxed by it. He always seemed to have a way of speaking that would calm anyone's nerves almost at once.</p><p>“Like you were any different.”</p><p>A small smirk went over both sibling’s at her comment.</p><p>“You’ll do great kid.” </p><p>A small half smile went over her face as she heard her father’s words.</p><p>She didn't have a mother, she had been killed years ago by a werewolf and honestly she should hate them but she could not. Her brother had been turned by one when he was still quite young. She absentmindedly ran her fingers over his scar for a moment or two before gently pressing a kiss to it.</p><p>"Will your friends be on the train?"</p><p>She had met them all a few times before now, Remus had invited them over a few times during the holidays and she found them lovely.</p><p>"Yes." Remus answered, nodding, glad his sister loved his friends almost as much as he did. "I believe Sirius will be glad to see you again." He nudged her playfully and she turned a deep shade of red.</p><p>"I have no idea what you're on about." She flushed, punching him in the shoulder hard.</p><p>"Enough you two, behave."</p><p>The siblings laughed for a moment before Anna leaned her head on her older brother's shoulder, just looking out of the window until the car came to a full stop. King's Cross Station.</p><p>She knew the way to get to the platform but she couldn't help feeling more and more scared about it by the second. What if something went wrong? Remus had promised to help her through it during the time so she wasn't completely freaking out but still.. running at a wall seemed terrifying.</p><p>Yet the time crept on and on until they were facing it.</p><p>"Ready?"</p><p>"As ready as I'll ever be..." </p><p>She bit her lip, holding her trolley tightly in her hands before breaking into a run and closing her eyes, stopping the second she felt a whoosh..it had worked.. now she could see the train..</p><p>The Hogwarts Express.</p>
