Sport</p><p align="center">*</p><p>Madam Pomfrey doesn't often get <em>Fred Weasley</em> himself in her infirmary — rather she receives his classmates who are subject to his pranks.</p><p><em>Foul play, I'm afraid</em>, Madam Hooch informs her privately, those yellow, hawkish eyes squinting in obvious displeasure. Regarding the cheers and multitude of screams outside Hogwarts, Pomfrey assumed a serious Quidditch injury.</p><p>Several of the older Ravenclaw players are rounded up, trudging over to Dumbledore's office with guilty and colorless, baffled expressions.</p><p>"His ear can be repaired, and the hearing loss should be only temporary," Pomfrey speaks to McGonagall who sighs out in tremendous relief and presses a hand over her bosom.</p><p>Charlie Weasley has been patiently waiting outside of the hospital wing, but as soon as Fred wakes up, <em>George Weasley</em> appears out of nowhere, storming in right for his brother. Pomfrey was not aware George <em>knew</em> which part of the hospital wing Fred had been taken.</p><p>"You're a <em>STUPID</em> blighter, you know that?" he yells down at Fred who startles. "Nearly getting yourself <em>KILLED</em> for me! What were you thinking—"</p><p>A flash of cheeky, brilliantly warm grin. Fred turns the bandaged side of his head to his twin, mocking a 'cupping' hand motion around an invisible ear, as if asking him to speak louder.</p><p>George's lips tremble. He bursts out laughing, falling down next to Fred and hugging him tightly.</p><p>Pomfrey steps away, behind the curtain, and looks away as Fred teases his brother good-naturedly, petting George's red hair and burying his face in.</p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p></div>
