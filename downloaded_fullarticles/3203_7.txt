    <p>Remus Lupin has wanted this job for as long as he can remember, and he’ll be damned if he does anything less than excellent work.</p><p>Yes, he would be ecstatic about any full-time employment in the wizarding world, especially one with a nice enough salary to enable him to buy name-brand snacks, but this job is something he’d never dared to hope for, a secret dream come reality.</p><p>Once Dumbledore hired him, he began reading the latest DADA material in his every spare moment (of which he had many, now that a salary was in his future). He spent an entire day going from Muggle thrift shop to Muggle thrift shop looking for suitable professional wear (and then spent the entire next day charming it to fit and hold together as nicely as possible). He owled every Head of House for a list of their students and asked if any of them require special attention or accommodations (he even owled Snape, the greasy tool, though he hasn’t yet received a response and doesn’t expect to).</p><p>Now, he’s studying the lists and praying that he’s retained his uncanny cramming ability from his Hogwarts days. Charmed flashcards challenge him: Seamus Finnegan?</p><p>“Gryffindor, third year, proclivity for combustive magic,” Remus says, and the text on the card turns green as the card flies itself into his “mastered” pile.</p><p>Mathilda Garrick?</p><p>“Ravenclaw, second year, almost bright enough to counteract her severe anger issues.”</p><p>Luna Lovegood?</p><p>“Second year, Ravenclaw, and… unique,” Remus says, because Flitwick wrote Luna her own paragraph and Remus’s flashcard charm is really only meant for a sentence or two at a time. He’s actually very excited to teach the second year Ravenclaws because of her, as Flitwick mentioned that while she seems wholly disinterested in defensive magic, she’s been bullied by other students and is remarkably bright. Hopefully, he’ll be able to interest her in a defensive spell or two- if she’s going to be an odd duck in the wizarding world, she ought to learn to protect herself. Maybe she’ll like <em> Waddiwasi </em> or the Bat-Bogey Hex? He probably shouldn’t be teaching second years any hexes, but he doubts Dumbledore will mind.</p><p>George Weasley?</p><p>“Gryffindor, fifth year, notorious prankster and twin to Fred Weasley.”</p><p>Cedric Diggory?</p><p>“Hufflepuff, fifth year, very popular with the young ladies,” Remus says, smiling at the fact that Professor Sprout had felt that information was somehow crucial to Remus’s lesson plans for the year.</p><p>Godwin Kirby?</p><p>“Rave-”</p><p>Remus’s alarm begins to scream at him (figuratively- he does most of his shopping in Muggle thrift shops nowadays) and the text on the flashcard turns red, flying itself into his “revise” pile.</p><p>“Damn,” he mutters, scrambling to reach the alarm and stop its blaring without upending the coffee table and splashing his coffee on the carpet. If he saw Remus drinking coffee rather than tea, Sirius would- Remus forces the thought from his mind and punches the OFF button.</p><p>He’ll be subletting the small flat once he leaves for Hogwarts as he has the rotten luck of a lease that lasts until January. Ideally, Remus won’t leave even the slightest issue for the tenant to contact him about. The alarm, one of three he has in the house, is his reminder to start on editing the articles he’s been owled from <em> Witch Weekly </em> . He only works for them occasionally, when their in-house writing and editing staff is overloaded, and this month he’s been told by the editor-in-chief (a Gryffindor in his year who thankfully enjoyed and admired the Marauders’ notoriety) that two witches are on maternity leave and another is in St. Mungo’s for an indefinite period of time, so he’s been sent an article on new magical contraceptives, an interview with controversial romance author Catherine Ashley, and a questionable seven-page guide to incorporating modern Muggle fashion into daily Wizarding wear. The witch in the hospital also happens to be the author of <em> Advice from Auntie Agnes </em>, the weekly column helping witches with everything from unhappy marriages to unexpected children.</p><p>He grabs the stack of papers and brings them over to his lumpy sofa.</p><p>Remus doesn’t know why on Earth the role of Auntie Agnes went to him rather than to one of the witches on the permanent staff. He suspects that it is some kind of revenge on the editor-in-chief’s part for a prank that he no longer remembers.</p><p>
  <em> Ms. Beatrix Harlow, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> If I or one of my late brothers have done anything to offend you, I apologize wholeheartedly and thank you for the honest work you’ve given me. Please, spare me from the horrors of the advice column. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Yours truly, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Remus J. Lupin </em>
</p><p>Disappointingly, the role was given to him far too close to publication time for Remus to feel comfortable begging off and leaving someone else in the lurch, so here he is holding five letters from witches in need of assistance. He is supposed to compose replies to three of the five letters and send them back for Beatrix to choose between; Remus supposes it is rather charitable of her to give him any choice in the matter at all.</p><p>
  <em> Dear Auntie Agnes, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly three years now, and I’ve been dropping hints like crazy, but still no sign of a proposal! </em>
</p><p>Oh, no. Please, dear Merlin, don’t let them all be about romance. Remus tosses this one aside.</p><p>
  <em> Dear Auntie Agnes, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> This may sound odd or unbelievable, but my four-year-old daughter has spent the past month constantly masturbating in public by rubbing herself against chairs, tables, and even our staircase! In addition to this embarrassing act, her accidental magic has been tearing the house apart. </em>
</p><p>So. Romance isn’t looking so bad anymore. Remus does not feel qualified to help with this issue but feels mildly obligated to do so due to the sense of panic he feels emanating from the paper. Blinking, he sets this in a pile to be read in its entirety later if the other letters don’t strike his fancy.</p><p>
  <em> Dear Auntie Agnes, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> For nine years, I was married to the most wonderful wizard in the world, an Auror I loved with all my heart. Two years ago, he was cursed on the job and spent three agonizing months in St. Mungo’s before passing. Recently, my family has been asking when I will start looking for another man. My family is pureblood and my husband was a muggleborn, and they never liked him or treated him like they should have, like family. I am not ready to “look for another man,” nor do I believe I ever will be. If I do ever feel up to dating again, I will certainly not go along with my family’s attempts to set me up with a “respectable” pureblood wizard. How can I communicate to them that I’m not ready and may never be? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sincerely, Mourning Widow</em>
</p><p>This- this, Remus can work with. He might work angrily and have to edit out a few insults to the widow’s family, but he can work with it. He places this letter next to the toddler masturbation letter and continues.</p><p>He eventually chooses to answer the letters from the panicked mother, the widow, and a young girl out on her own after leaving Hogwarts wondering if she’s obligated to keep in contact with her abusive parents. He gets them all done just as his second alarm goes off and he has to head to work.</p><p>Stocking shelves and mopping floors at Tesco is just as mind-numbing as ever until Remus remembers that he’ll be quitting at the end of this shift, and his mind is filled with visions of telling his manager where he can stick that damned extra-long feather duster of his and smashing the wine display so it spills all over the floor. But the tops of the shelves can actually get a bit gross and poor Val who’s five months pregnant would have to clean it all up, so instead he resolves to at least make a rude gesture in the store’s direction when he leaves, and maybe charm the automatic doors to open and close at random for a couple weeks, just so that James and Peter don’t revoke his Marauder membership from the afterlife.</p><p>Quitting is fairly painless. He tells his manager that he’s got some teaching work and is congratulated; he agrees to come back and pick up his last paycheck in a week, the day before he’ll set out from King’s Cross. Val gives him a slightly awkward hug and leaving for what is almost the last time feels no different than leaving has felt every other time he’s clocked out. Riding the bus home feels a bit exciting, and when he arrives at his flat he glances around, pulls out his wand, and unlocks the front door with <em> Alohomora </em> instead of using his key, just because he can. He smiles for Lily, tireless advocate of using magic for silly little things every now and then, just because you can. The others, all pureblood, never quite understood it, how unlocking a door or turning on a light could be exciting.</p><p>Lily knew that magic is just as fun as it is terrifying. She and Remus had a shared belief that a lot of purebloods would be much happier, more well-adjusted people had they grown up without magic or at least in the company of muggles. Remus still holds this belief, though it smacks of irony now for reasons he can’t attempt to put to words without dissolving into tears.</p><p>He collapses into bed for a glorious five hours of sleep. The third alarm, the small pink analogue clock that he got for £2 at a charity shop, <em> BRIIIIIIINGs </em> until he switches it off and begins to trudge towards the shower. The water is cold and probably a bit off due to the old rusted pipes, but his mother had always been insistent that magic could never replace a proper wash and Remus can’t imagine going without. Breakfast is two slices of buttered toast and a slightly mushy banana eaten hurriedly as Remus packs his edited work for <em> Witch Weekly </em> into his briefcase. He still kind of hates everything he wrote and hopes to edit it a bit today before he has to send it all back at six.</p><p>The bus is running late. He considers just Apparating into the alley behind the library, but a few of the local homeless population like to camp there waiting for the library to open, and Remus generally would rather not Obliviate any innocent people if it can be avoided. Just as he resigns himself to apparating into the toilets and pretending to have simply rushed off as soon as he arrived, he hears the telltale screech-and-squeal of a bus climbing its way up his steep road.</p><p>“Oh, thank goodness,” he whispers to himself, disappointed. Climbing aboard the bus feels a bit like climbing into a used casket, but Remus is used to secondhand goods and no longer minds. He uses the twelve minutes aboard to read over his reply to the abused girl.</p><p>
  <em> Dear Wondering, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> First and foremost you must do what is best for yourself and your health. As a young witch on her own for the first time, continuing to interact with your parents may cause you distress which could then hinder you as you make your way in the world. Perhaps in a few years, you will be in a position to allow your parents back into your life, but you certainly do not owe them anything. They fed and clothed you, yes, but this does not mean that they were “actually not all that bad.” In fact, they did not even do the bare minimum that is expected of a parent- provide for your mental and emotional wellbeing. These things are just as important as your physical health. Do not contact them out of any sense of obligation, because you have none to them. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Your only obligation is to yourself and to your future family (whether that family is a husband and children or a close group of friends). Give yourself a future as wonderful as your past should have been. I am not advising you to try and forget your past or to view it through rose-colored glasses. Do not allow yourself to forget what you have suffered. Things should have been different, but you can still use the sorry hand you were dealt to be a better person and help others like you in the future. Go on and be incredible, and do not allow your past demons to hinder you. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Sincerely, Auntie Agnes </em>
</p><p>It’s a bit too cheesy and a lot too preachy for his taste, meaning that it should be perfect for publication. He now has… about ten minutes left on the ride.</p><p>“Shit,” he mutters. Is it not long enough? Or is it too long? Each reply he wrote is in the realm of two or three paragraphs in length. He can’t remember how long they typically are; admittedly, he doesn’t pay much attention to the material in Witch Weekly unless he’s directly responsible for its editing. The bus driver, a woman with smiling eyes which droop more and more each day, has evidently decided that none of her passengers will take issue with her music today, and the local variety station is playing rather loudly. Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5” is playing. Remus distracts himself from how apropos it is by wondering when and where he managed to learn every single word.</p><p>“They let you dream just to watch them shatter,” he quietly sings along, ruining Dolly’s clear voice with his own gravelly baritone.</p><p>Perhaps in another world he would bust out his long-neglected falsetto, once said to rival the bubbliest Hufflepuff choir girl, but in this world he is a ragged ghost of a man on a shambling bus full of similarly grey strangers, none of whom seem as though they might appreciate an impromptu drag performance. Remus hasn’t properly sung in over a decade, and vocal cords, like all muscles, atrophy in their disuse. Many parts of him have fallen into disuse over the past decade, parts which he likes to pretend have disappeared as if they do not scream at him in pain every waking moment, begging for some action.</p><p>Recently, he’s allowed the enthusiasm for education to return. This sensation which James, Peter, and… just about everyone but Lily had been convinced would wear away within a couple of years at Hogwarts had only grown along with Remus. Education is a particular type of magic, magic which is only perceptible to those who have been denied it, or understand what it is to live without it. He aims to help his students see just a bit of this magic. If they’re able to see just that tiny glimpse, their curiosity will drive them to peel back the curtain of obfuscation (and every other barrier in their way) on their own long after Remus has ceased instruction.</p><p>Eight minutes left. Dolly has gone, and Remus has no idea what is playing now- something with a guitar that begs him to close his eyes and sway. Remus cannot afford to close his eyes. Genuinely, if he closes his eyes for longer than a few seconds, he will fall asleep, miss his stop, miss work, and lose his job sooner than planned. More importantly, he’ll lose his final paycheck. Instead, he listens for the key, then the time signature, and then for the rhyme scheme. He notices an odd (slant, he thinks it's called) rhyme, “leg” and “lag,” which only an American could really get away with. Remus considers that maybe anyone willing to sufficiently bastardize their vowel sounds could pull it off, but he is not willing to make such concessions and marks it down as a refusal on behalf of the UK, each and every ridiculously specific accent categorization in Britain be damned.</p><p>Seven minutes. Maybe falling asleep on the bus wouldn’t be too bad. He could easily survive without his last paycheck for the week before he heads to Hogwarts. Rent is paid, and he has half a loaf of bread, a jar of marmalade, some instant noodles, and two bananas left. Honestly, the library doesn’t pay very well and he could almost certainly find more beneficial employment. Working at the library does, however, save him from the medical costs which might result from him banging his head on the walls of whatever fluorescently lit establishment may deign to hire a man with shoddily forged evidence of education, an alarming amount of scars, and who requires at least three specific days off each month.</p><p>Shelving books, odd as it may sound, sustains him. Like… oatmeal. Not as exciting as omelettes or corn muffins, but an important staple of the breakfast table nonetheless.</p><p>Six minutes. Remus rereads all three of his responses, probably muttering to himself and looking the maniac. The bus jolts and it takes Remus a bit to refocus his eyes, reminding him that he needs to get some reading glasses.</p><p>Three minutes.</p><p>“Loony, loopy Lupin,” he sings softly.</p><p>He is certain that Peeves torments poor Luna Lovegood with a similarly unoriginal play on words. Hogwarts, for better and for worse, never really changes. Remus attempts to look morosely out the window and succeeds only in appraising his own reflection in the grimy glass.</p><p>He needs a haircut, he supposes, although nothing could really save it now. Thirty-three and going grey. His hair is thinning, though the hairline is not receding. He thanks God and Merlin for small mercies. Remus had never been blessed with the luxury of vanity; his hair, thick and shiny in his youth, had been his sole comfort in the mirror. It could be considered dignified, the silver, were Remus himself the sort of man one might consider dignified.</p><p>The jumper he’s wearing was probably scratchy once upon a time, but it was already well-loved when he acquired it and Remus refuses to skimp on fabric softener. Its pattern is gloriously abhorrent, all bright oranges and greens and reds spattered over one another in various geometric shapes. Werewolves are supposed to run hot, but Remus has always felt cold leeching at his frayed edges.</p><p>That, and there’s hardly a clear inch of skin on his body.</p><p>If it’s not scar tissue, it’s full of ink. Hell, half of the scar tissue is full of ink too. He takes out his earring and he could use magic to cover the tattoos, but he’s no Metamorphmagus, and a single slip-up would be disastrous. So he sticks to more simple solutions.</p><p>One more stoplight.</p><p>Quitting his job at the library did hurt. Peter would’ve told him not to even bother quitting, to just not come back and spare himself the awkwardness, but Remus couldn’t bring himself to do that to the sweet old librarians who employ him.  He’ll be showing the new hire how to shelve properly today, and then he’ll say his goodbyes.</p><p>Remus does not enjoy saying goodbye.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Six full days with which to do as he wishes.</p><p>It’s a wholly unfamiliar treat, much like German chocolate cake. The first bite is delicious; the second is wonderful; the third is just fine; the fourth makes you reconsider the size of your slice; the fifth is just an overly decadent chore. Remus supposes that if he had grown up having German chocolate birthday cakes he would be used to the richness, but Hope and Lyall Lupin had been firm believers in birthday <em> pie </em> for some godforsaken reason, and so Remus doesn’t quite know what to do with cake. Still, he does need to pack his things and send them on to Hogwarts, but that’ll just take an afternoon at most. He doesn’t have much. What little furniture he has will be staying here, as Minerva assured him that his quarters will be completely furnished. All he needs to bring is clothing, a lesson plan, and his wand.</p><p>Remus is fairly certain that he’ll be the only Hogwarts professor teaching in Muggle clothing most of the time, but it can’t be helped. Robes are just more expensive than they have any right to be, and the tendency of wizards to charm old things to seem new until they’re absolutely useless means that secondhand shops aren’t very common. Remus has one decent set of robes that might be said to fit if he charms them, and one tattered old cloak that hasn’t seen the light of day in years and may, for all Remus knows, already be demolished by moths. Wolfsbane is the second-greatest blessing he’s been granted in all his life, but once he exchanges his Muggle money for wizarding coin (which nets him much less buying power than Muggle money, not because of any true value but because wizards are a bigoted lot largely devoid of economic sense) all of his money from the library and then some goes towards Wolfsbane.</p><p>Used to go towards Wolfsbane. Dumbledore has arranged for Snape to brew it as a part of his duties as Potions master, and Remus is only slightly afraid of being poisoned or sabotaged. Snape never did have the guts to go all-in on anything besides his entirely unjustified superiority complex. Well, that and attempting to out Remus to the entirety of Hogwarts. Thinking of all of his worst memories, Snape played a role in many, his appearances outpaced only by Sirius Black.</p><p>Remus isn’t sure if the fact that Sirius was a part of all his greatest memories as well makes it better or worse. He leans towards worse. The fact that Sirius would enjoy knowing that he beat Snape in this, too, is definitely painful. Every thought involving Sirius is painful, which means that every thought about his past, about his greatest friends, about his first love, about his education, about growing up, makes something deep within his chest ache and something else behind his eyes grow and press into everything uncomfortably. The two memories which were once his worst are now a kind of sick assurance that Sirius was and is capable of magnificent cruelty, and he forces himself to replay them whenever he questions.</p><p>Remus is much more well-adjusted than he has any right to be, in his own opinion. Going back to Hogwarts could threaten that, seeing as he’s already plunged back into the lines of thought that he attempted to put to rest nearly a decade ago, but going back to Hogwarts is also his only chance to possibly have a life, and he isn’t going to fuck it up. He had a life once, six, actually, and they all ended quickly after his time at Hogwarts.</p><p>All save for one. Remus still hasn’t decided how to approach Harry. Does he know who Remus was to his parents? Does he have any idea that he once clumsily referred to Remus as Uncle Moony, that Remus used to read him bedtime stories back before he could form a single word, that they should be family? Does he hate Remus for failing to contact him all these years?</p><p>Remus hates Remus for failing to contact Harry. He tells himself that he couldn’t do anything. Werewolves can’t have custody of non-biological children, and Petunia Evans would never let Remus near any child of hers. Still, Remus could have done more. He’d thought of it many times before, of moving nearby and trying to find employment at Harry’s school as a custodian to keep an eye on him, or of pleading with Petunia for informal visitation, but Remus always was and always will be a coward at heart. And what happens when Harry realizes who and what he is? Not a werewolf, though that’s more than enough to justify his running the other way. What happens when he recognizes Remus as the man who could have saved his parents? Remus hates never seeing Harry, but he couldn’t bear losing him again. Harry already has two dead parents- he doesn’t need another dead man trying to fill their space.</p><p>He’ll be honest with Harry. Teach him as well as he can, because Remus refuses to stand by and watch again as innocents die. Tell him anything he wants to know about his parents, because Petunia refused to truly know her own sister when Lily turned out to be different. Take every shred of life Remus has left and give it to Harry, because Remus borrowed them quite a while back and repayment is long overdue.</p><p>In the meantime, he needs to make a copy of all of his lesson plans to send on to Dumbledore so he can make arrangements for the creatures and materials required. While he’s at it, he’ll make copies of his work for Witch Weekly, the letters and the editing, to keep for himself. He likes having a record of the work he’s done, however vapid or short the piece is. It’s nice to think that when he’s gone, there’ll be a little filing box to remember his passions when nobody else does. Some young witch or wizard or Squib or Muggle might find it and read it all and wonder who he was, or just rifle through the box before throwing it all away, or it all might burn down in the next Great Fire of London. Objects generally outlive their owners, even if they don’t live much longer.</p><p>Fuck, Remus used to be so fun. When did a morbid nonagenarian wrestle the wheel from him, boot him out of his own car, and start driving 40 in a 60 mph zone? It’ll all be alright, though, once he’s back at Hogwarts. He just has to survive a week of his own thoughts.</p><p>They’re just one more thing he can’t control.</p>
