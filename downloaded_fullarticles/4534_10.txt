    <p>
  <span>With dragon's blood, as all the books told you, one had to be careful. It was all about precision, what with how potent it was. 12 uses there might be, but all required a good amount of skill to actually successfully complete.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco, 23 and cooped up in a small lab in the old apothecary he'd managed to find a job at, stared hard at the potion bubbling before him, eyedropper of dragon blood held delicately between two long fingers while he waits for the exact right time to add it. His mother would be horrified at the state of his robes, he thinks a little distantly, sweat beading on his brow. His mother wouldn't ever have to see these robes, hopefully, so he's pretty sure he can avoid that particular argument; they're his </span>
  <em>
    <span>work</span>
  </em>
  <span> robes, though, honestly, he wears them while brewing so as not to cause harm to his </span>
  <em>
    <span>proper</span>
  </em>
  <span> robes. Not that mother would care; all robes must be impeccable, who knows who you might see.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The potion finally turns the correct color, a murky green, and he squeezes out 4 drops of dragon blood into it, waiting a beat before picking up his ladle to stir it until it turns a shimmery blue; another potion well done. He backs away, setting the ladle down gently beside the cauldron, and then turns to the little timer on the wall beside it, leaning in to set it for 3 hours. That will give the potion time to finish brewing, and himself the time to get some stuff done out front. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a good day, really, a semi-steady stream of customers to keep the clerk at the front busy while he had an incredibly productive morning brewing in the back. Draco preferred days like this, where they were busy enough that the clerks working the register didn't get bored and come looking for him and he was able to get real work done; really beef up their stock for when they're busier  because Draco hated having to go out front to help. He hated busy days, hated when there were incompetent people asking ludicrous questions… and that was why he stayed in the back and prayed he looked busy and intense and not like he was hiding, which is what he was doing… hiding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The clerk isn’t behind the counter, and Draco wonders if he should feel bad that he doesn’t remember their name as he moves around and into the store proper. He also wonders if this means that it’s truly dead in here today, because where would the clerk be if not behind the counter?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’m really looking for something that would help with de-icing.” a female voice can be heard saying from deeper in the shop than Draco currently is. His brow furrows slightly, because that voice was familiar to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s intrigued, but he pushes that back because he hates helping customers, and moves to check on their supply of sleep aids. Part of him is hopeful he'll hear more of this conversation (sleep aids would be directly over the shelf from where the conversation seems to be happening), but mostly it's for stocking purposes. Truly. He's not interested in helping at all…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Except no one has ever come in for ‘de-icing’ products before. And Draco is almost certain the clerk won't be able to help.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, well…” he hears peripherally as he makes his way down the aisle. “...curious request, really.” and Draco almost stops mid-count when he hears that, opting just to cringe and continue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you have a certified potions master, do you not? Are they on hand?” the woman asks, clearly displeased by the clerk, but still sounding polite. Her voice is extremely familiar, Draco thinks, that time especially.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He should move, so that if the clerk comes looking for him he's not obviously across the way, but… well, he can always play that he was busy with his work and hadn't heard everything, which is true. He goes for that, because he hears shuffling, had been distracted so he hadn't listened in, and forces his attention back to his count.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Malfoy?” the clerk asks, voice quiet, almost timid, and Draco remembers his name, suddenly; Nigel. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, what is it?” He asks, impatience clear in his voice, and he doesn't turn to look at him yet, waiting until he's added the last number to his book.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, we've had an interesting request, you see, and…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco turns his full attention on the boy (a few years younger, a few years below him at Hogwarts). “and you couldn't help the customer?” He prompts, to which Nigel nods carefully, expression almost pleased; Like Draco understanding means he's not upset.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, well, it's an interesting request, you see, for, um, de-icing products.” Nigel says, and Draco just stares at him a moment, then sighs, gesturing for him to lead the way on to wherever he had left the poor customer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco should have expected it, he knew he’d recognized the voice, the tones in it, and here she is right in front of him. “Granger?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Malfoy.” Granger says, almost surprised, and Draco expects something more. He expects her to have a look of revulsion on her face, expects her to decide to go somewhere else but…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But maybe he doesn’t know her as well as he always thought he did. Maybe he’s conflating Weasley’s reaction to him from school with how Granger might react to him. Maybe he just doesn’t understand how she works, and how she grew as a person from the war.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m looking for de-icing products, you wouldn’t happen to have anything? Or perhaps know of anything that could help with, well, de-icing?” She asks, as if she’s completely over the fact that he’s Draco Malfoy, stepping forward to gently and subtly tell Nigel he’s unneeded now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco is quiet for a moment, considering, but also confused and trying to get over his clear misconception. “I suppose the first question I need answered is the type of… ice… that you are dealing with.” He says, slower, gesturing for her to follow him down an aisle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If, say, one were to have a godson whose magic is just starting to show up… and he’s most likely to cause everything to...freeze.” She says, careful, almost embarrassed; like she can’t believe that she can’t personally handle it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Novel.” Draco says, almost a joke, but more like he finds it intriguing, which he does. “Is there water involved or is it any object?” He asks as they make it down to the end of a row.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was interesting at first, but now I just need to </span>
  <em>
    <span>fix it</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” Granger says, sighing a little, shaking her head like she’s exasperated but also amused. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco hums thoughtfully, a half smile on his lips as he turns his eyes to the shelf to consider their options. “Well, we could try a mixture of some rather mundane herbs…” he murmurs, plucking a couple of small containers off the shelves before holding them out for her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cinnamon, ginger, and... “ She squints, her voice full of confusion, “Turmeric?” ending on a question, her eyes jump up to his, an eyebrow raised. “Really?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco rolls his eyes, opting for haughty, a little like he’s looking down on her, but she seems to be ignoring it as she continues to look up at him, waiting for an answer. He sighs, put upon. “Warming.” He says simply. “They’re used for warming, so one could assume…” he leads, like he’s being patient with her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Granger rolls her eyes and holds her hand out for him to deposit the three containers in them. “How would you suggest I use them?” She asks, head tilting just a little.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It will depend on what you’re using them </span>
  <em>
    <span>on.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” He says, ushering her  up to the front with a nod of his head and a short gesture of his hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On Tuesday of the next week Draco is brewing the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Wolfsbane</span>
  </em>
  <span> potion. It’s difficult, but rewarding in that way that only the most difficult and complicated things are when completed. Granger walks through the front door of the shop just after he’s finished setting a timer for it. He only knows because Nigel calls out a hello. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is Mal- Mr. Malfoy here, Nigel?” She asks, and Draco hears it from where he’s come up to his desk by the door. He decides to pretend he doesn’t hear it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, of course, should I? I’ll just, just get him for you.” Nigel says, and Draco just rolls his eyes to himself, a sneer gracing his face that he only barely hides when Nigel peeks into the room, head turning until he finds him. “Miss Granger is here to see you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco gives him a look that he’s sure the boy doesn’t understand, and then sighs, dragging a hand through his hair. “Alright.” He says, stepping back from his workbench and straightening himself out as Nigel disappears back out front. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“De-icing went well, mostly.” Granger says as he steps fully into view behind the counter, and he takes note of the lack of proper greeting with a raised brow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mostly?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sighs, stepping back as Draco makes his way around the counter, only to step closer again when he just leans a hip against the counter from her side and crosses his arms. “Well, there were some things that took a little more… direct approach.” She says, brushing a stray lock of hair out of her face, focus on Draco as she speaks and he kind of likes that; it’s like she’s fully engaged in what she’s saying, in the potential conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, then I will have to assume that you’ve a new problem.” He says, almost leading, interested. He kind of likes that Hermione Granger is asking </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span> for help. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sighs and shakes her head a little, that half-exasperated smile on her face. “Well, it’s no longer Teddy causing problems, it’s, well, do you remember the blast-ended skrewts?” She asks, almost apologetic, and it’s probably because the look on Draco’s face is most definitely one of horror.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right. Fire this time.” He says, shifting away from the counter to lead her down a different aisle, a little hasty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On Friday, Draco has barely finished filling one bottle of the wolfsbane he’d been completing on Tuesday when the shop door opens and he </span>
  <em>
    <span>just knows</span>
  </em>
  <span> it’s Granger. He sighs, sets the bottle down, wipes off his hands, and heads to the front; it’s too early for Nigel.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh thank goodness.” She says, and she looks windswept and a little frantic; hair previously very neat, eyes wide. “I was hoping you’d be the first in.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco blinks, pushes past the shock of that, and nods, expression cool and almost bored. “Wolfsbane is delicate, I had to pull it off the heat.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Granger opens her mouth, like she’s got another question now that he’s said that, but shakes her head and gives him a little look. “Next time I’ll ask, but for now…” She says, and then she’s setting a cage he hadn’t noticed her carrying onto the counter and nudging it closer to his side. “Fix it.” She says, and he blinks, taken aback, and turns his focus away from the bewildering woman and onto the cage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that.. Is that Weasley?”He asks, both fascinated and horrified, stood closer and bent down so he can see.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Granger blushes, which he only catches part of because he’s looking up at her from his bent over position in front of the tiny cage. “You remember ‘Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes’?” She asks, and the blush reveals itself to have been from annoyance and not embarrassment, which Draco feels a little pleased to note. He nods, and she continues. “Well, George is working on some type of, oh, ridiculous something-or-other and </span>
  <em>
    <span>this idiot</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she says, gesturing to the cage wherein lay a bright orange salamander with tufts of hair, “decided it </span>
  <em>
    <span>couldn’t hurt</span>
  </em>
  <span> to try some of it.” She huffs, clearly displeased, rolling her eyes at the idea.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco blinks, standing up slowly. “They don’t have an antidote?” He asks, only realizing after he’s said it that </span>
  <em>
    <span>they</span>
  </em>
  <span> should have been </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span> and now wonders if she’ll think he’s totally awful for that slip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She just shakes her head, though, “No, George hasn’t finished it yet, wasn’t testing it on </span>
  <em>
    <span>people</span>
  </em>
  <span> yet, so now we’ve got </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” She says, gesturing to the cage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have the potion?” He asks, hopeful on that end, and she nods, slapping a little bottle down next to the cage. “We won’t talk about </span>
  <em>
    <span>how</span>
  </em>
  <span> I got it, but here it is. I’d have tried to figure out an antidote myself, but I’m late for work as is, and…” She trails off and sighs, “I don’t really fancy fucking it up further, you see?” She says, and Draco doesn’t say that she’s clearly okay with </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span> fucking it up, but she seems to not mean it that way, so maybe it’s alright.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll see what I can do, no promises for a fast result.” He says, businesslike, not near as informal as she’d been, but he thinks she caught the look on his face, the almost casual look it had adopted while she was speaking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Granger nods, giving him a warm smile. “I’ll come back at lunch, like 2? I’d say after work, but I’m likely to be out late tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco’s gnawing his lower lip while she speaks, eyes on the creature in the cage, considering. “I’ll owl if I have something for you to see by 2; have the Wolfsbane to finish first after all, so plan to come when you’re out of work.” He says, and she nods, an odd look on her face when he looks up for her reaction that she slowly hides behind a thankful smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, after work, then.” She says, before disappearing out into the morning hustle and bustle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco stares after her for a moment, then looks down at the salamander with a distinct frown. “Let’s see what we can do for Miss Granger, then.” he says, levitating the cage and grabbing the bottle Granger had left and heading back into his work room. Before he shuts the door, he flips over the ‘do not disturb’ sign, and then shuts it soundly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At 6pm he’s working on a third possible antidote, notes about the original potion strewn over his desk and stuck to the wall above him. Weasley is walking circles around the cage Granger had brought him in, and Draco is pretty close, he feels, to breaking the antidote.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bell on the front door jingles, and Nigel makes a surprised sound, but Draco is focused so he doesn’t hear what’s said next, the stammered disagreement from Nigel, the confident blow off from Granger, and then the door is being opened and he starts, sitting up abruptly and hitting his head on one of the over-hanging shelves over his desk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ow - what is it Nigel?” he demands, wincing with a hand against his head, turning abruptly and then losing all of his temper at the sight of who it actually is in the room disturbing him. “Oh, I thought you’d be by later, or…” he trails off, looking for a clock to confirm the time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Granger chuckles softly, shaking her head, amusement tempered by silent concern behind her eyes. “Should I give you a moment, for your head or?” she asks, and apparently the amusement won out, and Draco is a little shocked by that, but he recovers well; always does.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will survive.” he says, a half smile on his face, almost a smirk. “I haven’t finished it yet, the antidote, the potion Weasley created is complex, I’m…” he trails off, doesn’t want to admit that he might be stumped, turning back to his scattered notes. The salamander stops its pacing and turns to look at Granger, climbing partly up the sides of the cage. “This might work.” he says, holding out the page he’d been working on before she interrupted, as if he hadn’t trailed off previously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Granger’s eyes light up and she steps closer, clearly fresh from an eye roll. “And are these the components of the original potion?” she asks after a moment, eyes up on a tacked up piece of scratch paper. Draco nods, and Granger makes a little humming sound. “So you’re using these to counteract each?” She asks, like a small clarification, taking his most recent antidote notes and clearly matching them against the original potion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sort of. It’s not quite that easy, there were a couple of charms and spells used.” he says, looking up at the list. “Have to undo the active ingredients, and…” he trails off, blinking for a second, eyes following the movement of Granger’s finger as it moves between ingredients. “Oh, that’s it…” he says, stealing the parchment back from Granger and grabbing a quill to scribble out his new thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, will this work, you think?” she asks, reading over his shoulder. Normally he hates that, but he’s making an exception now because he likes the tone of her voice, like she’s impressed by him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It should.” he says, pushing his chair back slowly. “I’ll start now…” he says, turning for one of his cauldrons, eyes already scanning rows of ingredients for what he needs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me just…” Granger says, and then she’s gone, but Draco only barely notices, focus sharp on his new task. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’s back less than an hour later, he supposes though he’s not very aware of the time right now, with food, and then she’s insisting she help him, bossing him around his own work room. He listens more than she expects, more than he, himself, expects, but then they have to let the potion simmer, so they step back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They eat the food Granger had brought, warming charms bringing it back to a temperature worth eating it at, and Granger talks the whole time. It’s better that she’s speaking, keeps him from thinking about this too much, from considering the fact that they’re sharing a meal and discussing potions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her questions are mostly about the Wolfsbane potion, seemingly surprised that he brews it, and he’s not sure he’s ready to tell her why </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span> of all people is comfortable brewing this potion, but…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re people, too, Granger, I know you must know that, bleeding heart that you are.” he says after a little bit, uncomfortable with her questioning, her incessant quest for knowledge. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She rolls her eyes, brushing this aside, “Yes, of course I know that, honestly Malfoy.” She says, like that’s not what she’d been asking him about. It wasn’t, really, she’d asked him a lot of questions, but they’d been all at once and he’d focused on one. “But how do they know to come to you for it? You know we’re working to fix the registry, so it’s more like the animagus one, but… well, obviously it can’t be </span>
  <em>
    <span>exactly</span>
  </em>
  <span> like that… We want it to be inclusive, Harry and I, we’re working on a bill, in honor of Professor Lupin, you remember him?” She asks, and there she goes again, more questions with no breath in between, more information that he has to digest at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Snape let slip he was a werewolf over breakfast end of the year that year, I remember.” he says, a little moue of distaste on his lips, crossing over his face. “Poor taste, really.” he adds, eyebrows knitting together. He hadn’t cared about Professor Lupin, not then, but he’d been a stupid 13-year-old. He’s older now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Granger chuckles, almost rueful, shaking her head. “Is that when you figured it out?” she asks, and there’s a teasing glint in her eye, but he shouldn’t be looking there, so he looks away and adopts a haughty look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not all of us had </span>
  <em>
    <span>time</span>
  </em>
  <span> for snooping.” He says, and it makes her laugh, which he isn’t certain was his intention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no I suppose not.” She says, grinning at him, warm, and Draco isn’t used to this type of open emotion; she’s so expressive. She sighs and shakes her head, brushing her unruly hair back out of her face. “You’ve given me an idea, though; a list of safe apothecaries, or safe stores. Places that are open to serving and helping werewolves…” She murmurs, sitting back against the wall where she’s perched on the edge of his desk. He makes a little face, just like he had when she’d sat down there, but doesn’t comment on </span>
  <em>
    <span>that.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t own this shop, Granger.” he says quietly, almost quelling. She looks over at him then, doesn’t really turn her head, just looks at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Safe wizards, too.” she says, thoughtful, smile coming late. “How long on the potion, d’you think?” she asks, switching tacks. He’s going to think about the Wolfsbane questions for a while though, they’ll haunt him for the next week at least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s see what color it is.” he says, thoughtful, standing up, wanting to get away from the desk, suddenly. It’s the right color, he thinks, after a little bit of deliberation, and so he removes it from the heat and pulls some up into a dropper. “Take him out?” he asks, and she nods, backing away and then opening the cage to grab Weasley.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sets him on the ground in the middle of the empty work space, and steps back, looking up at Draco and nodding. “Alright, go ahead.” she says and there’s confidence in her tone, Draco likes that; she’s confident in him. Hermione Granger is confident in him, Draco Malfoy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He squeezes a few drops of the antidote onto the orange salamander, and then steps back, looking up at Granger as he does so. She’s smiling at him, warm, then she looks down at the salamander, biting her lower lip, waiting and then…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bloody hell!” Weasley shouts, and Draco thinks that’s rather rude.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On Thursday, almost a full week since he’d turned Weasley back into a human, he’s checking the stock of health potions at the front window, a task he generally tries to avoid. He’s trying to keep busy, has been since last Friday, because he had been right: the Wolfsbane questions were rattling around in his brain and he couldn’t get rid of them. The front door opens, then closes, and he refuses to look because he wants Nigel to deal with it if they need help; he’s not here for customer service.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy.” Granger says pleasantly from beside him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He blinks, turning to look at her, his clipboard and quill freezing in mid-air. “Granger?” he says, just the hint of a question, but she’s smiling at him, so he’s not in trouble. He’s not sure what he could possibly have been in trouble </span>
  <em>
    <span>for</span>
  </em>
  <span> but he’s not in trouble and that’s what matters.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are your thoughts on water?” She asks, and he frowns a little. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Necessary for survival?” He suggests, “Not my favorite thing to walk through?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Granger laughs, then shakes her head. “Nor mine, really.” She says, the smile remaining in her eyes. “This might not be something you can fix, but my office is currently home to a large number of, well, </span>
  <em>
    <span>dark</span>
  </em>
  <span> creatures. Like hinkypunks, you know?” She asks, and Draco desperately wants to ask why, but he’s been blindsided by this information, so he’s silent for now. “And aside from the water stains that I’ve spent the better part of the last two days trying to rid myself of, I’ve noticed a problem with the water…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, first, I would suggest getting them out of your office.” He says, straight-faced and fairly reasonable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Granger rolls her eyes at him, but she’s grinning. “Okay, </span>
  <em>
    <span>barring that</span>
  </em>
  <span> idea, as I can’t for the moment, and I promise I’ll tell you about it </span>
  <em>
    <span>later</span>
  </em>
  <span>…” She says, quelling, and Draco wonders if that means they’re friends of some sort before he pushes that aside as he crosses his arms over his chest and raises an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine, then what, pray tell, is so incorrect about the water in the hideous creature tanks?” He asks, and she doesn’t rise to the bait, doesn’t laugh, just launches into a long-winded description of how the water wasn’t just simply </span>
  <em>
    <span>murky</span>
  </em>
  <span> it was </span>
  <em>
    <span>dirty</span>
  </em>
  <span> but it was new water, apparently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He listens for a solid 3 minutes before he realizes he’s fully frowning and doesn’t need the kind of wrinkles that could cause (his mother would be horrified).</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not very… versed on water.” he says, slow, walking her surreptitiously toward the back room, clearly thinking. “But it might have to do with the things within the water, you said there were plants and rocks as well as the creatures?” he asks, clarification, moving into his work space and finding the shelf he wants. He reaches up, careful, long fingers tracing spines as he looks for something. “And they would all, presumably, need something different from the water, correct?” he asks as he pulls things down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It takes Granger a couple moments longer than expected to answer him, and he actually gets a little impatient, wondering if he’d managed to lose her and realizing how awful that would be… but she’s just watching him, he finds when he looks back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know I’m a sight to behold, but…” he says, deliberate, an almost-challenge, eyebrow rising suggestively, and she rolls her eyes, shaking her head (but it doesn’t hide the blush creeping high on her cheeks).</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re right, of course, that would make the most sense.” She says, and he’s pleased she was listening, so he turns back to find another book as she comes forward to take the two he’d already pulled down. “Research.” She adds, with a little sigh, a smile there. “Ah, Malfoy, you don’t have all the answers, that’s good.” she murmurs, clearly for herself. “You won’t be upset if I come back after work, will you? Only I’m here on my lunch break.” She says, a little guiltily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s only after she’s left, with promises to return, that the thought strikes him about how odd it is that she came all the way to him for answers. She worked at the Ministry, she had a pretty good job if the papers were to be believed; why didn’t she go to any of </span>
  <em>
    <span>her own</span>
  </em>
  <span> potions masters?</span>

  <span>Draco spends most of the rest of the day looking through his books, considering different possibilities. It doesn’t occur to him until it’s almost 6:30pm that this is something for a herbologist, or a magizooligist, and definitely not a potions master. By this point, however, he’s got pages of notes and a separate piece of parchment with the few ideas he’s had, listed out by point with small scratch diagrams beside each, hanging up above his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s an owl waiting patiently by the window, but he’s been ignoring it for the past half hour, busy with his realization that he shouldn’t be dealing with this and continuing to search anyway. He doesn’t notice when the door is pushed open, used to ignoring that, but he </span>
  <em>
    <span>does</span>
  </em>
  <span> notice, when a hand is placed on his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The owl was well pleased to be rid of this letter.” Granger says, and Draco closes his eyes, fights the urge to bring a hand to his chest over his frantically beating heart. She sets the letter before him, and he glances at it, frowning, before shaking his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mother knows where I am if she wants to speak to me.” He mutters, pushing the letter off to the side. “But you’ve come for news on your water problem.” He says, louder, and he’s not looking at her, eyes roaming over the messy notes and open books on his desks, so he misses the soft way she was looking at him, misses the way her eyes snap back to attention, a soft blush dusting her upper cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, yes, I’ve also brought dinner, as I correctly assumed you wouldn’t have eaten yet.” She says, and he blinks a little, then turns to look at her, a little incredulous. “I’m not much of a cook, so it’s take out like last time, but on the bright side I can confirm it’s good.” She says, like she’s proud of herself, smiling at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right.” He says, but she’s not derailed by his slow responses, she just looks around and then transfigures a couple of boxes into a chair, and another into a little table that she nudges up beside his cluttered desk, and then she drops the bag of food on top. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can eat and talk, yeah?” She suggests, gesturing toward his notes as she gets the bag to unpack itself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco is quiet for another moment longer, just watching her, a soft frown of confusion on his lips, before he sits up, drags a hand through his hair, and moves some of his notes over for her to see, setting them to floating beside the table as she’s taken it over with the food, and slowly starts to explain what he’s learned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm, yes, I think there’s a term for that, a scientific term… oh, it’s used for pools… Ph! That’s it, the ‘ph’ balance.” she says, and Draco has no idea what that is, but he tables that, letting her wave her hand and erase it for another, later conversation. “So, your thoughts?” She prompts, because Draco prides himself on staying on topic and hadn’t delved into his own thoughts previously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s not sure if </span>
  <em>
    <span>Granger</span>
  </em>
  <span> likes that he does that, but she doesn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>have to.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “I’m not qualified to help Kappas survive in tanks in your office.” He says, deadpan, and she blows out an amused breath through her nose and rolls her eyes, crossing her legs and tilting her head and he sighs, </span>
  <em>
    <span>beaten.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “I have a few theories, but I would need more information to give actual recommendations.” he says, and she hums, nodding a little.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me see?” She asks, eyes scanning the parchment pieces hanging around them. With a flick of his wand these order themselves neatly on his desk, and he reaches up for the list he’d left hanging over his desk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> “This is it.” He says, almost defensive because he feels, for some reason, like he should have been able to help her more completely. “They’re more… the important things I could pull together…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Granger hums, taking the list and tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. “Thorough.” She murmurs, almost teasing. Draco looks away at that, almost embarrassed. “Do you have most of the possible supplies?” She asks after a couple of minutes, and Draco blinks, looking up at her from his desk. He’d moved there, standing over it, to look at the letter from his mother while she read over the list.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, out front.” He says, turning slowly from his desk to bring her out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You shouldn’t ignore your mother, you know.” She says, clearly having caught him considering her letter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco rolls his eyes. “Yes, well, she knows where to find me, as I said.” He replies, ushering her out into the shop and around the counter to find her what she’s decided she wants.</span>
