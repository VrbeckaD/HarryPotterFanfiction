  <strong>Chapter One</strong>
</p><p>  Draco Malfoy had successfully asked Harry Potter out on a date. </p><p> As he lay in bed alone that night, he found that he couldn’t sleep. His mind was swarming with dread, with excitement, and with a terrifying hope. He couldn’t stop thinking about the eleven year old boy with the empty, outstretched hand in comparison to how full he felt right now, both in body and mind.</p><p> Ironically, his bed only had one person in it tonight. After he and Harry had discussed going on a date on Saturday, they agreed that they had been proceeding all wrong.</p><p> “We’ve been doing this a little backwards, yeah? I mean, not that I know one-hundred percent how all this works.”</p><p> Draco scoffed—at least Harry had been with someone before. He had never before shared closeness in a way so terrifying. “The world is so upside down that I’m not sure there’s rhyme or reason to anything anymore.”</p><p> “That’s it though, wouldn’t it be nice to have some sort of semblance of order? Maybe we should strictly be friends right now, you know? Not sharing a bed, not being dependent...just <em>being</em>. We can see how our date goes and go forth from there.”</p><p> Harry seemed sure about this and Draco didn’t want to discourage him so soon after he had agreed to let Draco take him on a date, so Draco slept alone. But he was not happy about it—with his parents’ trial in a matter of days, he was feeling more anxious than ever. He hoped after Saturday, Harry would agree to share his bed in the nights leading up to his next appearance before the Wizengamot.</p><p> Draco tossed in his bed, already hearing Harry snoring which was both cute and irritating. He tried to turn his thoughts to happier things—he had a date to plan! Of course their options were severely limited, so he would likely have to take Harry to Hogsmeade. Although, maybe he could convince Harry to use his Invisibility Cloak. He still wasn’t sure about the exact parameters of the manacle that he had to wear on his wrist until he graduated from Hogwarts, but he never got a reprimand for the Ministry from their outing to Godric’s Hollow. The advantage here was Harry’s Muggle upbringing—what could Draco show him about the Wizarding World that would make him fall in love with it as much as the world had fallen in love with him? </p><p> Or maybe Draco should aim a little lower for their first date. Perhaps he could take Harry on a picnic in the Malfoy Gardens? There were peacocks and swans, and it was possible that the lake would be frozen over—maybe they could go ice skating? Draco wondered if he would even have access to the Manor, or if it was still continuously being searched in anticipation of the trial. Besides, would Harry even want to visit a place so dark? </p><p> After a nearly sleepless night, only two days before their date, Draco decided to consult his friends, who were absolutely thrilled that he and Potter had finally expressed their feelings for each other.</p><p> “I think if you can go to the Malfoy Gardens, that would be a really cute idea,” Daphne said. “You could bring food, take a walk, get to know each other.”</p><p> “I don’t even know if I’m allowed back in my own home. Besides, he may have some bad memories of the place.” Draco didn’t know how much his friends knew of Harry’s capture in his home the past Easter. When Draco returned to school, though, there were rumors everywhere that Harry had been caught but managed to escape the Dark Lord’s clutches again. Of course, his friends had asked about the legitimacy of these rumors, but Draco physically could not tell them due to his punishment.</p><p> “Why wouldn’t you be allowed in your own home? It’s yours!” Blaise protested.</p><p> “I don’t know, I just don’t want to mess anything up with the trial coming up. I also want this date to go perfectly.”</p><p> “Just remember that he isn’t going on a date with you because he wants to do something in particular,” Gregory chimed in. “Vincent and I—“ he paused for a moment while Blaise and Daphne looked very surprised. It was rare for Greg to mention Vincent, both because of his own pain and because Vincent was so hated among the students. “We went on very few actual dates. Mostly we just talked, snuggled by the fire in the Room of Requirement, that sort of thing.”</p><p> Draco hated the Room of Requirement, but for a moment wished it was still functioning so that he could turn it into something Harry would love. On Friday, the day before the date, he found it nearly impossible to pay attention in his classes. Harry noticed when they were working on his Patronus in Defense Against the Dark Arts. </p><p> “Are you alright? You seem more out of it than usual today, and last time that happened you were nearly poisoned.”</p><p> Draco laughed. “No poison for me anymore, I just burn letters from people I don’t know straight away now. No, I’m fine.”</p><p> Harry sat down next to Draco, who was fiddling distractedly with his wand. “Is it...is it about tomorrow? We don’t have to go if you don’t want to, I understand if you’ve changed your mind.”</p><p> Draco looked up at Harry, startled. “Have <em>you</em> changed your mind?”</p><p> “Well, no. But I thought maybe you had...”</p><p> “No, of course not. I’ve just been trying to think of the perfect thing for us to do, that’s all. I don’t want to let you down,” he said quietly.</p><p> “Let me down? Draco, I’m happy to just spend time with you, to get to know you. We truly don’t have to do anything special. In fact, I would love it if we just went to a nice dinner or something.”</p><p> “Are you sure? I’m sure you’ve been to plenty of nice dinners, I thought you may want to do something more unique. Money isn’t an issue, I can arrange—“</p><p> Harry looked at Draco, amused. “I happen to have a vast fortune myself, so no worries about breaking the bank.” <em>Dammit</em>. Draco had forgotten that Harry’s father had been of pure blood and was wealthy. <em>One less reason for him to be with me. Then why did he agree to go on this date?</em> “No, we can just go to Hogsmeade, or even Diagon Alley if you want to avoid the other students. I just want to spend time with you, that’s all.”</p><p> Draco smiled back, feeling a little more reassured. He realized that he knew fairly little about the man sitting next to him. Knowing how he felt when he was around Harry was certainly enough to warrant wanting to go on a date, but if they were to enter a real relationship he was going to have to know more. </p><p> The day finally came. Parallel to their last Hogsmeade visit, which Draco prayed was a worse experience than this one would be, they took the train up to Hogsmeade, hiding under the Invisibility Cloak and staying in silence to avoid attracting any attention. Neither of them had discussed how open they wanted to be about what was going on with their respective friend groups and the school, and Draco worried that Harry may be mad if he knew that Draco had already told his friends about the impending date. However it seemed both of them came to a silent understanding that the people not expressly involved in their lives didn’t need to know what was going on right now. This feeling did not come out of shame, at least not for Draco, but out of fear. Draco didn’t need to be in the Prophet any more this week than the trial would already push him into the spotlight. </p><p> When Harry and Draco arrived in Hogsmeade, they then made use of the relatively abandoned Hog Head’s Floo network to travel to Diagon Alley. Harry entered the shop first, without the cloak, and made small talk with the person at the counter before Draco entered as well. The poor shopkeeper that he disturbed upon entry looked confused, as his fireplace had erupted in green flames with no floating head or person waiting to speak with him. Harry took his leave and guided an invisible Draco out the back door, both of them stifling laughs.</p><p> Harry frowned as he stared down the alleyway. “I didn’t think about this next part.”</p><p> Draco was ready to pull off the Cloak, but paused and stared at him. “How do you mean?”</p><p> “Well, it doesn’t bother me that much, but if your goal isn’t to be seen by anyone, I’m not sure if that’ll happen. This is almost more public than Hogsmeade, and we didn’t bring disguises or anything...”</p><p> “Psh. Speak for yourself, Potter,” Draco said good-naturedly. He pulled off the cloak and reached into his long trench coat. He got out some glasses with the frames cut out, a long scarf, and a beret which managed to hide his platinum blonde hair. “There. People won’t know who I am unless they look really closely, and thankfully it is perfectly acceptable to wear berets indoors.”</p><p> Harry looked amused. “You look like you belong on the streets of Paris, smoking a pipe and solving a mystery.”</p><p> “Like you would know what Parisans look like,” Draco said teasingly. “Don’t worry, I’ll take you there someday. Shall we?”</p><p> “One moment,” Harry said. “Like I said, I want to do this properly, and a normal first date doesn’t end with being swarmed with autograph requests.” He pulled out his wand.</p><p> “Don’t worry, Harry, I’ll try and keep my fans docile,” Draco said wryly, earning a laugh from his date. Harry’s smile lit Draco up inside and out.</p><p> Harry Potter morphed before his eyes with a few simple incantations. His hair became a lighter brown, and his face filled out a little. With the glasses Draco could certainly still tell that it was the Boy Who Lived disguised, but it was likely that people wouldn’t notice as they would expect Harry Potter to be either at Hogwarts or in Hogsmeade, not this far away from the safe haven of school.</p><p> “There’s a nice restaurant a few blocks from here,” Draco said. He used to go to the Italian place every year with his parents while they did his school shopping. In sixth year, he went with just his mother. He would give anything to be able to take her out to dinner again. His stomach churned at the thought of his parents and the fate they would be facing in the next few days, but he pushed the thoughts out of his mind and tried to focus on Harry’s presence next to him.</p><p> “Sounds great,” Harry said, quietly slipping his hand into Draco’s. Draco started at first in surprise, but melted into it. Harry’s hand was so soft—Draco wasn’t sure when he last had this kind of physical contact with someone. Maybe it was never before.  </p><p> Draco had so many questions for Harry, so many things that he wanted to know. Where to start? “Do you know this area well? Growing up with the Muggles and all...”</p><p> “Somewhat. I actually lived in the Leaky Cauldron for a bit when I was thirteen.”</p><p> “Why? Did the Muggles go on vacation?”</p><p> “No,” Harry looked amused. “I blew up my Aunt Marge and they kicked me out.”</p><p> “You—what?”</p><p> “My Aunt Marge came to visit. And of course I didn’t intend for her to swell up like a balloon and nearly go flying into the sky, but it just sort of happened. She really made me angry.”</p><p> Draco blinked and realized that the man sitting before him was full of wonder and mystery, and he couldn’t wait to learn everything about him. “Thank Merlin I never made you so angry that you turned me into a balloon...” Draco marveled as the two sat down, with their identities blissfully mundane, at the restaurant. A candle was lit between them, and they were handed wine menus.</p><p> “Well, you did get turned into a ferret, so I don’t know which is worse.”</p><p> Draco shuddered. “Yeah that wasn’t pleasant. My human thoughts went away, so I really had no clue what was happening. That’s one of the only times I was grateful for Professor McGonagall.”</p><p> “That’s weird though, isn’t it? That Barty Crouch Jr posing as Moody would want to turn you into a ferret. I would think that you’d be a favorite of his, given your father.”</p><p> Draco stiffened a bit at the mention of his father, and looked at Harry for any sign of malice. Finding none, he cleared his throat. “A lot of the former Death Eaters hated my father, actually. Still do. You heard Dolohov, they think he’s two-faced. And he is, they’re right, but they don’t think the Dark Lord was hard enough on him.”</p><p> Harry exhaled through his nose. “It must have been hard, to have been disliked on both sides,” he said quietly, extending a hand across the table.</p><p> Draco took it, his voice filled with emotion. Harry acted as though Draco was no longer disliked on both sides, but Draco knew the truth. “It is well-deserved.”</p><p> “Draco, look at me for a moment,” Harry said, his tone serious. Draco met his intense gaze. “I want you to know that you’re...I was going to say a totally different person, but that’s not it. It’s like you’ve kept all the best parts of the Draco Malfoy I knew and got rid of the little git inside. You’re still just as funny and witty, but you’re so much more kind and open. And that’s a good thing. You’re still you.”</p><p> Draco thought of closing doors in his mind to attempt to block the tears from his eyes. He did not know that he needed to hear those words, and he could feel the ache in his chest as if Harry had pointed out a gaping wound in his soul. “Thank you,” was all he managed to get out.</p><p> Noticing Draco’s discomfort, Harry changed the subject. “Could you imagine our faces a few years ago if we told ourselves that we were sitting at a restaurant together, holding hands?”</p><p> Draco smiled, and the rest of the dinner conversation remained light. Draco insisted on paying after a lengthy argument with Harry, but Harry insisted that they go for dessert afterward. All in all, the evening was going perfectly, to Draco’s relief. Conversation flowed naturally, and he often shelved away topics for future conversation. For example, there was clearly something wrong with the Muggles that Harry lived with—it doesn’t seem like he was treated well in the slightest. Harry had hinted at it before, but it seemed to affect him more deeply than Draco thought. But that was to be brought up at a different time, because Draco knew how touchy the subject of family could be. Seemingly in turn, Harry did not bring up the impending trial that was looming over Draco’s head like his own personal cloud. </p><p> Their disguises held up, and no one paid them any mind. That is, until a strong gust of wind made Draco’s beret fly right off of his head. Draco cursed and ran after it, promptly bumping into someone who was picking it up. “So sorry, sir,” he started. </p><p> “It’s no trouble.” He looked up straight into the eyes of Mr. Burke, holding his beret. The Malfoy family lawyer’s expression changed from politeness to wariness. “Wait...” he said, no doubt recognizing Draco’s eyes.</p><p> Draco took the beret, muttered a quick thank you, and ran back to grab Harry’s arm. “We have to go. Now.” He dragged a panicked Harry away to an alley.</p><p> Harry took out his wand. “What’s the problem? Is it your attackers?”</p><p> “No,” Draco was surprised that Harry was preparing to fight. “It’s Mr. Burke, I think he recognized me.”</p><p> “Oh,” Harry said, looking incredibly relieved.</p><p> “It’s a big deal!” Draco said, taking mild offense at Harry’s nonchalant tone. “I’m not even supposed to be outside Hogwarts grounds, let alone Diagon Alley a few days before my parents’ trial! We have to go.”</p><p> “Alright,” Harry said, getting out the Invisibility Cloak. “But getting back by Floo Powder unnoticed is going to be a lot harder. I don’t suppose the Vanishing Cabinet is still working?”</p><p> “After the Fiendfyre? Are you serious? Plus, think Potter, whose store would it be in?” Draco couldn’t help but be amused at Harry’s terrible idea for a plan. “Now I know why you had Granger in your posse,” he said, putting the Invisibility Cloak around him and Harry.</p><p> “Wait, I have a better plan.” Harry led Draco with the Invisibility Cloak to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. Draco groaned inwardly, but agreed that this was the best possible solution.</p><p>  Harry waved his wand so that his hair would turn to its normal coal black shade, and went inside, presumably to talk to Ron. He then ushered Draco in under the cloak, moving upstairs under the watchful and reproachful gaze of Ron so they could use Weasley’s Floo. Finally the two were back on safe grounds.</p><p> Draco was somewhat hoping that Harry would share his bed that evening, since the date had gone objectively well. However, after planting a small kiss on Draco’s cheek, Harry crushed that particular dream. “I really want to take this slow,” he said. “Because I think it could be something special. All my relationships burned really brightly and then died out immediately. I don’t want that to happen with us. Is that okay?”</p><p> “Of course it is,” Draco said, because it was, and also, what else was he going to say? He tossed and turned in bed, preparing himself for another sleepless night. His face was flushed with the excitement and happiness of the day, and he dozed lightly with ideas of how soft Harry’s lips would be on his.</p>
