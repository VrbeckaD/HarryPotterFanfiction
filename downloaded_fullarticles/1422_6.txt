    <p>He is the one that finds him. He stumbles across something on the worn out floor of the last carriage, almost tripping over. He stares at the empty space in front of his feet, and he knows. There is blood caked on his left cheek, the one facing the floor. A trail of bright red stands out in the flakey brown mess covering his face, culminating in a lone drop just below his ear. He watches as the drop fills until gravity claims it and it joins the sticky puddle soaking the boy’s hair and the carpet. His nose is broken, but that’s something that can be easily fixed. He finally meets his eyes. They are open, wide. Unblinking. The pupils, though, move frantically, the only sign he is alive in his otherwise still body. They are pleading, wondering why he is not being rescued. Why nothing it’s happening. It has been a while, but he can’t get himself to do it. Not yet. He gets lost in the sea of green, once so familiar. They are beautiful eyes, so expressive. He can see it, they are confused now, almost scared. The boy looks so damn young, and it hits him hard. He is tall now, even if a bit too thin his body has almost reached full maturity. But he is just a child, barely more. A boy. And life has been so hard with him already. Those green, green eyes. His black hair, his lean face. He takes all in, all those features he can recall in his mind as if it was yesterday. It’s like coming home, and in that moment all he can think about it is to protect, to shield that boy that is so much the past that he has lost. To hide him away. So he cradles his head gently on his lap, blood saturating his trousers. So damn young. It’s not fair. “It’s ok” he murmurs, delicately pointing the tip of his wand at the boy’s nose. The cartilage straightens, the dirt vanishes. He takes another second to memorise all the details, the subtle dusting of freckles on the upper cheeks, the dark locks seemingly going in all directions and curling gently around the ears. How his top lip was slightly fuller and raised on the right. It had seen them all before, those little peculiarities. But that was a long time ago, when things were good. The boy’s eyes are still now, fixed into his own in question.<br/>
“Finite”.<br/>
Harry sighs in relief, giving him a tentative smile. “Hi. . .thanks. I-“ He starts, but there is no time. He has to do it now. Before other people arrive. Before that known, yet different voice can say too much. Before he changes his mind. Before. . .<br/>
“Obliviscere”.<br/>
The green orbs dim, and the young wizards shakes his head slowly, as if trying to recollect a thought that is just out of reach.<br/>
Then, a silvery light fills the carriage and a majestic Phoenix speaks in Dumbledore’s voice “Have you found him?”.<br/>
He glances at his companion, that is rubbing his forehead in confusion, too addled to even notice the Patronus.<br/>
“No” he replies, tiredly. He is going to regret it. He is going to pay for it. But Harry’s open face is starting to turn wary and there is simply no time for it. He grabs the younger wizards arm and apparates them away. He has a few things to take care of.</p>
