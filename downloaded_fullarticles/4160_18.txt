    <p>
  <span>Newton Scamander bolted upright in bed. It took him only a moment to realise that the cause of his waking was Credence yelling in his sleep again, the scent of distressed Omega filling the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the space of a few seconds for the magizoologist to slip out of his bed, cross the room, and sit on the side of the younger Omega’s bed, hoping to ease him from his troubles before he woke the Goldstein sisters. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The raven-haired youth was curled in on himself, tense as anything, back to the room. Sweat had dampened his sleeping gown, causing it to stick to his back. Newt started by rubbing his neck, trying to see if he would respond.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, ma! I’m sorry!” the boy cried.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt leaned in, hugging Credence as best he could, willing his scent to be calming even as his heart broke for the youth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Credence, you’re asleep.” Newt spoke gently into his ear. “It’s time to wake up, now. You’re safe, I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence jolted as though the older man had spoken a spell to undo his nightmares. He was still curled in fetal position, shaking, though no longer tense.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Scamander?” he whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Credence. I’m here.” Newt assured him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I woke you again, didn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No harm done. It’s alright.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry.” Credence’s voice broke and he began to cry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt pulled him into a better hug, encouraging him to scent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have nothing to be sorry for. We’ll get this sorted out, I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He only intended to hold Credence until the youth fell asleep, but he ended up nodding off not long afterward, his arms still wrapped around his charge until morning.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt was trying very hard to keep himself calm as he dusted the surfaces Queenie had done before leaving to go meet with Jacob at his bakery. It wouldn’t do if Credence could smell his nervousness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As part of his rehabilitation, they were going to have Credence meet the real Percival Graves today. He had been shown Grindelwald locked in his cell through a special mirror, while given a scrap of his clothing to smell so that he would know the difference when he met with the Auror. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>While disguised as Graves, Grindelwald had been using a scent-mask spell. No one had thought this unusual, as Aurors often did this to avoid being found out when their work required them to be undercover or hidden, and thus tended to include the spell as part of their routine before going to work to avoid mishaps. Another reason Grindelwald had managed to so thoroughly deceive them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt had already met with Graves a few times so that he would know what to expect when the older wizard came to meet with Credence. If he was being honest with himself, the real Graves, though still somewhat serious and, well, grave, had a warmth which he allowed to shine when he felt it necessary to put others at ease on certain occasions. Newt had quickly observed that he seemed to make this exception for him quite often.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The thought made his cheeks redden.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a knock on the door before Tina’s voice sounded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Newt? All ready in there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes!” He quickly set the table for tea with a wave of his wand, holding himself only just in time from making the dishes hit the surface too hard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A moment later there was a click as Tina unlocked the door to the flat and walked in followed by her boss, Percival Graves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had put on some weight following his rescue, but still looked thinner than when Grindelwald had been impersonating him, and the shadows were almost gone from under his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Graves.” Newt offered his hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Scamander.” he shook it, offering a small smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” Tina asked. “As we discussed?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. It will be best if you’re both sitting when I bring him in.” He turned to address the senior Auror. “Tina can sit on the side of the table opposite of where Credence will be entering because he’s used to her, now. You, Mr. Graves, will have to sit near the end of the table furthest from him, but with your chair open away from the table so that he can see all of you immediately when he enters. This way you’ll appear as non-threatening as possible. Once I bring him in, you will hand your scarf to Tina and she’ll pass it to me, then I will pass it to Credence so that he may learn your scent.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina and Graves moved to follow instruction. Newt instructed for Graves to leave his hands palm-up on his thighs to further indicate that he was not there to harm Credence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Satisfied with the arrangement, Newt left the room and went to fetch his charge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slowly, with whispered words of encouragement, Newt reappeared holding Credence’s hand, gently urging him into the dining area. Pickett, one of Newt’s Bowtruckles, was perched on the youth’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There, look. Tina is here. And here is the real Percival Graves.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence tensed visibly when he saw the older wizard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No no, don’t be scared.” Newt assured him. “This isn’t the same man you met, remember? Hold on.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned back to Graves and made an indicative sign near his neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Graves removed his scarf slowly, maintaining eye contact with Credence, trying to keep his lips in the tiniest smile he could, to show friendliness without seeming too eager. He extended his left arm, the one holding the scarf, to Tina across the table, who then handed it to Newt, who took it and offered it carefully to Credence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence took it gingerly and brought it very slowly to his face, hesitating before smelling it, as though afraid that it would burn him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When at last he breathed in the scent, he seemed to relax instantly and he breathed it in more deeply.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You smell safe.” he blurted out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a good thing not everyone I encounter thinks that, or I would do a poor job of intimidating law-breakers.” Graves had meant this in jest, but Credence tightened his grip on the scarf out of fear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I going to be arrested?” he asked in a small voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Credence.” Newt spoke gently as he slowly guided him to sit at the opposite end of the table. “That’s not why he’s here. Tina and I explained it to you, remember?” Newt said as he stroked Credence’s cheek.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just want to help you get well, Credence.” Graves said in a soft tone. “The man who was impersonating me betrayed your trust, and the woman who adopted you treated you cruelly. This led to an imbalance of your magic, but none of it is your fault. We’re going to help you so that you may have control of your magic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Silent tears began to track down Credence’s cheeks as he stared resolutely at his lap. Newt had begun to suspect that he’d been taught not to make a sound when distressed. The only time this conditioning broke was during his nightmares. Pickett rubbed at Credence’s cheek, making soothing chatter noises.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The magizoologist wrapped the youth in a hug, guiding him to scent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright, Credence.” he whispered. “It’s all going to be alright, now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Credence?” Graves called softly. “May I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence and Newt looked up. The Auror was holding one hand up in offering. Credence nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slowly, carefully, Graves stood from his seat and walked to the end where Credence sat. He walked slowly, palms in front of him in a non-threatening gesture, trying not to scare the boy. The closer he got, he began to stoop, lowering his height, until he was on his knees in front of Credence’s chair. He took one of Credence’s hands in his, holding it loosely to give the Omega an easy way out. It was Credence who tightened his grip, which slowly melted into Graves holding him, allowing himself to be scented by the young wizard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pickett gave a tiny cheer.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every spare moment he had, Graves visited Newt and Credence. Credence was most responsive when he aided the magizoologist with his animals.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They hold no judgements.” Credence said once. “They’re always happy to see me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m always happy to see you, Credence.” Graves told him, causing the boy to blush.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Progress was made slowly, but surely. Newt and Graves had taken Credence to a wand shop, and he ended up with a fourteen-inch wand made of cedar with a phoenix feather core.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was taught the basic spells to begin with, such as how to unlock doors and levitation. He would be given a series of these tasks to accomplish, and gradually was given new ones, changing the sequence in which to accomplish the tasks. As he moved on to more challenging magic, he started seeming less troubled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I feel lighter.” he declared one day after finishing a series of tasks Graves had set before him. “Like, there was a storm inside me and it’s starting to calm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Obscurus is losing power.” Newt explained to him. “It formed because you were forced to keep your magic from manifesting, and it gradually turned in on itself. It would have consumed you, eventually. But by being allowed to practise magic, you let the charge out, and it starves the Obscurus. One day, it will be no more.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence smiled, almost disbelieving, but hopeful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both Graves and Newt felt encouraged by this. Credence didn’t smile often, but occasions were happening more with each passing day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before he knew what he was doing, Newt kissed his forehead. Credence turned pink, but continued to smile.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was two months later that the other shoe dropped for Credence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt woke up early one morning and the smell of heat permeating the room was unmistakeable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned and saw Credence sitting up, gripping his pillow tightly, biting into it, rocking back and forth in his bed, small whimpers coming from his throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Credence.” Newt called gently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The youth jumped at being addressed and looked at Newt with something akin to fear. He stopped biting the pillow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry Mr. Scamander, I’m so sorry--” he started babbling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shh, no, it’s alright, you didn’t do anything wrong.” Newt slid out of his bed and knee-crawled to Credence’s, staying on the floor. “You’re in heat. Surely you must have experienced this before?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence whimpered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ma said it means I-- I tempt the beast side of men.” He went back to biting his pillow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Credence.” Not for the first time, Newt felt his heart crack in sympathy for his charge. “May I sit beside you? I’m going to explain this to you as best I can.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence nodded jerkily and Newt carefully straightened up to slide in beside the youth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Credence, humans are made up of two primary genders, and three secondary genders. The primary genders are girls and boys, men and women. The secondary genders are Alphas, Betas, and Omegas. Beta boys generally mate with Beta girls to produce pups. In the case of the other two, again, generally speaking, Alphas, whether male or female, mate with Omegas, whether male or female, and this also produces pups. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now, in some cases, an Alpha, a Beta, and an Omega will form a pack. Although less popular today, there was a time when Alphas would take on more than one Omega and the Betas in the pack would help with the pups so that the parents wouldn’t be overwhelmed. Omegas go into heat when their bodies are ready for mating. The scent is to let prospective Alphas know this.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This last tidbit seemed to frighten Credence anew, so Newt rushed to say: </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you don’t have to mate if you don’t want to. You’re certainly not in any position to consent to it with your heat this far. I’ll get you some supplies and leave you some privacy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence shook his head and said something into the pillow which Newt didn’t understand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry?” he asked. Credence stopped biting the pillow again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t leave me alone. Ma would always lock me in a room until it was over. I don’t wanna be alone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt nodded. It wasn’t at all unusual for unmated Omegas to help each other through their heats, and where Credence had only negative experiences associated with his heat, Newt was determined to change his outlook. He had only limited experience with Leta, but it was leaps and bounds beyond Credence’s knowledge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, Credence. I’ll stay. Let me just go get some things we’ll need.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He kissed Credence’s hair to reassure him, then slid off the bed and went to the bedroom door. Upon opening it, however, he found a small mountain of food, pitchers of water, two glasses, and a folded piece of parchment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>We’ll explain the situation to Mr. Graves. Have fun! xox Queenie &amp; Tina</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They had probably smelled the heat through the walls. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt levitated everything inside, then cast soundproofing and scentproofing charms around the room before returning to Credence’s side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, now, Credence. You’re probably much too warm, right now, so let’s get you out of your sleeping gown.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt had to coax Credence to let go of the pillow, then gradually worked his gown off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was hot to the touch, pale skin covered in sweat, his raven hair damp.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you mate me?” Credence asked him in a small voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt smiled softly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not an Alpha, Credence. I’m an Omega, like you. Some Omegas do mate together, and I’m not saying I never would. But that’s not the point of this. I shall be helping you through your heat. Mating is not something to be entered into lightly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Newt was being completely honest, he was becoming very aroused at the heat-scent and as he thought through what to do to help Credence. But this wasn’t for him. It was for this youth who had revealed himself to be extremely kindhearted, in spite of which life had dealt him a cruel hand early on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What I guess I mean is, do you think an Alpha would want me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Any Alpha who’s worth their salt, when they get to know you, I’m sure they would want you.” Newt said, and he meant it. But he felt a sort of possessive fear over the thought of an Alpha coming to take Credence away. He would want to be doubly sure the Alpha would treat him well. Maybe he could sic Graves on them?</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Maybe Graves would want Credence?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It was certainly plausible. The Auror treated Credence very kindly, and even seemed fond of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he showed that same fondness to Newt. And Newt liked Graves, too. But he also liked-- </span>
  <em>
    <span>loved</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Credence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The implications were starting to make Newt’s head spin. These days, it was only very few Alphas who took more than one Omega into their pack.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>A thought for another time.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Newt forced himself to focus on his charge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence was studying him, his eyes travelling up and down the magizoologist’s face and beyond.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be afraid to ask for what you want, Credence.” Newt told him as he cupped his cheek.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Could you, um, uh…” Credence reached forward to tug at Newt’s pajama sleeve.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want me to take my shirt off?” his cheeks burned as he asked. Credence nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt swallowed and undid the first couple of buttons, then reached behind his neck to tug at the shirt and pulled it over his head, dropping it to the floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence’s mouth opened slightly as he stared at Newt, taking in his lean muscles and the multitude of scars. Newt found himself growing self-conscious, but then Credence was leaning towards him. Newt opened his arms to him, and suddenly Credence was pressing up to him as much as he could, scenting desperately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt caressed his arms and back and kissed his hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You smell so good.” Credence moaned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt smiled and blushed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So do you.” he said before kissing his hair again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence pulled back to look Newt in the face. The youth’s hair had grown some, short on the sides where it had previously been shaved clean. Newt gently stroked there on one side, and Credence closed his eyes, leaning into the touch, whimpering softly, his hand drifting down to his member in an almost unconscious gesture as he lightly rubbed it. Newt tried to ignore the feel of his own erection straining against his pajama bottoms and the growing slick near his entrance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Credence opened his eyes again, he looked at Newt, a feverish sort of desperation in his eyes, and he surged forward, pressing his mouth to Newt’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was clumsy and desperate, though Newt wouldn’t claim any sort of mastery in this department. He kissed back, teaching the youth what little he knew, gradually bringing some structure to the act. They pulled back, breathless, then Credence kissed him again, pushing his weight to pin Newt to the bed, and began rutting against his thigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s it, Credence.” Newt urged. “Follow your instincts.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence cried out as he came, panting, his face mere centimetres above Newt’s, a shocked look on his face. Newt felt warmth on his leg where Credence had spurted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“W-wh-wha-what just happened?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You climaxed, Credence.” Newt stroked his hair. “Surely you’ve pleasured yourself during your heats before?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence shook his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ma… she... she’d tie me down.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt guided Credence to sit up again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how do you feel, now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like I want it again!” Credence blurted out. “But I--” he panted. “I want something else, I--” he took a shuddering breath, then turned his back on Newt and presented.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Credence.” Newt whispered, feeling his own slick dampen his pajama pants as he observed Credence’s damp hole.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is how it happens, right?” Credence asked, his voice somewhat muffled with his face pressed sideways on his arms. “I mean, I feel like this is what I’m supposed to do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is the prime position for mounting, yes.” Newt told him. “But I’m not going to do that to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?” Credence moved back just enough to make eye contact with Newt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because as much as you feel you want this right now, Credence, this isn’t the time to be making this decision.” Newt shifted so that he could stroke Credence’s hair. “I can help you in other ways, but for me to mount you is an enormous decision. Even though Alphas are generally the sires, male Omegas are fully capable of impregnating other Omegas, and I’m not doing that to you without you being able to give it some thought.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the mention of impregnation, the wild look returned to Credence’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want that!” he nearly shouted. “I want to make pups for you. I’d take good care o’ them! I’d be real good for you, please!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Credence…” Newt was finding the idea very tempting, and even had a flash of fancy of the idea of perhaps the two of them carrying each other’s young, before shaking the idea from his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know you want it, too.” Credence nearly sobbed. “I can smell you. You want this, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence put his face back on his arms and hoisted his rear again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll hold still. I’ll even be quiet if that’s what you want. Just, please, do something!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will help you Credence, but not like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt kissed his hair, then knelt behind the youth and carefully began circling a digit around his entrance. Credence pushed back with his hips, whining. The hole was fluttering open-shut, open-shut, leaking slick, desperate to be filled. Newt inserted one finger quite easily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence bucked, pushing back, swallowing the finger completely. Newt inserted a second finger and began thrusting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ooh… Mmm...” Credence moaned as he rocked his hips back and forth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Deciding ‘the hell with it,’ Newt awkwardly used one hand to gradually push his pajama bottoms down his hips, working his legs around until he could remove them completely, then took himself in hand, stroking in time to the thrusting of his fingers inside the younger Omega. He added a third finger and curled them downwards towards Credence’s belly, feeling triumphant when, just as he felt the small lump, Credence cried out, clenching around his fingers, pushing his hips back, seeking more stimulation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt carefully eased a fourth finger with the first three, bunching them together as best he could so as to avoid stretching Credence too much, too quickly, though it felt awkward having his fingers in that position; Credence seemed to be enjoying it, however, eagerly thrusting his hips back. After a while of that, when he felt there was enough give, Newt slipped his thumb in under his fingers, and worked to get his knuckles in, a little bit at a time. Credence hesitated over them, but soon Newt’s hand was more than halfway in, and in another minute he was in up to his wrist, Credence nearly screaming with pleasure. When he felt enough give, Newt very carefully maneuvered his fingers, keeping his thumb tucked, until he had formed a fist inside Credence’s passage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From there it was barely any effort at all to get Credence to climax a second time, his shout bursting from his throat, clenching on Newt’s fist before he collapsed from exhaustion, moaning with every breath. Newt finished himself off over the side of the bed, forcing himself to make a minimum of noise. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He waited a few minutes, then withdrew his fist from Credence, who whimpered at the loss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shh…” Newt soothed as he cleaned his hands on the sheets before laying next to Credence and pulling him into his arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sleep for now. When you wake, we’ll have water and something to eat.” Newt kissed Credence’s forehead as they drifted off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sometime later, as they had their lunch, Credence thanked Newt for not mounting him; it definitely required discussion. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival Graves was finding it more difficult than usual to concentrate on his paperwork. He prided himself on dotting ‘i’s and crossing ‘t’s, but he found it just as tedious as any of his co-workers. Not that he would admit that in their presence; he had a reputation as a hard-ass to maintain, after all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But today, his focus kept drifting to Newt Scamander and Credence Barebone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina and Queenie had explained to him that any visits would have to be put off for a few days, as Credence had gone into heat, and Newt was helping him through it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The knowledge that Credence was in heat, and that Newt was helping him, was playing with his imagination.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quiet, fearful Credence, who had been slowly blooming in confidence and magical ability these past several weeks. Pale skin, dark hair, long limbs. It was easy to picture him writhing in ecstasy beneath the ministrations of the magizoologist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tall, lithe Newt, with his gentle manners who was always so quick to ensure Credence’s well-being.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The images came to haunt him again and again, and the auror had already needed to magic away messes from under his desk several times that day, as well as set up a scent-diffusing potion in the corner where no one would notice it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Graves pushed back from the desk and took himself in hand again, his fly still open from the last session.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t worthy of such gentle, beautiful Omegas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he could imagine.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Four days later, Credence was on the tail-end of his heat, but Newt feared that their having lived in close quarters these past few months meant that he wouldn’t be far behind. Omegas who lived together tended to sync in such a way that they were within one month of each other. This was to ensure that, when an Alpha was mated to multiple Omegas, they could be impregnated in turn. He was already not far behind Queenie, and she had had hers not long before Credence did, though she had gone to spend it with Jacob. She was using anti-fertility potions for now, but she and Jacob had already come up with contingencies so that they would be able to start a family under MACUSA’s radar, soon. Tina was a Beta, and thus exempt from this mess of cycles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they had breakfast that morning (Credence was now well enough to go sit at the table), Queenie kept casting glances towards Newt, indicating Credence with an underlying urgency, like she was reading something from him but didn’t want to bring it up, instead trying to get Newt to ask.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, Newt laid a careful hand on Credence’s shoulder and asked him if there was something bothering him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You said that Alphas usually just pick one Omega now.” he said glumly as he fed some pieces of fruit to the Niffler, who had taken to sitting on the table at mealtimes (strawberries generally distracted him from the silverware).</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Most families are based on only two parents now, yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then I don’t want an Alpha.” Credence declared, lifting his gaze and focusing on Newt. “I don’t want an Alpha unless they take both of us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt gave him a smile and patted his shoulder again, but inwardly his heart was sinking. He didn’t want to abandon Credence; that was unthinkable. The hard truth was, the Alphas who still took on more than one Omega were usually those of high society who prided themselves on maintaining multiple Omegas, keeping them fat with offspring as much as they could.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Never marry for money, Newton.</span>
  </em>
  <span> His brother Theseus had warned him. An Alpha himself, as well as an Auror, he had raided more than one household where the Omegas were kept in poor conditions, only kept well-fed enough to ensure healthy pups.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>If some rich Alpha comes offering you the world, little brother, run in the opposite direction.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt looked up suddenly, having smelt a strong wave of annoyance. Queenie was giving him what he had learned Americans called ‘stink-eye.’ Newt frowned, confused. Queenie let her head fall forward, grunting in frustration.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Queenie, just tell him.” Tina said in exasperation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No!” Queenie exclaimed, looking at her sister. “Then it’s not romantic!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This isn’t an Omega novel. It’s the real world, and neither of them would ever figure it out on their own. Just tell him!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aw, come on, Teen!” Queenie whined.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina rolled her eyes and turned to Newt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Graves likes both of you. Queenie saw it when I told him Credence started his heat last week.” She returned to buttering her toast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt choked on his own saliva and coughed, throwing Pickett from his shoulder onto the table. The Bowtruckle shook his fist in annoyance once he found his footing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence seemed confused by Newt’s reaction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t this a good thing?” Credence asked. “He’s always kind to me, and I know you like him, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um, well, yes. It’s just--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just nothing.” Queenie shushed him. “You’d feel too guilty to leave Credence for an Alpha, but you really want an Alpha. And don’t try telling me you don’t like Percy back.” She tapped her temple pointedly. “Legilimens, remember?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You feel sorry for me?” Credence asked, hurt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No! No no no.” Newt was quick to correct. “It’s not that I feel sorry for you, Credence. It’s that I care about you.” He took his hand and gave it a squeeze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He really does, sweetie.” Queenie assured him. “He cares a lot. The good news is, so does Percy. So the next time you see him, the three of you need to have a talk, because he doesn’t think he deserves either of you, let alone both.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just don’t call him Percy.” Tina pointed out. “He hates that. The former Auror director who he trained under called him Percy all the time. When I joined the department, I tried calling him that </span>
  <em>
    <span>once,</span>
  </em>
  <span> because I’d heard the former director use it, so I thought it’d be okay; he nearly growled before telling me to never call him that again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Duly noted.” Newt told her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would he think he doesn’t deserve us?” Credence asked as he attracted the Niffler with another strawberry before grabbing him by the feet and tickling him into releasing the sugar-tongs and a few other assorted utensils he’d managed to pillage during a moment of inattention. “Well, I mean, Mr. Scamander is a brilliant man. But, I’m just… I mean-- wouldn’t it be the other way around? I feel honoured that Mr. Graves would consider me at all. And how Mr. Scamander has done so much for me, I...” he trailed off as he lowered the Niffler into the crook of his arm and fed it another strawberry, pale cheeks turned bright pink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s just the trouble, sweetie.” Queenie told him. “We never feel we’re good enough for those we care about. It’s why a lot of people never speak up and end up missing on chances to be happy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That night, as Credence and Newt climbed into bed (they had pushed their singles together for the duration of the heat and not bothered to pull them apart again), Credence snuggled into the magizoologist’s willing arms. Newt kissed his hair and Credence sighed happily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.” the youth said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For what?” Newt asked him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For finding me. For coming to New York. For being the way you are. Just…” Credence stopped, his lip trembling. “Thank you for existing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt felt his cheeks burning as he pulled Credence closer and pressed his nose into his hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> for existing, Credence.” he whispered. “I am truly honoured and delighted that you would want to be in a pack with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could feel Credence flush where their cheeks were touching and kissed his hair softly.</span>
