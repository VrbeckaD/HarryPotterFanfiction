    <p>It was a normal night halfway into the summer before his eighth year at Hogwarts when he was woken up by a strange pain shooting through him. He sprang up in bed and let out a hollow scream, his skin felt like it was being ripped apart. </p><p>In fact it was being ripped apart, he looked down at his arms to see Navy blue flowers wrapping their way around his arms he could feel them sprouting in his hair as well. Before he knew what was happening his world was going dark. He saw Blaise and Pansy run over, the three friends had been staying in Snape's house since their parents had either fled the country or been sentenced to death after the war.</p><p> When he woke up the next day he was in bed at St. Mungo's, Pansy was sitting in a chair next to his bed clutching tightly to his hand. He saw the flowers still wrapped around his arms and didn't recognize them. "Baby's breath. Navy blue." A woman clothed in healer's robes said and Draco’s heart twisted painfully.</p><p> He was only 17, flowers were not supposed to sprout until you were 18 at the youngest. It was common knowledge that you only got an early sprout one of two ways, either your soulmate was older than you or they had died. The healer looked over at Draco and waved Pansy away.</p><p>She took Pansy’s seat and put a hand over Draco’s own, much paler, hand “Don’t worry, it’s unlikely that someone as young as yourself has a passed soulmate.” She tried to sound hopeful but it was just as rare to have a soulmate so much older than you, his soulmate would have to be at least 22 and normally they were only a year or two apart. </p><p>He smiled nonetheless trying to make his heart calm. The Healer stood up and smiled at him sadly “you will be allowed to leave in about an hour; we just have to run some more check ups. Please render not to pick or scratch at the flowers, they are a part of you until you meet.” she reminded him and swept out of the room.</p><p>Draco let out a long, pained sigh, he looked down at the small deep blue flowers wrapped around his arms. He knew they were on his scalp as well but he didn’t have to see those ones. </p><p>Pansy walked back into the room, with Blaise close behind her. Pansy took the seat again and pulled Draco into a hug “Oh love, what are we going to do with you?” she asked and Draco chuckled.</p><p>“Do they really look that bad?” she joked and Pansy laughed, this is how he wanted things to be. He didn’t want the pity from strangers or for things to suddenly be different. He simply wanted life to continue on like normal, he wanted to be stared at in the streets because he had fucked up his life own life, not because his soulmate was dead. Well was probably dead. </p><p>“They looks great you big drama queen, bring out your eye color. Now when can we get out of this hell hole?” Blaise looked around the room making Draco chuckle. </p><p>“About an hour, though if you simply can’t wait another second i suppose i can survive without you.” Pansy snorted and covered her mouth, laughing annoyingly was often frowned upon in hospitals. </p><p>The group talked quietly for the hour, never bringing up what Draco would do now, just accepting that he looked like this now. When the healer came in and release Draco he left with his friends planning a good shower, he silently wondered if he’d have to buy some special shampoo for the flowers in his hair, as well as some actual decent sleep. </p><p>When they made it back to Snape’s hut Draco did just that. He took a warm shower figuring out that, the flowers were stronger than they looked but still definitely gentle. He then collapsed onto the small overly soft bed and fell asleep for a good hour or so, wondering if his soulmate could just be alive still. </p><p>Meanwhile at number 12 grimmauld place, Harry has woken up with a weird pain on his back and shoulders. At first he just assumed he had slept wrong, than he caught sight of himself in the mirror and fell onto the floor. He had flowers growing on his shoulders.</p><p>Not only that but they fucking hurt, he had to hold back a scream as another few pushed up from his skin. He threw himself out of bed and went to go find someone, anyone who might know what the fuck was going on, weird wizard shit. </p><p>Harry pounded on the door to Ron and Hermione's room, he’d been living with the couple since the beginning of summer since they both needed some time away from the burrow. </p><p>Ron, his hair ruffled from sleep and deep bags under his eyes opened the door, ready to yell at harry for being so obnoxious. He stopped short when he noticed the dark blue snapdragons growing from his best friend shoulders. </p><p>“Oh bloody fuck!” Ron screeched. This was just one of those things all young wizards knew about and they often forgot that muggle born wizards didn’t have the same knowledge of this. </p><p>He wrote a quick note to Hermione, not wanting to wake her, and took harry to St. Mungos, just avoiding a passed out Malfoy. </p><p>He got Harry into a hospital ward pom and began explaining the situation to him while they waited for the healer. </p><p>By the end Harry looked utterly terrified, he had a soulmate. Not only that but they were probably fucking dead. Just his luck right? Oh and just to make everything better he’d be a walking garden for the rest of his life. </p><p>The healer came in minutes later, a tall skinny man with a permanent frown. He once again told harry the situation and did a few checks making sure the flowers were growing normally and gave him a potion for the pain of the flowers sprouting. </p><p>They went back the grimmauld place and harry collapsed onto the couch next to a. very concerned Hermione. She had read Ron’s note and had immediately began pulling out books to research what she could do to help. She didn’t learn much before basic information that Ron had been able to tell him. </p><p>Much like Draco, Harry was just exhausted. There was just something about having fucking flowers grow out do your skin that left you mentally and physically exhausted. After a good shower, to get off the pollen and sweat, he fell back into bed sleeping hours past noon.</p>
