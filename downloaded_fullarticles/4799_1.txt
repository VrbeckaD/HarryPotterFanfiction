    <p>The first time Walaburga Black struck Regulus he was five. Him and Sirius had been in the street playing with the Muggle children. He'd never seen her so angry before. He never wanted to see it again. </p>
<p>But he did. Regularly. Usually at Sirius. But sometimes at him too. When he's step out of line. Start acting too much like Sirius. Shed throw hexs and shout about duties and family honor and shame. </p>
<p>They'd have to sneak their fathers wand to reverse the hexs she'd land. </p>
<p>The year of Sirius's first year at Hogwarts was... strange.<br/>
There was less yelling. But more lectures about pride and honor and what would happen if he wasn't a slytherin punctuated with over powered stinging hexs to the cheek. </p>
<p>He'd never longed for Sirius more. Sure, he sent letters. Told him of his new friends. Which was wonderful! He was so happy for Sirius. But he wouldn't dare to ruin his school year with his nonsense complaints about their mother. He'd just never had to deal with it alone before. He cried most nights. </p>
<p>His left cheek was bright red when they (Regulus and Kreacher) picked Sirius up at the station. (Mother said he'd gotten lazy) but his smile was bright enough for Sirius to overlook it. </p>
<p>Things got better once he started school. They only went home for the holidays. He'd never been happier. </p>
<p>Things got worse after Sirius left. All the attention was on him. He was to be heir now. He was to make the black family proud. He had to have good grades. He had to look correct. He had to become a deatheater. He had to make them proud. </p>
<p>And he did. He did nothing but study (even when the calmness that would be death beconed to him) he styled his hair. He pleged himself. </p>
<p>He hated himself. </p>
<p>When he entered that cave he knew he'd never leave. And he was okay with that. He'd made them proud. They'd never know.</p>
