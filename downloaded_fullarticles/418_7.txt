    <p>Clarisse was awoken by the sunlight drifting in through the open windows of her bedroom. </p>
<p>She sighed happily as she sat up. It was once more time to go back to Hogwarts. Time to see her friends. Time to see her D-. Draco. Time to see Draco.</p>
<p>Rising out of her canopy bed, Clarisse quickly slipped on her warm fur slippers. She padded her way over to her bay window. </p>
<p>Unusual for England, the sun was shining brightly. Poking her head out into the morning air, she could hear the birds chirp &amp; could smell the morning dew. A sign, she decided. A sign that today was going to be a great day.</p>
<p>She looked around her room. This would be that last time she would see it for a while.</p>
<p>The pink room was a place of comfort. Somewhere she often retreated when she felt like she had no control; when she felt like she couldn't breathe. </p>
<p>There was her vanity, where perfumes, jewelry, &amp; beauty products were perfectly arranged in a way that looked elegant, yet effortless. </p>
<p>Then there was her bookcase dedicated to her antique teacup collection. Each so tiny &amp; dainty, but nonetheless intricate. Each was a piece of art. Clarisse had collected teacups from all over the world. Places she had been, places her friends &amp; relatives had been. </p>
<p>There was her ornate canopy bed, drowned in pinks, creams, &amp; ivories. Her travel cases sat piled high at the foot of bed. They had been packed for days now. Clarisse had had the girls over to sort through what wardrobe pieces were needed for the fall &amp; what were not. Daphne Greengrass &amp; Pansy Parkinson were her best friends in this world. Closer than friends, they were more like family.</p>
<p>Of course, those were just the girls. Her clique extended further than that. </p>
<p>In pureblood society, children tended to be raised within a circle of families, who had children of a similar age. Most stay close with this group &amp; this group alone. A way to preserve the culture. Although, this doesn't always work. As evident of the removed Black heir, Sirius Black, who had now become a cautionary tale told to pureblood children of what happens when you forsake your blood &amp; duties.</p>
<p>Clarisse, being the daughter of a deep bloodline, was brought up with others from prominent pureblood families. Specifically, the Zabinis, Notts, Parkinsons, Greengrasses, &amp; of course, the Malfoys. Blaise, Theo, Pansy, Daphne, &amp; Draco were her people. Her forever group. A constant.</p>
<p>"Mistress Clarisse," her house elf, Tilly, appeared. In her small hands, she held a fresh cup of tea. Peppermint, her staple flavor. </p>
<p>"Thank you, Tilly" she said, reaching for the intricate cup, which was a pale blue with pink &amp; white flowers. "Ah" Clarisse sighed, smelling the relaxing scent. She smiled down at Tilly, "You always make it so perfect".</p>
<p>The house elf blushed &amp; twisted her hands into her little apron, which acted as her uniform. She looked down. "Mistress is too kind."</p>
<p>Clarisse took a sip of her tea, before setting it down on her in-table. She dramatically threw her body backwards into her bed. "I just don't know what I'm going to do without you this fall, Tilly."</p>
<p>Tilly had never just been a servant to her. Tilly had been the one to take care of Clarisse whenever she fell &amp; scraped a knee, or whenever her parents stabbed her with their harsh words &amp; judgments, or whenever she had one of her fits.</p>
<p>Clarisse often felt suffocated in her life. She just tried so so hard, but it was never enough. Not to who it mattered, not to her mother. She was either too demure or too loud, too read or too dimwitted, too polished or too lax. </p>
<p>It had always been bad, but as Clarisse grew older, so did her parents' standards.</p>
<p>She didn't want to fail them, she hated the idea of failing them. Any minor slip-up or imperfection made her stomach twist into knots &amp; on the bad days, she would end up crying on the floor. The bad days, what she had begun to she call her fits, those had started this summer.</p>
<p>She knew this was bad, wrong even, so she did what she could. The peppermint tea, it helps. Clears her head, helps her stay calm.</p>
<p>She would deny this if ever asked, but secretly Clarisse thought that leaving home for school would help too. </p>
<p>Later, she sat on the stool of her vanity. Clarisse had traded in her baby pink silk pajamas for a simple Parisian white dress, which had been gifted to her. Arranging her "not quite blonde, not quite brown" hair, she decided to add a ribbon to accentuate the waves she had spelled in. </p>
<p>A knock hit her door.</p>
<p> "Enter." Called Clarisse, who was busy painting her lips with a pale gloss.</p>
<p>Her mother stood there in all her glory. Blythe Fawcett was a woman to be reckoned with. Hair perfectly pinned into wavy updo, she looked every bit the heiress that she was. </p>
<p>Her mother was the definition of poised. She drew every eye in the room &amp; knew just how to use that attention to her advantage. Her very being demanded respect.</p>
<p>Clarisse didn't know whether she wanted to be her mother or wanted to hate her. In truth, she knew neither was possible.</p>
<p>Her mother looked her up &amp; down. Clarisse took in a breath. After what seemed to be ages, her mother, who had let a small smile take over her face, said, "It's time we leave. Don't forget your coat."</p>
<p>As Clarisse moved to pass her in the doorway, her mother stroked a hand through her hair. She wasn't sure but it had seemed loving.</p>
<p>                                    |~~&lt;&gt;~~|<br/>As per usual, Platform 9 3/4 was hectic &amp; crowded. </p>
<p>Clarisse walked with her shoulders high &amp; eyes forward. Ladies did not gawk, even when chaos was going on around them. </p>
<p>Up ahead, she caught a glimpse of platinum hair. There were only two people she knew with that color hair &amp; she loved them both deeply. </p>
<p>The blonde shifted &amp; Clarisse was able to see the long tresses shine in the light. A smile broke out across her face. Daphne then.</p>
<p>Clarisse glanced up at her mother, who had taken to walking beside her. She looked into her eyes, silently asking permission. </p>
<p>After a minute, her mother nodded. She placed a hand on each of Clarisse's shoulders &amp; leaned in to kiss each cheek.</p>
<p>They made eye contact. "You won't disappoint me, daughter, will you?" </p>
<p>Clarisse determinedly lifted her chin. "Never."</p>
<p>Her mother released her shoulders. "Good," she says, smiling, but the this time it reached her eyes. </p>
<p>One last glance over, her mother brushed an invisible hair off Clarisse's coat, before turning on her heel &amp; walking away.</p>
<p>Clarisse let out a deep breath.</p>
<p>Continuing in her path, she made way towards where she thought she had seen Daphne.</p>
<p>The air was thick with excitement &amp; anticipation. Clarisse slipped between children, fretting mothers, &amp; seemingly bored teenagers.</p>
<p>Some of them looked away from their business &amp; saw her. With wide eyes, some looked envious, some looked annoyed, others looked with judgement. Clarisse knew her affect on people. Her face, her attire, her last name. They held power. Meaning.</p>
<p>They all saw what they wanted to see. A pretty girl. A spoiled brat. A classmate.</p>
<p>Daphne had her back turned to her. She was bent over, fixing someone small's coat. Ah. Little Astoria. That's right she's entering Hogwarts this year.</p>
<p>Daphne straightened &amp; laughed at something Astoria had said. </p>
<p>"Daphne, my darling!" Clarisse hooked her arms around Daphne's right elbow, hanging herself off the taller girl's arm. </p>
<p>Daphne's dark green eyes glistened. "Clarisse!" she squealed, albeit softly as was ladylike.</p>
<p>"Can you believe it?" Clarisse sqeezed Daphne's arm. "We're third years."</p>
<p>"I know! We're practically all grown up." Daphne turned to Astoria. "It's time for you to run along Story, we're going to go find the others."</p>
<p>Astoria nodded her head of brown curls. The sisters had different hair colors, but they both had the Greengrass emerald eyes. </p>
<p>Certain pureblood families were known for being carriers of dominant genes for specific traits that made them instantly recognizable. The Malfoys, for example, bore children with platinum blonde hair, so pale it was almost silver. The Greengrasses had their eyes.</p>
<p>Astoria cheeks were slightly flushed. She was nervous.</p>
<p>Clarisse gave her a smile. "Don't worry little Greengrass, you'll do fine at Hogwarts. Just stick with your group." She paused. Looking at Astoria from under her lashes, she goes, "but if anyone gives you trouble, you come find your sister, me, or one of the others."</p>
<p>There was no need to specify who she meant by 'others'. The group had been inseparable from birth.</p>
<p>The younger Greengrass shuffled away with her shoulders slightly hunched over. She would learn.</p>
<p>"Ah remember when we were little nervous firsties." Daphne said, shaking her head amusedly. </p>
<p>Clarisse scoffed, "I don't remember you ever being nervous Daphne."</p>
<p>Daphne Greengrass has been bubbly &amp; outgoing ever since she left the womb. The perfect little socialite.</p>
<p>"Well," Daphne paused. She flipped her hair over her shoulder, "I guess that's true."</p>
<p>The two girls laughed &amp; made their way towards the train.</p>
