    <p>Book pages, sepia coloured accompanied with the must from years of idleness on the shelf. Brows furrowed as quills scratched on parchment before coming to an abrupt halt. The atmosphere was still, like witching hour on an early Monday, except from the odd muttering which would compare to the buzzing of distant cars. Remus was hunched over a library book, his quill left discarded as he rubbed his two index fingers on each of his temples. Potions. He read the same chapter once again, squinting this time thinking it may lead to a moment of revelation on the difficult brewing of Felix Felicis. Don't be mistaken, Remus Lupin was one of the brightest wizards in his year, below Lily Evans of course (a muggle-born witch). Despite this, Remus had received more than he'd bargained for when deciding to take Advanced Potions coming into his 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p><p>His essay (or the beginning of it, anyway) sat adjacent to the book, curling at the sides slightly after being pressed flat by a rather frustrated Lupin. Ink splotches littered the parchment, like the holes in his knowledge visually represented upon it. Why did I ever listen to that stupid careers advise? He thought to himself as he picked up the the once abandoned quill, dipping it in a pot of ink. He scratched angrily, feeling quite derailed by his lack of intelligence on this subject. <em>You'd be a great Auror Mr Lupin!</em> they said. <em>Take advanced Potions!</em> they said. He continued to beat himself up inside his head over nothing but a small mental blockage (a rather bad habit of his), scratching out his once opening paragraph and writing, Felix Felicis, also known as Liquid Luck is a complex magical potion in which-</p><p>"GET BACK HERE! ALL THREE OF YOU! NOW!"</p><p>Remus glanced up, rather unfazed by the voice bellowing in the corridor outside the library. He sighed, looking down at a badge pinned to his jumper. The words Prefect were printed on it in a deep crimson. Debating whether it was worth the effort, and then realising he wasn't getting anywhere with his essay, rolled his eyes and lifted himself out of the chair with his hand on the desk. He strode over to the large oak doors and walked into the middle of the hallway. Nothing. The corridor was empty, the bricks tinged gray with age, the low winter sun shining through the battered window. Perplexed by the serenity of it all after the loud exclamation, he turned on his heel back towards the library entrance. That's when he heard heavy footsteps at the end of the corridor.</p><p>Three young boys skidded around the corner, laughing loudly. James Potter, a boy about the same height as Remus, with messy jet black hair and round circular lensed glasses came belting down the corridor. Peter Pettrigrew ran at his side, squealing like a child. A small mousy haired boy with a plump figure and a rather  disproportionately small head sat on top of it. Sirius Black, by far the most good looking of the three (Remus' own opinion, though he'd never admit it), sprinted a few paces behind. His dark hair down to his shoulders, wind swept as he charged, with deep penetrating grey eyes catching Remus standing in front of them.</p><p>"MOONY!" He shouted running quite intimidating towards Remus, despite the huge grin on his face. Jumping in the air, he clicked his heels before they reached Lupin in the middle of the no longer deserted corridor.</p><p>"Moony! Come on!" He exclaimed before grabbing Remus by the arm without stopping his stride. "Padfoot what's going on? Why are you running? I-"</p><p>“No time for questions my dear Moony!" Sirius said without glancing back.</p><p>"But my essay and my bag! They're in the library, let me just-" Remus said pulling against Padfoot's grip, staring longingly at the library entrance.</p><p>They reached the end of the corridor, Sirius still gripping Remus as he stumbled behind. The soles of his shoes scraped the floor, leaving black skid marks. Remus glanced behind him and saw a Slytherin Prefect stomping towards them, red in the face. Actually, now that he came close to them, he could see that the redness was accompanied by large boils scattered across his face, pulsating slightly as he walked. Remus gasped before Sirius whipped him around the corner, blocking him from sight.</p><p>They carried on running, Sirius still gripping Remus' wrist as they went. They weren't slowing down anytime soon. Gleams of sunlight broke the window panes, creating dancing patterns across the concrete floor. They passed each one, coming in and out of the beams as they turned into another corridor which was occupied by second years leaving their Charms class. "OUT OF THE WAY, MARAUDERS COMING THROUGH!" James yelled as several of the younger students dived out the way, causing some of them to collide and topple over each other like skittles in the muggle sport bowling.</p><p>Sirius had let go of Remus' wrist due to the commotion and he slowed down, starting to apologise to one of the second years who shouted "Watch it!" as James pushed past. But not before long Sirius ran back and grabbed his arm again, tugging him whilst saying "Moony come onnn". Remus let out another sheepish apology to the younger student before letting Sirius drag him again around another corner.</p><p>They reached the portrait of the Fat Lady, skidding on their heels after the sudden stop, "Password?" Asked the Fat Lady, raising her eyebrows in suspicion at the four out of breath sixth years.</p><p>"There isn't time for a bloody password! We're Gryffindors quite clearly, let us in!" James shouted, bent over double clutching his left side.</p><p>Remus, who was also panting heavily, rolled his eyes at his friend (yes, why he was his friend, he didn't know) before gasping, "Dilligrout" and snatching his arm out of Sirius' grip rather belligerently. "That's more like it." Said the Fat Lady passive aggressively as she swung open her portrait. They clambered in one by one before flopping on a dusty sofa opposite the fire.</p><p>The common room was dimly lit, the only source of light coming from the fire, various candles scattered around the room and the winter sun protruding through a foggy window. Scarlet banners hung from the walls and ceiling, baring a large golden lion roaring. A few students sat in the far corner working on what looked like homework. If only that was still me Remus thought, glancing over at them. The common room was empty for the most part as majority of student had classes at this time. But because they were sixth years, they had free periods to roam the castle without the shackles that was a full timetable.</p><p>Remus, suddenly realising what had just occurred sprung to his feet, scowling at the three of them. "May I ask what on <em>earth</em> just happened?" He asked, folding his arms, his prefect badge glinting as he did so. m</p><p>"Prongs cast a pimple jinx on a Slytherin prefect. He didn't even see it coming." Sirius said grinning, high-fiving James.</p><p>"And on what planet did you think that would be good idea?"</p><p>"Oh come on Moony, loosen up a little. It was just a bit of fun!" James pressed. He looked over at the other end of the common room before turning to Remus again, "Or is your superior status not allowing you to have any of it?" Remus rolled his eyes for what felt like the hundredth time that day and glared at James. "I think my definition of fun is very diff-"</p><p>"Moony you should've seen the look on his face, Prongs' jinxing skills are amazing!" Peter interrupted, who was taking longer than the rest of them to catch his breath.</p><p>"Alright Wormtail, don't wet yourself with excitement now." Sirius chuckled, glancing up at Remus. He sighed, before flopping back into the sofa next the his three best friends, stretching his legs out, which just reached next to Sirius'.</p><p>"I hate you guys, you really are idiots." Remus muttered.</p><p>"We love you too Moony" Sirius said, putting his arm around his shoulder. Remus felt an unfamiliar feeling in his stomach.</p><p>"And I swear to Merlin if I get another weeks worth of detentions because of you three-"</p><p>"MOONY!" They all cried in unison.</p><p>Remus couldn't help but laugh a little, Sirius' arm still round his shoulders.</p>
