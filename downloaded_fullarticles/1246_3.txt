          <div class="userstuff"><p>Damien jerked awake in his seat when he heard what sounded like a car backfiring in the other room. Or maybe it was a gunshot? It was the latter that made him wary. Extracting himself from his desk chair, tangled with his headset cable and blanket, he grabbed the gun he kept strapped to the underside of his table and went to the door. </p><p>Glancing around the corner, he could hear a strange rattling sound? and noticed what looked like a small mountain of coats and blankets that was slightly dripping onto his admittedly dirty carpet. </p><p>“Hold it,” Damien aimed his gun, but the person didn’t listen at all, spinning around to reveal… “Blaine?” </p><p>“S-s-s-irius?” </p><p>“Who?” </p><p>“Wait-t… D-d... Damien, right-t-t?” </p><p>That’s when it finally clicked for the man and he lowered his gun. “Harry!?” </p><p>… … … </p><p>So, slowly apparating across the ocean absolutely sucked. It sucked bollocks. It sucked Satan’s bollocks, or Mordred’s bollocks, or something. It was just really, really bad. </p><p>The first few jumps had been just fine. Harry had to rest once he got to Prince Edward’s Island. He ate a huge meal, using the cash he had been given by Charles’ and Pam. The food was different, but at the same time, familiar? Either way, it was delicious and heavily fish based. </p><p>It was once Harry got to Greenland that he started to have some troubles. He misjudged the jump from Torngat National Park and landed waist-deep in snow. Immediately throwing on some warming charms helped to melt the snow--that’s when Harry realized he’d taken a chunk of ground with him, oops, and dug himself out. </p><p>Now wet, shivering, and exhausted, Harry decided to transfigure himself a little hollow with the snow around him and curl up for a nap. </p><p>He woke up to find himself buried in snow. A tempus charm revealed ten hours had passed since he arrived in Greenland. </p><p>“The fuck?” Harry grunted, hardly able to move. Taking a moment to zip himself tighter into both the jacket and the sleeping bag, he wriggled a bit and then apparated to the surface. </p><p>At least he thought it was the surface.</p><p>He misjudged and went rolling down the side of his little hole for about 3 meters before he finally stopped. </p><p>Harry groaned and wiggled some more to get his arms free. After eating some energy bars, he didn’t bother moving and just apparated from where he was to Iceland. </p><p>Taking a giant pile of snow with him. </p><p>He kind of passed out on the spot. </p><p>At least he woke up faster than the last time he’d… tripped… after his body decided an apparate was one too many. The knowledge that Harry only had two jumps left helped to push him to full consciousness, scarf down two more energy bars, and then apparate to Scotland. </p><p>He landed in a fucking tree. The branch he was on broke and he tumbled to the ground and sighed. Of course, the forest was different than he remembered because he was in a different fucking universe. </p><p>Harry sighed, still wrapped in his coat and sleeping bag. He glanced to his left and saw what may have been castle ruins, but at the moment, he really didn’t care. </p><p>Forcing himself to his feet, Harry clung to his wet sleeping bag and disappeared. </p><p>When he reappeared and had a gun pointing at him, it was just the icing on this shit fuck of a cake. </p><p>Yeah, there was a gun in his face. </p><p>A gun. IN HIS FACE. </p><p>What an unfortunate series of events.</p><p>… … … </p><p>“Ff-f-f-f-fffucking Greenland,” Harry mumbled around chattering teeth, shaking in the seat Damien had forced him into. “Should have realized doing other magic would fuck up the apparation…” He had a blanket wrapped around his shoulders because even though it was the beginning of May, England was drafty. Or at least Damien’s place was. Despite the man walking around without bottoms on. </p><p>That had been a sight. Sirius Black holding a gun in just boxer shorts and a hoodie. Except it wasn’t Sirius Black. This was Damien White and he was now Harry’s older brother. </p><p>“Maybe the cold had something to do with it too. You look blue,” Damien handed over a cup of hot chocolate, which he had contemplated spiking, but decided against it. Pam already disliked him enough without him getting her new son drunk. </p><p>“Literally blue, or metaphorically blue?” quipped Harry, taking a big swallow of his drink and shuddering. </p><p>“Literally. Metaphorically I’d say red. With anger.” Damien smirked and sat down. Thankfully he’d put trousers on when he went to make the drink, and now Harry could enjoy his warm beverage without the awkwardness of a man running around in his drawers, even if it was his own home.</p><p>Harry snorted at the joke because laughing required the body to be capable of exhaling steadily and he was shivering way too hard for that to happen in any respectable manner.</p><p>“Yeah, anger… anger is right,” Harry paused to take another huge gulp of the hot chocolate. Even here, chocolate was like some kind of magical fix-all and he was feeling better already. </p><p>Damien observed him and leaned back into his chair across from the teen. “Want to complain about it?” </p><p>“Complain?” </p><p>“Yeah, it’s like talking but with more cursing.” </p><p>Harry laughed, starting to feel warmer. “I misjudged a few of my jumps--you. You know what those are, right?” </p><p>“Yeah, Charlie told me about it.” </p><p>“Well, okay. I misjudged them. I fell asleep in a Greenland, the trip over the water took a lot out of me. And when I woke up, I was covered in snow.” </p><p>“Wait wait,” Damien held up a hand. “‘I was covered in fucking snow.’ Try it like that.” </p><p>The wizard laughed some more, now that he could, and nearly finished his hot chocolate. “I was covered in fucking snow,” he repeated dutifully. </p><p>“Much better. Continue.” </p><p>“Well…” </p><p>… … …</p><p>“So, why did you pull a gun on me?” The pair were in the kitchen. Harry insisted on cooking. It was like some weird coping mechanism, to feed those who were taking care of him. He blamed Mrs. Weasley. And just thinking about her made him miss his world… </p><p>But, no. Shake off the melancholy Harry, this was his new life now. </p><p>“What?” Damien was washing the dishes almost as quickly as Harry could make them. It was weird, for someone to do that for him. </p><p>“The gun. You had a …” Harry gestured ineffectually. “You had a gun.” </p><p>“Oh.” Damien paused for a few seconds, just thinking that over. Then he shrugged. “I always keep a gun in my office. In my line of work.” </p><p>Harry looked at Damien out of the corners of his eyes. “What do you do exactly? Hacker?” Not that he was 100% sure what that was. </p><p>“I work for MI6. Do you know what that is?” </p><p>A moment. Then Harry shook his head. </p><p>“Honestly?” </p><p>“Yeah, I haven’t been in the Muggle world since 1991.”</p><p>Damien looked at him incredulously. “I’m pretty sure MI6 started before then.” </p><p>“Yeah, but I was a kid. Why would I have ---what even IS it?” </p><p>“Do you know the FBI? CIA?” </p><p>“Yes, those I’m familiar with.” </p><p>“It’s like that.” </p><p>Harry considered and then turned away from his pot of food. “You’re a secret agent?” </p><p>The man at the sink struck what he thought was an epic pose. Harry laughed at him. </p><p>“Mean,” Damien dropped the pose and went back to cleaning. “But yeah, basically. I don’t go into the field and track down people. I’m just a man at a desk.” He shrugged, setting a dish onto the rack to dry. “I hack things, but for the government now.” </p><p>Unsure of himself, Harry hesitated before asking, “What is hacking?” </p><p>Once again, Damien paused in thought. “You really don’t know?” After Harry shook his head, he added, “Kid, we’ve got so much more to teach you than just algebra.” </p><p>… … … </p><p>And that’s how Harry’s days turned into an endless cycle of perfecting Occlumency, and then going through Muggle school books, then back to make sure he was doing his Occlumency correctly, and back to Muggle studies. </p><p>It was a terrible routine and before Harry realized it, it was June. Bored, sitting at a desk in the same room as Damien, he looked up at the man who had just finished doing some business with work. </p><p>“Why do you let me stay in here?” Harry asked once the man had hung up and took off his headset. </p><p>“What?” </p><p>“In here. While you work. Why do you let me stay? Aren’t you worried that I … I don’t know, that I’ll overhear something that I shouldn’t? Speaking of, you work for the government. Isn’t finding someone who can do real magic something you should be telling your... your boss or something?” Harry built up steam as he was talking, going from his hunch of studying to upright with indignation. </p><p>Once the teen wizard had stopped speaking, Damien asked, “Are you done?” Harry nodded. “Okay, good. Listen up here, Glinda, one of the reasons I let you stay here is because if anybody needs to learn how to keep secrets, it’s you. </p><p>“The second reason I let you stay,” Damien counted off on his hand, “is so that I can help you if you have any questions, and if I don’t know the answer my 5 computers are right here to help us out.” </p><p>He smirked at the teen now and leaned onto his desk to get a better look at him. “The last, and most important reason is that you’re family. Nothing is more important to me than family and you and Reggy are it. Well,” Damien waved a hand, sitting back in his chair. “I have other people too, but you two are my brothers! Nothing is more important than that.” </p><p>Harry sat with his mouth hanging open for a while, just numbly blinking at the man. Then, “Did you call me Glinda?” </p><p>“That’s all you got out of that?” </p><p>“No, that’s just what I’m addressing first.” </p><p>The pair shared a chuckle. </p><p>“Glinda, the good witch from the Wizard of Oz,” began Damien. Harry nodded--he knew who she was. He understood that reference. “Because you’re a wizard.” </p><p>“But she’s a girl. And a witch. I’m a wizard.” </p><p>“It was just meant to be funny, move on.” </p><p>“Alright, moving on. I understand what you mean about me having to learn how to keep secrets,” Damien nodded this time to Harry’s words. “The Occlumency helps with that. At least the book says it will. I knew someone who was basically a double agent and he could lie to the most powerful, evil man ever.” </p><p>“Your Dark Lord, who you defeated before coming here.” </p><p>Harry nodded. “Lied straight to his face. I saw him do it.” </p><p>Damien’s entire face was a question mark. </p><p>“I’ll explain later.” </p><p>“You’d better.” </p><p>“Anyway, questions. I haven’t asked you one yet.” </p><p>“Doesn’t mean I’m not waiting, brother mine,” Damien flashed him a smile and Harry flushed, totally unused to being referred to so casually as family. </p><p>Swallowing to try to get that blush under control, Harry nodded, “All right, got it. Ask more questions.” </p><p>“Please do. I have five computers, plus two laptops here, and yours is on the way.” </p><p>With his mouth open to address something else, the teen stopped and stared. “You got me a laptop?” </p><p>“Of course, what self-respecting teen with rich parents doesn’t have a laptop?” </p><p>Once more Harry’s mouth flapped helplessly. </p><p>“Come on, Harry, this is nothing for someone like me. I rarely spend my money on stuff. Except computers” </p><p>Slowly, the wizard nodded, face red all over again… and he gave a shy little smile. </p><p>Unable to resist the urge, Damien got up and went over to the teen and ruffled his wild hair. </p><p>“Come on, it’s time for a break from your schoolwork. Time to get back to your education on the 21st century. I know Blaine will have the music completely covered by the time you get back, but I’m going to cover everything else.” </p><p>And before Harry could complain more, he was pulled out of the room. </p><p>… … … </p><p>Standing in front of this building was kind of terrifying. </p><p>“Catch.” </p><p>Harry yelped when something shiny was tossed towards him and he caught it on reflex. “Damien! This is a cell phone! You don’t just throw these around!” </p><p>“Why not? I knew you’d catch it. You have the best reflexes I’ve ever seen, and that’s saying something, considering who I work with.” </p><p>He gave a little nod when Damien said that, then looked at the phone, turning it around in his hand. It was different from the one that Blaine had--this one all screen, where Blaine’s had been half keyboard. He turned it over, curious as to where they’d put the keyboard, but didn’t see one and it didn’t have seams that would indicate it would open. “What kind of phone is this?” </p><p>“The new iPhone 3GS. It’s a few days early, but I called in a favor.” Damien was smirking. “Think of it as a reward for doing well.” </p><p>The teen groaned, dropping his head back. “Now I’m going to bomb them and I’ll have to give this back.” </p><p>“You don’t have to give it back, Harry. Every teen should have a phone. Besides, this way you can call me when you’re done.” </p><p>“You’re not sticking around?” asked Harry as he poked at the screen with a hesitant finger. He unlocked it easily, thankfully, but it was just… all screen. </p><p>“Nah,” Damien waved him off, “I’ve got shit to do, and you’ll be here for a few hours.” </p><p>“Ugh,” groaned Harry, “Don’t remind me.” </p><p>“It’s just your GCSEs.” </p><p>“THAT’S!” he started by yelling but his instinct to not draw attention to himself made him drop the volume to a hiss, “that’s exactly the problem! The only things I have even a little confidence in are languages and maths! And I still have no idea why maths is so bloody easy!” </p><p>“Maybe because you’re smart?” Damien offered, dropping a hand onto Harry’s head and ruffling his hair forcefully. “Calm down. You’ll do great. And if you don’t do great? We’ll take ‘em again.” </p><p>“You say ‘we’ like you have to sit in there with me,” Harry snarked back, but then his entire being deflated, and he shoved the phone into his pocket. “I still don’t understand why I have to take them here. I’ve done everything else at your flat.” </p><p>“It’s all part of the experience.” </p><p>“You’re a git.” </p><p>“Yes, but I’m your older brother. I’m supposed to be a git, now go, before you’re late.” Damien waved his hands to shoo Harry along.</p><p>“They start when I get there, this is a special test you organized just for me.” </p><p>“Indulge me, won’t you? This is my version of dropping you off for your first day at school.” Damien asked, pushing Harry towards the building. “You have everything? Pencils, notebooks, lunchbox?” </p><p>The wizard rolled his eyes, hefted his messenger bag which did include a lunch, and left. Damien shook his head and got into his car and drove away. </p><p>… … … </p><p>The tests were really hard. Harry dragged his rotting carcass out of the room and pulled out his phone. He had a few false starts since he had no idea how to use this thing--at least it was pretty intuitive. The thing that looked like a phone was the call button, Damien’s name was in his phone as Mr. Grimm. (Harry had learned that this name was Damien’s handler name, derived from his old hacker name. He used to leave a calling card that had a picture of a Grim Reaper reading a newspaper that said, “You’ve been hit by Grimm News”. Harry thought his new brother was an absolute nerd.) The call button was green, and green meant go. </p><p>Stumbling down the steps of the building he’d taken the tests in, he finally found a bench and collapsed, head in one hand, the other holding his new phone to his ear. He could hear it ringing. </p><p>“Talk to me.” </p><p>“I hate you so much,” Harry replied when Damien answered. “That was four hours of hell. Not even my OWLs were this bad, and I had a fucking vision in the middle of my history test.” </p><p>“Oh pft, it couldn’t have been that bad.” </p><p>“It could be and it was and I hate you. I don’t know if I want to be your brother anymore.” </p><p>“I’m pretty sure you don’t have a choice in the matter,” laughed Damien. Harry could hear traffic in the background. “I’m about ten minutes away,” the man said, anticipating Harry’s question. </p><p>“I’ll just sit here and melt into the bench.” </p><p>“You’re being melodramatic. Not even Blaine is this melodramatic.” </p><p>“Well, I’m not Blaine.” Harry attempted to hang up on Damien but he failed a couple of times and heard the man laughing at him. That was ten minutes of stewing in an embarrassed-state. </p><p>When Damien pulled up, he was driving a different car than before. After nearly six weeks with the man, Harry didn’t question it anymore. </p><p>“Get in, Glinda, we’re going shopping.” </p><p>“Shopping? Damien, no, you’ve bought me too much. First the laptop, and now this cell phone…” Harry shifted uncomfortably, but at the look Damien gave him he got in and buckled his seatbelt obediently. </p><p>“I’m your older brother. I haven’t taken care of you for fifteen years. It’s my duty to spoil you now.” </p><p>Harry gave him a weird look; they were rarely that open about the ‘cover story’ but then Damien mouthed the words ‘go with it’ and the wizard realized something was up. Maybe the car? “I know, but still…” </p><p>“No buts! You have like 3 shirts and they’re all just your old uniform. You can’t keep borrowing my medieval hand-me-downs. Now, shopping.” Damien stepped on the gas.</p><p>That was a strange lie, but Harry let it go. Though, he did only have three shirts. They were Blaine’s. It’s possible that Harry and Damien were supposed to go shopping a lot sooner than now. Or that he was supposed to be back in the USA. He hadn’t had that much contact with them since he left. </p><p>With that thought in mind, Harry opened up the phone again and found Blaine’s number already programmed in. A few minutes of single finger poking got a simple “Hi its harry” sent off. The series of rapid fire messages he got in reply should have been expected. </p><p>

    <i>The three were in the car together, driving out of the city and into the countryside. Harry had lost count of all the different cars Damien drove, and the intervals in which he had them varied. More than once there had been a weird handoff of keys out in public, which Harry never questioned but he was deathly curious about. </i>

    <i>Surprisingly, once, Harry had forgotten his new messenger bag in the backseat of one of their vehicles. It was cool, and burgundy, and leather, and Harry loved that bag. But he’d forgotten it like a dolt. But, three cars later, it was waiting in the passenger seat for him, with a new book inside. It was creepy. But the book had been good. </i>

    <i>“Why do I have to go?” Harry said in a copy of Blaine’s best whine. He was slouched deep in the back seat, fiddling with his phone. He was a lot better with it now. Blaine had got him to sign up for an AIM account, which he vaguely understood was a chat program, and they sent text messages through AIM. Somehow it didn’t run up Blaine’s bill as much as international text messages did. Damien explained it, but it was so tech-term heavy that it went in one ear and out the other.</i>

    <i>One of the coolest things he got was a leather bracelet with the White family crest etched on a piece of square metal. The family words, embossed on the inside of the cuff, were oddly fitting: Loyal unto Death. Harry put it on immediately.</i>

    <i>The weirdest gift had been from Uncle Barry: a set of green horse bridles. Reginald took them from Blaine after the card was read through by the man. “Looks like you’ve got your own horse, Harry. The mare you rode before, Bella.” Harry had been stunned. And then he’d started laughing. </i>
