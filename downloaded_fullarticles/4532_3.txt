    <p>Remus Lupin’s Guide to <strike>Being a Werewolf </strike><strong>That Time of the <strike>Month</strike></strong> <em>Moonth</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Written in plain English so even the most <strike>idiotic</strike> <em>handsome</em> wizards can understand it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chapter One: Transformation            <strong> How many chapters is this going to be, Moony?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Werewolves transform when the moon rises and the light touches their skin, regardless of what time of year it is. This means that in summer, they can transform when the sun is still in the sky. If the moon never touches their skin, they will still transform, but it will happen later. The transformation is <strike>uncomfortable</strike> <strong>excruciating, you mean</strong>, but werewolves heal a lot faster than ordinary wizards in order to cope with it. It is easier to transform the younger you are, perhaps because children’s bones and muscles are more flexible than adults.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Transformation usually takes less than a minute and the wolf <strike>doesn’t notice the pain</strike><em> is extremely crabby when he first transforms</em>. When the wolf transforms back to the man, however, he is burdened not only by the discomfort of the transformation, but also any injuries he sustained along the way. When a werewolf is alone, they have no one to bite and scratch but themselves, which is <strike>of course preferable to them biting and scratching other people and allowing the infection to spread</strike> <strong>awful, and not to be tolerated</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chapter Two: Werewolf behaviour</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When isolated, werewolves are destructive to their environment and themselves. During my own transformations, I have covered myself with many scars and broken the rooms I have been confined in. I’ve pulled up floorboards, broken down walls and reduced furniture to nothing. When kept in a simple concrete room, the damage to myself was worse and my fingers have broken from the effort to escape. <strong>Damn, Moony, we can’t make a joke on this one.</strong></p>
<p>Werewolves have no interest in animals. Once, as a child, my father gave me a cat to take into my room, hoping that I might injure it rather than myself, but when I emerged, the cat was fine. As it was a failed experiment, my father got rid of the cat, but I have to wonder if it may have improved my transformations as my later experiences did.</p>
<p>Because of their lack of interest in animals, Animagi are also safe from werewolves. Not only is a werewolf less likely to bite or scratch them, only attacking if provoked, the bites received do not have the power to transform the Animagi. <em>I swear I like my steak rarer now, though. </em><strong>You’re full of it.</strong><em> You just never get bitten! </em><strong>Nobody’s getting past my majestic antlers!</strong></p>
<p>Of course, most Animagi would not confront an ordinary wolf, either, so they’d be <strike>mad</strike> <em>handsome</em> to confront a werewolf.</p>
<p>When in the company of animals and Animagi, the werewolf transformation is a lot easier. The man can hold onto his mind easier, remembering events from his time as a wolf, and has some control over his actions. Of course, he is still driven to bite humans, so should <u>never</u> be released from his confines, <strike>even under Animagi supervision</strike> <strong>unless under the amazing protection of the most clever</strong><em> and handsome </em><strong>Animagi in the land.</strong></p>
<p>It should also be noted that the company of other people/animals seems to make the post-transformation ‘hangover’ a lot more tolerable. <strong>Told you he only lets Padfoot on the bed because it’s good for him.</strong> <em>I dare you to try getting on the bed as Prongs.</em> <strong>I’m not an idiot, my antlers will get stuck in the hangings.</strong> <em>I’ll give you all my dungbombs.</em> <strong>Maybe …</strong></p>
<p>Chapter Three: Behaviour during the rest of the month</p>
<p>Werewolves are basically the same as normal wizards for the rest of the month. They feel a bit unwell in the lead up to the full moon and need time to recover afterwards. They heal faster than usual. They have better sight, smell and hearing. <strong>Which he tells us now, not last week when he somehow knew about our plans to break into Slytherin and paint it red and gold.</strong></p>
<p>
  <em>They like chocolate far too much and think that a cup of tea will fix anything. They read when they should be having fun. If you get their books wet or dog hair on the bed, they get cross, which is cute, but if you go too far in a prank, they just get disappointed, which is much worse than when a regular old wizard is disappointed in you. They are morning people, except around the full moon, and are entirely unsympathetic to those who are not morning people. They couldn’t catch a Quaffle if their lives depended on it. They’re rubbish at Potions, but annoyingly good at everything else. They always win at card games. They do the best pranks when they can be persuaded to join in.</em>

  <strong>Moony, Padfoot’s writing you a love note!</strong>

<p>
  <em>Pssshhh this is just how werewolves are, I’ll show you a love note!</em>
