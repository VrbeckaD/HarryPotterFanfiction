    <p>Draco,</p>
<p>Have you recovered yet from the party? I’ll blame Blaise for the fact that it’s been 2 days and I still feel like there’s a herd of Hippogriffs stampeding through my brain. Please remind me to never again accept any sort of bathtub liquor from him. (The guy is an absolute menace and as his best man, I’ve decided it’s your responsibility to rein him in. I’m running interference between the mothers and keeping them both away from Ginny and it’s exhausting. I’m going to need a holiday after this wedding.)</p>
<p>Hermione Flooed me a little while ago to tell me that Ron hasn’t left their bed since they got home Friday night. Blaise and him broke into a “special” batch of that whiskey and I don’t want to ask where he brewed this one. (Is there such a thing as toilet brewing?) Have you heard from anyone else? This weekend has been far too quiet for my comfort. Though, it could just be because the party was a cracking success. It seemed like everyone had a great time. </p>
<p>Though… I’m wondering if you noticed the looks Luna kept sending Pansy’s way when she thought no one was paying attention? I’m pretty sure Pansy was into it. Did she say anything to you? I’ve been thinking about it since I got home and I think they’re rather well-suited. Care to have a bit of fun? I know how much you love to meddle in your friends’ love lives, and I need a distraction from all the <strike>maid</strike> ‘man of honour’ duties Ginny keeps throwing at me. I swear she has to be making up half of them. </p>
<p>Anway, if you’re interested, I was thinking of inviting them around mine for dinner this weekend under the guise of planning the stag and hen parties. I’ll cook if you supply the drinks? (If I ever recover enough to drink again) How’s Thursday?</p>
<p>-Harry</p>
