  <strong>Chapter 1 - Please Drink Your Potion</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Knock, knock, knock.</em>
</p><p>Three taps on his door at three in the afternoon. Granger. Draco quickly put some of his research into a drawer.</p><p>“Come in,” Draco called picking up a quill and dragging over some papers that he needed to sign for the department head, he also unlocked his door</p><p>“Honestly, Malfoy,” Hermione admonished as she entered, “I have other patients, you know. I can’t be visiting you in your office when all the others have to come to me.”</p><p>“Ah yes, but the others don’t make significant donations to St Mungo’s. Have you improved the new batch at all? The last batch made the flavour worse,”</p><p>“Medicinal potions aren’t meant to taste good. They’re meant to help. But nothing I can find help reduce the bitterness caused by the aconite without rendering it ineffective. You know this Draco.”</p><p>“Mhm,” Draco replied, feigning inattention by pretending to read some of the paperwork in front of him. Ignoring Healer Granger was one of his favourite past times these days. “So, it’s the standard wolfsbane this week?”</p><p>“Yes,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes. They had this conversation regularly. “Since last month was a failure, and I would even go so far to say it made you worse, you are to take Belby’s standard. Like usual, every other month, and next month you’ll make me give you an alternative that doesn’t work as well. Why do I have to explain this every time, Malfoy?”</p><p>“Because the monotony of inane conversation drives you up the wall, and I require entertainment,” Draco replied dryly, a smirk on his smug face as he made eye contact with Hermione for the first time since she entered his office. Another thing that he found annoyed her,</p><p>Hermione scoffed, “do you really think it’s a good idea to irritate the person responsible for giving you medication? I might kill you on purpose,”</p><p>“Nonsense, Granger, you love it. Besides, you almost kill me every other month, so I figured I would get something out of this arrangement, apart from experiencing your lovely bedside manner of course.”</p><p>“Here’s your potion. Just take it, so I can go back to work.” Hermione sighed, producing a goblet with blue steam wafting from liquid inside of it.</p><p>“Hmm,” Draco mused, examining the perfectly produced potion, “I may be going away on a trip soon that will overlap with the next month, and I won't be able to return here for you to administer the potion. So I’ve arranged to have you accompany me on my trip,” He explained casually as if he were talking about the weather.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Hermione almost shouted, “You can’t just -”</p><p>Draco held up his hand, “You’ll find I can just, Granger, I’m the benefactor of the research ward you work in and I’ve spoken to your supervisor about this already. I’m a werewolf, and I need wolfsbane potion, and I have the means to pay you for your time while I’m away working. You can sightsee or whatever you want to do between brewing time.”</p><p>Hermione bristled, her hair puffed slightly in her indignation, which delighted Draco a little bit. Her cheeks even burned red. Draco tried to hold in a laugh at the sight. While Hermione was trying to come to terms with her working holiday, Draco stood from his chair, potion still full o the table knowing full well she can’t leave until she sees him take the potion, and walked around to the other side of his desk, where Hermione stood glaring at him. He walked up and brushed some hair off her forehead.</p><p>“Don't be angry with me, Healer Granger, I need your help,”</p><p>He held eye contact, he fingers in her hair, for slightly longer than necessary until her gaze softened a little, her cheeks red for a different reason.</p><p>Hermione sighed. “Damn it, Draco. You don’t have to behind my back and go directly to Copper, you could have asked me first, you prat. That cheap tactic won’t work on me forever you know,”</p><p>“But this way is much more fun,” Draco smirked, stepping back a little to lean on edge of his desk. Hermione stood eyeing him warily now.</p><p>“You’re one of my most exhausting patients,”</p><p>“Admit it, you love me,” Draco teased,</p><p>“Never. Now hurry up and take your potion so I can talk to Copper about this forced holiday, hmm?”</p><p>“I’m thinking this trip should be settled to go after this full moon, and we should be gone for a while, maybe three months, so you should tell your friends.”</p><p>“Three months? Next week? Are you kidding me?”</p><p>“You need to be more flexible, and we’re going someplace interesting, I think you’ll learn some new things,” he offered</p><p>“Yes, yes, fine. Now please drink your potion so I can go and prepare for this thing you’ve decided to drag me along on, ok?”</p><p>“That’s the spirit! We’ll leave the day after the full moon.”</p><p>“You really like stressing me out, don’t you?”</p><p>“I live for it, Granger,” Draco raised the goblet as a toast and tried to drink it all in one gulp. He shuddered as it truly tasted like the bitter floor of Moaning Myrtle's toilet. Handing the goblet back to Hermione, he smiled at her, “See you tomorrow, Healer Granger,”</p><p>“Yes, Mr Malfoy, and every night until the full moon. Thankfully I won’t need to keep you under observation this month as we know the standard works well for you,” Hermione said.</p><p>“Such a shame, I do so love your company” Draco replied neutrally,</p><p>Hermione eyed him warily, casting him a frosty “See you tomorrow,” before she turned on her heel and swiftly exited.</p><p>As she shut the door behind her, Draco sighed to himself and sagged forward as he sat on the edge of his desk, his left hand rising to his forehead. He gave himself a few moments behind he straightened himself up, hands fixing his hair, straightening his jacket, then returned to his chair behind his desk, locking and warding the door and pulled out the files he hid when Hermione entered, he had a few more equations to triple check and some engineering on his time turner to finish before next week.</p>
