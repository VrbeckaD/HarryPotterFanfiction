  <em>We were too young, to know we had everything. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Too young, I wish we could have seen it all along. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'm sorry that I hurt you, darling. </em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Remus was sitting in his favorite chair, reading his favorite book, snuggled in his favorite blanket, an owl came. Sirius' owl to be exact, and so that alone was enough to make his heart soar.</p><p>
  <strong>Moony,</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Hiya. Are you going to Harry's birthday party? I could use someone sensible to talk to ;). Miss ya Moons, hope to see you. (Even though I saw you 4 days ago.)</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Yours,</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Padfoot</strong>
</p><p>"Yours", he was at one point, until the war took its toll. Countless things were lost because of the war though, so many things. </p><p>
  <em>
    <strong>Padfoot,</strong>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <strong>Why do you even have to ask? You know I am. 1. I love Harry. 2. James and Lily would hex me if I didn't</strong>
  </em>
  <em>
    <strong>. I will be there. Miss you too, Pads. <strike>Always.</strike> </strong>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <strong>Moony</strong>
  </em>
</p><p>Remus sighed as he sat back down, Sirius always made his heart race with even the most simple of things: even still, after all this time of being broken up. Funny enough, right when Remus was about to have a pity party for himself he heard, <em>Hello? Rem? It's Mary! Unlock your door you tosser! </em></p><p>As he opened the door, Mary flung herself at him and Remus took her in his arms. </p><p>"You lanky git! I've missed you!" She said into his shoulder.</p><p>"Oi! Who you calling lanky? Missed you too, Mary. How was the trip?" Remus said brightly. Mary made Remus feel light and happy, even just being in her presence. </p><p>"Amazing, glad to be home though. You're going to Harry's birthday party, yeah?" She asked, following Remus into his living room and taking a seat on the couch. Remus lived in a muggle flat, but it was connected to the Floo, Mary lived a few blocks away. Not too long ago, it's where he and Sirius lived together.</p><p>"Of course I am. I haven't seen Harry in about a week and I already miss that lad. James and Lily too, I suppose." Mary laughed.</p><p>"Eh. Harry's the reason we all still hang out with them, let's be honest." She joked.</p><p>"How was your trip, really? Are you... feeling... better?" Remus asked, suddenly much more serious. Mary looked up, tight smile on her face.</p><p>"Look, I won't lie. I wasn't doing well at first. But then I thought... Ok, would Marlene want me to be there, on a beautiful beach, in our favorite place, and be miserable? No. So I got over myself. I went to all our favorite spots and I cried a bit, but happy cried. I feel better. Thank you."</p><p>"Thank me? For what?" Remus asked.</p><p>"For convincing me to go. It was a good idea, I needed it. It's been 2 years and it was time to make my peace with it." Marlene was killed 2 years ago while on a case. She was an auror, and was tracking down a Death Eater who they still hadn't caught. James was her partner at the time and they had split up. She found him, but before she could capture him, he killed her. James walked in as it was happening and stunned him. </p><p>"You're so strong Mary. She'd be so proud of you. I know I am." He sat down next to her and wrapped her in a warm hug. Remus grabbed the remote and turned the telly on. They sat comfortably, Remus' arm around her and her leaning on his chest, for a long time until someone popped in the Floo. </p><p>"Moony!" It's Sirius. He and Mary sat up quickly, startled by the intrusion. "Sorry. It's... it's important." He said glumly, looking down.</p><p>"Not Harry..." Remus asked, scared of the answer.</p><p>"No! No! Gods, no! Er... Peter. He's um. He's got a trial next week. They say they may let him out."</p>
