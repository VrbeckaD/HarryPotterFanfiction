  <i>July 31, 1980</i>
</p><p>A woman was lying in a hospital bed screaming profanties loudly while gripping her husband's hand as she pushed her soon to be newborn out of her body. She was tired and in pain, but that didn't stop the excitement from seeping into her expression as she have one final push and soon the sound of a crying baby was heard in the newfound silence of the room.</p><p>Lily J. Snape n√©e Evans and Severus Tobias Prince-Snape were now the proud parents of a young Hadrian Lyle Severus Prince-Snape. Hadrian was taken by nurses to be cleaned and wrapped in the standard hospital blacket before being handed back to Lily and Severus.</p><p>They watched with adoration as Hadrian shifted around and cried as he got used to no longer being in his mother's womb. Severus stroked Lily's hair as they watched their boy open and close his mouth, getting used to the feel of his body.</p><p>They both took in every detail of his face. His lips were the same shape as Lily's, and he had the same crooked nose as Severus. He had little ears that were his own, and chubby little hands that flexed and relaxed as he used his newfound muscles.</p><p>A doctor walking in distracted the both of them from noticing the opening of their boy's dual coloured eyes. Hadrian yawned, closing his eyes once more and falling asleep. They talked calmly with the doctor for a while before being allowed to leave with a newly sleeping Hadrian.</p><p>When they arrived home they sat on the couch in the family room with Hadrian in Lily's arms. Hadrian slowly started waking and drew the attention of both adults to him. His eye lids fluttered as he opened them for the second time that day, only this time both of his parents saw his eyes.</p><p>His right was a bright, beautiful emerald green with a strikingly silver ring around the outside of it, almost perfectly matching Lily's. His left, however, was a dark, coal black and looked exactly like Severus'.</p><p>To say Lily was shocked would be an understatement. She and Severus were captivated by the beautiful eyes. Lily, however, was completely floored by the realization of her boy's future.</p><p>He was born to the side of the Dark Lord in the fight that consumes all of the wizarding world of Britain. She tensed. What could she do? She didn't want to lose her baby to the wrong side of the war, but she didn't want to lie to him either. Thoughts racing through her mind a mile a minute, she slipped on a facade.</p><p>She would need help if she was to protect her boy from the Dark. ...She would also need to leave Severus. If he found out that his son was born into the Dark he would return to his Lord's side, and he would want to take his son with him. Wouldn't he?</p><p>'Yes, he would. He would have every reason to go with his son to the Dark...' Lily thought, making up her mind as she laid with Severus and Hadrian for the last time, all of them together.</p><p>Lily couldn't let that happen. She couldn't let her son fall into the hands of Lord Voldemort. She wouldn't let him, he deserved a better life than that. She couldn't stay. Hadrian especially couldn't stay.</p><p>That night, Lily obliviated Severus and Hadrian and gave Hadrian a sleeping draught before running off to the one man she believed she could trust in this situation.</p><p>Dumbledore.</p>
