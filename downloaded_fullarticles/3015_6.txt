    <p>Although the Dragon Sanctuary will always be his home, Charlie still enjoys his trips back to the Burrow, and he always will. It is nice to see his mother and father, his brothers and sister, and the never-ending number of nieces and nephews. </p><p>	It is a bit too much, sometimes, though. As the trip always seems to start with a sibling and a spouse, faces shining, smiles beaming, sticking a new baby under his nose. “This is Dominique,” they would say, or “This is Albus,” and Charlie would wonder how it would be possible for so many people, so many children, to exist. Charlie would be happy to meet them, of course, and a part of him would be teary-eyed. Babies were wonderful, after all, just like baby dragons. But he would also feel a stab of anxiety in his stomach, and he would have to grin it away. “He is beautiful,” he would say, and the ritual would be complete. </p><p>	This time, he is presented with Hugo, who is a cute child, and well behaved. Charlie cradles him gently in his arms and wonders what kind of person he will grow up to be. Will Hugo be straight-forward and sarcastic like his father, or intelligent and compassionate like his mother? Or, perhaps, he will be neither. People have a habit of forgetting that is an option. </p><p>	“Hugo is such a wonderful child,” Charlie’s mother says, as if she hasn’t said that about every grandson and every granddaughter. Charlie makes a face at his nephew and watches Hugo squeal in delight. He prepares himself for the inevitable. He reminds himself that he is happy. </p><p>	“So, Charlie, are you dating someone?” his mother asks, right on que. And Charlie responds, “No, I’m too busy at work at the moment.” He feels his heart clench, because he is both telling the truth and lying at the same time. It is exhausting. But now, with the ritual complete, he leaves his mother behind and carries Hugo off to the garden. It is beautiful outside, and Charlie would never understand why everyone is eating their food inside. It is suffocating. Charlie always feels like he is suffocating. </p><p>	There is a bee collecting nectar from a flower. Charlie watches it and rocks Hugo against his chest. Bees are amazing creatures. They pollinate the flowers while collecting nectar. They ensure the survival of their species, and their young, while doing a great service to the world around them. People could argue that Charlie is doing nothing to promote the survival of his own species. He has no children. He is single. He will always be single. This fact will never change.</p><p>	“Do you think I’m selfish?” he asks Hugo, but Hugo is sleeping now. Charlie sighs and watches the bee fly away. He must be full of nectar. He must be going home.</p><p>	“You know, I was lying to your grandmother,” he tells Hugo, as he watches Hugo sleep. Sometimes, Charlie feels like he keeps too many secrets. Sometimes, Charlie talks to himself in the shower. He admits all his stress, all his fears, while he squirts shampoo into his hair. “But I was telling the truth at the same time. It’s confusing, isn’t it?” And he sighs again. </p><p>	There is a garden gnome, now, in the garden. Charlie watches him sneak in from the corner of his eye. He pretends not to notice. He has never liked throwing the gnomes over the fence. He admits to Hugo, “We are really busy at the Dragon Sanctuary. We have 5 new baby dragons. We have never had that many newborns at the same time.”</p><p>	Everywhere Charlie looks, there seems to be babies. Charlie sighs and cradles Hugo closer to his chest. It will become tiring holding him in this position. Charlie suddenly wishes for a sling. He could try to transfigure one, but he doesn’t trust his own abilities. Not when it comes to a child’s life. </p><p>	“However, we are not so busy that I couldn’t date. I have time to sleep, to eat, and to partake in hobbies. I just choose not to.” </p><p>	He usually sews a little bit every day before bed, as a sort of stress-releaser. He could go on a date, instead, if he wanted to. But that wouldn’t be stress-releasing. That would be stress-inducing. Charlie can already feel his heartrate rising at the thought. But that’s not the point, is it? Charlie is always trying to escape the point, even in his own head. </p><p>	“It’s not because I’m afraid, or I’m worried about rejection, or anything like that. I have never been interested in dating. I have never looked at a human being and wanted to date them or experience being with them. Not once,” he admits to Hugo. It’s a big underwhelming, when it’s stated like that. You would never guess that it was the secret that haunted Charlie’s dreams, gave him anxiety, and left him alienated. But that’s because he’s not telling Hugo the full story. Once again, he’s lying yet telling the truth. </p><p>	There are five gnomes in the garden now. Charlie watches them in alarm. He wonders if they realize he doesn’t like to throw them over the fence. That he is the most sympathetic Weasley. They probably do realize it. Non-human beings are always smarter than most humans give them credit for. Charlie has never understood why this is something other humans can’t comprehend. </p><p>	“Do you want to hear my story?” he asks Hugo. Hugo is still sleeping, and of course he doesn’t care. But Charlie is old and tired. And so, he decides to tell the story anyway.</p>
