    <hr/><p> </p><p>“Draco, darling, will you come sit with me a moment?”</p><p>Draco looked up at his mother from where he was playing quietly with a toy wand. He was ten years old.</p><p>“Of course mère.” He stood, working to maintain the regal bearing his father had been teaching him. He settled himself down primly next to her, taking in her sad smile as she brushed the hair from his face.</p><p>“For more than 1,000 years, the Malfoys have been blamed for darkness and trouble. It is in the name after all.” She sighed.</p><p>“Is that why people hate us so much?” Draco queried innocently.</p><p>“They don’t hate us, sweetheart. We just make them a little nervous.” She paused, looking out of the window of Draco’s playroom. “It began with your ancestor, Maria. She fell in love with a muggle, and when she was found out by the local villagers to be an unwed, pregnant witch, she was banished to a lonely island off the coast of France.”</p><p>Her blue eyes were pained as she gazed down at her son. She hated having to tell him, but Lucius refused, convinced that the curse had been broken or never existed, but she couldn’t allow her precious Draco to live in ignorance.</p><p>“She waited for her lover to rescue her, but he never came. No one came. In a moment of despair, on All Hallows Eve, she cast powerful wish magic upon herself so that she would never again feel the agony of love.”</p><p>Lucius had told her the old story after they had wed and were trying for a child. He had thought it an amusing anecdote, but Narcissa was a Black, and Black’s knew the power of scorned women, knew the power of blood. So, she searched through the Malfoy family histories and found an alarming truth. One of every generation was cursed, irrespective of gender, their partner would die after producing an heir.</p><p>“As her bitterness grew, the spell turned into a curse, a curse on any who dared to love a Malfoy.”</p><p>She knew she did not have much longer, Draco would be going to Hogwarts soon and the curse would drag her down. She and Lucius had fallen in love, and because of that, because she had made Draco, she knew her time was drawing to a close.</p><hr/><p align="left">It was the middle of November during Draco’s first year. He had been settling in well with his house mates and classes, the only sore spot was his continued animosity with Potter. He had only ever wanted to be the other boy’s friend, had been looking forward to meeting him for so long. But then Weasley had gotten in the way and everything had been ruined. He couldn’t help but try and gain his attention any way he could, even if it was negative, it was better than nothing.</p><p>He was sitting down to dinner when his father strode into the hall. He was as immaculately dressed as ever, but Draco immediately knew that something was wrong. While his hair had been tried back neatly, it was dirty. There were dark smudges under his fathers eyes, and a sallowness to his skin.</p><p>Draco rose as his father strode up to him, reaching out to grasp Draco’s shoulder tightly, staring down at him for a few long moments. He felt his Head of House and Godfather appear behind him, ushering the pair to his office.</p><p>“Draco, I am sorry, I have some bad news.” Lucius eventually choked out.</p><p>Draco exchanged a worried look with Snape. “What is it father?”</p><p>“It’s your mother… She…”</p><p>He was alarmed to see tears swimming in his father’s eyes. Immediately he <em>knew</em> something was very wrong. He flashed back to that quiet conversation he had had with his mother a little more than a year ago. It had been such an odd conversation, so very out of the blue that he had never been able to forget it.</p><p>“She’s dead isn’t she?” He was surprised at how calm he sounded. Coldness spread out from his heart, numbing his hands.</p><p>“Yes, I am so sorry Draco, it is all my fault.” Lucius collapsed into the chair usually reserved for students while Draco stood rigidly by Snape’s desk.</p><p>“I know. You should have believed.” Draco replied, missing Snape’s wide eyed stare as he also sat in his chair.</p><p>“I heard the deathwatch beetle ticking for her. I refused to believe the silly old story, but I was wrong! She was out riding and the horse must have spooked, she fell and hit her head…”</p><p>Draco had never seen his father so distressed. Nothing touched his heart though, he felt dead inside. His beloved mother was dead, dead because of a family curse his father refused to believe in.</p><p>Well he wouldn’t make that mistake.</p><p>“When is the funeral?”</p><p>“This weekend,” Lucius finally looked up, eyes tracking to his long time friend Severus. “Will you bring him? I will owl you the details when they are finalised.”</p><p>“Of course Lucius, anything you need. I am sorry for your loss.” Snape murmured.</p><p>“Was there anything else?” Draco asked after a few moments of silence.</p><p>Lucius and Snape both looked at him with wide eyes.</p><p>“I have homework I need to do.” Draco continued when they didn’t say anything.</p><p>“Draco, please.” Lucius lurched up, attempting to catch him in a hug but Draco shied away.</p><p>“She is dead because of you.” His eyes were grey chips as he glared up at his father. “If you will excuse me, I have homework.”</p><p>He turned and left the room.</p><hr/><p align="left"><em>‘I hope I never fall in love.’</em> The thought echoed through his head for weeks after his mother’s funeral. He never wanted to condemn someone to an early death. He never wanted to do what his father had to do.</p><p>It took time, but eventually he found a way to summon up a true love spell called Amas Veritas. He knew that love was always possible, so if he summoned something impossible, he would never have to worry.</p><p>“He will hear my call a mile away.</p><p>He will hum my favourite song.</p><p>He can ride a hippogriff backwards.”</p><p>Draco already knew that he preferred boys to girls, which was good considering he would have to marry a woman to produce an heir.</p><p>“He can flip pancakes in the air.</p><p>He’ll be marvellously kind.</p><p>His favourite shape will be a star.</p><p>He will have one green eye and one blue.”</p><p>For a moment he thought of Potter, but he knew that Potter had green eyes, so there was no risk there.</p><hr/><p align="left">He felt a mild flutter of alarm in third year when they had a class on hippogriffs, somehow, when Hagrid had hoisted Potter onto the beast, he had ended up backwards, flying around the school. Draco reminded himself that Potter didn’t fit the rest of the criteria, so dismissed the worry, accidentally getting himself hurt in the process.</p><hr/><p align="left">Voldemort Returned.</p><p>The war happened.</p><p>His father died during his fifth year, at the Department of Mysteries. He was practically kidnapped by his aunt and forced into service to the monster that had taken over his home. Everything was tainted with the Dark Lord’s touch and he had no escape, no reprieve.</p><hr/><p align="left">Somehow, he survived.</p><p>He survived not murdering the Headmaster and the punishment that followed. He survived Potter turning up with his lackeys in his home and lying about their identities. He survived Potter dying, or not dying for that matter, in the forest and lying to the Dark Lord about it.</p><p>He survived the final battle and the trials that followed. He managed to come through with his fortune mostly intact, and began working tirelessly to repair his damaged reputation.</p><p>He was approached about two years after the war by Lord Greengrass. The man expressed an interest in creating a union of their families, to strengthen the business ties they already had. His youngest daughter, Astoria, was willing to marry.</p><p>They had been a few years apart at Hogwarts. Daphne, the eldest and heir to the family had been in his year. He had helped Astoria over the years as a prefect and with her homework as a fellow Slytherin. They had gotten along relatively well, as well as he did with anyone else from his house.</p><p>Knowing all of this, knowing that the chances of him falling in love with her were slim, he agreed. Draco did need an heir; he was the last of his line after all. He hoped that he might find a friend, a companion to remain by his side for life. He hoped that he might find contentment, or happiness.</p><hr/><p align="left">It took a year to plan the wedding and iron out the marriage contract; he happily left most of the planning for the event to Astoria whom he had found a fast friend in. She was very forward thinking and encouraged him to look outside the magical world for business ideas and investment opportunities.</p><p>In no time at all he grew to appreciate her brilliant mind and sparkling wit. He was still very gay, but Astoria was understanding, and they took potions to ease intercourse in order to produce an heir. He would take a potion to assist with performance, she to increase fertility.</p><p>They made sure to write into their marriage contract that once an heir had been produced, fidelity was not required. When Astoria fell pregnant two years after their wedding, they both breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>He did tell her about the family curse, but assured her that while he might grown to feel affection for her, as she was a woman he would never be <em>in</em> love with her. She shrugged, and smiled, patting his hand and assuring him that no matter what, she knew their life together would work out well.</p><hr/><p align="left">The years slipped by and he found happiness. Draco had everything he could hope for and more. He had gained a best friend and a life partner. Scorpius was perfect, in the absolutely imperfect way that children were. He and Astoria both took lovers on the side occasionally, but their friendship remained a solid base for their lives. When their lovers grew frustrated over their unwillingness to leave a sexless marriage for the sake of their son, the lovers would leave. It didn’t bother them over much, it worked for both Draco and Astoria, and Scorpius didn’t know any different, not that either ever allowed any of their lovers to interact with their son.</p><p>Astoria fell pregnant a second time four years into their marriage and instead of divorcing her like her current lover had hoped, Draco embraced the child as his own, blood adopting little Cassiopeia. Astoria, of course, was furious with the lover that had potioned her to fall pregnant and had kicked the idiot to the curb, much to Draco’s amusement.</p><hr/><p align="left">When Scorpius turned ten, he sat down with his son and told him the same story that his mother had told him. Draco warned him to guard his heart, to be careful. He explained that while he had found happiness with Astoria, he was actually gay and so while he loved Astoria, he had never been <em>in</em> love with her.</p><p>Scorpius had accepted this with a surprising amount of equanimity.</p><hr/><p align="left">Scorpius went to Hogwarts and somehow, made friends with Potter’s youngest boy. Potter had had a rather messy divorce six months prior. It had come to light that not only had Ginevra Weasley been giving him Amortentia, but that their youngest, Lily, wasn’t even Potters. The Prophet had devoured the story, printing speculation and sensationalised articles about the very public blow out. Ginevra was cast out of the Potter home, but Potter had opted to blood adopt Lily, keeping all of the children. He also took an extended leave of absence from his position as Senior Auror at the Ministry to focus on his family and on recovering from the betrayal.</p><p>Draco couldn’t help but respect the man. He had faced the whole debacle with grace while Ginevra had thrown public tantrums and aired their dirty laundry for the world to see. Once Potter had gone through the purging process for removing the effect of long term exposure of Amortentia, he came out as publicly gay.</p><p>Occasionally Draco would have to interact with Potter in a public setting. They had been cordial since the end of the war and while he had grown to harbour a secret flame for the other man, he would never consider taking it further. It wasn’t worth the risk.</p>
