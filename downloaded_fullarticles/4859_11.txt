<p>swearwolf: Well, you named the chat ‘2 couples and a freeloader’ and there’s five people in the chat. Now taking into account that you and Lily are an item, I hardly think you were suggesting Wormtail was cheating on Penny with Padfoot.</p>

<p>backinblack: Why? Are you jealous Moony?</p>
<p>swearwolf: Oh shut up, you prat!</p>
