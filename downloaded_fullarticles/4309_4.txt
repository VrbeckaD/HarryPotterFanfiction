<p>"It's not like Hermione to miss an Order meeting," fretted Ron. Others around the kitchen table murmured agreement.</p>
<p>Harry, treating a hex burn on Ginny’s arm, nodded tiredly. "If she were on another mission for us, we’d know it." He turned to McGonagall. "Do you have any idea where…?"</p>
<p>"No, Potter, unless… Oh, Severus, do you think she could be in danger?"</p>
<p>Severus reluctantly stepped out of the shadows. "If you like, Minerva, I will do my best to find Miss Granger," he said.</p>
<p>The meeting resumed as Severus left Grimmauld Place. He suspected he knew where she had gone.</p>

<p>He Apparated with a <i>crack</i> into a disused shed in Croydon, then took to the streets with purposeful step. Within a few minutes, he reached the picture-house, with its garish marquee offering four different movies. Scrounging a few quid from an inner pocket, he bought a ticket and entered the lobby. Threadbare carpet did little to muffle the jangle of videogames.</p>
<p>Which film would she have chosen? Severus stood still, considered everything he knew about the young woman who had stolen his heart. Then he bought a small popcorn and went off in search of a love story.</p>

<p>The darkened theatre was half-empty. Severus quietly sat down beside Hermione. She never took her eyes off the screen.</p>
<p>"Do I have to go back, then?" she asked sadly.</p>
<p>"No, not yet.” He offered her popcorn.</p>
<p>On the screen, some earnest young man was declaring his love to a teary-eyed woman. Severus envied the simplicity of Muggle movies—stories of a bright, hopeful world, so far from this endless wizarding war, where a man was free to make a proper home for the girl of his dreams.</p>
<p>She leaned on his shoulder, and they finished the movie in silence.</p>
