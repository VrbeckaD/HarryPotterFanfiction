<p>~</p>
<p>Severus’ Auror</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>As they all followed Lucius to Malfoy Manor’s library, Narcissa murmured, “Dating Ravenclaws now?” </p>
<p>Severus raised an eyebrow. “Just the one. You know him?” </p>
<p>“Naturally. The Shacklebolts are part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. Plus, everyone had a crush on him.”</p>
<p>“Even you?” </p>
<p>“No, I was already betrothed.” Narcissa winked. “But that doesn’t mean I didn’t notice him.” </p>
<p>“If you’re through gossiping, we’re here,” grumbled Lucius, opening the door. </p>
<p>The library was two floors, a spiral staircase in the centre. Lucius walked over to a shelf. “It’s here, in the Yorkshire Moors section.” Pulling it out, he handed it to Severus.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>As soon as he touched it, Severus sensed malevolence. Gingerly opening it, he frowned upon finding the pages blank.</p>
<p>Lucius walked over to Narcissa, who was browsing through books. “We really should go now.” </p>
<p>“Wait.” Kingsley materialized beside Severus. Eyeing the book, he said, “Perhaps we should put something in its place. He may come looking.” Raising his wand, he uttered a spell, and another, identical book appeared in his hand. </p>
<p>“He’ll know that’s not his,” said Lucius. </p>
<p>“Not unless he picks it up.” Kingsley approached the bookshelf. “Where was it? Next to Yorkshire Moors?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Lucius exhaled. “Please hurry.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Kingsley placed the fake book on the shelf before turning towards Severus. “Ready?” </p>
<p>Severus nodded, pocketing the Horcrux. </p>
<p>Just then, the library door opened. Kingsley’d just disappeared as someone said, “Hullo?” </p>
<p>Lucius raised an eyebrow. “Pettigrew? Why are you here?”</p>
<p>Pettigrew’s eyed them, expression suspicious. “The Dark Lord summoned me.” </p>
<p>Severus sneered. “Then perhaps you should report to him instead of sneaking up on people.” </p>
<p>Pettigrew’s expression closed. “I heard voices and decided to investigate. Can’t be too careful these days.” </p>
<p>“Indeed.” Severus moved towards the door. “Excuse us, we were just leaving.” </p>
<p>“I thought you’d already left,” said Voldemort.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Severus froze as Voldemort pushed past Pettigrew, entering. </p>
<p>Voldemort’s eyes narrowed. “Lucius? I believe I instructed you to go.” </p>
<p>“Yes, my Lord.” Lucius cleared his throat. “I…that is, we—”</p>
<p>“I needed a book, my Lord,” said Narcissa. </p>
<p>“A…book.” Voldemort raised an eyebrow. “What book?” </p>
<p>Narcissa pulled one from her robes. “This herbal remedy book came from my grandmother.” </p>
<p>“‘Herbs of the Yorkshire Moors’?” Voldemort read. “Very well. Are you done in here?” </p>
<p>“Yes, my Lord. We were just leaving,” said Lucius.</p>
<p>“Excellent.” Voldemort swiveled to look at Severus. “But that doesn’t explain Severus’ presence. Are you leaving, too?”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Severus inclined his head. “Oh no, my Lord. I accompanied them because I wanted access to one of their grimoires. I’d hoped it would help with some of the potions I’m developing.”</p>
<p>“Of course.” Voldemort nodded. “You’re a dedicated man, Severus. And don’t worry. If you require access to a grimoire in future, I’ll simply have Lucius return. After all, their trip is just temporary.” </p>
<p>“Of course, my Lord.” Severus bowed. </p>
<p>Voldemort turned towards Pettigrew. “Peter, come. I believe you have news for me.” </p>
<p>“Yes, my Lord.” Pettigrew smirked at Severus. “I’ve very interesting news about someone in Godric’s Hollow.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>One they were alone, Lucius groaned. “We must go <i>now</i>! If he finds us here again—”</p>
<p>Severus frowned. “Godric’s Hollow? There’s only one person there in whom he could be interested. But why?” </p>
<p>“You’re asking us?” said Lucius, blinking. “We’ve no idea!”</p>
<p>“I was asking Kingsley.” Severus frowned, walking over to the Yorkshire Moors shelf again. “Kingsley?”</p>
<p>“<i>Homenum Revelio</i>!” said Lucius. When nothing happened, he threw up his hands. “See? He left, something we should also do.” </p>
<p>Severus closed his eyes as he realised what Kingsley had done. “Salazar.” </p>
<p>“What?” snapped Lucius.</p>
<p>Severus sighed. “Nothing. You’re right, we should go.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Finally!” said Lucius. But when, as they exited the library, Severus turned away from the exit, he cried, “Where are you going now?”</p>
<p>“To get Kingsley. I believe he followed Pettigrew and the Dark Lord.” </p>
<p>“What?!” Lucius groaned. “Why in Salazar’s name would he do something so foolish?”</p>
<p>“To spy on them, get more information,” Severus whispered. “I can’t leave him here. I must find him.” </p>
<p>“He’s an Auror,” Lucius reminded him. “He can take care of himself. Plus, why do you even ca—?” He paused as Narcissa whispered in his ear. “Really, Severus?” he said, tone dry.</p>
<p>Severus flushed.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Flustered, Severus turned away. “Look, I’m going to find him. You don’t have to help me—” </p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous,” Lucius sighed. “You’re the only reason we have a chance to escape this madness. The least we can do is help find your lover before the Dark Lord murders him.” </p>
<p>“Thank you,” Severus said. “Where do you think they would have gone?”</p>
<p>Lucius shook his head. “There’s no way to know. He’s used every part of the Manor for his…audiences.” He shuddered.</p>
<p>Narcissa sighed. “Dobby!”</p>
<p>Dobby appeared. “Yes, Mistress?” </p>
<p>“Take us to Severus’ Auror immediately,” she said. </p>
<p>“At once, Mistress.”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Dobby deposited Severus, Lucius, and Narcissa in the hallway outside the dining room. </p>
<p>“Kingsley?” Severus hissed. Receiving no answer, he crept closer, waving Lucius and Narcissa back.</p>
<p>“…explain again how you overheard this prophecy,” said Voldemort.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore was interviewing someone, one of the Yorkshire Moor Trelawneys, for Divination professor. Just before leaving, she fell into a trance and said what I told you.”</p>
<p>“‘Thrice defied’—” Voldemort hummed. “Several people fit that description, and they’re all hiding.” </p>
<p>“True, but Lily Potter’s pregnant, due in July, and <i>I’m</i> their Secret Keeper.” </p>
<p>Severus went cold. Stepping back, he collided with someone, and yelped.</p>
