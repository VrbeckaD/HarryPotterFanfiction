    <p>So a while a go I had an idea for a Harry/harem story where Harry gets turned into a Werewolf and goes onto have a harem where the large majority of members are some kind of magical creature/being. I posted this idea onto a Facebook page and got a few people telling me to give it a go so I'm finally going to give it a try. A little heads up, this is my first ever attempt at a story and I was never very good at creative writing at school without a bit of help, so I'm sorry if this isn't very good. In this first chapter I will give my run down of the characters that will be in the harem as well as a bit of fan casting for how I imagine them to look, as well as a small description of what they are like and what kind of creature they are. So here goes.</p><p>Hermione-Neko-Emma Watson:<br/>
Love the character, going to try and have her be as close to canon as possible. Accident from second year turned her into a Neko, no fur.<br/>
Tonks-Metamorphmagus-Natalia Tena:<br/>
Again going to try and keep her as close to canon as I can. Typical fun loving and flirty beacon of light.<br/>
Lily-nothing-Alexandra Breckenridge:<br/>
Never married James so still Evans, her conception of Harry was caused by Dumbledore pulling a Palpatine in an attempt to bring about the prophecy. Harry is her world and will do anything to keep it that way.<br/>
Fleur-Veela-?:<br/>
I don't know whether to stick with the films and have her played by Clemence Poesy or go with a French actress called Estelle Skornik (see photos/clips of her from TV series Hornblower) who is equally if not more so beautiful.<br/>
Gabrielle-Veela-Thylane Blondeau:<br/>
Complete seductress who becomes enamoured with Harry during Tri-Wiz.<br/>
Ginny-Vampire-Karen Gillan:<br/>
Going to try and have her be more like book self than films. Strong, Tomboy, NOT infatuated with Harry but maybe slight crush from his Jock status as Quiditch star as Boy-Who-Lived stuff will be changed.<br/>
Susan Bones-Mermaid-Emma Stone:<br/>
Quintessential Hufflepuff. Hardworking, Caring, Mother Goose, Friendly.<br/>
Amelia Bones-Mermaid(Family thing)-Lauren Holly:<br/>
Same as with Susan but where Susan is friendly Amelia comes off more strict and colder.<br/>
Daphne-Vampire-Billie Eilish:<br/>
At first appears to be stuck-up Pureblood Princess, dad is an asshole Pureblood who wants to control his daughters until he can sell them off, as her own little rebellion Daphne dies (muggle way) her hair as an attempt to act out. For those who have seen RWBY, think Weiss with her side Ponytail to act out against her Father.<br/>
Astoria-Vampire(Family thing)-Kiernan Shipka:<br/>
Average bubbly little sister with too much energy.<br/>
Madam Rosmerta-some sort of immortal being(give me your ideas)-Katheryn Winnick:<br/>
Don't know if this has been done before but I had the idea that if you asked anyone in the Harry Potter world who had been to Hogwarts, no matter how old they were, they'd all be able to tell you the same story about the beautiful busty blonde barmaid that worked at the Three Broomsticks when the went to school.<br/>
Angelina-Werewolf-Freema Agyeman:<br/>
Big sister type figure to Harry, her and her fellow chasers become a sort of consistent pack/bodyguard for Harry.<br/>
Katie-Werewolf-Georgina Leonidas:<br/>
Same as Angelina<br/>
Alicia-Werewolf-?:<br/>
Same as above. Can't really think who to cast as, any ideas?<br/>
Emma Granger(mum)-nothing-Gemma Arterton:<br/>
Disowned by her family for getting pregnant at sixteen, her whole life has revolved around Hermione, that is until she meets Harry and Lily outside Platform Nine and Three-quaters on 1st of September 1991. But all may not be as it seems in regards to her conception of Hermione, she has, after all, always kept up her story of not knowing how it was possible.<br/>
Eileen Snape(OC daughter of old Sevy and Harry's favourite aunt)-Werewolf-Clare Thomas (see photos/clips from TV show Young Dracula, first couple seasons):<br/>
Grew up as best friends with Harry and continuously at his side, completely in love with her older cousin, slight dislike and jealousy of Hermione for her closeness to Harry.<br/>
Luna-Fairy/pixie type creature-Evanna Lynch:<br/>
I absolutely adore this character, will try and keep her as close to canon as I can.</p><p>Andromeda-nothing-Rachel Weisz:<br/>
At first appears strict and no nonsense, but as you get to know her you realise that Nymphadora had to have gotten her mischievousness from somewhere. Hogwarts' school nurse instead of Pomfrey. Long time friend of Lily, she decides to take it upon herself to care for Harry after gaining his curse as well as during his first change. (Thanks go to HoosierPotter for convincing me to add Andromeda as well as how I could add her as I was pretty stumped on any ideas).</p><p>Padma and Parvati-Naga-Naomi Scott<br/> See FxRobalino's comment on chapter 4 for the idea.</p><p>Well that's it for now, let me know if there is any other girls/women you want added along with your own fan casting and what kind of creature they could be. I will try and get the first chapter out either tonight (GMT) or tomorrow. The first chapter will be my alternate take on Halloween 81, so you can kind of understand how much will be changed. Thank you if you are still reading (if anyone has read all this shit at all that is) and I hope to see you later.</p>
