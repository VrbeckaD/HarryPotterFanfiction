  <u>Sorting #1: Aoi Asahina</u>
</p><p>Ravenclaw: Alright, I’m not even going to try for this one. You guys go for it.</p><p>Hufflepuff: That’s not how this works! All of us need to make a case for our house in order for this to be fair.</p><p>Slytherin: I’m out, too.</p><p>Hufflepuff: What!? Come on!</p><p>Slytherin: You can’t honestly expect either of us to want an airhead like that in our house. Name one cunning or intelligent thing she did the entire game.</p><p>Gryffindor: I’m not about to make a case for Slytherin for you. That’s your job.</p><p>Ravenclaw: To be fair, she did try to sabotage the 4th trial. That’s kind of Slytherin-ish.</p><p>Slytherin: More like she put way too much trust in a random note and impulsively went to get justice. Sounds like a Gryffinpuff decision to me.</p><p>Ravenclaw: I agree. I just wanted to play devil’s advocate.</p><p>Hufflepuff: As for Ravenclaw, there’s more to you guys than intelligence. There’s also individuality. That kinda fits.</p><p>Ravenclaw: Maybe, but she’s far from an independent thinker. She’s way to easily swayed by other people in the trials.</p><p>Slytherin: Plus, she doesn’t hit any of the other main traits. Well, I guess she can have acceptance, but Hufflepuff's also got that covered.</p><p>Gryffindor: *Sigh* Alright, Puffy, looks like this is between you and me.</p><p>Hufflepuff: Fair enough. I actually really want her to be in my house anyway. She’d be such a cute little puff.</p><p>Gryffindor: Well, I’m not gonna give up that easy. I’ve got a few cards up my sleeves. First, just look at that outfit. If that’s not the true Gryffindor aesthetic, I don’t know what is.</p><p>Ravenclaw: Objection. We are not about to start sorting people based on outfits.</p><p>Hufflepuff: She’s also wearing a yellow tie in the anime thing.</p><p>Gryffindor: I thought it was green.</p><p>Slytherin: Hold on. *types into google* Wiki says green.</p><p>Hufflepuff: Oh…</p><p>Ravenclaw: Doesn’t matter. We’re here to talk about personality traits, not character design.</p><p>Gryffindor: Like I said, that was just the first point. Point number two: She’s a sporty gal. We Gryffs love a sporty gal.</p><p>Hufflepuff: Okay, I’ll give you that one. But still, she’s nice, friendly, and very loyal to her fellow classmates.</p><p>Slytherin: Loyal up until she tries to kill them all.</p><p>Hufflepuff: And then she's back to being loyal after that, but I guess you have a fair point. Still, she was motivated mostly by her loyalty to Sakura.</p><p>Ravenclaw: Loyalty to one person causing someone to almost kill a bunch of people is not a Hufflepuff kind of loyalty. It’s a Slytherin kind of loyalty.</p><p>Slytherin: No Slytherin would’ve trusted that note at face value.</p><p>Hufflepuff: She was grieving, okay? I’ll cut her some slack.</p><p>Gryffindor: Yeah, I don’t think we should look at that chapter too closely when if comes to sorting.</p><p>Hufflepuff: Let’s look at chapter one instead, where she sneaks off to cuddle with Sakura in the middle of the night cause she’s scared.</p><p>Gryffindor: Okay, but-</p><p>Hufflepuff: Or that one time she was so distraught about the deaths of her friends that she left to go get comfort food before getting scared away by the “ghost” of Chihiro.</p><p>Ravenclaw: You really came prepared.</p><p>Hufflepuff: What can I say? I’m passionate.</p><p>Gryffindor: Alright, let’s look at it this way. Which house would she rather be in: the house of the brave or the house of loyalty?</p><p>Slytherin: She’d probably want to be in the house next to the kitchen so she can get doughnuts whenever she wants.</p><p>Gryffindor: ...Fine, Hufflepuff wins.</p><p>Hufflepuff: Yay!</p><p> </p><p>
  <u>Sorting #2: Junko Enoshima</u>
</p><p>Hufflepuff: New rule: No more refusing to participate. We all need to at least try to make a case for our house. And no, Slytherin, manipulating someone else into making an argument for you doesn’t count.</p><p>Slytherin: Alright, go ahead then. The floor is yours. Explain to us why the main villain of the series deserves to be in Hufflepuff of all places.</p><p>Gryffindor: No need to be rude, Snakey.</p><p>Ravenclaw: Maybe someone else should go first, given that Hufflepuff will likely be the hardest sell here.</p><p>Hufflepuff: Never let it be said that a Hufflepuff isn’t willing to put in the work. Just… give me a second.</p><p>Slytherin: I swear to whatever god wizards pray to, if Junko’s a hat-stall purely because Hufflepuff insists on going first, I quit. I’m moving my house to Beauxbatons.</p><p>Hufflepuff: Technically, Junko’s main motivation for the tragedy was causing herself despair. That means she feels the most amount of despair when others are in despair.</p><p>Gryffindor: Is the word despair losing its meaning to anyone else?</p><p>Hufflepuff: Therefore, if you think about it, putting her in my house isn’t that much of a stretch.</p><p>Ravenclaw: So, purposefully ending the world and killing a lot of people is a Hufflepuff thing to do as long as you feel bad about it?</p><p>Slytherin: She doesn’t even feel bad. It just makes her feel.. bad… You know what I mean.</p><p>Ravenclaw: It doesn’t make her feel guilty.</p><p>Slytherin: Yeah, that’s it.</p><p>Hufflepuff: I never said your argument had to be good.</p><p>Gryffindor: Alright, my turn… Okay, the only thing I can think of is that she’s very emotionally driven and kinda impulsive.</p><p>Ravenclaw: I’d say Mukuro’s portrayal of Junko in the beginning of the first game is probably Gryffindor, but other than that, I think you’re out.</p><p>Gryffindor: Fair enough. Who’s next?</p><p>Slytherin: I think we can all agree that she’s pretty cunning and manipulative. Even though she did cheat and use that brainwashing video to make people go all despair-hungry, she still made Ryota make it. Plus, look at how fast she can change her personality in final cases of the first two games. That’s some good acting, and we all know acting is the Slytherin of the arts.</p><p>Ravenclaw: Nice case. I don’t think we have any objections to the points you made.</p><p>*Silence*</p><p>Hufflepuff: Awesome! Let’s hear Ravenclaw out and then decide.</p><p>Ravenclaw: I hope no one minds if I go on the defense a bit first. Yes, Junko is pretty cunning, but is she ambitions?</p><p>Gryffindor: Okay, I hate ending the world just as much as the next person, but that’s pretty ambitious.</p><p>Ravenclaw: Yeah, but her ambition is ultimate self-destruction, which directly contradicts the Slytherin trait of self-preservation. Meanwhile, let’s look at her talent. She’s analytical. Analytical to the point where everything is boring to her. Sure, she tries to end the world for the sake of despair, but boredom is what makes her want despair in the first place. I also hate ending the world, but if there’s ever a Ravenclaw-esk reason to do it, it’s that.</p><p>Gryffindor: Cool, I’m sold. She’d probably like being in Ravenclaw anyway. Slytherin’s too predictable.</p><p>Slytherin: Wait, shouldn’t I get a chance to counter?</p><p>Hufflepuff: Go for it.</p><p>Slytherin: You can’t shut me down because she doesn’t have some of my traits and then say she fits into your house because she has one of yours. What about creativity?</p><p>Ravenclaw: All those executions are nothing if not creative.</p><p>Gryffindor: If I were you, Snakey, I’d jump at the chance to sort a villain into something other than your house.</p><p>Slytherin: True… Alright, I give in. Ravenclaw it is.</p>
