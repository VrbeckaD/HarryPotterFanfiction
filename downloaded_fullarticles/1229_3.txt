    <p>Jame’s POV:<br/>
I silently laugh at Sirius as he tries using puppy dog eyes on Remus, he’s trying to get Remus to help him to do the homework for Potions, claiming that he ‘Forgot about it.’ I can see that Peter is obviously enjoying it well. You see, today is a typical, normal day, except it isn’t. Today is the day me, Sirius, Peter, and Remus have planned the best prank against little Snivy, they had been planning for the month and today was the day it would finally come to fruition.  </p>
<p>	I lean over to Peter, he’s sitting next to me so it's fairly easy to see what’s in his lap, the Marauders map is open and we’ve been tracking Sniveleus all day, waiting for the perfect moment to spring our trap. The Great Hall makes it even easier, “James!” Hisses Peter quietly, pointing to a spot on the map, Sniveleus was in an abandoned hallway with Malfoy, hmmm this could be interesting depending on how we play it. “What if we pranked them both?” Peter asks quietly, voicing my thoughts. I nod and stand up, Sirius immediately notices and signals to Remus, now that all of us are standing we quietly creep out of the Great Hall, making our way towards the hall.</p>
<p> I pull my Invisibilty cloak out of my pocket and all of us get under it, not wanting to be seen by a teacher and stopped. This is gonna be amazing, thought James, a smile taking place on his face.</p>
