  <b>Prologue</b>
</p><p> <em>New Years Eve, 1995</em></p><p>Sirius knew something was up the second he stepped into the drawing room of the mausoleum his family called home.  The room was crammed with what appeared to be every family member, friend and acquaintance of his parents, all of whom were bad news.  There was a distinct chill in the air, and Sirius fought the urge to turn and run to the nearest floo connection. Nothing good could come from a gathering of these people, nothing good at all.  Slowly, on shaking legs, he crossed the room and kissed the fingertips of his mothers outstretched hand, as he knew was expected, before turning to his father and briefly nodding his head in a polite bow.  The chatter in the room died down as the guests turned towards Orion and Walburga.</p><p> </p><p>“Family and Friends” Orion began “my wife and I would like to welcome you to our home, and thank you for joining us on doubly joyous occasion, as we celebrate not only the engagement of our oldest son Sirius Orion, the heir of the ancient and most noble house of Black, to Miss Lucinda Mulciber, but also his initiation into the ranks of the dark lord, on this night when he is to receive the highest honor of his mark.  We invite you to raise your glasses and toast the hap-“</p><p> </p><p>“What in the name of Merlin are you fucking talking about” Orion’s speech was cut off my Sirius’ outburst.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius barely had time to register the shocked gasps of the assembled guests before he was struck hard across the face by his mothers hand, the large, incredibly ugly Black family ring leaving a smarting gouge across his cheek.  Before he had a chance to react he felt 2 strong hands grip his upper arms and drag him bodily from the room and across the hallway into the library where he was unceremoniously dropped into a straight backed chair. He glanced around the room, his mind trying to come up with a plan, and saw his mother usher Regulus into the room before shutting the door and locking it, dropping the large, ornate key into the pocket of his fathers jacket.</p><p> </p><p>“This ends now Sirius.  You will stop fighting us.  You will do as we require. You will end this ridiculous unnaturalness you insist on persisting with, and you will obey me, or so help me boy, you will regret it until your dying day”</p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <em>January 4th, 1996</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Remus Lupin woke with a start.  His mother was standing over him, shaking his shoulders and yelling at him to get up and get dressed NOW, before running from the room.  He rubbed his eyes, trying to figure out what the bloody hell was going on, as he gingerly tossed his blankets back and set his feet on the cold floor.  Before he could push himself into a standing position, his mother came running back into his room, dragging 2 suitcases behind her. Thoroughly bewildered, he opened his mouth to ask what was going on, but was cut off before he could get a word out.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s no time, just trust me, and pack your things into these 2 suitcases.  Be quick Cariad, we are leaving in less than 15 minutes. When you’re done, take your bags to the car, and quickly load up the things stacked next to the garage door.  Now hurry” and with that, Hope again ran from the room.</p><p>Bewildered, Remus began doing as his mother said, opening drawers and throwing armfuls of clothes into the open suitcases that were perched on his bed, before moving swiftly to his wardrobe and emptying its contents.  He crossed the floor quickly to his bookshelf, grabbing his backpack off the floor next to his desk and began stuffing books, photos, mementos and a few special trinkets into it haphazardly. He could feel waves of panic bubbling up from his stomach, and fought to keep them down.  Hitching his backpack onto his shoulder, he quickly zipped the suitcases closed and set them onto the floor, dragging them quickly towards the garage. He flung open the garage door, opened the boot of the car and threw the bags in, before returning to the hall and grabbing the bags and boxes his mother had piled up, finishing just as Hope came running towards him, somehow dragging 3 suitcases, 2 duffel bags and a pile of blankets behind her, with the cat under her arm.  Remus rushed to relieve her of part of her load, shoving them roughly into the remaining space in the car before slamming the boot closed.</p><p>Hope was already sitting in the drivers seat of the car, engine running, by the time Remus sat himself into the passenger seat.  He barely had his seatbelt buckled before Tuesday the cat was thrust into his arms. The garage door was raised, and the car was reversing down the drive, and Remus watched the garage door closing as Hope put the car into gear and drove down their quiet street, fingers clenched tightly on the steering wheel, knuckles white, with a look of frowning concentration on her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Mum” Remus started, somewhat cautiously “What the hell is going on?  Why are we driving through town with our belongings stuffed into every spare inch of this car at 1am?”</p><p> </p><p>Hope sighed, and wasted a few more moments navigating through the streets that would lead them to the highway “I don’t entirely know.  Your father and I were in bed when one of those shiny patrony things came flying through the window. I’m not sure what it said, but your father jumped out of bed and apparated out of the house.  A few minutes later he was back, yelling that we had to get out, and get out now, that the ministry was planning a raid just before dawn, something about you being taken in for questioning, and how it was all a set up.  Told me to take you and get to the safe location and he would meet us there in 90 minutes.  And so thats what we are doing”</p>
