    <p>I let myself be lost in a torrent of dreams, but who can fault me? For I dream (of her) so vividly that some fragments always remain upon my waking up. That is the hope that I continue to live for, the only way in which she lives again (as a mere phantom in my dreams). Surely, if I were to close my eyes and wait here in the dark for long enough (but how long is long enough?), this (familiar) ghost of a tingle left upon my lips (like an unwanted temptress) would (could, should) materialise into something more lasting. Then I will feel Lucius' possessive arm around my waist and the dream (or the possibility of being lost in it once more) shatters.</p>
