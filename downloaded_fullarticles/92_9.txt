  <span>She didn’t know how it happened, but she knew they were in a relationship. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was just so obvious! Every look they gave each other absolutely </span>
  <em>
    <span>screamed</span>
  </em>
  <span> of a wild force between them, barely contained. But though Harry was constantly sneaking around, and though the air around them practically vibrated, he hadn’t said anything to her or Ron, so she had no proof.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Until now.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione huffed as she threw the curtains back from her boyfriend’s bed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Ronald!”</span>
  </em>
  <span> She hissed, ignoring his groan. “You’re going to miss breakfast! And I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>listening to your stomach rumble all the way through charms!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Bumm’tired…” he whined.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, you’d better get a bacon sandwich before they’re all gone, then!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As she glared, Ron glowered, but thankfully the promise of bacon pulled him up, albeit begrudgingly. Softening slightly, her lips found his cheek, thanking him, and her stomach swooped as a gorgeous, sleepy smile slipped onto his face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is Harry up?” she asked, fighting the blush that burned her cheeks. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Dunno,” Ron’s eyes twinkled illegally at her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well he’ll miss breakfast too if he’s not, so check,” she ordered briskly, trying to regain some composure. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Yawning, Ron nodded, shuffling over to Harry’s bed as she began looking for fresh robes. She didn’t get very far.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Malfoy?!” </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Behind the curtains, curled together under the blankets, lay a pile of tangled limbs, as both Harry and Draco snored softly. Never had either of them looked so at peace.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Slowly, Ron’s amused eyes met hers.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Remember when they hated each other?” he smirked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But as memories of the previous years flashed through her mind, Hermione could only smile.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
