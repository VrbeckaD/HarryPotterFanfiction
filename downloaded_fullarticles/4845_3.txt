    <p>It was the first of September, the year 1998. Eighteen year old Harry Potter sat in a train car with his two closest friends. It felt as is if it was their first year again, eagerly waiting to see the new school. Though, technically, they were going to the same school they have been going to for the last seven years, it was different this time. The war was over, Hogwarts had been renovated, following the damage caused by the war. They had all lost friends along the way, and most parents were reluctant to let their kids return. Though, there were few who did. Minerva Mcgonagall had tried her very best to assure the safety of Hogwarts after Voldemort's defeat.</p>
<p>Ron hadn't shown much happiness since the end of the war, and he wasn't too excited to go back for one more year. Hermione, on the other hand, was eager to finish her schooling, and was as happy as she could be to attend the required extra year at Hogwarts. The two sat close to each other on the train, Hermione's hand wrapped around Ron's. Harry sat across from them, staring out the open window. He wasn't exactly ready to return yet, but he needed to be with his friends.</p>
<p>"You know, Harry," Ron started, "I'm not really mad at you. I'm actually quite glad you broke up with Ginny, you know, now I don't have to worry about my little sister dating my best friend, or worse, marrying him. No offense, mate."</p>
<p>Harry just nodded, not even bothering to look over. Hermione noticed his behavior and joined the conversation.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I mean a lot of relationships changed in the past year, you know. Like Seamus and Dean. Who'dve know they were together?" She laughed a little, in hopes of lightening the mood.</p>
<p>"I did actually. For quite a while." Ron said. "Why do think I was a little uncomfortable with Dean and Ginny together, I knew that him and Seamus were just on a little break."</p>
<p>"Seriously?" Hermione elbowed him and rolled her eyes. "Anyways, Harry, we have all been through a lot, but like with everything else, we must move on eventually."</p>
<p>"Thanks for the advice, but I'm fine, really." Harry was in no mood for his friends' pity. He truly dreaded having to attend school for his seventh year. All of the memories would be torture. Harry needed a break, or more importantly, a break up. True, he did once love Ginny. He would always have amazing memories with her, but his romantic feelings faded after a little while. He loved her as a friend rather than something more. He hoped she understood, but she hadn't talked to him since.</p>
<p>The Golden Trio sat in silence for the rest of the train ride. Hermione had pulled out one of her new textbooks and began reading while Ron leaned on her shoulder and dozed off. As soon as the train had come to a complete stop, Ron woke up. Both him and Hermione gathered their things and nearly left, the only thing keeping them was the fact that Harry was still staring out the window.</p>
<p>"Harry, mate, we have to go now." Ron shook Harry's shoulder, but Harry just shoved Ron's hand off. </p>
<p>"Give me a minute, both of you. Just leave me alone." Harry inhaled deeply. He didn't mean to snap at his friends, but he needed to be alone.</p>
<p>"Okay, we'll just meet you outside, then." Hermione grabbed Ron's arm and pulled him out of the car. "Let's just give him some space, babe." She whispered. </p>
<p>"Agreed." Ron wrapped his arm around Hermione's shoulder and they both followed their other Hogwarts students off the train and towards the castle.</p>
<p>Harry was finally left alone to think. Harry knew that he needed to talk to Ginny as soon as he got to the school, yet he still put it off. Maybe it was over between them forever. Harry didn't want their friendship to be over, but Ginny had made it clear that she was upset. Harry wanted to give her some time to think and possibly forgive him for being a total idiot, in which he clearly realised he had been. The car was peaceful for all of one minute before, to Harry's dismay, a certain blonde wizard burst through the door.</p>
<p>"Malfoy?" Harry couldn't help but notice how distressed Draco seemed.</p>
<p>Draco was shaking, he seemed almost terrified. Of what, Harry wasn't quite sure. Draco sat down next to Harry, almost completely out of breath. He stared into Harry's green eyes for a moment before saying anything.</p>
<p>"Potter," Draco paused, "I'm so sorry."</p>
<p>"Sorry for what?" Draco stood up. He flung out his wand and pointed it directly at Harry. Harry accordingly pulled his own out. "Malfoy, what the bloody hell?" He shouted.</p>
<p>"It's just that, you," Draco had no idea what to say. The truth? A lie? He chose the latter. "You don't deserve your fame." In all honesty, Draco had no idea why he was even there in the first place. </p>
<p>"I thought we put all of this fighting behind us, Malfoy." Harry tried to reason with him, but Draco wasn't having it. </p>
<p>"I don't think so, Potter." Draco put on his brave face, one that he had become familiar with from dealing with his father. "You know that there will always be something between us, Harry." That hadn't came out as well as Draco had planned. </p>
<p>"Oh, so we're on first name basis now, Draco?" Harry dismissed the ominous comment and readied himself for anything Draco might have up his sleeve.</p>
<p>Draco tried so hard to keep it together. Feelings weren't exactly his strongsuit. He hated having to now fake this hatred towards Harry. He didn't want to duel, he knew in the back of his mind that he wanted something else, something he would never even dare to mention out loud. But, all of that aside, Draco still felt that this feud was for the best. </p>
<p>"Aw, you look about ready to cry, Malfoy. Are gonna cry?" Harry teased, pushing Draco over the edge.</p>
<p>"Shut up, Potter!" Draco wasn't playing games anymore.</p>
<p>"That's more like it." Harry smirked. The adrenaline rush was the best thing he had felt in a while. </p>
<p>Both Harry and Draco spat out spells left and right. Seemingly neither could out-spell the other.</p>
<p>"Stupefy!" With that, Draco was thrown into the hallway. He stood up immediately and fought back.</p>
<p>"Expelliarmus!" Harry's wand flew out the open window, in response he ran towards Draco, his fists ready for hand to hand combat.</p>
<p>Harry knocked Draco's wand down and threw a few good hits before Draco could fight back. Malfoy threw a single punch, and knocked Harry to the ground. Harry wiped the blood dripping from his nose and attempted to stand up, but something was ringing in his ear, and he fell back. Draco tumbled onto the nearest seat, and grasped his ears. The ringing filled the entire train car. Draco reached for his wand and tried casting a spell to silence the ringing, but nothing happened. That was, for all of three seconds. As the ringing intensified, a pale blue light swirled around the two wizards. Not exactly what Draco had expected. Harry had managed to stand up, only to fall over on the seat. The train car had started to slowly knock back and forth, then it got faster thrusting both wizards from one side of the seat to the other.</p>
<p>"Get off me Potter!" Draco shouted, after Harry had rolled on top of Draco in midst of the chaos.</p>
<p>"What?" Harry couldn't hear anything over the noise. The rocking then knocked Draco onto Harry. "Hey, get off, Malfoy!" </p>
<p>The rigid movements went on only for a few seconds before Harry finally shoved Draco away. He tried to find something to grab onto, but there was only Draco. So Harry went with it.</p>
<p>"Grab my hand!" Harry reached out, and Draco did so hesitantly. </p>
<p>The light got brighter, Harry and Draco could barely see. Then it stopped. Everything went black. Harry tried shouting, but nothing came out. Draco did the same, and failed as well. They were floating in nothingness, still holding onto each other's hand. They both tried to let go, but it was if they were paralyzed, neither could move a single muscle. The darkness started to fade, revealing a minuscule view of greenery in the distance. But it was too far for them to reach. Harry was slowly becoming able to move, but Draco was still gripping onto him. Harry turned his head to see what he was doing. Draco was lying completely still, with his eyes closed. Harry let go of his hand and attempted to wake him, but Draco wouldn't move. The light suddenly got brighter, and gravity hit. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco as they fell. Harry hit the ground and passed out, Draco lying atop of him.</p>
