  <span>In his scramble to get himself out the door, Harry nearly forgot his carefully thought-out presents – the things he was most proud to be taking over to the Burrow this year. He had the idea planned since last holiday season, had ordered them partway through the year, and then had received and wrapped them a couple months ago. He had poured his heart and soul into these gifts in a way that he knew everyone would both appreciate and despise at the same time, which was always his favorite type of reaction to cause in people when he gave gifts. There was something that was extremely satisfying to him in giving a thoughtful, meaningful gift and ruining it </span>
  <em>
    <span>just</span>
  </em>
  <span> enough that people don’t quite know how to react to it. The gifts this year were his best of this type by far, and he had been desperate to see his family and friend’s faces upon opening the packages. Despite all of this, he was still about to leave without them, a fact he was not aware of until he saw Draco storming out to the car carrying the box that held the individually (and obnoxiously) wrapped gifts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oops,” Harry said under his breath.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Potter, you absolute fool! Were you honestly about to just drive us over there without these being in the car? You have been acting ridiculously obsessive and secretive about these packages for months, and then you just up and leave them on our bed?? Honestly, Scarhead, you are </span>
  <em>
    <span>such </span>
  </em>
  <span>a disaster,” Draco huffed, trying not to let his affection show through and failing miserably.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry grinned and winked, “Yes, dear, but I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>your</span>
  </em>
  <span> disaster.” Draco rolled his eyes, face pinking slightly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you so much for grabbing those, babe. I thought I’d put them in the car already, so yeah, I definitely, definitely would have left without them, and I would have been pissed about it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ugh, </span>
  <em>
    <span>this,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Potter – </span>
  <b>
    <em>this</em>
  </b>
  <span> is why I have a </span>
  <em>
    <span>list</span>
  </em>
  <span> and why I check it </span>
  <em>
    <span>twice</span>
  </em>
  <span>!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I thought that was because you–”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Shut </span>
  <em>
    <span>up</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Potter, you very well know that I have no desire to be Santa Clause, and I do wish you would stop flinging such wild accusations at me. It’s rather rude, you know.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh come </span>
  <em>
    <span>on</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Malfoy, you can’t just say that you like to make lists and check them twice and then </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> expect me to make a Santa reference! It’s just not something that I could do, because not acknowledging it would go against everything I believe in” Harry argues, kissing Draco softly on the cheek.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Whatever, Potter. You are utterly ridiculous, you know that? Especially with those horrendous Christmas joggers on!” Draco’s words are ones that he wishes came across as insult, but despite his disgusted expression, both he and Harry knew that they come across in much the opposite manner. Figuring he might as well just embrace his emotions for a moment, Draco wraps his arms around his disaster of a wizard and kisses him atop his </span>
  <span>nest</span>
  <span> -er, hair. After the extremely brief moment of affection, Draco breaks away and immediately begins lecturing Harry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Now, go fetch the keys and get your arse in the car! I want to help Molly with last-minute prep, and if I miss out on the first year of being able to do that because of you, I will hold it against you for the rest of our lives! Go! I will check the trunk again to make sure we have everything while you do that.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry dashed inside and began looking for the keys, but couldn’t seem to find them anywhere. Suddenly remembering that he was a wizard, and that there was a simple solution to this issue, Harry cast a quick </span>
  <em>
    <span>accio</span>
  </em>
  <span>, which revealed as they shot into his hand that they had been in his pocket the entire time. Shaking his head at himself, Harry hurried back outside, casting a locking charm at the front door as he did so. Draco was waiting in the car for him already, so Harry quickly started the car so that they could set off for the Burrow.</span>

<p>
  <span>The drive to the Burrow took about 30 minutes, and most of it consisted of holiday music and Draco whinging at Harry to reveal what his presents were. After months of practice at not revealing the secret, Harry was in no danger of accidentally falling for Draco’s traps now. As they got closer to the Burrow, though, their conversation turned to the last two Christmases that they spent together.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Isn’t it weird to think that two years ago today, we had only been dating for two weeks, yet were already celebrating Christmas with your mum?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It really is...though I suppose we had been dancing around each other for so long that it didn’t seem that weird to us then. Mother made a comment to me after that about it being ‘about time’ or something like that,” Draco said, rolling his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, I guess you’re right,” Harry huffed out a laugh before exclaiming, “I’m so excited for today! Last year at the Burrow was nice, but it felt strange to not also have your mum there, too. I’m glad that she and Andromeda took that holiday together, though, since it’s put them on good terms so we call all celebrate together this year,” Harry said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re such a sap, Potter.” Draco continued with a vulnerable type of honesty, “I agree though, it will be wonderful to have all the people I love be together at once. It has not happened in a long time, and even then, not quite like this. That’s why it’s been so important for me to help Molly with her holiday prep – both because she is so good at making me feel part of the family, and because I want to take some time with her to explain how much today means to me and to thank her for all she has done to make it happen.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course you do, Draco,” Harry said as they pulled up to the Burrow, “which is why I told you the incorrect time for when she starts preparing.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco’s face immediately began to turn angry, but before he could open his mouth to say anything, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and said, “Look, I wanted to give you two some extra time to talk before other people joined in to help her.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh!” Draco breathed, clearly pleased and a bit flustered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I knew you would have fret yourself silly about it if I had told you beforehand, and I didn’t want this to be something for you to stress about. It’ll be about an hour before she begins any of her prep for today, so let’s get in there, and I’ll take care of some things in the family room and check in on Arthur while you two have a nice chat, yeah?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Draco said in a small, shaky voice.</span>
