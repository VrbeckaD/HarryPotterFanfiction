    <p>The castle was hundreds of years old, the stones blackened with soot and blood, weathered by dirt and time and the salt of the sea; even the windows only allowed in darkened light through stained glass panes, jewel tones of green and purple and deep red. When lit by torch light, it almost seemed as if the hallways were haunted by the generations that had occupied it, shadows and secrets hiding behind every corner and down every spiral staircase. In the silence, it felt like a tomb.</p><p>Only the throne room seemed alive, one wall opened to a stone balcony that looked out over the rocky cliff and the sea beyond, the ceiling vaulted where a massive black iron chandelier hung, dripping with candles that were replaced every day, their wax occasionally falling like a burning rain on the unlucky servant who walked beneath. The walls were draped with tapestries in dark, muted colors, alternating with the arching stained glass windows that threw diamonds of color across the floor and over the long, low tables where the small court gathered, their tall backed chairs facing the three black thrones that towered over them, nearly ten feet off the ground, a set of eight steep stairs leading to their platform, stones worn smooth from the knees of the loyal.</p><p>The King sat in his throne as if it were molded to him, straight backed, head held high, a simple black iron crown sitting atop his long flaxen hair. He relished the power he had over his small but wealthy kingdom, one that was expanding as his armies marched unchallenged through the surrounding lands, laying waste to smaller cities, then nations, plundering them for all they had and leaving the rest of it burned to the ground. Beside him a smaller, more delicate seat, with painstakingly carved scrollwork, flowers and leaves curling up the legs and over the arm rests, sat empty, a beautiful iron tiara on a silver and green cushion to mark where the Queen had once sat. He’d lost her years ago, vowing never again to marry.</p><p>And on his other side sat the Prince. If it were possible, he was feared even more than his more reserved father. Not because he had more power, but because he had more anger, more bitterness, and less control over the urges of his darkened soul. He was like a child with a newly sharpened weapon, swinging his blade without looking, and putting everyone in danger. In all other ways he was a near mirror image of his father; tall and handsome, although he kept his white blonde hair short for the rare times he went out in his armor.</p><p>Tonight, the throne room hummed with celebration. There was music, a feast, the concubines danced between the tables as the nobility chattered and laughed, raising their glasses to another victory. The King looked over at his son, who sat silent, brooding, slouched down deep in his throne, one long leg stretched out in front of him, his chin resting in his hand. In the moonlight from the balcony, his sleepy eyes flashed silver, sweeping over the room bored, uninterested in any of the proceedings.</p><p>Between them a chain rattled. His father’s chosen concubine for the evening was kneeling beside the throne, her head resting comfortably against the King’s knee as he ran his hand through her hair. She wore the gown of a broken slave, simple black fabric draped over one arm, an emerald green sash tied at her waist. It was cut low enough that the Prince could easily see her breasts, the dusky nipples hardened in the cold air. That was what finally made him smile. Not because he was attracted to her, but because of how far she’d fallen. Pansy had been a princess at one time, on a throne as high as his.  He’d visited her castle as a child, remembering her as a haughty, selfish little bitch even at the age of eight. And now here she was, sucking the cock of a king and living in a windowless cell with ten other girls. She saw him sneering at her and pulled the fabric of her dress closer together, leaning in deeper to the King’s touch.</p><p>“Perhaps if we brought in the latest…spoils,” the King said, looking at his son. “I hear there are some beautiful specimens.”</p><p>The Prince shrugged, raising an eyebrow. His father didn’t yet trust him with a concubine of his own, fearing his…passion…was too uncontrolled. But he didn’t mind, finding that fucking the servant girls was just as satisfying. There were also the village girls, the ones who couldn’t say no, particularly when they were short on their tax payments, and a few noble women, some of them twice his age who were willing to do deplorable, delicious things in order to have a taste of his youth. Still, he was willing to see what was on offer.</p><p>A small group of girls were brought in, their hands shackled to their waists, barefoot and dirty, huddled together in a group. Young daughters from a conquered village, they wore the gowns of unbroken slaves, white fabric with a belt of hammered copper and a collar to match. The fabric was sheer enough to show the darkness of their nipples, the shadow of hair between their legs, and it was cut low enough in the back that it exposed the swaying curve of their lower back, the thin chain from their collar hanging down between their shoulder blades. The Prince sat up a bit straighter, looking them over. One girl was as pale and delicate as a glass, her eyes wide and blue, blonde hair like a tangled mess of straw down her back, a little trickle of dried blood at the corner of her mouth where she’d been reprimanded. Beside her, one who looked a bit older, and definitely prouder. She stood with her head held high, mouth set in an angry frown, her curly brown hair wild and long, fiery dark eyes piercing as she glared right at him. She looked him in the eye. He didn’t care for her. He could tell already she was defiant, and a fighter, and someone who would kick him in the balls twenty times before he broke her down and contrary to his reputation, he didn’t have the energy for it. In truth, most of the girls were true to their status: common; but as they were each brought forward and displayed, his eye was drawn to a ribbon of red hair.</p><p>She stood near the back of the group, holding her shackled hands up to her chest, her body trembling hard enough that he could see it from where he sat. Her friend, the girl with the wild dark hair and insufferable pride stood beside her and took her hand, whispering something in her ear. The red haired girl nodded and made an attempt to stand tall, dropping her arms, mimicking her mentor.  The Prince was riveted, watching as her façade melted in a matter of seconds, her shoulders rising up to her ears, her eyes darting around the massive room, her arms trying desperately to cover what everyone could see. The Trainer yanked her forward, like he had all the others, instructing her to turn and bow and let the King inspect her. She did exactly as she was told, her bottom lip trapped between her teeth. Just before she was pulled back into the line she looked up, her glittering green eyes bright with tears. Her nervous gaze locked on The Prince’s and she gasped, stumbling backwards into the arms of her friend.  He’d never seen a girl so purely and so beautifully terrified.</p><p>“Her,” he said, pointing before they were lead out of the chamber. “What’s her name?”</p><p>The Trainer pulled her forward again and The Prince sat up straight, leaning forward, his elbows on his knees.  She didn’t speak, looking from the King to the Prince, to her friend, to the balcony that she no doubt wanted to throw herself off of.  </p><p>“Tell Prince Draco your name, whore,” the Trainer said, kicking at the backs of her knees so that she dropped to the stone floor. When she cried out in pain the Prince felt his cheeks burning, a shiver running through his blood.</p><p>“Ginev…G-Ginny, sir,” she said, not daring to look up.</p><p>Her voice was raspy and weak, a tiny sound in the cavernous room, but it drilled right through him and he felt the blood rushing to his cock. It was almost ridiculous. There was no reason for it. She was nothing. He sat back, licking his lips, nodding to the Trainer to take her away.</p><p>The slaves were lead from the room and The Prince watched them go, feeling his father’s eyes on him the whole time.</p><p>“Drac—“</p><p>“She’s mine,” he said, interrupting the King. “As of now. No one else touches her. I’ve waited long enough for your permission.”</p><p>“She’ll be yours, once she’s trained. Once you’ve –“</p><p>“No, I’ll break her myself,” the Prince said, looking down at Pansy, who was all but cowering against the King’s leg. It was rare to hear the Prince say two words, much less argue with his father. She didn’t like being caught between them.</p><p>“Train her. You will train her. These are human beings, Draco. I won’t hand her over to you to satisfy your bloodlust.”</p><p>The Prince sighed but still stared at the girl on the floor, his lips twisted into a cruel smile as he watched her curl into herself. He reached out and stroked her hair with one black gloved hand, rubbing a lock of it between two of his fingers. Did she remember pushing him away when he’d tried to smell her hair when she was a girl? He let go of her and she turned away from him, the King placing a protective hand on the back of her neck.</p><p>“Don’t worry Father. I’m not going to waste an opportunity. I’ll make sure the girl survives.” He stood then, hopping down the stairs to grab a ripe apple from the table, biting into the flesh with a loud snap and sucking the tart juice in over his teeth.  “I’ve always taken good care of my pets.”</p>
