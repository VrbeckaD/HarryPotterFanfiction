    <p>“Tom, m’boy! Thank you for coming so quickly” Slughorn beamed as he slid his chair back, producing an annoying noise that made Tom’s jaw twitch, and stood up.</p><p>“Of course, Sir. No need to mention it”</p><p>“Come in, come in!” The professor urged, motioning with his hand and pulling a chair back for his student “Make yourself comfortable!”</p><p>Tom calmly closed the door behind him and made his way to the desk. He sighed inwardly, wondering if Slughorn would keep him with his useless stories as he always did. How annoying they were. Granted the man has been an important source of information and defense against Dumbledore, but still.</p><p>The mask he wore was hard to keep on place sometimes.</p><p>“Now, I know that you are quite busy with this school start, Tom” The man wiggled his eyebrows “Head boy! I had no doubt it would be you!” He laughed heartily and proudly “But I need to ask a favor. I need a potion brewed for tomorrow’s sixth year class”</p><p>He paused and leaned forward on the table, his eyes widening, like he was about to tell an important secret.</p><p>“The thing is: A dear friend of mine invited me to a junction at his house. He owled me this morning, so I could not prepare the potion sooner. Would you be so kind to brew it for me?”</p><p>His smile was completely dorky. Tom almost rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Of course” He answered simply, in a rush to just do the deed and leave “What potion is it that you need, Sir?”</p><p>“Amortentia!” Tom’s eye twitched, Slughorn seemed not to notice and smiled brightly “I thank you so much, Tom! You really are a magnificent young gentleman! The door to the stock will be open to you for the evening.”</p><p> The professor reached for the wand resting beside his hands on the desk and flicked his wrist. A parchment appeared out of thin air in front of Tom.</p><p> “I’m sure you’d have no trouble finding it, but here is the recipe for the potion,” He winked, Tom blinked unaffected “With my own twists in ingredients here and there” Slughorn took a look on his watch and whistled “Well, I must be on my way now. Thank you again, m’boy!”</p><p>Tom watched as the he hurriedly grabbed his coat and left the room, the door closing with a silent noise. He sighed and stood up from the chair, then headed to the adjacent door that led to Slughorn’s personal lab.</p><p>*w*</p><p>His dark orbs were fixed on the cauldron as he stirred the concoction being produced. The bubbling noise of the potion filled the room, echoing through the humid stone walls of the dungeon.</p><p>
  <em>Now, the crushed moonstone</em>
</p><p>He frowned as he reached the ingredient and let the silvery powder fall into the blood red liquid on the cauldron. Giving two stirs clockwise, the substance turned maroon. His ebony eyes flashed as the steam started to gather and twist above the cauldron. Now he had to wait five minutes to add the final ingredient. Narrowing his eyes, he sat on the high stool and stared thoughtfully at the fire ahead of him.</p><p>This potion. He despised it.</p><p>Its function was so disgusting. To recur to a potion, a potion which imitated <em>love</em> - he cringed - to gain the favor of another. He thought about how weak the despicable individuals who relied on this potion must be.</p><p>Then again, his mother had used it on his father.</p><p>Pitiful woman, staining the blood of the descendants of Slytherin. Was it not enough for her to submit herself to a muggle? Dishonor. Weakness. He sometimes wondered what would happen to her if she lived through his birth, what kind of humiliation he would have to endure.</p><p>Tom blinked, brought back from his thoughts as the charmed illuminated numbers above the workbench glowed bright red when the timer reached zero. He stood up stiffly.</p><p>Salazar, he wondered why they even taught the students how to brew this abomination.</p><p>Grabbing a wooden board with the pearl dust, he pushed the powder into the concoction with the help of a knife. He watched impassively as he set the board aside and stirred, the liquid turning a pinkish mother-of-pearl. Perfection.</p><p>Satisfied, he took the stirring stick out of the cauldron and, as he let the potion heating for a couple more minutes, he made to recollect the instruments he used.</p><p>His hand froze on the way.</p><p>Tom turned to the cauldron; eyes widened; nostrils flared. The steam of the potion innocently raised spirally, emanating a rich scent of cinnamon.</p><p>That was impossible.</p><p>Amortentia <em>never </em>exhaled any scent to him. Why would he smell something now, it was-</p><p>He let out a low gasp.</p><p>The scent slowly mixed with another, making Tom take a step forward without realizing it. It smelled like firewood, as if he was lounging in front of a warm fireplace. He stared transfixed at the pearl like potion. He inhaled deeply, a shiver running up his spine, the steam swirling with his motion and invading his airway. The final scent was of fresh parchment.</p><p>It stunned him how alluring the scents were. It seemed to fill his lungs, spreading to his body and turning it to flames in his veins. It made him crave for its source, it made him want to bathe in the fragrance.</p><p>Tom shook his head. He had been staring at the cauldron with mouth open, like a hungry dog. What <em>the hell </em>was wrong with him?</p><p>With haste, he poured the potion into two empty flasks, holding his breath for as long as he could whilst doing so. His head spun when he couldn’t help but inhale at the last drops falling into the glass, the cinnamon seeming to cling to his chest. Never before he corked a vial so quickly.</p><p>With a wave of his wand, he sent the instruments to the washbasin and charmed so they would wash themselves. He grabbed the two flasks like it would burn him and swiftly placed them on the professor’s desk. The pearl-pink of the potion was beautiful encased behind the glass of the vials, but haunted Tom as he stared at it thoughtfully.</p><p>He turned aside and proceeded to gather his things to leave.</p><p>*-*</p><p>The scent still filled his senses even as he ascended the stairs to the heads’ dormitory. He frowned in annoyance the entire way, his owns steps reaching his ears as the only person on the hall.</p><p>“<em>Incendio</em>”</p><p>Tom spelled to the gargoyle that guarded the dormitory, much like the one to the headmaster’s room. He stepped into the dark corridor and the door shut heavily behind him. A bright light shone further into the common room, illuminating the dark walls. The fireplace was lit up.</p><p>He had every intention of following up blindly to the short path of stairs to his room, but he stopped in the middle, eyes widened and nostrils flared once again.</p><p>
  <em>Merlin’s beard</em>
</p><p>“Riddle…good evening…?”</p><p>His eyes snapped up and aside. The bushy haired girl eyed him with a puzzled expression. She was lounging on the couch, legs resting sideways and torso and arms resting lazily on the arm of the couch. The book on her hands had a green cover with golden letters; she held it softly away from her face as she stared at him. He supposed he had been standing there a good five minutes without moving, hence her alarmed stance.</p><p>Tom swallowed and nodded dryly “Evening, Granger”</p><p>He made his way upstairs swiftly and shut the door behind him. Distressed, he threw his shoulder bag aside and headed to his private bathroom. Immediately, he turned the faucet open and leaned forward, splashing his face with cold water. He repeated the action twice, then turned the water off and propped his arms on the granite counter in front of the sink. His ebony fringe, dripping wet, fell on his eyes and molded to his forehead. He breathed deeply.</p><p>Why did <em>she </em>smell just like the potion?</p><p>*w*</p><p>Scratch that, she smelled even better than the potion.</p><p>Tom sat beside her at the reunion between prefects and heads that afternoon. He had tried to avoid her all day, but now he was obligated to sit beside her at the little gathering. His eyes were glued to the Ravenclaw prefect who was speaking. It was something about the rounds, although he honestly could not concentrate on what the boy was saying.</p><p>His eye twitched when she shifted beside him. The voice of his classmate only like a muffled humming on the background. To say he was annoyed was an understatement. She seemed to exhale the fragrances of his Amortentia of yesterday, making, in turn, his blood run faster and his body to perk up. He still asked himself why she smelled like a love potion was just beside him – more importantly why did it affect him so.</p><p>Just a year back, at his sixth year, he brewed the potion. He had been disgusted, of course, as Slughorn announced the class subject, but the process of production had been much the same of the day before – with the exception that Nott and Black had been “helping” him that day. The big difference is that he smelled nothing. Felt nothing. He supposed it was just fair; he was not one for love.</p><p>That indeed was an alien conception to him. He did not feel capable of love. He did not think he was even capable of being allured by another person. His only lust was after power. In his school years, he had his fair share of admirers. His good looks, intelligence and chivalrous ways granted him the frequent attention of the opposite sex, he could admit to himself. To their misfortune, however, he always turned down the bold ones who confronted him to confess their interest over the years.</p><p>He felt nothing, as with the potion.</p><p>Not when they looked at him with big, desire-filled orbs. Not when they ate him with their eyes over the classes. Not when they threw themselves over at him. He didn’t feel anything. Actually, he did feel something. Disgust. He felt revolted that insignificant beings like them could even think they could win him over with good looks and grabby hands. He wished their hands would turn to ash when they so much as touch a finger on him.</p><p>Maybe he could create a charm to that.</p><p>There was just one time that he retaliated against their advances and that was when one of them, a Hufflepuff, tried to put a love potion on his juice. He smirked to himself. The girl’s expression of panic every time she sees him until now is delightful. <em>Crucio</em> and <em>Obliviate </em>are a good combination to get rid of annoying cockroaches.</p><p>That was the main reason why he did not understand how the love potion exhaled anything and why it was Hermione Granger, of all people, to happen to be the one matching its fragrance. He barely spoke to the girl in this year she had been transferred to Hogwarts. She was smart, he could give her that, with grades that almost matched his own completely. It was no wonder to him that she became head girl. He could, also, admit that he had been surprised to see her in action in the duel classes. Still, nothing that wrapped his interest… that much.</p><p>He cringed when cinnamon hit his olfactory cells in a wave when the girl beside him brushed her hair aside do her shoulder. <em>That </em>was getting to his nerves. Hopefully that would stop soon. He imagined he was that affected by the scent because he was exposed to the vapor of Amortentia recently.</p><p>There was nothing to worry about.</p><p>*w*</p><p>There was definitely something to worry about.</p><p>Why the smell, although faint, still emanated from her a week after he breathed the love potion he produced was beyond him. He sat by his desk on his room, elbows propped on it surface and chin resting atop his joined hands. It was absurd.</p><p>Really she must have thrown some kind of spell on him…</p><p>His eyes widened. He groaned, head falling back in realization. That was it! It was so obvious! She must have put a love potion on his drink sometime that week. Granted, not an Amortentia, because he was no acting like a bloody duckling around her, but something weaker surely.</p><p>He straightened again, his eye twitched. <em>Oh, boy, </em>that girl was in for trouble. How dare she? He would confront her in that exact moment.</p><p>He stood up and trotted down the stairs. As she always did by the evenings – <em>Salazar, why did he know that? </em>- She was lounging on the couch reading, calm and distracted, she didn’t even notice him in the room. The cinnamon scent, becoming thicker, burned his nostrils and provoked a shiver on his spine, annoying him further. His eyes flashed in rage for a second, but he let himself cool down and smiled cynically, before turning his ebony orbs to her and clearing his throat.</p><p>She perked up instantly at that, looking much like a deer caught in the light of a <em>Lumos </em>at night. Her eyes locked on his, wide and astounded for a moment, the look falling to give place to a confused expression.</p><p>“…Yes?” The girl asked, lowering her book softly.</p><p>His head tilted slightly and he smiled further.</p><p>“Good evening, Miss Granger” He used his best charming tone “May I join you?” He motioned the lounge with a hand.</p><p>She seemed baffled for a moment, her mouth opening and closing twice.</p><p>“Why?” Came the guarded response.</p><p>Tom flinched slightly. He was not expecting that.</p><p>“Why, well, I thought I could use some chat with my fellow head student” </p><p>The girl frowned. She seemed suspicious about him and he honestly wondered why. Wasn’t she the one who “poisoned” him? She took some moments to answer, licked her lips, a movement he unconsciously followed with his eyes, and answered.</p><p>“If that’s the case, be my guest”</p><p>Her tone did not seem that inviting, but he nodded anyways, still with his charming smile on place and sat himself upon the sofa she was lounging. She flinched at his proximity to her feet, which were upon the seat, and brought them a little closer to her. Tom raised an eyebrow and relaxed back, resting an arm on the arm of the couch and another on its back.</p><p>As annoyed as he was, her scent was positively delicious at that distance, he had to admit. He took the time to observe her from so close. Her thin, elegant neck had a golden necklace with a golden snitch pendant. Her plump bottom lip was softly caught between her teeth. Her nose, delicate and slightly curved upwards, had it nostrils flared, like a cautious animal. Finally, her honeyed chestnut eyes, narrowed and watching him carefully back.</p><p>Strange. He would have thought a girl infatuated by him would show desire or at least bashfulness around him. She looked more as if she would like to pounce him. Not to snog, but to strangle him…</p><p>“Hadn’t you said you’d like to talk?” Her voice made him focus his attention on it in stance of on her appearance “I thought to do that people must speak, or was I mistaken?”</p><p>He couldn’t help but smirk. Sassy. No wonder she was a Gryffindor.</p><p>“There are many ways to communicate, Miss Granger,” A sensation in his gut coaxed him to answer “Or aren’t you acquainted with body language?” He smiled slyly at the soft red that tinged her cheeks.</p><p>“I read about it, yes” She replied quickly, recoiling back a little, annoyed “But I think it’s more of an intimate conversation”</p><p>“Is that so?” He chuckled lightly, then leaned his temple on the hand at the back of the couch, eyes like a hawk’s. She huffed and threw him an insulted look.</p><p>“I meant <em>self </em>kind of intimate”</p><p>He was truly amused to watch as she rolled her eyes “I never said otherwise”</p><p>Obviously she noticed his debauched tone and narrowed her eyes sourly “What was it that you wanted again? Because I will retire to my room shortly”</p><p>His lips curved in a small, false smile “Relax, Hermione” She seemed to cringe at his call of her first name “I only wanted to get to know you. We never really spoke much”</p><p>She raised an eyebrow “Why start now, <em>Riddle</em>?”</p><p>Tom’s smile fell a little, irritated that she continuously contradicted his advances “We are room partners now, are we not? Might as well get along”</p><p>Hermione eyed him up and down for a moment.</p><p>“…Fair enough” Still not convinced, it seemed. Why was she so wary of him?</p><p>“So, what subjects are you interested in?” Tom asked casually, rearranging himself on the couch.</p><p>She sent him an incredulous look. He shrugged.</p><p>“I suppose I could say charms, care of magical creatures and ancient runes are my favorite ones” Hermione replied unenthusiastically.</p><p>“Not one for potions, then?” He wondered, his mouth quirking innocently. He ran a hand through his hair and noticed she followed the movement with her eyes.</p><p>“I do enjoy potions, but it’s not my favorite topic” She had let her book down by now and had crossed her arms defensively.</p><p>“Do you brew some potions now and then?” At her raise of eyebrow he shrugged once more “Slughorn leans me his lab sometimes. He asked me to brew a potion for him one of these days. You’re in his club as well, so I thought maybe he use to do the same to you.”</p><p>Her legs shifted, he took the moment to observe how delicate her heels seemed.</p><p>“What potion did you brew?” She spoke, resting her head on her hand as she propped her elbow on the back of the sofa, much like him.</p><p>Tom smiled mischievously, mostly because he was getting into the topic to get her red handed.</p><p>“Amortentia” He answered in a breathy tone.</p><p>She furrowed her eyebrows and recoiled some more, looking down to her other hand on her lap “…Oh”</p><p>“Have you smelt it?” Tom asked, sliding closer to her.</p><p>“What?” Her eyes snapped up back to his.</p><p>Tom chuckled “The fragrance of Amortentia”</p><p>She shook her head at him in annoyance, mouth bent “Of course I did, we had to brew it last year”</p><p>His eyes flashed “What did you smell?”</p><p>She looked at him with a stone expression on her face “That is a very personal question, don’t you think?”</p><p>His eyebrows raised and he looked aside, feigning indifference “Perhaps” He returned his gaze to her “Wouldn’t you like to know what I smelt?”</p><p>Hermione furrowed her eyebrows, looking truly confused “You smelt something on Amortentia?”</p><p>An alarm triggered on his mind. His head tilted and he raised an eyebrow at her “Why would I not?”</p><p>A second alarm ringed when she seemed to panic for a flick of second. She shifted and scratched the nape of her neck, crouched against the back of the sofa.</p><p>“Well… you don’t seem the type of guy who pays much attention to girls, so…” She replied, tensely, he noticed “I just thought you weren’t interested in anyone as to feel their scent on the potion”</p><p>Something definitely seemed off about her attitude and it was not just about how he was certain she had tinged his drink with a love potion. She was a terrible liar, her excuse was just awful. Why did she think that he would not smell anything on the concoction, however, was a mystery, one which distressed him slightly and that he intended to uncover.</p><p>However, first things first. He was about to catch this one fish before.</p><p>He chuckled internally, a wide grin curled his lips. She was so getting wrapped on her own web now.</p><p>“So, you do pay attention to what<em> I</em> pay attention to or not, <em>Hermione</em>?” Tom purred teasingly.</p><p>He delighted in the way she blushed fervently and huffed.</p><p>“I do not!” She exclaimed outraged “It’s plainly obvious, just that” He noticed she rolled her eyes slightly “Twice a week there is a girl getting dumped by you after a class”</p><p>He bit his lip deviously, smirking widely still “So you are stalking me, is that it?”</p><p>“Merlin, no!” She breathed out exasperated and ran a hand through her face. She glared daggers at him then “Where are you getting with this?”</p><p>He threw a cynical smile at her, which fell soon after, the he leaned towards her.</p><p>“Say, Hermione, did you brew a love potion recently?”</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as if she was about to ask him what kind of question was that out of a sudden.</p><p>“No, logically not” She replied, letting out a soft chuckle at the absurd question.</p><p>Tom’s hand moved to grip the back of the couch, he straightened his neck to look at her firmly and directly.</p><p>“Perhaps got some smuggled from <em>Madam Primpernelle's</em>?” He pressed.</p><p>“What the bloody…?” She shook her head “What are you going on about, Riddle?” Hermione was by now confused and angry. She leaned towards him as well, facing his strange questions.</p><p>He pursed his lips and smiled cruelly at her “Why, Hermione. I am going on about you dousing me with a love potion, because I see no other reason to smell <em>you </em>on the Amortentia I brewed the week before!”</p>
