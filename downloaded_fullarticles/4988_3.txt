    <p>
  <span>Christmas Eve was such an odd time to be nominally Jewish in the wizarding world.  Of course, Tina and Queenie had their share of office Christmas parties that they'd attended with good humor, but at home on a day Queenie was off and Tina was last on the on-call list, the Goldstein sisters faced one of the most popular celebrations in both worlds armed with cocoa and popular mystery novels to kill time until a reasonable hour for bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Until an insistent tapping on their window broke the companionable silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'll get it," Queenie said dully, uncurling herself from her chair.  "How much do you want to bet it's a Christmas card from Mr. Abernathy?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Ten Sprinks," Tina said, not looking up from her book.  "But I'd put twenty on it being from—"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, Teenie, you've got to see this owl!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The brunette witch placed her bookmark (she </span>
  <em>
    <span>would</span>
  </em>
  <span> be interrupted just when she was getting to an interesting part) and turned around only to see what had to be the largest, most colorful owl she'd ever seen in her life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Isn't he just beautiful?  And Teenie, it's addressed to you!"  Queenie bounced, untying the letter from the bird's ankle with deft fingers before handing it to her sister.  Surely enough, there was her name in formal but shaky characters: </span>
  <em>
    <span>Miss Porpentina Goldstein, somewhere in New York City, U.S.A.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>"Gosh, Teenie, is that from Europe?"  Tina ignored her sister's questioning as she opened the letter and began to read.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dear Miss Goldstein,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I hope this letter finds you and your sister in good health.  My ship landed in Liverpool this morning after an uneventful voyage, and I will be heading to London shortly; the first order of business is to have the latch on my case reinforced to avoid any future incidents.  If this reaches you before Christmas, Happy Christmas to you; if not, may you have a Happy New Year.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I was wondering if I might ask a favour of you.  At the risk of confessing to questionably-legal interactions with a No-Mag (or is it spelt No-Maj? You'll have to tell me) to a newly-reinstated officer of the law, I have reason to believe that shortly before my departure, our friend Jacob came into possession of valuable goods, courtesy of an anonymous benefactor, and will thus be able to start his bakery business.  I understand this is a rather large request, but would you look in, if you have the time, and tell me how it is doing?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Please excuse the faults which this letter contains. Picket is fond of clinging to the quill as I write.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Respectfully,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Newton Scamander</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>P.S. Nigel has a habit of begging for treats even when it's not good for him.  Don't fall for the mooncalf-eyes; he'll make himself ill on them if given the chance.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>"You have to remember he's shy and damaged, Teenie," Queenie, who'd obviously picked up on her sister's confusion, said dreamily.  "He probably thought he'd be pushing it too far to ask to see you again </span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> ask to write to you at the same time."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina stared at the stilted letter in her hand some more.  "I thought it was understood, though.  He would have had to write to me anyways to let me know when to expect him with the book.  He didn't need an excuse to write."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Being an expert in dealing with magical creatures doesn't make someone an expert at dealing with the fairer sex.  Write him back something warm and inviting.  He'll get the message."  The blonde smiled beatifically as she dug through one of the desk drawers.  "Jacob's bakery…I wonder if he'll have strudel."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Queenie…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm not thinking about...that.  Patronizing a business belonging to a No-Maj you happen to have known before they were Obliviated is technically considered necessary daily business," Queenie said with a sniff.  "In any case, you have a letter to write."  She whirled around with quill and parchment, setting them down with finality in front of her sister.  "Remember…warm and inviting."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I've never written anything warm and inviting in my life.  I can barely </span>
  <em>
    <span>say</span>
  </em>
  <span> warm and inviting," Tina protested.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're warm and inviting enough that he asked if he could travel all the way across the Atlantic to hand-deliver a book you'd be able to buy at Inker's," Queenie pointed out.  "I know you like to think of yourself as a hardened career girl, but it'd do you good to find someone you can be soft for."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But—"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not another word until the letter's written," the blonde said firmly.  "And you can stop worrying about Leta Lestrange.  I've heard enough to know he's not the kind of man to string along a girl on each continent, and besides, she hurt him very badly."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina sighed and stared at the parchment.  She could do this.  If she could lay down twelve curses in under a second without saying a word, she could write a letter that would convince Mr. Newt Scamander to write her back.  Before she could lose her nerve (not like writing letters to an unconventionally-attractive foreigner would make her lose her nerve, oh no) she grabbed the quill and began to scribble her thoughts as they came to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dear Mr. Scamander,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Thank you for your letter; it arrived on the 24th, so your Christmas well-wishes are appreciated and returned.  I'm glad to hear you reached England safely, and I'm doubly glad you're getting that latch fixed!  Are you staying in England until the book is published?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Queenie and I have spent a little time looking for Jacob over the last few weeks, strictly to follow up on the Obliviation, you understand.  We haven't seen anything so far to indicate he's opened a bakery, but we'll keep looking around.  I expect it's taking him some time to get everything set up; No-Maj shops have a tendency to take weeks to turn from empty storefronts to open businesses.  For future reference, as long as the valuable goods the No-Maj was given aren't magical in substance, there's technically nothing illegal about providing them to a No-Maj.  Technically.  Largely because I doubt there has ever been a case of a wizard or witch wanting to give a non-magical item of substantial value to a No-Maj before, so no one has thought to write a law about it.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>(Please don't tell me you gave him an Erumpent horn, because I would really rather not have to investigate you professionally.)</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Say hello to Picket for me; Queenie sends her greetings to you.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Sincerely,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Porpentina Goldstein</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>P.S.  I've never sent an owl transatlantic before, and I don't think I've seen an owl of Nigel's species before.  He looked fine when he got here and when he left, but is there anything I should know to do in the future? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina looked over the letter.  It didn't seem...warm, not really, but it didn't sound cold either.  And she was pretty sure asking a question (particularly about something non-human) was a clear invitation for a reply.  Well, at the end of the day, he'd either decide she was worth writing back to or not; no use trying to sound like anyone other than herself.  She sighed, folding the parchment and writing the address on the back side: </span>
  <em>
    <span>Mr. N. Scamander, Current Location Unknown but Most Likely Britain</span>
  </em>
  <span>.  "Here goes nothing."</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Two weeks later in rural Yorkshire, a very exhausted owl belonging to a species never normally seen in the area silently slipped into what looked from the outside like an abandoned barn.  The interior, however, was far from abandoned, containing no less than ten Bowtruckles, two Nifflers, three Augureys, and one bedraggled man bent intently over a stack of parchment resting on an upturned manger that was serving as a makeshift desk.  The owl landed heavily on one of the manger legs and hooted loudly, interrupting the man's concentration.  He blinked briefly, then seemed to register the carefully-folded parchment tied to the bird's claw and immediately rushed to retrieve the letter and open it up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man glanced briefly at the contents of the letter, grinned like a schoolboy, and stuffed the parchment into his pocket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"All right, Nigel.  Let's look you over and get you a decent meal; looks like you're going to be doing a lot more flying than you ever expected."</span>
