</div><p>Remus’ eyes, caught in the warm afternoon light, are the exact same colour as the glass of tea he’s sipping. Sirius, not for the first time, finds himself staring.</p><p>
“Something wrong?”
</p><p>
Remus has spoken lazily, the way he generally does when he’s sober and relatively at ease — as ease as people in their position can ever hope to be, that is. And yet, Sirius understands him well enough to know what’s stirring under the placid surface of his handsome brow: the paranoia, the frantic drafting of contingency plans, the weighing of options...
</p><p>
“Come with me,” he says, abruptly. Remus blinks, nonplussed. “Come with me,” insists Sirius, the mere idea filling his heart with a peculiar joyful feeling he didn’t know himself capable of. “Back home, to England. I’ll put you up. No obligations, mind, I understand if you don’t feel the same way, it’s just that I...”
</p><p>
He trails off, the enormity of what he had been about to say hitting him all of a sudden. Remus, his bright eyes still trained on Sirius’ face, takes another sip of his tea. His face is unreadable. Sirius feels positively deflated.
</p><p>
“Right, scrap that. Are you staying for dinner? I wouldn’t say no to a couple more rounds of blinis, if I’m being hon—”
</p><p>
“Do you mean it?”
</p><p>
“What? About the blinis?”
</p><p>
“About wanting me to come to England.”
</p><p>
“Oh. Oh, yeah. Of course I do. We’ll have to get you a job, eventually, but like I said I could definitely put you up in the beginning. I’d love it, actually. I might have to call in a couple of favours to get you into the country, but it shouldn’t be too much trouble, all things considered...”
</p><p>
“Actually,” says Remus, setting his glass on the table. Sirius stares at his face, transfixed. Remus grins — the merest upturning of the corners of his mouth, really, but exhuberant in contrast with his recent bouts of melancholy — and covers Sirius' hand with one of his own. “Actually, I’m quite positive that getting me into your country won’t be any trouble at all, love. I have information that could turn your precious Circus upside down. How soon can you cable London? I need to speak to Lucius Malfoy.”
