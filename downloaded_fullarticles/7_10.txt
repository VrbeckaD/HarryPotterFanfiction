    <p>Tears stream down my face as soon as I walk back into the house, the house I left only mere minutes ago. My heart was beating loudly as I dared to go back inside. The front door was ajar and it was too quiet. The sound of my brother and his dear wife bickering playfully long gone. My chest felt tight from this new change of atmosphere. I didn’t like it one bit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I left James’ house to go retrieve a gift I had gotten for Harry since this had been the first time I’d seen him. My brother and I weren’t on good terms either until tonight. He finally apologized for something he did, so I immediately came over, leading to this current event.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I push Harry’s gift deep into my pocket as I proceed into the house.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I immediately spot legs hanging over the stairs at the top. My eyes widen and my heart stops as I race to the top, only to find my dear brother dead. “J... James…” I croak out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I don’t get a response I fall to the ground and cling onto him, begging him to wake up. “Please... Please, James. I just got you back. Please. You can’t leave me,” I say begging to him, as I bury my face into his chest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A small wail snaps me out of it and I'm brought back to reality. I kiss my brother’s forehead before rushing into Harry’s room only to stop once more and see my sister-in-law’s dead body. I felt sick to my stomach once more and extremely dizzy. This can’t be happening.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, no, no, Lily! Please wake up! You can’t leave me either!” I beg as I shake her gently.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I receive no response but only some sniffles from the baby I kiss her on the head as well and turn to the crib. My eyes widen and a gasp leaves my lips. I pick up Harry and hold him close to me. There was a deep scar on his forehead. I start rocking Harry in an attempt to calm both of us down.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Voldemort was here but Harry survived. That was the only thing I could process. I felt so sick, so vulnerable. I didn’t know what to do. My breathing stops slightly when I hear someone coming up the stairs. I quickly put Harry back down into the crib and transform into my animal. Being an (illegal) Animagus, my animal is a baby Dingo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don’t understand why that is my animal, but I love it. Once I am fully morphed into my animal I quickly hide under the crib and go into an attacking position. Dingoes may be cute but they are aggressive as fuck. So whoever comes in and tries to touch Harry will be dead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, instead, I’m left in shock. Severus Snape is here. Once he sees Lily’s body, it’s like his whole world shattered. It was a heartbreaking scene, especially for me, for I am in love with Severus. It hurt to see this play out but I can’t help but watch. I curl up into a ball as he sobs and holds her body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That give s me a moment to let reality set in. My parents are dead. They died a few weeks ago from Dragon Pox. Now my twin brother, James, and my sister-in-law are dead. The only family I have is Harry. He’s just a baby. I don’t know how to take care of tiny humans!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I almost let out a whine until I hear a very extremely familiar voice that I haven’t heard in forever. It is Professor Albus Dumbledore. I don’t pay attention since all I was thinking about is how alone I would be. Finally, though it is just Dumbledore. He lets out a long heavy sigh before he speaks my name softly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I am deeply sorry Miss (Name) Potter,” He says as I crawl out from under the crib.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I morph back into my normal self before I start crying holding Harry now. “H-How did this happen? Why did it happen?!” I ask as I cradle the baby close to me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He frowns deeply, “I’ll have to explain it to you later Miss Potter. Right now I need to get everything cleaned up because the Wizard World is very, very frightened. Rumors have already been spread around and once the truth gets out, there will be so much dread. Until then I should let you think about what you’re going to do with Harry and yourself.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I nod and as a spell leaves his lips; I hold the baby close to me to ensure his safety since Dumbledore is going to transport me to my home. Or rather, my deceased parent’s home. It’s no longer a home without them. I see that I’m in my room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I frown deeply before my lip twitches and I hold back a cry. I look at Harry and he’s just staring back up at me. The tears from earlier had dried on his cheeks as his beautiful green eyes, that he got from his mother, look up at me as if he’s concerned. I laugh weakly at that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He’s adorable. He’s the only thing I have now. However, that’s not enough now. It feels like an eternity when it’s most likely just a few hours before I speak. “I should have died instead of them,” I whisper softly, now staring at the sleeping baby.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Nonsense my dear!” A familiar voice spoke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I quickly look up and see the half-giant wizard, Hagrid. A grim expression on his face as he stares at me before Harry. “Have you figured out what ye want to do?” He asks as he nods at Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I frown and nod my head as tears start filling my eyes. “This is going to be the worst decision I will ever make but I can’t. I just can’t take care of him. I can barely take care of myself!” I say trying to be quiet as tears run down my face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I lost all of my family this month. My parents, now my brother and sister-in-law. Harry is the only family I have left. I can’t bear to watch myself lose him in my care. I would be a horrible aunt anyways,” I say as I start to hiccup through my words.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He looks at me sincerely, “Are you sure?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, but I have to. I just can’t take care of him. Not like this,” I say.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He nods understanding as he gently takes Harry from my hold. I bite my lip hard at this and he gives me an apologetic look. “Dumbledore will be with you in an hour or two. (Name), please take care.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With that, he leaves. I feel all the emotions running through me and I start screaming and trashing my room out in anger before I’m left sobbing in the middle of the mess. I don’t know how long I was there crying but Dumbledore appears and tells me how Voldemort killed them because someone betrayed my brother.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dumbledore tells me he’ll keep in touch but that doesn’t help. Nothing is going to help. For I’m alone now. Alone and completely numb.</p>
