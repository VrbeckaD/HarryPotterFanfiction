          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Daddy?"</p>
<p>Severus looked up at his five year old daughter. "Yes Summer?"Â </p>
<p>"Do you want to build a snowman?"</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>After finishing marking, Harry went outside to watch his husband and daughter but found the grounds empty.</p>
<p>Checking his map showed them both in muggle studdies.</p>
<p>Opening the door, Harry's jaw dropped at not only Summer signing and dancing along to a film but Severus also.</p>
<p>When Severus climbed in bed Harry played tug of war with the covers until Severus pulled hard, leaving Harry bare.</p>
<p>"That's okay, the cold never bothered me anyway." Harry said, laughing at Severus' groan.</p></div>
