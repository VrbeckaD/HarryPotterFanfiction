    <p>
  <span>Bill yawned slightly as he made his way into the main office at his usual time. While Gringotts was a massive bank, they somehow managed to find the smallest, dingiest space for their curse breakers to convene when they weren’t out searching tombs and such for booby-trapped treasure. Though he supposed it didn’t really matter. They spent more time out in the field than they did in here anyway. It was more for the administrative staff and there wasn’t much need for a large staff.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You alright?” another curse-breaker - Marcus McAdams - asked as he eyed the tall, lanky ginger man curiously, a cup of tea halfway to his mouth. “Not out with some bird until the wee hours of the morning, were you?” The man offered him a mischievous wink.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Unfortunately, no,” Bill said dryly. Not entirely an untrue statement, though he found that his work kept him rather busy in the hot deserts of Egypt. Plus it’s not like there were a plethora of women to choose from - all the current curse-breakers were of the male variety and Bill just didn’t swing that way. Sure there were the locals and other expats there for various work assignments, but the magical community wasn’t very large and Bill had grown weary of how quickly the rumour mill worked there. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McAdams gave him a perplexed look, drawing Bill back to the conversation at hand. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Got a new neighbor late last night. Whoever they are, they were blasting rock music pretty late. Nearly got up to complain,” Bill said, stifling yet another yawn. Whoever it was, Bill already felt a vast amount of annoyance for them, though they had yet to meet.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ah, must be the new curse breaker. Some Yank by the name of Parker Eckley,” McAdams said. “Supposed to be top notch. Best the US has to offer.” Bill just shrugged, not really caring too much about the mysterious addition’s accolades. Just so long as he did his job right and no one got killed because of him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“At least he won’t need training,” Bill said with a sigh, thinking to the last person to join their team. It was a young bloke straight out of training in England. He had lasted all of three weeks before requesting a transfer back and a more administrative role. Curse-breaking wasn’t for everyone, Bill knew. He had just wished that the man had figured that out before wasting all their time. McAdams chuckled as he sipped his tea.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Should think not. Swiped him from Deloittes, from what I hear. Paid double get him over here for Gringotts,” he said. A tiny bit of appreciation snuck into Bill’s thoughts. Deloittes was the top wizarding bank in the massive North American country. He had met a few of theirs while out and they had all been good. Really good. This new one must be one of the best if Gringotts had offered him a lot to sway him into employment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Might not be so keen once he’s got a good look at our offices,” Bill said, glancing around the room. While it was rather nondescript, part of him knew that there was a reason for it. They didn’t want anyone to suspect that here was where they stored countless priceless treasures before they were shipped back to the main bank in London. There were an extensive number of protective wards and charms on it, making it impossible for anyone to enter until they had passed several levels of security checks. Any muggles that came nearby would have the overwhelming urge to go home, some forgotten task popping up in their minds. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was probably the safest place in Egypt, though it lacked a certain comfiness to it. At least they had managed to set the team up in modest, yet comfortable flats in the same block of buildings. The one across from Bill had been empty for the whole two months it took to find the last bloke’s replacement.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He hoped that since the new person was coming with a measure of experience, than meant he wouldn’t have to coddle him. The last one had been a bit of a nuisance, intruding on his private time more often than not, asking a seemingly unending amount of questions. It wasn’t that Bill wasn’t social - he was always down for a good night out - but he preferred that his flat be his own personal sanctuary. Growing up with six siblings had caused him to value finally having his own space a mite bit more than others. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ready to head out?” Bill asked. “And will this Eckley be joining us?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Unlikely. Said they gave him a couple days to get settled before joining us. Rogers is seeing to him now, but Miller should meet us there,” McAdams said. Bill nodded and pushed up from the old sofa. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Best to get started…”</span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>~~~</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bill squinted in the bright sun, making his way towards the entrance of the tomb where they were to be working that day. To the muggle tourists that always seemed about, it appeared as though they were just another dig site, though it was anything but. Bill had done the charms and spells protecting them from muggle discovery himself and knew that no one would bother them. They had been working on breaking down the outer wards of the tomb for the better part of a few weeks at that point, finding them much trickier than others. While some of the team were getting frustrated, Bill enjoyed the challenge and the thrill of it. Besides, stronger wards often meant for a bigger payoff.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He walked through the entrance and stopped a moment, allowing his eyes to adjust to the sudden change in light. He could hear voices coming from down the path and assumed the others had already arrived. Gripping his wand a bit more tightly, he continued down the dirt corridor, making his way through the tunnel to where they had left off the day before. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not so sure that’s a good idea. We really should wait for the others,” he heard Miller say, a cautious edge to his voice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Nonsense. I’ve done this before,” a distinctly feminine voice replied. Bill frowned slightly as he picked up his pace. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But you just got here. Surely you’re a bit peaked as it is. Really you didn’t need to come in today,” Rogers said. “I thought you just wanted to look around the site-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh shut up,” the woman replied smartly. “I could do this in my sleep.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Really, I wish you’d wait until Weasley got here - he’s the best on our team,” Rogers pushed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Step aside, gentlemen. This is woman’s work,” the woman said a bit haughtily.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Really, you-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bill had just rounded a corner in time to see a short, petite woman dressed in khaki shorts and a white button-up shirt wave her wand as she muttered an incantation. A sudden wind filled the room, blowing her long, dark pony-tail behind her. There was then a large explosion and the chamber filled with dust and smoke. Bill reacted immediately, running up to the woman and wrapping his arms around her, pulling her away as large chunks of rock flew out and hit the ground where she had been standing as they tumbled to the dirt floor. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Eckley!” someone shouted. After coughing a bit, Bill looked down at the woman, seeing a bright grin on her dirt-streaked face as she gazed up at him, a devilish glint in her dark brown eyes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, hello. You must be Bill Weasley,” she said playfully. Bill frowned down at her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just what are you trying to do? Kill us all?” he shouted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I knew what I was doing,” she said, patting him on his arm. “Now as much as I love this position, you mind letting me up? I need to check my work.” She wriggled a bit underneath him and it was at that moment Bill realized just how much of their bodies were touching. There was a shiver of something that went through him, but he quickly rolled off and watched as she quickly hopped to her feet, dusting herself off. She then retrieved her wand and stuck it in her hair as she walked over to the now gaping passageway.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As Bill got to his feet, he watched as she inspected the passageway, putting first her hand through it. Upon seeing no resistance, she then walked through it a bit before turning and grinning at the group of stunned men in various states of messiness around her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Told you it would work,” she said, grinning brightly. Bill just gaped at her. It seemed as though she had no sense of safety whatsoever in her petite body. Granted it wasn’t as though he had much more, but his was a lack for his own personal safety. He’d never do anything that would put the team at risk.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Excuse me, but just what the hell are you doing here?” he asked, his annoyance clear. She turned her bright eyes to him, her smile growing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Allow me to introduce myself,” she said, walking towards him with her hand out. “Parker Eckley, though everyone calls me Parker.” Bill was confused. This was the American? The so-called expert curse breaker? Was this some kind of joke?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Parker’s smile faded slightly when he refused to shake her hand, but she just turned to McAdams, making her way over to him. The man had a dazed smile on his face as he eagerly shook her hand. Even Miller and Rogers seemed enraptured with her, despite the fact that she had just very well nearly killed them all. What the hell was wrong with everyone?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Brilliant work,” Rogers said, moving to the passageway to inspect it. “We’ve been trying to get that blasted passage open for a week.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sometimes you just gotta be a bit rough with it,” she said, winking at Bill. He only blinked, though he couldn’t help but think she was rather attractive, her skin a warm tan shade underneath the dirt. He wondered if it was as soft as it looked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bloody hell, had he hit his head? What was that thought? He shook his head and continued to frown as he moved to look at the passageway. True, it was now finally open to them, but there surely was a better way to go about it than blasting the damn thing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We were almost there,” he said, not looking at her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yea, well, I sped things up for you a bit,” she replied. Bill looked over his shoulder at her, seeing a smug smile had come over her features. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“For someone so talented, your lack of regard to the safety of your team is appalling,” he replied, the vague thought that he sounded far too much like his younger brother Percy quickly passing through his mind. Since when had he ever sounded like Percy?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, come now, Weasley. You’ve pulled off your fair share of daring moves,” Rogers said with a chuckle. Bill glared at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But not at the expense of my team,” he said curtly, turning back to the passageway. He held his wand up, edging into it cautiously as he started going through a few spells to check for further wards and charms of protection.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Someone got up on the wrong side of the bed today,” he heard Eckley mutter behind him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Would have been better if someone hadn’t been blasting rock music until the early hours of the morning,” he retorted. He was rewarded with a chuckle, causing him to look back. The playful smug look had returned to her face, though there was something else in her eyes that he couldn’t quite make out. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yea, I think I’ll like it here,” she said. “Come on boys. Let’s get to work.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>~~~</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If Bill had been hoping for some sort of ally in dealing with the new addition to the team, he found none. Eckley had quickly won over everyone on the team and even had the prim and proper Miller hanging on to her every word.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In fact, it seemed only Bill found her overgrown sense of confidence grating. She seemed every bit as arrogant as the cliches about Amercians. Her laugh was too loud. Her smile too bright. Her stories too wild. And stories she had plenty of. She had spent a fair amount of her time traveling around Latin and South America, working her way through many Mayan and Aztec ruins. She had also become proficient in a handful of local languages, often slipping into one or the other to impress the others. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He had hoped to slip off and gain some silence from it all, but McAdams had wrangled him out into a round of drinks after work that night to welcome Eckely. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So there he sat at the table, watching as the three other members of the team hung on to her every word as she made her way through a glass of whiskey, often smiling and winking at one or the other here and there.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He supposed in any other circumstance he might find her exciting. Even charming. Merlin knew it had been awhile since he had met any woman remotely as captivating. But he couldn’t quite seem to get over the fact that she annoyed him beyond belief. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Though, he couldn’t help as a small part of him was impressed. She was sure in her work, and a bit more creative than the rest of them had been. Offering up solutions to getting around charms that even he hadn’t thought of. Though he wasn’t about to admit that out loud. He still had a bit of pride left in him, after all. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He continued watching her, seeing her pull her long pony-tail over her shoulder as she twirled it absentmindedly with a long, slender finger. It left her neck exposed and for a moment, he wondered what it would be like to kiss the soft flesh. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bill’s eyes widened slightly as he quickly looked away, taking a large drink of his whiskey.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, what’s your story, Billy?” she asked playfully across the table. He looked back at her, perturbed at the nickname. Was it some sort of American thing? And really, the woman barely knew him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s Weasley,” he replied, narrowing his eyes slightly. She only chuckled in response. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Someone’s wound a bit tight,” she said, leaning across the table. His eyes drifted lower slightly, taking in the fact that she had unbuttoned a few of the top buttons on her shirt, providing him a view that he wasn’t about to admit that he enjoyed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wouldn’t let it get to you. Likely his pride is a bit wounded after you got through more wards today than he has in the last several,” McAdams said with a chuckle. Bill glared at the man, viewing him as a traitor. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is not,” he replied. The others just laughed as Eckley smiled at him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“There’s always tomorrow,” she replied before finishing off her drink and then standing. “Well… I’m a bit tuckered. See you in the morning.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She then sauntered out of the pub, leaving every man on the team watching her walk away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Bloody hell, she’s fit,” Rogers said admiringly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Stop thinking with your prick,” Bill muttered, taking another drink. Rogers frowned at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Even you have to admit that she’s brilliant,” he said, sounding almost as though he were whining. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not unless she gets us all killed,” he retorted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We weren’t in any harm,” Miller said rationally. Bill just glared at him before finishing his own drink and slamming his glass down on the table.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m done here.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>~~~</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bill stopped on the stairs that led to the landing outside the two flats, glaring towards the door opposite his as loud rock music pulsed through it. She </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> trying to kill him, wasn’t she?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He then started up the stairs and made his way to her door, knocking loudly on it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, hello, Billy- I mean, Weasley,” Eckley said, an amused smile on her face. She had changed into a pair of athletic shorts and a t-shirt with a thunderbird logo on the front. Her long hair was still damp from the shower. “What can I do for you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Could you please keep the music down a bit?” he asked tensely. “Others in the building would like to sleep.” Eckley tilted her head to the side, studying him closely. He had to admit that it made him want to squirm slightly, but he wasn’t about to lose face in front of her. He also couldn’t help but find her eyes enchanting. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bloody hell, he really had hit his head today, didn’t he? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course. Sorry. Didn’t realize I had it up so loud,” she said, smiling. She glanced over her shoulder into the flat and then back at him. “Care to join me for a nightcap?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No,” Bill said blandly before turning and quickly making his way to his flat. Once he was inside and the door shut, he sighed and leaned against it as he heard the music soften. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This woman was going to be the death of him. Perhaps literally.</span>
