  <span>Hermione ran her fingers through the coarse fur of her lioness, Cleo. She was nervous for today, even though she had been to the magical world many times. Her mother gripped her shoulder, sensing her fear, and her father stood close behind, offering support after smelling her fear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had acknowledged multiple times in her life where she was lucky to have a Sentinel-Guide pair as parents; otherwise coming online as an Alpha, </span>
  <em>
    <span>magical</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sentinel could have been disastrous.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not that Alpha Black would have let anything happen to her. He was practically a second parent, and Harry, his godson, was a brother to her. He grinned at her from the other side of Alpha Black. His black panther, Ixion, prowled his outside flank. Ixion didn’t like the magical world’s obsession with Harry, and let anyone who came near know with a soft growl. Cleo had agreed to help his cause and did the same on her side. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sooner than she realized, they were in front of the train and it was time to go. She bounced softly on her feet. Her father stepped in front of her, resting both his hands heavy on her shoulders. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How are your channels?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took a moment to check before nodding. “I’m okay, nervous, but they are all balanced.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded jerkily and Mom put a hand on his shoulder and hers. Hermione didn’t need to be a guide to know that her dad was nervous as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sentinel McGonagall will be there,” Alpha Black said after saying his goodbyes to Harry, “As well as a Guide Pomona.” Alpha Black shifted Hermione and Harry in front of him. “If there is a problem, anything at all, you go first to Sentinel McGonagall. Understood?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Alpha,” they said. </span>
