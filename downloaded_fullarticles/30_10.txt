    <p>Harry stared at the large bed. “There must be some mistake,” he spoke, addressing the bellman. He knew he’d be sharing a room with Malfoy at the hotel, but it was supposed to have been a double room not a single. </p><p>“I’m sorry sir,” the young man apologised. “This is the assigned room. I can call the front desk, but we’re booked up because of the wedding.”</p><p>Hearing a door click, Harry looked up to see Malfoy entering the room from what he assumed was the loo. “It’s no use, Potter,” he shrugged. “I called the front desk and the only other hotel that wasn’t a hovel. Everywhere is booked up. We either share, or we go home. And you and I both know that we’ll never be forgiven if we leave.”</p><p>Harry sighed deeply. He was more afraid of Ginny’s reaction if he wasn’t here than he was of sharing a bed with Malfoy. “Yea, alright,” Harry muttered. “We’ll make it work.”</p><p>He tipped the bellman and stepped into the room to attempt to get settled. As he pulled his suit out to hang it, he noticed Malfoy watching him. Ginny had insisted that the two be civil since she had started dating Pansy. As the two had grown closer, it meant that Harry and Malfoy spent more time together, as well. It wasn’t entirely awful and they could now carry on a conversation, but they were not friends by any means. </p><p>Harry had known that they would be sharing a room. As the only single guys in their immediate group of friends and acquaintances, it couldn’t really be helped. Harry had hoped to be paired with Charlie. He had been a diehard bachelor, much to his mother’s chagrin, and Harry usually had a very good time when they had to share a room for a family function. But even Charlie had a date for the wedding. Ginny had been surprised that it was a woman, but Harry knew him well enough to know that he didn’t care about gender. It was the person that mattered to Charlie. And Joanna seemed just as lively as he was. </p><p>He stepped into the bathroom to put the rest of his things away. When he reentered the main room, Malfoy was still watching him. He had an odd look on his face, as if he was thinking about something and doubting himself. “Out with it, Malfoy,” Harry groaned. “You look like you’re about to bust.”</p><p>Malfoy laughed lightly as he looked at Harry. “I don’t know why, but I always forget how forward you can be.” He looked at his sleeve, tugging on the cuff so that it was just right. “I find myself desperately in need of a favor, Potter.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. “What could you possibly need from me, Malfoy?”</p><p>“Your friend's mother has apparently been lunching with Pansy’s mother. This has caused her to become acquaintances with my mother.”</p><p>“Alright,” Harry huffed. “I’m still not seeing what this has to do with me.”</p><p>“They have taken it upon themselves to set me up with a date for the wedding,” Malfoy exhaled slowly. When Harry started laughing, he sneered, “I don’t know why you’re laughing. You’re next.” That stopped Harry’s laughter immediately. </p><p>“Alright,” Harry sat on the corner of the bed. “How do we get out of it?”</p><p>Malfoy sat next to him. “We have the rehearsal dinner in about an hour, right?” Harry nodded in agreement. “We’re all meeting before to get settled and make sure we know where we’re supposed to be. So, if you and I are late they’ll think we’re probably back to fighting and come look for us.”</p><p>Harry seemed to follow his train of thought. “You’re implying that we should get caught together?”</p><p>“You’re not as oblivious as everyone seems to think, Potter,” Malfoy chuckled as he shifted to recline on the bed. Harry shook his head to object, but Malfoy held his hands up to deflect his argument. “Look, it’s perfect. We get caught in a heated embrace, we attend the wedding together, and maybe even use this as a means to keep from getting blind dates to other functions. We eventually have a friendly, amenable break up and go on with our lives.”</p><p>“You seem to have put a lot of thought into this,” Harry huffed. He had to agree though, it wasn’t a bad idea. Molly had been trying to set him up with the daughters and nieces of her friends since he and Ginny had split. She couldn’t seem to understand that he was pretty happy on his own. He was perfectly content to teach and to work and spend time with his dog. He didn’t want to settle for someone, he wanted to settle with someone. </p><p>Malfoy seemed to be encouraged by the fact that he hadn’t said no flat out. “I’ve thought about it since I saw that we had just one bed in our shared room. At first, I thought it was Pansy trying to set us up with each other again. Why she thinks that’s a good idea, I’ll never know. But then I realised that we could use it to our advantage. Everyone will think that we asked for a single room and assume that we’ve been seeing each other since Pansy tried to set us up.”</p><p>Harry groaned as he laid back on the bed. “If I agree to this, you have to come with me to the Yule Ball this year. I’ve been volunteered as a chaperone.”</p><p>“I’ll agree to that if you’ll come to the Ministry Christmas party with me.”</p><p>Harry extended his hand for Malfoy to shake. “Deal.”</p>
