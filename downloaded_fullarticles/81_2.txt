    <p>
  <i>Patroclus laid stretched out across Achilles like a house cat, bathing in the suns of Elysium, practically purring at the hand that combed through his hair. </i>
</p>
<p>This was how they spent most of their days, curled around each other, enjoying the peaceful silence that surrounded them. There were few words on these days. They knew each other so intimately that feelings and emotions were conveyed through touch and eyes alone. </p>
<p>“Sometimes I forgot,” Achilles suddenly spoke, his voice thick and raspy from disuse.</p>
<p>“Forget what?” Patroclus asked, cracking an eye open to look up at his blonde partner. </p>
<p>Deep in thought, Achilles was staring off into the distance.</p>
<p>“The time before. It’s been so long that I forget all we had to go through to get here. It just feels like this is how it’s always been.”</p>
<p>Patroclus hummed in response and closed his eyes again, pushing further into the other’s hand as if demanding him to continue. </p>
<p>“There’s one thing I do remember though,” The blonde said, looking down at him.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“The promise you made me in that cave on Pelion.”</p>
<p>This caused the brunette to sit up. The smile that Achilles gave him was blinding. </p>
<p>“You mean the promise that you made me give you,” the brunette laughed.</p>
<p>“Technicalities,” Achilles shrugged, feigning nonchalance. The sparkle in his eyes gave him away. </p>
<p>Before he knew what happened, Achilles had shifted and flipped the both of them over. Broad hands pinned much smaller ones above his head and into the soft earth below, and blonde hair tickled the sides of his face.</p>
<p>“Thank you for keeping that promise.”</p>
<p>The position would have once made Patroclus flush with embarrassment and uncertainty, but after a millennium of togetherness, it felt natural, like he belonged there. </p>
<p>“You of all people should know that I keep my promises,” he grinned, lifting his head to close the distance between them in a soft kiss.</p>
<p>“Gods, I love you,” Achilles said a little breathlessly. </p>
<p>“Yeah? Why don’t you show me,” Patroclus drawled with a smirk, rolling his hips upward into the man above him. </p>
<p>The blonde dropped his head and groaned, low and heavy.</p>
<p>“Gladly,” he growled into the hollow of the brunette’s throat. </p>
<p>Something sharp and stabbing radiated from Patroclus’s abdomen, moving in waves through his entire body. A strangled gasp fled from his lips. It took him a moment to register the feeling as pain, something foreign and long forgotten. </p>
<p>Achilles, always in tune with his partner, knew something was wrong immediately. </p>
<p>“What’s happening?”</p>
<p>Fear was laced tightly in his voice.</p>
<p>“I- I don’t know. It hurts, Achilles. Everything hurts,” he forced out, discovering that forming sentences were becoming increasingly difficult through the pain. </p>
<p>Achilles cupped his face in hands and went to reassure him, unknowing of what to do and trying to hide his all-consuming panic. </p>
<p>A light started to surround Patroclus. It was so bright that Achilles was forced to look away. He held to the darker skinned man tightly who grasped him in return. </p>
<p>Patroclus felt weightless and far off, the pain making a crescendo. He knew something was going to happen; he just didn’t know what it was.</p>
<p>“I will find you again,” he said, but his voice sounded wrong, even to his own ears. </p>
<p>“Patroclus? Patroclus, no!” Achilles screamed. Terror worked its way through his very core. </p>
<p>The light dissipated and with it, Patroclus.</p>
<p>The blonde leapt to his feet and frantically turned in every direction, praying that this was some sick joke. He called his lover’s name over and over until his voice was hoarse from the shouting and grief.  </p>
<p>There was no response. </p>
<p>
  <i>He fell to his knees, the force of it making his jaw clack together, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care. Tears swiftly followed, and he raised his head to the sky and roared.</i>
</p>
<p>/ / / </p>
<p>Harry and Draco sat on opposite sides of the plush couch in front of the fireplace that the Room of Requirement gave them earlier that night, silently enjoying the company of the other while they studied for the upcoming Potions exam. </p>
<p>The two had formed a secret and tentative acquaintance over the past few months. They wouldn’t consider themselves friends by any stretch of the word, but when one had a bad day and just needed the silent comfort of someone who understood, it only took a letter tightly attached to a school owl. </p>
<p>They didn’t talk about their feelings or spill their deepest secrets to one another. In fact, they rarely spoke at all. They had other friends that they could talk to, but those friends never understood the importance of quiet companionship. Sometimes they just desired the presence of someone else in the room with them that didn’t feel the need to interrogate or overanalyze any and every thought and action. </p>
<p>Upon their agreement, both Harry and Draco decided that it would be best if what they had together remained a secret. Word travels fast in Hogwarts, and the Dark Lord would know before the day would be out. </p>
<p>The time they spent together became beneficial in other ways. Draco, much to his denial, struggled at bit in Transfiguration, a subject that Harry was a natural at. He offered to lend a hand if Draco agreed to tutor him in Potions in return, and he reluctantly agreed.</p>
<p>“Hey, Malfoy?” Harry asked, finally breaking the silence. </p>
<p>Draco hummed in acknowledgement, not bothering to look up from his textbook. </p>
<p>“What’s the point in adding newt’s eye to this potion? From what I’ve read, it doesn’t have any magical effects here. All of the other ingredients cancel it out.” </p>
<p>“If you would have paid attention in Severus’s lecture today, you would have known that the horklump juice is highly acidic. It makes an uninhabitable environment for the honeywater. The newt’s eye takes some of that acidity away and leaves the invigorating properties of the honeywater,” he said as if he was talking about the weather. </p>
<p>Harry looked at him like he had grown a second head. </p>
<p>“You’re a bloody madman. I’m not convinced that you even understood what you just said.” </p>
<p>Draco couldn’t help but laugh. The noise sounded foreign to his own ears. The stress of the war had practically squashed any humor or mirth left in him. </p>
<p>Harry suddenly forgot how to breathe. The sound of the blonde laughing, truly laughing, at something that wasn’t his expense made his brain short-circuit. There was a tiny part of him that relished in the sound and would do nearly anything to hear it again. </p>
<p>“You know, Potter, some of us actually enjoy the art that is potion crafting,” He said, a smirk settling on his sharp features. <br/>“Art, my arse. It’s frustrating and it doesn’t make sense,” Harry grumbled.</p>
<p>This was the most they had spoken to each other in weeks.</p>
<p>“It’s not frustrating. As long as you know the reactions and contraindications of the ingredients before you start making the potion, it all falls into place.”</p>
<p>“So, you’re tell me that I just have to know every tiny detail about every potion ingredient ever?” Harry questioned.</p>
<p>He set his book down and turned to Draco, crossing his arms over his chest. </p>
<p>“No, you great dolt, of course not. Generally, you know what you’re a making beforehand, so you research the ingredients and the methods used before you even sit down in front of your cauldron.” </p>
<p>Draco’s smirk grew wider at the flush of embarrassment on Harry’s face. There was little malice in it, however. He found that Harry wasn’t too awful when he was away from his friends and the rest of the school body. If he felt like being honest, he would say that the Gryffindor teen had a razor-sharp wit, and he could give as good as he could take. </p>
<p>The astronomy clock tower signaled the time being half past 10, startling both of the boys. </p>
<p>The blonde stood and stretched, his muscles protesting from hours of disuse, and gathered his things. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s getting late, Goodnight, Scarhead,” was all he said before marching out the large oak doors. </p>
<p>Harry shook his head and sat back on the sofa. He wasn’t quite sure how they got to the point that they were, from enemies to barely friends. The events that led up to the easy banter in the Room of Requirement and secret study sessions were foggy. </p>
<p>He closed his eyes and thought back to that night in the Prefect’s bathroom. </p>
<p>
  <i>“Malfoy?” Harry ventured carefully, as not to startle the heaving blonde in front of him.</i>
</p>
<p>Draco, bracing himself on the sink with his back to the door, locked eyes with the other boy in the mirror. Fury fueled by the embarrassment of being caught replaced the anguish in an instant and he rounded on Harry, wand drawn and a curse on his lips. </p>
<p>“Woah, woah, woah. Easy there. I’m not here to hurt you,” the Gryffindor said, hands raised placatingly and in a way that one would approach and wounded beast. </p>
<p>“Then why are you here, Potter,” Draco spat taking a step closer, “Come to make fun of me? To look at ‘poor little Ferret’ and have a good laugh and something boast about to your stupid little friends later?” </p>
<p>“What? No, of course not,” Harry spluttered, taking a step backwards. </p>
<p>“Don’t think I haven’t noticed you watching me, waiting for me to slip up,” the blonde snarled, wand never wavering. </p>
<p>“Look, Malfoy, I was just trying to figure out what’s been going on. You’ve been acting strangle lately,” Harry practically spluttered. </p>
<p>This wasn’t going the way he planned. He wasn’t even sure how he planned it to go, but this wasn’t it.</p>
<p>What he said wasn’t a lie at least. Draco had been acting strange as far as Harry concerned. The insults and jibes that had been thrown his way were fewer in frequency and duller in bite. He had been distant and quiet to his own housemates and missed meals. His hair, even though still immaculate in placement, seemed less shiny, and dark circles found their way under his eyes. </p>
<p>Hermione and Ron had stared wildly at Harry when he had mentioned the last bit to them. </p>
<p>Malfoy advanced on him and the Chosen One stood his ground this time, bracing for impact. </p>
<p>Impact never came. The only thing Harry felt was hawthorne wood pressed into his throat.</p>
<p>“You have no idea what I’m going through, Potter. Just stay the fuck away from me,” Draco said lowly, eyes blazing. </p>
<p>He pushed passed Harry to leave, but a strong grip on his wrist stopped him. </p>
<p>“I may not know exactly what is happening, but I know more about what you’re going through than you think, Malfoy. We might be on two different sides of the war, but we both have societal pressures to perform in specific ways. Every action we take is monitored. We can’t say anything without it winding up in the ears of someone that didn’t need to hear. We both have close friends that we would do anything for, but they don’t understand the weight that we carry. We both have mentors that we love and respect, and they mean well, but they are misguided and often unhelpful. We both…,” Harry faltered unsure of where these words, or the bravado, was coming from, “We don’t really have anyone to come to anymore.” </p>
<p>The two stood there in silence, unmoving, for what felt like an eternity but was only likely a few seconds.</p>
<p>Draco wasn’t sure he was breathing. Every part of him was telling him to hex Harry, run, or both, but the Savior hit the proverbial nail on the head. Something about his sudden and fumbled speech resonated with him. </p>
<p>“And what exactly are you proposing,” the blonde sneered, snatching his arm out of Harry’s grasp.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. A truce? Someone to turn to when they day has been rough. Someone that gets it,” the brunette said with a shrug. </p>
<p>He really didn’t expect things to go like this. </p>
<p>“Why? So we can talk about our feelings like bloody first year girls?”</p>
<p>Harry couldn’t help but snort. </p>
<p>“Merlin, no. Lord knows we both have enough people that force that information out of us as is.”</p>
<p>Something shifted in Draco’s eyes, an unreadable expression. </p>
<p>“Considering this is the most civil conversation we’ve ever had together, why do you assume to know so much about me?” he asked with a guarded tone. </p>
<p>“Like I said, Malfoy, we have a lot more in common than you think we do,” Harry said with a half-smile. </p>
<p>Draco only hummed in reponse. He turned on his heel to leave but paused when he reached the exit. </p>
<p>“We won’t discuss what occurred in here, Scarhead,” he said with a tone of finality, there was no room for argument.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Harry replied with a short nod. </p>
<p>When Draco finally left, Harry realized that for the first time in his life, they had come to a civil agreement, and he let out a breath he didn’t know that he had been holding. </p>
<p>
  <i>“Merlin, what did I just get myself into.”</i>
</p>
<p>/ / / </p>
<p>“Harry! Where have you been? It’s an hour past curfew!” Hermione scolded, setting her book down, she was on her feet in as soon as the door closed behind him.</p>
<p>“Yeah, mate. You’ve been disappearing a lot lately. What’s going on?” Ron chimed in from his place by the fire. </p>
<p>The rest of the students in the Common Room turned to look as well out of curiosity, and Harry fought the urge to squirm under the attention. </p>
<p>“It’s nothing guys. I was just out for a walk. Trying to clear my head ‘n all,” he said, running an anxious hand through his hair. </p>
<p>“You seem to be going out for a lot of walks recently,” Hermione gently accused. </p>
<p>Rage that lied deep in Harry reared its head in his chest for a moment. </p>
<p>“Well I’ve had a lot on my mind recently if you haven’t noticed,” he snapped.</p>
<p>Hermione and Ron flinched slightly at the outburst, letting the guilt show on their faces. </p>
<p>“I-“ Ron started, but Harry didn’t let him finish. </p>
<p>“I’m going to bed. I’ll see you guys in the morning.” </p>
<p>Once Harry was in the confines of his dorm and on his bed, he felt a small bit of remorse for his attitude toward his friends. He knew that they didn’t mean any harm. They cared about him; there was no doubt about it, but he was never allowed to have any secrets, anything to himself. </p>
<p>He speculated that was why he enjoyed his time with Draco so much. There were no expectations.</p>
<p>The curtains around his bed were gingerly pulled back, and Ron poked his head in. </p>
<p>“Harry? You awake?” he asked. </p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m still up,” he said with a soft sigh. </p>
<p>“I just wanted to apologize, mate. We don’t mean to pry. We’re just worried about you. Between Voldemort and Sirius, you’ve got a lot going on, and you don’t talk to us about that shit like you used to,” he said, stepping further past the red velvet. </p>
<p>Harry felt his chest tighten at the sound of his godfather’s name, the wound still open, pulsating, and raw. </p>
<p>“You don’t have to apologize, Ron. I appreciate you guys, and I’m sorry I don’t show it enough. You know I’ve never been good at coping with this kind of stuff,” he said with a small chuckle.</p>
<p>“Really, though. I’m okay. If I weren’t, you both would be the first to know. Is ‘Mione alright?”</p>
<p>“She’s a little upset, more at herself than anything else, but she’s alright.”</p>
<p>Guilt bubbled up in Harry. </p>
<p>“I’ll apologize to her in the morning.”</p>
<p>“Don’t sweat it. We’re just glad you’re alright. S’all,” Ron shrugged, offering a smile. </p>
<p>“Yeah. Goodnight, mate,” he said, returning the smile. </p>
<p>“Night, Harry!” </p>
<p>And like that, his oldest friend was gone. </p>
<p>Harry wriggled around to get his jeans off. He kicked them off to the side somewhere and laid there in boxers and a tee, staring at the ceiling, waiting for sleep to take him. </p>
<p>/ / /</p>
<p>
  <i>He reached down to stroke the wisps of hair at my temple. I closed my eyes, but I could feel him watching me. It was a feeling that was warmer than the sun on my face. </i>
</p>
<p>A thought floated to the forefront of my mind, and I opened my eyes.</p>
<p>“Name one hero who was happy.” </p>
<p>I watched the gears turn behind his eyes. I knew he was considering every hero we had be taught about sitting by the fire at my father’s feet. </p>
<p>“You can’t,” I said, sitting up and leaning forward. </p>
<p>“I can’t.”</p>
<p>“I know. They never let you be famous and happy.” I smirked and lifted a brow. “I’ll tell you a secret.”</p>
<p>I watched his eyes brighten, and he grinned.</p>
<p>“Tell me.” </p>
<p>“I’m going to be the first,” I said, taking his palm and pressing it against mine. </p>
<p>“Swear it,” I said, urging him to agree. </p>
<p>“Why me?” </p>
<p>The look of puzzlement made my heart flutter with excitement. </p>
<p>“Because you’re the reason. Swear it.” </p>
<p>I knew I was blushing, and I knew he could see it, but I couldn’t bring myself to care. </p>
<p>“I swear it,” he said breathlessly. </p>
<p>“I swear it,” I echoed, equally as breathless. </p>
<p>We sat like that a moment, hands touching, and I felt the grin break out on my face. </p>
<p>“I feel like I could eat the world raw,” I stated as if it were something simple. </p>
<p>A trumpet blew, somewhere on the slopes beneath us. It was abrupt and ragged, as if sounded in warning. Before he could speak or move, I was on my feet, dagger out. </p>
<p>I stood poised, utterly still. It might have only been a hunting knife, but it was enough. He was here, and he was mine. Nothing was to take him from me. </p>
<p>Out of the corner of my eye, I watched him silently stand and pull out his own knife, yet he did not move beside me. He knew as well as I did that it had been a soldier’s trumpet, and battle was my gift, not his. </p>
<p>The trumpet sounded again. We heard the swish of underbrush, tangled by a pair of feet. One man. Perhaps he was lost, perhaps in danger. </p>
<p>I took a step towards the sound, placing myself firmly in front of him. </p>
<p>As if in answer, the trumpet came again. Then a voice bawled up the mountain. </p>
<p>
  <i>“Prince Achilles!”</i>
</p>
<p>/ / / </p>
<p>Harry awoke with a start, his heart racing, a thin sweat laid across his skin. </p>
<p>I swear it. Reverberated around in his rattled brain. He felt disoriented and confused. He had never had a dream like that before, and he wasn’t sure how to process the information yet. </p>
<p>I feel like I could eat the world raw. </p>
<p>He shook his head in hopes to shake the voices that had seemed to take up residence. </p>
<p>Harry fumbled for his wand and his glasses and cast a quick tempus charm. He cursed softly when he saw the time, 07:45. Breakfast was in 15 minutes, and he needed to get ready for the day. </p>
<p>A few minutes past 08:00, he trotted down the stairs to see Ron and Hermione waiting for him. </p>
<p>“Oh, hey, guys. You could have headed down by now. You didn’t have to wait on me,” he said, shooting them a smile. </p>
<p>“We figured since we were all going to the same place, might as well wait,” Hermione said. </p>
<p>“Fuckin’ finally! I’m starving,” Ron cheered, causing the two of them to laugh at his antics. </p>
<p>“Hey, Hermione?” Harry ventured, hoping she wasn’t angry with him. </p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I just wanted to apologize for snapping at you last night. I know you meant well. I’ve just been really stressed lately, but that doesn’t mean I should have taken it out on you.” </p>
<p>“Oh, Harry,” she said, pulling him into a tight hug, “You don’t need to apologize. I’m the one that should be apologizing. I know all of this is still sensitive for you, and I should have given you space. We’re just worried about you.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, ‘Mione. No hard feelings,” he said, returning the hug. </p>
<p>“Just please don’t be afraid to tell us anything,” she said sternly even though her smile shone through it. </p>
<p>“Of course. I really do love you guys, even if I don’t show it enough.” </p>
<p>“We love you too, mate, and now that we’ve gotten the smushy stuff out of the way, can we please get some breakfast now?”</p>
<p>“Jesus, Ronald. All you think about is food,” Hermione admonished, lightly smacking him in the arm with her textbook.</p>
