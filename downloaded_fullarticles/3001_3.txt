</p><p> </p><p>Last time Harry spoke to me was exactly a year ago. Which meant that we’ve broken up for a year, 2 months and 8 days now. And our anniversary is 8 months and 2 days away. Harry’s birthday is exactly three months away. </p><p> </p><p>I miss him.</p><p> </p><p>I’m not sure whether he misses me.</p><p> </p><p>I never would have thought I could’ve experienced true love in my life, I found out I was gay pretty much at the start of my puberty, but I knew my pureblood status wouldn’t allow a “freak” like that. </p><p> </p><p>Harry and I just somehow became closer after the war. Probably because Weasley had started an auror internship and Granger had accepted a small ministry job. Of course, there were also a lot of invitations for Harry, but he wanted to finish his last year at Hogwarts before he decided what he wanted in life. While in my case, all of my “Friends” had left the country in order to escape their parent’s pasts.</p><p> </p><p> And I stayed to escape revengeful victims of the war, my family has performed so many sins that even if I did leave the country there will be men chasing me down.</p><p> </p><p>I thought that Hogwarts would protect me from harm.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Harry did.</p><p> </p><p>We weren’t really friends at first, just considerably more civilized. He knew my pain, and I knew his, so we never rubbed them in each other’s face. As if by fate, Harry and I were sorted into the same eighth-year dorm rooms, though I suspect it may be McGonagall’s doing since she had encouraged all that “inter-house union” shit. </p><p> </p><p>On a warm-ish autumn night, after two bottles of the fire-whiskey, Harry had blurted out his sexuality to all of our dorm-mates. I was surprised to find him gay. The irony it brought it brought to the situation is almost humiliating. The Golden Boy, The Chosen One, has a leg for men? Not too different from the Pure Blood heir being gay.</p><p> </p><p>Once all our dorm-mates had gone to sleep, drunk, I fed Harry a strong sober-up potion and took him to the astronomy tower. I had confessed my sexuality as well. He seemed surprised at first, but he shook his head and smiled after a quick recovery. </p><p> </p><p>“Guess we are more similar than we thought we were.” He joked.</p><p> </p><p>We both knew that being gay doesn’t make anyone a different person, but it does make you look at a person in a whole new light. </p><p> </p><p>“Actually, Draco, out of all of my friends, you have been the hardest to come out to. Girls are always understanding, boys are usually fine after a while. But YOU, Draco, you’re a racist pureblood and raised near people who may probably murder their own children if they were gay. Ha, who knew you’re actually gay yourself. Must’ve been hard coming out to your parents.”</p><p> </p><p>I was too surprised by his reference of me as his <em>friend</em> to get offended. I thought of his sentence again.</p><p>Realizing that I probably should give a reply, I said: “I haven’t told my parents yet, actually. I don’t have anyone to defend for. Yes, I am gay, but I’ve been preparing myself to marry a pureblood women every since I started to remember things. I know what is going to happen to me, and I don’t see a reason to go against it.”</p><p> </p><p>But I knew that I DID have a reason to go against it now. Harry Bloody Potter was gay! The boy whom I’ve been lusting after ever since second year! The actual reason that made me realize I was gay LIKES MEN! It’s not like he would ever like me, but now we’ve all bared our deepest secrets to each other, I may have a chance…</p><p> </p><p>Right？</p><p> </p><p>We started dating not so long afterward. It was weird, how it happened, none of us asked each other out. We just got closer and started occasionally holding hands, it was a mutual gesture, neither of us remembered who started it. But finally, we had a talk in the common room where we agreed that we’ve been half-dating and should start dating. That was our anniversary. We were timid at first, being the first time we had dated our preferred gender, but we often lost our selves in kisses. I would nibble at the places that would make Harry open up his mouth and lead his hands to my hair because I knew he loved putting his hands there. He had complimented me on how soft my hair was so many times before. He said that he thought it would be stiff to the touch considering how hard it looked when I pulled my hair back with hair gel, but he told me it was soft, like strands of feathers. We often slept in each other's beds. Sometimes when he has his panic attacks, he would come to mine and when I feel especially col, I would go to his. It was our little haven.</p><p> </p><p>I never like to use the word “addicting” on lovers. It makes them feel like a forbidden item. Harry wasn’t an addiction. He was my love. </p><p> </p><p>He <em>is</em> still my love.</p><p> </p><p>We were 17 when we had our first time. My parents were in Azkaban so they obviously didn’t care when I spent my Easter holiday. We spent it at Grimmauld Place. There was no barrier, no fear of being exposed. We stopped bickering, we stopped holding back. I had confessed my love to him one afternoon, it was the only time I had been brave on the relationship front. He had straight up prepositioned me to bed after that.</p><p> </p><p>We loved each other.</p><p> </p><p>After we graduated, we both turned to the Auror office. It was quite widespread that I was dating the chosen one, and a lot of people thought that I had sneaked him a love potion or had him under the imperious curse. But the ministry had used multiple spells on Harry to detect whether he was in fact cursed, of course, they didn't detect anything.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was my sun. Dating him made me realize that I have been living in the shade all my life. But now he’s gone. I never knew how cold nights could be.</p><p> </p>
