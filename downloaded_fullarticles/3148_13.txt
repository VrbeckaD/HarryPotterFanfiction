    <p>October 31, 1981<br/>
Potter Cottage<br/>
Godric's Hollow</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lily Potter stood trembling, her one year old son in her arms. Her husband was beside her, his wand out and pointed at the door. They both knew what was happening. The Dark Lord had finally come. How did he know where they were hiding was a mystery. But he had found them. And now he was here to take away one thing that the couple cherished the most - their son. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But they were ready for the dark wizard. Lily had been thinking and preparing for this situation for a long time now. After months of consideration, of weighing the pros and cons, she had decided that the best way to protect her family was to join the Dark Lord. She was a Gryffindor, yes, but she was also a survivor. And frankly it did not make sense to her to defy the dark wizard just to get slaughtered by the mad man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It had taken a lot of pleading, begging, threatening and just everything in between to get James to agree to her plan. He was adamant about doing the right thing and not giving into evil. But when Lily had viciously told him off for choosing his moral high ground over his son, he had relented. He realized that they could never get rid of the dark wizard. Even if they ran away or hid somewhere, they'll always be looking over their shoulders. The threat, the danger would always be looming upon them. Seeing as there really was no other possible outcome where they came out alive, he had agreed to join the dark side.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So here they stood, awaiting their fate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And they didn't have to wait long. Suddenly, with a powerful burst of magic, the front door was pulled open and left hanging from its hinges. The serpentine figure of Lord Voldemort passed through the door and was momentarily surprised to see the small family gathered in front of the door instead of hiding somewhere as he had expected them to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Sssoo Potter, have you already decided to sssurrender to me?" His voice was thick with amusement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rage colored James Potter's face and he was about to give a scathing reply but to the Dark Lord's surprise, Lily Potter spoke up. "Yes, it's true. We don't want to fight you because we don't have a death wish." Her entire being was trembling as she said this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"As if you fighting me can ever be a cause of concern for me", Lord Voldemort scoffed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"That's exactly the reason we don't want to oppose you. So we have come up with a solution" Lily Potter carried on bravely. "A sssolution you ssay..." Lord Voldemort mused.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"We want to join you." The Potters blurted out simultaneously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whatever he had expected, this certainly wasn't it. Lord Voldemort looked on in surprise at the couple and then his eyes shifted towards the babe snuggled in Lily Potter's chest. The child that was supposed to be his nemesis, his end. He looked like a fragile little thing that he could break at the snap of his fingers. His fingers twitched with the urge to take out his wand and extinguish the Potter family line once and for all. Eliminate any potential threats or competition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As if she could sense the malicious intentions swirling in the dark wizard's mind, the woman brought the child even closer to her bosom. "We would like to join your cause. If our son indeed is The Chosen One, then I think it would be far better for you to keep him closer to you then try to .. k-kill him" she chocked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lord Voldemort mused upon these words spoken by the woman. It did make sense. If this wretched little boy was destined to kill him, then it was a wise move to keep him close. Maybe the boy could be of some use to him. And how poetic it would be! The wizard meant to kill him, grovelling at his feet. Yes this solution was looking more illustrious by the second.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And so it happened that Lord Voldemort committed his first ever act of mercy and spared the Potters' lives. But it was all for his benefit. His cause.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meanwhile the Potters felt relieved. They had come relatively close to death but they were safe. For now. They had sacrificed a lot but it was worth it if they got to live another day. But now they had to figure out where to go from here. The small family was pretty sure that they had to now face a lot of hardships and adversities just to get by. But they were ready.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Come what may, but the Potters were not going down that easily.</p>
