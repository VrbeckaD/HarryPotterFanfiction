  <strong>Part One</strong>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>A delicate breeze entered the room through the wide opened window, bringing a little bit of relief to the humidity of June. She laid on her back staring at the black ceiling, the covers kicked out of the bed. It was unbearably hot. After tossing and turning for what felt like ten minutes she’d decided she won’t be getting any rest anytime soon. She sighed heavily and sat up on her bed looking around her dark bedroom, the only source of light being the bright moon shining outside the window.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were robes and clothes scattered around the bedroom’s floor. Old Daily Prophets laying in a messy pile on her bedside table, the title of the one on the very top, that came in that very day, read: HARRY POTTER “DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS”. Under the title, there was a moving photograph of a said boy. Right next to the pile of papers sat a half-empty mug of cold tea and her wand. On top of her drawer in the corner of the room stood an opened cage. Usually, a big snowy owl sat inside it but it seemed like Stolas decided to go for a little hunt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was about to get up and make herself another cup of tea, when-She hissed, catching her left arm with her right hand. The pain of hot white flames shooting through her forearm. The sensation disappeared as soon as it has come yet the meaning was not lost on her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s back,” she whispered to herself in the darkness of her bedroom. A devilish grin bloomed on her face. She could feel her heart beating rapidly in her chest, the blood pumping in her ears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh, how she’s been waiting for this moment the whole year. Unlike Fudge and the whole Ministry, she could put two and two together. The disappearance of Bertha Jorkins, the Death Eaters and the Dark Mark appearing at the World Cup, weird things happening at Hogwarts during the Triwizard Tournament… Well, weirder than usual. And if that was not enough to let her know what was happening, her Dark Mark was growing more visible and darker and darker by month. Every Death Eater with half a brain could tell what was going on. She knew he was coming, yet the question remained, when? It looked like she’s finally got her answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A lot of feelings were coursing through her head as she hurriedly jumped out of her bed and moved to her closet to find her old black hooded robes to put one; excitement and fear being the most perceptible. She couldn’t wait to join her master once again after thirteen years, yet she was frightened. She knew he would be angry at his servants for not looking for him. So many of them turned their backs on him the moment he disappeared. Claiming they were cursed, deceived, that they had no idea, that they never had anything to do with him. And she was one of those traitors. No one ever found out she was a Death Eater. No one ever suspected her of anything. And if they did, well, she was an Obliviator, after all. What was one fabricated incident needing a forgetting charm in comparison to every other crime she had ever done. Yet she was forced to live with the guilt of abandoning her Lord.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She finally found her robes and put them on, hiding her hair under the hood. She was ready to grab her wand and turn on the spot when she remembered she was still missing something. She drew a circle in the air with her wand, leaving a silver line behind it, that slowly merged into a solid silver mask with detailing around the slits for her eyes. She put it on, covering the upper half of her face. Finally, ready to be reunited with her master.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned on the spot and stepped into the void, feeling herself being squeezed through space. She felt her feet hit solid ground and when she opened her eyes she was standing between tombstones, other hooded and masked figures appearing all around her. And in the clearing between the graves, in the center of it all, there he stood. Watching them, waiting for them to come closer. He looked just as she had remembered. Unnaturally pale, tall, snake-like looking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One of the hooded figures moved forward, falling to their knees.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Master,” she heard a disbelieving voice emerging from behind the mask. She recognized the voice, yet she couldn’t connect it to a name. Even in their inner circle, not everyone knew each other’s names. It was a clever move of the Dark Lord, not wanting any traitor to betray them all. The person moved on their knees towards the Dark Lord, kissed the hem of his robe and moved aside. Everyone else followed the example. She was one of the last; she didn’t dare look up at his face, she kept her head bowed in submission. She took the hem of his robe in hand as delicately as she could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My lord,” she whispered, her voice full of pure adoration. She kissed his robe, closing her eyes. Feeling her heart beating hard and fast, while his cold red eyes were looking down at her. She moved away and took her usual place in the circle that other Death Eaters have already created. To her left stood Faustus Blackwood. He was one of the few she knew by name. She could see his blue eyes following her when she passed him. A new feeling started to burn in her; anger. She hated Blackwood with a burning passion, but she didn’t dare make any move or noise to show him just how much she despised him. To her right, there was a big gap. Big enough to fit six people in there. She knew at least three of them by name, two of them were already dead, the other one was Igor Karkaroff, apparently too cowardly to show himself. Fool.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the last Death Eater took his place, the Dark Lord looked silently around the circle. His face did not express any emotions but Lilith could tell his cold anger was rising by a second. She could feel a chill and a shiver sweep between them all. Her stomach lurched with nerves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Welcome, Death Eaters,” he said quietly and at the sound of his voice, Lilith felt the mix of happiness, terror, and guilt. The Dark Lord started to speak to his servants in that quiet dangerous voice of his. He talked about how disappointed he was with them all. How no one was trying to look for him. How they all betrayed him to save their own backs, “-And I ask myself,” he said, “have they really believed me finished?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One of the Death Eaters couldn’t bear the tension any longer and threw himself to the ground, begging for forgiveness. Speaking out of turn earned him nothing else but a Cruciatus curse. His screams carried with an echo throughout the graveyard and into the dark night. After the Dark Lord was done with him he said he is expecting thirteen years repayment for their betrayal. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wormtail had already started to repay his debt, haven’t you, Wormtail?” he asked, drawing everyone’s attention, for the first time, to a man curled up on the ground, next to a big cauldron, clutching his right hand to his chest. The Dark Lord rewarded the pathetic men with a new silver hand. Lilith watched in amazement at the display of powerful magic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But then, the Dark Lord looked around the circle again, his face unreadable and cold. She felt herself shivering once more under his gaze. She watched, alongside others, as the Dark Lord walked slowly around the circle, stopping in front of some of the Death Eaters. He was calling out their names, and every single one of them knew what that meant. He was exposing them, in front of everyone else, giving the possible future traitors the names they would call out to the Ministry. It was devastating, to say the least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He got closer and closer to where she was standing and she held her breath. She could feel the little beads of sweat running down her chest under her robes. She knew; she was certain he would say something about her. After all, after his downfall, she pretended nothing had happened. No one ever found out she was a Death Eater. She did not face a trial, she was not thrown into the Azkaban. She did not suffer for her disloyalty. He was almost right next to her, she couldn’t stand it any longer and lowered her eyes, not daring to look at his face. She held her breath, expecting to hear her own name but… Nothing. He passed her. She looked up and saw he was now looking at the gap between her and the other Death Eater. She felt relieved, but also a twinge of jealousy rose in her chest. She wanted his attention on herself, at least just for a second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he was done with counting their faults, someone asked about the miracle of his resurrection. And when the Dark Lord started to speak again, he drew attention to someone Lilith did not notice until now, even though he was in plain sight. A boy. A boy, bound to a tombstone with ropes. A boy whose face Lilith had seen that morning in the Daily Prophet. The Boy Who Lived. The boy that was the downfall of the Dark Lord. Harry Potter. He talked about the night he met his failure. About how the boy’s mother protected the kid and how that was the reason the Dark Lord disappeared for thirteen years. Lilith could not help but feel curious about the boy. She has always been. Thinking that maybe, maybe the boy might be their new leader. But now, when she looked at him, she saw no more than a frightened boy. Pathetic. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Dark Lord released him and let him fight for his life. Other Death Eaters and herself formed a circle around them, waiting for the show to start. She knew her master was about to toy with the boy like a predator would with its prey, and she couldn’t wait to watch. Excitement coursing through her veins.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But… Something was not right. When their spells connected, a weird barrier was formed around them, separating the two of them from the Death Eaters. Panic swept through them all as they watched their master trying to fight the boy. Lilith was not sure what happened next. Everything seemed like a blur. One second the golden barrier was there, the other it was gone. Some shadowy figures flew around them, the Dark Lord was shouting, the spells flew left and right, and then… It was all over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy was gone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a second of stunned silence and... The Dark Lord let out a horrible scream that Lilith could feel in her bones. She shot him a frightened look, knowing what was about to happen a split second before it did. In his rage at his defeat, he gripped his wand and started to throw curses left and right. She tried to duck behind a tombstone but it was too late. She felt herself being lifted off of the ground with the impact of the spell. A horrible, horrible crushing pain coursing through her bones. She heard a scream and only second later realized it was her own. Just when she thought she was about to blackout she felt herself being thrown in the air. She heard a swish of the air in her ears, felt the air being knocked out of her lungs. A crack against her ribs, pounding in her ears, lingering pain in her bones, something hot dripping down her brow, metallic taste in her mouth, different screams somewhere behind her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she opened her eyes with a groan, everything was blurry. She saw other hooded figures scattered around the graveyard, trying to duck out of the line of fire. She saw bodies laying on the grass or against tombstones, just like she was. And in the middle of it all stood the Dark Lord. Panting with rage, his eyes shooting red flashes. A blood-curdling scream left his mouth and Lilith trembled in fright.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was another twenty minutes before Lilith was able to pick herself up from the ground. Her face under the mask bloodied, her robes dirty, her ribs most certainly broken. She was gasping for air but she didn’t dare heal herself just yet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was another hour before the Dark Lord calmed down enough to start making a new plan. After all, Harry Potter was still alive, Dumbledore was aware by now of what happened, the spy at Hogwarts was probably compromised.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were in dire need of a new plan. And quick.</span>
