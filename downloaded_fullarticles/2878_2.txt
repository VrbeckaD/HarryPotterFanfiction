          <div class="userstuff"><p align="justify">Lily Evans was seven years old when she met Severus Snape. She and her sister Petunia used to play outside of their house in Cokesworth and often were surprised by the silent, timid boy that walked around the neighbourhood. He used to look at them intensely whenever he passed by them and one day Petunia, as the older one, decided to ask him why he was staring at them "like a weirdo". He seemed immensely horrified by her and repeatedly pointed to his ear, which Lily concluded was a sign that he couldn't hear them.</p><p align="justify">Petunia, towing a curious Lily, brought the subject to their parents. The two girls had never known someone who could not hear, so their mum and dad introduced them briefly to the BSL, the language deaf people used in Britain, and to the whole concept of deafness. It gave them something to think about, although Petunia quickly dropped the subject. </p><p align="justify">Lily didn't. Even in her young age, she couldn't help but think it must've been incredibly lonely to live without friends in the neighbourhood. After that day, she insisted on interacting with him whenever they were simultaneously outside, although he never responded to her incessant rambling.</p><p align="justify">She tried to learn sign language on her own, but she still couldn't read or write all that well, so she had to ask her parents to assist her, but none of them had much time. It would've been a lost cause if Severus himself hadn't been so insistent on teaching her.</p><p align="justify">It took months for the two of them to have real conversations. It was by then that Lily discovered Severus' parents fought a lot because of his deafness and that he'd been even lonelier than she'd first thought. She was his only friend, the only person he would talk to for long days. It wasn't long before they declared they were best mates.  </p><p align="justify">Severus became a permanent fixture in the Evans household for years, each member taking to him differently. Mrs. Evans loved him and learnt enough sign language so she could check up on him properly; Mr. Evans was incredibly interested in the language, but less so in the boy; Petunia refused to be friends with him and started to ignore Lily whenever he was around. </p><p align="justify">Things were constant until Lily turned 15. Severus started to hang around hearing boys. He started to visit Lily less and less often, each time seeming more prejudiced against the deaf community, vocalizing his speech and refusing to sign at all times. Lily pushed him to know what was happening, trying to show him that if his current friends didn't accept him as deaf, they shouldn't be his friends in the first place, which was the reason for them to get into loads of fights. Then one day Severus said a vile thing about how she was disgusting, with her attempt to alienate him from his true friends, and that was it, she sent him away for good.</p><p align="justify">For the next years of her life, Lily only signaled to her computer, watching videos to increase her vocabulary and not lose practice. Sign language only became a part of her routine again once she moved to London to go to university. She found a video relay company that was hiring interpreters and immediately sought them out. Although the last impression she had made of Snape's character hadn't been the best one, their former friendship was something that she would always be grateful for, because, if nothing else, it gave her this ability so incredibly overlooked by so many people.</p><p align="justify">Working at the company, Lily felt accomplished knowing she was exercising something that was so dear to her whilst also being able to help people (even though often it wasn't anything life-changing). Even better, it had the added bonus of helping her pay her many London bills. Although her parents tried to help, the city was not cheap and they'd never had that much money.</p><p align="justify">She had been working there for six months, Monday to Friday, and hadn't had any remarkable encounters so far.</p><p align="justify">It was during a night shift, around 11 pm on a Friday, when exceptionality found her.</p><p align="justify">In her downtime at the company, she used to write papers and revise  lectures from uni, but since the term had only begun and she had the whole weekend ahead, she chose to distract herself by starting to write down some chores that needed to be done over the weekend. Petunia was coming to spend a few days and the apartment Lily shared with her mates currently resembled the inside of a laundry bag. Her dear pristine, meticulous sister would never approve of that.</p><p align="justify">She was dividing the chores between Alice, Mary and herself when the Skype ringtone called her to attention. She looked up and clicked to accept the video conference.</p><p align="justify">After a few seconds loading, suddenly there was right before her eyes a young lad with squared glasses perched on top of his nose and a discernible air of good-humour. Lily composed herself rapidly, trying not to stare at the startling jet-black hair on his head.</p><p align="justify">HELLO. WELCOME TO SIGN VIDEO, she signed, mouthing the words. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?</p><p align="justify">HELLO. IT'S J-A-M-E-S. YOURS?</p><p align="justify">L-I-L-Y. WHAT NUMBER WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO CONNECT YOU WITH?</p><p align="justify">He gazed at her over his lenses, taking a moment to answer. He spelt the numbers slowly, as if to make sure she would get them all. Lily wrote them down.</p><p align="justify">She held a closed hand for him to wait and dialed the numbers.</p><p align="justify">IT'S RINGING.</p><p align="justify">He nodded.</p><p align="justify">The answer was practically immediate.</p><p align="justify">"Hello, this is London Horny Girls sex line, how can we help you?"</p><p align="justify">Lily blinked.</p><p align="justify">"I beg your pardon, I didn't catch that."</p><p align="justify">"This is London Horny Girls sex line, can we help you?"</p><p align="justify">"Oh, I'm sorry for the trouble," she said, "I must have dialed the wrong number."</p><p align="justify">"Which number did you call?"</p><p align="justify">She told her the numbers given to her.</p><p align="justify">"Oh, no, that's us!" the attendant said.</p><p align="justify">Lily looked at the young man before her. That twitch on the corner of his mouth could very well be amusement. But would he...?</p><p align="justify">"Can I put you on hold for one second?" she asked on the mouthpiece.</p><p align="justify">The woman on the other side of the call grunted her agreement.</p><p align="justify">I THINK I DIALED THE WRONG NUMBER, she warned James.</p><p align="justify">His eyebrows moved in a way that made Lily suspect he was making a joke.</p><p align="justify">I DON'T THINK SO, he said.</p><p align="justify">IT'S AN ADULT LINE, she signaled rigidly.</p><p align="justify">I'M AN ADULT, he pointed out in relaxed movements. </p><p align="justify">Lily shook her head, still trying to explain the issue.</p><p align="justify">IT'S AN ADULT SEX LINE.</p><p align="justify">He smiled then, the politeness giving place to smugness.</p><p align="justify">I KNOW, he signed.</p><p align="justify">Lily's eyes widened. </p><p align="justify">Oh.</p><p align="justify">He showed two thumbs up, signaling it was all good.</p><p align="justify">The redhead pressed her lips together, shocked. There was no company policy for a situation like that. There wasn't even anyone she could ask for help around, although she could see Marlene in the office kitchen laughing at something on her phone. The only other person there was another light-haired interpreter that Lily had never seen before, and he was at his own station a good five meters away.</p><p align="justify">She gazed at James again. It was her job to help him. </p><p align="justify">She exhaled slowly.</p><p align="justify">"Alright," Lily said into the headset, her voice scratchy. She cleared her throat. "I'm Lily and I'm speaking on behalf of…"</p><p align="justify">"We don't have all night to wait for you, darling," the woman cut her off. "Tell me which girl you want to talk to so I can put you through."</p><p align="justify">"Just a second," she squeaked.</p><p align="justify">WHO DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO?, Lily asked James.</p><p align="justify">He pointed to his fingers, asking what the options were.</p><p align="justify">"What are the options?"</p><p align="justify">The lady on the line sighed heavily. Lily got irritated by the rudeness - she certainly wasn't the only one who would rather be doing something else - but refrained from commenting on it, as she would've done if she wasn't currently working.</p><p align="justify">Then the attendant started to list the most horrifying options Lily had ever heard, which included, but was not limited to, a very considerable amount of synonyms for both breasts and butts, a lot of unimaginable prefixes for penetration (some Lily didn't even reckon were physically possible) and endless possibilities for sexual partners with very specific features.</p><p align="justify">Lily panicked, hoping her face didn't reveal much. There was no blooming way she was going to translate all that to James.</p><p align="justify">"Hold on, please," she said.</p><p align="justify">The lady sighed deeply again.</p><p align="justify">THEY HAVE MEN AND WOMEN, Lily signed, deciding to keep it simple and as least traumatizing as possible.</p><p align="justify">WHAT?, James appeared incredulous. THAT'S ALL?</p><p align="justify">Lily shrugged.</p><p align="justify">LONDON HORNY GIRLS HAVE MEN?, he looked completely baffled.</p><p align="justify">WEIRD, RIGHT?, she remarked.</p><p align="justify">ANYTHING MORE SPECIFIC?</p><p align="justify">Lily shook her head no. His face fell. She thought about pointing out the sex line he had chosen was rubbish, but then he would probably suggest calling another one and she wasn't going to let that happen.</p><p align="justify">WOMEN, he disappointedly signed.</p><p align="justify">"A woman," she said into the mic.</p><p align="justify">"How elaborate," the sex line lady mocked. "Would you prefer blonde, brunette, ginger, asian, black, tranny, dominatrix..."</p><p align="justify">"Any of them is fine, really," Lily said hurriedly.</p><p align="justify">The line was cut abruptly and then started to ring again.</p><p align="justify">Lily let James know it was connecting.</p><p align="justify">He untidied his hair even more while they waited. Lily found herself using the adjective "lovely" while considering his eyes. Reddening, she tried to stare at his shoulder to avoid the inevitable awkwardness.</p><p align="justify">"Hello," a practiced sensual voice said into her ear in a low tone, "this is Sabrina and I'm here to set your fantasies on fire."</p><p align="justify">Lily grimaced, thinking there wasn't a single thing she could've done to deserve that, not even when she told her brother-in-law that he was a colossal prick right to his face, or when she helped her mate Mary to secretly throw out the incense Alice stashed everywhere, or when she glared at that lady that shoved her out of the tube earlier in the day.</p><p align="justify">While she was having a meltdown, James had reached for a red-and-gold football keychain and threw it around easily, observing her quietly. </p><p align="justify">Lily decided to ignore his impressive throwing and catching skills so she could concentrate on Sabrina.</p><p align="justify">"Hello. I'm Lily from SignVideo and I'm-"</p><p align="justify">"Oooh, Lily," she moaned instantly, making Lily blush furiously. The redhead sent an alarmed look at James and his lopsided smirk made another appearance. "It's been quite a while since I last talked to another girl, but I'm just so bloody horny. What can I do for you?"</p><p align="justify">WHAT IS SHE SAYING?, he asked.</p><p align="justify">"Oh no, that's not..." Lily trailed off, lifting her hand and signaling 'wait' to James. "I'm working as a translator for a deaf man right now, and he's the one that would like to communicate with you."</p><p align="justify">"What?" Sabrina asked confusedly.</p><p align="justify">"A deaf man would like to speak to you," Lily repeated. "Not physically speak, of course, since he's deaf, but to… Well, enjoy your services all the same. I'll act as a translator for the lot of you and I'll sign everything you say to him and tell you what he's signing back."</p><p align="justify">"Oh really?"</p><p align="justify">"Really. I work for a video relay company called SignVideo."</p><p align="justify">"Do you?" Sabrina asked warily. "Let me google it."</p><p align="justify">"Sure," Lily agreed. "Be my guest."</p><p align="justify">The interpreter looked at James. He looked incredibly calm, almost teasing, and it annoyed her to no end.</p><p align="justify">He asked her what was going on.</p><p align="justify">HER NAME IS S-A-B-R-I-N-A, she signed. SHE'S ON G-O-O-G-L-E BECAUSE SHE THINKS I'M LYING ABOUT YOU.</p><p align="justify">He snorted and gave an uneven (and cute) chuckle.</p><p align="justify">"Okay, I found your company on google," Sabrina said. "So can you see him?"</p><p align="justify">"Yes. And I'll translate everything you say to him."</p><p align="justify">"Can you see me?"</p><p align="justify">"Mmm, no? We're on a regular phone call. I can't see you."</p><p align="justify">James put the keychain away and raised his eyebrows at Lily, possibly impatient.</p><p align="justify">"Okay, got it," Sabrina said. "What's his name?"</p><p align="justify">"It's James."</p><p align="justify">"How old is he?"</p><p align="justify">HOW OLD ARE YOU?</p><p align="justify">I'M 21. YOU?</p><p align="justify">ME TOO, Lily signed instinctively before remembering there was someone else in the conversation. DO YOU MEAN S-A-B-R-I-N-A?</p><p align="justify">NO.</p><p align="justify">WHAT IF SHE'S 60?, Lily joked.</p><p align="justify">I CAN'T SEE HER, he pointed out.</p><p align="justify">SO WHAT'S THE POINT IN THIS?, the redhead wondered.</p><p align="justify">James smiled cryptically.</p><p align="justify">"He's 21 years old", Lily said to put a stop to the other conversation, taking her eyes off of James.</p><p align="justify">"The delay is bloody awful," Sabrina complained.</p><p align="justify">"Sorry, but I have to translate everything to him and then get back to you, of course there will be-"</p><p align="justify">"What does he look like?" she interrupted quite rudely.</p><p align="justify">Lily appraised him. Creep or not, he was very attractive.</p><p align="justify">"Handsome."</p><p align="justify">"What do you mean by handsome?" Sabrina asked, the breathy quality her voice had taken before long gone.</p><p align="justify">"Good-looking?" Lily said hopefully. "Can't we start this already?"</p><p align="justify">"How good-looking?" </p><p align="justify">Lily sighed.</p><p align="justify">HOLD ON, she signaled to James.</p><p align="justify">"Handsome as in crazy hair, long nose, cocky smile. Charming."</p><p align="justify">Although there shouldn't be any charm left after asking shamelessly for phone sex, Lily thought. Although she wanted this lad to have the exact same opportunities as every other bloke to be disgusting and perverted, she also wanted him to just not be that kind of guy. He was <em> so </em>cute.</p><p align="justify">"I wasn't asking about his face, Lily."</p><p align="justify">"Oh! I don't- He's... fit. Seems tall."</p><p align="justify">"Is that really the best you can do?"</p><p align="justify">The best she would do.</p><p align="justify">"Yes."</p><p align="justify">"Fine, then. Ask him what's he doing up so late."</p><p align="justify">WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THIS LATE?, Lily asked James.</p><p align="justify">I WAS WORKING, he told her. YOU?</p><p align="justify">"Working," Lily told Sabrina. "You?"</p><p align="justify">"Waiting for you to call," Sabrina said as if she was reading a recipe for soup.</p><p align="justify">Lily passed the message along to James.</p><p align="justify">YOU WON'T HAVE TO WAIT ANYMORE, he said, a wide grin on his face.</p><p align="justify">"You won't have to wait anymore," Lily verbally articulated.</p><p align="justify">"I'm so glad. Lily, ask him if he wants to lick me all over with his thick tongue."</p><p align="justify">Lily got flustered.</p><p align="justify">"It would be easier if you spoke to me as if I was him," she suggested.</p><p align="justify">DO YOU WANT TO LICK ME?, Lily signed, wishing to crawl under the table and not look at James' face ever again.</p><p align="justify">He signaled the positive with a thumb, smiling so big the redhead feared his cheeks would fall off. She looked at the desk so he wouldn't see her rolling her eyes at his astonishing eloquence and his effortless composure. It wasn't fair he could be so unconcerned when she was radiating embarrassment.</p><p align="justify">"Yes," Lily answered her out loud.</p><p align="justify">"So come and shag me,” Sabrina said, her seducing tone coming back full force.</p><p align="justify">COME GET ME, Lily signed.</p><p align="justify">WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?, James asked, catching up quickly on the benefits of speaking to Sabrina directly instead of acknowledging Lily.</p><p align="justify">"What you're wearing, Sabrina?"</p><p align="justify">"Knickers and no bra."</p><p align="justify">KNICKERS, Lily translated. NO BRA.</p><p align="justify">HOW BIG ARE YOUR TITS?</p><p align="justify">"Can you tell me your bra size?" Lily inquired, hoping she could get away with being technical.</p><p align="justify">NO, James stopped her suddenly. She blinked in puzzlement. DON'T SAY THAT.</p><p align="justify">"I can tell you're editing," Sabrina said at the same time. "He would never ask my bra size."</p><p align="justify">"Hang on a minute, please."</p><p align="justify">Sabrina grunted.</p><p align="justify">WHAT?</p><p align="justify">I DIDN'T ASK HER BRA SIZE, James informed her. I ASKED HOW BIG HER TITS ARE.</p><p align="justify">Lily furrowed her lips, trying to remember whether she had signaled that specific question to him or not.</p><p align="justify">I ASKED HOW BIG HER TITS ARE.</p><p align="justify">NO!, he signed emphatically. YOU DIDN'T.</p><p align="justify">Ugh.</p><p align="justify">I'M SORRY, Lily said, once it was clear he was very sure about her lie. She touched her palms to her chest to truly convey the emotion, while still completely missing how he could've possibly caught her editing of his words.</p><p align="justify">IT'S FINE, he assured her. I'M FORGIVING YOU BECAUSE YOU SAID I'M HANDSOME.</p><p align="justify">Her breath shortened.</p><p align="justify">CAN YOU LIP-READ?, she asked.</p><p align="justify">Oh bloody fucking hell.</p><p align="justify">YES, he smirked.</p><p align="justify">"Oh that's just great," Lily whispered. "Okay, Sabrina? How big are your breasts?"</p><p align="justify">"Massive," she answered monotonously. Lily almost felt bad for having bored her so quickly. "The biggest tits you've ever seen. They're so huge your hands could very well be entering bloody Narnia when you put it between them."</p><p align="justify">Lily widened her eyes at the reference, wondering whether she was the first one to hear it. She highly doubted men wanted to hear about Narnia when they were trying to have fun.</p><p align="justify">But then again, how big was Narnia, really?</p><p align="justify">"Are you saying he has small hands?" Lily asked, turning her face away from James so he couldn't read her lips. "Because I can assure you that's not the truth."</p><p align="justify">"Of course not! I'm saying even his manly hands are nothing close to how enormous my tits are."</p><p align="justify">"Can you be more specific about those then? I don't know what to sign. Narnia is not an easy concept."</p><p align="justify">James grinned a bit then, looking strangely entertained.</p><p align="justify">"Are you or are you not a translator for deaf people?" Sabrina snapped. "Just make it the biggest tits within your arms' reach and be done with it. Ask him what he's wearing."</p><p align="justify">HUGE TITS, Lily signed to James, entirely hurt by the rudeness. WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?</p><p align="justify">BOXER SHORTS.</p><p align="justify">"Just boxers," Lily translated.</p><p align="justify">"Is he?"</p><p align="justify">"Not really. He's wearing a superhero jumper."</p><p align="justify">DON'T SAY THAT!!!, James signed frenetically.</p><p align="justify">"Tell him to take it all off."</p><p align="justify">"Hold on <em> one </em>more second, please, Sabrina."</p><p align="justify">"Yeah," she sighed.</p><p align="justify">WHAT?, Lily asked.</p><p align="justify">DON'T SAY THAT!, he said, exasperated, widening his eyes.</p><p align="justify">WHAT?</p><p align="justify">THAT I'M WEARING A JUMPER, he insisted, his forehead creased in distress.</p><p align="justify">WHY NOT?</p><p align="justify">BECAUSE IT KILLS THE MOOD!</p><p align="justify">Lily snorted, staring at him incredulously.</p><p align="justify">WHAT?, he signed.</p><p align="justify">I KILL THE MOOD, she pointed out.</p><p align="justify">He seemed to think it over. Lily waited quite-not-so-patiently while his grin grew across his face.</p><p align="justify">I DON'T THINK SO, he remarked.</p><p align="justify">She widened her eyes, panicking that he could be using her as the visual for things she had not signed up for.</p><p align="justify">IF I SEE ANY SUSPICIOUS MOVEMENT FROM YOU, I'M HANGING UP, she told him seriously.</p><p align="justify">His face completely closed off.</p><p align="justify">"H'llo? Ask him to take it all off already, I don't have all day," Sabrina said.</p><p align="justify">TAKE IT ALL OFF, Lily translated.</p><p align="justify">James looked awfully upset.</p><p align="justify">TELL HER I DID THAT ALREADY, he asked, his movements punctuated by impatience. I'M NOT A PERVERT, L-I-L-Y.</p><p align="justify">She stared. He seemed completely offended.</p><p align="justify">THEN WHAT DID YOU MEAN?, Lily had to ask.</p><p align="justify">He stared at her fixatedly, seeming to turn something over in his head.</p><p align="justify">"Am I going to hang in here forever?"</p><p align="justify">"No, I'm sorry, Sabrina," Lily said, taking her eyes off of James. "He's properly supposedly naked. Go on, please."</p><p align="justify">"Ask him if he's hard," she said.</p><p align="justify">"Do you mean-"</p><p align="justify">"Yes, dear! I'm asking if his dick is hard, who do you think you're speaking to?!"</p><p align="justify">IS YOUR DICK HARD?, she asked resentfully.</p><p align="justify">He shook his head no. Lily hated herself for feeling a tad guilty.</p><p align="justify">TELL HER I'M HARD, he asked hurriedly. LET'S MOVE THIS ALONG.</p><p align="justify">"He's hard," Lily said.</p><p align="justify">"Ask him if he wants me to suck his hot pulsing dick."</p><p align="justify">"Can't we just assume he is going to say yes?"</p><p align="justify">"Ask him."</p><p align="justify">DO YOU WANT ME TO SUCK YOUR DICK?, Lily asked, blushing to the roots of her hair.</p><p align="justify">YES, he confirmed, his self-assured body language returning. His shiny eyes went back to being thoroughly amused behind his lenses.</p><p align="justify">"Surprisingly, he said yes."</p><p align="justify">"Great. Then tell him I'm spitting on his dick so his length gets slippery before I swallow it."</p><p align="justify">Lily stopped.</p><p align="justify">She wasn't a prude, but suddenly the conversation was getting way too explicit, especially considering how she wasn't a PART of any of it.</p><p align="justify">She looked at James, who she could've even fancied a bit in any other situation, and then looked at the headset's mic. Then she made her decision.</p><p align="justify">I'M NOT COMFORTABLE DOING THIS, she informed James. I'LL DIRECT YOU TO SOMEONE ELSE.</p><p align="justify">WHAT?, he asked, his hazel eyes widening.</p><p align="justify">I CAN'T DO THIS. I'M SORRY.</p><p align="justify">He sighed, which Lily assumed was an agreement, no matter how reluctant.</p><p align="justify">YOU'LL DO BETTER WITH SOMEONE ELSE, she promised.</p><p align="justify">"Sabrina, we're having technical problems, can I put you on hold again?"</p><p align="justify">"Sure, why the fuck not? It's not like I have been here for ages or anything."</p><p align="justify">"Sorry," she said.</p><p align="justify">BYE, JAMES, she signed to him.</p><p align="justify">I'M SORRY, he signed.</p><p align="justify">Lily nodded to assure him it was no problem, before clicking to redirect the call to one of her colleagues.</p><p align="justify">Well. That had gone smoothly.</p><p align="justify">It was only then, when she could no longer see James' face on her screen, that she became aware of her surroundings again. Marlene was on her computer listening to her music (probably one of her indie bands) quite enthusiastically. There was no call on hold for her, so James had been redirected to the other employee.</p><p align="justify">Lily let her incredulity for what had happened engulf her for a bit, but then let it go. She could admit it had been interesting, although she'd never thought the erotic signs Marlene (who was very good at telling all kinds of indiscrete jokes) had taught her would be of use during work.</p><p align="justify">Next to five minutes passed. Lily doodled, but her mind kept bringing up what just happened. She couldn't help but wonder how the whole affair was working between James, Sabrina and the other interpreter. Lily chuckled imagining it.</p><p align="justify">She looked up, curious about what her colleague's reaction to James would be. She expected him to be noticeably uncomfortable, very stiff on his seat, but instead his shoulders were shaking from laughing. Lily squinted at them. What could James have possibly said to him?</p><p align="justify">She took off the headset.</p><p align="justify">"Marlene," she said.</p><p align="justify">Her mate kept dancing.</p><p align="justify">"Marlene," Lily called again, louder.</p><p align="justify">Marlene still didn't answer. Lily ripped a piece of her chore list and threw it at her.</p><p align="justify">The brunette looked around, confused, stopping when their eyes met.</p><p align="justify">WHO IS THAT?, Lily signed, so she wouldn't have to take off her headset, pointing to the bloke laughing. She could only see his profile from where she was seated.</p><p align="justify">L-U-P-I-N, she answered. HE'S NICE.</p><p align="justify">IS HE NEW?</p><p align="justify">Marlene nodded.</p><p align="justify">HE GOT HERE YESTERDAY. WE SHOULD ASK HIM TO GO OUT TO DRINK WITH US TOMORROW.</p><p align="justify">Well, nice bloke or not, what Marlene had said didn't remedy Lily's curiosity. The redhead nodded, agreeing to the suggestion before letting Marly get back to her music. She stared at Lupin's head, trying to guess what was happening over there.</p><p align="justify">The Skype ringtone woke her up from her revery. Lily accepted it mechanically, looking up.</p><p align="justify">It was James.</p><p align="justify">L-I-L-Y, he signed, looking relieved. HELP ME.</p><p align="justify">WHAT?, she asked, raising her eyes to look at Lupin. He was already gazing at her, grinning, but when their eyes met he grimaced in sympathy. Why would he send James back?</p><p align="justify">Lily moved her gaze to James.</p><p align="justify">IT NEEDS TO BE YOU, he signed, approaching the camera. His persuasiveness increased at an embarrassing pace once his face and eyes (Lily was right, they were completely lovely) got closer.</p><p align="justify">THERE'S ANOTHER GIRL HERE, IF THAT'S THE PROBLEM, she suggested.</p><p align="justify">IT WON'T WORK WITH ANYONE ELSE, he insisted. PLEASE, L-I-L-Y.</p><p align="justify">Lily sighed deeply, but if there was no other way, she'd do it.</p><p align="justify">WAIT, she signaled.</p><p align="justify">"Sabrina?"</p><p align="justify">"Oh, Lily, thank God!" she cried. "I need to go to the loo."</p><p align="justify">"Oh," Lily made a face to James, who still looked apologetic. "Why didn't you?"</p><p align="justify">"Because I didn't know if the other bloke on the phone was a perv and would ask to hear it," she whispered, like 'the other bloke' was going to listen to that as well. "Which is fine when it's my customer, but if he wants to hear my piss, he will need to phone me himself, not exploit dear James' time."</p><p align="justify">"That's completely reasonable," Lily said, shivering at the mere notion. "Go to the loo, then. We'll be waiting."</p><p align="justify">"No, you keep going," she said. "I'm sucking him off right now, okay? Talk to him."</p><p align="justify">"No, no, no, no," Lily said, turning her face away so James wouldn't see her lips. A door slammed on the other side of the line.</p><p align="justify">WHAT?, James asked.</p><p align="justify">Lily grinned brightly, pretending that Sabrina was still on the line. She pressed the headset to her ears.</p><p align="justify">YOUR DICK IS GOOD, she informed him slowly.</p><p align="justify">I KNOW, James promptly replied.</p><p align="justify">"He's aware," Lily said out loud so he would think Sabrina was still there.</p><p align="justify">SHE SAYS SHE CHANGED HER MIND. IT'S NOT ALL THAT GOOD.</p><p align="justify">He narrowed his eyes.</p><p align="justify">SHE DID NOT, he replied.</p><p align="justify">SHE DID.</p><p align="justify">YOU'RE LYING, he accused.</p><p align="justify">"Sabrina, didn't you say James' dick wasn't all that good?" Lily said, talking into the mic. She raised her eyebrows at a non-existent reply.</p><p align="justify">SHE'S NOT THERE, he pointed out.</p><p align="justify">SHE IS! I'M LISTENING TO HER.</p><p align="justify">BULLSHIT, James signaled forcefully. SHE WENT TO THE LOO.</p><p align="justify">He got closer to the camera, pointing to his eyes and then to his smiling mouth, reinforcing his lip-reading skills. Even though Lily was feeling embarrassed for being caught red handed again, she had to grin at the whole picture. Handsome indeed.</p><p align="justify">CAN YOU UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING I SAY?, she wondered.</p><p align="justify">He shook his head no.</p><p align="justify">Then he proceeded to explain that he could understand some words from every sentence. Usually the ones in which her mouth had to take a very clear shape. Like handsome. Or loo. Or James.</p><p align="justify">EVERYTHING IMPORTANT, he signaled amusedly.</p><p align="justify">Lily rolled her eyes.</p><p align="justify">DON'T DO THAT, PRETTY EYES.</p><p align="justify">WHAT?, she asked. He rolled his eyes in a rather exaggerated manner, mimicking her. NOT THAT. WHAT WAS THE BIT ABOUT THE EYES?</p><p align="justify">He lifted his eyebrows, messing up his hair again.</p><p align="justify">IT'S A SIGN NAME FOR YOU, he said. He repeated the sign.</p><p align="justify">Lily stared, rendered speechless. Not many callers asked for her sign name, since they usually had such brief encounters, and James was definitely the only one who had come up with anything new. Snape used to call her by the literal lily sign and she was very fond of it, but the new one was just as lovely.</p><p align="justify">THANK YOU, she said, wholeheartedly, knowing how important sign names were for the deaf community. WHAT'S YOURS?</p><p align="justify">He evaluated her before doing his particular signature, which was, surprisingly, and if Lily wasn't horribly mistaken, a deer.</p><p align="justify">Lily repeated the sign and he grinned.</p><p align="justify">IS IT A D-E-E-R?, she had to ask.</p><p align="justify">S-T-A-G, he spelled.</p><p align="justify">WHY?</p><p align="justify">LOOONG STORY.</p><p align="justify">"I'm back!" Sabrina announced. "Thank you so much for the help, Lily. So where are we?"</p><p align="justify">Lily opened and closed her mouth a few times, trying to remember what they were talking about before she had left me.</p><p align="justify">"Hmm, not much has changed," Lily said after a few seconds of complete blankness.</p><p align="justify">"He's quite slow, isn't he?" Sabrina asked conversationally.</p><p align="justify">"I reckon it's very dignified that he's taking his time."</p><p align="justify">"Then he should be glad he's not on my line of work," she replied jokingly. "Most of the time, it's not dignified at all to take your time."</p><p align="justify">"I'll take your word for it, Sabrina," Lily chuckled. </p><p align="justify">WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?, James asked.</p><p align="justify">SHE IS SAYING YOU ARE SLOW, Lily replied mockingly.</p><p align="justify">He scowled.</p><p align="justify">I'M NOT SLOW! I'M GOING TO FUCK HER REALLY HARD.</p><p align="justify">Lily pressed her lips together to keep herself from snickering because of his wounded expression.</p><p align="justify">"He's going to fuck you hard now, Sabrina,"</p><p align="justify">"Is he? Tell him I've been wet in anticipation for a long time."</p><p align="justify">SHE'S WET, Lily resumed. WAITING FOR YOU.</p><p align="justify">James stared and then chuckled.</p><p align="justify">THIS ISN'T WORKING AT ALL, he signed.</p><p align="justify">Sabrina started to moan in her ear.</p><p align="justify">YOU'RE FUCKING HER HARD NOW, Lily told him. SHE'S MOANING. JUST SO YOU KNOW.</p><p align="justify">He gave her a crooked smirk.</p><p align="justify">I'M GOOD AT FUCKING, he informed her, eyes shining behind his glasses.</p><p align="justify">Lily stared back at him.</p><p align="justify">I DON'T THINK SO.</p><p align="justify">WHAT? WHY?, he asked, obviously surprised.</p><p align="justify">YOU HAVE TO START SLOW, she signaled. AND THEN BUILD UP TO HARD.</p><p align="justify">He stopped moving around in his chair. The corners of his mouth turned up.</p><p align="justify">GOOD TO KNOW, he signed.</p><p align="justify">"He's into it, right, Lily?" Sabrina said, stopping her meowing a tad to speak.</p><p align="justify">"Oh, definitely."</p><p align="justify">"Isn't he saying anything?" Sabrina asked, out of breath from moaning so loudly for so long. "Tell him his dick is the biggest I've ever had."</p><p align="justify">Lily passed the message along quickly.</p><p align="justify">I KNOW, James raised his eyebrows once. Oh, the insolence.</p><p align="justify">"He's too turned on to be communicative, I think," Lily lied.</p><p align="justify">"Well, ask him if he wants to shag me from behind as well," she suggested, yawning. "Let's spice things up."</p><p align="justify">Lily wrinkled her nose. "Are you sure?"</p><p align="justify">"It usually gets them to finish their business fast," she answered. "I'm knackered, I had a very very long day, so if we can speed this along..."</p><p align="justify">"Alright", Lily agreed before noticing what had ticked her about the sentence. "What did you mean by shag you 'as well'?"</p><p align="justify">"At the same time."</p><p align="justify">"But how would he do that?" Lily asked, already terrified of the answer to come. "He only has one penis."</p><p align="justify">Sabrina howled.</p><p align="justify">Lily winced at the sharp sound, fearful of the explanation to come. It took awhile for Sabrina to speak again.</p><p align="justify">"There are so many ways, darling. Ask 'im, he will know what I'm talking about."</p><p align="justify">JAMES, Lily said, using his funny sign name. SHE WANTS YOU TO FUCK HER ARSE AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU FUCK HER VAGINA.</p><p align="justify">James frowned, looking rather intrigued. He seemed to think hard about it.</p><p align="justify">I HAVE ONE PENIS, he signed confusedly.</p><p align="justify">Lily stilled. She looked at him expecting some cheeky remark or an explanation for him to do exactly what Sabrina was asking, but none came. He kept looking at her utterly puzzled, like she should be able to make sense of the mess of bums and breasts and vaginas and penises and Sabrinas and a phone sex call with no masturbation or two-sided hearing.</p><p align="justify">Then it occurred to Lily that James' non-existent second penis existed in the exact same conversation as Sabrina's bigger-than-bloody-Narnia boobs.</p><p align="justify">She cracked up.</p><p align="justify">Both James and Sabrina kept asking her what was wrong, Sabrina way more forcefully than James, but Lily couldn't breathe, let alone communicate in any language.</p><p align="justify">It was a few minutes before she calmed down and managed to muffle her laugh with her hand. James had stopped trying to get her attention and was just gazing at her, probably wondering why he had had the terrible idea of spending his money by phoning the company and how it was possible for someone's face to be that blotchy and flustered. Sabrina was cursing defiantly, as if she had concluded it was in reality a prank call.</p><p align="justify">"It's a joke, isn't it?" she squealed. "It's a fucking joke!"</p><p align="justify">"No, no, no," Lily replied, between not-at-all dignified giggles. "I'm so sorry. It's not a prank."</p><p align="justify">"Then why are you laughing, Lily? Was it something I said? James has a problem with arses?"</p><p align="justify">Another fit of laughter hit her.</p><p align="justify">HANG UP, James signed, grinning.</p><p align="justify">WHAT?</p><p align="justify">HANG UP, he asked again.</p><p align="justify">Lily blinked. His request sobered her up.</p><p align="justify">REALLY?, she had to make sure.</p><p align="justify">James promptly raised a hand to sign yes, still grinning.</p><p align="justify">"Sabrina, I'm so sorry," Lily said warmly. "For everything. It's just... I have never done this before and it's completely mental."</p><p align="justify">"Oh," she said. "Yeah, I guess you would think so. It's just been so long since I found all of that funny that I thought..."</p><p align="justify">"I can imagine. Thank you for the laugh, anyway. And for the patience."</p><p align="justify">"Oh, no, thanks to both of you," she replied immediately. "I'm sorry for being so rude, I thought you were pranking me. It's refreshing not to have a sixty year old breathing on my ear for a change."</p><p align="justify">"I'm glad we could give you a break. James is asking me to hang up, alright?"</p><p align="justify">"What? Did he come?"</p><p align="justify">"No. I reckon I did an awful job of translating everything."</p><p align="justify">"Poor bloke," she sighed. "Well, I'll let you go then."</p><p align="justify">"Alright. Goodbye, Sabrina."</p><p align="justify">"Wait!" she screamed suddenly. "Do you make good money there?"</p><p align="justify">The question surprised Lily.</p><p align="justify">"It's alright," she confirmed.</p><p align="justify">"This will sound so weird," Sabrina said. "But could you help me become an interpreter for deaf people as well? I can't stand my job anymore. I don't think there is a perv in the whole UK I don't know on a first name basis."</p><p align="justify">"Oh. Sure! Do you know sign language?"</p><p align="justify">"I know some things," she confirmed. "Like sunrise."</p><p align="justify">Lily hummed, thinking about it. She sounded all right.</p><p align="justify">"Sabrina, give me your number and I'll call you, yeah? I can teach you. Even if you can't work here, since we just hired someone new, there may be other opportunities for you."</p><p align="justify">"Cheers, Lily!" she cried. "Thank you so much, you have no idea how much you're helping me. Just call me Dorcas, Sabrina is a made up name."</p><p align="justify">Lily laughed and wrote down her number, right next to the eighth point of her list (which was "grab all the knickers from the bathroom") and hung up, assuring her she would phone later.</p><p align="justify">WHAT WAS THAT?, James asked.</p><p align="justify">SHE WANTS ANOTHER JOB, Lily said. I'LL HELP.</p><p align="justify">His eyebrows rose in his forehead. THAT'S INSANE.</p><p align="justify">I KNOW! THE WHOLE NIGHT WAS MIND BLOWING.</p><p align="justify">YEAH, he agreed.</p><p align="justify">They stared at each other.</p><p align="justify">THANK YOU, he said heartily.</p><p align="justify">NO, Lily erased his thank you with a hand. THANK YOU. THAT WAS THE CRAZIEST CALL I'VE EVER HAD.</p><p align="justify">The corner of his eyes crinkled from grinning.</p><p align="justify">DO YOU NEED HELP WITH SOMETHING ELSE?, Lily said, after a few more seconds of staring and already regretting the fact that she’d have to end the conversation if he answered no.</p><p align="justify">DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER CALL?, he asked.</p><p align="justify">Lily shook her head no.</p><p align="justify">THEN DON'T GO, he suggested, leaning closer to the camera.</p><p align="justify">She looked around. Marlene was still rocking to a song at her own desk and that Lupin bloke was signaling to his computer. They were the last three people there at that time of the night.</p><p align="justify">Lily turned back to James. </p><p align="justify">ALRIGHT, she answered. He beamed.</p><p align="justify">IT WAS A JOKE, he signed immediately. I WANTED TO PRANK R-E-M-U-S.</p><p align="justify">WHO?</p><p align="justify">R-E-M-U-S, he repeated himself. He kept looking at her in expectation. HE WORKS THERE.</p><p align="justify">Her eyes moved over to her unknown colleague.</p><p align="justify">L-U-P-I-N?</p><p align="justify">He signed yes.</p><p align="justify">HE'S MY MATE, he answered. I KNEW HE WOULD BE WORKING, SO I CALLED HIM.</p><p align="justify">WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK FOR HIM?</p><p align="justify">YOU ANSWERED, he signed.</p><p align="justify">Lily raised an eyebrow, expecting some kind of clarification.</p><p align="justify">YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL, he signed with a casual shrug. R-E-M-U-S IS NOT.</p><p align="justify">Lily felt a flush rise on her cheeks and neck.</p><p align="justify">I THINK L-U-P-I-N IS HANDSOME, she said, mostly to get a rise out of him.</p><p align="justify">YOU THINK I'M FIT, he remarked, not bothered in the least. AND I KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE.</p><p align="justify">Lily narrowed her eyes. WHAT?</p><p align="justify">TO START SLOW, he signed. THEN BUILD UP TO HARD.</p><p align="justify">She looked somewhere else to hide her embarrassment. </p><p align="justify">WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THIS LATE?, Lily asked once she got her face under control. BESIDES FLIRTING.</p><p align="justify">He grinned toothily. AM I FLIRTING?</p><p align="justify">Lily sent him a sharp look. His uneven laugh made another appearance and she felt her eyes softening.</p><p align="justify">I COULDN'T SLEEP, he answered.</p><p align="justify">WHY?</p><p align="justify">THE NEIGHBORS ARE HAVING A PARTY, he grimaced. THE FLOOR IS VIBRATING TOO MUCH.</p><p align="justify">I'M SORRY.</p><p align="justify">NOT YOUR PARTY.</p><p align="justify">She felt sorry anyway.</p><p align="justify">I GOT BORED AND DECIDED TO PESTER R-E-M-U-S, he added. I WAS WRITING AN ESSAY FOR U-N-I, SINCE I COULDN'T SLEEP.</p><p align="justify">WHAT ABOUT?</p><p align="justify">ART, he answered.</p><p align="justify">REALLY?, Lily inquired.</p><p align="justify">He nodded, smiling, and signaled for her to wait. He looked around his own room, leaving the camera frame. He came back a few seconds later with an impressive drawing of an outstanding castle that could've been easily in a medieval setting, or perhaps in a fairytale. The whole drawing was enormous and still apparently incomplete.</p><p align="justify">YOU DREW THAT?, Lily asked in amazement.</p><p align="justify">YES, he confirmed, half of his face covered by the frame.</p><p align="justify">YOU? YOU DID NOT.</p><p align="justify">I DID, he said, leaving the drawing on the desk so he could sign freely.</p><p align="justify">YOU DID NOT, she provoked.</p><p align="justify">He furrowed his eyebrows at her.</p><p align="justify">I'LL PROVE IT, he said, before reaching out for something.</p><p align="justify">He showed her a pencil and a notebook that he put down on his desk, before looking up again.</p><p align="justify">WHAT?, she signed.</p><p align="justify">STAY STILL.</p><p align="justify">Lily followed his instruction to the best of her capacity, but it was difficult not to fidget while he stared at her like that. She wondered how much she was inadvertently baring of herself to him and what he could be seeking that would be worthy of his art. </p><p align="justify">Although she failed to do as he asked, James didn't complain. He kept drawing and Lily kept looking, not even attempting to avoid the strong pull of his eyes or the way he hadn't stopped smiling since she had hung up the phone.</p><p align="justify">He wasn't a classic beauty, not at all, not with his too long nose and his thin wrists and the craziest, unruliest hair she had ever seen. But still he was so handsome. Somehow the encounter of all his unbalanced proportions, the soft smile and the angular jaw, the slender fingers and the broad shoulders, created a fetching picture.</p><p align="justify">It wasn't just the looks. James was amusing and easy-going and cheeky, inappropriate and mindless of his own limitations, but most of all he was terribly captivating. Lily knew Sign Language translated much more in terms of people's essence than speech ever could. It attuned to the body, not to the words. To the crude, truthful reactions, not to the edited sayings.</p><p align="justify">Many of James' physical reactions offered bits of his personality that Lily wouldn't know about a hearing person through a first encounter.</p><p align="justify">His occasional grin took over his whole face, but his trademark crooked smirk only reached one side of his lips. He hadn't been fazed at all by an explicit conversation about sex with a virtual stranger, but it had troubled him deeply when said stranger doubted his good intentions. Lily could see how his deafness didn't trouble him because there was no wariness in his eyes. Whilst a lot of deaf people did not trust hearing people easily, James had been at ease during the entirety of their interaction. Perhaps he had never been taught to see his deafness as a disability whatsoever. </p><p align="justify">It took some time for him to finish his drawing. Once he did, he raised the notebook to the camera. In his drawing, Lily's eyes were huge and bright and her ponytail cascaded along one of her shoulders. There were freckles scattered around her face and she was beaming. She had her headset on.</p><p align="justify">Lily gazed at it. It was an incomplete sketch, but it held so much promise of talent and of personal style.</p><p align="justify">He held it up for a few seconds, touching his nose to the top of the notebook, before he winked. He added something to the drawing and then showed the new addition to her, his mouth turned up in cheekiness.</p><p align="justify">It was a speech balloon. He filled it with the words "Is your dick hard?".</p><p align="justify">Lily laughed. YOU'RE VERY TALENTED. I LOVE IT!</p><p align="justify">He stared, his movements slow and his lips pressed together, none of his self-assurance and cheekiness showing on his face.</p><p align="justify">LILY, he said, using the sign name he had come up with, all seriousness. WRITE DOWN ANOTHER NUMBER, ALRIGHT?</p><p align="justify">She nodded.</p><p align="justify">She did.</p><p align="justify"> </p></div>
