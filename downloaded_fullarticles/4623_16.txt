    <p>She’d known he was coming, of course.</p>
<p>Even if McGonagall hadn’t been a very different sort of headmaster than Dumbledore had been, the sort that was significantly more inclined to soliciting feedback on hiring decisions, Hermione would still have known he was the only possible choice for the position. There were only a handful of wizards at the same level when it came to potions. Two of them lived on the continent, one worked in high level research at King’s College, and the only other real option had two small children. No matter how much she loved Hogwarts, Hermione had to admit it probably wasn’t the best place to raise a family, especially if your husband worked for the Ministry in London and you wanted to see him more than at holidays and over the summer.</p>
<p>And far beyond practical considerations, she knew his work. She’d been reading his articles for years, and the books – all three of them had shelf space in her office, which was more than she could say for any other author. He had a way of setting things out that reminded her of the very best kind of spell casting: straight-forward but quietly complex. He asked questions that had actually made her think. She’d even written him about a chapter in the second one; his owl back had mostly been a list of references, but there had been a diagram that had changed the way Hermione thought about an entire class of potions.</p>
<p>So when McGonagall had asked for suggestions, Hermione really hadn’t hesitated before saying, “Malfoy.”</p>
<p>It didn’t mean she liked him, or forgave him, or particularly wanted to live in the same castle. But Slughorn’s second retirement had been more of a necessity than a suggestion. Hermione wanted someone exceptional in the position more than she wanted someone she liked.</p>
<p>Still, she’d only seen him a handful of times since the war, mostly the occasional run in somewhere in Diagon Alley when she’d been in training and he’d still been at the Ministry. But then he’d gone to South America, presumably to do research for the book on newly described medicinal plants, and she’d come to Scotland. It had been years. She’d changed. Hermione supposed it was possible, probably even likely, that Malfoy had changed as well. But she never counted on that sort of thing.</p>
<p>The last week of August, Hermione had expected to have the castle mostly to herself. Neville and Hannah were on their honeymoon, McGonagall had gone to visit her sister, and nearly everyone else was somewhere else, enjoying one last brief bit of freedom before the children arrived and the castle descended into complete and utter chaos.</p>
<p>She was lying in the window seat reading, feet propped out the enormous circular window. Crookshanks was out hunting mice in the garden, which still smelled faintly of her carefully cultivated night blooming jasmine and the summer heat.</p>
<p>She saw movement out the corner of her eye, when the lamia who guarded her portrait stepped into another frame.</p>
<p>“Someone’s at the door,” she said; it was night, so her skin was faintly layered with scales and snake-skin rosettes, her eyes huge and glowing in the near-darkness away from the faerie lights and lanterns Hermione had set up around the window.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” the lamia said. “I don’t recognize him.”</p>
<p>“That’s helpful,” Hermione said. She got up to get the door, lights trailing behind her.</p>
<p>When she opened the door, she very nearly didn’t recognize him either. Malfoy had gotten tall since the last time she’d seem him, age evening out the sharper features she remembered from when they were in school.</p>
<p>“Hello, Granger,” he said.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” she said.</p>
<p>“Teaching potions?” Malfoy said, dryly. “Don’t tell me they haven’t mentioned it, or this is about to be dreadfully awkward.”</p>
<p>“I meant my rooms,” Hermione said. She’d nearly laughed, which she found faintly horrifying; just because he’d gone and grown six inches and, apparently, developed a sense of humor didn’t make him an entirely different person.</p>
<p>“Do you mind if I come in?” Malfoy said. He was holding something.</p>
<p>“All right,” Hermione said, finally stepping back. Crookshanks had stuck his head in through the window. He looked nearly as dubious as she felt.</p>
<p>Malfoy stayed close to the doorway, but he held out the thing he’d been carrying, which Hermione realized was a book.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to be published until next spring,” he said. “But I thought you might want an advance copy.”</p>
<p>“Malfoy,” Hermione said, slowly. “I haven’t seen you in ten or eleven years, and you just came to my rooms at half past eleven to give me <i>your</i> book. Are you joking?”</p>
<p>“Actually, I came to say hello,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“Well, in that case,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“Oh, all right,” Malfoy said. He ran a hand through his hair, a very unfamiliar gesture. “All the other professors owled. You didn’t, so I thought I’d better come make sure you didn’t hex me unconscious at breakfast.”</p>
<p>“I was busy,” Hermione said. It was vaguely true. And besides the point. “And you’re about to be a colleague, I was planning on being an adult about our…  history.”</p>
<p>“The history where I tried to get you and Weasley and Potter killed repeatedly, <i>did</i> get Snape killed, and parroted rather a lot of pureblood rhetoric in your general direction?” Malfoy said. “Shame, I was expecting another round with your right hook.”</p>
<p>“So, what, you’re here to apologize?” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“Not to put too fine a point on it, but yes,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“Oh,” Hermione said. There really wasn’t anything else to say. </p>
<p>There was a long and exceedingly awkward pause.</p>
<p>“I realize it probably seems out of character,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“A little,” Hermione said. “Okay, astonishingly. You can’t stand me.”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t,” Malfoy corrected. “Well, all right, I suppose it’s entirely possible that we still might hate one another, but I’d rather it be over a personality conflict than –“ He looked down at her, and she realized that even if his tone was light, there was something in his eyes that suggested that this wasn’t a particularly easy conversation.</p>
<p>“I turned out to be on the wrong side of a war,” he said, finally.</p>
<p>“We were seventeen,” Hermione said. “Honestly –“ It hadn’t occurred to her, really, but she suddenly realized she’d built Malfoy up in her head. Everything she felt about him was left over from when she’d been seventeen, bold and perfectly sure of her footing and so, so naïve. Standing in the dim lamp light, he looked nothing like she’d remembered. She was fairly certain it wasn’t because he’d changed that much. It was mostly that she’d forgotten.</p>
<p>“We were children,” she finished. “You were only doing what you were told.” She ran her fingers over the binding on the book. “So was I, really. It was a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“I’m not in the habit of apologizing every five minutes for something that happened over a decade ago,” Draco said. It sounded a little like a warning. “But you did deserve better than how awful I was to you, so I thought I ought to tell you I was sorry.”</p>
<p>“Oh, probably,” Hermione said, too lightly. “I might have laughed myself sick when I found out you were publishing a book.”</p>
<p>“Imagine my surprise to find out you’d read one of them,” Malfoy said, who’d gone back to looking vaguely amused with the entire situation.</p>
<p>“All of them, even,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“Well, now there’s that one, if you’d like,” Malfoy said. “Although it’s not entirely altruistic.” He leaned against one of her bookshelves. “I was hoping to keep doing research here, but I need a mediwizard for consulting. Or a mediwitch, as the case may be. I realize it’s presuming a lot, but there aren’t a lot of options in the middle of Scotland.” He smiled, although it looked slightly rueful. “I thought your ongoing obsession with academic topics and a desire to be a second author might win out over, well, your dislike for me.”</p>
<p>There was another long pause.</p>
<p>“I’ll help,” she said, finally, surprised to realize she actually wanted to. “But I’m not sure you’ll have time.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been in research for years,” Malfoy said. “I actually do know how to balance a full schedule.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that,” Hermione said. “You’re going to be playing catch up. I think Potions edged out History of Magic for the least popular class.”</p>
<p>“McGonagall said Slughorn was ready to retire,” Malfoy said, slowly. “I’d assumed that explained why he wasn’t interested in staying long enough to help me get started.”</p>
<p>Hermione sighed; she didn’t particularly want to catch Malfoy up on the current state of affairs, but McGonagall obviously hadn’t said anything.</p>
<p>“He actually wanted to leave a few years ago, but she couldn’t find a replacement. So he’s been doing an utterly rubbish job, probably because he was tired but at least partially to make a point.”</p>
<p>“Funny how no one mentions these things when they ask you to come back from Africa and take a job,” Malfoy mused.</p>
<p>“I had to start my own stores for all the medical potions, his ingredients have either been non-existent or so bad they weren’t even worth using,” she admitted.</p>
<p>“Hold on, you’re brewing your own potions for the infirmary?” Malfoy said. He actually looked startled. “How on earth do you have the room?”</p>
<p>“I really don’t,” Hermione said. “I’ve been having to buy most of it, but I don’t trust market contraceptives, and I don’t like the idea of giving pain relief potions I didn’t brew myself.”</p>
<p>Hermione was always faintly surprised at the depth of feeling she’d developed regarding her job. It hadn’t been a shock when she’d realized she wanted to study medicine, to focus on life instead of death, but she’d always meant to go into research or to work at a hospital or – well, nearly anything other than chasing around insufferable teenagers who had a propensity for getting themselves into utterly ridiculous predicaments.</p>
<p>McGonagall had offered her the job at Hogwarts. At the time, practicing medicine on school children hadn’t seemed glamorous, but being several hours by train away from her failing relationship and the endless media articles about it had been more appealing than getting ahead somewhere.</p>
<p>Over the years, Hermione had realized that there was a certain sort of ambition in being excellent. And she was, well, excellent. Even the Slytherins liked her. She had an office with a perpetually open door, a carefully cultivated garden, and, after seven years, a castle full of students who had never had anyone else running the infirmary or checking in when they didn’t show up for class.</p>
<p>“Just give me a list of what you need,” Malfoy said. He sounded – unexpectedly angry.</p>
<p>It occurred to her that Malfoy was probably more than capable of all the things Slughorn hadn’t been willing to do, even when he’d still been interested in his bloody job. She thought, suddenly, that no one with a promising research career and field stations on two continents would come here if they weren’t interested in teaching. And that assumed a certain interest in the well-being of students.</p>
<p>“It’s different these days,” she said, finally. “I didn’t think it was entirely right that we had a hospital wing that worked like, well, a hospital.” She glanced up at him. “It’s a lot easier to get them to come to you when something’s really wrong if they’re used to coming to you for little things.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think either of us has ever settled for doing much halfway,” Malfoy said. “I wasn’t expecting it to be the same with you running that particular show.” He paused. “Well, I wasn’t expecting that anyway, these children are probably different than we were.”</p>
<p>“Not really,” Hermione said, laughing. “They’re still teenagers.”</p>
<p>“I can’t possibly tell you how overjoyed I am to have inherited this Head of House position,” Malfoy said. “Maybe I can just send them all to you.”</p>
<p>“Only if you’re prepared for me to send them right back,” she said, finally. It was strange to be joking around with Malfoy. “But I might be willing to put in a good word with Neville and to help you organize the storerooms if I can stop brewing potions in my office.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right, he owled,” Malfoy said. He looked amused again. “I told you everyone else had. He wanted to know if I’d outgrown being a sanctimonious prick, and he also suggested that he’d be perfectly willing to let things go if I happened to have some roaming jequirity seeds that I was willing to pass over.”</p>
<p>“Well?” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“They’re sitting on his desk,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“I just want you to know,” Hermione said, “that I reserve the right to feel some degree of schadenfreude about the fact that you’re stuck in a castle with me and Neville.” She grinned. “And Bill Weasley occasionally shows up to teach Charms.”</p>
<p>“He’s all right,” Malfoy said. “We did some work together in Egypt. Curse breaking potions are more interesting than you’d think.”</p>
<p>“I think they’re probably exactly as interesting as I’d think, which is very,” Hermione said. “But I’m impressed you managed to talk him into being in the same country.”</p>
<p>“You know,” Malfoy said, “it’s surprisingly easy to get people over the whole thing once you figure out what they want.”</p>
<p>“And?” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“He couldn’t get into an entire series of tombs without me,” Malfoy said, amused. “And I took a very solid punch to the jaw. I wouldn’t recommend that one, but it seemed to do the trick.”</p>
<p>“Don’t try to tell me you’re friends with Harry too,” Hermione said. “I think he’d have mentioned it.”</p>
<p>“God, no,” Malfoy said. He actually laughed. “He doesn’t have anything <i>I</i> want.”</p>
<p>“And I do?” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“In case you haven’t noticed, we’re the only people in the castle under the age of fifty with the exception of Longbottom, and he just got married,” Malfoy said. “I think he might be too distracted to occupy my attention.”</p>
<p>“We’re the only staff under the age of fifty,” she corrected.</p>
<p>“Seventeen and under seems like a suspect category for –“ He paused, looking as if he was considering something. “Research alliances.”</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a housekeeping and mail order alliance first,” Hermione warned. “You don’t understand the state the potions dungeon is in.”</p>
<p>“I’m very much looking forward to tomorrow morning and the delight of discovering that horror show,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“If you’ll let me move cauldrons out of my bath, I’ll help,” Hermione said. “I’m between batches.”</p>
<p>“You’re brewing potions in your –“ Malfoy paused. He looked as if he might be trying not to say something.</p>
<p>“I know, I haven’t been able to use it for its intended purpose in a year because the temperature and humidity would ruin everything,” Hermione said. “And I’d like to. Are you taking me up on it or not?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Malfoy said. “But I meant it about the list.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to be short on time,” Hermione said. “I’ve been managing, honestly.”</p>
<p>“Managing isn’t the same as doing well,” Malfoy said. “And if I have to argue everyone into letting me do my job, I’m not going to have any time to actually do it.”</p>
<p>“I’ll bring it tomorrow,” Hermione said. She paused. “Just like that, then? We’re going to…”</p>
<p>“It’s been ten years,” Malfoy said. “Do you really want to keep the whole thing going, or would you rather start over?”</p>
<p>“Start over,” Hermione said. She was startled to find that she meant it.</p>
<p>“Goodnight then, Granger,” he said, ducking back out the portrait as she held it open.</p>
<p>By lunch the next day, Hermione was seriously beginning to regret her decision to tolerate Malfoy.</p>
<p>“Hens’ teeth –“ she said, opening a drawer in one of the storage cabinets. It was empty, which seemed fortunate, since the stabilizing charm obviously hadn’t been renewed in a timely fashion. “Empty. Should I add them to the list?”</p>
<p>The chalkboard in the dungeon was nearly filled with a list of ingredients and supplies to order; the chalk leapt up to the board again when she glanced at it, as if it felt vaguely guilty for lying around on Malfoy’s desk.</p>
<p>“Damn, I saw some of those,” Malfoy said. “I think they’re in the drawer that’s supposed to be lupine seeds.”</p>
<p>Hermione had taken the upper half of the drawers and the ceiling shelves, which was starting to seem like an idiotic decision given the fact that Malfoy probably wouldn’t have needed the bloody ladder. He was sitting on the floor looking irritably at a row of vials of blue liquid. He held one up to her floating light charm and shook his head.</p>
<p>“No idea,” he said. “It could be oil of peacock, it could be a pH buffer. I’d know if I tasted it, but even I’m not that stupid.”</p>
<p>“For all we know, it’s water with indigo dye,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“I miss Africa,” Malfoy said. “It rained half the time and camp flooded and all my labels ran and ants ate my samples, but at least the chaos wasn’t due to sheer negligence.”</p>
<p>“Well, I found these,” Hermione said. She cast a cleaning charm on the drawer, added the hens’ teeth, and renewed the stasis spell.</p>
<p>“This is ridiculous,” Malfoy said. “I’m fairly certain there’s no strangling kelp, what was he even teaching the fifth years? You need that for all the soporifics.”</p>
<p>“He wasn’t,” Hermione said. “I’ve got plenty of it upstairs, though.”</p>
<p>“I think I’m going to have to have things shipped on the train,” Malfoy said. “I can’t possibly subject owls to this.”</p>
<p>He dismissed the vials with a flick of his wand. Hermione had to resist the urge to laugh; he had a streak of what looked like charcoal across one cheek and some sort of purple slime in his hair from a stabilizing charm failure that had led to a rather spectacular explosion out of a jar. The rest of his hair looked nearly as bad as Harry’s usually did, and his robes were covered in dust. She assumed she probably didn’t look much better, but she’d never been as fastidious as Malfoy.</p>
<p>“The hell with it,” he said. “I’ll buy you lunch in Hogsmeade. I can’t get through any more of this without alcohol.”</p>
<p>“It’s not even noon,” Hermione said, amused.</p>
<p>“Scotch,” Malfoy said, darkly. “A lot of it.”</p>
<p>“I think –“ Hermione said. She pulled open a drawer, which promptly spat a puff of grey powder at her. She suspected it had been powdered deadly dappering spore. Malfoy had made her take a neutralizing potion before they’d started, so there really wasn’t much danger. Still: having toxic mushroom remnants all over her face was a bit much.</p>
<p>“I think you’re buying me something with firewhiskey,” Hermione finished.</p>
<p>“Happily,” Malfoy said, standing up. He started to dust himself off, then paused when his robes sparked. “But maybe a shower first.”</p>
<p>“Definitely a shower first,” Hermione said, trying to wipe off the worst of the powder. “Can I use one down here? I’ve been sharing with the Head Girl because of the whole bath situation, I’d rather not poison the new one when she gets here.”</p>
<p>“You know,” Malfoy said. “I’m going to send a Howler. I might even send more than one. Perhaps weekly for the term. He’ll come to enjoy them, I expect.”</p>
<p>“You’re sort of worked up about the whole bath thing,” Hermione observed.</p>
<p>“I hate people who don’t do things properly,” Malfoy said. “And I hate it even more when other people have to pick up the slack for their ineptitude.”</p>
<p>“A Malfoy with a work ethic,” Hermione said. “That’s new.”</p>
<p>“Imagine my surprise at discovering I had one,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“How did you get into –“ Hermione gestured. “This, anyway?”</p>
<p>“I was doing the right thing for the wrong reasons,” Malfoy said. “I thought I might be able to – I don’t know, make things right about Snape. I think I was trying for some kind of penance.” He looked wryly amused. “He’d probably find it funny that I ended up liking it. He used to tell me that nothing was worth doing if you didn’t bother doing it well.”</p>
<p>“Is that why you’re here?” Hermione said. “Why you took the job, I mean.”</p>
<p>“No,” Malfoy said. “I got a lot of university students when I was working in Africa. I like teaching. McGonagall offered, and I wanted…” He looked up at her. “You ended up here. The appeal can’t be completely lost on you.”</p>
<p>“Funny,” Hermione said, stepping down. “The appeal actually was entirely lost on me when I decided to come, but –“ She considered how much she really wanted to say. “You’re not the only one who ended up liking something you thought would be a punishment.”</p>
<p>Malfoy looked at her for a long moment. “I guess we might have something in common,” he said.</p>
<p>“An intense dislike of Horace Slughorn and the hope that the lunch special is shepherd’s pie?” Hermione said, lightly. She wasn’t entirely prepared to think about letting Malfoy see any real parts of herself.</p>
<p>“You say intense dislike, I say hatred,” Malfoy said. “Also, shepherd’s pie is a terrible invention, I can’t fathom what anyone was thinking when they started making it.”</p>
<p>“I assume they weren’t bothering to think of heathens like you,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“Watch it,” Malfoy said. “It’s not my fault Slytherins have decent taste.”</p>
<p>“I’m surprised the Sorting Hat hasn’t incorporated that into its song,” Hermione said. “You know, cunning, ambition, and a hatred of delicious lunch dishes.”</p>
<p>“Too right,” Malfoy agreed, but he was laughing.</p>
<p>It took them the rest of the afternoon and the next morning to finish getting the stores in order, though Hermione considered it time well spent since Malfoy had started most of the infirmary potions.</p>
<p>“If you want them done properly, I can’t do these until the full moon,” he’d said, when she’d showed up the second morning. “And I’m going to have to wait until the restocking order shows up for these three.” There was already a rather large stack of potions on his desk, all of which had thorough labels in neat handwriting.</p>
<p>“This wasn’t on the list,” Hermione said, startled.</p>
<p>“I made an executive decision,” Malfoy said. “The anxiolytics you listed are effectively useless.” He was casting spells to remove cobwebs; Hermione was fairly certain the spider exodus was nearly as bad as when they’d had a basilisk in the castle. “But you knew that already.”</p>
<p>“This is above my clearance to brew, and I haven’t been able to order it in years, they can’t ship it to me,” Hermione said. “And I don’t know where you found selkie fur.”</p>
<p>“I have my ways,” Malfoy said, coughing as a cascade of dust came down off a shelf onto his head. There was, fortunately, a shielding charm on the cauldrons sitting at the back of the room. “Give me a new list of things you actually want, not things you’ve been getting by with.”</p>
<p>“I’ll think about it,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“What – bugger,” Malfoy said, levitating a small, squirming mouse out from behind a cupboard. He glared at it. “If you don’t leave and take all your brethren with you, I’m going to have first years dice your tails up.”</p>
<p>He dropped the mouse in the hallway and it fled.</p>
<p>“I may have to let you borrow Crookshanks,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“I may have to get a cat,” Malfoy said. “And quit –“ He shoved the cupboard over, casting cleaning spells with a sigh. His smelled faintly of sage. “Granger –“ He finally stood up, walking over to her. More like stalking over, really, if she thought about it. She vaguely remembered how he’d moved as a teenager, and she could see the connection, although he’d never made her step back before. He stopped, not quite too close but on the edge of it.</p>
<p>“I’m only saying it once more,” he said. “I have every intention of being good at my job. Somewhere in the eighty-page contract I signed is a stipulation that part of said job includes brewing medicinal potions for you. I’ve got several hundred books on the matter, a rather good network of academics who are happy to trade me ingredients, and a decent connection to the black market if all else fails on rare ingredients. Not to mention that I’m probably the world’s expert on African medicinal plants because I literally wrote the bloody book on them.” He was looking down at her. “Quit playing small with your requests. It’s insulting. The only thing you’d possibly be thinking about is what you thought I could or couldn’t do.”</p>
<p>“Don’t try to intimidate me into things,” Hermione said, meeting his gaze. “I don’t like it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t treat me like I’m incapable and it won’t be necessary,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“I thought you were playing nice with the Gryffindors,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“I never play nice,” Malfoy corrected. He looked irritated. “Don’t make the mistake of thinking I’m domesticated these days, Granger, you’ll be very sorry.”</p>
<p>“Was there a point to pretending to be friendly?” Hermione said. He stepped forward. She didn’t step back again.</p>
<p>“I’m not playing games,” he said. “I want what I said I wanted, which is a fresh start. But you can’t possibly think that I’d find it acceptable that a castle of children would go without something just because it was a challenge. That’s not how I work. You’ve read my books, you know it.”</p>
<p>Hermione took a moment. “Don’t ever accuse me of playing small again,” she said.</p>
<p>“Don’t do it and I won’t,” Malfoy said. </p>
<p>He turned, going back to the cupboard, and Hermione drew in a breath. In the space of a moment, he’d returned to looking faintly annoyed at rodent interruptions without a single trace of the intensity he’d been showing. But he was right: she knew exactly how capable he was. Her list seemed almost unimportant and certainly not worth the trouble of arguing over, but she thought about the few times someone had accused her of taking a position that was beneath her. That hadn’t gone over well either.</p>
<p>“Do you have a quill?” she said, finally.</p>
<p> “In the top desk drawer,” Malfoy said. “Write that down then help me figure out what to do about all this soot on the ceiling.”</p>
<p>Hermione looked up. “Scrubbing spells?” she said, doubtfully.</p>
<p>“I think I’m going to have to dissolve some of the bloody rock,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“On the bright side, you have an entire weekend before the students show up,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“Oh, that long,” Malfoy said. “On second thought, I might want to borrow the cat after all.”</p>
<p>Hermione didn’t see Malfoy for a few days; Neville and the rest of the staff came back, and she spent the weekend reorganizing her office and reading for inordinately long periods of time in the bath. She’d discovered another full batch of potions in the infirmary on Sunday morning along with an annotated copy of her list. Most of the things that weren’t crossed off had a “currently brewing” next to them. There were a few others that had notes about why Malfoy couldn’t start them, but there was only one that he’d circled. It was slightly raised, and when she touched the ink, a second note appeared.</p>
<p><i>I’m checking Fisher and Lowe, 1992</i>, it said. <i>Isn’t this solely theoretical, Granger?</i></p>
<p>“You said anything,” Hermione informed the note. She was putting away the last of the migraine draughts when another piece of paper appeared.</p>
<p>
  <i>Nearly well-played, but it’s not impossible. 10 points to Gryffindor for tenacity.</i>
</p>
<p>“Go away,” Hermione told it. Her entire list shimmered and disappeared.</p>
<p>“Damn it,” she said. “Ten points from Slytherin for stubborn idiocy.”</p>
<p>She felt a vague uncertainty in the castle’s magic; it wasn’t term and the house points had all been set to zero. She realized that she’d played directly into his hand. “Ten points back,” she said. The slightly uncomfortable feeling went away, and she resisted the urge to send an owl to the dungeons with some sort of witty retort.</p>
<p>He took a seat next to her at the head table before the Sorting Feast.</p>
<p>“If I bribe you with an exceptionally good vintage, could I get you to help me unpack these crates?” he said. Malfoy, apparently, didn’t feel the need to concern himself with small talk.</p>
<p>“Since you’ve got wine,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’m also capable of delivering an excellent chocolate torte,” Malfoy said. “The elves missed me.”</p>
<p>“I highly doubt that,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“Oh, all right, I bribed them,” Malfoy said. “But I still have excellent chocolate torte.”</p>
<p>“How do you even –“ Hermione began, but Malfoy grinned, sudden and surprisingly bright.</p>
<p>“Got you,” he said.</p>
<p>“I could probably help,” she said, thoughtfully. “Since I don’t have to deal with any first years tonight. You know, not being anyone’s Head of House.”</p>
<p>“The prefects say you’re very kind when the first years get sad and homesick,” Malfoy said, still grinning. “They even implied that you hand out cocoa. I can’t imagine I’ll be much use for anything other than getting them to the dungeons.”</p>
<p>“She does,” Neville said, leaning over. He looked amused. “I just stick a redirect charm on my office door and they all go bother her instead.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so you don’t send his first years right back,” Malfoy said. “That sounds like Gryffindor favoritism if you ask me.”</p>
<p>“If I’m helping the first years, I can’t help you unpack crates,” Hermione pointed out.</p>
<p>“Can so,” Malfoy said. “They’re too new to realize that you don’t live in the Potions classroom. If anyone has a problem, they can find you there.” He still looked smug. “And it’ll be closer for the Slytherins.”</p>
<p>“Torte and wine and don’t even think of sending me any Gryffindors,” she warned Neville.</p>
<p>“Damn, that backfired,” Neville said.</p>
<p>“Should have known better,” she said.</p>
<p>“Bribery is always an excellent fall back, Longbottom,” Malfoy said. “It even appears to work on Granger.”</p>
<p>“That’s a great strategy,” Neville said, looking amused. “Wait until you’ve got your first class of Gryffindor and Slytherin first years, see how well it works.”</p>
<p>McGonagall shot them a look, and Hermione refilled her wine glass; the Sorting and speeches seemed to take longer every year. She was briefly surprised when McGonagall introduced Malfoy and there was rather thunderous applause – she looked out and realized that even the seventh years were too young to have really known about any role the Malfoys had played in the war. And the students had despised Slughorn.</p>
<p>“Well, they’re doomed,” Neville remarked under his breath. “So optimistic and so destined for disappointment.”</p>
<p>“Oh ye of little faith,” Malfoy said. “I have every intention of winning them all over.”</p>
<p>“Professor Malfoy, did you have something you wished to say?” McGonagall said, pointedly.</p>
<p>“Only that I’m very much looking forward to meeting everyone,” Malfoy said. He very nearly sounded sincere. There was another round of applause.</p>
<p>“Poor, deluded children,” Neville whispered.</p>
<p>“I feel very sorry for them,” Hermione murmured.</p>
<p>“Careful, I won’t ask for torte,” Malfoy said, once McGonagall had finished speaking and the room and descended into noise again.</p>
<p>“Careful, I won’t come unpack your crates,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“And to think I thought having you here was going to be unpleasant,” Neville said. “No one’s ever willing to talk back to Hermione.”</p>
<p>“Because everyone else is smart enough to know better,” Hermione said. “I think Malfoy’s fallen on his head recently.”</p>
<p>“I know Malfoy’s fallen on his head recently, he’s not horrible these days,” Neville said.</p>
<p>“Just you wait,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“Really, let me know how it goes with the first years,” Neville said, clapping him on the shoulder. “I’m going to go talk to the Head Boy.”</p>
<p>“You know, I think he might not hate you,” Hermione said, after he’d gone down the stairs.</p>
<p>“Shocking, isn’t it?” Malfoy murmured.</p>
<p>“And I’m almost enjoying your company,” she said. “I don’t know what to make of it.”</p>
<p>“High praise,” Malfoy said. “I suppose it might be said that I’m tolerating yours. I’ll stop once I’ve finished using you for help with potions, though.”</p>
<p>Hermione laughed. “Let me know how that works with this whole undying vow never to let my stock of fever reducers run low,” she said.</p>
<p>“It’s unbreakable,” Malfoy said, straight-faced. “I’d die before I let that happen.”</p>
<p>Later, watching Malfoy go into ecstasies over his new potions ingredients, Hermione considered the fact that Neville appeared to actually have let things go. He was usually a better judge of character than she was, and if she was honest, he was usually more cautious too. The fact that he didn’t seem to think Malfoy was anything to get worked up over was slightly unexpected, but the truth was that… he wasn’t. She suspected that if she could move on, if she could get past the fact that Malfoy wasn’t the same person that he’d been a decade before, she might not entirely hate him. In fact, evidence suggested that they might even get along.</p>
<p>“You’re thinking too hard for someone who’s had three glasses of wine,” Malfoy said. “Come see how perfect these dragon scales are.”</p>
<p>“Oh, all right,” Hermione said. It was somehow much easier than arguing with herself about the whole thing.</p>
<p>The next morning, Hermione was in her office when every alarm spell in the infirmary started to go off. She took the corridor at a dead run; the fact that all of them had gone off suggested that someone in the castle needed her, and the spells weren’t overly sensitive. One of the seventh year Hufflepuffs burst into the room a moment later.</p>
<p>“Professor Malfoy says to tell you –“ she was breathing hard. “He said I should get here first.”</p>
<p>“What happened?” Hermione demanded.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she said. “It was all right and then –“</p>
<p>“Get out of my <i>way</i>,” she heard from the staircase, and then Malfoy was there, an unconscious girl in his arms. She was completely asleep.</p>
<p>“Damn it,” Hermione said. “Get her down here.“</p>
<p>“I know,” Malfoy said. He was casting half the same spells she was, and Hermione could feel the strange sensation down her spine that meant her magic was linking with someone else’s.</p>
<p>“She’s breathing normally,” she said, reaching to touch her, and Malfoy stepped back quickly. He almost ruined her monitoring charm.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch her,” Malfoy said. He was breathing hard too. “I’m not sure it’s safe.”</p>
<p>Hermione didn’t bother to argue the point that if something was truly unsafe, Malfoy probably shouldn’t have carried her. She cast another series of spells, noting as Malfoy set her on a bed that it was Natalie Hemmings; she was one of the brightest Ravenclaws. She remembered her at eleven, showing up after tripping down a staircase with a broken wrist – she’d started the same year Hermione had. She threw a series of stasis spells onto her and Malfoy finally let go.</p>
<p>“She’s okay, just asleep,” Hermione said. “I need you to tell me –“</p>
<p>He looked at her for a long moment, walked over to her sink, and was promptly sick.</p>
<p>“You,“ he said, after he straightened up, looking at the girl who had come in first. “Tell me your name again.”</p>
<p>“Lavinia,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“Right,” Malfoy said. “Twenty points to Hufflepuff for your exceptionally fast running. Go tell the rest of the class that they’re dismissed. And if anyone got even the slightest bit of that on themselves or if it took them more than three minutes to get out of the room they’d better come up here.“</p>
<p>“You said that already,” Lavinia said. “That they needed to follow you to the infirmary straight away.” She looked pale. “Is Natalie going to be all right?”</p>
<p>“She’s perfectly fine,” Hermione said, firmly. “Really.”</p>
<p>“Everyone’s in the hall,” Lavinia said.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Malfoy said. He ducked out the doorway for a moment, waiting for Lavinia to follow, and Hermione heard the low tone of his voice before there was a rush of footsteps down the stairs.</p>
<p>“What in the hell happened?” she said. “I mean, nothing’s wrong, exactly, but nothing’s waking her up either.”</p>
<p>“She tried to levitate a cauldron of Belle Dormant,” he said.</p>
<p>“And you were brewing a bloody coma potion without an antidote on hand?” Hermione said. “Honestly, you were brewing a coma potion at all? I told you they had absolutely no experience with anything advanced.”</p>
<p>“Of course I had the antidote, I gave it to her,” Malfoy said. “I gave her three vials, actually. But I don’t think people usually douse themselves in it during the first stage of brewing.”</p>
<p>“Tell me that first next time,” Hermione said. “Better yet, don’t have a next time.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think –“ Malfoy said. “I knew they weren’t experienced, but it’s a stable potion if you don’t take a bath in it. It’s supposed to be on the third-year curriculum and they’re bloody seventh year NEWT students. I just didn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to try to levitate a cauldron full of potions ingredients.” He looked pale and furious. “There’s a difference between not teaching students the right thing and not teaching them anything at all.”</p>
<p>“The only students you’re going to be able to teach at level are the first years,” she said.</p>
<p>“A fact that I’ve suddenly been made acutely aware of,” Malfoy snapped.</p>
<p>“Don’t –“ Hermione said, then sighed. He looked utterly horrified and rather guilty. “I should have said more. McGonagall really should have said more. But it’ll be all right. It’s not the worst potions accident I’ve seen.” She paused. “Not by a long shot, actually.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t any of you think to do anything about the entire situation?” Malfoy demanded.</p>
<p>“Of course I did,” Hermione said. “When that started happening, McGonagall made Slughorn agree not to teach any dangerous potions. The students haven’t been learning anything, but I stopped getting –“ She paused. “Well. This kind of thing.”</p>
<p>“And the road to hell is paved with good intentions,” Malfoy said, bitterly.</p>
<p>“I’m going to need more of the antidote,” Hermione said, finally. “And if there’s any left, a sample of what got on her. But she’s perfectly all right until we sort it out.”</p>
<p>“It’s all over the floor,” Malfoy said. “I’ve got to get back down there before my next class walks through it and falls asleep too.”</p>
<p>“I’ll see if there’s anything in my books about an overdose on this,” she said. “I’ll owl Mungo’s too. But most of the time it’s a proportionate dose of the antidote given via the same mechanism. So we may just have to dunk her in a dilute bath of it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Malfoy said, finally.</p>
<p>“It’s my job,” Hermione said. “Try not to send anyone else up here today, though.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ve got first years,” Malfoy said. “It’s a safety lecture and cutting up spearmint. If I can’t manage that safely, I should probably resign.”</p>
<p>“You won’t if I have anything to say about it,” Hermione said. She bit the corner of her lip; Malfoy was right that no one had properly warned him. “If you bring your lesson plans to my office tonight, I can try to set you straight on who can do what.” She paused. “Honestly, she should have known better. The seventh years had at least a few years of Slughorn being decent. But they’ve gotten sloppy.”</p>
<p>“Presumably from never having to learn that potions can be dangerous,” Malfoy said, but there wasn’t any real bite to it. “I’ll bring you more of the antidote.”</p>
<p>In seven years, Hermione hadn’t lost a student. If she was honest, there had been remarkably few near misses for a group of teenagers living in a castle of dangerous things. Probably more to the point, Natalie wasn’t actually in danger, she was just unconscious. Still, Hermione was relieved when she woke up sputtering in a very cold bath of antidote.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank god,” Malfoy said, then: “Granger, can I take a thousand points from Ravenclaw? What were you thinking?”</p>
<p> “Malfoy, not the time or place,” Hermione said, firmly. “Go find her some tea.”</p>
<p>“He seems sort of… intense,” Natalie said, when she was safely wrapped in quite a few blankets and on her third mug of tea. Hermione had finally sent Malfoy off to do something useful like chop spearmint. His broody pacing had been a bit over the top.</p>
<p>“He was also very intense when he bolted up here because he was worried about you,” Hermione said. “Not to mention keeping all your classmates from getting hurt.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know,” she said. “It was stupid. We were supposed to carry them over. But they’re untippable cauldrons. So I just thought…”</p>
<p>“Cauldrons are designed to be magically neutral,” Hermione said, mildly. “Meaning that spells can’t keep a grip on them.”</p>
<p>“I –“ She buried her face in her hands. “What if Professor Malfoy thinks I’m a terrible student and really does take a thousand points and won’t let me stay in NEWT level potions?”</p>
<p>Hermione was reminded again of the fact that Ravenclaws occasionally had terrible priorities. And of the fact that her priorities at seventeen had probably been equally terrible.</p>
<p>“I think he’s glad you’re okay,” Hermione said. “Accidents happen.”</p>
<p>The pacing, as it turned out, seemed to be something Malfoy was loath to give up, even after dinner in her office. Hermione finally looked up from the sofa after he’d made approximately the sixtieth circuit around her desk.</p>
<p>“If you don’t sit down, I’m going to hex you to the chair,” she said. “I’m not afraid to use Unforgiveables, Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“I think –“ he started, then went back to pacing.</p>
<p>“Malfoy,” Hermione said, then finished the scroll she was reading. “I think this is fine for the second years.”</p>
<p>“You actually have to ingest that one for it to have any effect,” he muttered. “Not that I’m not concerned about that eventuality.”</p>
<p>“Malfoy!” Hermione said. She got up and stood directly in his path, forcing him to stop abruptly.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” he said.</p>
<p>“I get it,” she said. “It wasn’t a great first day. The second years blew things up. The seventh years attempted to commit suicide via cauldron. I assume the first years probably did something stupid, they’re first years. You weren’t prepared, which wasn’t actually your fault, and you think you should go home and let someone else handle it before anyone gets killed.”</p>
<p>“Something like that,” he muttered.</p>
<p>“Look,” she said. “I suggested you for the job. Actually, you were the only person I wanted for the job, and I was still operating under the impression that you were a racist, elitist Slytherin with delusions of grandeur.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I ever –“ Malfoy said. “Oh, all right, I deserved that.”</p>
<p>“My point is,” Hermione said. “My job is to keep them safe. If you want me to trust you to do yours, you’d better trust me to do mine. I wouldn’t have told McGonagall to hire you if I didn’t think you could teach them.”</p>
<p>“I obviously can’t,” Malfoy said. “Apparently you were mistaken.”</p>
<p>“Malfoy,” Hermione said. “How long has Neville been here?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “Three or four years?”</p>
<p>“Six, actually,” she said. “And he had the same mix of years as you.” She tried not to laugh, because it wasn’t going to help anything. “One of his seventh years sliced his hand open while cutting up water hemlock root, and the student wasn’t going to tell him about it. It was only, you know, the copious amounts of blood all over the place that tipped him off. And he had a first year get lost in a greenhouse and somehow stumble into a bee hive, apparently with some truly nasty bees. And his second years destroyed a bed of something or another, he was very unhappy at lunch.”</p>
<p>“But he’s good,” Malfoy said. “Everyone says he’s good. The students seem to like him.”</p>
<p>“Of course he’s good,” Hermione said. “That’s my point. The first day is miserable for everyone. And we’d be a terrible school if we coddled them, so we don’t. But that means that sometimes they get into things. Which is why I’m around. When I came out here, I thought I’d be handing out Pepper Up and contraceptive potions and stitching up a few cuts. But my job is actually challenging most of the time.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Malfoy said, finally.</p>
<p>“Now who’s playing small,” Hermione said, going back to the sofa. “You can’t get in my face about how seriously you’re taking your job and then panic at the first sign of trouble.”</p>
<p>“I’m good at potions and university students,” he said, sitting in her loveseat. Crookshanks leapt into his lap. “I’m suddenly not so sure about teenagers. One of the first years came and cried in my office.” He was staring at the fireplace and looking brooding again. “I wasn’t really sure what to do about it, so I gave him some toffee and told him that I was sure his parents would owl soon.”</p>
<p>“Did it work?” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure,” Malfoy said. He’d started petting Crookshanks; apparently they’d made friends while Crookshanks was clearing out the dungeons. “He stopped crying.”</p>
<p>“Then it worked,” Hermione said. “He’s probably owling his parents at this very moment about how great his Head of House is.” She grinned. “They’ll send you a grateful note and a bottle of scotch or something.”</p>
<p>“Is that a thing?”</p>
<p>“I have more alcohol than I could possibly drink,” Hermione said. “And I had to give away half the chocolate last year, I couldn’t eat all of it. I keep the notes, at least. They’re usually sweet.”</p>
<p>“I suppose tomorrow is another day,” Malfoy said. “It’s not as if you can just call Slughorn back, which is probably for the best.”</p>
<p>“You’ll be fine,” she said, tossing a scroll at him.</p>
<p>“Hello?” someone said. There was a knock on her office door, which she supposed usually wasn’t closed.</p>
<p>“Come on in,” she said.</p>
<p>“I thought we were working on –“ Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“Busy?” someone said, sticking his head around the door frame. She recognized the exceptionally messy brown hair.</p>
<p>“Rory!” she said, with a grin.</p>
<p>“And Thomas and Peter and Lena,” he said. “We thought you might have missed us. Oh, hello. I think you’re our new Head of House, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Malfoy said. “Slytherins?” he mouthed at her behind a hand, looking confused.</p>
<p>“Rory Locke, sixth year,” Rory said. “We just wanted to say hello.” He was looking at Malfoy skeptically. “We’ve got tea and scones, we nicked it from the kitchens. If you’re not busy.”</p>
<p>“We’re not,” she said. Malfoy made a small noise of protest. “The rest of you could probably come in from the hall.”</p>
<p>“Thank god, this is terrifically heavy,” Thomas said, levitating a plate of scones.</p>
<p>“Ugh, you think you’re so funny,” Lena said, stepping around him. “Hi, Dr. Granger.”</p>
<p>“Would you get out of the way?” Peter said. “We’re never going to get to the bloody scones if –“ He stopped. “Professor Malfoy?”</p>
<p>“I said he was in here, didn’t I?” Rory said, flopping down on the rug in front of the fire. Crookshanks went to say hello.</p>
<p>“I think half of England heard you, yes,” Lena said. “Where am I putting this tea?”</p>
<p>“On the desk?” Hermione said. “Where it usually goes?”</p>
<p>“Hello,” Draco said. He sounded cautious.</p>
<p>“They’re sixth years,” Hermione said. “They like to terrorize me on a regular basis. You’ve just met Rory, that’s Thomas Ryan, Lena Tuppington, and Peter Selwyn.”</p>
<p>“Shove over,” Lena said, sitting next to Rory. Hermione had discovered that Slytherins, apparently, didn’t like to stand so much as drape themselves over every available surface.</p>
<p>“I think you were in school with my uncle,” Peter said. “He was a sixth year when you were first or something, though. You’re the same year as Dr. Granger, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“We were, yes,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“Toby Selwyn?” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“That’s him,” Peter said. He was looking at Malfoy a little warily. Hermione abruptly remembered that his family traveled in the same social circles as the Malfoys, although they hadn’t really chosen a side during the war. Malfoy tensed, although it was subtle enough that Hermione almost missed it.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ll vouch that Professor Malfoy’s not terrible,” she said, lightly. “He hasn’t even taken any points today. And he had first years.”</p>
<p>“You haven’t?” Rory said. “Not even from Gryffindors?”</p>
<p>“I keep forgetting I can do it,” Malfoy said, ruefully.</p>
<p>“I’ve got you tomorrow,” Thomas said. “The rest of them don’t know what’s good for them and are off doing Charms.”</p>
<p>“You’re just a masochist,” Lena said. “You could’ve had Slughorn all seven years, you don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Hey, you liked his parties,” Thomas said.</p>
<p>“Well, yes, those had food,” she said. Rory was already on his second scone.</p>
<p>“I think Thomas is going to be your only halfway decent student,” Hermione said, laughing. “But I’m biased, he’s been taking lessons from me for the past few years.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I came to see if you were free Thursday nights,” Thomas said. “I mean, and because Rory’s been pining over you all day. We figured he needed chaperones before he did something stupid like writing you a sonnet again.”</p>
<p>“It was a good sonnet,” Rory said.</p>
<p>“It was a terrible sonnet,” Peter said. He finally came to sit in the other armchair. “And you were going on and on about Dr. Granger at dinner, you were probably thinking of doing daft things again.”</p>
<p>Rory had asked her to the Yule ball – which McGonagall had decided to make a yearly event – three years running. He seemed rather unrepentant about his crush.</p>
<p>“Just because you haven’t got eyes,” Rory said.</p>
<p>“Boys,” Lena said.</p>
<p>“Maybe she got married or something over the summer,” Peter said. “You never know.”</p>
<p>“No wedding ring and anyway, Professor Longbottom married what’s-her-face from the tavern, not Dr. Granger,” Rory said.</p>
<p>“Yes, because Scotland is limited to one wedding a year,” Lena said.</p>
<p>“Right here,” Hermione said, mildly. “Sitting on the sofa in front of you.”</p>
<p>“Gloriously,” Rory said. He’d gone for a third scone.</p>
<p>“So, Thursdays,” Thomas said.</p>
<p>“You actually have a decent professor now,” Hermione said. “No more lessons in my office.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Thomas said. He looked at Malfoy speculatively. “Would you do extra lessons?”</p>
<p>“Ah,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“Say yes,” Hermione murmured.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Malfoy said. “Maybe you could come by my office and tell me where you and Granger left off.”</p>
<p>“Oh, last name basis,” Rory said. “You two must get along swimmingly.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be a prat just because you’re jealous,” Thomas said. “Ignore him, he’s an idiot.”</p>
<p>“I’m not jealous,” Rory protested. “Hermione knows how I feel. She just can’t return my affection yet because there’s some statute.”</p>
<p>“<i>We</i> are not on a first name basis,” Hermione teased. “But you can give me one of those scones.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to give in someday,” Rory said. “I can tell. The age difference doesn’t matter so much with witches and wizards, you know. And I’ll be out of school and –”</p>
<p>“God, shut it,” Peter said. “D’you want to hear what happened in Transfiguration today? It was brilliant.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I thought McGonagall was going to kill Larson,” Lena said. “He turned Sarah’s tea kettle into a –“</p>
<p>“Shh,” Rory said. “You can’t discuss that sort of thing with Dr. Granger. She has class.”</p>
<p>Thomas snorted. “Pretty sure we come up here all the time because she thinks that sort of thing’s funny as hell.”</p>
<p>“Rory, I hate to break it to you, but I’m not all that innocent,” she said. “I’m pretty sure I can handle an explicit tea kettle or two.”</p>
<p>“Quit ruining my gossip, Rory,” Lena said. “Oh my god, how many scones have you eaten? Leave some for the rest of us.”</p>
<p>“I’m growing or something,” Rory said. “Besides, Peter can always get more.”</p>
<p>“Not if you’re going to eat another five of them, I can’t,” Peter said. “The house elves will go on strike.”</p>
<p>It took half an hour for them to apprise her of all the Slytherin gossip, at which point a second year showed up looking faintly green.</p>
<p>“Er, entertain Professor Malfoy for ten minutes,” she said, taking her to the infirmary.</p>
<p>When she came back, her office was quiet.</p>
<p>“They left, something about an essay on the importance of taking Transfigurations seriously,” Malfoy said. “Are they all like that? And I thought you were kidding about the Slytherins.”</p>
<p>Hermione laughed, popping the last bite of her scone in her mouth. She’d had to abandon it. “You get used to it,” she said. “Lena got hexed second year and had to stay in the infirmary for a week, the rest of them kept sneaking in at all hours.” She smiled. “So I gave them some of the other beds and earned their undying loyalty. I really just wanted them to stop setting off the alarm spells at two in the morning, but it worked out in my favor.”</p>
<p>“They’re awfully friendly with you, considering,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“You mean because they’re Slytherins?” she said, stretching out on the couch again.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t going to put it like that, but yes.”</p>
<p>“The house rivalry isn’t as intense as it used to be,” she said. “Well, it is, but there’s not much nastiness to it. There’s a lot more playing dumb pranks on each other than dueling in the halls.” She grinned. “And by the time they get to sixth or seventh year, I’d say there are more couples between them than any of the other houses.” She considered. “Or in houses, even. Kind of strange.”</p>
<p>“You know what they say about love and hate,” Draco said, dryly.</p>
<p>“Something like that,” Hermione said. “And anyway, I’m not Head of a House and I don’t play favorites, so they don’t really think about it.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I’m going to have that luxury,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“No,” Hermione said. “But you’re in serious trouble with this lot if you start favoring Slytherins. They’ve never had a professor who did that sort of thing. I mean, they expect Neville to be closer with the Gryffindors outside of the classroom because he sees them more, but they’re a lot less… insular than we used to be.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t intending on imitating every aspect of Snape’s life,” Malfoy said. “Or any of them, really.” He looked slightly offended.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Hermione said. “I’m still getting used to – well. You.”</p>
<p>“I can’t promise that I’m going to get it all right on the first pass, but I’ll be fair,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“You’re going to make mistakes,” Hermione said. “A lot of them, honestly. I still do. But –“ She propped herself on one elbow to look at him. “You’re exceptional at what you do. They need that. So don’t back down just because it’s hard.”</p>
<p>“Oh, a compliment,” Malfoy said. “Be careful with that.”</p>
<p>Hermione found, astonishingly, that Malfoy was easy to get used to. He took to hanging around her office in the evenings for reasons she couldn’t entirely fathom; it meant a lot more students, but it also meant that a few of the Slytherins and Ravenclaws she’d never had a particularly strong relationship with got used to her. They seemed to like him. She’d thought Malfoy would be good at teaching, but she’d never really expected that he’d be – well, popular.</p>
<p>A truly surprising number of students started showing up for his office hours, and most of the older students were actually asking for extra reading and help outside of class. It got so bad that Malfoy started holding a remedial potions class after dinner on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>
<p>“I’m behind on literally everything,” he said, after a few weeks of it. He was taking up the entirety of her sofa and looking with irritation at what Hermione thought was a journal article. “I can’t even keep up on reading, and I keep forgetting to send my robes down to the laundry, I had to wear my bloody dress robes today.”</p>
<p>“It’s nice of you to give up your free time for them,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>Malfoy looked up and stared at her. “Did you just call me nice?”</p>
<p>“Er, no,” Hermione said. “I meant more like it was a nice thing to do.”</p>
<p>“You just called me nice,” Malfoy said, looking smug for a moment before he went back to frowning. “Have you read this stupid paper on bioluminescent ingredients? Jackson and a bunch of people I don’t recognize? I swear their methods are complete rubbish, but I can’t put my finger on why.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t control for temperature or salinity,” Hermione said. She was trying to organize charts in one of the file cabinets and not getting particularly far.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s it,” Malfoy said. “Never mind, I’m not finishing it.”</p>
<p>“The only thing in that whole stack that’s worth anything is the Greenberg one on neutral ingredients.”</p>
<p>“You couldn’t have told me that before I started?” Malfoy said. He’d been at it for well over an hour.</p>
<p>“You couldn’t have asked?” Hermione said. </p>
<p>“I’m not making that mistake twice, leave me your notes next time,” Malfoy said. “By the way, is there any chance you could take Thursday night? I’ve got something to do, but I don’t want them to get off track.”</p>
<p>“If you’ll make me a pain killing potion that actually works,” Hermione said. The files weren’t cooperating. “I’m getting a migraine.”</p>
<p>“I thought I gave you some of those,” Malfoy said. “Actually, I know I gave you some of those.”</p>
<p>“They’re perfectly useful for everyone else, but they don’t work on me,” Hermione said. “I keep having to take ibuprofen. It doesn’t work either.”</p>
<p>“It’s muggle medicine, of course it doesn’t,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“Aspirin and fever reducing potions are the same thing, and aspirin doesn’t taste terrible,” Hermione pointed out.</p>
<p>“Hmm,” Malfoy said. He was busy drawing something in the margins of one of the papers.</p>
<p>“I just became a medical puzzle, didn’t I,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“You think you asked for a favor, I think you gave me ideas,” Malfoy said. “I’m going to go experiment with this.” He flicked a wand in her direction and closed the drawer.</p>
<p>“I was working on that,” Hermione protested.</p>
<p>“Staring at tiny print isn’t going to help anything,” Malfoy said. “Go find coffee and chocolate.”</p>
<p>“I don’t –“</p>
<p>“Haven’t you learned not to argue with me?” Malfoy said, amused. “I’m always right. You should know that by now.”</p>
<p>“Go do your bloody laundry,” Hermione said. He just laughed.</p>
<p>Malfoy somehow managed to talk her into teaching a medicinal potions class; she still wasn’t completely sure how she’d agreed to it, but the students seemed happy. It helped that Malfoy was very willing to bribe her with wine and torte, which really was annoyingly good and which the elves wouldn’t make for her. She still wasn’t sure how he’d talked them into giving it to him on a regular basis.</p>
<p>A week or two later, he came to lounge around her office later than usual. “Want to do something fun?” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure we have the same definition of fun,” she said.</p>
<p>“Well, come walk around the lake with me,” Malfoy said. “You don’t have to do anything else if you don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“Walk around the lake at –“ Hermione glanced at her clock. “Eleven o’clock at night?”</p>
<p>“If we don’t hurry, I won’t be able to do anything by midnight, and then I’m going to have to wait until spring,” he said, as if the entire proposal was utterly reasonable. </p>
<p>Hermione realized that she didn’t entirely mind the prospect of going for a walk with Malfoy, which was definitely… novel.</p>
<p>“Oh, all right, I’ll get my coat,” she said.</p>
<p>“I brought it already,” Malfoy said. She realized he’d been holding something behind his back.</p>
<p>“That was in my rooms, you know,” she said, mildly.</p>
<p>“Your portrait likes me,” Malfoy said. “Anyway, I knew you’d say yes, and it was on the way up so I thought I’d just save time.”</p>
<p>“I seem to recall having this vague illusion of, what was it,” Hermione said. “Oh, that’s right, privacy.”</p>
<p>“You’re not actually put out, so come on,” Malfoy said. </p>
<p>He held her coat while she put it on – which was unexpected, but then again, it was Malfoy. He had strange ideas about manners and was still pulling out her chair at dinner.</p>
<p>He led her down past the greenhouses and over a crumbling wall, to a path that skirted between the lake and the Forbidden Forest. She rarely went so close to the forest at night, but somehow, she actually believed that Malfoy wouldn’t let anything happen to her. Trusting him felt strange, but when he put a hand out to help her down to the edge of the water, she took it.</p>
<p>“Well?” she said. “It’s too cold for skinny dipping, Malfoy.”</p>
<p>He checked his watch. “Neville and I made something.” He was looking at the water, and when she followed his gaze, she realized that there was something different about a small piece of the lake. The water was flowing differently, and it was almost as if there was light glinting just beneath the surface.</p>
<p>“Er, all right,” Hermione said. “Am I here to see it?”</p>
<p>“No, you’re here because I need to harvest Amazonian water lily roots under a full hunter’s moon and Neville wants these useless ligature liana seed pods that you can apparently only <i>see</i> under a full moon. I’ve only got an hour,” he said.</p>
<p>“Malfoy,” she said, slowly. “I’m not a botanist, but I’m fairly certain those don’t grow in Scottish lakes.”</p>
<p>“Of course they don’t,” Malfoy said, looking offended. “I’m not that hopeless, Granger.” He was looking speculatively at the water. “Well, I suppose some of them do, technically.”</p>
<p>“How did you manage that?” she said, startled.</p>
<p>“It’s complicated,” he said, then looked at her. “Oh, all right, you know I used to work in the flooded forests in the Amazon. I need things I can’t get someone else to harvest halfway around the world, and Neville wanted to research the plants. So we planted one.”</p>
<p>“You stuck a rainforest at the bottom of the lake,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“We stuck a flooded rainforest at the bottom of the lake,” Malfoy corrected. “It wouldn’t have worked if we couldn’t have water on both sides of the spells. The temperature and pH and the other parameters are different, but it’s still water.”</p>
<p>“That’s –“ she said. “Even the Magicozoology Society doesn’t do that sort of thing. It’s incredibly advanced magic.”</p>
<p>“You know perfectly well they couldn’t think their way out of a paper bag,” Malfoy said. “Anyway, no one ever seems to give Neville enough credit, he’s excellent at plants.”</p>
<p>“I knew that,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“Not the extent of it,” Malfoy said. “He’s one of the best magicobotanists I’ve ever seen. I talked the merpeople into seeding everything, then he put an acceleration charm on the trees. We added the other plants a month ago, I had someone send samples from Brazil. He’s got this artificial sunlight charm on it so it matches the actual forest, but for some reason I don’t entirely understand, he claims I’ve got to go cut them at midnight our time.”</p>
<p>“So, just to clarify, there’s a perfectly functional rainforest at the bottom of the lake,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“I said that already,” Draco said. “It’s almost midnight. I’m going to go dig up water lilies. You’re going to stay away from me and collect the liana seeds. It’s warm. I got Neville to push it and give us an extra few hours of daylight. Just, I don’t know, transfigure something into a bathing suit. I couldn’t find yours.”</p>
<p>“Malfoy,” Hermione said. “Were you digging through my wardrobe?”</p>
<p>“No, I tried to <i>accio</i> it,” Malfoy said. “It didn’t work, so I decided it wasn’t worth the trouble.”</p>
<p>“Just out of curiosity,” Hermione said, mildly, “what were you going to do if I said no?”</p>
<p>“It’s very advanced translocation magic,” he said, pulling off his shirt. “You weren’t going to say no. Don’t worry, there aren’t any caimans or jaguars. Your seed pods are bright pink and about the size of your hand. There isn’t anything down there you can get confused about.”</p>
<p>“Malfoy!” she said, again, but he’d already transfigured his jeans and disappeared under the water. His head popped up a moment later. “Don’t forget not to touch the bottom, you’ll stir up all the silt.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to be digging through it?” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“Yes, which is why I already told you not to go near me,” Malfoy said. He disappeared again.</p>
<p>It was the last week of October, which meant that Hermione wasn’t particularly keen on putting on a bathing suit. She was also intensely annoyed that Malfoy had presumed so much. But, if she was being completely honest, he’d been right: she was curious. </p>
<p>“Damn it,” she said, folding her clothes on a rock and transfiguring her knickers into a perfectly reasonable swimsuit. She cast a bubble charm, trying not to let her teeth chatter, and waded in – at least, she tried to and realized why Malfoy had gone in so quickly, because the drop off was so steep that there really wasn’t a bottom close enough to step on.</p>
<p>It was strange – the top few inches of the water were freezing, but then it was warm. She had to blink in the sudden sunlight, even if it was cut by the water and the truly enormous <i>trees</i>.</p>
<p>Malfoy had written perfectly serviceable descriptions in one of the books, but she’d learned relatively quickly while reading his work that he didn’t seem particularly interested in flowery writing, so it caught her off guard. It was strange, seeing an entire forest underwater, and stranger still that the plants weren’t anything she’d ever have recognized.</p>
<p>She kicked her way through the canopy, pushing herself down with the help of some branches, and then had to stare again. There were fish instead of birds, though she didn’t have the faintest clue where Malfoy had gotten those. It was majestic, in a strange sort of way.</p>
<p>Malfoy was off somewhere near the bottom quite a way from her, or she assumed he was due to a small cloud of black silt. </p>
<p>The water was clearer than she’d thought it would be, and it wasn’t hard to see the bright pink pods hanging off a few vines. She went to investigate, and a few minutes later she had enough of them to need to transfigure a bag out of a leaf. It wasn’t a particularly good bag, mostly because her wand didn’t always work well under water. There were a lot of plants, most of which she didn’t recognize, and she was fascinated. She wondered how Malfoy and Neville had ever managed, because she wouldn’t have had the faintest idea how to start. It was strange to realize there was an entire branch of magic she knew almost nothing about, but she could still admire the effect. </p>
<p>She’d had to enlarge her rather leafy bag twice and was about to do it for a third time when something touched her shoulder. She whirled around to see Malfoy, who tapped his watch and pointed to the surface. Hermione was annoyed to realize that she had to leave, but they were definitely losing the light. Bubble charms didn’t last forever either.</p>
<p>When she broke the surface, she nearly went back under just to avoid the cold that suddenly hit her in the face.</p>
<p>“See, you didn’t hate it,” Malfoy said, coming up beside her. He sounded exactly as smug as usual. “I’m talking Neville into publishing something about it just to show up the Magicozoology Society.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Hermione said. “Which might be enough to save you from the fact that I’ve got to walk over and get my clothes and walk back to the castle without freezing to death.”</p>
<p>“Just because you’re terrible at warming charms doesn’t mean everyone is,” Malfoy said. She considered whether it would be in her best interest to punch him again once they were out of the lake.</p>
<p>“I’m not terrible at anything,” she said.</p>
<p>“Does that mean you want to walk over there without mine?” Malfoy said, innocently. “I can certainly arrange that.”</p>
<p>“I can certainly arrange for you to go fuck yourself,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“No need to be snippy,” Malfoy said, and she was suddenly almost hot. She suspected it might be enough when she climbed out.</p>
<p>“You brought me out here in the middle of the night, you made me climb into some presumably piranha-infested forest, you’re trying to give me hypothermia, and –“ </p>
<p>Hermione managed to pull herself back up onto the edge of the lake. She wasn’t entirely cold, which she didn’t feel like admitting to Malfoy. </p>
<p>“And now you’re staring at me in my knickers,” she finished.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous,” Malfoy said. “You’re in a bathing suit.” She could see him grin in the darkness. “Besides, you’re the one half naked by the lake in the middle of October, why did you think that was a good idea again?”</p>
<p>“I spent five entire minutes last night thinking I liked you,” Hermione said. “That was a terrible mistake.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on,” Malfoy said. He’d climbed out too. “I wouldn’t have showed that to just anyone.”</p>
<p>“No, just people you’re using for their seed gathering abilities,” Hermione said, but she wasn’t actually all that annoyed with Malfoy after all. “Thank you.” He’d transfigured his jeans back and was buttoning his shirt. “For letting me see it, I mean. But you could probably just ask for help next time.”</p>
<p>“No, I can’t,” Malfoy said, brightly. “I have to fill my monthly quota of Slytherin manipulation.”</p>
<p>“If I were to kill you and throw your body in the lake, do you think anyone would notice you were missing?”</p>
<p>“You’d miss me,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>She was a little surprised to realize that he was right, not that she had any intention of letting on.</p>
<p>“Name one whole thing I like about you,” Hermione said. “I dare you.”</p>
<p>“I bring you chocolate cake on a regular basis,” Malfoy said. He picked up her coat and held it open for her. “And the students are actually learning potions.”</p>
<p>“Those are incidental,” Hermione said, sliding into her coat. He cast a spell that did up her buttons before she could bother. “I wouldn’t exactly call chocolate cake proof of character.”</p>
<p>“You think I’m funny,” Malfoy said. “And you like the part where I know some magic you don’t. Also, you said last week that you thought I was nice, which is most assuredly a character trait.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say –“ Hermione said, then looked at him. “Actually, would you even have taken the compliment if I’d said it?”</p>
<p>“I’d tell you that you were delusional, because Malfoys aren’t nice,” he said. “Stick to the excellent sense of humor, Granger.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I might like uncharted territory better,” she said. She could see him looking at her in the moonlight.</p>
<p>“Don’t get carried away with that,” he said. “It won’t lead anywhere good.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you ought to stop thinking about what Malfoys are,” she said, “and start thinking about what you are.”</p>
<p>“I <i>am</i> a Malfoy,” he said.</p>
<p>“I know how much work went into that,” she said, gesturing at the lake. “You did that to make potions that help other people. Hard work without any benefit to yourself isn’t a particularly Malfoy thing to do.”</p>
<p>“I can publish on it,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>She laughed. “How many people do you think read advanced potions journals?”</p>
<p>“You do,” Malfoy said. “I assume some other people who matter do as well.”</p>
<p>“There are probably better routes to fame and fortune,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“We should get back,” Malfoy said. “It’s getting late.”</p>
<p>“It was already late when you dragged me out here,” Hermione said. “On the other hand, I don’t have any classes to teach in the morning.”</p>
<p>“Who needs sleep?” Malfoy said, amused.</p>
<p>“Hopefully not you,” Hermione said. “Come on, before we freeze to death.”</p>
<p>“Maybe if we practice your warming charms,” Malfoy said. “There’s still hope, Granger.”</p>
<p>“Die in a fire,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’m fairly confident that went out of fashion in, oh, I don’t know, Salem,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>Malfoy kept coming around, until she was so used to him that it felt strange to be in her office alone on the nights that he was off working with Neville or helping students particularly late. He was infuriating and stubborn and fond of baiting her, but he could debate magical theory for hours. And he was strangely thoughtful. He oiled her squeaking door and started fires if he got to her office first and somehow always knew how she took her tea, no matter how many times she changed her mind about the right amount of sugar for Darjeeling. She gave up on him pulling her chair out at dinner and he actually borrowed a few muggle books, although she wasn’t entirely convinced he’d read them.</p>
<p>And when one of her favorite mornings of the year rolled around, Hermione found she actually wanted to spend it with him.</p>
<p>He wasn’t in the potions dungeon – which wasn’t a surprise, considering how early it was and the fact that it was Saturday – so she actually went to his rooms; she vaguely wondered why they didn’t spend any time there, although it wasn’t really as if they spent time in her rooms either. Malfoy was just always walking her back at night.</p>
<p>“He’s sleeping,” his portrait, a rather temperamental sphinx, informed her.</p>
<p>“Well, wake him up, then,” Hermione said. It wasn’t so early that she felt guilty about it.</p>
<p>“He’s not going to like that,” the sphinx said, but she’d disappeared inside.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Malfoy said, a few minutes later, sticking his head out of the frame. </p>
<p>His hair was a disaster, and he was wearing a Montrose Magpies shirt with holes at the collar. Hermione did her best not to smile.</p>
<p>“The lake froze over,” she said. “By the way, you look a little like Harry.”</p>
<p>“What?” Draco said. He was blinking at her. “Did you come all the way down here at seven in the morning to insult me?”</p>
<p>“It’s eight-thirty,” she said. “The lake froze over. Or, well, at least the part that matters, anyway.”</p>
<p>“My rainforest is perfectly fine, we already thought of that,” Malfoy informed her. “Can I go back to bed?”</p>
<p>“No, we’re going ice skating,” she said. “Get dressed.”</p>
<p>“We’re doing what?” Malfoy said. He looked extremely skeptical.</p>
<p>“Ice skating,” she said, patiently. He seemed to finally notice her gloves and scarf.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” he said. “Do I have to go outside?”</p>
<p>Hermione blinked, then realized that it had only really caught on at Hogwarts after the war. Some of the muggleborns had brought skates, and then everyone had wanted to learn. The older students renewed the barrier spells every year so that no one went where the ice was too thin, but the edges of the lake never froze enough until November or December. It was early this year.</p>
<p>“You’ll see,” Hermione said. “Just get dressed. And wear decent boots, I’ll transfigure them for you.”</p>
<p>“You’re insane,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“It’ll be fun,” she said. “Trust me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, all right,” Malfoy finally said. “Give me five minutes to get dressed.”</p>
<p>It was more like fifteen, and Malfoy’s portrait glared at her the entire time. He finally stepped out. “I just want you to know, there are approximately four reasonable things to do before breakfast, and this isn’t one of them,” he said.</p>
<p>“Just out of curiosity,” she said. “What are we considering reasonable?”</p>
<p>“Sleeping, sex, checking on potions, and walking to breakfast,” Malfoy said. “Have I mentioned how we’re not doing any of those things? The last one might be a sticking point.”</p>
<p>“So you’ll wake up for work, but not for anything fun?” Hermione said, laughing.</p>
<p>“Three of those things are fun,” Malfoy protested. “Well, all right, walking to breakfast is neutral, but you can think about coffee. That’s fun. And I like potions.” He very clearly wasn’t entirely awake yet.</p>
<p>“Quit complaining,” she said. There were already plenty of students out on the lake.</p>
<p>“What are they doing?” Malfoy said. He sounded a little horrified. “Why are they doing it?”</p>
<p>“Ice skating,” Hermione said. “And it’s fun. At least as fun as walking to breakfast.”</p>
<p>“It looks dangerous,” Malfoy said. “What if they fall in?” One of the first years definitely hadn’t been before, and she tumbled to the ice, although she still looked delighted.</p>
<p>“You play <i>Quidditch</i>,” Hermione said. “At least this doesn’t involve heights or falling off brooms.” She held up a thermos. “I brought coffee. You can have some if you agree to go out on the ice.”</p>
<p>“That’s blackmail,” Malfoy said. He yawned. “Or bribery. Something illegal.”</p>
<p>“Practically an Unforgiveable,” Hermione agreed. “I’d better be careful or they’re going to send me to Azkaban.”</p>
<p>“You’re lucky I tolerate your muggle nonsense,” Draco said, but he’d held out a hand. “Give me that.” He was looking at the students, and his eyes narrowed. “Those are perfectly respectable Slytherins. What did you do to them?”</p>
<p>“Blackmail and bribery,” Hermione said, transfiguring her boots into skates and redoing the laces. “Drink that. I’ll come back for you.”</p>
<p>“If you leave me here, I make absolutely no promises about not going back to bed,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>She grinned. “You won’t,” she said, stepping out onto the ice and pushing off. “Now you’re curious.”</p>
<p>“I can’t possibly get any research done if you die,” Malfoy said. “Try not to fall into the lake or crash or – whatever other hazards this terrible activity has.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do my best,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>She skated out near the edge of the ice, though she was still nowhere near the boundary spells. She’d never really liked flying, but she had to admit that skating made her understand Harry’s obsession with speed. Hermione waved to Malfoy, who lifted a hand grudgingly. She wove her way around some of the older students who were skating further out.</p>
<p>“Dr. Granger!” someone called. It was Lena, who darted out of a group of girls. She held out her hands in invitation.  “Come back in!”</p>
<p>Hermione turned around and skated toward her, slowing down as she grabbed Lena’s hands, pulling them into a spin with her momentum. She’d spent most of last year skating with the students, since Neville was utterly hopeless.</p>
<p>“Morning,” Hermione said, grinning.</p>
<p>“Girls,” Peter said, sounding disgusted. He looked about as awake as Malfoy.</p>
<p>“What about us?” Anna Bainbridge said. She was a sixth year Gryffindor.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Peter said, quickly. Anna was infamous for her hexes.</p>
<p>“You didn’t have to come,” Emily Whitlock said. “All the other boys slept in.”</p>
<p>“Lena didn’t sit on all the rest of them and whack them with a pillow until they woke up,” Peter grumbled. “By the way, how is it that girls can get into our rooms but we can’t get into theirs, anyway? The castle turns us upside down if we want to go down their hall, but Lena can come savage me any time she wants.”</p>
<p>“Oh, darling, you know all you have to do is ask,” Lena murmured. She’d pitched her voice low and a little sultry, but she looked as if she was trying not to laugh. </p>
<p>“Not what I meant,” Peter protested, but everyone was already laughing. His cheeks went red.</p>
<p>“It’s good for you,” Hermione said. Lena’s pursuit of Peter and Peter’s complete oblivion were getting ridiculous. “Pillow fights build character.”</p>
<p>“It’s hardly a pillow fight if she pins me –“ Peter started, then thought better of it. “Brought Professor Malfoy, did you? Why isn’t he out here?”</p>
<p>“Something about coffee and the injustice of denying him breakfast,” Hermione said. “Apparently I’m very mean.”</p>
<p>“See?” Peter said. “Professor Malfoy agrees with me. Who wants to come out in the cold before breakfast? Girls are insane.”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Peter,” Emily said. “Otherwise Lena really is going to beat you to death with a pillow.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to see if Lucas brought tea or cocoa or literally anything that’s going to save me from you lot,” Peter muttered, then took off.</p>
<p>“Maybe he brought extra,” Anna said, speculatively. “Want to go find out?”</p>
<p>“Guess we’re going over there,” Lena said. “Have fun with Professor Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do my best,” Hermione said. She waved goodbye, then sped toward Malfoy. He jumped back when she pulled a fast stop and sprayed him with ice, then made a face when she grinned.</p>
<p>“Was that entirely necessary?” he said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, are you still sulking about breakfast?” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“The coffee helped,” Malfoy said. “Marginally.”</p>
<p>“So come out here,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“No, thank you,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“What, are you scared?” Hermione said, grinning. “I bet you are. The students are all going to gossip about it at breakfast.”</p>
<p>“That’s not going to work,” he said, then paused. “Damn it, it might.”</p>
<p>“Come here,” Hermione said, taking one of his hands. She transfigured his boots and put a stabilizing spell on him for good measure.</p>
<p>“I really don’t think –“ he said, but she’d already pulled him out onto the ice.</p>
<p>“It’s not that bad,” she said. “You just push off.”</p>
<p>“This is your idea of fun?” Malfoy said. “I take it back. My teenage views on muggleborns were correct.”</p>
<p>Hermione laughed, letting him go and skating backwards. “Are you really joking about that?”</p>
<p>“You thought it was funny,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s like riding a broomstick only you can’t fall hundreds of meters to your death,” Hermione said. “Try it like that.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but in that scenario, you have a broom that actually responds,” Malfoy said, but he’d tentatively pushed off. “Is this some sort of sadistic muggle torture?”</p>
<p>“You’ve effectively got on training wheels,” Hermione said, dryly. “You can’t even fall.”</p>
<p>“What the hell is a training –“ Malfoy said, then lost his balance. The spell righted him again.</p>
<p>“You know, on bicycles,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“Allow me to modify that: what the hell is a bicycle?” Malfoy said. He pushed off again, looking slightly less traumatized. “Granger, are you literally skating circles around me?”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” she said. “I’ll get cold if I slow down.”</p>
<p>“Or we could both just go back inside,” he said. “Then no one has to be cold.”</p>
<p>“Nice job, Professor!” one of the fourth year Hufflepuffs said, skating past them at a speed even Hermione considered excessive.</p>
<p>“I just want you to know, being judged by fourteen-year olds is absolutely the highlight of my weekend,” Malfoy said. “I’m indescribably happy at the moment.”</p>
<p>“Oh, shut it, they’ll like you more for trying,” Hermione said. “Besides, no one knows that you can’t fall over, they just think you’re a quick study.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, cheating,” Malfoy said, thoughtfully. “All right, that’s a vaguely Slytherin approach, I’ll take it.”</p>
<p>“You can go faster,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“I’m declining that offer,” Malfoy said. “Exactly how long does it take to get proficient at this?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I learned when I was a kid,” Hermione said. “But the first years are always pretty good by the end of winter.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to drag me out here more than once?” Malfoy said. He looked dubious.</p>
<p>“It’s good for you,” Hermione said. “You should have to do things you’re not good at. It’ll keep your ego from taking over the castle.”</p>
<p>“I have yet to see you try a single thing you’re bad at,” Draco said. “You have to take your own advice.”</p>
<p>“Herbology?” Hermione said. “I’m not great at Herbology.”</p>
<p>“Says the witch with an enormous garden outside of her rooms,” Malfoy said. He’d picked up speed again. “And who uses plants all the time in potions.”</p>
<p>“Quidditch,” Hermione said. “I am utterly abysmal at Quidditch.”</p>
<p>“Great, we can play tomorrow,” Malfoy said. “I promise not to let you fall.”</p>
<p>“There’s a difference,” Hermione said. “You can eventually get good at this. There’s practically no chance of me ever getting good at Quidditch.”</p>
<p>“I feel like practically might be overestimating those odds,” Malfoy said.</p>
<p>“Ouch,” Hermione said, amused. “I’m going to take the spell off if you don’t watch it.”</p>
<p>“I think the coffee is wearing off,” Malfoy said. “I feel faint. We should go get breakfast.”</p>
<p>“Want to do something fun?” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“It’s before breakfast,” Malfoy said. “You’ve heard my list, nothing involving ice sports is on it.”</p>
<p>“Consider it a faster way of walking to breakfast with a detour,” Hermione suggested. “Grab my hands.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to like this, am I?”</p>
<p>“The first years do,” Hermione said, grinning.</p>
<p>“Thus indicating that this is a terrible plan,” Draco said. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Showing you the benefits of being able to go fast,” Hermione said. She was fairly good at skating backwards, and it wasn’t exactly hard to pull Malfoy along with her since he was on skates.</p>
<p>“What –“ he said.</p>
<p>“Relax and think about coffee,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>She skated around the entire curve of the ice, going faster when they got further out. Malfoy had looked distinctly unhappy at the start, but by the time she started to stop on the far side, he was laughing.</p>
<p>“All right, I see the –“ he said, breathless, then ran into her. She’d forgotten that he didn’t really know how to stop.</p>
<p>“Oops,” she said, catching him. There was a moment where she thought he might pull her over, but they mostly ended up tangled together.</p>

<p>“Oh, look, you were wrong about something,” Hermione said, righting herself to put some space between them. “I think you might owe me lunch later.”</p>
<p>“Sold,” Malfoy said. “But that comes after breakfast. And checking on my potions.”</p>
