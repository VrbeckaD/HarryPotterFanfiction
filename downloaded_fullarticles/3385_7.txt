  <span> he got it. </span>

  <span>Draco sighs. It’s late July and it’s hot as</span>

  <span> (</span>
  <em>
    <span>because why in the world would you need an AC unit in an ungodly uni apartment?</span>

  <span>) as he scrolls through his 1’238 unread emails. He blearily catches an email from his and Harry’s marching band director and he already knows what it’s about. </span>

  <em>
    <span>Good morning! It’s the moment you’ve all been waiting for!</span>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Below are the drum major and officer positions. I have taken great time and consideration for these positions and hope that you all take them with the utmost care and responsibility. Let’s make this year a great year! </span>

<p>
  <span>Attached is a google doc that he glares at before reluctantly opening it. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>The officer and drum major positions are as follows - </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>

<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As he sprawls out lazily across his futon in an attempt to rid himself of the horrendous heat, Draco internally rolls his eyes. Not out of jealousy, but out of - well, he doesn’t know, but it isn’t</span>
  <em>
    <span> jealousy</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry fucking Potter finally emerges from their bathroom moments later with a fluffy towel around his waist and nothing else. Fucking tosser. Draco eyes him warily as he strides into the living room and goes to move Draco’s feet aside so he can sit down next to him. Draco is too tired to protest and sits up, all too aware that he’s got a smug grin and pompous aura about him. Draco squints. That’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> job.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you hea-”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Potter,” he interrupts, rubbing his temples. “Yes, I fucking heard. Everyone and their bloody mother heard. Congratulations.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco really tries not to sneer but it truly is the hardest thing he’s ever had to do. He sighs for the umpteenth time and out of the corner of his eye he sees Harry’s face falter for </span>
  <em>
    <span>maybe</span>
  </em>
  <span> one second. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Didn’t think I would get it, did you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The thing about Harry Potter is that he has this way about him. Typical-Gryffindor-Harry has never been good at acting or pretending that he’s not broken or severely depressed, wears every emotion on his sleeve for all to see. Draco sees it all living with him - the night terrors from a past worth hiding, episodes of anxiety - the works. So, Draco knows that he’s not actually being smug </span>
  <em>
    <span>or </span>
  </em>
  <span>pompous. However, Draco may or may not have intense feelings for the bloody wanker and all of Harry’s imperfections drive Draco’s heart closer to him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco rubs his eyes. “You’re fucking me, Potter. Of course I knew you would get drum major.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry places both hands behind his head and lounges back onto the arm of the futon, swinging his feet up so they lay in Draco’s lap. Draco shies away at the sudden closeness of Harry’s feet to his barely-clothed nether region. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>From this angle Harry looks too pretty - he’s all sharp lines and pure muscle. With the towel riding dangerously low on his hips he spots the thin trail of dark hair that leads to what’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>underneath</span>
  </em>
  <span> the towel. Draco bites his lip and looks away before Harry notices that he’s staring. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry smiles that goofy smile of his and it’s so adorable that Draco places a hand over his mouth to hide his own smile and takes a deep breath before removing it. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Stop being a tosser and help me organise our itinerary. It’s not even band camp yet and I already have band obligations.” </span>
