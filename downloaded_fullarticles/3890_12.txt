  <strong>Until the Very End</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Chapter One: The Hann Family</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>I look up at the comfortable Belfast home, not much smaller than number five Privet Drive. I know my aunt, uncle, and cousin are all inside, probably sitting in the sitting room. Aunt Daisy will be sitting on the sofa, on the edge of her seat, her hands folded in her lap, trying to soothe a pacing Uncle Gabriel. Uncle Gabriel will be ranting about all sorts of things: me, the state of the house, how the one in Little Whinging is so much nicer, me, the stupidity of the plan, the inconvenience of it all, me. When I arrive, he will not doubt waste a lot of time arguing with me all over again, just as he had done no less than six times back at Privet Drive, threatening not to comply, despite the fact that he's already come here with his family and everything of importance. Noting this, I mentally congratulate myself on setting this to happen several hours before I need to do anything else. Candy will be sitting on an armchair, close to her family but not too close, saying nothing to the words coming out of her parents' mouths.</p><p>Everything is in place. I've paid for the first three months of their rent, set up their passports, drivers' license, gotten both Uncle Gabriel and Aunt Daisy well-paying jobs that they'd probably find enjoyable, enrolled Candy in the best school in the area. I've carefully, painstakingly created new identities for all of them. A brand new life. One without me. I really don't see why Uncle Gabriel is complaining. Not only have I given them a fairy comfortable life, but it'll be like I never existed. A dream come true, really.</p><p>I let out a sigh, shoving my hands in my pockets and walking up the path to the door. Might as well get this over with. Upon reaching the door, I withdraw a key from my pocket, unlock the door and step inside.</p><p>"Madness, absolute madness! How can that bloody girl force us to pack up our lives and move from Surrey to bloody Ireland!"</p><p>"I didn't force you to do anything," I say irritably from the doorway, closing the door and moving into the sitting room. The scene is exactly as I predicted: Uncle Gabriel is pacing, Aunt Daisy is sitting on the sofa and attempting to soothe Uncle Gabriel, and Candy is sitting silently on an armchair. "I gave you an offer because I figured you wanted to live. If you're not scared of Death Eaters and what they can do with you, though, then you guys can pack up and go right back to Privet Drive."</p><p>They all whip around to look at me.</p><p>"How did you get in here?" Uncle Gabriel demands.</p><p>"Spare key," I reply, holding it up. "Don't worry, I'm not keeping it. It'll be Candy's from now on."</p><p>As though to prove my point, I toss it to her. She catches it, examines it for a moment, before shoving it in her pocket. I lean against the doorway, looking over at them with my arms crossed. It was odd, thinking about how much fear they once brought me. Now I can't bring myself to feel much of anything as I look at my aunt and uncle.</p><p>"Who are these so-called Death Eaters, anyway? You never properly explained," Uncle Gabriel says.</p><p><em>Yes, I did, </em>I think. <em>I explained it to you over and over and over. Just because you can't get it through your thick skull, or you just refuse to listen to me...</em></p><p>"The Death Eaters are the followers of a Dark wizard called Lord Voldemort," is what I say, rather mechanically. "They, like their leader, believe that pure-blood wizards - that is to say, wizards who only have wizard's blood in their veins - are superior and that anyone else is below them. That includes wizards with Muggle - non-magical person - blood in them, or just Muggles - non-magical people - themselves. Pure-blood wizards who associate and fight for Muggles are considered to be just as bad. These people murder, destroy, fight, torture, you name it, in order to bring power, all in Voldemort's name.</p><p>"Voldemort," I continue, before the question can even come out of Uncle Gabriel's mouth, "is, like I said, a powerful Dark wizard. He was once in power a while back, but then he was defeated. He's back now, though, and we have to stop him. That's what I'm trying to do, along with Harry. That puts you in danger, though, if the Death Eaters find out about my connection to you lot. They'd torture you, kill you, take you hostage, in an attempt to get to me, and in extension, Harry. To avoid that, I've brought you here, to Belfast, where you'll live under the radar with entirely different identities. I've gotten you and Aunt Daisy, nice, well-paying jobs that I'm sure you'll enjoy, and Candy is already enrolled in the best school in the area, where she'll go come September. I've even bought a nice vacation home in the Caribbean that you go to whenever you can. I'm also wiping your memories, particularly your memories of me, and replacing them with new ones, so that on the off chance they do find you, you won't have anything to tell them. Any questions?"</p><p>"How long will we have to be like this?" Uncle Gabriel demands immediately.</p><p>"Until the war ends," I reply. "Until it's safe enough for you to go out under your read identity. When that happens, I'll find you lot and undo the memory charms that I've put on you, and you can go back to Privet Drive if you do choose."</p><p>"You've paid our rent, enrolled Candy in school, bought us a vacation home, you've bought all this stuff for us - " Uncle Gabriel begins.</p><p>"No need to thank me," I say sarcastically. "I don't think you realise how rare it is for people to be living in comfort and style while they're in hiding."</p><p>"Where did you get all the money for it?" Uncle Gabriel continues, as though I'd never spoken. "How are you getting all of this?"</p><p>"Oh, I'm rich," I say in an offhand tone. Normally, I wouldn't make such a point to brag about it, but I've kept the secret of my parent's money from them because I knew they'd take all my gold for themselves if they caught wind of it, and now I'd quite like to rub it in their faces. Besides, it's not like they ever had any problems with money.</p><p>"You're what now?" Uncle Gabriel says, as though he can't believe his ears.</p><p>"Rich, uncle, I'm rich," I say, louder, as though it's the volume of my voice that's causing problems with him. "My parents left nearly everything they owned to me in their will - which includes all of their money. I've got all your eight and mine and more in gold hidden in the depths of London. I know, I couldn't believe it either," I say, grinning wickedly at the look of disbelief on the faces of Aunt Daisy and Uncle Gabriel.</p><p>"And how long have you known about this?" Uncle Gabriel asks, his voice dangerously calm. Not too long ago, that voice would have scared me.</p><p>"Since I was eleven," I shrug.</p><p>"And you did not think to tell us?"</p><p>"Should I have?" I ask innocently.</p><p>Uncle Gabriel looks like he's at the exploding point. The veins pulsing at his forehead and neck serve as proof. I couldn't count the amount of times I've stared at those veins, tuning out what he was yelling about and wondering what would happen if they actually exploded. When I was younger, I always imagined a proper explosion, with the noises and the fires and the rubble and everything. Once I grew out of this, I had wondered why the hell I would ever think something so ridiculous and far-fetched, even as a child, but looking at those veins once again now, I think I can understand where my younger-self was coming from.</p><p>"Where will you be?"</p><p>To my surprise, this question comes from Candy. She partly seems like she wants to keep her father from exploding, though she does actually seem like she cares to know.</p><p>"Well, I'll be trying to stop Voldemort," I reply, turning to her. "But in the meanwhile, I'll be in hiding."</p><p>"In hiding? Why? Are you some sort of fugitive?" Uncle Gabriel says sharply, apparently momentarily forgetting the fact that I've been hiding countless amounts of gold from them for six years.</p><p>"No," I say, rolling my eyes slightly. "Not yet, anyway. I assume I will be soon enough. That's what I've been saying. My life will be in danger, and in extension, so will yours. This is all to protect you."</p><p>"Why would <em>we</em> be in danger? Why would they come after <em>us</em>, of all people?"</p><p>"Well, I suppose they've assumed that just because we're related, that we've got a close, happy relationship," I say coldly. "A wrong, stupid assumption, but I still don't want you to die because of it."</p><p>"What if you die?" Uncle Gabriel asks bluntly.</p><p>"Dad!" Candy bursts out indignantly.</p><p>"What? It's war she's talking about, isn't it?" Uncle Gabriel says.</p><p>"He's right," I say dully. "It's a fair question. If I so happen to die, I have employed several people that I trust with my life to come get you and restore your memories. At least one of them is bound to make it out alive, so <em>you'll</em> still be fine. Happy?"</p><p>Uncle Gabriel says nothing, only looking at me with narrowed eyes. Clearly, he isn't happy, but he can't think of anything to say to me, which is fine with me. I turn to Aunt Daisy, who hasn't said anything from the moment I've walked in.</p><p>"Do you have any questions?" I ask her. "Or just anything to say in general, since we're all getting it out there?"</p><p>Aunt Daisy is silent for a long time, before saying, "I've... I've heard about these wretched people. My sister would talk all about them. Never to me or our parents, no, but to her freaky little friends, I'd hear them. I've heard what the likes of them can do... if you mean to protect us from them, then I've no question or complaints."</p><p>Hearing his own wife's determination, apparently, sets something off in Uncle Gabriel. He straightens up, and his face hardens with determination.</p><p>"Well, you heard her," he says loudly. "Get on with it, girl!"</p><p>"I thought you'd never ask," I say sarcastically. "Line up. We'll just go down the line."</p><p>Aunt Daisy stands up, as does Candy. Aunt Daisy stands beside Uncle Gabriel, and Candy moves to stand beside her. I pull out my wand and move to stand in front of all three of them.</p><p>"When this is over, you will all be passed out in your bedrooms. You will wake up in two hours, assume that you all just stopped for a quick nap, and go back to your daily lives. Candy will enjoy the summer as any teenager would, and tomorrow, you two will go to work and it will be business as usual. Uncle Gabriel, your name will be Jacob Hann. Aunt Daisy, your name will be Olivia Hann. Candy, your name will be Ariana Hann. Everything will be perfectly ordinary, and it will be as if Hazel Knight does not exist, okay? And because it will be as though I never existed, I think it'll be harmless to tell you lot some things that I've been dying to tell you... I'll start with you, uncle."</p><p>I move to stand in front of Uncle Gabriel, my wand at my side.</p><p>"Just spit it out, then," she says grudgingly. "And make it quick."</p><p>"Don't worry, I will," I say pleasantly. "You know, uncle, I don't know if you know this, but I used to try really hard to please you. Do you remember? You probably don't. I try not to remember it myself. But I tried for years. Whenever you yelled at me for doing something, I'd do the opposite. Whenever you praised Candy for something, I'd try to mimic her. I tried so hard to be perfect for you, just to get your approval, but I never got it. Never. No matter what I did. You'd always find something to criticise, something to yell at me for, something to punish me for. And it'd break my heart, the fact that I was never good enough for you. Eventually, I just gave up and decided there was something wrong with me, that I was just born inadequate and incompetent. I still feel that way sometimes.</p><p>"But that's not it, is it? It never has been. You have me because I defy everything you've ever known. I'm a freak, I'm a witch, I should be impossible, but I'm not. In your mind, I shouldn't exist, but I do. And that's what you hate. That's why you're so cruel to me. Because I defy everything you know. But that's not my fault. I'm not wrong for existing. I haven't done anything. And you will not tear me down and stop me just because you can't to accept me for who I am. So, I'd like to thank you."</p><p>"Thank me for what?" Uncle Gabriel asks me through gritted teeth, his face purple.</p><p>"For teaching me that a narrow-minded person's hatred is not my problem. For helping me realise that me, my existence is valid, no matter anyone would like to say about it. Who knows if I'd have learned it without you."</p><p>"It was my please," he forced out, and I smile an empty sort of smile.</p><p>"Ready?" I ask, holding up my wand.</p><p>"Just do it."</p><p>I wave my wand, thinking, <em>Stupefy!</em> Uncle Gabriel collapses. Aunt Daisy lets out a gasp.</p><p>"What did you do to him?" she demands.</p><p>"I knocked him out," I say serenely. "Don't worry, he's not hurt. He'll wake up in two hours, like I said. Now let me wipe his memories."</p><p>I hold up my wand and say, "<em>Obliviate!</em>"</p><p>Concentrating deeply, I take away all the memories of Gabriel Martin, making extra sure to get rid of all memories and thoughts of me. I'm not that hard to get rid of. He didn't think about me much. I was never someone he concerned himself over. Once I'm finished, I wave my wand again and fill his mind with fabricated thoughts and memories that belong to an imaginary man called Jacob Hann. After I'm done, I move to stand in front of Aunt Daisy.</p><p>"And now for you," I say calmly. "You, Aunt Daisy, once told me that the only reason you took me in was because that I'm my mother's daughter. Because you felt the need to make it up to her for all the times you treated her badly. Do you think treating me even worse than you treated her is making it up to her? Do you think this is making up for your mistakes? Do you think she'd forgive you after all this? Honestly, I don't know. I couldn't tell you. I didn't know her. You knew her better than me, so maybe it is. Maybe, if she's somehow watching this, she's thinking, <em>Yeah, you have made it up to me </em>and wondering why her daughter's being an idiot. That could be it. But I know that if my mother was half the person everyone tells me she was, then she wouldn't forgive you for the way you treated her own daughter. And you wanna know what else I know? I know that no matter what purpose you think you were serving by not throwing me out on the street, I know one thing for sure. I know that my mother is dead. She's gone, and I'm still here, and I don't forgive you." I shrug. "Just so you know."</p><p>"Just get this done with," Aunt Daisy says in a low, mutinous voice.</p><p><em>They're really never going to care,</em> I think, as I smile pleasantly and say, "That's my Aunt Daisy."</p><p>With a wave of my wand, I stun her, too, making her collapse to the floor. I point my wand at her, say, "<em>Obliviate!</em>" and begin wiping any memories and thoughts belonging to Daisy Martin. As with Uncle Gabriel, it's no difficult to get rid of any thoughts and memories of me. They never cared enough to think about me much. If I didn't know any better, I would think that they always knew this was going to happen.</p><p>Once I've replaced the thoughts and memories of Daisy Martin with those of Olivia Hann, I move to stand in front of Candy. I had planned to say something to Candy, too, something about how she had spent so long making my life miserable, but I was still glad we had made it up even after everything, but looking at her now, it all seems so pointless. It feels as though I don't need to tell her anything, because I can tell she already knows, just from looking at her. I don't even say goodbye to her, the way I was planning to, because I don't need to. It appears we've passed a threshold where suddenly, nothing needs to be said anymore. She just nods at me, and I nod back. I wave my wand, think <em>Stupefy!</em> and watch Candy fall to the floor. Once again, I wipe all memories and thoughts that belong to Candy Martin, and replace them with the thoughts and memories of Ariana Hann. It's harder to erase all the memories of me, and I suppose it is nice that she cared enough to think about me every now and then.</p><p>I levitate each of their bodies into their beds, then walk back downstairs into the sitting room. I quickly straighten out the room, making sure it's just as it was before I came along and that nothing is out of place. After all, the Hanns are a family that takes great pride in cleanliness and organisation and wouldn't like their own sitting room to be untidy. Once I'm finished, I looked around the sitting room, stuffing my hands in my pockets. In two hours, they will wake and continue on with their days as if nothing has happened. They will be blissfully unaware of the war raging on in the wizard world, even more so than they already were, and even more blissfully unaware of the danger their least favourite niece is throwing herself into.</p><p>I envy them. The simplicity of it all is something I want more than anything. Though, the part of me that feels jealously is largely overwhelmed by the part of me that pities them. They get simplicity, but they still don't get understanding. They don't know, they don't understand, and they never will... Candy comes close, but not quite close enough.</p><p>After making sure that everything is just as it should be, I walk over to the window and close the gap between the curtains, all the better to make sure that nobody sees me when I Disapparate. Luckily, I had passed my Apparition test with flying colours, something I'd been eager to brag about to Fred and George, who fancied taking bets about how badly I'd fail, something that I'd been very modest about with Ron, as he failed his test the first time around. Mr. Weasley had not lied to me, you do get used to Apparition soon enough, once you do it enough times. It certainly is a relief that I had passed, because I'm not sure how I would've gone to and from Ireland quickly if I hadn't.</p><p>I wonder vaguely how long it will be until I go back to this place. Months? Years? Longer? What if we never succeed and they live this life forever? Well, at least they'd be living comfortably...</p><p>I shake my head, as though to clear it of thoughts like that. I can't think like that. I need to get out of here. I turn on the spot, and one second I'm looking at the neat sitting room, and then all I see is darkness, and then I'm gone.</p>
