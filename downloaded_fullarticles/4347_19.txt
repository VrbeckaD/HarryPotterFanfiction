    <p>
  <span>Numbness was starting to take over, Sirius felt his body weaken as he watched his memories pass by. The oldest memories were the worst, seeing his friends dead, learning about the betrayal of a friend, and twelve years in the darkest, coldest place imaginable. His mind blanked and the last of his memories ceased. He was sure he should be shaking in the cold of this damned thing, but he couldn't feel any of his body. He felt lifeless and empty, was he?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius glanced around, feeling as though he was staring into empty static, he closed his eyes and let himself disappear further into the cold and misery.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The fog continued, it seemed to be a never ending white nightmare of time to think and ponder on the choices that had been made. Had anyone ever escaped this, or did they just continue in the blinding light until they died? Why the hell would something like this have ever been created?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Suddenly, time seemed to hurry, and there was no time left to think, it felt like plummeting to the earth. Then, it merely stopped, and the never-ending sounds of a hospital flooded in. The sudden shock of noise wasn't pleasant in the least.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius sat bolt upright, a pounding force worked at his temples. He reached for his wand in instinct, the last thing he remembered seeing was Bellatrix coming towards him and him falling back into the Veil. Yet, even with that memory clear as day, his wand was no where on his body. His clothes had drastically changed to hospital gowns, and he was attached to beeping monitors keeping up with his heart rate and things of that sort. What kind of muggle nonsense was all of this, honestly?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Panic sank in a little deeper when he realized he had absolutely no idea where he was at all. His wand missing and an extreme lack of—something, inside of his very being. He didn't understand just quite what was missing, it was an emptiness inside of him, but it felt more like a lost memory.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Glancing around the small hospital room he sat in, he found nothing helpful. A whiteboard, with black marker writing explaining certain care routines and some shorthand for medications, hung on the wall directly in front of his bed. At the top of the small white board his own name was written across it, Sirius Black. . . And another name, maybe his doctor's or nurse's? Nothing else looked of importance to him, nothing helpful at least, many of the things inside this room were probably important, but he cared very little for them.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A nurse passed the door of his room and had glanced inside, and she froze staring at him and his sitting up form. “Oh my, oh no, you need to lie back down.” She rushed into the room, her voice panicked with her patient moving at all.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Why, I feel fine, aside from the splitting headache?” His voice was quieter and rougher than he remembered, almost as though he hadn't had anything to drink in days.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Mr. Black, do you remember anything?” She helped him lie back, as he had started to but seemed to get stuck in a halfway upright position. She could see the pain sinking back in.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius' eyebrows furrowed up, and he tilted his head a bit, his hair was shorter than he last remembered it being as well. “No, not exactly, what did happen?” He questioned, keeping his voice down as he felt it become scratchy and hoarse.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She nodded, turning to look at the writing on the whiteboard, “Okay, before I start telling you, would you like me to call your family back in? They left only a few hours ago and I would also like the doctor to look you over.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Family?” His confusion grew, but he nodded. Wouldn't hurt to see where all this lead, would it?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The nurse smiled softly at him, speaking with a calmer voice, “I'll have the doctor come in, call up your family, and bring you a tray of ice and water. I can only imagine how thirsty you must be.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She was gone as quickly as she had entered, and that gave Sirius at least a little more time to collect his thoughts. But they were so scattered and he barely understood what any of this could mean, he should be dead. Yet, he felt as though he was more alive than he had in a very long time, he didn't feel quite as insane, either.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He didn't get much time to think, a young male entered the room, his hair a mess and he looked a bit surprised. The poor thing honestly looked terrified that Sirius was even awake.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, she really wasn't lying to me.” The doctor, Sirius supposed, spoke with a sigh of relief. “You've proved yourself to be a miracle, Mr. Black.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius made a face that may have been more terrifying to look at than to show confusion.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, you don't remember anything, may I come closer to your bedside and check you over?” The young doctor showed a bit more confidence then.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius nodded, watching the doctor move closer to him and start checking his pulse and looking over his body. He checked a few more vital signs, which Sirius didn't know what he was doing. A few minutes of the doctor looking him over and repeating a few of his checks and motions, Sirius was feeling truly exhausted.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The doctor stood up straight and smiled, “Okay, you're perfectly fine, aside from a high pulse. That is almost normal though, you're probably panicked and in pain. . . Would you like to talk about what happened to you? Why you're here?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius nodded, his face showing the ever growing annoyance. He felt fine aside from the splitting headache, all of this couldn't be necessary? Truthfully, he still believed he was dead.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, well, you fell. . . From what I've heard, out of a window. It was only the second story, but you became brain dead and your entire body shut down for six weeks. You were kept on machines, per family requests.” The doctor paused, thinking very hard. “They said you'd prove all us doctors wrong, they were very right though, weren't they?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius almost winced at the young doctor's forced laugh. He finally looked over the doctor, glancing at his name tag to get his last name, Johnson. Nice common name, would be hard to butcher that one.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I guess so, Doctor Johnson.” Sirius pondered his words for a moment, but he never got to say them.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The nurse came in carrying a tray with a pitcher of ice water and a small plastic cup. She placed it on a bedside table and rolled it closer to Sirius.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The doctor smiled, it was a genuine smile. Probably felt amazing to have such a miracle case, Sirius found this very odd. “I'm going to let you rest, you have a call light button hung on the side rail of your bed. If you need anything else, press it, I will be there. . . If I'm not busy.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The doctor was gone quickly and the nurse poured water into the cup in front of Sirius. She smiled at him as he glanced up at her, he didn't know if it was polite to return it, so he didn't.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Your family will be here shortly, they had to pick someone up from school. One said he would be here soon, though.” She sounded very tired, her eyes, Sirius had just noticed, seemed sunken and dark.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius nodded, returning the smile to the nurse with this information. Who would be there? If this was a dream before death, it better be those he wanted there, those he expected to be there. He believed he deserved something good out of this whole mess.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Taking a long drink from his glass, his eyes closing for a moment. It really felt as though he hadn't drank anything in a very long time. Very convincing dream this was turning out to be. How could that be though, never had he dreamed something so real? Never had he been able to feel the water he drank physically pass down his body. This couldn't be real though, he knew this could not be true.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He wasn't lucky enough.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Panic rushed him again and he sat up, pushing the rolling tray away from his bedside. He needed his wand, where could his damn wand have ended up? Didn't he have it when he. . . Oh no, he must have let go of it falling through the veil. It had been such a long time, waiting and falling through the veil. He had to have let it go during sometime in the travel. Letting it go in the veil, if this was real, meant it could have ended up <em>anywhere</em>. If this was true, this would be an alternate universe, his wand could be in some idiot’s hands. They could be playing with it like a damned <em>toy</em>!</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Anger flourished through his very bones but disappeared when the door of his room opened once again. Sirius was caught in an odd position of trying to get out of his bed and trying not to yell at whoever was coming in.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You slick, slimy git!” One of the most familiar voices Sirius knew bellowed across the small room to him. “Trying to jump out of that window like you're still a teenager!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius felt a childish smile grow, “I missed you too, Remus.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius watched whatever anger Remus had been carrying melt away as he moved across the room. He could see Remus was still fuming with anger, it was less though. It felt like a small triumph in a long line of disappointments.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus helped Sirius get back into the bed. A few minutes of utter silence passed, Sirius feeling terrible, sitting there with nothing to say. The two shifted uncomfortably, glancing at each other but never catching the others' eyes.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After floundering like a fish out of water, Sirius glance up and looked at Remus as he began to speak.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I've really missed you, the doctors kept saying you weren't gonna come back. . . It was an awful time, fighting them to keep you on the machines. I had a feeling you'd pull through, I didn't know how, I just knew you would.” Remus glanced around the room. “And—well, here you are. Awake and talking to me for the first time in ages.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius looked up at Remus, he truly was a different person. He couldn't have dreamed up something this complex, could he? What had the Veil done to him? Where had it </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> him? Maybe dying could have been easier? Less worry about the Harry he knew, the Remus he knew, less worry about what would happen without him around.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Even with all that worry flowing around his mind, the gentle touch of Remus' hand on his leg forced it all away.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius went to speak finally, but he was cut off by the door opening again. Suddenly something hit him, he didn't feel as old as he had less than an hour ago. Looking at those who entered, a much younger Harry, he tried to stand again. The grip Remus had on his leg tightened and kept him on the bed.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Sirius!” Harry looked maybe ten or eleven and he looked so bright and happy.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello there, Harry.” A smile came to Sirius' lips and a gentle voice in the back of his head spoke.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>What the hell was that?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The shock had obviously crossed his face as Harry's smile turned quickly into a pout.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No, no, that wasn't about you. Calm down.” Sirius forced his smile to return, and he really tried to look happy.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh! Okay!” Harry scampered back across the room to nestle himself between his parents.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius felt his heart miss a beat, or maybe even two, as he looked up at the two on either side of Harry. Old friends that he hadn't seen in so, so long. It had almost been long enough that he was starting to forget their exact features.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James and his ruffled hair. It could never rest down, could it? Lily and her rather bright eyes and kind smile.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The woman's smile turned sour, “I swear, Sirius, if you ever jump out of a damn window again, I will personally kill you.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There she was, James' wife and a very good friend to everyone in this room. She acted like a parent to him even in whatever version of dream or life this was. It was something that calmed Sirius' thoughts.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That voice came again. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Once again, the voice was gone as quickly as it came. He'd end up killing someone if something in his head kept speaking to him. It'd drive him mad.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius had managed the random conversation in his head better this time. No one looked at him like he had said something terribly rude. He shifted on the bed and looked at them better. They looked amazing, the last time he had seen them, as happy as they had tried to be, they had looked awful. Wrecked with fear and worry, they were trying to stay hidden. He had seen them dead, too. It was not something he wanted to remember though, but the images had never left.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I agree, go ahead and make that a promise, Evans.” Sirius caught what he had said, shaking his head. “You're not exactly an Evans anymore, are ya?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily smiled and Sirius returned the smile. For a long while, they spoke of what had happened, why he had leaped from a second story window.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So, Remus and I were chasing you through the house.” James paused for a moment, continuing shortly after. “I don't really remember why we were, probably because of some bet or joke. . . And you just saw an opportunity and went for it. It was quite wild to watch, and then we heard you hit the ground below. You had done it before, but there had never been that kind of sound before.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus lifted his head for a moment, “Sounded like some large amount of jelly hit the ground.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Quite awful,” said James.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius couldn't fight the small laugh coming out, “I just bolted out the window?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus nodded, he was trying so hard not to laugh, he didn't want to believe it was funny. But, with Sirius being alive and okay, he let himself laugh. James was soon following in their ways, trying to get Lily to understand why it was funny through choked laughter.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She shook her head though, “Bad influences, each of you. Harry is going to be a little lunatic when he gets older.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>From the smirk on Harry's young face, Sirius could guess that this one was already a dastardly little prankster. He learned from the best, Sirius guessed.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The laughter died down, and they all sat in silence. Twenty minutes passed, Harry wandering around the room, touching things. A few small chuckles escaped him when he decided something was funny or odd. Sirius watched his friends awkwardly, and they were doing the same thing. Glances shifting from person to person, and every time someone almost caught somebody's eyes they immediately looked away.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, I'm going to go speak to Doctor Johnson. Going to see when he thinks you'll be able to come home again.” Lily stood up and was out of the room before anyone could protest.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Two more solid minutes passed in complete silence, none of the males in the room looked at each other. Even Harry had preoccupied himself with some minuscule mark on the ceiling.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Finally growing tired of the silence, Sirius spoke, “So, has anything happened since, you know. . .”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry got top marks on all of his tests, Lily gave us all an ear full, even poor Harry who wasn't there, and we all got to see Remus in a very rough state.” James shrugged, not noticing the glare that Remus shot him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius nodded, his hair felt terrible as it moved. It was knotted and felt like it would be hell to undo. He raised his hand to pull at a particular knot that he could see out of the corner of his eye. His eyes shut when he pulled the tangle just a little too hard and felt the hairs pull out of his head. He gave up and decided he'd deal with that later.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I mean, he's not. . . I was a mess.” Remus stumbled over his words for a moment then coughed and stood up.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus stretched his arms up above him and shifted away from the bed. He looked around the room, catching Sirius' eyes for a split moment before casting his eyes to the ground. “The doctor said you wouldn't remember much, what do you remember?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You're names, but I don't remember Harry being young. . .” He stopped himself, realizing he hadn't remembered that Lily and James were even alive. “A lot of other things too, I guess I'll just have to be re-taught everything, won't I?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The room fell back into silence, no one said anything and with the dull noises of the machines attached to Sirius, it sounded as if no one even breathed. It went on like this for a full ten more minutes, nothing happened, nothing changed, and Sirius felt extremely uncomfortably closed into this small room.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He didn't remember anything of this life, he didn't know this life. If that voice in his head were honest and real, he had taken a different Sirius' life. How could that be though? How could he just swap places with another version of himself?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The door opened though, causing Sirius to jump with the sudden influx of noise.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily walked across the room to sit in a vacant chair, and she started to speak with a smile on her face. “You can come home in two days if all your tests come back with good results. They want to keep you under surveillance for now, make sure you're not going to go back into a coma the next time you sleep.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius didn't understand what she really meant by tests but he took her word for it. He'd have to adjust to this life now, wouldn't he? Adjust to having Lily and James around again. Adjust to seeing Harry grow up. It couldn't be all bad, but he didn't really know how it could all go down. He wasn't sure if they would take to this version of Sirius. How would he adjust to this world though, there didn't seem to be magic around. . . There didn't seem to be much of anything from his real life.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius chanced a glance at her, realizing he hadn't said anything to what she clearly saw as good news.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Sorry, yeah, that sounds wonderful. Anything has to be better than this terrible bed.” His voice was much quieter than he had expected, but he didn't say anything else.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus moved back over the sit on the edge of the bed again, and thinking it was safe Harry followed. The kid was smiling as he pulled himself onto the bed, he looked much better than the harry he knew. He had those bright eyes his mother had, his face didn't look so torn with despair and fear, and he looked a bit heavier than Sirius could have ever imagined him being.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry sat with his small legs swinging over the edge of the little hospital bed. Sirius smiled at him and shifted about to sit up straight and look at the people around him. He hadn't felt so comfortable, even in awkward silence, not since they had all been together in one room. . . Even then, that last time, it hadn't been a pleasant one, nor had many before it, trying to keep Lily, James, and Harry safe.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I think we better head home for the evening, I've got to start some dinner for Harry.” Lily stood up and moved across the room to smile at Sirius and usher Harry off the bed and out the door.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James sighed, “Guess she's right, mate. Better than to upset her even if she isn't. You coming with us again Remus?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus nodded his head, “I'll be out in a moment.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Suit yourself,” said James, walking out the door behind his wife and son.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus moved on the bed and turned to give Sirius a proper hug. It was longer than any other hug Sirius had ever received from his own Remus, the two had always been awkward around any physical contact since their school days. This Remus seemed to feel a bit awkward too, pulling away from Sirius and looking down at the covers on the bed.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I'll be up here tomorrow evening some time, I can't take off work tomorrow. I've taken far too many days off lately.” Remus shrugged, but he was smiling as he looked up again at Sirius.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus pulled himself off the bed and looked around, shifting on his feet.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“See you tomorrow, Remus,” Sirius said with a half smile.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The two nodded to each other and Remus departed the hospital room. Sirius didn't sleep much that night, wracked with nightmares and constantly waking up in cold sweats.  </span>
