    <p>It had been Mustang’s hairbrained idea. Most things that ended with Ed in fuckin’ weird situations nowadays tended to be Mustang’s fault. </p><p>And this was, on a scale of One to Weird: <em> Pretty Goddamn Fuckin’ Weird, Roy, What The Fuck </em>. </p><p>Ed had died, fallen down a rabbit hole into a different universe, found their way back just in time to stop an invasion, went <em> back </em> down the rabbit hole in a way that was more of a saunter vaguely downward than it was a <em> fall </em> , learned an entirely new kind of science, and made it <em> back home </em>--</p><p>And this was still the weirdest shit.</p><p>Metal fingers clenched at the wooden desk they were leaning on; they could do this. They’d mastered alchemy and rocket science. They’d figured out dimensional travel -- situationally, anyways. They could teach first level alchemy to a bunch of teenage brats in weird clothes.</p><p>Supposedly.</p><p>As it were, they hadn’t done much in the way of teaching in the three minutes and seventeen seconds since the class was technically supposed to start. They’d just stood there, one leg crossed over the other, leaning so heavily on the desk that a lesser wood would have turned itself into paper just to end it’s suffering. </p><p>Glowering. </p><p>Fuckin’ hell, why couldn’t Mustang have picked Al? Al was good with kids. Al knew what to say to them. Al had a personality people <em> liked </em> and the ability to <em> connect </em>with people and a love for cats that witches and wizards should have, statistically, vibed with. </p><p>All Ed had was two metal limbs and a resting bitch face that could apparently keep a group of twenty teenagers silent for going on four whole minutes.</p><p>But Al had a <em> life </em>, independant from the Military and Ed was, unfortunately, still a dog on a leash. Though, under Mustang’s leadership the leash had gotten a hell of a lot longer; and being The Alchemist of The People had made theirs longer still. </p><p>That was also what had gotten them into this mess-- and it was a mess, make no mistake. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Bullshittery was a goddamn nightmare from the quick rundown they’d gotten on their way out of Amestris. </p><p>Four Defense teachers in as many years; the newest of whom was. Royally freaky. He had this <em> eye </em> and it wasn’t like Mustang’s fake eye where it was just… an eye. That looked like an eye, and acted like an eye and did <em> eye things </em> . Moody’s eye darted around and rolled back and could <em> see out of the back of his head </em>.</p><p>It just made Ed uneasy. </p><p>That and the sudden, inexplicable disappearance of Professor Dunkirk, the previous Alchemy teacher. Ed wasn’t exactly thrilled to be taking the place of a man who may have just been fucking <em> murdered </em>.</p><p>
  <em> “Well, that’s why you’ll be going,” Mustang had said, his fingers braced in front of his face, “I don’t like it any more than you do, but the headmaster specifically asked for a Amestranian alchemist and given the circumstances you’re the only one I trust to not fuck it all up or get themselves killed.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Ed had groaned their displeasure and flopped sideways onto that stupidly comfortable couch Mustang kept in his office for Definitely Not Naps, Fullmetal, Shut It Before I Write You Up For Insubordination.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “You could have denied the request,” they pointed out, blinking resignedly at the ceiling. The holes from that one time Havoc and Breda had tried to see who could make a pencil stay stuck the longest were still there. Ed counted thirty four.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Neither of them had been very good at the game. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> They didn’t have to look to know that Mustang’s expression had shifted into Politics and that they were Definitely Going To England. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Motherfucker. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “We could use the good will of a country beyond the wards,” Mustang said slowly, “it would do a lot to keep other countries here from trying to use the change in regime to try and, as you would so delicately put it, start shit.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “I want it on the record that I don’t like it,” they said. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Noted.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “And I refuse to teach the brats anything more than I knew at, I don’t know, eight or shit.” They’d survived human transmutation at eleven. Single digits seemed like the safest bet to avoid gratuitous property damage. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “That would be preferred,” Mustang agreed easily.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “I hate this.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “So you’ve said.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “And I also think that the headmaster isn’t telling you everything.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “On that we agree completely.” </em>
</p><p>Back in the present, they figured they should probably get the inevitable over with. </p><p>“Let’s get something straight,” they said, after four and a half minutes of complete silence and vaguely terrified, skirting glances, “my name is Ed, and if you call me Professor Elric I will barf on you.” </p><p>Scattered laughter.</p><p>Ed’s scowl deepened.</p><p>“That wasn’t a joke, but alright.” Ed shrugged and pushed up off of the desk, straightening the cuff of their shirt, “Do any of you actually know what alchemy even <em> is </em>, or did you just pick the class thinking it would be an easy pass.” </p><p>A small, dark skinned girl, seated between a boy with violently red hair and another with terrible round glasses, shot her hand into the air with such enthusiasm that she nearly knocked the offending spectacles right off the other child’s nose.</p><p>Ed pointed at her, “You. Um…” Shit. They hadn’t taken roll. Fuck. They did not know a single child’s name. Shit. Children all looked <em> alike </em>.  “Red tie.”</p><p>“Hermione Granger,” the girl answered, seemingly unphased that Ed hadn’t bothered to know who any of them were before beginning to ask questions, “Alchemy is the medieval forerunner of, what muggles call, chemistry, based on the supposed transformation of matter. It was concerned particularly with attempts to convert base metals into gold or to find a universal elixir--”</p><p>“Close, but no cigar,” Ed interrupted, though they made sure to keep their posture relaxed because Granger had the same look as Falman -- if Ed told her she was wrong she may just burst into tears and <em> fuck they were not equipped for that </em>, “You’ve got the base concepts, though considering England puts much more stock in magic than alchemy I’m not surprised.” She still looked a little wobbly around her mouth, “You did good,” Ed assured her quickly, lifting their hands in assurance, “Five points to.” What were the houses? “Red?” Hopefully magic was intuitive enough to figure shit out until Ed got the hang of it, “Amestranian alchemy is just… different.”</p><p>Shit. Fuck. Explanations on why Nicholas Flamel was a hack would probably not go down well in this country.</p><p>A demonstration maybe? Kids loved demonstrations. </p><p>“Watch,” they said, before clapping and slamming their hand into the wood of the desk. The familiar blue sparks played up their arm and tickled their cheek and the reality that they’d nearly lost it hit them like a brick to the gut. </p><p>When the light faded, the class let out a collective gasp; rising from the tabletop was a perfect recreation of the classroom -- every student included, with even a tiny Ed leaning on the desk.</p><p>“Alchemy,” they said, trying very hard not to sound as smug as they felt, “is a science, as Miss. Granger said. It is the science of understanding the composition of matter, deconstructing said matter, and then reassembling it.” One gloved hand gestured to the desk, “This is simple. I didn’t change the molecular construction of the wood, I simply reshaped it. If you actually pay attention, you may be able to do something similar by the end of the year.” </p><p>Instant outrage.</p><p>“The end of the year?” A blonde boy in a green striped tie shouted, rising from his seat. “That’s nonsense!”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Oh, hell to the fuck no. </p><p>“Sit down!” Ed barked, adjusting their stance minutely until they were every ounce the Lieutenant Colonel they were. To his minimal credit, the blonde boy sat down, “What is nonsense, Blondie,  is that you think <em> that </em>  horseshit is acceptable in any capacity; in a classroom setting or otherwise. Especially in <em> my </em>classroom.” They cast a glance around the rest of the room -- every student was sitting ramrod straight and stock still in their seats.</p><p>Granger’s eyes were wide as saucers.</p><p>Cool it, Elric.</p><p>Count to ten.</p><p>Blame the bastard for all of your problems. </p><p>Put the fear of Truth in these children.</p><p>“What are we? Thirty stories up?” They wandered to the window and peeked out, “Give or take.” They looked back to the class, “If I’d tried that shit with my alchemy teacher, do you know what she would have done? She’d have grabbed me by my hair and flung me out this window and expected me to figure out a way to survive the fall on my way down.”</p><p>Another gasp, this time: horrified. Even blondie shifted uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>“And we did it; me and my kid brother. Teacher once left us on a fuckin' island for a <em>month </em>and just. Fucked off. Came back to see if we figured shit out or died of starvation." The smile on their face was hard when they turned back to the loud kid, "How about you? What's your name?"</p><p>“Draco Malfoy,” the kid answered immediately, clearly trying to keep up his haughty facade of bullshit. Whatever. Ed was married to a haughty facade of bullshit. “You may have heard of my family.”</p><p>Ed’s eyebrows rose; “Can’t say I have,” they drawled, “and also, I don’t really care. I have had enough bullshit posturing to last me several lifetimes. I don’t care who your daddy is or who your daddy knows, and I don’t have to. The only thing I have to care about is whether you do your school work and don’t blow yourself up in the process. Which, right now, I'd kiss your eyebrows goodbye.” They squinted, "If you even have any. They kind of blend into your face, it's hard to tell."</p><p>Malfoy went slowly red with fury but didn't say anything else.</p><p>A mousy, round faced boy in a red tie raised his hand.</p><p>“Yes, Mr…?” They really should have taken roll.</p><p>“L-Longbottom, sir,” Ed hid a wince-- Mustang warned them that England was eons behind on gender politics -- “Uh. Neville. Neville Longbottom.”</p><p>Ed nodded, “You had a question?” They prodded when he didn’t seem inclined to continue.</p><p>“Y-yes. Um. When you say we could blow ourselves up…”</p><p>“Unlikely, but possible.” Ed admitted, “I’m not going to be teaching you anything overly complicated and while we may talk about it there will be no practical uses of combat alchemy in this class -- <em> do not start with me </em>-- you brats are bad enough with magic I’m not giving you the ability to light your classmates on fire by snapping.”</p><p>“Is <em> that </em> possible?” The redhead next to Granger asked, not bothering to raise his hand.</p><p>“Oh, totally,” Ed said, leaning back against the desk and tossing their braid back over their shoulder, “mind you it’s not <em> easy </em> and it takes planning and something to actually create the spark. You can’t create something out of nothing, with alchemy. If you’re double teaming it with magic it may be another story but since I’m not a magic user--”</p><p>“You’re a muggle?” Malfoy nearly shrieked.</p><p>Ed’s back stiffened. Right. Casual racism against non-magic folks. Mustang had mentioned that one too, hadn’t he? “I’m a non-magical person, yes,” they said, “but I don’t see how that would make a difference considering this is a <em> non-magical class. </em>”</p><p>There was absolutely no possible way for them to infuse <em> more </em>Shut The Fuck Up Or Else into their voice. Not even Scar could have pulled off a tone so stony.</p><p>And yet, Malfoy kept talking.</p><p>A vein in Ed's temple started throbbing.</p><p>“That’s ridiculous! A muggle! At Hogwarts! Is that even <em> allowed </em>?”</p><p>“Clearly it’s allowed,” the boy with the glasses snapped, “or else Elric wouldn’t be here.”</p><p>“Another five points to red,” Ed said, then quietly in Granger’s direction, “what is your house's name?”</p><p>“Gryffindor,” she whispered back, “green is Slytherin.”</p><p>“Five points to Gryffindor. Five points <em> from </em>Slytherin,” Ed said slightly louder, throwing a wink at Granger. If that got Gryffindor an extra five points, well, good. Granger had earned it for doing them a solid. “Now, where were we?”</p><p>The rest of the lesson, actually, went pretty smooth. A few Slytherin shaped hiccups, mostly in the form of Malfoy, that Ed shot down immediately. With their new rank had come subordinates they had to wrangle and a couple of teenagers was <em> nothing </em> compared to a bunch of rank-climbing, career-military suck-ups. </p><p>At the end of the hour, they sent the group away with a print out of the periodic table with strict directions to <em> learn it </em>if they ever wanted to do anything other than theory. Not that Ed would have minded theory -- Ed could talk alchemical theory all day, every day and not be bored. But they had a sneaking suspicion that the same could not be said for the children who had just left their classroom.</p><p>The moment the door shut behind the last brat -- Granger, who they supposed was the least bratty of the bunch-- Ed allowed themself to collapse into the chair behind their desk. There was about fifteen minutes before their second group arrived -- sixth year, mixed house if they recalled. Which, cool, they could learn what the fuck the two other colors were called.</p><p>But also, <em> ow </em>.</p><p>The first time they’d seen Hogwarts up close they’d marveled at the architecture and gaped at the sheer size of it. But a castle is a castle, magical or no, and it was drafty as <em> fuck </em> and their automail was not having a good time. </p><p>Ed rolled their metal shoulder, thinking especially rude thoughts about the staircases that thought it was funny to move when they were in the middle of using them. Mustang was going to pay for this. Possibly literally; at this rate they were going to have to ask Dumbledor for a… p… prat... No that’s an insult. Poooooo…..r….. Fuck. </p><p>The thing that jerked their stomach into next week and let them cross the wards with minimal fuss and maximum nausea.</p><p>They’d need one of <em> those </em>just to pay Winry a visit and see if she could do anything about their limbs before winter came and froze them off. Family Discount or no, Rockbell Automail was not cheap. That sounded like a problem for Mustang.</p><p>Ed looked up as the first student of their next period arrived -- first pair, actually. Both with flaming red hair. Ed’s eyes narrowed, “You two have a little brother?”</p>
