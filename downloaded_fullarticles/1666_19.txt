    <p>
  <span>When Church woke up he was very confused. Not because he seemed to be in a dark alleyway, not because a bunch of children were sleeping on the floor near him, not because he himself seemed to be a child, but because he wasn’t wearing his armour.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t in the body of a robot, or the body of some random man he never really knew. He was… In his own body.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He looked exactly like the director, with black hair and green eyes, the only difference being that he has no glasses and well… He was around five feet tall. At this realization Church finally started to get more confused about his situation, with y’know realizing he’s a child. He also noticed all the children around him are wearing robes and so is he, “Fuck, am I in a cult?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cult? What cult?” A voice groggily spoke as though they had just woken up which is very, very likely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Church quickly spun around to see who spoke only to see a young boy sitting tiredly on the floor with dark skin, dark brown hair and eyes with a pair of dark purple glasses sitting wonkily on his face, “Who the hell are you?! Are you part of this cult? Do you lead it? Did you kidnap me?!” Church quickly questioned as he pointedly pointed at the unknown boy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>These questions just seemed to confuse the boy more than anything, “First of all, you know me. I’m DuFresne.” The kid explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Church blinked, “I still have no clue who you are.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The kid, DuFresne, groaned at this, “I’m Doc.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A look of realization appeared on Church’s face as he spoke, “Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh. Y’know I never really did see you without your helmet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Doc simply ignored that as he stood up and straightened his glasses, “Well then, do you know how we got here because I certainly don’t, all I remember is having wine and cheese hour with Donut and suddenly I’m in a supposed cult!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Church was about to reply when Doc’s eyes suddenly widened in some type of shock/fear/whatever, “Did you hear that?!” Doc asked, startled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think it might’ve just been one of these cultists snoring.” Church responded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Doc seemed to calm down at that, but he still seemed quite disturbed by whatever he heard, “Y-yeah… It was probably someone snoring. Also we really shouldn’t make presumptions about these people, they might just be dressing up for Halloween!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s halloween?” Church questioned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Doc lowered his head at that, “Uh… No. It is not Halloween…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay then, we’re in a cult it’s practically confirmed.” Church stated as he looked at all the other sleeping cloaked children.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Doc seemed to flinch out of nowhere and look around him for some unknown thing, “Uh yeah, definitely a cult, also I’m leaving, like hell I’m being in the same cult as you, I’ll find my own cult thankyouverymuch.” Church said before he started to walk deeper into the dark alleyway leaving Doc standing alone by the sleeping possible cultists.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Doc awkwardly scratched his arm, “Uh… Maybe it’s a friendly cult?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s a cult?” A groggy voice spoke up from behind Doc that sounded quite similar to a very well known idiot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are we talking about cults?” Another voice spoke up tiredly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are there girls?” Yet another voice spoke up in a strange mix of tired and excited.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Doc blinked as he turned around, “Oh! It’s you guys! I knew it wasn’t a cult!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A boy with really dark skin, blue/green eyes and dreadlocks stared at Doc before looking over to the two other awake people, a tall kid with messy brown hair and blue eyes and a tall (but not that tall) boy with blonde hair, tons of scars and blue eyes. The dreadlock boy then screamed, “HOLY SHIT CHILDREN WE CHILDREN CHILDREN US WE ARE CHILDREN FUCK”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tucker! Calm down! You’ll wake up Carolina and she isn’t nice when she is tired.” The tall brunette kid stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tucker however did not listen as he stood up and decided to pace around screaming, it’s also at this time Doc realized the last no longer proven cultist sleeping is indeed Carolina, “Why aren’t you panicking Caboose?! We’re kids! This doesn’t make sense!” The blonde kid joined in on freaking out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah Washington, this makes perfect sense! You guys don’t know anything without me! We… Are… Dreaming!!” Caboose explained with a stupid grin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Doc saw Washington say something to Caboose, probably about how they are not dreaming at all and this is very real, but Doc couldn’t seem to hear anymore for some reason. He looked around uselessly as if there would be something on the brick walls beside him telling him why this was happening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello?” Doc tried to speak out, but he couldn’t hear himself and didn’t seem to be heard by anyone else.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi.” A deep voice spoke out loudly, seeming to echo endlessly in Doc’s head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Doc clutched his head in pain as the word echoed through his head, “O-O’malley?” he questioned the painful voice in his head before suddenly as though he were hit by a truck he could hear again, “-CHILDREN DO I HAVE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL NO I DON’T WANT TO LEARN ALGEBRA MISTER HARMON-” “This isn’t a dream Caboose!!” “I’ll pinch you to prove it!” “tHAT ISN’T HOW IT WORKS-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Doc stared wide-eyed at a really dirty brick wall before blinking and attempting to put himself back together, but fate had other plans, “ALL OF YOU </span>
  <em>
    <span>SHUT UP</span>
  </em>
  <span>!!!!!!” Carolina yelled as she stood up off the ground, this however sent Doc </span>
  <em>
    <span>to</span>
  </em>
  <span> the ground.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I understand we’re in an unknown situation but the first thing we do in an unknown situation is find out what the fuck the situtation is </span>
  <em>
    <span>then</span>
  </em>
  <span> freak out over it, or the preffered option, don’t freak out at all!!!” Carolina yelled some more as Doc struggled to get back up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I told you she’s not nice when she’s tired.” Caboose spoke up.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Church continued to walk down the alleyway until he saw light and in that light, was so many more cloaked children, but hey, at least these ones are awake.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But that’s when he felt something, something like a tug, trying to pull him back to where he just left. He flinched at this and noticed something in his cloak’s pocket, something glowing and he had just a hunch that it was this something trying to pull him back into the alley, although not physically, more mentally, the glowing thing wasn’t dragging him across the floor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He pulled out the glowing thing and it seemed to be some type of stick or something. It was glowing orange and seemed to look like maybe it was on fire…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> “oh HOLY </span>
  <em>
    <span>SHIT</span>
  </em>
  <span>!!!!” Church quickly dropped the thing and backed away, staring at it like it’s a cursed object that nearly killed him, which is pretty much true</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Church ignored all the weird looks he got from people walking past as he pushed it a little with his foot to see if it was dangerous even though he was just previously holding it, “Oh god I better be wrong about this.” He said as he carefully picked the stick back up only to get a slight surge of anger from the wand, “Oh fuck you too Sigma.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The stick seemed to crackle at that comment nearly causing Church to nearly drop it before giving it a glare, “Okay, I don’t know for sure whether I’m the Alpha or Epsilon right now but either way we’re related and you’re going to respect me, okay? You are a stick thing right now Sigma I can snap you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sigma stick seemed to glow less at that and Church took that as what might be an ‘okay’ as he put the stick back in the cult cloak.</span>
