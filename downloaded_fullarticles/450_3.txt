  <span>Harry came back from training. He was training to be a healer. All the death made him want to heal. As soon as he entered his living room he heard some noises coming from his bedroom. It confused and alarmed him since he lived alone. His two best friends were busy. Hermione would still be at work. She was an unspeakable. Ron was in auror training and from what he heard was already asleep from it. His girlfriend wouldn't be there since she had team practice and didn't live with him. Plus no one but him had ever been in his room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He grabbed his wand and went to his room. He wished he hadn't opened the door because the sight before him was shocking and horrifying. There on his bed was his girlfriend and fellow beta being pounded into the mattress by beta Roger Davis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck?!” Harry exclaimed in shock, anger, and hurt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry?!” The two broke apart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I…” Harry looked at the two before sighing. “Get out of my house.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But Harry-” She began to protest only to be cut off by said person.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Out.” He hissed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You'll regret this.” The red head replied tearfully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No you will.” He vowed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“P-potter?” Davis stuttered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Harry gave him an angry look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Before I...I leave I need to know a few things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You do, do you?” Harry asked dryly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” Davis swallowed before continuing. “Ginny told me that you two broke up a month ago. It was mutual and you were keeping it quiet due to your history with the newspaper. She also told me she bought this house with her reward money.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She did?” Harry looked at the former Ravenclaw in shock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. That's why I asked her out a couple weeks ago. I thought she was single.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Last I knew we were together and happy. I bought this house to get away from the reporters.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Um I'm so sorry Potter. I really thought she was single.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry closed his eyes. “No. You're not the one who should be apologizing. You are a victim just like me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Once you are dressed please leave.” Harry sounded so tired and betrayed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Davis finished getting dressed and left. Harry went to the living room and called Hermione. He was lucky she had gotten off work so she answered the call. She rushed over when she heard the pain in his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh Harry what's wrong?” His face was blank.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please gather Ginerva’s things that she left here and take them to her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The female beta looked confused. “What? Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She and I broke up.” He answered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What silly thing caused it this time?” Last time it was due to conflicting schedules.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry's face darkened. “Me finding her and her lover fucking on my bed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione gasped in shock before looking angry. “She did what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed sadly. He then explained what happened. He started from him coming home to Davis leaving.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh Harry I...I am so sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just get her things out of here.” He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry walked off to his bedroom. Hermione figured it was to remove the bedding. Hermione summoned Ginny’s belongings. Luckily it was only stuff Ginny had left whenever she hung out at the house with Harry. Hermione put them into a box. Once done she said goodbye to Harry and left. The witch went to the Burrow. She was going to confront the cheating whore. </span>
