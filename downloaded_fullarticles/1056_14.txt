    <p>He should've stayed up long enough to hear her cry that night. He was none the wiser but he had thought everything was dandy and swell. At Least it had been when she confided in him that she wanted a child. Her sweet smile as she sat on his lap looking suggestive. Sure she seemed hesitant when the time for him to finish had come. But they had spent three years-two during their school years- making sure they knew(/performed) the necessary spells to block that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He hadn't expected it so early; no, not with Lily's career aspirations. She wanted to travel and make her own way before a kid could do it for her. She wanted life and James was sure to give it to her. He stood by her even through his parents' less than pleased looks. If she wanted to wait, he would too! They were young 20-year-olds and needed time to sort their life out, time to decide when to get married and when to give another heir to the bloodline.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But James's mother had other ideas when it came to that. And she wasn't afraid to make her ideas known to Lily. Although they were never directly aimed at her,  Lily knew when she received a jab.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She would receive distasteful looks at any given moment. Most aimed at her appearance, or rather lack of. Like when she had once again shown up to dinner wearing a flowy dress that was tight against her soft, ample stomach. No hardness to her stomach where something should have been enclosed. No added weight to make her sore in her heels or swollen in her ankles and baited in her breath. No, she had shown up once again as Lily Potter and the only thing she carried with her was a purse.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Lillian.. so nice to see you” Lily knew Mrs Potter didn't mean it. Especially as the night went on and less and less kind words made it her way.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Oh, we're quite disappointed no one else could join....When do you two love birds plan to give me a grandchild? I won't stay alive forever!" Mrs Potter would say accompanied by a joyous laugh and a joking tone. But as she made eye contact after each statement Lily knew it was more a threat than a joke. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She often found herself brushing it off and laughing along. Meeting the gaze and smiling because she knew James wouldn't force her, even if  his mother begged him too. They were safe in their own little bubble of understanding. But Lily wasn't as headstrong as she'd like to think. Lily never missed an opportunity to beat herself up anytime someone mentioned something about her being less than desirable. She was gullible and fell victim to her insecurities more often than she didn't. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>So what if she finally gave in to make someone who wasn't even herself happy. She just couldn't stand not being liked! Couldn't stand it when she was called dumb for being muggle-born. She had thought that was why she was being ignored and avoided by other students.  Sure, she had later found that they ignored her because of their own bigoted beliefs, but that didn't stop her. So she aimed for high marks all the school year and made herself known as a member of the slug society.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When Petunia would ignore her and look down upon her Lily  had sent her money for her first house. She had sent tons of gifts for her newborn nephew. She still wrote every Wednesday to inquire on how she'd been doing.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily only received one reply that had several nasty words. But it's more than she'd ever had before, so she'd smiled and counted it as a win. Just as she did when Mrs. Potter jumped from her seat to greet her. When she offered her tea in the tea room or  a stroll through the gardens. Lily counted the new kindness as a necessary step to take towards a better environment. She was as happy as ever whenever they were invited to dinner. Lily was happy spending lunches deciding on color schemes, middle names, bed sheets, birth options and finances. She was even happy revisiting the topics when someone had shot her ideas down. Yes, she was happier now as she stroked an onesie on Sale in a muggle shop.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She hardly noticed through her haze as an employee made his way up to her and asked “do you need help ma'am?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Startled she answered “No i-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>------</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“-never wanted a child James!” she screamed as the tears ran down her cheeks. They stood in the living room only a coffee table between them as they went at it. They were having dinner when deciding on what show to watch turned into fuck you’s. It was so sudden that James didn't know whether or not it was because he suggested a action movie.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“ It's not my fault you let her pressure you, lily! You didn't even tell me she was doing this!"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Of course I didn't want to paint your perfect mother in a bad way" She hissed.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>" Then how on earth am I supposed to know what's going on if you don't  bloody tell me!” James said frustrated as he dragged his hand roughly through his hair. His eyes were angry as he gazed at his fiancée.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“you would’ve brushed it off like you do everything else!” Lily accused him screaming. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“ I never brush you off-”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re trying to brush it off Again! When was the last time you actually gave a damn about my work?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“We talk about your work everyday Lil’s how can I not give a fuck” James said through clenched teeth.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“ don’t lie! all you say is-” she slouched and jutted her  arms in a masculine way."-uh huh, yeah, that's nice, love you, you know. I'm absolutely fascinated by what you're talking about but the lads are waiting at the bar!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James clenched his jaw ready to rebute her but lily  started going off on a tangent. “ You only get drunk now with that dog, Remus. You’re at those bars so much, I'm starting to think that maybe it's not only the alcohol that keeps you there at night.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She began going off on how left out she felt, how lonely she was waiting at the doctor's office alone. How so much food was wasted as she sat waiting for the fireplace to reveal him. That she felt  he put everything and everyone before her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And don’t get me started on that job of yours” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, sod off! I work my arse off; it's not my fault you don’t move your ass. If you want friends go make some no one's stopping you, lily. And God, stop acting as if I'm putting a hold on your career! You probably weren’t gonna get it anyway...not with that stom-” An echo went through the loft as Lily's hand came in contact with his cheek. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A tear made its way down her cheek as she looked at him. He knew what she'd given up...he knew. Yet he had made it seem as if this was once again her fault. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James tensed his jaw and flexed his fingers that rested  at his side. “ you're not getting rid of my child, Lily”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It seemed like days watching her stand there broken and in tears. It wasnt until 3 minutes later that She shook her head in agreement as she left to the bedroom. James clenched the remote in his hand before he lashed out and threw it at the opposite wall. The only sound in his world of silence.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>-----</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Their days filled with it, as no words were spoken. Only the  shuffling of feet and the friction of garments on skin. As weeks passed they started sharing sad smiles and simple nods. Lily opted for going to bed by the time he returned from having bottles with Sirius. She stopped cooking for two when he and Remus went on a practice mission for work. They no longer talked, they didn’t cuddle or touch because Lily knew  he was no longer only hers.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sometimes she would softly kiss his cheek when she saw the cocky and brilliant James Potter that caught a snitch for her. The James that bought the stupidest of muggle things in order to make her feel at home. The one that declared his undying love to her in front of the great hall. But that image would fade with each kiss.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The last one he got was  5 months later as she stepped through the threshold to gather the last of her bags. It hurt her not to look towards the nursery, but it hurt her more watching James let her go. But James was in no mood to care about how she felt, she had made her decision. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>If it had to be just Harry and him, then so be it. She'd already made her decision. They were the victims here. It was him who had gotten the short end of the stick, he'd had to put a hold on his training to take care of Harry. He had to suffer through managing laundry and feeding the boy. It was he who woke up every.single.night. Sometimes nothing would be wrong but the little brat would still cry. He would screech and wiggle  causing his neighbors to bang angrily at the door. There were bags under his eyes and headaches even hard liquor couldn’t soothe. So was he at fault if one day he simply ignored it all? Just left the house for a drink to return and find the kid cried himself to sleep. It was horrible of him to do so but it gave him more time to get his life back. All he had to do was mutter a Silencio or snatch one of the manor elves. Life was good again for once until his parents had questioned the elf on its absence during his duty.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He remembered Remus scolding him about it once, how he was borderline abusing the kid.  Remus was headstrong on making sure Harry was taken care of. But when he would force himself to hold the child he could only do it for no longer than 4 seconds, that scratchy feeling surrounding him once again. Moony just wasn’t clicking with the boy and would often refuse to enter the loft if Harry was out of his nursery. Harry soon turned into the dog you had to keep in the bathroom when you had a guest. One could laugh at how ironic it was, guarding the beast from the baby.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius wasn’t much different, he often was the one to pull James away. He was James's main reason for bar bathroom quickies. Sirius didn’t and never wanted to understand what it meant to be a father. He was too immature and party wild, the same way he had been for all his years. He was there to be a best friend, to make sure James got laid and had a nice buzz. Sirius also followed his friends' lead, much as Peter had done. Meaning their friends were his, and their enemies were the bain of his existence -including babies. If Remus and James didn’t like the boy, he wouldn't either in their place. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But then he met Haley, a squib parent who used to live down the hall. She would come and shut the little brat up most times. Most of her time in the loft, however,  was spent in James’s bed. It remained like that for days on end, even months later when she moved to a different residence. He would see her every weekday sometimes on weekends too, if he was feeling bored. The days without her were spent with Harry, some days he would force himself to get up and change the little bugger. Some days he couldn’t be bothered and simply let him cry himself to sleep once more. But as long as Haley was there James knew the child wouldn't die on his hands so he couldn’t care less.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Get the kid won't you, doll?” James said tucking his prick back into his pants. He was sitting in the living room on the worn couch as he stretched his arms with a yawn.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“sure but I mean it when I say this is the last time,” the cougar said pulling her hair into a ponytail. She was at least benching 47 but she had the body of a 30-year-old footie mom. She was easy and more or less decent in terms of her “second employment”. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“ Oh come on, it's just a little fun,” James said crawling up to her on the couch. He dipped his hand under the blanket with a smile.  “ just the same fun we have. You can’t blame Sirius for giving in! From what he told me they were practically begging for it”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She looked genuinely affronted as she lifted herself from his advances. “ These are my children you refer to. When I took this shit job I didn't expect your pervert of a friend to finesse my children into bed with him!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“ Here we go” James sighed annoyed as he rolled his eyes and leaned back on the couch. He didn’t think she’d get this pissed about it. Sirius had mentioned it to him before his little rendezvous with her own twins. He didn’t really care however seeing the twins were 18 and able to do whatever the fuck they well pleased. But Haley still found some way to paint that as bad and throw a hissy fit.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“ You know what, kid? Fuck you!” she yelled making her way to the front door.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“ You weren't calling me that when you were on my pr-” he was cut off by the slam or the front door closing. He flinched as he waited a few seconds to hear whether or not it had woken the boy. When 20 seconds  passed he sank into the couch with relief.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Than a choked cry broke out.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James grunted in frustration before getting up and angrily walking to the annoying little shit's room. He didn't even open to check on the boy before he was firing an aggressive Silencio at the hardwood. When the cries instantly drowned out he made his way to the kitchen area where he picked up one the many half-empty alcohol bottles.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He had better things to do.</span>
</p>
