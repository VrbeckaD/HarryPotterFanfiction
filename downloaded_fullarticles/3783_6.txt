<p>It's not the first time you've seen her, heavens no, because she's smirking at you with a lover's familiarity—which you know is a right and wrong description, because she's one <em>hell</em> of a snogger but she was more interested in haggling a discount on your Quidditch wares than anything else.</p>
<p>She's Potter's kid, yeah, and that your conscience manages to brush off, but the freckles and blue eyes (okay, they're teal, so sue you; you know Quidditch, not art) reek of <em>Weasley</em> to you and you can't help hearing two words echo in your brain: wrong &amp; idiotic &amp; <span>wrong_&amp;_idiotic</span> &amp; <em>wrong &amp; idiotic </em>&amp; <em><strong>wrong &amp; idiotic</strong></em>, goddammit, because Weasleys are really just—AGH!</p>
<p>Lily Luna Potter watches you, and you know she sees your internal struggle, because she's oh-so clever like her father, and her smirk's widened <em>just this much</em>, and, dear Merlin, how bad is it that you know her intimately enough to <em>know</em> what her different sizes of smirks <em>mean</em>?</p>
<p>As she slides the Galleons and Sickles across the counter to pay for the new broom-cleaning kit, her fingers rest on your hand and her smirk softens just a <em>smidge</em>. Oh. …apparently not even <em>she's </em>clever enough to keep her heart out of a deal.</p></div>
