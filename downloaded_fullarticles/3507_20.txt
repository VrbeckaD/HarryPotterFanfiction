    <p align="justify">
  <span>       Spring mornings were like a dream on the Malis farm, with picturesque, golden hour sunrises, morning dew that caused the grass and flowers to shimmer in the first rays of sunlight, and nothing but the quiet, melodic chirping of the dotterels to provide a calming symphony for all who were lucky enough to experience it. Keanu Malis described his farm as his little piece of heaven on earth, a comment that surprised pretty much everyone who knew him. As a pilot in the Royal Air Force, his friends would always joke that he could hardly spend two minutes on the ground, but on that farm in the Scottish Highlands with his family, Keanu was happy to stay grounded forever. Most mornings, he spent outside, tending to the grounds and livestock, or fixing up his mock Clutton-Tabenor FRED that he made with his brothers shortly after the end of the second World War. But Sundays were different. Sundays were for sleep.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       “Del,” whispered a young girl as she gently shook her younger sister awake. “Delphi, let’s go explore.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       Unlike their parents, Delaney and Delphi Malis awoke early most Sunday mornings, giving themselves the time to partake in their favorite pastime, exploring the grounds of their family farm. With a note to their parents on the kitchen table assuring that they would be back before lunchtime, the Malis girls were off.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       Delaney, the older of the two, led the way as she normally did. Delphi, tired, but happy to be there, walked closely behind her sister, noticing and fixating on a couple strands of soft brown hair that their mother had missed when braiding Delaney’s hair the previous night. She failed to notice until they were on the edge of their property, however, that her sister was about to break their parent’s number one rule, and as soon as she noticed this, she stopped in her tracks.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       “Are we going in there?” the eight year old asked fearfully, pointing to the daunting forest that bordered their property. Her sister turned back to her with a mischievous smile, but she didn’t say anything, and she didn’t stop her trek to the forest. “Delaney, it’s forbidden! Mum and Dad will be mad!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       “Mum and Dad won’t know,” said Delaney, turning to look at her sister once more, “will they?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       Delphi was silent for a moment, knowing that she was now sworn to never tell her parents about the forest, no matter if she followed her sister or not. “But what about the creatures?” she frantically added after a moment. “Remember what Dad said about the scary creatures in there? What if one of them finds us?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       “There are no creatures in there, Delphi,” answered Delaney, somehow sounding both reassuring and impatient. “Dad makes those all up to scare us into not going into the forest. There are no werewolves or giant spiders. It’s perfectly safe, Del, I promise.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       “I don’t know,” Delphi trailed off, turning to look back to their farm. She knew her parents were probably still asleep, and in that moment, she thought about going back to join them.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       “Come on Delphi, live a little. What’s life without a little risk?” It was then that two sisters met eyes, their almost identical brown eyes communicating a silent argument that Delaney seemed to always win. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       “Alright.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       Nearly an hour later, the sun was well above the horizon, but the Malis girls could hardly tell under the thickness of the forest. The adventure had been a fun one, to Delphi’s surprise, and just as Delaney had said, the sisters had come across none of the scary creatures that their father had told them about. There was one point that Delphi thought she saw a creature that was half man, half horse, watching them from a distance, but after a second glance, Delphi decided that it was only her imagination, as the curious creature seemed to disappear.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       Delphi had just jumped over a fallen log when she bumped into her sister’s back. She looked where Delaney was looking, curious to know why she suddenly stopped. “What is it?” Delphi asked.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       Delaney pointed to a clearing in the trees where you could see the sky poking through, and with little further information, Delphi understood. There, beyond the tops of the trees, was what looked to be an old, mouldering ruin. Many would see it as ugly, or at least think it to be so unsafe that it would not be worth the risk, but the Malis girls only saw the beauty of it. The beauty, and the mystery.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       The two walked forward, and with each step, the view of the ruin became increasingly beautiful in the morning spring light, but suddenly, as if with the blink of an eye, the image before Delphi Malis changed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       What stood in front of her was not the mouldering ruin that her sister saw, but a beautiful, elegant castle, with tall towers, and smooth stone walls. It was like magic.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       Delphi blinked again, not believing what she saw, and found that each time she opened and closed her eyes, the image before her changed, morphing from a ruin into a castle, and then back again, like there was something not connecting in her brain.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       Delaney realized what was happening before her sister did, as she was very accustomed to the signs of a seizure, almost to the point that she could know when her sister would come down with one before it even happened. After all, Delphi had been living with epilepsy for her entire life.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       What Delaney didn’t know was that this time was different. This time was so very different.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       “Oh no,” Delaney cried, managing to catch her sister as she began to fall back and seize. “Oh no, no, no! I never should have brought you out here.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       But Delphi couldn’t hear her anymore. Normally, Delphi would come out of her seizures with no memory of the action itself, but that was not the case this time, and that would cease to be the case for the rest of her life.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       <em>“Expelliarmus!”</em> she heard, suddenly seeing a small room in a large tower, two figures, and two floating brooms taking up the space. Her vision was a bit cloudy, but she knew what she saw. Nothing could change that.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       One of the figures was an old man, older than any she’d ever seen, who was very pale, but appeared to be extremely calm in what appeared to be a highly stressful situation. He stood alone beside a railing, nothing but darkness and an odd, green cloud behind him. On the other side of the room, beside what looked to be the top of a staircase, stood a young blonde boy, one who couldn’t be any older than seventeen. Delphi took note of the wooden stick in his hand, that he held like a knight would hold a sword, aiming it at the old man.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       “Good evening, Draco,” said the old man.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       Delphi was seizing violently, more violently than Delaney had ever seen before, and as she watched her baby sister, she began to cry. Delphi’s eyes were wide open, staring intently at what Delaney believed to be a ruin.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       “Draco, Draco, you are not a killer,” spoke the old man. Delphi, a helpless, trapped witness, gave everything in that moment to be back with her parents in their heaven-like farmhouse, sound asleep, as she should have been on the beautiful Sunday morning. She did not want to see if Draco was a killer.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       “How do you know?” the boy, Draco, said at once. “You don’t know what I’m capable of. You don’t know what I’ve done!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       “Delphi,” Delaney cried, overwhelmed, guilty, and terrified for her sister, who would not stop her seizure. This was the longest she had ever been under.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       “I can help you, Draco,” spoke the old man. Somehow, the man remained calm. Delphi quickly understood that while the boy had what she could only assume to be the weapon, it was the old man who had the upper hand, the old man who had control.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       “No, you can’t,” answered Draco, his weapon shaky in his hands. “Nobody can. He told me to do it or he’ll kill me. I’ve got no choice.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       The old man looked sympathetically at Draco, as if he was truly sorrowful that he had been caught up in all this killing. “I can protect you.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       Draco shook his head. “No,” he said. A darkness overtook his features. “No one can.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       He said something that Delphi couldn’t quite understand, something like </span>
  <em>
    <span>abra cadabra, </span>
  </em>
  <span>and she looked back to the old man just in time to see a flash of green light knock him from the tower and into the darkness that surrounded him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>       “Delphi!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Delaney was almost screaming when Delphi finally came to.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       Her eyes were still intently fixated on the distant ruin that had started this entire thing, but she saw it as it actually was. Delphi Malis saw what was known as the Hogwarts Castle, and there, in the tallest tower, she could just barely make out the figure of a person, of an old man. She knew, then. She knew that the man she saw in the castle was the man she had just watched die.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>       She blinked rapidly a couple of times, and only saw the ruins.</span>
