  <b> <em>AHEM. </em></b>
</p><p>You’re pressed to a wall, and you can feel his hot breath on your face. You make no attempt to resist him, but you fall into him eagerly. Your kisses are slow and deliberate, and you only pull away to breathe. He takes your hips and you arch your back so you can feel your hearts beating as one. When you pull apart, he presses his forehead to yours, gasping for air. His thumb brushes a strand of hair behind your ear. </p><p> </p><p>“Kit…” </p><p> </p><p>You open your eyes to study him. “I want to cleanse Lockhart’s taint of you.” he says.</p><p> </p><p><em> Cleanse Lockhart’s taint of me…? Is he asking… </em>You feel your body heat up. You study his expression. His face is slightly pink. He clarifies what he means. </p><p> </p><p>“May I have sex with you?” he asks. You smile softly, cheeks going hot. You nod your head and you go in to kiss him, briefly running your hand across the front of his trousers while you deepen it.  </p><p> </p><p>“I’d love to make love with you.” you reply, gazing warmly at him. His eyes slowly narrow, and he goes in for another kiss. You wrap your arms around his neck and fall into him. He kisses your jaw, and your neck, and then lifts you to straddle his hips. While your lips move together, he carries you over to his bed, only tearing you from him to throw you down onto it. He climbs on top of you. He holds you down by your wrists. He captures your mouth in his again, and then starts to go for your jumper.  </p><p> </p><p>You go stiff beneath him, and he immediately stops and pulls himself up, his dark gaze piercing you. </p><p>  </p><p>“Severus, wait…” you gasp, “Please, be gentle with me…” </p><p> </p><p>His gaze softens and he leans down, his lips brushing yours when he speaks, “I will be.” Your face flushes in the dim light of the oil lamp. You sit back up for a moment. You cup his cheeks and kiss him chastely. You take off your jumper and cast it aside, and he puts his hair up before pushing you back down.   </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">-xXx-</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Breathy sighs and moans accompanied by soft suckling sounds fill the quiet air. His tongue and teeth press into your soft, salty skin to mark your neck as his. You bend and curl into him as he tastes you. Your fingers grasp his neck and tangle in his hair to keep him at your sweet spot. Soon, two pairs of hips are thrusting and grinding together with slow and deliberate movements, as he fills you with love.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>In the summer of 1994, the old house at Spinner's End was full of nightly sovereigns of sighs and groans. It's proof that a new couple in their honeymoon phase is living there. </p><p> </p><p>If someone were to be invited there for dinner, they'd be greeted by a petite figure with a fondness for yellow. Once they got inside, they'd step inside to a quaint and tidy little house, with a record player near the sofa and a vase of sunflowers on the table. The kitchen is usually cluttered and untidy, and often occupied by a stoic and sullen man in all black. </p><p> </p><p>If the guest is led inside and offered refreshments, they'd see him there. He won't turn to greet them unless his partner tells him first that the guests have arrived. Although the couple doesn't usually host guests.</p><p> </p><p>The man in black finds it unappealing. His lover likes guests though. But the lover is perfectly fine with just the two of them and the pets: The tuxedo cat, and the barn owl with mismatched eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Although, summer is drawing to a close, so they won't be at Spinner's End much longer. They'll have to go back to work, you see, to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The lover wishes that things didn't have to change. But the man tells his lover that nothing can ever stay the same. </p><p> </p><p><em> Pity. </em> You, the Lover, thinks, <em> I wish it could stay like this... </em></p><p align="center">-xXx-</p><p>After much convincing, you’d managed to get Severus to buy a freaking phone so that you could communicate with some of your friends in the Muggle world. Except…between keeping house together, learning how to cook, cultivating your potion skills, working you part-time gig, and having plenty of wonderful sex, you’d kind of forgotten to use it.    </p><p> </p><p>One late morning, the screaming telephone signal wakes you up. You sit up in bed, keeping yourself covered with the blanket. You groan. </p><p> </p><p>You answer the phone, “Hello? This is the Snape residence--” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “KIT LAUREL OAKLEY WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN!?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>You wince, “Christ, Renee! You’re going to blow out my eardrum!” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “We’ve been trying to contact you since June! It’s the middle of August! Do you have any idea how worried we’ve all been about you? Not a phone call, or any letters! We missed your birthday!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I can assure you I’m completely fine. Wonderful even. Choosing not to go back to my house this summer was the best decision I ever made.” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I agree you needed to get out but that isn’t the point I’m making here! We’re all worried, and we’re all supposed to go to the Quidditch World Cup! Where are you!? This isn’t like you to be so irresponsible.”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve been at Spinner’s End. Severus has a house here and he invited me to spend the summer with him.” you say, “We’re together now, you see.” </p><p> </p><p><em> “WHAT!?” </em> you hear another voice on the phone. </p><p> </p><p>“<em> I’m your best friend and you didn’t tell me!?” </em> says another.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! Hello Eliza, Stella. I know, I’m sorry, I just…I was so excited that it just sort of…slipped my mind…we’ve been spending every moment together…except when I go to work, that is.” (You were working at a coffee shop nearby.) </p><p> </p><p>Eliza huffs, <em> “I wish you would have told us sooner, you dumbass. But it’s good to know you’re okay. Is he treating you well?”  </em></p><p> </p><p>You’re about to answer when you hear a quiet “Hmm.” From underneath the covers. You feel bare arms wrap around your middle and a nuzzle against your naked chest. You giggle when his breath and hair tickle your skin. </p><p> </p><p>“Ah—Severus…” you chuckle, “Stop, I’m on phone…” </p><p> </p><p>His response is a sleepy hum. </p><p> </p><p>“Ahem. Yes, it’s going wonderfully.” you reply, “I’m so sorry I’ve been so absent, shall we go for a spot of lunch? Tea? Coffee?” </p><p> </p><p><em> “I mean, we could probably meet in like the next hour or less if you can stop shagging each other for one second.” </em> Stella teases.   <em>    </em></p><p> </p><p><em> “Stella!” </em> Renee exclaims, <em> “You can’t just mention that so loudly and casually!” </em> Eliza sniggers on the other end. </p><p> </p><p><em> “What? It’s perfectly normal and natural behavior.” </em> she replies. <em>   </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “But, it’s private.”   </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> “Aww, poor Renee…” </em> Eliza coos, <em> “She’s embarrassed.” </em> </p><p> </p><p>You clear your throat to get their attention, “The next hour? Sure. I can do that. Severus and I weren’t planning on doing much today, anyway.”  </p><p> </p><p><em> “Ya gonna be able to survive being apart for like two or three hours?” </em> Eliza teases. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, we’ll be absolutely fine.” you say, <em> “ </em> Anyway. I’ll see you in like an hour or so, then. Bye for now! Love you~” <em>   </em></p><p>
  <em>   </em>
</p><p><em> “We love you!” </em> says the chorus on the other end. You hang up the phone and set it back on the stand. You roll your eyes and shake your head, chuckling with amusement. You feel movement on top of you again. You look down. Severus is grasping around your middle and looking at you with his deep eyes, studying you intensely. He’s awake at last. You smile and ruffle his hair. </p><p> </p><p>“Good morning.” you say, “I’m going out with my friends in a bit.”</p><p> </p><p>“And I do hope you enjoy yourself, but you’re not leaving without giving me what I want first…” he adjusts himself and goes in to kiss you, but he’s cut off when a shameless, furry body lands right in between you and mewls. He glares at the interruption and you laugh. </p><p> </p><p>“Lily, you silly~” you say, looking at the cat. She purrs. Then you hear a scream from your side of the bed. You turn to see a barn owl puffing his chest and flapping his wings from his perch. </p><p> </p><p>“I swear if that bird doesn’t learn to shut it…” Snape mutters lowly.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! Jareth and Lily are just hungry. They’ll leave us alone as soon as they’ve been fed.”  You shoo the cat, from between the two of you. She darts out and sits on the bed, staring at you and flicking her tail, watching your movements closely. “Mwah~” you peck Severus on the nose, and he pulls his body from on top of yours so you can get up. You walk across the bedroom and grab his old Slytherin robes from the hook on the rack. You put them on and button the bare minimum of buttons to cover yourself, and then you put out an arm for Jareth to hop onto, before you make your way into the living space with Lily at your heels. </p><p> </p><p>After that, you have time to make sweet morning love, and to take a quick shower, before you leave to meet your friends.  </p><p align="center">-xXx-</p><p>You have a fun and light-hearted get-together, and you return home with two tickets to the Quidditch World Cup final. </p><p> </p><p>“Severus! Look what my friends sent home with me!” you toss the tickets on the dining room table, “You’ll come, won’t you?” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, if the tickets have already been bought, it would be a waste if I didn’t.” he says. </p><p> </p><p><em> A simple ‘yes’ would have sufficed, darling. </em>  </p><p> </p><p>“Wonderful! This is so exciting I can’t wait!” you say, “Do you remember my friend, Damocoles Smith?” </p><p> </p><p>“You mean the one with the ego the size of a house that could never keep his mouth shut, never listened, and always had to have the last word? The one that constantly was an insufferable arse that would say things just to get under your skin? Oh yes, I remember him. The number of points I took from Ravenclaw because of that boy…” </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Sev. Him.” you say, “Well, although he might be in a wheelchair, that man can ride a broom! He was one of the best beaters the Ravenclaw quidditch team has ever seen, and now he plays professionally. He plays for the Ireland team!” </p><p> </p><p>“Let’s hope he doesn’t embarrass himself, then.” he scoffs. </p><p> </p><p>“Sev!” you groan, “I guarantee you that he won’t. He’s far too skilled for that!” </p><p> </p><p>“Even the best make mistakes, isn’t that what you told me just last year?” he asks. </p><p> </p><p>“Why you—you are just…” you feel yourself getting flustered, “Now you’re just being ornery!”</p><p> </p><p>“Obviously. That’s <em> only </em> one of my defining personality traits,” he says. </p><p> </p><p>“I <em> know </em>that! And sometimes it makes me wonder why I even put up with you. Hmph.” You toss your hair for emphasized sass. </p><p> </p><p>He stands up from his chair and leans over the table, you mirror him, “Oh please.” he purrs, “It’s because you can’t get enough of me.” he smirks. His lips brush your ear, and his hot breath heats up your face “...You practically <em> beg </em> me to undress and get on top of you every night.” He purrs. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, now you just…shut it!” you exclaim, feeling the familiar hot rush set over you again, “You vulgar brute!”</p><p> </p><p>He places his fingers under your jaw, “Don’t try to deny it.” </p><p> </p><p>You chuckle breathily, and close your eyes halfway, and lean in, but right before your lips touch, your index finger boops his nose. He blinks and stops in his tracks. You pull away from him and start to leave the dinner table. You walk to the middle of the room, and turn around, you place your hands on your hips, grin over your shoulder, and wiggle teasingly, “If you want to undress me, you have to catch me!” you sing-song. And then you’re giggling childishly and disappearing down the hallway.  </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I’m the ornery one, now, am I!?” he calls after you, “How dare you “boop” my nose! Come back here!”  </p><p> </p><p>“What are you going to do to punish me, then, hmm? Take away house points? Or how about articles of clothing?” you ask.  </p><p> </p><p>“Why you—” </p><p> </p><p>“Severus~” you sing-song, “Come <em> play </em> with me!”  There’s a creak of springs when you hop up onto the bed, pose there, and wait. You hear him coming down the hall, he appears in the doorway. He crosses towards you, and tries to wrestle you to the mattress, but you roll away from him. A fleeting ‘chase’ occurs, before he pins you. Your sides heave as he bends over you.  </p><p> </p><p>“I’ve got you, you little brat.” he says, and then bites the sweet spot on your neck. </p><p> </p><p>“Ahh!” you squeal.</p><p> </p><p>You feel the warm moistness of his lips against your flushed skin, and you giggle breathily.</p><p> </p><p>When he pulls away, he captures your mouth for a steamy kiss, his hands traveling under the hem of your jumper. </p><hr/><p align="center">        -xXx-</p><p> Before you know it, you’re off to Dartmoor for the final. The match is between Ireland and Bulgaria. You’re carrying a worn handbag that’s bigger on the inside, carrying what little possessions you need for the short sojourn in Mr. Roger’s Campsite.  You’d lost the case you pleaded to stay in the hotel, because the rest of your friends would rather stay in a magic tent than spend more than twice as much for a cramped hotel suite. </p><p> </p><p>Eliza is waiting for you when you get there. She stands on the dirt path, with a wide smile spread across her lips, painted matte black, with short, curly bubblegum pink hair, and a leather jacket.  </p><p> </p><p>“Hello! Hello sweetheart!” </p><p> </p><p>“Hi!” you grin widely. </p><p> </p><p>She pulls you in for a hug and kisses you on both cheeks. Then she remembers Snape is there and pulls away, clearing her throat. “Hello, Professor Snape.” she nods respectfully.</p><p> </p><p>“Miss Forrester.” he replies, “What are you up to these days?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m an auror for the Ministry.” she says. He hums with approval. </p><p> </p><p>“Ahem! Anyway! Everyone’s waiting! Our tent’s this way.” The two of you trail after her. It’s a bright, sunny day. She stops at a perfectly-set-up tent, no doubt the handiwork of herself and Eugene Hall. She throws open the flaps and ducks inside. “I found ‘em!” she declares. You immediately go to follow her. But before that, you glance over your shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>“Come on, Sev!” you take him by the hand and lead him inside. When you step through the doors, the tidy, decorated tent is massive and sectioned off. There’s a living room, a kitchen, and a dining table. A record is on playing the soundtrack from “Grease”, and in one corner, there are four bedrooms. One has two bunk beds, the one next to it has three single beds, and the last two have double beds. </p><p> </p><p>“HELLO DARLINGS!” you sing-song. </p><p> </p><p>“Hi!” Renee says. She smiles softly and turns from where she had been scrubbing dishes. When she lets go the dishes continue scrubbing themselves. </p><p> </p><p>“Yo!” Cas says from their spot where they’re lounging on the couch. Eugene glances up from his armchair and the book he’s reading. </p><p> </p><p>“Afternoon.” he says, nodding, and then goes back to his book.</p><p> </p><p>“Check, and mate, Mauve.” says Jeremy Jones. </p><p> </p><p>Then you hear an expletive, “FUCK! DAMMIT JEREMY!” It’s exaggerated, not angry. You glance up at Snape, who rolls his eyes. Then you look over at the table, where Jeremy Jones and Mauve Coleman are playing wizard chess, with Orion watching them. He shifts in his chair and you see the gold wedding band catch in the light coming through the window.</p><p> </p><p>“Son! We have guests!” Eliza says, scolding. Mauve looks up to see you and Snape. </p><p> </p><p>“Shit—sorry Dad…” he says, “Ahem! Hello Kit, and good afternoon Professor Snape.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hi!” you reply. The other two men greet you after him. </p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, Eliza shakes her head and smiles. “Anyway.” she looks back at the two of you, “You can put your things in that room with the queen bed there. Stella volunteered to bunk with Jeremy, Cas, and Mauve so you and Severus could have the bed.” </p><p> </p><p>You briefly glance at the bottom bunk of one of the bunk beds. There are two cages on the floor next to it: a tank with a couple salamanders, and a cage full of nifflers. The room next to it with the three single beds is neat, no doubt been freshly cleaned by Orion and Eugene, and the third has a collapsed wheelchair next to it. The one with the double bed is even neater than the one before it. And finally, the fourth has not yet been inhabited. You step inside, “This is where we’ll be sleeping, Sev.” you say. You set the bag on the floor by the foot of the bed. He takes off his cloak and hangs it up on the bedpost, and you hang your flannel on the other side. </p><p> </p><p>“Now, these walls are made of canvas. They aren’t soundproof and Renee and I are right next to you.” Eliza says, “So behave. You’re not allowed to get frisky, Kitty.”   </p><p> </p><p>You flush deep red, “We <em> know </em>that!” you exclaim. </p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t <em> dare </em>in a full house like this one.” Snape huffs, “I have decency, thank you very much Miss Forrester.”   </p><p> </p><p>“Good!” she chuckles and then leaves, crossing towards the kitchen, “Do you need any help Renee, darling?” she asks. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes please, can you get me the ladle and pot from over there?”</p><p> </p><p>“Certainly~”  </p><p> </p><p>Once she’s gone, Severus looks at you and says, “You told me they were odd but I never thought they’d be this odd. You fit right in with them.” </p><p> </p><p>“Thanks, I know!” you say, “Welcome to the Ebbott Bunch, Sev.”  You leave him awkwardly standing in the room as you go out to greet your friends. When you rejoin him and then cross to the living room, you meet eyes with Cas.</p><p> </p><p>“You can sit down.” they say. They move from lounging to sitting so that you two can make yourselves comfortable. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you!” you start to move to the couch, “Come on, love~” you say to Snape. He does and you scoot into his side, shoulders brushing. In that moment, Renee whisks into the room. </p><p> </p><p>“Would either of you like anything to drink?.” </p><p> </p><p>“Sure! I’ll have some iced tea.” you say, “Will you have anything, darling?” you look at Severus.</p><p> </p><p>“The same thing, please.” he says. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay!” Renee smiles and then turns back to the kitchen area, “Eliza, dearest, can you please get two iced teas?” </p><p> </p><p>“On it!” she replies. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, I love you!” </p><p> </p><p>Renee sits down on the unoccupied chair with her glass of water, “How are you?” she asks. </p><p> </p><p>“Good, good!” you reply cheerfully, chest swelling with happiness. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad. And what about you Professor Snape?” she asks, looking at him.  </p><p> </p><p>“Just fine.” he replies curtly.  </p><p> </p><p>“I have iced tee-eeea~” Eliza’s piercing and lovely soprano sing-songs. She approaches you on the sofa, with the ice clinking against the glass. She hands you each a cold cup of freshly brewed tea.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, hon~” you reply. </p><p> </p><p>“Of course~” She sits down on the arm of Renee’s chair. </p><p> </p><p>You look around the tent, “We’re missing two.” you say. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.” Eliza replies, “Damo’s with his team, but he’s coming over for lunch. And Stella, she went off to do stars knows what. But I’m sure she’ll pop in. </p><p> </p><p>“Oy!” says a raspy voice, and then sparkling eyes on a freckled face framed with lavender hair pokes in through the doorway, “Did anyone see a salamander with a smoking back come in here? I was trying to cool them down with the freezing charm but they ran away before I could.” </p><p> </p><p>“No, sorry. No one’s seen Chili.” Renee replies.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, but Sugar was looking for gold in the flour again.” Eliza scoffs, “You really ought to keep a sharper eye on those nifflers.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah, I should do that—oh! Hi Kit! Hi Severus!” she says, noticing you at last, “Anyway, I would stop and chat more, but I’ve got a smoking salamander to find. Catch you laters~” and she pops back out and disappears.  </p><p> </p><p>A few chuckles erupt from the group and Snape turns to you with a “Wtf” look. He furrows his brow and mouths “What the hell…?”  </p><p> </p><p>“That’s basically Stella for you.” Eugene says, shaking his head.  </p><p> </p><p>“Should someone go help her look for her salamander?” Mauve asks the group. No one answers so everyone looks at you.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you think, Kit?” asks Eliza, “She’s your best friend, you know ‘er best.” </p><p> </p><p>“I think…she’s already halfway across the campsite by now and we’ll spend more time looking for her so we can help her find her salamander than for the actual salamander.” you say, “And then by the time we do find her, Chili will be safe in their cage again.”  </p><p> </p><p>“Aha!” exclaims a voice from outside, although it’s kind of distant. And then you hear skipping and humming and she appears just moments later with a tiny and content spotted blue lizard in her hands, “I’ve found the Chili!”   </p><p> </p><p>And then Snape says, “Charming…” in a sarcastic drawl. Stella whisks into the tent with a flourish and goes into the bedroom with the bunk beds, and then she puts Chili with the two other salamanders, one green one, and one red and black one. </p><p> </p><p>“There! Back with Red and Peppers.” she says, then closes the tank, “Ah!” she dusts her hands, “Everyone’s alright now. Oh wait!” she goes to the cage next to the salamander tank and counts the number of nifflers in there. “Good news! Sugar, Cinnamon, Ginger, Spice, Paprika, and Houdini are all in here!” she declares.   </p><p> </p><p>“You know, I still find it hilarious that Houdini is the only niffler of yours that hasn’t managed to break out of the cage.” Eliza says. </p><p> </p><p>“He’s the best behaved of all of them.” she says. </p><p> </p><p>“Are there anymore wayward creatures we need to be looking for?” Snape asks, “Any spiders perhaps? Singing toads? An owl? Dragons?” </p><p> </p><p>“Nope! My mum is taking care of all of them. As well as the two cats, a kneazle, a….(insert a list of any magical creatures you can think of), and the snake hatchlings. I only brought eight pets with me this time.” she replies. </p><p> </p><p>“Professor Snape, considering that she usually brings more than a dozen, we should feel lucky.”  Eugene informs. </p><p> </p><p>Snape gives you another “wtf” look. </p><p> </p><p>“She excelled in Care of Magical Creatures.” You say.</p><p> </p><p>“Mmm hmm!” Stella replies, beaming, “I’ve made a career out of studying them. I’ve found out so many fascinating things!” </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah! It’s brilliant!” you add on, “She’s published a number of books.” </p><p> </p><p>“Mmm hmm. My most popular ones are my anthologies with niffler stories, and the ones about the psychology of different magical beasts.”  </p><p> </p><p>“Now that’s something I’ve never heard.” Snape says, actually sounding the slightest bit impressed for once in his life, “And what about the rest of you, then?” he asks. </p><p> </p><p>“Cas, Orion, and I are aurors.” Eliza says. </p><p> </p><p>“I work for the department of Magical Law enforcement.” Renee says, “In the improper use of magic office.” </p><p> </p><p>“I build brooms.” continues Eugene, “Granted, I’m still an apprentice, but I’m always trying to customize and improve broom technology, particularly.”</p><p> </p><p>“Jeremy and I manage the coffee shop in Hogsmeade.” Mauve furthers.</p><p> </p><p>“…And we’re also champions of wizard gaming tournaments. Which we host every Tuesday night.” Jeremey adds. </p><p> </p><p>“And of course, Damocoles is a professional quidditch player and I’m a teacher!” you end at last. </p><p> </p><p>For a moment Severus gives you a “no shit Sherlock” look, before a smug smirk tugs slightly at the corner of his mouth. You feel yourself already getting irritated, because you know you’ve just paved the way for…</p><p> </p><p>“A teacher?” Severus repeats, “I wouldn’t have guessed that, it isn’t as though we’re coworkers or anything.” </p><p> </p><p>…You’ve paved the way for him to be a bloody smart arse. There’s a few sniggers.  </p><p> </p><p>You playfully hit his arm, “Oh shut it, you! I was trying to be funny!” Your friends all find your flustered state amusing. You flush scarlet and glare. </p><p> </p><p>Just then, the front entrance flies open, and with a gust of wind, in flies a young man on a perfectly polished broom. He hovers a few inches above the ground. </p><p> </p><p>“Hello loves!” he exclaims. </p><p> </p><p>“Damocoles!” you exclaim. </p><p> </p><p>“Ya made it!” Eliza declares. </p><p> </p><p>Damocoles is dark-haired and olive skinned. He has a bright smile and mischievous eyes.. His uniform is tied at his waist, and there’s sweat on his forehead from getting in a bit of morning warm-up. On his bare, well-toned shoulder, he proudly wears a tattoo of the Celtic symbol for “Perseverance”.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey Kit,” he says, smiling, “And Professor Snape, good to see you too.”</p><p> </p><p>Severus nods curtly, “Mr. Smith.” </p><p> </p><p>“You’re just in time for lunch.” Renee says, “It’s ready, so how about we all set the table and eat?”</p><p> </p><p>Everyone agrees with this, so you all parade to the back of the tent and work together using your wands to perfectly set everything. Then, you gather around for a loud and cheerful meal. You watch as Damocoles lowers his broom to level with the chair and scoots himself onto the pillow. Then he flicks his wand to scoot the chair in and props the broom against the table. </p><p> </p><p align="center">-xXx-</p><p> </p><p>“So, Severus~” Eliza drawls, looking right at him. He’s stayed relatively quiet throughout the whole table conversation, besides for chiming in his sarcastic two cents occasionally, “Ya stole Kit from us for the summer, whadaya have to say for yourself?” she jokes. </p><p> </p><p>“I stole Kit from you?” he echoes, “I think a more appropriate phrase would be “swept them off their feet”.” He’s thankfully picked up on the joke, and he’s trying his utmost to respond accordingly.  </p><p> </p><p>“Swept…heh. ‘Cuz we’re wizards and we have brooms.” Orion chimes in. You all turn to look at him. </p><p> </p><p>“I think we got the punchline, Orion.” Eliza scoffs. </p><p> </p><p>“Sev-er-us!” you groan, “Why!? Not you too…! I already hear enough from these idiots,” you emphasize Eliza, Cas, Renee, and Orion, “I don’t need more from you.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry.” he says. You look up at him with hopeful eyes and everyone around the table is taken aback. “…I’ll be sure to make a mental note of it on my list of “things to say when I want to fluster you.””</p><p> </p><p>“You bloody prat, I hate you!” you exclaim, burning with irritation. </p><p> </p><p>Damocoles laughs. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, shut it!” you exclaim. </p><p> </p><p>“No, you don’t though.” </p><p> </p><p>“…You’re right...” </p><p> </p><p>Your group laughs.   </p><p> </p><p>“He is definitely your type.” Renee comments, “Anyway. Back to the original conversation. Honestly, Severus, we’re glad you let Kit stay with you. Better than have them go back home. Thank you for that.” Her eyes are full of gratitude. </p><p> </p><p>“From here on, I have every intention of them spending every summer and every holiday in Spinner’s End with me.” he says, before he turns to look at you, “…If they want, anyway.” </p><p> </p><p>“Of course, I do!” you exclaim.    </p><p> </p><p>“But we’ve missed them!” Damocoles says, “Have you been taking care of them?” he studies him quizzically, almost skeptically. </p><p> </p><p>“I have.” he replies earnestly. </p><p> </p><p>“We take care of each other like a good couple should!” you add. You take a bite of food and a sip of iced tea.  </p><p> </p><p>“That’s good!” Stella declares. She drops her fork in excitement. The clatter echoes through the tent, “Oopsy!” She picks it back up, “I’m fine~” </p><p> </p><p>“Better keep that up.” Eliza says, “Taking care of each other.” </p><p> </p><p>“Well obviously.” Snape says.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re together! Everything will be fine!” you add optimistically. </p><p align="center">-xXx-</p><p>You spend the rest of the day catching up, playing games, and spending time together. Eventually, Damocoles has to leave to go back to his team. Within a couple hours following, it starts to get dark, and soon, you’re bundled up and headed to the stadium for the match. While you’re in line, chuckling and laughing, you hear the murmur of familiar voices. </p><p> </p><p>“Look, it’s Professor Snape, and Professor Oakley!” That sounds just like Ginny Weasley. </p><p> </p><p>You turn to see Harry, Hermione, the Weasleys, and Cedric Diggory and his father. You smile your beaming smile, which lights up your face and you wave, “Hello, dears!” From beside you, Severus rolls his eyes and doesn’t acknowledge them. </p><p> </p><p>But still, Harry and the others smile and wave back, before they disappear in the crowd.  </p><p> </p><p>“You’re such a sweet teacher~” Eliza purrs. </p><p> </p><p>“Thanks, I try to be.” you reply. </p><p> </p><p>“Our seats are up this way~” Renee cuts in, “Come on~ Please don’t get lost in the crowd.” </p><p> </p><p align="center">-xXx-</p><p>The match starts with the familiar fantastic spectacle and loud screaming of fans. When you see Damocoles, all of you shout his name and words of encouragement. Adrenaline and excitement pumps through your veins as you watch the intense and evenly matched teams pitted against each other. Next to you, Eliza is calling out fighting words, and Stella is shoving her face with popcorn.  </p><p> </p><p align="center">-xXx-</p><p>“…And another incredible defense by beater Damocoles Smith! This is proving to be an exciting and close game folks~” </p><p> </p><p>“WHOOO HOOO!” Stella cheers. </p><p> </p><p>“GOOOOO DAMOCOLES!” you scream, rattling your pom-poms and posing.   </p><p> </p><p>“KEEP KICKING THEIR ARSES, DAMO! SHOW NO MERCY!” Eliza adds.  </p><p> </p><p>“…Don’t get hurt…” Renee says softly. </p><p> </p><p>Damocoles’ next bludger sails over your heads, and barrels directly into one of the Bulgarian players, sending them spiraling towards the floor of the stadium.</p><p> </p><p>“Ooo, shit.” Mauve says, “That’s gotta be excruciating…”</p><p> </p><p>“Good job Damo!” Orion exclaims, “Keep it up, mate!” </p><p> </p><p align="center">-xXx-</p><p>The match ends with Ireland’s scraping win of ten points. And you all leave full of laughs and excitement, loudly discussing the amazing game that has just unfolded. You can’t wait to see Damo tomorrow, to congratulate him.  </p><p> </p><p>Back in the tent, you, Renee, and Stella continue talking excitedly, with Eliza and the others chiming in too. After calming down, you plop down on the couch. </p><p> </p><p>“Damn! What a rush.” you sigh, “If Muggle sports were that fun, I’d actually care about them~ who needs football when you’ve got Quidditch?” </p><p> </p><p>“I know, right?” Stella agrees. </p><p> </p><p>“Who wants dessert?” Renee asks, “Stella made butterbeer ice cream!” A murmur of agreement fills the tent. </p><p> </p><p align="center">-xXx-</p><p>You’re all eating ice cream, when suddenly, chaos and terrified screams sound off in the distance outside. Immediately, it destroys the mood. From beside you, Severus goes rigid. </p><p> </p><p>And then Eliza says, “We need to leave!” </p><p> </p>
