    <p dir="ltr">       Lyall and Hope Lupin were anything but ordinary. They’d grown up together in Wales, both enjoying taking long walks across the moor. They both lived in small cottages near each other and as children they played together nearly every day. Lyall would often take refuge at Hope’s house when his father had too much to drink or his mother felt particularly vicious.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       The long days on the moor ended after Lyall’s eleventh birthday. Lyall began going to a boarding school for nine months of the year. Leaving Hope behind. When he returned home during breaks, he would tell Hope fantastic tales of impossible things.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       They first kissed at sixteen and were engaged by nineteen. Hope missed Lyall dearly for the nine months he was away. Writing him nearly every day so when he returned in June, he always had a box of letters waiting for him. When Lyall graduated school, he took a job in London. Once he had enough money to purchase a small cottage on the moor with a sizable fireplace, he asked Hope to marry him. She happily agreed, on one condition, that he never leave her for the strange magic he often spoke of. He promised to put her first and they happily married in the Spring. There was only one photo from that day. In it a young smiling Hope had baby’s breath woven into her long wavy hair. She wore a simple green dress. Lyall dressed in a simple button up stood next to her, their hand clasped together. You could that they were resisting the urge to look at one another, both heads turned slightly, bodies angled together. The best part of the photo was later said to be how happy the couple looked. It would be the last time they would ever be that joyous.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       Lyall loved Hope and quickly found relief and safety in their marriage. After growing up in a violent and unstable household living with Hope felt like a dream. Hope loved Lyall dearly, otherwise she wouldn’t have put up with any of the strange nonsense that seemed to surround him. Hope didn’t understand magic and how Lyall was able to step through their fireplace in Wales and get to his place of work in London only seconds later. She didn’t understand her husband’s job, which had something to do with the regulation of dangerous beasts. The more she asked questions the more confused and fearful she became. Lyall was always so patient with her, taking his time to calm her down and patiently explain his strange world to her time and time again. She could never understand, perhaps she simply didn’t wish to. Lyall’s tendency to teach everyone around him in his own kind manner was one of the many reasons she loved the so man dearly. But was also one of the reasons for a dark resentment towards the world he was a part of that had taken root on Lyall’s eleventh birthday nearly a decade before. Despite all this, Hope was a caring and kind wife and found joy within the four walls of their cottage on the land she’d always loved.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       Lyall and Hope both desperately wanted a child. Not long after their marriage Hope began experiencing extreme abdominal pains and discomfort with excessive bleeding that often made having sex extremely uncomfortable. She hid it to the best of her ability from Lyall and they rarely spoke of it. For when they did it usually ended in an argument, Lyall wanting to take her to see a doctor in London and Hope firmly refusing. She had never left Wales and insisting that it was normal and part of being a woman. The Lupins became acquainted with hiding their pain early on. A skill that would come to be surprisingly useful.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       Over three years after their wedding Hope became pregnant. For the first time she allowed Lyall to take her to a doctor in London for regular checkups. She dealt with the unfamiliar city, orange pill bottles, and long words she couldn’t understand. Telling herself over and over that it was for her unborn child.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       Late at night on March 9th, 1960 Hope Lupin’s water broke. She was rushed to the hospital. Their son, Remus Lupin, was born at exactly midnight on March 10th, 1960. Hope barley survived the birth and was told she would never be able to have another child. She had to stay in the hospital alone for the first week of her first and only child’s life, having insisted that Lyall take her infant son to the nursery she’d spent months preparing in their small cottage on the moor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       The one person that made that week bearable was a kind nurse. His name was Sam Evans, his hair was a bright red and he spoke with a kind voice. He took the time to explain all the unfamiliar things people were doing with her body to her and kept her company during the day. He would tell her stories of his newborn daughter Lily as well as their ten-year-old daughter Petunia. He would read her fairy tales to take her mind off her only child who she had yet to hold. Lyall came by to pick up the breastmilk she insisted he feed baby Remus. She only glimpsed the two of them for a few seconds before he would at her insistence, the hospital being no place to keep a newborn baby. As the years went on her and Lyall would have dinner with the Evans’, bringing Remus along to play with Lily and her older sister Petunia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       When Hope finally made it home she swore to herself that she would always be there for her son, in all the ways she hadn’t been able to in his first week of life. After that it was rare to see the two apart. Hope spent all her time with her child, maintaining their small cottage and taking him to explore the moor. Lyall began to spend more and more time at work and would mumble something about werewolves in his sleep. Her illness and Lyall’s absence were largely ignored by the two as neither of them could bare the idea of their being any sort of conflict between them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       And so, our tale brings us to March 10th, 1966. It was Remus’ sixth birthday and all he wanted was to visit the ocean. The small family packed themselves into Hope’s small car she used when picking things up from the nearest down and headed to the beach.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">       Walburga and Orion Black’s story was decidedly less romantic than the Lupin’s. They were second cousins. Their betrothal had been finalized on Walburga’s sixth birthday. The document their parents signed ensured that the two would wed as soon as Orion (four years Walburga’s junior) graduated Hogwarts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       Walburga was raised with one purpose, to produce the next heir to The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. That meant she was to appease her husband in every way and always bow to his hand. From a young age she was shoved into the mold of a perfect pureblood wife. She learned how to maintain a house, memorized the Black family’s long a twisted history, and was taught to value blood purity and the continuation of the family line above all else. To Walburga’s recollection her sixth birthday was the tipping point, her life getting worse and worse after that day. After her birthday she was pushed into her studies with twice the vigor, the expectations placed on her were near impossible, and all remains of her childhood here stolen. If she dared step out of line, her parents would use the cruciatus curse on her. She learned how to be perfect quickly. Something her mother would boast about for years after.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       Walburga was Irma Crabbe Black and Pollux Black’s eldest child, having two younger brothers by the names of Alphard and Cygnus. They were avid participants in ancient and dark magic (the cruciatus curse being tame in comparison to many of the other rituals and spells they performed), especially Irma. As the years passed on, they sacrifice more and more of themselves in exchange for the dark rituals. Many of which called upon the ancient elements that had shaped magic itself. Magic that deep and powerful was anything but free.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       Orion Black was raised with one purpose, to be the head of The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. He was heir to the title as he only had one older sister by the name of Lucretia (she later married into the Prewett family). His father was Arcturus Black III and his mother Melania Macmillan Black. His first years of his life were the best, though they were far from happy. Starting at the age of six his father began tutoring him. Teaching young Orion everything there was to know about The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. He was punished physically for any mistakes he dared to make.</p>
<p dir="ltr">      Over the years Orion turned to stone. Any signs of joy or life seeped from his mind, replaced with an icy cruelty that filled him both inside and out. The day he married Walburga was the day he finally escaped his father’s clutches. Shortly thereafter his father fell ill and died of poisoning from an unidentifiable potion and he became the head of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       By their wedding day Walburga was a hardened and cruel witch, with an unhinged madness that would grow over the years. Orion was an icy statue. He saw his bride to be as a mere tool in his game to control as much as possible so no one would ever be able to hurt him again. The wedding was spectacular. The Black family’s fortune was shown in every decoration. It was lavish and beautiful. Neither Walburga nor Orion saw that though. After the wedding Orion threw out everything that had been involved, locking the more important things (like Walburga’s dress and photos from the wedding) deep inside number twelve Grimmuald Place in a room only he could access. They were never seen again.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       The following five years were anything but happy. Orion and Walburga only talked when necessary. They even slept in two separate rooms and having sex once a month when Walburga was most likely to become pregnant. Orion was a cruel husband, hitting Walburga for the slightest mistake and became a dictator worse than her own parents had been. He would punish her for her struggle to get pregnant, using curses that spread invisible pain throughout her entire body. The curses left no physical traces, as he would not risk her miscarrying a child due to his abuse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       Finally, at midnight on November 3rd, 1959 Walburga successfully gave birth to her first son Sirius Orion Black, the heir to The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. Sirius’ training was to officially begin at the age of six but even in the years before that he was privately tutored and held to the highest standards possible by his mother. She punished him often, borrowing spells from both Orion and her own parents. As a young child Sirius did not break as both Walburga and Orion had. His biggest flaw being his kindness. He was punished for hugging his younger brother Regulus (Orion having insisted on Walburga producing a spare). He had thanked the old house elf Kreacher until he was five years old despite repeated punishments. Walburga making him watch as she tortured Kreacher was the only way to get him to stop. From a young age he was passionate and full of life and love. He was punished often for it. But he grew older, he learned to hide his distasteful qualities. Even so he always slipped up eventually.</p>
<p dir="ltr">      Sirius Orion Black was a deep contrast of his stoic parents. He was a beautiful child with wide grey eyes, silky black curls, a beautiful laugh, and bright smile. His parents in contrast were drawn and stoic. His mother was ice cold with indifference, only breaking the façade when punishing one of her children. Then she would often laugh wildly and grin, a lunacy twinkling in her eye as she watched another human suffer in the same ways she had over and over again. Orion was icy and cruel. To an outside observer he only had one facial expression, but his family quickly learned to read the small movements of his face as well as his shifts in body language and tone for fear of suffering his wrath. Regulus, Sirius, and Walburga quickly becoming experts on his daily moods and body language, learning to read him in an effort to survive the impossibly cruel man. Walburga’s punishments were always physical, often having to do with pain. Orion almost never directly punished his children instead using manipulation and cruelty to make there lives a living hell if they dared cross him.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">       At the age of five Sirius brought a bird with a broken wing into the house. Orion caught him performing accidental magic to heal the bird and as punishment he made Sirius kill the bird. Telling Sirius that if he had left the bird alone it might still be alive.</p>
