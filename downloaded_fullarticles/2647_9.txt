    <p>If asked, Selina wouldn’t have an answer to when her relationship with Merula changed from enemies to frienemies. It was a subtle change, to be fair, something that just seemed to happen one day. When Merula threw a casual insult Selina’s way, her eyes sparkled with humor instead of malice. Rowan, Ben, and Penny didn’t seem to notice the change in Merula; but Selina most definitely did. It wasn’t until about a week later that she realized <em> why </em> Merula had finally decided to drop the <em> angry misunderstood teen </em>act with her.</p><p> </p><p>Selina dragged herself out of bed, looked in the mirror to make sure she was at least semi presentable, then emerged into the Slytherin common room. Being in her 6th year, Selina should’ve known there would be some sort of drama unfolding in the early morning hours; Slytherin girls come each with their own lion’s share of drama. Sighing dramatically, Selina was more than ready to push her way through the gaggle of girls gathered in a circle in the center of the room, but stopped when she heard their conversation.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean are any of us really surprised? She’s given me a butch vibe from day one.”</p><p> </p><p>“God, what a disgrace. Such a noble bloodline, to have its last remaining successor turn out to be a dyke is such a shame.”</p><p> </p><p>Selina’s blood ran cold. Narrowing her eyes, Selina spun on her heel, facing the group of girls, ready to give them a piece of her mind, but was interrupted by the door to the girl’s dormitory opening. Merula stepped out, a lazy, sarcastic smirk plastered on her face, but her eyes were a blazing purple inferno.</p><p> </p><p>“Which one of you geniuses did this? Because I really like your handwriting, very neat, easy to read.” the sarcasm in Merula’s voice was thick as she held up her robe, showing off the word “DYKE” written in red blazed onto the back of it. The group of girls dissolved into giggles, and Merula sighed, rolling her eyes irritably. “Honestly, I’m impressed you imbecilic bimbos had enough cumulative brain power to pull this off.” Merula snarked, and the girls laughter died off. Selina bit her lip to contain her laughter as one member of the group stepped forwards, face so red it looked like she was about to explode.</p><p> </p><p>“All the Slytherin girls have reached an agreement that we don’t feel comfortable with you sleeping in the same dormitory as us. I was about to go present a signed petition to Professor Snape asking for you to be moved to the boy’s dormitory.” The “head bitch”, Teresa, smirked triumphantly at the momentarily speechless look on Merula’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“Not all of the Slytherin girls agreed, Teresa.” Selina finally spoke out, stepping towards the sneering girl threateningly. “And unless you want me to take word of your little ‘petition’ to Dumbledore, I’d suggest you back the fuck off.” Selina growled, leaning even closer to Teresa’s face. Teresa scowled angrily at Selina.</p><p> </p><p>“Pfft, whatever, not worth our trouble. Come on, girls, wouldn’t want to be late to breakfast.” Teresa called lazily over her shoulder, and her and her group of mean girls departed, leaving only Selina and Merula alone in the common room.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, you ok?” Selina asked cautiously, not moving towards Merula for fear of retaliation, but waiting for any change of expression on the other girl’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I’m fine, gonna take a lot more brain power and a much higher collective IQ to knock me down a peg.” Merula brushed off Selina’s concern easily, lifting her robes to look at the word still emblazoned on the back.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to borrow some of my extra robes?” Selina offered, but Merula scoffed angrily.</p><p> </p><p>“No, no, I’m not gonna give those living mannequins the satisfaction.” Merula snarled, “I suppose I should thank you for shutting down Barbie-from-Hell before she went to Snape about… y’know, this.” Merula’s voice lost a bit of its usual lazy confidence, and Selina took that as permission to approach her.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, Merula, no need to thank me, I know how much that physically pains you.” Selina jabbed and, for a mere second, a rare, genuine smile flashed on Merula’s face. “After all, I should be thanking you. I guess I’ve always been kind of waiting for somebody else to come out around here so I could see how people would take it. I suppose ‘not well’ is what I should’ve expected.” Selina added dryly, and surprise flashed across Merula’s face, replaced by amusement.</p><p> </p><p>“No, really? You? Into girls? Not like you practically worship the ground Haywood steps on.” Merula snarked, and Selina plastered a jokingly scandalized look on her face.</p><p> </p><p>“I do not! Penny is gorgeous, but she’s so not my type.” Selina added honestly. Merula narrowed her eyes challengingly.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh really? So what <em> is </em> your type, Kyle?” Merula smirked at Selina’s flustered expression. But, to her credit, she recovered quickly, leaning in closer than she had ever dared to get to Merula in the past.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know, Snyde, what’s yours?” This time it was Merula’s turn to look flustered, and Selina grinned, drawing away from the purple eyed witch, grabbing her wand out of her pocket and holding her robes out in front of her. Muttering an incantation under her breath, Selina flourished her wand over the fabric and bright red letters began to appear. Dropping her robes Selina spun around so her back was facing Merula.</p><p> </p><p>“The hell, Kyle?” Merula sounded genuinely shocked, staring at the word “LESBO” written in red lettering that had manifested on the back of Selina’s robes.</p><p> </p><p>“If you’re gonna go out and face the calvary with a literal target on your back, you’re not gonna do it alone.” Selina answered, “Not like you can’t handle the onslaught by yourself or anything. Us gays gotta stick together.” Selina joked and for once, Merula looked too shocked to make a sarcastic comment. The hug was unexpected, and crushingly tight, and all Selina could do was wrap her arms around the shorter witch and hold her just as tight. The hug laster a moment or two longer than it should’ve, and Merula withdrew with an air of reluctance that Selina couldn’t help but feel as well.</p><p> </p><p>“Well then, lesbo, shall we?” Merula drawled, gesturing to the door.</p><p> </p><p>“As you wish, dyke.” Selina jabbed back, smirking playfully at Merula as they exited the common room.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>To say they were late to breakfast would be an understatement. They almost completely missed breakfast. Which also meant when the two Slytherins walked through those double doors, the eyes of every single student were already on them. At first, Selina just heard whispers about how odd it was that her and Merula walked in together, considering they were the most famous rivalry in the school, always at each other’s throats. But as they walked further, people started noticing the backs of their robes. The volume of the whispers increased tenfold. Merula glanced at Selina, a hint of nerves present in her purple gaze. Selina gave her a small, reassuring smile. When Selina looked forwards again, she spotted her friends. Rowan was giving her a very odd look, most definitely calculating what hex Merula must’ve cast on her, Ben looked terrified, but that was just his standard expression whenever he sees Merula, and Penny looked suspicious. It wasn’t till the two witches walked past them that they  noticed what was emblazoned on their robes. Merula kept marching forwards, her burning gaze now locked on Teresa and her girl gang from where they sat at the head of the Slytherin table. Selina and Merula approached the mean girls confidently, and stood directly behind Teresa.</p><p> </p><p>“And what the hell do you two think you’re doing?” Teresa fumes, and Merula answers her by grabbing Teresa’s cup, and pouring the contents on her head. Teresa screamed bloody murder, running her hand through her thick platinum locks, now dripping with orange liquid. “UGH! Out of my way, you heathens!” Teresa shouted, shoving Merula backwards, so she stumbled back into Selina, and storming out of the Great Hall.</p><p> </p><p>“Well look at that, Miss Paler-Than-Thou knows an 8-letter word! I thought her vocabulary only extended up to 5 letter words.” Merula shouted down the hall towards Teresa’s retreating form, whose only response was raising her middle finger over her head. Merula snickered and Selina grinned wickedly. It was then they realized the position they were in; Merula’s back was pressed against Selina’s front, and Selina had her hands on Merula’s waist to steady her when she stumbled back. And every eye in the Great Hall was on them. Merula stepped forwards, out of Selina’s arms, and glared at the rest of the Slytherin girls, who were still huddled at the end of the table.</p><p> </p><p>“Should’ve known you’re a dyke too, Kyle.” sneered one of the girls, and Selina stepped forwards, yellow eyes narrowing to dangerous slits.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh honey, don’t even bother trying to rack that vulture brain of yours for a good insult. It’s actually quite a sad display, and I didn’t come here to be depressed.” Merula snarked, and the Slytherin girl scoffed angrily and stood up, storming towards the exit. The rest of the group followed her, all giving Merula and Selina a wide berth. Merula raised both of her hands, in a double middle finger salute as each girl passed by, and Selina clicked her teeth at one of them, making her squeal and practically jump into her friend’s arms. After they left, the silence in the Great Hall was deafening.</p><p> </p><p>“Anybody else got a problem with us? Selina challenged, and her words were met with silence. Selina felt a rush of bravery, and looped her arm through Merula’s, leading her towards where her friends were sitting. When they sat down, the silence was broken, and people returned to their early morning conversations. Her friends, however, remained silent, staring, between Selina and Merula, looking awestruck.</p><p> </p><p>“Uhm, Selina??? You’re gay??? We’ve been friends for how long??? Bitch you didn’t think to tell me before outing yourself to the whole school???” Rowan sounded incredulous, and Selina winced when she swore; Rowan almost never swears, only when she really wants to make her point. “I love you, bitch.” Rowan smiles and throws her arms around her. Selina laughs and returns her embrace.</p><p> </p><p>“Congratulations, Selina. You’re really brave, coming out like that.” Ben says shyly, offering Selina a friendly smile. Selina returns his smile sweetly.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my gosh, Selina, I could totally hook you up with this great 7th year Ravenclaw, she’s gay, cute, and single!” Penny squealed, grabbing Selina’s hands excitedly. Selina forced a smile, but internally balked at the thought of being set up with some 7th year she doesn’t even know.</p><p> </p><p>“Is there any particular reason why you invited me to crash sad Breakfast Club, Kyle?” Merula pitched in, sounding bored.</p><p> </p><p>“Merula you know what The Breakfast Club is?! I thought you shunned everything Muggle!” Ben pointed out, and Merula glared sharply at him.</p><p> </p><p>“No one asked for your opinion, bootleg Sam Evans. For the record, I do enjoy Muggle movies from time to time, but this does not by any means make me a Muggle lover.” Merula sniffed, and Ben genuinely grinned at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you just make a Glee reference?” Ben’s smirk was positively wicked, and Merula’s eyes darted around.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh go fuck yourself, Copper.” Merula muttered, but with much less conviction than usual. Selina couldn’t hide her grin, and Merula smacked her arm, playful irritation in her eyes. “And you, Kyle. Don’t think just because we both like pussy that we’re suddenly gonna become <em> friends </em>or anything. I have a reputation to salvage, you know.” Merula stated matter-of-factly, and Selina almost spit out her water at Merula’s crude language. “You prude.” Merula scoffed, snatching Selina’s cup out of her hands and taking a drink out of it. “You fives and Kyle can go back to wallowing in your inadequacy, for the eleven has to get to class.” Merula called over her shoulder casually, getting up and walking away.</p><p> </p><p>“If I’m not a five then what am I?” Selina called after her, and Merula’s response was raising both of her middle fingers. “Oh, so you’re saying I’m an eleven then?” Selina smirked as Merula spun around.</p><p> </p><p>“Not on your life, Kyle.” Merula jeered back, turning back around and exiting the Great Hall. When Selina turned back to face her friends, they were all staring at her again.</p><p> </p><p>“What the hell was that?” Penny was the first to break the silence.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?” Selina asked, eyebrows furrowing.</p><p> </p><p>“Why in the name of all things holy and not insane were you flirting with Merula Snyde?” Penny questioned, eyes narrowed suspiciously.</p><p> </p><p>“What? I wasn’t flirting with her?” Selina narrowed her eyes, confused. She hadn’t been flirting with Merula. Had she?</p><p> </p><p>“Did she know that?” Penny fixed Selina with a penetrating stare.</p><p> </p><p>“Really, guys? You know our banter! That was no different, you guys are just seeing it differently because of the events of this morning.” Selina declared, staring right back into Penny’s sapphire gaze. Penny still looked skeptical, but nodded her head. Ben looked positively relieved.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank Merlin, Selina. It was kinda cool to find out Merula likes some Muggle stuff, but no way in hell would I be comfortable with her hanging out with us all the time.” Ben gushed, and Rowan nodded vigorously in agreement. Selina felt her heart sink a bit at their obvious (and, to be fair, very reasonable) aversion to Merula, but she couldn’t exactly place why.</p><p> </p><p>“Guys, we should probably get to class.” Rowan fretted, reminding each of them how so stereotypically Ravenclaw she is.</p><p> </p><p>“Rowan, girl, I love you, but rushing me to Snape’s class right now, with the gay equivalent of the Scarlet Letter on my back, is not appreciated.” Selina joked, and her friends laughed, falling back into their usual pattern of good natured teasing and joking, events of the early morning forgotten for the time being.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The rest of Selina’s classes passed without a hitch, most likely because her classmates are too terrified of the combined wraths of the school hero and the school villain to dare speak ill of them. It wasn’t till she was on her way back to the Slytherin common room for the night when things went to hell.</p><p> </p><p>“Selina! Wait!” Rowan’s voice echoed down the hallway as she ran towards her. Selina stopped, furrowing her eyebrows in worry at the frantic look in Rowan’s eyes as she reached her.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s up, Rowan?” Selina asked cautiously.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you hear what happened to Merula?” Rowan asked breathlessly, and Selina felt her blood run cold. “Apparently Teresa hexed her into next Sunday in Snape’s class. Snape had to carry her to the infirmary himself, apparently after Teresa finished hexing her she was laying on the floor in a pool of her own blood. There’s been no word from any teachers about what state she’s in right now.” Selina felt cold fingers of fear dig into her heart, sending a chill throughout her whole body. Without so much as a word to Rowan, Selina turned and ran towards the staircase. Selina made it up to the double doors of the infirmary in record time, and was about to push her way in when the sound of voices on the other side caught her attention.</p><p> </p><p>“Albus, she won’t let me touch her! For Merlin’s sake, if I can’t see her injuries I can’t hope to heal them!”</p><p> </p><p>“Miss Snyde has been through… trauma in the past, Poppy. Given her past circumstances, it is completely understandable that she doesn’t want to be touched.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh Albus, you aren’t saying…”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m afraid so. The night her parents were arrested, I was called in to ‘deal with the child’. The state I found her in… I’m afraid it was quite dreadful. She would flinch away from me whenever I made a sudden movement. It took her a week to start talking again, and even longer until she would let me take her to a doctor. Oh Poppy, the bruises…”</p><p> </p><p>“Poor child. I’m not happy about it, but I suppose now that the bleeding has stopped I don’t have to dress her wounds. I put a pain numbing spell and that’s the best I can do given the circumstances.”</p><p> </p><p>“Albus, Poppy. I have just informed the girls in my House that until they learn how to respect their classmates none of them will be taking any trips to Hogsmeade. Also, the alterior sleeping arrangements you asked for have been set up. But are you certain keeping Miss Snyde with Miss Kyle is a good idea? Their rivalry is infamous.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Severus. And yes. I don’t know if you have heard of the display put on in the Great Hall this morning, but I believe that the two girls can overcome their differences for this matter.”</p><p> </p><p>“If you say so, Albus. How is she, Poppy?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well I haven’t got a look at her wounds yet, but they’ve stopped bleeding which means they are substantially shallow. My guess is 4 or 5 whip-like lacerations across her back. What a nasty hex.”</p><p> </p><p>Selina felt sick to her stomach, her mind reeling, trying to process all of the information she had just overheard. She couldn’t handle sitting there any longer, and pushed the double doors open. Dumbledore, Snape, and Madame Pomfrey all turned to look at her as she entered.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, Miss Kyle, perfect timing. Due to the unfortunate closed mindedness of your Housemates, we have taken the liberty to set up alternate sleeping arrangements for you and Miss Snyde. When you are ready, Madame Pomfrey will escort you there. But for now, I assume you are here to check on her. We’ll be out of your way.” Dumbledore nodded his head to Selina respectfully, walking out of the doors, followed closely by both Snape and Madame Pomfrey. As the door shut behind them, Selina approached the bed in the farthest back corner, which had a curtain around it.</p><p> </p><p>“Merula?” Selina called softly, quietly parting the curtain surrounding the bed. Merula sat on the edge of the bed facing away from her, shoulders hunched forwards, and head hanging low. The back of her robes were completely soaked through with blood. “Oh Merlin, Merula.” Selina whispered sorrowfully, walking around the bed to stand in front of her. Merula slowly raised her head. Even through her signature smokey eye Selina could see the dark circles that ringed the other witch’s eyes, eyes which were dull and glassy, holding none of their usual mischief and light. Merula’s eyes narrowed upon looking at Selina, and she could see cold fury seep into her dull purple eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you have someone to be saving, hero?” Merula spat, lips curling into a sneer. Selina did not acknowledge her anger, instead took a seat on the bed next to Merula.</p><p> </p><p>“Merula please, please let me help you. You don’t have to push me away.” Selina slowly reaches up to touch Merula’s face, but the other witch caught her wrist, eyes burning.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not one of your fucking charity cases, Selina.” Merula seethed, fingernails digging into her wrist. Selina winced, and Merula dropped her wrist, looking horrified with herself for a split second.</p><p> </p><p>“No, you’re not. Believe it or not, I actually <em> care </em>about you, and I want to help you, and you are making this difficult for both of us.” Selina said softly, reaching out again towards Merula’s face. Merula regarded her hand warily, but did not make a move to retreat. As Selina’s cold palm made contact with Merula’s cheek, the purple eyed witch flinched violently, and Selina tried to pull her hand back, but Merula caught her wrist and pulled it forwards, pulling Selina closer so they were almost nose to nose. Selina was acutely aware of Merula’s hot breath washing over her lips, and found herself leaning in closer, lips parting. It was then that Madame Pomfrey’s voice broke the tense silence.</p><p> </p><p>“Miss Kyle? Miss Snyde? I really must insist that I escort you to your quarters now, it is very late.” Selina and Merula jumped apart, just as Madame Pomfrey poked her head through the curtain. “Are you sure I can’t dress your wounds, dear?” Madame Pomfrey asks hopefully, but Merula shook her head adamantly. Madame Pomfrey sighed “Alright then, dear. Follow me. Don’t worry, your belongings are already there. I promise this is temporary.” Merula and Selina walked in silence, both trying to ignore the little jolts of electricity generated each time their shoulders brushed together. Their “quarters” turned out to be an old, empty classroom on the third floor with two cots and their trunks with all their stuff in it. Madame Pomfrey gave them a stiff reminder to set their alarms, because no staff would be sent up to fetch them in the morning, before she departed, leaving Merula and Selina alone in a poorly candlelit room. Merula walked over to her trunk, rummaging around purposefully for a minute, before emerging triumphantly, holding a large brown bottle with a ripped off label in her hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Drink with me, Kyle. I’ve found that drinking is indeed the fastest way to get drunk.” Merula took a swig, then held out the bottle to Selina. Selina regarded it warily, before shrugging and lifting it to her lips. The liquid inside was acrid, and burned all the way down her throat, but Selina soon found herself taking another sip. The two witches sat in companionable silence, only broken by the sound of liquid sloshing around in the bottle as it was passed between them. “It’s stupid, y’know. We’ve spent all of this time hating each other.” Merula mused, passing the bottle.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t hate you, Merula. I never did. Not even in first year. I just… I didn’t understand why you are the way you are. But I think I understand now.” Selina pondered, causing Merula to fix her with a scrutinizing glance. It was really a miracle Selina could string together a coherent train of thought, considering they had nearly gotten through the whole bottle, and whatever the hell the liquid was it was mind numbingly strong.</p><p> </p><p>“Really, Kyle? And why is that?” Merula said incredulously, a slight slur to her words.</p><p> </p><p>“You have been through so much emotional and physical pain, you figure the only way to stop the pain is to not let anyone get close enough to cause you any pain. So you deflect with sharp words, and surround yourself with an electrified barbed wire fence of insults and cruelty. But, as a result, although nobody can hurt you, nobody can help you either.” Selina finished, her words not making too much sense to her intoxicated mind, but apparently the meaning got through to Merula, who stared at Selina like she had grown another head.</p><p> </p><p>“You spew that much wisdom shitfaced? Why did the universe make you so damn perfect?” Merula smirked drunkenly, leaning in close to Selina’s face. Selina giggled, sliding her hands up Merula’s thighs.</p><p> </p><p>“You think I’m perfect?” purred Selina, batting her glittering yellow eyes flirtatiously. The witches found themselves in much the same position as earlier in the infirmary, but this time, there was no interruption. Merula’s lips were soft, and tasted of alcohol and lemon, and Selina was already addicted. All those years of bitter rivalry sidelined by a gentle, chaste kiss. The chastity was short lived; the animosity returned, chaste kisses turned ravenous, gentle touches turning greedy as the longtime rivals fought for dominance. This time, Merula won. Selina’s back hit the bed, and less than a second after, Merula was on her, pressing a hot kiss to her lips. This time, Selina found she didn’t mind that Merula won.</p>
