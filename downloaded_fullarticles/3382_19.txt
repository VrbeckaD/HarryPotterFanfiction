    <p>            Every part of him ached.</p>
<p>            Harry Potter felt like he had been trampled by a graphorn.  His head ached, his back ached, his <em>skin</em> ached.  Something – many somethings – stabbed against his back, sharp.  Gravel?  Broken wood, perhaps?  He was a bit fuzzy on the details.  Had no idea where he even was.  His head hurt too hard to remember anything besides a crushing sensation.  Could he even move?  It certainly didn’t feel like it.  Harry could not even bring up the desire to even twitch a finger.  Not to open his eyes.  Even his <em>eyelids</em> ached.</p>
<p>            A low, feminine groan crept into his awareness.  Was there somebody there with him?  Whoever they were, they were clearly in pain.  As much as Harry?  That was debatable.</p>
<p>            Harry opened his eyes.</p>
<p>            He saw leaves.  Light shined between the foliage from the sun above.  With his sight rediscovered, Harry began to feel awareness creep into the rest of his body.  He twitched his fingers and curled his toes, feeling a twinge of relief when he was still able to feel both.  He wasn’t paralyzed, which was a relief.</p>
<p>            Then, like a dam breaking, it all came rushing back.  The Department of Mysteries, the Time Chamber.  Harry tackling Hermione out of the path of Dolohov’s curse.  Them slamming onto something, then the spinning, crushing, squeezing… Sirius… Sirius…</p>
<p>            <em>Sirius!  Sirius!  Sirius!  Sirius…Sirius…</em></p>
<p><em>            </em>Wasn’t even there.</p>
<p>            Harry was still in too much pain to move in any sort of timely fashion, but that certainly did not stop him from trying.  He pressed his hands into the ground, felt the sharp gravel – definitely gravel – digging into his palms.  Through grueling effort, he managed to sit up partway.  He tried to regain his bearings.  He was in a forest, in what appeared to be a dry streambed.   Judging by the light, it was probably mid-afternoon…</p>
<p>            There was another groan, behind him.</p>
<p>            Harry jerked his head around, which was a big mistake.  Pain lanced through his head so bad that his vision blurred.  Harry tried taking deep breaths, but otherwise stayed completely still, waiting for the pain to pass.  Through the pain, he was able to make out the shape of someone else sprawled motionless on the ground.  As his vision started to clear, he was able to make out a bushy head of hair.</p>
<p>            Hermione.</p>
<p>            With great effort, Harry began to haul himself across the ground toward his friend until he was able to look down on her face.  Hermione had always been a little pale – too many hours spent forgoing the sun for the library – but now she was positively ashen.  Harry imagined he couldn’t look much better, but that did not stop him from fearing her.</p>
<p>            “Hermione?” Harry croaked. “Hermione?” he repeated, voice stronger.</p>
<p>            To Harry’s relief, her eyes cracked open.</p>
<p>            “Harry?” Hermione’s voice was barely more than a whisper. “Harry, where are we?  What happened?”</p>
<p>            “I don’t know.  We were in the Department of Mysteries.  Death Eaters chased us and Neville into the Time Chamber.  One of them – Dolohov – threw some sort of purple curse at you.  I knocked you out of the way, and we fell onto something…” Harry looked around them again, “I guess it must have been some type of portkey?  I don’t think we’re in the Ministry anymore.”</p>
<p>            Hermione began to sit up.  Harry was still not steady enough to be any help to her, so he just sat back to be out of her way.  It took a few tries but, with her face scrunched up in effort, she managed an upright position.</p>
<p>            “Oh, no…” she gasped.</p>
<p>            “We need to get out of here, Hermione,” Harry said. “Everyone is still at the Ministry.”</p>
<p>            Hermione’s eyes widened. “You’re right, we need to get out of here,” she said.  She did a quick scan of the ground around her, and then her eyes suddenly became panicked.  She began pawing robes “Harry, do you have your wand?”</p>
<p>            Harry’s heart fell into his stomach.  He’d been holding it in the Department of Mysteries.  He looked at the ground around where he’d lain only minutes before.  When he was unable to spot it, he began searching his own robes in a state of panic.</p>
<p>            “We must have dropped them at the Ministry,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>            Harry felt cold. “What do we do now?” he asked.</p>
<p>            Hermione bit her lip and stared around.  Suddenly her eyes locked on something in the distance.</p>
<p>            “There,” she said, pointing.</p>
<p>            Harry followed the line of finger and noticed, in the distance over horizon.  A whisp of smoke was rising some distance away.  Harry looked at Hermione and raised his eyebrows in a silent question.</p>
<p>            “There’s probably a village over there.  If there’s a wizarding household, maybe we can convince them to let us use the Floo,” she elaborated.</p>
<p>            Harry personally had his doubts about this idea.  They would have to be very lucky to find any magical homes in some random village.  Then again, it was not like Harry could think of a better idea.  He gave Hermione a nod.</p>
<p>            They both struggled to their feet and climbed out of the streambed.  It was all too slow for Harry.  Their friends could be dying while they’re stumbling through the woods.  The one comfort Harry had was that Sirius had not actually been held hostage.  But that also brought a surge of guilt to Harry.  It’d all been a trick.  He had allowed Voldemort to lure him into a trap and bring all of his friends into danger with him.</p>
<p>            Harry stewed in his thoughts and panic as they stumbled through the woods.  The pace was horribly slow going, but the more they moved, the more the ache in their bodies slipped away.  Within an hour they were going at a respectable pace.  It was still too slow for Harry.  He wanted to tear through the woods, run as fast as he can.  He had to go help his friends…</p>
<p>            “Slow down, Harry!”</p>
<p>            “They’re in danger, Hermione!  Ron, Ginny, Neville, Luna – they’re all alone with the Death Eaters!”</p>
<p>            “You think I don’t know that?” Hermione snapped back. “You think I’m not worried sick?  However, we’re not going to be any use if we’re both exhausted.”</p>
<p>            Harry’s mind rebelled against her logic, but he had to admit it was undeniably, unbearably true.</p>
<p>            “On that note, we should Floo to Hogwarts,” Hermione said shakily. “By the time we find a fireplace, the skirmish will likely be over one way or another, so there’ll be no point in Flooing to the Ministry.”</p>
<p>            Harry couldn’t bring himself to answer.  Her logic was foolproof, and that fact made his throat squeeze tight.  He’d brought all of his friends into a battle that none of them were prepared for, and now he’d left them all alone.</p>
<p>            There was no talking the rest of the time.  The only sounds were of the woods around them, their footsteps and their labored breathing.  The sun raced them toward civilization, eventually surpassing them and going onward into the horizon.  Harry wiped the sweat from his brow and brushed aside the strands of his hair that were stuck to his forehead.</p>
<p>            “Harry!”</p>
<p>            Hermione was staring at Harry with eyes as wide as a house-elf’s, her hands clapped over her mouth.  Her face, which had been flushed from their walk, was paling rapidly.</p>
<p>            “What, Hermione?”</p>
<p>            “You-you’re scar!  It’s gone!” she pointed at his forehead.</p>
<p>            Harry’s hand flew to his forehead.  Not that it would do any good; his scar wasn’t tactilely different from the rest of his skin.  They needed to find Dumbledore.</p>
<p>            “We need to find Dumbledore,” Harry said.</p>
<p>            Hermione, still shaken, nodded.  They continued, if not with more urgency than before, then definitely more unsettled.</p>
<p>            They reach the edge of the village at sunset.  Harry is ready to go barreling into the village, but Hermione’s arm holds him back.</p>
<p>            “Harry, we can’t just go storming through the village,” she said. “We’re dirty, injured and have just come stumbling out of the woods.  If a muggle spots us they will likely inform the police, and we don’t have time for that.”</p>
<p>            “So what do you propose we do?” Harry snapped.</p>
<p>            “We need to find a house with some sign of magic.”</p>
<p>            “And if there aren’t any wizards or witches here?”</p>
<p>            At that, Hermione became silent.  Harry realized that there really was no other plan after that.  He felt his frustration with her vanish.  She was every bit distressed as he was.</p>
<p>            “Let’s go,” Harry said.</p>
<p>            They stumbled through maze of cottages, trying to remain hidden.  It was sunset, so thankfully most people must have been inside.  It was a small village.  Quaint.  Something seemed… off, though.  He couldn’t quite put his finger on it, though.  Before he could think about it anymore, his thoughts were suddenly cut short.</p>
<p>            “Hermione!” Harry hissed.</p>
<p>            A small object about a foot long flew over the hedge of a garden with a scream.  It hit the ground with a thump then, after a moment, slowly stood up and stumbled away into the undergrowth.</p>
<p>            “A gnome!” Hermione said with more joy and relief than said creature should ever warrant.</p>
<p>            They tore for the hedge, circling around until they reached a wooden gate.  They both began knocking frantically, beating their fists against the panes of wood.  After what seemed like forever, the gate swung open, revealing a witch in roughly her mid-thirties dressed in rather old-fashioned muggle clothes.  Her hand was in the pocket of the front of her dress, no doubt grasping a wand.</p>
<p>            “What’s the meaning of – what happened to you two?” Her face morphed from wariness to concern.</p>
<p>            Harry was momentarily at a loss for what to say.  How would they explain what had happened to them?</p>
<p>            <em>Excuse us.  We invaded the Ministry earlier today, and got into a confrontation earlier today with Death Eaters in the Department of Mysteries!</em></p>
<p>            Luckily Hermione was quicker on her feet.</p>
<p>            “Please, ma’am.  Something terrible happened and we lost our wands and got separated from our friends.  We just need to use your Floo, please?”</p>
<p>            To Harry’s great surprise, the witch nodded in understanding. “Of course you may.  Bad days, these.  Tragedy waiting around every corner,” she said in a troubled voice.</p>
<p>            Harry felt an unusual mix of confusion, excitement, and hope.  Was this woman one of the people who believed him?  Was she perhaps even part of the Order?  Harry wanted to ask, but the witch didn’t seem to have recognized him yet and Harry was not really in the mood for dealing with her reaction if she did.</p>
<p>            She led them across her yard and through her back door.   They entered a small, cluttered kitchen that reminded Harry strangely of the kitchen at the burrow.  He thought he saw a copy of the Daily Prophet on the kitchen table, but hardly spared it a glance as he followed the woman into a somewhat less cluttered sitting room.  She pulled her wand out of her pocket and pointed it at the fireplace, which immediately blazed to life.  She grabbed a small pot off the mantle and offered it to Harry and Hermione.</p>
<p>            “Here you go, dears.  I assume you know how to use the Floo?”</p>
<p>            “Yes – thank you ma’am,” Harry said.  He grabbed a pinch of Floo and tossed in into the flames and jumped inside with a shout of “Hogsmeade!”</p>
<p>            He flied through the Floo in a familiar spinning sensation.  Fireplace after fireplace whirled past him.  It felt like ages – how far were they from Hogwarts? – but was probably only moments before he was being spat out of the fire and promptly fell flat on his face.</p>
<p>            The force of the impact knocked the air out of his lungs.  He took a deep breath and managed to haul himself into a standing position, only for Hermione to promptly come flying out of the Floo and knock him over again.</p>
<p>            “Sorry!” Hermione squeaked as she got off of him.  She offered him her hand and he grabbed it and she pulled him back up.  All the while Hermione was repeatedly apologizing.</p>
<p>            “Never mind – we need to get to Hogwarts!” he gasped.</p>
<p>            They looked around themselves.  They were in Hogsmeade Station on the platform.  The only thing missing was the Hogwarts Express.  Harry promptly tore down the path that led to Hogwarts, Hermione’s footsteps echoing his behind him.</p>
<p>            The path was considerably longer on foot than in the carriages.  By the time they stopped at the gates, Harry was out of breath and Hermione was clutching a stitch in her side behind him.  Harry stared at the wrought iron gates in frustration.</p>
<p>            “Open up!” he yelled, to no response from the gates. “We need to see Professor Dumbledore!” Still nothing happened.  Harry slumped.</p>
<p>            “We need help!  Please!” Hermione pled.</p>
<p>            Like it was waiting for the magic word, the gates slowly swung open.</p>
<p>            Wasting no time, Harry and Hermione stumbled through the gates and hobbled up the path.  Harry suddenly began to have second thoughts, remembering the Dumbledore that had been ignoring him with a vehemence that had to have been purposeful.  But no, Harry would not let that get to him.  He would make Dumbledore listen if he had to, through any means necessary, consequences be damned.</p>
<p>            They were just hobbling up the steps when the front doors swung open, and Harry felt great relief at the sight of the wise old professor.  Immediately followed by a rush of fear.</p>
<p>            First of all, and it occurred to Harry rather belatedly, last Harry had heard Dumbledore had been sacked and was currently on the run from the Ministry.  Most certainly not available to meet them at the doors.</p>
<p>            Secondly, this Dumbledore was not as old as he should have been.  His face wasn’t nearly as lined as it had been before.  And while his facial hair situation was still wildly out of control, rather than silvery white Dumbledore’s beard was gingery, a color that Harry had only seen it once before.</p>
<p>            “Professor Dumbledore…” said Hermione’s confused voice beside him.</p>
<p>            “Yes, that is my name.  I was alerted that someone at the gates was in need of my assistance.”</p>
<p>            That shook Harry out of his shock. “Professor Dumbledore, Ron, Ginny, Neville, and Luna are in trouble.  Voldemort used his connection to my mind to trick me into thinking that he was holding Sirius hostage in the Department of Mysteries.  It was a trap, Death Eaters ambushed us, trying to make me hand over the prophecy.  We managed to escape, but I think Hermione and I must have landed on a portkey, because we were sent away.”</p>
<p>            Dumbledore was quiet for a long moment, and Harry wondered why he wasn’t doing anything.</p>
<p>            “You two had better come to my office, immediately,” said Dumbledore calmly.</p>
<p>            Harry felt like screaming again. “Aren’t you listening?  People are in danger!”</p>
<p>            “I have every intention of assisting you both.  However, I will need to hear the full story first.  So, if you please.” He turned and started walking toward the marble steps across the Entrance Hall, clearly expecting them to follow.</p>
<p>            Harry looked at Hermione, who he was simultaneously glad to see looked just as confused and concerned as he felt.  What was Dumbledore doing?  Shouldn’t he be springing into action?  Still, it was not as if they had another choice, so Harry took off after the headmaster, Hermione following alongside him, both of them fuming with impatience.</p>
<p>            Harry’s confusion worsened when it became apparent that Dumbledore was not leading him to the stone gargoyle leading to his office.  Instead he led them to an office that Harry distinctly remembered belonging to Professor McGonagall.  When they entered, however, there was the distinct taste of Dumbledore throughout the office.  Strange instruments and books lined shelves on the walls and on the desk there was a bowl of lemon drops.</p>
<p>            Dumbledore sat behind the desk and looked at them with laser-like intensity.  It was a little startling to Harry, who had not been subject to that piercing stare since the end of the previous year.</p>
<p>            “Now,” said Dumbledore. “I need you to explain every single detail to me.  Do not leave anything out.”</p>
<p>            Harry still felt increasingly frustrated and angry by Dumbledore’s lack of immediate action, but immediately set to recounting their tale, with Hermione adding information when she saw fit.  From his vision of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort to them being cornered in the Time Chamber and teleported to the forest.  Dumbledore’s brows rose in interest at that part, and when they had finished, they looked to the headmaster expectantly.</p>
<p>            “Tell me, children, can you tell me the current date?  Month and year, please,” he requested after a moment.</p>
<p>            Harry couldn’t believe it.  Dumbledore actually thought they were crazy.  He opened his mouth to shout when Hermione cut across him.</p>
<p>            “18 June, 1996, sir.”</p>
<p>            Harry stared at her in surprise and noticed that, once again, Hermione had gone pale.</p>
<p>            “That’s what I was afraid of,” said Dumbledore. “It is not 18 June, 1996, dear girl.  It is in fact 18 June, 1942.”</p>
<p>            Harry felt his mind jerk to a stop and his blood run cold.  That was impossible, wasn’t it?  Well, there was Hermione’s time-turner in third year, but that had only been capable of going back several hours.  And that was purposeful, there was no way…</p>
<p>            “About forty-three years ago, there were some experiments conducted in the Department of Mysteries concerning time travel beyond the limits allowed by normal time-turners,” Dumbledore explained. “In the end, the experiments were proved to be too dangerous and were discontinued, with strict laws being placed on any further experimentation.  It would seem, that in your adventure you managed to stumble upon the remnants of these experiments, and managed to activate them to get yourselves sent to the past, the current present.”</p>
<p>            “But we can get back, right?” demanded Harry.  There was a small, wounded sound beside him.</p>
<p>            Dumbledore looked at him sadly. “It is possible for you to be retrieved back to your own time.  However, doing so would incur severe consequences.  I assume that neither of you are familiar with the tale of Madam Eloise Mintumble?” he asked.</p>
<p>            “I-I am,” said Hermione tremulously.</p>
<p>            “Can you recount it for me?”</p>
<p>            “Eloise Mintumble was an unspeakable that was sent back in time in 1899,” Hermione began thickly. “She was sent back nearly five-hundred years, to the year 1402.  She was stuck there for a period of four days.  When she was finally retrieved, her body aged the intervening time, and when she returned she was physically over five-hundred years old.  She died in St Mungo’s soon afterwards.</p>
<p>            “Additionally, her travel in the past and back had major consequences in the present.  The following Tuesday after her return lasted two and a half days, while the next Thursday passed in four hours.  Her presence also greatly affected the lives of all the people she met in the past, and caused no fewer than twenty-five people in the present to be un-born.”</p>
<p>            <em>Terrible things happen to wizards who meddle with time.</em></p>
<p>            Harry’s blood ran cold.  He and Hermione had already no doubt caused a disturbance.  What about that witch who let them borrow use her Floo?  What if she was the mother of somebody important?  Or even the mother of one of his friends?  What if Harry caused one of his friends to be un-born?</p>
<p>            “You will be relieved to know that, since you have gone back fifty-four years rather than five-hundred, the amount of disturbance you can cause is more limited.  You may also take some comfort in the fact that, should you be retrieved you will not be an unserviceable age.  However, you would do best not to take for granted that you will be retrieved.  There is every chance that you have already triggered events that have completely changed the future.”</p>
<p>            “So does that mean we are stuck here?” said Harry.</p>
<p>            “I could, of course, turn you into the Ministry and they could try to send you back to your own time,” said Dumbledore. “But a fair warning, this could lead to even more disastrous consequences for yourself.  You will likely arrive in your time aged fifty-years.  Or worse, actions you have taken in the intervening time between your arrival in this time and your arrival here may have caused you both to be un-born yourselves.  If you remain here, you are exempt from the consequences on the future.  If you leave, you may be flinging yourselves out of existence entirely.”</p>
<p>            Harry and Hermione looked at each other, and Harry could see his devastation reflected in her eyes.</p>
<p>            “I do not envy your positions.,” said Dumbledore solemnly. “However, I will be happy to offer you sanctuary here at Hogwarts.  We will need to take some precautions, and a cover story will be needed – the potential for disaster if your true origins were discovered is high.  Term will be ending tomorrow and the school will be empty except for a few staff.  If you like, I can help devise a new background.”</p>
<p>            Hermione seemed to have frozen solid, and Harry was not much better. “Thank you, sir,” Harry choked out.</p>
<p>            Dumbledore nodded. “Of course.  We will need to find new lodgings for you for the time being.  Seeing as all of the dormitories are still occupied…”</p>
<p>            “I think I know a place, sir,” said Harry.</p>
<p align="center">~0oo0~</p>
<p>            Harry sat stock still at the edge of a bed conjured by the Room of Requirement.  After spending a good amount of time commenting on the astounding magic of the Room, Dumbledore had left Harry and Hermione in peace.  He could hear the running water of the shower in the adjoining bathroom – also conjured by the room – where Hermione was.  The Room of Requirement really was a godsend, because it also provided Harry and Hermione with amenities such as pajamas and toothbrushes.  Harry wondered if they could take objects conjured in the Room outside, because it had occurred to Harry that neither of them have any money whatsoever.</p>
<p>            They were stuck here.  Unless someone fetched them, which was still bad because it would mean Harry and Hermione aging over fifty years in the process.  Or they would stay here, stuck in the past forever.  No money or other resources, and most of their friends are not even alive yet.  If they screwed up, they may never be alive.</p>
<p>            Harry is brought out of his thoughts by the sound of the water turning off.  He felt terrible.  Hermione had it so much worse than him – she had parents, a family.  If Harry hadn’t dragged her down with him…</p>
<p>            Hermione walked out of the bathroom, her head wrapped up into the twisty-thing Petunia used to dry her hair when it was wet and wrapped in a dressing gown.</p>
<p>            “Are you okay, Hermione?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>            “Fine,” Hermione said, not sounding it at all. “I’ve been giving our backstory some thought,” she continued. “I was thinking we should pretend to be related.  Twins, possibly, although considering we look nothing alike outside of our ethnicity that could be a hard sell.  Anyways, my idea is that we were homeschooled by our family, but a disaster caused us to be orphaned.  It’s close enough to the truth, in any case,” her voice cracked on the last sentence.</p>
<p>            Harry felt another stab of guilt. “Look, Hermione, I’m –“</p>
<p>            “Do not tell me you’re sorry,” Hermione said, her voice suddenly hard. “You did not intentionally send us back in time.  It was nothing but an unfortunate accident that happened while you were trying to save me.  I do not blame you, and I refuse to allow you to blame yourself.”</p>
<p>            “But..”</p>
<p>            <em>“Harry.”</em></p>
<p>            Harry clamped his mouth shut.  The way she said his name promised violence if he continued to argue.  That’s okay, though.  Harry is very capable of wallowing in guilt on his own.</p>
<p>            “I can<em> hear</em> you brooding.”</p>
<p>            “Sorry.”</p>
<p>            “<em>That</em> I can allow you to apologize for.”</p>
<p align="center">~0oo0~</p>
<p>            For a moment when Harry awoke the next morning, Harry forgot that his entire life had basically ended.  He forgot that he was stranded, probably forever, in 1942 with only one friend left in the entire world.  Reality always comes crashing back, though, so Harry found himself awake and miserable.  Hermione was awake also, already dressed in pristine new robes.</p>
<p>            “You’d better get dressed, Harry,” said Hermione. “Professor Dumbledore said that we need to be awake by the time the Hogwarts Express leaves.”</p>
<p>            Harry groaned, wishing he could just forget reality for a little while longer.  He eventually gave in and dragged himself to full wakefulness.  Padding into the bathroom, Harry brushed his teeth, washed his face, didn’t bother with his hair, and got dressed.  When he left the bathroom again, he was both surprised and not to see Dumbledore already there, sitting on a bed opposite from Hermione.</p>
<p>            “Good morning, Mr Potter,” Dumbledore greeted him.</p>
<p>            “Good morning, Professor,” said Harry, taking a seat beside Hermione.</p>
<p>            “As I promised yesterday, Professor Dippet is perfectly affable to giving you both sanctuary here.  He wishes to speak to you, and so I told him I would come down here to wake you up and am currently allowing you to dress,” his eyes gave a familiar twinkle. “Now, Miss Granger here has given me the rundown of your proposed backstory.  I found it quite impressive, but would like to make a few suggestions of my own.  Mainly cosmetic.”</p>
<p>            “Please do,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>            “You suggest that you pose as family – twins, to be exact.  Which is advantageous because it keeps your backstory simple.  The one flaw I would suggest is that you two do not physically resemble each other.  It would still be possible to pass you off as fraternal twins, but there is a large issue in your appearance, Harry.”</p>
<p>            “My appearance?” Harry tried not to sound too offended.</p>
<p>            “Rest assured, I do not mean to insult,” Dumbledore insisted, twinkling like nobody’s business. “The crux is that you physically resemble what I assume is your paternal family to a rather large extent.  Had it not been for your difference in age and eye color, I may have mistaken you for Fleamont or Charlus.”</p>
<p>            “Oh,” said Harry. “Yeah, I see how that could be a problem.”</p>
<p>            “I do have a possible remedy to the problem, but I am afraid you may have some moral objections to it,” said Dumbledore seriously. “Have any of you ever heard of Genus Merger?”</p>
<p>            Harry most certainly hadn’t.  He looked to Hermione and saw that, for once, she was as clueless as he was.</p>
<p>            “I would suppose not.  It was been outlawed by the Ministry for several years in this time.  You see, Genus Merger is a potion, which shares some similarities with polyjuice.  However, there are three key differences.</p>
<p>            “One, instead of changing your appearance to match another you are in fact merging your DNA with that of another person.  You will still retain your own personality and many of your physical qualities, but will also take on physical qualities of the other person.  In essence, you will become blood family.</p>
<p>            “Second, the effects of Genus Merger are absolutely permanent.  There is no known antidote once it has been imbibed and you will remain with the effects of the potion for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>            “Third, rather than hair or toenail clippings, Genus Merger requires the addition of blood.  It is this component that resulted in the Ministry labelling Genus Merger as Dark Magic.”</p>
<p>            “So I drink it and I’ll become related to Hermione?” said Harry.</p>
<p>            “Yes, although I’m proposing that you both take the potion to imbibe the other’s DNA.  Otherwise, say in the example you’ve just given, if your blood was tested against each other it would identify Miss Granger as your mother rather than your sister.”</p>
<p>            “I don’t know…” Hermione said. “It’s not that I’m opposed to having you as a brother, Harry,” she explained, “It’s just… a very big decision.  And where are you planning to get this potion?” Hermione addressed the question to Dumbledore.</p>
<p>            “Understandably, we need to keep the knowledge of your true background limited to as few people as possible,” Dumbledore told them. “Therefore, I would like to forgo asking our Potions Master for assistance.  I propose that I may brew it myself – I am not a Potions Master by profession, but I do have knowledge and ability in the field.”</p>
<p>            “You did discover the twelve uses for dragon’s blood,” conceded Hermione.</p>
<p>            “I do?  I am on eight, currently,” said Dumbledore, a twinkle back in his eye.  He became serious again. “Of course, there is no need to make this decision now.  In another similarity to polyjuice, Genus Merger takes a minimum of one month to brew.”</p>
<p>            “What about in the meantime, sir?” said Harry. “I’m assuming Headmaster Dippet won’t want to wait a month to meet us.  I also assume he’ll notice if we change our appearance in a month’s time.”</p>
<p>            “He will not, and he most certainly will,” Dumbledore confirmed. “However, I do believe I have a temporary solution for that as well.  A special charm that I invented in my days of mischievous youth.  A glamour that will prevent other humans from completely registering your appearance, while at the same time not noticing that they are not registering it.”</p>
<p>            “So, it will allow them to see us without actually seeing us,” Hermione summarized.</p>
<p>            “Exactly, Miss Granger,” said Dumbledore. “If asked to describe you, they will only be able to describe you in the most superficial of terms.”</p>
<p>            “That’s brilliant,” said Harry.</p>
<p>            “Thank you, dear boy,” said Dumbledore. “It does have one caveat, though.  The charm is ineffective against someone whom you have already met.  However, seeing as the only people in this time you have met are me, each other, and the witch who assisted you yesterday, I believe we are safe in this course.”</p>
<p>            When Harry and Hermione both agreed, Dumbledore took out his wand.  Notably, not the same wand Dumbledore possessed in 1996.  Before Harry can ask, or even how to phrase the question, Dumbledore said “Hold completely still, please” and pointed his wand at them.  With a look of concentration on his face, Dumbledore moved the wand in a slow circle around each of their faces in turn.  When the spell was cast on him, Harry had a feeling of a very warm breeze hitting his face, although not a hair on his head was disturbed.</p>
<p>            “That will do,” said Dumbledore before standing up. “Come along, now.  We need to be seeing the Headmaster.”</p>
<p>            He led them through the familiar halls; Hogwarts did not change much between 1942 and 1995.  The same paintings still stared out at them curiously.  The same tapestries and suits of armor hung and stood in the same places.</p>
<p>            Dumbledore led them up to the stone gargoyle that guarded the Headmaster’s office.  He told it the password (“Single malt whiskey’) and led them up the spiraling stairs.  Dumbledore knocked on the great wooden door, and pushed it open when an elderly man’s voice beckoned him in.</p>
<p>            “Ah, Horace, Estella, Galatea, I did not know you would be here,” said Dumbledore in surprise.</p>
<p>            Four people waited for them inside the office, two men and two women.  A man dressed in midnight blue robes with gold embroidering, clearly Professor Dippet, sat behind the desk that Dumbledore would occupy years later.  He was extremely old, with long white hair and a beard a great deal shorter than Dumbledore’s; pale, wrinkled skin that held a slight olive tone; and dark brown eyes.  On his left stood a very fat man with straw blond hair and a bristly mustache who reminded Harry distinctly of a walrus.  A bony old woman was pacing off to the right.  She turned to face them upon her entrance, and she gave off such a stern impression that Harry was immediately reminded painfully of Professor McGonagall.  The second woman with grey-streaked, chin-length curly light brown hair was somewhat slumped in a seat in front of the desk.  She straightened when they entered.</p>
<p>            “They are all the Head of Houses, Albus.  I thought it be best if they were all made aware of the situation,” said Professor Dippet.</p>
<p>            “Of course,” Dumbledore said, recovering with aplomb. “Mister and Miss Granger, I’d like to introduce you to some of the fine Professors here at Hogwarts.  This is Professor Slughorn, the Potions Master here and also the Head of Slytherin – “</p>
<p>            The walrus-man gave them both a nod and friendly smile.  He was such a huge departure from what Harry thought when he heard the words “Head of Slytherin” that he couldn’t do more than stare.</p>
<p>            “Professor Galatea Merrythought, our Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor and Head of Ravenclaw – “</p>
<p>            The old woman was eyeing them somewhat suspiciously, but nodded to them all the same.</p>
<p>            “And the tired young woman here is Professor Estella Scopes, our Astronomy Professor and the Head of Hufflepuff.”</p>
<p>            Professor Scopes giggled. “You do flatter me, Albus,” she said, flashing him a wide smile before getting off her share and stepping forward to shake Harry and Hermione’s hands. “A pleasure to meet you both, I’m sure.  Why don’t the two of you have a seat?”</p>
<p>            “Yes, why don’t you,” said Professor Dippet, “I believe you both have quite a story to tell us.”</p>
<p>            Harry and Hermione nervously sat down across from Professor Dippet, with Hermione taking Professor Scope’s vacated seat and Harry the one beside it.</p>
<p>            “Now, can you tell us where you come from and how you came to be here?”</p>
<p>            “We lived in a small community on the outskirts of Bath,” said Hermione. It was clearly significant, because there were immediate frowns and pitying looks from the Professors. “We were homeschooled by our family members.  Until one day…”</p>
<p>            “You poor dears,” said Professor Scopes.</p>
<p>            Professor Galatea stared at them in horror. “You two have been on your own for a month?”</p>
<p>            “We still lived with our grandfather,” Harry jumped in. “Until just a week ago he… disappeared.”</p>
<p>            Professor Slughorn asked “Do you know where he may have gone?” at the same time as Professor Merrythought said “What did your father do for a living?”</p>
<p>            “He was an expert on ancient magical artefacts,” said Hermione.  Professor Merrythought’s face immediately turned grimly understanding. “We don’t know where he could have gone.  Grandfather was a bit of a recluse, see.  And more than a little paranoid – didn’t really trust institutions or other wizards outside of the family.  I don’t even think he attended Hogwarts,” she added, addressing Professor Slughorn this time.  Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw Professor Dumbledore give them an approving nod.</p>
<p>            “I am very sorry for your loss,” said Professor Dippet. “Although, if I may ask, if your grandfather had such a big distrust of institutions, what brought you both to decide to come here to Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>            “We couldn’t think of anywhere else to go,” said Harry.</p>
<p>            Professor Slughorn actually conjured a tissue to blow his nose with.  Professor Dippet nodded. “In that case, we will be glad to offer you both sanctuary.  Albus will need to inform the Ministry, and you’ll need to join classes, which will likely be an adjustment.  If you need any help, feel free to consult with any of the Professors.  Tell me, when are your birthdays?”</p>
<p>            “The nineteenth of September, for the both of us,” Hermione said without missing a beat.</p>
<p>            “And the year?”</p>
<p>            “1926,” Hermione said again without missing a beat.</p>
<p>            “So you will be entering sixth year…”</p>
<p>            “If I may be so bold, Armando,” said Professor Dumbledore. “Might I suggest that these two enter fifth year, instead?  They did not have the chance to complete their Ordinary Wizarding Levels, and they will likely appreciate the extra year to make up any discrepancies in their former curriculum.”</p>
<p>            Professor Dippet narrowed his eyes shrewdly. “Are you two in agreement with this?” he addressed Harry and Hermione.</p>
<p>            Harry and Hermione shared a brief look and Harry could tell neither of them wanted to take their OWLs again so soon.  They both nodded.</p>
<p>            Professor Dippet nodded. “Very well.  We will need to test you in, I propose around mid-July so you have time to study the material.</p>
<p>            “For now, I think that’s enough for today.  Albus, you mentioned you have quarters arranged for the summer?”</p>
<p>            “I do.”</p>
<p>            “Very good.  You both are dismissed.”</p>
<p>            Harry and Hermione both got up to leave, with Dumbledore following.  Their walk back to the Room of Requirement was silent.  When they re-entered, everything was the same as when they had left.</p>
<p>            “You two did very well, today,” said Professor Dumbledore. “I propose that you work on the rest of the backstory.  Not that you should tell everything to everybody that asks.  The best lies provide as little disprovable information as possible.”</p>
<p>            “Yes, sir,” they both said.</p>
<p>            “I would also like to suggest that, during the summer, you both allow me to teach you both Occlumency.”</p>
<p>            Harry winced. “Someone already tried to teach me Occlumency, sir.  I’m afraid I wasn’t very good at it,” he said.  He ignored the look Hermione threw him.</p>
<p>            “Then we should hope that you have a better response to my teaching methods than your previous mentors,” Dumbledore remarked. “It is imperative that we keep your origins secret, for your own safety.”</p>
<p>            “Yes, sir,” Harry said, not seeing another choice even if he wasn’t looking forward to attempting to learn Occlumency again.</p>
<p>            Dumbledore nodded. “I need to go prepare to brew the Genus Merger potion – think hard on whether you decide to use it.  Keep in mind, it is not a potion one should consider lightly.” His gaze turned solemn. “I do not envy you both your lot in life.  But I promise that I will assist you both in any way I can.” With that, the Professor shut the door behind him with a small but resounding <em>click</em>.</p>
