    <p>Touched By Death – Chapter 1</p><p>Harry Potter honestly didn’t know what to think, first was that the Chamber of Secrets was opened. A chamber that nobody knew the location to. And from what they were told in class, it was a secret chamber created by the founder Salazar Slytherin. And apparently there was something that was attacking all the muggleborns in the school. And from what was said from Albus Dumbledore, Mrs. Norris was only petrified. It was that fact that confused the Gryffindor, if this monster was supposed to kill muggleborns, why was a cat attacked?</p><p>Harry’s friends didn’t have an answer about what happened, though they didn’t talk much about what they had seen. Unless you counted Ron’s mumbling that it had to be a Slytherin. Harry didn’t respond to the mumbling but silently agreed. As it did say the Heir of Slytherin, so it had to be someone in the house of Slytherin.</p><p>They didn’t talk about possible Slytherins for the Heir till a few days later after the events had settled in. The three second-year Gryffindors didn’t know many Slytherins except for a select few. Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Patsy. Harry had known a few more because of being on the Quidditch team. But that hadn’t helped much. The only older Slytherin that came to mind was last month when Malfoy announced as the new seeker. Oliver Wood had called someone Flint, the Slytherin Quidditch captain Harry had assumed. He didn’t seem too bad, he had at least been civil unlike a certain Slytherin he knew. It had almost seemed Flint was less hostile than the Gryffindor captain. The 12-year-old doubted that his two friends would share his opinion.</p><p>But Harry doubted that any Slytherin would willingly share any information with him, he was a Gryffindor after all, not to forget the Boy-Who-Lived. A title that the 12-year-old hated, after all it was the reason his parents were dead. So naturally Harry’s two friends had concluded that Draco Malfoy had to be the heir. Harry didn’t really include his input, but who else could it be? As Ron had said, Malfoy had said, ‘<em>you’ll be next mudbloods.’</em></p><p>And it was then that Hermione had brought up the idea that they could brew the Polyjuice Potion, a potion that let you shape your physical features to look like another. It was an intriguing plan, but Harry felt like they were going to get caught. After all, brewing the Polyjuice Potion was an advanced potion, certainly not something you learn to brew in your first or second year. And the fact that the book was located in the restricted section, what professor would be dumb enough to let a second year in that section? That was when Harry almost had to bite his tongue, his thoughts answered his question. Who else? Lockhart…</p><p>It seemed that Hermione had the same thinking, besides her infatuation with the fraud professor. Most of the girls in the school if not all had a crush on that fraud. Therefore, she had a note clutched in her hand with the professor’s signature, of course that man didn’t bother looking what book Hermione requested to check out.</p><p>And that lead them to what was happening now, the potion was already half finished and at the Dueling club. Though there wasn’t any information who was leading the club, though Hermione was determined it had to Professor Flitwick, a Master of Charms and Duelist. It was they discovered that Lockhart was leading the club that Harry almost wanted to run out the doors. He had already dealt with how much magic that man knew, seeing that he didn’t know a single healing spell and wound up with no bones. Sadly, Hermione didn’t see it that way and forced both him and Ron to stay.</p><p>It was after the Dueling Club ended, that Harry realized that he should have ran for the doors despite Hermione’s protests. The reason for that was, he had spoken Parseltongue to the snake that Malfoy had summoned to prevent it from attacking Justin. The staring and looks of horror had been the final straw for the small Gryffindor, he had practically bolted off the stage and out of the doors. Nobody bothered to stop the Potter heir as he headed straight for the Gryffindor common room, in his mind the only place of solace. But he knew the first thing that people would think, he was the Heir of Slytherin. The Gryffindor wasn’t daft, he knew there be a reason why Slytherin’s symbol was a snake.</p><p>Ron and Hermione didn’t spare as second, they raced out the same doors that Harry fled through. They knew they needed to talk to him, the two friends had seen the frightened look at the raven headed boy.</p><p>“Harry,” Hermione gasped as she saw the 12-year-old almost curled into himself on the red chair by the fire.</p><p>“They think I’m the Heir, don’t they,” he mumbled quietly.</p><p>Hermione nodded as Ron looked at Harry grimly. “How are you a Parselmouth, Harry?”</p><p>That actually got Harry to look at them in confusion, “a what?”</p><p>“Parselmouth?” Ron repeated as he looked at his best mate.</p><p>“That you can speak to snakes,” Hermione explained gently.</p><p>Harry fiddled with his uniform, “I don’t know… I found out before I was eleven when I accidently let a python loose in a zoo. I honestly thought it was just my imagination, the relatives weren’t very happy.”</p><p>Hermione’s expression looked stricken.</p><p>“I know that Slytherin’s symbol is a snake, I’m guessing people will think I want everyone dead…” Harry muttered.</p><p>Hermione looked surprised that he clued that in, “we know you aren’t the heir, Harry. Anyone who knows you, knows that. But yes, people will start to think you’re the heir of Slytherin, seeing as Salazar lived thousands of years ago.”</p><p>“It’s going to be like first year all over again, won’t it?” Harry looked back up at his friends.</p><p>Ron nodded but didn’t say anything, what could he say? Hermione looked to be in the same dilemma. What could his friends say, the school was going to be under the impression that he wanted the school’s muggleborns dead.</p><p>Harry finally uncurled his body and muttered a good night as he went into the second-year boy’s dorms.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>It was when Harry wake up that he noticed the silence in the dormitory. All the boys were awake, even Ron, but Neville, Dean, and Seamus refused to look at him and quickly left the dorm.</p><p>Harry left out a sigh, “even they don’t want to be near me.”</p><p>Ron looked at Harry in shock, “then they don’t know you.”</p><p>Harry briefly smiled at Ron in gratitude, “thanks Ron. I don’t know what I do without you and Hermione.”</p><p>“Let’s go get Hermione and head to breakfast, I’m starving.”</p><p>Harry let out a laugh, “least we know one thing that doesn’t change.”</p><p>Ron looked confused.</p><p>“Your stomach, Ron,” Harry grinned before Ron chuckled.</p><p>Hermione wound up meeting both boys at the exit to the Gryffindor Common Room. Though she easily noticed at nobody would look or meet Harry in the eye. She had to roll her eyes, <em>‘did they really think a 12-year-old could be responsible for that stupid chamber?’</em> Obviously if their reactions were nothing to go by… That was when she proceeded to drag both boys down to the Great Hall and was met with whispers and nervous glances.</p><p>“I’m never going to get a break, am I?” Harry whispered to Hermione.</p><p>“I’m sorry Harry, I wish there was something we could do?” the young girl replied.</p><p>Suddenly Harry felt like something was watching him, before he scoffed, who wouldn’t be watching him. He glanced behind him towards the Slytherin table but couldn’t find why he felt like this intense stare was narrowed at him. Ignoring the looks, did Harry try to eat his breakfast. Yet the queasiness never left him as he glanced at his two friends before darting out of the Great Hall.</p><p>Harry needed a moment to himself as he hid behind a tapestry and let out a deep breath. He felt a little shaky and it was like a moment of déjà vu of the loss of one-hundred fifty points. The whole school had been against him because they had left Slytherin be so far in the lead for the House Cup. The Gryffindor felt miserable, he knew that he was to blame about the points. But this felt like it was totally out of his control, he just wanted to have a normal life. Course nothing could be normal for him… First was having relatives that hate magic, a dark wizard wanted to kill him, and it felt like people were turning on him at every turn. Everyone except for Ron and Hermione, and yet he was terrified that they would leave him too. Why did this have to happen to him…</p><p>Harry’s inner turmoil had made him loose track of time before he realized that Hermione and Ron had to be worried where he had gone off to. He knew that his first class was Transfiguration and decided to head there, seeing it was on the first floor. When he walked inside the classroom, Harry was automatically met with glares from Gryffindors and Ravenclaws both. The only caring glance was from Hermione and Ron, who had sat near the back. Both were fully aware of his intention to avoid attention. But what made Harry want to sink deeper in his seat was the wary look from Professor McGonagall. The Gryffindor’s heart sank, his own Head of House didn’t even believe that he wasn’t the Heir of Slytherin.</p><p>Harry knew from Hermione’s look that she seen the look McGonagall had given and her expression was sad. It was one thing to have your own peers turn against you, but to have your teachers do the same was heartbreaking.</p><p>The young Potter heir didn’t bother paying attention, it wasn’t like McGonagall would draw attention to him. If Harry had to give a word to the look he got from Head of Gryffindor, it had to be distrustful, wary, or disappointed. He knew automatically that his professor was just like the rest of the students, they thought him as guilty.</p><p>After class did Hermione track Harry down before he could try to find another place to hide, besides Gryffindor Tower.</p><p>“Don’t let it bother you, Harry. We’re still here for you and the potion will be done by Christmas. Then we can find out if Malfoy really is the Heir or not,” Hermione voice was gentle. “Do you want some company?”</p><p>Harry immediately felt guilty, he had tried to slip away from the very people that was on his side. But he couldn’t help it, the stares and intense glares were getting to him bad. And he just wanted to be away and calm down and that urge was strong. So, without any words, he briefly nodded, and Hermione’s expression brightened.</p><p>It was in a hidden corner in the library that Harry spoke softly, “I’m sorry…”</p><p>“What are you talking about?” Hermione asked.</p><p>“The glaring and stares are getting too much. And I didn’t even think what you guys would think when I slipped away on my own…” Harry muttered as he looked at Hermione and Ron.</p><p>“Everyone needs a breather, Harry. Especially you. Just know we’re there for you.”</p><p>Harry brightened before asking, “so you think the potion will be done this soon?”</p><p>Hermione nodded, “should be able to use it Christmas, though it may be tricky as we don’t know where the Slytherin Common Room is.”</p><p>Harry looked thoughtful, “we should be able to just follow Malfoy to the Common Room, I doubt he’ll suspect a thing.”</p><p>Seeing that Harry was in a more cheerful mood, she talked more about what the monster could be.</p><p>“It has to be something ancient and lived for thousands of years. But it could be under a preservation charm and a strong one,” Hermione thought out loud.</p><p>Harry and Ron didn’t bother saying anything, but it did make a little sense what she was saying.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>It would be the following days that would make Harry a little more skittish to be around his own house and the others as well.</p><p>For one there had been another attack, Justin and Sir Nick, the Gryffindor Ghost. And once again the houses blamed the small second year. Though it was a small blessing that the Slytherin never seemed to buy in the ideology that Harry was the Heir. At least from his own perspective.</p><p>That was brought down to this moment, Harry was fleeing the corridors in a fast pace run. The reason behind the running was the upper years had resorted to cursing him wherever he went, unless there was a professor around. It seemed innocent so far, tripping jinxes, leg-locker curse, the full body bind, disarming jinx. That was the reason why Harry was terrified and running, he had seen a hex aimed at him and it looked lethal as he dodged it. It looked to create a burn on the wall that was too close for his liking. While running Harry had to quickly glance to back to see if they were still behind him, it looked as if the group of three was gaining speed. Perhaps a third or fourth years in black robes trimmed with red and blue. They were older Gryffindors and Ravenclaws that thought it be right to tell the boy what they thought of him being the Heir of Slytherin. It was around the corner that Harry had to take his chance. It was either to be cursed, miss the tunnel and be knocked unconscious, or make it to safety. There was a tunnel that took the appearance of a wall and could be found as soon as you turned to the right around the corner. The smaller Gryffindor practically dived into the hidden tunnel and pressed himself against the wall as he knocked his head. It created an intense headache, but it was better than what was chasing him in the corridors. Holding his breath so not to reveal his new hiding place did he hear furious running past where he had fallen to. Finally let out a sigh of relief did Harry close his eyes and try to will the intense pain away. It didn’t work but Harry let his body fall to the side, completely on the cold, stone floor. And let the pain take him to unconsciousness and would later worry about the conversation that he would have with Hermione later.</p>
