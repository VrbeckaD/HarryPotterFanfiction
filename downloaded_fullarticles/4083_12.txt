<p>His breath smelled heavy with cigarettes and alcohol and Draco knew that this was going to be quick. He himself hadn't a lot to drink but definitely felt the effect of the wine inside his veins. He would've typically picked something stronger, like Firewhiskey, but tonight he felt posh and planned to keep his cool even under the weight of this burly, long-bearded man with thick hands and thick arms.<br/>
It hadn't been five minutes into their conversation at the bar when Draco had followed him outside to apparate to the stranger’s flat.</p>
<p>He was scared and excited all at once.</p>
<p>He was pushed onto his back on top of the bed that was only half-covered with wrinkled, grey sheets. The husky male grabbed both sides of Draco's head, almost covering it entirely, and crashed his lips hard against his. It was warm and wet and Draco suffocated under the heavy, sour breath. He struggled to breathe and let out a desperate moan in his throat. The man pulled up and stared intently into Draco's eyes.<br/>
“Are you hard?” As he reached down between his legs, Draco quickly grabbed his arm.<br/>
“Wait. I need to tell you something first.”<br/>
The man sighed impatiently. “I don't like talking.”<br/>
“I understand,” Draco quickly replied before any of them changed their minds. “We agreed. Less talk, more fucking. But this is important and it's something I tell all my partners.” It was half a lie as Draco hadn't had a sexual partner in a very long time. He'd never admit that to a man like this one.<br/>
“What is it, do you have a contagious disease?”<br/>
“No!” Again, Draco cut him off quickly. “No. Not at all. I'm just...I'm...I'm born...”<br/>
The man enveloped his giant hand on Draco's crotch, cutting off his words along with his dignity.<br/>
“Get off me!!” Draco yelled, pulling himself higher onto the mattress as the man's face dropped from pleasure to shock.<br/>
“What the fuck! Where the fuck is your cock?!” Draco remained silent, his heart beating frantically inside his chest. The man grabbed him again; this time with an intention to hurt him.<br/>
“Where the fuck is your fucking cock you freak?!”<br/>
“Get your filthy hand off me!” Draco's voice was shrill and desperate. As he struggled, the man's other hand pushed down his chest, pinning him to the bed, while he continued fondling him with the other.<br/>
“What are you, you fucking freak?!”<br/>
“Stop it, get off me you savage! You fucking monster!” The man let go of Draco's genitals and punched him hard, blackening his vision. Draco was terrified and wasn't able to move. He willed himself to apparate, to do anything to get out of this. He wanted to scream and cry but knew that nobody would hear him. In the darkness, he felt his body being cut and slashed and finally screamed with all his might at the very top of his lungs.</p>
