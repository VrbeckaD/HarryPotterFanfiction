    <p align="JUSTIFY">Draco had seen him trip over legs, fall down stairs, tremble under his own gaze, bunny-hop down the hall, chased by laughter.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">He had seen him fall from his broom, whimper in pain from a broken wrist, blow up cauldrons, take Snape's harsh reprimand on shaking legs.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">He had seen him run away from him and Crabbe und Goyle several times, seen him wince the moment he set eyes on him, squeak with fear when he had sneaked up on him in the Forbidden Forest and whispered a "boo".</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Draco had seen him cry, tremble, whimper, weak and pathetic – and in this instance, when everything he himself had been reduced to was this trembling, whimpering, weak and pathetic mess standing next to his parents and people he despised – in this instance he stepped forward with a firm stance, a gaze so fierce it burnt holes into the air, not a single finger shaking, and told that monster to fuck off.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">It was the first time Draco realised that there were choices you could make, simply out of your own free will. Even if it meant you had to pay for them, to endure the punishment: it's been your choice and if you don't regret it even a burning hat and a Body-Bind Curse can't break you.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><br/>

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">When they were leaving seconds later, his father trying to take his hand and he beat it away, Draco looked down on himself for not realising earlier that he himself had had a choice too.</p>
