    <p>Ben was a bit of a simpleton. He woke up at six every morning, had a cup of tea, combed his hair and went through his day like it was just a natural reflex. Ben’s life was pretty normal. Until he got that letter.</p><p>He could recount the day it landed on his desk like it had just happened. It had scared the living daylights out of him, also scaring his dogs Barry and Lyon into a barking frenzy. He couldn’t even approach the owl for twenty minutes, instead choosing to cower behind his pillow in the corner. The owl eventually gave up with sticking its leg out and dropped the letter, flying out of the window as if it was something it did every day.</p><p> Finally, Ben managed to sprint to his desk, snatch the letter, and sprint back to the corner, waiting another twenty minutes before opening it. It had been a life changing day for him, but it was one he had looked back on with fondness. Now in his sixth year, Ben considered himself a lot braver than what he used to be. Sure, he still flinched whenever Merula took out her wand in the hallway, but he knew his amazing friends would be there to protect him, including one friend in particular.</p><p>Ashlin Ni Liongish had been his best friend for six years now, always suprising him with her kind heart and at times, childish antics. It wasn’t hard to love her, and yes, he did love her. Admitting it to himself took more bravery than facing a hundred Merula’s would ever take.</p><p>She was simply stunning. But he knew deep down he didn’t stand a chance. He was…. well him. Plain, old, Ben copper. The scaredy cat muggleborn. It was quite disheartening really, but he had gotten used to hiding it.</p><p>Speak of the devil, Ashlin chose walking into the common room while Ben was drying his pants near the fire, as the perfect time. It was to his horror that he realised to late when he heard her giggle from behind. “You okay there, Ben? And why are you drying your pants near the fire?” He quickly grabbed them out of the air and hid them behind his back, plastering an awkward smile over his face before replying, “O-oh, its nothing. Just Merula being her usual, nosey self”. A murderous look passed over Ashlins face, causing her to clench her wand in anger. “Merula, that…that witch! Don’t worry Ben, I’ll get back at that conniving Slytherin”. Ashlin then stormed towards the door, making Ben freeze in horror. If Ashlin ever found out why Merula had teased him, she’d never look at him again.</p><p>You see, Merula had a habit of sticking her nose in places it didn’t belong. Most of the other houses ignored her, but every so often she managed to dig up some juicy gossip that had everyone intrigued. This time, poor Ben was stuck in the middle. The only other soul in the castle that knew of Ben’s crush, was his other best friend, Rowan. She had sworn herself to secrecy and had managed to hold her tongue for three years. Ben had to admit, he was quite impressed with her secret keeping skills. But he knew it wouldn’t last.</p><p>Rowan had told Nearly Headless Nick in confidence of Ben’s love for his best friend, and as ghosts do, Nick had told another ghost of the news he deemed, ‘’party worthy’’.  As fate would have it, Merula unfortunately had overheard while tormenting a first year and sought out Ben immediately to embarrass him. He thanked the lucky stars Ashlin wasn’t with him, because he honestly would have curled into a little ball and died from the embarrassment</p><p>She sent a curse right at him as he was exiting the library, unfortunately making him… wet himself. If that wasn’t bad enough, Snape waltzed around the corner with his usual, ‘im constantly depressed and hate everyone’ look plastered on his face. He took one look at Ben, then ordered him back to his common room to dry off. It was a disasterous day, and to think Ben was beginning to believe his luck was turning. Oh well, guess he’ll just have to move to Mexico and change his name. Right after his best friend disowned him and the entire student cohort and staff had a good old laugh at him. Probably have Dumbledore hold a ‘Roast Ben Copper’ night.</p><p> </p><p>The magical world just really did not like him.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
