    <p>Draco stood from his chair in front of the fire and headed for the entrance to the common room. “I’ll be back later.” He said to the other Slytherins, getting a few murmured responses.</p><p> </p><p>Blaise hadn’t returned from dinner, and he wondered why, but he had to get to Shiloe’s room before he was late, so he didn’t have time to worry about his friend’s whereabouts. He didn’t have to worry at all, though, as he found the black teen slowly heading in the same direction he was, though he was a few corridors away from the common room.</p><p> </p><p>“You wouldn’t happen to be heading to the fourth floor, would you?” He asked Blaise casually.</p><p> </p><p>Blaise smiled in relief. “You, too?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>Draco nodded. “Of course. There isn’t a creature on this Earth that can resist the charm of Malfoys.” He replied, striking a pose in the deserted corridor and running a hand through his hair dramatically. “We’re drop-dead gorgeous, after all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, keep telling yourself that, Dray.” Blaise joked, falling into step beside the blond. “I’m glad you’ll be there.” He admitted softly.</p><p> </p><p>Draco smiled and grabbed his hand, giving it a brief squeeze before dropping it. “I promised to watch over you, didn’t I? I don’t want anything else to happen to you.” He said seriously.</p><p> </p><p>Blaise sighed. “About that… He’s mine. My Mate.” He whispered, causing Draco to nearly fall down the stairs they were ascending.</p><p> </p><p>“Really?!”</p><p> </p><p>Blaise nodded. “And the Host isn’t.” He added.</p><p> </p><p>Draco hummed. “I see. That’s strange. I suppose it will all work out, though, or nature wouldn’t have planned things this way.” He said lightly. “About that, things still going well? You’re taking your medicine, right?” He checked.</p><p> </p><p>Blaise shivered at the reminder of the flavour of Wolfsbane. “Ugh, don’t remind me. Yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>“No unfortunate side effects?” Draco checked.</p><p> </p><p>Blaise sighed. “Well, aside from the anal leakage-“</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, sorry I asked, Merlin, I was just showing concern!” Draco exclaimed as Blaise softly chuckled.</p><p> </p><p>“You left yourself wide open, I couldn’t resist.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco and Blaise stopped in front of the portrait Shiloe had mentioned. “So, where do you think the rooms are?”</p><p> </p><p>They both turned as a door opened across the hall from the portrait, and they had their answer, as Shiloe appeared in the doorway.</p><p> </p>
