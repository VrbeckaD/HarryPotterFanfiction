    <p class="p1">They are lying in another man’s bed, again. Harry looked over at their new- soon to be old- partner’s sleeping face, sighed, and kissed his forehead before departing.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Pants, check.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Trousers, check.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Shirt.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Where’s their shirt?</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Great. Can’t find their goddamn shirt anywhere, and they were starting to think that it would be better if they could just start bringing their wand along to Muggle places now, after all they’re doing to recover.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">It’s been years, Harry thought. Shouldn’t they be over it by now?</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Finally, they found their shirt. It was camouflaged under their one-night-stand’s underwear, and Harry sucked in a deep breath as the shirt began to conform to their chest again, pushing the fat into a more acceptable shape. They checked themselves in the mirror.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Yes. This is sufficient.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Harry donned their glasses, and grabbed the bag they had dropped at the door the night before.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">And just like that, they were gone.</p><p class="p2"> </p><hr/><p class="p3" align="center"> </p><p class="p1">“We need to <em>stop</em> doing the adult thing.” Ginny said, raising her bottle to clink it with Harry’s.</p><p class="p2">“What adult thing? Working, drinking, or sex?”</p><p class="p1">“Never having time to meet.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She took a long swig from the bottle, and grimaced. “And also going to Muggle clubs. Do they really not have anything better than this? I could really go for a Firewhiskey.”</p><p class="p1">“You <em>could</em> order other drinks, if beer isn’t your thing.”</p><p class="p1">“No.” Came the stubborn reply. Harry chuckled, shaking their head, and leaned back against the counter. Their eyes are wandering over to a cute blonde man standing on the other end, looking a little uncomfortable in a white button-up. That’s dangerous, they thought. White shirts and clubbing never mix. Something always spills.</p><p class="p1">“How have you been?” She asked, tilting her drink towards him.</p><p class="p1">“Tired, mostly. Though I did go down on a <em>rocking</em> twink last night so maybe my life is going great.”</p><p class="p1">“Harry Potter, you need to <em>stop</em> engaging in horrible unhealthy sexual habits.”</p><p class="p1">“My sexual habits are amazing, I always use protection.”</p><p class="p1">“You <em>know</em> that’s not what I mean. You’re already making googly eyes at… Some blonde. Really, Harry?”</p><p class="p1">“How about you?” They asked, desperate to change the topic. Ginny rolled her eyes.</p><p class="p1">“Oh, you know. Good as ever. Luna went hiking with Neville tonight, so that’s why I’m here.” She took another swig from the bottle, and a little bit spilled down the front of her hoodie. She grimaced, and Harry laughed. See? Spills. That’s why white shirts don’t do well at bars. Their eyes wandered back over to the blonde man, who was approaching the stage with a couple of others. Harry silently hoped that none of them were his partner. A drag show was starting in a couple of minutes. They can make their move after, but the performer was a friend. Harry wondered if they’d have the time.</p><p class="p2">“Are you two still…”</p><p class="p1">“Yeah, we’re still together, don’t worry. I’ll let you know if it stops working out, but I like our arrangement to be honest. Luna’s affections can get a little… too much for me sometimes, and I need a lot of space.”</p><p class="p1">“I meant Quidditch, but it’s good to hear.”</p><p class="p1">“OH. Well. Luna doesn’t really play with me anymore, said it’s not her thing after all, but she'd still watch. I’m still off the field.” Ginny stared at her drink, then looked up at the ceiling. “They might not let me play next season. After, y’know. What happened the last time around.”</p><p class="p1">“That wasn’t your fault.”</p><p class="p1">“I fell thirty feet after having a mental breakdown. The manager is mostly concerned about my general wellbeing. So I’m gonna be mentoring some kids, instead.” She shrugged, and sipped her drink. “They’re good people, Harry. They know it wasn’t my fault. It’s just- I saw her, y’know? That girl just looked an awful lot like Lavender.”</p><p class="p1">“I know.” Harry put an arm around Ginny’s shoulders and squeezed her reassuringly. “I still worry for you, that’s all. You can’t fault me on that- I’m Harry-fucking-Potter. I care about everything. That’s why I keep telling you- Go to therapy.”</p><p class="p1">“Absolutely not.” She said, jokingly at first, and then her face fell. “I can’t. Not yet, at least. I don’t know how you do it, Harry. You were at the front of everything. I know we joke about this, but look at you. I got through like a semester of what you had to go through for your entire life. And yet here I am. All fucked up while you soldier on.”</p><p class="p1">Harry’s eyes are on the stage now. The blonde man has been pulled up on stage by the drag queen, who decided to give him a lapdance. They could see his face clearly now. Their eyes widened. What’s <em>he</em> doing here? They shook it off, turning their attention back to Ginny.</p><p class="p1">“I don’t know how I do it, either, Gin.” They said, waving the bartender over. “But I guess when I’ve been on fire my entire life, I stop noticing when I’m burning. Could I have another beer, please? And give it to that blonde guy who’s on stage… when he’s done with that.”</p><p class="p1">The bartender rolled their eyes.</p><p class="p1">“Bet.” They said, writing it down. Harry chuckled. They’re used to it now, that is, Harry buying drinks for other men.</p><p class="p1">“You’re always on fire, huh.” She said, downing the rest of her drink. “I guess that makes sense. I suppose I’m only just been set on fire.”</p><p class="p2">“Gin,” Harry put their hands on her shoulders. “Don’t be too hard on yourself, okay? Just because someone else went through some shit doesn’t mean that you can’t be going through some shit too.”</p><p class="p1">“Oh, fuck off Harry.” She laughed, slapping their hands away. “I know all that. You don’t have to be Social Worker Harry when it’s me.”</p><p class="p1">They smiled. “I can’t help it. You’re my number one fan, after all.”</p><p class="p1">“Shut the fuck up and go chase your blonde boy.” Ginny smirked, leaving to go chat up a girl with fluffy pink hair. Harry rose an eyebrow. So much for unhealthy sexual habits.</p><p class="p1"> </p><hr/><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p3">“I will. Never. Allow you two to take me anywhere. Ever again.” Draco sat down angrily on the barstool. Blaise and Pansy looked at each other.</p><p class="p1">“You say that every time we bring you anywhere. And yet here you are.” Blaise said, ordering himself a fruity cocktail. Pansy got herself a nice bottle of cider. “Loosen up, Malfoy. You said you wanted to go somewhere queer. We’re at <em>Somewhere Queer.</em>”</p><p class="p1">“At least <em>warn</em> me about the fact that there’s a chance that I could get lap danced.”</p><p class="p1">“Okay, fine. No more drag shows.”</p><p class="p1">“No, that’s not what I meant.” He whined. Pansy snorted.</p><p class="p1">“Sure, Draco, whatever you say my dear.” She clinked her bottle with Blaise’s sugary cocktail. It even had an umbrella. “Next time, we’ll take you out to a male strip club, and buy you a proper lap dance. That drag queen had no idea what he was doing.”</p><p class="p1"><em>“She.</em>” Blaise said, between sips. “It’s on the posters.”</p><p class="p1">“Alright then, that drag queen had no idea what <em>she</em> was doing.”</p><p class="p1">“I don’t <em>want </em>any lap dances.” Draco insisted, as a drink was slid towards him. “Oh, I didn’t order a-“</p><p class="p1">“Nah, someone else ordered it for you.” The bartender jerked a thumb towards someone standing on the other end. Pansy whistled.</p><p class="p1">“We better go.”</p><p class="p1">“Yeah we should, absolutely.”</p><p class="p1">“Wait, what? No, guys, ple-“</p><p class="p1">“Common courtesy, Draco. We’d keep a safe distance, don’t worry. But we also don’t want to intrude on your otherwise potentially steamy conversation with a cutie, do we?” Blaise said, and Pansy smirked.</p><p class="p1">“We’ll be by the pool table.” She said, departing Draco with only a flick of her wrist. “Have fun!”</p><p class="p1">The two of them collected their drinks and left to stand by the glowing pool table. Why is there a pool table in this club? Draco groaned, allowing his head to hit the table.</p><p class="p1">“Doesn’t seem like you’re having a very good night, Malfoy.”</p><p class="p1">He jerked his head up. Crop top. Unruly hair. Round glasses.</p><p class="p1">“What the fuck?"</p><p class="p1">“Whoah, now. No need to be rude.” Harry said, holding a hand up. “I’m surprised to see you too.”</p><p class="p1">“… You bought me a drink?”</p><p class="p1">“Yeah, why not? I haven’t seen you in a while.”</p><p class="p1">Draco picked up the drink, cautious. They clinked, but Draco didn’t drink.</p><p class="p1">“I didn’t spike it, y’know.”</p><p class="p1">“You never know.”</p><p class="p1">“Ask Olive, then.” Harry said, gesturing to the bartender, who chuckled.</p><p class="p1">“Trust me. Harry doesn’t need to.” They said, continuing to clean the glasses. “And they’re here a <em>lot.”</em></p><p class="p1">Draco rose an eyebrow.</p><p class="p1">“They?”</p><p class="p1">“They.” Harry smiled. “But <em>He</em> is fine as well. I do both.” Harry pointed to the button on his crop top. ‘<em>Hi!’</em> It read,<em> ‘My pronouns are: He/They.’</em></p><p class="p1">“I didn’t know that you were nonbinary.”</p><p class="p1">“Yeah, I’m surprised you couldn’t tell. I’m wearing makeup, a crop top <em>and</em> booty shorts.” They laughed. “I came out as Nonbinary about two years ago. Not that I wasn’t out in school, though.”</p><p class="p1">“… As what?”</p><p class="p1">“Trans?” Harry rose an eyebrow. “Oh, god. Malfoy, don’t tell me you didn’t know.”</p><p class="p1">“No, what am I supposed to know?”</p><p class="p1">“I’m Assigned Female At Birth.” Harry laughed. Draco nearly spat out his drink.</p><p class="p1">“No.”</p><p class="p1">“I am!”</p><p class="p1">“You’re <em>fucking</em> with me. No fucking way.”</p><p class="p1">“No, no, I am. I was very masculine-looking when I was 11 because my aunt insisted on keeping my hair super short so that she didn’t have to buy me any women’s products. Because y’know, pink tax. No point in raising an ugly girl, after all. It would’ve been soul-crushing, had I <em>actually</em> been a girl.”</p><p class="p1">“That doesn’t explain puberty.”</p><p class="p1">“Hermione looked up some spells and potions in place of puberty blockers. Then we went to Madame Pomfrey for help. So I started transitioning when I was like… 15? 16? Or maybe sometime before the war, I don’t remember. Madam Pomfrey also gave me stuff to help me appear more masculine, but nothing permanent until my godfather could sign my permission slip.”</p><p class="p1">Draco nodded slowly, taking a very long, slow sip from his drink. Harry was relishing in this response. It didn’t surprise them that Draco was unaware, since their interactions were usually from a certain amount of distance. The only time they were up close and personal was back in the mansion, when Draco had to identify Harry. Most of the Gryffindors knew, back then, when Harry was going through their medical transition, though there were a few who couldn’t tell. It was comforting to Harry back then, that they passed so well even without the transitional potion.</p><p class="p1">“So…” Draco said slowly. “Moving on from that. You come here a lot?”</p><p class="p1">“Oh yes. And I almost never leave alone.” They replied, sitting up on the other barstool with a coy smirk. He rolled his eyes.</p><p class="p1">“Yikes, Potter.”</p><p class="p1">“Oh don’t do that. You’re here too.” Harry smiled. “I didn’t know you were queer.”</p><p class="p1">“It… took a while.” Draco admitted. “I didn’t really realise anything until last year. Pansy laughed at me for not knowing. Seems like everyone knew before I did.”</p><p class="p1">“Mind if I ask your label?”</p><p class="p1">“I’m bi.”</p><p class="p1">“Cool, good to know.”</p><p class="p1">“You?”</p><p class="p1">“I’m bisexual too.” Harry smiled. “But I do prefer men.”</p><p class="p1">The bottle was finished. Harry and Draco were now sitting in an awkward sort of silence. Harry was being friendlier than Draco anticipated, and Draco wasn’t sure what to do with himself. He liked to think that the tension they had as teenagers had been dissolved, but they hadn’t really spoken to each other since, well. The war.</p><p class="p1">He started a sentence in his head, then ended it to start another, but that fell too. What do you say? What’s there to say?</p><p class="p1">“OH my GOD! Harry Potter!” A rush of pink and purple feathers flashed past Draco’s eyes. The drag queen from before rushed out from behind Harry and threw her arms around them, laughing. “Oh my god, love, I thought I’d see you here. Hey, you didn’t come to watch the show, you big meanie. I could’ve given you a lap dance.”</p><p class="p1">“Good to see you too, Fizzy.” Harry laughed. “You’ve met Draco.”</p><p class="p1">Fizzy turned around.</p><p class="p1">“Ohh so <em>that’s</em> your name. That is a really interesting name, Draco.” Fizzy smiled, her big, over-exaggerated eyelashes and pink feather boa bouncing with great enthusiasm and energy. “I’ve had like three Jagerbombs, I am so ready to party. Do you wanna dance, Harry? Draco? Oh, wait, are y’all like…” She raised two fingers and crossed them. Draco turned red and Harry laughed.</p><p class="p1">“It’s in the plans if Draco’s down.”</p><p class="p1">Fizz chortled. “Well you two have fun. Harry, you owe me a drink, okay babe? Next time come watch the show, love.”</p><p class="p1">“Yes yes, I’ll see you later.”</p><p class="p1">Fizz blew them both kisses, waved with only her fingers and sauntered off to the dance floor. They watched her leave, pink latex bodysuit and all.</p><p class="p1">“Uh…”</p><p class="p1">“Oh, yeah. That was my friend. Her stage name is Fizzy Soda, but you already know that, right?”</p><p class="p1">“Yeah I- I know that. I’m more confused about- Sorry, it’s in the plans?”</p><p class="p1">“If you want.”</p><p class="p1">“Like… Sex.”</p><p class="p1">“Yes, Draco, but only if you want to. I don’t have a dick or a strapon, so I can’t really top.” Harry shrugged. “Also not very useful if you only like dick.”</p><p class="p1">“Harry- I literally never hear you talk like.” He gestured wildly. “This.”</p><p class="p1">“You haven’t met me in actual years.” Harry said, looking down at their hands. “You don’t know the half of it.”</p><p class="p1">Draco looked at Harry.</p><p class="p1">“I can guess.”</p><p class="p1">They laughed.</p><p class="p1">“Y’know if you buy me another drink…” Draco started, “I might consider it.”</p><p class="p1">And so another round of drinks were ordered. Olive looked between the two and shook their head.</p><p class="p1">“Harry, what do you even <em>do</em> for a living?”</p><p class="p1">“That’s a secret.”</p><p class="p1">Olive rolled their eyes and continued serving other customers. The night was starting to wind down, and some patrons stumbled past them, drunk. Harry seemed to be on higher alert.</p><p class="p1">“Is something wrong?”</p><p class="p1">“No. But we know this guy who’s a sexual predator.” Harry said. “He got acquitted last year after he beat up this girl for not wanting to leave with him. He literally comes here to try and ‘convert’ lesbians. The fact that he’s not in jail pisses me off.”</p><p class="p1">“He wouldn’t be allowed in here if that’s the case, right?”</p><p class="p1">“He isn’t. But he’s friends with a bouncer. We don’t know who yet. Anyway, I thought I saw him in the crowd just now.”</p><p class="p1">“You’re… keeping an eye out?”</p><p class="p1">“He’s terrified of gay men.”</p><p class="p1">“Jesus. This man is a fucking dumbass.”</p><p class="p1">“Right?” Fizz piped up, seemingly materialising out of nowhere, causing Draco to nearly jump out of his seat. “Hello friends. I’m absolutely <em>sloshed.</em>”</p><p class="p1">“You look fine, Fizz.” Harry said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p class="p1">“Oh I <em>am </em>fine. I went to throw up in the bathroom, so I stopped dancing. I’m all fine now, but <em>brr.</em> That’s not good. Don’t do jagerbombs, boys. Oops- Not boys. Don’t do jagerbombs, darlings.”</p><p class="p1">“You <em>can</em> call me a boy.” Harry said, laughing.</p><p class="p1">Draco was smiling too, now. There’s something interesting about this dynamic- Harry being the assertive one, him laying back. He liked that, somehow. A good change from school. Or maybe it’s just the alcohol buzzing- He’s only two and a half drinks in, but that was the excuse he was going with.</p><p class="p1">A lot seemed to have happened, to Harry, to him. He couldn’t even fathom the fact that he was talking to Harry Potter again - so casually. He took his phone out and sent a quick message to Pansy and Blaise-</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><b> <em>Draco: </em> </b> <em>’I’m all good. You two can go home, I have my wand.’</em></p><p class="p2"><b> <em>Pansy:</em> </b> <em> ‘IS THAT HARRY POTTER’</em></p><p class="p1"><b> <em>Draco: </em> </b> <em>‘Please don’t ask now.’</em></p><p class="p2"><b> <em>Blaise: </em> </b> <em>‘hp is trans btw’</em></p><p class="p2"><b> <em>Draco: </em> </b> <em>‘Yes I know please stop asking.’</em></p><p class="p2"><b> <em>Pansy: </em> </b> <em>‘Potter is trans??’</em></p><p class="p2"><b> <em>Blaise: </em> </b> <em>‘ya. as long as u kno. have fun boi’</em></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">He chuckled. When he looked up from his phone, however, Harry was gone.</p><p class="p1">“Oh no.” Fizzy grabbed Draco by the arm. “We better go give Harry some back-up.”</p><p class="p1">“Sorry what-“</p><p class="p1">“Harry’s lovely and also terrifying when it comes to predators, but they don’t have a lot of self-control. We should go get them before anything explodes. Like, literally.”</p><p class="p1">“I’m sure it’s not-“</p><p class="p1">“Harry doesn’t carry their wand anymore.” Fizzy said, sighing. “They don’t have any way of controlling their magic.”</p><p class="p1">The two fought through the crowds. walked up to Harry, who had put themselves between a slightly terrified lesbian and the sexual predator.</p><p class="p1">“Come on, <em>Daniels.</em>” Harry said, smiling sweetly. “You came here for a <em>reason</em>. Coming here to chat up girls? Please. No girl here is here for <em>you.</em>”</p><p class="p1">“Well I-“</p><p class="p1">“Get out of here, Daniels. Just get out, okay? Don’t come back. You wouldn’t want a repeat of the last time we had a little chat, do you?” Harry said, their smile becoming more of a threat than pretend friendliness. Their fists were balled up and sparking.</p><p class="p1">“You heard the boy.” Fizzy said, hands on her hips. Draco was noticing, for the first time, that Fizz stood at a terrifying height in her chunky thigh-high boots. Hell hath no fury like a 6 feet Drag Queen scorned. Daniels gritted his teeth and walked away, wading his way through the retreating crowds. Fizzy pulled a waiter over and whispered something that sounded like ‘Kick him out’.</p><p class="p1">“Are you okay?” Draco asked over the noise, looking at the girl, who smiled and nodded.</p><p class="p1">“I’m alright. Thanks a lot.”</p><p class="p1">“All in a day’s work, honey. Thanks for coming out tonight.” Fizz said, smiling as the girl prepared to take her leave. “Oh oh, I should walk you out. I’ll get a bouncer to make sure you get a cab, okay sweetie?”</p><p class="p1">And there she went, quickly as she came, escorting the girl out. Harry relaxed.</p><p class="p1">“I hate sexual predators.”</p><p class="p1">“No one likes them.”</p><p class="p1">“You have no idea. Sorry about this.” Harry smoothed out their top, and smiled. “Do you wanna get out of here?”</p><p class="p1">“Well…” Draco looked over their shoulder. “Would you like to dance? We’re here, after all.”</p><p class="p1">“Draco Malfoy, asking <em>me</em> for a dance?”</p><p class="p1">“Fine, don’t dance then.”</p><p class="p1">“I didn’t say that.” Harry laughed, pulling Draco onto the glowing, crowded dance floor. Dancing at a club always just meant jumping, flailing your arms. But that was always more fun when you have a partner to dance with, and Draco was having fun. The music was loud and it’s impossible to talk, but Harry was smiling and laughing and dancing, their hands stretched above their head, their movements loose and fluid. Free.</p><p class="p1">Harry is a good dancer, Draco thought.</p><p class="p1">We’re not teenagers anymore, he thought. The apprehension began to melt away, as the music pulsed louder. Harry spun in a circle and grabbed Draco’s hand just as the crowd shifted, so that they didn’t lose each other. He breathed, at last.</p><p class="p1">He pulled Harry closer.</p><p class="p1">“Your place or mine, Potter?” He asked, leaning into Harry’s ear.</p><p class="p1">Harry laughed above the music, slowing to a stop.</p><p class="p1">“Mine.”</p>
