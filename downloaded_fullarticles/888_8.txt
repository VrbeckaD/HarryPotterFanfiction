</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck", Harry screams when he messes up a pizza dough he have been working on for a few minutes. It's the second time today, and he's slowly becoming desperate. Has he been cursed, or what ? </p><p>"Erm... Hello?" someone calls from the entrance hall. Harry's face is covered with white flour, which is clashing with the brown color of his skin, but well, he supposes the client won't be bothered by this tiny detail. They are in a pizzeria, after all. </p><p> </p><p>He discovers what seems to be the poshest client he has ever seen and sighs. <em>Not another git, not today, Satan.</em> Harry is not sure he is able to be polite tonight.</p><p> </p><p>"Good evening, sir !" he says, his smile fake and forced. "What can I do for you?" </p><p>The client pauses, hesitating. <em>Come on, asshole, I know you know the one with the foie gras and the truffle and the fancy stuff, just say so I can make you your fucking pizza. </em></p><p> </p><p>Harry must admit, the dude is attractive. He is tall and well-dressed, and more importantly, he really has a handsome face, all cheekbones and jaws. Harry is truly entranced by his somehow blue, somehow dark grey eyes - he is well aware that he has the same taste in men than a thirteen year-old girl reading way too much young adult books, but that can't be helped - however his hatred for the ugly and obviously expensive shoes the dude wears forbids him from being too interested. How old is he? Twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two? <em>Probably in some well-known college, getting awesome grades...</em></p><p> </p><p>"Sir?" he repeats and the stranger jumps a bit. </p><p>"Can I... Can I speak to the boss ?" He finally asks. </p><p>"Wait, what" Harry has never been that angry. He hasn't done anything and the dude wants to speak to the boss? <em>White rich people, I swear to God!</em> "Did I offend you or something?" </p><p>"No ! No ! It's just... I've seen that you're looking for someone to do the delivery and..." the young man begins. </p><p>"Yeah, yeah, we're hiring, what about it?" Harry's confusion must be clearly visible on his face, even with all the flour masking his features, because the guy quickly opens his mouth to answer :</p><p>"I would like to apply." </p><p>Silence. </p><p>"Is this a joke", Harry says, already laughing, assuming it is. "Hahaha, that's original, no seriously, which pizza do you want?" </p><p>"None. Because I simply want to apply." </p><p>Harry can't stop laughing. </p><p>"Hey, hey, keep doing whatever you're doing, it's fun, I'll be back in a minute", he tells to the client, his smile this time genuine, and goes upstairs. </p><p> </p><p>"Alberforth!" </p><p>The boss groans and shifts in his hamac. </p><p>"Boss, wake up, I have to show you something! Or, well, someone" </p><p>"Piss off, kiddo. I know it's another prank from the Weasley demons." </p><p>"Al', you're wrong, it's even better!" </p><p>Reluctantly, Alberforth arises and goes with him, whispering "What an annoying kid, I swear" or "Albus, fuck you" </p><p> </p><p>"So?" </p><p>"Look at this guy" Harry replies then says to the dude, who looks kinda freezed or something, "Tell him what you told me, in the same way please!" </p><p>"I would like to apply." </p><p>"For what?" Alberforth asks, curious and surprised.</p><p>"For the job." </p><p>"For the job?" </p><p>Alberforth is fully awake now and yet Harry knows he's not understanding shit. </p><p>"Well, yeah", the poshy dude says, and his tone is now really a posh tone, a condescending one. "Your employee confirmed that you're looking for someone to do the delivery. I would like to be this person." </p><p>"You... want to be our delivery guy?" </p><p>"Yes, sir, if you accept me." </p><p>And then the dude does something incredibly awesome : he bends a little, as if to show his respect. "Wicked!" Harry shouts. "Shit, can I film everything? My best friend is going to love this!"</p><p>"Damn, Harry, did you pay him? Did you? He's gifted, this one! Is he an actor!" </p><p>"No, no I didn't pay him shit, he just came and did his little one man show! Truly made my day!" </p><p>"Wow!"</p><p>"I know right!" </p><p>Alberforth semi-hugs Harry, that's what Harry thinks he tried to do, because Alberforth is really bad at being nice and soft. </p><p>"Excuse me", the actor interrumpts. "I think there is a misunderstanding. This is no joke. I swear. I want the job. I want to apply. As your new deliverer. I swear, I swear. Please believe me." </p><p> </p><p>Something in his voice, which sounds honestly pleasing and somehow heartbreaking - is he in trouble ? - reveals that he's telling the truth. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh" Alberforth says. Then pauses. "So what's your name?" </p><p>"Draco Malfoy." </p><p>"Damn, I'm trying not to laugh" Harry murmurs, "but... your name is Draco Malfoy. That's tough. Whatever, nice to meet you, I'm Harry" </p><p>"Nice to meet you, Harry", Draco answers, apparently not offended by what Harry have just said, and beams. It transforms him, to be honest.</p><p>
  <em>Wow... He's cute.</em>
</p><p>"Do you know how to ride a bike? Well enough to deliver pizzas? You will have to bear the pizzas in a bagpack." </p><p>"Yes, of course I do !"</p><p>"Okay." </p><p>"Okay what?" </p><p>"You're hired, congratulations. You'll begin on Monday. Time to go back to sleep, now"." </p><p> </p><p>And just like that, Alberforth is gone, going back to his beloved hamac. </p><p> </p><p>"That's it?" Draco asks. "Won't he look at my resume? Do an interview?" </p><p>"That was the interview."</p><p>"Oh. Okay. Great. That was easy. Do I have to stay tonight?" </p><p>"No, come back on Monday, he won't be comfortable seeing you before that." </p><p>"Okay. Great, great." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On Monday, Draco gets on the bike and falls. </p><p> </p>
