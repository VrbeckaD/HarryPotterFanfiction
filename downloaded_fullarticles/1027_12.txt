  <span class="s2">He finds Teddy on the balcony.</span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">He’s leaning over the railing to James’s right, clearly avoiding the Potter-Weasley family party just as James had been, taking a slow drag from the spliff between his fingers. They were always so overwhelming, full of sloshed adults and far, far too much noise, and James doesn’t blame Teddy for needing a bit of mallowsweet to calm his nerves. He watches Teddy’s side profile a moment, marveling at the way his lips wrap around the spliff and circle the exhale, before catching himself. He clears his throat.</span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">Teddy jumps, spinning around and moving to vanish it, but James clicks his tongue, shaking his head. “None of that, Lupin,” he grins, moving to meet him at the railing, leaning casually against it. “You think you’re the only one to ever leave one of these to smoke?” </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">Teddy relaxes then, grinning back and lifting it to his lips once more, gathering it all in his mouth before fully inhaling in a way that makes James wonder where he learned. James reaches a hand out, then, gesturing for the spliff just as Teddy lowers it. Teddy automatically lifts it to James’s fingers, then hesitates.</span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s2">Irritation sparks in James— and, underneath that, </span> <em> <span class="s3">hurt, </span></em><span class="s2">though he loathes to admit it— and he opens his mouth, ready to remind Teddy that he’s </span> <em> <span class="s3">of age, you wanker, has been for years </span> </em> <span class="s2">when Teddy’s eyes meet his, unfocused and determined. James blinks, surprised, and Teddy is still holding his breath, neither inhaling nor exhaling, turquoise hair streaking dark. They remain at a standstill for a long moment before Teddy catches the sleeve of James’s jumper, tugging him in. Teddy looks down at him, little tendrils of smoke escaping his lips though he holds them tightly together.</span></p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">“Teddy, what—“ James starts, breath hitching, but never gets to finish, for Teddy is leaning down and pressing his open mouth against James’s. When he exhales, it is by sheer habit that James breathes in, fingers trembling as he fists them in Teddy’s own jumper, eyes fluttering shut.</span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">Teddy pulls back just as the mallowsweet begins to take effect, James’s body feeling fuzzy and sensitive around the edges. Teddy grins, watching him and looking pleased. “There,” he says, reaching up to take another drag, and James’s head spins in a way that has nothing to do with the plant. </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s2">Before Teddy can manage too deep of an inhale, James is stumbling forward, taking Teddy’s face in hands and pressing their mouths together. He inhales briefly, and Teddy’s exhale is shaky, and James is dimly aware that they’re wasting the smoke, Teddy unprepared for the transfer, but none of it matters because he’s </span> <em> <span class="s3">kissing</span> </em> <span class="s2"> Teddy, firmly and wetly and absolutely stupid.</span></p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">Teddy blinks when they break apart, reaching up to touch his swollen mouth as if he can’t quite believe it’s there. “Teddy,” James says quietly, slowly, and Teddy meets his eyes for only a fraction before his gaze drops to James’s mouth. It takes James a few seconds to remember what he was going to say. “Your place is close, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">Teddy opens his mouth for a few long moments, processing, before fumbling horribly for his wand and casting a sobriety charm, spliff very much forgotten. James is impressed at its effectiveness as he watches Teddy’s eyes clear, wondering mildly if it’s something he has to do often. </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">“Fuck,” Teddy says, scrubbing a hand over his face and taking a steadying breath. James dimly registers that maybe he should be nervous, that maybe Teddy will overthink it and reject him, but his mouth and tips of his fingers are still tingling distractedly, and he can’t seem to manage it until Teddy casts a sobriety charm on him, next. </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">James pauses, then, everything coming back into focus, and so does Teddy, and James tenses, but then Teddy gets that determined look on his face again, and he’s stepping towards James. They are so very close, and Teddy lifts a now-steady hand, grasping James’s arm.</span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Hold on,” he murmurs, dipping his head to brush his mouth against James’s, and James holds on. Teddy grins, and they turn and disappear with a </span> <span class="s3"><em>crack</em>.</span></p>
