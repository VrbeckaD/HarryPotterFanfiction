      <p>It's exceptional only in its mundanity, a mousy color reminiscent of the teddy bear that Draco will never admit he kept from his childhood.</p>
      <p>He looks in the mirror, and he no longer sees the spectre of his father staring back at him.</p>
      <p>He keeps it up, though the maintenance is a bitch, redoing the color as the white-blonde grows out.</p>
      <p>Brown is ordinary.</p>
      <p>…</p>
      <p>Draco buys a brown coat for winter.</p>
      <p>It's a large, shapeless thing, thick warm wool to protect him from the icy chill of climate change and the prying eyes of strangers.</p>
      <p>When he wraps the coat around himself, collar pulled up high around his throat and ears, he feels all but invisible.</p>
      <p>The coat serves him well all winter, and when spring comes, he packs it carefully into a storage bag and tucks it away in his closet.</p>
      <p>Brown is comforting.</p>
      <p>…</p>
      <p>Draco buys a brown couch.</p>
      <p>It's overstuffed, wildly dated, and the best decision he's ever made, despite the shabbiness of the fabric and the odd lumps in a few places.</p>
      <p>He sinks into the upholstery at the end of a long day of looking at numbers and pulls his obnoxiously-bobbled afghan over himself and turns on the TV to watch whatever pops up on one of the BBC channels.</p>
      <p>It's begun to curve to his shape, the lumps rearranging as he spends time at home.</p>
      <p>Brown is enveloping.</p>
      <p>…</p>
      <p>Draco drives a brown car.</p>
      <p>It's old, but in good condition, and he got it for a good price. It's the kind of car you could park in a public garage and find three or four of its brethren among the aisles of vehicles.</p>
      <p>There's something about driving his ugly brown car that feels like the most irreverent rebellion, a Malfoy driving a Honda Civic from 2004.</p>
      <p>He takes that car everywhere, driving all over England while he sees all the sights he used to shun for being "too muggle."</p>
      <p>Brown is freeing.</p>
      <p>…</p>
      <p>Draco lives a brown life.</p>
      <p>It's simple, quiet, easy despite every bone in his body singing with the reality of his birth on major anniversaries and events.</p>
      <p>He doesn't go into the wizarding world, sticking to his brown car and his brown couch nd his brown coat and his brown hair.</p>
      <p>After a lifetime of black and green and white-blonde, brown is good. Brown is relaxing.</p>
      <p>Brown is anonymity.</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>"Malfoy, is that you?"</p>
      <p>Bottle-green eyes behind black-rimmed glasses, set into a concerned brown face.</p>
      <p>"You look…"</p>
      <p>Draco pulls his brown coat tighter and braces himself for impact.</p>
      <p>Harry smiles, a soft, tentative thing that reminds Draco of bobbly blankets and hot chocolate and bourbon biscuits and-</p>
      <p>"You look good."</p>
      <p>"I… Thank you."</p>
      <p>"Of course." Harry looks up at the sign above them, at the coffee in Draco's hand. "This seems like a stupid question, but do you want to go for a coffee?" </p>
      <p>"Sure."</p>
      <p>…</p>
      <p>Draco's life is still brown, but now…</p>
      <p>Now, the obnoxious afghan is a disgraceful red-and-gold Weasley creation, and Harry's black coat hangs next to Draco's brown one.</p>
      <p>The couch is joined by a deliciously soft green overstuffed chair, as ugly as the couch if only through sheer determination.</p>
      <p>Harry parks his black and silver motorbike beside the Civic in the garage.</p>
      <p>Draco continues to dye his hair brown, but its not a defense anymore.</p>
      <p>He does it because it makes him happy.</p>
      <p>And when Draco comes back to the flat, those same brown arms are there to welcome him, hanging his coat before wrapping around his waist. </p>
      <p>Brown is home.</p>
