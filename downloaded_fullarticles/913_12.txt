  <strong>Prologue</strong>
</p><p>Hawkmoth was once the most feared Dark wizard of all time, who terrorised the wizarding world in order to gain supreme ultimate power so as to keep the magical bloodlines pure. In order to do so, he would need the combined powers of magical artefacts called the Miraculous, one of which he already owned. With that amount of power, he wanted to rid the world of every single person with even a spot of Muggle blood in their veins.</p><p>His very name inspired so much terror in every witch and wizard that people started referring to him as “You-Know-Who” or “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,” making the mere act of speaking his name a taboo.</p><p>To this day, his true identity remains a mystery.</p><p>In a prophecy that belonged to the Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Great Guardian Fu, two Chosen Ones were promised: the lucky ladybug and the unlucky black cat, the wielders of the Ladybug and Cat Miraculous. They would save the wizarding world and defeat Hawkmoth once and for all, restoring peace to all in a time of chaos. Hawkmoth stole the prophecy, but a team of Aurors managed to retrieve it before he heard it all, so he only heard of one Chosen One: the black cat with the ability to destroy anything with a single touch.</p><p>The black cat’s name was Adrien Agreste.</p><p>Emilie Agreste, a famed Auror, fought Hawkmoth in order to protect her son, but that battle was tragically to be her last. The Dark wizard himself disappeared when he tried and failed to murder the boy with the Killing Curse. People rejoiced, and dubbed the young child the Boy Who Lived; all was well.</p><p>Hawkmoth was never seen again.</p><p>Nobody except for Headmaster Fu knew of the lucky ladybug, the second Chosen One with the power of luck that would aid her in a time of need — but only when she wore the Ladybug Miraculous and uttered the incantation: “Felix Leporem.” With her unlucky counterpart, the black cat with the power of the Cat Miraculous, the two were destined to save the wizarding world.</p><p>The ladybug’s name, of course, was Marinette.</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Chapter One: The Magic Begins</strong>
</p><p>The day Marinette had received her acceptance letter, you couldn’t have found a more anxious or happy girl if you tried. The eleven-year-old spent all day in a limbo of emotions, not quite sure what to feel.</p><p>She was, at first, confused and slightly baffled; the idea that this was some sort of practical joke had run through her mind several times. (She only briefly questioned how the letter had appeared on her bedside table, and decided to question it no further for fear she would drive herself crazy.) It was especially difficult to explain it all to Tom and Sabine, who, while as supportive as ever, couldn’t help but look sceptical. She couldn’t blame them; Marinette herself hadn’t ever heard of “Hogwarts” or any school that taught wizardry or witchcraft, but something inside her deeply hoped — <em>prayed, </em>even — that it wasn’t some elaborate prank. After all, the wax seal on the letter <em>did</em> look official. And how else would they know her room was in the attic?</p><p>At the end of the day, when she helped her parents close up the bakery for the night, her brow seemed permanently creased from worry and her lower lip was threatening to bruise from being abused by her teeth. It was only after dinner, when the family sat around the dinner table, that the mood seemed appropriate enough to discuss the matter at hand. Marinette wrung her hands in her lap, looking up at her parents, who had just reread the letter several times and seemed to accept it better than before.</p><p>“I always knew our daughter was special,” Tom boasted, chuckling as Marinette blushed deep red. Sabine set down a tray of teacups and a pot of steaming hot tea. “Just not quite <em>this</em> special,” he added.</p><p>“Papa, I’m sure I’m not the only girl who got this letter…” Marinette mumbled. Before she could say anything else, however, the family were startled by the loud roar of a fire that made Marinette jump two feet in the air, nearly knocking her teacup over. Was it the fireplace? Was it an oven? Had they left something in? They needed to call the fire department! There could be a—</p><p>“You stay here, Marinette,” her mother whispered urgently as her father armed himself with a rolling pin. It was deemed unnecessary, however, when a woman with cherry-red hair and impossibly deep eyes appeared from the doorway connecting the house to the bakery. The first thing Marinette noticed was that she wore peculiar crimson robes, and that she was hastily dusting them.</p><p>“Oh, good evening! I do hope I haven’t startled you,” she said good-naturedly when she’d finished dusting herself off.</p><p>“Err — good evening,” Sabine replied, perplexed. “Do you need a, ah, tissue or a, err…?”</p><p>The woman shook her head with a grateful smile. “Oh, no, thank you! This always happens when a fireplace gets used for the first time,” she sighed, picking a speck of lint off her elbow.</p><p>“Fireplace?” Marinette asked cautiously, in awe of the strange woman before them. She noticed from the corner of her eye that Tom was quickly putting away the rolling pin.</p><p>“Yes, dear,” the woman affirmed. “The fireplace. It is a common method of transportation — we call it the Floo Network. Don’t worry,” she added quickly, “I’ve only connected your fireplace temporarily so that I may test it out to see if it works. It does, fortunately! But we can talk about connecting it permanently later; I’m here to speak to Marinette. Would that be you, dear?”</p><p>Marinette glanced at her parents, who were shocked, and then nodded mutely.</p><p>The woman clapped her hands together. “Wonderful! I assume you’ve received our letter. I was supposed to give you the letter myself, but I’ve had to visit so many Muggle-born students today that it was quite impossible.”</p><p>“Muggle-born…?” Marinette asked, growing increasingly more confused.</p><p>The woman nodded. “Yes — a Muggle is a non-magical person. You, however, are a witch, Marinette.”</p><p>The girl in question nodded. “I… Yes, I read it in the letter.” She noticed a glinting golden brooch of a lion in full roar pinned on the woman’s robes. “Err… I don’t mean to be rude, but who are you?”</p><p>The woman stopped, as if mentally backtracking their conversation, and became instantly embarrassed. “Oh, goodness, I haven’t even introduced myself! Merlin’s beard, how rude of me! I am Professor Tikki, Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts and Head of Gryffindor House,” she said, tapping the brooch on her breast as if that explained it. “I also teach Charms, so we’ll be seeing a lot of each other.”</p><p>Marinette nodded, processing this information as best as she could. “So — why are you here?” she questioned.</p><p>“I’m here to give you this!” Professor Tikki produced a slip of parchment and handed it to Marinette. “Professor Plagg was in charge of distributing the Muggle-born letters this year and he completely forgot to include this. It’s been a long day,” she said with a sigh.</p><p>Marinette opened it up to reveal a list of supplies, written in the same emerald-green ink as her letter. She read: “First year required books: <em>History of Magic</em> by Mathilda Bagshot, <em>Magical Theory</em> by Adalbert Waffling…” Marinette quickly skimmed over the rest of the list; it ranged from uniform and books to a cauldron and a wand.</p><p>A <em>wand!</em></p><p>She eagerly turned to her parents, holding the list up for them to see. “Mama, Papa, look! A<em> magic wand!</em>”</p><p>Professor Tikki smiled. “Yes, Marinette! And tomorrow I will be escorting you to Diagon Alley, where you can buy all the supplies you need to become a real witch. Your parents will be able to exchange Muggle money into wizarding currency at Gringotts Bank, as well.”</p><p>Marinette gazed at the list in amazement as she listened to the professor’s words, trying to imagine owning each item. She felt her chest brim with excitement. Instantly she turned to her parents, bouncing on the balls of her feet, all anxiety and nervousness forgotten.</p><p>“Can we visit it tomorrow?” she asked eagerly. Her parents gave each other a look, before nodding once.</p><p>“Of course!” Sabine met her daughter’s gaze with a soft smile. “Your father can watch the bakery while we’re away.”</p><p>“Oh, Mama, thank you!” Marinette leaped into her parents’ arms. They embraced her tightly, knowing there was no going back now.</p><p>“Marinette, we’re so proud of you,” her father said as they broke away.</p><p>“I’m sure you’re going to make a wonderful witch,” Sabine agreed, the word sounding strange on her tongue. It was clear they were both still processing this.</p><p>“That’s the spirit!” Professor Tikki chirped. “Well, I’ll be off, then; I must visit a certain Nathaniel Kurtzberg next… I will see you all tomorrow at nine sharp!” With that, as well as a hasty promise to disconnect the fireplace — the Floo Network, was it? — Professor Tikki disappeared in a roar of green flames, leaving a stunned family behind.</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p><p>The next morning, after Professor Tikki had taken Marinette and her mother to Diagon Alley by Floo Network — a system that Sabine immediately swore off after having been engulfed by green flames, despite having agreed to connect their fireplace permanently — and they had paid a visit to Gringotts to exchange quite a bit of money into Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts, Sabine had had enough of the wizarding world for one day, but also a strong longing to see more. Marinette’s wonder-filled expression as she marvelled at flying broomsticks and bubbling cauldrons made all of it worth it, despite the surreal feeling that washed over Sabine when she saw a shop that sold beautification potions or levitating quills. It was all still quite new, and she knew it showed.</p><p>They had joined a group of a dozen or so children with their parents — all Muggle-born, Professor Tikki had explained — and were being accompanied by Professor Tikki and Professor Wayzz, who introduced himself as the Herbology Professor and the Head of Ravenclaw House, tapping the bronze brooch of an eagle on his cloak. The two professors had briefly described the Houses to the students, but Sabine had already quite forgotten everything they had told her. There was one with an iguana, wasn’t there? Or a chameleon? Or was it a dragon…?</p><p>With her arms full of bags — several uniform robes, a pointy hat, all the required First Year books, and a pewtercauldron, as well as various other magical items that Sabine couldn’t begin to explain — the group reached a store that looked considerably older than the rest. The window read:<em> Ollivander’s: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C.</em></p><p><em>My word, </em>Sabine thought, paling visibly.</p><p>One by one, the group shuffled in, followed by the two professors. Marinette clung to her mother’s arm as an lanky old man with a grey beard and a kind smile welcomed them.</p><p>“Welcome, all!” he said warmly. “Now, who would like to go first?”</p><p>That was another thing Sabine couldn’t comprehend: the process that came with selecting the wand. What had Ollivander said? “The wand chooses the wizard”? It was all quite bizarre, but she daren’t say so out loud; not after the way Marinette beamed after her wand had glowed, effectively choosing her.</p><p>“Ah! That,” Ollivander said, “is cypress, ten and three-quarter inches, with phoenix feather at the core…” He stopped then, his expression turning from delighted to almost sympathetic. “That means you’ll do quite a few heroic deeds in the future, my dear,” he added in a whisper so that only she may hear. “Curiously, though: the phoenix that gave this feather gave <em>one</em> other… The sibling wand — it belongs to — well, to none other than the Boy Who Lived! His wand was yew, eleven inches, it was. If ever you meet him, my child, you will do great things together — I am sure of it.” He gave her shoulder a quick squeeze, before he moved back to the counter, ready for the next eager student.</p><p>Sabine blinked and swallowed hard. Was it possible to be any more worried than she currently was? She glanced at her daughter; Marinette looked equal parts excited and frightened. When she whispered, “Who’s the Boy Who Lived?” and her mother was unable to answer, her frown deepened. It was all quite concerning. Sabine couldn’t deny, though, that the wand had undeniably chosen her daughter.</p><p>“It’s all becoming very real at the moment,” she sighed to herself. Marinette gave her a questioning look, but was quickly distracted by a display of owls and cats on the opposite side of the street.</p><p>“Mama! <em>Look!</em>” She gazed, love-struck, at a black cat who was grooming itself lazily by the window. It blinked at Marinette before it yawned and wandered off into the store. Marinette gave her mother a pleading look, but Sabine shook her head apologetically.</p><p>“Your father is allergic to cats, sweetie; you know this.” She hummed thoughtfully for a moment. “Perhaps we could get you an owl? Professor Wayzz told me they’re used for bringing letters. You could write to us while you’re at school.”</p><p>Marinette gave a large barn owl in the window a quick glance, before biting her lip and shaking her head. “They’re…a bit scary,” she admitted. Sabine nodded in understanding, secretly a little bit relieved.</p><p>When they had gotten everything on the list, Professor Wayzz and Professor Tikki escorted the group to André’s Ice Cream Parlour, where Sabine decided to take a seat with the rest of the parents while Marinette picked a flavour.</p><p>The young witch approached the counter, eyeballing some of the stranger flavours — what on earth was butterbeer, and why was there a pumpkin flavour? — and ultimately decided on mint chocolate. She was about to order from the nice-looking man at the counter when she tripped over her own feet and fell right into another First Year. She luckily didn’t drag him down with her as she fell at his feet, and managed to break her fall by stretching her arms out in front of her. She looked up at the boy. He had flaming red hair and a shy look, and immediately helped her back up.</p><p>“I’m sorry!” she squeaked. “I didn’t mean to bump into you!”</p><p>“Oh, n-no!” the boy said. “It’s alright! Don’t worry!” He waited for an awkward moment as she dusted herself off. “Here, um, y-you can go first,” he offered, motioning to the counter.</p><p>Marinette shook her head. “No, no! You were here first. And I fell into you!”</p><p>“No, it’s alright, go a-ahead—”</p><p>“No, no,<em> you</em> go—”</p><p>This went on for a few seconds before Marinette insisted she hadn’t made up her mind yet, and the boy hesitantly got a scoop of toffee-apple. She pretended to think before ordering a scoop of mint chocolate, and smiled at the boy beside her when they’d both gotten their treats.</p><p>After a few moments of silence, he shyly looked up. “It’s… It’s all a b-bit overwhelming, isn’t it?”</p><p>“The ice cream?” Marinette asked, confused. She stared at his cone, then at her own. “I… I suppose? It’s very…minty.”</p><p>That made the boy laugh. It took Marinette by surprise, but she couldn’t help but smile. “No, I mean…all of this! Diagon Alley, flying brooms, magic wands… We’re going to a magic school!”</p><p>“Oh!” When she understood what he’d meant, Marinette nodded fiercely. “Oh, yes, I can barely believe it! Until Professor Tikki visited us at home, I had no idea what I was in for. I thought it was all a practical joke for a while.”</p><p>“Really? Me too!” The boy laughed again. “I’m — I’m Nathaniel, by the way.”</p><p>“I’m Marinette,” she said, smiling. “Should we go sit with our parents? I’m sure they’re as overwhelmed as we are.”</p><p>Nathaniel agreed, and Marinette felt giddy as she joined her mother and Nathaniel’s father, who had hair as red as his son’s. This was all getting better and better!</p><p>After another hour or so of touring Diagon Alley, and after several mandatory stops to all the sweet shops, Professor Tikki gathered the group and presented each student with a train ticket.</p><p>“The Hogwarts Express departs on the first of September at eleven o’clock sharp, so don’t be late!” she reminded them. “Keep your ticket safe, and always remember to—”</p><p>Marinette zoned the professor out as she studied her ticket, then whispered harshly to Nathaniel, “Does this say Platform Nine and <em>Three-Quarters?</em>”</p><p>Nathaniel looked at his own ticket, then nodded in both amazement and confusion. “But how could there possibly be a Platform Nine and Three-Quarters?”</p><p>Marinette’s brow furrowed. “I have no—”</p><p>“My dears! I was just about to explain that,” Professor Tikki interrupted, giving them a stern look followed by an amused smile. “When you arrive at King’s Cross Station, you must simply stand between Platforms Nine and Ten. Then, walk directly into…”</p><p>Marinette listened in awe as Professor Tikki explained the apparently painless process of arriving at the platform, and vowed that she wouldn’t hesitate to walk through the wall when the time came. When Professor Tikki had finished, she escorted them all to a public fireplace for them to go home, and Marinette waved goodbye to Nathaniel when she stepped into the fireplace, not even blinking so that she may remember what this wondrous place looked like forever. Then, with a burst of green flames, she was home with a wide smile and a pocketful of Fizzing Whizbees.</p><p>“Mama, I’m going to my room! I’ve got so many ideas for new designs now! I was thinking a hat — a pointy hat, like mine! — but with a plume and — and what if it changed colours? Oh, I’ve got to write this down!” She rushed upstairs, her mind buzzing with new ideas. She hadn’t had this much inspiration in months!</p><p>“She’s really enjoying this,” Tom said as Sabine put all the bags in the kitchen. He looked both proud and sad, which Sabine understood perfectly.</p><p>“You should have seen her today,” Sabine told him. “I think she’s found where she belongs.”</p><p>Tom gave his wife a watery smile. “Well, we always knew our girl was special,” he said, and sat his wife down next to him. “Now, tell me everything that’s happened. I want to hear all about this Diagonal Alley and how the Gloo Network works…”</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p><p>September first came all too soon, but Marinette was more than ready. She had packed her bags more than a month ago, and even hand-sewn her name into all her robes and cloaks in gold thread. She had also made herself an entirely new hat: it was a deep purple, with gold stars stitched into it. She had used a thin gold overlay so that when she moved, the gold sparkled in the light. She was very proud of it, and instantly made the decision to wear it forever. She’d also filled half her sketchbook with ideas on how to create even bolder, more magical items, like a clutch that had a hidden compartment just for your wand, or earrings that changed colour whenever you said the magic word—</p><p>Well, first she’d have to find out if there was even such a spell. But that would come in due time. For now, she was still brimming with ideas and new-found inspiration.</p><p>Of course, she had mentally prepared for school as well. She had started on each of her school books, and found History of Magic the most interesting subject so far. Who knew that Merlin was real? And could you imagine goblin revolts? It seemed too good to be true!</p><p>However, once she’d actually boarded the train — after a rather comical mishap at the station, where she mistakenly walked into the wall between Platform Ten and Eleven — and said goodbye to her parents, the reality that she would be away — for a whole term! — sunk in. She was still excited, of course! Still excited, but…toned down quite a bit.</p><p>As she walked along the train, trying to find an empty compartment — or one with people who looked friendly enough — she found two other First Years, judging by the lack of House colours on their uniform. She hesitantly opened the door and slipped inside, giving both of them a shy smile.</p><p>“Err… Hi! I’m Marinette,” she introduced herself. “Do you mind if I sit?”</p><p>One of them — a dark girl with red hair who sported white sneakers under her uniform — smiled wide. “Go ahead! I’m Alya. Come, sit by me — don’t sit next to Nino.”</p><p>Marinette grinned and sat as the boy — Nino — shot up. </p><p>“Hey!” Nino exclaimed. “Is it because I said you wouldn’t get into Gryffindor?”</p><p>“You’re just jealous,” Alya fired back, “because I’m <em>obviously</em> braver than you. You haven’t got a smudge of chivalry or honour in you at all!”</p><p>“Gryffindor,” Marinette repeated, “as in, Professor Tikki’s House?” She leaned against the seat, feeling the train rattling beneath them as it moved.</p><p>“Oh, yeah! You know Professor Tikki? She’s amazing! She’s so powerful, and I <em>love</em> her hair,” Alya gushed. She was leaning against the window, her long legs taking up most of the legroom, but Marinette didn’t mind. “But Mr Know-It-All over there seems to think that I’m not cut out for her House — since my dad was a Ravenclaw and my mum is a Muggle and all — but I disagree. I think <em>he</em> won’t make it into Hufflepuff.”</p><p>Nino smirked and crossed his arms. “I’m basically<em> guaranteed </em>a spot in Hufflepuff, Alya,” he said smugly. “I'm a badger through and through. My entire family has been a Puff for as long as anyone can remember.”</p><p>“Well, he's been an idiot for as long as anyone can remember,” said Alya under her breath, and Marinette held back a giggle, though she was having trouble following the conversation. She bit her lip so as not to burst out laughing, and met Alya’s eyes. The redhead gave her a newly familiar smile. “So, what House are you hoping to get in?”</p><p>Marinette wanted to match her excitement, but didn’t know quite what to answer. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “I’m, uh — well my parents are both Muggles, so I don’t—”</p><p>“Oh!” Alya exclaimed. “That explains it! Well, don’t worry. It honestly doesn’t matter as much as we make it out to.”</p><p>Nino gasped. “Alya, of <em>course</em> it does—”</p><p>Alya shut him up with a stern look. “It <em>doesn’t,</em>” she repeated. “What <em>really</em> matters,” she said, eyes sparkling, “is all the secret passageways and hidden rooms that Hogwarts has! My dad wrote me a list of all the ones he discovered back in the day. There’s one on the second floor behind a portrait of a lady in a blue dress that leads to a stairway all the way into the Restricted Section of the library, and there’s another one that—” She continued to describe various hidden rooms around the castle, and Marinette listened intently, growing more and more eager to explore the school with each passing moment. When Alya was about to dive into a story about a room full of Chocolate Frogs, she was interrupted by the door of the compartment opening. Marinette looked up and immediately grinned.</p><p>“Nathaniel!” she exclaimed. “Hi! Come in!” she offered, quickly glancing at Alya to make sure it was alright. Alya only nodded and smiled politely at the newcomer.</p><p>“Hey! I’m Alya,” she said. “That loser is Nino.” She pointed at said loser, who was now deep in sleep with a heavy-looking, multicoloured pair of headphones blasting music into his ears.</p><p>“I’m — I’m Nathaniel,” said the red-haired boy, giving Alya a small smile. “Were you s-saying something about Chocolate Frogs? I b-bought one and — well, it escaped — but I got a card with Jagged Stone on it! I had no idea he w-was a wizard!”</p><p>“Jagged Stone?” Marinette repeated, eyes wide. She was genuinely amazed; she considered herself one of his biggest fans. How had she not known that he could do <em>magic?</em></p><p>Alya nodded, confirming the fact. “Yep! He’s one of the only wizard musicians who made it big in the Muggle world. There’s also bands like The Weird Sisters — they’re great — but not so well known by Muggles. My parents are obsessed with this one singer, Celestina Warbeck. Real mushy romance stuff.”</p><p>Marinette brushed her bangs out of her eyes, cracking a smile. “Is that what he’s listening to, d’you think?” she suggested, pointing at a drooling Nino whose headphones had started to slip. Alya burst out laughing and leaned over to adjust them.</p><p>Throughout the rest of the ride — where they had a heated discussion on what Jagged Stone’s best album was, as well as a debate about the best House, and a visit from a lady with a trolley full of candy, after which Alya tried to throw Every Flavour Beans into Nino’s mouth and missed — Marinette forgot all about her homesickness. She hadn’t even thought of her parents again until she remembered the macarons her father had made for her to share, and she smiled in amusement as Alya hastily picked out all the chocolate ones for herself, while Nathaniel seemed to prefer the fruity flavours. (She had also saved a few for when Nino woke up, and he gave a grateful grin as he munched on a strawberry-flavoured treat.)</p><p>As they neared their destination, the train still rattling beneath them, Marinette could only look forward to her new life with new friends, all homesickness forgotten as the castle came into view.</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p><p>Alright, well, Marinette had liked the train well enough, and couldn’t complain about its efficiency. The boats that the First Years had to get in? Not so much. It didn’t help that Nino mentioned the giant squid that lived in the Black Lake, and Marinette clutched the sides of the boat so hard her knuckles turned white. She saw an older student at the shore — a prefect, if his silver-and-green badge was anything to go by — who gave her a reassuring smile, and she breathed a bit easier until the actual castle came into view, when she lost all breath.</p><p>The magnificent castle shone like a golden beacon, with enchanted lights floating around the building, reflecting in the dark ripples of the midnight-blue lake. The stars seemed to glow brighter than ever before, and the moon seemed pale in comparison. Behind it were miles of forest with the tallest trees she had ever seen, rivalling the castle itself. Each tower rose higher than the rest, emerging from the leaves, and she could almost feel the warmth that seemed to radiate from the structure.</p><p>It was almost like the feeling of coming home.</p><p>With wobbly knees and Alya’s help, she stepped out of the boat, followed by Nathaniel and Nino. They followed the massive crowd of students, from timid First Years to cocky Seventh Years, to the front entrance of the castle, which flew open to welcome them. Marinette was right: the inside of the castle was warm, and the levitating candles seemed to explain why. When they stepped inside, the slightly intimidating building was instantly transformed into a mess of chatter and laughter while the professors divided them into year groups.</p><p>The First Years followed Professor Tikki up a flight of stairs for a headcount and then a brief explanation of the House Sorting ceremony. Marinette missed parts of it as she marvelled at all the portraits and gazed at the glowing lights of the magical candles. Did the professor say something about a hat?</p><p>“<em>Look!</em>” she gasped, giving their shoulders a rough shake. “That portrait is — it’s <em>moving!</em>”</p><p>The redheaded boy didn’t look surprised, but still delighted. His face lit up as he gazed at the various scenes that moved before their eyes, as lifelike as it could possibly get. “Yes! I’ve read about that! I wish I could know how they’ve done it…”</p><p>“It’s cool, isn’t it?” Alya grinned at them. “I’ve tried to do it once before — my dad enchanted some drawings of mine — but it always ends up a messy blur.”</p><p>“Still, it’s amazing,” said Marinette. “Look! Did that knight just wave at us?”</p><p>“Should we wave back?” Nathaniel suggested, and Marinette was about to reply when she heard a snort and a snicker behind them.</p><p>“Merlin, can you believe these Muggle-borns?” came a snarky voice. Marinette turned her head sharply towards the source of the noise, and her eyes locked on a girl with blond hair high up in a ponytail. She was giggling. “Oh, look, Sabrina, a moving painting! Catch me, I’m going to faint!” she mocked. A girl beside her — with short ginger hair and a green hairband — laughed alongside her. Marinette frowned.</p><p>“Excuse me,” she said, approaching the two girls, “but take that back.”</p><p>The blonde girl looked surprised, then narrowed her cold blue eyes into a glare. “Oh, and what are you going to do if I don’t? Curse me?” She smirked. “Do you even know what a wand is?”</p><p>Marinette glared right back at her. “I <em>do,</em> actually. I happen to <em>own</em> one.”</p><p>“Oh? And what is it? One of those little magic sticks you Muggles have with flowers that come out the top?” The girl laughed again.</p><p>“Oh, Chloé, you’re <em>too </em>funny!” Sabrina gushed, in between fits of giggles.</p><p>Marinette fumed. “What’s wrong with Muggles?” she asked, clenching her fists and standing tall. If this girl thought she could make fun of Muggles, she had another thing coming.</p><p>“Marinette…” Nino muttered with a cautious tone.</p><p>Chloé glared at them. “Are you joking? What’s <em>wrong </em>with <em>Muggles</em>? Merlin, Sabrina, are you hearing this?”</p><p>“Marinette, it isn’t worth i-it…” Nathaniel tried in vain to pull her away, while Alya wore a scowl that mirrored Chloé’s. Marinette was about to add more, but reluctantly gave in, letting Alya, Nathaniel, and Nino pull her away towards the head of the group where Professor Tikki stood patiently in front of a large pair of heavy oak doors.</p><p>“That was so <em>Gryffindor</em> of you, Marinette!” Nino said in admiration, and she blushed as Professor Tikki unrolled a scroll, read through it, and nodded to herself.</p><p>“Alright, First Year students,” she called. “We will now enter the Great Hall! Watch your step here—”</p><p>The doors immediately swung open before them, revealing a grand room with four long tables, each seating dozens of children of all ages, and decorated with the four House colours. She tried to remember the colours that represented each House, and figured out the order: Slytherin in the far left, then Ravenclaw, then Gryffindor, and finally Hufflepuff. There were elaborate banners hanging on all the walls, and even more enchanted candles that floated in midair. At the back was the High Table that seated all the professors — Marinette recognised Professor Wayzz, who was speaking to a tired-looking man with black hair — on a raised platform.</p><p>“Look up,” Nino whispered to the others.</p><p>Marinette did as he suggested, and immediately gasped as she saw…no ceiling! Instead of a roof, the night sky was visible above their heads, with the twinkling stars and the crescent moon shining bright.</p><p>“It’s enchanted,” Alya told them. “I’ve read about it in <em>Hogwarts: A History.</em>”</p><p>“First Year Students,” Professor Tikki said, interrupting their awed gasps at the scenery. “I will now read out your names in alphabetical order. You will come forward and sit on this stool—” She gestured at a simple wooden stool at the centre of the raised platform. “—and let the Sorting Hat do the rest! You will then join your respective House.”</p><p>“The moment of truth, Alya,” Nino whispered harshly.</p><p>Alya smirked, fully confident. “Bring it on.”</p><p>Professor Tikki cleared her throat, hesitated, then read: “Agreste, Adrien.”</p><p>An unanticipated silence washed over the room, which Marinette did not understand, but put down to simple politeness. Nobody so much as coughed or whispered as a blond boy stepped forward. She could sense he was trying not to look nervous. He hesitantly sat on the stool, and waited while the Sorting Hat — a large lump of a brown hat with the pointed end askew — was placed on his head. It took a minute while the Hat was deciding, and the boy, Adrien, closed his eyes in anticipation. Ultimately, the Hat decided: “Slytherin!”</p><p>Cheers erupted from said House. The boy stood, even more nervous than before, and sat at the table, receiving multiple high-fives and pats on the back. Marinette noticed that his robes had somehow been enchanted, and now held the Slytherin House colours of silver and emerald-green. Even his tie had changed! When had<em> that </em>happened?</p><p>When the cheering died down, Professor Tikki read out the next name: “Bourgeois, Chloé.”</p><p>She swaggered over to the stool.</p><p>“That girl from before,” Marinette whispered.</p><p>“Yeah,” Alya confirmed with a scowl. “<em>Chloé. </em>She thinks she’s<em> all that </em>because her daddy is the Minister for Magic.”</p><p>“He’s the what?” Marinette asked, but it fell on deaf ears as everyone watched while Chloé had daintily taken a seat and the Sorting Hat was presented to her. It barely touched her head before bellowing: “Slytherin!” She wore a self-assured smile and joined the other two First Years at their table; strangely enough, she had also seemed to expect this.</p><p>Two or three students were next before Professor Tikki called, “Césaire, Alya.”</p><p>Marinette gave her a thumbs-up while Nino smirked as Alya ascended the steps to the platform. The Sorting Hat took only a few seconds to decide: “Gryffindor!”</p><p>Alya’s smile could have lit a hundred rooms, and Nino whooped as Marinette gave him a questioning look.</p><p>“I thought you didn’t think she could get in,” Marinette whispered.</p><p>Nino shook his head, giving her an impish grin. “I always knew she would,” he admitted. “But teasing her is fun, y’know?”</p><p>After a few more students they had moved on from C to D, Marinette started anticipating her own name, but was still surprised when Professor Tikki said it.</p><p>“Dupain-Cheng, Marinette.”</p><p>Her heart stopped. She stepped forward, desperately wishing that she wouldn’t trip or that her robes wouldn’t get caught on anything while she walked up the steps. She caught one of the professors’ eyes — a small, old man in red who looked at her intently, expectantly. It made her nervous. She sat down on the stool, hands clammy, and tried not to look too scared of the sea of unfamiliar faces before her. She felt the gentle pressure of the Sorting Hat being placed on her head, and flinched when its voice filled her mind.</p><p>“Well, well…” it began. “You’re a good kid, aren’t you? Loyal, hard-working… Definitely courageous, the way you stood up to those girls a few minutes ago…”</p><p>Marinette remembered Nino’s comment from earlier, and flushed.</p><p>“Ah, and ambitious, are we? You want to become a designer, I see? Big ideas, big dreams. Definitely creative — I do like that hat you made. Very bright, very clever girl. My, my, how impressive. Oh, you’d fit in just fine anywhere, Miss Dupain-Cheng.” The Sorting Hat hesitated. “But you’re proud, too. You unapologetically want to be noticed, and accepted… You are protective — no — <em>defensive, </em>rather. A bit of a clumsy one, too: this gives you well-earned caution. But you think with you heart as well as your head — that’s admirable. So where to put you…?”</p><p>Marinette closed her eyes in anticipation as the Hat murmured incomprehensive things that had nothing to do with one another, and tried desperately not to blush deeper as it talked of her less-than-redeeming qualities.</p><p>“Selfless,” the Hat finally said. “Selfless to the bone. I see heroic deeds in the future for you, Miss Dupain-Cheng. Great things lie ahead of you. But you lack the background…and are willing to change that. Ah. I know.” Marinette tensed until the Hat bellowed, “Ravenclaw!”</p><p>The Ravenclaw table cheered, and Marinette opened her eyes to see an assortment of students with bronze-and-blue ties give her pleased looks. She wore a smile as she descended the steps to the table, and sat down next to a friendly-looking prefect who gave her a pat on the back.</p><p>“You’re the First Ravenclaw of the evening,” the prefect said. She was very pretty, with long dark hair styled into a high ponytail. Her prefect badge shone in the candlelight. “We’re off to a good start!”</p><p>“You were up there quite a while,” another older student remarked. He had very dark skin and a prefect badge on his shirt lapel. “I thought it was going to be a Hatstall for a second.”</p><p>Marinette briefly gave him a questioning look, but chose to focus on the ceremony as it continued. More and more faces she didn’t know joined their respective Houses, and they cheered every single time. She listened out for some names and faces, but missed some of them. A girl named Juleka joined her at the table not long after. The next Ravenclaw was a boy named Max. One girl with pink hair named Alixandrea was called soon after, and was quick to correct the professor: “Call me Alix,” she said straight to Tikki’s face. She was a Gryffindor. Marinette almost gasped at her boldness, but secretly admired it, too.</p><p>When Nathaniel was called, she saw his shaking fingers, and he looked pale as one of the ghosts flying around the Great Hall. The hat barely touched his cherry-red hair before it decided, “Ravenclaw,” with a satisfied tone. Nathaniel looked both relieved and terrified as he joined Marinette at the table.</p><p>Nino was next. He was Sorted into Hufflepuff, as expected.</p><p>“As expected of the Lahiffe family,” the prefect remarked as the red-and-gold table cheered for their new member. “They’ve all been Hufflepuffs since probably forever.”</p><p>“Would be surprised if he wasn’t sorted there,” said another Ravenclaw student.</p><p>Marinette squinted and could vaguely see an older boy at the Hufflepuff table who resembled Nino give him a high-five, as well as an older girl with the same cheeky smile and dark skin. When she turned back she grinned at Nathaniel, who gave her a shy smile in return, and waited until Professor Tikki announced the next name.</p><p>Minutes later, a very timid, very pretty girl named Rose joined the Hufflepuff table. Sabrina was in Slytherin with Chloé, as well as a handful of others. There were many other students whose names Marinette did not catch, but she resolved to learn them all as soon as possible.</p><p>Once Professor Tikki had finished, she gently flicked her wand and the stool, scroll, and Sorting Hat vanished. She smiled and announced: “Now Headmaster Fu would like to say a few words, so listen closely,” before taking her own seat at the faculty table.</p><p>An old man at the very centre of the table stood, and rather anticlimactically could barely reach the tabletop. He wore an outrageously tall pointy hat, and bright red robes embroidered with white flowers and leaves. The headmaster looked over the Great Hall with a sense of quiet pride that warmed Marinette greatly.</p><p>“Before the Start-Of-Term Feast, I would like to welcome both old and new students to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,” he said. “A reminder to all of you that the third floor is strictly off-limits to all students! No one may venture into that part of the castle, even if your classmate claims there’s a shortcut to the library there. There really isn’t — I did, however, once find a room full of Fizzing Whizbees that ended up being an armada of angry Bludgers! In conclusion, be careful in every adventure, and enjoy the shepherd’s pie; it’s very good.” With that, he sat down, and clapped his hands once. The moment he did so, plates upon platters appeared on all the tables that advertised creamy mashed potatoes, roast chicken and beef, savoury pies with flaky crust, steaming towers of sautéed vegetables, aromatic soups accompanied with scents that wafted through the air, and dozens of other dishes Marinette could not wait to eat. If she had been hungry before, she was starving now.</p><p>“Well, enjoy!” the prefect told the First Years as she helped herself to a dollop of the mashed potatoes.</p><p>Marinette looked in amazement at the food for a moment and caught Nathaniel’s eye, flashing him an excited grin before tucking in. She particularly liked the pumpkin juice; it was strangely satisfying. As they ate, Marinette got to know Juleka and Max, and had succeeded in coaxing Nathaniel to speak more than a few sentences every hour.</p><p>After dinner and plenty of dessert, the prefects announced that the First Years should follow them to the Ravenclaw Common Room.</p><p>“It’s up in Ravenclaw Tower,” the prefect girl from earlier told them. “It’s quite beautiful on sunny days when the light reflects on the marble, and you could just stay and read all day…” She gave a happy sigh. “Well, come on! I’ll show you how to get to it. I’m Amaya, by the way — ask me anything if you need any help!”</p><p>Once they climbed a seemingly endless amount of steps — and why were the staircases <em>moving?</em> — and passed several friendly portraits, the group found themselves in the west wing of the school. At the top of a spiral staircase was a simple wooden door with bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle.</p><p>“Instead of a traditional password,” Amaya said, “the knocker on the door asks you a riddle, and you have to answer correctly to get in. Sometimes there’s a lineup of students because they can’t answer — but that rarely happens. And honestly,” she whispered, covering her hand with her mouth so the door couldn’t hear, “sometimes it repeats riddles, but we’d never tell it that.” Amaya cleared her throat and turned to face the door. “Alright! What have you got in store for us today?”</p><p>A disembodied voice asked: “What always runs, but never walks, often murmurs, but never talks, has a bed, but never sleeps, and has a mouth, but never eats?”</p><p>The prefect thought for a few moments, murmuring, “A bed… Mouth, but doesn’t eat?” She bit her lip, thinking for a moment, before exclaiming, “Oh! A river<em>bed!</em> It’s a river.”</p><p>The knocker replied, “You may enter,” and the door swung open, revealing a hallway with elegantly carved archways and smooth marble pillars. The hallway led to a spacious, circular room with a soft blue carpet and several high, arched windows that allowed them to see all the school grounds, with lavish, dark blue curtains draped over the spotless glass. Above their heads was a domed ceiling painted with stars and constellations that drifted over the stretch of blue.</p><p>There were a few paintings covering the walls — “This is Rowena Ravenclaw, the Founder of our House,” Amaya told them — but mostly books: there were scrolls, books, binders, and papers neatly piled up into bookshelves that reached the top of the ceiling. There were a few chaises longues and many desks and tables littered with what Marinette assumed was schoolwork. Even now, at the late hour, many older students were busy studying; there were also a few students reading for pleasure.</p><p>Taking up a large piece of the wall was a board with notes and papers tacked onto it, and when Marinette looked closer, she saw they were past riddles the knocker had told them, with some possible answers suggested below.<em> Isn’t this cheating?</em> she wondered, then shrugged to herself: it was pretty genius. Some students had even made up their own riddles, trying to predict what the knocker would tell them next. Marinette tried reading them from a distance as Amaya continued.</p><p>“The boys’ dormitories are that way,” Amaya said, pointing to a door, where another prefect gave them a polite wave, “and the girls’ dormitories are this way. Boys, you can follow Yaqoob — he’ll show you where to go. Girls, follow me!” As Marinette followed Amaya, she gave a last glance and a wave at Nathaniel, who dutifully followed Yaqoob. The dark-haired prefect took them past a door to a hallway that contained seven other doors: one for each year group. Amaya told them the first one on the right was for the First Years before she headed off to her own room, promising to check up on them the next morning.</p><p>This room was also circular, with a dark wooden floor instead of marble, and a dark blue carpet that glowed with images of the phases of the moon. Marinette recognised her trunk and wandered over to her new bed, which had a canopy that seemed to change colour from sky blue to midnight blue. She even had her own little bedside table, desk, and chair, as well as a spectacular view of the school grounds from another elegant window. Yawning, she made the decision to unpack tomorrow. Now, she just wanted to sleep…</p><p>After the girls had undressed and pulled on their nightgowns and pyjamas, Marinette sleepily curled under the dark blue covers and played with the gold embroidery of the constellations. Her last thought was, <em>Capricorn is very pretty, </em>before she drifted off to sleep.</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p>
