    <p>Remus John Lupin has his shit together. At least, that's what he tells himself every morning when he washes his face in front of his cracked bathroom mirror. It's what he tells himself as he downs his coffee (milk, one sugar) from his favourite mug (yellow, red handle). It's what he tells himself when he wakes up from yet another nightmare, or can't stop his leg from shaking when he finds himself at the doctor’s office for the third time that year. But he does. He has his shit together. The bags under his eyes have faded from desperately exhausted to just a bit tired, and his scars are just that - scars, fully healed over. So, it's not a surprise that Remus feels optimistic as he opens the door to his office on the first day of his new job. His hair is as neat as it gets, and his beard is a length that could only be called professional. This, along with his tweed jacket, elbow patches, and copper rimmed glasses make for a well-respected teacher, ready to pass on his knowledge to his students. His office is small, but Remus didn't have much to put in it anyway. From his bag, he unloads a melange of textbooks and diaries, an old coffee can filled with pens, and a fraying mousepad displaying the image of a wolf howling at a full moon. After setting up his few belongings, he turned on his computer, pushed his glasses from the top of his head to his nose, and concentrated.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>"So, while dystopian fiction is an increasingly wide genre, there are various themes and motifs that occur frequently. We'll be studying two books in detail for this course, but you will need to draw knowledge of other texts from your own wider reading. Now, who can tell me any common dystopic themes?" Remus was stood at the front of a decent-sized classroom. First period, thankfully, was a sixth form class, and they all seemed at least vaguely interested in what he was saying. Following his question, at least ten hands shot up, and he was glad to learn that his students knew what they were talking about. For the next hour, he tried to keep discussion flowing - it was the first lesson of the academic year and he knew the class would appreciate an hour just to chat, rather than the gruelling task of making notes. He found it easier than expected to keep the conversation on track.</p><p>"Right," he said in response to a question, "that's actually a really good question. You do need to have some knowledge of recent and historical events because some of your exam questions have an emphasis on context." The last ten minutes of the lesson was spent discussing the relevance of Stalin's Russia, and maybe Remus' grin was a little out of place but it had gone well. His very first lesson had been a success - he deserved a smile.</p><p>After second lesson (excitable year 7s) and third (tired year 11s), Remus headed back to his office for lunch. It was an unusually warm September day, so he opened the window to allow in a breeze. Removing his jacket, he slung it across the back of his chair and threw himself down on it. Coffee. That’s what he needed. He had considered bringing his kettle from home, but had decided against it because he really didn’t fancy carrying it with him on the bus; he was regretting that decision now. He allowed himself another minute of quiet, before pulling himself up and trudging out of his office and towards the staff room. The hallways were covered in various displays, advertising fairs and showcasing students’ work. He stopped for a second when a particularly bright display caught his eye, and barely had the time to read any of the poems on display before he sensed a presence next to his right shoulder.</p><p>“Uh… Hi?” <em>Well done, Lupin. Real eloquent. </em>Thankfully, the other man didn’t appear perturbed.</p><p>“You must be the new English teacher Minnie’s been going on about.” The man had a friendly sort of smile that made Remus want to keep this conversation up – that didn’t happen very often.</p><p>“Yeah, uh – Remus. Lupin.” He said, offering his hand to the other man to shake.</p><p>“Potter. James Potter. License to… Teach sport, I guess.” So, this guy was funny, too. Remus was starting to feel a little out of his depth.</p><p>“So,” James said, when Remus failed to reply, “I was just heading to the staff room, you coming?” James pointed a thumb over a shoulder, still smiling that boyish grin.</p><p>“Yeah, sure. I’d kill for a coffee.” James’ smile widened even further at that, clapping a hand to Remus’ shoulder, and leading the way to the land of free coffee.</p><p>During lunch hour, Remus found out more about James than he thought it was possible to in such a short time frame. He was married, and had a two-year-old son. His wife (Lily), was ginger, Welsh, and very pregnant. His parents were wealthy and had made their fortune creating and selling organic hair products designed solely for Afro-Caribbean hair. Their cat, Marmalade, was missing one leg, and was consistently finding herself stuck in the next-door neighbour’s pond. James’ best friend was short, French, and disowned (<em>“and single, if you’re looking”</em>). James was just retelling the story of how he had gotten his nickname (it seemed to have involved a deer, and a <em>lot</em> of vodka) when the bell had rung, signifying the end of lunch.</p><p>“Well, Lupin, see you tomorrow. I’ll make sure to mention you to Sirius.” Remus just blushed and waved him off in response, speed-walking back to his office to pick up what he needed for his afternoon lessons. Once those lessons were over and done with, he couldn’t help that think that, as first days go, this one wasn’t bad at all.</p><p>The bus home was quiet – he took the 4:30 bus to avoid the onslaught of students. He liked taking the bus. It gave him time to think, and watch the world go past. Right now, the bus was idling at a bus stop, allowing a small queue of people to enter. The third person in the queue was a young man – perhaps nineteen years old – with dark skin and crazy dark hair that stuck up in every direction. Underneath the hair was an oddly shaped scar that Remus thought looked like a bolt of lightning stretching from his eyebrow to his hairline. He was dressed fairly conservatively – red jumper with a mustard collar, faded blue jeans, white converse – and yet his bag betrayed the whole ‘boy scout look’. A satchel, Remus thought made from corduroy, covered in various badges and held together by an exorbitant number of safety pins. On receiving his bus ticket, he smiled and said thank you to the driver.</p><p>When Remus got home, he kicked off his shoes and chucked them into the cupboard under the stairs. When the cupboard door refused to shut properly, he spent the next quarter of an hour crouched on the floor with a screwdriver. He only stood up again because his efforts proved futile. For dinner, Remus ate a can of cream of vegetable soup with buttered bread and a glass of water. Then, he showered, got changed, brushed his teeth, and got into bed; it was half past ten. Because Remus John Lupin had his shit together. No matter what anyone else said.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>The next day was a Wednesday, and Remus woke up in such a good mood that he decided to take a detour on the way to work. There was a bakery one street over from his bus stop that he had noticed before, but had never thought of actually going there. The bell jingled when he opened the door, and the man behind the counter looked almost surprised to see him.</p><p>“Alright, mate?” The man asked. Remus noticed his accent was French, but it was soft, as though he had been living in the U.K. for a long time.</p><p>“Yeah, hi.” Remus smiled. The café had the kind of aura that left him feeling warm and welcomed. There were naked lightbulbs floating from the ceiling, shelves full of books on the walls, and a faded blue radio playing quiet jazz.</p><p>“What can I get for you?” Remus looked at the chalkboard behind his head, eyes flicking through the overwhelming variety of hot drinks and snacks.</p><p>“I’ll uh… I’ll get a tea, please. And one of those lemon muffins – no, blueberry. Blueberry muffin.” The man laughed, and replied with a nod, moving away from the counter to fetch his order.</p><p>“That’ll be £1.85.” He said once he had returned. Remus frowned – that was the price of the muffin alone.</p><p>“What about the tea?” He asked.</p><p>“Ah,” he replied, with the air of a man who liked a layer of mystery, “first customer of the day. Free drink.”</p><p>“Oh. Thank you.”</p><p>“You’re very welcome. You want this to go?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah actually. I gotta get to work.” Remus said, looking at his watch.</p><p>“Highbourne Secondary, right?” Remus narrowed his eyes, panic shooting through his stomach. He’d been working there <em>one day</em>, how did he-</p><p>“Don’t look so worried.” The man replied laughing. “You work with James, right? He’s my best friend. He mentioned there was a new teacher. Tall as fuck, wears tweed, hipster glasses, curly hair. Reckoned there couldn’t be too many fitting that description in the area.”</p><p>Remus’ shock died down, and he founded himself laughing in relief.</p><p>“Let me guess – Sirius?” The man – Sirius – nodded in return, offering a hand over the counter for Remus to shake it.</p><p>“So, what did James tell you about me?”</p><p>“Pretty much just that you were short, French, and single.”</p><p>“Well, he’s not wrong.” Remus laughed at that, out of nerves if nothing else. He checked his watch again.</p><p>“Shit. I really should head off. Can’t really be late on my second day.” Sirius agreed, passing his muffin and tea over the counter. Remus had just opened his mouth to say goodbye, when Sirius spoke.</p><p>“Before you go can I,” Sirius chuckled and rubbed the back of his neck, “can I have your number?”</p><p>Remus faltered. Sirius was an attractive man, there was no doubting it. And five years ago, Remus might have <em>jumped </em>at the chance of something with him. But this wasn’t five years ago. Even having just met Sirius, Remus knew that he deserved more than an anxious insomniac with not even enough money to pay this month’s rent. All that, on top of the fact that he was HIV positive. What a fucking catch. But Remus had his shit together – he <em>did</em>. So, he took a pen from his breast pocket, and scribbled his number onto the scrap of paper that Sirius had slid across the counter to him.</p><p>“See you around, Remus.”</p><p>“Bye, Sirius.” He said, waving slightly as he left, his heart pounding.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“Wait, you met him? You met Remus?” James said, shocked, as he sipped on a hazelnut coffee in the backroom of Sirius’ café. It was late on a Tuesday, and when Sirius had called him and asked him to come, he had done so immediately.</p><p>“Why do you sound so upset by that? Thought you <em>wanted </em>us to meet.”</p><p>“Yeah,” James whined, “but I wanted to set you guys up! So I could come to your wedding and tell everyone that it was me.”</p><p>“Well, tough, Jamie.” Sirius replied, leaning forward on his elbows. “I guess fate just wanted this to happen more than you did.”</p><p>“Fuck fate! Fuck the universe!” James exclaimed, dramatic as ever, eyes crinkling in a grin as Sirius burst out laughing.</p><p>“James you are <em>married. </em>Stay away from fate.”</p><p>“Oh, um. On the subject,” James said, face suddenly serious. “I kinda have something to tell you.” Sirius’ face broke out into an ecstatic smile before James had even finished.</p><p>“No shit!” He jumped up from his seat, hands clasped behind his head. “Lily’s pregnant?” James nodded in response, smile equally as wide, and laughed as Sirius rounded the table and hugged hi tightly, ending up sat in his lap.</p><p>“You did always have a weird way of guessing what’s on my mind.”</p><p>“Because you’re shit at hiding things from me, Jamie.” Sirius said, his arms still around James’ neck. “But really. I’m so so happy for you guys.”</p><p>“Thanks, Pads."</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Remus had just locked the front door behind him when his phone started buzzing. He had stayed at school late that day – somehow, he had a whole pile of marking already, and the desk in his office was bigger than the one he had at home. Sighing, he kicked his shoes off, not bothering this time with the door, and answered his phone.</p><p>“Remus!” Came a very excited voice from the other end of the call.</p><p>“Guessing this is Sirius, then?”</p><p>“Who else sounds this fabulous?” Remus heard a whoosh, like Sirius was plonking himself down on a sofa.</p><p>“Probably Freddie Mercury. When he was alive.”</p><p>“You make a strong point there, Rems. Also honoured to be compared to him.”</p><p>“Legend.”</p><p>“Mm.” Sirius sounded as though there was something on the tip of his tongue, something that was apparently very very exciting.</p><p>“Come on, then. What’s got you in a tizz?”</p><p>“James is pregnant!” Sirius squealed down the phone, so loud that Remus had to move the phone away from his ear a little.</p><p>“James? Didn’t know he had a va-”</p><p>“Ew. Gross. I meant his wife – Lily.”</p><p>“I know, I know. That’s so cool, though! You gonna be godfather?” Remus asked.</p><p>“Probably not. I’m already godfather to their other kid.”</p><p>“Harry, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, He’s a sweet kid.”</p><p>“Mm, he sounds it.”</p><p>“But anyway, yeah, they’ll probably choose someone else. Maybe Reg, or Frank.” Sirius sounded like the smile he had started the call with hadn’t left his face.</p><p>“Reg? Your brother?”</p><p>“Yeah. He’s only a year younger than me so he always hung out with us when we were at school. He and James still get on really well.”</p><p>At some point during the call, Remus had moved to his kitchen/dining room/living room and was now sprawled across the sofa. When he ended the call, the clock read that it was gone half nine, and Remus swore when he realised how much he had crumpled his clothes. Standing up, he tried his best to straighten out any wrinkles, and headed over to the kitchen. It was too late for a proper dinner, but he knew his stomach would hate him later if he ate nothing at all, so he boiled the kettle and wolfed down some tea and too many biscuits, before heading over to his bedroom. Before he went to sleep that night, he found himself sending a quick text to Sirius.</p><p><em>SENT 10:03pm: </em>didn’t have time for dinner, twat. you owe me.</p><p><em>RECEIVED 10:11pm: </em>promise i’ll make it up to u ;)</p><p>Remus smiled, refusing to acknowledge his blush – it was dark anyway, nobody needed to know. For the first time in what felt like forever, he fell asleep easily.</p><p>The rest of the week seemed to speed by in a blur of lessons, suggestive texting, and teasing from James. He found himself getting up half an hour earlier every morning so that he could pop into Sirius’ café before catching the bus to work. One day, the pair had been so caught up in chatting that Remus had missed his bus, and Sirius had insisted on giving him a lift in. On his motorbike. It was fair to say that Remus hadn’t been that turned on since he was a teenager. It was also fair to say that he was having a bit of a crisis concerning this ridiculously attractive man that had crashed into his life.</p>
