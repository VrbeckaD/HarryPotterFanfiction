    <p>    Manhattan was beautiful at sunrise. </p><p>    The sun reflected off the towering skyscrapers, painting the streets and distant water with rippling gold light. Most people woke up when the sun was already far above them, burning down with a fierce heat. I preferred to be outside when the sun was just waking up, when its light was still gentle and the wind from the East ruffled my hair.</p><p>    Not every sunrise was special. Not every sunrise was unique. </p><p>    But they were all beautiful.</p><p> </p><p>     I knew that I had been lucky.</p><p>     Despite my strange existence, despite my lack of humanity, despite some of my less pleasant experiences, there was so much that <em>could </em>have happened, but <em>hadn't.</em> All is one. One is all. The world is an ever-turning wheel. By accepting what had happened, I had enabled myself to help other victims of fickle fortune.</p><p>     At some point, I had learned to embrace my waning sense of self-hatred. I had had learned to accept what I had become; after all, it was either accept my unnatural existence, or let my self-hatred consume me. </p><p>     ...dug a bit too deep there. Let's fast-forward back to the present. </p><p>     There are very few feelings that can compare with the joy of flight. Helicopter and aeroplane pilots took to the skies every hour, but they were normal people sitting in glorified tin cans. Skydiving was similar; it romanticized the idea of plummeting towards the Earth, confusing controlled falling with flying. But even skydiving didn't let you experience <em>true </em>freedom--the ability to go wherever you wanted, in whichever direction you wanted to go.</p><p>    Very few people would ever experience the raw joy of flight. The <em>rush</em> of feeling the wind across your face, the <em>thrill</em> of throwing yourself into the clouds--which actually wasn’t such a good idea. Too much moisture plus soaring at 40,000 feet would make for a very cold experience if you didn't have a jacket.</p><p>    Despite encountering some of the (less obvious) drawbacks of flight, which I endured in a pointless attempt to re visit and categorize that electrifying sensation, I had cultivated a strange sense of attachment for this particular ability.</p><p>    I loved and hated my gift, my freedom. The wings were beautiful and ugly at the same time; they bestowed a freedom no one else had. But they represented the price I had unwittingly paid when I was sent to this God-forsaken dimension.</p><p>     Not that God had ever cared about <em>any</em> dimension. It was hard to care about anything when you didn't exist. </p><p>     Let me be clear; there were, of course, the mythological beings of power that were tied strictly to <em>this</em> universe: the Greek gods, the Roman gods, the Celtic gods, etc. But there wasn't a <em>God. </em></p><p>     There was only <em>Truth.</em></p><p><em>    </em> Truth,<em> </em>that omnipotent, omnipresent bastard who seemed content with screwing my life up by booting me off to a strange dimension and leaving me to rot for a millennia. </p><p>     I suspected <em>It </em>took pleasure in my initial confusion, my inability to understand where I had been sent. That had been ages ago, when I still thought I had a chance of getting back home. It took me decades to figure out that I didn't belong on this world. \</p><p>    When that sank in, I tried the only other thing I could think of.</p><p>     Turns out wings weren't the only <em>gift </em>Truth had generously bestowed upon me. Apparently, I couldn't die.</p><p>     'Cause, yeah. That was a thing.</p><p>     I had tried, of course--drowning, hanging, burning to death. Other people had tried, too.</p><p>     It never worked.</p><p>     So, here I was, an immortal teenager stuck in a strange dimension, currently circling the skies of Manhattan while I waited for the sun to finish rising.</p><p>     It could be worse.</p><p>    I slowed the beat of my wings and swooped down to the edge of the cloud line. At this height, I suppose a person on the ground would take one look at me an write me off as an unusually-shaped bird. I took the opportunity to examine the city that spilled out beneath me. Manhattan was beautiful at sunrise, but I had seen this several times before now.</p><p>    That’s what I did when my mind refused to sleep--I flew, usually until the next morning. </p><p>     I landed outside a dense patch of foliage, careful to avoid hitting my wings on any branches as I carefully made my way through the trees. I had left all my belongings in a tent near a dead, hollowed-out tree--its ghostly branches stood out in stark defiance of the surrounding sea of green. Made it easy enough to find, but I would probably have to move soon (camping wasn't strictly forbidden in this patch of forest, but after 2 months I was leaning more towards the squatting side of the homeless spectrum).</p><p>     Besides, if I stayed in one place too long someone was bound to notice my tent--and from there, it was only a matter of time before they found the person who owned the tent. Maybe I could hang out at Camp-Half Blood for a while. If I was being completely honest with myself, there were times I missed living with others; it was rather lonely with no one to really talk to--excepting, of course, myself. </p><p>     Was it bad that I considered myself a decent substitute for human interaction?</p><p>     Of course not. I was just a...what was it called again? An introvert. I was just an introvert. Nothing dubious or concerning going on here. No siree Bob.</p><p>     I peeled off my wet jacket and pulled on some of the clothes I had recently washed at a shady coin laundromat. Quickly snatching my backpack, I took a running start and leapt, my body going impossibly high as I spread my wings once again before the azure sky. I never flew all the way to the school I was currently attending because the risk of being seen rose exponentially as I got closer to Manhattan's city limits. Not to mention that now, I had to worry about that up-and-coming vigilante Spiderman. He sounded like a great guy and all, but he attracted the wrong sort of attention--and I didn’t need SHIELD to become any <em>more</em> aware of my presence in New York. Besides, there was always the chance that one of Spiderman's "fans" from the Daily Bugle newspaper would catch the vigilante interacting with another would-be superhero (a.k.a. yours truly). It was already difficult enough to hide from secret government organizations like SHIELD; I didn't need the added stress of media coverage when I was already struggling to keep a low profile. Eventually, someone from SHIELD would come and check it out and I would probably be detained. At the very least, I would become common knowledge and would be pestered almost constantly.</p><p>     At worst, I would be collared and experimented on.</p><p>     I flew as far as I could, looking for a convenient construction site I could land in; no construction company in their right mind would start working when the sun wasn't even up. I spotted a newly reconstructed apartment building and landed on the more stable-looking portion of the roof. I glanced at the temporary garbage chute for a moment and considered my options, before finally deciding to take the stairs. Apparently work on this apartment complex had advanced far enough to put in glass windows, but not far enough to actually lock the doors--something I was grateful for. Soon enough I was stepping out the front door, surreptitiously closing it behind me as I made my way onto the sidewalk and headed towards Midtown.</p><p>     It was nice, being one of the few walking on the streets (or sidewalk). My only company consisted of a few wobbly people drunk out of their minds and the occasional over-enthusiastic dog-walker. The peace wouldn’t last for long, but I tried to enjoy it. With bustling crowds came trouble, and I really did try to avoid that as much as possible.</p><p>     Unfortunately, trouble always seemed to find me.</p><p>     An hour later I was still making my way through the city. I stopped at the entrance of an alleyway, asking myself for the millionth time why I hadn't just hailed a taxi. As I watched the surges of people pass by my little alley-way, I listened to a hundred-foot-tall news reporter called James Jonah Jameson ( I wonder if he bullied as a kid...) rattle off an entire list of reasons why Spiderman was such a menace. The dead hamster (read: mustache) above his lips made me crack a smile.</p><p>     All of a sudden, I heard tires squealing and a huge bang, along with a very large, very loud, very wet <em>plop</em>. I walked towards the commotion, which sounded like it was coming from the street at the other end of my alley. I took in the scene, half-hidden by some shadows and a conveniently-placed group of garbage cans--it looked like an armored truck had been making its usual rounds when <em>something</em> attacked it. The wheels of the truck had been stuck to the asphalt with some sort of...glue?</p><p>     Probably some advanced form of polyurethane. Some buff guy wearing a big metal backpack with an attached nozzle made his way inside the truck, carrying two carpet bags.  As far as I could tell, the man was just interested in taking the money. A blaring police car made its way around the corner, only to be covered with the same polyurethane mixture that was trapping the tires of the armored truck. Without any way to see, the police car skidded in circles until it was finally about to crash into the glass display window of a nearby cake shop. I winced, preparing for the oncoming <em>CRASH </em>to fill the air.</p><p>      A web shot out just in time to catch the police car...though the front of the shop was still utterly destroyed. The cop inside crawled out and searched for his savior. “I’m starting to think Jameson’s wrong about you, Spidey," he said, gazing at a certain web-headed ‘menace’ who was currently crawling down the side of a nearby apartment building.</p><p>     “Spread the word chief.” Spidey raised a hand in a salute. The hero sounded young, like he was in his late teens--he couldn't be older than, what, seventeen? This was the first time I had the opportunity to actually see Spiderman in action, and I planned on paying close attention. I hadn't had the opportunity to learn much about him before, and I was more than willing to take this chance to examine the vigilante-hero in his natural element. And anyway, if he managed to royally screw up, then someone would have to keep the innocent bystanders from getting maimed and/or killed.</p><p>     The buff man inside the armed truck slowly emerged, pointing the spray nozzle at the webslinger. “Hiya bug-boy." He grinned. " I knew that would draw you out.”</p><p>     Bug-boy?--actually, not a terrible nickname. The two seemed to have a stare off, right until the man--Trickster? Glue-guy? No, Trapster (I had read his SHIELD file at some point)--shot for Spiderman. Spider-boy managed to dodge the shot and followed with a sharp uppercut to Trapster’s chin.</p><p>     From what I could see, he was doing surprisingly well despite his apparent lack of demigod or magical anscestry. Trapster was thrown into a car next to the sidewalk, but got up quickly, leaving the crumpled hood of the now crushed tin-can with little difficulty. He threw some sort of glue-bomb (I mean, what else was I supposed to call it?) at Spidey, who got plastered against the wall behind him. Trapster took aim with the spay nozzle, but Spiderman managed to shoot inside the spray-glue-gun <em>thingie</em>, causing the metal canister on Glue-guy's back to explode, trapping the Trapster in a pile of goop.</p><p>     Bug-boy walked over to Trapster--who was conveniently in the center of the destroyed street--and  followed up with his trademark.</p><p>     “This is when I leave the friendly neighborhood Spiderman note." he teen said, cocking his head. "Can I borrow a pen?” Even if he managed to destroy an entire city block, at least the hero retained his lighthearted attitude. </p><p>      All of a sudden, a shadow fell over the block, covering the buildings in shades of black and grey. The SHIELD helicarrier was coming in low, which was surprising--Trapster wasn't on SHIELD's 'Most Wanted' list; he had barely made the lowest tier of SHIELD's 'Most Annoying' list. I quietly slipped out the opposite side of my alleyway, coming out to the street and walking away like nothing had happened. The sun was getting higher and higher in the sky--if I didn’t hurry I’d be late for school, which would eliminate my chances at <em>finally </em>getting that elusive perfect attendance award.</p><p> </p><p>---------</p><p> </p><p>     Normal school was, without a doubt, the most boring place ever. Imagine putting Michelangelo in a kindergarten finger-painting class, or asking Einstein how a potato clock works--ridiculous, right? Now imagine <em>me, </em>in <em>English 101</em> with a bunch of <em>angsty teens</em>. It wasn't that I knew everything there was to know--I just knew everything I needed to, like the basics of photon acceleration and triple integrals; and yet here I was, trying to fit in at Midtown High--the least exciting, least interesting high school on the face of the planet. I almost wished I was back at Hogwarts--almost.</p><p>     The lunch bell rang, and I gathered up my things. I usually went up to the roof to eat, but I’d have to navigate the halls to do that. Every time the bell would ring, they’d fill as fast as possible and were almost impossible to get through quickly. And then there was Flash. Flash Thompson was a bully who tended to pick on the ‘nerds’. I looked to where he was now. Today, his victim was a boy named ‘Peter Parker’.</p><p>     I could've walked away. In fact, I should've. Instead, watching Peter being bullied sparked something inside me, and my blood boiled.</p><p>     So I did something stupid. Something I would probably regret.</p><p>     I walked over quickly.</p><p>     “Hey Peter, c’mon. We don’t want to have to wait in line to get lunch.” He looked at me like I was crazy, but I stared intently at him, trying to somehow signal him to go along with it. Thankfully, musclehead was too busy talking to notice our not-so-subtle exchange.</p><p>     “Ooooohhh, Parker’s got a girlfriend," Flash grinned, his beady eyes locking onto a new target.</p><p>     My eyes narrowed and I sneered, even as I hunched my shoulders even more, “Shut up, Flash."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     “Excuse me?” He turned around, forgetting all about Peter. I bared my teeth angrily.</p><p>     “No wonder <em>you</em> don’t have a girlfriend.” Low blow, I know, but it was effective, based on how red-faced the bully got.</p><p>     “Well, at least I don’t have a loser for a boyfriend!” He snapped back.</p><p>     I paused for a minute, looking at Flash.</p><p>     “Never knew you swung that way,” I said, curling my lips into a smirk. Flash sputtered something unintelligible about my mother (may she rest in peace) while I scoffed.</p><p>     “I’m so offended” I said, rolling my eyes, “Why don’t I just go crawl into my hidey-hole and bawl my eyes out? Come on, Peter.” I grabbed the kid’s arm and dragged him with me to the cafeteria.</p><p>     We reached the table he and his friends occupied most frequently and stopped. Peter shuffled awkwardly.</p><p>     "Ummmm….,” he said, “...thanks. But why’d you help me?”</p><p>     “Because I wanted to. You're in my Calc and Physics classes, and I thought, 'Why not help out a fellow nerd?'" I smiled, not unkindly. As far as I could tell, Peter Parker was one of those quiet science geeks who could--and would--do some good in the world. I glanced around the cafeteria, trying to ignore the way he was hovering by me. "Are your friends coming soon?” I asked, still searching the cafeteria.</p><p>     “Yeah” He scratched his neck awkwardly.</p><p>     “Cool. I’ll leave, then. Just don’t leave them for the rest of the day, if you can help it." I said, sighing. "I have a feeling that Flash’ll be back with a vengeance if he can get you alone.” I gave him a Cheshire grin and turned to leave. </p><p>     “Hey wait!” I turned back around.</p><p>     “Do you want to sit with my friends and I?” Peter asked. Somehow, the kid’s friends had magically materialized; a redheaded girl--Mary J. Watson, I think--and the ever-so-famous Harry Osborne.</p><p>     “These are your friends?” I recognized them, had seen Peter hanging out with them before, but I wanted to make sure before leaving Parker in their dubiously capable teenage hands.</p><p>     “Yeah. So? Want to eat lunch with us?” Peter looked at me with the hint of a smile on his lips.</p><p>     “No, I think I'll pass." I said back. I saw no need to forcefully insert myself into whatever weird triangle of friendship they had going on. "Go eat lunch with people you know. Don’t waste your time with me.” I walked away as Peter--perhaps a little hesitantly--turned back to his friends and pursed my lips, absentmindedly trying to whistle</p><p>I never did get the hang of whistling.</p><p>     As I continued down the hall I considered my options for the day. Maybe I should just ditch school today--I could feel my brain rotting with every minute I spent in this white-washed prison.</p><p> </p><p>-----------</p><p> </p><p>     “Who was that Peter?” Mary Jane asked, slinging her arm around Peter's shoulder and steering him to sit at their lunch table.</p><p>     “Yeah, do you finally have a girlfriend?" Harry smirked, setting down his tray.</p><p>     “C’mon Harry,” Peter groaned. Was that all anyone could ever think about? First Flash, and now his friends. Peter turned to M. J. ”I don’t know who she is. I think she’s in a few of my classes, but I haven't really talked to her before. Actually, I don't think I've talked to her before today--she stopped Flash from sticking me in my locker again.” </p><p>     Harry groaned as he sat down. "Locker-knocker time <em>again?</em>"  </p><p>     M. J. smiled sympathetically. "You know, Peter, I can't believe he's still doing that after all these years. You should stand up to him, show him that you're not that easy to push around." her voice gained enthusiasm with every word as Harry started chuckling.</p><p>     "Yeah, Peter," Harry grinned, "how long has Flash been bullying you, now?"</p><p>     "Too long." Peter replied sullenly, finally taking a seat next to M. J. "You know, maybe it's time--"</p><p>     <em>BOOM.</em></p><p>     The entire cafeteria shook, students screaming and running from the crumbling hole that had just been blasted through the cafeteria wall. Three figure emerged from the flying clouds of dust, revealing themselves to be Thundra, The Wizard, and Klaw.</p><p>    As the dust settled, Wizard spoke. “We are the Frightful Four, and we have reason to believe that <em>Spiderman</em> attends this school!”</p><p> </p><p>    ...<em>Well, shit.</em></p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p>       </p><p>     I had (finally) made my way out of the school, and I was now heading to a nearby pizzeria. I worked at a MgRonald’s after school, so I could get discounted meals there, but hanging out at work while I was supposed to be in school wasn’t really an option. I still wanted lunch, though, so as an (for all intents and purposes) immortal teenager, pizza was the obvious choice.</p><p>     I heard a muffled crash and looked up, taking out my earbuds to listen for any screams--there was dust billowing in the direction of the school. My first thought: I should go to help--</p><p>     --but aside from overeager superheroes, there was also SHIELD to consider. I didn't want to step in unless a situation was really desperate, since acting within full view of half the city would blow the cover I had carefully maintained for nearly seventy years. Besides, the helicarrier had interfered this morning when <em>Trapster</em> was detained--there was no way an attack on a High School would escape their attention. I put my head back down and put my earbuds back in. Until SHIELD lost control, I was going to stay out of superhero business. Besides, if they found out about <em> me, </em> they could find out about Hogwarts, Wizards, Camp-Half-Blood, and Monsters--and, you know, <em>me</em>--and that would most definitely <em>not</em> be good.</p><p>         I walked into the pizzeria and ordered quickly, walking out with a glorious, piping hot pepperoni delicacy. I hadn’t eaten anything since yesterday, and the pizza was a mouth-watering piece of art. I resisted the urge to eat it yet--I could smell rain in the air. Hopefully I’d get off work before it started, but that was unlikely.</p><p>     Oh well.</p><p>     That’s what I get for not owning an umbrella.</p><p> </p><p>---------</p><p> </p><p>        My shift at MgRonalds ended quickly, and it wasn't long before I was making my way to the outer edges of the city. I was going to try and break into SHIELD’s databases again tonight, but first I had to make my way to the helicarrier. I reached a nondescript, abandoned sea-side harbor, covered in layers of grime and graffiti, and let my wings emerge. Running to the edge of the dock and jumping off, I snapped my wings open and pushed down, <em>hard</em>, getting back into the rhythm of flying. Soon enough I was spiraling upwards, the pelting rain feeling like hundreds of tiny needles against my body.</p><p>     Last time I had...<em> visited </em>...the SHIELD helicarrier, I had set off the alarms almost immediately. As I got climbed upwards, though, red lights and blaring alarms filled the air--it seemed that SHIELD already had an unwelcome visitor. I climbed higher to get a better view of the topmost part of the helicarrier, the sound of battle drawing me closer until a flash of red and blue spandex quickly gave away the culprit.</p><p>     There was Spiderman, in all his arachnid-esque glory, dodging flying projectiles and automated defense bots. Had SHIELD finally tried to recruit him?--no, they wouldn't be attacking him if they wanted to recruit him. Or would they?</p><p>     Nick Fury's mind had always worked in strange ways; you could practically <em>smell </em>the crazy on him.</p><p>     Until I knew more about Spiderman, I would just follow my normal protocol; I'd have to be careful not to let him--or anyone else--see me. I set down on the helicarrier and crouched on one knee. I could feel the energy coursing through me as I clapped my hands together and slapped them on the surface of the helicarrier. The red light went unnoticed amongst the explosions.</p><p>     I dissolved my wings again and dropped through the newly-made hole, hurrying through the halls. I just needed to find a port and a keyboard, and I would be set. I looked through several doors and saw workers rushing around like a disturbed nest of agitated ants. In the commotion, I sat down at a computer, plugged in my USB, and started downloading--no, it's not that simple, and <em> no</em>, I'm not going into more detail about the whole process. The world doesn't need a bunch of not-so-super-villains who are magically able to hack into secure SHIELD files.</p><p>     Throughout my (many) previous visits, I had downloaded all the files except for the ones concerning rogue mutants and superheroes who had yet to be put under the thumb of SHIELD. These files were apparently some of the most encrypted since, in the event that SHIELD <em> was </em> hacked, SHIELD didn’t want whoever did the hacking to be able to turn potential allies into very bad (or very dead) not-allies.</p><p>     After twenty tense minutes, the files had finished un-encrypting and downloading onto the USB, so I carefully pulled it out and silently exited the room, fighting the urge to break into a run as soon as I saw the hall was empty. I had to hurry and get out before anyone noticed my presence, but I had to avoid being conspicuous, had to avoid drawing attention to myself. I quickly retraced my steps back to the hole in the ceiling I had created, but stopped when I saw who was waiting for me in the shadows of the no longer empty hallway.</p><p>      “So, we finally meet.” In front of me was a red-haired, black-suited beauty who was well-known in most underground circles.</p><p>      Black Widow, professional spy. Master of several forms of defense, excelling at hand-to-hand combat, and capable of imagining 100 different ways to dispatch her opponent in very few seconds. However, the woman in front of me was also less-commonly known as Natasha Romanoff, secret SHIELD agent, and thee ultimate <em>femme fatale</em>.</p><p>      To be honest, her skill set made me nervous. I wasn’t entirely out of my league, and if worst came to worst I could probably pull out some of the cards I had hidden up my sleeves--but she was a professional at hand-to-hand combat, and very experienced. And I did <em>not </em>want to get held up long enough for backup to arrive.</p><p>        “Not much of a talker, then?" she said as the shadows behind her shifted, revealing Clint Barton, also known as Hawkeye, in all his blonde, blue-eyed glory. He spoke, sharp eyes piercing through my hooded stare. "You know, you’ve been perplexing Fury for quite some time. I have to admit, it would be entertaining if you weren’t a legitimate threat. So, are you going to come quietly?” Were they talking because they wanted to give me a chance to escape? Unlikely--they had been lying in wait for me. Or were they stalling? Hawkeye's file had mentioned his talkative tendencies, but Black Widow was more of the 'silent but deadly' type. I had to admit, I was a bit flattered that I was a worthy target for SHIELD's famous STRIKE team--even if their presence made my escape about a hundred times harder.</p><p>      I brought my hand up to my face, checking to make sure my hood was still up. If I flew straight up to the hole, maybe I would be able fit through it before--my head whipped around at the sound of footsteps. More people were coming down the hallway--two, from the sounds of things. The dynamic duo must have noticed too, and and three of us looked towards the two figures who had joined us. SHIELD Director Nick Fury, in all his silent glory, stood next to a wet, very bedraggled-looking Spiderman.</p><p>     Guess they <em>were </em>trying to recruit the superhero.</p><p>     Natasha spoke. “That the kid?” I really didn't remember her being this chatty in her files.</p><p>     “Yeah” Finally, Director Fury; a normal, stoically silent SHIELD operative. Even if he did have a pirate eye patch.</p><p>     “Good. Give us a hand?” Hawkeye nodded towards Spider man, who jumped at the sudden question. I slunk along the wall, making my way closer to the jagged hole in the ceiling.</p><p>      “You want my help? But with what? Them?” he gestured towards me, and I froze in my tracks, still trying to blend into the wall behind me. It didn't work, and Spiderman just looked at me strangely.</p><p>     “Okaaay." he drew the word out like a rubber band, snapping it back into place as he asked another question. "Are you another bad guy? Am I going to have to kick your butt too?”</p><p>     I looked at him with a hint of longing--wondering what it was like to be that gung-ho about obliterating evil--before I spoke in a quiet voice. “You guys really are fun. Really." They seemed shocked to hear me say anything. Was this the first time I had spoken to SHIELD agents? I suppose I did sound rather young for someone able to break into SHIELD as many times as I have over the years. “I should cause a ruckus more often," I continued, "--it's entertaining.” I smiled at their confusion. Good. It was never good to give SHIELD a clear train of thought to follow. Making them focus on little details kept them safely away from the bigger picture.</p><p>      And besides, it was fun to mess with people.</p><p>      “Who do you work for?” Fury said. Always suspicious, he was. Always<em> looking </em> for the agenda, the 'master plan'. I suppose that’s why he was chosen as Director, though.</p><p>       “Not telling.” With my hood still up, they couldn’t see anything other than the cavernous darkness that hung over my face. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other places to be.” I ran for the hole, ignoring the movements of the three SHIELD agents and Spiderman's fumbling. Within moments, I had unfurled my wings and taken off.</p><p> </p><p>---------</p><p> </p><p>     Soon enough, I was back in my tent, pulling out my old, scratched and patched-up laptop, and plugged in my USB. “Time to see what they’ve got.” I chuckled to myself.</p><p>     Part of the reason I wanted this list was to see how much info they had on me, and whether they thought I was a threat. The other reason I hacked SHIELD was to see if they were monitoring any demigods or wizards. I tried to keep track of any threats to the secrecy of both the magical and mythological worlds--it was kind of like a, "You scratch my back, I protect your existence," sort of deal.</p><p>Besides, SHIELD was probably the best database in the world for information on modern events, other spy agencies, and forays into nee scientific fields--most specifically, forays into inter-dimensional travel. I had hoped that there would be a way for me to get home, but so far nothing had turned up. The next step was to write Albus and ask him if I could use the Hogwarts library to search for a--insert shudder--<em> magical </em> solution. I had wanted to avoid it, but I was running out of options.</p><p>      I pulled up the files I had downloaded onto the USB and started scrolling down the list. There were several plain (but interesting?) codenames, like ‘Cloak’ and ‘Dagger’. I looked at those first, searching for myself, or my...associates. I found on a file named ‘Oceanus’ (now that was an interesting code name) only to see a picture of the one and only infamous Perseus Jackson pop up. Wonderful. I read their profile of him--there were articles about Perseus' fall from the Gateway Arch and his 'kidnapping' incident a couple years ago, not to mention a lengthy section describing his school-related 'accidents' and subsequent expulsions. I still didn't understand why Chiron let him leave camp, even after his godly parent was revealed. Thankfully, SHIELD weren’t too suspicious of the demigod's position as a potential terrorist. However, I would still have to get this to Chiron. The increases in technological advancement had made gathering information all too easy for certain organization--which was what made breaking into SHIELD so useful. But this increasing ability to put two and two together had definitely brought the wrong sort of attention to monsters and demigods alike--I didn't believe that SHIELD was the only group suspicious of supposedly 'troubled' teenagers who all went to the same summer camp. I sighed and scrolled a little farther on the list of files--there it was. </p><p>     Or, rather, there <em>I</em> was.</p><p>     I opened up my profile (they had apparently named me 'Crow'--ridiculous, right?), and saw that they had very little information on me. Good--I wanted to keep it that way. The only things they had managed to pin down were that I was (most likely) female, I had wings and likely some sort of energy-based power, and I was interested in SHIELD’s information. They had most likely gleaned this much because of my frequent visits. However, now that I had finally acquired the last major files I was missing, I could reduce my visits to once every year (depending on the amount of interesting occurrences and information I wanted to...borrow [steal]).</p><p>     I looked at the time on the bottom right corner of my computer screen and nearly had a heart attack--it was already the next morning. I had spent all night reading through the SHIELD files, and I wasn't even halfway done.</p><p>      The weak sunlight struggled to reach me through the thick fabric of the tent as I got dressed. I was getting ready a little later than usual, but I could afford it, so long as I landed inside the city instead of stopping on the outskirts. I stuffed my laptop into my bag--I was bringing it today because I wanted to finish looking over the files from SHIELD. After a running start I jumped, unfurling my wings. Even though I never got bored of flying, it would still take some time to get to Midtown High.</p><p>      But, now that I done gathering info from SHIELD, I didn't have to attend Midtown High School anymore...I could move back to Camp-Half Blood. I’d have to give Chiron a call and see if he could negotiate my transfer in a parent-principal conference. Or maybe I could just get myself expelled. I’d have to quit my job, too, but I’d worry about that later today. For now, I was trying to think of a covert place to land</p><p> </p><p>---------</p><p> </p><p>        I made my way through the piles of junk, careful not to get cut by the many jagged pieces of rusted metal. It wasn’t like any injuries would last very long, but I really liked my hoodie and couldn’t really afford to rip any more holes in any of my clothes.</p><p>        This junkyard wasn’t too close to the school, and seemed devoid of people. Ergo, it made the best available place for me to land. Though I didn’t like landing so close to where I could be seen, I had used this junkyard before. I turned a corner and stopped at what I saw.</p><p>        “Flash?!”</p><p>        The teenager in question whipped around, just as surprised as I was. “Who are you? What are you doing here? How do you know my name?”</p><p>        “I go to your school.” He didn’t even remember who I was.</p><p>        “Wait a minute, you’re the girl who knows puny-I mean, Parker! What are you doing here?”</p><p>       “Uh...taking a shortcut to school. Better question is, what are you doing here?”</p><p>       “Nothing! I just...uhh...I...I was working on my car yesterday when I noticed how much...extra scrap metal I had, so I decided to...drop it off here. On my way to school. Yeah.”</p><p>       I raised my eyebrows. “You live here, don’t you.” It wasn’t really a question. And it wasn’t really that hard to figure out. The Flash from school wouldn’t be caught dead in  a junkyard, but I had all too much experience with fake facades.</p><p>       “No I don’t!”</p><p>       "Allright, allright.” I raised my hands in a placating gesture before dropping them. Now it made sense as to why he was a bully. He didn’t have much in life, but he didn’t want anyone to know. If they did, he’d probably have been teased as mercilessly as the kids he picked on. Not that that made it right--it’s just I could kind-of relate. Kind-of. “Don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone. I’m quitting school soon, anyway.”</p><p>        “Why?”</p><p>        I laughed. “You’re not the only one with a secret life, Flash. Just keep this in mind--The measure of a man is how he’s touched the lives of those around him.”</p><p>        “Uhh…sure...” I took one look at his furrowed brows and sighed.</p><p>        “...Nevermind.” I turned to leave</p><p>        “Hey wait! You promise you won’t tell anyone, right?”</p><p>        “Yeah, don’t spend your time worrying about me.” I gave a two-fingered salute and walked away, leaving Flash to mull over what I said.</p><p>        Then again, he probably wouldn’t do much of that. I just hoped he didn’t waste his time worrying about what I might do. I obviously wasn’t going to tell anyone, but I didn’t want him to wind up worrying that I might. I stopped walking. I was being utterly ridiculous, and overthinking the problem way too much. High School was actually making me worry!</p><p>      I started walking again, a little slower now, determined not to care if I arrived late.</p><p> </p><p>      I arrived at the school as soon as the first bell rang—and as soon as Flash did. I hurried into the school building, not even glancing his way. As soon as I got into my first class, I sat down in the back and pulled out my laptop. If the teacher asked, I could just say that I was take notes or something. The teacher probably wouldn’t even care, though.</p><p>       School went by in a blur, and before I knew it, it was time for lunch. I hadn’t found much else of interest in the SHIELD files, but there had been a note on Spiderman’s file. It looked like they were planning to stick him with a bunch of newbie-superheroes. I looked up. The worst of the crowd of kids had already made their way to the cafeteria…except for Flash. Once again, he was trying to force the Peter kid into a locker. I walked up (again) and said, quite clearly, “Flash. Leave him be.”</p><p>       He turned towards me, and a jolt of recognition flashed in his eyes.  He shoved Peter into the lockers again, but then turned and walked away.  </p><p>     Was I pissed? Yes. Did I currently want to cave his face in? Of course. Did I realize that this was the perfect opportunity to get myself expelled? There wasn’t a doubt in my mind. Did I punch the sorry jerk? Unfortunately, no.</p><p>      “Sorry about that. I just don’t like bullies. You okay?” I pulled Peter out of his locker and handed him his backpack, which he grabbed and draped over one shoulder.</p><p>       Peter just nodded and stood silently for a few more seconds before he said, ”Can you teach me your trick?” he smiled.</p><p>      “Oh." I blinked. "There isn’t really a trick. Hey, where are your friends?” I remembered yesterday that he had agreed it was a good idea to stick close to his friends while Flash might still be out for revenge.</p><p>      “Didn’t you hear? Harry’s in the hospital because of the attack yesterday, and MJ’s out trying to get an interview with that Spiderman guy.”Peter adjusted his grip on his backpack as he spoke. I couldn't tell if he was nervous or just worried.</p><p>     “Someone actually attacked Midtown High? I thought this place was supposed to be the most boring school on the planet." Honestly, the one day I skipped out on school, something interesting had happened. I remembered seeing a giant plume of dust tising from around the school yesterday, but I didn't expect some villian to be brave (or stupid) enough to actually attack a school. I was willing to bet that whichever villain had attacked Midtown was current being hunted down by SHIELD's local forces.</p><p>     “Yeah. Didn’t you know?”</p><p>     “No, I left early.”</p><p>     “Oh.” Parker shifted a bit awkwardly, not really knowing what to say.</p><p>     “Is Harry okay?” It seemed like the right thing to ask--I mean, the guy was in the hospital.</p><p>     “Yeah. He’s just going to have to stay in the hospital for the next day or so.” Peter smiled a little brighter, but he kept glancing down the hall, towards the cafeteria. I decided to have.pity on him.</p><p>     “I’m sorry. Hey, I’m probably keeping you from your lunch. I’ll leave you be.” I finally turned to leave.</p><p>     “Hey wait!” I turned back, feelin an odd sort of deja vu. “Come and sit with me!”</p><p>     Um. What? No.</p><p> </p><p>     “You’re always alone. So come and eat lunch with MJ and me.”This kid was way to trusting. What, I save him from getting bullied twice, and suddenly I'm Buddah?</p><p>     “Oh. That's nice of you, but—“</p><p>     “Hey, Parker!” A new voice interrupted me before I could finish, and I valiantly fought the urge to sigh in exasperation.</p><p>     Both Peter and I turned towards a group of people who were coming our way. There were four of them--a, for lack of a better descriptor, "buff" African American guy, a <em>short</em> Hispanic guy, a blonde surfer dude, and a Hispanic girl. Talk about cultural diversity.</p><p>     Peter looked at them for a bit before finally asking, “Wait, do I know you? <em> Any </em> of you?”</p><p>     “Say hello to your new classmates. I’m Danny Rand.” Surfer dude spoke like a surfer.</p><p>     “Luke Cage,” <em>man</em> was this guy buff! He looked like the kind of person who cracked walnuts open for fun.</p><p>     “Sam Alexander,” even though I knew his name, I still had the inexplicable urge to call this kid Sparky.</p><p>     “Eva Allala.” Now she seemed like an intellectual. Someone who played chess, who made lists for the sake of making lists.</p><p>Seeing Peter's confusion, Eva spoke again. “ Think about it.”</p><p>     We all stared at Peter as he did a double take, his jaw nearly hitting the floor.</p><p>     Sam spoke, his tone more than a little sarcastic, “Oh yeah, some idiot gave Fury the bright idea that we needed ‘me time’, away from SHIELD”."</p><p>I furrowed my brows. What did these kids have to do with SHIELD?</p><p>     The girl named Eva had been staring at me since her little quartet had walked up (I mean, I kind of assumed she was the leader of this rag-tag representational group). “Hey, who’s this?” she asked, and suddenly turned towards Parker. What, she couldn't be bothered to ask me? I mean, I was standing right there.</p><p>      Peter glanced at me and then said, nervously, “Heeey, this is great. Really, really…great. I just gotta go...talk to..a guy.” he ran off, as fast as he could.</p><p>     “I wonder what’s up.” I said quietly.</p><p>     “Who knows. He’s a real web-head.” The kid named Sam had spoken. I looked at him, eyebrow raised, and he seemed to realize what he had said. “I...I mean...I don’t really like Spiderman, so that’s kind of my insult. Anyway, I’m Same. I mean, Sam.”</p><p>     “Yeah, I got that.” This kid (whoever he was) was weird. I turned to walk away.</p><p>     “Hey, aren’t you going to tell us your name?”</p><p>     “Nope.” I didn’t trust them. And there wasn’t any point to getting to know these people--I’d be leaving soon, anyways. I sighed and made my way to the front office. As I didn’t have a phone myself, I’d have to use one of theirs to call Chiron--it was time to get out of here.</p><p>     It didn't take long to convince the lady at the front desk to let me borrow her phone--though she did look at me for a moment when I told her I didn't have one of my own. She was probably trying to figure out whether I was lying or not, but I just plastered a smile on my face and held it there until she handed over her office phone.</p><p>     I had to tell her what the number was (apparently office phones were so technologically advanced that teenagers couldn't be trusted to work them on their own) and after a few rings, there was a *click* as someone picked up the only (publicly known) phone in all of Camp Half-Blood. The phone looked like a traditional landline phone, but had been...charmed? magicked? by Hermes to allow for untraceable communication for those demigods and satyrs that were sent out into the normal world, but looked "too young" to make their own decisions. The phone sat in the Big House and was rarely used; in fact, few campers knew it existed unless they had to.  </p><p>      “Hello?" a voice spoke through the receiver. "May I ask who this is?”</p><p>      “Hey Chiron.” I responded, only a little wary as I considered what I could talk about in front of the office lady, who had begun typing something on her computer.</p><p>      “Oh, hello again Raven. How are you doing?” Chiron's tone lightened considerably when he discovered it was me on the other end of the phone.</p><p>      “I’m all right." I smiled, even though he couldn't see me. "Hey, can you come down to Midtown High? I’d like to get out of here, but they need the consent of a parent or guardian. I could just leave, but I’d rather not raise any flags.” After all, I might want to use this alias in the future--I didn't want to give anyone a troubled history to trace.</p><p>      “Are you sure?" he sounded hesitant. "It might be good for you to finish a full year of school...”</p><p>      “Chiron, the only reason I agreed to go to school here in the first place was because it provided a decent cover story." 'For my SHIELD helicarrier excursions.' I finished silently, glancing at the office lady in front of me who was still typing away on her computer.</p><p>      “Very well." Chiron sighed. "If you’re sure, then I’m sure I can have Argus bring me over tomorrow. Can you set up an appointment?”</p><p>      “Yeah...just give me a moment." I glanced at the office lady and spoke. "Excuse me?"</p><p>      She looked up, horn-rimmed glasses flashing with light. "What is it?”</p><p>      “Do you know how I could set up a meeting with the principal?” I asked, plastering another polite smile on my face.</p><p>      “May I ask what time you’d like to have the conference? And what would it be for?” she asked expectantly, bringing something up on her computer screen and positioning her hands above her keyboard.</p><p>      I glanced at the reflection in her glasses--she had brought up some sort of calendar on her computer. I spoke, remembering when Chiron had said he could come over. “I am planning to withdraw from this school.”</p><p>      “Is it because of the recent attack?” She asked, looking at me over the edge of her glasses. Did she even need them? Or were they just for reading?</p><p>      In a city where SHIELD, superheroes, and various villains made their homes, I wasn't surprised their was an attack on Midtown. Still, using yesterday's attack would give me the perfect excuse to leave. “Yes, my guardians have become concerned because of recent disturbances in Manhattan.”</p><p>      “Well, you wouldn’t be the first one. Do you have a preferred date?"</p><p>     “Tomorrow?”</p><p>      “That should work." she said with one eyebrow raised. "What time?” she asked, putting something else into her computer.</p><p>      I crossed my fingers, hoping that I wouldn't have to guess a hundred different times before I found one that worked.</p><p>      “What about 3:30?” I asked, biting the inside of my cheek.</p><p>      “All right. 3:30, tomorrow.  May I have your ID, and the name  of your guardian?” she smiled, waiting for my answer.</p><p>      “All right.” I handed my school ID to her.</p><p>      "Marrissa? That’s a pretty name."</p><p>      To be honest, I had forgotten which name I had used for my school ID.</p><p>      “Thank you, ma’am. Oh--and the name of my guardian is Chiron. Chiron Brunner.” I smiled again before speaking once more into the phone. "Chiron, are you still there?"</p><p>     "Yes" I could hear the smile in his voice. "Have you established a time?"</p><p>     "Is 3:30 okay for you?”</p><p>     “Of course." there was a muffled crash on his end, as well as what sounded like shouting. "I’m sorry to cut this so short, but it seems the Stolls have played another of their pranks on the Ares cabin.” Chiron said quickly as weariness seeped into his voice.</p><p>      I laughed. “Don’t worry about me. Just keep them alive until I can get revenge on them for my Birthday.”</p><p>      He ended the call, and I put the phone down. The lady at the front desk looked at me strangely, and I smiled in return. "Thank you for letting me borrow your phone."       </p><p>      “You're welcome." She said, eyes already drifting back towards her computer screen, whose reflection shone white in her eyes. "You have a nice day, alright?” she said, no longer looking at me as she went back to doing whatever she was doing before I came along</p><p>       “Yeah, you too.” I mumbled, walking out of the office and past the voices coming out of the principal’s office.</p><p>        That’s when I heard it.</p><p>       “No can do. Fury wants you where he can keep an eye on you.” said an authoritative-sounding voice--though I didn't recognize it as the principal's.</p><p>      Peter came storming out and bumped into me. He mumbled an apology (or something that sounded like it) before hurrying on, talking to himself the whole way. I was incredibly confused at this point. What did Fury want with Peter? I watched him go, slightly concerned—wait. Wait, I had seen the name ‘Peter Parker’ before in the SHIELD files, I was sure of it! I just had to find out where!</p><p>     I practically ran to my next class, plunked myself down, got my laptop out and opened the SHIELD files. I typed in the keywords ‘Peter Parker’. When I saw what came up, I couldn’t help but let loose a strangled chuckle. Peter Parker...was Spiderman! The nerdy science kids who was always being bullied by Flash was secretly a superhero that could bench-press buses. But then...then that meant that those 4 kids who came up to him...the way they acted, must have known his superhero identity, which meant that they were superheroes, too! I quickly searched for their names and couldn’t believe what came up. These were the kids that Fury was trying to turn into the Spidey-team! It all made sense! To be honest, I was almost regretting my decision to leave, now. Almost.</p><p>     It was then that I realized that some of the kids were staring at me. I met each of their eyes until they turned away, embarrassed. Teenagers were creepy when they stared.</p><p>     One of the boys in class approached me “Hey,--! Actually, I still don’t know your name.” It was the brawny African-American again. What was his name, Powerman? No, I’d better call him Luke.</p><p>     “Hey Luke. Eva, Danny. Sam.” I said, nodding to each person respectively. They looked at me strangely, and then Rocket-boy spoke.</p><p>     “You’re that girl from earlier, right? You know the webhea--I mean, Peter, right? “</p><p>     “Not really. I’ve only met ‘webhead’ twice.” I smiled as Sam Alexander winced.</p><p>     “Oh. Okaaay. Well, we’re going to be in your classes for the rest of the year.” he said, trying to cover up his wince with a roll of his shoulders.</p><p>     “Actually, tomorrow’s my last day here. I’m leaving because of the incident with the Frightful Four. My guardians are worried about me, so I’m going to move back to Long Island.”</p><p>     “Oh, cool. Hey what’s that?” he pointed to my computer, which I realized still had the files on them and Spiderman open.</p><p>     “Nothing.” I slammed the laptop closed and winced. I hoped I didn’t break it. It was already hard enough to find the money to buy a decent second-hand computer. If I had to get it repaired, I’d have to use all the money I’d saved up from work.</p><p>     They all looked at me again. “Sorry, I’ve got to go. I grabbed my backpack and laptop and rushed out. All I could do was hope that Sam hadn’t seen anything.</p><p>      It was then that I realized I’d walked out before class could even start.</p><p> </p><p>-----Back to our favorite team…-----</p><p> </p><p>      “Did you guys see that?” Sam was still wondering if he had really seen what he thought.</p><p>      Eva looked at him “Obviously not, <em>buckethead. </em>Do you mind telling us what the big idea is?”</p><p>       “I agree. She seemed rather upset. What exactly did you see?” Danny had finally joined the conversation.</p><p>       “I think…I saw <em>us </em>“</p><p>       “What do you mean <em>us?” </em>Eva furrowed her brows, confused like all the other teammates.</p><p><em>     </em> <em>“</em>I mean I saw us! She had files on our team open, like, the secret SHIELD ones! I think she knows about us!”</p><p>      “Sam are you sure? If so, then we need to get this to Coulson, <em>now.”</em></p><p>      “Of course I’m sure!” Sam said angrily.</p><p>     Danny spoke up, “Don’t you think she could be a SHIELD agent, too?”</p><p>     Luke reluctantly nodded in agreement. “Yeah, she could’ve been positioned here to spy on Peter, gather information and stuff.”</p><p>     “No,” said Eva sharply, “if she was part of SHIELD then she should have known who we were and why we’re here. We would know, too--SHIELD wouldn't keep that from us. Besides, she said she only met Peter twice.”</p><p>      “Whatever, this is serious. We need to get this to Coulson.” Sam said with impressive finality as the quartet scurried to the principal's office.</p><p>       They burst in; luckily, the new Principal--Principle Coulson--was alone in his office. </p><p>      "Sir!" Eva exclaimed, putting her hands down on the Principal's desk. "We think one of the students here has access to SHIELD's secure files!"</p><p>      Agent Coulson looked at the four teenage superheroes with furrowed brows. "That can't be possible. SHIELD doesn't have any undercover agents posing as students."</p><p>     "We saw them--one of the girls in our class, she was reading them in class." Luke spoke up, stepping forward until he was next to Eva.</p><p>     “And who had these files?” Coulson asked, fingers steepling as he leaned forwards.</p><p>      “We do not know her name,” said Danny</p><p>     “But she’s talked to Peter,” Eva interjected.</p><p>     “And she always wears her jacket hood up," Sam finished.</p><p>     “A hood?” Agent Coulson perked up at that tidbit. It was a long shot, but...</p><p>     “Yes, sir. But do you have any idea how she got those files?” asked Eva, stepping away from the desk as Coulson stood up.</p><p>     “Yes. There is an individual--codename Crow--who has been regularly infiltrating SHIELD and copying files. We haven’t been able to catch them until now, but I believe that, thanks to Nova’s...perceptiveness, we may have finally caught our culprit." Sam smiled in self-satisfaction while Aent Coulson pretended not to notice. "Please, is there anything else you can tell me about her?”</p><p>     After a moment of silence, Luke spoke up. “She mentioned that tomorrow was her last day.”</p><p> </p><p>---------</p><p> </p><p>       I had finally quit my job. I just had to get through tomorrow, and then I would be done. Done with all this drama, and I’d finally be back at Camp-Half-Blood. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d talked to a nymph or satyr. I could almost picture the strawberry fields, practically baking in the afternoon sun, th shouts of training demigods ringing across camp...I shook my head. I needed to stop this. I had to concentrate on my surroundings. Until Chiron picked me up, I had to be aware that SHIELD could suspect me.</p><p>        Something flashed in the corner of my eye. I stopped and looked around. Maybe it had just been my imagination…I sensed something coming towards me, and instinctively I dove hearing something hit the wall behind me. I turned and examined it. Webbing? But that meant--I dove again, narrowly avoiding another shot.</p><p>        “I know you’re out there! Come on, Spiderman! Show yourself! I bet your team’s out there, too. C’mon, at least let me see if I’m right!”</p><p>        “Hey there...Crow? Sorry, but I’ve got orders from Coulson to take you in. Maybe we can talk after you come quietly?” Spidey almost looked abashed as he scratched the back of his neck. He was <em>such</em> an awkward teenager.</p><p>        “It’s funny, but every time someone suggests I come quietly they wind up on the wrong end of my fist. Sorry, but I like living life the way I do now. Anyway, are we going to do this? I was planning on going home early tonight, but I guess that’s kind of impossible. But I’m not the only one who has to worry about school, isn’t that right--Peter?”</p><p>        “So you did know?” The wall-crawler stiffened, shifting on the wall he was...well...<em>crawling.</em></p><p>        “Yeah; found out today, actually. But don’t worry. I’m good at keeping secrets.”</p><p>        “Can we hurry this along? Listening to you two jabber is getting really boring,” a random voice so <em>rudely</em> interjected.</p><p>        “And you’re Nova? Or Sam? Which do you prefer?”</p><p>        “It won’t matter, ‘cause pretty soon you’ll be seeing stars!” he swooped in, trying to take me out with brute force. That cheesy line almost did it for him, though. “Oh for goodness sake, this is useless.”  I snapped out my wings and took off, trying to outfly him.</p><p>        “Oh no you don’t!” he came up behind me and shot me, right in the back.</p><p>        “How ironic…” I barely gasped that out. He had knocked the wind out of me with a single blow.</p><p>        “Whoa, dude, you should be unconscious!”</p><p>        I hit the ground--hard. “Yeah, well,” I gasped again, “I’m not exactly far off. Owwwwww that hurt. I really should have exercised more. Godric would kill me for the shape I’m in now.” I muttered.</p><p>        “I think you might have hit your head a bit hard.”</p><p>        “Nope, I promise I’m good.” All of a sudden, that power rippled over my body, healing me. I forced the energy back and got to my feet.  Another flash, this time white, caught my eye. “White Tiger, I assume?”</p><p>        “Yeah, you got that right. And you’re Marissa?”</p><p>        “If you want me to be.” Looks like SHIELD had done their research. Too bad all their info was fake. I’d had so many names, it was hard to remember them all. I’d played every role imaginable in this dimension, from the quiet bookworm to the rebellious teen. Each one was imprinted into me, lives and lies that had become intertwined within my reality.</p><p>        “Though the mind and body are separate in life, the greatest power can be achieved through their unification.” Looks like Iron Fist finally decided to show himself.</p><p>        “Lovely expression, Danny. However, through their unification, the darkest depths of the mind will also be unveiled.” As I said this, I clapped my hands together and slapped them against the ground, feeling the energy or the earth below me and bending it to my will. A wall sprang to life, separating them from me. “And a very emphatic goodbye to you” I murmured before taking off once more. I was still going to go to school—it was the only place Chiron knew to look for me, and SHIELD wouldn’t be able to make a direct move with all the potential collateral damage—but I’d have to be more careful.</p><p>      I flew in zigzags, backtracking several times to make sure no-one was following me. At some point I discovered a tracker stuck to the back of my hoodie. I smiled and took a short side-trip to some back end alleyway in Queens, leaving it somewhere special for SHIELD to find. Once I was satisfied that there was no way for SHIELD to follow me, I made my way back to my squatting nest in the forest.</p><p>      I landed in front of my tent, taking in my campsite. There was plenty to do if I wanted to pack everything up before sunrise, especially since I had already wasted half the night. Still, I hummed as I worked, sorting everything I owned into piles that I would either keep, donate or throw away.</p><p>      I couldn’t wait for tomorrow so I could finally get back to camp.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
