    <p>Will Graham had enjoyed three peaceful, exquisite years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry before the murders started. A thirteen-year-old boy had been found strangled to death in the Forbidden Forest. Detectives were stumped. After a lengthy, useless investigation, they tentatively concluded that the death was the result of a quarrel between two students. A boy, named simply Hagrid, was blamed for the murder. The lack of evidence was startling. It was almost completely circumstantial, but the ministry’s hands were tied. He was expelled. Meanwhile, Dumbledore was left to assure students that the danger had passed and all was well.</p><p>All was not well. The next murder was several months later, nearing the end of Will’s fourth year. Because it was so close to summer holidays, the authorities allowed them to finish the year to avoid mass panic, but Will knew. Dumbledore was forced to announce the closure of the school at the end of term feast. Will was witness to students openly crying at the tables, students embracing as they left for what they all assumed would be the last time. Though he looked, Will could find no trace of his friend Hannibal Lecter after he’d slipped out of the Great Hall.</p><p>The lead weight that had been slowly sinking into Will’s stomach all year solidified. He went back home, spent the hot, oppressive summer avoiding his father and his unpredictable rages. He worked odd hours, as many as he could pick up at a local McDonalds. He didn’t have many close friends, but he went to parties and crashed on couches and generally just tried not to go home. He told himself that this was his life now, tried not to think about Hogwarts or Hannibal because he wouldn’t see either again. The days began to blur together. As things stood, he had no idea what was going on in the wizarding world, and he tried his hardest to keep it that way.</p><p>Will was shocked in early August when a small, brown owl flew through his open window with a letter. It was from Hogwarts, inviting him back for his fifth year. He didn’t care about the danger. Will jumped at the chance, deciding he’d figure out what was going on when he got there.</p><p>It had been an uneasy revelation, once back at school, to find that the school had more or less been coerced into reopening. The summer had brought a new string of murders. All exclusively wizard children. All under the age of eleven. As soon as the letters had been sent out, the murders had tapered off. Not stopped. Two more people died that year. It wasn’t entirely clear whether they’d been murdered by the Scholarship Slayer, as the Daily Prophet had dubbed him, but they were attributed to him nonetheless.</p><p>When Will’s sixth year began, the Ministry decided to send in a team of Aurors to sort things out. They were members of an elite sqaud, who excelled in both Muggle and magical investigations, led by Detective Jack Crawford. The year would be interesting at the very least, he was sure.</p><p> </p>
