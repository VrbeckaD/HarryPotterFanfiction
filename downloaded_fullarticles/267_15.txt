  <span>"Starving Artist"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It wasn't a term unfamiliar to Remus. After all, he was an artist and he did struggle to make end's meet. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was the same term his father tossed at him when Remus had wanted to go to London College of Art and Design instead of working at the autobody shop with his dad. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>"What's wrong with earning an honest living, Remus? Why can't you just do your hobby in your spare time?"</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That's what really broke Remus' heart. Not believing in his talents, he understood. Remus hardly ever believed in himself anyway. Not wanting Remus to live a life of poverty, that made sense. Nobody wants their only child to struggle to put food on the table. But calling what Remus did a hobby? That was a blow to Remus' heart that he couldn't withstand.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Art had never been a hobby to Remus.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus didn't paint because it relaxed him, he didn't paint because he enjoyed it, he didn't paint because it was fun or entertaining. Remus painted because he </span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> to. He painted because if he didn't, he felt incomplete, empty. Remus needed his art the same way he needed food and air. He thirsted for it, felt it tearing at his insides. Days where Remus didn't approach a canvas and pick up a brush were excruciating, he was left broken and starved. Remus' art was never his hobby, it was his everything.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus knew he'd never be allowed to pursue the life he needed while he lived at home, so he took a job, then another, then another, until he was able to afford the run-down basement flat that he lived in: a single room that was his and his alone. It was filled with canvases and easels, three or four works going simultaneously. Tubes of paint littered the ground, pallets and brushes scattered about amongst half filled jars of dirty water. There was a single bed pushed into the corner, covered entirely with books during the day. There was no kitchen, only a hotplate, a microwave, and a mini refrigerator that served its purpose well enough. Remus knew that this was the life he chose. He knew that this was the cost of following his heart. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>One particularly soggy London day, when the sky threatened to soak Remus' only pair of shoes to their very core, Remus returned to his flat after an excruciating shift at the cafe. He had been on his feet the entire time, serving coffee to wealthier people than him, smiling through his frustration. As Remus slipped off his sneakers, he reached into his pocket and grabbed the handful of change that made up his tips, tossing it into the jar that sat on the table by the door.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The jar was getting fuller by the day, but Remus knew it wasn't enough. It took his entire paycheck to be able to afford his flat and his food, so saving up his tips was all he could do to eventually pay for LCAD. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus dragged himself over to his bed and flopped down beside a pile of art books that wobbled precariously from his movement. With a weary sigh, he kicked off his shoes and forced himself to sit up. Back against the wall, laptop on his thighs, Remus began the arduous task of looking for gallery shows and openings. He had promised himself to go to at least one opening a week, ideally more. The more gallery shows he went to, the more elbows he rubbed, the better the chance that he would meet somebody who could help kick start his career. </span>

<p>
  <em>
    <span>Black and White</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The name sounded familiar.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Grand Opening of Black and White</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The opening was that evening.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Sirius Black, son the illustrious Orion and Walburga Black, is following in his parents' footsteps as a curator of magnificent works of beauty.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>"My aim is to juxtapose the frailty of the human condition with the dichotomy of gender normative notions through an exploration of the boundaries of art, with a particular emphasis on the arbitrary line that exists between painting and sculpture."</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Please join us for an unforgettable evening as Black reveals the first collection to be housed in the gallery: </span>

  </em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>
    <span>Gallery will be open from 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM. Wine and light refreshments will be served. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus sniggered to himself at the ridiculous quote from Sirius Black that was included in the description. There were a lot of words not saying anything if particular importance. Leave it to a gallerist to come up with the longest string of nonsense possible. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>At least there would be food. Remus was grateful for the free refreshments; it meant not having to use what little money he had on dinner.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The artist grabbed his phone and checked the time before letting out a groan and rolling out of bed. He needed to change into presentable clothing before heading to the gallery, which was a half-hour walk from his home. There was no time to rest beforehand, he would have to make do with caffeine and resilience. </span>
