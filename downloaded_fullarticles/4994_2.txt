    <h2 align="center">Metamorphosis</h2><p><br/>
 </p><p align="center">--x&amp;x--</p><p>The sixth shard of Lord Voldemort can honestly—well, as much as one with his dubious integrity <em>is</em> able to, at least—claim, that when he finds himself trapped, a mere... prisoner <em>within</em> his fifteen month-old nemesis, he is <em>most</em> displeased.</p><p>Most displeased, indeed.</p><p>This was not meant to happen.</p><p>Was not planned.</p><p>He ponders the case of this most unexpected and unhappy circumstance. Mulls over the details, the hows and the whys of it. Considers the possibilities that it’s tied in with his... <em>ambitious</em> scheme to escape the inevitable fetters of mortality—</p><p>And decides it’s simply the Potter brat’s fault.</p><p>Of <em>course</em> it is.</p><p>There is no way he made a miscalculation. Can’t have. It’s... impossible; therefore it must be due to the whelp and his mudblood mother.</p><p>This unhappy conclusion changes nothing in the grand scheme of things. He’s still in the exact same position, still imprisoned within the very being he wishes to destroy and yet unable to lift a single finger against it.</p><p>
  <em>What foreign magic is this?</em>
</p><p>And... his new existence is a <em>wretched</em> one.</p><p>Patently <em>more</em> pathetic than his life before the Before, where the wonders of magic brought colour to his listless, monochrome world; lit it with wonders unimaginable and led him into temptation with all the delicacies yet untried by his inexperienced palate...</p><p>The ‘Before Magic’ portion of his life isn’t a period of time he likes to dwell on... <em>often</em>.</p><p>Uses it for reference, mostly. It’s too pa—</p><p>He prefers to separate himself from that... unpleasant time in his life but concludes, with a seething bitterness and repugnance, that his ‘before the Before’ is still better than the realities of his <em>now</em>.</p><p>Now he’s cursed with awareness, with <em>existence</em>... but not—not <em>existing</em>.</p><p>Not <em>truly</em>.</p><p>His awareness is vast yet centralised, <em>shackled</em>, focused primarily upon the inconsequential particulars that pertain to the loathsome creature that houses him. Unable to cease his constantly revolving thoughts; to close his eyes—what eyes?—for reprieve; to shut out the goings on around him.</p><p>He’s an unwanted, unnoticed voyeur; a spectator in the life of another.</p><p>Worse than before, because at least then he had <em>form</em>. A <em>voice</em>.</p><p>Now he simply <em>is</em>.</p><p>And no one but himself can hear his screams.</p><p>Until one day, someone <em>does</em>.</p><p>His time trapped as a parasitic prisoner <em>isn’t</em> fluid.</p><p>At least, not in the way he expects, considering his inability to do anything more than simply <em>watch</em>. It’s sporadic and brittle, much like the attentions his thrice cursed enemy receives from what are, presumably, <em>family</em>.</p><p>The mudblood mother’s, supposedly.</p><p><em>Muggles</em>.</p><p>The situation is so ironic it’s amusing.</p><p>Lord Voldemort doesn’t feel one whit of sympathy for the insufferable Potter spawn; isn’t capable of such... tender sentiment and while he relishes <em>every</em> moment the whelp suffers, he can’t stand that it’s filthy, worthless<em> muggles</em> who are the cause.</p><p>This makes him <em>furious</em>.</p><p>And that’s what <em>it</em> happens.</p><p>The brat is back in his bedroom—a glorified storage cupboard, of all things; complete with products best left away from young, ponderous minds and sticky, curious fingers—arms curled around his stubby knees and utterly blind in the darkness that enfolds his tiny, not yet four-year-old form. The only light visible is that which sneaks in from beyond the cupboard door, a misshapen luminescent outline of golden yellow.</p><p>“Sorry,” the boy murmurs, voice undeveloped and wispy.</p><p>Voldemort ignores this, well used to the brat talking to himself by now and continues his furious diatribe against the world and, of course, the lowliness of muggle filth.</p><p>The boy releases his knees and shuffles across the dusty floor, lifts a hand to his forehead and <em>touches</em> Him.</p><p>Voldemort starts.</p><p>The touch is feather light, as though the boy is trying to... soothe it—<em>Him</em>?—and he stills completely, bewildered by the brat’s gentleness and yet... not.</p><p>It’s basic human nature, isn’t it, the desire to belong? And clearly, the child doesn’t belong here, not in the world filled with those... inferior imposters, who <em>look</em> like them and yet are so far removed that they’re little better than the animals they claim superiority to.</p><p>The better, greater species, indeed.</p><p>“Do you feel better now?”  Is the boy’s next query.</p><p>Voldemort’s confusion recedes, replaced with irritated comprehension at the most basic of psychological needs presented to him.</p><p>Loathe as he is to admit anything remotely positive about his prison, the whelp is, at the very least, magical and several steps up from his muggle... relatives; therefore any sort of acceptance from them is laughable. When did vermin ever accept a snake in their den? It made sense then, that the child, young and vulnerable would seek what it needed <em>else</em>where.</p><p>Even within himself, more specifically, an imaginary friend that happened to reside in his scar.</p><p> </p>
