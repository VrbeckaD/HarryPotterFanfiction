  <em>Our story is about a town; a small town and the people who live in the town. From a distance, it presents itself like so many other small towns all over the world...safe, decent, innocent. Get closer though and you start seeing the shadows underneath...</em>
</p><p align="center">*</p><p>                When her mother got her the internship to work for the<em> New York Ghost</em> in New York City, through her connections as a lead editor and reporter for the <em>Daily Prophet</em>, Betty was expecting an uncomplicated summer.</p><p>                Instead, she returned to London only to learn that Jason Blossom had disappeared and presumed dead, Archie and Jughead were no longer best friends (or talking), and her sister Polly was <em>persona non grata</em> in the Cooper household (as well as missing).</p><p>                It baffled her how many things could change in six weeks. When her fifth year of school at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry ended, Betty promised herself that sixth year would be when she confesses her crush to Archie; it would be the year she would publish something in the <em>Prophet</em> and become known for more than Alice Cooper’s daughter.</p><p>                So, that last week of August, Betty determinedly pushed aside her fears (<em>where are you, Polly?</em>) and her anxiety (<em>what if Archie says “no”?</em>), and invited her friend, Kevin Keller, over to her house in a nice part of Hogsmeade, in order to help her pick out the perfect outfit to catch Archie’s eyes.</p><p>                She could hear him greet her father, who was outside in the front yard working on his enchanted Mustang (“So I can remain close to my Muggleborn roots, Betty,” he would remind her constantly, and then ask, “Hand me the spanner”), and then bound up the stairs. He threw open her bedroom door dramatically and announced, “I am here, Betts!”</p><p>                The spent several hours giggling and gossiping,</p><p>(“did you hear about Tina?”</p><p>“No, what?”</p><p>“She was caught smacking a big one Reggie last weekend at his summer house in Wiltshire” and “I’m one-hundred percent sure Moose likes me, Betts, honest”)</p><p>                the Weird Sisters playing in the background on Betty’s radio.</p><p>                Just as Betty pulled out a floral print summer dress – one bought in New York with this event in mind – Kevin let out an audible gasp.</p><p>                “Oh, my, God!”</p><p>                Startled, Betty turned from the wardrobe to face her friend, who had his upper body nearly out her second-floor bedroom window.</p><p>                “What?”</p><p>                “Game changer - Archie got <em>hot</em>!” Kevin felt his mouth drop open, and Betty rushed forward to look at what he was looking at her best friend, her (not so) secret crush, and next-door neighbour. Betty and Archie had grown up since birth next-door to one another, and spent year of their childhood between each other’s yards and kitchens. Their bedrooms were directly across from one another, and in their younger years, they would steal their parents’ wands and enchant little slips of paper to fly across the short distance between the two houses.</p><p>                Now, though, having not seen her childhood friend for the majority of the summer, Betty wasn’t quite sure what had caught Kevin’s attention until her eyes took in the shirtless redhead, preoccupied with finding a clean t-shirt to wear for dinner with Betty.</p><p>                Kevin was nearly breathless as he continued, “He’s got abs now. Six more reasons for you to take that ginger bull by the horns tonight.”</p><p>                Betty blushed scarlet and slapped Kevin lightly on the shoulder. “Kev!”</p><p>                “What?”</p><p>                She bit her lip but let her eyes linger on her friend a moment longer before drawing her curtains and hiding him from their view.</p><p>                “You are <em>so</em> on Felix Felicis with that boy, Betty,” he sighed.</p><p>                She bit her lip. “I doubt that. Archie’s never done anything to indicate he fancies me.”</p><p>                “Because Archie’s swell,” said Kevin with an eye roll. “But, like most millennial straight guys, he needs to be told what he wants. So, tell him, finally.”</p><p>                Kevin then flopped down on her bed. “And <em>you</em> are going to tell me all the deets, right? Where are you going anyway? Not <em>Puddifoots</em>, I hope.” He shuddered.</p><p>                “No,” said Betty with an eye roll of her own, turning back to her wardrobe and then vanity, critically examining herself in the mirror. “I wanted to catch the Knight Bus and go to Fortesque’s, but Archie wanted something a bit closer so we’re going to the Three Broomsticks.”</p><p>                Kevin caught something in her tone. “What, not private enough for your date?”</p><p>                “Not really,” agreed Betty.</p><p>                “Please,” scoffed the brown-haired lanky teen. “The Three will be teeming with everyone; they’ll all get a good look at the two of you. We all know you’re endgame, anyway.”</p><p>                Betty didn’t reply, leaning forward to apply a coat of gloss she picked up in Muggle London when visiting her father’s parents.</p><p>                <em>And what if he says he doesn’t like me</em>? She wondered. That kind of rejection front of everyone they knew would be horrifying.</p><p>                She felt a bubble burst in her stomach and tiny spots of black appeared before her eyes – her room was too bright – and her breaths were getting shorter and quicker –</p><p>                “Betty?”</p><p>                Betty whirled and plastered a smile on her face for Kevin, who was looking at her with a tiny frown and pinched brow.</p><p>                “I’ll call you on my mirror tonight, Kev, promise,” she said, and Kevin smiled.</p><p>                She slowly unclenched her hands.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>                Archie wasn’t listening. She could tell that right away, and the bubble of anxiety in her stomach was combating with the flutters of nerves; it was like a rollicking storm in her stomach and she kept talking, hoping that eventually she would say something that would catch his interest.</p><p>                “... the book launch for Gilderoy Lockhart was absolutely amazing,” she gushed, eyes bright and wide, hands deliberately flat on the worn, smooth wooden table of their booth at the Three Broomstick’s. “I mean, he’s a total fraud, but that new book he wrote about his journey of self-discovery, wow! That marketing team really knew what they were doing since his stay at Mungo’s.”</p><p>                “Uh huh,” replied Archie, his eyes drawn over her shoulder to the door and open pane that opened to the main street of Hogsmeade. A tinkle of the bells above the door chimed as a new customer walked in.</p><p>                Disheartened, Betty continued on, her voice pitched slightly higher. “He should totally be in the Az, of course – <em>Obliviate</em> isn’t something you should throw around like a Cheering Charm, is it? But I suppose losing his own memory to a faulty spell is really awful enough to live with...”</p><p>                Archie’s eyes were caught on something just beyond her, behind, and Betty trailed off. She turned slightly in the booth seat, looking over her shoulder.</p><p>                Her heart dropped.</p><p>                Archie was known to like pretty, glossy things, whether they were young witches or snitches. As long as they shone bright enough, his eye would be on them, and this one that just walked in was the shiniest she had seen in some time.</p><p>                Her hair was shoulder-length, straight and black; her eyes dark and her lips painted a dark red. Her outfit was pure Muggle: a LBD with thin, killer heel booties but wrapped around her shoulders was a fluffy, feathery cape that Betty had seen once in an ad at Madam Malkin’s.</p><p>                She was walking like she own the Three Broomsticks – confident and poised – and the noise of the Friday night patrons seemed to disappear in the seconds it took her to lock her eyes on the two of them.</p><p>                Archie abandoned his butterbeer to turn his attention to the new girl, who stopped at their table and spoke, loudly at them both, “I’ve just moved here so I’m unfamiliar with what’s good, but the Three Broomstick’s is said to have the best. What do you suggest?”</p><p>                “Hi!” greeted Archie with a wide smile. Betty’s heart stopped. “Everything’s good here. Madam Rosmerta makes the best <em>everything</em>. But I’d recommend the dragon burgers, and a side of rings.”</p><p>                “Then that’s what I’ll order,” nodded the girl, turning slightly to flag Rosmerta, calling her order: “Two dragon burgers and a side of rings, please!”</p><p>                After the pretty barmaid nodded, indicating she heard, the girl turned back to them, eyes darting between the two. “I hope I’m not interrupting.”</p><p>                “Actually, you are—” began Betty the same time Archie loudly said, “Not at all! Why don’t you join us?”</p><p>                Betty ducked her head and felt flames spread across her cheeks.</p><p>                “It’s okay,” the girl said, correctly reading the situation, as her eyes lingered on Betty a bit longer. “I’m just here for dinner as I settle in.” She looked around the dark and cozy pub, and then turned back at the two.</p><p>                “Where did you live before?” asked Archie. Betty was content at him leading the conversation she wanted nothing part of.</p><p>                “Daddy had business everywhere, but we were last in Berlin,” answered the girl. “Before that, Paris; and before that, New York for several years. There was a brief moment in Singapore, too.”</p><p>                “Wow! So you’ve been at Durmstrang, Beauxbatons, Ilvermorny, and a whole lot of other schools, too, then.” Archie looked impressed and slightly star struck.</p><p>                The girl sighed. “Yes, but I’m filled with dread.”</p><p>                Archie frowned. “Why’s that?”</p><p>                “Are you familiar with the works of Truman Capote?” she asked.</p><p>                Archie shook his head but Betty determinedly said nothing.</p><p>                “He’s a Muggle author; and I’m <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em> but this place is strictly <em>In Cold Blood</em>,” said ended her sentence with dramatic flair, and an airy wave of her hand.</p><p>                Archie snorted a laugh and Betty stared.</p><p>                With the ice broken, the girl held out a hand at Archie. “I’m Veronica. I’m starting at Hogwarts next week.”</p><p>                “Archie,” he said, shaking her hand. “And this is Betty. What year are you going in?”</p><p>                “Sixth,” answered Veronica, smiling. “You?”</p><p>                “Same,” said Archie. “And now you’ll know at least two people!”</p><p>                “I’m glad for that, it’s no fun being the new girl,” agreed Veronica. “I’m supposed to meet with a sixth year prefect on the train. They’ll introduce me to Hogwarts and help me around... someone Cooper?”</p><p>                “That’s Betty,” cheerfully supplied Archie, turning to his quiet childhood friend.</p><p>                Betty forced a smile on her face and drew her arms close to her body in response, trying to make herself as small as possible. “Hi.”</p><p>                “Perfect,” said Veronica, with a sharp-toothed smile. “I can see that we’re already going to be the best of friends.”</p><p>                “Order up!” called Rosmerta, and Veronica turned towards her voice.</p><p>                “I’ll see you in a few days, then,” said Veronica with a tiny wave of goodbye. The two in the booth watched her collect her food at the bar, and then leave, turning and walking down the main street until she was beyond their gaze.</p><p>                “Isn’t she great?” asked Archie, turning back to Betty.</p><p>                Betty smiled weakly, her dreams of asking Archie out for the first Hogsmeade weekend at Hogwarts dying a quiet death in her mouth. “Yeah. Great.”</p><p>                It was going to be a long year.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>                Betty never understood why residents of Hogsmeade had to travel to London just to catch the Hogwarts Express back up to Hogsmeade in Scotland. It was stupid and quite a waste of time. It did give her time with Archie – and previously, Jughead – but this year, she knew she was going to find a compartment with Kevin and rant about her disastrous date. Although he heard most of it via enchanted linked mirror (something she had made for an extra-credit Charms assignment that Flitwick had overseen), she felt the need to ask for more clarity.</p><p>                Early the morning of September 1<sup>st</sup>, Betty began readying her usual armour: she already wore her Hufflepuff uniform (“Why did it have to be Hufflepuff?” her mother had exclaimed in her visit home her first Yule after being Sorted, “Why not Slytherin like me? Are you really that much like your father?”), and with practised hands, she smoothed the pleated skirt and straightened her yellow and black tie.</p><p>                She applied a light sheen of gloss on her lips, and then tied her hair back with a bobble, her ponytail high and her hair firmly pulled back. She ran a critical eye over herself in the mirror.</p><p>                “Are you ready?”</p><p>                Her mother’s sharp voice surprised her, and she turned, leaning on her vanity. “Mom!”</p><p>                “Betty,” her mother, Alice Cooper, coolly assessed her daughter. As blonde as Betty with green eyes, those were their only similarities. Alice Cooper was cool, assessing and the quintessential Slytherin, her old house. Nothing was out of place with her carefully styled hair, or her applied makeup glamours; her robes were of high quality from Tattling and Taffit’s, cut to accentuate her figure in a soft rose pastel.  </p><p>                “NEWTs are coming up, dear. Are you ready for earning straight Os? I won’t accept anything less,” Alice Cooper continued, while Betty bit her tongue. “And you need at least two extra-curriculars for your post-NEWT applications. I’d like to see you attending the Institute of Magic and Spells for your Mastery in Transfiguration. I don’t want another owl from McGonagall, telling me that you’re only at EEs. You need to work harder in it, Elizabeth.”</p><p>                “I don’t even like Transfiguration,” mumbled Betty, eyes downcast.</p><p>                Her mother hummed, and then reached into Betty’s bedside drawer. “How’s your anxiety? Are you taking your medicine?” She pulled out a nearly empty glass bottle of lingering blue liquid. “You’re almost out of calming draught. I’ll stop by the apothecary and ask for a refill for you. And I’ll owl Promfrey later to make sure you have extra when you’re at Hogwarts.”</p><p>                “Mom,” pled Betty quietly.</p><p>                “No one likes a loser, Elizabeth.”</p><p>                Betty pursed her lips and curled her fingers into her fists, staring at her mother. Finally, she said, quietly, “I’m going to miss the Express if you don’t Apparate me. Otherwise, I’ll take the Floo.”</p><p>                “It’s best you Floo, dear,” said Alice, “Your father and I are going straight to the <em>Prophet</em>. Take care and have a good year, Elizabeth. Make good choices.”</p><p>                With that said, her mother turned on her heels, leaving Betty alone in her room.</p><p>                “I <em>always</em> make good choices,” muttered Betty in the silence of her room.</p><p>                “Well, that sounds horribly boring,” piped up her mirror.</p><p>                Betty cut a glance at it and scowled. “No one asked <em>you</em>,” and then, knowing she lived in a magical area, tapped the frame with her wand and mutter, “<em>Silencio</em>.”</p><p>                It was petty, but she felt better about it.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>                The train was full, as usual, and as soon as she was done with the prefect’s meeting (along with her fellow male Hufflepuff prefect, Trev Brown), Betty knew she had to seek out Veronica and begin the orientation that Weatherbee had owled her about earlier that summer.</p><p>                She found Veronica with Kevin – strangely enough – alone in a compartment, laughing and joking as if they had been friends for years.</p><p>                “Veronica, hello,” Betty greeted her as she slid open the compartment door.</p><p>                “Betty!” the girl trilled, standing and reaching forward with a greeting hug. “Kev here was just telling me about Hogwarts. Isn’t it fabulous I find the only gay man in all of Hogwarts in the first compartment I looked into?”</p><p>                Kevin beamed at Betty from over Veronica’s shoulder, and mouthed, “<em>She’s amazing</em>!”</p><p>                Betty forced a tight smile on her lips. “Do you want me to explain about the House system? I know Durmstrang and Beauxbatons don’t have them.”</p><p>                “Illvermory did, but different to here,” added Veronica, nodding. “What house are you both in, then?”</p><p>                “Betty’s Hufflepuff,” declared Kevin loudly, settling back down on his side of the compartment seat, stretching lankily out. Betty gingerly sat next to Veronica on the seat across from him, but closer to the window. “She’s our year’s darling – sweet and loyal and practically perfect in every way. Our very own Mary Poppins.”</p><p>                Beyond their compartment door, a large group of teenage boys loudly shoved by; one redhead in particular managed to stop and wave hello before continuing; both Kevin and Betty had reciprocated. Veronica sighed.</p><p>                “Oh! There’s the hottie we were with last night. Is that ginger Popsicle your boyfriend? What house is he in?” asked Veronica, looking for gossip and attempting to ease her way into Betty’s friendship with the opportunity for talking about boys.</p><p>                “He’s straight,” Kevin confessed, while Betty fingered the ends of her ponytail demurely and said, quietly, “Oh, no, we’re just friends,” at the same time.</p><p>                “But you were on a date,” argued Veronica, looking back and forth between Kevin and Betty, who was looking out the window determinedly and ignoring everything but the passing English countryside of the midlands. “Or... in that case, mind putting in a word? I’ve tried every flavor of boy but orange.”</p><p>                “Actually, to clarify: Archie and Betty are <em>endgame</em>,” whispered Kevin, not at all attempting to keep his voice down. Veronica turned to him. “They’re childhood best friends, the girl next door with the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team and all-around star Chaser. They’re the perfect story – the Hogsmeade story!”</p><p>                “I’m hardly perfect, Kev,” mumbled Betty.</p><p>                “Hufflepuff, Gryffindor,” murmured Veronica. “Got it.” She eyed the blonde. “So what happened that night? I totally thought you were an item.”</p><p>                “I’ve never...” Betty trailed off. She cleared her throat and then said, “Kev here is a Gryffindor with Archie, and one of his dormmates. As you can see, Gryffindors are loud and bold, and if you like listening to the Slytherins, they’re the stereotypical dumb jocks. Quidheads.”</p><p>                Veronica laughed. “And what do people say about the Slytherins then?”</p><p>                “Mean, petty, cruel,” sighed Kevin. “They’re mostly cunning and ambitious, and most politicians come from that house.”</p><p>                Betty nodded, adding, “Contrary to popular, recent events, they’re not all evil wanna-be Death Eaters.”</p><p>                “But,” piped up Kevin, “they’re still mostly purebloods and although there aren’t Death Eaters anymore, we do have the Serpents.”</p><p>                “The Serpents?” asked Veronica, breathlessly and eagerly soaking up the knowledge of Hogwarts.</p><p>                Betty looked away and Kevin nodded. “Yeah, the Serpents. My dad is Head Auror and they are this local gang – you find them mostly in Knockturn, of course – who run a lot of drugs and illegal potions. But sometimes they hang out in Hogsmeade when it’s our Hogmseade days because some students go to them for stuff. They’re like... Death Eater-lite. No Muggle baiting, no derogatory slurs to Muggleborns, but definitely rabble-rousers.”</p><p>                “Exciting,” deadpanned Veronica.</p><p>                Kevin leaned forward again, caught up in the moment of illicit gossip. “Is it true what they say about your dad?”</p><p>                 Veronica stiffened, her body tensing as she replied stoically, “That he’s the devil incarnate? I stand by my father. Does everyone here know?”</p><p>                Betty and Kevin shared a look, and an awkward silence descended upon the compartment. Veronica scowled and crossed her arms.</p><p>                “Ten minutes in and I’m already the Andromeda Tonks of Hogwarts,” she sighed.</p><p>                “It’ll be okay,” said Betty quietly. “You’re just new and gossip worthy. Within twenty minutes of being back at Hogwarts, someone will do something stupid”—</p><p>                “—likely Reggie or Moose, potentially Archie,” interrupted Kevin quickly.</p><p>                “—and your father will be forgotten,” concluded Betty with a tight, but genuine smile.</p><p>                Veronica sighed. “Merlin, I hope so.”</p><p align="center">*</p><p>                Upon exiting the train at Hogsmeade station, Veronica was hailed by a nervous-looking Professor Grundy, the Muggle Studies professor who had taken over after the previous professor had left (citing that there was too much of Charity Burbage left in the room and giving off bad juju), in order to attend her Sorting ahead of the new first years.</p><p>                Betty and Kevin waved goodbye to her, and bumped into Archie, whom Betty noticed was staring after the new girl again. With a sigh, she brightly enquired about his train journey, learning he had sat with Reggie, Moose and Chuck – all other Quidheads and Quidditch players for their house teams – but was going to join them in the carriages to the castle.</p><p>                Betty frowned, and let her eyes scan the busy platform. <em>Where’s Jug?</em> She wondered, eyes darting back and forth and not finding their friend.</p><p>                Instead, Kevin swept her towards the carriages, and then before she knew it, they were in the Great Hall: Betty at her usual seat at the Hufflepuff table between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, back-to-back with Archie and Kevin at their spots at Gryffindor. She faced the Ravenclaw table, and spotted Ethel, who waved; her eyes stumbled beyond and finally – <em>finally! </em>– spotted Jughead slouched at the end of the Slytherin table, furthest from the Head Table and closest to the main doors for a quick getaway. His dark head was bowed, looking at something in his lap, and he was ignoring his housemates (although that was usual). Betty felt her heart squeeze at the idea that he didn’t even want to say hello to her after not speaking all summer.</p><p>                Her attention waned the second a dozen small, quivering bodies appeared from the side door, ready to be Sorted. Veronica towered over them all, standing just slightly to the side confidently with her hands clasped in front of her.</p><p>                “Can I have your attention please?” called McGonagall, her reedy voice strongly amplified by a <em>Sonorous</em> and immediately quietening the entire Hall. “Before we commence the Sorting, I am pleased to welcome Miss Veronica Lodge to Hogwarts, joining the sixth years. She has been Sorted and will be joining Hufflepuff.”</p><p>                The Hufflepuff table erupted into cheers, and Betty slid over so that Veronica could join her as soon as the girl dashed down the rows.</p><p>                “Congratulations,” greeted Betty.</p><p>                “Thanks,” the raven-haired girl whispered back, her non-descript black tie slowly changing to add in the Hufflepuff yellow stripes, and then her Hogwarts crest on her blazer changed to the grey badger surrounded by yellow ribbon.</p><p>                After the Sorting, and a delicious Welcome Back Feast dinner, Betty and Trev hustled the new first-year ‘Puffs to their sett, providing them with the password (“you tap the barrels in this order, you’d best remember it or get drenched with vinegar”) before separating and making their way to their respective dormitories.</p><p>                Veronica was already there, standing in the middle of the rectangular room and eyeing the several round windows that spanned along the entire far wall. Moonlight spilled in.</p><p>                “We’re literally a sett,” explained Betty, catching the other girl’s attention. “We’re just slightly under level with the first floor, so we see a lot of the grounds from our windows but most people ignore Hufflepuff and fail to realize that we’re even here.”</p><p>                Veronica <em>hmm</em>ed. “Don’t you have other dormmates?”</p><p>                Betty shook her head. “The years around ours are incredibly small; no baby boom for our generation! I was the only female Hufflepuff for my entire year until you joined. Gryffindor has several sixth years: Valerie Brown, Midge Klump, and Nancy Woods. Ravenclaw has a bunch, too: Ethel Muggs, Melody Valentine, Cricket O’Dell, and Brigitte Reilley. Slytherin has Josie McCoy, Ginger Lopez, and Tina Patel, although she’s a year younger than us – she just moved up a year because she’s smart but not curious about learning for learning’s sake – Ravenclaw was out. You’ll want to avoid Ginger and Tina if you can, but they don’t pay much attention to their year mates. They hang out with Cheryl Blossom, the reigning queen of Slytherin. She’s a seventh year now.”</p><p>                Veronica stared. “Are you telling me, that in an entire year group, you’re the only one considered ‘loyal’ and ‘friendly’ and ‘hardworking’?”</p><p>                “If you want to play with stereotypes that Hufflepuffs are duffers, sure,” shrugged Betty. “I guess that is how I got my reputation, especially being the only girl.”</p><p>                Betty moved towards her warm, honey-brushed wooden queen bed. “The benefits of having the room to myself was a large bed,” she grinned at Veronica, motioning to the equally large wooden bed opposite of hers, mirroring Betty’s side of the room.</p><p>                The bed wasn’t a four-poster like in Gryffindor or Slytherin; it was a large, heavy wooden bed with slats, covered with a bounty of pillows in varying shades of yellow, interspersed with black throw pillows. Each bed had a unique patchwork quilt folded at the foot of each bed, on top of warm, puffy pale yellow duvets.</p><p>                There were bedside tables on either side, and two desks pushed up underneath the windows with short, three-shelved bookshelves next to them. Betty’s was already half-full with books, evenly spaced and sorted by subject and year.</p><p>                The floor under both their beds was covered with a thick grey carpet, and Betty itched to curl her toes in the warm shag. The rest of the floor was polished and shining wood.</p><p>                To ensure privacy, the girls did have two matching wooden dividers tucked into corners of the bedroom, nearer to the front, circular door that they entered with a matching set of low drawers for their clothing. On Veronica’s side of the room, another circular door (“Hobbit holes,” laughed Veronica when she poker her head in) led to the girls’ private fifth-year bathroom. It was another warm room with wood floor and a large porcelain tub and glass shower, two antique pedestal sinks, and two large circular mirrors hanging over the sinks.</p><p>                Veronica sighed, falling onto her bed and saying happily, “I think I’ll really like it here.”</p><p>                Betty smiled. “It’s going to be really nice having you as a roommate, Veronica.”</p><p align="center">*</p><p>                School began on a Friday, September 2<sup>nd</sup>.</p><p>                Their cohort was small, one of the smallest since the days of Harry Potter, with the girls adding up to twelve, just like the boys; due to that, many of the electives held small classes of just six or less and as such, the entire year all knew one another and often hung out. Rivalries still happened though, so to combat against the long-standing traditional grudges between Gryffindor and Slytherin, classes were split Gryffindor/Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw/Slytherin, except for electives.</p><p>                Veronica and Betty shared Arithmacy, but Betty was without her new friend for her NEWT-level Ancient Runes. Otherwise, they had all their core NEWT classes (Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, and Defense) together with Archie and Kevin.</p><p>                Instead, Betty caught back up with Veronica before lunch, and the two decided to grab a meal from the kitchens near their common room and eat outside by the lake. Archie and Kevin, who had NEWT-Divination with Veronica before lunch that Friday, joined them. The weather was still balmy and clear, the final, last gasps of Scottish summer.</p><p>                “How’s your first day going?” Archie asked Veronica, once everyone had nearly finished their lunch.</p><p>                “Not to be a complete narcissist, but I thought people would be more...” Veronica trailed off.</p><p>                “Obsessed with you?” Kevin interjected. “Any other year, you’d be trending number one, for sure. This year, though, it’s all about Cheryl trying to win the Best Supporting Psycho Oscar for her role as Hogwarts bereaved Red Widow.”</p><p>                “But I thought her brother is missing?” asked Veronica.</p><p>                “Officially missing,” added Kevin. “But declared dead by the Blossoms.”</p><p>                Archie had a small recording stone, a Weasley Wizard Wheezes product, where you could record up to ten-minutes of sound for playback. He was fiddling with it, and Veronica jumped in, in order to change the tone of the conversation. “What is <em>that</em>, Archiekins?”</p><p>                Archie blushed, a light rose colour that didn’t settle on his cheeks too well with his bright red hair. “Just a song that I was working on this summer.”</p><p>                “Well, play it,” demanded Veronica.</p><p>                Betty and Kevin nodded encouragingly, and so Archie drew his wand and tapped on the stone, activating it. A swell of guitar chords built and then Archie’s gravelly voice sang about love, love lost, and love found.</p><p>                “Very nice,” admired Veronica when it was done.</p><p>                “It’s great, Archie,” said Betty with warmth.</p><p>                “Thanks,” he replied bashfully, ducking his head and slipping the stone back into his pocket. “I’ve been working on it all summer, and my dad and I are disagreeing on focusing on that or Quidditch.”</p><p>                While Kevin and Betty made sympathetic noises, Veronica asked, “What <em>is</em> the fascination of Quidditch? It’s all over Europe like venereal disease. Now, in America, <em>Quodpot</em>—”</p><p>                “Quodpot!?” exclaimed Kevin and Archie, causing Betty and Veronica to laugh.</p><p>                “Well, hello plebs,” broke in a sugary-sweet voice laced with arsenic, “Veronica Lodge. I’d heard whisperings. I’m Cheryl Blossom. May I sit?”</p><p>                The foursome looked up from their picnic at the lake to spot another redhead looming over them. Her long red hair caught the afternoon sun, turning it nearly blood red; she artfully pulled of the green/red combo of Christmas with her Slytherin tie and green skirt.</p><p>She was holding out a hand for Veronica to shake. Veronica did so reluctantly. She then demurely sat; her knees pressed together and off to the side, her skirt spread across her thighs. “I’m a seventh year, and captain of the cheerleading team here at Hogwarts. You absolutely must join.”</p><p>                “We have a cheer squad?” asked Veronica skeptically. “And only one, not per House?”</p><p>                Cheryl nodded. “One of the many changes made to Hogwarts when we entered the twenty-first century: cheerleading teams, year-related common rooms elsewhere in the castle and not just house common rooms, more electives, more clubs and hobbies, and better still: more dances and parties and for upper years, more opportunity to go into town on weekends.”</p><p>                “A lot of previous alumni felt Hogwarts didn’t offer enough for students,” added Betty quietly.</p><p>                Cheryl turned to Betty and with her sweet saccharine voice, piped, “Right you are, Bettikins! But what I came here to say offer you a spot on the Hogwarts Dragons.” She finished by looking directly at Veronica. “Someone with your calibre and class doesn’t need to sit with these losers when you can join my friends and I.”</p><p>                Kevin looked Cheryl up and down with a raised eyebrow. “Is cheerleading still a thing?”</p><p>                She eyed him derisively and spat back, equally fast, “Is being the gay best friend still a thing?”</p><p>                Kevin humphed and folded his arms, looking over the lake in reply.</p><p>                Veronica eyed the new interloper, before smiling brightly. “At Beauxbatons, I sat at the top of the Elite’s pyramid. I’m in. Betty, you’re trying out, too.”</p><p>                “What?” both Betty and Cheryl exclaimed at the same time. Cheryl scowled and then hesitantly added, once Veronica turned a dark gaze on her, “Of course Bettikins is welcomed to try out.”</p><p>                Her eyes dipped to the sandwich and side selection the elves had provided for her and Veronica in the small baskets. “But you already have so much on your... plate. And that hasn’t changed since last year – in fact, it might have grown!”</p><p>                Betty blushed and put down the apple she was going to take a bite out of slowly. Veronica scowled.</p><p>                Cheryl turned back to Veronica and said brightly, “Saturday, after lunch on the Quidditch pitch. Until then, Ronnie! Kisses.”</p><p>                 “Ugh,” complained Kevin, eyeing the redhead as she strode away, back towards the castle.</p><p>                “Double ugh,” agreed Veronica. “Is she always like that? Thank Merlin you’ll be with me, Betty. I don’t think I could handle being a Hogwarts Dragon with the bitchiest dragon of them all, 24/7.”</p><p>                “I doubt I’ll get on the team,” muttered Betty. “I tried out last year and wasn’t very good.”</p><p>                 “Nonsense!” chirped Veronica. “You are sunshine on a stick and sexy as anything, Betty Cooper, and make Cheryl look like a krup in comparison. I’ve never known someone as hardworking and intelligent. You’re going to be the one helping <em>me</em> learn the routine.”</p><p>                Betty smiled tentatively back at Veronica, who wrapped an arm around her waist and pulled her new friend towards her.</p><p>                “You’ll see,” the raven-haired girl continued. “You and me? We’re going to be like a permanent sticking charm. Glued together, forever.”</p><p align="center">*</p><p>                It didn’t quite work out.</p><p>                Veronica was sexy and confident and pulled off all the twirls and hip rolls and swaggers required for their routine, but Betty, although doing the same, was definitely more nervous and tightly strung. Her mother would <em>Avada</em> her if she knew what Betty was doing, and it showed in Betty’s performance.</p><p>                Cheryl knew it, too, as did Tina and Ginger on either side of her on the pitch, self-writing floating quills above their clipboards.</p><p>                With a few mocking claps, Cheryl began. “Blah, blah, blah. Dull and uninspired. Ronniekins’ got the moves but Betty dear, you’re just too sugar quill for a Dragon. I need firewhiskey, I need fiendfyre and you, little <em>lumos</em>, don’t have it.”</p><p>                Betty swallowed heavily the lump in her throat.</p><p>                “You want fire, Cheryl?” demanded Veronica, who turned to Betty, whispered, “trust me,” and then reached forward and pulled the slightly taller blonde towards her and pressed her lips against hers.</p><p>                “Oh, Morgana’s tits!” burst out Cheryl. “Fake lesbian kisses, Veronica? Really? That was so lame and ten years ago. That’s <em>not</em> fire.”</p><p>                “Fire?” laughed Veronica darkly. “You don’t want <em>fire</em>, Cheryl – you’re dealing with a Lodge. We are <em>ice</em>. Don’t start something with me just because you think I’m the new rich girl who can be another Dementor, you soul-sucking bitch. You want to fight? Cool, you’ll get it. But don’t think for one second I’ll back down. I’ve dealt with Dark Art-wielding girls in Durmstrang and hoighty-toighty in Beauxbatons; I think I can handle a little <em>fire</em> in Cheryl Blossom at Hogwarts.”</p><p>                Cheryl crossed her arms, narrowing her eyes. “Well then.”</p><p>                She snapped her fingers and the hovering, self-writing quills stood straight and quivered in readiness.</p><p>                “Interview time,” she simpered, and turned her eyes on Betty. “Tell me, Bettikins, how is dear Polly doing?”</p><p>                “I- uh,” stuttered Betty, before taking a deep breath and answering, “Fine, thank you.”</p><p>                “Really? Haven’t seen her back here for her seventh year,” continued Cheryl viciously. “Does she not have anything to say about my dear brother’s disappearance? Does she not talk about Jason at all?”</p><p>                Betty’s fingers curled into her fists. “I don’t know. We don’t talk about your brother.”</p><p>                “Really?” mocked Cheryl, bringing a red-tipped nail to her chest. “At all? Even though they were dating all sixth year? Nothing else to say, then Bettikins? Perfect Polly and Perfect Betty, always so polite and kind. How sickening. Aren’t you glad about Jason’s disappearance? I bet you are, and Polly even more so. She’s a bitch, leading my dear brother on with her wiles.”</p><p>                She waited a beat, letting her goads settle onto Betty’s shoulders and mind. The anxiety built inside Betty, and now it was a roaring wind, deafening her to Cheryl’s accusations and words. She was close to seeing red, but – she was a prefect. She couldn’t fight back, she had to set an example for the other students. And Betty knew that Cheryl was wrong about Polly, too.</p><p>                “Nothing to say back, Betty? I’m waiting. I want to see your fire. Cry, shout, deny! Anything.”</p><p>                Betty saw Veronica looking at her, concernedly, but swallowed heavily, ducked her chin and said, “No. I’ll pass on your concerns to Polly, Cheryl. She’d like that.”</p><p>                Silence fell on the pitch.</p><p>                “How disappointing,” murmured Cheryl, eventually, eyeing the blonde. She turned her head to Veronica and snapped her fingers at her. “Ronnie, welcome to the Dragons. Betty – better luck next year. Maybe the new captain will take pity on you.”</p><p>                “Krupshit!” snapped Veronica. “If Betty’s not on the team, neither am I. And we both know you want me, Cheryl.”</p><p>                An uncomfortable silence settled on the five girls, and Cheryl pursed her lips as she turned to confer with Ginger and Tina, both girls giving Veronica stink-eye. Ginger tossed up a <em>Muffilato</em>, and neither Betty or Veronica could hear what was being discussed.</p><p>                The spell dropped and Cheryl turned with a pinched look on her face. “Fine. Betty’s a Dragon. Grab a uniform from the lockers. Practice is every morning from six to seven, with the exception of Saturdays and Sundays, where we practice from eight to nine on the pitch. Practice begins Monday morning. <em>Don’t</em> be late.”</p><p>                Cheryl, Tina, and Ginger turned and left the pitch, leaving Veronica and Betty to hug and squeal with happiness. That joy held strong, even after putting on their new uniforms and heading back to the castle.</p><p>                “You didn’t have to do that,” whispered Betty to Veronica, as they left the locker room and moved around the outside of the pitch.</p><p>                “Yes I did, B,” replied the other girl steadily. “You’re my best friend. Where you go, I go, remember?”</p><p>                “But... back in Berlin, and Paris, and New York...?”</p><p>                Veronica sighed. “I was once like Cheryl. And looking back, I hated who I was. And then, when Daddy was sent to jail... well. We received all these Howlers and hate mail and bobby-trapped bits that were... <em>horrible</em>. That Daddy was a thief, and mom a clueless socialite. The worst part? It was all true. I didn’t want to be that person anymore. Coming here, to London, to Hogwarts? It’s a fresh start, a chance to become someone better.”</p><p>                Betty nodded thoughtfully. “That’s a lot of pressure.”</p><p>                Veronica turned to her and asked, carefully, “What was that about Polly and Jason?”</p><p>                Betty sighed. “My sister and her brother. They dated all last year. It meant... <em>everything</em> to Polly. She kept saying Jason was her soul mate, her James Potter. It didn’t mean a damn thing to Jason, though. That relationship with toxic; they were constantly yelling and breaking up and making up, and my parents <em>hated</em> Jason. One day, my mom snapped and had enough to tell her she was forbidden from seeing him again.”</p><p>                She turned and looked at the pitch, where they could see several of their years’ Quidditch players on their brooms, holding an impromptu, uneven Quidditch match. The red of Archie’s Gryffindor jersey matched the red of his hair, and he stood out like a beacon.</p><p>                “Jason might have broken Polly’s heart, but my mother broke Polly in all the ways Jason never could,” finished Betty solemnly.</p><p>                Veronica sighed, winding her arm through Betty’s and clutching it. “That’s tragic, B... but that was also <em>Polly</em> and not you.” Her eyes darted up to see Betty’s object of fancy. “Why haven’t you asked him out, yet?”</p><p>                “I’m afraid of rejection,” said Betty quietly, eyes still on her childhood friend, who had noticed the two girls and was lazily drifting down towards them. “I’m afraid that I’ve loved him for so long I’m in love with the <em>idea</em> of Archie and me as a couple. What if reality doesn’t match, V?”</p><p>                “You won’t know until you ask him to the Back to School semi-formal next weekend,” grinned Veronica.                             </p><p>                Betty groaned, hearing Veronica chant, “Do it, do it, do it,” under her breath as Archie came to a hovered stop in front of both girls. He hopped off his Nimbus 2020, and grinned at both Betty and Veronica, his red hair tousled and windswept.</p><p>                “Hello, my lovely ‘Puffs,” he said brightly, eyeing their matching black and grey Hogwarts cheer uniforms. “Or should that be, hello my two lovely new Dragons?”</p><p>               “Careful, Archiekins,” grinned Veronica, “<em>Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus</em>.”</p><p>                He laughed. “Too right!”</p><p>                “Anyway, Betty has something she wants to ask,” artfully said Veronica, dragging Archie’s attention from the vibrant raven-haired beauty to his peppy blonde childhood friend.</p><p>                “Archie,” began Betty slowly, licking her lips. “Would you... would... would you—” she took a deep, heavy breath and rushed out, “V and I don’t have dates to the Back to School semi next week. Would you take us both?”</p><p>                “Of course!” agreed Archie immediately. “I’ll be taking the two prettiest girls at Hogwarts; one on each arm.”</p><p>                “Great!” chirped Betty, with a wide smile and bright eyes; she could feel the heavy stare from Veronica at her side. “Well, see you later at dinner.”</p><p>                “Bye!” he shouted, and slung his leg back over his Nimbus and shot straight up into the sky, where he joined the Quidditch game by grabbing a soaring ball, speeding off towards the Keeper’s goalposts.</p><p>                Veronica sighed. “Really, B?”</p><p>                “At least he said ‘yes,’ Veronica,” said Betty lightly. “Don’t take that from me. It’s a good first step.”</p><p>                Veronica rolled her eyes. “This is me formally placing a complaint for being the inevitable third wheel.”</p><p>                “It won’t come to that, I promise,” said Betty, earnestly.</p><p>                “We’ll see,” is all Veronica said.</p><p>                Betty hoped otherwise, after all, Archie had finally said “yes” to her, for a date – even if there was one extra joining the group. It was a ray of sunshine worth smiling for, in the summer-long night.</p><p align="center">**</p><p align="center">TBC...</p><p align="center">**</p><p align="center"> </p>
