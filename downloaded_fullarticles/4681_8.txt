    <p>Hearing footsteps thunder past the end of the corridor, Greg Lestrade buried his head further into the shelter of his arms and fervently hoped that they wouldn’t find him. He was curled in the shadows at the end of what was charitably called a corridor, but was really too short to actually be one, so if just one person turned their head, they’d easily spot him.</p>
<p>Miraculously, though, none of them did, and soon the sounds of their hoots and calls faded into silence as they vanished further into the castle. Greg breathed out a rather wet sigh of relief, and allowed himself to slump back against the wall.</p>
<p>He’d been so excited when a rather strict-looking woman had turned up at his house on his eleventh birthday and claimed that he could do magic. Incredulous, but excited.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the very first people he’d met on the train on the first day of school had made it <em>very</em> clear that they were not as excited to meet <em>him</em>, and it appeared that they were from some very influential families.</p>
<p>He’d only been at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for three weeks, but Greg already wanted to go back home.</p>
<p>“Is there a reason that you’re disturbing my tranquillity?” asked a voice from behind him.</p>
<p>Still half on edge after running from his tormentors, Greg gave a yelp of fright, and scrambled away from the wall, spinning as he did so. Rather than somebody standing in the entrance to one of the secret passages that riddled Hogwarts – and that Greg could never seem to find nor enter – instead, the only thing that met his wide-eyed gaze was the blank stone wall, adorned by a painting about three-quarters of the way up.</p>
<p>“Wh-who’s there?” he attempted to demand, but the hitch in his voice betrayed him.</p>
<p>“My name is Mycroft Holmes,” the voice answered him. “And you are?”</p>
<p>Greg glanced around the alcove but still couldn’t see a place where someone could be hiding from him. “Um, Greg Lestrade,” he said, finally. “Where are you?”</p>
<p>“Here. Right in front of you,” the voice said. “Are you perhaps in need of eyeglasses?”</p>
<p>Looking straight ahead, the only thing visible was the painting.</p>
<p>Which had moved!</p>
<p>Greg yelped again, and flinched back, banging his head against the opposite wall.</p>
<p>The painting – an older boy dressed in black robes edged with the green of Slytherin – actually <em>rolled its eyes</em> at him. “Haven’t you ever seen a wizard painting before?” it asked.</p>
<p>Greg frowned at the picture, even as he reached up to rub the back of his head. “No,” he said. “I didn’t even know wizards <em>painted</em> pictures.”</p>
<p>“You—” The painting paused, then frowned down its narrow nose at him. “You’re a Muggleborn,” it said, in tones of realisation.</p>
<p>“Is that a fancier way of saying <em>Mudblood</em>?” Greg asked, bitterly.</p>
<p>The young man raised painted eyebrows at him. “What on earth is a ‘mud blood’?” it asked.</p>
<p>Greg sighed, his shoulders slumping again. “Me, apparently,” he muttered.</p>
<p>“Oh, Merlin, don’t tell me that ridiculous fool of a student has actually managed to get his rhetoric <em>accepted</em>!” the painting groaned, closing its eyes and shaking its head.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Greg tilted his head, confused.</p>
<p>The portrait shook its head. “Never mind,” it said, waving a hand dismissively. “From your words, am I to assume that some of the other students have been harassing you over your prestigious parentage, or assumed lack thereof?”</p>
<p>Greg winced and lowered his eyes to study his knees. ‘Harassing’ was a nice way of putting it; his tormentors might have been purebloods, but some of them had no objections to hurting him ‘the Mudblood way’.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see,” the portrait murmured. It cleared its throat. “May I ask what House you were Sorted into?”</p>
<p>“Hufflepuff,” Greg said, although it took several attempts for the portrait to hear him. Hufflepuff was apparently known as the House of the ‘leftovers’ – just another thing for people to hold against him.</p>
<p>“Then you are tenacious, and extremely loyal,” said the portrait. It rubbed the bridge of its nose, clearly thinking. “I believe,” it said, eventually, looking up – or was that down? – at Greg again, “that I may be able to assist you, pigmented though I am. If you are amenable, of course?”</p>
<p>It took Greg a moment; he was clever, in his own way, but he was only eleven, and his home neighbourhood hadn’t exactly been a place that encouraged that sort of talk. “You mean you can help me?” he asked, perking up.</p>
<p>The portrait inclined its head, smiling. “Precisely,” it agreed. “If you would like to stand in front of me, with your side towards me, and hold up your wand…”</p>
<p>Greg scrambled to his feet and into position in front of the painting. “Sorry, what was your name again?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Mycroft. Mycroft Holmes,” the portrait told him.</p>
<p>“Good to meet you, Myc,” Greg said, and smiled as the portrait spluttered indignantly. It <em>was</em> good to finally make a friend.</p>
