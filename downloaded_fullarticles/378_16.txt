    <p>"Maybe it's time for you to take a break, Harry."</p><p>Harry tapped his quill impatiently against the parchment before him, shifting about uneasily in his desk chair before scratching out the last two lines in his report. "I'm perfectly fine, Ron. I'm doing deskwork. Deskwork is fine."</p><p>"Deskwork is busywork, Harry, and you're burying yourself in it to the point that you're not sleeping. Honestly, you're here later than anyone else in the entire bloody Ministry," Ron complained, leaning back dangerously in the chair he'd pulled up next to Harry's workspace in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. "Seriously. You could at least get off a little earlier than usual, come have dinner with me and Hermione," he offered, giving a tentative, open smile as he let the chair legs drop back to stability on the tiled floor. He twisted around, resting his chin in his hands, elbows propped up on the edge of Harry's desk as he leaned forward. "We miss seeing you about, you know. It's been too long since the three of us have been together, even just for a few hours."</p><p>"I'm busy, Ron," Harry muttered, eyes focused on his work. "I'll come over another time." Ron's smile dropped.</p><p>"You know, you can't avoid this forever. You can avoid us, you can avoid your family and your friends as much as you want but you can't avoid what happ--"</p><p>The quill cracked between his fingers, splattering ink across his report. "Shit!" Harry swore, fishing around hurriedly in his desk drawer and finding a crusty old kerchief to mop up the mess.</p><p>"Harry--"</p><p>"I said I'm FINE, Ron!" he seethed, slamming his hand down on the desk. Parchment went flying and scattering off the surface, his ink bottle clattering to the floor and spreading black across the tiles alongside his desk.</p><p>Ron looked at him stolidly. "Yes, you're clearly perfectly good and stable, letting your magic get out of control like that." <br/><br/>Harry stared tiredly at the mess of papers all over the floor, ink sopping into some of the older reports that he'd neatly filed earlier on in the night. "Maybe I could do with a change," he admitted, sighing and dropping back into his seat. He could feel the edges of a headache coming on, and rubbed at the bridge of his nose to alleviate the building pressure. <br/><br/>"Maybe talk to your dad?" Ron suggested gently, "I'm sure he'd be happy to give you some leave off. Take a break, take a vacation. Hell, take a sabbatical and go see the world or something, you don't need to be here running yourself ragged like this." He reached out then, squeezing Harry's arm lightly. "I know it sucks, mate, but we can all see you're not handling this well. Something's got to give if things are going to get better." <br/><br/>"I don't know what to do," Harry confessed. "I haven't really ever done anything except <em>be</em> an auror."<br/><br/>"Then maybe you need to just <em>be Harry </em>for a little bit, instead? Find out who you are outside of the work again? Maybe get together with some folks, go play quidditch for a bit, see a game, pick up a new hobby or something. You don't really do much except work as it is, these days," Ron pointed out. <br/><br/>"Yeah," Harry agreed reluctantly. "I'll talk to dad about it sometime soon." <br/><br/>"Maybe tomorrow?" Ron suggested, nudging Harry with his elbow. "Don't put it off or you'll lose your nerve. I mean, what's the worst that can happen?" <br/><br/>Harry grumbled unintelligibly under his breath. What was the worst that could happen indeed? He had a good relationship with his father, though they'd grown a bit distant over the years. If anything, James would probably be all too pleased that Harry was even considering taking some time off or even lightening his workload, if the worried looks he constantly caught him shooting his way were anything to guess from. "I'll do it tomorrow," Harry relented.</p><p>"Great! Now why don't we clean up this mess and head over to me and Mione's for the evening? We can have dinner and chat about something other than work, yeah?" Ron flicked his wand and righted the ink bottle, its contents sucking back up and the lid stoppering itself to prevent further mishaps. <br/><br/>Harry sank back into his own thoughts as he grabbed the papers off the floor, throwing them into some sort of loose amount of order before shrugging into his coat and following after Ron to the main hall of the ministry. As Ron tossed floo powder on the fire and it flared a bright, iridescent green, Harry wondered if this could really be such a bad thing, or if it would be that much worse: without work occupying his every moment, how would he handle being alone with his thoughts? With his memories? <br/><br/></p><hr/><p><br/>True to expectation, James had been alarmingly pleased at the idea of Harry taking some time to 'sort himself out'. "Take as much time as you need!" he'd insisted, practically shoving Harry out his office door with coat in hand. "Your work will be waiting for you when you get back; after all, those cold case reports aren't going anywhere on their own." Yes. Cold cases. Because he wasn't fit to work in the field in his current state. It made him wonder, as he meandered out of the ministry out onto the muggle streets, as to whether he'd ever really be able to be out on the streets again enforcing the law and helping folks who needed it. Harry shook his head roughly and focused on the changing street lights as stopped on a corner. He was too caught up in his own head, Ron was right. He needed to stop focusing on what was going on and try to think more about doing things he enjoyed, things that were grounding. <br/><br/>He lasted about a week at home before he escaped to his godfather's. </p><p>"What did you do, when you graduated?" Harry questioned, sipping tentatively at the tea that Remus had placed before him. <br/><br/>"Me?" Sirius responded, slapping a cast iron pot down on the stove and filling it with a gout of water from his wand, "I took a gap year. Rode around the country with nothing but a backpack and my bike, seeing the sights. Wish I'd taken more pictures of that time, now that I think about it," he said, frowning. "Your grandmother was real disappointed that I didn't go straight into Auror training like James did, but honestly I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do with myself. And well, we've all seen how well I deal with bureaucracy, since that didn't really work out." <br/><br/>"What about you, Remus?" <br/><br/>"Well, I wasn't exactly...easily employable, admittedly," Remus sighed, leaning back in the chair opposite Harry at the kitchen table of No. 12 Grimmauld Place. "You know how our society frowns upon lycanthropy. Foolishly, at one point, I pursued rumors of individuals who'd been cured. Most of the rumors lead to hacks and conmen, but eventually that pursuit fell into the study of defense against the dark arts, in a very generalized way. I'd drop in every now and then to see how everyone was doing, but I felt like I'd already imposed myself a bit too much on others." <br/><br/>"Good thing we knocked some sense into you about seeing yourself as a burden," Sirius retorted from over by the stove. Remus smiled softly to himself at that.<br/><br/>"Harry, whatever you decide to do, we'll support you in it," Remus reassured. "I know you've always wanted to be an auror like your father, but there are other paths in life. If this isn't what you're meant to do, the answer will come to you in time. I know patience isn't your strong suit, but if you give this time to breathe, to heal, then perhaps you'll be able to come back to your career with renewed vigor." <br/><br/>"I'm only taking a month, Remus. It's not like I'm quitting," Harry groused. <br/><br/>"I know, Harry," Remus soothed, "All I'm saying is that you don't need to push yourself to be in perfect working order so quickly." <br/><br/>"You could borrow my bike," Sirius suggested. "It's old now, but it's still pretty reliable. Get out there, do something you haven't done before. Go find some new adventure!"<br/><br/>"Or some peace and quiet," Remus added. <br/><br/>"Maybe that's a good idea," Harry agreed, thoughtful. "I just...thanks for letting me stay here for a bit. I just couldn't really put up with the way everyone at home is watching me like...like I'm made of glass or something." <br/><br/>"Maybe it's time you found a place of your own?" Remus suggested. <br/><br/>"Why would he ever need to do that, he's got us, and he'll inherit the Potter's Cottage eventually," Sirius cut in. <br/><br/>"Sometimes a bit of separation and independence can be healing, Sirius, as I'm sure you also know." Remus set down his tea mug, leaning back in his seat. "Or it can provide the room one needs to grow into their own."</p><p>That really rang true, if Harry thought about it. He'd felt a bit stifled, admittedly, living with his parents after graduating. It had only been two years, as he found his footing in the DMLE, but maybe Remus was right. It was about time he moved out. After all, Ron and Hermione were living together in their own place already. <br/><br/>"I don't know what I'm going to do," Harry confessed. "but I'll figure something out."<br/><br/>"That's the spirit, Harry!" Sirius grinned. "Things will work out for the better, in the end." </p><hr/><p>'For the better' turned out to mean Sirius pestering Harry into taking his bike and an old expanding tent and going on a road trip around the country. At first Harry was more than a little annoyed at being rushed off out into the unknown, but the longer he spent riding about on Sirius's old motorbike, the more he felt the tension drop from his shoulders as he relaxed and began to just enjoy the passing scenery. He took his time as he got out of the city and began wandering into less populated areas, stopping occasionally to eat or just to appreciate the countryside. Later the first evening, he found that the tent Sirius had packed for him was very dusty, but quite cozy once the internal woodstove had been lit with a magical fire. His auror paranoia won out and he laid out a ward around his camping location, but settled in for a long night without much trouble. </p><p>Harry lay awake for some time, thoughts meandering over the events of the past few days with reluctant acceptance. He didn't know where this would lead him, or how long he'd travel for, but maybe Sirius had been right. Even if Harry wasn't gung-ho about taking some time off for himself, it already seemed to be doing him some amount of good. </p><hr/><p>
  <em>A small hand rested, slack, on the alley cobblestones. Filmy blue eyes stared, half-lidded and unseeing from a round, pale face. The body was long-cold, dumped next to an overfilled trash can like so much garbage, just like the last one had been, dressed in the same blue nightgown she'd been wearing the night she disappeared from her bed. A tangled, dirty ribbon had unwound from one of her braids and lay slack. She hadn't been killed here, but the cause of her death was clearly marked by the heavy bruising around her neck. He crouched down slowly beside the body, hands shaking as he reached out and brushed a stray lock of messy red hair from her face. Her eyes flickered, then, and he fell back as his horror built, throat closing up and breath catching in his lungs. Patricia Weasley's flat, dead gaze locked onto his, her head turning. "You didn't come save me, Uncle Harry. I kept calling for you and you never came." </em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I'm sorry," he choked out, "Patty I'm so sorry! We couldn't find you, we looked for weeks!" <br/></em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Why didn't you?" she asked, fingers grasping for his as the body rose bonelessly. "I needed you!" </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He scrabbled back across the cobblestones until his back hit the alley wall but still she crawled forward, dragging herself across the ground, eyes unfocused, hands reaching, grasping as she drew closer...</em>
</p><hr/><p>He sat up with a scream on his lips and hands flailing for his wand only to fall off the bunk with his sweat-soaked bedsheets tangled about his legs. He lay there on the floor, sobs wracking through his body. Harry didn't know how long he lay there as he blinked away the lingering image of Patty's bloodshot dead eyes, fighting down the rising urge to vomit as he dragged the back of his hand over his forehead, slicked with cold sweat. <br/><br/>Finally, he disentangled himself and shakily set about making a hot cup of coffee--there was no way he was sleeping again, after that. Pushing aside the tent flap, he stepped out into the soft, hazy light of morning just before the sun rose. It had been about a week since he'd last dreamed of it, a week of traveling about on Sirius's bike, trying to outpace the grief and overwhelming feeling of failure that had been plaguing him in the months since Patty's body had been discovered. </p><p>Suddenly feeling very vulerable with his emotions stripped bare and nothing to distract himself or hide behind, he dumped out his coffee, went back inside and threw on his clothes, then collapsed the tent and packed it up onto the bike. He needed to go, he needed to be anywhere but here. </p><p>Kicking off from the ground, the bike soared into the air and hung there momentarily, floating high above until the old back roads seemed like nothing but little lines across the countryside. Condensation formed on Harry's glasses before he took a deep breath and slammed his foot down on the gas pedal, sending the bike careening through the air. He didn't know where he was going or what he was going to do once he got there, but that didn't matter in the moment. </p><p>When Harry finally slowed down and alighted the bike down on a winding dirt road he had no clue where he'd come to land but he let the motorcycle continue on at a leisurely pace, his breathing calming as the overwhelming feeling of panic faded. Finally he passed an old, battered sign, and brought the bike to a stop before it. Beneath the weather-wear he could just barely make out the lettering. </p><p align="center">
  <em>CANESWORTH</em>
</p><p align="left">Beyond stretched a series of rolling hills with a few scattered old stone cottages, distant farmland stretching off in one direction, bordered by a sprawling forest that rose alongside the small village to turn into rocky cliffside off in the distance. Harry could smell salt on the air; the ocean wasn't far from here. Just beyond the sparse village, seated with an arching view over the whole area he could see the roof of an old Victorian hidden amid the trees. </p><p align="left">He parked in front of an old run-down pub that looked to be the only business in the area for miles and stood there, looking off at the distant house near the cliffside. It took Harry a moment to realize why the architecture struck him as oddly familiar, until he walked a bit closer and realized that while the house itself looked fairly sturdy, there was something about the tilt of the roof, the twisting curve of a side tower that reminded him distinctly of wizarding architecture. He stood there for a bit, studying it, before turning about on his heel and heading into the bar and walking up to the counter. </p><p align="left">"Excuse me," he began, addressing the elderly bespectacled fellow who was cleaning a glass at the sink with an old rag. "I was just driving by and saw the house, up there on the hill. Do you know who lives there?" </p><p align="left">"Nobody lives there," the muggle responded, "That place hasn't been occupied in decades. Why?" <br/><br/>"Just curious," Harry responded, "it looks to be a very beautiful house." <br/><br/>"Some things that are pretty to look at have a bite to 'em. I wouldn't be planning on doing anything but admiring from a distance, if I were you."</p><p align="left">"Is it private property, then?" Harry questioned. </p><p align="left">"Not really, at least not legally anyway," the bartender shrugged. "The cliffside's dangerous up there, most folks with any sense know better than to risk it." </p><p align="left">"Right," Harry hummed. <br/><br/>"You gonna buy something, or you just here to gossip?" <br/><br/>"Do you sell any food?" Harry questioned. He might as well have something to eat...he'd certainly missed breakfast, with that early morning ride. </p><p align="left">"I can throw some eggs and bacon on the grill. Don't got much more than that," the bartender responded gruffly before stumping off to do just that. </p><p align="left">Harry settled into a seat by the nearest window, looking out towards the house in the woods. There was something so very curious about it, nestled up there away from the pastoral village below. Something very, very curious indeed.</p>
