    <p>Though she would never know it, Constance Durillo had a profound effect upon the fate of the Wizarding World when she rendered her decision to leave her useless husband, Michael Durillo, to the arms of whatever younger woman he had been sniffing after this time. She packed all of her most essential belongings (which weren’t many, to be honest) into the Mercedes Benz he’d bought her the Christmas before, when he promised there would be no more women.</p><p>She did so with a minimum of tears, for the sake of her daughter Evangeline, who watched Constance the entire time with wide, questioning eyes.</p><p>“We’re just going on a little trip,” Constance assured her. “A little trip to grandma’s house.”</p><p>Evangeline brightened. She enjoyed her grandma’s house, largely because they only visited for holidays and other special occasions associated with presents. Though it was a long car ride, Evangeline was a relatively patient five-year-old girl, and something about the rocking motion of a vehicle tended to set her to sleep. The journey thus passed quick and dreamlike, and she generally awoke to find herself being hugged by the strongly perfumed arms of her grandmother, and ushered inside for milk and biscuits.</p><p>So Evangeline obediently packed up her favorite toys into a pink and silver backpack decorated with unicorns, and watched her mother empty her dresser drawers into a big suitcase. In the doorway, Constance Durillo paused, her daughter’s hand in hers, and stared out upon the street.</p><p>She almost went back inside, unpacked everything, and dismissed the impulse to go as a lark. Constance was not a bold woman, and she had never relished change. She had a comfortable life, a healthy daughter she adored, and a big house that her husband paid for. Most people in her situation would stay put.</p><p>But Constance didn’t. Instead, six hours later her daughter Evangeline stepped onto the kerb of Privet Drive outside her grandmother’s house in Little Whinging, and saw a boy with hair just as dark as hers, but bright green eyes instead, kneeling in a muddy flower bed and pulling up weeds.</p><p>Evangeline loved to play outside, but had never taken any interest in gardening. Her grandmother and her mother had started hugging several seconds before and hadn’t stopped, so while they were distracted Evangeline wandered across the dividing line between her grandmother’s lawn and the neighboring property, and stood watching the boy with a frown.</p><p>“Are you allowed to play in the flowerbed?” she wanted to know. The boy jerked as though she had thrown something at him, then snapped his head around to look at her. No one had ever looked at Evangeline like that – as though she were a dog off its leash and ready to attack. It made her take a step backward and the boy, reassured by her retreat, reached up with a muddy hand and pushed his glasses up on his nose, loosening the already wobbly juncture of the broken nose piece, held together with grubby tape. In the process he left a great smudge of dirt on his cheek.</p><p>“I’m not playing,” he said, in a very quiet voice.</p><p>“Oh,” Evangeline said, not understanding at all. As far as Evangeline could tell, children her age either slept, ate, played, or went along on errands, which could be sort of like playing if the parent you were with was not too tired. When you were older, another thing you could do was go to school, and do homework, and then when you were grown up you could also work. Evangeline wasn’t sure what working was, but thought based upon her father’s example, it was like going to school except with nicer clothes, and often involved staying out late.</p><p>“I’m not allowed to play in the mud unless I’m wearing old clothes,” Evangeline said, for the sake of conversation. Even at five, she was aware she wasn’t being well-received.</p><p>The boy frowned. “I told you, I’m not playing,” he insisted.</p><p>“Evangeline,” called Constance. “Come say hello to grandma.”</p><p>Evangeline waved at her mother over her shoulder, and then looked back at the boy determinedly. “That’s my name,” she explained. “Evangeline. What’s yours?”</p><p>“Harry,” he said, in a strained voice like he didn’t want to say. Evangeline smiled her best smile, the one people usually couldn’t help but return, and felt a rush of delight when the boy smiled back – very slightly, and very cautiously, but a smile still.</p><p>“Bye, Harry,” she said, and turned and ran back to her mother. Because she hadn’t been expecting them, Evangeline’s grandmother didn’t have any biscuits. But she settled Evangeline at the round table by the kitchen window with milk and jam on bread, and Evangeline looked out the window and found she could see Harry where she’d left him, kneeling in the garden.</p><p>“What’s that boy doing, mom?” The adults had fallen into a charged silence, though Evangeline hadn’t really noticed. Her mother looked up from her hands, then out the window, clearly not sure what to say.</p><p>“He’s doing his chores, I think, my darling,” said Evangeline’s grandmother. “Has lots of chores, that one,” she added, like she wasn’t sure about something. But Evangeline’s grandmother was very forgetful, as Constance always gently reminded Evangeline, so she never could manage to dwell on the little boy next door for long.</p><p>“What’s chores?” Evangeline asked. If they involved getting into the mud with more frequency, she found she was rather interested.</p><p>“Don’t you worry about any of that,” her grandmother assured her. “Now, I think I may have some sweets in the pantry…”</p><p>Even a strange boy playing in the mud couldn’t distract Evangeline from the prospect of sweets. She was only five, after all.</p><p align="center">****</p><p>The next day, Evangeline found the boy named Harry again, doing chores and not seeming to enjoy them very much. This time Evangeline approached him from the side, the way she’d learned to seek out dogs and horses, so as not to startle him. He still tensed at the sight of her and leaned away.</p><p>“Do you want to play with me?”</p><p>Evangeline was born to draw people into her orbit, though she would never understand why. She was already a beautiful child at five, without the awkward front teeth or clumsy limbs of so many girls her age. But even if she were plain, she had a steady attention and an easy smile that communicated a sincere interest in the people around her that they couldn’t help responding to.</p><p>Harry’s reaction to her was no different, though he had been conditioned so long to expect no real kindness, that anything resembling it made him search for the trap to its lure. Evangeline was so pretty and nice he might have thought she’d walked out of his imagination, but he knew his mind didn’t have the material to conjure anything quite like her.</p><p>“If you do, I’ll ask my mom, and she’ll ask your mom,” Evangeline explained. “Do you like maths?”</p><p>Harry blinked. All he knew about maths was that you had to count before you could learn them, and Uncle Vernon thought Dudley would be brilliant because he could count to five. Harry could count to one thousand one hundred and then he became confused. This was one of the ways he passed time in his cupboard.</p><p>”I’m not allowed to play with you,” Harry said, because he didn’t have to ask to know it was true. He also felt the startled hope that stirred in his heart when Evangeline spoke to him and asked him about maths and knew it should be squashed. It had never been right before.</p><p>Evangeline went very stiff with disbelief. Rejection, foreign to her now and forever, broke over her like a wave and made her cry. “If you didn’t want to play, you could have said so.”</p><p>She fled back to 5 Privet Drive to find her mother.</p><p align="center">****</p><p>A few days later, Petunia Dursley showed up on her neighbor’s doorstep with Dudley in tow. A moving van had delivered furniture and belongings attributable to old Miss Havershell’s daughter and granddaughter, and the neighborhood thus ascertained they were there to stay. Everyone knew the Havershells had money and the girls had married money, too. And the girl was just Dudley’s age.</p><p>When Constance opened the door, Petunia arranged her face into the broad smile she had practiced for years in the mirror; the one that didn’t accentuate her long face. Petunia’s effort was made more difficult by the fact that Constance was a lovely woman, and her casual attire at home on a Thursday afternoon included a silk blouse Petunia had admired in the display window at the boutique downtown for months but couldn’t convince Vernon to buy.</p><p>”Hello,” said Constance, with a strained smile for Petunia that turned a little sweeter when she looked down at Dudley. He lifted a hand, without a doubt to pick his nose, and Petunia intercepted it just in time and held it tightly in her own.</p><p>”I’m Petunia Dursley, from next door, and this is my son, Dudley. We thought we’d welcome you to the neighborhood, and see if your daughter might want to play with Dudley.”</p><p>”Next door,” Constance echoed. Her eyes narrowed. “Then you’re the family that instructed your child not to play with my daughter,” she said, voice steely.</p><p>When Evangeline came to Constance and tearfully related Harry’s words, Constance had soothed her while inwardly constructing an explanation. The neighbors were the conservative sort who saw divorce as a sin at worst and a fall from social grace at best. That didn’t really explain why the woman had appeared with her son this afternoon, though.</p><p>”Not at all,” Petunia said, surprised. She in fact did disdain divorce, but these were modern times and if her social network had decided that Constance was a desirable connection anyway, she wasn’t going to let her principles stand in the way of advancement.</p><p>Constance wilted against the doorway quite prettily, Petunia thought darkly. “I’m sorry,” said the woman, sounding heartfelt. “I just assumed. How rude of me.” She smiled at Dudley. “Would you like to play with Evangeline while I visit with your mother?”</p><p>“Evangeline,” Petunia said, privately horrified. “What a beautiful name.” She had let Vernon name Dudley, after growing up as “Petunia” and promising her future children classic, sturdy names that no one would raise an eyebrow at. Dudley, at least, was a traditional name.</p><p>Constance smiled at Petunia. “I have coffee <em>and</em> tea,” she told Petunia, as Dudley shuffled inside with an absence of enthusiasm neither adult could fail to note.</p><p>“Eva,” Constance called. There was the faint drum of rapid footfalls over their heads, then a girl with black hair, light blue eyes and deep gold skin came racing down the stairs. Petunia fought her two halves – one, that found the girl aesthetically lovely, and the other, that wondered what her father’s race must be – and hoped her face showed mere surprise as Evangeline arrived at the foot of the stairs and smiled politely at Petunia before directing an assessing look at Dudley. After studying him a moment, her lips pursed in a tiny frown.</p><p>Offended on Dudley’s behalf – he had <em>baby fat</em>, was all it was, and that scowl that didn’t look much better on him than it did on his father, but that wasn’t a permanent fixture – Petunia drew her son a little closer to her side with a hand on his shoulder. Or at least, she attempted to, but the sight of the girl was having some sort of effect on Dudley, and he stepped away from Petunia and his frown was replaced by a smile that bordered upon friendly.</p><p>“I’m Dudley,” he said, and Petunia was quite sure it was the first time he’d bothered to tell anyone without prompting. “We live next door. You’re very pretty,” he added, and Petunia colored and reached out a quelling hand toward him.</p><p>Constance, still looking tired but now smiling rather indulgently at Dudley, glanced at Petunia in a way that said she forgave his lapse in manners. Evangeline, accustomed to compliments, was not impressed.</p><p>“Do you like maths?” she demanded.</p><p>“I can count to five,” Dudley said cautiously.</p><p>Evangeline’s brows rose and she looked up at her mother accusingly. “Is he being serious?”</p><p>“Evangeline,” her mother said in a low voice, and Evangeline, recalling previous lectures on manners and the average child’s disinterest in maths, bit her lip and looked at Dudley again with a furrowed brow. “I’m sorry. But I had to ask.” She sighed. “Will it be dolls, then, or Lego?”</p><p>Dudley had little interest in toys that weren’t video games, but he was bizarrely eager to please standing in the presence of this odd, pretty girl, so he chose Lego then added, with a shy diplomacy that left his mother’s mouth hanging open, “Or whatever you want to play with, Eva.” He called her Ev-ah, like her mother had, the same phonetics as the first two syllables of her name when spoken with a base American accent. But Evangeline stiffened and shook her head.</p><p>“Call me Evangeline,” was her firm instruction. When Dudley nodded, looking taken aback, she nodded too and turned to lead the way upstairs.</p><p>From her bedroom window, 4 Privet Drive was visible, including the uncurtained window that showed Dudley’s second bedroom, mostly filled with toys he had barely played with and a furniture set that was somewhat oversized for the space.</p><p>“That’s our house,” Dudley said, for something to say, while Evangeline tugged a plastic box of Lego from under her bed.</p><p>Evangeline looked up, shaking her hair back from her face. She saw the window Dudley was looking out of and scrambled to her feet. “So that boy that wouldn’t play with me is your brother?”</p><p>Dudley looked blank.</p><p>“The boy with black hair and green eyes,” Evangeline explained. People didn’t do chores in <em>other</em> people’s gardens, did they? She almost vibrated with the energy of the mystery.</p><p>But then Dudley’s expression cleared. “Oh, <em>him</em>,” he sneered, in a very fair impression of his father that startled Evangeline so much she took several backward steps, and leaned against her bed. Oblivious, Dudley continued in the same tone. “<em>He</em> is my freaky cousin, not my brother.” He shuddered, as though to imply more had been insulting. And it had, rather. Dudley was very well-versed in how ashamed they all were of Harry.</p><p>Evangeline did not know what to say, or do, except that she had a strong inclination to shout for her mother, the way one did when one realized she was alone in the presence of someone dangerous. But then she remembered Dudley was a pudgy boy her age dim enough to be proud of counting to five, and she relaxed.</p><p>“I like him,” she declared, though she had told her mother through her tears the day she last spoke to Harry that she hated the boy in the muddy garden and hoped she never saw him again. Evangeline was born to be a contrarian. “And I don’t like you. And I don’t want to play with you.”</p><p>With that, she shepherded a bewildered and crestfallen Dudley back down the stairs and presented him to their mothers where they were stiffly taking tea and making small talk at the kitchen table.</p><p>“It’s time for Dudley to go home,” said Evangeline, and turned and ran back upstairs.</p><p>“She’s a solitary girl, at times,” Constance explained in a faint voice, trying to ignore the way Petunia was turning red in outrage. For his part, Dudley still seemed too startled by the abrupt turn of events to experience any offense. He craned his head back to look at his mother as she took him by the hand and towed him toward the door, even her heels on the floorboards seeming to make an angry noise.</p><p>“But we didn’t play Lego,” he said plaintively as they emerged onto the step.</p><p>“Good day, Constance,” Petunia said coldly over her shoulder. Their hostess was frowning in distraction, her mind already upstairs with her daughter. <em>What on Earth was all that about?</em> she wondered, waving absently at the two Dursleys and closing the door.</p><p>Upstairs, she found Evangeline staring out her bedroom window with her hands closed tightly on the edge of the sill.</p><p>“What’s the matter, sweetheart?”</p><p>But Evangeline was stuck in one of those moments in early childhood where her perception and instinct outpaced what she was able to express, so she was unable to do anything but snuggle against her mother’s side and quietly cry.</p><p>“It was the wrong boy,” she murmured into the folds of her mother’s expensive blouse, but her voice was too muffled for Constance to hear.</p>
