  <strong>SCENE I</strong>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>You cannot point to a single sane male that has not have a burning crush on Doris Sherbet. There is a supernatural beauty about her. It fits perfectly in this old, beautiful school. If you are correct, and it is a rarity when you are <em>not</em>, her mother is part fae, and the pale luminous glow about the Ravenclaw girl reminds others of said fact. Her eyes are the colour of seafoam, the very same Aphrodite was born of; her hair is long and curled, soft, gliding; her lips are rose petals, no doubt as pleasant to the touch as they are pleasant to admire.</p><p>Yet you are not sane. Quite frankly you have been off your rocker since you were born. An artist. A <em>fanatic</em>. Women are beautiful creatures, <em>yes</em>, but they cannot even come close to the male physique in term of erotica. And while the smitten gazes of your peers are forever drawn to Miss Sherbet in her girlish beauty, yours stays fixed on the teachers table. You even crank your neck as you sip your pumpkin juice, eyes roaming frantically for your very own <em>Dorian Grey</em>.</p><p>Your heart fluffs in your chest as you nearly spit in your cup. Albus Dumbledore laughs at something his fellow muttered under their breath, his grin so radiant you really cannot understand how <em>Doris</em> stands a chance against everyone’s favourite transfiguration Professor. If she is Eve, Albus is Adam. He, too, fits into this strange school. He appears moulded for it. His suit is exquisite, too.</p><p>Having a crush on your teacher is fairly normal, you rationalize. Especially when said teacher looks like <em>that</em>.</p><p>“<em>Oi</em>, (Lastname), you with us, mate?” Roman calls you, his foot nudging yours with an impish kick. You raise an unimpressed brow, irate at the disturbance.</p><p>Vasnev Roman Tarasovich, or simply Roman to his closest friends, is one of the most <em>insufferable</em>, pure-blood fanatics you have had the pleasure of ever encountering. His accent is almost as thick as his head; bushy, tar locks are cut with precision; his eyes are sunken, yet quick, and if one did not know him one would assume he is a grown man sat amongst children and teens. Roman considers you a dear ally, a companion of theatrical merit. You find any association with him poor taste. Yet his family is composed of exclusively Russian oligarchs and they take you along with them on holiday during summer. His fuming over women and their bodies, and a sort of perverse fascination with breasts, is repulsive, and so is he. However, he is <em>useful</em> and you have no problem <em>using him</em> for personal gain.</p><p>A true Slytherin, you are. The Head Boy badge neatly clipped to your robe is not only for decoration.</p><p>You: “Done playing with mini-Roman?”<br/> Vasnev: “Was not, you cock.”<br/> You: “Really? Thought Sherbet got you off with a glance.”<br/> Vasnev: “As if she doesn’t get <em>you</em> off.”</p><p>He gives you an annoyed look, one you are far too used to by now, “Well, whatofit…You heard about the gathering?” He questions in a hushed, secretive tone. His dim eyes round the table. Some chattering students send you two a curious, adoring peek, yet blush and promptly turn away once spotted. Roman has a sort of aura about him. It attracts just as much as it repulses.<br/> </p><p> “No.” You drone, chewing, “Not planning on going either.”</p><p>“But Sherbet’s hosting. For the start of the school year.”</p><p>You take a thoughtful sip, “I was not invited.”</p><p>“<em>And</em>?” Roman frowns, “Never stopped you before.” It never has, truly, “Besides…” He leans in. You would prefer if he did not. “I heard there will be something <em>stronger</em> than punch…And I can bet all my galleons that Doris will have too much and <em>well</em>…You know how the rest goes. She’s a cherry.”</p><p>“An adventuress you will not have the pleasure of bedding for the sole reason that you desperately want to.” You say. Your arm slings over his shoulder, “Mate, being <em>stupid</em> is one thing, but now you’re just <em>delusional</em>.”</p><p>Vasnev: “Fuck you, (Lastname).”<br/> You: “Consider me fucked. Besides, I was planning on-…”<br/> Vasnev: “Locking yourself up in your dorm?” <br/> You: “Studying can be quite beneficial. You should try it.”<br/> Vasnev: “It’s the first bloody day, mate, and you are already being a pompous ass.”<br/> You: “Did you learn a new word during the summer?”<br/> Vasnev: “If <em>crucio</em> wasn’t illegal I swear on Merlin’s Beard you would be howling from pain right now.”</p><p>The lively banter is interrupted by the sudden up rise of students. The Slytherin table moves lazily compared to the others. The start of the year feast has come to a close. You finish the last drops of your drink before you come to stand. Just as you are about to belittle Roman one last time, a familiar, angelic figure graces you with its presence. Doris Sherbet stands in front of you, her group of giggling friends behind her like some sort of twisted form of moral support.</p><p>“…(<em>Name</em>) ?” The way she says your name is velvety. It would stir some adultery emotions, if you felt any for her kind.</p><p>However, your carefree smile shows no distain, “Yes, <em>Doris</em>?” Her face grows red with blush. She clears her throat.</p><p>“I was…wondering…if I will see you tonight.”</p><p>“That you will, sweetness.” Roman jumps into the fray, his large hand landing on your shoulder with an encouraging pat. You really do not like his intervention, and Sherbet clearly despises it, too, even if she is too polite to outward say it, or even show it. Your plans were to look over your transfiguration notes one last time before tomorrow’s class. Now you will have to find amusement trapped in a room with sweaty, horny teenagers drinking themselves stupid.</p><p>You could also give everyone detention. Start the year <em>right</em> by ruining it for everyone else. That idea is a temptress. It nearly lures you into its clutches.</p><p>“I’ll see you at midnight, Doris.” You say, your voice soft, near dismissive. Yet she does not notice. The group of girls giggle behind her in eerie union. Her lips bloom with a lovely smile.</p><p>“I’ll…I’ll look forward to it!” She saunters away with her friends, their whispers echoing in snake tongues. You could not decipher them even if you tried.  Roman shakes his fist with excitement. You do not enjoy being roped into something that is clearly not your scheme.</p><p>“You sly devil <em>you</em>.” Roman congratulates, “The whole school will be talking about it. Doris Sherbet and (Name) (Lastname). The <em>perfect</em> couple.”</p><p>“I have no taste for romance.” Your eyes catch a glimpse of dishevelled ginger hair disappearing behind the double doors, “Tying myself down is too much of a hassle when there are much more <em>explorations</em> to be done. Do excuse me, now.”</p><p>“You’re my hero, (Lastname)!” He calls after you.</p><p>Your footsteps echo in the medieval halls of the palace; there is magic in the air, freshness now that the new year has started. The corridors and secret passage ways that had been vacant during the summer breathe with life again. Running here is almost as dear as a hug from a true friend. At the very least, the sensation is similar.</p><p>You catch up with the anxious Newton Scamander on his way to the dungeons. Your fingers wrap around his wrist and you pull him out the crowd of students, he nearly releasing a terrified scream at your sudden presence. Though when his friendly green eyes meet your mischievous (colour) ones he seems to calm, even give you a loop-sided grin. He follows after you like a lost puppy, eerily aware of your hold on his wrist.</p><p>“Haven’t had the chance to talk with you, yet.” You admit and stop, turn to him with a delirious smile and velvety, honey-coated tone, “You always run away from me before I have the chance.”</p><p>Where Roman is your pocket galleons, Newton is an <em>actual</em> friend. The two of you have been through thick and thin. Thick meaning insane study sessions, since Newt would never put anyone, himself included, in danger, and thin meaning how close your sanity has till it withers from his near maddening shy exterior. You became acquaintances entirely by chance. You were bored. He was in your way. You have no idea how he tolerates your madness.</p><p>He is most pretty though, and you will admit that you are extremely shallow. His freckles are like stars littered through the night’s sky. He glows with a certain warm light. His presence is comforting. He is Ophelia’s rival in terms of beauty.</p><p>But he is just so <em>boring</em>.</p><p>“I saw you on the train.” Newt admits, “I wanted to say hello, <em>but</em>…”</p><p>“But you chickened out?” You finish for him. You let go of his frail wrist, shoving your hands into your pockets. “Nothing new or surprising. Still, I figured you would at least wait around for me after dinner.”</p><p>“You were…” He trails off, eyes nervously jumping around the décor, “With…Roman…and Miss Sherbet…”</p><p>“<em>Seriously</em>?” You stumble, “You saw, <em>too</em>?”</p><p>“(Name), the whole school was staring.” It is one of the few times Newton sounds serious, confident. It is a tone that always catches you off guard in the most pleasant way.</p><p>You dissect his appearance: cheeks tinted with a soft red; shoulders tense; normally empathetic green eyes now bore into the ground, stark and cold as winter. There was an edge to his tone.</p><p>You can hardly contain the smugness as you ask, “My my, Newt, are you…<em>jealous</em>?”</p><p>“W-<em>What</em>?” He stammers, startled. You shrug, freighting innocence.</p><p>“No matter how many Sherbets undress before me, know that you still are my very <em>favourite</em>.” You finish with a wink. Newt gulps, glances away.</p><p>Newton: “Not funny.”<br/> You: “I thought it was pretty funny.”<br/> Newton: “It was not.”</p><p>He is firm with his decision. His arms cross over his chest and he keeps his gaze steeled away from you. You are fully ready to throw a dramatic temper tantrum, yet echoing footsteps stop you in your tracks. The corridor is empty besides the two of you, but by the sound of it, some Professor will interrupt your dilly dallying and shush you back to your separate Common Rooms. And you hadn’t even had the chance to tell Newton about the gathering in moonlight. If you are going, so is he. You refuse to suffer in solitude.</p><p>Before you can think straight (not that you ever), you grab hold of his arm and yank him into a broom closet, the door opening and shutting with a gentle click. Newton is speechless for a heartbeat, before his lips open to protest but your hand quickly clasps over them and he shushes. They are unbelievably soft to the delicate flesh of your palm. It is a bit distracting. In the dark you can somewhat see the strange look he is giving you. You only manage to grin in return.</p><p>The footsteps come and pass without a stop to ponder. Danger is averted, and so your hand drops from his face. Only now do you realize how close the two of you are. This room is heavenly small.</p><p>You: “Tonight. At the gala. Sherbet is throwing a little celebration. You are going.”<br/> Newton:  “I am not.” <br/> You: “I am going. You are, too.”<br/> Newton: “(Name), listen I really…<em>really</em> don’t feel like s-seeing you <em>and-and</em>…”</p><p>He trails off, uncertain, conflicted. You can almost hear his heart beating in his chest. It is strangely intimate. You inhale sharply; in the mystery of the shadows your hand wanders to his, firm and reassuring.</p><p>“I will not leave you.” You swear, your voice a rasp echo of your usual drawl, “I simply do not want to go alone.”</p>
