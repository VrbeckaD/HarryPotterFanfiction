    <p>
  <span>The boy from District 1 is staring again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry does his best to ignore it, focusing instead on the weight of his knives in his hands, on the way his sparring partner shifts as she prepares to lunge. This isn’t the first time he’s fought Millicent. Most days, sparring was the only thing they had to pass the time once work in the pens was done for the day, so he knows exactly how worried he should be. The mace she holds now is lightweight, made of rubber instead of metal, but a hit would still hurt, and he’d like to avoid it if he can. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her eyes narrow, giving her away as they always do, and she moves. All thoughts of the staring Career are driven from his head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the most part, they’re evenly matched. Where Millicent beats him for sheer strength, Harry has always been faster, and she’s quicker to tire. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he ducks a blow that would have knocked out at least one tooth, if not broken his nose, Harry sees the boy has moved closer, not even pretending not to watch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moment’s distraction is all Millicent needs, and with a hit to his chest that knocks him off his feet, he finds himself flat on his back, Millicent’s knee pressed against his hip as she looks down at him with a frown.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re distracted,” she tells him, and Harry glares, his cheeks flushed. He can’t deny it. “What is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The last thing he wants is for her to know why. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’s always been a bit mean, and that was </span>
  <em>
    <span>before </span>
  </em>
  <span>they were entered into a death tournament, where every weakness is fair game. He doesn’t know if the Career is a weakness, yet, but he could be.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pokes her with the blunted tip of his knife. “Let me up.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Millicent is looking at the Career, whose staring has grown no less blatant. “Is it him?” she asks, tilting her head his way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry thumps his head back to the mat. “I hate you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up.” Millicent taps his chest with her mace, making him wince. She grins, then. “It’s mutual.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighs. He doesn't know why he bothered trying to hide it. He should have known she’d notice. “Everyone thinks you’re stupid, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.” She looks proud.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, hurry up and show them otherwise. I’m tired of being your only victim.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Millicent only laughs at him, mocking as ever, but when she stands, she offers him her hand, pulling him to his feet. She claps him on the shoulder, and there’s some comfort in the pain. “Get it together, Potter,” she says, “You’re the only one here that’s tolerable. Don’t let some pretty face ruin that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry snorts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Always the charmer, Bulstrode,” he says dryly, “I think I’ll kill you first.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Millicent laughs again, a wild edge to the sound that wasn’t there before. “You can try.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For the next hour, Harry feels the Career’s eyes on him as he moves through the training room, testing out the facilities the Capitol has so generously provided. All of it is nicer than he’s used to, but he gets the hang of it pretty quickly. Quick enough, at least, that he shows no weakness, and no one bothers to pay him any attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No one, that is, but the boy from District 1. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Keeping hold of the axe he’s been preparing to throw, Harry turns sharply to face the boy, glaring. “What the fuck is your problem?” he demands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy looks startled. Harry doesn’t buy it for a moment. “I don’t have a problem,” he says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah? Then what’s with all the staring?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy grins. Like most kids from the richer districts, his face has been sculpted; he looks too handsome to be real. His eyes alone are disarming—a deep red that gleams in the bright lights of the training facility. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry glares harder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No need to be defensive,” he says, coming closer. Harry doesn’t step back, though part of him wants to. “I was only admiring your form.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s mouth drops open in shock. “You—” He feels his cheeks heat, equal parts flustered and furious. Is it not enough, he thinks, that he’s been entered into a death tournament? Must he deal with this, too? “Well, stop it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm.” The boy circles him, and Harry forces himself not to turn in place, though his shoulders tense to have the boy at his back. Once he’s finished his circle, the boy stops before him, even closer than before. “No, I don’t think I will.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry bristles, hating the fact that he has to look up to meet his eyes. “Then go admire it from somewhere else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy laughs at him, and Harry’s had enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stalks forward, shoving past the boy as he looks for Millicent. Even in a good mood, the sour look on her face is enough to drive even the worst assholes away. If anyone can help him, it’s her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But before he can get far, the boy grabs him by the wrist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry whirls to face him, opening his mouth to spew the vilest insults he can think of. Before he can, the boy says, “Spar with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment, Harry thinks he really might lose it. His chest feels tight. His palms itch. His fingers clench around the axe’s grip. But instead of charging the other boy, or shouting, or giving him a taste of the axe, head first, he only stares, his pulse beating heavy in his throat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He bares his teeth in what hardly deserves to be called a grin, and for the first time, the Career looks almost nervous. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry turns his wrist in the boy’s hold, until he can grip him in turn and pull him forward, off balance. He says, a vicious sort of glee rising in his chest, “I will.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My name’s Tom, by the way,” the boy tells him as they stand opposite each other in one of the sparring rings. Where Harry expected the other boy to choose something sharp for a weapon, he’s gone for a staff instead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry doesn’t bother answering, too busy checking the tape on his hands. He’s chosen not to use knives, this time, because he doesn’t want to give too much away. He doesn’t want to look dependent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, he’s kept hold of his axe, and his other hand is free.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he prepares, he forces himself to take deep, even breaths. No killing, he reminds himself. And no maiming, either. They’re only allowed to kill each other when the cameras are rolling. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What a fucking joke. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tightens his grip on the axe, until his fingers ache, then releases again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s something building, deep in his chest. A fire that burns hotter with every word he bites back, with every snide comment or disdainful look from the Careers. Especially this one, he thinks, as he stares down the boy from District 1. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom. What a boring name—so unlike all the others. He wonders where it comes from.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then he decides he doesn’t care. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He never wanted this, but he’s here. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>here. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s going to make it mean something, even if all it ever means is a glimmer of fear in this boy’s red eyes. “Ready?” he asks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom nods. “Ready.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And they begin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fighting Tom is nothing like fighting Millicent. For all that he’s just as tall as she is, he lacks the muscle mass, the stocky limbs, that make her such a threat. No, he’s threatening in a different way. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s better trained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His reach is longer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s faster, but he’s not as fast as Harry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t tire as easily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This, Harry learns when he ducks beneath Tom’s arm, just barely dodging a punch to his throat. He thrusts himself forward, head-butting Tom in his solar plexus and knocking him back, though he doesn’t fall. As Harry takes advantage of his stumble to breathe, Tom looks largely unruffled. His cheeks are flushed, and a bead of sweat drips down the side of his face, but he’s barely breathing heavy at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The others think you’re soft,” Tom tells him. He’s grinning as he says it, and there’s a look in his eyes that’s half-pleasure, half-wild. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is another difference.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Millicent fights, she retreats into silence, letting her strength speak for her. Tom, though. Tom is a talker, and a clever one. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought so too, you know,” Tom continues. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry grits his teeth. Instead of talking back, he lunges forward, swinging. Tom blocks him, and they're close enough that Harry can see flecks of russet in his eyes, like dried blood. “Shut up,” he says again, gasping.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom grins. “And you are soft, aren’t you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry spins away, kicking out as he goes and knocking Tom off balance, though he recovers before Harry can get another strike in. “Shut </span>
  <em>
    <span>up.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you’re angry, too.” There’s something manic in Tom’s expression, something that makes Harry want to back away, to bow out. But he doesn’t. “You hate me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry laughs—because it’s true, but it isn’t the whole truth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not special,” he says, baring his teeth in a grin. “I hate all of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry snorts, looking for an opening and seeing nothing. “You and every other fucking Career. You’re all the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom tsks. “I assure you, we are not.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No?” Harry ducks a blow to his face. “How’s that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For one, they’re all under the impression that you’re worthless, both as prey and an ally.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you aren’t?” Harry asks, skeptical. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom smirks. “I am not. In fact, I have a proposal for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry almost groans. Instead, he darts forward, missing Tom’s head by only a hair's width, and it makes him feel better. Good enough to say, “Let’s hear it, then.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Work with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry is surprised enough by the suggestion that he freezes, just long enough for Tom to take advantage, and he finds himself flat on his back for the second time today, looking up into Tom’s triumphant expression. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You heard me,” Tom says. He presses down against Harry’s chest, making him wheeze. “In the arena. I want you to work with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You mean…” Harry shifts, and Tom moves with him, keeping him on the floor. “An alliance?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom grins, pleased. “Exactly that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.” He says it before he can think about it, but he finds he doesn’t want to take it back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s seen the games before; they all have. The Careers are always the first to turn on each other, splintered by their egos, their lust for the spotlight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He can’t risk it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No?” Tom asks, and he has the gall to sound surprised, as if he expected Harry to leap at the chance. “Why not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I don’t trust you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom scoffs. “You shouldn’t trust anyone here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, good,” Harry says, “I guess we </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> agree on something.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom narrows his eyes. “It’d be to your benefit, you realize.” He leans down, and Harry squirms beneath him, trying to find a position that will let him breathe easy. “The other Careers are vicious, this year. I can take care of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah?” Harry attempts to buck Tom off, but the Career doesn’t move. He’s too heavy. “In exchange for what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom leans down, closer, until Harry can feel his breath against his cheek. “Why, the pleasure of your company, of course.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Harry snarls. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He attempts to lunge off the mat, to take a bite out of Tom’s cheek, the rules be damned, but Tom pulls away too quickly. He’s laughing, Harry notes through the heated fog in his head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you,” he says, all but spitting the words. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, don’t be that way,” Tom says, pouting as he frees one hand to trail his finger down Harry’s cheek. “We’d be perfect, you and I. I’d protect you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Harry is so tired, suddenly. He’s tired of the stares, of the evaluations, of these </span>
  <em>
    <span>goddamned</span>
  </em>
  <span> Careers with their fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>scare tactics </span>
  </em>
  <span>and their </span>
  <em>
    <span>deals. </span>
  </em>
  <span>He’s tired of all of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So the next time Tom leans closer, too busy taunting Harry—goading him for some purpose he doesn’t know—to pay attention to the way Harry is moving beneath him, he takes advantage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He twists, kneeing Tom between his legs and planting his foot, using it as leverage to turn them over, until he’s straddling Tom’s chest, the handle of his axe held against his throat and keeping him there. As Tom looks up at him, his eyes wide, Harry bares his teeth in a snarl. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He leans down, delights in the way Tom’s breath hitches, and says, “I can protect </span>
  <em>
    <span>myself.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That was embarrassing,” Millicent tells him, later. Then, “You looked good together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s face flushes, and he claps his hands over his cheeks as if that could keep her from noticing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up,” he mutters, making his escape before she can say anything more. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He retreats to the cavernous bathroom, locking the door behind him. Millicent has no sense of boundaries when it comes to needling him, and she’d absolutely follow him in if he didn’t. </span>
