  <i>~Oh baby when you talk like thaaat!~</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"You make a woman go maaad," Harry finds himself singing along, amidst the curious haze that occupies the space that would normally be: all of his surroundings.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"So be wise, and keep ooon," a new voice joins in, and the owner seems fully committed to upholding a (very sub-par) Shakira impression, yodelling and all. Harry has a slight foreboding feeling that everything's about to go a bit pear shaped about now, when a lithe body swings into his, literally out of nowhere, and pulls him into a tango. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Reading the signs of my-- whoa, what the hell?" he interrupts himself in the midst of this exciting recital of 'Hips Don't Lie', when it appears that he's got an armful of pretty, blonde:</i>
</p><p><i>"I'm pregnant," comes the malicious whisper in his ear, successfully sending him </i>flying<i>.</i></p><p> </p><p>"VANESSA THORNBERRY!!" Harry shouts, leaping out from the comfort of his bed and wrapping his arms around himself reflexively, for whatever reason. He's panting hard and searching fervently for the aforementioned woman, only to find a rumpled bed, a blurry Ron Weasley at the door and a Wizarding radio playing- you guessed it- 'Hips Don't Lie' at a tinny pitch. </p><p>"That was 'Hips Don't Lie' by Shakira here on The Muggle Mixer-!" the radio blares, before it's silenced by the redhead with a flick of his wand. </p><p>"Vanessa Thornberry? Now <i>that's</i> a name I haven't heard for a while around here," Ron says, amused, and a flustered Harry grapples around on the cluttered bedside tabletop for his glasses.</p><p>"Dream," he grunts once he finds them and puts them on. He scratches at his bare chest.</p><p>"Good dream? Bad dream?" Ron quips, collapsing onto his roommate's bed, fully dressed in his Auror robes.</p><p>"Sexy dream?" he continues with an ill-fitting leer in Harry's direction, causing him to scowl darkly, "Come on! Give a man some details!"</p><p>"Definitely <i>not</i> 'sexy dream'," the brunet groans and lies back down. He's still in his boxers (sleepwear, he says to outsiders, lest the Prophet catch wind of it and have a field day. God knows they wouldn't hesitate to make a front page spread titled 'High and Mighty Potter Wears Tighty Whities To Bed!') so he's technically allowed, by law, to burrow back into his wonderful, warm duvet and forget about the world. He resists the temptation, "The worst dream. A nightmare of astronomic proportions."</p><p>"Hermione Point," Ron grumbles, and Harry nods in acknowledgment. Every fancy phrase to pass either Harry or Ron's lips earns the speaker a Hermione point. It's been their own little variant on the Hogwarts House point system ever since the war had ended and they had realized they missed Hogwarts, very much. Harry's confident he's going to win the Hermione Cup this year. </p><p>"What was it about?" Ron asks, staring up at a spot on the ceiling.</p><p>"We were dancing to Shakira and she did the bad thing," Harry says vaguely, and Ron nods, understanding his terminology immediately. Of course he understands. It was the worst thing to happen to Harry after Voldemort. </p><p>"I'd say you ought to get out and date some more," the redhead says thoughtfully, and at the sight of Harry's scowl, adds: "except your perpetual type is Pretty, Blonde, Bitchy women. Capitalized."</p><p>"Hermione Point. Nice," Harry acknowledges, and Ron ducks his head in thanks, "and no! That's bollocks."</p><p>"But it's not!" Ron whines, "Kathy? Tiffany? <i>Vicky</i>? We're not seriously forgetting Vicky, mate."</p><p>Harry winces. Yes, Vicky had been a grave mistake, especially when she'd gotten a server at <i>Le Petit Chateau</i> fired for looking at her a second too long. And when she'd thrown out half of Harry's sock collection when he 'forgot her birthday' while in truth he'd been planning a surprise party for her. It had taken numerous summoning and cleaning charms, as well as a hellish breakup to retrieve every last pair, and yet, they'll never be the same. You can't mess with a man's socks, period. </p><p>"Okay, Vicky was bad," Harry admits tightly, "but-"</p><p>"No buts, Harry, you know I'm right," Ron says with an air of finality and Harry, for lack of a better thing to do, sulks back in his covers while his roommate smirks down at him like the cat that got the cream. </p><p>Then with a sly smile, Harry says, "You're getting married this month." Ron's smirk effectively dissolves into panic. </p><p>"Mate!" he yelps, immediately jumping to his feet and starting to pace the room like a madman. Harry's smile doesn't waver in the slightest. <i>Works every time</i>.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>Yes, Ron and Hermione are finally getting married. Four and a half years of sexual tension and three more of passionate dating had lead up to that fateful day. Ron on one knee with a little velvet box in his shaking hands. A tearful Hermione startling everyone else in the restaurant with her pitchy "YES! OH MY GOD, RONALD, YES!!" And Harry sitting at a back table Polyjuiced into Uncle Vernon (eurgh) passive-aggressively initiating a collective applause ("Clap your hands, you worthless buffoons! Don't you lot ever watch romantic movies till the end?").</p><p>But after the humdrum of the engagement and the whole 'I've got a fiance(é)!' phase had worn off, it was all a flurry of tedious wedding preparations, robe fittings, ring shopping, endless planning, and Hermione's penchant for ridiculous, overambitious ideas. </p><p>"You're not having a renaissance artwork themed wedding." </p><p>-Harry says, blunt as can be. It's Ron and Hermione's lunch break at the Ministry, and Harry's been more than happy to come visit every single day. It's the Quidditch off-season, and as much as Harry loves every moment he spends playing for Puddlemere United, he's grateful for the long, lazy mornings he spends in his flat doing nothing. And chicks. Until Vanessa, of course. </p><p>Regardless, Ron isn't having half as good a time as Harry. He's got his red head in his hands, staring dejectedly at his half eaten turkey sandwich as Hermione prattles on and on and on about her plans for the wedding. She's been doing that a lot lately; using every waking moment of the day, aside from work, talking about what's about to be the happiest day of her life. And presumably, not Ron's. Ron's will likely be the day after the wedding, when he's married and done with all the preamble and allowed to shag his new wife without the fear of- god forbid- any more planning. </p><p>"Yes we are, Harry!" the couple said in unison. Though while Hermione's tone was firm, Ron's was weak, and a tad long-suffering. </p><p> "It'll be wonderful! Muggle renaissance art is beautiful and unique on it's own, and that's barely scratching the surface of it! Have you <i>seen</i> Wizarding artwork from that time period?" Hermione says, seemingly in one breath, eyes bright and cheeks aflush. </p><p>"No," Harry replies, even though the question was a rhetorical one, "and neither has Ron, I bet."</p><p>He casts a glance in his mate's direction, but the redhead's eyes have gone misty and he's gazing at Hermione with love-hearts in them.</p><p>"Oh, it's fascinating! Imagine all the gorgeous outfits! Ron can be in some of those dashing dress robes with frills at the neck! And you too, Harry."</p><p>"Surely we're not letting this happen without a smashing debate! Isn't that right, Ron? ...Ron?"</p><p>Harry's waving a hand in Ron's line of sight, fruitlessly of course. </p><p>"I don't care. I'm getting <i>hitched</i>!" Ron says dreamily, and Harry's stomach sinks to his feet. He's estimating the number of trays laden with baked goods he'll have to dish out to bribe Ron with until he can get his head out of his arse and hopefully put a stop to all this mad talk about frills. Then Hermione drops a second metaphorical bomb:</p><p>"And we're inviting everyone from all kinds of Houses!" she says cheerfully, jotting the idea down onto a bit of parchment lest it abandons her. </p><p>"Mm," agrees Ron.</p><p>"So that'll include Draco Malfoy," Hermione says carefully, and Ron's eyes bug out. It's almost like a switch has been flipped, and it would be funny, really, if Harry weren't so baffled at the sudden change in gears. </p><p>"No!" Ron exclaims, and at Hermione's puppy eyes, swallows thickly and firmly reiterates: "Hermione. No!"</p><p>"I can't believe you're just allowing us all to be collectively tortured with poncey, frilly uniforms but decide it's time to put your foot down when it comes to inviting a kid who made one too many 'yo momma' jokes in school."</p><p>"One too many-! Harry this is Malfoy we're talking about here! Malfoy? You know?" </p><p>Ron's blue eyes are wide and looking at him in a way that makes him wonder if he's grown another head. The third member of the trio continues fervently jotting down names on her list, her sad apple pie lying cold and forgotten in front of her. Lunch time should really be renamed 'mucking about because it's the only time of the day you can avoid doing your work and feel alright about it' time.</p><p>"Come off it Ron, please? It'll be such a fantastic way to burn old bridges and build new ones! Possibly nice ones. With lovely colour-shifting streetlights. Overlooking a gorgeous blue sea, perhaps..." Hermione sighs, euphorically, while somehow continuing to write on her parchment. </p><p>"Yeah, mate, Malfoy's not that bad anymore," Harry shrugs, shifting to balance his elbows on the glass table, careful to avoid the mysterious orange goop that's been coagulated on the surface of it since Merlin-knows-when. Granted, he hasn't seen Malfoy up close since the war trials, and even then, Malfoy had not been quite... well... Malfoy enough to call it a proper interaction. He's just recently joined the Falmouth Falcons as Seeker: a year or so later than Harry had entered the world of competitive Quidditch, given that he's probably had to train longer. All he's seen of the blond after that is, well, his blond hair- silver, if you will- characteristically glinting from afar. </p><p>"Probably," Harry adds as an afterthought, "he's <i>probably</i> not that bad anymore. I certainly haven't talked with him."</p><p>"This is mad talk," Ron squeaks, and the shock of both his best friends (one of them being his fiancée!) having opinions so drastically at odds with his own shocks him back into his perpetual state of hunger. He picks up his no doubt cold turkey sandwich and continues devouring it, as he should, "Hermione, I know all this planning is stressing you out, and you must be in a fragile headspace at this moment, and I forgive you. But from you, Harry? Are you sure this isn't just your... little <i>issue</i> speaking?"</p><p>Harry turns to the enchanted window with a huff, squinting as the sunlight stings his eyes, "Half a Hermione Point for articulacy. And I don't know what you're talking about." But he has a feeling that he does know, and that's a concerning thought on its own. </p><p>"We talked about it just this morning."</p><p>"If it's my fondness towards 'Hips Don't Lie', then I'll have you know-"</p><p>"No, it's about your 'fondness'," Ron air quotes this bit, the devil, "towards PWBBs!"</p><p>"Pubes?!" Hannah Abbot shrieks as she walks by, nearly tripping over her heels in the process and scuttling away as soon as she recovers. Harry grimaces; they really need to get a new gathering spot. Smack in the centre of the Ministry cafeteria is a horrible place to be discussing Harry's fondness towards:</p><p>"Pubes?" Harry asks belatedly, shaking his head as if that would help wrap it around the situation at hand, "What did you just say?"</p><p>"No, not pubes, PWBBs!" Ron says seeming quite happy with himself. </p><p>"Both of what you just said sound exactly the same."</p><p>"I believe he means P.W.B's, Harry," Hermione says fondly, and ruffles Ron's hair, "That's a Hermione Point for making inappropriate-sounding acronyms. Oh Ron, this is wonderful!"</p><p>Ron smirks at Harry, who scowls right back, "And what's a P.W.B? Do I even want to know?"</p><p>"It's actually P.W.B.B for Pretty Women Blonde n' Bitchy," Ron says at the same time as Hermione says "Petite Woven Baskets!"</p><p>Their heads whip around to face eachother.</p><p>"Ron! That's disgusting!" Hermione gasps, apalled, just as Ron asks, "Petite Woven Baskets?"</p><p>"They're kind of... neat," Harry mumbles sheepishly while simultaneously shooting Hermione a dark look. She promised she wouldn't tell! Well, on the bright side, maybe he could finally unshrink his growing collection of baskets and start decorating the flat with their adorable reedy goodness... "what were we talking about?"</p><p>"Your obsession with Pretty, Blonde, Bitchy Women!" Ron exclaims, thoroughly exasperated, "And Malfoy's one of em! That's why you're being so-"</p><p>"Hey! Last time I checked, Malfoy's definitely not a woman," Harry shudders, "Scratch that. I've never checked to confirm."</p><p>"So you admit he's pretty?" Ron quirks a speculative eyebrow as he finishes his sandwich off. </p><p>"He's an alright-looking bloke," Harry scratches his head, suddenly thoughtful, "Nothing to write home about. Although he does have a pretty decent color palette-"</p><p>"Merlin above, the blondes have got him wrapped around the ends of their silky pale hairs," Ron wails.</p><p>"Alright," Harry placates, "so maybe I'm a little partial to blondes."</p><p>There's a collective gasp from a few ladies around him, and he clicks his tongue in irritation.</p><p>"And I DON'T LIKE EAVESDROPPERS," he says a fair bit louder before dropping his tone again, "but Malfoy? Ridiculous."</p><p>"Entirely too much penis on him, I presume," Hannah Abbot mentions, passing by once again.</p><p>"Hey!" Harry groans, "Also, yes."</p><p>"So I was thinking... we could get Malfoy to wear one of the shirts with the poofy sleeves!" Hermione calls out victoriously, "he's awfully skinny, and-"</p><p>"'Mione that's perfect!" Ron exclaims, his freckled face coming alive with the prospect of torturing his nemesis with the fruity garb of the Old, "invite the prat! Do it now!" Hermione glares at him, but she's gotten her way so she refrains from saying anything more. </p><p>Harry laughs at his friends' antics, and spares Malfoy another brief thought. Once a prominent figure in his life, albeit negative, and now completely disconnected. He wonders what it'll be like to interact with Malfoy without the crippling pressure of the war and the constant apprehension towards how he was about to compose his next 'yo momma' barb. Or punch Harry's face in. </p><p>"He's not as bad as he used to be," Harry says again, more to himself than to the others. </p><p>"Probably," his friends add in unison. </p><p>"Probably," Harry agrees with a sigh.</p>
