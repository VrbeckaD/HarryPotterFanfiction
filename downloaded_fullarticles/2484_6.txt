    <p align="justify">“May I take <em>ze</em> bouillabaisse?”</p>
<p align="justify">One of the French girls had walked up to them and Ron was fascinated, that much was obvious in his face. Harry did saw why as he looked closely at the beautiful blonde, who had this air to her that made it feel like she herself was magical somehow instead of a wielder of it.</p>
<p align="justify">“<em>Bien sûr mademoiselle</em>” Hermione responded in French as she gestured for the dish and in the French girl’s face a smile appeared in an instant, all the while Harry looked puzzled at Hermione given his friend had never mentioned taking classes of that language or speaking it whatsoever.</p>
<p align="justify">“<em>Vous parlez français?</em>” Harry knew next to nothing of French but he figured out the Beaubaxtons student had asked Hermione if she could speak French, knowing at least the word ‘Français’ from all the movies he’d watched; what stood out more to him was the way she had asked, more surprise than actual question and how pleasantly surprised the French Witch looked at Hermione.</p>
<p align="justify">“<em>Une petite peu, je ne le parle pas beaucoup</em>” Hermione paused and gesticulated with her hands as she spoke, seemingly picking her words “<em>Je… ne l’ai personne pour… avec qui le pratiquer, mais je comprends</em>” Hermione giggled nervously as she went on “<em>J’espère vous me le comprendre</em>” Hermione seemed to have answered like she had been stuttering her way through it but Harry didn’t really knew given he was blank as to what his friend had actually said but it must have been something the other girl found incredible because the Beaubaxtons student smiled fondly and offered her hand to Hermione.</p>
<p align="justify">“<em>Vous avez un plutôt bon accent! Je m’appelle Fleur, enchantée</em>” Hermione smiled and shook the offered hand.</p>
<p align="justify">“<em>Moi aussi. Mon nom est Hermione</em>” Hermione spoke again and Harry had never seen Hermione smile like she was smiling at the French Witch. It was indescribable in its shape but the nature of it struck Harry as that one gives to someone they’re nervous but excited to meet.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry figured out they had just introduced each other by the handshaking; Enchantey seemed nice and looked quite dashing in her blue uniform but it struck him quite odd that the handshake lasted for far longer than it had to.</p>
<p align="justify">“Oi, what’s going on?” Ron barged in, speaking around a mouthful of food, and Fleur’s eyebrows shot up into her hair while her face twisted in disgust.</p>
<p align="justify">“<em>Il ne peut pas s’empêcher de se mêler de ce qui ne le regarde pas?</em>” Enchantey asked something and Hermione shook her head from side to side while Fleur stared at Ron as if he was some disgusting creature from a nightmare that made her want to vomit rather than be scared.</p>
<p align="justify">“This is Fleur-” Hermione signaled at Fleur with a smooth hand gesture, making Harry feel a little silly as he changed the mental tag of her face from Enchantey to Fleur and noted that Hermione was a bit more relaxed but still seemed to be picking her words as she switched back to French “<em>Fleur, voilà mes amis: Harry and Ron</em>”</p>
<p align="justify">Harry waved as he heard his name while Ron’s face twisted in confusion as he heard his own.</p>
<p align="justify">“Making new friends?” Ron asked between mouthfuls and the glare of disgust Fleur shot him made Harry giggle as Ron seemed oblivious to the woman’s barely contained disgust.</p>
<p align="justify">“<em>Il y a mieux en terme “d’ami”, ‘Ermione</em>” Fleur said something dryly while looking at Ron with that twisted expression in her face and Hermione nodded in agreement; the exact thing the elegantly dressed witch had said was a mystery that made Harry start to feel left out of the conversation a bit, but then something clicked in Fleur’s mind and with an astonished face she spoke up once more.</p>
<p align="justify">“<em>Est-ce lui Le Survivant?</em>” Fleur pointed at him while looking at his forehead and Hermione nodded. The Beaubaxtons witch seemed intrigued but let down in some manner, as if she was looking at something for the first time after hearing so much about it. Harry guessed that something was himself and he felt a bit dumbstruck that his fame had reached France.</p>
<p align="justify">“<em>Oui. Mais ici il est juste Harry. </em><em>Je dois admettre : je le suis surprise vous ne appelez pas Harry “le garçon qui vit</em>” Hermione added something, the words ‘yes’, ‘Harry’ and ‘boy’ the only thing Harry could recognize. He hoped that it was that he wasn’t what Rita Skeeter painted him to be in her trash journalism.</p>
<p align="justify">“'<em>Le garçon qui a survécu' tu veux dire?</em>” Fleur retorted to whatever Hermione had said and the answer must’ve been something more than just simple talk given Hermione paled and her eyes went wide “<em>Ce n’est pas grave Hermione, le français est une langue compliquée</em>” Fleur waved as she smiled and whatever it had been, it seemed to have made Hermione a bit less rigid after whatever the first part of Fleur’s answer had been<strong> </strong>“<em>Mais </em><em>tu dois bien admettre que c’est un surnom bien trop long. </em><em>« Le Survivant » est beaucoup plus simple</em>”</p>
<p align="justify">Some other Beaubaxton girls called out for Fleur, the word ‘Fleur’ standing out clearly now that Harry knew what to look for. The French girl gave Hermione an apologetic smile, waved goodbye at Harry and ignored Ron completely.</p>
<p align="justify"> “<em>Je dois y aller”</em> Fleur grabbed the dish she’d asked for and gave Hermione a gentle smile while biting down on her lower lip “<em>A très bientôt!”</em></p>
<p align="justify">Hermione waved as Fleur walked away elegantly but quick and Ron looked even more puzzled than before.</p>
<p align="justify">“What was that about?” He asked with food overflowing from his mouth and Hermione seemed to have been dragged down from a particularly happy mood and dryly answered.</p>
<p align="justify">“Just small talk. Nothing you need to worry about”</p>
