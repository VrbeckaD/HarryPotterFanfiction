    <p>
  <span>The year was 2007. It had been almost ten years since the defeat of Lord Voldemort at the hands of the boy who lived, Harry Potter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was happily married now to his best friend’s sister, Ginny, and had been working as an auror since the events of the second Wizarding War. He had just welcomed his second son, Albus, almost a year before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>One thing that Ginny still hadn’t been able to tame out of him was his almost obscene generosity. He couldn’t help trying to share his good fortune and wealth with everyone he came across. He had bought his wife a stunningly beautiful house with as many expensive furnishings as he could. Each birthday of his 3 and a half year old son James had been celebrated in a most ostentatious style. And, of course, his wife was showered with gifts regularly simply for her existence. Harry was eager to continue the tradition of gifts with his second son, whose birthday would be in two days. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the first of March, (Ron’s birthday— He mustn’t forget that!) and winter still had not released its grip on the land. His breath rose in great plumes like peacock feathers and he shoved his hands deeper into the pockets of his auror robes, silently and wandlessly reinforcing the warming charm he had cast on his gloves. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can never get out of this blasted cold,” he muttered to himself, sniffing to keep his nose from completely running over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The late afternoon sun glinted on the cobblestone streets of Diagon Alley, reflecting off of the odd puddles from last night’s rain storm. Couldn’t it ever just be normal snow, he wondered? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Trying to ignore the cold, Harry continued walking briskly towards one particular end of the alley. He kept his focus on his black dragonhide boots, knowing that the jarring colors of the building he was headed towards would be plenty recognizable even in his peripheral vision.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There it was. Not two minutes later, he stood before a garish orange building that towered above the streets. Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he walked through the entrance, a new obnoxious bell rang, this one sounding like a goose had just fallen into a jar of jam. The walls were stuffed with joke materials and candies, but Harry knew that in the back of the store there sat the laboratory, where new inventions were being made— and special requests were crafted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wandered about for a moment, knowing that George would emerge from the back room at any moment. His eyes lingered on the nosebleed nougats— how George still stocked them after all the trouble they had gotten in the ginger's seventh year at Hogwarts, he would never know. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some new additions lined the walls, which would not be so astonishing if Harry had not been to the shop for months, but he visited weekly and knew that new products were the norm. George’s imagination could never be quelled, it was true. He spotted some new pasties and a five pound bag of gummy newt’s eyes. (Who in the world would ever be crazy enough to buy that many?)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he was pondering the existence of the newt’s eyes, George came barreling out of the back, smoke— or possibly steam, or maybe chemical gases— blooming out of the back room behind him like some kind of awesome cloak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Harrikins, you’re just in time!” The tall red headed man exclaimed. “Come, come, you have to see what I’ve got for you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anything particularly prankish for Ron?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The best. A broom blanket with a disillusionment charm worked into it. Call it the new invisibility cloak and I’ll sell scores! I figure you can right chop his heart out of his throat with it!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sounds perfect. What about for Albus?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll see,” George said, laughing as he pushed Harry through the steaming doorway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry coughed almost at once at the stinging masses of gray gas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please tell me this is non-toxic,” Harry wheezed, his eyes tearing up from irritation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm, I’m not really sure. I probably should’ve cast an impermeable spell on the cauldron on the workbench, shouldn’t I?” George mused, seemingly unphased by the potion smoke swirling around him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, that would’ve been a capital idea,” Harry muttered, wiping his eyes. “Snape would’ve been proud of you, what with standing over a cauldron like that mess for hours on end.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm.” George was lost in melancholic thought. He was well aware of how Harry’s perception of Snape had changed during that final battle for the better, but did not necessarily agree with Harry’s different opinions. However, George could appreciate the bravery that Snape showed in the end. Much like his own brother…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He picked up a cloth cube and stared at it. “Harry, do you ever think… Do you ever wish you could change it all?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Huh?” Harry said, rather startled by the question. “Change what all?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just mean… so many people died, Harry. What if you could change it? That’s all I’m asking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’d be nice, sure, but think of all the other things that might change,” Harry said. “You may not have had nephews who adore you if everything went the way we always wanted, after all. I think that through darkness comes light.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even if there’s forever a bit of that light that’s lost?” George sighed. “I’m sorry, that was a stupid question.” He glanced at his watch. “I’d better show you Albus’s present so that we aren’t late for dinner at the Burrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sounds good,” Harry said, though there was not much enthusiasm in his voice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The cloth cube that George had picked up glistened as if with an internal light. It shimmered all sorts of different colors, different it seemed on each side. “It’s got protection charms and soothing spells worked into it. The form makes sure it can easily be transfigured into some other shape. I’ve worked some very complex spells into the fabric that ensures the enchantments remain stable no matter the form, and I think I could’ve maybe discovered a new type of textile in the process.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You would, wouldn’t you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” George grinned halfheartedly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took 20 minutes, but with a few spells the back room was cleared of fumes, each of the current projects were put into stasis, and the two brothers-in-law were able to close the shop just in time to apparate to Ron’s birthday party with gifts wrapped in animated wrapping paper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They popped into the Burrow’s living room— which, thanks to some spell stabilizing rune work Harry had purchased, was slightly larger. It did, in fact, grow each year, but hardly enough to be noticed in a day. Molly had her suspicions, but she was probably the only one of the family who hadn't been told outright. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Arthur levitated several full dishes onto the table before greeting them gently. "Oh, hello George, hello Harry."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“George, Harry! Sit down, the both of you,” Molly said with a genial smile as she sat a pot of steaming tomato soup down on the table. They smiled at the couple in return and sat down at the positively massive dining room table (which had of course been transfigured to be much larger than it had been once. It had to be, to support sixteen children, children-in-law, and grandchildren (because of course Teddy counted as a grandchild— you may fight Molly Weasley on that point, but I don’t plan to)). </span>
</p><p>
  <span>George wingardiumed the gifts to the center of one segment of the table where a heap of other colorfully wrapped boxes and items sat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The green flames of the floo flared up and Ginny came through holding a sleeping Albus and the hand of a bouncing James with Teddy stepping through close behind. Harry arose to take Albus from her and greet her with a kiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny handed over her younger son gently and pecked her husband back. “You couldn’t have stopped at home before coming over?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Got tied up in the back room at the Wizard Wheezes. If I was any later your mother would’ve skinned me alive. Lovingly, of course,” Harry said quietly, smiling. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mhm,” Ginny said, releasing James into the living room. “You were the first ones here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sue me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I might just.” She took her place at the table next to her husband. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Wotcher, Harry," the nine year old Teddy said, hugging his godfather.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oi, you just saw me this morning, no need to squeeze so tight," Harry wheezed from his godson's embrace, laughing. "Working on your body structure transformations some more, eh?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy laughed and went to sit down, his mischievous, ever changing eyes gleaming with mischief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The floo flashed again with the light of Ron and Hermione and their one-year-old daughter, Rose.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good evening, Molly, Ginny, Harry,” Hermione said politely, lifting her daughter up higher on one hip. Her bushy hair was pulled back in a knot that passed as professional in the DMLE where she worked as an arbiter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hallo, everyone,” said Ron, plopping down in a seat. “Got me a little something, have you?” He inquired, reaching towards the pile of presents. Hermione whacked his hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Save it until after dinner, Ron.”</span>
</p><p><span>“Yes, ma’am,” he said,</span> <span>jerking his hand back.</span></p><p>
  <span>Charlie clattered down the twisting stairs in the corner. “Oi, what’s all the racket?” He called blearily, wiping the sleep from his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You call that a racket? And I thought you worked with dragons," Ron said, standing to meet his elder brother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"A baby hungarian horntail is quieter than you lot," Charlie groused, hugging Ron.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good to see you," Ron said, sitting back down. "Hey mum, when are we expecting Bill and Percy?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Soon enough, I'm sure," Hermione answered her husband.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"They'll be here within the next fifteen minutes, don't you worry." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Awe we gonna see Victwawe?" James piped up from by a potted plant that was belching multicolored bubbles. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course we are, dear," Molly replied, sending a bolt of magic towards a bowl of custard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Floo burst up again, allowing Bill, Fleur, Victoire, and Dominique to step into the living room. The green light reflected softly on the blonde tresses of the girls and their mother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, Bill, you're here. Good." Molly let the platter of ham to descend carefully onto the table as she went over to greet her eldest son. "Percy should be here soon, and then we can begin to eat."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Perfect Percy strikes again, disciplining my stomach," Ron laughed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A double pop split the air in the living room and Percy appeared with a young woman beside him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oy, Percy, who's the girl?" Ron asked, side leaning better than Captain Kirk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He earned a smack on the shoulder from Hermione.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good afternoon to you too, Ron," Percy said, pulling a seat out for the young lady. "Mother, this is Audrey," he said, purposely ignoring his youngest brother now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well good for you Perce, it's certainly taken long enough," Ron snickered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And you said your family wasn't charming," Audrey eyes crinkled mirthfully when she spoke to Percy, who was seating himself carefully. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why thank you, Lady Audrey," Ron said, bowing his head in a grandiose manner, only to jerk it up when a swift kick to the shin came from a direction specifically close to Percy's chair. A glare followed closely from behind Percy's annoying horn-rimmed glasses.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Ahem," Molly cleared her throat. "If everyone is here, we can perhaps begin dinner?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sounds good to me, Mum," George piped up. He had been staring at the empty spot of wooden table in front of him for the last while. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well then, if everyone would sit down," Molly called to the few still standing family members, transfiguring an extra chair for herself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The family of redheads ordered themselves relatively quickly. Food and Molly's commanding voice had that effect on them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Many succulent dishes were served in both magic and mundane manners across the table onto the plates that had appeared on the wooden planks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"To Ron," said Arthur from the head of the table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"To Ron," came the voices of the adult Weasley clan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The young ones squirmed in their chairs and in their parents laps. "Sit still, James," Ginny hissed to her elder son.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Victoire was perhaps the only child old enough to understand the need to sit still save Teddy. Fleur was quite proud of her older daughter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The feast was magical as it always was. It may not have been as grand as the Hogwarts welcoming feast, but its hominess more than made up for it. Of course, knowing that food was made with love always made it taste and smell ten times better.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron wolfed down his first servings of food as quickly as he could, as if he hadn't even gotten a snack break that afternoon. (He had. His stomach just got more bottomless as he had matured. Twenty seven year old Ron had only slightly better impulse control than seventeen years old Ron had in more ways than one.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy tried to help James with his food but it wasn't going very well. Bill and Fluer's younger daughter must have pushed half her food onto the floor, with Victoire exclaiming that that wasn't how eating food worked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny and Hermione were both trying to feed Albus and Rose, with varying degrees of success. At some point they switched to see if one may have better luck than the other. They didn't. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Through the difficulty, the love parents have for their children was clearly evident, and laughter rang round the oddly shaped table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It must've taken an hour at least for the whole family to finish eating. (Audrey exclaimed several times on the "exceeding quality" of the food. If she and Percy ever had children, those children would be either very bored or very boring, Ron whispered to Hermione later that evening.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, however, they were ready for Ron to open his presents. He still loved them, even with the jumpers that he got with every heap of gifts. He was still rather a child at heart. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, alright, you can open your presents now,” Hermione said after Ron complained to her for the fifth time quietly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you love,” he said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mine first,” Bill said as he floated a package over to his younger brother. It was sparkly in red and yellow, his old house colors. It had small galleons illustrated over it. Ron eagerly ripped into it to reveal… a large, dusty tome. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Investing for Dummies?” He said, clearly unenthused.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...It was on sale at work,” Bill admitted before floating another similarly wrapped gift to Ron. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This one was spectacular: a magnificent wooden board game about treasure traps and such. It had three levels: desert, jungle, and cloud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cool,” Ron said. “We’re playing this after dinner,” he announced. There was no question about it. He pushed it to the side to allow Hermione to look at it. </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“Ooh, strategy,” she murmured. “I think Bill’s present might be the best.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I guess I can forgive him for the first one, then," Ron said as he reached for a parcel. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next gift was George’s. It was a box full of soft balls that seemed to glow with some sort of liquid in side. “When you get dirty on the job, just crack this on your uniform and it will clean it for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank goodness I don’t have to bother with the washing machine anymore,” Ron breathed dramatically. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like you have to in the first place,” Hermione said. She had insisted on the muggle convenience because sometimes she just didn’t want to focus on cleaning clothing with magic. It was kept running with a magical electric pump and the circuitry was protected with magic runes she herself had inscribed there with George’s help.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>George had been invaluable in more ways than one. With the help of the economic success of Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes, the Weasley family had finally become financially stable. George himself ran a grief counseling group which was originally for those who had lost loved ones in the two Wizarding Wars. The group had since expanded to all sorts of trauma, and a bowl of Mental Health Sweets was always available in each and every meeting. Beyond this, as a way of escaping his grief, George spent the majority of his time inventing. Whether he invented for the shop or for his family or for himself, he was always creating and changing the rules of how even basic things worked. He was a veritable genius. But he was rather alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had helped so many others to move on, yet he could not move on from his own grief. Not yet. Maybe not ever. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Deep inside that silly, stupid hope that he could fix everything with his creations one day stuck to him like glue, burrowed its way into him like a rose thorn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So far, not that much luck. Until that week. This week he had found something in an old book. Everyone knew Knockturn Alley was off limits as a child, but the darker offshoot of Diagon Alley held many treasures one could not find elsewhere. George sometimes would stroll through the alley looking for anything that piqued his curiosity, and the previous Sunday, something had. It was a book with all sorts of clock emblems emblazoned upon the cover. They would move if the light shone on them in just the right way. The inside was full of ancient runes and information on spell crafting and such, even on alchemy. But what was most interesting was that each piece of the book related, George had realized, to the mystery of time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Among the wizarding world, Time was one of five great Mysteries that was studied in the Department of Mysteries, below the British wizarding ministry. There, clocks and time turners and time magic were studied and picked apart and created. Time there was something that manipulated and yet was to be manipulated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>However, the greater public had little exposure to time magic. At most, certain exemplary students may have had access to a time turner in their days at Hogwarts, but they were all warned to keep the whole thing very hush-hush. Near the end of the war, all the time turners save two had been destroyed. However, as happened frequently with the darker offshoots of bureaucracy such as the Unspeakables, time magic was once again studied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>George felt that he was, however, on unexplored terrain. He wasn’t sure where his studies would bring him, but he knew one thing. He had a plan that would utterly change everything. It all relied upon the new information he had gleaned and on his trust in his own blazing, inventing spirit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>George shook himself back to attention, watching as the rest of the presents filed through Ron’s eager grasp. He had already gotten to the jumper. Already? Goodness how time flew. He resisted the urge to laugh at his own inside joke. Harry’s gift of the disappearing broom blanket with its time-released disillusionment charm was up next. Ron draped it over his arm and carressed it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...Really nice, Harry. Where’d you get it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, that’s a trade secret Ron. You know what they say about Magicians.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, they say a lot of things about magicians, and if you think about it, we’re literally all magicians.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I never reveal my trade secrets,” Harry said, bursting at the seams with laughter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re in the same trade! Just tell me!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No-ho-ho! Keep opening your presents!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron glared at Harry, who was running his hand through his messy black hair as he tried to calm his laughter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe there were good things to how his life was </span>
  <em>
    <span>now,</span>
  </em>
  <span> but the pain of losing his closest friend, his twin, was too much sometimes. He’d tried focussing on the good, focussing on the new, focusing on the wildest of magical failures. He’d helped a lot of people in a lot of different ways, but what good was that if he couldn’t help himself? Maybe someday he’d know. Or maybe someday he’d change things.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was, after all, what he really wanted to do. Wasn’t it? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>George didn’t spend much time talking during the rest of the party. The most times he was fully engaged was when he was playing with various nieces and nephews. That was his favorite part. It surprised him a bit, he’d mostly tormented Ron and Ginny when they were younger. Never mind the part where he and Fred had scarred Ron for life when it came to spiders. But here with these young children he felt the most at peace as he ever did. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James came over and sat on his lap while Ron, Hermione, Harry, Ginny, Bill, and Audrey all played the new board game in a ridiculously competitive fashion. It made George smile to know that despite all the time and changes the family had endured, they still remained the same at heart. </span>
