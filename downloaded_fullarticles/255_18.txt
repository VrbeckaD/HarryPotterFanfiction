    <p>Percival’s late.</p><p>
  <em> Again. </em>
</p><p>Newt doesn't bother with a warming charm for dinner. Percival can heat it himself when he gets home. Honestly, at this point, Newt wouldn't be surprised if Percival didn't show at all. It wouldn't be the first time he’s <em> forgotten </em> to let Newt know that he’ll be late at work.</p><p>“Should Wendi be popping by Mr. Graves’s office?” The tiny house elf appears next to him. There’s a note of sympathy in her voice that wasn’t always there in their relationship. Newt suspects she didn’t find him fit enough to join the family she’d served for so long but as Percival’s begun spending more and more time away from them both, he senses a thaw forming in the wall between them.</p><p>“No need, Wendi. I’m sure he’ll wander home when he feels like it. We shouldn’t disturb him while he’s at work. The <em> Director </em> has more important things to do than be home in time for dinner.”</p><p>They’re coming up on six years of marriage if that’s what you want to call it. They married when Newt was 19, still reeling from his expulsion from Hogwarts and the subsequent damage to his parent’s reputation. It was a lucky match, a godsend for his family really and Newt couldn’t bear to disappoint them again. Between Newt’s marriage into such a prominent American family and his brother’s meteoric rise through the Ministry's ranks, the Scamander family was gradually regaining its clout.</p><p>So, he stood still and smiled, kissed his new husband, packed his meager bags, and moved his life to New York. He took a position working at the local university as a Magizoology professor and tried his best to settle into married life.</p><p>If that’s what you call this. Even living in the same house, he and Percival have never been close. They share each other's space and sometimes talk about their work, but, nevertheless, exist more as begrudging roommates than as spouses. Newt knows his parents are worried. A divorce would be even more embarrassing than his expulsion and he knows their lack of children is starting to look a certain way. He hears the whispers when he ventures home. <em> Infertile. Affair. </em></p><p>When Percival doesn’t come home at all that first night, Newt doesn’t worry. He's irritated but not worried. There have been plenty of occasions where Percival’s gotten himself too wrapped up in his work and spent the night in his office He normally chastises Newt for even asking.</p><p>
  <em> “I wasn’t aware I’d married my nanny,” Percival had chided him, “funny, you don't look like Mrs. Numburg. Shall I have my secretary forward you my itinerary so you know where I am at all times?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Excuse me for asking for some politeness.” </em>
</p><p>After the first two days, Newt is more than annoyed. Percival hasn’t responded to any of his missives. Not even with a dismissive chastisement. After three days, Newt's furious, his notes to Percival’s office returning without even being opened. After four days, he's concerned. After a full week, he's striding into MACUSA headquarters to file a missing person’s report. This is unacceptable, truly.</p><p>The Woolworth Building is massive and maze-like. How does anyone who works here get around, Newt wonders? He wanders for about 10 minutes before giving up and stopping in front of a random desk and the tired looking witch seated there.</p><p>“Excuse me,” he says, “I'm terribly lost and need to report my husband missing but I'm not sure what desk to do that at. It would be wonderful if things were labeled.”</p><p>“Name?” She says in a bored tone.</p><p>“Hm? Ah, Newton Scamander.”</p><p>“And your husband's name?”</p><p>“Percival Graves. I believe he normally works in this building. Perhaps someone’s already filed one? Or perhaps you can tell me if he’s gone on an investigation.”</p><p>The woman is openly gawking at him now, her eyes searching his face for any trace of humor.</p><p>“Are you-is this a joke?”</p><p>“No, I'm quite serious. He’s never been gone this long before,” Newt assures her. Why would he joke about something so sensitive? “He hasn’t been home in a week and I’m highly concerned.”</p><p>“Um, let me see what I can do, Mr. Scamander.” She hurries to her feet and leaves him standing there. Newt waits for almost thirty minutes. He tries to resist the urge to pace but being in a place as crowded as the Woolworth building sets his teeth on edge. He longs for his tiny office at the university and the creatures therein.</p><p>“Mr. Scamander, I found him!” He hears the witch call after what feels like an hour. There’s Percival, walking towards him in hurried strides. He looks fine, hair perfectly coiffed and no part of him visibly injured at all. He's dressed nicely like always in a well-tailored suit. The coat is new. As is that hideous scorpion pin. He stops in front of Newt, a wolfish smile on his face.</p><p>“<em>Darling</em>,” he purrs and Newt knows instantly this is not his husband. His smile, his magic, his <em> eyes</em>. How could anyone mistake this man for Percival Graves? He and Percival may not be close but he’d never describe his husband as cold. This man, however, he radiates a coldness, a <em> cruelty</em>. He keeps his face impassive as the imposter leans in to kiss his cheek.</p><p>Newt’s Percival has kissed him exactly once. A chaste thing in the middle of a chapel in front of their families. Newt has never asked for more.</p><p>“You didn't say you were visiting. We could have met for lunch instead,” The man wearing Percival’s face says. Newt refuses to meet his searching gaze and wonders if the real Percival is already dead.</p><p>“You haven't been home in a few days. I was worried,” He quietly says instead.</p><p>“Ah yes. The caseload has been heavy. Quite a few dark wizards running amuck,” Not-Percival says, “I’ve been sleeping in the office so as not to disturb you.”</p><p>Newts grants him a small smile as he reaches into his pocket for his wand. This simply can’t go on. They've attracted a small crowd of people, all anxious to meet their boss’s mysterious spouse.</p><p>“<em>Revelio</em>,” Newt whispers and chaos breaks out. Percival’s face melts away to reveal a furious Gellert Grindelwald and Newt is sure Percival is dead.</p><p>“You'll have to excuse the confusion,” he laughs, his voice sickeningly hollow, “dear Percy never mentioned you. I wasn't at all prepared to meet the <em> wife</em>. A shame. I would’ve loved to shack up with one as pretty as you.”</p><p>Newt wants to kill him.</p><p>--</p><p>They find Percival in his office of all places after a lengthy search. He was stuffed into an antique teapot on the highest shelf. It was a difficult curse, they tell him, but they managed to break it.</p><p>Percival about looks as bad as Newt’s ever seen him. He's been cut up before but never like this. He's bruised all over and thinner than a twig. Grindelwald must have been starving him. The mediwitch looks up when Newt walks in and conjures a seat for him.</p><p>“He's resting now. We're healing what we can and preparing his body to do the rest. We'll have him back in working order soon, Mr. Graves. I’m sure you want to get him home.” Newt doesn't correct her, just nods and sits down next to the bed to wait.</p><p>Employees shuffle in and out always looking at Newt like he's some sort of freak of nature. They can’t believe he exists, they say. Percival’s <em> married </em> ? And how in the world did he land an <em> Omega </em>?</p><p>“I never knew he was married,” one Omegan woman whispers to him, “I feel like I should apologize for trying to poach your man.”</p><p><em> She still could </em> , Newt thinks to himself. She's pretty, a delicate omega he's sure Percival’s parents would have preferred. He pictures his husband, flirting with women at work. Keeping them company on those long nights he's away on <em> business </em>.</p><p>He tries not to feel bitter about it. Theirs is a marriage of convenience after all. He gets to his feet and decides to head back to the university. Percival’s safe. Moping will do him no good. Percival probably wouldn’t appreciate him lurking.</p><p>Newt’s taking a nap at home when he gets word that Percival’s finally awake. He dresses quickly and apparates back to the Woolworth building. When he reaches the medical ward, he sees that Percival is sitting up on his own, whispering quietly to the woman to which Newt reported him missing all those days ago. Goldstein, his mind supplies. She’d looked so shocked to see him that day. She's awfully pretty and uncomfortably comfortable in Percival’s space in a way Newt doesn’t think he’ll ever be.</p><p>They both look up when Newt walks in, the woman quietly shuffling away. She nods to Newt on her way out but doesn’t speak. He tries not to be offended as he turns to face his husband.</p><p>“Percival,” He says quietly.</p><p>“Newt,” Percival replies. His left arm is still in a sling but the bruise on his cheek has finally started to yellow. Overall he does look better. He’s alive at least and frankly, that’s more than Newt hoped for.</p><p>“It's really quite rude not to tell me when you're going to be late. Wendi puts quite a bit of work into a place setting for you,” Newt finally says, his tone placid. He settles into the seat next to Percival’s bed and crosses his legs.</p><p>“Yes. You've said so before.” Percival watches him with careful eyes. He keeps his tone measured like he doesn’t know where Newt’s headed.</p><p>“I assume it won't happen again?”</p><p>Percival grants him a rueful smile. “No. It won't,” he says.</p><p>He carefully avoids focusing on Percival’s shaking hands and instead says, “I'm glad you're safe,” in a quiet voice.</p><p>Percival lets out an exhausted sigh. <em> He looks so much older, </em>Newt thinks to himself. He’s always found Percival quite handsome, never looking quite his age but today, today Newt sees every one of those years bearing down on him.</p><p>“It's my understanding that that's thanks to you,” Percival says. “My being safe and all.”</p><p>“I should have come in sooner. The day after you didn’t come home.”</p><p>“Why would you?” Percival snorts. Why would he indeed? Percival’s never invited him into his workspace. His worries have always been met with annoyance or irritation.</p><p>“Well, in any case, I'm glad you're alright.” Newt tries to shake the<em> what if </em> ’s from his mind. Percival is fine and Grindelwald’s headed to prison. It could have been so much worse but it <em> isn’t </em>.</p><p>“I'm alive.” Percival tries to shrug and winces as he leans back into his pillows. “I’ll be glad when I finally get to return home.”</p><p>“Director Graves?” A mediwitch pokes her head in between the curtains separating them from the rest of the ward. “If you’re up to it, the President is here to debrief you.”</p><p>Percival goes stiff as a board.</p><p>“Yes, of course, send her in immediately.” Newt wonders if he should leave. Madam Seraphina Picquery strides into the little makeshift room, the picture of grace.</p><p>“Director Graves,” she greets him, “you’re looking better.”</p><p>“Thank you, ma’am.”</p><p>“And feeling better?”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>“Good. It's our understanding that Grindelwald impersonated you for at least one full week. We're not sure what he managed to accomplish in that time but we're investigating. As soon as you're up to it, we'd like you back in action to mitigate the damage, Director.” President Seraphina Picquery is even more intimidating in person. She doesn’t spare Newt so much as a glance.</p><p>“As soon as I’m back on my feet I’ll be back in the office Madam President,” Percival assures her. Newt wants to protest but knows it’s not his place. He bites his tongue and instead studies the bestiary he’s brought with him even more closely.</p><p>“That’s good to hear, Percival. MACUSA stands behind you and all of us are wishing you,” her eyes cut to Newt, “and your family the best. If you find yourself in need of anything, please don’t hesitate to ask.”</p><p>Percival thanks her again and she takes her leave.</p><p>“Mr. Graves and...Mr. Graves,” The mediwitch pokes her head back in, “I have some instructions for your home care.”</p><p>She hands Newt a regimen of potions as well as instructions to return in the next few days to monitor Percival’s progress. Newt accepts the directions with as level a head as he can muster. There’ve been so many people in and out, all with eyes judging him. What are they thinking, he wonders. Is he fit to be Percival’s spouse? He's never been exactly desirable. Shoulders too wide, hips too narrow. He was far too tall for any Alpha’s attention. Even with his marriage to Percival, it wasn’t like the older man was attracted to him.</p><p>“Shall we head home then?” Percival’s voice penetrates his reverie.</p><p>“Yes of course. I’m sure your parents are anxious to hear from you. It’s all over the papers and I haven’t had much time to respond to letters.”</p><p>“Wonderful.” Percival begrudgingly accepts Newt’s help getting himself up out of the hospital bed.</p><p>“Let’s get you home,” Newt says softly. Percival’s recovery will take time, he knows, but Newt is determined to offer as much support as he’ll allow.</p><p> </p>
