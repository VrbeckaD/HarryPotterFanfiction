    <p>Arthur wondered how he managed to get himself into this situation. Then he remembered that Scotland was a twat and was bound to get revenge for the gender-switching spell he had performed on him a few years back. When he asked for a vacation in return for Scotland sending him somewhere in his land for taking over his responsibilities for a while, he hadn't expected the git to send him to teach.</p><p>"Excuse me, my dear boy, are you Arthur Kirkland?" At the sound of the voice, the personification of England looked up into the eyes of one of the most talented wizards of the century, Albus-too-many-bloody-middle-names-Dumbledore.</p><p>"Yes I am." Arthur didn't like that twinkle that entered the old wizard at his confirmation. Dumbledore gestured for him to sit, so he lowered himself slowly into a seat across him.</p><p>"I understand that you wish to apply for the position of..." The Headmaster paused as he peered at the sheet of parchment in his hands. "Professor for the History of Magic." He sounded very surprised by this.</p><p>Arthur straightened up in his seat and nodded. "Precisely. I have been informed that the current teacher for this particular subject is no longer...of this world and is not able to properly teach their students everything they need to know." </p><p>Dumbledore looked at him with a strange look. "Yes, Professor Binns does seem to have a fixation on Goblin Wars. May I ask how you came across this information?"</p><p>'Shoot. Quick England, think! What do I say?' Arthur flailed mentally for a second before latching onto an idea. </p><p>"Ah yes, I attended Hogwarts myself as a child. Professor Binns hardly taught anything! All he was good for was putting children to sleep." From what Scotland had told him, that much sounded true. He hoped the other man would buy into it. He doubted if the wizard looked into the records, he would find any mention of an Arthur Kirkland attending Hogwarts at any point in time.</p><p>Dumbledore looked through his parchment and then back up again. "Well, Mr.Kirkland it seems that you have all the requirements needed to join our staff except for one."</p><p>Arthur froze. 'What now?' "Sir, what exactly am I missing?" </p><p>Albus Dumbledore-the wanker- smiled. "Since History of Magic has been taught by Professor Binns for many decades, the new Professor must have an assistant Professor which must help them."</p><p>Goddammit.</p><p>-This time skip is brought to you by twinkly eyes of a certain Headmaster I shall not name-</p><p>The staff of Hogwarts were seated in the staff room, a few days before the start of the new term. The upcoming arrival of two new professors was a popular topic, as many speculated about what they must be like to finally be able to convince the eccentric Headmaster to hire them in place of Binns. The room went a little quiet when Professor Snape and McGonagall enter the room, followed by said Headmaster. The two professors took a seat and Dumbledore went to sit at the head of the table. He starts the meeting by the clapping his hands together and gazing upon them cheerfully.</p><p>"Alas, another school year is upon us. This year however, we have three new Professors for Defense Against the Dark Arts-we always seem to lose them, goodness knows why-as well as a previously post that was held for many decades by one individual, History of Magic." Albus paused as murmurs spread through the table. The last time a new History of Magic professor, let alone two, was ages ago. He waited for a while longer before clearing his throat, causing the room to fall silent. </p><p>"Headmaster, if I may ask, what happened to Professor Binns?" Professor Sprout inquired. </p><p>Dumbledore's eyes started to twinkle, and an 'oh dear now what?' crossed the minds of the two professors who knew him best. Those two professors being Snape and McGonagall of course. </p><p>"I am very pleased to announce that our new History of Magic professors shall be-" Dumbledore was cut off as the door to the staff room slammed open. Many of the professors jumped to their feet and took out their wands and pointed it at the door, but Dumbledore remained seated with a smile on his face. </p><p>At the door was a blonde man with blue eyes and a large grin plastered on his face, looking at the room with an curious glance. He turned to look over his shoulder and said to someone they couldn't see as they were covered by the blonde's larger build. "Hey Artie, when you said magic school, I was expecting people with green skin and cauldrons cackling. Not a bunch of people in dresses sitting around a table."</p><p>The blonde had a very distinct American accent that sounded strange compared to the British accents that filled the room a few minutes ago. The person that they spoke to entered the room after nudging the American to move so he could pass. They could hear a sharp "Don't call me that!" before the second person walked in the staff room.</p><p>The second person was also a blonde, however their hair had a slightly paler tinge to it, and green eyes that pierced through you- and goodness are those supposed to be eyebrows?</p><p>The One With the Larger Eyebrows spoke first. "Hello. My name is Arthur Kirkland and I am one of the new History of Magic professors. Pleased to meet you all." He had a strong London accent, which was obviously less foreign than the blonde American at his side who entered as well. Said blonde American grinned at the gazes pinned on him as he spoke. </p><p>"Hey dudes! I'm gonna be help teach History of Magic here, cause apparently you guys had some," He shuddered. "ghost teach kids, which is totally not cool!" Arthur scowled. </p><p>'There goes our chance to impress our colleagues.'</p><p>They didn't seem very convinced. Arthur heard someone comment quietly- not quiet enough though as he still heard it- on how young they were. Which was true from their perspective. Compared to the other professors who had years of teaching experience at the school, Arthur and Alfred's physical ages of 23 and 20 respectively seemed too young for them to be working at the prestigious school. </p><p>Dumbledore smiled at them. "Take a seat. We had just started the Meeting." He paused as Arthur sat in a chair beside Professor McGonagall and Alfred threw himself into a chair beside Professor Snape. The professors who had jumped to their feet also sat down with confused looks on their faces. He continued. </p><p>"We hold meetings at the end of every month to see how the school year has progressed. I called you here before the term so you two meet your fellow peers and become adjusted to life at Hogwarts." He gestured towards Professor McGonagall. </p><p>"This is Professor Minerva McGonagall. She is the Deputy Headmistress, teaches Transfiguration, and is the Head of the Gryffindor House, it is where students that are brave and chivalrous go." He explained at Alfred's look. Professor McGonagall nodded at them. </p><p>("Dude what's this brave house about? Is it like Wampus?")</p><p>("Yes it is, now pay attention. He'll explain everything.")</p><p>"This is Professor Filius Flitwick. He is the Charms Professor and the Head of the Ravenclaw House, where the knowledgeable and those who seek knowledge go." He gestured to the part-goblin who peered at them past his glasses with a smile.</p><p>"This is Professor Pompona Sprout. She is the Herbology Professor as well as the Head of the Hufflepuff House, where the hardworking and loyal student are placed." She greeted them with a smile as well. </p><p>Lastly, he gestured to a man with a hooked nose, greasy black hair, and a scowl. "This is Professor Severus Snape. He teaches Potions here at Hogwarts and is the Head of the Slytherin House, which values cunning and slyness." </p><p>Professor Snape glared at Alfred who grinned at him and then peered at Arthur who gave him an unimpressed look.</p><p>Dumbledore continued to introduce them to the rest of the people in the room, all of which gave them a nicer first impression, except for Filch. </p><p>Dumbledore looked at them. "Do you have any questions or comments?"</p><p>There was a slight pause before Alfred spoke. </p><p>"Dude, you're old." </p><p>The others didn't seem to like his opinion. Murmurs flew through the room. </p><p>("Who does he think he is, insulting the Headmaster like that?")</p><p>Dumbledore, on the other hand didn't seem to mind as much and chuckled. "Yes, compared to one such as yourself I am, as you put it, old."</p><p>He adjusted his glasses and leaned forward. "I have arranged a living quarters for you both. I shall have Severus," He gestured towards Snape who had his usual glare. "show you to your room." </p><p>'Wait what?' Arthur blinked. That implied...</p><p>"Excuse me, but aren't there separate quarters for the two of us?" Arthur finally spoke up.</p><p>A single living quarters meant that there was only one room, meaning he'd need to share the room with Alfred, as well as the living area, kitchen and bathroom. </p><p>Dumbledore looked apologetic. "I'm afraid that there is only one room set aside for each Professor, and seeing as there is only supposed to be one professor per subject, there are not any other available. If it's too much of a problem, we could figure something out."</p><p>Before Arthur could reply, Alfred swung an arm around his shoulder. "Don't worry dude, we'll be fine! Artie and I've bunked together before so we're good." </p><p>Arthur didn't know which was worse. The nickname, saying that they've stayed together in one living space before, or actually having to do so now. So instead he knocked his elbow into Alfred's side, electing a huff from the American, before replying. </p><p>"We'll be fine."</p>
