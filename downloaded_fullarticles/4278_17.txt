    <p>He didn’t really remember how he got there, he didn’t really want to remember anything. Somewhere in the back of his mind, the part that was still operating despite the blood and shredded limbs that seemed to overwhelm his senses, he knew he was at Hogwarts. His body sat trembling in the headmaster’s office, his mind lost in a blurred mess of unwanted memories that he was already suppressing.</p>
<p>It was the smell he had noticed first, as he stepped over the threshold of the house he had reluctantly called home. The house had never smelt good, with the lingering notes of mould and damp a constant of his childhood, but that scent had been almost overpowering in its unpleasant intensity. He had never smelt anything quite like it before, and he hoped beyond all rationality that he never would again. He wondered if he would ever be able to cleanse himself of the smell, it seemed to cling to him, making him desperate to agree to escape the office and scour himself with scalding water. To burn his clothes, to exorcise himself of everything. Yet at the same time his whole body felt heavy, as if to move was an effort far beyond his capabilities, his mind stagnant and incapable of action. </p>
<p>The house had been unnervingly silent, gapingly empty until he had noticed the blood. And after that, he hadn’t been able to see anything else. He could see it now, blood and chunks of flesh. The positions. The pieces. The image was distorted and yet still burnt into his brain. He had been aware, vaguely, of a man speaking to him, a hand on his shoulder, but nothing had really existed in that moment. The world had stopped, and ended, and somehow it had restarted but with everything changed. Even now he had little idea of what was real, the physical certainty of Dumbledore’s blue eyes seeming impossibly distant from across the desk, the warm drink he had been almost forcefully given had barely had a taste. The drink had melted its way down him, melting his insides, and he hadn’t even registered what it was or what it could be. He had just obediently drunk it, trusting without consciously trusting, as if all animation had been sucked out of him.</p>
<p>Severus put up no resistance, the words he was hearing slipping out of his brain like wet sand, thudding to the floor. He couldn’t understand anything, all comprehension was gone. He nodded, passively, allowing Dumbledore to manoeuvre his body firmly. He had no idea what he was being told, what he was agreeing to. All he knew was that he felt like he had died, been twisted and torn into a million pieces, shattered and regurgitated out onto the stone floor. A life time could have passed in that state, as Severus was guided by an unyielding hand to the bathrooms, where finally his clothes were unceremoniously stripped from him. He let Dumbledore slather him liberally with overwhelmingly perfumed soaps, purging him of any traces of what had been left of who he had been but a few hours ago. Through their smell he could still smell the lingering scents of the house clinging to his skin and hair. A few hours ago he had been confident and assured, a boy heading home for the summer. Now he was only feebly holding on to reality, drifting in and out of conscious awareness in a rolling, titling, disorientating manner. Everything fractured and shattered inside his mind, as if he might never be repaired, and even if he were the cracks would never fade.</p>
<p>Gentle fingers washed away all that was left of him, uncompromising in their intent, cleaning him of his past. Dirt and soap mixed with the water, steaming and washed down the drain, taking with it the shields of his identity. The water dripped like the blood had dripped, pooling and spilling. He could have been drowned in the waters without noticing, everything numbed and sponged out of existence. His hair was washed, purged of all traces of grease, shampoo massaged into his scalp as if attempting to penetrate his skull. Everything was rinsed away, leaving him feeling like merely an empty shell of the demon he had once been, exorcised away.</p>
<p>He gave no objection when Dumbledore dried him off, and none when he dressed him, the shock still gripping him uncompromisingly. Vaguely, somewhere deep inside, a part of him expressed confusion, but it was like thinking through quicksand, the harder he tried to think the further in he sunk. The frilly bloomers were first, white and lacy. Severus stared vacantly at them, and his thin legs emerging from underneath as if they belonged to someone else. The dress was harder, carefully wrapped around Severus’s floppy limbs. The frilled bell skirt came down past his knees, ending in a cascade of white lace, decorated with red bows and a cute strawberry pattern. The sleeves too ended in wide white lace and red bows, as well as gracing his neck.</p>
<p>He sat on the chair in the dress as Dumbledore fussed around with his hair. No one had ever had anything much to do with his hair, and a small part of him found it strangely pleasant to have someone stroke through it. Dumbledore was twisting it round and round, while he muttered away to himself, as Severus remained blank faced and silent.</p>
<p>“Severine,”</p>
<p>“Severine,”</p>
<p>“Severine,”</p>
<p>Severus had no idea how long Dumbledore had been calling him, how long his hair had been dried and set in what he vaguely realised were ringlets. He blinked, his mind still feeling like it belonged to someone else, as foreign to him as the curls that fell around his face. His name wasn’t Severine, it was Severus. At least he had thought so, but now it hurt to think. He looked down at his hands, clasped on the strawberry print fabric in his lap.</p>
<p>“Severine,” Dumbledore repeated, “If you want to have any chance of survival you must never let your secret be revealed. I can only do so much to protect you. I have arranged for you to stay with the Potters, they’ve always wanted a daughter. They will keep you safe, but if you want our protection we expect obedience,”</p>
<p>Severus nodded, lips parted, the words trickling and echoing through his mind as if they were a foreign language he could barely speak. He tried to understand, but his head hurt when he thought. It felt as if his mouth was filled with cotton wool, muffling and choking him, soft and deadly. It was almost as if his brain had been smothered, his emotions drowned in treacle, dark and viscous, drowning him with sweetness. Dumbledore’s mutterings sank into his mind without passing through his consciousness, whispered reassurances or threats, it was all the same to him. </p>
<p>Another steaming mug found its way into his hands, and he loosely held it. It took more strength and concentration than it should have to not drop it on the cold stone floor, shattering and spilling piping hot liquid everywhere, but he clung on. The fumes stupefied him even more, soothing him as if he needed to relax further, when he felt as if he had already melted into a puddle of helpless goo smeared on the chair, oozing through the cracks of reality. He sipped, his tongue not burning as it should have done, as if pain no longer existed in his world.</p>
<p>Dumbledore continued his talking, his words going in circles that swirled around Severus without meaning. He seemed to be trying to impress something on Severus, instructions that needed constant repetition. The words girl and secret repeated themselves like a broken record, scratching and warping, blending in with obedience and death. Everything was drowned out by the echoing white noise inside his mind, yet at the same time Dumbledore’s words penetrated his soul without him having to know or understand. He nodded, again and again, like a doll with no will of its own.</p>
<p>The fire flared, the flickering light seeming further away than it should have been. Severus sipped his drink, aware that one time he would have wondered what it was. He didn’t wonder now, he just drank in silence. He didn’t question the clothes he was wearing or the woman who stepped from the fireplace. She and Dumbledore spoke openly in front of him, but he struggled to catch their words, struggled to understand them. It almost didn’t feel important. It was as if his mind had been silenced by the silence of the house at Spinner’s End, shredded to pieces like flesh from bone.</p>
<p>Severus sipped again at his drink, taking comfort in the way the warm liquid ran through him, killing all resistance with its smooth, soporific sweetness. He felt as if, somewhere in the dark recesses of his mind, he could identify the ingredients of the mixture, but the thoughts seemed to slip away from him, like minnows slipping through fingers, escaping to freedom far away. Leaving him empty. Leaving him null and void. </p>
<p>He almost didn’t notice when the woman knelt down beside him, concerned brown eyes looking softly into his. He gazed back at her blankly, some small remnant of himself finding there to be something familiar to her features, an abstract realisation that passed through his mind without note. She gently brushed his hair back from his face, his expression still a death mask lacking in all emotion and expression.</p>
<p>“Severine,” she spoke, her lips and the words not matching up in Severus’s perception. He wanted to wonder where that name had come from, why she was calling him Severine, just like Dumbledore, but he couldn’t. He didn’t understand, but still he recognised the meaning deep inside. He understood even as he didn’t understand. He obeyed unquestioningly as if he were enchanted. </p>
<p>“Severine,” she spoke again, “I’m Euphemia Potter, your new mother. I’m here to take you home,”</p>
<p>Her hair was grey, but the lines of her face were kind. Her fingers were gentle as they caressed the side of Severus’s face, a show of comfort no one had ever chosen to give him before. He wasn’t used to kind adults, but the thought of adults shattered through him like a poisonous barb, agony filling his mind. There was a shadowy hint of limbs dripping blood, a wave of a scent that wasn’t really in the room, a vision of something his subconscious was valiantly trying to have him unsee.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to talk about anything,” the woman continued, prattling on vaguely as if aware that Severus was only barely there, physically present but mentally long gone, “All I want is to take you home and take care of you. I’ve always dreamt of having a daughter and you’re such a pretty little girl. I’m sure having a sister will be good for James too,”</p>
<p>She didn’t appear to expect any kind of answer, not even being phased by the fact that Severus wasn’t even reacting. She seemed content to treat him like a life-size, living doll. Severus didn’t feel like he was entirely inside his own body, wrapped up in bows and frills. He felt rather that he was slightly outside of it, not entirely detached but only partially overlapping. Had Euphemia’s fingers switched from softly carding through his hair to grasping round his throat, pressing and strangling, he doubted he would have noticed. He had neither the strength nor the presence of mind to consider self-defence. Nothing felt real, not even his own body.</p>
<p>“You’ll want for nothing with us,” she said, her voice patient as she gently took Severus by the hand. She guided him from the chair, the now empty mug still held loosely in his hand. She took it from him, setting it aside and leading him to the fireplace, an arm protectively wrapping itself around his shoulder, the elegant robe draping over the white frills of his dress. His feet stepped forward one by one, white ankle socks in ruby red shoes making their way across the room. He saw them in the field of his vision, but they seemed to be attached to different legs.</p>
<p>As she reached for the floo powder, Dumbledore crouched by Severus, piercing blue eyes staring directly into glassy black ones. There was a promise and a threat in them that Severus was powerless to resist. The intensity of the gaze bypassed his brain, sinking deep into his soul. Words, which would have meant nothing to Severus anyway, were unnecessary. The floo flared, the world blurred and had he not been firmly grasped by Euphemia, he would have stumbled. </p>
<p>The house would not qualify as a house in Severus’s understanding, had he been capable of paying attention. It was too big, too grand, too old. It was more like a mansion, handed down for generations, with the secrets of the dead lurking in every corner. Even the fireplace seemed to scream of wealth, white marble kept immaculately clean of all traces of soot, ornately carved. The room seemed to spread out in all directions, but Euphemia steered his firmly from the fireplace across polished wooden floors. Down the corridors they went, Severus passively watching his red shoes on brilliant mahogany as if they belonged to someone else.</p>
<p>He was coaxed gently through the process of brushing his teeth, the toothbrush almost falling from his unfocused grasp. Euphemia fussed around him, a gentler version of Dumbledore. He stared blankly at his face in the bathroom mirror, barely recognising himself. His hair seemed longer than it should have been, curled ringlets falling to mid-chest. He had thought his hair was barely jaw length, but wondering about it made his head ache. He didn’t want to think, didn’t want to risk reawakening barely repressed memories. Didn’t want to question. </p>
<p>“You’re a pretty little girl, aren’t you,” Eupehima said as she stroked her hands through his hair. He put up no resistance, letting her do as she pleased. No one had ever called Severus pretty before. The only things ever said about his appearance tended to focus on his ugliness, his uncleanliness and his poor clothes. He almost felt tears pricking in the backs of his eyes, but crying seemed to be too much effort.</p>
<p>“There there,” Euphemia continued, seemingly aware that underneath all of the shock and numbness Severus felt some form of distress, no matter how dissociated he was from it, “We’ll look after you,”</p>
<p>Somewhere deep inside Severus desperately wanted to believe in her. All he wanted was to be looked after, to no longer have to think or feel. He’d always wanted an adult he could believe in unquestioningly, someone strong who could defend him. He relaxed in her presence, an uncharacteristic action, just like the clothes he wore were so alien to the boy he had been only that morning.</p>
<p>He would have let her undress him, but the memory of Dumbledore’s blue eyes held him fast. Somehow that expression broke through the apathy that gripped him, and for the first time since he had seen what he could not unsee he acted of his own volition, weak though it was. He took the white, frilled nightgown from Euphemia with feeble hands that nearly dropped it on the cold tiled floor.</p>
<p>“Oh you poor darling,” she murmured, looking heartbroken, “I’ll let you get changed in private,”</p>
<p>When she returned, he was standing where she had left him, still vacant. He was wearing the nightgown, the lace reaching down to his ankles, the clothes he had removed a pile on the floor. He almost wondered how much time had passed that day, how much time had passed since Dumbledore’s office, how much time had passed since the bathing, but his mind felt slow. Time felt too slow and too fast at the same time. He could have been wearing the dress for minutes or days, he had no way of knowing, just the vague comprehension that now it lay heaped and abandoned. </p>
<p>Euphemia took him by the hand and led him from the bathroom. He followed listlessly, his hand limp in hers. Normally he would have looked around the room, taken in all the details of his surroundings, but his eyes seemed incapable of transferring the data to his brain. Everything seemed a dull blur. The bed he got into without question, lying down silently. Euphemia sat down besides him, and gently placed a lilac unicorn soft toy in his arms, encouraging him to hug it. He did so, clutching the cuddly toy to his chest. It was the first time he had done so since his father had burnt his sole childhood soft toy, because he’d accidentally used magic on it. The unicorn smelt of lavender and comfort, a gentle wave of relaxation pouring over him, helping to blot out the memories of the house he had been supposed to sleep in that night. </p>
<p>He was afraid to close his eyes, but he was also too exhausted to move. Behind his eyelids lurked memories, even if they seemed faded and sepia toned now. Euphemia continued stroking his hair, kind and reassuring. She murmured sweet nothings, a constant stream of reassurances that he was safe now, that he was a pretty little girl, that everything would be alright. Almost unintentionally, he drifted off to sleep to the sound of her whispers.</p>
