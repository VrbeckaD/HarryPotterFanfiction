  <em>~~Hey. I was doing just fine before I met you. Drank too much and that's an issue but I'm ok.~~</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Light was peeking in through the drapes and vaguely Draco heard someone open his door. He turned away and groaned miserably before he reached out and grabbed a bottle only to realise he had finished it. </p><p> </p><p>Great. Now I haven't got anything to stop to fucking hangover before dealing with being alive again, he thought over his pounding head. </p><p> </p><p>"Mate, you need to stop drinking all this shit". </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Blaise? What day is it?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"I come in here to check on you every week and I see the same shit all over again. Get a grip! I'm half expecting to find you dead the next time I turn up." Draco sits up and stares at Blaise right in the eye still trying to figure out why he was bothering. The haunted look in his eyes stops Blaise in his tracks. </p><p> </p><p>"Bad night, huh?" Draco grunts in reply. <em>Understatement of the year, mate.</em></p><p> </p><p>Sighing he takes a place on the edge of Draco's bed and looks him in the eye determined to try talking sense into him again. "Your mother's been asking about you again. I don't think I can continue lying to her about where you are. Sometimes, I think she knows I am and that she's some sort of Legilimen." </p><p> </p><p>"She is you know." Draco whispers, finally working out what to say.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh great! Now you tell me. How many years have we been mates now? I seriously can't believe how I haven't murdered you."</p><p> </p><p>"Yea yea. We both know you're almost as good an Occlumen as I am so shut up and pass me a Pepper-up or I will hex your mouth shut. You're giving me a bleeding headache!" Draco mutters.</p><p> </p><p>"You gave yourself the bleeding headache. Don't you dare fucking lay that blame on me!" Blaise exclaims passing him the sobering potion. </p><p> </p><p>"I would have thought you'd be thankful I'm a bleeding good potions master who brews all our damned stock of Pepper-ups." Feeling the effects of the potion ease its way through his system, he stands up and saunters across his room to the bath.</p><p> </p><p>He held himself up against his bathroom counter, Draco looks at himself in the mirror. His sunken grey eyes steel at the hate he shows for himself. He takes stock of all his scars that line his body courtesy of his fucking choices in life. They haunted his dreams every night but the worst ones were of his mother possibly dying and of Granger bleeding out on the ballroom floor. He wasn't meant to be alive. He should have gotten them out and got himself killed. Then he didn't need to live with all this guilt and stigma the end of the war had brought. </p><p> </p><p>Sure the Malfoy name had survived. Father had ensured it would be given he had been giving up Death Eater plans before the snakehead had died and Mother had lied about Potter's death on the battlefield. Still, they had done their fair share of damage as the Dark Lord's minions. Their name no longer instilled the same level of respect on both sides. They were just a family of cowards who turned with the tides and people didn't hesitate to remind them. But they did all they could to survive and they had. </p><p> </p><p>Turning off the shower, he strolled back into the room to pick out clothes for the day and settled for a white shirt, emerald cufflinks, grey trousers and finishes off with a forest green silk ribbon to tie his hair back. </p><p> </p><p>"You look rather human now. Going somewhere?" </p><p> </p><p>"I thought you left." Draco muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"I would have but I had things to discuss with you. I presume you have not been through your mails." He raised an eyebrow looking pointedly at the stack that lay on his desk. "For awhile now, from the looks of it."</p><p> </p><p>"Why bother? Nothing good comes out of them. You remember having to put me back together after that explosive one?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, well. That was...unfortunate." Blaise hesitates. </p><p> </p><p>"Unfortunate? That's all you can say?" Draco shouts, temper rising. "Unfortunate is an understatement. You should have let it kill me. I should have died back then. Then I wouldn't need to see everything in my dreams again. Mother lying broken on the floor. Granger bleeding it out crying out for me to save her. And you wonder why I drink myself into oblivion every night? It's so that I can at least numb these dreams that come regardless." He turns and fists the wall. </p><p> </p><p>"Dray. You have to let that all go. You hold on too well to the guilt. There was nothing you could have done. You could have saved her. It would have meant damning your family. You couldn't let them die for what you wanted to do. Not when that was the reason you took the Mark in the first place. There is no way Granger wouldn't have understood. And they got away didn't they. You had Dobby get them out. You bought enough time for your family and you got them all out. You have to let it go. You can't live the rest of your life in this swanky New York apartment avoiding reality." </p><p> </p><p>Draco stood silent trying to process his friend's words. He had escaped to New York after being acquitted at his trial. He hadn't been seen for months. Not by the public not even by his parents. Only Blaise had found him a month later and even then he didn't know how. Something about mafia connections whatever it meant. He watched as his friend picked up one of the letters off the table and examined it for any curses or hexes. Funny, he had been very specific in picking out that particular letter. Probably had something he wanted to talk about. He tore it open and skimmed it and passed it on to Draco. Taking it in his hand, he set out of his room and walked downstairs to set up the coffee machine with Blaise trailing behind him. He saw the Hogwarts letterhead first and stared as memories of broken corridors and fiendfyre flooded him. It threatened to floor him. He could feel the walls closing in and the voices in his head. Then he felt Blaise grab his arm and pulling him along sitting him down. "Breathe Dray. Now one in and one out. Follow me." </p><p> </p><p>It took minutes before he snapped out of his panic attack and looked up into Blaise's eyes. Then back at the letter that was in front of him. He took another slow shaky breath and began to read.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>6 years later</strong>
</p><p>
  <em> ~~I know it breaks your heart. Moved to the city in a broke-down car. And four years, no calls. Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar. And I, I, I, I, I can't stop. No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop~~</em>
</p><p>He woke with a start. Beads of sweat slipping down the side of his face dripping from his chin. He hadn't dreamt in awhile and he supposed it was long overdue. He noticed had fallen asleep in his study again as his eyes scanned the copy of the International Wizarding Times in front of him where a familiar set of whiskey brown eyes gazed back at him. The subject of his dreams and guilt. Even 5 years later he hadn't been able to let her go. He kept up with all her news. The latest was she had finally made the Wizengamot, earned her seat as the youngest of them all. He had been sure of her and it filled him with pride how quickly she had accomplished her goals. And gods how much he missed her. </p><p> </p><p>Setting the paper aside, he stood and looked out at the skyline of Manhattan. He had turned away from her those years ago convincing himself he didn't deserve her. She didn't deserve the stigma of associating with him. Didn't deserve the disdain his parents had held for her. Didn't deserve her choosing him over Potter and Weasel. So he left without a word and escaped to New York. </p><p> </p><p>"Master..." a small voice called out. "Twinky has your breakfast ready. Master's first meeting at 10." </p><p> </p><p>Draco snapped out of his thoughts and compartmentalised his emotions and began the process of starting his day. </p><p> </p><p>"Master dreams of Mistress again."</p><p> </p><p>For a tiny house elf like Twinky, she was sure astute. "She is not your Mistress, Twinky." Draco states a matter of factly. </p><p> </p><p>"Twinky has been with Master Draco since he was a baby. Twinky knows things and Twinky knows Master loves her since Twinky sees her." </p><p> </p><p>Admitting it would be pointless given it was true so Draco chose to ignore her comment. "I'll be down shortly." He said as he walked into his bedroom and proceeded to his shower turning his thoughts on the schedule for the day. </p><p> </p><p>Draco had escaped to New York those 5 years ago with nothing but a role as an ambassador to MACUSA. He hadn't told anyone about the job and made sure no one knew he was the ambassador except the Minister himself. Kingsley had been the one to offer him the role stating that his talents in business and diplomacy was hand trained by the best in the game and best meant his Father. Draco would grudgingly admit that had his Father not follow in the footsteps of Voldemort, he would probably have been an aide of the Minister given his influence and mind for politics. </p><p> </p><p>When Draco arrived in New York, he was astounded by how big the city was and how magic had worked secretly into the various corporations. His role as an ambassador allowed him access to important connections and soon he threw his inheritance into various businesses which catered for both muggle and magical folk. A gap he foresaw would reap him rich returns. </p><p> </p><p>He also realised quickly that the war was so localised that most of his American counterparts had not even known about it in detail. Naturally, no one knew nor cared about the role he had played in the war. It was as if what he had been through counted for nothing at all. Good thing was that because no one cared, no one looked at him and decided he was worthless and thus his empire had grown. He had fingers in numerous pies from hotels to biomedical. Malfoy Enterprises was now the leading magical business in the United States and it served as a good distraction for Draco in the past 5 years. <em>He made his mark as well.</em> He thought to himself and used a quick drying spell as he stepped out of the shower and started to dress. When he was done he was an image of an all powerful and elusive magnate that everyone wanted a piece of. </p><p> </p><p>The meetings he had throughout the day had served to distract him from his terrible night but he couldn't shake off the image of her. Thoughts of her would come to him at random points of the day but mainly he saw her eyes. At first, there was fear in them and his expression grew haunted which served to frighten his Board of Directors who were presenting the quarterly updates on the company. He sat there with a coldness to his aura that by the time the meeting was over his Board sat in trepidation and tense silence awaiting his verdict. Of course, he already knew the figures at the back of his hand. They'd fallen behind the planned production and sales growth figures for the quarter by a percentage point and it was expected at the next quarter to exceed the pace of growth anyway but his dreams and then his stray thoughts of Granger had put him in that mood and he didn't see why some stress wouldn't be good for the management team. So he stood, nodded curtly and exited the room in a slow measured pace. He could feel the tension break as the men heaved a sigh of relief once his foot was out of the room.<em>That would teach them</em>, he smirked. In the end, business was business and results were all that mattered. </p><p> </p><p>As the day progressed, in his mind, her eyes grew softer and his heart grew lighter. He remembered the times they were happy, the times where she laughed and in the cold nights where sleep wouldn't come, the warmth of her body pressed to his. So by the time he was set to walk through his newest hotel, surveying the standards of the rooms, the service staff, and listening to the management staff reporting the numbers, he was fairly amenable to the dinner meeting that they were suggesting. After all, they did deserve a carrot for the work they put into the place. The Cassiopeia was the gem of the industry and the first of its kind where No-Majs and wizarding kind alike were accommodated to standards of royalty. All whims were met and the rewards princely. They were twin towers of opulence and every form of media had been talking about her 2 years before she was launched and it had been booked out for almost 2 years in advance a year before launch. Reviews within the first month were magnificent though you could only experience it first hand to understand the experience. No-Maj comments were the most ironic because they all agreed along the lines of "It was like magic!". The towers were split such that there were no mixes between the kinds and in face of publicity one tower offered secrecy whilst the other was more public though no one questioned it to carefully as getting a reservation in proved to be such an effort that people were usually glad they got in at all. Draco knew he was toeing the line on secrecy laws but his connections were sufficient to hush up even the most diligent lawmakers in the Congress. </p><p> </p><p>"As we were saying Mr Malfoy, Mr Zabini, the reservations continue to be full through to the next year and we expect breakeven by the end of this year which is 6 months ahead of estimates..." Matthews reported as they walked into the lounge where champagne had been iced prior to the arrival and served as the stepped in. The toast, however, was drowned out by the sound of a muffled laugh from behind him. </p><p> </p><p><em>No. It couldn't possibly be her. She was in London for fucks sake.</em> <em>Get out of your head Malfoy!</em> He stared up at Blaise who had a puzzled look on his face gazing in the direction of where the disturbance had come from.  Draco turned around and scanned the room, his eye finally resting on the brunette sitting at the bar flirting with the bartender. Draco's eyes widen for an instant then darken with a mixture of emotions that told Blaise this couldn't end well. It didn't the last time and he had to pick up the pieces for months after Draco's meltdown. "Mate, let it go.. you know how..." Blaise muttered quietly only to be silenced by a glare. He knew it when Draco got into this mood that nothing could change his mind but he had to try so he did what he could and held Draco by the wrist out of sight of the management team which had broken out into conversation. "Dray..."</p><p> </p><p>He jerked out of his grasp with a little effort and Blaise knew he had lost. "Excuse me gentlemen, but I'm afraid I won't be joining you for dinner. I'm sure Blaise will be good company and I'll leave him in your care. Good evening." He smiled charmingly at the puzzled crowd. Sighing inwardly, Blaise took the cue to steer the group out of the lounge and to the restaurant where dinner service was waiting. With Blaise otherwise occupied, Draco turned to the woman that haunted his thoughts in the day and dreams at night. She was more magnificent then he remembered. She had sleeked her hair into a messy bun that hung just above the nape exposing her neck. Strands framed her face. He watched as she tucked one behind her ear. The emerald dress hugged her curves exposed her back and shimmered in the light. Her eyes shone in light humour. And she wore those damn ruby dangles he bought for her those years ago for graduation. It elicited a strange emotion from him which he couldn't be sure was relief or frustration.</p><p> </p><p>As he neared her, he caught a familiar wisp of her scent. Lilies, fresh parchment, rain. He would have thought he was hallucinating if not for the instant she stiffen as if sensing his presence. </p><p> </p><p>"Sir, your usual?" David, the bartender said as Draco lowered his arms on either side of her trapping her between him and the bar. He wasn't taking the chance on her bolting. Still staring at David, he lowered his head marginally nearer to her ear and replied, "Yes, please. And put Miss Granger's bill on my account, David." He felt her relax and tilt her head slightly back, holding and hesitating as if debating with herself whether she should lean in to his chest. He could see in his mind she closed her eyes and breathed in his scent for the instant like how she used to. He smirked as her heard the cogs of her brain starting to work. Her brain fascinated him. She fascinated him.  </p><p> </p><p>As David walked away, she seemed to remember herself but before she could formulate a plan, he spun her seat around and came face to face with the pair of amber eyes that he thought of all day. "I see you've come in person to haunt me now, Granger." He continued to stare into the depths of his heaven and personal hell. His face a mask but his eyes he knew betrayed the intensity of his feelings for the witch before of him. </p>
