<p>“What is your name, child?”</p>
<p>“C-Credence, sir.”</p>
<p>The templar scribbled something down on a piece of parchment and handed it to the aide beside him.</p>
<p>“You’re in the third wing. You will report to Knight-Captain McTavish. You are expected to follow the rules of our Circle and any deviation from those rules will be cause for punishment. The Knight-Captain will assign you a bed, and we will provide clothing and any necessary provisions. You may go.”</p>
<p>Credence was frozen in place. The templar barely noticed until he looked up from his parchment and realized he was still there.</p>
<p>“I said you may go. What’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>“I-I don’t... why...”</p>
<p>The templar rolled his eyes and peered in closer at Credence.</p>
<p>“I can see why your parents wanted rid of you, idiot child. You’ll find if you’re not able to follow basic instructions around here that it won’t be very fun for you.”</p>
<p>“I’m s-s-sorry, sir,” he stammered, fat tears rolling down his cheeks, “I... I just w-want to go h-home.” He couldn’t stop himself. Big hiccuping sobs started erupting from his chest and he felt like he was about to crumple to the floor.</p>
<p>Suddenly he felt a sharp pain across his cheek, and the skin immediately turned hot and red.</p>
<p>“Stop that at once,” the templar hissed, winding up to threaten him with another slap. “This is your home now. You should be on your knees giving thanks to the Maker that you’re here and not an abomination, a filthy apostate wandering the wilds and murdering innocents because you can’t control yourself. Your family doesn’t want you back; what family would want a mage amongst them?”</p>
<p>Credence had stopped crying from the sheer shock of being hit. His parents were strict and often cold, but they had never hit him like that.</p>
<p>“Now,” the templar continued, straightening back up, “go to the third wing. And pull yourself together lest the Knight-Captain see you in such a disgusting state. You. May. Go.”</p>
<p>The fear of another harsh slap was enough to get Credence’s feet moving, but he soon discovered that after heading through what seemed like miles of identical, twisting corridors that he had no idea where he was going. He slumped down against a wall, staring ahead blankly, until another mage discovered him hours later.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>It had been ten years to the day since Credence had been given to the Circle. He was twenty now, a young man, but most days he still felt like the terrified child in that hallway. Once he had learned how to be inconspicuous, to blend in and behave, the abuse lessened, but every day he lived in fear of doing something that would draw the templar’s attentions. Once he simply dropped a mug, not even breaking it, and his hands were beaten so badly he couldn’t write for a week. It was a small comfort that at least he wasn’t alone. The templars treated all the mages like pond scum, and those that tried to speak out or fight back got it even worse. Credence sometimes felt like a coward for not standing up to them like the others did, but he had seen and heard the kinds of things the templars liked to do to the ‘naughty ones’ and it shook him to his very core.</p>
<p>Newt, his bunk mate, was one of the troublemakers, but he took everything the templars gave to him with stoic defiance, refusing to give them the satisfaction of seeing him suffer. But suffer he did. Credence held him at night while he sobbed quietly into his neck, cradling another broken wrist or burn or bruise. What kept him going were his creatures. He once told Credence it was worth every mark on his body they gave him if he could look after those creatures. He somehow managed to keep a pet nug hidden in their dormitory – Credence could never figure out how that was possible – and repeatedly snuck out of the tower to observe any animal that happened to wander close enough.</p>
<p>“I got one of the halla to eat out of my hand yesterday!” he crowed excitedly. “Normally they won’t come close to anyone who isn’t Dalish and even then... oh, Credence, it was beautiful!”</p>
<p>Credence was happy for him, he truly was, but he was also terrified. Newt had been sneaking out more and more frequently and it was only a matter of time until he was caught...</p>
<p>Today, however, that was the least of his worries. Knight-Captain McTavish was leaving the Circle, retiring to somewhere in Antiva to enjoy his old age by the sea. ‘How lovely for him’ thought Credence bitterly. Truly, he could have been much worse off. The Knight-Captain was harsh but he never beat his charges, usually ignoring them in favour of flirting with the elven servants or drinking. But with the Knight-Captain’s retirement came a new templar, an unfamiliar templar, someone who could be much worse. Credence didn’t have much faith in the Order after seeing how the majority of them acted. He wished he could have been placed with Knight-Captain Goldstein, the only one who had ever been kind to him, but she and her charges were relegated to the cellars and he rarely saw them. Goldstein had the nerve to speak out against the abuses she saw and while they didn’t get rid of her, they made her life a misery.</p>
<p>“At least in the cellars the rats don’t pretend to be something they’re not,” she whispered to him once, offering a small smile and a wink.</p>
<p>Credence held on to that smile as he fidgeted nervously, standing in the Great Hall with his dorm mates. He looked to Newt for reassurance but he was just staring straight ahead, blinking owlishly, likely thinking about what he wanted to feed the bronto that had been wandering around the forest nearby.</p>
<p>A door slammed open and he jerked upright as the Knight-Commander stalked across the stone floor, boots clicking loudly. Knight-Commander Picquery’s control of the room was effortless, much like her control of the Circle Tower. She was intimidating, terrifying, and obsessed with keeping their Circle as secure as possible. This meant that while she never personally abused any of the mages living there, she turned a blind eye to whatever was going on as long as the Tower remained free of abominations. Credence often wondered if that was an even worse crime.</p>
<p>“As you all know,” she began, coming to a halt in front of the group of mages, “Knight-Captain McTavish is no longer with us. This means you will be getting a new templar to keep you all under control. Your new Knight-Captain comes to us from the White Spire-”</p>
<p>She was interrupted by hushed whispers and gasps from the assembled crowd, templars included. The White Spire was the headquarters of the Templar Order, and only the best were ever called to serve there. It was said to be a lavish place, even for the mages, and rumours of its decadence had spread all across Thedas.</p>
<p>“Quiet! He comes to us from the White Spire by recommendation of the Knight-Vigilant himself, offering up one of his best and brightest as a reward for our continued success.”</p>
<p>Credence felt his heart sink a little. If the Knight-Vigilant saw their Circle as a success, Credence could only imagine what kind of person he was... and who he deemed to be a model of that.</p>
<p>“This is Knight-Captain Graves. He will be the primary supervisor of your group. Any concerns or questions going forward will be directed to him. I will allow him to make his own introduction to you.”</p>
<p>She stepped aside, and a man emerged from the shadows at the side of the room. Credence hadn’t even noticed he was there, but now he couldn’t imagine looking anywhere else. He was resplendent in his armour, steel plate shining with the templar insignia of a flaming sword etched into the breastplate. The crimson fabric underneath was unwrinkled, like it had just come off the loom, and his blade was equally unblemished as it hung shining by his side. He was younger than McTavish, perhaps in his 40s, with silver at his temples and large brown eyes that could be gentle if he wasn’t glaring down at all of them.</p>
<p>“Good morning.” His voice was deep and strong and it made Credence shiver. “The Knight-Commander has told me, and I can see for myself now, that you are all young mages who have not yet had their Harrowing.”</p>
<p>The mere mention of the Harrowing was enough to make Credence feel slightly ill, and from the looks of the others he wasn’t alone. It was a cruel test, putting a mage alone in the Fade to see if they could survive without being possessed by a demon... or going mad. If you passed your Harrowing you obtained a modicum of freedom, although still forced to live in the Tower for the rest of your life. If you failed... all that awaited was death or Tranquility, and Credence wasn’t sure which was worse.</p>
<p>Graves continued, “As it stands, I will be responsible for your well-being in addition to training you to withstand your Harrowing and--”</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a gentle cough from Picquery.</p>
<p>“... I’m sorry, Knight-Commander, is there something you wish to add?”</p>
<p>She smiled tightly. “We do not assist the mages with preparation for their Harrowing here, Knight-Commander. In the real world there is no training for warding off demon possession, and it may strike at any time. They should be ready to face the unexpected, and if they are strong enough to survive that, we can remain confident that they will survive anything else.”</p>
<p>Graves furrowed his heavy brow, and he opened his mouth as if to respond, but obviously thought better of it.</p>
<p>“Understood, Knight-Commander.” He turned back to their group, eyes locking on Credence. He felt himself flush and looked away quickly, but when he dared to look back up Graves’ eyes were still upon him. “As I was saying, I am now responsible for all of you. I intend to show you respect, as long as you afford me the same courtesy. That is all.”</p>
<p>He nodded at Picquery and walked out of the hall, presumably to his room and office where he was stationed. The Knight-Commander dismissed them soon after, and Credence was quick to tug on Newt’s sleeve as they walked back to their dormitory.</p>
<p>“The White Spire,” he whispered, slightly in awe.</p>
<p>“I heard they take meals together there, mages and templars. And mages are allowed to take trips home once they’ve passed their Harrowing.”</p>
<p>Credence couldn’t believe it. It seemed so different from their lives, and he wondered how he had the rotten luck of ending up in Tantervale.</p>
<p>“I wonder--”</p>
<p>“Don’t get your hopes up, Credence,” Newt said gently, “a templar is still a templar, no matter where they come from. He has absolute power over us, and power like that is easily corrupted.”</p>
<p>Credence nodded, worrying at his lip with his teeth. He wanted so desperately to cling on to the sliver of lightness in the midst of all this dark. He wanted to believe Graves was a good man.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p>For the next month, nothing much changed. Graves mostly kept to himself, and the mages under his care felt just as inconsequential as they had with McTavish. Graves, however, seemed to prefer reading and studying over flirting with servant girls. The only interactions Credence ever had with him were when he performed the nightly bed check to ensure everyone was accounted for, and when they passed each other in the hallway on their way to and from the dining hall.</p>
<p>Newt hadn’t snuck out of the Tower since Graves arrived, wisely waiting to learn his routines, but he was growing restless.</p>
<p>“The bronto was pregnant,” he whispered to Credence one night, “and she’ll be ready to have her calf any day now. I need to see her, make sure... make sure she’s ok.”</p>
<p>“Newt, I don’t think--”</p>
<p>“I’ve been watching Graves, you know that. He’s out like a light an hour after we get locked in. I’ll wait two, just to be safe.”</p>
<p>Credence knew there was no arguing with him when he got like this.</p>
<p>“Just... be careful, alright?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Credence lay wide awake as he listened to Newt shuffling around, putting together a small bag of things to take, and he squeezed his eyes shut when he heard the soft click of a lockpick opening their door. He couldn’t sleep though, turning over fitfully, praying silently to the Maker to look after Newt.</p>
<p>He must have drifted off at some point because he was jerked awake by the sound of scuffling and a bang outside his door, followed by a number of loud whispered voices. Credence felt his heart pound in his chest as he gripped his sheets, hoping beyond all hope that it was just a few drunk templars wandering back to their rooms. But then he heard a low whine that was abruptly silenced by a sickening thud, and he knew. The scuffling noises continued down the hall, growing quieter as they moved away from his room, but Credence’s heart wouldn’t slow down. He kept imagining Newt, broken on the stone floor, his beautiful red hair matted with blood...</p>
<p>Credence sat up and kicked the covers off, not even bothering to put on slippers or shoes before creeping out the door and down the hall. There was no blood, not yet, but he followed the whimpers to what was an empty room at the end of the long passageway. The door was shut but he could hear what was going on clearly enough.</p>
<p>“You thought you could sneak out, little mage?” There was a harsh laugh and then another solid thud. “Thought you could hide in the forest, practicing blood magic?”</p>
<p>“Blood magic?” Credence whispered to himself. No. There was no way. Newt would never--</p>
<p>“And those disgusting creatures! Were you planning to bring them back here, hm? Let them loose in the tower so they could burn us all to death?”</p>
<p>Credence didn’t know much about animals, but he certainly knew that brontos weren’t capable of setting things on fire.</p>
<p>“They aren’t like that, they’re innocent-- NGHH.”</p>
<p>Newt’s voice was cut off by what sounded like a chair crashing to the floor.</p>
<p>“Dragonlings aren’t innocent, they’re monsters! And you wanted to unleash them on the Circle!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Newt,” Credence whispered, tears springing from his eyes.</p>
<p>“Since your Knight-Captain is nowhere to be found, we’re going to give you your punishment. Stand up.”</p>
<p>“No, I won’t, I--”</p>
<p>“SILENCE.” From behind the solid door, Credence felt a slimy, wet shiver run down his spine, and he nearly passed out. He imagined it was only the fact that he was behind the door, away from the direct hit, that he didn’t. Silencing was used by templars in only the most extreme cases. It completely drained the mage of their power, preventing them from casting any spells, whether they be offensive or defensive. It also left them weak, and for all intensive purposes, helpless.</p>
<p>“You brought that on yourself,” a voice said with a sneer.</p>
<p>“I saw him, he was about to Mind Blast you.”</p>
<p>Credence felt anger roiling in his stomach. Mind Blast was an advanced spell, there was no way Newt could have been trying to use it, and even if he did it wouldn’t have had any effect. And now he was without any defenses whatsoever.</p>
<p>“Well... let’s teach this little brat a lesson, shall we?”</p>
<p>The stone floor was ice cold against Credence’s bare feet, but he barely noticed. All he could focus on were the sickening cracks and thuds coming from the other side of the door, the cruel laughter, and complete silence from Newt. He was shaking – with anger, with cold, with fear – and tears were streaming hot down his cheeks as he stood with his palms pressed up against the wood of the door. It wasn’t fair. Newt was so good, and so kind, and it wasn’t FAIR.</p>
<p>A crackling at his fingertips was the only warning. Suddenly, the door blasted inwards off its hinges, striking one templar down to the floor where he lay unconscious, covered with shards of burning wood. Credence was still standing, frozen in place, hands outstretched and wreathed in blue electricity. There were two more templars in the room, both staring slack-jawed at the scene before them until one of them came to his senses.</p>
<p>“Andraste’s tits! SIL--”</p>
<p>It was like his body was beyond his control. The magic burst out of his fingertips like a dam had just crumbled, striking the closest templar square in the chest. He screamed as his body convulsed with electric current, and even when the screaming stopped, Credence kept going. Blast after blast of electricity shot out of his hands as the man writhed on the floor. Credence was still crying, but his face had twisted into a mask of pure anguish as he unleashed everything he had been holding back. The other templar had backed himself into a corner, clutching the hilt of his sword but obviously too afraid to get close enough to use it.</p>
<p>Smoke was starting to seep out from under the templar’s armour, and Credence knew he was killing him, but he couldn’t stop. He saw Newt on the floor, his face beaten so badly he was barely recognizable, and he let out a pained wail as more and more current flowed through his arms. The entire room was filled with blue light, sparks igniting old drapery that had been stored there, and Credence could feel a ball of light building and building between his hands, growing larger and more powerful, just begging to be released--</p>
<p>“SILENCE!” The booming voice echoed in the room, and it was as if all the bones had been removed from Credence’s legs. He crumpled to the floor, smashing his temple against the stone, but he barely felt it. His vision swam as he watched a flash of red streak past him to check the bodies on the ground.</p>
<p>“They’re still alive. We need a healer. Go! NOW!”</p>
<p>Credence heard the cowering templar scramble out the door, metal clanking as he ran to get help. He moaned, trying to sit up, but it was futile. The blurry red figure got closer until it bent down next to him. It was Knight-Captain Graves, dressed in dark leathers and his red tunic, but unarmoured.</p>
<p>“Credence,” he said, peering down at him with an uncategorizable expression on his face.</p>
<p>“P-please,” Credence moaned, clinging on to the last shreds of consciousness, “please help me.”</p>
<p>The last thing he felt before he passed out was a strong, warm hand on the back of his neck, holding him steady.</p>
