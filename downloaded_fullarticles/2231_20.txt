    <p>Chapter one:<br/>
A journey I would never forget</p><p> </p><p>     Today is the day, after weeks of intense interviewing and waiting weeks in between letters it was finally here. It took two plane rides, a bus and a walk to the train station; now I sit comfortably alone, in my cabin.<br/>
I had just received a teaching assistant job in England; there is a special school for kids with magical talents. When I was a little girl living in Southern California I received a letter from this very school. Unable to send me there; my parents ensured that the magical side would be nourished as well as my muggle side. I had been personally tutored by the headmaster and in fact, it was he who asked if I wanted to be considered for the job.<br/>
Now a twenty year old woman I would be going to the very school I had dreamed about my whole life.<br/>
The train stops and so does my heart. Breathlessly I gather up my things and make the long trip down the hall and off the train. When I step off there are two very unusual people waiting there. One whose hair couldn't seem to decide what color it wanted to be and a large man with a face covered in hair.<br/>
"Are you here for me?" I ask, taking a step towards them.<br/>
The girl, whose hair is now a startling pink looks at the man then to the piece of paper in her hand.<br/>
"Celeste, right?" she finally says, cocking her head.<br/>
"That’s me"<br/>
"Oh thank goodness", she sighs quickly then rushes up to me, "it's really nice to meet you. I'm Tonks".<br/>
The two of us shake hands and I glance at the man. Tonks apologizes and introduces him as Hagrid.<br/>
"Are you about ready?" Tonks chirps with a sweet smile. I bite my lip, concerned to how this was going to go. Sensing my confusion, Tonks summoned her broom.<br/>
I had never flown before, I had always been terrified of heights and I was beginning to panic as I straddled the broom and held onto Tonks' shoulders.<br/>
"Hold on" Tonks says, kicking the ground and as the broom rises I shut my eyes tight.<br/>
I open one eye and look down, all I can see are clouds. The wind blows my hair back and strokes my cheeks. Feeling more secure I loosen my grip on Tonks.<br/>
"We’re about to land; hold on it gets a little bumpy". I close my eyes again and don't open them until I feel grass brush my ankle.<br/>
My eyes fly open and see an open field. I stumble off the broom and rub my eyes.<br/>
"Dumbledore wanted me to tell you that there's a staff meeting at 6:30 in his office" Tonks says. "I wish I could stay longer but I have to go to work. It was nice meeting you". And just like that, she was gone. Hagrid ruffles his beard and approaches me.<br/>
"I'll take you if you want, I'm heading there anyways" he says kindly.  I accept his offer and follows him up the grassy hill, at the top of the hill she sees Hogwarts for the first time. My jaw drops as I soak in the sheer beauty of the campus.<br/>
Hagrid leads me through the hallways with moving portraits and ghosts that recited poetry. I can't help but get distracted.<br/>
He stops in front of a large metal bird with its wigs curled up.<br/>
"Milky way" he says to the metal bird. Suddenly the wings open and a spiral staircase appear.<br/>
Following this man I literary just met half an hour ago my heart begins to pound in my chest. I know that if I don't keep moving then I'll chicken out. What if they all hate me?<br/>
Hagrid knocks on the door and it swings open. I peer inside briefly and Hagrid tells me to stay where I am until I’m called in.<br/>
"Thank you all for being here tonight" I recognize the voice, it is Dumbledore; the man who taught me everything I knew.<br/>
"There has been a change in staffing this year. Hagrid will be permanently keeping his post as Magical Creatures professor. Also, we welcome Beowolf Beetlebug filling the position of Defense of the dark arts, good luck professor". They politely applauded, not truly caring about the success or downfall of this new teacher.<br/>
"On that note, I have decided to make a new teaching position. I have hired a very bright young woman who will act as a teaching assistant. All staff members will get a chance to receive her help".<br/>
Someone clears their throat in the back, Dumbledore nods and the man stands up.<br/>
"Yes, Severus?"<br/>
"I think I speak for everyone when I say, whom have you hired and what are her qualifications?"<br/>
"Funny you should ask, I'll just let her introduce herself". Dumbledore looks at the door, it opens slowly and I step through the doorway.<br/>
Shyly I tuck my hair behind my ear. I stand, averagely tall; golden hair that is always wavy and dangles below my shoulder blades. My eyes are bright, soul piercingly green.<br/>
"My name is Celeste Parker. As you've probably already noticed I am not British or even from this continent. I am twenty years old and I excel at following directions and I don't crack easily under pressure". I realize halfway through my introduction that my voice was no longer timid.<br/>
"Did you attend school here?" an older woman with a tight bun asks.<br/>
"I did not. I was personally tutored by Master Dumbledore. I have no doubts in my ability to keep up. I'm willing to learn any new techniques that you may have".<br/>
The man Dumbledore had called Severus snorts and crosses his arms doubtingly.<br/>
"I have a schedule of when each of you will have Ms. Parker assist you. You'll be sent an owl a week prior. Thank you for your time and I'll see you at the Sorting ceremony" Dumbledore concludes.<br/>
As the staff clears out I walk up to Dumbledore and he hands me the schedule.<br/>
"Your living quarters is in the second tower, the password is Pighorn" he turns away and sits at his desk.<br/>
"Sir?"<br/>
"Yes?" he answers, looking up.<br/>
"Does…he hate me?" I say gesturing towards Severus who shot her a final dirty look before leaving the office<br/>
“Professor Snape… it's just his nature. Feast and Sorting starts pretty soon, you better get changed".<br/>
"Actually sir, I'd rather explore the castle. If you don't mind, I'd like to figure out where all their classrooms are".<br/>
"Of course. In that case then, Professor McGonagall will be expecting you no later than 7am tomorrow". Dumbledore looks down and begins writing.<br/>
"Thank you sir" I say as I walk out of his office.</p>
