    <p>
  <span>Harry crept up to the attic when his father and grandfather weren’t looking. They were more preoccupied with fighting than paying attention to what he was doing. He carefully walked across the dust-covered wood floor, attempting to not make any noise. Eventually, they would learn that he was no longer in the room with them, but he wanted to delay that moment for as long as possible. The deafening thunder outside cracked across the sky, rattling the windows. The storm helped his cover, masking his steps. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His grandfather had long told him since he was small, elaborate stories of treasure hunting, and pirates, and of kings and queens. His father, James, wrote them off as nonsense more recently, but Harry believed despite his father’s protests. His grandfather would never lie to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Walking over to the darkest part of the attic where the small light didn’t reach, Harry found a box, one that his grandfather Fleamont hadn’t shown him yet. He had been curious for a while about the untouched boxes in the corner, but his father didn’t bring him to visit much. The time with his grandfather was rare and usually supervised by his father. Harry glanced once more at the entrance to the attic before turning back to the box. He wished he had a wand to clear the dust, but instead puffed out his cheeks and blew it out. Opening up the box, the contents inside were void of dust, having been protected. Harry pulled out the item on top — a large tome. Harry moved his hand to open it when he heard the floor creak. His head shot up and turned back toward the door. There his grandfather, Fleamont Potter, stood his hands in his pockets. He was peeking at Harry curiously through his round rimmed glasses before gesturing him to move closer. Harry stood up, tome in hand, and walked over to the man.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Grandfather. I-I, I just wanted another story. And you hadn’t shown me this one yet. I—” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fleamont put up a hand stopping Harry’s ramblings and laughed. “Curious as me, and as your father, you are boy. Why don’t you bring that over here? I think it’s time for another story...the most important one of all.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fleamont walked over to a corner close to the attic door. He pulled his wand out of his pocket and waved it, diminishing all of the dust. Harry loved seeing magic performed, no matter how small. It looked just as it used to when Harry would spend hours in the attic. Wanting to recreate the memories, Harry sat on a pillow on the floor while Fleamont sat on an old wooden box. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His grandfather opened the book and began pulling out all kinds of old photos and documents from inside the front cover. “This is a story of our ancestor Ignotus Peverell.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes went wide behind the circle glasses that matched his grandfathers and fathers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Long ago, centuries, in fact, Ignotus Peverell was told a secret by King Arthur. King Arthur was very sick and asked his stable boy to ready a carriage — he needed to see Merlin, urgently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ignotus rushed the King to the castle to see Merlin, but when Ignotus went inside to fetch him, he wasn’t there. He wasn’t in the city and King Arthur knew he was dying — the coughing up of blood for days on end meant that death was imminent. Perhaps even that night.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, what did he do?” Harry asked, eagerly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fleamont smiled and held up a finger. “He told the only person he could trust — your great-great-great-great-great grandfather, Ignotus Peverell.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What was the secret?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“King Arthur told Ignotus of a treasure that was taken from ancient empires throughout history — the Incas, the Egyptians, even the Americas. It was eventually discovered by a bunch of bigots—” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry raised an eyebrow. “Bigot? What’s a bigot?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A person who is intolerant of others opinions or beliefs.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded in understanding and Fleamont continued.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eventually though, the treasure was recovered from The Sacred 28 and protected by the Order of the Phoenix. An organization of which Merlin was a part of.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“King Arthur, as well?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fleamont nodded. “They were only two remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix. It was especially important for them to pass on the secret since his half-sister was a dark witch, Morgan le Fay. She would do anything for that treasure, but that is a story for another time.” Fleamont paused before continuing on. “Which was why it was so important for the king to talk to Merlin that night.  He needed to make sure they passed on the secret of the treasure before they both passed.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But it was okay then, right? The King told Ignotus.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fleamont inclined his head and brought his hands up, shrugging. “Well, sort of. King Arthur was very cryptic and didn’t actually tell Ignotus anything...only clues.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So the treasure, it was never found?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Correct. The King gave the clues to Ignotus and told him that the treasure was out of the Order of the Phoenix’s hands and was hidden in the United Kingdom somewhere by the Four Founders. And you know who they are, don’t you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded. “Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin,” he recited, holding up his fingers one at a time as he named them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Very good,” Fleamont said, praising Harry with a pat on the head, ruffling his already dishevelled locks. “Now Ignotus searched for the treasure for years and years, eventually passing on the secret to his son, and his son after that. Then they found this.” Fleamont passed a note to Harry. It was old and worn, ripped on the edges. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The Secret Lies with The Golden Snitch</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Secret Lies with The Golden Snitch,” Harry read. He looked up at his grandfather, his eyebrows scrunched while he contemplated the message. “What does that mean?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We may never know, though we’ve been searching for ages. Me, and your father too. The Golden Snitch, whatever it is, is out there, just waiting—” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“—What a bunch of tosh posh.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry jumped and looked toward the door where his father, James, was standing, his arms crossed across his chest. His eyes were narrowed but softened when they moved from Fleamont and onto Harry. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Father.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“James,” Fleamont said, standing up from the box. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t take what he says too seriously, Harry. It’s just a bunch of stories to trick you into wasting your whole life away. Like he did his, and almost did mine.” James turned to walk back down the stairs. “Come, Harry. We’re leaving.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded and watched his father walk down the stairs. He turned back to his grandfather, who was looking a bit put out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He knelt down in front of Harry. “Our ancestors wouldn’t lie, Harry. The treasure is out there. We just have to search.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I believe you, grandfather, but I’ll keep that a secret from dad.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fleamont nodded and bopped Harry on the nose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now, come on. We best get you downstairs before your father comes back up and rips into both our hides.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry laughed and followed his grandfather out of the attic. With one last look at the space he loved so much, he walked down the stairs, his mind reeling from what he learned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The Secret Lies with The Golden Snitch </span>
  </em>
  <span>he repeated to himself. He would find the treasure someday. For his grandfather, and to prove to his father that it wasn’t a waste. </span>
