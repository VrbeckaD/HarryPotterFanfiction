    <p align="left">Harry Potter wasn’t a normal eighteen year old boy. For starters, he was a wizard. He had also defeated one of the most powerful forces of evil that had ever struck the wizarding world, Lord Voldemort. He had been the youngest seeker in a century, the only ever fourth Tri-Wizard competitor, the sole person to survive the Killing Curse, and the famed Golden Boy, the Chosen One, one third of the Gryffindor Golden Trio. Not to mention the proud parent of a small child.</p><p> </p><p>The child wasn’t his, of course. Harry was just the godfather of little Teddy Lupin. His parents had died in the battle of Hogwarts. Teddy’s father, Remus Lupin, had been one of James Potter’s closest friends, and had entrusted the care of Teddy to Harry, should Remus’s (very likely) death come up him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Andromeda Tonks, Teddy’s grandmother, had offered to raise Harry until he had finished his schooling at Hogwarts, and figured out his career path. Harry had politely refused, opting to study for his NEWTS alone, instead of attending Hogwarts for a voluntary eighth year. (For many seventh year students of the previous year did not get proper education, as the school had been overrun by Death Eaters.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>This very important decision stemmed from Harry’s own childhood. His parents had died when he was just one year old, and his godfather, wrongly accused of assisting the Dark Lord in their murder, had been sent to Azkaban, the wizarding prison. As Harry had no rightful guardian to take him in, he was sent to his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. Albus Dumbledore had misguidedly believed that this was the best place for him, sheltering him from his fame at surviving Voldemort’s attack, and giving him protection through his new guardians’ care and his mother’s protection, harnessed through familial blood wards. However, to this day, no one, not even Harry’s closest friends, knew quite the extent of the abuse he had suffered at, quite literally, their hands.</p><p> </p><p>Now Harry, at eighteen, insisted upon caring for young Teddy Lupin, and giving him the loving childhood that Harry himself had never been able to enjoy. He felt he owed it to both Teddy and Remus (and he still felt at fault for Remus’s death).</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s life plan at this point essentially consisted of getting passing marks on his NEWTS, becoming a healer (Harry had decided against being an auror; he had seen enough conflict for a lifetime), and being the best guardian that Teddy could ask for. Even though, being the heir to both the Potter and Black fortunes, he would never be required to work for a living, Harry felt that he would need an ambition to pursue, something to throw himself into, especially once Teddy became of age for Hogwarts. Healing had seemed a good choice for him, so he decided on a NEWT course consisting of Potions, Transfiguration, Charms, Herbology, and Defense Against the Dark Arts. Between all his responsibilities, he would have his work cut out for him, but Harry felt that he could handle it.</p><p> </p><p>A person who knew how bad his childhood was might’ve been concerned that he would poorly treat a child, but with Harry, it was the complete opposite. He completely threw himself into taking care of Teddy. Even suffering from depression and PTSD, Harry was nothing but kind and gentle to Teddy. Anytime Teddy cried, Harry would comfort him, calm him, as he had always wished someone would’ve done for him when he was cold, lost, and shivering in a dark, lonely cupboard under the stairs. Harry never complained that Teddy cried to much, never lost his temper at him, or said the he was a nuisance, but instead was patient. Sometimes Teddy would climb up on his lap while Harry was studying, and Harry would never scold him or tell him to go away, but instead show Teddy pictures of amazing plants and creatures (and always insist that lots of werewolves were nice people, no matter how scary the picture looked), brew him funny potions at the work table he had set up, or produce small jets of sparks with his wand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Even disciplining Teddy, Harry was always soft. In one instance, Harry had been cooking breakfast for the two of them, and went into Teddy’s room to find him out of his crib. After frantically searching the house, he finally discovered Teddy in the library, surrounded by pages of one of Harry’s charms books. Once Harry finished mentally berating himself for not paying closer attention to the small boy, he sat down on the floor beside Teddy, and looked him gently in the eyes. “Hey,” Harry had said softly. “It’s not nice to destroy other people’s things, Teddy.” Teddy had looked at him, forlorn, and Harry felt so bad for having to scold him, but knew he had to stand his ground.</p><p> </p><p>But Teddy, almost two years old, had surprised him. “I’s sorry,” he squeaked. “Me and Dada clean up?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry had teared up at being called Teddy’s dad. “I’ll go get some tape,” he had said, smiling, “and after breakfast, me and my Teddy can clean this up together.” Harry had hugged him, made sure that Teddy ate a substantial amount of food, then went with him to go find a roll of Muggle tape Harry kept in his desk drawer. The two of them had spent the better part of the morning piecing the book together with tape. Harry could’ve done it quicker with magic, and he fixed it up properly afterwards, but knew that Teddy could learn a valuable lesson by helping to fix something he broke. Harry was very proud of him for being genuinely repentant, and being willing to correct his mistakes.</p><p> </p><p>As time went on, Teddy exhibited metamorphagos abilities, and a penchant for mischief. Harry constructed an area of his smaller study library across from the stairs with a baby gate around it, so he could watch Teddy and read his textbooks at the same time. One day, while Harry was contemplating a new principle he was reading about, the mischievous little one jiggled the baby gate open, and decided to go exploring. He had ended up staring at the small cupboard under the stairs which Harry had never gotten rid of. The door on the cupboard was loose, and when Harry looked up for his textbook, he discovered a tiny life form playing happily with his stuffed dog in the small space. Harry had felt his heart and throat clench up, and had rushed to scoop baby Teddy out of the cupboard under the stairs, and had promptly vanished it, leaving only a layer of plaster. It wouldn’t have been dangerous in there, everything that could potentially harm Teddy was safely out of reach, but he couldn’t stand seeing his (and Teddy really was his now) sweet, innocent, little child in such a confined space. After that, Harry had felt so-so- sad, and he had spent the rest of the day in Teddy’s room, cradling him and sobbing, rocking back and forth. For some reason, Teddy always had retained that one memory, and always wondered what had made his Dada so dismayed.</p><p> </p><p>Harry did everything he could to protect the child, and loved him so much. Teddy had his own room, connected to Harry’s, but more often than not, Teddy slept in Harry’s arms, letting Harry’s loving arms calm him to sleep. On nights like these, Harry always cast silencing charms around himself, soon wandlessly, and was careful not to wake him with his thrashing from his night terrors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He felt the need to shower Teddy with all the affection he could, so Harry cooked every meal for Teddy, pushing through painful flashbacks of burnt flesh and high-pitched screeching, anxiety and occasional panic attacks. Teddy deserved all of his love and more, everything Harry could give him, and everything Harry couldn’t. Teddy would never starve in his own home, not when there was ample food to give him. He wouldn’t feed Teddy enough to be unhealthful, but Harry would make sure he was well-fed with homemade food.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry never let his temper get the best of him when it came to Teddy. He never raised his voice (and surely not his hand!), and pushed through anything he was feeling, anxiety, exhaustion, the ever-lurking depressive thoughts, the flashbacks, and the nightmares. No, Harry would make sure that Teddy had the best childhood he could provide, even if he was hurting himself in the process.</p>
