    <p>Hermione stared down at her potion; it was perfect. It was precisely the right shade, and she had followed the instructions to the letter, but she knew it meant nothing. The ever tyrannical Professor Snape would still find fault.  </p><p>From the corner of her eye, Hermione could see Professor Snape near her cauldron. She held her breath, waiting to see if she'd remain invisible. There were days he'd leave her alone, but it didn't feel like it was going to be one of those days.</p><p>"Ah, Miss Granger," he sneered as he walked to the front of her des. Professor Snape looked down his crooked nose at her potion, seemingly dissatisfied. "That will be 5 points from Gryffindor and detention, 8 o'clock tonight. Being the Head Girl does not exempt you from putting effort into your work." He pointed to the empty desk next to her, "and clean that mess up."</p><p>It had become almost a routine. Hermione would get detention for some perceived fault ranging from an imperfect potion to the wrong tone of voice. Then Professor Snape would sit as his desk watching her while she cleaned.</p><p>Even though it was all artifice, Hermione sighed and began to draw her wand when a raised eyebrow from Snape told her that magic was not to be used this time. She grimaced and walked down the back of the potions room to locate a rag and bucket. Why did Neville have to discover muggle bubblegum? </p><p align="center">
  <strong> Dinner at the Great Hall </strong>
</p><p>As soon as Hermione spotted Harry waiting for her at the entrance to the Great Hall, she knew she was in for another one of <em>those </em>conversations.</p><p>"What did you even do this time Hermione? You know that if there's a chance he can give you detention he will! And to top it off you just sat there pretending you're not being unfairly treated!" Harry yelled. </p><p>Shushing her friend and dragging him to their usual seats, Hermione sighed. "I honestly don't know Harry, not this time at least. But he's a teacher, what am I supposed to do? Talk back? Yell? He has every right to give detention or dock points."</p><p>Hermione sat down on the bench and pulled out her potions textbook. She knew exactly why she had gotten the detention, but she wasn't going to share the reason with Harry. </p><p>"I mean nearly every potions lesson you come back with another detention. You never used to get any, not one! I can't understand it, Snape seems to be giving you an even tougher time this year, and you would think with the bloody war over he would let up a bit, but NO. Full-on snarky Professor with greasy hair to boot." Harry had been focusing on his meal while he spoke, but then he looked up with a frown, "Hermione, are you even listening to me?"</p><p>She raised her head from her book and gave a curt nod, she wasn't actually listening as she'd heard his rant before, but it was always better to appear attentive. After the war, Harry had become rather protective of her, and it wasn't always helpful. In his mind, they were heroes, and carrying on with the mundane didn't help anyone. It wasn't productive, he'd argued, and they were better off fighting crime as a trio. Hermione understood but ultimately felt a little normalcy wouldn't hurt them assimilate back into life after being on the run. </p><p>Both Harry and Ron had dropped potions when it came to their additional NEWT year choices. Hermione had argued that they would need it to become Aurors. Still, Harry had merely replied that killing Voldemort would get him any job he wished thank you very much. She knew he wasn't wong, but wished he'd take his final year education a little more seriously. </p><p>"Yes, Harry. Professor Snape: snarky, greasy, tough," she mumbled while trying to keep her mind out of the gutter.</p><p>"You don't even seem fazed by the idea that in 5 minutes you are going down to that greasy git!" Harry continued, pushing his plate of food away.</p><p>Hermione looked up at that comment. Was it really five minutes to eight? Shit, if she didn't move now, she might be late, and he wouldn't like that regardless of the pretence. With a motherly kiss on his forehead and a mumbled 'see you later, don't wait up', she flew out of her chair and down the spiral staircase, ignoring Harry's grumbling about 'fairness and war heroes'.</p><p>Racing down the stairs, Hermione navigated the dark corridors of the dungeons with under a minute to spare. She took a deep breath, composed herself and raised a hand to knock on his door, but he was one step ahead of her, like always, and the door swung open at her touch.</p><p>"Enter." His imposing voice echoed down the corridor. It was just a simple command, but she could already feel the tingle from her head to her toes.</p><p>She pushed the door open the rest of the way to find Professor Snape sitting at his desk with essays to mark. Hermione heard his quill scratching scathing comments on the latest unfortunate student's essay.</p><p>"Professor, I have come to serve my detention." Hermione's voice didn't betray her, this time.</p><p>He didn't look up, didn't acknowledge her in any way as he continued to mark the essay in front of him. "You should know what to do by now, Miss Granger."</p><p>And she did.</p><p>Hermione crossed the space between them, bent down and placed her hands on his neck, she slowly traced her fingers all the way down his back and round to his chest, before resting them on his shoulders.</p><p>"Do get on with it, Miss Granger. I haven't got all night!"</p><p>Though her voice didn't betray her before, his did, and she knew that she had him right where she wanted him.</p><p>"But Professor," she asked innocently, "you haven't given me any instructions." Hermione found her favourite place and rested her head in the crook of his neck. Feeling mischievous, she licked a spot of his pale skin that peeked out from between his high collar robes and blew on it.</p><p>"My..." he paused to clear his throat while shifting in his chair slightly, "instructions, Miss Granger are for you to sit on my lap.</p><p>Hermione gasped in delight, "But, Sir, I'm just a student!"</p><p>"Do I have to repeat myself, Miss Granger?" He asked, knowing the answer already.</p><p>"No, Sir."</p><p>Hermione straightened up and straddled his lap. Smirking, she took her time getting comfortable, moving her hips up and down before his hands gripped her waist. </p><p>They stared at each other for what seemed like hours, but in reality, it was only a few minutes.</p><p>"Hello, Hermione, my love," he said, breaking the silence. </p>
