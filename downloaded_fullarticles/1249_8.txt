    <p>A/N; I don't leave warnings, but with this one, I will. This story deals with domestic abuse and the trauma that lingers even after it's over.</p><p> </p><p>                                                                                                                                Broken Toys</p><p> Chapter One</p><p> Bright lights, loud voices, and an incessant beeping drew her out of the darkness. Stabbing pain behind her eyes caused Alecto to roll to her side and vomit. Gripping the metal bars of the gurney, slowly this time, she lifted her head and brought tentative fingers to her swollen face. A gentle hand reached out and wiped the bile from her mouth.</p><p>"You're safe, you're at the hospital. Can you tell me your name?" An American voice asked.</p><p>Through her one good eye, Alecto could tell the girl was a mediwitch, but then again, she looked muggle. With horror, Ally realized she was in a muggle hospital. How did that happen? The room started spinning, and the pounding in her head increased. She lay back down and let the muggle fuss over her.</p><p>Beeping, beeping, and more beeping. Somewhere in the tiny curtained-off room. The muggles had taken her clothes and replaced them with a ridiculous gown. Broken is how she felt. Shattered when the man she married, grabbed her by the hair and threw her into a wall. That was the beginning of the beating.</p><p>Ally brought a hand to her head. Dried blood, crusty and stiff in her hair. She wondered how many times he hit her in his drunken rage. He must have really hurt her this time. Maybe the neighbors heard, he must have been too drunk and forgot to put up the Silencing Charms. Ally chuckled, he was so drunk he forgot the Wards.</p><p>"Sweetie? Can you tell me your name?" The nurse asked again.</p><p>"Ally," She managed through her split lip, "Alecto Carrow." Ally gave the nurse her maiden name. Right now, she wanted nothing to do with the vile piece of shit that had done this to her. He was her husband; he was supposed to protect her and care for her. At least that's what he promised her brother.</p><p>The young nurse's eyes widened, and she smiled at Ally, "Ohhh………. Are you from Australia?"</p><p>"England, I'm British," Ally hissed through her teeth, she hated that, "Where the bloody hell am I?"</p><p>"Beverly Hospital in Rockport. Do you remember anything?"</p><p>"If I remembered I wouldn't bloody well have asked, now would I?" She didn't need to be a bitch, but the beeping, beeping, beeping, would not stop. Ally pulled at the cords attached to her chest. This just angered the beeping. She scooted to the foot of the bed and tore at the remaining wires, as her feet hit the floor the room began to spin, and hands lifted her back into the bed. These muggles were lucky. If she had her wand……….</p><p>Vinewood and Dragon heartstring, twelve- and three-quarter inches. It sang to her. Humming softly when she held it. Its magic entangled in her own. Broken now, just like she was. She lay back and let them reattach their wires. No use in trying to run.</p><p>"How is your pain, Mrs. Leonardis?" Another nurse asked.</p><p>"My head is pounding …… and it's Ms. Carrow."</p><p>"I'm sorry," The young nurse checked the band around her wrist, "It says on your band, Leonardis. I'll get registration to change that for you while I get you something for the pain, and for nausea."</p><p>"No, really, it's alright you don't have to do that. Just call me, Ally." Her voice cracked, and she could taste the blood in her mouth, "Could I have some water, please?"</p><p>"I'll check with the Doctor. But you've been vomiting so it might not be a good idea…..  Now, no trying to get out of bed without some help. I think you're still a bit wobbly."</p><p>The curtain rattled, and Ally could hear her leave the room. Alone now, she lay still and breathed in slowly, in through her nose out through her mouth, and the spinning room slowed to a stop. Prying her excellent eye open to get a good look around, before the nurse came back. Beeping again, this time, she knew it was behind her, mounted on a wall. Lighted numbers flickered as three different colored lights danced across the screen.</p><p> "I'll turn these down for you, how is that?" The lights dimmed, "You have a pretty good concussion, the orbit of your eye is fractured, and you have a few broken ribs. You needed several sutures in your face…….. And sweetie, the police would like to speak to you when you're ready." The nurse pushed what she assumed was a potion into the tube attached to her arm.</p><p>The throbbing in her head dulled. And her vision improved. She didn't want to talk to the muggle authorities. What had happened was none of their business. Not that she really remembered what happened. Bit by bit, her pain ebbed away, and the memory of the evening began to creep back.<br/>
Christopher had been out all day with his brothers, and in the two years, they were married, Ally knew what that meant. Her husband would be drunk. Just how drunk, though, would be the question?  </p><p> What would she say, what could she say? They were muggles. They would never understand. </p><p>Ally knew she needed to get home. There was a mess to clean up. It was only a matter of time before he made bail, and the muggle authorities would turn him loose. The clock on the wall showed one am.</p><p>Ally swung her legs off the side of the bed, pulling herself upright. The room spun on her, and she vomited.</p><p>"Oh, dear! Honey, you can't get up just yet." The nurse fussed over her, tucking her back into bed. "Now, I'm going on a lunch break, this is Susan. She's covering for me.</p><p>"Hello Ally, I'm Susan. Please let me know if you need anything," The new nurse gave a kind smile, as she watched the other nurse leave the room. She turned back to Ally and drew a wand from her sleeve, she warded the room and spoke with urgency, "Now let's get you the fuck out of this place before the no-maj's show up. "</p><p>Ally opened her one good eye, "How? How did you know?"</p><p>Susan handed her a vial, "Drink this….. quickly… It won't heal all the fractures right away, but it will help with the pain."</p><p>Ally tipped the glass cylinder into her mouth, drinking it down. Immediately she felt better. The pain eased away, and she was able to swing her legs over the edge of the bed, "How did you know?"</p><p>"I work for MACUSA and routinely scan for magical signatures, "Susan handed her plain grey muggle clothes with simple slip-on trainers.</p><p>Ally changed into the strange new clothes, "Can you help me get home?"</p><p>The tall blonde nurse gave Ally a questioning look," Are you sure that you want to go home? I can get you to a safe house… We can get you a wand if you need one and get you back to England."</p><p>"No, no, that's alright… I need to get home. I can contact my brother, he'll come for me. "Ally tucked a strand of hair still stiff with blood behind her ear.<br/>
"Alright …. If you're sure. Can I clean you up a bit? "</p><p>Ally nodded yes, and Susan pulled out her wand. With a few wand movements, the blood disappeared from her face and hair, and Ally could open her eye. Her nose was straightened and no longer dripped blood. Her head still ached, but she could stand without the room spinning, "Thank you, Susan, but I really need to get home."</p><p>"If the no-maj's have him, you know they will let him out…………." Susan looked grim.</p><p>Ally's voice sounded distant, "I'm counting on it, Susan."</p><p>The nurse held out a wand, "Can you tolerate apparation?" Ally nodded yes, "Here's a spare wand, it should work well enough for you to get home, "The nurse took a deep breath, pleading," Honey I can't make you leave him, but I'm begging you, please let me help you get away…please."</p><p>Ally gave her a little smile and took the wand from her hand, "Don't worry, Susan, I'll be all right… Thank you for everything," She gave the wand a jiggle, and it hummed in her hand. It would co-operate with her magic.</p><p>Susan held out a card for her to take and turned for the door, "If you ever need help, please contact me. Be careful, Ally. I'll delay the authorities… now go!"</p><p>Alecto fixed the exact destination in her mind and turned on the spot, leaving the incessant beeping and the antiseptic smells of the hospital.</p><p>Ally gagged and stumbled, maybe it was a little too soon for apparation. Her head felt as if it would split open, and after a few rough moments, she was able to stand upright. In front of her loomed the long drive that led to her husband's estate. She was right, none of the wards tingled against her skin. Christopher failed to put up the protective wards. The neighbors heard their dirty secrets and called the authorities.</p><p>Her feet felt like they were encased in Goblin steel. This was it. She could walk back up that drive, walk through that door, and clean up the mess, apologize. Beg forgiveness for bleeding on the floor. Beg him to forgive her for whatever it was that had enraged him this time.</p><p> She thought that she loved him in the beginning, and she could have. Now there was nowhere left to go. He would kill her if she went back. Maybe not today or even tomorrow, but in the end, he would kill her. Or she would kill him.</p><p>This was her father's doing he arranged the marriage, and like a good, pureblood girl, she agreed. Christopher came from the Noble House of Leonardis on the East coast of the United States of America. Two years ago, she graduated from Hogwarts, left her friends and family, worse she left a young man that she did love. If her father let her marry Rabastan, none of this mess would have happened.</p><p>Instead, `Ally left Rabastan, broken-hearted, standing alone in the rain and took an International portkey to Purgatory.</p><p>The neighbor's hounds barked, but no lights came on. Giving Ally an idea. She knew the neighbor hunted; she heard the shots and the hounds and had even been in his house. Her husband was enthralled with the muggle man's weapons, and she paid attention while he taught her husband to shoot. If she could find the gun, Ally was sure she could remember how to use it, and there would be no magical trace.</p><p> A disillusionment charm washed over her, and she added a cushioning charm to her shoes, and Ally quietly made her way up the neighbors' drive. The porchlight illuminated the front steps of the old estate. Ally wiggled the door handle, locked, she tapped it with her new wand' Alohomora,' and the door swung open. Trophies from his hunts lined the walls like the house-elf heads at the Black Estate. All clear, and Ally slipped into the front room. She moved quickly, heading straight for the study where she knew the old muggle kept his guns. </p><p>A big black box stood in the corner, a safe for the weapons she knew he kept locked up. Another 'Alohomora' and she surveyed the arsenal inside. Her hand hovered over the small handgun. It would be easier to handle, but she had never fired it and had no knowledge of how to load the bullets. That and she needed something bigger. And there it was the shotgun, her neighbor had explained, was for hunting. Its bullets or pellets came out of the end of the barrel and caused extensive damage. That's what she wanted.</p><p>The shotgun felt foreign, cold, and heavy in her hands. Ammunition, as the muggle called it, sat on a shelf next to the gun. Ally couldn't remember how many she needed. She did know that she needed buckshot and slugs, grabbing a handful of each, she stuffed them into the front of her sweatshirt, and headed for the door.</p><p>A light came on, and the sound of footsteps coming down the hallway stopped her in her tracks. She hated to apparate again so soon, but she had no choice. She thought of her front lawn and turned on her heel.</p><p> Falling to her knees on the lawn, the gun in her hands. Her neighbor's dogs were barking again, and this time all the lights were on. Her house stood silent and forbidding. The thought crossed her mind that maybe he was sitting in the dark waiting, just as she was planning. Thankfully she had possession of a wand. Something he didn't know and wasn't expecting.</p><p>Casting a quick 'Homenum Revelio' just to make sure. Ally stood at the entryway of the place that should feel like home. Instead, her hands trembled, and her heart filled with dread. She should turn around and run. Use the card that the nurse handed her. Leave the gun against the wall, portkey back to her home, and back to Rabastan. The thought of Rabastan gave her a flicker of hope. Maybe there was a chance he would forgive her.</p><p>Ally stepped through the front door, and memories of that first day flooded back. As a nervous bride, hopeful and naive, she remembered walking into her marriage to an unknown man with her head held high, and with courage. A proud Carrow of Britain's Sacred twenty-eight. Her brother and her father traveled with her to the States. They walked her down the aisle and handed her over to a man that lied to them. The minute that her father and brother left, everything changed.</p><p>The smell hit her first, blood and whiskey, and his cigarettes. Her blood, pooled, cold and sticky on the black and white tiles of the foyer. His tumbler of whiskey, knocked over, soaking into the wood of the table. Cigarette smoke still clung to the drapes. Ally's stomach clenched, 'Lumos' she whispered in the dark house. No one was there, and yet, she couldn't bring herself to raise her voice. Raising ones' voice was considered un-lady-like and warranted a hand across her mouth. She learned quickly to not speak unless spoken too. He liked to backhand her when she wasn't expecting it, just hard enough to split her lip.</p><p>Blue light illuminated the hall, her torn gown crumpled in a bloody heap. Broken glass, shattered furniture, holes in the walls. A few of those dents looked the size of her head. No wonder she still had a headache. Ally knew the house elves were in hiding, rarely seen and never heard. If she went to bed, now everything would be scrubbed clean and put to rights when the sun rose. Once more, like it never happened. As if he hadn't beaten her, raped her, so many times she lost count. He was her husband; could she even call it rape. When his brothers forced themselves on her, she considered that rape. Her husband did not. She was told on their wedding night that she belonged to them and she would be a good girl and take it.</p><p>To the right, just down the hall, Christopher's study loomed. This was a room she was not allowed to be in without him. This is where she was going to wait. She grabbed the pack of cheap muggle smokes and the half-empty bottle of whiskey that were left on the table and made her way down that hall. Shotgun still heavy in her hands. She pushed the door open with her foot. This was the room where she was brought for his brothers to violate. The man cave is what he called it. Ally stood in the center of the room, staring at the chair, a big overstuffed leather chair. Where he would sit and watch.</p><p>Now she would sit and wait. Ally eased herself into the soft leather and took a swig of the harsh amber liquid. Shotgun draped over her lap she lit a cigarette and waited. It wouldn't be long now. The clock on the wall showed three in the morning.</p><p>Sitting in the dark, Ally's mind drifted back to that first night with her husband, their wedding night. She wasn't a virgin, and her new husband made sure she paid for that transgression. He wanted blood, and he was going to get it. </p><p>Her first was with Rabastan, that memory was the one she would hold onto. Not her wedding night. Her wedding night was her descent into a vile pit.</p><p>Her husband was handsome and charming; he had friends, was close to his family. All of these things were important. These were things he showed the public. The real man came out behind closed doors.</p><p> At this point, Ally knew she was going to kill him. There was nothing else left to do. For two years, she endured his abuse. This time was no different than the last time he had beat her. But something inside her broke when she woke up in the muggle hospital. The looks the nurses gave her. Pity from a muggle. That did it. She could take the looks from her sisters-in-law, and she could take the leering and the nasty comments from her husband and his brothers. But pity from muggles was too hard to swallow.</p><p>Ally flicked the ashes of her cigarette onto the floor and started loading the shotgun. Just like the muggle instructed, buckshot goes first, he said, it spreads wide, so you're sure to hit the target. Slugs go next; they make a big hole. Then another slug for the finish.</p><p>No one in her family knew, not even her twin. Amycus would not recognize his sister at this point. The woman she became was not the vivacious teenage from school. She was a witch a powerful witch, she took no guff from anyone. So, how she wondered as she lit another smoke did she end up a battered and abused slip of a mouse. Holding her tongue. No, not even a mouse. Mice would fight back when cornered. For two long years, Alecto put her head down and made excuses for his behavior. He was drunk, he's trying to change, he didn't mean too, I shouldn't have made him mad……………..It was her fault, she was to blame for all of it. It was her fault when his dick wouldn't get hard, her fault when he beat her, her fault…………</p><p>A tear rolled down her cheek, thinking of Amycus, she missed her brother. Leaving him felt worse than leaving Rabastan. The three were inseparable. The plan was to marry Rabastan, and the three best friends would all live together. Rabastan understood the link between twins and that Amycus would always be around. There were children in her future then. Rabastan wanted them, lots of them.</p><p>Having children now seemed a distant dream. Too many miscarriages from too many beatings. That was Christopher's idea of birth control. Beat her until the baby fell out. Too many children slid down her leg and pooled on the bathroom floor. Then there would be the chastising from family members about her inability to produce an heir.</p><p>Ally's mind reeled. How was she going to tell her brother? Amycus protected her, he was the big brother. Having been born a whole twenty minutes before her.  Of course, he would be here if he knew. But Ally wrote reassuring him that all was well. Lies she was forced to say. No one knew. The shame she felt kept her from admitting anything. When this was over. She would swallow her pride and reveal the ugly truth of the last two years.</p><p>Another swig of whiskey, another cigarette, three-thirty in the morning. A sharp crack of apparation near the front door. He was home. His scent drifted into the room like a cold black wind.</p><p>It was too late to back out. Christopher's shadow framed the doorway. Ally knew he could see the red glow of her cigarette.</p><p>"Hmmmph…….. What do you think you're doing, cunt? You think you're smarter than me? You think I don't know what you're thinking…… Bitch, I'm two steps ahead of you…….</p><p>Metal clicked and clacked, and the shell slid into the chamber.</p><p>Christopher moved forward; Ally's brain froze. Terror lodged in her throat if he got ahold of her she was dead. And he would be on her in just a few strides. His arm reached out. The shotgun swung into position, and she squeezed the trigger.</p><p>It was louder than she remembered it being. The stock slammed into her side, knocking the wind from her lungs. Blood rained down with bits of flesh, and his body dropped to the floor. She smiled when she heard the sharp crack of his head, hitting the stone tiles. Ally took a long drag and another sip of the whiskey.</p><p>Christopher moaned, and his hand moved against her leg.</p><p> First, the buckshot, to take them down. Ally smiled, "LUMOS," This time, it echoed in the hallways. Every light in the house came on, rattling the walls. </p><p>Christopher had taken the buckshot to his chest. His tall, dark frame lay writhing, his chest flayed open peppered with the pellets. Ally kicked his hand away and stood up, "What's the matter, Christopher? Did I surprise you?" His brown eyes blinked in shock. Blood bubbled from his lips as he tried to speak.</p><p>The pellets must have reached his lungs, she thought. Leaving him here to drown in his own blood would not be enough. Standing over him now, the shotgun slung over her shoulder. Her anger was slipping into an icy black rage. She could finish him with the slug, but that would be too easy of a death. She thought of her babies, the ones that never had a chance, she thought of the girl she once was, and the future she could have had. This wizard stole that from her, and she would tear him to pieces the muggle way. Then she would burn this house to the ground.</p><p>Ally slid another round into the chamber, pointing it at his right hand. The one he liked to punch her with, and she pulled the trigger. Flesh and bone were no match for the slug, the offending appendage exploded, becoming a puddle of gore. Another round in the chamber and the left fist disappeared. Ally giggled while he roared in pain. Bloody stumps reached for the wand strapped to his hip.</p><p>Ally crouched next to her husband, leaning down to better hear the sputtering from his mouth, "What's that Christopher? You're two steps ahead of me………… So much smarter than I am……Poor dumb British cow, isn't that what your mother calls me?" She took the last long drag off her cigarette, lit another before crushing the butt on his forehead.</p><p>Hissing through his teeth at her, "You'll…..Never……Shhhhh…. Never………," Was all he could manage.</p><p> "Looks like I'm more than two steps ahead of you, mate," Ally plucked the wand from his holster, placed it under her knee, and snapped it in half. Later she would swear it screamed. </p><p>Ally unbuckled his belt and slid it through the loops. She had felt the sting of that leather, and now he would as well. She stripped him down and spread his legs. The first strike flayed the skin from his pathetic limp whiskey dick. The soft, useless cock he blamed her for. As if it were her fault, he couldn't perform. She smashed it with the leather strap, pulverizing every whiskey-soaked memory. His screams stopped, and for a moment, Ally was afraid she might have killed him. This needed to last just a bit longer. She kicked him hard in the thigh, and he groaned. Ally kicked him again in the ribs, feeling a crunch on impact. "Whew… there he is. Thought I lost you there, Luv."</p><p>Ally's hands were steady, every movement cold and calculated as she rolled him over, face down, ass in the air, "Now, my loving husband, I think you're really going to enjoy this." Toys were a favorite with him, for obvious reasons. How many times had he done this to her? That was something else she had lost count of. She grabbed the flower vase and dumped the water over his head, Ally wanted him wide awake for this. She wanted him to feel every centimeter of the shame and degradation of being buggered when you damned well didn't want to be. She wanted to make sure he was found with blood and shite smeared down his thighs.</p><p>Ally grabbed the cord from the curtains and a statue of a Goddess from his desk. Looping the rope around his neck. Still, Ally used no magic but sat between his legs, wasting no time shoving the tall gold statue up his ass. He screamed and lurched forward, tightening the cord. His handsome face twisted in a grotesque mask, blues, and reds, tongue hanging between his teeth. Ally let up on the cord, still too soon for him to die. He had taken everything that she loved and twisted it. Broke her down to where she was helpless and dependent. Never again.</p><p>Rage boiled over, calling up a darkness that she never knew existed. Everything became a blur of deafening screams, sobs, and a death rattle that went on, fading as the sun rose in the sky, and Ally fired the last slug into his face.<br/>
ooOoo</p><p> </p><p>Amycus leaned back in his chair. Having just finished lunch at the local pub with Rabastan and Antonin. The waitress set down three pints when a little house elf popped into the center of the table. Large ears folded over its face, her little voice squeaked, "Buggs is a baddd elf…..bad-elf ……..Mmmmmaster Amycus," Buggs peered out from behind her ears, "Missy …….. Missy Ally……… Missy Ally is being in trouble," Huge tears rolled down her cheeks, "You must come…. Missy Ally needs you."</p><p>Aside from a few random letters, Amycus had not heard from his sister in two years. The letters were full of lies, he wasn't stupid. He felt it. They were twins. He knew when she was happy and when she was sad. But he respected his father's wishes staying away, letting Ally have her space and what their father said was a chance at a happy marriage. She would have been happy with his best mate, Rabastan.</p><p>"Master Amycus, please, Missy Ally needs you," The little elf reached for his hand. Amycus grabbed Rabastan as the elf touched him. Rabastan, in turn, caught Antonin by the sleeve. All four were deposited in a heap on the front lawn of the Leonardis Estate.</p>
