    <p>The moonlight shone down on the street, illuminating all in its path, bathing objects in a light, silvery glow. The looming building of the orphanage stood, a solid mass amongst the rubbish.</p><p>At first, you would not suspect anything different. It looked ordinary enough. A small bundle of bins huddled together in a corner, along with the lingering smell of the curry takeaway. The only thing that might strike you as unusual was the odd stench of what could be classed as gunpowder, and the chilling cold, which seemed to suck the happiness out of you. A tabby cat, with peculiar markings around the eyes, was prowling round, as if on the lookout for something.</p><p>Or someone.</p><p>Slowly, but surely, a small revving of a baby’s cry started, a lost, lonely wail shattering the silence. The cat’s ears pricked up, turning in the direction of the noise. It seemed to be coming from the dustbins.</p><p>It padded over, it’s soft paws making no noise, and gently slunk into the middle. It gave a small ‘meow’ and the infant stopped.</p><p>The child couldn’t have been more than one, a small baby, with two grey eyes and a layer of reddish hair already upon it’s skull.</p><p>The cat blinked, and suddenly, where it had sat, stood a tall woman, her face boring the many years of her life. Her grey hair was pulled into a tight bun, hidden under an emerald pointed hat, the exact shade of the long cloak she wore over her matching robes. She reached down and picked the infant up, who felt icy cold in her arms. Conjuring a black blanket out of thin air, she wrapped the child in it.</p><p>Suddenly, a street lamp went out, closely followed by another. While most people would have been fazed, even possibly scared, the woman marched confidently towards the elderly man, who seemed to be putting what looked like a silver lighter away.</p><p>“Good evening, Professor McGonagall. Or should I say, good morning?” he chuckled, indicating the tall clock, which proudly proclaimed it to be half past one in the morning, “Sherbet Lemon?”</p><p>“I am quite certain that I do not want a sherbet lemon, Albus.” She declined for the second time they had met under the velvet sky.</p><p>He gave a sad chuckle, and placed the back away. “So, here we are, with another lost child.”</p><p>“Is it true, then?” she whispered, “did he really betray them?”</p><p>“You are holding the proof, my dear Minerva.” He said gently.</p><p>She looked down at the child, who was staring at Albus with some interest.</p><p>“So, here we have little Secret.” He said, taking the child off her.</p><p>‘Where will she go Albus?’ asked McGonagall, “surely, not here?”</p><p>She indicated the bleak Orphanage.</p><p>“No. I think, I know exactly where to take her. I know just the man.” Said Dumbledore softly.</p><p>“Surely not him? Albus, he was one of his most trusted – she could be in so much danger if he – do you honestly trust him?”</p><p>“I would trust him with my life. And he is gone. She has nothing to fear.” Reassured Dumbledore firmly.</p><p>He turned on the spot, vanishing with a pop! Minerva sighed, before following suit.</p><p>Upon arriving at their destination, Dumbledore swept off towards a small street. A dirty, worn sign told them humbly they were on Spinner’s End.</p><p>Stopping outside a door, Albus raised a fist and knocked on the door. For a while, they stood in silence.</p><p>Then, the door opened. A man stood there, his sallow faced curtained by his hair.</p><p>“Albus, Minerva. What brings you here?”</p><p>He then saw Secret, who had fallen asleep. His eyes widened, and he stood back to let them in.</p><p>They entered a dark room. Snape motioned for them to sit on the sofa, himself taking the armchair up. His eyes never left the girl.</p><p>“So, as you might have guessed Severus, Lily and James were betrayed. During these events, Secret has lost both her parents and her brother.” Said Dumbledore.</p><p>Snape nodded slowly, his gaze still transfixed on Secret.</p><p>“So, that leaves her with no where to go.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded. “Yes, Severus.”</p><p>The man thought for a moment, before looking to Dumbledore.</p><p>“Why?” he asked.</p><p>“She needs love. And of us all, you are best suited, despite what you think. You know of the power she will have – she will need stability and instruction on how to best channel it. And of her family, you know the best how to approach it.”</p><p>Snape paused, before he gave a sigh, that revealed his fears, worries, and wonders in one breath</p><p>“I’ll take her.”</p><p>McGonagall looked shocked for a moment, but quickly recomposed herself. Albus stood up and handed the infant over. “Take good care of her, Severus.”</p><p>He nodded, and watched the two leave. On his windowsill a crow stood, watching the two. He gave a low caw before flying off, leaving Snape holding the child whom he had just sworn to protect.</p>
