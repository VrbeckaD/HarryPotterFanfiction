    <strong>Extended Summary: </strong>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Sorry? What? Oh, what's a normal day in the life of moi?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> Ha well, um, chaos. A few buildings crashing down here and there (caused by some big green thing), a few random bad guys wanting to take over (from a galaxy far far away), about a thousand aliens plus other life forms, the occasional world destroying disease, some random rich person (usually from the government) creating a really overcomplicated plan, and once every blue moon, a good ending. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I'm joking, Gila, it's not always that hectic. Well, okay, about 98.999 % of the time, it is. Percy would say i'm exaggerating, and it's definitely not as bad as a demigod's, but I reckon they would be like 97.999 %. Only because demigods don't have to remember so many things about so many different people. For example, they don't need to remember: </em>
</p><p>
  <em>A) When isn't a good time to go for a swim in the TARDIS pool because the Family of Blood are chasing you, (The Doctor said the pool had never been such an inconvenience before). </em>
</p><p>
  <em>B) That magic is illegal in Camelot so trying to heal an injured ladybird on the floor, could get you arrested... (it was screaming really loudly and I was attempting Surds... bad combination)</em>
</p><p>
  <em> C) All heroes' backgrounds and futures and the many reasons why I should "shut up" in tight situations according to Alex. (Alex, Alex, not Alex Fierro). </em>
</p><p>
  <em>D) the many HP wizard spells to pass your OWL and that Fa magic is not allowed in the exam. (I did some for Transfiguration anyway).</em>
</p><p>
  <em> And E) Never forget there are always more Worlds than you think there are, never jump down a bottomless pit, never tell Liv I hid her knives in the fridge, never tell Isla she's been carrying a rotten banana ever since That Guy, don't ever break the fourth wall aaanddd oh yh! Remember to fill in the pages!</em>
