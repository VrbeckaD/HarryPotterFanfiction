</p><p>Most people would be surprised to learn that Hermione Granger is secretly a sensualist. She likes soft textures in her robes and rich flavors on her tongue. Sometimes she pets Crookshanks for hours while reading a book, wallowing in the warm softness of his fur and the scent of paper and ink. Unfortunately at Hogwarts she’d been too busy learning and surviving to do more than occasionally treat herself. Indulging that side of herself becomes a reward instead of a habit.</p><p>After the war, she works hard to learn the rules about what it means to be seen as a successful adult in Wizarding Britain. It’s a lot less clear than the rules at Hogwarts. There isn’t time to indulge herself and, frankly, she doesn’t feel like she deserves it. So many people had died in the war or were still suffering and by most measures of success, she’s barely getting by instead of excelling. Hermione loves rules and feels safest when following them, but she struggles with finding an authority that she trusts, much less people worth following. The Ministry isn’t trustworthy but that’s where all the interesting jobs are so that’s where she works. </p><p>A lot of rules in Wizarding society are unspoken but what gets written down she tries to follow. It feels safer that way and after the war she desperately craves safety, so much so that she’s willing to compromise and experiment in areas her younger self refused to. And it doesn’t matter if she thinks a lot of the rules are stupid because the people in power don’t agree and they’re the ones who can make her life more difficult and less safe. </p><p>So for months, she dresses in <em> Witch Weekly </em> ’s pick for the most fashionable robes (structured with stiff and scratchy wool) and boots (with four-inch kitten heels and pointy toes that pinch no matter what charms she uses) and the pungent rose perfume polling as most popular in the lifestyle section of <em> The Daily Prophet </em> (that makes her gag and try to hold her breath for the first ten minutes after putting it on). She’s been making herself miserable but it’s not like this is the first time in her life she’s done that to achieve success. She’s tracking how often she gets invited to impromptu meetings on influential projects, called on to submit ideas at work, and the percentage of people who seek her out instead of avoiding her in social situations. The numbers show a statistically significant increase since she instituted her fashionable changes. Bullying is also trending down. She overhears compliments from both her supervisor in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures (“Granger’s smartly-dressed and smartly-spoken”) and Ron (“She looks like the girlfriends on the magazine covers”), so she feels like she has to keep going. She’s not exactly happy, but she’s fitting in better than she ever had at school.</p><p>She tells herself that life is going well.</p><p>Then Harry gets her alone and tells her to stop it. </p><p>“I—I don’t know what you’re talking about.” She can’t meet his eyes. They’re this piercing green in the sun and feel like they’re stripping back her layers until she’s too hot, like she’s naked. It’s not a bad feeling, but it does make her want things she’s not supposed to want. “No one else has complained.”</p><p>“Then no one else watches you like I do.” That makes her feel even more exposed. She likes the feeling, which is unfortunate since she knows Harry’s doing it unintentionally. “Seriously Hermione, stop. You’re making yourself unhappy by following stupid rules you don’t need and I won’t stand for it. I know for a fact that you don’t like scratchy wool robes or the scent of roses. Wear what makes you feel good, you’ve earned that. Out of everyone, you deserve to be happy. Now, I’m taking you shopping and I won’t take no for an answer.”</p><p>Which just goes to show that as close as Harry watches, he doesn’t see everything. There was never a chance she’d tell him no and shopping’s a lot more innocuous than a prison break, bank theft, or defying a mass-murdering Dark Lord.</p><p>Harry takes Hermione to a small boutique she’s never heard of called<em> Peppermint and Pearl. </em>She recognizes the logo on the door from the scented candle Harry gave her during a stressful work project last month. Putting hands on her shoulders, Harry guides her inside to a rack of both sumptuous and chic looking robes along the wall. When she can’t help but sigh, “Ohhh,” in appreciation, she can feel Harry’s quiet laugh rumbling from where his chest is pressed against her shoulder blades.</p><p>Putting his mouth by her ear, Harry orders her to, “Shop with your senses, ‘Mione,” before sliding his hands down her arms and stepping back. Sometimes when he calls her that she hears the words <em> my own </em> instead of her name. She always makes sure to silently add the words "<em>best friend" </em> so she takes it in the spirit he means. Hermione likes being Harry’s best friend. She won’t mess that up, not to mention she’s got a boyfriend.</p><p>After running her hands across the rack of soft and sumptuous materials with pleasure, she notices that none of the robes have the have prices listed. Harry sees her looking and rolls his eyes, “Don’t think about price, think about comfort. It won’t be a problem. I promise.” When he refuses to say anything further even with her hard look, she huffs and gives in, picking out new robes in silk, linen, and cashmere that make her fingertips tingle and her throat want to purr. </p><p>Hermione could keep petting the fabrics for longer but the facing aisle seduces her with smells both sophisticated and exotic. Harry whisks the clothing out of her arms and hands her an empty basket to fill with perfumes and lotions. Embracing the experience, Hermione picks out a French Lilac lotion that makes her shoulders unknot just looking at the picture on the label of lilac bushes budding and swaying in a soft breeze. The scent is delicate and sweet. She loves it and drops it into the basket. She adds an energizing body spray with notes of grapefruit, lemon, and rosemary that smells like three friends playing ring-around-the-rosies and giggling. Hermione could happily pick out ten more bottles but she doesn’t really need them so she makes herself step away.</p><p>Tutting in disapproval, Harry reappears at her side and slides a jar of the boutique’s Signature Peppermint Pearl Body Butter into her basket.</p><p>“I don’t need that,” she protests weakly.</p><p>“Maybe,” he shrugs, “but you know you want it. Peppermint makes you smile and relax, especially around bedtime and deadlines. You love peppermint.”</p><p>“Okay fine, but that’s enough. Really, Harry.”</p><p>“Nope.” Smirking, Harry disappears into the back of the store.</p><p>“Harry!” she whispers loudly, trying to get him back without venturing deeper into the shelves or calling the attention of the shopkeeper. She doesn’t need more temptation. This is almost as bad as a bookstore, maybe worse because she lets herself go crazy in bookstores because she finds it easier to rationalize indulging her mind than indulging her body. She’s probably already spent too much today. She doesn’t really need more and it’s not like she’s done anything special lately to deserve nice things.</p><p>When Harry returns, he’s cradling three jewel-toned bottles in his arms. “Hermione, you have to get these!” </p><p>“I don’t need three—” she looks at the labels “—bottles of bubble bath.” </p><p>“But no, see, they’re like a vacation in a jar. The bubbles and foam create landscapes of plants and animals and even soothing sounds and scents while you bathe. This is Jade Jungle, Carnelian Cruise, and Amethyst Adventure.”</p><p>“How alliterative,” she says dryly, barely restraining a smile at his enthusiasm.</p><p>Harry leans forward as if about to impart a secret. “You haven’t even heard the best part. They make you feel like you’re floating in <em> whipped cream </em>.” Biting his lip, he widens his eyes, the rings around his irises a gray-green jade that matches the bubble bath in his arms.</p><p>Hermione knows she’s beaten but can’t help one last attempt. “You and Ron are the ones with the frankly unhealthy obsession with whipped cream, not me. I don’t think you can eat bubble bath.”</p><p>Looking forlornly at the bottles in his arms, he sighs. “I suppose we can just buy two bottles instead of all three.”</p><p>Snorting a giggle, Hermione leans against Harry’s shoulder until he meets her eyes. “How about one for each of us. That way you can try it out too and we can compare notes.”</p><p>“Deal.” Harry’s teeth flash in a way that looks just a little too pleased and makes her wonder if she’s just been played. “You take the Jade and I’ll take the Carnelian.” He dumps them in her basket. “I’ll put back the Amethyst while you try on these.” Harry crouches down and pulls out a pair of luxurious suede boots he’d hidden just around the corner. </p><p>Scratch that, she’s definitely just been played. Before she can start scolding he dumps them in her arms and darts away. Sitting down on a bench, she sighs and picks up the boots with the intention of finding a flaw to justify why she’s not buying them. </p><p>She forgot her weakness for suede. </p><p>Hermione spends the next five minutes petting the boots, discovering that not only is the suede velvety but that the inside lining feels like kitten fur. She feels like purring herself. She only slips them on her feet to prove they can’t possibly as comfortable as they feel. She’s wrong. They feel like walking on custard, soft and enveloping without any of the unpleasant squishing between the toes (and she knows about that thanks to kitchen magic gone wrong, thank you, Ron Weasley). </p><p>Basket overflowing, Hermione goes to pay the shopkeeper, unwilling to take off the suede boots now she’s put them on but determined to leave before Harry finds even more things she just can’t live without because she knows that whatever he shows up with next <em> she’s going to buy </em>. The fact that this makes her smile is just more reason to leave now, while she can. As it is she braces herself for the cost of all these luxuries. </p><p>Hermione doesn’t think about how suspicious it is that Harry never returned during her five minutes of suede boot petting until the shopkeeper packages up her purchases and hands the bags right over, saying, “The gentleman already took care of the bill.”</p><p>Eyes narrowing, Hermione whips around to find Harry lurking outside the window. He pretends he doesn’t see her looking. “Oh did he.”</p><p>“Have a nice day,” the shopkeeper tells her, failing to restrain an amused smile. </p><p>Marching outside, Hermione wallops Harry in the side with her bags. He’s laughing, the wretch. “You can’t just pay for all my things!”</p><p>Throwing his arm over her shoulder to keep from being hit again, Harry takes her bags and directs them back the way they’d come. “I think there’s a bakery down this way. You can pay me back with a treacle tart.”</p><p>Hermione spends the rest of the afternoon trying to convince Harry to tell her how much he just spent on her so she can pay him back. When Harry gets tired of her nagging he throws up his arms with a groan. “Okay, you know what? Nothing about today was a problem for me. It was all a pleasure I can easily afford. You wanna pay me back? Seeing you happier would pay me back. Do that and we’re even, because I know you’d do the same for me.” </p><p>And there’s nothing she can say to that except huff and hide a smile against the arm she’s wrapping her hands around as they walk down the street.</p><p>After that, and in response to Harry’s urging, she slowly starts indulging herself more. Hermione makes a list of things she enjoys and starts letting herself have them, just because she can instead of making herself earn it every time. She thinks about what she really wants, and then about what she can actually have, and focuses on the second part of her list while trying to ignore the things culled from things from the first. It mostly works. </p><p>However, as she becomes happier she looks up and realizes that sometimes Ron… isn’t. Harry isn’t very happy either, but Harry’s happiness is an ongoing project she’d been working on for years. She has bullet-point lists of long- and short-term plans for Harry that she revises quarterly. There’s always been a lot about Ron that needs fixing but since Ron is a simpler man with simpler problems than Harry she thinks (hopes) Ron might be easier to make happy. </p><p>Her optimism doesn’t work out. Ron seems simple but scratch the surface and he gets complicated or at least stubbornly difficult. It would be easy if Ron would just tell her what he needs to make him happy (besides whipped cream, quidditch, and wizarding chess), but when she asks, Ron doesn’t even know what he wants. That or he says one thing and contradicts himself a few minutes or days later. He’s not a man into introspection, so he doesn’t even notice when he does it. </p><p>She loves Ron but dating him is frustrating. She wants him to be certain about himself and he’s not, always comparing himself to other people. Ron’s rarely comfortable in his own skin. That means he’s not the rock she wishes he was—the rock she needs. It’s a selfish thought so she doesn’t ever say it out loud. Sometimes when Ron is talking about something random he thinks is important he gets this look on his face that says there are things he wishes about her that he’s not saying too. She doesn’t ask. It feels like an unspoken rule for keeping their relationship healthy.</p><p>They’ve dated for over a year but they’re taking everything slow. They haven’t moved in together or had sex. It just doesn’t seem urgent. She’s content to wait and, somewhat surprisingly, so is Ron (at least when he’s thinking with his head and not his privates). Neither of them wants her to be another Molly Weasley with seven children. Ron definitely doesn’t want seven children. Sometimes she thinks he doesn’t want kids at all, at least not for a couple of decades at least, but they haven’t talked about that either. Growing up with all the crowding, competition, hand-me-downs, and poverty is something he’s always resented. Hermione’s not ready for kids either, but she’d like one or two once her career is established, maybe even as soon as her thirties. </p><p>She and Ron love each other, but there are problems in their relationship and sex isn’t the solution. They don’t talk about those problems but they are definitely there. She’d rather fix at least a few of the problems she’s already identified before adding more to the list. Besides, if she’s being completely honest, while it’s nice and fun to snuggle and make out, no matter how excited Ron sometimes gets (even with her rule of no touching below the belt), she never manages to feel a matching urgency. The sparks when they kiss never find enough tinder to turn into flames. Secretly she wonders if she’s just not made for passion, at least not the physical kind. It isn’t something she feels like she can talk to Ron about without hurting his feelings and having him make it all about himself instead of about her so she reads a lot of books and tries to be patient with herself and hope it sorts out later. Despite the popular perception, they’re not the only young couple who’s waiting to have sex, so at least she isn’t alone in that. That she doesn’t find it a challenge to keep to celibacy may not be as normal but there are only so many things she can worry about on any given day and that isn’t even in the top twenty.</p><p>One Saturday Ron unexpectedly asks her to go ring shopping to get an idea of what style they’d both like. “Maybe we’re both hesitating over things too much and making this more difficult than it needs to be. More commitment might actually fix a lot of our problems.” </p><p>She feels bad for underestimating Ron and thinking he hadn’t noticed all of the problems in their relationship too. She’s not sure rings are the answer, but she doesn’t have a better idea and she’s always sort of expected to marry Ron one day so she agrees. They look at a few shops but can’t settle on anything.</p><p>It’s a coincidence that she’s scheduled to call her parents on a muggle payphone later that day. Her parents live in New Zealand and only talk to her a couple of times a year. The relationship is distant because they have nothing in common now. However, they still care about each other and her parents wish her good luck. Hermione’s earliest memories are learning to love books at her mother’s knee. </p><p>So it’s not a complete surprise that less than an hour later she receives the hand-couriered book <em> Premarital Questions Every Couple Should Ask </em>. She’s surprised to find that some (most) of the questions are things she’s never really thought about. She certainly hasn’t discussed them with Ron. Reading the book over three times, she writes down all of her answers on a fat scroll. </p><p>The following Monday she drags them both over to Ron’s flat along with takeout. Ron can barely afford the flat on his joke shop salary but he’s so vocal about how he loves living alone for the first time in his life that she’s given up on nagging him to get a roommate to share the cost. Since her salary is higher she tries to pay for food to help things out.</p><p>Ron frowns as he reads the first foot of scroll with noodles hanging out of his mouth. He finally slurps them in before announcing that he disagrees with more than half of her answers. They look at each other uncomfortably and flip to the list of household duties. That one’s even worse, though at least the last question makes both of them laugh when they agree that no normal human being would ever want to do that one. </p><p>“I guess we both made assumptions,” she tells Ron. She doesn’t spell out that they were different assumptions because that part’s obvious. </p><p>Realizing how late it is and that they have work the next day, she gets up to leave. Biting her lip, she leaves the book and scroll with Ron to go through on his own. Knowing how he is about homework, she doesn’t expect him to do much with it unless she nags.</p><p>Work is crazy that week so she doesn’t have time to nag.</p><p>On Saturday, Ron invites her over for brunch. Wanting to both feel comfortable and look attractive, she smooths on her french lilac lotion and wears one of her new outfits: a burgundy velvet boatneck top and dusty blue silk skirt paired with silver-gray robes. A braided rose gold choker covers the red scar slicing across her neck and she pulls her curls back in a french twist. Ron makes her sweetened oatmeal, fried sausages, and tea—the extent of his culinary powers. Conversation is nice. Easy. </p><p>Afterward, they go into the living room to continue talking and Hermione notices her book and scroll sitting out. She’s surprised to see that the book is now dogeared and has two breaks in the spine. The scroll is unrolled over the table and draped across the floor. Ron has scribbled in the margins of the scroll with words and arrows and diagrams, sometimes writing sideways or upside-down, so much so that the paper almost looks black in several places. </p><p>“Huh, you really did work on it.” The fact that he’d done it without any nagging actually makes her nervous.</p><p>Ron’s sideways smile quickly fades into something serious. He gestures at the couch and they both sit down. The secondhand couch sags and slides them sideways, but they’re both used to adjusting so they don’t get swallowed. Ron licks his lips. “Hermione, I read your scroll all the way through. You’re amazing, like super amazing.”</p><p>She squints at him with the beginning of a confused smile. “Thanks.”</p><p>“And I am too, just not in the same way. Like, at all. We’re very different people.”</p><p>Hermione’s confusion turns to worry. She bites her lip. He’s not wrong but—“You are amazing, Ron, an amazing friend and amazing person. That’s one of the reasons I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too, but maybe… maybe we’re better off loving each other without being <em> in love </em> with each other.”</p><p>Hermione blinks. Opens and closes her mouth. Looks down at her lap. Rewinds what he just said. It’s a shock, though he’s not wrong about this either, it just isn’t what she expected him to say. At all. The rules for breaking up with someone call for screaming, hexes, and angry tears, but that doesn’t fit this situation at all. She doesn’t know what to say.</p><p>“Hermione, you have needs and wants that I’m not sure I can meet. I’m not sure I even want to meet them. To do that I’d have to change and compromise and honestly I’d rather not, no matter how selfish that makes me sound. You deserve better. I also want, no, I <em> need </em> to be in a relationship where I’m good enough as is instead of always being someone you think you need to fix. There’s a girl out there that will want that, but it isn’t you. I deserve better. I want someone who will put me first and love me best.”</p><p>“Ron—” she starts to protest automatically, but his next words cut her off at the knees.</p><p>“Don’t, Hermione. Just don’t. I know we both tried our best, but it’s time to face facts. Besides, if nothing else my bed’s only big enough for two, not three.” </p><p>Hermione sucks in her breath but refuses to otherwise flinch. </p><p>“It is what it is.” Ron shrugs one shoulder with unexpected maturity. “Add in the books and the evil cat—who still gives me stink face when you’re not looking—and my entire bed’s gonna collapse under the weight. We’re better off sticking to the livingroom and avoiding that mess. Besides, I’m just not that kinky. Unlike you, vanilla’s more my style.” He forces a smile and wags his brows. </p><p>Hermione feels her cheeks turn pink. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” </p><p>“I don’t always ignore the things you’re reading.” Ron winks. “And some of that stuff is definitely on the kinky side of I-don’t-want-to-know. </p><p>She looks down and straightens the seam of her skirt. Theoretical knowledge is still just theoretical. Just because she finds certain ideas interesting doesn’t mean she’ll ever do them. She’s probably even more boring than vanilla because even kissing rarely gets her very excited. (That she’d only kissed Viktor and Ron by choice and Cormac McLaggan against her will wasn’t an amazing sample size but she was also twenty years old and not some girl on the cusp of puberty.) </p><p>Ron stands up. “Now, I just remembered I have whipped cream. Maybe some berries too. Is your stomach up for another round? Another round as… friends?” Swallowing hard, the first sign she’s seen that this is difficult for him, Ron holds out his hand. </p><p>Not hesitating, Hermione takes his fingers and lets him pull her to her feet. She swallows hard too. “Yeah, I’m glad I have a friend like you, Ron Weasley.” Her eyes sting. As soon as he releases her hand she can’t help but surge forward and throw her arms around his neck in a hug. She’s trying not to cry but a few tears escape anyway.</p><p>Ron hugs her back tightly, almost too tightly, before abruptly letting go and stepping back. He sounds a little winded. “C’mon, Hermione, it’s <em> whipped cream </em>. If I didn’t like you so much I’d just eat it all myself.”</p><p>Laughing wetly, she wipes her eyes. “And if I didn’t like <em> you </em> so much I’d let you and leave you with the stomach ache.”</p><p>And that was that. Still friends for life but no longer anything more than that. She feels both relief and loss. She doesn’t have a plan for this.</p><p>Later that night, alone in her bed, she tosses and turns over what happened, feeling restless and unanchored. Also guilty. What Ron had left unsaid is the fact that Harry is first in her heart and they both know it, even if Harry himself seems clueless. She’s never explicitly said it out loud, but Hermione will always put Harry first, both above Ron and above herself. It’s a choice she’s made so often that it’s become a central pillar of her life, one she never saw coming but doesn’t regret pitching her tent under. She’s broken rules for Harry, willingly abandoned safety and sanity to follow him into danger and possible detention, imprisonment, and death. Even when Hermione thought herself in love with Ron she’d still watched him storm off alone in rage instead of following him so she could stay by Harry’s side, despite how many tears she shed while Ron was out of her sight in mortal danger. At the final battle, she’d offered to go and confront Voldemort with Harry even knowing she’d probably die too. </p><p>Hermione has lost track of how many times she’s offered to follow Harry. Sometimes he takes her up on it, sometimes he doesn’t. Either way he never quite seems to consciously get it, doesn’t get that she’s utterly devoted. He never hesitates to call on her, so at least he has to instinctively know. The main reason she never says anything out loud is Harry doesn’t seem to want that level of devotion and responsibility and she refuses to be one more person forcing her expectations on him. </p><p>Within six months of the breakup, a new minister is elected to the Ministry because Kingsley Shaklebolt is stepping down to devote more time to his family. At least that’s the story. She hopes it’s true and he wasn’t blackmailed into quitting. She’s powerless to do anything about it one way or another so Harry and Ron tell her to let it go.</p><p>Then Harry’s on-again-off-again relationship with Ginny ends for good with a very public row (with the traditional screaming, hexing, and tears) that gets Harry sent to Saint Mungo’s for the night (he’s a chivalrous idiot who refused to go full out against his girlfriend and mistakenly believed she’d have the same scruples). All the papers are salivating, especially when just four weeks later Ginny falls into a whirlwind romance with Adebamgbe Botmang, the heir to a wizarding shipping company. He puts a ring the size of a snitch on her finger and she disappears to Nigeria to get to know his family. </p><p>Instead of acting sad about Ginny, Harry takes up dating like it’s his new favorite sport. His maturity and confidence make him a star player and very popular with the ladies. He never settles down with one girl for more than a month but from what she can see everyone seems to be having a good time. </p><p>After a private meeting with the retired Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt, Harry drops out of the Auror academy without explanation. He’s obviously upset about it be just as obviously doesn’t want to talk. A few weeks later he starts working freelance jobs for Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and Gringotts Bank, jobs that seem mostly about problem-solving and acquisitions, which is doublespeak for dangerous thrill-seeking and back-street fighting. Hermione gets a promotion right after, so she’s too busy to worry as much as she wants to.</p><p>For almost a year, everyone is almost happy.</p><p>Then the new Minister of Magic takes a bump in the polls and looks around for something to elevate his image. He remembers Harry’s existence as The-Boy-Who-Lived and Savior-of-the-Wizarding-World and realizes Harry isn’t tucked safely in the Ministry’s Auror Academy under his thumb anymore. He starts nagging Harry about what he’s expected to do for Britain and what he can say in public and basically trying to manipulate him into working for the Ministry again and being the Minister’s personal flunky. When Harry digs in his heels and politely but very VERY firmly says no (i.e. go to hell), the Minister retaliates by releasing private and painful details about Harry’s childhood and tells the press that Harry’s choosing not to serve the British wizarding people because he’s too fragile and immature. The press loves the scandal and starts manufacturing interest pieces about fragile Harry‘s problems like they’re all competing with Rita Skeeter and there’s a prize at the end. The British wizarding public goes back to either hero-worshipping, vilifying, or treating Harry like a leper. </p><p>It’s infuriating and really, really, sad.</p><p>Harry veers from almost okay to completely miserable. She never sees him out in public without his stoic face anymore. He starts losing weight. Hermione checks out more books from the library, reads up on healthy coping mechanisms, and stages an intervention. It sort of works. Harry stops starving himself and instead embraces the control and peace found in physical exercise, putting on muscle like he’s thinking of entering a wrestling competition. She appreciates the view. Unfortunately, exercise isn’t enough.</p><p>Harry’s still dating, but the average length of his relationships drops from a month to a week. He doesn’t even talk about his dates with her anymore. She only knows that much about it because the tabloids keep such close track of his life. At least the women mostly all have good things to say about him, so Harry’s doing something right. She tells herself that she’s not jealous or curious about the details and that she’d stop paying attention except Harry doesn’t seem to be having fun with it anymore and that makes her worried. Ron knows more because he meets girls in the same sort of clubs but he refuses to tell her much about it because she’s his ex. </p><p>Hermione doesn’t visit the clubs herself because she’s not sure she wants a boyfriend right now on top of all the other problems she’s juggling. Besides, every time she dips even a toe into the dating pool she runs into Cormac McLaggen, who refuses to accept that she doesn’t want to date him and always corners her whenever she goes out. He’s slipped a potion into her drink at least once that she knows of at a work party. She keeps it quiet from everyone, even Harry and Ron, out of shame and because she was blackmailed into it. Cormac’s family is influential enough in the Ministry that she can’t do anything permanent to him without risking her job. They’re also very convincing with their not-quite-threats and know to include what might happen to Harry and Ron if she publicly bad-mouths the favored son. She suspects Cormac’s tried to potion her again but she can’t prove it, though she did see him holding her drink the last and final time she tried going out to a club. If she had a burning desire to date she might take the time to think up a better solution to the Cormac problem, but since she doesn’t she’s found that avoiding him works about as well as it did with the bullies at school, meaning that she’s occasionally inconvenienced but pretends she doesn’t care and tries to reserve her energy for more important things.</p><p>Like how Harry’s starting to crack and underneath his manners and stoicism is someone a little mean and a lot mad and willing to do insane things with no regard to his personal safety. Harry needs a new challenge to dominate. Right now he’s searching for something worthwhile. She’s afraid of what might happen if he doesn’t find it soon.</p><p>Despite her best efforts, Hermione can’t keep up with—much less fix—all of Harry’s problems. Her bullet point lists end up in the trash. Useless. Head in her hands, she comes to the realization that there are just too many problems entrenched in too many people and institutions. Nothing they’ve done burns them out of Wizarding Britain for long and <em> Merlin knows </em>she’s done things that would get her arrested or worse if they ever came out. Heartsore, Hermione finally decides that if she can’t get rid of Harry’s problems, Harry’s going to have to get rid of Wizarding Britain. </p><p>Sitting Harry down with a treacle tart and a mug that’s half hot chocolate and half whipped cream, she suggests Harry try applying for a job internationally. He resists at first, but when he finally (inevitably) gives in a few days later, she reaches into her purse and whips out the magical job ads from major newspapers in Paris, Rome, Prague, and Berlin. She has Kyoto, Vancouver, Washington D.C., and Bogotá too, but doesn’t want to overwhelm him on his first day of looking. Harry wipes a hand down his face, laughs silently, and takes her highlighters to start circling anything that looks even remotely interesting. </p><p>Harry, being silly and humble (not to mention abused by most of the authority figures in his life), expects rejection as a matter of course, especially from people not raised to kiss up to the fake legend of Harry Potter, and hems and haws over mailing anything off. She and Ron just look at each other and roll their eyes every time he brings it up. It takes another week of daily nagging to get him to send anything off. Harry’s the only one shocked when a few days later a flock of exhausted international owls bombards his window like a hail storm, each carrying an eager offer to hire him, some from companies and places he didn’t even apply to.</p><p>Surprisingly, Ron and Hermione both favor Harry taking a job with a quidditch club. Quidditch is something Harry would both be good at and enjoy, not to mention the only danger is from a sports injury instead of Dark Wizards and backstabbing politicians. Ron suggests Wizarding Berlin in Germany for the nightlife. Hermione likes Wizarding Sofia in Bulgaria because the libraries were amazing when she visited Victor Krum last winter and she’s eager to go back. Both Harry and Ron twitch when she mentions Krum and she realizes her tactical error too late when Harry firmly states he’s not interested in Bulgaria. Pouting, she picks up the Berlin offer. At least it includes a good medical package and she has a few contacts there that might be willing to hire her. </p><p>Harry, unfortunately, barely considers the safe and fun quidditch job in Wizarding Berlin before honing in on the job offer most likely to get him killed. It comes from the International Confederation of Wizards or ICW, who want to train him to become one of their mysterious and elite special magical investigators (SMIs) who troubleshoot wizarding problems all over the world. Hermione’s not happy but she wants to be supportive so she listens as Harry reads from the letter, “Becoming an SMI requires six months of classwork at the ICW academy, which switches countries every few years to remain impartial. If you pass academy finals you will be taken out for three months of intensive private training, including wilderness survival, at a secret location. Trainees who get that far will be sent to the final trials. Graduates are guaranteed work with the ICW for at least two years.”</p><p>“I’ve heard that most people flunk out,” Hermione warns him. </p><p>Harry doesn’t seem deterred. “I’m not most people.”</p><p>Reading over his shoulder, she worries her lower lip with her teeth. “The rate of injury is insanely high.”</p><p>Ron just laughs when Harry says, “So? It sounds fun.” </p><p>They’re both lunatics. Of course Harry loves the idea of being an SMI. He’d always wanted to be an Auror until Kingsley pulled him aside for that private talk.</p><p>Speaking of which—“You never did tell us what Minister Shacklebolt said to make you quit the Auror academy.”</p><p>Shrugging moodily, Harry looks down and smooths out the creased letter against his leg. “Since he retired from the Ministry, Kingsley said he felt like he no longer needed to protect the institution at the cost of its members—or something along those lines—and that someone should lay out the mire of Ministry politics for me and make it clear that in the current climate there was no way I’d escape being used by the people in power for their own ends. That I could embrace that and have one sort of career or reject it and be shunted off into another, but that the life of a normal Auror out fighting dark wizards was never going to be mine. Neither option appealed to me, so I quit before it got too late to do so without collateral damage.”</p><p>“Ooh, big word,” Ron tells him, trying to break the tension.</p><p>Hermione worries the silky edge of her opposite cuff between her fingers. “What if the ICW is just as bad as Britain when it comes to corruption?”</p><p>Ron snorts. “That’s your pessimism talking.” </p><p>Harry looks out the window as if seeing something more than gray clouds and yellow-green trees. “It could be, but what if the ICW is so much better? I’d get to see the world and do amazing things helping people and stopping dark wizards as an SMI.” He turns back. “Don’t forget that Dumbledore was the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW for a while.”</p><p>“Dumbledore also thought it was okay to keep vitally important information from you and sacrifice your life for the greater good,” she says scathingly—though when she ignores what he did to Harry she admires and misses the Headmaster too. Sighing, she drops her head back to glare up at the ceiling. “But from what I’ve read the ICW academy and SMI department both have good reputations amongst former employees, current employees often being sworn to secrecy depending on the nature of their work and notoriously tight-lipped even when drunk.” </p><p>“I want to go for it,” Harry says decisively. </p><p>When Hermione looks over she finds him staring back at her, waiting. She’s not sure what for but she gives him her full support. Ron chimes in with the same. Harry starts composing his acceptance letter right away. It’s the first time she’s seen Harry excited about something in months which makes her feel excited too. They send the letter to the ICW first thing in the morning. </p><p>It’s inevitable that rumors would start up about Harry leaving Britain. The Ministry of Magic panics. They try to bribe, guilt, and threaten Harry into staying by turns. Hermione and Ron enlist all of their friends and allies to help run interference for Harry, managing to hide a good chunk of the ugliness from him altogether. At least she thinks they do. What Harry does see makes the lines on his face deepen but also makes him more determined to leave than ever. </p><p>Early on, Luna suggests in a roundabout way involving a metaphor about a creature that may or may not really exist that they lie to everyone about Harry’s departure date to prevent any last-minute travel “accidents.” Everyone looks at each other grimly and jumps on the idea. The Ministry is still panicking but they dial back the assaults because they think they have until Christmas break to maneuver things to their liking, not a bare two weeks.</p><p>Although Hermione just got another promotion she has no qualms about offering to quit her job and move with Harry to whatever city is secretly hosting the ICW academy. Of course she does. It’s <em> Harry </em>.</p><p>Harry’s torn by her offer, she can tell by the way he runs his wand through his fingers for a few minutes in thought, but in the end, he tells her no. He says that because of the secretive nature of his training he won’t be able to see much of her even if she does come along. Besides, he doesn’t want to ruin the good thing she’s building at work. </p><p>Hermione thinks about begging him to let her come anyway, thinks about just showing up one day outside his rooms in a fait accompli, but she doesn’t want her presence serving as a constant drag and reminder of the problems he’s fighting so hard to escape. She wonders if Harry secretly wants a clean break. She doesn’t ask because it would hurt if he said yes. She gives up on moving with him but makes him promise to let her visit at least once a year if not every holiday because she’s not as unselfish as she tries to be. She knows that going more than a year without seeing him would make her depressed and miserable. At the end of the day, she wants him to be happy, but she doesn’t trust Harry to prioritize his happiness as much as she does. It will have to be enough.</p>
