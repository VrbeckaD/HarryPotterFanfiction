  <strong>Life of Blood will be my very first fanfiction that is planned out and multi-chaptered. Even though I have my Potter Prompt work, that is only for writing exercises before writing some of this.</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>This fanfiction will be slowbuilding and I hope the pacing is not too slow or too fast. Like I said, this is my first real Fanfiction so don't be afraid to give me some constructive criticism as it will truly help.</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>This "Chapter" is mainly for disclaimers, warnings as I don't want to bombard my tags with every minuscule detail so I find it easier to write this chapter of all the warnings. It will be updated in the future.</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>This will hopefully be one of many Fanfictions I will create. If this Fanfiction gets a good following, I will create a Twitter account so you guys can get some updates and also sneak peaks for future Fics.</b>

  <b>Plans for this Fanfiction</b>
</p><p align="justify">My ideal target is 50k words overall when this Fic is finished, I want this to be well written and full of details to keep your attention, I would like to stray away from the cliches of Harry Potter Fanfiction and focus on new ideas and possibilities. Whilst there are a few cliches, I won't be focusing too much on them and I will do my very best to put my own spin on it.</p><p align="justify">I want to pace this story correctly, I've seen a few Harry Potter fics that feature a Vampire or Werewolf Harry and he gets used to his condition a bit too quickly even though they would be life changing events. It will take months for Harry to get used to his curse in this Story, possibly a good year or two until he gets a complete grasp of his abilities. </p><p align="justify">If you do see any problems or inaccuracies in this writing, comment where the anomaly is and correct it please, sometimes I miss these things when I read the chapter for editing.</p><p align="justify"> </p>
