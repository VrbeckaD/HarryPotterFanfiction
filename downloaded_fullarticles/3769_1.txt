  <i>Once upon a time, there was a prince who was beloved of his people…</i>
</p><p>Credence made his way through the marketplace, chin high, and showing no evidence of the sweat that swelled under his heavy brocade coat. The vendors’ stalls pressed close, holding the unseasonal autumn heat and forcing the populace to crowd together as they shopped, the smell of unwashed bodies sharp and vital in his nose. </p><p>“My lord,” a woman called, her head bowed and arms outstretched. “Please accept this humble gift, and bless our stall with your custom?”</p><p>Her voice was low and scratchy, and Credence wondered how long it had been since she had quenched her thirst. He stepped closer to the wooden stand, a smile curling his cheeks, inclining his head as he held out both hands for the fine lace. “Your craft does you credit. May I have your name?”</p><p>“Alice, my prince,” she said, bobbing a curtsey. “My… my son made it. If I may be so bold, he always said your grace inspired him..” She swallowed hard. “It was the last piece he made before he was…”</p><p>Credence closed his eyes against a wave of grief. He gestured with his head for Sir Percival to step forwards and take the piece, then held Alice’s shoulders in both hands. “Your son does me too great an honour. I pray for his safe return from battle - for the swift end to this war that takes too much from our people.”</p><p>A tear ran down her cheek and she twisted her fingers together. A young woman, her headscarf tight around her head, bowed to Credence as she came to console Alice. </p><p>Credence stepped back and hid his uncertainty, the rageful impotence, under layers of poise and years of training. The crowd had fallen quiet around them, heads bowed in shared grief as well as respect, but he knew there was no more he could do, not here.</p><p>He turned to take the lace from Sir Percival again. The knight’s calloused hands brushed sharp against his own weak, soft skin as the precious fabric was passed between them, and Credence controlled the shiver that wanted to flutter down his spine at the contact. Instead, he wrapped the lace in paper and placed it in the bag at his hip.</p><p>“Will you not let me carry that for you, my Prince?” Asked Percival, his low voice caressing Credence’s soul.</p><p>Credence smiled at him, trying to keep the affection he felt for his first knight at bay, his own secret. One of so many, but certainly his favourite. “No indeed, Sir Percival, for it would impede your stance, were you to be forced to fight for me. As you so often remind me, that is why you are by my side.”</p><p>Sir Percival bowed his head, a strand of dark hair falling forwards over his brow. Credence saw a slight smile curl at his cheek. “As you say, your highness.” He straightened up, serious once more, his golden brown eyes holding Credence’s gaze and making him burn under his skin. “Your safety is the one thing of any importance to me.”</p><p>Credence could no longer hold back the blush that stole across his cheeks, and ducked his head to hide a smile behind the curtain of curls that fell around his face. How long he had wished for that protective loyalty to grow to something more, dreamed of Percival’s love for his country to become a different love for Credence himself, not simply the crown he represented! As he walked back to the palace, keeping the slow gliding walk that had been beaten into him since he could remember, he allowed the small joy of Sir Percival’s devotion to crystallise in his memory, a jewel more precious than any in his crown.</p><p>The street widened as they left the market and joined the main thoroughfare that led to the palace, stone glinting a rich golden brown in the afternoon sun. He walked down the very centre of the cobbled street, his gaze firmly ahead save for slight nods acknowledging the genuflection of his subjects as they called out to him. Sir Percival walked a half step behind and to his right, and though Credence could only just see him in his peripheral vision, he knew his knight’s eyes were casting a net across their way. Credence would feel more safe with his eyes closed in Sir Percival’s care than with his own weapon in hand in his absence, and he allowed his attention to rest on the bath he could request in his chambers, and the unguents and oils from Newt’s apothecary that clinked softly in his bag.</p><p>“Where is my wife?! Where is my wife, you bastard?”</p><p>The roar pierced the sultry air. Credence’s attention narrowed down to the thump on his chest as Sir Percival pushed him behind, the glide of scabbard on sword as he drew his weapon, and the pulse of panic in his bloodstream, suddenly beating on his high collar. “Stand down, blacksmith,” growled Sir Percival, his head bull-lowered and his sword at the throat of a huge man.</p><p>“I want to know where the crown has taken my wife,” he all but screamed, great hands clenched into fists and tears glistening in his reddened eyes. As Credence watched, one relinquished its hold and tracked a line through the soot and grime on his cheeks.</p><p>“Sir Percival,” said Credence, one hand on his shoulder. “Let him speak.”</p><p>“He may speak, your highness. But he will do you no harm lest he wish his head to cleave from his neck.”</p><p>Credence nodded to the blacksmith. “I do not know your wife,” he said. “Why is it that you believe I would?”</p><p>“Your men,” he spat, his voice trembling. “They took her. They said she was a heretic, that she practiced magic but she did not!” He gulped for air, tears now a constant stream down his face. “They… they took her mother’s necklace as proof, but… but it was naught but a symbol of remembrance! Her mother may have been an outlander, but she raised Temperance to our ways. It was just a necklace with a moon and stars, no more and they took it as proof that she… that she was a witch!” He fell to his knees, uncaring of Percival’s sword still at his throat. “Your highness, they say you are merciful… please… please bring my wife home to me. She is loyal to the queen and to God and no other. Please! I beg of you, my prince. Our babe is still suckling… must I lose him too?”</p><p>Credence took a sharp breath, his chest aching. He stepped forwards and bent before the man, Percival moving his blade and grunting in displeasure. He clasped the blacksmith’s hand in his own. “As God is my witness I shall learn the fate of your wife and…” he swallowed, throat suddenly dry. “And I shall speak on her behalf with the queen. Now, go to the apothecary on the corner of Ship Street and Barrowdown and tell Newt I have sent you - he will tell you of a wet nurse for your little one.” He allowed a hopeful smile to curl his lips. “Let us pray it will be but a temporary solution.”</p><p>The man whimpered and clutched Credence’s hands to his forehead, sobbing so hard it shook his great frame. Sir Percival sheathed his sword and lifted the smith to his feet. “Thank you, your highness… thank you. Bless you.”</p><p>“Save your thanks for when your wife returns to you,” he said softly, sadly, and the man sobbed again, stumbling down the road towards the marketplace. Credence straightened his back and stared up at the palace. “Come, Sir Percival. I must request an audience with my mother.”</p>
