    <p>What happens after war? When all the damage is done, and new life needs to grow…healing happens after war. For some, it’s easy enough. But for others, pain has built up so much before the war even started, that healing doesn’t seem to be an option.</p><p>Severus Snape is one such other. Broken by his childhood, his torment by the marauders, his loss of Lily, and his constant lack of care or kindness, Severus knew the chances of him ever healing were slim to none. So, he had built up wall after wall. He learned to shut everyone out, and never show them the pain. He hadn’t smiled in so many years, that hiding his emotions was easier than casting expelliarmus.</p><p>Even now, as he returned to his place as potions professor after the war, he hid his feelings. It was rare for him to even show anger, anymore. It was off-putting, to his students. Especially the returning 8th years, back to finish their schooling after the war.</p><p>Minerva was gracious enough to allow him a classroom with sunlight and removed him from the dungeons. He now carried on his class in a larger classroom with more work space, to his relief. For everything he’d done, he knew Minerva understood at least some of it. She’d been one of the few who saw what the marauders really were but had no power to stop it. Yet oddly enough, he’d come to respect Minerva almost like a sister.</p><p>The biggest thing about healing, is that it’s different for everyone. Some need time alone to clear their heads and find their own answers. Others need guidance and advice, to lead them in the right direction. A few were luckier than others, and healing came easily with time. Occasionally though, you got cases where the only answer was love.</p><p>Severus didn’t know it yet, but his healing was one such case. This was something no one really understood, or knew what to do about, because no one could reach him through his walls. Growing into who he is wasn’t because he was naturally cruel or evil. However, years of trauma without acknowledgement could turn anyone cold. Even a Weasley.</p><p>Yes, there are some people in the world who can only heal with bonding. Someone to become their anchor, their security blanket. Sometimes what people need is someone to talk to, smile with. Someone to enjoy conversation with and break them out of their shells. The only issue was, people with hearts big enough to handle the job were rare, and because it often needed to be a two-way street, were often incompatible with people who had so much baggage they could do little to help in return at first.</p><p>Once in a lifetime, though, such a match exists. And this lifetime, its Severus Snape and Adaline Axelwood.</p><p> </p><p>///NOTE///</p><p>Okay so, I really don't think Alan Rickman was the right choice for Severus, he looked much too old and not thin enough. Based on the book description, they really only got the hair color right. This picture is what I see as Snape. https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a9/5b/c5/a95bc5d4bf6cd066eabe0904263ece5c.jpg</p><p>[Ben Barnes]</p>
