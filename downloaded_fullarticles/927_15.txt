    <p>Draco and Pansy are lounged across the only long couch in the Slytherin common room, heads on opposite sides. With Draco's legs on the inside and Pansy's legs on the outside, they'd made it impossible for anyone else to sit down. They're playing Truth or Dare with Blaise, Daphne, and Theo. Blaise is on the floor, head on the carpet and feet up the wall. Daphne and Theo are each on opposite chairs, turned towards Pansy, who's telling a rather scandalous story about the first time she gave a blowjob.</p><p>"...or Dare, Draco."</p><p>Draco was thinking about the war again--how Potter had stood up in the middle of his hearing, without even asking permission to take the stand, and leaped--<em>leaped</em>--over the barrier dividing the audience from the defendant. Leaped. He had pulled the woman out of the chair--a muggle-born witch who he'd never seen before in his life, until she came to testify that he had killed her sister--and thrown her at the dementors guarding him. He'd never seen Potter so livid in his life.</p><p>"You're lying," he had growled through gritted teeth.</p><p>"No," she squeaked--she knew that lying in court would translate to months, maybe even years in Azkaban.</p><p>"I would never lie to the court. I was there, he killed her!"</p><p>Harry had advanced on her, backing her up almost into one of the dementors. The dismay on her face was plain for all to see; here was Harry Potter, Savior of the Wizarding World, calling her a liar. If Draco hadn't been so drained from his time spent locked up, he would almost have been amused. She was getting what she deserved.</p><p>"Then what day did you say this was?"</p><p>"March 26th!"</p><p>"<em>I</em> was at Malfoy Manor on March 26th. I know Malfoy couldn't possibly have been out killing your sister, because he was there with <em>me</em>."</p><p>The court was silent. The woman whimpered--she knew she'd fucked up. "Mr. Potter, would you like to press charges against the prisoner?"<br/>
A moment more of silence. This was it. Potter was going to expose him to the court--he remembered vividly doing his best not to expose Potter and his friends. He thought about how unfair it all was, that he was going to rot away in Azkaban--no. He'd rather die. He'd kill himself first, he'd-</p><p>"No."</p><p>Draco slumped in his chair. <em>No?</em></p><p>"Mr. Potter, he is a war criminal-"</p><p>"He was a child, like the rest of us. A victim of circumstance and poor upbringing. Not unlike many of the audience here today." Potter gestured to the crowd. Some people murmured their assent--most, if not all, of the audience was half-blood or less. They'd all dealt with a relative who was stuck up or worse.</p><p>"He made his decisions the day I was there. He, despite being a close classmate of many years, told Bellatrix that he could not recognize me. That he could not be sure if I was the one Voldemort wanted." The audience flinched at the name.</p><p>"Draco Malfoy proved, that day, that he was not a Death Eater. He was not focused on his blood heritage. He was so much more, so much better. He was a hero."</p><p>The audience suddenly all started talking at once.</p><p>Draco was dazed. A hero? Harry Potter was calling him a hero? In his hearing? Was this a fucking joke?</p><p>The judge banged his gavel on the stand. "Silence!"</p><p>Draco looked up at the judge, then at the dementors, then at Potter. Potter looked determinedly back up at the judge, who was frowning. "Mr. Potter, Draco Malfoy has done far more evil than good during his time in the war--"</p><p>Potter cut him off. "No, he didn't. He actively worked against Voldemort at every opportunity. He not only did not hand me over when I was caught, but gave me his wand to fight with and with his help, I escaped."</p><p>More muttering from the stands.</p><p>"I have this wand with me, here, today." He pulled it out.</p><p>Draco was stunned. Speechless. Harry Potter was openly, blatantly, lying to the court. And they were eating it up. After all, why else would Harry Potter have Draco Malfoy's wand, if not to help him? Draco had to marvel at Potter's creativity. The only question was... why?</p><p>The rest of the hearing passed easily. Every victim who claimed to have been injured by him (more than half of Draco had never seen in his life) was dismissed. Harry Potter said that this prisoner was innocent. Nothing else could stand a chance.</p><p>"Draco, dear."</p><p>Draco stirred. Not again. It was the fourth time that day that he'd completely spaced. Daphne and Theo were looking at him--they looked amused. He looked at Pansy, who had spoken. She was smiling, but her eyes looked concerned. He thought for a second, and deduced what she must have said.</p><p>"Dare," he said, carelessly, waving a hand in her general direction.</p><p>She immediately caught on to his dismissive attitude--they would talk about it later. For now, she would act as if nothing was wrong with him.</p><p>"Alright then... I have a dare in mind. Pick a person."</p><p>Draco was still not really all there, he was still thinking about... "Harry Potter."</p><p>Pansy's smile turned absolutely menacing. Draco regretted everything, but he wasn't about to show weakness. Show no fear. Never let it show--especially not around Pansy.</p><p>Draco laid his head back on the embroidered pillow, despite his entire being screaming to escape, escape, escape. Pansy now knew he had been thinking about Potter. And judging by Theo and Daphne's faces, they knew too.</p><p>"Draco, dearie, I guess you're going to have to woo Potter, then," she said, smiling sweetly.</p><p>Draco froze. Woo Potter? He'd always dreamt--always thought about--always wondered if they could have been--</p><p>"No."</p><p>Pansy's smile fell. "It's a dare, Draco, you can't say no."</p><p>"I can, I will, and I am. No."</p><p>Pansy's grin returned. "Fine, I suppose with your current appearance wooing anyone would be too difficult for you, anyhow."</p><p>Draco's pride flared up, the narcissistic Slytherin snake inside him rearing its head. Although it was true he had been a bit off-color since his spell in Azkaban, his hair was half-way back to its previous shine and he was slowly building his muscle mass back. Pansy knew he had been sensitive about this. This meant war.</p><p>"Fine," he said, through gritted teeth, "but on one condition."</p><p>Pansy grinned. "Oh? What's this condition of yours, Draco dear?"</p><p>"It's a competition. Me with Potter, and you with Granger."</p><p>Daphne snorted into her hand--Pansy and Granger had an aggressive hatred almost rivaling Draco's with Potter.</p><p>Blaise started laughing, then flipped right-side-up again, to face the rest of the people. "Screw the rest of the game, I want to watch <em>this</em>."</p><p>Pansy's face turned red, and her eyes flashed with fury. For a moment, Draco remembered the brutality with which she could cast an Unforgivable. Then it was gone. Instead, she had her competitive face on. "Fine, me versus you. But--"</p><p>"No 'but's, Pansy."</p><p>"Oh no, I think you'll like this. The loser has to pay a price."</p><p>
  <em>Damn. There went his plan to purposefully lose and watch Pansy make a fool of herself.</em>
</p><p>He huffed a little. "Deal. I'll decide on what you have to do <em>after</em> I win."</p><p>Pansy grinned evilly again. "We'll see about that, Draco dear. Because <em>I</em> intend to win."</p><p>The group headed off to bed, with Theo and Blaise chortling together. Daphne immediately began to talk strategy with Pansy, and Pansy was animatedly talking about eyeliner and "dressing up". Draco groaned internally--this was going to suck. Briefly, he wondered what Pansy would want him to do--throw himself into the lake naked? Walk around in heels all day? Or--<em>shudder</em>--wear one of those horrible leather miniskirts of hers? The possibilities were endless, and Draco found that he wanted to lose less and less. He had to win. He <em>had</em> to.</p>
