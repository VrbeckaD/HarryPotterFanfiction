  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>There was blood everywhere. He tried to look away from it, to see something else, Ron’s face, his hands, the ground beneath them - but everywhere he looked there was red. So he focused back on the cause for the blood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A big, open gash stretching from Ron’s shoulder across to his hip. His hands tried to hold in together, but there was still blood pouring out, Ron was still dying. Their capturers had taken their wands and left them down in the dungeons together, laughed when he pleaded for Ron’s life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ron, it’s okay mate, I swear. It’s… you’re gonna be fine.” Harry’s voice was shaking as he tried to hold back the tears that threatened to consume him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t lie, Harry, I know I’m already dead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry. I should have protected you, I tried. You were too far away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t blame you. Not your fault.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron’s voice was getting weaker and weaker. It wouldn’t be long now before…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Ron, just stay awake. Just a little longer. Come on. What about Hermione?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it was too late.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His best friend was dead.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>

  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>They were rescued an hour later.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Too late.</span>
