    <p>
  <span>It’s three days before Christmas. The normally gray skies of London seem even darker above Heathrow Airport. Flakes of snow twist down from the sky as passengers that pour through the terminals seem all too eager to get out of the airport and head home before the snow gets denser. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>At one particular terminal where passengers who just arrived from America were disembarking, six particular passengers poured out of the tunnel that connected the airport to the plane. Due to the holiday season, no one was paying this particular group any attention, but if someone were they would notice the lack of luggage that any of them carried. No overnight bag, backpack, or even a purse was in sight on the motley group of six who walked in a tight formation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>At the head of the group was a rather tall man with white-blond hair, the underside of which was shaved into a taper fade with the rest of his hair styled into a sweeping part that managed to make him look elegant in a movie star way. A few women and even a few guys glanced at him as he passed by. The dark button-up he wore that was overlaid by a dark vest with gold buttons and faint green spiral designs on it contributed to the regal and aristocratic aura that exudes from him. A black coat that doubled as a cloaked cape was casually draped over a single arm.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sharp, pointed features complemented grey, cold eyes. He was tall, but not as tall as the black woman trailing behind him. Rich dark skin made her look like a model, her dark eyes scanned the airport as if she was keeping alert for any potential threat that might come her way. Dark curls were pulled back into a loose ponytail that hung down her back until it reached her waist. To her right was a small Asian woman of average height. Out of everyone in the group, she was the one that drew the most attention due to the icy blue tone of her pixie cut, she seemed to bounce with every step she took.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Behind her was a rather androgynous-looking Native American. Masculine in the face with almond-shaped eyes, they had long, dark hair that reached down to their waist that seemed feminine with skin that was umber colored. Beside them, was a man of the same height. He had dark, windswept hair that made it seem like he was caught in the engines of the plane. Green eyes that were tinged with hazel set in a diamond-shaped face with high cheekbones. He’s slightly taller than the leader of the group.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Making up the rear was a young woman with tan skin and Pacific Islander features. Her dark, wavy hair comes down to her shoulders, swishing slightly against them as she swiveled her head from side to side as they picked their way through the airport.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Aside from the lack of luggage, nothing was unusual about this group except for the powder blue skirt that the Asian woman wore that was decorated in constellations that had been painstakingly hand-drawn onto the fabric.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The group managed to reach the exterior of the airport, there were a few Muggles out and about either catching a taxi or waiting for rides to pick them up. The leader of the group turned to the Asian woman.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Saori, cast the spell.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Saori rolled her eyes as if he didn’t even need to ask as she shook the sleeve of her shirt, allowing her wand to slide down into the palm of her hand, she lifted the wand slightly, waving it in a slight figure-eight movement close to her chest. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Repello muggletum.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” The air around the group shimmered in a slight haze.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The few Muggles that were around them seemed to stare at their group, confusion painted on their faces until they averted their gazes seemingly remembering something else they had to do.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a nod of his head, the leader apparates, only to appear with a crack on a snowy, yet deserted street that was lit by the soft glow of lamplights. His teammates appeared with a crack. Together as one, they walk toward a fairly crowded pub; Bad Owl was written in golden cursive letters on one of the windows. A group of Muggles pushed their way into the pub, this mysterious group came in after them with the leader asking for a table from the young woman posted near the front.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The woman gave the group a quick once over, a mysterious smile pulling at her cheeks as she offers to take them to the “purple section” of the pub.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The leader turned around to his companions to ask them what they wanted to drink.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Butterbeer!” Saori asked with exuberance, her teammates requesting the same drink before following the young woman to whatever it was the purple section of the pub was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Heading toward the bar, with his coat draped over his arm, the young man flagged down a bartender to order some drinks. His hand is slightly raised in the air, when he hears someone drawn in a quick breath of disbelief, before uttering out, “Draco...Malfoy?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco turns his head, his eyes widening slightly when his gaze lands upon one very unfortunate Harry </span>
  <em>
    <span>bloody </span>
  </em>
  <span>Potter. He looks older, his hair slightly longer with his bangs swept up and slightly curled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh for fuck’s sake</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Draco thinks to himself as Harry stares at him awkwardly, not quite too certain on what to say now that he has Draco’s attention. Draco doesn’t know either, but the bartender comes over and he quickly rattles off his order to him; his bartender tells him that she’ll carry his friends’ drinks to his table, but will be back with his mug of butterbeer in a second. A second bartender comes over to Harry, placing three mugs of butterbeer down before him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Uh, I guess I’ll see you around?” Potter tells him with about as much social grace as a pile of trash on a hot summer’s day would possess. He leaves, hesitancy in his step, however, as he looked like he had more to say to Draco than Draco did to him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a sigh, Draco is all but thankful when the bartender appears with his own mug of butterbeer. Taking a swig of it, he makes his way through the crowd and comes to a pause in front of two archways. The one on his right has blue neon lights wrapped around the wood and the one in front of him has purple neon lights, pursing his lips at the purple lights, Draco stepped through the archway and turned when he noted a slightly muffled murmur that was no more than a whisper coming from behind him. Despite the bar being packed, it seemed there was a muffliato charm that had been placed over this particular section of the bar.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>At least that was useful for witches and wizards who didn’t feel like casting the charm themselves. He makes a mental note to thank Pansy for recommending the bar to him. Walking toward a U shaped booth where his teammates were located, Draco slid into the booth, sitting next to the light-skinned man with darker hair. He’d barely even been seated for a handful of seconds before a waitress deposited their drinks onto their table and asked if they wanted food. She took their orders and walked away as quickly as she came, when Draco’s dark-skinned female companion—Nyala—leaned against the table, the palm of her hand propping her chin up as she narrowed her dark eyes slightly at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco?” Her Ethiopian accent wrapping around his name heavily, “why are there a group of people behind you who’ve been staring at you ever since you sat down?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?” Draco jerked his head away from his mug of butterbeer, his body going rigid as he became more alert and whipped his head around following Nyala’s line of gaze to see Harry Potter sitting at a table with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. “Oh bloody hell,” he muttered as he turned around, letting his forehead fall into his upturned hand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Saori gasps, leaning into Nyala’s side to get a better look at the hero’s of Britain’s wizarding world, the action causing the Ethiopian witch to relax slightly at the accidental touch.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Boss!” Saori was practically vibrating in her seat as she glanced at Draco, an impish grin spreading across her face, “Isn’t that Harry Potter!?” She glanced from him to Harry and back to him again, her eyes glittering with a million questions that he knew if Nyala or any of his other teammates didn’t reign her in, she’d spend all night asking them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We went to Hogwarts together, but that’s all I’m—Saori! No!” Draco hisses the last part as he watches Saori scuttle underneath the table and pop out on the other side of the booth as she makes a beeline for Harry’s table.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco shoots a pleading look at Nyala to grab Saori and drag her back to the table if she has to, but the Ethiopian witch smirks at him and shrugs her shoulders as if to remind him that once Saori sets her mind on something, nothing can stop her. He painfully knows that aspect of Saori’s personality all too well from the last time he was on a mission with her and she’d been determined to rescue a pair of captured Kelpies that were being trafficked. It wasn’t a part of their mission, but she’d nearly set the trafficking house ablaze in anger. The two of them had been reprimanded and their pay had been docked, but the smirk on Saori’s face had told him such punishments had been worth it to save the creatures.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His other teammates watched in barely suppressed mirth as Saori animatedly chatted to the trio, every so often, turning around to point to their booth and making a slightly jerking motion with her entire body.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco couldn’t watch. It was too painful, instead, he kept his gaze pointed at the table as Saori began to walk back, the wonder trio picking up their mugs of beer to follow her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Kai,” he asked the Native American sitting on Nyala’s left, “how bad is it?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Kai snorted rather loudly as they looked at Draco, “Do you really want me to answer that question?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Guys slide over!” Saori made a shooing motion as she appeared back at the table, only to scuttle underneath it and pop back up like a groundhog in the spring. Kai slid over, allowing Hermione to sit next to them. Draco slid over in his seat to allow Harry and Ron to settle into the booth. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Everyone at the booth seemed a little awkward as the waitress appeared to tap her wand against the table, causing a bunch of steaming appetizers to appear before them. The only person who didn’t seem awkward was Saori who vibrated with a bubbliness as she reached out and grabbed a chip.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So,” Hermione tried to smile at Draco, the corners of her mouth causing her skin the color of freshly tilled earth to wrinkle slightly, “Draco, it’s good to see you again.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco knew that was a lie as easily as if he’d said it himself. He was a complete ass to Hermione throughout their school years and he supposed being tortured by his maternal aunt didn’t do him any favors either. But he took the polite course of action, nodding his head and taking a sip of beer to wet his throat. “You too,” he mutters, letting the booth fall back into a gauche silence until Zach—the light-skinned dark-haired man sitting next to Draco—tapped his index finger against the table.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco, aren’t you going to introduce us?” A New Zealand accent rumbled past a deep voice that was like plucking the strings of a cello.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right,” he mutters, motioning to Zach beside him. “This is Zach—” Zach gives a slight wave, a goofy grin spreading across his face as he tells the wonder trio, hello, Draco moves on to the slim Pacific Islander woman next to him, “—this is Akanisi—” Akanisi shyly lifts her eyes, her lips slightly twitching in greeting as she seems to try and retreat further into the cushions of the booth. “—This is Saori, who I’m sure you’ve had a lovely time meeting—” Saori sticks her tongue out at him in response, causing Draco’s lips to twitch into a half-smile. “This is Nyala—”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Nyala gave a wave to everyone with her index and middle fingers jutting up into a V shape. “Hello, Draco has told us so very little about you all, despite talking about his Hogwarts years with some fondness.” She shot him a look, eyebrow slightly raised as if she dared for him to challenge her on a fact that was true.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Anyway, this is Kai,” Draco motioned to Kai last. Kai inclined their head slightly in greeting. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione, Harry, and Ron introduce themselves. Although Draco could see the wrinkle of confusion between Hermione’s brows as she glances at Draco and his compatriots.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How did you all meet each other?” Ron asks the question that Hermione and Harry seemed to have. The trio seemingly picking up on the different accents, ethnicities, and nationalities at the table.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Work,” Draco and his compatriots reply as one.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What kind of work do you do?” Hermione asks, tucking a stray lock of bushy brown hair behind an ear, an unconvinced question of ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>what kind of work do you do that has you working with international wizards and witches’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>trailing behind it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco exchanges a look with everyone, before settling on, “We do security detail for high ranking international wizarding figures,” he shrugs, before adding, “the job has us traveling a lot.” It’s not exactly a lie, but it’s close enough to what any of them actually do on a given basis.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But, you’re finally home,” Ron points out, “bet the folks are glad to have you back in time for Christmas.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco’s mouth twists at the mention of his parents as he remembers having left the Malfoy Manor with his bags packed the same day two representatives of the organization he worked for had shown up to the Manor. They’d wanted his knowledge and expertise on dark wizards, artifacts, and arts that were left behind in the wake of Voldemort. It’d been too good of an opportunity for Draco to pass on even as his mother had chased after him to the foyer. Tears streaking down her cheeks with his father hissing at him harshly that if he left he was turning his back on the Malfoy family legacy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’d picked up his bags and hadn’t looked back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, yes,” Draco mutters sourly, “I bet they’ll be very pleased to see me.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione sighs, twisting her right wrist to check the silver watch strapped to it. “It’s getting late and I do have to get to the office early tomorrow.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?” Draco raises a brow, “are there more regulations and amendments to laws for you to check and write?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A hushed sort of confusion swept over the trio; all three of them glancing at each other when Hermione’s eyes widened slightly until they resembled the size of saucers. “Oh!” She uttered sharply, shaking her head slightly, “no...no I’m not an Auror.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That seemed to break the awkwardness that hovered over the table as Draco lifted a brow in confusion. Everyone in his year had been keen on being an Auror at the height of the war; too many had seen how corrupt the Ministry of Magic had been before Voldemort had wrested control of the government and it was still corrupt even when sweeping changes were attempting to be made. So he’s surprised that someone as brilliant as Hermione Granger wasn’t an Auror. Had the Ministry taken one look at her, turned their noses up, and tossed her resume in the bin?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Instead, Harry laughed as if this was some sort of inside joke. “A lot of things have changed since you left England, Malfoy.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Actually,” Hermione’s cheeks deepened with her blush, her mouth curving with silent laughter, “I’m working with the Department of Mysteries.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re an Unspeakable!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She nodded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Damn…” Draco blinks, “it’s actually really fitting, you were the most brilliant one in our year.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione jerked back slightly from Draco’s compliment, a surprise she wasn’t expecting, but the deep blush on her cheeks indicates that its one compliment she accepts. “There are loads of people in my department who are more brilliant than I am.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“‘Mione,” Ron grins, “accept the compliment, especially if it’s coming from Malfoy.” She shot him a look.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Then Weas—Ron,” Ron’s eyes widen in shock at Draco using his first name; a shock that seems to grip Hermione and Harry as well, “what are you doing now?” Draco has a feeling that if Hermione isn’t an Auror then at least Ron and Harry continued on their chosen career path.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m co-manager of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes with my brother, George; he needed the help after Fred died…” Ron trailed off, becoming sullen at the memory of the brother he lost in the war. Just like that, a dark blanket of solemnity swept over the table at the mention of the war.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco’s teammates looked at him; they heard talks about the war, of course; knew what happened in the country from him and other members of the organization who called the British Isles their home. But Hermione clears his throat, reiterates that she should be leaving again due to her need to go into the office early tomorrow, despite it approaching the Christmas holidays so soon.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Following suit, Ron slipped out of the booth, telling everyone that he needed to head into the shop in order to check the inventory for the new products they were releasing on Christmas Eve.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Zach’s eyes seemed to sparkle at the mention of a new Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes product; over the past year or so, much of the products that the shop made were growing in popularity overseas and as much as Draco would love to figure out to this day how he’d managed to get his hand on a Screaming Yo-yo. It’d been so bad that Draco had cast a hex on the object, causing it to crumble into ash. A week later, Zach had laughed maniacally when he came into headquarters with a box of Bombastic bombs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Nyala made a pact with Draco to find out who kept selling Zach the products, murder them and make sure their body would never be discovered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You know—” Zach started, causing Nyala and Draco’s eyes to widen in alarm.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No!” Both of them shouted at once, causing him to pout like a child who’d been denied a cookie by their parents. There was no way either of them were going to allow Zach to get his hands on another Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes product as long as they lived.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Nyala narrowed her eyes at Ron, stress eating at her face. “Please,” she pleaded with him, “don’t sell him a single thing if you value order, life, and your own sanity.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Confusedly, Ron’s lips parted as he nodded his head slightly. Draco’s teammates informed him they might call it an early night too, jetlag was finally catching up to them, plus they had to report in early tomorrow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco,” Kai informed him as they slipped out of the booth, “try not to drink too much and don’t stay up late.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a roll of his eyes, Draco scoffed, “Who are you? My mum?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Kai winks at him, “A few more drinks and I’m certain I can get you to call me anything I want.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco’s mouth wrinkled in laughter at the scandalized look upon Hermione, Harry, and Ron’s faces. The only three people amongst this entire group who weren’t used to the way everyone joked with one another...well, everyone accept Akanisi who was still new and hadn’t worked with any of them on other missions. She’d been pretty silent so far, something that concerned Draco and he made a mental note to ask Nyala about it later.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But everyone gets up, bids each other goodbye and leaves Draco and Harry behind at the booth by themselves. Scooting to give Harry more room, Draco sips on the last dregs of butterbeer in his glass, he grabs a chip and dips it into the little cup filled with ketchup that comes with it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Your job,” Harry shoots Draco a confused look as the light-haired man gestured to the table that was still slightly full of appetizers that his teammates hadn’t polished off, “everyone talked about their job except you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh,” Harry exclaims, not bothering to point out that Draco and his friends didn’t exactly talk about their jobs either, but he decides to sweep it under the rug. “One of the few in our year who’s an Auror. I like it a lot; there’s never a day that goes by where I don’t get to do something new.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco nods his head, as he flags down the waitress to order a second butterbeer before glancing at Harry to ask him if he wants anything. Harry orders an ale as the waitress taps her wand against the table to clear away any empty dishes. “I can say the same about my job,” it’s a statement that causes Harry to lean forward, his lips pursed as his glasses catch the warm light of the pub.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, do you really protect international wizards and witches?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I do.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That seems to cause Harry to laugh. “Aurors are trained to sniff out lies from the truth,” he remarks as their second round of drinks appear on their table, “and what you’re saying doesn’t sound like the whole truth.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Isn’t that the fun of life,” Draco points out, “that some things are a mystery?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry snorts as Draco sips on his butterbeer. Light conversation springs up between them both as they chip away at the remaining food on the table and order more alcohol. The longer they stayed there the more warm and comfortable they became with each other. Harry launched into some stories about his work as an Auror, such as the one where he was chasing down a pair of wizards who’d gotten into a duel in a public square in the presence of Muggles. One had tried to apparate away from him as he’d given chase and ended up splinching his leg right off.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco laughed at that, he’s drunk enough that at some point he’d switched over from butterbeer to Firewhisky. He splashes some alcohol on his vest and frowns down at it as if it's the alcohol’s fault for getting on him; something that seems to cause Harry to erupt in a fit of giggles. But he’s properly sloshed too when he starts to bring up Draco’s fiancée, Astoria.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You must be excited to see her in time for Christmas too; the engagement was plastered all over the papers.” What Harry doesn’t mention, however, is how the press—particularly Rita Skeeter—had a field day when the engagement was made public.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In Harry’s opinion, the articles she published in Witch Weekly caused the magazine to fly off shelves quicker than anymore could be printed. She’d penned articles ranging from if former Death Eaters deserve love, whether the Malfoy and Greengrass engagement was meant to curry favor from the public after the reputable pure-blooded family’s involvement with Voldemort’s forces during the war or Harry’s favorite, whether Draco Malfoy had proposed to Astoria to hide from the public her affair with the seeker for the national English Quidditch team. He was sure Rita was loving all the newfound publicity she’d gained after writing such things.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Er, actually ex,” Draco clarifies, causing Harry to snort on his intake of Firewhisky. A river of alcohol slid down the front of the plain blue hoodie he wore, causing him to hastily grab at the napkins offered to him by Draco and attempt to dab at the liquid before it stained.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?” Harry questions once his airway was clear of liquid.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Astoria, she’s my ex-fiancée.” Draco shrugs his shoulders as if the lack of engagement wasn’t that big of a deal, “we ended the engagement before I left England.” What Draco doesn’t tell Harry as he takes a sip of his Firewhisky is that he ended the engagement because he wasn’t certain if he was getting married to Astoria to spite his parents, like a physical middle finger to the face or if he actually liked her. “What about the Weasley girl?” Draco asks him, realizing that he doesn’t know any of the Weasley sibling’s first names aside from Ron’s. Draco realized since he came to the bar and saw the trio that the Weasley girl was nowhere in sight; she wasn’t stuck to Harry’s side like glue.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry gets this constipated sort of look upon his face as he tells Draco, “We broke up some months ago,” and just leaves it at that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>What Harry doesn’t tell Draco is that both he and Ginny realized after the war that they were better friends than lovers. Nor the fact that Ginny realized she loved the idea of “Harry” the boy who lived, the master of death, the one who defeated Voldemort rather than “Harry.” The young man who often woke up at night screaming from nightmares, a young man who’d had days where his hands wouldn’t stop trembling until either Ron or Hermione would reach out and place a comforting hand on him. Once his fame had died down slightly, Ginny had taken a good look at it, seen the man behind the curtain of his fame and realized she’d built him up in her mind as some unattainable figure until she had him. They’d called it quits but were still friends even if their relationship hadn’t worked out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>What he also doesn’t tell Draco is that months ago he’d realized he might like men as equally as he liked women. But instead, the both of them drink in silence until its last call and they awkwardly leave.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“See you around,” Harry nods at Draco as they walk out of the pub to the streets covered in a few inches of snow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco shrugs on his coat, before walking into a dark alley and apparates outside of the Leaky Cauldron, pushing his way inside, he finds his teammates huddled around a table near the fireplace. The only one missing, of course, is Akanisi. He asks Nyala about her, the dark-skinned woman’s lips settle into a miffed look. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You know she’s still taking the time to get used to you and the team dynamics.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco nods, not bothering to point out that Akanisi has had two weeks to get used to it. Squealing despite the late time of night, Saori’s hair, now a shocking shade of champagne pink, shoots Draco a nonplussed look. “I can’t believe you didn’t tell us you know Harry Potter! </span>
  <em>
    <span>The </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry Potter; the boy who single-handedly took down Voldemort.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The usage of that name had the few patrons glance up uneasily in Saori’s direction, despite Voldemort being long dead. At the bar, Tom, still as hunchbacked as ever frowned disapprovingly at Draco’s group.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He’s just a regular bloke,” Draco points out as he forces Kai to scoot over on the couch they’re sitting on so he can plop himself down on cushions that were as hard as slabs of stone. “He isn’t some untouchable figure who took down Voldemort with a Patronus charm; I was there Saori.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Saori pouts out him, knowing ultimately that he’s correct by the way she sulks, but it doesn’t stop her from muttering under her breath in Japanese. Now, Draco’s Japanese is spotty at best, but he can catch a few curse words here and there. Whatever it is that she says it has Nyala snorting rather loudly; like a pin dropping the rest of them dissolve into laughter that rips away the stress that was weighing down their shoulders. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s late,” Draco yawns, reaching up to ruffle his hair, making it messy and loose, so that the part comes undone and the strands of his hair come down to his shoulders. “We have to get to the Ministry early tomorrow, so go to bed.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Everyone gets up to head to the rooms upstairs that Draco had rented in advance, they all wish each other goodnight, but Nyala lingers behind. As she silently passes by him, she reaches out and touches his shoulder. A touch that he knows all too well when the Ethiopian witch wants to convey all the things she isn’t best at verbally expressing. It’s a touch that tells him his things are upstairs, that for whatever reason he accepted this mission, accepted leading this team and return to a country he’d been avoiding coming back to for five years that she has his back just as much as he has hers or any of their other teammates.</span>
</p>
