    <p>He could taste her lipstick on the filter of his cigarette. She didn’t smoke; that was plain by her coughing attack. He wondered what had driven her to ask for a drag. Even he had to acknowledge the smell wasn’t appealing, the flavour wasn’t the best; he’d admit the sex appeal was there though, to a degree. <br/>
She was short. Saying she was shorter than he would not mean much, him being so tall but she was shorter than most, adorably so. She had attention-grabbing wild hair she loosely controlled with flips and flicks which was hypnotic and intriguing. Now as she keeled over in a coughing fit; it was both her arse and why the hell would she ask a stranger for a drag on his cigarette?<br/>
“You all right, love?” he asked once the coughing had stopped. <br/>
“No!” She pushed her hair out of her face, still catching her breath. She had a nice face. <br/>
“Let me buy you a drink, make you feel better?” he offered. <br/>
“Screw you,” she sneered.<br/>
Instantly turned off by her demeanour, he shrugged and returned to his easy position against the pub’s brick wall. "Have a nice night, then."<br/>
She glared at him for a moment, opened her mouth only to close it again, then stormed into the pub. She was an interesting woman. Crazy but, the interesting ones always were.  <br/>
The door slammed open, the bang echoed through the alley. A sharp, slightly crooked finger thrusted into his face accompanied by fiery eyes. He took one last drag on his cigarette before flicking it away. <br/>
“You know,” she started, “sometimes a girl will ask you for a drag without wanting to get in your pants. Sometimes a girl will accept a drink from you -” <br/>
“Without wanting to get in my knickers, got it. You could say the same for a bloke. Sometimes, all a bloke wants to do is talk,” he said. “Unless there’s a double standard I don’t know about.” <br/>
“Fuck you!” she spat. <br/>
“I don’t fuck crazy,” he shrugged and walked away. <br/>
“Who the fuck do you think you are?” she called after him. <br/>
“Sirius Black, love,” he straddled his motorbike and kicked it to life. It gave a loud roar as it rumbled beneath him. He loved the surge of power it emitted. “An exhibitionist!” He grinned at her before speeding away. </p>
