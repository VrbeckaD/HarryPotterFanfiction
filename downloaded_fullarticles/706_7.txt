  <strong>ATHOUR’S NOTE: Haven’t been writing in a long time but this lovely story of the relationship between Bellatrix and Sirius and the other young members of the Black family popped into my mind and I’ve not been able to shake it since. So of course, the best thing I could think of doing was to write it all down. I’ve used them as a pairing before, and thought it would be nice to make a story out of it.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>For the purpose of the fact that this is purely <em><u>fanfiction</u></em>Bellatrix and Sirius will be the same age and in their sixth year at Hogwarts. Of course as is expected of me, there will be smut, Blackcest (incest), possibly even bestiality and a decent amount of gore. Therefore <u>this fanfiction is rated M.</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>As always, reviews are welcome. I look forward to knowing how you all take to this story and enjoy.</strong>

<p>It was Christmas time in the Black manor and Druella Black was once again, screaming at her daughter Bellatrix. Her two daughters were back for the winter break and she found herself asking herself once more why couldn’t Bellatrix be more like her youngest daughter, Narcissa? Druella didn’t know, but she was almost certain it was something to do with their father, her husband Cygnus Black. He was a tall man with dark hair and dark eyes, and a booming deep voice. He was the epitome of man.</p>
<p>The mother of the house felt distant from the rest of her family, except her youngest child Narcissa. Both mother and daughter were blonde and blue eyed with porcelain complexions and gentle voices (unless of course they were angered), the complete opposite of the other three members of their family, Cygnus, Bellatrix and Andromeda who all had hair and eyes as black as their names, and a golden hue to their skin. They had heavy voices and chiselled faces –as Cygnus often liked to remind Druella, the sign of a proper pureblood.</p>
<p>Druella watched as her daughter walked away from her. No doubt she would see fit to leave for a number of hours until she was sure Druella would be worried sick, before returning and ignoring her mother’s demands for the next two weeks. She didn’t ask much of her, only that she be a good, purebred woman just as she was supposed to be. Druella pondered silently over understanding why her daughter was so different from her other two. Andromeda was always away in her room and she hardly made any noise <em>and</em>hardly spoke a word. She was a bright girl, and Druella knew it but however, did not know what she got up to late at night.</p>
<p>Bellatrix, after having rowed heavily with her mother as always –this time and for about the hundredth time, about her dark, wavy and seemingly untameable hair decided to ignore her mother and make her way back upstairs to her room. She passed her younger sisters door and paused. Taking a step back, she decided it was time to wake her sister, after all, the elves would soon remove all of the breakfast items on their dining table and replace them with the lunch foods as their guests, Cygnus’s  sister and brother-in-law would be arriving any time soon. Pushing the door open and peering in, the teenager glanced over to grin at her sister, who was hidden under her bed sheets. Almost every surface in her room was covered with books. Most of which, Bellatrix did not approve of.<br/>
“Oh Andy...” she said as she shut the door, “time to wake up.”<br/>
“Go away Bella, it’s too early.” Andromeda grumbled from under her blankets.<br/>
“Early? Darling, it’s almost lunch. Uncle Orion and Aunt Walburga will be here soon. Then we have that bloody party mother and father are hosting for Christmas eve tonight as well.”<br/>
“Lunch?!” Andromeda said, suddenly sitting up and looking with complete horror at the clock on the wall.<br/>
A slight flicker of a smirk twitched at Bellatrix’s lip, “let me guess,” she said slowly, “someone was out with a certain friend of theirs mummy and daddy would <em>not </em> approve of?”<br/>
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” She said suddenly, almost looking ashamed, and running her hand through her shining black and dead straight hair.<br/>
“No?” she asked, folding her arms and tilting her head slightly, “so that <em>wasn’t </em>you I saw last night with that sixth year Ravenclaw half blood in the Hogg’s head?”<br/>
“How did you-” she began, but sighed and stopped, rolling her eyes at her sister and getting out of bed, “At least I didn’t fuck Lucius Malfoy in the prefect’s bathroom.”<br/>
“Be quiet about that!” Bellatrix hissed, “I thought the door was locked. And how was I supposed to know that creep was going to brag about it for the next two weeks?!”<br/>
“You’re just lucky Cissy doesn’t go to Hogwarts yet, you know how crazy she is about him.”<br/>
“Oh <em>please!” </em>Bellatrix laughed, “Narcissa is ten years old and Lucius is seventeen. It’s never going to happen.”<br/>
“It might Bellatrix, you never know, now could you help me pick out what to wear?” Andromeda asked after speaking so accusingly as she got out of bed and started rifling through her wardrobe to pick something to wear.<br/>
“True I suppose as you’re only fourteen, but that doesn’t mean you’re not out with boys in <em>my </em>year at three in the morning in Hogsmeade, right?”<br/>
“Almost fifteen!” she said accusingly before her expression and her voice dropped, “You won’t tell mother...” she asked tentatively, looking at her sister.<br/>
Bellatrix smiled a little and pulled out a deep blue silk dress, “Your secret is safe with me, as long as it’s a pureblood I see you with at three in the morning next time. Wear this.”<br/>
Andromeda rolled her eyes but smiled at her sister. She knew what Bellatrix meant by ‘your secret is safe with me’. Bellatrix had a way with getting people to tell her things, and she could hold it against them for ridiculously long amount of times. That being said, she didn’t know how to tell her she had no intention of ever marrying into another pure blood family and being like their mother, although she was sure the last thing Bellatrix wanted was to be anything like their mother. Never the less, she took the dress and nodded at her sister, verbally promising, and silently breaking that promise.</p>
<p>It was only about twenty minutes later when Orion and his wife arrived with their two sons, Sirius who was Bellatrix’s age at sixteen, and Regulus who had just turned fifteen. Sirius was the black sheep of the family. Having been sorted into Gryffindor in his first year at Hogwarts after his cousin had been placed in Slytherin as was expected, their relationship with each other and his relationship with his family was slowly falling apart. Sirius was miserable being at these family get togethers. He hated them but luckily for him and even though they acted as if they were against one another, he and Bellatrix were very alike. Sirius had surprised himself when the sorting hat had put him in Gryffindor, but Bellatrix hadn’t been so surprised. She noticed something was different about her cousin from a young age. He was no doubt very much like her in looks with his dark hair and even darker eyes, but they were one another’s polar opposites. Although they pretended to hate one another in public, no one knew them as well as each other and they revelled in this. So immediately, after having greeted his aunt and uncle and noticing that his mother and aunt were immediately gossiping and complaining about the pain their children gave them, and his father and his uncle were rolling their eyes at their wives and gesturing to the privacy of the library where Sirius knew all of the firewhisey was, he was up and knocking on his cousin’s door after leaving his brother at Andromeda’s door.</p>
<p>“Come in.” Bellatrix said.<br/>
Sirius poked his head around the door and grinned, “Well hello cousin.”<br/>
Bellatrix looked at her cousin in the mirror of her vanity as she pressed her lips together after applying a sheen of nude lipstick to them.<br/>
“You clean up well for a psychopathic bitch.” He said simply, leaning against the door frame as he entered his cousin’s room. A slight flicker of a smirk found the corner of her lips as she looked at him through the mirror.<br/>
“Close the door,” she said simply, not bothering to turning around to look at her cousin. She paused as he closed the doors, putting in a set of diamond earrings.<br/>
“I haven’t heard from you in a while. I was rather looking forward to your late night visits these holidays.” He continued after shutting the door.<br/>
“Don’t flatter yourself cousin.” She said, running her fingers through her open waves that fell just above her mid-back, “You know I only come to ease my boredom of the holidays.”<br/>
“When you’re unable to get to the Slytherin quidditch team you mean?”<br/>
She ignored his last comment, only smirking a little at him as she turned and walked to her wardrobe to pick out a pair of spiked black stilettos and slip them on. She moved back to her vanity, taking another look at herself, her dark lashes longer and her lips covered in the nude sheen of the lipstick, she picked up a necklace. She didn’t need to say a word to him as he walked to her and took the necklace, placing it around her neck and doing the clasp for her.<br/>
“So where <em>have</em> you been then?” he asked.</p>
<p><br/>
“Who cares? We’re both here now, aren’t we?” she said as she turned to him. She pressed into him, forcing him back towards the bed before suddenly pushing him down onto it and straddling his lap while pressing her mouth to his before he could say another word. He groped at her body through the thin lace of the dress, his trousers already straining at the mere prospect of being inside of her. She ran her hands down his chest, pulling at the buttons of his shirt, her hair falling over him as she made her way down his body, kissing and nipping at his neck, hard chest and his well defined stomach. She was quick with his belt as he sat up on his elbows and grappled with the zip on the back of her dress. No sooner had he tugged it down than a slight squeak of a voice at the door made them both stop immediately and freeze in horror.</p>
