English curled around his mother's tongue. She began learning before her exile to Hogwarts, before her family sent her away from the continent, away from Grindelwald's war. Yet English was unsafe. "You've been here twenty years," his father said. "Why can't you fucking talk?"</p><p>Slovene flowed from her mouth, every word beautiful, most unknown. If his grandparents had ever seen him, he could have told them <span title="I am Severus">"jaz sem Severus,"</span> but little else. He was not allowed to learn. She sang him stories anyway, and he dreamed he understood.</p><p>Latin was their own secret language, dead to everyone but them. This was how she taught him the names and ways of things.</p><p>II.<br/>
When you need to make a choice, consult a linden tree, pluck one heart-shaped leaf, fold it in your handkerchief, keep it close. Once you dream its flowers, you should know.</p><p>Your body has its own power. Witches know when to use blood and when to use bone. The best of them know to always use their own.</p><p>III.<br/>

She said they just go quiet, bloodless, like a vampire choosing hibernation that it might live another hundred years.</p><p>His mother knew thestrals in her first year and had two other names for them besides.</p><p>V.<br/>
<span title="Good morning">Dóbro jútro</span> for the morning, <span title="good day">dọ́ber dan</span> for the day, <span title="good evening">dọ́ber večẹ̑r</span> for the night. Tell your friends <span title="hello">zdravo</span>; tell your mother <span title="I love you">ljubim te</span>.</p><p>Goldhorn roams the mountains still; his flowers will grow forever. Someday, we will own ourselves. Until then, the sun will shine.</p><p><span title="Easy night">Lahko noč</span> means good night. <span title="Until we meet again">Nasvȋdenje</span> means goodbye.</p></div>
