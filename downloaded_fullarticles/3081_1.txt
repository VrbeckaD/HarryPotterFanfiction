  <em>Tap tap tap.</em>
</p><p>Newt stands up from his chair slowly to walk over to the window. He sees an owl- one he knows well- right outside the window, waiting to be let in. </p><p>“I'm surprised you didn't fly <em>into</em> the window today, Errol,” Newt chuckles, opening the window for the bird. </p><p>Errol hops on the table by the window and holds out his leg for Newt with a small hoot. </p><p>“Thank you,” Newt says, exchanging a treat for the letter. Errol takes the food gratefully and then flies back out the window. </p><p>Shuffling back to his favorite chair, Newt recognizes the letter as one from Charlie Weasley. They had kept up a long correspondence ever since an excited ten year old Charlie sent him a letter asking about everything there is to know about dragons.</p><p>Newt slices the letter open and starts to read through it. It's only when he gets to a part where Charlie is making fun of his younger sister that he starts to laugh. </p><p>
  <em>My sister, who I think I've mentioned before, has graced our ears with a valentine song to none other than Harry Potter. She's currently a first year with a very serious crush, and started it off by mentioning that “his eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad.”</em>
</p><p>He goes on to share the rest of the song, but Newt mainly focuses on the first line.</p><p>Newt's not laughing at the youngest Weasley, no- he thinks it's quite sweet, actually. </p><p>Well, others might not, but he's been in nearly the same exact shoes as the young girl. </p><p>
  <em>“I've only ever seen that in-”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Salamanders.”</em>
</p><p>Tina comes into the living room to see Newt in the chair, laughing his ass off.</p><p>“Newt?” she asks. </p><p>“Would it have been better if I wrote a song about your eyes being like a salamander’s?” Newt asks, his laughing subsiding. </p><p>“A <em>song?</em>” Tina raises her eyebrows before walking over to her husband. </p><p>“It seems as if Charlie's younger sister and I have quite a bit in common when it comes to our serious crushes.” Newt hands Tina the letter. </p><p>“Weasley?” Tina asks, taking it. She skims the letter before whacking Newt on the shoulder. “Newt! Don't laugh at her! She's eleven!”</p><p>“I'm not laughing <em>at</em> her, love!” Newt says, holding up his hands to protect himself from another whack. “I think it's sweet! I'm laughing because it's just so <em>familiar.</em>”</p><p>“Well, I may not be the boy who lived, but that would sure work on me,” Tina says, grinning. </p><p>“It did, love,” Newt adds. He stands up so he's facing Tina. </p><p>She snorts. “I don't know why.”</p><p>“Because you love me? And all my weird sayings?” </p><p>Tina sighs jokingly before grinning again. “I guess.” </p><p>She moves forward to connect their lips in a now familiar gesture. </p><p>“Your eyes are as fiery as a salamander's,” Newt starts to sing against Tina's mouth, “Your hair as brown as-”</p><p>“<em>Newt</em>,” Tina chuckles.</p><p>“-as brown as a jarvey's fur-” </p><p>“I'm going back to the garden.”</p><p>“I'm glad she's mine,” Newt continues as Tina shakes her head, walking towards the back door, “she's truly divine-”</p><p>“I love you too, Newt!” Tina calls over her shoulder.</p><p>Newt grins at himself as the door closes before he sits back down. Summoning his stationary, he starts to pen his letter back.</p><p>
  <em>Charlie,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Don't poke fun at your sister. I think it's rather sweet. You see…</em>
