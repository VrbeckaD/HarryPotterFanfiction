    <p>A/N Another wolf lake/Hp fic. Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas everyone! Hope you all enjoy it.</p><p>Warnings: check profile. </p><p>Matthew's POV </p><p>He and Emily stood just outside of Godric's Hollow. Matthew "Matt" Donner was worried about his family. </p><p>Emily's arms was one of his two children. Harrison the younger twin was a sickly boy. He had dark brown hair that fell into the little one's eyes. Eyes that were piercing green instead of the baby blue.</p><p>Matt was a member of the Wolf Lake main pack. He was one of the betas to the clan head Willard Cates. Willard had been clan head and their pack head for over a decade. </p><p>For the better part of the decade, Willard looked after the humans that lived in their town. He kept the peace between humans and skinwalkers. </p><p>The old laws however still remained. Skinwalkers could not marry a human. They most certainly could not have a child with one. </p><p>Matt had broken one of the most sacred laws in marrying Emily. She was not a skinwalker. Before he proposed he told her the truth. She had not rejected him as he thought she would. Emily loved him for who and what he was. </p><p>It was a rare primary mate for a wolf and a human. His secondary was far from happy to have a human chosen over her. </p><p>Still, he married Emily at the human church in the town. The other wolves disapproved but without Willard's say so they couldn't do anything. He would fight them tooth and nail if they tried. </p><p>When Emily found out she was pregnant Willard advised them to have the child out of town. That he couldn't protect them if the children were born there. They took his advice. </p><p>It worked out up until it was two babies were born instead of one. One child could possibly be forgiven as the chance was high that they would be a wolf-like him. But two was when the pack would step in. They would kill the weaker child. That child was Harrison. </p><p>Emily went to Hogwarts when she turned eleven. Her magic was strong much more so than recent generations. Wolves and humans alike had magic in Wolf Lake. Some went to Hogwarts. Most did not. </p><p>Those that didn't were taught by Sherman Blackstone. Blackstone was someone who never seemed to age. No one knew why. </p><p>Two sharp cracks drew his attention from his thoughts. A familiar red-haired woman walked up to them. Lily Potter nee Evans. Her uncle had come from Wolf Lake but was a human. She spent many summers playing with Matthew and his pack members. </p><p>Lily greeted tiredly, "Emily its been a long time."</p><p>Emily replied her voice trembling as she spoke, "Lily. Thank you so much for coming. Matt and I didn't know who else to turn to."</p><p>James inquired his hazel eyes meeting Matthew's green ones, "You said it was important? What is so important that you would come so far from the Lake? We can't stay long. Sirius is watching Alex."</p><p>Matthew sighed feeling his wolf try to come forward in its anger at the situation, "You both know that my people do not look favorably down upon those without wolf blood in them. It would the same as a pureblood wizard marrying a muggle."</p><p>Emily froze. She knew what he was and accepted him. That did not mean she accepted their laws. However, they would do anything to protect their children. Even if it meant sending one away so that he could live.</p><p>Matthew continued, "Emily had twins. One child could have been ignored or watched for the change. Two was a liability. They will kill Harrison because he is the weaker twin in their eyes."</p><p>Both Potter's exchanged a glance. They had a child of their own. Alex Potter was only a few days older than Harrison and Sophia. Lily was obviously tired but still, she came. </p><p>James asked his hazel eyes looking into Matt's green ones, "What do you need us to do?"</p><p>"Can you take him in? Please," he asked, "If they find out they will kill him. Or kill both of them."</p><p>Both Potter's looked conflicted. It was one thing to raise a child. It was completely different to take in a child that wasnt their own. </p><p>Lily whispered, "We can't let a child be harmed because it's human. James hes innocent."</p><p>James sighed. He looked back at Matt and Emily. For a moment it looked like he would refuse. Matt's heart stopped as he waited for the man's decision. </p><p>Finally, James said, "We can take him. But what do we do if he starts showing signs of being a skinwalker?"</p><p>"Contact us," Matt replied instantly, "If he shows signs of a skinwalker he will need to be with the pack."</p><p>Another sigh escaped the Potter Lord. Acceptance was in his hazel eyes. </p><p>Sadness filled both of the parents. They had to give up Harrison to ensure that he would live. If he was a skinwalker they would come back and help him. If he wasnt then he would get a safe and normal life. </p><p>Neither Potter nor the Donner's could know what would happen in just over a year's time. How things would change because of one decision late in the summer. </p><p>Voldemort's POV </p><p>Thanks to one of his most loyal Death Eaters he knew of a prophecy. The Potter's and the Longbottom's both had children born at the right time. </p><p>The Dark Lord chose the Potter's for being the closest to himself. Half-bloods by birth the twins would be powerful if allowed to grow. He could not allow that to happen. </p><p>Thanks to Pettigrew he knew the Potter Lord and his wife would be gone tonight. That they had a function to go to and only a house-elf would be looking after the twins. </p><p>Without any hesitation, he blasted the door down. Then he stalked up the stairs to where he could feel two magic sources. A simple stunner was sent at the house-elf that tried to stop him. </p><p>Then he blasted the nursery door open and stepped in. Two cribs were on the far wall. Two children were awake and staring at him.</p><p>One was screaming at the top of his lungs. He had black hair with light red tips and hazel eyes. Absolute fear was in the child's eyes. </p><p>This was Alex Potter the older of the twins. While the boy had magic it wasnt the strongest he had felt. The boy would be an average that was it.</p><p>In the second crib was a brown-haired child. He had piercing green eyes that bore into Voldemort's red ones. There was something feral in the green eyes. </p><p>Power thrummed under the child's skin. Out of the twins, this child was more likely to be the child of prophecy. </p><p>Voldemort raised his wand to point at the child's forehead. He said, "Avada Kedevra."</p><p>A bright golden shield formed between him and the child. It forced the killing curse back at him. The Dark Lord had no time to react as it hit him. Almost unheard was the wolf howl that sounded with it. </p><p>The room exploded causing the roof to collapse. A stray piece of debris hit Alex Potter leaving a deep gash on his arm. However the lightning bolt scar on Harrison's forehead.</p>
