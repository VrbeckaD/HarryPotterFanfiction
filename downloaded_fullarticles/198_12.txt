    <p align="justify">Draco Malfoy was lost. He was lost in a dark tunnel. But at the end of his tunnel, just like at the end of every other tunnel, there was a light. And Draco's light was known under the name "Harry Potter". Draco liked the name. He liked the boy. Maybe he liked both a bit too much. Blaise once kept count and it seems like Draco used the word "Potter" in average 32 times a day. Even Draco realised that this was a lot more than he should actually say it.<br/><br/>Draco found himself so ridiculous and he was ashamed of what he felt for the Chosen One. Draco hated it when people called Potter like that. He was a lot more than the Chosen One. He was a saviour, he was a noble knight, he was a dream, he was... Draco stared into the darkness. Not the darkness of the tunnel, that was just a metaphor. He stared into the darkness of his room at Malfoy Manor.<br/><br/>Eighth year was just around the corner and Draco was not excited. It were summer holidays, what once had been Draco's favourite time of the year, because he was at home. Now he hated this time... because he was at home. But he didn't want to go back to Hogwarts, not now. He would rather go where ever Harry Potter was.<br/><br/>Draco was scared. Not for himself, for Potter. Draco feared that Potter would risk his life this year again. Just like every other year before. Even though Voldemort was gone now and most of the Deatheaters were locked up, Draco just had a feeling that this year wasn't going to be an easy one for Potter. Draco somehow felt in his heart that something was going to worry Potter and that something wasn't going to be alright. Draco would have loved to know what was going to worry Potter and he would have loved to help him, but there was one problem - they were supposed to hate each other. Draco couldn't just go up to his "arch enemy" and ask him if everything is alright. And Potter wouldn't answer him. He wouldn't just blurt out his personal problems and tell Draco about his life, because Potter hated Draco and Draco kind of hated Potter.<br/><br/>Draco didn't know how love felt. Maybe this was love, maybe it wasn't. He didn't know. Deep down in his heart he had always liked Potter, but Draco also hated him. He hated him so much. Potter had always been better at everything than Draco. Potter was the boy who got most of the attention from Draco's father because of his job, so Draco's father never had any time for Draco himself. And maybe Draco hated him for not liking him back, for making Draco feel such ridiculous things? And Draco especially hated Potter because he was an annoying prick. His smile made Draco want to punch him in the face and his green eyes made Draco want to vomit. Draco hated him.<br/><br/>His room felt so cold and empty. Just as Draco felt himself. He decided that he wouldn't sleep anymore and stood up. With a flick of his wand, he put on a dim light in his room. Draco walked over to his shelf, where a small box was standing. He took it, sat back down on his bed and opened it. The box was filled with old newspapers. He pulled out the first one and Draco smiled a bit. He read the article that told nothing but Potter being a hero and the Chosen One. Draco nearly knew the article by heart.<br/><br/>Every newspaper contained at least one article about Harry Potter and Draco read them all for maybe the thousandth time. He started to collect these newspapers with his mother when he was a little boy and a big fan of Potter's, but even though he had learned to hate Potter over the years, Draco kept every newspaper that contained an article about him. "<strong>HARRY POTTER ATTENDS HOGWARTS</strong>" one headline said. Draco remembered how he had picked up this newspaper in the common room the first morning he woke up at Hogwarts. He had seen the headline and stuffed the newspaper in his robes, just to snuck it up to his room and to put it into his trolley.<br/><br/>"<strong>HARRY POTTER IN TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT</strong>" was another headline. Draco knew this article just too well. It was from Rita Skeeter.<br/>"Harry Potter attends the Triwizard Tournament even though the ministry set up a new rule. The boy had always been up for stupid and forbidden things, but this is the cherry on top. I had him and the other champions in a little interview, what can be read on page 13."<br/>Draco didn't want to read page 13. He knew that the interview was full of lies and he had hated Skeeter for writing and publishing such things.<br/><br/>Draco read every newspaper until he came to the second last one in the box. "<strong>HARRY POTTER SAVES WIZARDING GENERATION</strong>". Draco smiled. He opened the paper at page 9, where the article was.<br/>"The war is over, won by Harry Potter, lost by Voldemort." was the first sentence of this article. Draco thought it was such a development that now the Dark Lord's name is even standing in the newspaper. Voldemort. Draco kept reading.<br/>"The war left Hogwarts in shattered pieces, but strong wizards, including Harry Potter are about to build it up again, brick by brick. Potter recently told in an interview that he was happy to have the opportunity to help his friends and former teachers to build up their home again, because Hogwarts is and will always be his home."<br/><br/>Draco loved this article the most, because he knew this was the real Potter. It wasn't about the <em>Chosen One</em> or about the <em>rule breaker.</em> This was about Harry Potter who loved Hogwarts and who loved his friends and family. Draco lay the newspaper away and took out the last one. He stared at the headline for a few seconds.<br/>"<strong>HARRY POTTER RETURNS TO HOGWARTS</strong>"<br/>"We had Harry Potter in an interview and he told us his plans for the future. "I will go back to Hogwarts for my eighth year and finish my N.E.W.T.s, just like my best friend Hermione Granger wants me to." he told us with a smile. "Do you have any specific plans what you are going to do after your time at Hogwarts?" we asked and he nodded. He already started training for being an Auror, what had always been his dream and we are sure he will be a good one."<br/><br/>This article was the reason why Draco was going back to Hogwarts. Not Blaise, his only friend that returned to the school, but the fact that Potter was going as well. Of course, everyone at Hogwarts, apart from Blaise, hated Draco, but at least Potter hated him as well. And as long as Potter was there to argue  with Draco, the year had to be alright.<br/><br/>Even though Draco had been one hundred percent sure he wasn't going to find sleep this night, he fell asleep, the newspaper still in his hand and a smile on his face.</p>
