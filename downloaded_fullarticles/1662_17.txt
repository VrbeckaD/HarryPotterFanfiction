</p><hr/><p align="left"><em>James</em><em>. Who could possibly have the middle name</em> <em>J</em><em>ames</em><em>?</em> Draco growled to himself for the hundredth time, pulling his sleeve down to hide the black ink that had been there since his twelfth birthday, when he had inherited it. Just as everyone else did.  </p><p>Hoisting his school bag on to his shoulder, Draco trudged on through the hallway, ignoring the usual chatter about the names. <em>W</em><em>ho cares about these stupid names anyways? They aren't even that important. </em>The school bell rang as Draco shoved past the people around him.  </p><p>Suddenly, a bushy brown-haired girl stepped in the way of Draco’s aggressive stride. He raised an eyebrow at her, moving to walk around her. She followed, standing her ground. Draco sighed, knowing this must be important. </p><p>“What is it, Granger?” Draco drawled, rubbing a hand over his face in attempt to wake up his drowsy features.  </p><p>“Please, Draco, you very well know my name by now,” Hermione mused, “But anyways. I have the perfect thing for you.” Draco made a motion with his hand for her to go on. </p><p>“We got you a date.” Draco rolled his eyes, knowing that Hermione and Pansy’s ‘dates’ for him were always terrible. On one of them, a boy had come in a full clown costume, makeup and everything. This was of course Pansy’s idea, as she was the only one who knew he was afraid of clowns. It may sound silly, but to Draco that’s terrifying. Draco shuddered at the thought. </p><p>“Thanks, but no thanks.” Draco replied, walking around the tan-skinned girl. Hermione huffed, quickening her pace to keep up with Draco’s long-legged strides. </p><p>“But you’ll like this one, I promise!” Hermione exclaimed, waving her arms around in emphasis. Draco never understood why the two girls bothered with his love life; he was already set with living the rest of his life alone, with the company of his three cats. After establishing their own relationship with each other, they took it upon themselves to find someone for Draco as well. And Draco hated it. </p><p>“Oh yeah?” Draco asked, fighting the urge to roll his eyes, “Who is this mystery boy, then?” </p><p>“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you,” Hermione smirked, folding her arms across her chest. Draco lost the inner battle with himself and rolled his eyes sarcastically. </p><p>“Granger, if you want me to do this you do have to tell me the person-”  </p><p>“It’s Harry Potter.”   </p><p>Draco gasped involuntarily, before violently choking on air. Hermione held back a laugh as she whacked Draco on the back. When he could breathe again, his jaw dropped open in shock. The girl closed Draco’s mouth, only to have it open again. Harry Potter is not only one of the most popular people in the school, but also Draco’s longtime crush of two years. </p><p>“<em>T</em><em>he </em>Harry Potter? You’re joking.” Draco started, nearly laughing at his own stupidity for even believing it for a second. “You must be.” </p><p>“I assure sure you I am not,” Hermione said in mock seriousness, clear amusement painted across her features. Draco came to the sudden realization that they were standing in the middle of the hallway when someone roughly shoved passed him. Draco scoffed, before starting to walk down the hall again.  </p><p>“But how? No <em>sane</em> person would want to date me of all people, let alone him.” Draco muttered, the truth of his words sinking in a little more than he intended.  </p><p>“Hey now, don’t get all depressed on me, Dray.” Hermione said, nudging him with her shoulder, though due to height difference, she shouldered him harshly in the side. Draco yelped in pain, rubbing the sore spot. Before he could retort with how he was depressed all the time, Pansy came bounding up to the pair. She squeezed in between them, wrapping an arm around Hermione, pecking her on the lips. They’ve been together for nearly three years now, having found each other during their freshman year. Draco pretended to gag, though he couldn’t help but wish he could find his soulmate too. The girls ignored him, sharing a loving look. Draco knew they were doing it to rub it in his face.  </p><p>“Hey love.” Pansy said, smiling brightly at her girlfriend. She looked up at Draco and ruffled his hair. “What’s got you all down in the dumps?” Draco gasped, frantically patting his hair back in place. He shot her a scowl, but she didn’t see it. </p><p>“I told him about his new date.” Hermione answered for him, wiggling her dark eyebrows.  </p><p>“You told him without me? Damn, I wanted to see his reaction.” Pansy pouted, earning a glare from Draco and an apologetic kiss on the cheek from Hermione. </p><p>“Sorry,” Hermione said sheepishly, “I just couldn’t wait to tell him. And he was definitely shocked.” </p><p>Hermione stopped in the hallway and mocked Draco’s expression from before, her jaw dropping identically. Pansy laughed, before interlocking her fingers with Hermione’s, walking once more. Draco huffed in his demise, crossing his arms while trying to remember, why exactly was he friends with them again? Before realizing that they were the only ones who cared enough to even talk to him, bringing him into an even more depressing slump. </p><p>“Relax, Drake, we’re only teasing.” Pansy said lightly, worry subtly coating her voice.  </p><p>“Hm? Oh, yeah, I know.” Draco replied, trailing off, still far away in his thoughts. The two girls shared a knowing look. </p><p>“So, about that date with Harry Potter.” Pansy started. Draco jumped, as if the words physically shocked him. “Will you do it?”  </p><p>“How do I know you’re not lying just to get me to go out with this random person?” Draco replied, narrowing his eyes accusingly at the pair. Pansy crossed her heart with her free hand, bringing her hand to her forehead in mock salute.  </p><p>“Scout’s honor,” </p><p>“You were never a girl scout-” </p><p>“Shh, it’s the thought that counts.” </p><p align="center">~✩~</p><p>Hours later, Draco sat in his history class, doodling aimlessly on the paper in front of him. The teacher, Mr. Binns, droned on about the civil war or something, while Draco looked up at the clock for what was probably the thousandth time. Draco sighed, willing time to go by faster, in hopes to get to his next class, pre-calculus, also known as the one class that Draco had with Harry, meaning his favorite class.  </p><p>Draco had tried many times to rid himself of this pesky crush, but it seemed to just get worse. i mean come on. the boy is <em>gorgeous. </em>The way his curls fall messily into his eyes. The fluorescent emerald green eyes that shimmered in the light, hidden behind adorable glasses. His stupid scar etched onto his forehead from who-knows-what, that he tries so hard to cover with his messy fringe. His nicely toned muscles (don’t ask where he got this information) and his caramel-like skin that Draco couldn’t help but want to lic- wait. Is that going too far?</p><p>AND he was openly bi! Draco sighed in contentment, allowing a fond smile to grace his features.   </p><p>Though he’d rather be hung by his boxers on the flagpole in front of the school than to admit this, Draco knew he was head-over-heels for the stupid Potter boy.  </p><p>The worst part was, Draco knew he could never be with him. Not only is Harry out of his league; he just so happens to be the most popular boy at Hogwarts High. Cliché, right? And not even the mean popular, where they pick on whoever they can, whenever they want, just because they think highly of themselves. But the nice popular, who gets along with any and every one without excluding the lesser ones in the process. Not to mention he’s more athletic than Draco could ever be and more. </p><p>The bell rang, breaking Draco from his Harry-induced thoughts. Draco was surprised to find that he was the first out of his seat and out the door, having little to no athletic ability and prone to getting out of breath from just walking up a flight of stairs. </p><p>He quickly made it to his next class and sat in his usual seat, conveniently behind Harry. Speaking, more like thinking, of Harry, Draco thought about his so-called date with the boy; whether he chose to believe Pansy or not he wasn’t sure, but he would have to find out himself. </p><p>On cue, said boy walked in, surrounded by his guy friends, a few giggling girls trailing close behind. Draco couldn't help but stare. Something was different about him. He wasn't talking much and was adamantly searching the room, most likely for someone. Harry's eyes soon found Draco's, emerald green on blue-gray. Both boys felt a jolt go through their bodies, as if they were electrocuted. Draco jumped, quickly dropping his eyes to his desk and pretending to be writing something down, his face heating up in a bright red flush. Draco sighed, knowing he made himself look like some creep.  </p><p>Harry smiled slightly, almost fondly, habitually rubbing the word across his palm in dark black letters with his thumb. </p><p><b><em>Lucius</em></b><b><em>.</em> </b> </p><p align="center">~✩~</p><p>Draco flopped down in his usual seat at their lunch table, letting his head fall onto the surface. Pansy and Hermione shared a worried look, but for once stayed quiet, waiting for him to be ready to talk. </p><p>"I don't think I can do it, Pans," The blonde mumbled after a few moments of silence, his voice muffled by the table.  </p><p>"Why not, Drake," pansy asked softly. she grabbed his right hand in hers and held it in a comforting gesture. This was one of the times Draco was grateful for having these two as his friends.  </p><p>"Scared, Malfoy?" Hermione teased, though he knew she was joking. He nodded, not feeling up to giving his usual retort. The girls shared a worried look again; something was terribly wrong. Even on his worst days he'd at least give them a curt 'fuck off,' "I was joking." </p><p>"I know," Draco replied, before falling silent again. every thought was running through his mind at a rapid pace, unable to settle on one.  </p><p>"Okay, cut the shit, Drake. Tell us what's wrong," Pansy snapped, before adding at Hermione's look, "please." </p><p>"I just can't do it. He probably thinks I'm some creep."  </p><p>Pansy was becoming frustrated with him at his lack of explanation, telling by the way she was gripping his hand. Hermione was quick to grab her free one in attempt to console her. The black-haired girl took a deep breath and nodded at her girlfriend.  </p><p>"He was the one who asked us, you know." </p><p>Draco's head snapped up, so fast he pulled a muscle in his neck. He hissed, rubbing the sore spot.  </p><p>"Stop lying."  </p><p>"I promise we're not! Give us a little credit, will you? It's not like we lie to you <em>all </em>the time." Pansy replied, rolling her eyes slightly, "Besides. What would we even get out of lying to you?" </p><p>Draco shrugged, "A good laugh at my demise." </p><p>Pansy held down the urge to scream at him, not understanding why he was being so difficult. If anything, he should be at least a little happy; this was what he had been waiting for for years.  </p><p>Suddenly, an idea popped into her mind and she smiled. Draco watched as she let go of his hand and whipped out her phone, typing a few things in.  </p><p>Standing, Pansy smirked down at him, "I'll just go ask him myself."  </p><p>Draco blanched, opening his mouth to protest, but quickly shutting it as she walked over to the popular table. He looked at Hermione, who shrugged, a small proud smile on her face. The blonde groaned, dropping his head back down into his former position. </p><p>Meanwhile, Pansy walked up to Harry, her phone behind her back, ignoring the stares of the others at the popular table. He smiled at her, recognition flitting across his face. </p><p>"Would you come with me for a sec?" she asked, subtly hitting the record button. Harry nodded, letting his friends know he'd be back. The table erupted in whispers as they walked out into the hallway, stopping just outside of the cafeteria.  </p><p>"What's up?" </p><p>"About that date..." Pansy started, "you'll still do it, right?" </p><p>"The one with Draco Malfoy?" harry asked, furrowing his eyebrows slightly. She nodded in confirmation, "Of course. Didn't I already tell you this?" </p><p>"O-Oh, well, I just wanted to make sure." Pansy stuttered out, forcing a smile on his face. "Draco's kind of skeptical." <em>H</em><em>e's </em><em>gonna</em><em> hate me for saying that, </em>Pansy thought, but shrugged it off. </p><p>"Ah, okay. Well, tell him I said hi," Harry said, turning to go back into the room, though he stopped, "Oh, by the way... between you and me, I've liked him since freshman year." </p><p>Harry winked at her and walked off, leaving a startled Pansy in his wake. She had always wondered why she'd never seen Harry date anyone, when basically everyone threw themselves at his feet. The dark-haired girl pressed stop on the recording, a bright smile breaking out onto her face as she practically ran back to their table.  </p><p>"You'll never guess what I just found out!" </p><p align="center">~✩~</p><p>"Oh my god, I might cry." Draco said, having just listened to the recording, pulling Pansy into an awkward hug across the table, "What did I ever do to deserve you?" </p><p>Pansy chuckled, "Oh, don't get all sentimental on me now." She couldn't help but be happy for her friend, knowing this is probably the happiest he's felt in years. She felt him shake slightly in her arms, "Are you actually crying?" </p><p>"I don't know," Draco laughed, pulling away from the embrace, wiping his eyes on his jacket sleeve of the happy tears found there. Hermione giggled at the sight; she'd never seen Draco cry in the years that she's known him, even if they were just happy tears. Draco found that he couldn't stop the large smile on his face, even when he could feel a certain curly-haired boy, smiling fondly despite the weird looks from his friends, looking his way.  </p>
