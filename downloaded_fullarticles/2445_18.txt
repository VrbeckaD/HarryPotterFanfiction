          <div class="userstuff"><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Nobody believed that Tom Riddle and Harry Potter were together.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Like, together <em>together.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In a romantic, <em>loving</em> way together.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Nobody believed it. It was just too… weird. And out of this world.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They didn’t even talk. Like Ron and Hermione did. Like Neville and Luna did. <em>Those</em> were couples that were always talking. But Riddle and Potter? You’d be lucky to see them in the same room. The only time they ever really talked was when they needed to. As Tom was Head Boy and Potter was a Gryffindor prefect. They were work buddies at most.</span>
</p><p class="p2">Also, they were too… too much of an opposite to be in a relationship. Harry was bubbly and cheerful and so so <em>innocent</em>. He was friends with absolutely everyone and everyone adored him. Harry Potter was cute and harmless and can be seen mostly trying to chunk down sweets every class.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom, on the other hand… Tom was another thing altogether. Tom was rather serious, smart, accomplished in a very proud way. He preferred dark magic. He kept only a close knit few around him. All of them purebloods and all of them carrying very prestigious family names. And it was no secret that he could talk to snakes. He really was the apex of Slytherin—ambitious and dark.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom would probably swallow Harry whole if given the chance.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">And third of all, and perhaps the most important <em>solid</em> argument to be made was that Tom and Harry were never<em> ever</em> seen in a public display of affection. That was just it. They have never engaged in PDA.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was stupid to even think about it. It was preposterous to even suggest it. At this point, it was just disrespectful really to even talk about it. It was… it could never… what would it even look like if they…</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Merlin.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So as you can see… there was absolutely, no way in <em>hell</em> that Tom Riddle and Harry Potter were together.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They just weren’t.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And whoever started the rumor probably should count their days because even if Harry was going to find it amusing… Tom wouldn’t. The Slytherin was very unforgiving. And everyone knew that.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Except Lavender Brown claimed that he heard it from Tom Riddle’s very own lips. And who would believe that something like “Harry and I are in a relationship. Yes, <em>Potter</em>. Yes. A <em>relationship</em>. Yes. <em>That</em> kind of relationship.” would ever come out of the Head Boy’s mouth?</span>
</p><p class="p2">Well, anyway, ever since the whole of Hogwarts have tried to dismiss the rumor altogether but they have also, if they were being honest with themselves, observing the two with hawk-like eyes ever since the rumor broke out.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There wasn’t one person not looking at the both of them and trying to find any sort of interaction between the two. Were they secretly looking at each other? Having eye contact when they thought no one was looking? Maybe they touched hands when they passed by each other?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And why, exactly would they keep something like this a secret?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">What would they lose? The respect of their houses? </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Probably. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Speculation ran through everyone’s heads at Hogwarts at the possibility of a Gryffindor and a Slytherin coupling.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Has it ever even happened before? Can two mortal enemy houses really be in a relationship?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Of course not. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There was too much hatred between the two houses. It didn’t help that Harry came from a long line of Gryffindors and Tom was pretty much Salazar Slytherin’s direct and only living heir.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But one day, Harry and Tom were seen together.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mostly because Harry accidentally walked into the taller boy while the Gryffindor was chatting quite merrily with his friends. Rumor has it that Tom helped gather Harry’s books <em>and</em> get this: their hands touched.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">For two seconds.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If that wasn’t enough to once again make everyone go crazy with speculation, another incident was.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Apparently, during a prefect meeting, the two sat together.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And their arms brushed quite often.</span>
</p><p class="p2">But that was that.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Three months passed and nobody ever saw anything again.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Everyone’s almost forgotten about it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Until Ron, bless his heart, loudly said, “You know, Harry, everyone’s wondering,” there was an immediate hush in Gryffindor table. “Are you dating Tom Riddle?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There was a sudden silence in the whole hall as Harry choked on his drink.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What?” Harry’s ears turn red.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I-uh,” Ginny elbows Ron in the ribs. “Are you dating Tom Riddle?” Ron almost shouts.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The four great houses of Hogwrarts looked back and forth at Harry and Tom, who was looking at the scene with what appeared to be disinterest.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I-I-“ Harry eyes shoot up to where Tom was sitting, eyes widening and then lowering again all the while blushing a deeper shade of red. He fists his hands on his robes.</span>
</p><p class="p2">Suddenly, Tom stands from where he was seated from across the Slytherin table.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Everyone watches as he walks towards, you guessed it<em>,</em> at the Gryffindor table and stops at where Harry is seated.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">You can almost hear everyone holding their breath.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Until Tom puts his hands on Harry’s robe, pulls him up effortlessly, and gives him, a rather, R-rated kiss that made everyone gasp in response.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Does that answer your question?” Tom asks Ron coolly. Harry beside him is looking at Tom with his mouth wide open. “What?” Tom asks him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I-I-“ Harry stutters.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s about bloody time they found out. I’m tired of hiding it.” Tom says as he starts slowly making his way back to the Slytherin table like he did not just render the whole school speechless with this whole charade.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom turns as if he forgot something. “See you later, babe.” He says casually to Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry nods slightly, still very red at the cheeks. Bellatrix squirms from the Slytherin table.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Okay,” Harry squeaks. But Tom is still looking at him expectantly, like was waiting for something, a small frown in his face. Harry's eyes widen as he swallows in understanding. "Babe." He adds. Tom nods with a smirk on his lips and walks away.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> It was <em>definitely</em> Lavender Brown who fainted at her seat.</span>
</p><p class="p2">Now, who would have thought?</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom Riddle and Harry Potter were actually really together.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Like, together <em>together</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Like in a romantic, <em>loving</em> way together.</span>
