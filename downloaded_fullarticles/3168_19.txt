    <p>“Now, as everyone in this hall knows, Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining strength.” Dumbledore spoke, letting the silence underline his words. “I cannot emphasise strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is, and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe. The magical fornications have been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new and more powerful ways, but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff. I urge you, therefore, to abide by any security restrictions that your teachers might impose on you, however irksome you might find them – in particular, the rule that you should not be out of bed after hours. I implore you, should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle, to report it to a member of staff immediately. I trust you to conduct yourselves, always, with the utmost regard for your own and each other’s safety. As always the forbidden forest stays on the list of places a student shouldn’t be able to find themselves, the third floor is ones again off limits to anyone and I was asked by Mr. Flitch to remind you that his office is only to be entered on his invitation.”</p><p>Dumbledore’s blue eyes swept over the student before he smiled ones more.</p><p>“but now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish, and I know that your top priority is to be well-rested for your lessons tomorrow. Let us therefore say goodnight. Pip pip!”</p><p>Hearing the thundering sounds of people pulling back the benches Hermione stayed seated for a moment, ‘the third floor is ones again off limits,’ she thought. ‘Could Dumbledore have hidden something else in there?’ Feeling several pairs of eyes look at her, she looked up.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“What does it mean?” Ron asked, Ginny and Harry where also still sitting waiting for her to explain Dumbledore’s speech.</p><p>“The short version is; He-who-must-not-be-named is bad, look out for others when you’re out of the castle, secret entrances are off limits and probably sealed. There is a chance Death eaters might try to slip in, and that something else is hidden in the third floor corridor.”</p><p>Stretching her arms above her head till she heard a pop. She turned around and stood up.</p><p>“First years could you please follow me,” she called out to the group of first years that seemed uncertain where they were going. ‘It was good to be back,’ she thought walking up to the little witches and wizards. ‘let’s get this over with.’</p><p>“Ron, could you run ahead to let the others in?” She called over her shoulder to the boy who was still milling over her explanation of the speech.</p><p>“Sure,” Ron called out and he made his way past the first years rushing ahead to the Gryffindor common room.</p><p>“Are you really a which?” One of the first years asked her when she was leading them out of the hall, to the left up one of the moving staircases.</p><p>“Abbot, right?” Hermione asked, before looking if they had all managed to get onto the staircase before it moved to its new destination. “Yes, Miss.”</p><p>“Hermione is fine, and to answer your question; yes I am a witch. Could you all follow me, the hallways are a bit cramped so keep close.” She called to the tail of the new Gryffindor’s group. A duo of boys had already pulled out their wand and had an insidious look in their eyes before she called on them. They reminded her of the twins, ‘let’s hope they don’t make as much ruckus as them,’ she hoped.</p><p>Turning the corner of the hallway she looked up to see if Ron had reached the common room already to let in the other Gryffindor’s in. Not noticing any other students she concluded that he had been able to let them in.</p><p>“Hermione, can I ask you another question?” The girl asked waking up next to her.</p><p>“You can,” She told her.</p><p>“Is it true that you are friends with the boy-who-lived?”</p><p>Sighing, she thought for a second about her answer. Would she tear down their hero-complex now or would she let them live for a few more days in bliss of ignorance? She knew that the view of the wider Magical world was an distorted version of reality, they viewed Harry as the Chosen-one.</p><p>“I’m friends with Harry,” she told Abbot and the few others who were walking close behind. She wondered if they had waited all night to ask her, she might be reading a bit far into it.</p><p>“But, now you are part of Gryffindor you will all have the pleasure of hanging out with Harry,” she told them, making a note to remind herself to warn Harry about the group of enthusiastic first years she’d just set loose on him.</p><p>Arriving at the Fat lady, she told her the password, “ardenti sugar.” The portrait swung open to let them enter. A feeling of familiarity washed over her when she walked into the chamber. Five years she had spent here, or like five and three quarter years counting the time-turner.</p><p>“Your dormitories can be found on the sixth floor through those doors,” she told them, “Boys are on the right and girls on the left. Boys, you aren’t allowed in the girls dormitories, got it?” She asked, when a few of them nodded she decided that they could be left alone for now.</p><p>Walking away from them she settled into one of the open armchairs in front of the fire, she found some of the other students talking among themselves. Letting out a relaxing sigh, Harry noticed that she’d arrived.</p><p>“Hey, Hermione we saved you a cup of tea.” He said handing her a steaming cup. Taking it she noticed how cold she really was, Hogwarts while powered by a lot of magic could do with some kind of central heating.</p><p>Harry had leaned back and was pinned onto the seat by Ginny who was loudly arguing with Ron about the chess game they were playing. Ginny had laid herself flat-out on the chair across Harry, he didn’t seem to mind. She had the feeling that he liked to be distracted from what was happening elsewhere. A moment of peace she pondered taking a sip from the tea.</p><p>“So, do you have any idea what could be on the third floor?” Harry asked softly, not wanting to interrupt the Weasley’s heated discussion.</p><p>“Not really,” she confessed, “Have you tried to look on the map if there is someone there?” She asked, suddenly thinking about it.</p><p>“I hadn’t,” he said, “give me a second to get it.” He pushed Ginny gently off him before standing up.</p><p>“Where are you going?” Ron asked noticing that his sister had stopped arguing.</p><p>“I’ll be right back, just going to get something.” Harry called back, walking into the boys dormitories tower. Ron took this moment to start arguing with Ginny again, defending his position that his tower had made a totally legal move. He disappeared from sight, she could hear a door opening. A few moments later she could hear him descending the stairs with a folded piece of parchment.</p><p>“Here we go,” he settled back in his seat folding out the parchment. Putting his wand in the centre, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” The map spread out to the edge and the ink filled all the little feet and walls that made up Hogwarts. He was already folding out the layers of parchment looking for the third floor part.</p><p>Hermione leaned over to take closer look at the familiar layout of the rooms that she had overcome in their first year. There was the round room which had contained the devil’s snare, the key room, giant chess, potion riddle and then the room that contained the mirror of Eresid. Now though they could see something else, there was a pair of ink shoes with a name.</p><p>“Who is Bellatrix Black?” Harry asked, reading the name out.</p><p>The Weasley’s stopped arguing, looking over to the two of them. “What name did you say?”</p><p>“Bellatrix Black.” Harry repeated watching the map closer, looking if the figure would move.</p><p>“I heard dad talk about her, she was with You-know-who during the first war. But she disappeared a few weeks before He disappeared himself. He told us that she was missing or presumed dead.” Ron told them.</p><p>Pondering on what Ron said, she leaned back in her armchair. Sipping on her tea.</p><p>The clocktower rung twelve at that moment.</p><p>“Well whatever happened to her can wait for tomorrow.” Harry said suddenly realising how late it really was.</p><p>Hermione got up and bid her adieu, waiting for Ginny to get up she left for her room. Saying goodnight to Ginny, she opened the door and greeted Fay and Parvati before undressing and slipping under the covers. They were as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish.</p><p align="center">-</p><p>The morning sun shone through the towers window, waking Hermione. This first week had been a lot, they hadn’t been kidding when they told them it was much harder this year. She’d been able to finish her homework before the weekend so she had time to relax and just spend the day at the edge of the lake with Luna and Ginny, reading one of the books that she had taken with her.</p><p>They had agreed to hang out yesterday when she noticed that the boys hadn’t started on their work. She would probably look over their work later today. But right now she didn’t want to think about it, she just wanted to go get breakfast.</p><p>Throwing on a t-shirt and jeans, she descended to the common room and looked out over the lake. It looked lovely this time of day, the sunrise had just happened and the dew was glistering. It was going to be a good day she decided.</p><p>Walking out of the common room she heard someone call out her name.</p><p>“Hermione!” A voice called out, turning around she could see Abbot running up.</p><p>“Hi, Abbot,” she said waiting in the portrait hole letting the little girl catch up.</p><p>“Do you have a question?” Hermione asked her, she had spent the last week asking a lot of questions. Which didn’t bother her at all, the small girl always asked smart questions.</p><p>“I do,” she stated, “why can’t we go to the third floor?” She then asked.</p><p>“Headmaster Dumbledore said we weren’t allowed, so that’s why.” She told her, not letting the Death eater theory know to the first year.</p><p>“But why?” She asked.</p><p>“I don’t know, Abbot, if he wanted us to know why he would have told us.” She told the girl honestly, thinking back to all the times that Dumbledore had held back information for their own best will. He worked in mysterious ways, like Nostradamus only after the facts did his actions seem to make sense.</p><p>Abbot seemed to be disappointed with the answer but seemed to realise that it was the best one she would get without asking the headmaster herself.</p><p>Hermione said goodbye to her before leaving for breakfast. The great hall was still fairly empty when she entered, she could see that a few of the Hufflepuffs where already eating and they greeted her when she walked in. She took her seat towards the entrance of the hall on the Gryffindor table. The Daily Prophet was dropped of when she filled her bowl with cereal.</p><p>It talked about the increased treat that You-know-who posed to the Magical world, there was a rumour that he was trying to break the remaining Dead eaters out of Azkaban. There was also a small story about the ministries attempts to relaunch the Triwizard tournament, but that didn’t seem to be going anywhere. She turned the paper round to find the crossword puzzle that was included in the weekend editions.</p><p>Getting caught in the puzzle she didn’t notice that the hall was slowly filling up, at least the other tables. The Gryffindor table stayed mostly empty, their house wasn’t known for early risers when they didn’t have to. Around ten she had finished most of the puzzle and Luna had taken a seat across of her, looking up she noticed that the Quibbler was the right way up.</p><p>“Good morning, Luna.” She greeted her friend.</p><p>“Morning Hermione.” Luna said dreamy, sounding unsure of what she had said but deciding that it was probably fine.</p><p>Greetings out of the way she finished the puzzle and started to pack a picknick for Ginny. She would be joining them later, Harry and her Where at quidditch try-outs. They weren’t expected to be finished before half past ten.</p><p>“Care to join me?” She asked of Luna.</p><p>Luna didn’t react other that standing up and walking towards the exit of the hall still reading the magazine. Unfazed by the group of Ravenclaws that just burst through, missing her by a hair.</p><p>The walk towards the lake was pleasant, the summer was still able to provide the warmed to keep the cool morning at bay. They were only about halfway across the law before, she could see Ginny approaching. Harry was not far behind, he waved before retreating to the castle.</p><p>“How did it go?” She asked Ginny.</p><p>“Gonna be honest, could be worse.” She said taking the basket filled with the picknick to the shore. The surface of the water was as smooth as a mirror, the reflection of the mountains in it would have been worth a picture. Pity she didn’t have a camera with her.</p><p>Before she knew it they had settled down on the shore, the sun dispersed the few clouds that speckled the Scottish countryside. The day was as expected very calm and summerlike. She could almost fall asleep here, reading her book in the company of friends. But something still didn’t feel right. She thought back to the first day that they had come back to Hogwarts.</p><p>‘Bellatrix Black’, the name stuck in her head since the first time she had heard it. There was something about her name that intrigued her. In her limited time that doing housework left her she spend researching the black family and she had send an owl to Sirius for information. Hadn’t heard anything back though.</p><p>“Hermione are you going to read that book the whole day?” Ginny yelled from the lake. She’d changed into a bad pack and was swimming with Luna who was laying on one of the rocks further in the lake.</p><p>Hermione put her book down, ‘let’s enjoy the last few moment of summer’ she though. Bellatrix isn’t going anywhere anyway.</p>
