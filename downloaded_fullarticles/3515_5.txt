    <p dir="ltr">In the great hall Pansy Parkinson couldn't help but stare at the couple or rather more at <em>him</em>, Draco Malfoy: the prince of Slytherin, heir to the malfoy fortune, sitting so close to <em>her</em>, Hermione Granger: muggleborn witch, Gryffindor Princess, and the smartest witch of her age. They were sitting close so together that she was very sure nothing could tear the pair apart they were always together except when they had separate classes and even then, she couldn't get his attention! He would just listen to the proffessor and take notes if he needed to.</p><p dir="ltr">What made Granger so special? He had witches throwing themselves at him (Pansy herself was included in that of course) but he turned them all down! Just so he could be in a relationship with Granger. From where she was sitting with her fellow slytherins, she could see Draco, <em>her</em> Draco whispering something in the head girl's ear causing her to playfully hit his shoulder while her cheeks tinged pink. A telltale sign that he made her blush. She could see plain as day the grin he gives her and watches as he kisses her hair.</p><p dir="ltr">Ugh! Disgusting. -She wishes that it was her instead of Granger that was by his side.-</p><p dir="ltr">The couple -A shudder goes down her spine at that- she notes seems to be in their world, not paying attention to the other students in the great hall, especially with inter-house unity being much more common now, whenever Granger moves even the slightest inch so does he. Does he know that he's doing it without realizing? How <em>in sync</em> they seem to be?Â </p><p dir="ltr">To make matters worse they were the 'IT' couple of Hogwarts! It should have been her and Draco as the popular couple! Not him and <em>Granger</em>. Pansy tried to concentrate on the food that was on her plate, but her eyes drifted back to the couple at the Gryffindor table.</p><p dir="ltr">They were still whispering to each other without a care in the world while taking bites of their food. She could see the lovey dovey smiles they gave each other, it made her <em>sick</em>. She felt like she was going to get cavities just from looking at them.</p><p dir="ltr">Thank <em>Merlin</em>, she left the great hall before they did.</p><p dir="ltr">When she spots them again, it's under a tree with Granger reading a book (she rolls her eyes at that) and Draco with his head in her lap and she can see that they're relaxed on a saturday afternoon. Luckily she's at a far away distance so they don't notice her as if they would. Even from where she's standing it is obvious that the both of them, especially Draco are <em>content. </em></p><p dir="ltr">She huffs and walks away leaving the couple to their own devices<em>. </em></p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Surely his parents don't agreee with his relationship with the mudblood! </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">When she brings it up to Draco that evening after everyone else has gone to bed, she almost wishes she hadn't especially when his grey eyes have gone cold after calling Granger a mudblood and his tone is icy as he tells her to never call his witch that ever again(she almost winces at that. <em>She</em> wanted to be his witch.) and that both of his parents approve of his relationship with Hermione She almost blanches at the love sick expression that crosses his face for a moment before it's replaced with that cold look again and it's like he's seeing <em>right through</em> her. Without another word, he walks past her to go to bed.</p><p dir="ltr">In that moment Pansy Parkinson <em>hates</em> Hermione Granger with every fiber of her being.</p>
