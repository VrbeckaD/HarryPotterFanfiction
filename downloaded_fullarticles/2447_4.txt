    <p>Draco sighed. Everything was such a mess now. What had started as a quite decent attempt to crack down on privacy invading gossip had turned into a full on censoring war. Nothing was allowed anymore.</p><p>No art about people because that could be insulting even if they were actually politically motivated cartoons. No unsolicited interviews which meant publishing the answer to a simple question now required three hours worth of paperwork. No shocking content lest the younger audience wouldn’t be able to stomach it and for some reason no <em>female presenting nipples</em>.</p><p>Which had led to the hilarious yet depressing result that Draco’s in-drag photoshoot from a Witch Weekly edition published last year was now banned.</p><p>It was all crazy stupid and it would be funny if it didn’t also mean that Draco’s safe house advertisements and folders were now officially illegal. He’d set up his home as a place of refuge for anyone who wanted to live by their own rules but couldn’t due to the people around them. It was something that might have saved him from being such a dumb arse back in the day.</p><p>He’d started it a little over five years ago after seeing the stupidly cheesy yet inspiring quote, <em>be the person you needed when you were a kid</em>. Well, he was being that person now, out and proud with his female presenting nipples and shocking content. But if the ministry continued to make rules like this there would be no one around to witness it.</p><p>And <em>that</em> would be a real crime.</p><p>“Well good morning my dear female presenting nipple friend.” Astoria wandered into the kitchen and pulled him into a hug. She beamed at him despite how shit their current situation was. “Did you sleep well?”</p><p>“I did actually. Me and my female presenting nipples had a great night.” Draco chuckled into Astoria’s neck but then grew serious. “My morning though… Not so great.”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s a giant mess, isn’t it? Blaise is still sorting out the details but as far as I can see anyone who hands out our information leaflets after the seventeenth will get fined at best and might even face jail time. And we’re already low on funds as it is.”</p><p>“Theo better up his game in the vegetable garden then if we want to feed all our hungry mouths.” Draco tried to joke, but it was a lot less funny because they might actually have to rely on that. The house was paid off, but none of the staff members had access to their family money anymore and only Blaise had a paid job. A job he’d have to give up if he kept working this much for their safe house. The last thing they needed was for him to get a burn out.</p><p>Astoria nodded, all cheeriness gone from her face. “And we’ll have to skim on the Christmas presents this year.”</p><p>“No.” Draco’s reply was sharp and allowed no counter argument. “Our busiest time is Christmas because a lot of people come here to celebrate the holidays when they have nowhere else to go. We can’t skim on the one moment of the year when our guests can be themselves.”</p><p>“But we can’t make money appear out of nowhere either, Draco.” Astoria’s face grew hard and serious. Her brilliant no nonsense attitude was what had kept the financial side of the safe house afloat all these years. “I’m sure people will understand. It’s probably quite enough for them to have a safe space.”</p><p>“A safe space that goes with a fitting binder and their first pair of heels or lipstick or that one book they’ve wanted since forever.” Draco stepped away from Astoria and glared at her. “I’m not cutting on the Christmas present. I’ll sell a family heirloom if I have to but this is the one Malfoy Family tradition I’m going to keep.”</p><p>“Draco be realistic, please.” Astoria snapped, glaring right back. “The only sellable family heirloom that you still have is your bloody engagement ring, and if you sell that then you’ll forever give up on your ability to marry. We both know how that family magic works.”</p><p>“Well I don’t see how that’s a problem.” He stuck his chin up in order to hide how much that idea hurt. He’d be giving up on his lifelong dream of a fairytale ending. But if there was one thing the war had taught him, then it was that always choosing yourself first only got you misery and pain. “There’s no one out there who wants to marry me anyway. And even if there was, Christmas is more important to me.”</p><p>Astoria eyed him with skepticism. “Fine then. If that’s the truth, then sell the ring. But I don’t support this idea.”</p><p>“Whatever.” Draco rolled his eyes and turned back to making breakfast. He had more important things to do than worry about Astoria’s opinion of him and his choices. Because with Christmas right around the corner and family tensions at a year’s high, a lot of people would be looking for a way out.</p><p>And now he couldn’t even fucking advertise for that because of the ministry and their damned <em>female presenting nipples</em>.</p>
