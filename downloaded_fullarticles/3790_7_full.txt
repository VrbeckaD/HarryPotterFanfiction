    <p>
  <span>As silent as an owl in flight, the slender figure slipped across the rough ground, easily avoiding the large gouges and pockmarks that soke of the horrendous battle that took place there. The sky was dark with angry clouds that threatened rain with the occasional flash of lightning to toss illumination around before thunder rumbled ominously. It was hard to remember the last time the sun had a chance to shine long enough to warm any of those that had found refuge in the ruins of what had once been Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Between magic and science, it was impossible to figure out if it had been Muggles or Magicals that were responsible for the state of the sky.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The figure slid past the broken doors that once greeted eager student and made his way into what had once been the Great Hall. On the dais where professors once dined while watching over their charges, there was a rough camp set up with bits of the long tables placed to one side for firewood as tents made out of various blankets and tapestries were curled around the campfire. Flipping back his hood, Harry Potter walked up to the camp and over to a tent set up in the back where various boxes and crates were stored, and he crouched down in front of a large crate that was almost completely full of miniaturized trunks. He opened the bag that had been slung across his chest and started adding more miniaturized trunks to the stash.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Did you have any trouble?” asked a raspy voice, and Harry glanced over his shoulder as Draco Malfoy approached him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shook his head as he finished unloading the bag before draping it across the crate. “I was able to clean out the last of the vaults on this run as well as find a few more books from Knockturn Alley,” he remarked as he rose to his feet and joined the rest of the Twelve, as they called themselves, at the fire. He inclined his head in thanks as Hannah Abbott handed him a battered mug of stew. “Didn’t see any other scavengers out today, but the weather probably kept them inside.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>The wealth of Gringotts is ours, and tonight we will be leaving this world for a better life,” Draco said with a smile as he settled next to Harry. Harry nodded as he slowly ate the stew and figured it was nothing more than the goblins deserved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the Muggles had joined in the war against Voldemort, the goblins had switched sides like mercenary little bastards whenever someone offered them more coin. Only, no one knew when they would change sides until they cut a large swath of destruction through their former allies. It had become self defense to start killing any goblin they came across until those greedy bastards that remained vanished deep within the earth, leaving the wealth of wizards behind. The upper vaults had quickly been looted, but the dragons that prowled the tunnels had prevented anyone from delving deeper. It had taken the Twelve survivors of Hogwarts a couple of weeks to figure out a way past the dragons without killing them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Everyone ready for the ritual tonight?” asked Susan Bones, glancing around at the others, and Harry followed her lead, seeing excitement, hope, and a touch of worry at the thought of what was to come.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had started as a joke, Hermione Granger suggesting that they run away to Rivendell to get away from the destruction of their home, but when Daphne Greengrass began to figure out the arithmancy for such a move, it became something more. A bit of hope for them, and soon, everyone was figuring out what would be needed and how they might leave this world behind for a new one. Neville Longbottom, Lavender Brown, and the Patil twins had started working on collecting various seeds and plants while Luna Lovegood, Blaise Zabini, Hermione, and Draco worked on the ritual and math with Daphne. Harry, Susan, and Hannah had worked on gathering up riches to help them buy whatever supplies they needed in the new world along with scavenging every single bit of knowledge they could, determined to preserve this world’s knowledge and wisdom for the new world’s future generations.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry glanced over at the magical clock that showed the date of December 22, 1999 and the sun slowly setting. The date of the ritual had been the only time he had seen any in this group almost come to blows with Blaise, Hermione, and Draco arguing for Halloween night as the veil between worlds was thinnest then while Luna and Daphne demanding December 22 as it was the closest full moon to the Winter Solstice. Harry himself wasn’t sure of the full details behind the ritual, but Neville and Padma had listened to both sides of the argument before suggesting the decision be put before the rest of the Twelve. Both sides had put out their arguments why their date was the best when two strange things happened to convince everyone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first was Lavender’s worn tarot deck that she shuffled when she was thinking had spit out a single card when her sure fingers had fumbled the stiff paper for the first time in Harry’s memory. The card had spun a few times before coming to rest in the center of the group, face up, to show a painted full moon shining down the land. The second was just as that card came to rest on the ground, the moon itself broke through the almost constant cloud cover to shine down on them, as if blessing them and their plan. That cinched it, even for Hermione who was the most skeptical among them when it came to omens.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Daphne followed his gaze to the clock before nodding. “We should head to the site early to ensure there isn’t anything wrong,” she remarked. “And if there is, we’ll have plenty of time to fix it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Slavedriver,” teased Blaise in a rough voice before coughing a bit. Harry glanced at him with a frown, knowing from the sound of it the Italian wizard had given away his water ration again or they were running low on that precious resource. While it might rain quite a bit, none of it was clean enough to consume even after boiling it. To be honest it had been rather scary to see how quickly humanity had poisoned the planet in only a few short years, but Harry supposed humans were a rather suicidal race.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry watched as everyone started moving to the supply tent to bundle things up for what they all hoped was the last time,and he hesitated over the last few bites of stew. Part of him wanted to bundle everyone up in wool and tuck them away somewhere safe, but thanks to Voldemort, no where in the world was truly safe anymore. Plus, none of them would appreciate his attempt at protecting them since all of them had been fighting together or separately since the end of the TriWizard Tournament. Voldemort hadn’t given anyone a chance to move against himself or his Death Eaters, and the Ministry and Hogwarts had quickly crumbled with the school holding out only a little bit longer than the government. Drunk on success and power, Voldemort had turned his attention on the Muggle world which was when things had fallen apart for everyone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>She will answer.” Harry glanced over at the dream voice to find Luna looking up at the broken ceiling, a soft smile on her face, and he felt so many of his doubts and insecurities fade in the face of the young Seer’s words. “But we will have a choice to make to unlock our full potential.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Thank you, Luna,” murmured Harry, finishing off his stew, and she gave him a sweet smile before limping over to help pack things up. She always knew the right thing to say to calm the little voices in the back of his mind that were more damaging than anything else, making him second guess and doubt his decisions. Rising stiffly to his feet, he joined his family in packing the last of their hard earned treasure up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In a little under half a hour, they had packed up their things, grabbed weapons that had been salvaged from the various suits of armor that still littered the hallways, and began picking their way across the land towards the Forbidden Forest and the stone circle hidden inside the dark trees that was their destination. It was almost ironic that the forest had survived when so much destruction had happened around it, as if the fighting factions had realized it would be death to step foot among the dark and twisted trees. The few who had sought refuge in the forest had never been seen again even as the sounds of acromantulas moving through the branches could be heard in the dark of night. Once in a while, a centaur was seen racing through the trees, but other than those few signs of life, the forest was as silent as the grave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they stepped under the thick branches, Hermione and Daphne slipped to the front of the group to lead them while Harry and Neville swung to the outside edges of the group to constantly search for anything that might attack them. Unlike Muggles, magicals knew things were just as likely to drop down out of the sky on them as jump out of the bushes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The trip was a tesne one, but they reached the site where the ritual was to be performed. It was a rather strange grouping of stones starting with a large, moss covered circle that came up to their waist, reminding Harry of an ornamental pond or huge well that had been forgotten. Three large stones were equidistant around the circle with four trees growing up along the back of it as if providing a background for whatever was suppose to be in the circle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>We should clean it up,” Parvati announced as they spread out to examine the stones.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Besides, we would have a better chance at attracting positive attention if we show we are willing to take care of things,” Padma added, stepping forward to begin peeling moss off the stones.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Three of us keep watch while the rest clean,” Harry suggested, deciding on the best compromise. Besides, all of them had old injuries of some sort that made long term labor difficult for various reasons. “We’ll rotate out so no one is stuck only cleaning or only watching.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Daphne, Neville, and Susan spread out to keep watch on the dark forest around them as the rest did what they could to clean the stones. Cloaks were sacrificed to become scrubbing rags while careful use of magic summoned some clean water. There were still various things that were attracted to magic, and any use had the chance of drawing them to the Twelve.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was slow going due to the amount of dirt and moss on the stones, but before moonrise, the stones seemed to glow in the faint light with the strange swirls carved in them visible for all to see. The Twelve themselves were grimy and more thana it dirty, and they washed their hands as best as they could in the last of the water. Harry’s back where he had taken a cutting curse that had never healed properly ached, but he figured it was a good ache. It felt really good to be able to clean and repair instead of just fix good enough to survive, and he grinned at the others who had the same satisfied look on their faces that he was sure was on his.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>It’s time,” murmured Luna, her silver eyes turning towards the rolling clouds that were visible between the trees. Where the rest of the forest had a thick canopy of branches and leaves hiding the ground even in the dead of winter, this area somehow seemed to retard the growth of the canopy, causing a gap that Harry somehow knew would let the moon down onto the stones, like this place had been created specifically for this ritual.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shaking his head at his own flight of fancy, Harry moved around the circle with the others until he felt like he was in the right spot. There was a bit more shuffling before Daphne and Luna began speaking in a strange yet beautiful language that was almost a song. A few moments of listening and Harry realized they were repeating the same few lines over again. With a nod and much more confidence than he felt, Harry raised his arms and joined in the almost prayer like chant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their voices filled the air, hopeful and desperate, and a shiver slid down Harry’s spine at the feel of the magic growing thick and heavy in the air as the others added their own voices. Minutes slipped past as the words grew more familiar to him, slipping more easily from his dry lips, and he could </span>
  <em>
    <span>almost</span>
  </em>
  <span> decipher what they were actually saying. It seemed to be a plea to a goddess named Elune for sanctuary, and as if it had only been waiting for him to make that realization, a sense of peace and comfort fell over him for the first time in a </span>
  <em>
    <span>very</span>
  </em>
  <span> long time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, a deathly cold wrapped around him as his words emerged on a plume of white. He stiffened as he faintly heard his mother’s voice, and he desperately looked around to see the others were starting to droop under the effects of the Dementors. Everyone was still bravely chanting, desperation bleeding into their words, but he knew something had to be done or they would be a feast for the dark creatures who had apparently been drawn there by their ritual.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He drew his wand as he realized he was going to have to time his next actions very carefully so as to not disrupt the prayer. He closed his eyes as he braced himself, hoping that he wouldn’t be screwing up this long awaited ritual by saving their lives. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Please, Goddess Elune, don’t ignore us now</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he silently prayed as he prepared to jump out of the chant at the end of the next repetition. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Do not punish all of us for the actions of the one. Save them and leave me if you must.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <b>
    <em>EXPECTO PATRONUM!”</em>
  </b>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was nearly thrown from his feet as Prongs exploded out of his wand like a cannonball, shooting towards the dark shadows that were slowly gliding down from the sky, but as Harry watched the silver animal, he realized a few things. The first and most important was that wasn’t a stag. No, this was an elk the size of an elephant with antlers easily as large as half its body. The second was that it - </span>
  <em>
    <span>no, he,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Harry mentally corrected himself - wasn’t silver but white with purple markings that looked painted on his fur. On his front legs were strange feathers and metal decorations tied on with strips of leather.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The third and final fact that made Harry realize this wasn’t Prongs was that he had absolutely no control over the huge elk as it tore through the Dementors. He wasn’t even feeling a drain on his magic as if he had simply summoned the elk before setting it upon the dark creatures that hoped to feast on his family. Shaking his head, Harry took a chance and jumped back into the chant, bolstered by the sight of the strange protector destroying the dementors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the final Demetor was nothing more than shreds of black fabric blowing away in the wind, the elk descended from the sky to stand in the center of their circle, forcing them all to step back or risk being trampled by the very solid hooves. Now that the elk wasn’t racing around anymore, Harry could see a great many details about him. Such as the swirls and whirls that appeared carved into those great antlers which closely resembled the markings carved into the stones he now stood inside, and the twin medallions, each bearing a crescent moon in a glowing blue light, that hung from those deadly antlers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, the huge elk threw back his head and let loose a loud bugle that shook the trees around them and scaring off many creatures in the vicinity if the rustling of the underbrush was any indication. The clouds suddenly parted, as if waiting for just that signal, and the full moon spilled down onto the stone circle, causing the various carvings in the stones to start glowing a pale silvery blue. Small glowing motes of the same color rose out of the center of the ring and began to dance around like fireflies, and Harry resisted the urge to sink to his knees and bathe in the tranquility that filled the area.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Rest, young warriors,” urged a gentle female voice, and he watched as the motes seemed to coalesce into a female form before explode outwards to reveal the owner of the voice. She was at least ten feet tall with long pointed ears and hair the color of moonbeams that fell down her back in waves and curls. Her eyes were solid silver, but Harry knew she wasn’t blind in the least as her gaze flitted over them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Rest, for I am here and none will bother you this night,” she stated, sitting on the edge of the stone circle with her white dress flowing around her. The elk shrank in size until he was only a bit smaller than her before settling next to her in a loving way. She smiled and kissed his muzzle like one would a lover instead of a pet. “Than you, Malorne, for protecting these young warriors until I arrived.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Four of them are suited to walk with me, my love,” rumbled the elk, Malorne, in a deep voice, and Harry’s heart pounded in his chest as he stared at the strange couple. He half collapsed on the ground as the others moved to sit with him before the strange couple, and Malorne chuckled as he eyed them. Harry felt like a Firstie all over again, waiting to be sorted into his house. “One is most definitely your handmaiden. Two surprisingly hear the call of the elements. Two seemed to be claimed by darker forces, and the remaining three merely wish to learn all they can about the arcane that flows through them. Quite a mix that asked for your help, Elune.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Yes, but help them I shall,” the goddess stated, looking them over. Susan and Hannah burst into tears, clinging to each other as they cried in relief and joy while Lavender, Padma, and Parvati were in a three way hug. A strange feeling filled Harry, making him feel as if he would burst from it, and it took a few moments to realize it was hope.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Thank you, my lady,” croaked Neville, his voice hoarse from the chanting. Harry briefly glanced around to find everyone had tears running down their faces, and from the faint chill against his own cheeks, he knew he was no exception.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elune smiled and leaned over to touch the ground inside the ring. There was a visible ripple in the air, and shimmering blue water filled the now clean pool as a pale blue light seemed to radiate out from it. Even the four nearby trees were changed into a rose purple color with the two center ones supporting a large crescent moon while the ones to each side were topped by smaller crescents. Despite the glowing nature of it, the water was crystal clear and so much cleaner than anything Harry had seen in a small eternity, and his throat ached to feel it slide over parched tissue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>To help you, there is a small sacrifice each of you must be prepared to make,” Elune announced, her voice soft but her eyes slid over each of them again, holding Harry in place as he listened to her. “I ask for your humanity in exchange for myhelp.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>What?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> yelped Hermione, and Harry just managed to bite back his own knee jerk response. Eline was willing to help them at the cost of their humanity? What sort of help was that? ANd should they honestly take her up on her offer? Disappointment formed a lump in his throat, threatening to choke him. He had been so hoping that this was the answer to their shattered dreams and lives, but it seemed the price might be too high.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blaise suddenly barked out a hoarse laugh, and Harry turned to stare at him. Had the situation finally caused Blaise to lose his mind?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>If we will not be human, what race shall we be, lovely Elune?” inquired the dark Slytherin with a charming smile as he leaned forward to rest his arms on his crossed legs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>What are you talking about, Blaise?” huffed Draco even as Harry stared at Blaise in confused worry. He had a feeling he wasn’t the only one, but Elune and Malorne were simply sitting and watching them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blaise gestured towards Elune who had a foot dangling in the clear water. “Does she honestly look like a goddess for </span>
  <em>
    <span>humans</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” he asked, shaking his head as if answering his own question. “No human, magical or Muggle, could have come up with anyone who looks even remotely close to her. Especially for a Moon Goddess.” He shook his head again. “No, her worshipers are a race that is not human, and for her to be able to fully help us, we must </span>
  <em>
    <span>become</span>
  </em>
  <span> her people.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All the breath left Harry in a rush, making him feel as if he had been punched in the gut by the sudden realization. It made a strange sort of sense, and he had a small feeling that Elune had worded her request in such a way to see who would think and who was ruled by instinct. He collapsed against Draco, resisting the urge to give into hysterical laughter at the full realization of what Elune was asking of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Such a cunning young one,” remarked Elune, a small, wistful smile on her face. “Would you not reject the Void to become one of my priests?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Sweet Elune, I fear the dark is in my bones, requiring me to study and understand it if only to counter such things when they are used as weapons,” sighed Blaise, resting a hand over his heart. “To fight a fire, one must understand its nature and weaknesses before it can be defeated.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Very eloquently put, little one,” Malorne remarked, nodding at Blaise before looking at Elune. “They may be of some use in that one place along with your estranged son.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The goddess nodded before focusing on the group, and Harry sat up as a seriousness had surrounded them, pushing aside the slightly relaxed atmosphere. “There is a world similar to this one that is on the brink of being overrun by an ancient enemy called the Burning Legion,” she began, and a shiver of dread ran down Harry’s spine at the name. “They are a vast army of demons who exist to subjugate and destroy all sentient life. I wish your help in stopping them as you will be most familiar with the laws and customs of your kind.” She held up a hand, stopping any arguments that might have sprung up from them. “This is not a demand that you must fulfill before I help you but a request for help. Should you agree, you will receive assistance in confronting the Legion.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked around at the others to find them staring at him, apparently waiting for a decision, and he sighed. “May we have a few minutes to discuss your request, Lady Elune?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She inclined her head, and they shuffled around until they were in a rough circle. Harry rested his hands on his knees as he looked at his made family. “Thoughts?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>We should help,” Neville stated, picking up a stick and starting to dig in the dirt. “If only to keep what happened to this world from happening to another.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>I don’t think I could live with myself, knowing someone needed help against a more powerful enemy and I did nothing,” Susan said, shaking her head. “Aunt Amelia would rise out of her grave and slap me silly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Padma and Parvati exchanged glances before nodding once. “We vote to help,” Parvati stated. “If only to repay Elune for her help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Plus she promised help with this Legion,” Padma added with a pointed finger. “How often did we wish for help that never appeared?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>It would cancel any debt between us,” agreed Daphne with her own nod. “And a Slytherin dislikes being in debt to anyone even if they are a goddess.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione snorted and </span>
  <em>
    <span>looked </span>
  </em>
  <span>at Harry. “As if you would be able to resist helping,” she drawled, and Harry gave his female lover a sheepish smile. “Remember, I know you, Harry Potter. To save others, you’ll be on the front lines, and I would be right next to you to keep you alive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>She has you there, Scarhead,” teased Draco before he doubled over, coughing hard. Harry quickly shifted over to rub his other lover’s back just as Hannah flicked her wand at Draco. She frowned as the results of whatever the spell was spun out into the air between her and Draco.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Severely dehydrated with the beginnings of bronchitis,” she announced, and Harry breathed a sigh of relief that it wasn’t something more serious, such as one of the diseases that had appeared or mutated during the war.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Why are you dehydrated, young one?” asked Malorne before looking around. “There is plenty of water around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>None of it is fit to consume, Lord Malorne,” Hermione said with a shrug. “Even the rain that falls from the sky is too badly contaminated from the war between magicals and muggles.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry closed his eyes and bowed his head in shame. Even though he had nothing to do with how the war turned out, he still felt responsible for some reason. He flinched as a hand smacked his arm, and he opened his eyes to find Hannah glaring at him with a familiar stubborn expression on her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Not your fault, Potter,” she growled, pointing a finger at him, and he flinched again. “We were let down by the adults who should have been protecting us since we were only fourteen and fifteen when everything started.” She huffed and folded her arms across her chest before looking around at everyone. “Are we all in agreement to help the Goddess Elune with this as a thanks for helping us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ten voices rose in a resounding “Aye”, and Hannah simply looked at Harry with an expected brow raised. He sighed and added his “Aye” to the vote, knowing it was useless to argue with any of the ladies when they had that particular expression on their face. Hannah nodded once before shifting to snuggle against Susan as her girlfriend wrapped an arm around her shoulders, and a pleasant laugh filled the air, lifting Harry’s spirits. He looked to Elune to find her regarding them with a very matronly smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>I thank you for your help,” she announced before gesturing towards the glowing water. “Come bathe in my well and drink your fill. Become my children truly instead of just in name.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A sudden giddiness swept through Harry, leaving him light headed, and he laughed with joy for the first time in years as he scrambled towards the water. Laughter from the others joined his, and he barely paused long enough to strip off his clothes before he plunged into the water. Holding his breath, he stayed under the surface for as long as he could, the soft, warm water caressing his skin like the finest of silk, but he finally had to surface, wiping the water out of his eyes and brushing his hair back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Automatically, he looked around to check on the others to find they were also soaking in the clean water. He reached down to grab a handful of sand off the bottom of the well and began rubbing it over his skin, doing his best to wash away the dirt that had grown there over the years. Instead of the expected cloud of filth to rise off of his skin, the dirt just seemed to vanish as if it had never stained his skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>FInally, he was unable to resist the temptation any longer, and he scooped up water in his hands, bringing it to his mouth. Cool, clear, and refreshing, the water slipped over his tongue and down his throat, soothing the familiar ache that he had long since gotten use to. A moan of delight and relief escaped him, and he simply put his mouth in the water, drinking greedily. He didn’t care how he looked. He was going to indulge in a nice bout of gluttony until he couldn’t drink any more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a snort from Malorne before the sound of a hoof stroking stone, and Harry felt something ripple through the air. Straightening up, he looked to find a tree rapidly growing next to the well. Within seconds, round, ripe fruit hung from the branches before Malorne struck the tree with a back hoof. Yelps of surprise filled the air as the heavy fruit fell into the water, nearly filling the surface as they bobbed there, waiting to be gathered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Eat, children,” Malorne urged, sounding much like a father trying to get his children to partake of a dinner that had just been placed on the table. “As Elune’s waters shall heal your spirits, my fruit shall nourish your bodies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Picking up one of the fuzzy fruits, Harry turned it over in his hands before he figured out it was simply a type of peach that was a bit more pink than what he was use to seeing. The first bite was sweet and juicy and awoke a ravenous hunger within him. He ate several in quick succession, placing the pits aside to be planted later, and yet despite the large quantity that was being consumed by the hungry group, there always seemed to be just a few more peaches in the water. Neville emerged from the water long enough to dig a bag out of his abandoned clothes, and he scooped all of the peach pits into it, moving around to those who had finished their peaches to collect from them. Harry thought he saw a flicker of approval on Malorne’s face before a yawn caught the green eyed young man by surprise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Sleep, young ones, and when you wake, you shall be in your new home,” urged Elune, and Harry nodded, climbing out of the water to curl up on the warm stones that made up the pool. The air was surprisingly warm for being in the tail end of December, but all thoughts of the strange weather was washed away as Harry fell asleep before he was fully settled.</span>
