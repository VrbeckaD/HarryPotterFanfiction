    <p><b><em>        THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS LOYALTY. </em></b>You're only loyal to someone until it's not convenient anymore and Avalon was living proof of that.</p><p>    She'd hid his sword the night before when she had made up her mind on what she was about to do, after she'd tried to convince him of backing down, of doing things differently – of not killing innocents after they weren't able to provide the information he was looking for. Contrary to what one might think, she didn't hide his sword out of fear that he would defeat her in a fight, rather because she knew she'd give in if it came to that, she knew she would rather yield than fight <em>him</em>.</p><p>    So, in that morning, when he came through the door, she turned around, emerging from her hiding spot behind the door, and drove her knife into the flesh below his rib cage.</p><p>    And now she stood in front of the palace, her hand gripped onto the collar of Theodore's shirt, dragging him along, as her other hand clutched her heart for, in a way, he would take it with him.</p><p>    'Avalon, wait... don't...' he choked out, his hands tied behind his back.</p><p>    Her lips remained shut, her jaw set. She stared at the path in front of her, refusing to look down at him, refusing to back down now. She'd had two moments to rethink the whole ordeal: when she decided to at the very least wrap a bandage around his torso to stop him from bleeding out to death and when she willed the world around her to bend and the ground she stood to connect with the palace grounds, and at that moment, when she stepped into the shadows ahead of her, dragging Theodore along with only one of her wolves, Moon, trailing behind her before she could say no, she wondered if there was any other way for them to settle this, to make him stop. <em>No, </em>she'd decided, <em>the other way would be worse.</em></p><p>    She felt Moon's teeth clamp around the leather of her boot as the wold tried to pull her back, low whines emitting from its mouth and reverberating through Avalon's bones and she almost found herself giving in. She was aware her wolves were fond of him, mostly because she had been too, and it came in handy when they were all forced to sleep in the same tiny wooden cabin, but now, with Moon trying to stop her from turning him in, it was nothing but an inconvenience.</p><p>    'Stay back, Moon,' she ordered.</p><p>    The wolf did not stop, its teeth only got tighter around Avalon's boot and she was forced to come to a halt.</p><p>    'I said <em>stay back!</em>' She roared and watched as the wolf stepped back, ears and head low, tail between her legs as it looked at Avalon in pure and utter betrayal.</p><p>    And there it was, another swing of a hammer colliding with her, another crack in her heart and it left her wondering how many swings it would take for her to crumble.</p><p>    But she went on, dragging Nott along the path. 'Avalon, <em>please</em>,' he pleaded.</p><p>    'I can stop, I...' he went on, his body too weak to free himself from her grip. '<em>Lily...</em>'</p><p>    'Stop?' She snapped, her teeth gritted, 'I tried to stop you, I told you this would be the end if you kept going and did you listen? No. You brought this upon yourself.'</p><p>    Before he could answer, a crowd of guards came rushing towards the two of them, weapons raised. And she knows how bad it sounds, but everything happened so fast, one moment she was looking down at Theo and in the next, the guards were pulling him away from her, dragging him to a life behind bars like she just had. And as the guards pulled him to one side, they pulled her away to the other – for <em>what</em>, she didn't know yet, but she could not tear her eyes from him, even as they were forced apart.</p><p>    And there it was again, the last swing of that hammer and she was nothing but regret.</p>
