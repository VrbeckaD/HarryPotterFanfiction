          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts in one of the many secret rooms in Hogwarts. Peter Pettigrew has been asked to come here by his ex boyfriend Peeves the poltergeist.</p><p>Peter asked, "Have you forgiven me yet?"</p><p>Peeves scowled. "No and I never shall. You lied to me!"</p><p>Peter sighed. "Then why did you ask me to come here today?"</p><p>Peeves muttered, "Heard rumours about Black in his animagus form, thought you might like to know."</p><p>Peter gasped. "You did?"</p><p>Peeves nodded and told him, "That Harry Potter your Ron is friends with has been saying him, well he thinks is the Grimm..."</p><p>Peter smiled slightly. "You went through the trouble to tell me this even though we're not together any more. I guess you still care about me more than you'd like to admit."</p><p>Peeves turned his head away and responded, "Perhaps, but we can't keep pretending that lie was alright."</p><p>Without another word, he zoomed away.</p></div>
