    <p>“Just admit it, Potter, you’re lost! We’re lost! Lost in muggle London!!!” Draco hissed and jabbed a finger into Harry’s chest repeatedly.</p>
<p>Harry slapped the offending hand away. “We’re not lost, okay! I know where we are. Generally, at least…”</p>
<p>“Oh, so you know which borough we’re in, is that it?!? That’s <i>sooo</i> reassuring. It’s not like this city is large or anything!” Draco’s cried, his voice escalating quickly, making a couple of by-passers eyeing them with curiosity. </p>
<p>“Oh for the love of- just put a sock in it for a few seconds and let me think!” Harry snapped back.</p>
<p>“I will NOT! I knew this would happened but you were so sure of yourself and your sense of directions but I should’ve kno-”</p>
<p>“It’s this way.” Harry cut off Draco’s rant and pointed to his right. “And next time I get the bright idea of taking you out on a nice date, I’ll only need to remember what an insufferable git you are right now to make me think twice about it!”</p>
<p>Draco stared at him wide-eyed, lips slightly parted in surprise at the outburst. A few moments passed before he dropped his gaze and his shoulders slumped a bit. “I’m… I’ll behave. I like spending time with you, you know that. It’s just that… muggle areas… they’re too unfamiliar and I…”</p>
<p>Harry took pity on him. He had taken Draco out to a few muggle locations before - to a cinema, a supermarket, a park. But all trips had been short and to places that Harry had already been plenty of times. Draco had been cautious even then, and now that he was faced with an area that he thought Harry had no idea about, his uneasiness had intensified considerably. Harry sighed and took Draco’s hand in his own.</p>
<p>“Look, we’re not lost. And even if we were, I could easily ask someone for directions. And if we’re really, truly, super lost, we could just go to a deserted alley and apparate, ok?”</p>
<p>Draco nodded slowly at the reassurance before furrowing his brows. “Don’t patronize me, Potter! Now let’s go!”</p>
