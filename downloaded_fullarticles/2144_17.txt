<br/>
Hermione looked up from her desk. “What are you talking about?”<br/>
<br/>
Harry sat in the chair opposite her. “Dating. This pretend relationship we’re doing.” <br/>
<br/>
“Oh.” Hermione sat back in her seat. Maybe it was for the best. It was only temporary, to stave off some unwelcome suitors they were both experiencing. She twisted her necklace around a finger. Harry had given it to her for her last birthday. She was reluctant to admit she was wishing this fake relationship was real. <br/>
<br/>
“Hermione, will you go on a date with me? A real one?”</p></div>
