[7:32] <span class="s1">I think he stepped on your foot a few times when he was trying to dance?</span><br/>

<span class="s1">[8:07] Sorry that uncalled for. <br/>
</span> [8:08] <span class="s1">Wait, I don't know you. I don't think it matters much, actually. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">[8:09]</span> <em><span class="s1"> Really? I thought our no-cussing bond was incredibly strong. </span> </em></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">[8:10] What? A no-cussing bond? <br/>
</span> [8:10] <span class="s1">I thought we were just two 80 year olds with a strong moral guide!</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">[8:12]</span> <em><span class="s1">Ah, I see, Cho was a mysterious, wheeled lady at Senior Day.</span> </em></p><p class="p1">

[8:27] </span> <span class="s1"><em>Maybe.</em> </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">[8:28] So ambiguous.</span><br/>
[8:29] <span class="s1">And I've never said "oi you ready for the big game mate" once in my life, thank you very much. <br/>
[8:29] </span><span class="s1">I'm cool. Smooth. </span></p><p class="p1">

  <span class="s1">[1:17] I had a hangover alright? My sleeping habits aren't usually this fucked. </span>

</span> <span class="s1">[1:18] <em>No offense, Harry, but why are you still texting me?</em></span></p><p class="p2">

  <span class="s1">[1:28]<em> Stepping-on-Cho's-Feet ginger Ron?</em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[1:31] Yes, well, I live with him. It's a long story, yada yada, but he has a rather large family and they're currently in a rather large row I'm not intent on joining. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[1:32] <em>What about?</em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[1:34] I think his younger sister snuck out last night. I'm not totally sure, I put my earbuds in a while ago. It sounds like something she would do, though. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[1:35] <em>How'd it become a family row?</em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[1:38] A few brothers are backing her, the others are backing her mum. I think Ron's against her, though. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[1:42] <em>Overprotective brother complex?</em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[1:43] Seems so. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[1:45] <em>I've got a new appreciation for being an only child.  </em><br/>
</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[1:47] I would say the same, but this family's basically mine now, in every way but blood. I'm making them seem terrible, but I'll blame it on the hangover. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[1:48] <em>How big is this family?</em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[1:50] Oh, you know, mum, dad, 1 girl, and 6 boys. 7 counting me. </span>
</p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">[1:53]<em> What the absolute fuck.</em> <br/>
</span> <span class="s1">[1:53] <em>How loud is it over there?</em></span></p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[1:55] Well the oldest three are in college or graduated. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[1:56] <em>There's five kids in your household?</em></span>

  <span class="s1">[1:56] Yes. </span>

</span> <span class="s1">[1:59] <em>Sounds...fun?</em></span></p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[2:01] It actually is usually, but not so much with a migraine. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[2:04] <em>How is Ron up for a row, then? I assume he drank a decent amount, else I would say by the way you described his behavior last night that he was questionable company. </em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[2:06] Oh, yes, he was plastered. Drank more than me, in fact. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">[2:09] <em>So, you're a lightweight. </em></span>
</p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">[2:10] No! And Ron just managed to down near a gallon of water before bed. I'm always too exhausted.<br/>

</p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">[2:18] Oh. </span><br/>
<span class="s1">[2:19] Sorry, no, just using it as a phrase more of. Though now you mention it, I guess I did?</span><br/>
<span class="s1">[2:19] In an unconscious sort of way.<br/>
</span> <span class="s1">[2:20] I'm sorry I didn't mean to assume...</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">[2:22] </span><em>No, it's ok.</em><br/>
<span class="s1">[2:23] </span><em>Um, well yes I am.</em> <br/>

</p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">[2:32] Oh, yeah.</span><br/>
<span class="s1">[2:32] But it could be short for something. Harriet?<br/>
[2:34] </span><span class="s1">Harriot's decently common, and I think most of them shorten it to Harry.</span></p><p class="p2">[2:35] <em>Point taken, but </em><span class="s1"><em>Harold's more likely.</em> <br/>
