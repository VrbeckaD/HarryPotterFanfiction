    <p>The floor was shaking. A low, mechanical groan echoing. It smelled like sweat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Bodies were piled up on one another. It was hot and damp and uncomfortable. Someone underneath began to shift, making the rest of them grumble.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“It's time to get up.” Came a harsh voice, striking against the metal cage they were in until they were all awake and alert, looking around in confusion. Weakly, they began to push themselves up onto their feet. Some wobbled and knocked into each other, a few others merely clung to the cage bars for support.</p><p>“Get a move on, swine,” A cruel voice commanded, herding seventeen from the cage and onto an elevated walkway made of metal, the rigged edges pressing hard against their feet.</p><p>They were stripped once again, hosed down in freezing cold water, went through horribly intimate and humiliating body searches, and then, naked, they were filed into a large room, at least four stories tall and endlessly wide. In long, neat, unbroken rows were tables. Behind those tables were others like them. The Failures.</p><p>They were marched through the building, walking in a straight line between the tables, each one of them taking this humiliating walk differently. Some cried. Others kept their chins up. The rest were merely confused, thinking to themselves that this definitely wasn't Heaven or Hell. The Failures behind the tables briefly watched them pass, but they didn't gape for long. They had work to do, and when one of them delayed even a few seconds, a soldier walked up to her table and rapped his nightstick on her table, making her shriek and speed up.</p><p>“Evan Stevenson, suitable” A soldier remarked as he walked down the line of naked teenagers, her eyes not lingering on any of them, “Delilah Stone, suitable. Christian Mellark...” She paused, looking over the student once again, and with a slight hum, she scribbled down a note before saying, “Banged up, but suitable.” She continued down, “Christine Baker, suitable. Donna Farfield, suitable. Credence Barebone,” She stopped once again, looking at him twice, frowning impatiently. “Damaged.”</p><p>Everyone but Credence was lead forward. Credence was kept where he was, nude, cold, afraid, and surrounded by armed soldiers. He barely lifted his head, his arms crossed over his chest, waiting for something to happen. He wasn't left waiting for long when the sound of heavy boots on the metal floor began echoing through the room. He didn't turn around. Somehow, he already knew what was coming for him.</p><p>“We meet again,” His cold voice echoed in the halls, the workers at the tables behind them barely glancing up, “Credence Barebone. Ilvermorny's failure that almost got away. It's so... satisfying to see you here.” Hands grasped Credence by his waist, eliciting a gasp from the boy, and they slowly made his way up his ribs. When a hot breath fanned over Credence's neck, he merely squeezed his eyes shut. “It was supposed to be your little boyfriend down here, working away the rest of his life like a slave, four hours of sleep a day, two meager meals, no rest until he died... But this... this is even <em>better</em>.” A slow kiss on his skin, making Credence cringe away, and he whispered darkly, “Nobody is going to look for you. You are mine.”</p><p>Far below ground, Credence was lead in a different direction from the others. The soldiers still followed him, but Grindelwald was leading them forward. He walked with a purpose while Credence shuffled along, being forced forward by the officers when he fell too far behind. When the rows of tables and workers were left behind them, Credence finally felt the courage to ask, “Where am I?”</p><p>“Doesn't matter, does it?” Grindelwald replied casually, “To the rest of the world, you're dead. This might as well be your Hell.” He turned, then, smoothly walking backward, and he said with a smirk, “Or your Heaven, depending on how you play your cards.”</p><p>He faced forward again, picking up his pace a bit, and Credence grunted as he was forced to keep up. They went up a series of metal stairs, the jagged teeth digging into the bottom of his feet, and soon entered a dimly lit hallway with reinforced metal doors dotting along them. Grindelwald continued to walk, however, only pausing in front of the very last door at the end of the hallway. Shucking off his glove, Grindelwald pressed his thumb against a sensor beside the door. Credence watched with a frown as the scanner followed his thumbprint, illuminating it for only a moment, then beeped in recognition. The door began to open itself, sliding into the wall with a grating noise, and Grindelwald slowly pulled his glove back on.</p><p>As soon as the door was open, Grindelwald stepped inside, and the guards only pushed Credence in after him, though none of them followed. Credence staggered forward with a gasp, dropping to his knees with a wince, then flinched when the door slid back shut. From inside the room, Credence could see the locking mechanism within the door slide into place.</p><p>Knowing he was locked inside, Credence slowly took in his surroundings. He seemed to be in an apartment, the floor wood instead of metal, comfortable furniture in place, a kitchenette and a hallway across the way. He could see a sliver of a bedroom at the end of it, but that was all. Grindelwald had strutted across the room, making himself comfortable on the armchair facing Credence.</p><p>“Let's discuss something, Credence.” Grindelwald said, lifting his brows, “Please, come have a seat.” He gestured openly to the couch across from him. Credence glanced towards it hesitantly, but he got to his feet and slowly stepped towards the couch. He regarded the soft-looking fabric with a frown, wondered if it would really be okay to sit when he was still nude, but he did so anyway. Still, he remained stiff as stone and ready to spring to his feet at a moment's notice. Grindelwald watched him the entire time, a small smirk on his lips. “Comfortable?”</p><p>Credence ducked his head but hesitantly nodded. He didn't know where he was or why he was here instead of dead, but he figured if he was going to be stuck here, he might as well remain on Grindelwald's good side. “Th-thank you, sir.” Credence whispered in a rough voice. Grindelwald's smile widened.</p><p>“I understand you must be very confused,” Grindelwald began, leaning back comfortably in his armchair, “You're probably wondering why you aren't dead right now. Why none of you are. The simple answer is: It's not your business to know. You're alive, that's all that matters. You better be grateful for it.”</p><p>Crossing his legs, Grindelwald continued to say, “I bet you're also wondering why you weren't taken with the rest of those failures. Why you were deemed 'damaged.' And that's simply because I wanted you alone. All 'damaged' goods I see to personally for review. If they are redeemable, we help them recuperate. If not... well, we have to feed the mouths down here one way or another.”</p><p>Credence clenched his jaw tight, and Grindelwald grinned, feral.</p><p>“But you were marked 'damaged' for a different reason. Damaged goods are often placed in special positions down here. Janitorial crew, test subjects, freight, things that we wouldn't want to waste our more capable sacrifices on. And as a damaged good, I get to decide exactly what position will be best for you.”</p><p>Credence cringed, already trying to guess what Grindelwald wanted to do with him. Maybe he'd put him on the janitorial crew just because he could, just because Credence was no better than the scum he cleaned. He didn't utter a word about it, though. There was no way he was going to influence this man to change his decision.</p><p>“But I've decided to be kind,” Grindelwald stated, and Credence glanced up at him again, curious. The shit-eating grin on his face wasn't reassuring at all. “I'll give you a choice. You can either agree to be my personal assistant, which means you will be at my side at all times, obey my command, and be treated like a little doll in this horrible inescapable prison... or you can be a part of the... entertainment crew.”</p><p>Credence furrowed his brows, a silent question that Grindelwald was all too eager to answer. “My soldiers need a little downtime every once-in-a-while. What better way than to offer a piece of flesh for them to take their anger out on?”</p><p>Credence shuddered, suddenly feeling sick. So much for a choice, he thought. All this was was an attempt at giving Credence the illusion of freedom, the illusion of choosing his own fate. It really wasn't a question, it was a demand. A threat. And Credence was expected to choose the right one.</p><p>But Credence was stupid. He had to earn his free passes for a reason. And, like any other Failure down here, he hoped that there was another way. “C-Can't I work like the others? At the... tables?”</p><p>Grindelwald sighed, looking annoyed, and he simply said, “Such a position can only be filled by those who are not damaged.”</p><p>“But you said--”</p><p>“I gave you two choices, Credence. Don't make me decide for you.” Grindelwald growled, and Credence glanced up at him briefly before looking back down at his naked thighs. He thought about it quietly, trying to figure out what would be best; being the personal and willing partner to probably the worst man he's ever met, or suffer the abuse of more than a hundred adrenaline-driven soldiers prone to violence. Both ways, he would be unfaithful to his lovers... but he figured that doesn't matter anymore. Wherever he was, he was gone from them. To whoever remained, he was dead. And if he were no longer alive, then why should he make himself suffer for his lovers' benefit.</p><p>He had already whored himself out to a man to stay alive. Even if he thought it was love at one point... it would be no different from surviving down here. And maybe... maybe he could learn to love again.</p><p>Nervously, Credence peered up at Grindelwald, sitting across from him regally, legs crossed and back straight, eyes gazing down at him like he were a king and Credence merely a waif. He would have to learn what this man liked, what made him tick. He had to learn how to control him by giving him control. He would survive down here no matter what. He would survive and he will figure out how to escape, if it was even possible.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Credence whispered, “I-I can be your... your assistant, sir. If... If you'll let me, sir.”</p><p>Grindelwald looked like he might as well have won the lottery. Credence didn't understand why. Didn't he know Credence would prefer to be raped by one man instead of hundreds?</p><p>It wasn't rape, he thought to himself. He would enjoy it. He would be happy with it. He will learn to love him just like he had with Percival. He closed his eyes, feeling them burn. He would have to stop thinking about Percival first.</p><p>“You've made the right choice,” Grindelwald assured him, getting up from his seat, “Come. Let's get you dressed.”</p><p>Credence let out a breath, then got to his feet and followed after him, desperate to be clothed once again.</p><p>He followed Grindelwald across the room, down the narrow hall, and into his bedroom. The bed was large, could comfortably fit the two of them, and the décor was rich but tasteful. Grindelwald went to a double door to their right, opening it up to expose a walk-in closet. If all of these outfits were Grindelwald's, then Credence was certain he wouldn't fit in any of them.</p><p>But instead of rifling through his many suits and coats, he went straight to the back where a wooden trunk sat, pulling it open and reaching inside. Credence waited a few steps behind him. He didn't want to crowd Grindelwald, not when he wasn't used to his patterns yet. Plus, he wasn't even sure if Grindelwald would want Credence to cling to him like an infirm child. He kept his hands down, covering his indecency, and flinched when Grindelwald suddenly turned around. He was holding out a few folded pieces of clothing, urging Credence with a calm, “Get dressed. Quickly.”</p><p>“Y-yes, sir. Thank you, sir,” Credence rattled off, taking the clothes from the man and immediately unraveling them. The soft, black flannel pants were loose on his legs, but the drawstrings tightened the waistline to his hips so they wouldn't fall. They were smooth and breezy like sleep pants, easy to remove, Credence figured. The long-sleeved shirt was also black, but much thinner. When Credence slipped it on, he realized with a shock that the material was nearly see-through, translucent enough to show off the shape of his body, even under the baggy material. Luckily, the details of his body were still hidden, but Credence figured that a shirt like this would do nothing to deflect Grindelwald's touch.</p><p>When Credence turned around, he saw Grindelwald was watching him. His breath caught in his throat and he quickly ducked his head, standing rigidly. He didn't move until Grindelwald was pushing something against his chest. Reaching up, Credence slowly took the black leather boots and ankle-high socks from him, blinking in surprise. He glanced up at Grindelwald to be sure, but the man didn't offer him any reassurance. Even slower, Credence lowered himself to the floor, then slowly pulled on the socks and shoes. He was surprised to find that the boots fit, and once they were tied, he got back up.</p><p>“And finally,” Grindelwald said calmly, pulling out armor akin to that of the soldiers and the campus officers. There thick shoulder pads, a bullet-proof vest, and Kevlar gloves. He pulled the gloves on first, then the vest, then the shoulder pads, and immediately felt bulky and ridiculous. He was immensely skinny, not at all physically thick with muscle like the other soldiers. Grindelwald seemed to think the same thing because a moment later, he was humming in distaste.</p><p>“This will work for now.” He decided with a sigh, closing the trunk behind him, “I'd want you to be dressed differently from the rest of my men, anyways. Just so I can pick you out easier.”</p><p>Credence didn't understand, not really. If he was supposed to be Grindelwald's assistant, why would he be wearing armor? It would just make it easier for Credence to fight him off. He glanced at Grindelwald as the man stepped around him, deciding to just keep quiet about it. His opinion didn't matter, and even if it did, he didn't want to point out any flaws to Grindelwald. Anything that would keep him a layer of clothing away, the better.</p><p>“Come along, Credence. There is much for you to learn.” Grindelwald declared, and Credence hurried after him, making sure he remained a few steps behind.</p><p>They exited Grindelwald's apartment, the door locking behind them and the DNA scanner glowing red. Credence frowned the slightest bit at the sight, but turned his head forward and resumed walking. As they walked down the hall, Grindelwald began to speak, “As my assistant, I will expect many things from you. If you do not perform to my expectations, you will be punished. I expect you to carry out my every command, my wishes, my desires. Everything you do or say will be an extension of me. That being said...”</p><p>Grindelwald paused at the very top of the staircase leading down to the work halls, and looked directly at Credence, “If you ever embarrass me, intentionally or not, I will make sure you regret it. Do you understand?”</p><p>Credence nodded stiffly, but when Grindelwald didn't seem pleased, he said in a hoarse voice, “Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Good.” Grindelwald murmured, turning back around, “Come.”</p><p>They continued down the steps quickly, Grindelwald walking down them with grace while Credence clung to the rail, horribly off-balance. They made it to the bottom with no injuries, however, and Grindelwald began to walk down the line of workers. Credence looked over them in interest, his brow furrowing when he realized they were putting together different electronic parts. The further they walked, the more intricate the pieces became, until Credence came upon the workers that were putting the pieces together.</p><p>At the very end of the room, a row of younger Failures were putting the finished tablets into styrofoam boxes, sealing them up with the company logo for Assuru Global.</p><p>That was the very same company that manufactured the tablets used specifically for the 10-241.</p><p>Credence gasped when Grindelwald called for him to hurry up, and he quickly pushed the thought out of his mind. Picking up the pace, they left the work hall and entered a different room, sanctioned off by a large metal door. This one was opened by a key card similar to those the school faculty used.</p><p>They stepped inside just as the doors slid open, Credence right behind, but the boy staggered to a stop when he saw what was happening.</p><p>This room must have been for onboarding new Failures, for the remaining sixteen students chosen for the Thinning from Credence's school were standing in a line, dressed in thick, shapeless white smocks like the rest of the workers, and being branded with the Assuru logo, an open hand with a lower case 'a' in the center. The brand was pressed into their wrist, and each one of them cried out in pain as it was applied. Grindelwald walked forward, supervising their progress. Credence could only stumble towards him, his eyes glued to the students he only vaguely remembered. As he went, a few of the students glanced up, their eyes wet and faces twisted in pain, until one of them recognized him.</p><p>“Hey... Hey!” The boy shouted, Evan, if he recalled correctly. Evan launched forward, grabbing Credence by the straps of his bullet-proof vest tightly, and yelling, “What the fuck is this?! He was damaged! How was he made into a soldier if he was damaged?!”</p><p>Credence didn't respond, his eyes wide and his body stiff. Grindelwald took a step closer, his eyes narrowing, but he didn't immediately do anything. Instead, he made a gesture to one of the nearby soldiers, who nodded briefly and slowly pulled out a taser.</p><p>“This is bullshit!” Evan shouted, pushing Credence roughly, shaking the boy down until Credence was whimpering.</p><p>“S-sir!” He yelped, looking to Grindelwald for help. He saw the man smirk, saw his eyes glint in sadistic pleasure, and then Evan went absolutely rigid. A sick, gurgling noise came from his mouth, his body seizing. Credence watched in horror as Evan's eyes went wide right in front of him, then rolled back into his head. He watched as the soldier filled Evan's body with fifty thousand volts for what felt like minutes, but was only about five seconds. When the soldier pulled back, Evan collapsed to the ground, his fingers slipping from Credence's vest.</p><p>“Hm.” Grindelwald was behind Credence, looking over his shoulder at the Failure, before he looked up to the soldier who had tased him, “Lobotomize him.”</p><p>“Wh—what?” Credence gasped, looking back at Grindelwald, then spinning around as the soldier tossed Evan over his shoulder and carried him away, “No! Wait!”</p><p>He was about to launch himself forward, try to stop the soldier carrying Evan, but a hand on his shoulder stopped him before he could even lurch. He turned back to Grindelwald, terrified of his man, and before Grindelwald could say anything, Credence stated, “Lobotomy has been prohibited, sir. Th-there is no good reason to perform such a procedure. It—It would render him useless to you.”</p><p>Grindelwald lifted a brow, held up a hand, and the soldier holding Evan paused. “Explain,” He bid Credence, staring down at the boy. Credence licked his lips anxiously, lowered his head, and felt himself grow nervous.</p><p>“I—I don't....” He stopped. He couldn't be like this if he wanted to save Evan from a life-changing surgery. He had to be certain of himself, of his knowledge, even though, deep down, he knew he was a stupid young man. Sucking in a long breath, Credence closed his eyes and tried to focus on what he remembered about it.</p><p>Looking up at Grindelwald again, Credence recited, “A lobotomy will sever the connection to the prefrontal cortex--”</p><p>“I know how it works,” Grindelwald sneered, but Credence only pressed on, raising his voice a bit.</p><p>“--which is responsible for coordination, impulse control, focus, and prioritizing tasks.” Credence finished, but Grindelwald still seemed unimpressed.</p><p>“It will also affect his boorish personality. We can't have some self-righteous boy raising hell in the factory.” Grindelwald huffed, lifting a hand and about to wave the soldier away, but Credence's own hand shot out and grabbed him by the wrist.</p><p>“F-from what I've seen, you need your workers to be able to focus and prioritize. You need them to have coordination, attention to detail. Even if you put him on the packing line, production will suffer.” Credence stated, and Grindelwald gave him a wild look.</p><p>“If you think you're so smart, then what would <em>you</em> do with this swine?”</p><p>Credence hesitated, his brows furrowing, and he looked away as he thought about it. Grindelwald waited for only a few moments before he tore his hand away from Credence's and gestured for the soldier to continue forward. Credence looked back at them, at Evan hanging unconscious over the soldier's shoulder, and he felt his heart pound. He couldn't save him. He couldn't stop the procedure. Evan would be changed, set up to fail, and then killed just because he lashed out once.</p><p>Just because he wanted to be a soldier.</p><p>Sucking in a sharp breath, Credence turned back to Grindelwald and said, “Make him a soldier.”</p><p>“Excuse me?” Grindelwald sneered, and although he didn't signal for it, the soldier carrying Evan paused and turned back around.</p><p>“He wants to be a soldier. He has the temperament of a soldier. He can fight like a soldier. Make him a soldier.” Credence said again, keeping his eyes on Grindelwald's chin.</p><p>The man shifted. He looked shocked, as if he couldn't believe what Credence was asking of him, and slowly he asked, “Do you even know what it takes to be a soldier, boy?”</p><p>This time, Credence glanced up, meeting Grindelwald's mismatched eyes for a tense moment, and replied quietly, “I don't, because I don't have what it takes, and yet here I am.”</p><p>Grindelwald scowled at him, his face twisting in embarrassed rage, and in a cold voice, he muttered, “You are just asking for a world of pain, boy.”</p><p>“Then hurt me, and leave Evan alone.” Credence requested, lowering his gaze again, “Put him in the factory, make him do packing, make him a soldier, just <em>don't</em> lobotomize him. It isn't worth it.”</p><p>A long, pained sigh came from the older man. Grindelwald turned away from Credence, took a few thoughtful steps, then waved his hand in a dismissive gesture, “Fine. Fine. Leave the swine here.”</p><p>The soldier didn't even attempt to put Evan down gently. They merely let the boy drop onto the metal floor, the room echoing the heavy <em>thunk</em> his body made. “When he wakes, send him to waste management. A few months in the sewers should straighten him out.”</p><p>The soldier saluted, then went back to the remaining fifteen students. They had all been branded, all been dressed, and now they were being led out of the room, back towards the factory. Credence watched them go, his brows furrowing, and he wondered fleetingly if they would ever see the light of day again. If <em>he</em> would ever see the light of day again.</p><p>He came back to his surroundings when Grindelwald put his hands on his shoulders and said, “Credence. You're a doll.” He squeezed the boy's shoulders, and then his voice dropped darkly, “But that's all you are, boy. A doll. A toy. A pretty thing to look at and touch, to flaunt in front of others. You are not smart. We both know this. So don't pretend like you know anything. Do you understand me?”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Credence replied quietly, keeping his head down, focused on their shoes.</p><p>“Backtalk to me again in front of my men and I'll turn you into my own personal bitch. Do you hear me?” Grindelwald threatened, and Credence swallowed shakily before he nodded.</p><p>“Y-yes. Yes, sir.” He whispered, his voice barely even there, but it was enough for Grindelwald to hear. The man nodded once, then let go of Credence and cleared his throat.</p><p>“Let's move on,” He declared, walking in the opposite direction of the factory, pushing open double-doors to step into a new room. Credence had to rush to keep up.</p><p>It took two hours just for Grindelwald to show Credence the place, and Credence was horrified by how large this space was. He had never heard of a sweatshop for Assuru Global, had never even thought of it being a possibility. Such things—sweatshops—were barbaric, and thought to have been lost long ago in the past. And the place, spanning over 4.3 million square feet, was every horrible thing Credence could think of smashed together in one spot.</p><p>While the guards roomed in lavish bunks fitted with separate plumbing and a grand canteen, and the more important people such as Grindelwald resided in their very own apartments within the place, the Failures, or Swine as Grindelwald had taken to calling them, switched out in shifts of sixteen hours. They rotated throughout the factory, working their entire shift with only a twenty-minute pause for a meager meal, then would be allowed to rest for four hours afterward. The final hour was their recreational time, but it seemed like most simply used it for more sleep. They slept like they worked, squeezed together in a large hall, lined with thin mattresses and even thinner sheets. They piled together for warmth, the smell of sweat and despair lingering in the air. They had sixteen toilets. Each one of them was a hole dug into the ground, connected to a runoff where their waste would spill into the sewers.</p><p>And then Grindelwald brought him to the recreation area. Filling this room were men and women of various sizes, shapes, and ages, all nude, sitting in lavish couches and tempting Grindelwald and Credence with fluttering lashes and sultry gazes. Credence was baffled, not at all interested to investigate this room further until he realized that, running around this room in a similar state of undress, were <em>children</em>.</p><p>Even though he knew Grindelwald would be mad at him for it, Credence had to turn and leave this room as quickly as possible. He thought he was going to be sick. Did the men and women here really...?</p><p>Grindelwald followed him soon after, <em>amusement</em> on his damned face, and Credence never felt so much hatred for one man in his entire life. This place, these rooms, they were all chambers of torture and death. The soldiers were the devils and the demons, rattling the chains and spearing their horns into the Swine, the helpless victims who were only there because they hadn't been <em>smart enough</em>.</p><p>It would have been better if they had just died like they were supposed to.</p><p>“It's a bit much to take in, I understand,” Grindelwald tried to sound comforting, but Credence only gagged a second time, “You'll get used to this place in no time, boy. And I'm certain that soon enough, you'll be enjoying the recreational room from time to time.”</p><p><em>Never</em>, Credence wanted to say, to shout, but he merely pressed his lips into a line and squeezed his eyes shut, swallowing back the words and the bile until his throat burned. He would survive this. He had to survive this. He just had to stay on Grindelwald's good side...</p><p>If the man even had one.</p><p>“I—I wouldn't dare think of being with anyone but you, sir,” Credence whispered, knowing once upon a time that such words would be stirring Percival's blood and loins, would be the start of a fun afternoon, maybe something he'd whisper to the man early in the morning had they actually lived together. And now, he was using it to get Grindelwald's mind off of the horrors and onto him. Focus more on him, and he believed this place could be just a little bit better off.</p><p>He felt a hand slide into place on the back of his neck, and Credence went stiff. A hot breath soon followed, following the edge of his ear, and Grindelwald whispered heatedly, “If you ever betray me, you will merely be another addition to that salacious room.”</p><p>Letting go of his neck, Grindelwald moved on, going from sadistic monster to casual so fast it made Credence's head spin. As he walked, Credence forced himself to pull it together, then quickly followed after him.</p><p>On the surface, long after the sun had risen and the day had begun, Percival snorted himself awake. He jolted forward from where he sat in his armchair, feeling dried spit trailing from the corner of his mouth to his jaw. His head pounded and his vision swam. His stomach felt like it was doing flips inside of him, and he thought for a moment that he might actually vomit.</p><p>He rubbed a hand over his eyes, groaning. He drank too much last night. He knew why; there was no pretending that he didn't. He drank himself unconscious because of the Thinning. Graduation was <em>today</em>, and he felt like he wasn't ever going to be ready for it. He wasn't exactly required to be there, but Seraphina would definitely wonder where he had been.</p><p>His phone chimed somewhere to his left. He checked the table, the floor, and then realized it had fallen between the chair cushion, so he dug it out with a grunt. Checking his notifications, he groaned when he saw he had eighteen missed calls, thirty-six text messages, and five voicemails. He immediately cringed when he saw they were all from Theseus. He must have been talking to him last night.</p><p>He opened up the text messages first, scrolling all the way to the top to see where the conversation began, and immediately huffed in embarrassment.</p><p></p><blockquote>

</blockquote><p align="LEFT">The rest of the messages were just variants of Theseus yelling at him. He decided the next best idea would be to check his voicemail. The first one made him jolt with how loud Theseus was yelling. It was hardly even intelligible. Percival deleted it and moved on.</p><p align="LEFT">“I swear to God, Percival, if you ever lay your filthy fuckin' hands on my brother again I'll kill you!” Theseus shouted, and Percival figured he must have told Theseus about their not-so-professional relationship. Graves sighed and deleted that message as well, moving on.</p><p align="LEFT">This time, Theseus was whispering angrily, as if he didn't want Newt to hear, “You ever show your face around me again and I will tear your eyes out, bloody pervert. Don't ever speak to me again!”</p><p align="LEFT">Deleted. Moved on.</p><p align="LEFT">“And another thing!” Theseus spat, as if he had just hung up and redialed him, “Consider any debt I owe you for saving Newt from the Thinning null and void. Burn in Hell.”</p><p align="LEFT">Percival tilted his head back, putting his phone down for a minute. He wasn't even sure if he wanted to listen to the last message. He didn't want to know what else Theseus had to say about his and Newt's relationship. As far as he knew, he not only lost both of his lovers, but he lost one of his best friends as well. It was a terrible day. He didn't want to go to Graduation at all.</p><p align="LEFT">Scowling at his phone, Percival decided to move on to the last message. Whatever it was, he deserved it.</p><p align="LEFT">He took a deep breath, kept his eyes closed, and pressed the phone back to his ear as he started the message.</p><p align="LEFT">“Mr. Graves?” A small voice whispered, and Percival let out his breath in relief, his eyes popping open. He could already imagine sweet Newt sneaking into Theseus' bedroom late at night and stealing his phone away, just so he could call him. “I'm sorry about Theseus... He doesn't understand... And... And I'm sorry about C-Credence...” Newt sucked in a shaking breath, his voice cracking as he said, “I-It's all my f-fault... And I'm so sorry. Please... please, please forgive me.”</p><p align="LEFT">Another shaking breath, and Newt all but sobbed out, “I d-don't want to be alone r-right now... I w-wish I was with you instead... I wish Credence didn't...” Another sob, and Percival felt his heart breaking.</p><p align="LEFT">Finally, the message ended with Newt mumbling, “Please just... call me. Text me. I don't think I want to go to Graduation. I'll be... I'll be at home. B-bye.”</p><p align="LEFT">Graves bit his lip, peered back down at the number on his phone. It was Theseus'. And all the messages he had were from Theseus. Maybe Newt changed his mind.</p><p align="LEFT">Furrowing his brow and deciding to risk it, he dialed Theseus' number and held it to his ear as it rang. It went by once, twice, and nearly a third before it was picked up.</p><p align="LEFT">“H-hello?” Newt's nervous, melancholic voice asked through the speaker, and Percival breathed in relief.</p><p align="LEFT">“Newt,” He muttered, hearing the boy mirror his sigh on the other end, “Are you alone?”</p><p align="LEFT">“Yeah. Theseus left early to set up.” Newt answered, “He still doesn't know I have his phone.”</p><p align="LEFT">“Good. That's good...” Percival paused, trying to think of what he should do, what the right thing would be. He knew Newt needed comfort first, so he decided to tell him, “What happened to Credence isn't your fault.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt didn't reply to that, but his shaky breathing told Percival he was still on the other end of the phone. Percival closed his eyes, cursing himself in his head. All the things he could say, and he messes it up.</p><p align="LEFT">Finally, after what felt like forever, Newt said, “I don't want to be alone this summer.”</p><p align="LEFT">“I thought you lived with Theseus?” Percival asked, and Newt sighed.</p><p align="LEFT">“But I don't want to be alone with <em>him</em>. He doesn't understand. Doesn't know what it feels like.” Newt explained slowly, and Percival figured he understood. Getting through this grief was hell alone. It should at least be bearable with someone else with him.</p><p align="LEFT">Running his hand over his face, Percival agreed in a low voice, “I don't think I want to be alone either.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt sucked in a shaky breath, obviously building up his confidence to ask, but before he could even get the words out, Percival said to him, “Put your things together. Give me a few minutes to... clean myself up. I'll be there shortly.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt huffed in relief, happy that he didn't have to actually ask, and he whispered, “Okay. I'll be waiting.”</p><p align="LEFT">They hung up shortly afterward. Percival got himself up from the chair and went to take a shower, hoping to wash away last night's shame. He picked up his mess afterward, giving Newt ample time to get everything he needed, and then got in his car and headed for Theseus' apartment complex. The ride was long, taking about forty-five minutes for Percival to arrive at the place, but he didn't really mind the drive. Staying focused on the road with a plan to see Newt in mind kept the darker thoughts at bay.</p><p align="LEFT">As he climbed the stairs to the third floor, he wondered what Theseus might think to come home and find his little brother missing. He'd probably come straight to Percival's house and demand Newt return. Percival decided that he wouldn't try to dissuade or avoid him. This was his brother, after all. Even if he was upset with them, he would have to respect Newt's choices. And right now, Newt's choice was Percival.</p><p align="LEFT">He rapped on the door smartly, waited only a minute, and then the door was swinging open. There Newt stood, his eyes red-rimmed and puffy, his nose red and raw, and a simple backpack on his back. He stepped out of the house and closed the door behind him, peeking up at Percival nervously before saying, “Thank you... for letting me stay with you.”</p><p align="LEFT">Percival peeked at his bag, concerned with how little he was bringing, but he figured he could easily buy anything he forgot.</p><p align="LEFT">“It's my pleasure,” Percival told him, putting a hand on the back of his neck and getting Newt to look at him, “You sure you got everything you need?”</p><p align="LEFT">“Yes.” Newt replied, relaxing under Percival's hand and letting his eyes close for a moment, obviously tired, “I left Theseus a note.”</p><p align="LEFT">Percival chuckled a little, squeezing the back of his neck just for a moment, then pulled away, “I doubt that'll do much to sway him, but at least he won't worry.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt sighed, grimacing more than smiling, and he followed Percival down the stairway and towards his car.</p><p align="LEFT">As soon as they got in, Newt asked nervously, “You really don't mind?”</p><p align="LEFT">“Mind what?” Percival asked, turning the car on and getting on the road, intent on getting home as fast as possible. Even though the hot shower he took did a lot for his head and nausea, the light was still just a bit too bright.</p><p align="LEFT">“Letting me stay with you for the summer,” Newt explained, and this time, Percival gave him a bewildered look.</p><p align="LEFT">“What?”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt flushed, looking panicked, and he stuttered, “Y-you said I could stay the summer, didn't you?”</p><p align="LEFT">Percival's brow furrowed, thinking back to their conversation over the phone, and admitted weakly, “Sorry, I... I thought you were...” He shook his head, cleared his throat, then said, “Right. Just the summer.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt blinked, staring at Percival openly, and in a small voice, he asked, “Are you... okay with that? Keeping me for the summer?”</p><p align="LEFT">“Of course, Newt.” Percival said quickly, glancing his way, “What do you plan to do afterward?”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt sighed loudly, admitting, “I don't know anymore... I've always wanted to do something with animals. Be a veterinarian, maybe. But Theseus always said it wasn't a well-paying job. Said I would do better in a STEM field.”</p><p align="LEFT">Percival snorted at that, muttering, “Of course he would. He was an engineer of some sort back in England, wasn't he? He probably wants to see his precious little brother follow in his footsteps.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt smiled grimly, as amused as he could be the day after their partner's death, and he asked, “Well, that's what he wants. What would you want me to do after?”</p><p align="LEFT">Percival pursed his lips, thinking about it for a long moment, then admitted, “I don't think I very much care... so long as you're still with me after.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt fell silent. Percival deigned not to look at him. They drove along in silence for a few long minutes. Percival could hear Newt breathing beside him. His nose was stuffy, Percival noted.</p><p align="LEFT">When they got onto the highway, Newt shifted in his seat, then said wistfully, “Maybe I <em>will</em> become a veterinarian... I think the university nearby has a good program.” He shuffled his feet, getting nervous, and added, “And maybe... I won't have to worry about rooming there.”</p><p align="LEFT">Percival glanced his way, surprised, but he couldn't help the warmth that bloomed in his cold, broken heart. Reaching across the console of the car, Percival put his hand over Newt's knee and squeezed. He felt Newt's warm hand layer overtop his.</p><p align="LEFT">“Whatever you like, so long as you're still with me.” Percival hummed, stroking his thumb against Newt's knee. He knew it would be hard. Theseus might not support them from the beginning, but Percival was certain he would come around. And until then, Percival would do all he can to support his boy.</p><p align="LEFT">“What will you do after?” Newt asked a few minutes later, peeking up at Percival. The man merely shrugged.</p><p align="LEFT">“What I've been doing so far.” Percival said with a sigh, “Teaching chemistry and hoping no more of my students perish.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt frowned at that, squeezing Percival's hand, then asked, “Will you be able to?”</p><p align="LEFT">“Yes,” Percival answered immediately, although the crease between his brows didn't support that claim. “His death is not the first on my hands.”</p><p align="LEFT">Thinking about it, Newt asked hesitantly, “Why shouldn't he be the last, then?”</p><p align="LEFT">Percival sighed, looking exhausted at the thought. Newt bit his lip and ducked his head, muttering a quiet, “Sorry. I won't push it.” And he felt Percival squeeze his knee once more.</p><p align="LEFT">The rest of the ride was silent, save for the passing cars on either side of them. As Percival pulled into his driveway, Newt stared up at his modern house in surprise. “This is where you live?” He asked as he stepped out of the car, pulling his backpack over his shoulder, “It's huge!”</p><p align="LEFT">“Hardly,” Percival chuffed, closing and locking his car before approaching the front door. Newt followed after him, still in awe. “I have two guest rooms that you can select to make your own.” He pressed his thumb into the center of the doorknob, letting the DNA scanner validate him. When the door popped open, Percival muttered, “We'll have to get it to recognize you as well.”</p><p align="LEFT">“We can do it later,” Newt hummed, stepping into the house after him, looking around curiously.</p><p align="LEFT">Percival closed the door behind them, then said, “Go choose your bedroom and make yourself comfortable. I'll make something to eat.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt obeyed without another word, vanishing into the back of the house. Percival kicked off his shoes and hung his coat in the closet, then went to the kitchen, intent on putting together at least sandwiches. Even a little bit of food would do well for his stomach. He took out some vegetables, some cold meat, and some bread. He put together two beautiful looking ham, lettuce, and tomato sandwiches, plated them, and peered towards the hallway, wondering what was keeping Newt. He waited just a few more moments, then decided it would just be better to take the food to him instead.</p><p align="LEFT">Picking up the two plates, Percival headed down the hall. He peered into every room on his way, making sure he didn't miss the boy, and didn't find Newt until he entered his own bedroom at the very end of the hall. Newt had dropped his bag by the door and was sitting on the bed, head ducked and shoulders shaking. Percival's brow furrowed, and he carefully stepped further inside, making sure the boy knew he was there.</p><p align="LEFT">“Newt,” He said gently, sitting down beside the auburn-haired man, setting the plate in his lap, “Tell me what you're thinking.”</p><p align="LEFT">The boy sniffled, lifting his head enough to show Percival his teary eyes, fat drops running down his cheeks. “I just keep thinking... if Theseus never told you about me... if you and Credence didn't like me so much... he would still be alive.”</p><p align="LEFT">“You know that's not true,” Percival remarked, looking concerned, “You had nothing to do with what happened yesterday.”</p><p align="LEFT">“But I do! I'm the only reason why it happened, aren't I? I <em>failed</em>. And in order to save <em>my</em> life, Credence had to--!” He clenched his jaw, more tears falling, and ducked his head once more. Percival took in a slow breath, held it, then scooted closer to him. Picking the plate up once more, he set both of their meals on the floor by their feet. With that safely out of the way, Percival crawled further onto the bed, wrapped an arm around Newt's waist, and pulled on him until they were both lying on their sides, Newt's back pressed firmly to Percival's chest. Newt let out a painful sob, bringing his knees up so he was curled in a bit tighter. Percival held him tightly, being his support as his emotions overcame him, and he carefully whispered gentle reassurances against the top of his head.</p><p align="LEFT">As Newt slowly calmed down from his sorrow, Percival decided to tell his boy the truth.</p><p align="LEFT">“Newt...” He whispered, closing his eyes, “You didn't fail at all. And Credence... he <em>did</em> fail.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt sniffled, wiping his eyes slowly, then asked in a rough voice, “What do you mean?”</p><p align="LEFT">“Credence hadn't passed the Thinning since elementary school.” Percival admitted, brows furrowing, “Because his mother is Senator Mary Lou, and she's been vouching for him year after year.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt was silent. Percival pressed his lips into a line, then continued, “And when we met... I just had to save him. When his mother gave up on him, I vouched for him. That's how he was going to get through school.”</p><p align="LEFT">Sighing, he ended with a bleak, “But you passed, and still you were chosen for the Thinning. I never heard of that happening before. Our vouches never impacted who took their place. And as soon as you were on the chopping block, I just... had to make it right.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt shuddered in Percival's arms, silently letting the news sink in, and when he finally gathered the strength to speak, it was but a whisper.</p><p align="LEFT">“You chose... me...?” He asked, not even daring to look over his shoulder at the man holding him so carefully, so tightly, “Over Credence?”</p><p align="LEFT">Graves closed his eyes. They both knew the answer was yes. Newt being there, on Percival's bed, in Percival's arms, being comforted by Percival himself, was because Percival had indeed decided that Newt's life was worth more than Credence's. But Percival was selfish and in pain, so instead he said, “I chose to do what's right over what I wanted.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt blinked, the tears still flowing, although the sobs had dulled to a rare trembling gasp. “What you wanted was Credence instead of me?” He asked, curling up even tighter, trying not to let it show how much it hurt just to ask.</p><p align="LEFT">“What I wanted was both of you here,” Percival corrected immediately, not even having to consider it, “In my arms. In my bed. Safe and happy and with <em>me.”</em> He shook his head, then buried his nose in the back of Newt's head, breathing in his scent, committing it to memory, “But I couldn't have that. It would either be you or him. What is morally right or wrong. And no matter what... I believe I am a good man.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt shifted this time, turning in Percival's arms so he could look at him. Percival allowed their eyes to meet, and though his heart ached to gaze into sorrowful blues instead of deep, melancholic black, he didn't let himself flinch.</p><p align="LEFT">“It still hurts... doesn't it?” Newt asked softly. Percival didn't respond with his voice. He only nodded once, briefly, and Newt let out a breath held tight in his chest. “It hurts me, too... So badly. I can't imagine...” He blinked, blue eyes went watery once again, and he sighed, “I'm... so sorry.”</p><p align="LEFT">“You have nothing to apologize for,” Percival insisted, closing his eyes once more and pulling Newt close, tucking his head just underneath his chin, “And you shouldn't feel guilty for things you have not done.”</p><p align="LEFT">Newt breathed warm against his collarbone, sliding his hands first onto Percival's waist, then around to the small of his back. Percival kept his eyes shut, but he enjoyed the gentle touch, the warm glide of Newt's hands, and the reassurance they provided.</p><p align="LEFT">“Thank you,” He finally whispered, and Percival felt his heartache, “I... Don't know if you want to hear it, but... Thank you. For saving me. And...” Newt took a long breath, held it for a few even longer seconds, and then carefully let it out as he said, “I forgive you... for Credence. Because I know he would understand.”</p><p align="LEFT">Percival had not dared let a single tear drop in front of Newt up until then. And even when his emotions were struck and his heart bled, the tears came silently, belied not even by his breath. And still, even with his eyes closed and his face hidden, Newt must have felt it somehow, because he was tightening his hold and riding out the sorrow and grief with him.</p><p align="LEFT">After a long while, laying in bed and wasting the day away, Percival insisted, “You should eat.” Newt didn't want to move, and he made that obvious when he burrowed deeper into Percival's chest, but eventually, they unwound from one another, picked up their untouched plates, and fed themselves. The food tasted like dust and ash and air, their mouths chewing only by force of habit while their minds ran a hundred miles a minute. Percival peered at Newt, and Newt met his gaze fleetingly.</p><p align="LEFT">And in that moment, Graves decided that he would never let anything happen to this man.</p>
