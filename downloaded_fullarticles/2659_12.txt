    <p>The playing field had never been even, for as long as Harry could remember, life had been utterly stacked against him. The encounter he had at the end of the school year taught him as much- as long as Voldemort was alive, he would never be left alone. The man would continue to go after him, endangering anyone Harry would ever care about ever in the process.</p><p>He- He couldn’t let another Cedric happen.</p><p>The idea came to him a few days after he had been dropped at his aunt’s house. The Dursleys had been watching some talk show on the telly. It was one of those rare moments he could catch a glance at the telly, as he had been cleaning the living the room. He had been swiping the windows, his mind constantly replaying the events of the graveyard. The voice of that monster taunting his every living moment. It was at that moments his ears caught something, his attention suddenly fully focused on the telly.</p><p>‘Say, John, if you could travel back in time, would you kill baby Hitler?’ The tv-audience laughed, but Harry’s breath hitched. Was that the solution to his problem? Killing Voldemort before the man became a problem? A future wherein Cedric could have lived? A future where his parents could have lived.</p><p><em>‘Dangerous things happen to wizards who mess with Time.’</em> Hermione’s words sprang to the front of mind, and Harry felt his mood drop again. Besides, now that he thought about it, if time travel was possible, someone else would’ve used it already, right? Someone more intelligent than him, more powerful?</p><p>But the thought wasn’t something that would leave him, and in spite of himself, Harry could quickly feel himself becoming obsessed with the idea. With every mindless chore the Dursleys dropped on him, every moment he heard nothing of friends or Sirius, every moment left to his mourning mind, the idea became more and more of a lifeline. A far away ray of hope in the spiraling abyss of his mind. It became the only thing he could focus on, an impulse so strong Harry had trouble ignoring it.</p><p>Harry decided.. Well, he could at least look into the idea? If he could prevent his friends from ever getting hurt..</p><p>After three weeks spent with the Dursleys, Harry set out from the house on one uncharacteristically cold day. Harry knew it was suicidal, with Voldemort being back, but his mind was set. He snuck out at dawn, before any of the Dursleys would wake, and summoned the knight-bus a few streets away.</p><p>Harry knew Dumbledore would disapprove of him once again leaving his aunt’s ‘care’, and he wouldn’t be surprised it wouldn’t take long for the man to find out he was gone once Harry arrived at Diagon Alley. He wouldn’t be surprised if he was sent back to the Dursleys immediately. Harry knew he had to be quick with his business, though he was far from sure where he should actually start to look. Hermione had always been the researcher between the three of them.</p><p>Harry felt a pang in his heart. He had not heard from his friend’s all summer. It felt like second year all over again, but Harry doubted another house elf was nicking his letters..</p><p>He’d do it alone, then.</p><p>He thanked the bus driver as he got off, and quickly made his way towards the Leaky Cauldron. He made sure to flatten his hair over his scar, but he knew Tom the innkeeper was bound to recognize him anyway. He pulled up his hoodie, steeled himself, and tried to make his way to the entrance of the alley as quietly as possible.</p><p>As luck would have it, Tom was not at the bar at the moment. Harry heard a rumble from the kitchen. ‘Coming’ The innkeeper shouted. Harry had already left the pub before the innkeeper could get a glance at him.</p><p>He knew he’d stick out as a sore thump with his muggle clothes, but the only robes he had were his school clothes.. It was unfortunate, but not something he could do something about right now.</p><p>Harry decided to start at Flourish and Blotts, deciding it was as good a place to start as any. Now that he was actually in Diagon Alley, his lack of information seemed a much larger problem than it had in his head. He.. really had nothing to go on. He decided to just follow his instinct, the feeling that had been leading him towards Diagon Alley in the first place.</p><p>He roamed the bookshelves, looking for anything, anything that might help him. His eyes caught a small tattered old leather bound book, the letters on the cover worn and faded. ‘<strong>The steadiness of Chronos, the favor of Caerus.</strong>’ Harry recognized the name, knowing it was one of the Greek gods for time.</p><p>He opened the book, and read the first pages.</p><p>
  <strong>Chronos, the Greek god of chronological time, often portrayed as an elderly man, is perhaps one of the most interesting gods within the Greek faith. Often contrasted with Caerus, the god of opportunity, and the Greek concept of Kairos, ‘a so called right time to do something’. </strong>
</p><p>Harry did not understand the feeling, but somehow he could tell he had found what he was looking for. He bought a few other books as well- <strong>1940s- A wizarding perspective</strong> and <strong>Decorum through the ages</strong>, and even <strong>Changing times – A look at Magical Britain before the social revolution</strong>. Harry was by no means as thorough as Hermione, but even he understood that he needed to extensive research if he even wanted to get close to his arch nemesis. If he succeeded to go back in time, no one could figure out who he really was.</p><p>Harry went to Gringotts, and took out all the gold of his trust vault. During his years in the wizarding world, it had been left mostly untouched, and Harry figured it would be enough to last him for a few more years at least. He exchanged some of his gold into pounds, and set out for the muggle world. Harry made a quick stop at a muggle book store for some more books on the 1940s, figuring the extra information couldn’t hurt.</p><p>He rented a room at a cheap motel, the kind of place that wouldn’t ask for identification if you paid a little extra, and started to tear through the books he had bought. If anyone was looking for him, surely the muggle world was the last place to expect him? He refrained from using magic, knowing the ministry would find out immediately.</p><p>The more Harry read, the more unsure he grew.</p><p>
  <strong>Greek wizards always have believed in their god’s willingness to help them with the right offering, if the need truly exists. Caerus, though less well known, is believed to help mortals as well. No recorded instances of this happening exist, however, and it is unknown which offering the god of fortune would want for. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Several legends around West Greece indicate that the god will only help those chosen by the fates, if they find themselves by the entrance of Olympia on the full moon. Caerus will appear to them, if they call out for the god. Caerus would ask them what it is they search for, and send them to the moment the person thought to be the Kairos for their task, if the god judges their chosen point in time to be worthy enough. </strong>
</p><p>It was a long shot. Chosen by the fates? What did that even mean? Did the Greek gods even exist? Religion wasn’t something that was often openly discussed in the wizarding world, apparently considered more of a private affair. Harry wasn’t even sure what most people believed in at Hogwarts, Merlin, he’d never even given it much thought what he himself believed in.</p><p>Between the Dursleys and the annual attempts at his life, Harry supposed there was a lot he really had never thought about.</p><p>Going to Greece on a hunch, a shot in the dark, really. Drawing it even further, going back in time to kill Voldemort, had he ever had a more reckless and likely to fail plan? During all his years at Hogwarts, he had never been alone, answers to mysteries always handed to him on a silver platter. He felt utterly insecure, how could he be so stupid as to think this would ever work?</p><p>He couldn’t do this- He should just let Dumbledore handle this and- <em>Like he handled Quirrel? The chamber of Secrets? Sirius and Buckbeak? The tournament? You were always the one to clean up the dirty work..</em> The voice in his mind supplied, and Harry’s expression darkened.</p><p>Confrontation with Voldemort was inevitable. It didn’t matter how far-fetched this plan was, for once, he was going to fight on his terms.</p><p>Harry pored back over his books, filled with a new sense of determination.</p><p>It didn’t take long for Harry to plan. A few trips to local libraries, and he found at the next date of the full moon- 22 July, and he made a plan to get to Greece. He didn’t manage to finish the books he had bought on the 1940s yet, but it would have to do. Two days after checking into the hotel, Harry set out on his journey, the full moon being that night already.</p><p>Much like he had earlier that summer, he slipped into the Leakey Cauldron early that morning. This time, however, Tom the innkeeper was at the bar. ‘Welcome, how can I help you?’ The elderly man asked. ‘Just passing through.’ Harry answered, as he tried to look as unsuspicious as possible.</p><p>Tom’s eyes widened in recognition. ‘Mister Potter? What are you doing here alone? If the rumors are true..’ Harry didn’t stay to listen, but quickly tapped the right bricks in the back of the inn, and rushed into Diagon Alley.</p><p>He had found out about the international floosystem during his third year, when he had been staying at the Leakey Cauldron. He would have preferred to use muggle means of transportation, the more time he spent in the wizarding world, the likelier it was word got back to Voldemort or Dumbledore, but Harry did not have a passport, so he doubted he could even manage to get onto a plane..</p><p>Luckily, wizarding folk were a paranoid bunch who did not want their privacy violated, so the international floo was barely monitored according to the information he had found. And with the ministry being in denial, it was unlikely they upped security measures.</p><p>Harry entered the Diagon Alley international Floo hub, and paid the teller the fee needed to use the service. The office had a board with the name of the various other hubs, which he would need to call out to reach the city of his choice.</p><p>An idea hit Harry. If anyone had seen him, why not make it harder to track him? He doubted it mattered, but the extra security measures couldn’t hurt. On a whim, Harry called out ‘Amsterdam, floo hub’ and threw down the powder.</p><p> </p><p>Harry coughed as he stumbled out of the floo. He was covered in soot, as he always was when he got out of the floo. This office was set up in much the same way as the office in London had been, and Harry repeated the process. This time he called out for ‘Paris, floo hub’, and then ‘Sofia, floo hub, and then ‘Berlin, floo hub, finally finishing with ‘Athens, floo hub.’</p><p>Harry felt exhausted as he had reached his last floo destination. Although the floo didn’t draw on his own magic, the actual sensation of the travel took a toll on his body. And with how many times he had used it..</p><p>‘Man, you look like shit.’ Harry heard someone say behind him. He saw a blonde young man in muggle clothes, who was grinning widely. ‘Here, let me help ya!’ The man conjured a wand from his sleeve, and cast a smell on Harry in a language the boy did not recognize.</p><p>The soot disappeared from his skin, and Harry inclined his head in thanks. ‘Thank you.’ He mumbled, for extra effect. He turned around and left the shop, the young man quickly fading from his mind again. If he had looked back when he had left the shop, Harty would have noticed the man vanishing in thin air.</p><p>Harry left the Greek wizarding world, bought his bus ticket, and arrived at Olympia at around noon.</p><p>It didn’t take long for him to reach the archeological site, where presumable the entrance would be he was looking for, for that was where presumably the altar of Caerus would be. He followed around a tourist guide, and thanks to the pamphlet they had gotten at the start of the tour, Harry approximately found out where he needed to be. When the tour had ended, Harry hid on the site, waiting for night to fall.</p><p>Just as the sun was about to set, Harry heard of a voice behind him, the hair on his back standing up at the drawling sound of it.</p><p>‘Impromptu vacation, mister Potter?’</p>
