    <p>Y/n was surprised to see that she was standing at the edge of a forest in the past. She put her wand away after healing her wrist and happy that it was only her wrist that got damaged in her fall. She knew she would have a big bruise on her chest but it looked like the time turner took the brunt of the hit. So put the time turner into the bag that her close friend had charmed with an extinction charm.  She walked into the town of Hogsmeade she watched as people past her if they had a Daily Prophet and carefully looked at the year. She covered her mouth to hide her surprise that it was 1971. So quickly sent out her Patronus to Dumbledore if she could be allowed entrance into Hogwarts. </p><p>So as she reached the gates she was not surprised to see that he was waiting for her. </p><p>"I promise to answer all your question, Sir. But I would rather that we have this conversation in the room of requirements."</p><p>He was about to ask something but Y/n spoke quickly.</p><p>"Let's just say I have family there in your office that should not know about me."</p><p>He looked at the girl and nodded showing the girl to the room that she wanted to speak in. He could tell that she was lost in thought and wondered if he should dare to take a look into her mind.</p><p>"Please don't."</p><p>"Pardon."</p><p>"I know who you are sir. I know that you think that if I lost in my own thoughts that maybe you could tempt chance and use Legilimency. I assure you that I will tell you everything that I can when we reach the room, sir."</p><p>He smiles with a twinkle in his eye and stopped in front of the wall walking back and forth three times to have a door appear before them. He asked for the room to look like a sitting room. He opened the door and allowed Y/n to enter first. They each took a seat and he waited to explain herself.</p><p>Y/n sighed, "Sir, I come from the year 1999 and the war was won. But it was not an easy task. I did not mean to come into the past this far. I won't lie to you, sir. I did have plans to come into the past and just watch everyone from afar. But in my time my friends and I were playing a game of Quidditch. I fell off my broom after being hit with a quaffle it must have hit the time turner."</p><p>Y/n opened her bag to search for it to him. When she had it in her hand she handed it to him. Hoping that he would be able to help her.</p><p>"Professor I just want to return home."</p><p>"I see."</p><p>Y/n was shocked that was all he had to say.</p><p>"Do not fret, miss..."</p><p>Y/n sighed because she really didn't know how to answer that question. Her father was alive at this time and her mother was as well. But the woman that raised her was more her mother anyone but it hurt to find out the truth before the game she played with her friends. </p><p>
  <strong>***FLASHBACK***</strong>
</p><p><em>Y/n was in her room watching over her nephew Teddy playing with his toys missing her sister when he changed his hair to pink. There was a knock on the door</em> </p><p><em>"Come in!"</em> </p><p>
  <em>She pulled Teddy into her arms and hugged him tightly. She heard the door open but didn't bother to look.  She pulled back to look into Teddy's eyes and smiled.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Who is it Teddy?" she asked and smiled when his hair changed to look like his father's hair. "Is it daddy?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Dada!"</em>
</p><p><em>Y/n stood up with Teddy and turned towards the visitor.</em> </p><p>
  <em>"Traitor. You, little pup."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Y/n smiled at the pair as Remus took Teddy from her arms. She was about to talk when there was another knock on her door they all turned to see that it was Andromeda.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Do you mind leaving me alone with Y/n, Remus?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Not at all was Andy. I'll take Teddy for a walk." </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Once Remus left the room Andromeda started casting spell after spell to ensure that they could not be overheard.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Mum, what's wrong? I know those spells well enough that it must be serious."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Once Andromeda turned to her second daughter she had tears in her eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Mum?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I love you as my own daughter but that is the thing you are not. Don't look at me like that. You have no cause to fear me but I fear for you if people learn about your true parentage."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Does it matter?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"It does child because your father still has followers that have yet to be caught."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Y/n eyes widen because only one man had follower sighing she asked, "Who was my mother?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With tears in her eyes, "Bellatrix."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Y/n had let herself fall to the ground and cried into her hands. Andromeda was quick to join her daughter on the ground and held her close letting her cry.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>***END FLASHBACK***</strong>
</p><p>"Professor, I have two sets of parents in my time and both my mothers came from the Black family. They were sisters and only one of them did one right thing in her life. But I will never take my fathers' name."</p><p>"And who would that be?"</p><p>"Sorry professor but that is one secret I can not give you."</p><p>"I will help you but I don't want to make any promises dear. I will need to make some fire calls to see where you can stay. Could you at least tell me your mothers names."</p><p>"The one that gave me life is Bellatrix Black and the one that raised me was Andromeda."</p><p>"I see. I think I know who I shall call. But what do you say to reenter Hogwarts?"</p><p>"You want me to what? Professor, I am too old to be in Hogwarts. How will that work for me to reentering into Hogwarts?"</p><p>"Oh we will be walking out of this room and you will head over to the Hospital wing and give this note to Madam Poppy. She will be giving you a de-aging potion."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>"I will meet you later when I am done with the fire call."</p><p>They both left and they went in a different direction.</p>
