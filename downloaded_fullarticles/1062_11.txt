    <p>
  <span>Lucius Malfoy walks down the white hallway of St. Mungo, his cane rapping sharply on the floors as witches and wizards alike make way for him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As he nears the lift, he inwardly sighs in relief once he sees that it’s empty. Quickly, he makes his way inside and presses the button labeled as: </span>
  <b>Littles’ Maladies. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The lift goes down for a short time, and then Lucius steps out into another hallway, this one a stark contrast to the rest of the hospital with its polka-dotted walls and colorful doors. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lucius does not waste time looking around. Instead, he immediately moves to room number 15, with its pale green door. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He raps at it with his cane a total of three times sharply, and when the expected answer comes, he steps inside the colourful room, eyes immediately zeroing on the Little laughing in the medi-wizard’s arms. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Severus?” He calls out, voice soft but excited.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Severus Snape’s morning started the same way it has for the last three months since the start of summer: a medi-wizard, Jacob, rubbing his back gently.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wake up, sweetheart, today is an important day!” Jacob chuckles, smiling as he watches Severus yawn before blinking his eyes open. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good morning!” Jacob greets the Little, picking him up from the standard white crib every room in this department has. Severus cuddles into Jacob’s shoulder, grumbling slightly at the light coming in through the window. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jacob takes him to the bathroom, clinically stripping him of the blue sleeping sack he put on him last night. Although it’s been three months, Severus still blushes madly when Jacob takes his nappy off and puts him in the Little-proofed tub. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Efficiently, Jacob cleans and washes him after emptying a bottle of scar-removal potion into the tub. Severus giggles when Jacob washes his sides and feet, now no longer sleepy. “Bubs!” Severus exclaimes, clapping his hands happily and making Jacob chuckle once more. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After they’re done, Jacob picks him up and take him out of the tub, wrapping him in a big towel. A wave of his wand has the tub drained and back to its previous clean state. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Casting a Tempus, Jacob tsks. “Your Daddy is coming in the next thirty minutes, so we ought to be quick.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The medi-wizard ignores Severus’ confused look at the mention of a Daddy, instead laying the Little Baby down on the changing table. He gives Severus a rattle, and gets down to dressing Severus. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>First comes the nappy, and next is the striped white and blue onesie that St. Mungo’s gives to every Little that leaves its walls. Severus babbles as he plays, not at all concerned with what he’s wearing. Finally, Jacon sits him up on the table cautiously, one arm around Severus’ shoulder to keep him balanced and away from falling. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A verbal Accio brings forth Severus’ brush, and so Jacon begins the process of brushing Severus’ trimmed hair, now soft instead of greasy– which was the result of living in an industrial district such as Cokeworth. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Each time the brush comes to the nape of Severus’ neck, the Little gives a muffled giggle. This continues until Severus cannot contain himself anymore and starts laughing, leaning into Jacob’s arms. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It is at that moment three sharp knocks sound from the door. Severus still giggles, but Jacob is only smiling when he tells whoever it is to enter, already knowing it’s Severus’ Caregiver. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lucius Malfoy steps inside in all his glory, robes shimmering. Seeing Severus, a gentle smile lights up his face and he calls out the Little’s name, his tone soft. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Severus, meanwhile, is frozen for a few seconds, but then he beams and squeals, struggling to get out of Jacob’s arms and into Lucius’.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Luci!” He squeals, clinging to the older Caregiver happily when Jacob transfers him to Lucius’ arms. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello, sweetheart,” Lucius smiles softly, patting Severus’ back. He hides his frown at the cheap feeling of </span>
  <em>
    <span>his </span>
  </em>
  <span>Little’s onesie, but comforts himself with the knowledge that he’ll be dressing Severus in much better clothes soon enough. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ready to come back home?” He asks as the medi-wizard prepares his Little’s meager belongings and copied medical file along with the other paperwork. His hand pats Severus’ bum, while the Little himself has one hand tangled in Lucius’ hair and the other in the folds of Lucius’ robes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“‘Ome?” Severus asks confusedly, kicking a leg out lazily. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Malfoy Manor,” Lucius explains. “You’re my Little now, sweet boy.” He cooes, rubbing his cheek with Severus’ softer one. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“...Daddy?” Severus asks hesitantly, now having a better idea of what Jacob was talking about earlier. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The smile Lucius gives him has him grinning back at the Caregiver, no longer hesitant. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, sweet boy, I’m your Daddy now.”</span>
