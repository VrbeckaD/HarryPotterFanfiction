<p><u> <em> Prologue </em> </u> <em> - </em> <em> <u> Oxyuranus</u>. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The tension was palpable in the Room of Requirement. The students and future Death Eaters looked at each other, sucking their breaths as they waited for their leader. They were accusatory eyes, wanting to find a culprit of why they were all there, yet everyone shared something: fear.</p>
<p>They could taste the fear in their tongues, they felt they heart hammer against their ribs, each beat was an affliction. The silence was so deep that a pin could be heard if it fell to the floor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> How bad will it be? </em> They wondered. <em> Mercy. Who would not want to receive mercy in this situation? </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The door opened and <em> he </em> came. The future Death Eaters cringed, watching that door disappear, leaving no means of escape. There were no windows, no doors or any way to escape. They were trapped. Trapped with death, torture, sadism embodying a boy handsome as an angel. An obscure and Machiavellian angel.</p>
<p>Tom Riddle came in like a hurricane, rage flickering across his face. He walked with firm and quick steps, his teeth sawing in frustration. He was just in his shirt with his sleeves rolled up to his elbow and the Slytherin's tie slightly loose, his sweater, gray blazer and robe far from visible.</p>
<p>The Knights of Walpurgis, seeing their leader's wrath, moved away, trying to stay out of sight of Riddle, but nothing and no one could save Alphard Black.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Riddle..." Alphard begins, but is stopped by Tom, who pulled him by the collar of his shirt, slamming Alphard's back against the wall, then punching the pit of his stomach.</p>
<p>Tom, in all his psychotic and princely aura, watched his servant slide down the wall, placing his hand on his stomach to stroke the pain and falling in his knees. Through the strands of his hair, Alphard casts a glance and chin up defiantly, awakening Tom's berserk. Tom's hands tremble as he twists them into a fist, the strong, dark, vengeful magic revolves around him, there is a red light in his eyes. A bestial roar welled up in Tom's throat as he glanced at Alphard Black, any trace of coherence was lost and then he lunged at the boy. What came next was brutal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even Alphard - who have a brave, almost Gryffindor spirit - couldn’t contain his screams. The sequence of punches on the face and kicks in the ribs, made him bewildered and unable to defend himself. In the room, it was possible to feel the angry magic of Tom, as if it were something alive and when Alphard tried to drag himself away, such magic intensified.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b> <em>He would beg.</em> </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b> <em>He would not run away.</em> </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom dragged him back by the legs and then punched him again. He gritted his teeth and must have done some spell, as irregular cuts opened in Alphard's face. Tom wanted to undo Alphard's face, because the image of him smiling at her, was still fresh in his mind and all he wanted was to make it impossible for Alphard to smile.</p>
<p>It would stay in his mind, that every time he tried to approach her, that would happen to him. And it would get worse and worse and worse. Then, it would have more blood and more blood and more blood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom felt a fury so blinding that when a crack was heard, he seemed to awaken from his trance. <em> I broke something. What was? The nose? No, no. This one I broke when I hammered his face against the wall. Ah, the jawbone. You can’t smile now, can you? </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>He stood up slowly. There was a splash of blood on his face, on his shirt and blood on his hands, his knuckles were sore and Alphard's face was unrecognizable, yet it was still not enough.</p>
<p>He looked at his servants, watching intently the horrified and fearful features of them. Tom laughed out loud. He actually laughed as if this was the funniest joke he'd ever heard. An involuntary tear appeared in his eyes and he wiped it away before it fell, staining his pale face with more blood, and then he turned his eyes, which glittered in red, to Alphard, who was sprawled on the ground, making no move, except involuntary spasms and grunts of pain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> Treacherous him, eh? Trying to steal me right under my nose. How dare he try to take her away from me? </em> Tom pondered. <em> Kill it or not kill it? </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh, how he'd like to squeeze his throat and see life coming out of him, watching his skin turn purple from breathlessness until nothing was left. It was tempting indeed, but the Black family is one of the most important connections he could have in the Wizarding World and also, it would be very bad to deal with another murder after what happened to Myrtle. This time there would be no Hagrid to blame, not that this was the problem, he could find another victim of his manipulations. The problem was all the work that would have to be done and well, he didn’t have the patience for it. And by the way, this was a damn Black. Investigations would certainly be more meaningful simply because of the damn surname Alphard carried.</p>
<p>Tom put his hands on his waist and looked at the ceiling of the Room of Requirement. <em> Shit, I cannot kill him! </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>He couldn’t kill him, it wouldn’t mean that he wouldn’t give him a remembrance, a reminder. Tom then stepped slowly and hard on the fingers of Alphard's left hand. Alphard tried to make some sound, a cry of pain, but his broken jaw wouldn’t let him do it and if he tried, the more pain he would feel.</p>
<p>Another 'crack' was heard, so everyone knew that, so everyone knew that Alphard's fingers were broken. However, nothing could be darker than the smile that Tom Riddle had on his face. After what seemed to be an eternity, Tom stops stepping on Alphard's fingers and gives a final kick to his stomach, indicating the end of the torture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was certainly ironic as The Dark Lord, a powerful wizard with his dark magic, chose such Muggle methods to torture someone. But he wanted to feel the blood on his hands. He drew back, his footsteps being the only noise in the Room, his servants were frozen, staring at the floor of the Room of Requirement as if it was the most interesting thing they had ever seen.Tom took his wand in the pocket of his pants and with a wave, the blood stains on his clothes, hands and face disappeared. He could not wander the halls of Hogwarts with bloodstains.</p>
<p>He glanced over his shoulder,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Clean this mess," was an order, his voice in a cold tone, making his servants shudder. "I hope you have understood what happens when you practice Quidditch. Someone always falls off the broom. "</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There it was, the lie everyone would tell. Tom left the details of the lie for them to handle. Without further ado, the door of the Room of Requirement appeared, Tom Riddle left.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When<em> that </em> door disappeared again, they all went into hysteria.</p>
<p>
  <br/>
