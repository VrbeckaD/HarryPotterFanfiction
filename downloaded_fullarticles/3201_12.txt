    <p>
  <span>So far, summer hadn’t been nearly as unbearable as Sansa Stark had expected it to be. Since she was now of age in the wizarding world, the magic that had kept her safe for seventeen years, born from her mother’s sacrifice, was no longer in effect. This meant that, unlike every year preceding, she wasn’t forced to spend the summer break at the Eyrie with her Aunt Lysa and cousin Robin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That in itself was an incredible blessing, one she’d looked forward to ever since she’d first started at Hogwarts and learned just why she had to live in the Eyrie, when she had other, much more loving and palatable family members willing to take her in. Only the fact that Lysa Arryn had the Tully blood within her veins made the woman a better caregiver for Sansa than Sansa’s Aunt Lyanna and Uncle Rhaegar. Lysa was Sansa’s mother’s last living relative, save for Edmure Tully (who was currently serving a lifetime sentence in Azkaban for betraying Sansa’s parents). As such, living with Lysa had given Sansa protection from the dark wizard that had once tried to kill her, and from the followers that lingered still amongst the wizarding populace, biding their time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Due to events that occurred several months ago, Sansa knew now that, despite the general consensus of the wizarding world, Voldemort was still out there, alive and awaiting the moment he would return to power. Voldemort had killed both her parents and her older brother when she was but an infant, all victims to his determination to kill a baby predicted to be his equal in one measly prophecy. The fact that she had lost the protection from her mother’s sacrifice should have worried her, but in fact she was more relieved than anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was quite telling that Sansa would rather risk her life than go back to the Eyrie for the summer to be with Lysa and Robin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She imagined that, were anyone else in her position, they’d feel much the same as she did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But, the main reason she’d dreaded this summer, was one she’d wholly unexpected before she’d started her sixth year at Hogwarts. Who would have thought that a year could change so much?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet it had.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sansa had fallen in love, in the most unexpected of ways. She’d fallen so deeply that she’d given over herself completely, irreversibly, exquisitely. The man who had stolen her heart had taught her so much over the school year, of love and loyalty, of magic and life. Of herself. And Sansa was determined that nothing would ever part them, so long as they both still lived.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately, even though she was officially considered an adult in the wizarding world, she was still attending school, with one more year until she’d officially graduated from Hogwarts. So, when the school year ended, it was expected that she spend the summer with her Aunt Lyanna and Uncle Rhaegar at Winterfell, rather than elsewhere. And, since Sansa couldn’t exactly just move in with her Potions Master, student-teacher relationships rather frowned upon (or so she imagined. She wasn’t sure the matter had ever come up before), she’d figured she might as well stay with family. It was easier than attempting to explain why she wouldn’t want to stay at Winterfell, when she’d always looked forward to her visits before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still, despite not being able to live together, or be seen in public as a couple, Sansa and Petyr had found a way to be together. Just before term had ended, they’d completed a ritual that had bound their minds, hearts, bodies, and souls together, a magic that would forever link them to one another until death parted them. Whatever their distance, they could join minds and check in on each other, and, upon her breast, above her heart, was a mockingbird, which pulsed in time to Petyr’s heart. He had a similar mark, shaped like a direwolf, which beat in time with her own life’s pulse. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In addition, Petyr had gotten her a summer job at the Ministry of Magic, as an intern in the Goblin Liaison Office. As he was head of the Goblin Liaison Office, this gave them plenty of opportunities and reasons to be with each other in public, both at the Ministry and at Gringotts in Diagon Alley. Something which most certainly pleased them both.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d wrangled the position for her by playing on the advantage Tywin Lannister, the Minister of Magic, would have by cozying up to The Wolf Who Lived (a name she’d been gifted with after her so called defeat of Voldemort over sixteen years ago). Tywin was getting desperate for anything to help him keep his post, as he struggled to maintain the image that he was doing a wonderful job managing the wizarding world of Great Britain. And, since it was well known that Petyr had taught her private lessons last year, it wouldn’t raise too many eyebrows for her to accept an internship under him, especially since she made it publicly known at the beginning of summer that she was starting to consider a career in the Ministry after she left school. She honestly wasn’t, still determined on a career in potions, but nobody need know that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Though, since she’d started working there, she had to admit that politics held a certain allure….</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, time together wasn’t the only reason he’d hired her. No, they had other reasons for her new employment, far beyond romance. Petyr had taught her much about wizarding politics in Great Britain, in between lessons in Legilimency and Occlumency, as well as frequent bouts of lovemaking. These lessons weren’t merely about preparing her for Voldemort’s eventual return (though that in itself always weighed heavily on their minds), but about implementing the plans Petyr had spent years crafting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had hopes of shattering the pureblood mentality that still ran rampant in the wizarding world, using Muggle technology to simultaneously destroy the prejudices that had previously held him back, and elevate his own status. When they’d fallen in love, his plans had become hers. Sansa wanted nothing more than to help him achieve his lifelong ambitions, and if it helped create a better world and usher in a new age of enlightenment, all the better.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not to mention, her not so little problem of dealing with Voldemort would be far easier with the majority of wizardkind, in Great Britain and perhaps beyond, at her back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Indeed, the summer had honestly been the best Sansa had ever had, all things considering. She was busy, to be sure, preparing for Voldemort’s eventual return, helping Petyr forward his plans, working, spending time with loved ones, and doing the homework her professors had set for the summer holiday. And whenever she wasn’t with Petyr, even with their minds connected, she missed him. But overall, it was a far cry from summers at the Eyrie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No crazy aunt to swoop in on her on a moment’s whim, no sickly Robin to pester her to play with him. No sad, lonely existence with only her direwolf to comfort her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, Sansa was staying at Winterfell with the Targaryen-Starks, among them one of her best friends, Arya Stark. Sansa loved her Aunt Lyanna and Uncle Rhaegar, and her cousins, Jon, Arya, Bran, and Rickon. And she loved Winterfell too, with its godswood, and the four direwolves that prowled its premises, her own direwolf, Lady, joining the pack like she’d never left. It was one of life’s lovely little coincidences that the Targaryen-Starks had adopted four of Lady’s siblings, with the last, Grey Wind, living at Hogwarts with the gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid. Sansa loved the fact that though the siblings had been parted soon after birth, they were all reunited in the end.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her other best friend, Margaery Tyrell, was staying at her home, Highgarden, for the summer, but, having passed her Apparition test at the end of last year, Margaery made frequent visits to Winterfell. Sansa was thrilled that for once she wouldn’t spend the summer alone, with only letters and Lady to keep her company. She, too, had passed her Apparition test, and, together with Arya (who had also passed), they sometimes visited Margaery in Highgarden, or met in Diagon Alley. Sometimes Margaery’s boyfriend, Fred Weasley, joined them, as well as Arya’s friend, Gendry Waters (who Arya insisted was nothing more than a friend), and sometimes they met with other classmates, former or current, by chance or design.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Often, when Margaery visited Winterfell, they all went to the godswood to practice dueling. Both Margaery and Arya had been informed that Voldemort (whose name Margaery still refused to speak, along with most of the wizarding world) was still alive, and though they’d been terrified, they’d all agreed that they’d better prepare themselves for his eventual return. Sansa didn’t mention that their practice was in fact Petyr’s idea, though both her friends knew that she was dating him. While Sansa was immensely grateful that she no longer had to hide her relationship from her best friends, there was still so much she unfortunately had to keep secret from them. She hated betraying their trust, but if she had to for anyone, she’d do it for Petyr. And, for now, it was best to keep the majority of her plans with Petyr a secret. Even those that involved preparing for the inevitable fight with Voldemort.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, three days a week, Sansa Apparated to the Ministry, for her job in the Goblin Liaison Office. Her aunt and uncle thought that Sansa worked five days a week rather than three, a necessary lie she’d told so that she could spend the remaining two days with Petyr, in his home or elsewhere, developing her skills in Occlumency and Legilimency, among other things. Today was Monday, and, rather than Apparating to the Ministry, she Apparated to just outside Petyr’s home, letting herself in through the door set into the gated driveway and sealing it behind her with a spell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petyr Baelish was like no one she’d ever met before, and yet like someone she’d known all of her life. It was this enigma that had drawn her to him, along with his characteristic smirk, impeccable wit, and the streaks of grey lining his temples that somehow only heightened his appeal. He helped bring out the potential he’d quickly seen in her, and she had blossomed considerably under his tutelage, in more ways than one. His love had changed her, helped her come into her own, and she knew that without him, she might never have gained the strength to fight for what she wanted, to shield herself and the ones she loved from Voldemort’s wrath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They complemented each other so well, both talented in Potions and Legilimency, with a taste for the finer things in life. She loved just listening to him talk, whether he was teaching her something or simply making conversation, and even when they argued, which wasn’t often, their differences were quickly resolved. He made her laugh and cry, grow and change, and every moment spent with him, even in times of strife, were moments that she’d never trade for anything. He challenged her, treated her like an equal, and though at first he’d been fairly closed off, in time he’d let her in, allowing her to see everything he had to give.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But as much as the rest thrilled her, Sansa's favorite moments with Petyr were often found amidst their times of passion. They both had magic in their veins, but as they moved as one, she felt an entirely different kind of magic, one far deeper and far older than casting spells or brewing potions. It was stronger too, weaving their very souls together as their bodies joined, an unstoppable force that was both terrible and beautiful in its very nature. Love had bound them together, even before they’d performed the ritual that had made them inseparable, and love would keep them together. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even in death.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had already lost so many she loved, and though she missed her parents and brother every day, she knew her love for them kept them near. So it would be if death parted her and Petyr, though, if she could help it, it wouldn’t.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sansa walked right up to the front door and whispered “Lemon Cake” to unlock it, then slipped inside. Whenever she visited, he locked the door so that it would only open for that particular password (or others they’d agreed upon), and sent away the house elves that looked after the property. He also sealed the fireplaces against unwanted intrusions, and, of course, like many wizarding dwellings, it was impossible to Apparate directly in and out of the house (though Petyr and Sansa could both Apparate from room to room once inside, if they so wished). In addition, he made sure not to schedule any visits with any of the various contacts he kept at his disposal. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She found Petyr in his office, hard at work, like she always did when she visited. But, like always, as soon as he saw her he stopped, laying aside his quill in favor of kissing her hello. Sansa slipped into his lap, lacing her fingers together behind his neck, and kissed him, smiling against his mouth, his lips curved to match her own.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good morning, sweetling,” he said when he’d pulled back, grey-green eyes alight with the same smile that still lingered on his lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good morning,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you sleep well?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sansa nodded. He leaned in and kissed her again, then gently urged her off of his lap. “Good,” he told her, rising from his seat. “For we have a busy day ahead of us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They spent the day as they usually did on Mondays and Wednesdays. Starting first with Occlumency, the most trying of her lessons, and therefore the best to start with, when her mind was fresh. Then, they broke for lunch, discussing their plans, adjusting their future moves as needed, arranging for every contingency they could think of. After they’d eaten, they’d continue strengthening her talents in Legilimency, sometimes following up with practice in the art of dueling, before they whiled away the rest of their time on whims that had little to do with their plans for the future. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was an uneventful day, and she quite liked it that way, for she’d had far too many eventful days in her life, and she knew she had many more eventful days in store for her. Some coming far sooner than she would have liked. This coming weekend, she was to go to the Quidditch World Cup finals (Ireland vs Bulgaria) with the Targaryen-Starks, Margaery and Fred (though they had seats with Margaery’s family), and Gendry. Even though she honestly had little interest in Quidditch, she figured the spectacle of it all would be fun. And Petyr would be there, since as the Master of Coin he’d helped budget the whole event in conjunction with the Department of Magical Games and Sports. That in itself was a draw. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’d even be sitting in the same viewing box, as her Aunt Lyanna and Uncle Rhaegar were invited on special invitation by the Minister of Magic, since the Bulgarian Minister’s family was a huge fan of Rhaegar’s music, and Rhaegar was even set to perform during the halftime show. Of course, Sansa and Petyr were unlikely to be able to sit together, or even pay much attention to one another (at least outside their mental connection), but still.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In addition, school was to resume again in a few weeks. Her seventh year had already promised to be of greater import than her earlier schooling, since it was her final year at Hogwarts before she graduated and struck out on her own. But two other events occurring this year would make the year an extraordinary one to remember.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not only was the legendary Triwizard Tournament set to return again after decades, ensuring that it indeed would be a year of unparalleled excitement, but Petyr’s plans were going to be set into motion soon after the start of term. It was the perfect opportunity to introduce Muggle technology to the wizarding world, with students from two other schools staying at Hogwarts for the duration of the tournament, and the event itself providing ample reason for the students to use their newly purchased phones and their newfound access to the internet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sansa had been coached through using her own phone (given to her by Petyr last Christmas) in a myriad of ways this summer, and she knew that her fellow students would love being able to take pictures and record video of the Tournament, and to chat with one another via social media. With her help (she was, after all, The Wolf Who Lived), and that of her friends (both of whom were popular among the students at Hogwarts in their own right, and, while ignorant of Petyr’s overall agenda, had both already learned the basics from playing with Sansa’s phone and were eager to get their own), the trend would spread like fiendfyre. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, everyone would be skeptical at first, and wonder just how Petyr had managed to ensure that Muggle technology would even work around magic, but they’d soon see they had nothing to worry about. Petyr had worked hard to find a way for magic and Muggle technology to coexist, and so far the spell he had used to block magic from interfering with it was foolproof. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately, that skepticism wasn’t like to be their only obstacle. Those steeped in wizarding superiority (mainly purebloods, or wizards masquerading as such), who rejected anything to do with Muggles, were bound to raise objections. And the Minister of Magic, Tywin Lannister, was likely to be at the forefront. But Hogwarts wasn’t wholly subject to the Minister’s authority, and the Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, was free to do as he wished so long as it didn’t conflict with established laws. And since Petyr worked with Tywin, in more capacities than one (Master of Coin, Head of the Goblin Liaison Office, spy for the Ministry on none other than Hogwarts and Dumbledore himself, all vital roles), the Minister would begrudgingly allow it, so as not to lose such a crucial ally. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not to mention, both Sansa and Petyr suspected that Tywin initially wouldn’t consider the introduction a threat to his rule, and would persist in the belief that it would never take off. And by the time he realized otherwise, it would be far too late. The youth of the wizarding communities would be clamoring for phones and the internet, obsessed with both, dependent on both, not unlike the youth of the Muggle world, and it would spread from there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In introducing the technology to the students from other magical communities, during the Triwizard Tournament, Petyr was ensuring that his plans to introduce technology would flow beyond Great Britain, thus making it harder for any laws to be enacted banning it. If more than one magical community adopted Muggle technology, accepted it, opposition would be weakened considerably, as support would be strengthened in greater numbers and across a greater cross section of peoples, influential, and otherwise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sansa was nervous, yes, but also so very excited for what was to come. It was bound to be a year to remember, just as last year had been, but this time she hoped it would be remembered mainly for the highs, and not for the lows. Her sixth year had been her best yet, mainly because of Petyr, but also her worst, with the majority of the school convinced she was attacking other students, Margaery and Petyr being Petrified, and finally Sansa’s trip deep into the bowels of the school, where she’d met with Voldemort for the second time in her life, and nearly died at his hand. She’d triumphed in the end, but it still wasn’t an experience she’d like to revisit any time soon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even though she knew she would eventually.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just not yet, she hoped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, this was going to be her year. She was going to help Petyr with his plans, and further her own future in the process, making a new name for herself and stepping out of the shadow the name The Wolf Who Lived had cast over her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And after Hogwarts, when the time came, then she’d end the threat that Voldemort held over her life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’d play the game he’d begun, and she would win. And Petyr would be right there, by her side, through it all. </span>
