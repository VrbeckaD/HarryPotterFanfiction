</p><p>“Do you remember Oliver Wood?” your boyfriend Steve asked from behind the Daily Prophet.</p><p>Steve had been your partner for the last two years. Steve had a job at the local bank branch and you were a junior editor at Witch Weekly. Both having 9 to 5 jobs made living together pretty easy, and you’d gotten quickly adjusted to Steve’s routines. His morning one consisted of tea, marmalade toast, and the newspaper.</p><p>Not that your morning routine was too different from his. Instead of sitting at the kitchen table you preferred to have your breakfast on the couch, looking out the window and watching people begin their day. You were usually a bit groggy in the mornings as well, so you couldn’t trust your memory too much. “Um, was he the Scottish bloke? Quidditch Captain, few years above us?”</p><p>“Captain of <em>your</em> Quidditch team,” Steve corrected.</p><p>Whilst you had been sorted into Gryffindor, Steve had been a Hufflepuff. Suited him well, his happy, friendly, and patient attitude had been what had attracted you to him in the first place. You weren’t exactly the easiest witch to date, and your rash nature had landed you in trouble with McGonagall more times than you could count.</p><p>“He’s been announced as Puddlemere United’s new Keeper.”</p><p>You nodded your head, not really giving Steve your full attention. “Oh, good on him, then."</p><p>It was nice to hear that someone was doing well for themselves. Wood would’ve had to have been two or three years above you at Hogwarts and you couldn’t remember much about him that didn’t involve a broomstick.</p><p>To be perfectly honest you couldn’t really give a pigs arse about Quidditch. Steve (much like half of Great Britain) was obsessed with the sport and admitting your indifference to it could quite easily make you a Negative Nancy. Steve was without a doubt Puddlemere United’s biggest fan. When he’d moved into your apartment his obsession had been brought to your attention slowly with familiar jerseys and scarves sharing your closest and then one day after he did the washing you came home to find your pillow cases and bedspread changed to yellow and blue. Next, the mugs and coasters bearing the blue and yellow crest began sneaking into the kitchen.</p><p>Steve had been Quidditch obsessed at Hogwarts too, so this was no surprise. The two of you had graduated together in 1997, the year before the Battle of Hogwarts. You hadn’t dated during school, but your friendship had been on the flirty side. Steve was probably one of the only lads at Hogwarts that you hadn’t hexed for trying to put a move on you. You had remained friendly the next year, and had become reacquainted during the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998. After battling side by side in 1998 the two of you had found comfort in one another, and a relationship blossomed. You asked Steve to move to your hometown of Dorset which he had done, and here you were.</p><p>Although you recounted this all as if it had happened yesterday, it had in fact been two years since Harry Potter had conquered Voldemort.</p><p>You had to snap out of your trip down memory lane when Steve called your name. “Sorry, was miles away. What were ya saying?”</p><p>Steve shook his head, rolling his eyes. It was typical of you to wonder off in your thoughts. He still hadn’t gotten quite used to your daydreaming. “Tomorrow night Puddlemere’s playing. Are you joining me? Wouldn’t mind congratulating Wood either, if I saw him…”</p><p>Steve had a yearly membership so he could see every Puddlemere game. If it wasn’t torturous enough having to sit through the game then standing around the locker room afterwards waiting for the players would probably be the death of you.</p><p>However this was something Steve enjoyed and it was nice of him to ask you to join. “Of course," you replied. "Love to.”</p>
