    <p>Harry lays on the couch in full Aurors gear exhausted from the long train schedule. He was twenty-five and still forced to help the Aurors train like he was one of them. He looks up to his lovely husband next to him glancing through a potion magazine.<br/>
“Severus.”<br/>
“I don’t kiss men who smell like they haven’t bathed in years.” He looks down. “In fact.” He throws harry off the couch with a twist of his wand.<br/>
“Ow come on Severus I haven’t seen you all day.” He starts to pout. There kids where being babysat by Narcissa and Andromeda.  So, he knew they had the rest of the night to themselves. “Please just one kiss.” Severus groans from the puppy dog look harry gives him.<br/>
“Honestly if you had pulled that out years ago, I would have never tormented you.” Severus owned up to the fact that he was an asshole to Harry until his sixth year and even apologies.<br/>
“If I had then you would have been immune to it by the time I proposed.” He kisses Severus on the cheek and leaves to take a bath.<br/>
“As if I would have said no when you asked.” He leans back and goes back to his magazine. He knew just how his husband like to unwind when he gets back from those train sessions and he had everything planned. Their five little monsters won’t be back until noon tomorrow. Harry’s favorite dish was in the stove and know all he had to do was wait. “Honestly I have no idea why they even make him participate. He going to school to be an Alchemy Professor.” He mumbled under his breath noticing the Floo coming to life.<br/>
“Hello, Albus.” He didn’t even take his eye off the potion magazine. In fact, he made sure to keep them there.<br/>
“Hello Severus, is Harry around I need to speak with him?” He started to tap his foot and Severus knew after spending over a decade working for the man that that wasn’t a good sign. Abandoning the potion magazine, he glanced at Albus for the first time.<br/>
“Albus what did you do.” He silently sent a house elf to fetch Harry and him some tea. The elf popped back placing the British black tea in front of him.<br/>
“Now Severus I need to speak with Harry. It is important.”<br/>
“Oh, you mean important like that time you got him in engaged to Ginevra Weasley.” He was still sore about that. Harry was nineteen and they had been public dating at the time when Albus sprung the news.<br/>
“Now my boy that was for the greater good. Harry needed heirs and Ginny was the ideal candidate.” He took a seat across from Severus not wanting to make the same mistake as last time.<br/>
“How was she the ideal candidate. I had caught that little hussy with multiple boys threw out her Hogwarts years and don’t tell me to go easy on her. Everyone including the other Gryffindors called her easy breezy Weasley.” He was and still is furious of the fact that Harry had to father three children with her because of the absolute contract she was in their lives until she wanted to leave. Thanks to the goblins Harry wouldn’t be her little slave. “And to remind me of the contract.” Albus wisely shut up at hearing the contract.<br/>
“Well, this is about Ginny.” Harry groaned from the doorway. He stepped in and glared tiredly at the headmaster.<br/>
“What does she want now. I mean she has a house. She can see the kid whenever she wants. She doesn’t even work anymore so I’m paying for her now.” He was tired of the annoying little girl that refused to grow up.<br/>
“Well, she wants another child you see.”<br/>
“No,” Severus said it so quickly Harry almost missed it. “and if she wants one, she can come to ask him in person, but the answer will still be a hell no.”<br/>
“Well, you have your answer headmaster know you can leave.” Harry stands to escort him or throw him to the floo.<br/>
“There is something else and I am sure you are going to be so happy Harry.” Severus catches the twinkling in Albus’s eyes. “Your parents are alive.” He waits for the reaction of joy, but it never came.<br/>
“So?” Albus was confused.<br/>
“Harry these are your parents don’t you want to see them or at least meet them.”<br/>
“Headmaster you seem to have forgotten that I am a grown man. If my parents.” He throws up quotation marks. “Want to see me that I will see them at the ministry. Now goodbye.” He pushed the old man into the floo why tinny through the floo dust sending the old man back to his office. The small elf bowed and disappeared.<br/>
“Honestly that man never gives up on his twisted plans.” Harry looks to Severus. “You think he is for real.”<br/>
“I don’t know but I will soon and for now let’s relax. I made your favorite.” Harry leans down to kiss him and picks him up.<br/>
“Yummy a submissive Severus.” Severus shoots off a stinging hex, but Harry isn’t giving up yet. “Aw come on it's my birthday.” Severus freezes<br/>
“Fine but after Dinner.” He is placed of his feet as Harry rushes into the kitchen. “I am so glad I asked those two to watch them till noon.” He enters the kitchen knowing that he won’t be sleeping very much that night.</p>
