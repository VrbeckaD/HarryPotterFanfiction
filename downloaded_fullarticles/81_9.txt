I shoved it and grunted. I leant against it panting. It would not move.</p><p>        "Blasted-- trunk!" I yelled and kicked it. It stayed completely stationary. I sighed.</p><p>"Need some help?" I looked 'round. There stood two boys, one in a leather jacket and his hands in his pockets. He had black hair that draped over his face. He blew it out of the way like he'd done it a hundred times and winked at me. The other boy had black hair also, but it was sticking all over the place in amazing disarray. He ran his fingers through it making it even worse. He grinned and pushed up the glasses on his nose. The two looked like trouble.</p><p>        "Please!" I said and they stepped into the train and lugged my trunk the rest of the way in. The second boy offered me his hand and he helped me up. "Thanks," I said I brushed my own hair out of my eyes. I saw them look at my eyes. My eyes were sort of a talking point, they were bright green. An unnatural green. My mother always said they looked beautiful with my long brown hair before she... well, that doesn't matter.</p><p>                "No problem. Would you like us to carry it to your compartment?" The first one said smoothly.</p><p>        "Um, well I don't have a compartment yet."</p><p>They grinned.</p><p>"Well, you can sit with us then!" The second one said. Instead of picking up my trunk he pulled out his wand. "Locomotor trunk." He said. My trunk rose into the air a few inches and he grinned mischievously. </p><p>                "Sit down!" He said holding out his hand once more. I didn't take it but I sat on the trunk and tucked my legs under me as if I did this all the time. He shrugged at the first boy, then he raised his wand and led my trunk to the back of the train.</p><p>"What's your name?" The first one asked.</p><p>        "Iris Brooks. I'm going into the second year. Some things... came up last year so I couldn't go, but Dumbledore said I could come this year." My insides squirmed.</p><p>"Brilliant! The name's Sirius Black. The second year too, if you're wondering. We both are." he said pointing at the second boy.</p><p>                "I'm James. James Potter. Pleased to meet you." He said and he held out his hand again as if to shake it.</p><p>        "What is up with you and holding my hand? If you're flirting with me you might want to be warned, I'm not flirted with easily." I said an eyebrow raised. Sirius bumped shoulders with James and he grinned at him as James turned a light shade of pink.</p><p>                "Might be," he said and looked at me as if I was a challenge he was trying to beat. "I'll bet I could." He winked.</p><p>"Doubt it. I could do it much better, than him." Sirius whispered just loud enough for James to hear.</p><p>                "You want to go?" James said. He grabbed my hand this time and proceeded to kiss it multiple times. I covered my face with my one free hand.</p><p>        "Good lord," I said exhausted. I knew these guys were trouble. Unfortunately, I was stuck with them for the moment.</p><p>Sirius put his arm around me and sat on the trunk next to me. He tickled my side. I let out a reluctant giggle and shoved his hand away and felt my face turn a deep shade of scarlet. I looked straight ahead as they continued to have flirting contests as I remained stoically in place.</p><p>        All at once I saw a figure in the hall in front of us.</p><p>        The boys were so involved in their contest that only I noticed the figure. I launched myself off the trunk, leant against it to make it touch the ground again and began inspecting my nails nonchalantly. The boys looked at me confused.</p><p>        "Well, well, well. <em>Potter. Black.</em> Not a surprise to see you two using magic to impress a girl now is it? I'll have to report you." The figure stepped out into better light and I saw that he had sleek blond hair and an annoyingly superior smirk. He had a pale pointed face and glared at the boys. Behind him were two others, a girl with dark lids and another boy with disgusting oily hair.</p><p>                "Malfoy. Black. <em>Snivellus. </em>Nice to see you here." James said stiffly. "Now if you don't mind we'd like to get to our compartment." Both sides as if they were having a face off. They all glared at each other. I saw James whisper something and Sirius put his hand in his pocket ready to draw something out. Malfoy evidently saw and drew his wand. The others did the same. James had his wand pointed right directly at the oily hair's face.</p><p>        "Petrificus tota--!"</p><p>        I waved my own wand silently and blocked his curse without saying a thing. Malfoy looked at his wand angrily.</p><p>        "<em>Furnuncu--!" </em>He yelled again and I blocked it nonverbally. He looked at me and I thought he was going to explode. "You! Stop it! Expelli--!" I blocked him again. "Why you little...!" He strode towards me his hands out like he was going to choke me.</p><p>                "Shove off!" James said and Sirius and he shoved him out of the way. I was fully standing now my arms crossed over my chest. The boys grabbed my trunk and sped past them. I followed but not before I whispered to Malfoy</p><p>        "Don't flourish your wand so much. It gives the advantage to the other person because they know what you're going to do." He looked at me mutinously. I smirked and shoved past him and caught up the James and Sirius. They both turned to throw more spells at them but I grabbed their hands and redirected them forward. They both looked at me weirdly.</p><p>        "What?" I asked them unfolding my arms.</p><p>                "What? You don't stop us if we want to curse someone."</p><p>        "Well, guess what, <em>Potter</em>? I'm new so I don't know these things. Plus, I quite frankly don't care. In case you didn't notice, I just saved your arses out there so zip your mouths." </p><p>        They still looked at me.</p><p>"Speaking of which, that was bloody brilliant!" Sirius spoke. "How do you know nonverbal spells already? They don't teach that until the sixth year."</p><p>        "Oh. Books. Just books. I read them so many times I just sort of knew how to do it." I shrugged. "It's not that big of a deal."</p><p>                "Not that big of a deal?! Did you see his face?! It was amazing! You are going to be a fantastic marauder."</p><p>        "A what?" I asked.</p><p>"Tell you about it later," Sirius said. A few more steps and they opened the door to a compartment that had their luggage already in it. They helped me shove my trunk under the seat and took their spots on the opposite side of my seat, Sirius leaning against the wall and James fiddling with his wand, spinning it in a circle.</p><p>        "So why were those guys so angry with you? Are they like your arch nemesis'?" I said pulling out a book and began to read, leaning against the side of the wall curling my feet.</p><p>"You could say that," Sirius said darkly.</p><p>                "They're in Slytherin," James said as if that explained everything.</p><p>        "So?" I said.</p><p>                "Oh no," James said covering his eyes. "She's just like Lily."</p><p>"Or Remus, see? She's already got a book out." Sirius nodded at me.</p><p>        "Who?" I asked but the compartment door slid open and in walked a sandy blond boy, his nose in a book. He was tall and spoke without looking up.</p><p>                        "I heard you two stirred up some trouble with the Slytherins already," he said.</p><p>                "Nah, that was all her," James said grinning.</p><p>                        "Who?" The boy said looking up. I looked up at him smiled and went back to my book. He stared at me, then glared at the other two boys in warning. "Well, hello." He said. "What's your name?"</p><p>        "Iris Brooks," I said.</p><p>                        "Wonderful. Is there any room in here?" He asked looking around. I noticed he had scars lacing his cheek, which I thought was odd but not unnatural. I shrugged it off.</p><p>"Yes, there is," Sirius said and he moved over and sat by me draping an arm around me and tickling me again. "I'll sit by beautiful here."</p><p>        "Oh no, you won't," I said kicking him. "Remus seems much more tolerable than you two." Sirius rubbed his side and moved back to where he had been sitting before. Remus grinned and sat by me and opened his book too.</p><p>"Oh look at them, they're both sitting the same way," Sirius said in a stage whisper.</p><p>                "Remus always gets the girls," James whispered back.</p><p>"She's got to be a Ravenclaw."</p><p>                "Nah she's too standoffish to be a Ravenclaw."</p><p>"Aren't Ravenclaws standoff-ish?"</p><p>                "Not like her, they aren't."</p><p>I looked at Remus from over the top of my book. He was grinning. I raised an eyebrow back, fighting not to laugh.</p><p>"She could be in Slytherin, she was all about making herself look better than those guys."</p><p>                "NO. No. She is not going to be in Slytherin, we already talked about this. If we find a cute girl we tuck her under our wing and make sure she isn't in Slytherin.</p><p>"Alright, Hufflepuff then."</p><p>        "What if," I said closing my book with a snap. "You shut up so I can <em>read.</em>" I opened my book again. "Also not Hufflepuff because I'm extremely lazy. But they are cool so don't hold it against them. <em>Hufflepuff. </em>I ask you..."</p><p>        I looked over and saw them both smiling at me with identical mischievous grins.</p><p>"Gryffindor, definitely," Sirius said and James nodded. I shrunk down into my book again, trying hard to hide my smile.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> "Aaaand I win!" Sirius whooped.</p><p>                "Oh, shut up," James said grumpily. "I would've won if Remus hadn't been giving me terrible advice,"</p><p>                        "Hey, I didn't say take it." Remus shrugged, grinning.</p><p>        "That was intense," I shook my head. "You had him on the ropes for a while,"</p><p>They had been playing gobstones for the past half hour.</p><p>                "I played the best, though, didn't I Love?" James asked me.</p><p>        "No comment," I said. "And don't call me Love, Potter"</p><p>                "Ah, you'll get used to me," He grinned. "Now, who wants to place bets on Iris' house?"</p><p>James bet on Gryffindor. Sirius bet on Slytherin just to spite James. Remus thought for a while and finally went with either Ravenclaw or Gryffindor.</p><p>                "You can't bet on two!" James said indignantly.</p><p>                        "And why not? I'm at perfect liberty to bet on multiple houses," Remus said blatantly.</p><p>                "But it gives you a fifty-fifty shot!"</p><p>                        "Should'a thought of that before you bet," Remus said slyly.</p><p>        I shook my head.</p><p>        "Don't we need to change into our robes? We must be getting close to Hogwarts by now," I asked.</p><p>                        "Yeah," Remus said checking his watch.</p><p>        The girls' uniform consisted of a skirt matching the colour of your house, a grey sweater, a tie matching the colours of your house, black robes with inside cloth the colour of your house, and shoes of your choosing. I wore red converse.<br/> Of course, since I hadn't been sorted yet, I just wore plain grey and black.</p><p>                "You're looking stunning in your uniform, Love. It'd look better in red, though..." James flirted.</p><p>        "You might want to let all the hot air in your head escape for once, Potter, instead of leaving it in. It makes you look a bit like a blundering idiot sometimes," I snipped.</p><p>                "Ouch, Love,"</p><p>        "I'm not your love,"</p><p>                "Whatever you say, Love,"</p><p>        "Goodness gracious," I said shaking my head. He attempted to catch my hand but I pinched his arm.</p><p>                        "We're here," Remus announced, looking out the window. Hogwarts loomed in the darkness. Lights glistened in the windows and reflected off a black lake. The forest set the scene. It was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen.</p><p>        The train slowly crept to a stop. Someone speaking was heard throughout the train;</p><p>"PLEASE LEAVE YOUR BELONGINGS ON THE TRAIN. THEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO YOUR DORMITORIES SHORTLY."</p><p>        "Wonderful," I said shutting my book. "Shall we?" I asked.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>         "We have a new student joining us this year." Professor McGonagall stood before the entire school beside a stool with a hat atop it. "She was unable to attend the year before. Please welcome Iris Brooks." There was a smattering of applause. My friends in the crowds cheered and whooped.</p><p>"C'mon Brooks! I need those ten galleons!" Sirius called.</p><p>                "Nonsense! Make me proud, Brooks!" James exclaimed.</p><p>        "Do yourself a favour, Potter, and shut up," I called back. Professor McGonagall looked at me reprovingly. "Sorry, Professor. It needed to be done," She almost smiled but then turned back to the laughing crowd.</p><p>        "Quiet!" She called. "Quiet!" The room silenced. She gestured to the stool.</p><p>I sat. My fingers gripped the edge of the seat. My knuckles were white. I closed my eyes as the hat fell over my head. I let out a breath.</p><p>"Nervous, are you?" The sorting hat said to me.</p><p>        "A little," I said in my mind. "More like I've been waiting for this for years. I never thought it would happen."</p><p>"Hm..." It paused and the seconds ticked by. It grumbled. I held my breath. "How do you feel about Slytherin?" it asked. I considered the question.</p><p>        "Well... I'd be okay with it if you said I should go. I just... have a bad connection with Slytherin."</p><p>"Yes... I see that...." The sorting hat hmm-ed. "You'd also do very well in Gryffindor."</p><p>        "I wouldn't mind going there," This was beginning to take a while. "A lot of my friends are in that house. At least, I think they're my friends," I said as an afterthought.</p><p>"But are you suited for it? That is the question..." The sorting hat went silent for a while. "To be honest, child. I have never been this stumped about a student. Of course, I could let you decide..." The sorting hat said to itself.</p><p>        "I <em>would</em> like Gryffindor," I said.</p><p>"Gryffindor...The thing is, child, you are so alike the original Salazar Slytherin it's almost disturbing. I see cunning and ambition and determination and resourcefulness. You are the embodiment of what Salazar Slytherin wanted in a student. However, I could say the same for Gryffindor. You're brave and honest-minded and daring and reckless... this is difficult..."</p><p>        "I want Gryffindor," I said plainly.</p><p>"Alright. If that is what you truly wish..."</p><p>        "It is,"</p><p>"Then it'll have to be GRYFFINDOR!" The sorting hat screamed. I heard large yells. Professor McGonagall pulled the hat off my head, but in the last second, the sorting hat said something. Something I'll never forget;</p><p>"Peculiar child..."</p>
