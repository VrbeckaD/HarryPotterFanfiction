Only it's miserable flames is lighting up the room. Man is sitting alone on the couch beside the fireplace. Sirius is dressed in home gown and slippers. His head is bowed down to his knees. Hair is hanging down covering his whole face. Hands are lowered almost touching the floor. In the right hand he's holding a lit up cigarette, in the left a mirror. An empty bottle is laying by the couch and one more half full bottle of alcohol is standing beside.

Loser! Disgrace! Traitor! Disappointment! Scum! </em>She’s dead, but she’s still here, her voice inside his head, reminding him of things he knows already. She’s been dead for years apparently, but she’s still there, her portrait sneering at him, her eyes following him no matter where he goes, screaming obscenities at him, despite his attempts to blast it into hell and lock it behind thick curtains. Somehow she still manages to free herself and shout at the top of her lungs, did he subconsciously not fully close the curtains, because he deserves to hear this, because he deserves to be treated badly, deserves to be called every name under the sun? He knows he does. Maybe she was right all along. He is a disaster.</p><p>“There’s no need to tell me, I know what I am, Mother,” he says, his voice so full of hate and bitterness. And tired. So tired.</p><p>He cannot sleep.</p><p>“Don’t you tell me what to do, you disgraceful boy! How dare you show your face in here again after all these years? This house is not yours, you are not a Black, get out! Leave my house immediately! Filth!”</p><p>“Shut up, Walburga,” he says wearily, draining the remains of a double firewhisky and wincing as it hits the back of his throat, bringing tears to his eyes.</p><p>The firewhisky, not his Mother. Never his Mother.</p><p>“You disgraced us and ran away to live with those hideous blood-traitors! Where are they now, those Potters?” Walburga’s portrait says the name with pure hatred, her eyes taking on a wild, malevolent triumph. “Did they disown you too? Got sick of your abhorrent behaviour? Rejected you too?”</p><p>When she mentions that name, his mouth goes dry and he thinks he might be sick. He’s holding onto the tumbler so tightly it might shatter in his hands any second. He looks down at the ground. Potters… images of two smiling, kind figures, Mia Potter holding out her hands as though to hug him and Monty Potter grinning at him. The best people he ever met. Dead. Worse, he failed to protect their son, his brother, his family. He closes his eyes and shivers, sees himself entering Godric’s Hollow, as though watching a muggle film, sees James’ body on the ground in front of the stairs, Lily’s crumpled form in front of the –</p><p>“Fuck off!” he whispers hoarsely.</p><p>How many times had he replayed that scene throughout the years in Azkaban? It hasn’t changed, still crisp and vivid like it was the day it happened. A weight settles on his chest, as heavy as a casket.</p><p>It was his fault. He failed. He didn’t save them. It was his idea to swap secret keeper with-</p><p>An inhuman sound escapes his lips and he bows his head lower. This is what regret and anguish and shame sound like, he thinks. He can’t bear to think of this now. He can’t stand it.</p><p>“I’m right, am I not? Blood traitor! Stain of dishonour!” the portrait screams again.</p><p>His mother always succeeded in provoking him, as she meant to. His eyes flicker to the stairs, widening with fear, as he hears his Father’s heavy tread descending, purposeful and relentless. He grabs his wand and stands to face him, his breathing harsh and laboured. His hand shakes. What curse will Father throw at him this time? What-</p><p>He’s dead. Orion is dead, he reminds himself. He’s imagining things. Merlin, being in this place is making him go insane. Why did he agree to come here?</p><p>“Goodbye Mother, I might remind you you’re dead, been dead for years. Come to think of it, you’ve been dead as far back as I can remember. Hope eternity is treating you fairly,” he hisses through gritted teeth, as he walks away, ignoring her shrieks.</p><p>He smiles grimly. She never did like being ignored.</p><p>He sits down in the Green Room, beside the miserly fire, heavily, places the near-empty bottle of vintage firewhisky on the ground, a discarded earlier one lies there, forgotten. Like him. The fire is miserable, a couple of damp logs hiss pathetically, a few sparks flutter, then go out. It’s cold. He doesn’t try to use a heating charm.</p><p>He shivers. The cold reminds him of Azkaban. If he sleeps, he is there, and he can’t and won’t go back.</p><p>The nights are lonely in Grimmauld Place. He cannot sleep.</p><p>He supposes he was right, offering to leave this house at the disposal of the Order. What else can he offer? He’s useless and a burden to his friends, unable to join them on missions when every single fibre of his being screams at him to fight, revenge for his dead brother, his loved like a sister, his adored Godson left orphan. Anything not to be cooped up in here with his Mother and with his thoughts.</p><p>He cannot bear to think of Regulus, yet every day he walks into and out of his bedroom and passes his little brother’s room. The little Death-Eater. Who he also failed to save. It is empty now.</p><p>“It’s to help Harry,” he whispers to himself. “Harry.”</p><p>He loves that boy with a burning, protective fire so strong it surprises even him. It’s the only thing keeping him here, making him stay. Harry, and Remus. He can hardly say his name without feeling a pain in his chest. How could he ever have suspected Moony of being the spy? He can see why Remus would have believed he was the traitor (even though his heart breaks every time he thinks about that). Remus was nothing but loyal, never once let him down, yet he still suspected him of betrayal. Who is he to feel resentment or anguish if his ex-lover thought the same thing?</p><p>Remus and he have not really spoken properly, not in a long time. They hugged desperately, so tightly he thought he might burst with gladness, in the Shrieking Shack. But afterwards? They find it hard to talk. He catches Remus looking at him. Sometimes he’s sure those looks are more than pity. But he pushes those thoughts, wishes, away. He cannot hope that Remus would ever have him back. How do you begin to speak, to heal from this? He tried to apologise to Remus, numerous times, but his friend won’t hear it, teetering between shouting at him or crying, sometimes grabbing him by the shoulders and shaking him, the only times they’ve touched.</p><p>“It’s not your fault, Pads!” he says, unable to speak coherently, as though his voice is failing him. “I should never have believed Dumbledore, anyone, I should never…”</p><p>But he knows it is.</p><p>Dumbledore was a bastard though. Still is. But he’s their best weapon in the fight to protect Harry. He’ll do anything for Harry. He didn’t mind living on rats, vermin, got a sort of morbid joy out of killing them, shaking them viciously in his mouth, imagining Pettigrew in his grasp, the biggest bastard. They couldn’t kill him, not with Harry looking at them, the spitting image of Prongs, telling them his Father would not have approved. Harry watching him with Lily’s vivid eyes, taking his breath away. It wouldn’t bring them back.</p><p>He looks down at the precious mirror in his hand. In case Harry needs him. In case he calls. He desperately wants to talk to him. But he won’t risk contacting the boy. Harry is busy. He doesn’t want to burden him. He always holds it close though. Ready if he’s needed. He’d go to hell and back for him.</p><p>A lit cigarette between his fingers, ash falls onto the floor. A log breaks and crackles, then goes quiet. Nobody is there.</p><p>The nights are lonely in Grimmauld Place. And cold. He cannot sleep.</p><p>He looks at the mirror and he hears Prongs laughing, calling his name. Too painful still, those happy memories. Does Pettigrew ever think about their time in Hogwarts? Like brothers? The three of them becoming Animagi for Remus, James never believed that one of his friends could have been the spy.</p><p>“I miss you, Prongs,” he says quietly.</p><p>He misses Remus too, but he won’t go near him now, he doesn’t deserve him.</p><p>He holds onto the mirror tightly, this one thing he can do for his Godson. If he could die to save him, at least he could face them, when he meets Harry’s parents again. As things stand, he’s scared of dying, scared at the thought of what they’ll say to him, how they might look at him. He shivers violently. He saw them in his cell, Mia and Monty Potter, James and Lily, when he was in Azkaban. It wasn’t real, he knows that now, but he’s still haunted by it.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” he whispers.</p><p>He bows his head down low, disgusted by his self-pity. He holds the mirror close, it’s curved sides somehow comforting. On stand-by.</p><p>When he’s completely exhausted, he’ll turn into Padfoot and try to sleep fitfully, try not to dream, a guard dog separated from his family. A guard dog that let the enemy in.</p><p>“I’m so sorry.”</p>
