    <p>Of all the places that Harry could currently be, this wouldn’t have been his first choice: a gathering in an expensive, and absurdly private house, with the most elite and influential men and women currently navigating the nebulous corridors of wizarding politics. To be perfectly honest, Harry wasn’t entirely sure what he was even doing here. It wasn’t as though he’d dedicated his entire existence to playing that political game as the others had, instead, his niche was… more altruistic. Justice was, after all, a far less corruptible entity than the murky haze of politics.</p>
<p>But even so, justice was not as black and white as it had used to be, and with every shade of grey that slid into it, his life became a fraction more complicated, and his potential influence increased twofold, which was probably the reason why he was here. All because Harry himself had unintentionally, and only really on a technicality, become one of the elites; one of those special people with money to their name and influence in their fingertips. For him, the invitation was likely extended due to his name, but his rapid ascension through the Aurors probably cemented it; he was, after all, the <em>natural</em> successor to the leadership. </p>
<p>Sometimes it felt like he was the only one who cared for justice these days. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite these connections, Harry was rarely invited to these gatherings—he deigned to call them parties because that implied, they would be enjoyable, and they weren’t—mostly because his politics differed so irreconcilably with the other people who crowded these rooms. The rich and influential had never been to Harry’s taste, but when they were all so pathetically sycophantic, then they were utterly unbearable because even the most blatant and unpleasable critic became a champion fawner in <em>his</em> presence. </p>
<p><em>Tom Riddle</em>. The man who now sat opposite him looking just as delectable as the food, in a dark, molten-coloured suit, and a brilliant smile. Harry had been watching him with infinite suspicion as he spun his way into power. It had taken him a while, but now that he was there—at the top of the ridge, as it were—Riddle was enjoying every second of it; that much was obvious to even those who were completely untrained in the intricacies of espionage. Also enjoying it were those ‘friends’ of his who’d invested so much in him, Harry didn’t care to know all of them, or, even maintain a standard of politeness beyond mere courtesy. But that didn’t make them disappear. </p>
<p>A selection of Riddle’s favourites was here tonight, milling around the rooms and chattering, though the only three Harry could identify with any certainty were Lestrange, Malfoy and Rosier who were always the ones closest to the Riddle. They were the ones with too much money and a sense of superiority because of it; always the first to smile at Riddle and the last to leave. But although they were caught in Riddle’s orbit, and being sucked closer to the centre every day, they were each influential in their own right. They didn’t <em>need</em> him, not like he needed them.</p>
<p>But still, each of their influences extended as far as the parameters of the law, and not an inch further, Harry singlehandedly made sure of that. </p>
<p>Depressingly, though, the parameters of the law had no jurisdiction on the declining of dinner invitations; hence Harry was here, sitting in the dining room that was swathed in crimson shadows. The lights that hung above them casting out a soft gold glow that slid off the walls and coated everything it touched in a sangria shade. More than once, Harry had looked down at his hand, turning it over, and examining it from back to palm; the light followed every movement as though it were a sentient creature, and as a result, his hands looked like they were smeared with blood. </p>
<p>It wasn’t necessarily a pleasant room, but it was a powerful one. The high windows with the velvet curtains drawn, and the creaking floorboards, and all that dark furniture carefully spaced out in the centre of the room, leant itself to an old-fashioned feel, back when single politicians and their interests monopolised the political landscape. It was an era Harry suspected Riddle was aiming to return to, for his own benefit, of course. </p>
<p>Not that that observation helped to answer the current question of why Riddle would even want him here in the first place, after all, they had barely exchanged any words beyond mere pleasantries, and Harry would not have considered them even colleagues, given they disagreed on how exactly jurisdiction of concepts such as justice should be properly distributed. But, having said that, Harry, however much he disliked the rest of them, would never pass up an opportunity to see Riddle—to observe him—especially in his <em>natural</em> habitat, away from all the cameras, and the people, and the dissenters. </p>
<p>Though the curiosity Harry felt did nothing to soothe the tugging in his stomach, because Riddle bringing the rich and influential together, felt less like a coming together of supposedly like-minded individuals, and more like the final noose being tightened around his neck. Quite possibly this the ringing of the death-knell. Indeed, Harry could feel <em>something</em> in the air; something choking and apprehensive was ingrained into the oxygen, and it hung between the layers of the paint and was stitched through every inch of the carpets. </p>
<p>There was something sinister in these walls and it all linked back to Riddle, who sat like a smiling spider at the centre of it all. </p>
<p>Fortunately, their party was currently consisting of just ten, which was a large enough gathering to avoid those that one might dislike, whilst, unfortunately, being a fraction too small to blend into the crowd entirely, until one’s existence had been blurred out of all memories. At least though, Harry could avoid Riddle, and as were seated, he was probably as far away from Riddle as he could physically be. For they were sitting at a long table; four people down the left, and four down the right, Riddle at the head and Harry at the tail, as it were, creating a decent distance between them. Far enough away to watch without being easily noticed, though Riddle still managed to catch his gaze. </p>
<p>Those black eyes watched him for long enough for it to become uncomfortable, and Harry shifted his seat, moving the legs forward a couple of inches and repositioning himself. He still didn’t want to be here. After all, Riddle’s intentions were rarely honourable, and this entire set-up felt distinctly sinister, as though everyone was part of the secret except him. They all probably thought he didn’t see the subtle glances between them, and the smiles that were just a tad too friendly; they probably thought he didn’t notice the way they all deferred to Riddle on matters of importance and waited for his approval on each decision.   </p>
<p>But Harry <em>did</em> see. </p>
<p>He saw everything they did; how all of them were nothing but puppets strung up with Riddle’s will, played for fools and thrown away when they were bled dry. Harry had met several ‘stepping-stones,’ those people that were abandoned as soon as their usefulness ran out, and none of them had pleasant endings. But still, people flocked to Riddle like he was an ancient prophet or an angel, and it made Harry think that people with that much charisma shouldn’t be allowed to have power as well; it made them dangerous, and Harry’s life was already preoccupied with keeping track of dangerous men. </p>
<p>Needless to say, really, Riddle was at the top of his unofficial wanted list—unofficial because if anyone found out that the Minister for Magic was his most suspect man in England, there would be a lot of uncomfortable questions to be answered, especially given that Harry had almost no evidence that could stand up in a trial or even an inquest. All because Riddle wasn’t a fool; he hadn’t let himself be caught yet and Harry doubted he would start now.</p>
<p>And, unless he made a mistake, Riddle <em>wouldn’t</em> be caught, not when he slunk through the shadows like the most subtle of snakes. Interchanging money, and secrets, and lives like they were children’s trading cards, and that was just his politics; Harry preferred not to think of the things that he’d witnessed, and the rest that he’d pieced together over the last few years. The image was still half-finished, and there were strategic gaps, some of which Harry doubted he’d ever fill, and would surely become an obsession if he let them. </p>
<p>But he knew <em>enough</em>.</p>
<p>Enough that looking across the table’s spread made him sick. </p>
<p>It wasn’t necessarily the arrangements of dishes themselves, for they all looked delectable; bowls and platters and other dishes all in the same charcoal colour of the plates, and all containing some, artful but still… violent composition of the food. Perhaps, Harry was being paranoid but there just appeared to be something so <em>brutal</em> in the arrangements of glazed vegetables, whose veneers glowed red, and in the sharp, precise lines of the rice, shaped in curious formations. Even the salads that looked so outwardly fresh, and were coloured with deep, healthy greens and purples, appeared to make unnatural shadows and twisted in deformed ways. </p>
<p>Even so, each dish was intimately constructed and devastatingly beautiful as a result. Although he was no connoisseur, Harry had sat through enough of these formal dinners by now to know that food could either be beautiful on individual plates or as a centrepiece, and it all depended on the image that the host wished to delivery. Individual plates emphasised a personal, and indeed rather intimate touch to food preparation, as each person were treated as though they were the only one to ever eat the dish. In contrast, meals, such as this one, that was beautiful on the table, were a demonstration—a show even—of capability by the chef, and good taste in the host. </p>
<p>So too, could such arrangements show other things. Maybe, Harry was reading too much into the careful arrangement of plants, from the small, black, flowers that were artfully speckled across the plates. Every petal laid for its contrast: black flowers against red meat, or rich purple against crisp gold, and deep red flowers in full bloom placed throughout the salad. And each contrast was more severe than the last, harsher, callous even, and Harry couldn’t help but feel faintly <em>unnerved</em> by the perfection of it all. </p>
<p>The feeling wasn’t helped by the fact he didn’t really recognise any of the dishes, or <em>anything</em> on the table really. Even the sauces were uncommon at best, and each in dubious colours; one murky and green that smelled garden-fresh with an undertone of—maybe—mint, that was left behind from the starter, another, that had been brought out especially, was dark and red, glistening like wine and just as aromatic, but in a much headier way that made Harry’s mouth water despite himself. Some of the guests had already poured that one, and it ran over their plates and onto their food, sliding into the contours of the meat until everything was bathed in bloody red. The final sauce that sat some distance from Harry was almost black and ran as thick as tar, Harry did not know the ingredients, and he didn’t want to, for it was like looking at a void. </p>
<p>Instead, he took a sip of his water; revelling in the cool, clarity of it, though it too was coated with a red sheen. </p>
<p>Of course, as much as Harry tried to ignore the fact, there was also a centrepiece to this meal, one he had neglected to look at yet. The meat, placed on a raised structure right in the middle of the table as though it were on a pedestal, was the showpiece of this meal. Even from this distance, it was obvious that the meat was rare, almost uncomfortably so, and cut thick. The colour of it was red at the centre and oozing, and the crust, though brown, was inlaid with flecks of edible gold; such presentation was so close to the line of ostentatious, but despite his disgust, Harry could never bring himself to condemn something so beautiful. </p>
<p>Once again the brutal contrast between the dark, sticky, rind and the rareness of the meat, all combined with the deep blush and garnet tones of the blood oranges it had been cooked with, was as beautiful as it was brutal, and it left his insides swirling and tugging until he shifted a little in his chair and tore his eyes away from what could have been the sight of a bloody battleground.</p>
<p>After all, that meat was anything but beautiful; despite its apparent appetising appearance, there was something <em>monstrous</em> marbled through the flesh, and <em>that</em> was its origin. Human. Human meat. That thing, dusted in gold and lying in the middle of the table, was all that was left of a human being and it was <em>sickening</em> to think about for longer than a few moments. The very thought of <em>consuming</em> another human being sat wrong in Harry’s stomach, and in the every fibre of his being, just as it should because he was a morally decent person.</p>
<p>Riddle was not. </p>
<p>Of course, Harry couldn’t be one hundred per cent sure that Riddle would be audacious enough to serve his guests something so morally reprehensible, but nor could he be sure that each of those sitting around this table was not entirely aware of what they were eating; perhaps even <em>who</em>. It was completely, and horrifically, conceivable that they were not just passively aware, but actively involved in the consumption of other people. </p>
<p>He couldn’t prove it though. Riddle would undoubtedly catch him if he were to take a sample without permission, and everything else was so meticulously constructed that there was no evidence at all; just a heaviness pooling in the base of his stomach, and scratchy dryness settling like sawdust in his throat. And so, Harry was forced to sit here, whilst the last true indecency sat less than three feet away, and the man who thought himself a god for having such control over the lives of men and women, sat there smiling, framed by black and believing he was untouchable.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, as Harry watched someone carve the meat, slowly and carefully, giving the moment far too much unintentional weight, he felt Riddle’s eyes lingering on him more and more. At first, it was no more than a gentle pressure, but it grew until Harry had to look up, and he was greeted with a contemplative gaze that was heavy and heated in ways he couldn’t quite describe, but nonetheless made his stomach curl itself up like a fern in the rain. Without any intention on his part, Harry's stomach twisted and spiralled back in on itself, flipping itself over like a leaf caught in the wind, until he felt airy and light, despite the fact Riddle’s eyes should have made him, heady, and physically sick. In fact, every part of that man should repulse him, and it did, in a moral way, but at the same time, Harry wasn’t stupid, and nor was he blind. </p>
<p>Riddle was an undeniably attractive man. But it wasn’t the light, crisp type of attractiveness that one would associate with a pale dawn, rather, Riddle’s brand handsome was slinking and serpentine and insidious, like a snaking sliding through the grass, or rich contaminated soil that poisoned everything that grew in it. It was infused into his character and his every action, not to mention his face was works of classical architecture, made up with fine lines and perfect arches. Simply put, he was so beautiful on the outside, but so corrupted on the inside as though a rot had got to his core, and it was a hypnotic combination; one that filled Harry with equal parts attraction and revulsion.</p>
<p>After all, how could one trust a man who was always surrounded by a contagious fog of corruption; this indeterminable sensation that coiled itself around Harry’s fingers and burned the back of his throat. Sometimes, Harry wondered if the other members of their current congregation saw what he was, and merely pretended not to, or whether they were so blinded by Riddle’s aura that they didn’t care—though calling it an aura would imply that it was unintentional on Riddle’s part. </p>
<p>But nothing that Riddle did was unintentional. </p>
<p>Even now, as he merely sat there, carefully eating what was on his plate—each mouthful was raised to his lips with the utmost care, and each chew was ever so deliberate, and the way he swallowed was utterly unbearable. Every single action was purposeful and calculated to achieve an exact reaction, as though Riddle lived his life as a continuous theatrical production, where every facial expression and every movement was so carefully curated to tell <em>his</em> version of a story. </p>
<p>Harry picked at his food, pushing the meat to the side and forming a defensive barrier with the thinly sliced carrots that were glazed in sweet honey and glinted, almost unnaturally, in the light. There was simply something too artificially beautiful about them, as though they were coated in a plastic gloss; set to be preserved until the end of time. He wasn’t planning on eating them. To be perfectly honest, Harry was not intending to eat more than a few mouthfuls, and those would be from dishes that were exclusively vegetarian—after all, he didn’t come here to lose his morality—he came here to watch the man who surely would, in another life, have been his greatest nemesis. </p>
<p>As Harry was half-watching Riddle, whilst stabbing baby potatoes and examining them thoroughly before putting them in his mouth, the rest of the discussion turned to morality and propriety and other notions that these people fundamentally 	<em>failed</em> to understand. For distracted by influence and the money that would buy it, for with each new ounce of wealth there became a greater distance between them and those they deemed beneath them. Money was the divider and the uniter of all humankind, but these people used it as an excuse to separate themselves off and consider themselves to be above the problems of the poor. </p>
<p>It was a distasteful position, but alas a popular one amongst the wealthier elite, who these days preferred to abscond from their civic duties and live more individualistic lives. </p>
<p>So, they talked, uninterrupted, in their pseudo-intellectualism and Harry sat at the end of the table prodding at the same potato and avoiding being involved. For it wasn’t that they were necessarily stupid, though intelligence was nonetheless a scarce resource, rather it was that their opinions were obnoxious, and their methodology was flawed. Too often they made assumptions that were based in such inherent privileges one would think they’d been raised in a diamond box with their every need catered to. </p>
<p>That was Riddle’s only redeeming feature, if he was even redeemable, that he understood people. Perhaps it was obvious to say that, but he could get under their skin in such a way that Harry had never quite seen before, and would happily watch the process forever if he could. For now, though, Harry continued to prod at the potato, rolling it around over his dry plate; the rest of them didn’t pay him attention and continued to talk amongst themselves—well—<em>almost</em> all of them. </p>
<p>Riddle was watching him again. Harry could feel his gaze digging into his neck and his hands, and any other exposed skin with such a weight that it felt like a sizable animal biting at his skin. Undoubtedly, Riddle was taking note of the fact he’d barely eaten anything since they’d all sat down, and had instead, spent a majority of his time sipping his water and pushing things around his plate.</p>
<p>But before Harry could linger on the potential implications of Riddle realising that he knew, their silent stares were interrupted by what sounded like Lestrange. “Tell me,” he said, addressing the room with a tone that was too casual and too effortless for someone who had human meat on their plate. “When does a man become a monster?” he said, all dramatic and evocative, demanding both intellectual and low brow answers. </p>
<p>“You’re asking the wrong question,” muttered Harry before he could stop himself. There was a silence, and Harry ducked his head and stabbed at an unassuming piece of beetroot, before eating it slowly, and pretending he couldn’t feel their eyes on him. After all, although he said it out loud, he hadn’t intended to be heard, and least of all had he intended to be heard by their host himself, especially given how far away he was. </p>
<p>But, regardless of his perceived privacy, Riddle was the one to speak next. “What did you say, Harry?” he said, carefully; his tone soft and as sweet as the orange perfume that filled the air. His fork momentarily pausing, so that the heavy metal of it was suspended half-way to his mouth, as looked over the food and directly at Harry; his pupils hanging still and firm, and horrible intense, against Harry’s own.</p>
<p>“You’re asking the wrong question,” Harry said again, louder this time, and it caught like a fish to a hook. Around him the conversations dissipated; wilting to the sound of his voice, and leaving a long, open corridor of space between Riddle and himself. </p>
<p>Riddle quirked a brow: “How so?”</p>
<p>“You’re asking the wrong question,” Harry said for a third time, “because you should be asking, when does a monster become a man.” As he spoke the final part of that sentence the words got caught in his mouth, their weight heavy with implications on his tongue.</p>
<p>The rest of the guests each looked at one another, exchanging glances that were equal parts raised eyebrows and low murmurs, all signifying that this was quite the scandalous interruption. After all, people didn’t interrupt Riddle. To be honest, the rules of etiquette went against interruptions of all sorts, but especially when the interrupter had barely spoken all evening—there was scarcely anyone worth speaking to—but now addressed their host with the ease of a man with too much courage and not enough cowardice. </p>
<p>“So, <em>Riddle</em>,” Harry said, speaking to him directly now, although he had been the implied inoculator since the beginning, “when <em>does</em> a monster become a man?”</p>
<p>Although the words were firm in their foundations and the tone of delivery was confident, Harry couldn’t shake the thudding of his heart and how it was mimicking in his pulse. He half-expected Riddle to simply ignore him and continue his quiet, and clearly private, conversations with Malfoy or Lestrange, but instead, and rather surprisingly, Riddle raised his eyes to meet Harry’s own again, and smiled. It was that same smile he always wore, the one that was so warm on the surface and so cold underneath, like a spark of lightning crackling the sky it was hot and electric, but instilled with a good quantity of danger as well. </p>
<p>Riddle continued that smile even as he dipped his gaze back to his plate and persisted in cutting his portion of meat into a thin strip that he then wrapped around his fork. “When it understands a man,” he said, licking his lips as he raised his fork to his mouth, and chewed, and swallowed indecently. "When it has comprehended civilisation, acquired sophistication, and embraced sensualisation,” he continued, softly and without a pause, as though he had been mulling on the question all evening. “That is when a monster becomes a man.”</p>
<p>The pause in the conversation continued; everyone equally caught on Riddle’s words, and all looking in his direction, framing him with nine pairs of eyes though he were the very window of divine knowledge.<br/>
“Does that answer your question, Harry?” Riddle said, reaching out for his glass of wine—already half-empty. He gripped it between his fingers, light and easy as though the glass itself had a weightlessness about it, and his raised it up with the same deliberate, sensuous, slowness, and drank; and Harry found himself staring uselessly as Riddle’s throat as it contracted every time he swallowed. </p>
<p>“Not entirely,” he said carefully, cautious to keep himself firmly on the line between gentle, intellectual prodding and outright insulting, for the former tended to go down far better than the latter. “By your explanation,” he continued, “monstrous men would be invisible.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t they?” Riddle said back quickly, apparently content to ignore his other guests for the sake of Harry and Harry alone, even as they watched him with increasing levels of frustration and confusion. “Can you see them, Harry?” he asked, “could you pick one out of a line-up.” The question felt wrong somehow, but Harry still nodded, slowly, and a little more carefully than before, his hand dropping against his thigh to the wand holster that lay there.</p>
<p>“Is there one sitting at this table?” Riddle continued, though his tone was changing from casual and, almost mocking, to something far more challenging. The same expression of feeling was in Riddle's gaze too; that roughness and determination, as though he was daring Harry to call out his personal monstrosities, and even his moral deformities to his face.</p>
<p>“Go on, Harry,” he said, still goading, “tell me who <em>is</em> the monster dressed as a man?”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Harry held Riddle’s gaze, waiting for him to backtrack as he realised the implications of his words. But he never did. Rather, Riddle just continued to smile; his tongue just visible as it scraped over the edges of his teeth. In that moment, no one else seemed to matter, in fact, they seemed to melt away, blurring into the background until it was just him and Riddle, sitting and watching each other, framed by black and separated by nothing more than a dark stretch of table, ominously decorated with flowers that were wilting, and food that was perversely <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>“You are,” said Harry eventually, swallowing down the urge to point his finger like a priest proclaiming the presence of the devil; even if that was what this was. Not that Riddle reacted in any sort of incriminating way; he just leant back, one hand resting on the tablecloth and the other still holding his glass. Like that he looked so casual, relaxed, almost lazy, except there was a razor quality to his smile and a sharpness in his eyes. </p>
<p>Something that was feral and flickering like a dying light; momentarily flooding his irises with endless, empty black before the colour crept back in like the first streaks of dawn. “Me?” he said, ducking his head and keeping his tone still light and airy, as though this were nothing more than a conversation about the weather over breakfast. But when Riddle looked back up again, his gaze was decidedly cold, even if his smile stayed in place. “Now, Harry,” he said, soft and sweet but in a way that was deeply unnerving, like milk that had gone sour, “why ever would you think that?” </p>
<p>Without thinking, Harry stabbed his fork through the meat and raised it to the light. Even under the warm glare, it was pink and wet, the slight rim of fat melted away; just looking at it no one would ever guess what monstrous secret was contained between the thick threads of muscle. Without even looking up, he knew Riddle’s eyes were equally focussed on that monstrous piece meat, not that it stopped him eating. </p>
<p>The animal tissue spiked on the end of the fork was all the proof he needed of Riddle’s monstrosities, and Harry held it up as though this was a theatre production and he was the lead actor. He still didn’t speak though, he didn’t really need to; not when he was slowly turning his fork, letting the light illuminate every curve, and every hollow, and every thick thread of matter that made up such an atrocious mouthful. </p>
<p>It was a play performed for just one man though, for the rest of their party had turned their gaze to the walls, or the table, or even their own plates, and their hands worked mechanically. The clinking of the metal cutlery against the porcelain of the plates was the only sound filling the room, and it was grating on Harry’s ears.</p>
<p>“So, Harry?” Riddle said, “you are yet to enlighten me of my monstrosities.” </p>
<p>Harry swallowed; there was a deliberateness in Riddle’s word choice there; not <em>us</em> but <em>me</em>; as though Riddle didn’t care if the others were bored, or uninterested, or even involved in the conversation, all that mattered was himself and Harry. In that moment, Harry could finally appreciate how it must feel to be a constant in Riddle’s orbit; the constant attention was dizzying, and it made him warmer than it should, his fingers itching to move and a tightness growing under his skin. </p>
<p>“I think we both know them…” Harry paused to glance down at the meat still stuck on his fork, “…intimately.”</p>
<p>Riddle continued to smile, and even leaned forward a little, his fingers circling the stem of his wineglass, “that doesn’t mean,” he said, “that I don’t want to hear you say them; one by one, Harry.”</p>
