    <p>Harry moaned in pleasure as Lucius thrust deep inside him, mind you Lucuis didn’t know that it wasn’t his wife he was taking below him. Really Metamorphmagus was a cheat in a war, specially when one had to trick there way into an enemy stronghold.</p><p> </p><p>It hadn’t been till he was eighteen that the ability had manifested in him, apparently Dumbledore had placed a block on the ability since he would be growing up in the muggle world.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort had been defeated, but then his followers had decided that they wanted to continue.</p><p> </p><p>Th muggle world thankfully didn’t know of the magicals.. yet, it was too close to many times.</p><p> </p><p>Harry had been taking Narcissa’s place for six months now, and he was only getting away with it due to a few things. The original Nacissa was dead due to her own folly, his Metamorphmagus ability and a horrible ritual the light side had done. It was called consume, where the dead ones body and memory were consumed into another. He was still Harry Potter, but he was also in a small sense Narcissa, and he tried to ignore the many memories and emotions it gave him.</p><p> </p><p>Or the fact that Lucius was a very sexual man that left this female pleasure a cum whore, and that was when Narcissa was alive.</p><p> </p><p>“It was wonderful darling,” Harry purred, kissing the older male on the lips while he was still buried deep inside the current female form.</p><p> </p><p>“Your still as beautiful and wonderful since our wedding day,” Lucius smirked, and Harry screamed as her sweet spot was hit.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you still have to go on your trip love,” Harry pouted, as tomorrow Lucius would head to France.</p><p> </p><p>“If I want to keep the other countries out, they keep trying to help the ravel mudbloods,” Lucius sneered.</p><p> </p><p>“Well then, I think we should rack up more time since it will be a month till you get back,” Harry purred, Lucius bent to the task.</p><p> </p><p>OoOoO</p><p> </p><p>Harry woke sore and satisfied, the other side of the bed was cold and empty as the man had left.</p><p> </p><p>He lay there for a moment, knowing that within hours he would be gone and he’d finally be able to take his true form.</p><p> </p><p>It was strange, he had enjoyed being Narcissa and it wasn’t just due to the fact the ritual had consumed Narcissa’s self into him. The sex was definitely a plus, but he knew that as the only Metamorphmagus on the other side he was needed, he was just hoping the consume ritual wasn’t needed again.</p><p> </p><p>Sighing she got up, walking into the master bathroom where a beautiful shower stood. She stepped under the hot spray, relaxing as muscles relaxed and cum washed over her body which looked like it should belong on a model, he’d been amused that Narcissa was a witch that used spells to look her age, as a Black female her body aged much slower.</p><p> </p><p>Once out, for the final time she garbed herself in the stately dresses a lilac this one and placed the spells on her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Damn it,” Harry sighed, the dress was a bit tight but this form was smaller then his own so weight was an issue and the food was more rich then his body was use to.</p><p> </p><p>Dry and dressed he left the rooms, it was breakfast time and Draco wouldn’t leave till noon so couldn’t leave yet.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco,” Harry said taking her chair, a house elf placing down a salad breakfast.</p><p> </p><p>“Mother,” Draco said getting up, placing a kiss on her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Internally Harry sighed, in a way the consume curse made Harry his mother and it hurt that Draco was never going to find out what happened to the women. A women who would continue to live on as Harry in some ways.</p><p> </p><p>“Your father already left on his trip, are you ready to head out for your trip for the next few two weeks?” she asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes mother, I’ll be heading out early. Apparently right after breakfast,” Draco said.</p><p> </p><p>“Have fun dear,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Two hours later Harry smiled, and activated the portkey disguised as a necklace.</p>
