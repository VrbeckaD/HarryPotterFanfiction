    <p>Lucius knocked on the door to Prince Manor. He waited, his heart beating wildly in his chest. Finally, what seemed like an eternity later, a house elf answered the door, took his cloak, and directed him to the sitting room where Lord Prince himself would surely be. He took in a deep breath and let it out slowly. This was ridiculous. He was a Malfoy. He had been a servant of the Dark Lord himself. He had killed and tortured countless people, and been tortured brutally himself. He could face one man.</p>
<p>Lucius opened the sitting room and stepped inside. His eyes were immediately drawn to the man with jet black hair and even darker black eyes. The dark man sat in a large, wing-backed chair in front of the fireplace. Back ramrod straight, wand in his right hand, he leisurely tapped the end of his wand against his left palm. Waiting. He looked… regal. Like a king upon his throne, surveying his subjects, knowing his every whim was just waiting to be obeyed.</p>
<p>It made Lucius weak in the knees. He swallowed audibly, and took slow, measured steps towards the chair. When he approached the man in the chair, he looked questioningly into his eyes. He knew what he wanted, more than anything, but didn’t dare act further without permission. Time stood still as Lucius waited, staring into those bottomless black eyes. He felt the push of legilimency in his mind, and submitted to the intrusion.</p>
<p>Severus sifted through his memories until he found the one occurring just a mere hour before…</p>
<p>
  <em> Lucius paced back in forth in the Manor’s living room, trying to prepare himself to go to Prince Manor, a letter in his hands. He had read it at least ten times, but it didn’t make its meaning any clearer. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Lucius, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Please come to Prince manor at 8pm tonight. We need to discuss our situation. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Severus” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>What the hell was that supposed to mean. Did Severus want to continue their relationship now that the war was over? Could one even call it a relationship? During the war, they would seek each other out when they had the need. Never any questions, never any expectations. They both knew their roles, and what they both needed. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Lucius stopped pacing suddenly and bolted to his room. He didn’t know if Severus would still want him, but damn it he was going to be ready if he did. He raided his dresser and pulled out a pair of delicate pink lace knickers. He felt ridiculous putting them on, but he knew they would turn Severus on. He rarely submitted to wearing women’s clothes, but any leverage on his side today could be beneficial. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Severus pulled out of his mind, and raised a brow at Lucius, the corner of his mouth tugging into a small smirk. Most of the tension left his posture. He had found what he was looking for. Lucius still wanted him.</p>
<p>He slowly raised his left hand, gaze still locked on Lucius’, and snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>The effect on Lucius was immediate. He fell to his knees in front of Severus, whimpering in relief. He spread his knees wide and rested his palms face up on his thighs, keeping his head bowed. A perfect submissive’s pose. Severus did not speak, but ran a hand through Lucius’ long, blonde locks. Both men were content to sit there as Severus petted Lucius.</p>
<p>Lucius yearned to lean into his Master’s touch but knew better than to do so without permission. Severus was a strict Master who didn’t tolerate any disrespect or disobedience. Hardly surprising to anyone who knew the man. Years of serving two unforgiving masters had turned Severus into a demanding and unyielding Master. He was swift and almost cruel in doling out punishments. However, while hard, he was always consistent and fair in dealing with his submissive. 


</p>
<p>He was exactly what Lucius needed. Most who knew Lucius would never guess that he had submissive tendencies. However, serving under the Dark Lord broke something in him. That arrogant and prideful Malfoy was broken. Of course, he still put on that facade for the world, but not for Severus. Severus was the only one who understood that Lucius not only craved, but needed, a Master who was everything the Dark Lord was not. While the Dark Lord was unpredictable, Severus had a set of rules to be followed. While the Dark Lord enjoyed inflicting pain for the sake of pain, Severus only inflicted pain for pleasure, or for a predetermined punishment. While the Dark Lord did not forgive mistakes, Severus was more understanding, having faced a number of failures himself.</p>
<p>And so Lucius needed to please Severus, the way he was never able to please his previous Master. Maybe then he would finally begin to heal. So, despite the fact that he wanted to nuzzle into Severus' touch, Lucius stayed perfectly still under the touch. He trembled with the force of the emotions coursing through his body. Relief that Severus had accepted him warred with his fear that he would lose Severus' favor the way he lost the Dark Lord's. He couldn't survive that. Not again.</p>
<p>After several minutes, Lucius' trembling subsided, and Severus put a finger under Lucius’ chin and raised his head until Lucius was looking him in the eyes. His gaze alight with passion, he devoured Lucius’ steel grey eyes with his pitch-black ones. Lucius breath stuttered.</p>
<p>“Oh pet, you have no idea what I’m going to do to you,” Severus chuckled wickedly.</p>
