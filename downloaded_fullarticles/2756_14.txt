  <em>Hard. That is the only fitting description for whatever the fuck I’m lying on. My Bed isn’t that hard, is it? Why is it so cold and-IS THERE SOMETHING CRAWLING OVER MY HAND? </em>
</p><p>Shrieking loudly, Melissa sat up and slapped away a spider from her left hand. As she looked around, she noticed that she wasn’t in her bed anymore. She wasn’t even in her bedroom, or apartment at all. No, she has been sleeping in a forest, surrounded by large dark trees and small insects all over the ground.</p><p>Disgusted she stood up from the hard ground, patting down her clothes. She was still dressed in her pyjamas, a combination of short pants and a loose fitting shirt. “Damn it’s cold”, Melissa swore, rubbing down her arms, “Wait - How the fuck did I end up here? MUM? MARC?”. She started calling out for her family, despite having a feeling that no one would be near enough to hear her.</p><p>Now slightly panicking she started pacing on the spot she had woken up. “Okay. OKAY. Calm down, Melissa. Everything is fine. No need to worry, at all! All - Is - Neato. You just somehow ended up in a forest that looks nothing like the forest close to your home. That means it isn’t the forest close to your home. So, in conclusion, you’re not anywhere near your home at all. I mean, that happens. Who doesn't know that? Yeah.”</p><p>Trying to force down tears of despair, Melissa began walking in a random direction, convinced that at some point there had to be some water or something that might lead to civilization. </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>“F-F-Fu-Fuck” Melissa shuddered. She spread and moved her fingers, trying to feel anything at all. After walking for over an hour, her feet and hands had become completely numb. Rubbing them had not been helping her at all, despite having tried desperately for 30 minutes. She knew that if she didn’t find anything to heat herself up she’d probably freeze to death, which didn't sound that good in her opinion. </p><p>“G-Got-Gotta m-make a f-f-fire or s-something.” - Little clouds of her breath became visible in the cold air. Melissa gathered everything she would need for a small fire, at least after what she had seen in movies. <em>Can’t be that hard, can it?</em>  the girl thought and tried to spin a stick between her hands on top of another stick. But to no avail; “D-Damn t-this isn’t w-w-working” she whispered after a short while, her forehead deeply wrinkled with concentration. She looked around for something to use as a lens, like glass shards, but then spotted some small rocks and realized that that could be another option to start a fire. </p><p>Quickly she snatched the rocks and slammed then against each other, hoping it would create some kind of spark to light up the pile of dried leaves she had stacked up. Then, after some fruitless tries, the little pile suddenly caught fire, startling Melissa. She hadn’t seen any sparks to cause the fire but forgot about it after she felt the warmth of the fire meeting her face. Not wasting any time, the girl hastily stacked small sticks and bigger tree branches on top of it. It was going to be a long night and she was determined to create a longer lasting heat source.  </p><p>Proud of her success, she happily sat down next to the fire and looked around to scan her current location. The girl had set up her little ‘camp’ between the big roots of a nearly hollow tree, thus shielding her from most of the icy wind and possible rain. It had become somewhat darker, she noticed that her eyes couldn’t see as far anymore. The outlines of trees were getting more blurred in the distance, and harder for her to differentiate. Soon it would be a big dark blob of trees, Melissa thought to herself.</p><p>A loud rumble disturbed the silence. “God damn,” she mumbled, patting her empty stomach, “ I should’ve eaten something before bed.” Breaking down everything she knew about survival shows she had seen on TV, she tried to think of something food-related. Melissa knew about snares and that fishing was supposed to be a good option to get food, but that was about where her knowledge ended. The girl had never actually sat down and read how to build a snare, and neither did she know how to fish. Even if she did, there were no signs of wildlife at all around her, also she hadn’t seen any deep water along her entire walk. </p><p>“Oh well… I guess I'll try to find something tomorrow..”. Ignoring her stomach, she piled some more leaves and moss together and formed some sort of sleeping-mat between the roots of her tree. She knew that she wouldn’t be able to get much sleep, but the walk and the cold had exhausted her as well as the fact of being ripped out of her last nap. Refreshing her energy couldn't hurt in her situation.</p><p>After closing her eyes, bad thoughts overran her mind. Pictures of her own soft and warm bed and her home popped up in her head, filling her deeply with the wish of being able to go there. She thought of her family, not surprisingly being filled with a more void feeling. She kind of missed her cute little five-year-old brother and even her other, more annoying brother, but the rest of them didn’t mean that much to her. </p><p>Melissa guessed that with as many siblings as she had, it wasn’t really shocking. Her room not even being her own room and her clothes mostly the old, worn ones of older siblings. Never had she spent a lot of time with them, closing herself off most of the times. She felt of her home no more than it was: A place to live, eat and sleep. Feeling <strong>at</strong> home meant something different to her, it was a warm and calm sensation, which she only experienced at places like her best friends home or maybe her favourite cafe when it was almost empty. Her best friend.. Melissa thought of Nico with grief. After nearly two months of not seeing him, she truly missed him.. Him and her other good friends Jannis, Meike and Michelle. They all knew each other since they were 8 years old and had been close friends for almost over 9 years now. Normally they had seen each other every next day, but Melissa hadn’t had time for a while now. They were supposed to meet tomorrow..</p><p>Trying to shoo away her negative thoughts, Melissa closed her eyes harder. She knew she had to get some sleep and started humming one of her favourite tunes. The fatigue, finally overcoming her now, let her fall into a restless slumber..</p>
