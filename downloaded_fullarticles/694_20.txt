    <p>There's always been something about the open road that has cleared my twisted thoughts. I'm not entirely sure why, possibly the solitude or the knowledge that there is absolutely no one that I need to put any sort of face on for. Whatever the reason, even with the warm summer rain pounding down on my goggles and bike, I feel a little more at ease than I did before I began this small 'holiday'.</p><p>Now the reason I put it like that? Well, it's a long story, and one that I prefer not to dwell on in fear of pulling out my hair. Which considering I am currently on what some people consider a two wheeled death machine in the rain flying through the sinuous Swiss mountain roads running between the long journey from Winterthur in the north to Lugano in the south it might not be advisable to pull my hands from the bars at this given moment. Of course at this moment I am still heading east towards St. Gallen taking all the less travelled paths that would extend my journey even further. Technically the trip going directly from Winterthur to Lugano would take around three hours, I needed much more.</p><p>In fact, I needed about 12 days. That's how long I have in between the summer and fall sessions before I'm able to return to my school. University now I guess considering I graduated the 'prep school' part of the school and am now attending the even more prestigious Swiss accredited university. Even with the extra time taken out I think I'll still end up going over to Geneva unless I find some town with a particularly nice river or something like that to stay in for a few extra days.</p><p>I still don't understand why exactly I need to leave the school between the sessions, it's quite inconvenient for me. They can do it though, nothing that I can do to change that. Some of the best minds attend my school, or at least that is what the school bored boast to prospective students and parents when they want a particular diplomat or in some cases royal family member to enrol. They also have some of the richest kids, and those don't really need intelligence to excel. If you want to be technical about it, I could easily be grouped with those students. My parents were quite rich. The old money of the Black family has only gown in stature as time has progressed. This is why I am able to buy a motorbike and take a trip alone though a foreign country that I have already lived and studied in for the past two years without even putting a scratch in my bank account.</p><p>When my parents informed me that they didn't want me to come back with my younger brother once again the told me that they put and extra 20,000 CHF into my account. To them this was pocket change. Hush money. So that I didn't let slip that I didn't have the choice to return home, so that their friends in high places wouldn't question the absence of the Black's oldest son.</p><p>"Oh we let our son go on holiday around Switzerland" sounds much better than "we don't want our son home because we despise the sight of him and everything he stands for."</p><p>No, that wouldn't be an acceptable way to present yourself. To them it's better to send me away then deal with me. They even had my younger brother Regulus, the only one who cared for me in the slightest, apply to Cambridge so that he wouldn't be near me anymore. Too afraid I'd influence him in some way. That one of the many things that make me a disappointment to them would rub off on him. Every day their actions make me believe that it isn't possible for them to love their own son. It makes me believe that I am the worthless disgrace the way I am. </p><p>All these thoughts make me turn my face down slightly and roll the throttle just a bit more than what is considered safe as I sweep around yet another tight corner. I feel my rear tire spin and I have to compensate so the bike doesn't spin out from under me entirely. At least this stops my mind. I have found that one of the most violent, even deadly, things in the world for me is silence. It makes it so my thoughts are able to parade freely, which is often not the best thing.</p><p>
  <em>Only twelve more days, then I'll be back in my single dorm at Hogwarts. James and Petter will be in their own quarters near mine a couple of days later and I'll be able to resume my charade with the distraction of my only two friends. Just twelve days. </em>
</p><p>The next twelve days pass virtually the same way. I spend three going down to Lugano. I find some place to stay, wander the city or town, retest back to the room I rented with my headphones and notebook, then leave the next day and repeat in another town. I stop on the forth day along the rocky bank of one of the crisp rivers and dive into the freezing water for an hour or so before moving on. I didn't pack much, only what I could fit in the compartment under my seat and my backpack. This consisted of a couple of black pants, a few long sleeves, my Drop Dead button down, a black scarf, my favourite DropDead jacket and jumper, my box, my charger, new phone, Bose headphones, my notebook, pens, passport, a large sum of CHF and Euros since I didn't want to bring my bank card, and lastly my camera with a couple of extra lenses and batteries. These took up the majority of the space in my small compartment, but it didn't matter to me because they were worth it. Besides, my jacket and jumper fit in well with it, the rest could be crammed into my luckily waterproof backpack. My riding gear kept the water out pretty good as well. Lucky of me the worst of the weather was on the first day. The rest of my possessions were in a storage unit by the school, including my other phone that people had the number to.</p><p>I don't know why I wanted to be left alone on this trip, I just did. I didn't have it in my to face others at the moment. Though I know my parents despise me, the have made it quite clear from the foul words and rough hands, it still bring a bit of displeasure to me every time they demonstrate it yet again. So I decided that I would be alone for a bit. Go to places where no one knew my name or face. Be a ghost. So far it was working our quite well.</p><p>The days passed more quickly that I expected and before I realised it I was parked in front of the villa entry (turned office) of Hogwarts University.</p><p>The school building consisted of a couple of old mansions/villas that were renovated slightly and transformed to classrooms and offices. Only the grand libraries remain mainly intact which I am extremely thankful for. Our dormitories are all old apartment buildings that were either bought or built within 20 minutes walking distance of the main villa. There were only four and you were essentially sorted by an extremely long questionnaire that was sent out and revised before you came to the campus. You stayed in that building, or house, your entire stay. I enjoyed mine, Gryffindor, because it was backed up against the woods and they had plenty if single rooms. The school only had a maximum of 800 students attending a single given time, 200 for the uni-prep and 600 for the actual university. Any more than that and they'd have to expand. I was happy it was small.</p><p>As I push open the heavy oak door to the office to retrieve my keys to my house and mailbox I see the always chipper face of whatever student is occupying that chair. I don't know how they all always look so darn happy. Actually, that's not true, I have been putting on a mask for others for as long as I can remember, I assume that others do the same. It seems like most people are genuinely happy though which slightly annoys me. Why can't I be like that? I give this girl my name and house she sorts through papers. Once she finds my tag and flips to the appropriate page I can see that there is a large post-it in the middle.</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry Mr Black. It seems like there was a mix up and you will be receiving a roommate this year. The note says that professor Dumbledore is very sorry for the mix up, but that you should remember that all bedrooms are separate" she explained to me. I do my best to hide the fact that this thought terrifies me and reply with a small smile, "that's okay sweetie, nothing can be done. Thank you for your assistance."</p><p>I sign for the keys and get it of there as quickly as possible with still being polite. I have never had a roommate. Not even James or Peter! There were too many things that I want to keep secret and on top of that I liked my privacy! I liked being alone. I try to remind myself of Dumbledore's words as I make the short drive to my dorm. I'm shaking as I put my things together in my duffle bag and turn to the building.</p><p>
  <em>What if he's terrible? Or just rude? Or worse, invasive? What if he finds out? Then what happens? </em>
</p><p>I nearly drop all of my stuff asÂ I enter the outside door. I make it to the lift, my rooms are on the 6th floor which happens to be the top, at least I'll have a balcony. Hopefully the lift doesn't break too many times this term, form what I have hard though it does happen at least a few times every term. I'm still slightly shaking and biting down hard on the inside of my cheek the entire ride up.</p><p>Once I get to my room I see that my boxes have already been placed just inside of the open door. Just as I'm stepping in I see another boy emerge from the bedroom in the far right corner. He's taller than me with scruffy light brown hair and fringe that nearly covers his grey-green eyes entirely. He's in a slightly shabby suit, so not from money then. He must be very intelligent to have gotten a scholarship good enough to make this school affordable to him. As I'm taking in his appearance he notices me standing in the doorway among my boxes and smiles.</p><p>"Well, hello there. My name is Lupin," he said as he walks toward outstretching his hand in the process, "Remus Lupin."</p><p>I finally catch myself and take his hand, "Sirius, it's nice to meet you," and then I really look at him up close for the first time. He has a few small scars scattered about his face, but the don't do his features any harm. In fact they may make him appear even more attractive, if that is even possible. My eyes widen as I realise what I just thought.</p><p>
  <em>Well, shit.</em>
