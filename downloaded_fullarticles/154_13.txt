    <p>
  <span>Abraxas Malfoy is a simple man. He likes the Malfoy legacy, the business and political opportunities he’s given for future Malfoys, and the securement of an heir his son has provided.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>What he doesn’t like is the nagging his wife’s giving him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Abraxas please,” she holds his frail hand, “you're dying. You deserve to see your daughter.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t have a daughter.” Even in his frail, dying state, Abraxas is as stubborn as ever.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“We both know that’s not true.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“That failure of a girl, the Lovegood’s harlot, is not my daughter.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes she is.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Both of them look each other in the eyes. Abraxas versus Cassiopeia. It’s unrelenting until his final moments, Abraxas fades away. He’s died without saying goodbye to his little girl.</span>
