<p> </p>
<p>In the end it was the bogart that saved them. Although, to be honest, Lily hadn’t been overly impressed by finding it at the time. I mean, which young mother doesn’t want to discover, at 7 pm while trying to run a bath for her progressively more tired and grumpy one year old son, that a shape-shifting bogey impersonating her greatest fear has moved into the bathroom cabinet. The fact that Lily didn’t have her wand and that her greatest fear appeared, unnervingly, to be the corpse of her darling one-year-old Harry, still, blue-grey, and lifeless, did nothing to improve Lily’s overall mood. Swearing under her breath, in a way she had promised to give up now Harry was starting to talk, Lily ducked quickly upstairs to retrieve her wand, in order to deal ruthlessly with the unwanted household horror. She had just successfully fished her wand out from where it had fallen between the clothes dresser and the bed and was heading back out of her and James’s bedroom when she heard the front door shatter.</p>
<p>Lily was down the hall and at the upper landing of the stairs before she even had time to process a coherent thought. She slowed, instinctively hiding behind the door-jam, body angled and alert - after three years of regular combat as a member of the Order of the Phoenix, slipping into battle mode was frighteningly easy. Lily edged forward, wand out, and peered down the flight of stairs at the splintered gaping hole where the front door had been. Just then James pelted out of the living room, wandless, and skidded to a stop, frozen with horror. Standing in what was left of the door frame was Lord Voldemort himself, wind whipping his robes, skin wax-like and distorted, his glowing red eyes locked with those of her husband, his mouth twitched into a cruel smile. Voldemort had not seen Lily.</p>
<p>James shouted “Lily, take Harry and go! It’s him! Go! Run! I’ll hold him off…”</p>
<p>Before James had even finished speaking Lily acted, firing a defensive charm that sent her husband flying backwards into the wall and clear (just) of the green killing curse Voldemort fired at him a fraction of a second later. Voldemort’s curse hit the mirror, which shattered and refracted a defused curse back into the room. A shard of it hit Voldemort in the chest and he staggered - buying Lily the heartbeat of time she needed in order to re-train her wand on the man who had come to murder her husband and son. “Avada Kadavra” she screamed and felt the wild joy of it flow through her wand arm, leaving her body like poison. You won’t kill, maim and torture anyone else I love, ever - she thought, as the green light of the spell hit her attacker full in the face. Lily had never thought she truly had it in her to kill someone, but as she watched Voldemort, the man who had caused so much hurt and killed so many, crumple in what was left of her doorway, all she felt was vicious joy. But then the explosion hit. Lily was thrown backwards as the whole wall closest to Voldemort was blasted into rubble.</p>
<p>Minutes later, Lily was crouched next to James’s crumpled body, working fast. Harry, judging by the healthy crying in the room next-door, was fully alive, well and conscious. But James wasn’t. Lily had removed the rubble that was crushing his lower body, stemmed the bleeding from the gashes in his side and arms, and had repaired enough broken bones to be sure that he was able to breath and wouldn’t bleed out from broken legs. However, the refracted Avada Kadavra that Voldemort had shot had hit James and she couldn’t work out what the damage was. Although, to her great relief, he was still breathing. Lilly had never even heard of an AK causing damage but not killing someone - but then she supposed James hadn’t received the full force of the curse and her knowledge of healing was limited. “If you die on me James Potter, I promise I will kill you” Lily hissed leaning over her husband, feeling his chest and looking for any obvious signs injury. She felt something hard and flat in her husband’s shirt pocket. James’s two way mirror, the one he used to talk to Sirius. Sirius, their best friend, Sirius, the trainee healer and Sirius, one of the only fucking people who could come into their house to help her, because of the useless fidelius charm on the place would still keep her friends out, even though it had somehow allowed their arch-enemy in. Why on earth had she not thought of Sirius before. Lily flicked open the mirror.</p>
<p>“Sirius, Sirius Black. Fucking PAD FOOT.”</p>
<p>Sirius’s face swam into focus in the little contact mirror in her palm. “Lily? What the…?” Sirius paled.</p>
<p>“Voldemort just appeared in our house in Godric’s Hollow. He’s dead but James…” Lily faltered for a second “oh God, just get here will you? If we get through this I am going to fucking kill Peter fucking Pettigrew”. Sirius straitened and nodded once “OK” he said “I’m on my way”.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus Lupin lent back in his chair and rubbed his eyes, he fort the urge to rock the wooden chair onto its back legs as he stretched, reminding himself he was no longer a teenager, even if his (very adult) curse-breaking work was spread all over his old desk, reminding him alarmingly of the homework he had used the desk to complete during school holidays. Living with his parents again after all this time was giving him flashbacks, Remus decided, that was all. And it was probably best not revisit his youth in a way that could potentially leave him spread-eagled on his bedroom floor. His Mum might hear and that would extremely embarrassing. So instead Remus twisted in the chair, stretching out his cramped back and looked around his small, tidy and sparsely (but comfortably) furnished room. Apart from the desk, there was a narrow bed next to windows with full length blue and yellow pastel curtains, a slightly faded quilt and a rag mat lay next to the bed, covering the smooth tongue-and-groove board flooring. Apart from that, the only other furnishings were an old carved oak wardrobe and a magnificent bookshelf that stretched as high as the ceiling and covered nearly the whole of one wall. Before moving back with his parents a few weeks ago, Remus had barely slept in this room since he came of age - he and Sirius had moved in together so soon after leaving Hogwarts. Naturally, his mother had removed most of his teenaged trappings years ago, but even so the room still felt like it belonged to his sixteen-year-old self. He wasn’t sure what his parents had used the room for while he was away - although he suspected his mother had used it for storing things and possibly doing her sewing in. However, as she had banished him to the living room, suitcase and all, until she had a chance to tidy it up, Remus couldn’t be completely sure. All things considered, his parents had been very good about him turning up unannounced a little under a month ago, asking to move back home. They had even put up with his sketchy explanations about why he had suddenly had to move out of his ‘friend’s’ flat, without too many questions. Remus had never been entirely honest with his parents about the exact nature of his and Sirius’s relationship. It seemed ridiculous really, that his parents didn’t know about the most important relationship of his adult life. But when he and Sirius first moved in together Remus had avoided the topic, not being sure how to explain bi-sexuality to his extremely old-fashioned parents. He had only dated girls before and his parents already knew Sirius as one of Remus’s best friends. He was scared. He was worried his Mum and Dad would think Sirius had somehow turned Remus gay - or that Remus’s girlfriends hadn’t been genuine relationships but merely cover for a closeted son. He hadn’t wanted the scandal, the guilt or the pity and it had been so easy to pretend he and Sirius were just flatting together. After all, isn’t that what best friends in their early twenties usually do? And once the first lie was told, the idea of broaching the topic became more and more awkward as time wore on and Remus had never found the ideal minute to have the conversation… So now he found himself dumped after seven years and his parents had no idea. He could still tell them, he guessed. But now said relationship seemed to be over, or at least on hold, it hardly seemed to be an appropriate time to explain. Who knows, the next person Remus was dumb enough to fall for might be appropriately female and he might never need to talk to them about it. That said, he dearly wanted to be able to talk to his parents about the break-up. Maybe he would even be able cry about it, to rage at the unfairness of the situation and how much he didn’t understand what was going on in Sirius’s crazy brain. Remus hadn’t had anyone to talk to about any of it at all - Lily and James were in hiding and any other friends Remus might at one point have been comfortable talking to about relationships with were either estranged or dead. Remus winced. He tried really hard never to think about all the people he had known and loved who had died. It hurt too much and he had a job to do. There would be time to grieve properly after the war. At least he still had his family. Remus sat very still, listening to his parents conversing quietly in the living room below, the Wizarding Wireless a quiet hum in the background, and he knew he didn’t have the heart to tell them about his sordid love affair. He was holding on to normality so hard that he was terrified that it would shatter in his hands at any moment. He didn’t have the strength to hold the illusion of normality and talk about Sirius. His parents deserved normal. Hadn’t he caused them enough pain for one lifetime? What with being a werewolf, unemployed and a member of the (quickly dying off) Order of the Phoenix. Surely having to confront their son’s both gay and tragic love life was one worry he could spare them - however much it hurt him to hide it.</p>
<p>It was at this point that a huge shaggy silver dog patronus leaped bodily through the wall of Remus’s room and landed crouching on the rug. The voice of his possibly-ex-boyfriend emitted from the dog’s mawl:</p>
<p>“Remus, I have been an idiot. The Potters have been attacked and James is badly hurt. I have brought them to our flat. Please come, fast”.</p>
<p>The dog disappeared in a swirl of mist and Remus swore, rage rushing over his body like a physical thing, as though he had stepped into a lake of anger. Only Sirius would have the nerve to call on him for help out of the blue, like the last three weeks hadn’t even happened. Like they had never even argued. Rumus noted bitterly that Sirius had also referred to the building they had lived in as ‘our flat’ again, too - not ‘my flat’ like the last time they had talked. But it was also clear that Lily, James and Harry were in trouble. So with a huge effort, Remus took a deep breath and pushed down his rage, forcing it into a small, hard, containable ball in the pit of his stomach. Standing briskly, he fumbled for his travelling cloak while racking his brains for thinking a plausible lie to tell his parents to explain why he needed to go out this late in the evening. Of cause Remus was going to help the Potters - some things were more important than domestic rows and heart-ache.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>Remus apperated neatly onto the doorstep of Sirius’s London Flat. He tapped a pattern out quickly on the door and waited a heartbeat before it was opened a crack. Lily peeped out at him, her wand pointing directly at his chest.</p>
<p>“Moony” she said “what did you say the night I told you James and I were getting engaged?”</p>
<p>Of cause. She wanted to check it was really him - not a Death Eater impersonating him using polyjuice potion. Remus flinched slightly but replied</p>
<p>“I said “Oh no! James is going to be completely insufferable - he’s been sure he would marry you since we were 13.” OK, my turn. Lily, where were we the night you told me about your engagement?”</p>
<p>“Here, in this flat” she replied - Remus grinned.</p>
<p>Lily threw open the door and threw a one-armed hug around him - Harry was on her left hip and she was wearing, well, not much to be honest. Just a baggy T-shirt, no bra and a pair of fairly see-through pajama pants. Remus blushed. Lily glanced down at her clothes as though just noticing them.</p>
<p>“Oh, right. Yeh, well we were getting ready for bed when Voldemort showed up. I haven’t really have time to change since.”</p>
<p>“Voldemort was in your house?!” said Remus, agast. “But how… Sirius didn’t… he couldn’t have told…” stuttered Remus panicking</p>
<p>“No” Lily cut in quickly “It’s OK Moony, Sirius had nothing to do with it. Peter was our secret keeper. He’s the bastard who told” she gave Remus a searching look “I thought you knew we had switched?”</p>
<p>Remus shook his head slowly, stunned. He had no idea.</p>
<p>“Well” said Lily finally “I guess it’s an evening for unpleasant surprises all round” she gave him a rye grin.</p>
<p>Remus stepped into the house. Sirius was kneeling on the floor next to an unconscious James. Remus’s heart skipped - and it wasn’t just James’s poor health that was making him feel panicky.</p>
<p>“Have you checked it’s really Sirius?” he asked.</p>
<p>Lily frowned. “No, I just kind of assumed. He had James’s mirror and was able to get into our house despite the fidelius”.</p>
<p>“It’s OK Rem. Just ask me something” said Sirius without looking up.</p>
<p>“OK. What was the last thing you said to me?” said Remus.</p>
<p>Sirius frowned, before replying heavily “Remus, I love you. But get the fuck out of my house.”</p>
<p>Remus nodded “It’s him”.</p>
<p>“Sirius!” Lily was shocked.</p>
<p>“Yeh, well. I never said it was my finest hour.” Sirius replied, still hunched over James, not looking at either of them. Remus made a little disapproving noise in the back of his throat and Sirius glanced up, catching his eye.</p>
<p>“Moony, I’m sorry. I really am. I can talk to you about it later. You can yell at me and everything, I promise. But right now I’m trying to make sure Prongs doesn’t die”.</p>
<p>“OK, understood.” said Remus stiffly. He and Lily joined Sirius, kneeling on the floor next to James. “What happened?” said Remus in a much softer tone.</p>
<p>“Long story” said Lily “here, hold Harry for a minute would you? I want to help Pads first before I explain.”</p>
<p>Remus nodded gently taking the sleepy boy, rocking him and lightly rubbing his back in a soothing, slow circular, well practised way. Harry settled sleepily into his shoulder - Remus smiled, the little boy still knew him, even after his time away. Lily shuffled close to her husband, wand in one hand, the other working quickly over his prone form, finally resting lightly on James’s left collarbone. He seemed to settle a little and breath more evenly with both her and Sirius there. Lily smiled and relaxed just a fraction. She looked up at Remus.</p>
<p>“OK, I’m going to explain. Listen carefully, because I think it’s going to have to be you who tells Albus. We desperately need help but I don’t think I even have it in me to summon a patronus, let alone deal with Dumbledore on a mission, I’m just so bloody knackered”.</p>
<p>Remus nodded, “No problem.”</p>
<p>An hour later and Remus was cradling a sleeping Harry while Albus Dumbledore paced the flat. Lily and Sirius had taken James to St Mungos as soon as Dumbledore had managed to ensure there were enough friendly healers present to take care of them. Usually The Order tried not to use the hospital, as the Death Eaters had infiltrated every public institution, even St Mungos. But in the end they had decided it was more dangerous for James to stay away than for him to go. Albus hadn’t really wanted Lily to accompany James, he would have preferred Remus to go, so that Albus could quiz Lily in detail about the attack. Unfortunately for Dumbledore, Lily had had other ideas. The greatest wizard alive he may be, but even Dumbledore wasn’t fool enough to tell Lily Potter she couldn’t accompany a critically injured James to a potentially Death-Eater infested hospital. Taking on and beating Grindelwald at his full strength paled in comparison when measured against arguing with an irate Lily, in Remus’s personal opinion. So Albus was left to glean second-hand information from Remus until such point as James was stable enough for Lily to risk leaving his bedside. Dumbledore stopped pacing and faced Remus, piercing him with his x-ray like gaze.</p>
<p>“So what you are telling me, is that the Potter's asked for Peter Pettigrew’s assistance with their fidelius charm and he was their secret keeper, not Mr Black?”</p>
<p>Remus nodded “Apparently Sirius suggested it as a kind of double bluff. He though Peter would be less likely to be suspected and targeted by the Death Eaters. Sirius was the obvious choice of secret keeper after all - everyone knew he was James’s closest friend and Sirius is a highly accomplished wizard. Where as Peter was less well known and far less skilled magically.”</p>
<p>“Mr Black said that did he?”</p>
<p>“Hmm. He did. Modesty was never really his strong suit…”</p>
<p>“And Mrs Potter confirmed this?”</p>
<p>Remus nodded.</p>
<p>“And neither of them had told you of this before tonight?”</p>
<p>Remus scowled “Correct. Sirius neglected to pass on that relevant detail before this evening”.</p>
<p>There was a short but awkward silence before Dumbledore continued “So Peter must have diverged the secret of the Potter’s safe house to Voldemort?”</p>
<p>“Presumably. Unless there’s another way of breaking a fidelius charm of which I am unaware” Remus replied “but we’ve known for some time that someone close to us was a spy, ever since the Potter’s mission was ambushed last month. Looks like now we know who” said Remus, his voice dripping venom and disgust.</p>
<p>Dumbledore tented his fingers, tips together, and gazed momentarily into space.</p>
<p>“So Voldemort turned up at Godric’s Hollow earlier this evening?” he asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Around 7 o’clock according to Lily. They were just about to put Harry to bed.”</p>
<p>“Did she describe the attack?”</p>
<p>“Yes” Remus launched into a detailed description of Voldemort’s attack, Lily’s heroic defence of her family, the following explosion, and James’s injuries. Dumbledore listened attentively and when Remus had finally finished, he nodded briskly.</p>
<p>“One last question Remus. Did Lily mention what had become of Voldemort’s body?”</p>
<p>Remus looked at him blankly. “No, she didn’t. I think she was a bit distracted by trying to save James’s life to be honest. I guess it must still be at the house. Possibly under quite a lot of rubble, judging by Lily’s description of the explosion.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded once.</p>
<p>“Very well. That is quite enough information to be getting on with. Thank you Remus.”</p>
<p>“Will you be returning to Hogwarts now?” Remus asked, almost hopefully - he was so sleepy.</p>
<p>“Presently” replied Dumbledore “However, first I think it would be wise to collect Voldemort’s body. I will ask Minerva to assist me, on the of-chance that the Potters receive any more unexpected guests.” Remus nodded. Who knew how many Death Eaters the scumbag Pettigrew had told.</p>
<p>“On the topic of company” Dumbledore continued “I think it would be prudent to have another Order member stay with you and Harry tonight, at the very least until either Sirius or Lily are able to return. With that in mind, I have asked Sturgis Podmore to report to this flat as soon as he is able.”</p>
<p>Remus groaned. Podmore wasn’t exactly scintillating company at the best of times and the thought of spending a full night with him was unappealing to say the least. “Is that really necessary? After all, I’m here and the flat is well warded.”</p>
<p>“As was the Potter’s house at Godric’s Hollow. I flatter myself, it may have been even better warded than here” Dumbledore replied, mildly. “I trust you are aware of Voldemort’s interest in the boy?”</p>
<p>Remus was well aware that Voldemort knew of, and believed, the bewildering prophecy that predicted little Harry would be the one to defeat the Dark Lord - this was why the Potters had gone into hiding in the first place. However, Remus refrained from pointing out that a more accurate prophecy might have warned Voldemort against crossing stroppy muggleborn red-headed mothers. Instead he replied evenly</p>
<p>“You think that the Death Eaters will still be interested in the prophecy given the, err... current situation?”</p>
<p>“I think it would be unwise to assume otherwise”.</p>
<p>Remus pulled a face. “Very well. Company for me it is then. Do you know when Podmore is likely to arrive?”</p>
<p>“Shortly, I expect. I will wait here with you until he does.” With that Dumbledore sank gracefully down on to the settee.</p>
<p>“Remus” he said, eyes suddenly alight with something like a wild joy “unless I am very much mistaken, I believe we may have finally won.” Remus stared at Dumbledore speechless. He had been so focused on James, that the full impact of what had happened to Voldemort and the effect this would have on the war they were fighting had escaped him.</p>
<p>“You don’t think the Death Eaters will just re-group under a different leader?” He said hesitantly, after a moment’s contemplation.</p>
<p>“Possibly. But somehow I think not. The Death Eaters have never had a clear second-in-command, Voldemort would not have allowed it. However, we shall soon see.”</p>
<p>Remus didn’t have a reply to that. Could it be that after years of grim battle, with the odds against them ever increasing and their colleges in arms ever diminishing, that the war had finally been won tonight? As glorious as the thought was, it made his head spin. What would a world without war look like? It had been so long that Remus didn’t even know if he remembered.</p>
<p>“I guess we will” he replied finally, nodding slowly into space.</p>
