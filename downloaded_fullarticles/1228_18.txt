          <div class="userstuff"><p class="p1">1. First Year</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean was too excited to sleep. He and his new roommates — one of whom was apparently famous — had spent most of the night getting to know each other. But now the moon shone in through the window and, one by one, the breathing of the other boys had deepened as they drifted off. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean sighed, rolling over in hopes that his mind would let him rest before the first day tomorrow. But as he began thinking again about learning <em>magic </em>and pet rats and toads, a voice caught his attention. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Psst. Hey, you still awake?” The voice said. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean sat up, and found Seamus Finnigan watching him from the bed next to his. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean whispered, “Yeah.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Apparently taking that as an invitation, Seamus climbed out of his own bed and plopped down on Dean’s. He was a small boy, short and round, and he grinned at Dean underneath a freckled nose. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “I can’t sleep either. Too busy thinking about tomorrow, and I’m not used to being away from home.” Seamus said, his Irish lilt pleasant to Dean’s ears. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Same here,” Dean agreed. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> They began talking again, trying to keep their voices low. Dean began to worry out loud about how they would find their classes, whether it would be hard to learn magic, whether they had to take calculus, but Seamus’ Dumbledore impression made Dean laugh so hard that Ron Weasley almost woke up. They smothered their laughter with the pillows. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Got any siblings?” Seamus asked once they had calmed down. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean made a face. “Yeah, three. Younger than me, and all girls. It’s awful.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “I wish I had a brother or sister,” Seamus said. “My da was around for a bit when I was younger, but it’s mostly just been me and my mam.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Really?” Dean said. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus stuck out his chin. “Got a problem with it?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “No!” Dean said hastily. “It’s just, uh, my dad’s gone too.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus blinked. “Oh.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Yeah. He left just after I was born.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “But I thought you had sisters?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Yeah, I’ve got a stepdad. And my sisters— half-sisters, technically.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “That’s cool,” Seamus said. “Do you remember your birth dad?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Usually people got awkward when Dean told them his father had left, but Seamus didn’t seem fazed. His blunt honesty was different, Dean thought, but not in a bad way. No, not bad at all. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Nope. Do you?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus shrugged. “A little. But I was so young when he left that I wasn’t too sad about it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Yeah, same.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> They smiled at each other. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> The new friends talked late into the night, until Seamus was yawning hugely with every other word and Dean could barely keep his eyes open. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> The morning light warmed Dean’s face and he realized with a start that today was his first official day at Hogwarts. Then his eyes truly opened, and he realized that he must have fallen asleep sometime last night when he and Seamus were talking. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> The rest of the dormitory were in various stages of the morning. Neville was sitting nervously on his bed and looked as though he had been dressed for hour. Harry Potter was brushing his teeth, still in his pajamas, and Seamus was pulling on a shirt. Ron was still asleep. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean yawned hugely. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Not you too?” Neville said, sounding somewhat dismayed. “Seamus has been doing that all morning.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus caught Dean’s eye and grinned at him. Dean smiled back. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> 2. Second Year</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “It’s attacking Muggleborns,” someone said. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Anyone one of us could be next,” someone else said. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Do you think it’s Potter? Remember how he turned that snake on that other boy?” A group of students whispered together. “Looks pretty suspicious. I certainly wouldn’t want to cross him.” “Merlin’s beard, can you imagine sleeping next to <em>the Heir of Slytherin?</em>” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus looked worriedly up at Dean, who tightened his jaw but said nothing. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “You okay?” Seamus asked, hurrying to keep up with his long-legged friend. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “I’m fine. C’mon, we have to get to Charms.” </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Later that night, Seamus was woken by the dorm room door swinging closed. He sat up, rubbing his eyes, and peered out of the curtains surrounding his bed. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Sure enough, Ron and Harry’s beds were empty. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Dean?” Seamus whispered. “Neville?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “I think they went on an adventure,” Neville said blearily. “Wish they would do it without waking the rest of us up, though.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Probably off to Petrify someone else,” Dean muttered, so quietly that Seamus almost missed it. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Frowning, Seamus walked over to Dean’s bed as Neville rolled over to go back to sleep. He knocked lightly on the bedpost. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean looked up at him. “It’s open.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus clambered onto Dean’s bed and they sat facing each other cross-legged. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Do you really think it’s Harry?” Seamus asked. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean sighed and looked away. “Probably not. Doesn’t change the fact that someone’s out to get me just ‘cause of my blood status.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Yeah, that sucks.” Seamus pushed at Dean’s legs. “Here, shift over. If anyone wants to get you, they’ll have to go through me.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean laughed but didn’t complain as Seamus lay down beside him. He drew the covers up over them and murmured, “You think you could fight off the Heir of Slytherin?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Sure,” Seamus said. “Remember when I punched Zabini in the jaw last month?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “That was pretty impressive,” Dean admitted. “Wait— you wouldn’t even use magic?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Don’t need to. Just my fists. He wouldn’t even see it coming.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus felt Dean yawn and kept describing how he would defeat the Heir of Slytherin in a fistfight, lowering his voice more and more until Dean’s breathing evened out. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> 3. <span class="s2">Third Year </span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Ron’s scream caused his roommates to bolt up. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “What’s going on?” Dean said. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Sirius Black!” Ron yelled. “With a knife!” And the room erupted into chaos. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Once McGonagall had left, things eventually quieted down. Neville was gone, dragged away by the irate teacher for leaving a list of passwords out for Black to find. Harry and Ron fell back asleep, or lay on their beds trying to relax enough to rest. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> The room was oddly quiet. Dean tossed and turned, trying to figure out what was keeping him from sleep. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean heard the bedcovers shift as Seamus turned over and sighed, and he realized that his friend was still awake. Usually Seamus slept like a rock, and he had the ability to doze off anywhere.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Carefully, so as not to disturb the others, Dean climbed out of bed and padded his way over to Seamus’. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Hey,” he whispered. “You still up?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> A quiet “Yeah,” came from the bed, and Seamus drew back the curtains for Dean to climb up. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus sat up, moving over to give Dean room. Dean settled back against the headboard and wrapped his arm around Seamus. He could feel frantic energy coursing through Seamus’ body. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “What’s the matter?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Sirius Black was just in our room!” Seamus whispered. “You don’t think that’s wild?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean shrugged. “Who is this guy again? I know he killed some people—”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Not just some people, Dean! Hundreds! He’s a mass murderer! And he was inches from us!” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean frowned, trying to make out Seamus’ face in the dark. “Are you excited about this?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “No, of course not! Well, it is kinda cool… but we could’ve died! Black could’ve killed all of us in five minutes and no one would know until they found our bodies in the morning, bloody and gory—.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Seamus.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Sorry.” Seamus leaned against Dean’s shoulder. “Anyway, now I can’t sleep. My mind is going haywire.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> They sat like that for a few minutes until Dean said, “Want to go prank Sir Cadogan?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus sat up and grinned. “Do you even have to ask?” </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> The pair crept back into the dorm ten minutes later as the portrait yelled obscenities after them. They fell back onto Seamus’ bed, trying to hold in their laughter so as not to wake up their roommates. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Feel better?” Dean asked. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> He saw Seamus smile at him. “Yeah. Thanks, Dean.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean elbowed him lightly in the side in response. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Hey,” Seamus said, his voice quieter. “Um, do you want to stay here tonight?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> The moon shone in through the windows and played upon Seamus’ fine hair, casting odd shadows on his face. Seamus wasn’t looking at Dean, instead fastidiously studying the covers beneath them. His fingers picked nervously at a piece of lint. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> It wasn’t often that he sounded vulnerable, wasn’t often that his usual cheer and energy was replaced with uncertainty. Dean felt oddly pleased that he was one of the few people Seamus trusted to see him like this. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Yeah,” Dean said. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> They lay down side by side. Seamus was still small enough that two of them could fit easily on the bed built for one person, although Dean wondered how they would fit in the years to come. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus’ breathing deepened, and he began to snore. Dean felt his eyes start to close and found that he, too, could finally fall asleep. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> 4.<span class="s2"> Sixth Year </span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Dean, we put you up in the spare bedroom down the hall.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Oh, I don’t want to inconvenience you,” Dean said. “I brought my sleeping bag, so I could stay on the floor in Seamus’ room.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Mrs. Finnigan clicked her tongue cheerfully. “Nonsense, it’s no trouble. Besides, you boys are too old now to share a room.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> However excited Seamus had been for Dean’s visit, his mother was ten times more so. Mrs. Finnigan had been cooking and cleaning with a frenzy Seamus had only seen before during Holy Week. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> The last time Dean’s family had went to the Netherlands, he had had an unfortunate allergic reaction to some bad bitterballen, which he had detailed in a wounded tone in his letters to Seamus and for which he had clearly not forgiven the country. Rather than accompany his family back to the place of the insult, he had chosen to stay with the Finnigans.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> On the first day of his visit, Dean was too tired from the journey to do much other than eat dinner and fall asleep. On the second night, however, Seamus waited anxiously until his mother had fallen asleep and her snoring could be heard from down the hall. Soon afterwards, the door creaked open and Dean slipped in. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “I brought snacks.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus grinned and reached for the bag eagerly as Dean climbed up on the bed beside him. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Can you believe we’re going into sixth year?” Dean asked, settling back against the wall. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “S’crazy,” Seamus agreed, opening the popcorn. “Here, try to catch this in your mouth.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean obliged and the piece hit his chin. “That was your fault, that was a bad throw. C’mon, try again.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus did. Eventually they were able to get a piece in Dean’s mouth, although both were laughing so hard that it must have been sheer luck. Dean reached out for a high five, which Seamus gave. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus said, “There’s a piece of popcorn stuck in your hair. No, don’t eat— that’s gross, Dean.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “You’re gross.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus stuck his tongue out. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> They lapsed into silence for a little while. Seamus looked over and caught Dean looking at him. “What?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Nothing. Just thinking.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus said, “Thinking about what?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Nothing. Everything… I don’t know.” Dean sighed. “You-Know-Who, I guess. He’s back, and now everyone knows. People are starting to go crazy.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Yeah, I know,” Seamus said. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean continued on as if he hadn’t heard him. “I put protection spells over my house, over some other houses in the neighborhood. At least, I tried to. I don’t even know if they’ll work. I’m wondering if I should just leave. If they come looking for me, if it gets that bad, I don’t want my family to get hurt because of me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Dean.” Seamus grabbed his friend by the arm and shook him gently. “Hey, Dean, look at me.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean did. The expression on his face was that of a drowning man who had just been pulled out of the water. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus didn’t know what to say to that, so he gave Dean a hug. “It’s gonna be alright. I promise.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “All this crazy shit,” Dean said softly into Seamus’ shoulder. “And still life goes on like nothing is happening. Kids go to school, adults go to work, people fall in love.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> He had turned his head so that his lips were brushing Seamus’ neck as he spoke. Seamus could feel the vibrations in his voice box as Dean spoke. He sighed. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> They shifted closer to each other. Dean’s warm hands traveled up Seamus’ back and came to rest at the nape of his neck, where they stroke the short, bristly hairs there. Seamus felt like there was a balloon in his lungs. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean drew back, and they stared at each other. Seamus felt his stomach flip. He was close enough to see every detail of Dean’s dark, beautiful eyes. They looked like tiny galaxies. Seamus held his breath. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “I’m dating Ginny Weasley.” Dean blurted out. He looked mortified. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Well, crap. If there had been a balloon in Seamus’ chest, the words <em>Ginny Weasley </em>had popped it. Now it was deflating slowly with a pathetic hissing sound. <em>Dean isn’t in love with you, he’s in love with Ginny Weasley. Stupid, Seamus, stupid! </em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Cool, man. Good for you.” Seamus’ voice sounded all wrong even to his ears — strained and too loud. He moved back, away from Dean. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Are you okay?” Dean’s eyes searched his. “I didn’t mean to make things weird.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Stupid, good-hearted Dean. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “It’s fine,” Seamus mumbled. He didn’t want to see the pity in Dean’s eyes and stared at the floor. “I’m just tired. I’m gonna go to bed. See you tomorrow.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Oh… okay. Goodnight.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Once Dean had left, Seamus stared up at his ceiling. Tomorrow, he would be fine. He would ask Dean about Ginny and tease him in the easy way that friends did. Tomorrow, he would have forgotten about this horrible feeling in his gut. And if it was still there, well, tough luck. Seamus wasn’t going to let it ruin their summer. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> 5. <span class="s2">Seventh Year </span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> The Great Hall was filled with noise as the soldiers found their families and friends, hugging and eating and drinking. They had won, and now they would celebrate. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> The Patil twins were sitting in one corner of the room crying, arms wrapped around each other. To Dean’s left the Weasleys waved Ron over to them, to his right a young couple was kissing frantically. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean didn’t see Seamus. He looked around again, dread growing in his stomach. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> A burly man moved aside, revealing a thatch of blond hair standing behind him — <em>there. </em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean was barely aware that he was moving, pushing through the crowd. Seamus looked up as he approached, and Dean hugged him with all the force in his body. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> He heard Seamus grunt as Dean lifted him off the ground, then his arms were around Dean, hugging him back. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> They released each other and Dean grabbed Seamus’ face, looking him over for injuries. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “I’m fine,” Seamus said softly. “I promise.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “I couldn’t find you,” Dean forced out. “I thought—”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “I know.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean leaned his forehead against Seamus’ and closed his eyes. With the adrenaline of the battle gone, Dean suddenly realized how drained and exhausted he felt. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus was watching him. He said, “Want to get out of here?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> There was something in Seamus’ eyes that made Dean’s fingertips tingle. He nodded. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> They made their way up to the dorm, not speaking much. On an impulse, Dean reached over and took hold of Seamus’ hand. Seamus squeezed his hand tight.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Harry was already in the room, lying on his bed and munching happily on a sandwich. He waved at them as they came in, and the other two waved back, all too tired to start a conversation. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> With Harry there, it was awkward. Dean and Seamus stood in between their two beds, unsure of what to do. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Neville walked in, carrying the sword of Gryffindor and looking similarly drained. He set the sword down on his nightstand, climbed into his bed, and pulled the curtains shut. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus motioned Dean over, who sat on the bed and watched as Seamus cast a <em>Muffliato </em>spell so the rest of the room wouldn’t hear them talking. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus had grown up, Dean thought. And it wasn’t just the longer hair or the gauntness of his face or the bruising — (it was lucky for the Carrow twins that they were dead or Dean would have gone out and hunted them to the ends of the earth for what they had done to his boy) — no, Seamus looked more sure of himself. Yes, he also looked exhausted, but he carried himself a little more firmly and stood a little taller. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “I can’t believe it’s over,” Seamus said. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean only nodded. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus sat down crosslegged on his old bed, facing Dean. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “I heard Hermione say they’re going to try to get a Hogwarts program for some of our year who want to complete their education. Would you want to do that?” Dean’s unspoken question hung in the air: do you want me to do that too? </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> But Seamus made a face. “Definitely not. It’s kind of sad, but I don’t think I’ll ever be able to look at this place the same way. This year was like hell. Of course, I don’t have to tell <em>you </em>that.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean reached out and wove fingers together. “Do you know what you want to do, then?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “This might sound crazy,” Seamus said, “but I really want to kiss you. I’ve wanted to for a while now. And after that… well, honestly, I could go for a nap. What do you think?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean’s whole self felt warm, and he realized that he was smiling. “Yeah. Yeah, that sounds alright.” </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">+1. Nineteen Years Later </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean woke up sweating. The war was right behind his eyelids, the flashing lights and screams invading his sleep and making his heart race. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> He got up quietly and made his way into his studio, where the canvasses from his current project hung around the walls. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> The Ministry had commissioned Dean to contribute to a day of celebration and remembrance on the anniversary of the war. The celebration was half a year away, but Dean had already started working. He was pretty sure that Hermione Granger had pulled some strings to push him to the top of a list filled with other talented artists, and he didn’t want to let her down. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean walked around the room, gazing at his drawings. Some were still only sketches, some were closer to completed, some with only a few hints of color here and there to remind him how to fill it in later. All of the paintings were unmoving, in the Muggle style.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> It must have been this project that inspired the nightmares. His dead friends filled the room - not broken and crumpled as they had died, but vibrant and glorious. Alive. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> There was Cedric, flying high on a broom, wind-rumpled and beaming. There were Lupin and Tonks, bending over a baby’s cradle. There was Lavender, smiling wide, her hair teased up and stiff with hairspray. There was Dumbledore, who twinkled up at the viewer over a book. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Dean sighed, wondering if the nightmares would allow him to sleep or if he should stay up. It wouldn’t be so bad to start painting now. The colors for Fred Weasley’s painting had been giving him trouble, and it would be nice to get them locked down before morning. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Strong arms wrapped around his waist, and Seamus rested his chin on Dean’s shoulder. “Bad dreams?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “Yeah.” Dean leaned into the solid warmth of Seamus behind him. “Not sure whether I should try to get more work done now or start again tomorrow.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> Seamus laughed softly. “You’re falling asleep where you stand. Come on, leave it be for now, old man.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “I should—”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> “It’ll still be there in the morning.” Seamus raised himself up to kiss Dean’s cheek softly. “Come to bed.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2"> So Dean did. </span>
