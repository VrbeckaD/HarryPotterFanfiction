  <b>Hello, you!</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>Welcome to whatever the hell this book really is - a little collection of all the sporadic and weird ass story ideas I have gotten over the past few years and decided to put into a little book of their own so I don't have a hundred damned drafts on my page.</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>So, if you couldn't tell by the title, this is a set of story <em>options</em> that you, the reader, can choose/vote on for me to write when I have completed a story that I am currently working on. However, I may not have the time to do so often as I am currently doing a university course.</b>

  <strong>The '</strong>
  <strong>✔' mark on the titles of the chapters means that the marked stories have been uploaded/are completed/are in progress on this website, but may not be on the other websites I post on - Wattpad, Quotev and Inkitt.</strong>
