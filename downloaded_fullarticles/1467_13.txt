    <p>Harry loved being with Mr. Riddle.</p><p>After his parents got divorced, he'd felt lonely, abandoned. Both Lily and James were too wrapped up in their hatred for each other or the pity parties they threw for themselves to pay much attention to their 16 year old son. The summer after the divorce had been particularly bleak, Harry either shutting himself up in his room playing video games and listening to music too loudly, or wandering the streets of his hometown until his feet ached and his lungs burned.</p><p>But all of that changed when his next school year began.</p><p>His friends tried to comfort him with empty words and smiles that were too forced to be reassuring, and a few of his teachers offered their support or leniency should he need it.</p><p>None of them succeeded in bringing Harry any comfort. None except for him.</p><p>Tom Riddle, Harry's History teacher, with his cold blue eyes that seemed to shine red when he was angry, and dark hair and strong, sharp features that betrayed an icy sort of beauty, he was the only one who managed to coax the teenager out of his self imposed exile from the living world, the only one who could get a reaction out of him.</p><p>He offered no sweet words laced with poison, no pitying glances or high marks on half assed projects and homework.</p><p>Instead, he watched with a steady, thoughtful gaze for a week before calling out to him halfway through their lecture.</p><p>"Mr. Potter, stay behind after class, if you will."</p><p>The youth simply raised his head from where he had been bent over the textbook pretending to read the passage on the consequences of World War I, then nodded with a softly murmured, "Yes, Mr. Riddle."</p><p>After class, once everyone had filed out of the room, Harry was left alone with the only teacher that had seemed to leave him alone this year. The man's back was to him as he erased the neatly written words on the board, and when he finished he wiped his hands off and gave the teenager a sharp smile.</p><p>"I'm sure you know why I've held you off, Harry."</p><p>He didn't, not really, but he could hazard a guess.</p><p>"I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention in class, Mr. Riddle." He gave no other explanation, no excuse. He hated using his parents' divorce and subsequent neglect as a reason for his slacking off in classes, no matter how true it was. He didn't want special treatment, he didn't need their pity.</p><p>"That's quite alright, Harry, it's to be expected," Mr. Riddle waved off his apology and Harry sharpened his gaze on the man. "I actually wanted to offer you some extra tutoring. I know you're a brilliant student and your passion for my subject is rarely encountered in students your age, so I'd hate to see it go to waste," the man continued as if Harry hadn't been boring holes into him seconds ago. "Perhaps without the presence of your classmates you will find yourself more comfortable with my lectures."</p><p>Harry mulled it over in his head for a minute, debating with himself, until he gave a sigh and nodded. At least it would be something to get his mind off things at home.</p><p>"Excellent. We'll start today after your classes end."</p><p>The smirk Mr. Riddle gave him sent shivers down Harry's spine and made a familiar heat pool in his belly.</p><p>It wasn't such a surprise when 3 hours later Harry found himself bouncing on Mr. Riddle's cock in his office, holding on to the man's shoulders so as not to fall backwards from the chair they were sitting on.</p><p>"Oh fuck," Harry hissed under his breath as his teacher's cock plunged deeper inside his virgin hole, hitting a sensitive spot that made stars explode behind his eyelids and his thighs quivered in pleasure as yet another orgasm shook his petite body.</p><p>It was the third time he'd come since Mr. Riddle had started having his way with Harry, and the teenager knew he'd have trouble walking home on his own since all the buses had long since left.</p><p>None of that mattered though, as the dark haired devil beneath him yanked on Harry's curls, baring his throat to him, and bit into Harry's neck hard enough to break skin. Mr. Riddle sucked for a few seconds then lapped the remaining blood with his tongue, gave a few more harsh thrusts up into Harry then came with a loud groan, filling him with thick spurts of warm cum.</p><p>Harry remained slumped over his teacher for a good few minutes, still breathing harshly and trembling with the aftermath of so many orgasms. Mr. Riddle stroked his back in an unusual display of tenderness, nuzzling Harry's neck where he'd bitten him and inhaling his scent.</p><p>"You're beautiful," the man whispered, and Harry didn't even try to fight the smile that stretched his swollen lips, the same lips that had been bitten, bruised and sucked on early in their make out session, the same lips that had wrapped oh so innocently around the massive girth of Mr. Riddle's perfect cock.</p><p>Harry pressed a soft kiss to the corner of the man's mouth before he shakily got to his feet, stumbling a little as he put his clothes back on. His partner did nothing more than simply tuck his cock back in his pants and pull up the zipper, as he'd remained clothed throughout their encounter. Harry vowed to get the man naked next time they fucked.</p><p>Next time.</p><p>Was there going to be a next time? He sure hoped so. There was nothing quite like being owned so thoroughly by the man sitting in front of him.</p><p>"You should get home before your mother worries about your absence," Mr. Riddle said as he looked at Harry appreciatively from his seat on his chair. No doubt he was feeling smug about the state of Harry's lips, as well as the darkening mark clearly visible on his neck.</p><p>Harry snorted. "I doubt she's noticed my absence." But he did pick up his school bag and slung it over his shoulder carelessly.</p><p>Mr. Riddle got up from his seat then and approached the teenager, bending down to kiss him fiercely, his hands digging into his waist almost painfully and possessively before letting go. "See you tomorrow after class, Harry."</p><p>Harry smiled so bright his striking green eyes blazed with emerald flames reflecting his excitement, before he nodded and walked out of the classroom with a spring in his step.</p><p>He couldn't wait for his next tutoring session with Mr. Riddle.</p>
