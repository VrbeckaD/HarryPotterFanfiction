    <p>
  <span>Harry rolled his shoulders and stretched in his cozy bed. Last day before the Christmas holidays, so everyone who wasn't staying would be packing by now to head home. He smiled softly to himself, another Christmas at Hogwarts. One of the most magical times of the year in the only place he has truly called home. Soon the castle would be almost empty again. The corridors would be quiet, the common room would be peaceful, and Draco Malfoy would be far far away. If Harry was honest with himself, that last part was what he was most looking forward to. No more childish insults from across the classrooms, the Halls, the Quidditch Pitch, or anywhere else. At least for a little while.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well actually, Draco wasn't quite that bad anymore. Yes he still glared at Harry and insulted him sometimes but his bullying had decreased over the years. Still, Harry was glad he would have a break from him for a little while. Ron snored loudly from the bed beside him and he chuckled softly. He was glad his best friend was staying behind this year as well, along with Nevil, Hermione, Ginny, Luna and a few others. Sitting up he saw that Dean and Seamus had both already packed and were probably in the common room by now. Harry wasn't up late, so he guessed they both got up really early and were probably having some time alone downstairs, as if everyone didn't already know they were together. He decided he would rather not rush to disturb the two of them so he got changed into his uniform slowly before attempting to wake Neville and Ron.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Neville wasn't that difficult to rouse, Harry just shook him once and he was up straight away. Ron on the other hand, that was a more difficult task. First they tried shaking him, but that didn't work. So Harry threw a pillow at him, and that still didn't work. In the end he and Neville decided to see how many things they could stack onto Ron before he woke up. So, chuckling as quietly as possible, they sat on Harry's bed and used Wingardium Leviosa to lift random objects and place them on their snoozing friend. A sock, a shoe, a chair, Dean's trunk, another chair, and finally Hedwig, who squawked when Harry placed her down and caused Ron to wake with a start. Neville and Harry spent the next five minutes laughing their heads off as the various objects clattered to the floor and Ron shouted obscenities at them whilst getting dressed messily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Soon they were all dressed and ready so they headed down to the common room to join the others. Dean and Seamus were blushing into their respective books on opposite sofas and both soon rushed upstairs when the other boys had come down saying something about making sure they had packed everything, as if that was the actual reason. Ginny and Hermione sat on the sofas together laughing about some books they were reading till they heard the boys heading down and Dean and Seamus leave.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Took you long enough." Hermione announced with a raised eyebrow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And we heard a lot of laughing and a huge crash, what happened?" Ginny added. Ron made a disgruntled huffing sound and Harry and Neville had to stifle laughs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nothing really, we were just trying to wake Ron up. As you can tell it took a while." Harry chuckled softly and got a smack on the arm from Ron.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Two bloody chairs! You put two bloody chairs on me!" Harry couldn't hold it in any longer and burst out laughing. Neville decided to list off everything else they stacked on the sleeping Weasley as well, making Ginny laugh and almost getting Hermione to cave too but she held it down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on we need to head down to breakfast before we're late." She said, desperate to be punctual, as per usual. The rest pf the group nodded in agreement but Ron was still annoyed with his rude awakening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm gonna get you back for that, both of you."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Good luck with that Ronald." Ginny teased, "You'd never wake up before Harry, and when he is awake you're no match for him."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh yeah, I forgot you're his number one fan sis." Ron began impersonating her in that rude way only a sibling could get away with. "Oh you're friends with Harry!? Please introduce us I really want to meet him!" That, rightfully so, earned him a hard slap on the arm from his sister. Harry smiled broadly, everything was as it should be in his little friend group, and he couldn't wait to spend the whole Christmas holiday together with them. The whole Castle to themselves! The excitement was almost overwhelming as they all rushed down the moving staircases and along to the Great Hall to take their seats.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore's Christmas speech was excited, cryptic and insane, as per usual, and everyone clapped, as per usual, before the food appeared and they all tucked in. Ron ate way too many bacon sandwiches than Harry thought possible for a human to consume, Neville made a complete mess of his uniform with ketchup, Hermione was reprimanding everyone, and Harry was having the best Christmas already. Unfortunately the icy glares he could sense from across the Hall were a little off putting. Sure enough, when he looked up, Draco and his little gang were glaring at the Gryffindor table. He sneered and smirked at Harry and so Harry pulled as much of a disdainful yet pitying look as he could manage. In a way he was a little sad for the Slytherins that they had nothing better to do than glare at him. He smiled, his mood undamped, and carried on with breakfast.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A few minutes later it was announced that the coaches would be arriving soon, and so the Great Hall began to empty as everyone rushed to check their trunks and gather their remaining things to leave for the holidays. Harry and his friends rushed up as well, all eager to change out of their uniforms, Neville especially, and into their cozy winter clothes. The Castle did get quite cold this time of year but Harry enjoyed that as well. It just meant getting to wrap up warm and cozy by the fire, which just made the whole place feel even more homely. Harry put his dark blue 'H' jumper on that Mrs Weasley made him in first year, he hadn't grown that much since then actually so it still fit him, just a little more snugly than before, with a nice and comfy collared shirt underneath. Ron looked a mess, as always, and Neville was wearing his signature cardigan. They headed back down to meet the girls and Ginny mentioned that she said they would meet Luna down in the Great Hall after they had changed. Harry had no objections to this, Luna was a good friend of his as well and though the common room was cozy, the Great Hall was always a fun place to hang out over the holidays. So he grabbed his chess set and down they went to play a few games and wait for it to snow enough for a properly massive snowball war, the main event they had planned for the holidays. The girls had already decided they would utterly annihilate the boys, and Harry knew this was true, but he would rally the others and put up a good fight nonetheless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, when they reached the Hall, Harry had to stop himself and Ron from exclaming WHAT!? at the top of their lungs. Draco was still sat at the Slytherin table, all alone now, reading a book. Harry dragged everyone to the Gryffindor table, where Luna was sat by the fire, and tried to make them all act normal. Which didn't last long at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What the bloody hell is he doing still here!?" Ron whisper yelled to everyone as Harry tried to set up chess.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It doesn't matter just leave it and lets play." Harry tried to defuse the situation, but it didn't really work.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't know, but I don't like it much." Hermione interjected.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"He never stays behind!" Ginny protested as quietly as she could manage, which wasn't very quiet at all. "Maybe he's planning something horrid?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Maybe we should just stop talking about him." Neville added with a sense of urgency, clearly as uncomfortable as Harry with the idea of discussing this within possible earshot of the boy in question. Harry glanced behind him to check if Draco was looking their direction. He wasn't. His head was still buried in his book and he was clearly focused on it, but Harry still didn't like talking about him when he was so close by.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on guys, let's just play. Neville? Me vs you first?" He asked, trying to lighten the mood. Neville nodded, but the others still seemed stiff in their suspicions and Harry could tell this conversation was, unfortunately, far from over.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The group managed to talk about other things for a little while. Ron even backseat gamed for a little while as Neville and Harry played their game of chess. Neville was actually holding his own pretty well, and Harry was having a good time when Ron didn't interject. Unfortunately, the rest of the group ran out of things to talk about and Ron ran out of frustrating comments to make about the game. So conversation returned to the lone Slytherin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Maybe he's here because we are? He's been sent to ruin our Christmas or something." Ron said accusingly, very obviously staring at the boy in the opposite corner of the Hall. Harry sighed and tried to just carry on with his game, but Neville was clearly getting anxious about the situation as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Guys please just stop. Whatever he's doing it really doesn't matter let's just have a nice Christmas. Please?" But the others were too busy theorising and accusing, and slowly getting louder and louder. Until the inevitable happened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry heard the loud snap of a book closing and fast footfall behind him, and turned to see Malfoy walking quickly towards the entrance of the Great Hall. Feeling guilty about the behaviour of his friends, but against his better judgement, he got up and went after the Slytherin, calling out to get him to wait. "Draco! Wait! Hold on a second!" Much to his surprise, the boy did stop, and wait there until Harry caught up. He was hugging the book close to his chest and still wearing his emerald green uniform. All words suddenly evaded the Gryffindor as he stood opposite his long time arch nemesis. "Uh… um… I just… I was wondering… uhhh…" Draco just stared at him, one eyebrow raised in confusion, but Harry was glad for the silence as he managed to form a full sentence. "I was wondering if you'd like to join us? Play a round of chess or something?" Harry was expecting him to huff in his face and insult him before storming off indignantly. But he didn't. He stood there confused a moment before glancing at the table where the group were sat. Harry followed his gaze and saw Ron, Ginny and Hermione glaring at the Slytherin. Neville and Luna weren't, but still, three glaring people isn't a nice sight to see. He looked back at the boy in front of him apologetically.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I think I'll pass Potter. But thanks I guess." Malfoy sounded almost completely emotionless as he spoke, and for some reason that really hurt Harry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sorry." It was a pitiful attempt at making up for what had happened, but Harry thought it was worth a try.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't worry about it. Maybe another time Potter." And with that he carried on walking off to wherever he was going.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry stood, frozen in place for a moment, unable to comprehend what had just happened. He began to play the conversation over and over again in his mind, looking for the insult, searching for the snark, trying to find the disdain. But he couldn't. It seemed like, for the first time, Draco had given him an actual answer. And even suggested that he might want to play chess with him. The Gryffindor returned to the table with his friends, a million questions still in his head. Could it be some kind of trap? Why? What kind of trap? He sat back down, still a little disoriented. His friends were asking questions but they weren't quite registering.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Harry? Harry!" He flinched and looked over towards the sound to see Hermione's worried face. "Harry what did he say? What happened?" She sounded worried, so Harry huffed a laugh to reassure her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nothing much. I'm fine, don't worry. I just asked if he wanted to join us, and he declined."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And thank Merlin for that!" Ron once again interjected unnecessarily, followed quickly by a loud, "OUCH! Why'd you step on my foot!" Hermione was glaring at him, and Harry was thankful that she at least saw that comment as unwanted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Let's just all move on okay? Leave him in peace and he'll return the favor, okay?" Harry attempted to plead with the group and thankfully this time they all agreed. And so Harry and Neville finished their game. Potter won, but Longbottom put up a really good defence. They laughed and shook hands before it was time for Hermione vs Ginny. Harry tried to pay attention, but his mind kept wandering back to Draco. The way he was acting was so unlike him. Was it just because he didn't have his gang around him? Or was something else going on? And why had he stayed this year for Christmas? He never stayed. Never ever. Not even once. Except for now. Why?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>These thoughts stayed with Harry all day long. Through the rest of their chess games, into lunch, and then on through their walk through the grounds. But the whole time he didn't see the Slytherin again, not even at lunchtime. And for some stupid reason, that worried Harry. Why was he caring? Why did it matter? Why did he matter? The Gryffindor wasn't sure. So the thoughts floated around in his mind waiting for their answers until dinner time, when the blonde finally showed himself again. He still didn't actually have the answers, but now that Draco was in the vicinity he was at least a little less worried.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yet still, during the meal, Harry glanced often behind him to the Slytherin table. Checking to see if he was there, if he was alright, if anything else had changed about him. Throughout the meal Draco kept reading his book, and so Harry made a mental note to find out exactly what book could be interesting him so vividly. Eventually the boy got up, book clutched to his chest, and left the Hall. Harry couldn't handle his curiosity any longer, so he told the others he would meet them in the common room and, without a second thought, followed Draco out of the Hall. He kept a bit of a distance between them in the hope that Malfoy wouldn't notice he was following him. This odd game of hiding and spying carried on all the way to the Library, where Draco entered, and Harry stayed outside a moment in utter bewilderment. Never, in all his years at Hogwarts, had he seen Draco Malfoy go into the library, willingly. Perhaps the Slytherin had done so in the past, but Harry had never seen it happen, so to him this was a very odd occurrence. He went in, acting as though he was there for some other reason than he really was. And found Draco sat at a table in the corner, reading his book. So he went over again telling himself that he was behaving perfectly normally and just looking out for a fellow student or something.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey… didn't expect to see you here." Harry tried, but he sounded as uncertain of those words as he felt. Draco looked up from his book, raised an eyebrow, and smirked in a softer way than usual.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really Potter?" Harry's heart lept, and he suddenly realised what a terrible idea this all was. What if his friends were right, and this was some kind of elaborate plot against them. He was alone, his friends had no idea he was there, and with only his wand he was wildly unprepared for a fight. "Cause I'm pretty sure you followed me here all the way from the Great Hall. Didn't you?" Malfoy's smirk grew a second as Harry flushed slowly more and more red from embarrassment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well I-I… um…" Draco chuckled softly at his utter mess of a response.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Did you need something from me Potter?" The Slytherin nodded his head slightly and Harry decided to take that as permission to sit opposite him, which he did. Sadly, Draco shut his book and put it away before he could see what the title was, so Harry tried to form a decent sentence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, not need anything, no, just… it's about earlier. I expected you to insult me and walk off. Not actually consider the offer, though I'm glad you did." It took Harry all of his effort and focus not to stutter again. Malfoy's smirk softened further until it was more akin to a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Perhaps you just don't know me well enough." It sounded almost like a challenge, and the Gryffindor reacted without truly thinking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Perhaps I should change that." Wait, what was happening!? What was he doing!? Was he trying to flirt with Draco now!? The boy in question just continued to smile softly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's up to you in the end. So why are you here Potter." Harry thought about that for a moment, before coming up with an actually sensible answer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I came to ask if you'd play that game of chess yet. Just me and you." The smirk returned to Malfoy's lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Alright then, let's play."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry set the game up, and the pair played a few turns. But then somehow Draco had him in checkmate. The game had barely begun and already the Gryffindor had lost miserably. He was in utter shock. But Draco was as calm as could be.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Checkmate Potter. Game over." He chuckled softly again and Harry had to suppress the shiver that provoked. Draco looked him up and down a moment before smirking once more. "Thanks for the game. Haven't played properly in a while. And who knows, maybe we could have a rematch. See you tomorrow Potter." And with that the Slytherin winked and left the library. Harry remained there utterly dumbfounded. And one question played on repeat in his mind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>

    <span>Did Draco Malfoy just wink at me?</span>
