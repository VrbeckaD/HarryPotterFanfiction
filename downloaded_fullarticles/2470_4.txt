    <p align="right">June 26<sup>th</sup> 1995</p><p align="justify">Three knocks at the door.</p><p align="justify">Sirius dropped the dirty pan in the water, letting it sink with a splash. Drops fell on the tattered trousers and on the frayed hem of his t-shirt. The slacks were too short for him, and the hem barely reached his ankle. He ignored them and walked towards the door; those protection spells worked so well he hadn’t been able to smell him. Sirius opened the door and stepped aside instinctively to let Remus in. He crossed his arms and wiggled his eyebrows as to remind him of something.</p><p align="justify">Sirius blinked, confused, then understood: “Ah, whatever, Remus. I am going short on dirty, embarrassing questions.”</p><p align="justify">“I am sure you will never get at the bottom of it, Sirius.” His tone was dry, one eyebrow raised.</p><p align="justify">Sirius nibbled at his mouth, tutting, uncapable to hide his smile. Remus leaned one shoulder against the door frame and his thin shirt crumpled slightly.</p><p align="justify">“Please, take your time, it’s only twenty-eight degrees here. If I were a Death Eater, I would have hexed you just out of frustration for making me rot.”</p><p align="justify">“What was the first Shakespeare’s play you made me read?”</p><p align="justify">Remus lifted his eyebrows and Sirius smiled at his surprise: “<em>Hamlet</em>, of course.”</p><p align="justify">“Come in, you tosser.” Sirius stepped back, then turned to get back to the kitchen sink: he was sure that the pan was salvageable. He had never been good at housekeeping spells, never needed them at the Blacks or at the Potters, where house elves – albeit treated differently – did all the work, and after… well, it wasn’t as if a twenty-year-old’s apartment was supposed to be clean, right? Then, Azkaban and caves: housework wasn’t really his first thought. Remus’ cottage though… Remus was tidy and organized and Sirius felt bad messing things up. And he had time. The bloody pan just needed elbow grease. Or maybe Sirius needed to focus on something he could deal with. Like burnt pans.</p><p align="justify">“Where did that come from?” Remus’ voice reached him muffled through the bathroom door. Sirius smiled when he heard the water starting to fill the tub. Another detail: tidy, organised and clean. Remus was all of that, mainly because – Sirius knew – he didn’t want to fit the stereotype of the dirty, savage-looking werewolf. It matched his controlled personality. Control was Remus’ password.</p><p align="justify">“What?” Sirius insisted on one particular spot.</p><p align="justify">“<em>Hamlet</em>.”</p><p align="justify">“You made me think about drama with your monologue about heat wave and Death Eaters.”</p><p align="justify">Silence. Sirius felt the sloshing of the water in the bathtub and inhaled sharply. The sponge was almost completely used up, he ought to change it.</p><p align="justify">“Charming.” Remus said, sarcastic.</p><p align="justify">Sirius exhaled, then laughed, then went back scrubbing, trying not to think too much about Remus’ body in the tub.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><em>sometime</em> July 1978</p><p align="center">“It’s not the Prefects bathroom but…”</p><p align="center">“Sirius, it’s perfect. You didn’t have to…”</p><p align="center">“It was a simple spell, I reckon I just flooded one neighbour’s living room.”</p><p align="center">Laughs.</p><p align="center">The bathtub looked a bit wonky and squashed in the space of a shower, but if you stepped into it you would have find out that it was as big as a normal one. A simple spell. Not so simple, really, but he didn’t feel the need to brag when Remus was around.</p><p align="center">“I still cannot believe we have an apartment.”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p align="right">July 1<sup>st</sup> 1995</p><p align="justify">“It cannot go on like this.” Sirius dropped the embroidered curtain after following with his eyes the limping figure of Alastor Moody walking down the walkway and then on the main road, before disapparating.</p><p align="justify">He turned towards Remus when he didn’t answer. He still held a glass of Firewhisky – how many did he have? Sirius didn’t pay attention – his hazel eyes staring at the embroidery as if he didn’t really see it. Sirius followed his gaze: the curtain seemed worn, like almost everything else in the house, but it was still pretty: little daisies decorated the hems. They weren’t something you would expect in a bachelor’s accommodation, but Sirius guessed they were there before he arrived. Maybe Remus’ mother had sawn them. Maybe that was why he kept them.</p><p align="justify">“Remus.” He said.</p><p align="justify">He started, his eyes refocusing on Sirius: “Pardon? Sorry, I spaced out.”</p><p align="justify">“This, it cannot go on like this.” Sirius gestured towards the window.</p><p align="justify">“What?” Remus’ attention seemed diverted. He gulped down the whisky and moved to the table to tidy up the mess of maps and parchment they had accumulated.</p><p align="justify">“People coming and going from the house. Someone will notice.” He paused. “Your neighbours already noticed. I heard them gossiping and chatting today.”</p><p align="justify">Remus lifted his eyes from the mess, his voice was slightly different when he spoke: he sounded mildly irritated: “You went to the village? Sirius, I already told you, people may recognise you, you were on Muggle news last year.”</p><p align="justify">“I went out as Padfoot.” It came out sharper than he intended but Remus didn’t flinch.</p><p align="justify">“You have to be more cautious.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius dismissed the sentence with a wave of his hand: “The point is, Remus, they start noticing that odd people come and go from your house at strange times of the day. If Muggles notice, they gossip, and when gossip starts, you don’t know who will hear it.”</p><p align="justify">Remus licked his fingertips and put one of the candles out pressing the wick between his thumb and index. Sirius knew he was perfectly able to do it with a bored gesture of his hand, but sometimes Remus liked doing things the Muggle way, it probably made him feel more down-to-earth.</p><p align="justify">“It’s temporary.” He said, without lifting his gaze, “Dumbledore will set up a system of safe houses, like last time. When things will be settled, we will be more organised.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius scoffed: “Because last time worked so well.” He said darkly.</p><p align="justify">This time, Remus winced, took a deep breath, then went back rolling up one of the parchments, without answering to Sirius’ provocation.</p><p align="justify">“I’m just saying,” Sirius walked to the table and started helping him, just to find something to do with his hands, “I think it’s dangerous. Death Eaters…”</p><p align="justify">“If Death Eaters wanted to, they would have already blown up this house.” He interrupted, “It’s not really a secret that this was my father’s last address.” There was a tone of finality in Remus’ words, as if he didn’t want to talk about that anymore.</p><p align="justify">But Sirius knew it was important. He knew they had to do something. <em>He</em> had to do something. He couldn’t stand to stay still, and waiting, and watch Remus coming and going to look for old acquaintances to recruit for the same, lost cause – who was left, really? In the week he’d stayed there, his main job had been, well, housekeeping. And the occasional retelling his story to the members of the Order that had appeared in the fireplace or that had come by for short, hushed meetings. <em>Lie low at Lupins.</em> Dumbledore had said. And he had, Merlin’s beard, but he felt he had to do something more than tie his hair and occasionally shop for groceries when the Tesco at the village wasn’t too crowded.</p><p align="justify">Once the parchments were all gathered and filed, Remus made them disappear with a flick of his wand, then looked at Sirius as though expecting him to say something else.</p><p align="justify"><em>You are just like a dog with his bone</em>, James had said once, <em>you cannot let things go</em>.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Fuck you, Prongs.</em>
</p><p align="justify">He needed to think. He grabbed a pack of fags and headed to the backdoor.</p><p align="justify">“Sirius,”</p><p align="justify">“I’m just going to feed Buckbeak.” He mumbled, without looking at him. He pulled down the handle, but the door didn’t open. Bloody protection spells. He turned to get his wand, <em>where the hell did he put it?</em> He still wasn’t used to have a wand again: it wasn’t his original one – that had been broken in half when he had been sent to Azkaban without a trial – and it didn’t feel quite right yet. After thirteen years without being able to channel his magic in the familiar stick, everything felt a bit out of his control. Sometimes he produced accidental magic – like children do. He had lost count of how many oil lamps had exploded in his distracted attempts to do basic things like turning the lights off at night-time.</p><p align="justify">“Here.” Remus handed it to him, holding it by the tip.</p><p align="justify">It was fifteen inches, dogwood – he imagined Dumbledore had fun with the choice – and dragon heart strings – like his first one. Sirius nodded to thank him and curled his fingers around the handle. He could feel the magic buzzing softly in his veins, like a radio trying to get a signal. He pointed the wand at the door and mumbled a few counterspells. The door shook violently but the glass didn’t shatter like the other twelve times he’d tried. <em>Call it a win</em>.</p><p align="justify">Sirius stepped out and took a mouthful of the salty, marine breeze. Buckbeak was dozing off in a corner of the messy back garden. Sirius reached him and sit on the ground, leaning against his warm side: the temperature was still high, and the earth felt warm, after being exposed to the sun all day.</p><p align="justify">“You are getting lazy, old friend.”</p><p align="justify">Buckbeak screeched quietly and shifted.</p><p align="justify">Sirius chuckled darkly: “Alright, alright, we both are.”</p><p align="justify">He tilted his head back, looking at the stars. It was a beautiful night. The sky looked a bit out of focus because of the bubble of protective spells that isolated them and prevented Muggles from noticing a huge half-eagle-half-horse beast in the backyard of the polite son of dearly departed Lyall Lupin. Who knew what they would have thought of him if they had noticed he was harbouring a fugitive? As Padfoot, he had eavesdropped a conversation between the old lady that lived at the other extremity of Bridgend and her friend. She had asked if she was the only one who had noticed that odd bloke who was hanging out at sweet Remus’ place.</p><p align="justify">“He must be a <em>friend</em>.” The other woman had answered with a knowing look.</p><p align="justify">“Not that kind of friend, surely!” Remus’ neighbour had protested, scandalised.</p><p align="justify">“Well, he isn’t married, is he? At that age! And have you seen that man’s hair? He must be one of <em>those men</em> from the city.”</p><p align="justify">“Shut up, Aberfa. Lyall was a good man. I am sure young Lupin is just helping out a stray.”</p><p align="justify">At that point, a flock of pigeons had attracted Padfoot’s attention and the conversation suddenly had seemed less interesting. Thinking about it, later, overcoming the initial amusement at the hints about the nature of their relationship, Sirius had started brooding over it: if the old hags were upset by him, how would they react to Mad-Eye Moody? He had already come by three times that week. Moreover, Remus had left his job at the local library – <em>They were going to sack me anyway after the next moon</em>. – and he had spent the precedent week coming and going in the company of the most peculiar crowd. Lyall Lupin’s cottage was isolated but not <em>that</em> isolated. Moreover, despite what Remus had said about Death Eaters already knowing about the place, Sirius thought they were just organising themselves, regrouping, after the Triwizard Tournament half-fiasco – not differently from what Dumbledore was doing with the Order: recruiting, establishing a web of contacts and spies. When they would attack– Sirius closed his eyes and a huge, intimidating Dark Mark made of green smoke hovered menacingly over the quiet image of the starry sky above the cottage. Besides, there was the Ministry business: Dumbledore didn’t want Fudge to know he was plotting behind his back, didn’t he? And a visit of the Magical Law Enforcement for violations to the Statue of Secrecy…</p><p align="justify">“You forgot the food.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius flinched and opened his eyes: Remus was looming over him, an old-looking plastic bucket in his hand.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah. I… maybe I should fly him around a bit.” He only did it once since he arrived: on the new moon, when the sky had been dark and cloudy. It had been three days before: Remus had been away, at a meeting with a new recruit of the Order, an Auror of the Ministry.</p><p align="justify">“Sirius,”</p><p align="justify">“Stop ‘Siriusing’ me, Remus.”</p><p align="justify">He sighed and abandoned the bucket in a corner, keeping an eye on Buckbeak who was becoming twitchy at the smell of fresh blood. To distract him, he bowed a bit awkwardly without breaking the eye contact, and Buckbeak bowed back absent-mindedly. Remus sat beside Sirius, scratching the head of the hippogriff with a hand.</p><p align="justify">“Why are you so fidgety?” he asked calmly.</p><p align="justify">Sirius glared at him. He wasn’t. He just didn’t understand because nobody else was.</p><p align="justify">“I’m not fidgety.” He said, through gritted teeth. “As usual, nobody takes me ser– oh, for fuck’s sake.”</p><p align="justify">Remus chuckled, hiding his smile with a hand.</p><p align="justify">“Forgive me,” his eyes were a light shade of brown “it has been a while, since I heard that joke.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius was suddenly torn between fondness and pain. He cleared his throat.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, well, been old for a while too.”</p><p align="justify">They stood quiet for some minutes, the only noises were the soft shrieks of Buckbeak, that was becoming restless and scratching the dirt, and the chirrup of nocturnal insects. Sirius didn’t know if they would ever manage to have a conversation that didn’t end in silence and in painful memories. Probably not. Also, if they abandoned that careful tiptoeing around each other, they would probably make something blow up – the house or their heads. After that night in the Shack, after those first, glorious moments in which everything seemed right in the world – Harry was going to come live with him, Peter was going to be shipped to Azkaban, Sirius’ name was going to be cleared and Remus… Remus’ arms had enveloped him in such a tight embrace that Sirius had thought his bones would break and he would be glad if they did – everything had disappeared. Crumbled down. He should have been used to it, really, at that point. He opened the pack of cigarettes and took one out, balancing it between his lips. He gave Remus a sideways glance: he seemed calm and collected, but Sirius did recognise the nervous irritation that grew sometimes under his skin. It was often oriented towards him, even if Remus tried to hide it. He lifted his wand to light the cigarette and hoped not to set fire to his eyebrows. Remus was faster and snapped his fingers. They looked at each other: it was a trick Sirius had taught him a long time ago. He breathed out the smoke directly in Remus face and he coughed, pushing against his shoulder with his own.</p><p align="justify">“Tosser.”</p><p align="justify">Even Buckbeak seemed to side with Remus and looked at Sirius with reproach.</p><p align="justify">They shared the fag in silence, until it was consumed. Sirius threw the butt over the fence, but the protection spell made it bounce back inside and it got lost in the wild fennel bushes near the right end side.</p><p align="justify">“Your neighbour thinks we are shagging.”</p><p align="justify">“Dumbledore values you, Sir– <em>what</em>?”</p><p align="justify">They had talked at the same time.</p><p align="justify">Sirius burst into a laugh at Remus’ comical expression. His eyes were huge, and his moth hung open and he had stopped petting Buckbeak, so his hand was awkwardly mid-air.</p><p align="justify">“How do you know?!”</p><p align="justify">“Told you I overheard them talking.” He shrugged, taking another fag from the paper package. He felt better after one, less nervous, less ready to jump at every sentence. Even Remus mentioning Dumbledore didn’t get to his nerves as it would normally. It wasn’t like he didn’t trust Dumbledore – he did. He had followed his orders without complaints not even a fortnight before, but they hadn’t heard from him since. Remus had combed half Great Britain to gather those poor wretches that had survived the First War, barely slept, had his house invaded by people at every time of the day and the night and Dumbledore had not even bothered to send a thank you card. He looked at the cigarette and put it back in the package.</p><p align="justify">Remus groaned: “What did they say? And who are <em>they</em> anyway? Mrs Griffiths?”</p><p align="justify">Sirius was quite enjoying this flustered version of Remus; he had almost forgotten it: “I guess, the one at the end of the road. Her friend is as old, curly hair, always crocheting.”</p><p align="justify">Remus looked horrified: “Oh no, that’s Miss Davies. She is a nightmare. Used to sneak Harmonies in Psalms copies and run.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius lifted his eyebrows: “Miss? And she dared being shocked that – listen – at your <em>age</em>,” he emphasised, feigning outrage “you aren’t <em>married</em>. So, you must be – how is the word?”</p><p align="justify">The woman didn’t say it explicitly, but a part of him wanted to hear Remus speak with that pretty accent he had sometimes – when he was tired, exhausted.</p><p align="justify">“Hoyw.” Remus said flatly.</p><p align="justify">Sirius smirked.</p><p align="justify">It was fun seeing Remus so preoccupied because of something so insignificant. The problem with Remus had always been that he cared too much about what people thought of him. Of course, that had been because he was constantly judged: for his shabby clothes, his scars, his sickly appearance.</p><p align="justify">He nudged him, trying to cheer him up: “Apparently, I’m one of <em>those men</em> from the city.”</p><p align="justify">Remus frowned: “What men?”</p><p align="justify">Sirius shrugged, he had no idea: “Those men, Moony. With the <em>hair</em>.” He wiggled his eyebrows and finally Remus grinned, shaking his head.</p><p align="justify">“If it makes you feel better, Mrs Whatever didn’t believe you are a nothing but sweet Remus who takes care of a charity case.”</p><p align="justify">Remus bumped his heel against Sirius’ ankle, and he noticed they were both barefoot: “Well, I kind of am.” He said, teasingly.</p><p align="justify">Sirius tackled him.</p><p align="justify">Bantering with Remus was odd and strangely familiar. Sirius felt younger, lighter, when they did. It felt like years had been lifted from his shoulders, as if he could forget for a moment that he was a convicted criminal on the run, that he had lived of rats for a year, that he was putting Remus in danger by staying at his place as though he was an old acquaintance couch surfing for a little while. Also, he could forget they were faking familiarity. They were just too scared to face everything left unsaid between them. They pretended like the weak excuses they exchanged in the Shack were enough to solve fourteen years of silence and pain and loneliness. It was easy to forget, when Remus laughed from the heart – it was raspy and throaty, like he wasn’t used to it – , begging him to stop tickling. It was like going back to Hogwarts.</p><p align="justify">Sirius spared him when he yielded. He abandoned himself on the dry ground, eyes up to the sky. They were both breathless, as if they had run a marathon. Bloody fags. Somewhere, to his right, he could hear the squelching sound of Buckbeak munching the dead rats Remus had brought outside. He had waited until they were both distracted and took the chance. Smart chap. Well, no flying for that night.</p><p align="justify">Sirius tilted his head and noticed with some surprise that Remus was looking at him.</p><p align="justify">“What?”</p><p align="justify">The atmosphere had suddenly changed.</p><p align="justify">Sirius’ breath hitched in his throat. Remus’ eyes were slightly unfocused – for the alcohol, maybe. He asked himself again how many shots of whisky Remus had gulped down without thinking, that night: eyes on the maps and Mad-Eye muttering of spies and Ministry business. He knew he had no right to question it, nor he wanted to. He couldn’t really imagine how it had been for Remus. Sometimes, there was no other way to cope with everything, he knew it very well.</p><p align="justify">He had missed it in Azkaban: being able to forget, for a few hours, to escape at least his own mind prison. The truth was, you cannot really escape from Azkaban, not even after you actually manage to, first prisoner ever to break the gates and everything. Even after two years, sometimes he opened his eyes in the middle of the night, lying on Remus’ worn out sofa and couldn’t see anything but darkness. Sometimes he sneaked out in the lawn and curled up against Buckbeak to try and get some sleep and then lied about waking up early to snatch a couple of freshly baked scones from the bakery in the village as Padfoot. A part of him thought that if he killed Peter, he would gladly go back in prison because in the end it was where he belonged, because he <em>had</em> killed Lily and James, persuading James to choose Peter as Secret Keeper out of arrogance, and he <em>had</em> betrayed Remus thinking he was the spy.</p><p align="justify">“Sirius,” Remus voice came soft, a bit fuzzy “even if you are angry all the time and we have disagreements and we do not really talk because there is too much unsaid that…” he paused again “let’s say, that would change things”  <em>if they abandoned the careful tiptoeing around each other, they would probably make something blow up – the house or their heads</em> “and I do not really know where we stand… even if maybe we do not know each other anymore…” his eyes looked very bright now “I am happy you are here.”</p><p align="justify">Remus’ voice was soft and hoarse at the same time. Sirius’ ears were whistling. Buckbeak was still munching and he could hear all the small bones breaking under his powerful jaws. Sirius felt seventeen again, as though they were at Hogwarts, after the full moon, waiting for the sun to rise. He felt like he knew Remus better than he knew himself, like before, when his life was made of rock-hard certainties: loyalty, friendship, courage. Impetuosity.</p><p align="justify">He propped himself on his elbow and kissed him.</p><p align="justify">Remus inhaled sharply and instinctively lifted a hand to push him away, but then he relaxed visibly, and that same hand curled on the front of Sirius’ shirt, grasping the thin fabric, pulling him closer. Sirius felt his palms sliding on the dry ground, he would probably have scratches there soon, but it wasn’t as he cared. He was kissing Remus. That thought alone was enough to make him blank on everything else. He was kissing Remus after almost fourteen years and it felt glorious. It probably wouldn’t win Best Kiss 1995 at those American Awards he had watched on Remus’ old telly: it was uncomfortable and messy, and their teeth kept colliding in odd ways, but it was mind-blowing.</p><p align="justify">Suddenly Buckbeak made a low shriek and they broke off abruptly, almost at the same time. The back of Remus’ head thumped against the yellow grass and he frowned. Sirius sat up, his breath laboured. Buckbeak nudged him with his head and an animalistic, upset part of Sirius really craved chicken. He patted him, quickly, making a face when he noticed his hand was now sticky with the blood of dead rats. Sexy.</p><p align="justify">Remus got up and cleared his throat, he sported an odd expression that Sirius wasn’t able to read properly: was he angry?</p><p align="justify">“We should,” he croaked, then tried again “We should get in. Buckbeak has eaten, you can bring him out for a flight tomorrow. It is supposed to be cloudy.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius nodded, still on his knees, unable to do anything else. He felt dizzy.</p><p align="justify">“I’ll be there in a minute.” He managed, when it became painfully clear that Remus was waiting for an answer.</p><p align="justify">He nibbled at his lower lip, then nodded, turning his back on Sirius and walking inside.</p><p align="justify">Sirius breathed out and went back stroking Buckbeak sticky front.</p><p align="justify"><em>You are just like a dog with his bone</em>, <em>you cannot let things go</em>.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Shut up, James.</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><em>sometime</em> autumn 1978</p><p align="center">He was drunk and he was kissing Remus Lupin.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p align="right">July 2<sup>nd</sup> 1995</p><p align="justify">A letter from Harry did the trick.</p><p align="justify">It arrived the following morning, while Sirius was checking on the hash browns like his life depended on it and Remus was showering. Checking on the hash browns and Remus showering were two things closely connected.</p><p align="justify">The night before, Sirius hadn’t returned inside the house. He had changed into his Animagus form and curled against Buckbeak. Sleeping as Padfoot was easier: his thoughts were less complex, and he managed to fall into the arms of Morpheus more quickly. When he had entered the kitchen, the morning after, Remus was defrosting hash browns with a charm Sirius had never heard before. He had lifted an eyebrow as to say: <em>No scones?</em> and Sirius had understood that he knew all along.</p><p align="justify">He had muttered a good morning and went showering as quickly – and coldly – as possible.</p><p align="justify">When he had come back to the kitchen, Remus took his place, a silent order to supervise the hash browns.</p><p align="justify">Harry’s letter arrived in the precise moment in which Sirius started losing his focus – he could still feel Remus’ chapped lips against his, but his head was messed up and he couldn’t understand if he was remembering this kiss or the ones’ in his fragmented memories. The window was open – outside it was already more than twenty-five degrees and soon they ought to re-do the refrigeration charms because the heat would become unbearable during the day. Sirius just hoped he wouldn’t trigger a snowstorm like the first time he’d tried. Hedwig slipped inside with a whirl of feathers and Sirius smiled, offering her some stale bread drenched in milk. She seemed resented. Sirius rolled his eyes: “We cannot be all wealthy like the Potters’ heir.” He told her, amused.</p><p align="justify">The letter was short and mostly composed of questions: Where was Voldemort? Did he already kill? The Muggle news didn’t say anything about odd disappearances. What was Dumbledore doing to stop him? When could they meet? Was he safe? What about the Death Eaters? The Dursleys were horrible as usual, they had locked away his Firebolt and all of his school things. Sirius’ eyes lingered on the short sentence Harry had written about his broom. He thought about Crookshanks and the day in which he had bought Harry the Firebolt. He thought about Hedwig who was cooing unsatisfied at the top of the kitchen counter. <em>We cannot be all wealthy like the Potters’ heir.</em> He thought about how unfair was that Harry had to live with those horrible Muggles. <em>Once my name’s cleared… if you wanted a… a different home…</em></p><p align="justify">There was a house, old and abandoned and full of magic in the centre of London. He wasn’t thinking about that when he had proposed Harry to go live with him, but…</p><p align="justify">“Remus!” he exclaimed, abandoning the owl and the hash browns, and grasping the letter more forcefully.</p><p align="justify">He banged on the bathroom door a little too vehemently.</p><p align="justify">“What the hell, Sirius?” came from the inside.</p><p align="justify">“I know it. I know a house. A convenient one. I reckon I can…” he stopped “Can you come out, for Merlin’s sake? Or shall I keep yelling at a closed door?”</p><p align="justify">A sloshing sound. Then the tapping sound of bare feet on the tiles, shuffling. The door opened slightly: “What are you talking about?”</p><p align="justify">Sirius pushed against the creaking wood and stormed inside the small bathroom. There was barely space for the two of them. He waved the letter: “Last time we were scattered. The Order kept changing places to meet and they found us every time, in the end, because we couldn’t be sure that all our meetings were secret, right?”</p><p align="justify">Remus’ expression hardened: “They weren’t because Peter diligently reported to Voldemort.” He said, coldly.</p><p align="justify">“That too.” Sirius agreed “But also because we were all over the place. We used to put out general spells just for the occasion, quickly. We almost never managed to be there, the whole Order at the same time, at meetings. We had documents disseminated everywhere, even without Wormtail I am sure some of them ended up in the wrong place.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius could see that Remus did not see the point yet, but he didn’t say anything and so he went on.</p><p align="justify">“We need headquarters. Not only safe houses.”</p><p align="justify">Remus opened and closed his mouth: “I guess,” he said slowly, hesitating. Sirius knew he was reflecting as fast as possible, trying to find a reason for which having headquarters could not be the best idea.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>He always thinks too much, doesn’t he, Padfoot?</em>
</p><p align="justify">Sirius was growing impatient, little James in his head was right, it wasn’t the moment to overthink stuff. <em>Come on, Moony.</em></p><p align="justify">“But I cannot imagine anyone offering their home for such a perilous… and anyway Death Eaters know where most of the members of the Order live.”</p><p align="justify">“I do. I can offer a place.” He said quickly “The Death Eaters would never think about it, at least not immediately.”</p><p align="justify">“What place?” Remus asked, confused.</p><p align="justify">Sirius knew he was thinking about the apartment they had shared in Camden during the war. He wondered what had become of it after his arrest. But no, that wasn’t the point.</p><p align="justify">“Grimmauld Place.” Sirius said triumphantly. “I am the last male heir of the line, even if disowned. I am pretty sure the house will recognise me as its legitimate owner.”</p><p align="justify">Remus opened his mouth, then closed it. Sirius could hear the gears moving in his brain: he was thinking as quickly as possible, trying to find faults in his plan. When he spoke, his voice was soft, calibrated: “But Sirius, do you really want to go back there?”</p><p align="justify">Sirius took a step back. Flashes exploded in his mind: snakes and silver and heavy rugs, Regulus crying, his mother swearing, the cold stare of Orion Black, half-naked Muggle girls’ photographs up on his bedroom wall, an old cellar, a trunk thrown in the middle of the road, red and gold fabric scattered around the pavement, drenched with rain. He shrugged: “Don’t worry about me. You know it’s a good plan.” He tried to match Remus’ controlled behaviour.</p><p align="justify">When he spoke, Remus’ voice was the most sincere, full of emotion sound Sirius had heard in years: “I always worry about you, Padfoot.”</p><p align="justify">In that moment, Sirius became painfully aware of the fact that Remus was naked except for a pale-yellow towel that had seen better days. His gaze lingered: his chest was beaded in droplets and was covered in scars, but not as many as Sirius would have expected after fourteen years. He remembered that once he could recognise every one of them, he knew where each one of them came from. Now they all entangled in an unrecognisable spider web. His skin was pale, and he was thin, he could see he blue lines of his veins. He felt the irresistible need to grab his wrist to check his pulse. He didn’t realise he had acted until he felt the constant, familiar sound against his thumb. Remus’ fingers – his long, bony fingers, always with well-trimmed nails – caressed gently his skin. Sirius pulled and Remus lost his balance and they collapsed one against the other, almost slipping on the floor. They kissed fiercely and Sirius laughed against Remus mouth when he started having problems in touching Sirius and keeping the towel up around his hips at the same time. Remus mumbled something that sounded like <em>Git.</em> and Sirius tilted his head back, smirking cockily: “It’s coming off anyway.”</p><p align="justify">“You,”</p><p align="justify">Remus pushed him in the general direction of the couch, that was the nearer horizontal surface that wasn’t the floor. Sirius stumbled back and took off his – well, Remus’ – shirt.</p><p align="justify">“are”</p><p align="justify">They both fell badly on the sofa and Sirius bumped his head against a small table with short legs that had stopped being trendy in the early fifties. He groaned. Remus looked at him as to say <em>That was well deserved</em>. Then he straddled him, so Sirius’ brain didn’t get enough blood to think of a proper comeback.</p><p align="justify">“an arrogant prick.” He concluded, before leaning in to kiss him.</p><p align="justify">It wasn’t gentle, or romantic. It had never been, with them. They never had the time to do things properly, to spend precious moments studying each other’s bodies, concentrating on what felt good, what felt <em>really</em> good, and what felt just okay. Sirius had never thought anything could feel just okay with Remus, anyway. He moaned when his teeth scratched his abdomen, when his trousers and pants were taken off and Remus’ mouth was on his prick, hot and wet and, well, surely not <em>just okay</em>. He wasn’t going to last. He thought <em>Stop him, you have time, take your time, stop him</em>. But they never had. They still didn’t, in a way. The conversations that they were avoiding were looming over them.</p><p align="justify">“Moony.” He managed, rough and breathless, a hand on his shoulder “Up here.” He babbled.</p><p align="justify">Remus lifted his head and Sirius had to close his eyes as a rush of arousal went through his body like a lighting bolt. Somewhere, a lamp exploded. Remus smiled and shook his head slightly. Sirius’ hand was sweaty and slipped on his skin as he tried to drag him up. <em>I want to touch you. I want to remember how it feels.</em></p><p align="justify">The hash browns burnt.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p align="center"><em>sometime</em> winter 1979 or spring 1979 or summer 1979 or autumn 1979</p><p align="center">Remus’ eyes were closed, and Sirius’ left hand was pressed against his mouth. He was kissing his neck, just below his Adam’s apple and his hand was moving quickly on his shaft. Sirius liked the rush of this, the adrenaline – or was it magic? – that run in his veins at the thought that anyone could walk on them. But Sirius liked it best when Remus’ eyes widened – dark and glossy and looking up at the night sky – and he could feel his mouth moving against his palm, and his limbs tense and…</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p align="justify">Sirius spent the afternoon scrubbing the pan, while Remus kept busy flooing his head through the chimneys of half-Great Britain. Dumbledore’s Patronus – a majestic silver phoenix – appeared around teatime, bringing his master’s answer. Remus looked at him when the solemn voice of the Headmaster announced he was going to visit. <em>Are you sure?</em> His eyes were asking. Sirius nodded and Remus gave the go-ahead. Sirius looked at the dark red spot near his clavicle and wondered if he should tell him before Dumbledore arrived. A part of him didn’t want to. He wanted exactly to see the look on Dumbledore’s face when he would notice it. He wanted to look him in the eye, challenging him to say something. But then he thought about Remus and his desire to always look presentable and collected. He cleared his throat as an incorporeal Patronus wriggled out from the tip of Remus’ wand and disappeared and tapped on his own cleavage to make him understand. Remus’ cheeks became a pretty shade of pink. He pointed his wand at himself and murmured some enchantment without looking at Sirius.</p><p align="justify">As he was drying the pan, he thought about Remus’ words the night before: <em>Even if we don’t really talk…</em> He thought about all the times he had reached Remus during the full moon, the year before, keeping it a secret from everyone else: Yorkshire, Avon, Cornwall, Surrey, Scotland. They almost never talked. He thought about the hurried apology at the Shack, their wands already aimed at Peter.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Wouldn’t Sirius have told you they’d changed the plan?</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter. I assume that’s why you didn’t tell me, Sirius?</em>
</p><p align="justify">Remus’ tone had been practical, straightforward.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Forgive me, Remus.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Not at all, Padfoot, old friend.</em>
</p><p align="justify">He hadn’t looked him in the eye. Sirius wondered if it meant something. It was too fast. He wondered if twelve more years would be enough to forgive something like that.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>And will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you were the spy?</em>
</p><p align="justify"><em>Of course</em>. He had said, automatically, his attention all focussed on killing Peter.</p><p align="justify">He looked at Remus, that was writing down something on a parchment with his regular handwriting.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Will you, in turn, forgive me?</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>In turn.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Like they were bargaining. <em>Do ut des</em>.</p><p align="justify">His train of thoughts was interrupted by the arrival of Albus Dumbledore, coming out from the chimney in a prodigious blast of green flames. They both moved towards him automatically.</p><p align="justify">James’ voice crept back in his thoughts: <em>You are just like a dog with his bone</em>, <em>you cannot let things go</em>.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p align="right">July 3<sup>rd</sup> 1995</p><p align="justify">It was him and Remus and Alastor Moody and Albus Dumbledore.</p><p align="justify">They stood in the small square in front of numbers eleven and thirteen and Sirius tried to swallow the huge lump he felt in his throat. When he did, he felt Remus’ fingers gently stroke his knuckles. He didn’t look at him. He couldn’t think about that too: what it meant, what was going on with them. <em>I don’t know were we stand.</em> The stalemate was oddly familiar.</p><p align="justify">Sirius took a deep breath, then closed his eyes and focussed on his memories of the house: the grey stones, the door with the snake-shaped knocker, the marble steps.</p><p align="justify"><em>Good man, Padfoot</em>. James’ voice said in his head.</p><p align="justify">Sirius opened his eyes and number twelve started taking space between number eleven and number thirteen, pushing and prodding with arrogant force. Very befitting.</p><p align="justify">“Expected something more from the Noble and Most Ancient, Sirius.” Moody growled with a half-smile that made his face look like an abstract painting. He limped towards the steps and Dumbledore followed with a benign expression, his deep blue robe floating like a cloud around him.</p><p align="justify">Sirius felt glued to the pavement. He was sweating, probably not a glamorous sight. It was so hot, even after dark. Last time he had been there, it had been summer too, even if it was considerably less warm. His stuff had been scattered all around the place, his trunk half smashed. His mother screaming at the top of her lungs from the door, Regulus looking at him with a stone-cold expression from the window at the top left. No less than five Muggles had peeked out of their windows and Orion had hexed them all. He imagined a whole squad of Obliviators had to be sent, after the eventful evening. Now, everything was dark and grim. Dumbledore had turned off all the street lights with his clever gadget.</p><p align="justify"><em>Man up, Black</em>. James said in his head.</p><p align="justify">He closed his eyes again and noticed that his hands were shaking. A part of him, the beautiful teenager he once was, wanted nothing more than run. <em>James, James, where are you?</em></p><p align="justify">“He’s dead.” He whispered to himself, “Been dead fourteen years.”</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Man up, Black.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Remus was still at his side and Sirius knew he had grasped his laboured murmuring: “Padfoot, you don’t have to. If you’re not ready…”</p><p align="justify">“I’m alright.” He lied without looking at him and caught up with Moody and Dumbledore “Let me.” He said, without inflection. They took a step back and Moody said something regarding the fact that he was hacking it, but Sirius wasn’t listening. He could feel Remus’ eyes on the back of his head. He knew he was worried.</p><p align="justify"><em>Prongses and Padfoots make the mess, Wormtails cheer and Moonies worry. </em>This little James Potter in his mind was becoming more and more obnoxious.</p><p align="justify">He looked at the snake-shaped doorknocker and opened his mouth: “I’m Sirius Orion Black. The last living male heir of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black.”</p><p align="justify">He was going to be sick. If Regulus could hear him. If his mother and father could hear him. <em>No bother, </em>he thought bitterly,<em> they are all dead. </em></p><p align="justify">After several long seconds, the snake blinked lazily, as though waking up from a long sleep; it opened his eyes, green emeralds, and, at the same time, widened its jaws. Sirius knew what he had to do: he lifted his hand – and he was glad it wasn’t shaking anymore – and moved it closer to the snake bared fangs.</p><p align="justify">“Wait!”</p><p align="justify">Sirius flinched and turned towards Remus. They were all looking at him: Moody’s magic eye was whizzing crazily in its orbit, Dumbledore had that nerve-wreaking calm expression that could enrage even the least aggressive person in the world and Sirius was perplexed.</p><p align="justify">“You should not… what if it is poisonous?” He said, flustered, trying to collect himself. It wasn’t typical of Remus to lose control like this. <em>Moonies worry.</em> It wasn’t just that though. It was like Remus was irritated by something. “Let Moody do it.” his tone was impatient. He was looking at Sirius as though he was angry at him, like after the kiss. Sirius didn’t know what to make of it; he looked at him, quizzically.</p><p align="justify">“Don’t worry, Remus.” Dumbledore cut the tension with his calm voice “We are ready for every possible outcome.” He patted the pocket of his robe, that was decorated with a very complicated tangle of runes, as if to reassure Remus on the whereabouts of his wand, “And I believe if Sirius intervenes it will be much quicker and less dangerous.” Remus seemed to deflate a bit. Suddenly, Sirius found himself annoyed by the fact that he had become that pliant only when Dumbledore intervened. <em>Albus Dumbledore’s lapdog</em>. That’s what Death Eaters called Remus many years ago. Sirius shrugged, that was cruel to think. And, honestly, they all were.</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore turned to Sirius: “Sirius, if you please.”</p><p align="justify">He nodded without thinking.</p><p align="justify"><em>Precisely</em>.</p><p align="justify">Sirius eyed Remus with a defiant glare, before turning, chin lifted, but Remus just raised his eyebrows in response, frowning, and, all of a sudden, he recognised his expression.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p align="center"><em>sometime</em> 1978 or 1979 or 1980</p><p align="center">“Why do you always have to do things like that?”</p><p align="center">“Just patch me up, Remus.”</p><p align="center">Sirius gnashed. He was breathing with difficulty. His left arm was covered in blood: long, deep cuts were splitting it open from shoulder to wrist.</p><p align="center">“You weren’t supposed to attack, you reckless git.” Remus was pale and his wand hand was shaking “You should do it yourself.” He hissed.</p><p align="center">“Shut up and do it, Moony.” Sirius growled. The pain was unbearable, his flesh was sizzling like meat on a barbecue.</p><p align="center">Remus looked at him in the eye: his irises were almost yellow and burned with rage – and worry. He almost yelled the incantation and Sirius screamed.</p><p align="center">His wounds closed in a matter of seconds – it probably would have hurt a lot less if Remus hadn’t been that blunt in casting the spell. They looked at each other, both panting.</p><p align="center">Sirius leaned on his other elbow and looked tentatively at his blood-stained skin. It was a lot of blood. He felt dizzy and at the same time full of adrenaline. His heart beat furiously in his chest, he could feel his magic tingling at the tip of his fingers.</p><p align="center">“Fucking apologise, Sirius.” Remus spitted out.</p><p align="center">Sirius lifted his gaze: Remus was still tense, his wand squeezed in his fist, his sweaty locks curled slightly at the tips. Too much energy under Sirius’ skin, he was bursting with it. He smirked and grabbed Remus by his hair with his blood-stained hand. Their lips collided against each other and, soon enough, everything else.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p align="justify">Rage and worry. Sirius felt his skin tingling. His favourite version of Remus: furious and beautifully concerned. He tried to ignore the fact that suddenly his chest felt much warmer. There was something seriously wrong with him. Pun intended.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>I’m happy you are here.</em>
</p><p align="justify">“A child’s play, Moony.” He winked and, without any further ado, pushed his fingertip against the snake silvery fangs, without taking his eyes off Remus.</p><p align="justify">It didn’t hurt, it was really just a sting, but the snake draw blood until all the enchantments in the door lifted: it sounded like gears moving and clicking and, at some point, what sounded like the clatter of a chain. When silence was restored, the eyes of the snake had become sapphires. Sirius forced himself not to roll his eyeballs. <em>Sapphires like blue blood</em>. Sickening.</p><p align="justify">When he drew back his hand, he felt quite woozy. He wobbled slightly but pushed the door anyway: “Stay behind me.” He said automatically, but Moody moved him aside with his staff and took the first step in.</p><p align="justify">“I’ve put in Azkaban more members of your family than you can ima–“</p><p align="justify">“Alastor!” Dumbledore warned, but it was too late.</p><p align="justify">Everything happened very quickly. The snake-shaped doorknocker attacked, wrapping its silver coils around Moody’s neck. Sirius’ eyes widened when he saw Remus reacting and grasping the snake with his bare hands.</p><p align="justify">“Remus, no!”</p><p align="justify">Too late. The cursed silver burned Remus’ palms and he recoiled, yelling, and cradling his hands against his chest. Moody was fighting against the snake, his short, scarred fingers trying to slip between the coils and his own neck, so to create some space. Sirius looked at the skin of his palms and fingertips reddening, horrified.</p><p align="justify">“Sirius,” Dumbledore’s voice was dark but steady. He had drawn his wand and looked ready to act, but he was staring at him with his twinkling blue eyes. “It’s your house, you can make it stop.”</p><p align="justify">As if drawn by an invisible force that prompted him to perform the right moves, Sirius lifted his right hand, were the wounds inflicted by the snake were still visible against his fingertip. Once he spotted the head of the snake, he cradled it with his fingers. Immediately, the reptile wrapped itself around Sirius’ hand and then his wrist. The curse did not work on him. He was blood. Once tight around his forearm the snake transformed back in a lifeless object. Sirius looked at it with disdain, then shook his arm until the creepy bracelet clattered on the last marble step, before rattling down all the way to the pavement; there, it became smoke and vanished. When Sirius turned back towards the black door, the doorknocker was back there, as though nothing had happened.</p><p align="justify">Mad-Eye took a long sip from his flask, flashed out of the blue, his breathing laboured. He wiped his mouth with his sleeve, muttering to himself. His hands were still covered in sores, but he didn’t seem to mind. Sirius turned towards Remus: Dumbledore was mumbling some healing spell and the wheals on his palms were already disappearing.</p><p align="justify">“Are you…?”</p><p align="justify">“I’m fine.” Remus smiled weakly, trying to look reassuringly. He opened and closed his fists, then curled his long fingers around his wand.</p><p align="justify">Sirius’ heart was pumping blood at an unsteady rhythm, it kept missing beats.</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore looked at Sirius: “Please, Sirius, get in first, so that we can all get cover.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius felt the anger mounting in his stomach: Dumbledore kept talking to him as though he was a child, it was infuriating. He stepped in anyway, following orders, like the good soldier he had always been.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>A bitter old hag, Padfoot.</em>
</p><p align="justify">He couldn’t wait for them to get it over with the spell, so that he could be left alone.</p><p align="justify">He stopped in the middle of the entrance hall. The room was pitch black and smelled of dampness and neglect which, funnily enough, were the sensations Sirius connected with his childhood. Dumbledore made a swift movement and suddenly several balls of light illuminated the room. Sirius would have preferred it stayed dark. Memories started flooding his head, one worse than the other. He wanted to laugh: of course those were limpid and clear, there wasn’t anything joyful in them, nothing for the Dementors to suck away. He took another step and suddenly a cold, dreadful voice chilled Sirius to the bone.</p><p align="justify">“Look who dared come back.”</p><p align="justify">That wasn’t possible. She was dead. He looked around, frantically.</p><p align="justify">“Calm down, boy.” Moody growled “It’s just a portrait.”</p><p align="justify">Only then, Sirius noticed the life-sized painting of a nasty looking old woman with a black cap: his mother. It was framed by dark moth-eaten curtains. She looked way older than what he remembered, grey hair and yellowish skin. She looked at him with the outmost disgust. At least her expression was familiar. He basked in the idea that he could have been the cause of her premature ageing and smirked.</p><p align="justify">“Hello, mother.”</p><p align="justify">Walburga Black started screeching like a banshee: “Blood traitor! Abomination! You dare befoul the noble house of my fathers!” her face was deformed by anger and her eyes started roaming up and down the room “Scum! Vile filth! Half-breeds!”</p><p align="justify">Suddenly, it didn’t seem funny anymore.</p><p align="justify">“Shut up!” Sirius roared, and grasped one of the curtains, trying to close them on his mother’s mutt.</p><p align="justify">“Creatures of dirt! Mudbloods!”</p><p align="justify">With the corner of his eye, he spotted Remus seizing the other curtain and dragging it from the right side. After some moments of valiant fight, they finally managed to cover the painting. In the end, they were both breathless.</p><p align="justify">“Well,” said Dumbledore cheerfully “I’d say it’s a pleasure being welcomed in your house, Sirius.”</p><p align="justify">Despite his anger at the Headmaster, Sirius lifted a corner of his mouth.</p><p align="justify">“Authentic Black hospitality. This way.” He said, opening a door at his left.</p><p align="justify">The room smelled even more badly than the entrance hall. It was possible that something small and furry had died here. Sirius heard the tapping sound of insects crawling in the corners. Many years before, it had been a spacious sitting room where his father used to greet his guests, before leading them to the dining room to have luncheons or teas. Sirius remembered it being similar to a stuffy over decorated museum and that hadn’t changed much in the last twenty years or so. The walls were adorned with coat of arms and crests; the severe cupboards were full of the most horrendous relics. He moved his wand absent-mindedly and the windows opened wide. When he tried to do the same with the shutters, Dumbledore stopped him: “Better not to attract attention.”</p><p align="justify">Some of the witches and wizards in the paintings mumbled in their sleep. The old Headmaster looked at them with interest, then moved his wrist and shimmering purple blankets covered the portraits: “In this way we will have some privacy.” He explained, softly.</p><p align="justify">Sirius nodded and tapped his wand against the round tea table at the centre of the room: “Scourgify.” Most of the dust that had accumulated since his mother’s death disappeared.</p><p align="justify">“Alright. Let’s do this.” He rolled his sleeves to his elbows and looked at Dumbledore expectantly.</p><p align="justify">He vaguely remembered reading from huge books about the Fidelius Charm when they had decided to perform it to protect Lily, James and Harry. He had grasped the dynamics that time, but in the end, he hadn’t been there when it was performed, when James…</p><p align="justify">
  <em>I casted a damn cool Fidelius Charm, Pads. You should have been there.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Yeah, I should’ve.</em>
</p><p align="justify">This time, he didn’t trust himself in doing it anyway. His magic was still too unstable, and the Charm was too complicated. The best thing would be if Dumbledore performed it for him, on him. The location of the headquarters of the Order was going to be revealed to him anyway. As much as he was angry, he knew that nobody could even remotely reach his level, probably not even Voldemort himself. If there was someone able to cast the best Fidelius possible – <em>Sorry, Prongs</em> – that would be Dumbledore.</p><p align="justify">But Dumbledore looked at him above his half-moon spectacles: “I am afraid I will have to ask all of you to leave the room, Sirius.”</p><p align="justify">He frowned: “What? No, I mean, I have to be in the room, or it won’t…” he stopped, then realised with chilling awareness what was happening “You don’t want me to be Secret Keeper.” He articulated darkly.</p><p align="justify">His hands started to shake. The shutters rattled.</p><p align="justify">Remus looked at him warily. Mad-Eye’s right hand plunged in the pocket of his long cloak – it was thirty degrees, how could he even… –, grasping his wand without any doubt.</p><p align="justify">“I merely think that the Order of the Phoenix is my responsibility and so is its headquarters.” Dumbledore spoke very quietly.</p><p align="justify">“I offered this to you. This is my contribution to the Order.” <em>Since you don’t allow me to do anything else.</em> Sirius closed his fists to prevent his hands from shaking too visibly.</p><p align="justify">“For which I am very grateful.” Dumbledore smiled, as if they were discussing the weather.</p><p align="justify">“Is this punishment?” he spit through gritted teeth.</p><p align="justify">“Why would I punish you, Sirius?”</p><p align="justify">The question was made with mild interest, as though Sirius had clogged all the toilets in the castle and Professor McGonagall had brought him in the Headmaster’s office to be told-off.</p><p align="justify">“Well,” the deadly calm in his own voice surprised Sirius too “last time I was involved in a Fidelius Charm my best friends were murdered, my godson made an orphan and I ended up in Azkaban for twelve years.”</p><p align="justify">The atmosphere got icy even if Sirius could feel the sweat drenching his shirt.</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore didn’t even flinch: “I had offered Lily and James to be their Secret Keeper. They preferred…”</p><p align="justify">“Me.” Sirius spit, as if the mere thought disgusted him “And I proved myself a terrible judge of character. This is why you don’t trust me, do you, Dumbledore?”</p><p align="justify">Remus stepped forward: “Sirius,”</p><p align="justify">“Stay out of it, Remus.” He pronounced coldly, without looking at him.</p><p align="justify">“I do trust you, Sirius.” Dumbledore was still impassive, but he radiated a sense of power that Sirius had seen around him only rarely “I simply believe it is best that the Order of the Phoenix remains entirely my responsibility.”</p><p align="justify">“Because you did such a great job last time.” Sirius hissed, cruelly.</p><p align="justify">Mad-Eye had drawn his wand: “Watch it, Black.”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore raised a hand and shook his head: Moody lowered is arm.</p><p align="justify">“Look at you,” Sirius felt decades of pain and anger rumbling in his blood, “even the great Mad-Eye Moody eats from your outstretched hand.”</p><p align="justify">“Sirius,” Remus’ voice was drier.</p><p align="justify">Moody snarled.</p><p align="justify">He ignored them: “How many more, Dumbledore? The Order is your responsibility. Well you didn’t do much for the Order, did you? Do I have to remind you their names? I remember all of them, <em>all</em> of them, I counted them like sheep to fall asleep, while I was in Azkaban, paying my price. Because I did pay it. And I would go back there right now to atone even more because nothing, nothing, not even an eternity in Azkaban could ever take away my guilt. But you,” he put all his loathing in that single pronoun “when did you ever pay? For Dorcas Meadowes,” he started counting them on his fingers “Caradoc Dearborn, Edgar Bones with his wife and children, Benjy Fenwick, Gideon Prewett, Fabian Prewett, Marlene McKinnon and her entire family,” he paused, before pronouncing the most painful names of his death list “James and Lily Potter. These are only the members of the Order that were killed in the last four months of war. You moved us like pawns on your personal chessboard. Let’s ship Remus to consort with werewolves.” He pointed in the general direction of north “Let’s push Sirius in the arms of his fucked up family.” He opened his arms, “Let’s have Hagrid talking with the giants!” He paused, then lifted a finger, like he was suddenly remembering something “Oh no, this last one is the new one! Doesn’t seem the style changed much.”</p><p align="justify">Moody had tried interrupting him a couple of times, Remus was holding his elbow so tight it hurt, struggling to drag him out of the room. Dumbledore didn’t even blink: “I remember all their names, Sirius.” He said, gravely “I make mistakes. In contrast to what most people believe, I am afraid, I am not infallible. But all your resentment won’t make me step back from this decision. I am grateful to you for offering this solution, but I will be Secret Keeper of the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do to change my mind.” He looked at Moody. “Alastor, if you please.”</p><p align="justify">Moody limped where Sirius was still putting up a fight against Remus’ grasp and pushed him out of the room unceremoniously. Sirius stumbled in the hall and the door closed behind them. Moody was roaring at him and Remus was trying desperately to tame him, his mother’s portrait started screeching again (“Half-breed! Filth! Traitors of your blood!”).</p><p align="justify">James’ voice was sad when he repeated for the thousand time the same phrase that kept journeying around his head since he had left Harry in the Hospital Wing at the end of June: <em>You cannot let things go, can you, Sirius?</em></p><p align="justify">Sirius laughed in his head – a manic, joyless laugh: stepping again in Grimmauld Place was exactly as he expected it to be. Memories and present time mixed up together. <em>Home sweet home</em>.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p align="right">July 4<sup>th</sup> 1995</p><p align="justify">One of the things Sirius liked most about Remus was that he didn’t push. He had never been someone who asked lots of questions and who forced him to talk. That was James. James with his perfect family and perfect relationship with his parents and communication skills and <em>love</em>. Sirius had hated him for that. Envied him. <em>But that lasted such a short amount of time</em>. He forced himself to remember.</p><p align="justify">In his head, after Azkaban, even after almost two years, his memories were stretched or shrunk depending on their level of positivity. If they were really good memories – the first time Fleamont Potter called him son, Euphemia Potter fussing over him when he had sprained his ankle playing Quidditch in the summer holidays, James asking him to be his best man, running in the Forbidden Forest with the wolf, the stag and the rat, Remus’ face when he had seen Padfoot for the first time, holding baby Harry in his arms – they had shrunk like wool jumpers washed in the wrong way; to access them, Sirius had to really focus and often it resulted in frustration and headache. He wondered if he would recollect them clearly ever again. The bad memories – hating James for his perfect family, his life at Grimmauld Place, Regulus suddenly forgetting they were brothers, a long talk in Dumbledore’s office sitting beside Remus who refused to look him in the eye, the feeling of abandonment when finally James and Lily started dating, the acid suspicion of Remus’ betrayal, understanding what Peter really was, finding James and Lily’s bodies – oh that was all painfully clear. He could relieve any second just closing his eyes. That was why nights were better as Padfoot.</p><p align="justify">The door of the room creaked, and Sirius turned towards it.</p><p align="justify">“They are gone.” Remus said quietly.</p><p align="justify">It was almost midnight and it had been a frantic day.</p><p align="justify">The previous night, they had gone back to Remus’ cottage in Wales. They had barely slept, Sirius had stayed outside, leaning against Buckbeak, salty air in his lungs and stars above his head; Remus inside, in his room. At the break of the dawn, Remus hadn’t said a word as Sirius prepared Buckbeak for the journey to London. He had just performed a disillusionment charm on both of them and finally opened his mouth to tell him they would meet at the house.</p><p align="justify">After completing the Fidelius Charm, Dumbledore had been pristine: someone ought to constantly live in Grimmauld Place and since Sirius was still wanted, he was the one who was going to be its watchdog. Yes, he really used that word. His eyes had also twinkled. Sirius had felt the pressuring desire to rip his throat out with his canines. Remus had looked at him like he was expecting him to do it, but Sirius had just nodded.</p><p align="justify"><em>You wanted to go back to prison</em>. Dumbledore’s eyes were saying. <em>Be careful what you wish for</em>.</p><p align="justify">Getting inside Grimmauld Place had been easier the second time, the house recognised him, and a tap of his wand sufficed. Members of the Order Sirius hadn’t seen for years – well, obviously – came and went all day. New ones introduced themselves with a shred of suspicion looming in their tight expressions. That tended to happen when people thought you betrayed the heroes of the Magical World for fourteen years. When looking for something to do in the kitchen – at least make some tea, for Merlin’s sake, anything to keep his hands from shaking – Sirius had found out with the outmost disgust that Kreacher, his family house elf, still lived there, and he didn’t harbour any more affection for him than he did when he was a child.</p><p align="justify">“Are you sleeping here?”</p><p align="justify">Remus looked around and didn’t seem particularly upset by the ugly room. Everything there reeked of Pureblood nonsense and dark magic.</p><p align="justify">Sirius scoffed: “No. This is Buckbeak’s room. In honour of my mother and her love for half-breeds.” Then he realised what he had said and hurried to add, “Fuck, sorry, I didn’t mean…”</p><p align="justify">Remus shook his head with a light smile. He didn’t seem bothered. Sirius wondered how many times he had heard the word in the last decade. A stiff silence fell on them; Sirius knew that they had to talk about so many things he had lost count. But Remus didn’t pressure. He never did.</p><p align="justify">“So, where shall I sleep?” Remus asked light-heartedly, burying his hands in the pockets of his woollen waistcoat. Sirius couldn’t help but smile: that was such teacher-y outfit. They used to mock him so much in school about the fact that he would become a Professor. Once, third year, they had spent a week announcing him in hallways as heralds because Flitwick had told him he would make a great teacher one day. He thought about Harry calling him Professor Lupin and he had to force himself not to laugh. A strangled sound came out instead and Remus’ expression changed.</p><p align="justify">“I mean, if you… want me here.”</p><p align="justify">“What? Of course I want… <em>what</em>?” he seemed to register only in that moment that Remus wanted to stay in Grimmauld Place.</p><p align="justify">“I thought,” Remus resumed his composure “you would fancy some company.”</p><p align="justify">He looked at him meaningfully and Sirius found himself astonished by the fact that he could understand the subtext. He and Remus… they had never been great at communication. <em>I am not James, but I am here. </em>He was saying. James had been the one involved in the drama with his family, Remus and Peter had just endured his mood swings and reckless initiatives. One more than the other.</p><p align="justify">For the first time, Sirius noticed the worn leather suitcase near the bedroom’s door. It had label: <em>Professor R. J. Lupin.</em></p><p align="justify">He smirked and nudged Remus as he crossed the threshold: “Let’s find an accommodation that befits your status, Professor.”</p><p align="justify">Remus made a sound but didn’t protest.</p><p align="justify">They climbed the stairs and Sirius feigned indifference, but his heart was pounding in his chest more strongly than ever. He longed for James and he felt guilty for it. Remus was there and he was alive, and he knew him. But James knew exactly what had happened. He was present when he had knocked at the Potters’ door and Fleamont Potter had opened it with a napkin tucked inside the collar of his shirt and found a drenched sixteen-year-old with a half-shattered trunk on his porch. James knew things that nobody else knew. Not even Remus. <em>But James is dead</em>. <em>He has been dead for more time than we have spent together</em>. He thought he had come to terms with that. Twelve years in prison and two years on the run are a lot of time. And it actually was easier, when he wasn’t so near people who reminded him of his murdered best friend. Being in the same room with Remus was painful enough – for more than one reason –, but when Harry was around… the first time he had seen him, Sirius had been extremely grateful it had been in his Animagus form, because even like that, the agony and the joy had been so excruciating he thought his heart would explode.</p><p align="justify">“It’s been a while.” Sirius said, facing the door to his bedroom. His name was still there, in silver letters. He pointed his wand to the doorknob: “Alohomora.” He said, clearly. The door opened with a creaking sound. It was dark and dusty but looked mostly the same. He walked to the window and opened it. A warm breeze whizzed inside, and Sirius felt his fingers itching to open the shutters too. He took a step back. Remus was still at the door.</p><p align="justify">“Get in,” said Sirius cheerfully “this is probably the only room that won’t try to kill you.”</p><p align="justify">Remus lifted a corner of his mouth and moved his wrist lazily. The candle scrubs in the sockets of the old chandelier lit up immediately and their trembling light suddenly reflected on the left wall: faded red and gold came back to life in all their glory: Griffyndor banners, cockades and even a couple of little flags, old photographs of motorbike models of the early seventies and a couple of posters of Muggle girls in bikinis. Sirius couldn’t help but smile broadly: his Permanent Sticking Charm had resisted.</p><p align="justify">Remus was smiling too, shaking his head helplessly: “You were a git.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius wiggled his eyebrows: “Gryffindor’s pride.”</p><p align="justify">Right beside a menacing roaring lion there was a photograph. Sirius’ smile dimmed slightly looking at it. He couldn’t remember who had taken it. He couldn’t remember exactly where they were, all four of them; there was snow and a tree in the background. It must have been a completely good memory, because the Dementors had taken it all. He swallowed as his eyes lingered on the two boys at the centre, realising that it was the first time in fourteen years that he looked at the smiling face of James Potter. He raised a hand towards the picture but let it fall by his side without touching the small figurines. In his head, James’ cocky grin overlapped with a terrified expression, crooked glasses and unfocused hazel eyes.</p><p align="justify">“It was the first Hogsmeade week-end after the Christmas holidays. Fifth year.” Remus said, a fondness in his voice that Sirius didn’t recognise. He looked at him, but Remus was still staring at the photograph.</p><p align="justify">“Mary took the picture. Mary McDonald. She was a year younger than us, she had a crush on you.” He scoffed, smiling “Well, every girl in Hogwarts had a crush on you.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius leaned against the wall with a half-smile: “Even some boys.” He said, knowingly.</p><p align="justify">Remus rolled his eyes and – thought Sirius – if he had been twenty years younger, he would have blushed, but he didn’t.</p><p align="justify">“Shut up.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius chuckled and made himself look at the photo again: “Seems like yesterday.” He said.</p><p align="justify">Remus’ expression tightened; he sighed and shook his head: “Seems like another lifetime.”</p><p align="justify">They looked at each other and Sirius motioned towards the bed, without averting his eyes: “We better get some sleep.” He said slowly, deliberately.</p><p align="justify">Remus glanced at the bed, then at Sirius. He seemed to consider the implications. Of course he did. <em>Moonies worry</em>. Finally, he placed his tattered suitcase near the old-fashioned wardrobe, and, without another word, he started unbuttoning his waistcoat.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="right">July 6<sup>th</sup> 1995</p><p align="justify">“Molly and the children will be here tomorrow.”</p><p align="justify">Remus entered the kitchen with his hands full of old linens, half-eaten by moths. Sirius raised his eyes from a copy of the Prophet that Kinglsey Shacklebolt had left the night before. Harry was crazy, Dumbledore was senile, and the most pressing matter was to standardise the number of jellies inside every package of Bertie Botts’ All Flavoured Beans.</p><p align="justify">“I thought we could sort these out, see if they are salvageable.”</p><p align="justify">It was early morning and they were alone and there weren’t plans for anyone else to visit all day.</p><p align="justify">“Exciting.” Sirius commented, poking at the black and silver linens with the tip of his wand, a revolted expression on his face.</p><p align="justify">“I know, I always drag you in incredible adventures.” Remus muttered, throwing a book on housekeeping charms on the wooden table. “You could ask that house elf of yours to help out.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius buried himself behind the paper: “Still not on speaking terms with Kreacher.”</p><p align="justify">“Padfoot.”</p><p align="justify">“Moony.”</p><p align="justify">The paper rolled up by itself and levitated straight in Remus’ extended hand.</p><p align="justify">“Come on!” Sirius pouted shamelessly.</p><p align="justify">Remus pushed the tower of linens towards him: “Start sorting the linens out and maybe you’ll have back your paper for lunchtime.”</p><p align="justify">“You are a tyrant.” Sirius whined before lifting a hem with a disgusted expression “Cannot they do this by themselves when they arrive tomorrow?”</p><p align="justify">“Very welcoming, Sirius.” Remus commented, and started going through the book.</p><p align="justify">The sheets were almost all good to go, even if most of them had several series of little holes all over the fabric. They did their best to mend them with housekeeping charms, but once Sirius set a pillowcase on fire, Remus decided that it was better to have pierced linens than no linens at all. Then, they proceeded towards inspecting the rooms in which the kids would end up sleeping.</p><p align="justify">“How many children the Weasleys have?” asked Sirius “I remember Harry’s friend, Ron, and a tall one with a ponytail.”</p><p align="justify">Remus smiled: “That would be Bill, the oldest. He has finished Hogwarts, like Charlie and Percy. Percy has been my student, two years ago. A real swot. You would probably hate him. But we just get the younger ones,” he added cheerfully, as if they were organising a summer camp “the twins, Fred and George, big fans of the Marauders: they are the ones who had inherited the Map before Harry and cracked it; then Ron, Harry’s best friend, and Ginny, the only Weasley girl.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius smiled of Remus’ enthusiasm, he was starting to feel the excitement too: a full house would prevent him from brooding too much: “I like these Fred and George chaps. Did you teach to them all?”</p><p align="justify">Remus nodded: “To the last five, yes.” He smiled back, a bit sheepishly “They are all good kids.”</p><p align="justify">They stopped on the first landing and Sirius licked his lips, clapping his hands: “So, sleeping arrangements: Molly and Arthur, I guess, the troublemaker twins and Ron and Ginny? That would be three rooms, right? Should be enough.”</p><p align="justify">Remus patted the palm of his hand against his forehead: “Oh, no, I was almost forgetting: Hermione is coming too. I reckon she’ll share with Ginny.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius nodded, then realised the problem: “Two of them can take Regulus’ room.” He conceded, speaking carefully, waiting for Remus to panic. He had thought that Remus would try and move his things in Regulus’ room, if other people ended up staying in the house. He personally wasn’t bothered, he had never really cared about what people thought of him, of what he did, with whom he slept. Remus, on the other side, had always been extremely private and self-conscious. That <em>thing</em> between them… it had always been harder on Remus than on him. He thought about Remus’ words: <em>I don’t really know where we stand</em>. Yeah, where?</p><p align="justify">But Remus just nodded thoughtfully, clearly thinking about it but not addressing the matter directly, and opened the door at their left with a flick of his wand: the room was dark and depressing like the rest of the house. The wallpaper was coming off the walls and a huge spider crawled under the wardrobe as they went in. Sirius made a face.</p><p align="justify">Remus didn’t seem concerned. He rolled his sleeves to his elbows: “Let’s separate the beds. Should be a simple Splitting enchantment and a bit of Transfiguration. I’ll do the charm, you do the transfiguring part.”</p><p align="justify">“You really believe in me, Remus. I want to remind you I just set fire to a pillowcase.”</p><p align="justify">Remus smirked and moved his wand in a sharp X. The bed split in half and Sirius, taken by surprise, shouted the first transfiguration spell that came to his mind and with a loud bang two identical beds appeared in front of them. Sirius stood surprised, the wand still clutched in his hand.</p><p align="justify">Remus had an obnoxiously knowing smile on his face.</p><p align="justify">“What was that?” Sirius was almost panting.</p><p align="justify">“You work better under pressure.” Remus wasn’t even trying to hide his satisfaction: “Come on,” he threw a couple of sheets on the nearer bed “You make the beds.”</p><p align="justify">“You are a cruel and despicable person, Professor Lupin.”</p><p align="justify">Remus’ rough laugh sounded like magic.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Sirius finally stepped foot on the last landing, he found Remus moving his things in Regulus’ room. He had felt it coming since he had entered the drawing room downstairs – the door was half open – and a comfortable looking bed had met his gaze, towering at the centre of the room in place of two old and tattered armchairs.</p><p align="justify">They stalled for a few seconds and Sirius thought <em>Here it is. The chips are down</em>. Remus moved awkwardly at is left and at the same time Sirius shifted his weight on his right leg. They both let out a nervous laugh.</p><p align="justify">Remus lifted his suitcase in the general direction of Regulus’ half-closed door: “I’ll just…”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t want you to.” The words slipped from his lips before he could stop them. He flinched when he realised he sounded petulant and childish.</p><p align="justify">Remus blinked, mouth ajar, then licked his lips: “Sirius,”</p><p align="justify">“Why do we have to be a dirty little secret?”</p><p align="justify">Sirius vaguely remembered asking Remus the same thing, forehead pressed against his shoulder as he drunkenly jacked him off in a dark alley in Muggle London after a Siouxsie and the Banshees concert in 1978. Remus hadn’t answered that time.</p><p align="justify">“It is easier this way.” Present Remus said, his posture more rigid and the hold on his suitcase firmer. Sirius wondered if he was remembering too. “The situation is complicated enough.”</p><p align="justify">“It wasn’t last night. Or the night before.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius knew Remus was thinking quickly, he could see it from the slight twitch in his jawline, the way in which he licked his lips.</p><p align="justify">“Sirius, please, don’t make it difficult.”</p><p align="justify">“Make what difficult? I don’t…” he could feel the blood rushing in his veins, and he didn’t want anything more than change into Padfoot and just pounce on the wolf, tumbling him, solving this quarrel like animals because it was so much simpler. They had done it before, in the long year he which they almost didn’t talk, just meeting during full moons, running in remote settings, losing themselves in their animal forms, without borders, without restraints. But the full moon was still weeks away. “Why are you still so ashamed of this?” he opened his arms.</p><p align="justify">Remus seemed on the verge of losing his temper. Nobody else would have noticed, his shoulders were stiff and his expression unreadable and, apparently, he looked calm and collected. But Sirius knew him, he thought with manic satisfaction, after all these years he still knew him. He knew that when Remus shifted his weight from one leg to the other and set his jaw and wiggled his little finger like that… He was the only one who could notice it. Well, James would have noticed and probably Peter too, but Sirius didn’t want to think about them, not now. This was just between him and Remus. As it had always been. <em>Yes</em>. Thought Sirius. <em>A reaction, anything</em>.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t want to have to explain why I sleep in your bed to Molly Weasley and her children.” Remus said through narrowed teeth.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t give a damn what Molly Weasley thinks!” Sirius laughed without joy.</p><p align="justify">“Then maybe you will care about what Harry thinks.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius tensed up: “Harry is not here. Dumbledore explained why he can’t come.” He repeated the words he had been saying in his head since he’d asked Dumbledore about it. He felt a bitter taste on his tongue.</p><p align="justify">Remus’ shoulders slumped a bit and all of a sudden Sirius literally <em>saw</em> on him all the years they had lost: “Sirius, listen to me. I do not want to fight. I am not ashamed. I have never…” he didn’t finish the sentence. He lowered his gaze and ran a hand through his thin hair, they fell on his forehead in silvery locks. <em>All the years they lost.</em></p><p align="justify">“Yes, you are.” The awareness hit Sirius as if someone slapped him in the face. “This is it, isn’t it? You are ashamed because for twelve years you…” he closed his mouth, uncapable of finishing the sentence.</p><p align="justify">Remus leaned against the wall with his left shoulder and his suitcase slipped from his fingers, falling on the old moquette with a soft sound: “Say it, please don’t spare my feelings.” He challenged him, defiant.</p><p align="justify">“Because you kept wanting this.”</p><p align="justify">
  <em>You kept wanting me.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Remus had that look in his eyes he bore when the moon was looming over him, a ghostly pale almost perfect disk over his head, the last days before she reached her full: “You have no idea.” He said, sounded defeated “You have no idea how that is, Sirius. I believed it. I believed you had betrayed James and murdered Peter and all those people. You liked that hex, do you remember? The one Peter used to blow up the whole street. You used it once to make all the toilets in the castle explode.” Neither of them was smiling at the memory “I found out from the paper.” His voice broke, “And then Dumbledore called me in his office, and he confirmed everything, and I believed him.”</p><p align="justify">“Remus,” Sirius tried to stop him, to tell him he understood, to tell him he didn’t have to feel guilty, to tell him he had been sincerely persuaded of the fact that he was the spy. He wanted to tell him they were even.</p><p align="justify">“I never doubted for a moment, Sirius, because you know what was the first thought I had? It was: he betrayed me once, I should have known he was going to betray James too.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius physically took a step back and leaned on the extremity of the banister: it was shaped like the head of a snake. If Remus had hit him with a curse it would have hurt less. He was struggling to breathe. His grasp on the bannister tightened and felt the fangs of the snake puncturing his palm.</p><p align="justify">But Remus went on, unleashing twelve years of silence on him. From the outside he looked unperturbed.</p><p align="justify">“He was willing to make a murderer out of me at sixteen. I should have known what he was capable of.” He paused again, his voice strangled “That’s what I told Dumbledore. And then I went back to London and Aurors were raiding our apartment.” His tone changed, as if he was recounting someone else’s story “They brought me in for questioning. Moody wasn’t there, or I believe he would have stopped them, since he knew everything about my job with the Order. And while they peeled me of everything we had ever shared, I kept asking myself: is he in this building? Are they doing this to him too? Then Dumbledore came and vouched for me. I was sent back in Camden and it was a battlefield. They had taken away almost everything, and the rest was shattered or torn or scattered around. A good metaphor.” Remus wasn’t looking at him anymore “I stayed there for days, unable to do anything, until the next moon. And still I wanted you.” He raised his eyes again “You had taken everything from me, and I still wanted you, Sirius, as badly as ever.”</p><p align="justify">For thirteen years Sirius had thought that he had had the worst of it, not for the Azkaban part, he knew he deserved that, but because he couldn’t be out there tracking down Peter and make him pay, because he was the only one knowing the truth. He had also blamed Remus for a while, for blindly believing him guilty. But this… Sirius wanted to be angry with him, wanted to tell him that he had sworn he had forgiven him for Snape, that it wasn’t fair he was using it against him again.</p><p align="justify">“I hated you and myself and I was glad you were rotting in Azkaban and that I couldn’t avenge James and Lily because I knew that if I had ever met you again, Sirius… I would not have been able to do to you what we were ready to do to Peter.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius covered his face with a hand, massaging his eyes with his fingertips. He couldn’t hear this. He couldn’t… Avenging James and Lily was what he had lived for for twelve years. He couldn’t believe Remus…</p><p align="justify">
  <em>What about you? What if it was really Remus as you suspected?</em>
</p><p align="justify">He felt a lump in his throat.</p><p align="justify"><em>You did tell me your suspicions after ten months you had started thinking he was the spy.</em> continued James’ voice in his head.</p><p align="justify">Sirius wanted to protest, but it was the truth. He had waited and waited and waited all through Lily’s pregnancy, for long months in which he and Remus had been together-but-not-really. Remus had been almost exclusively with the wolves and Peter… Peter had kept feeding him information regarding Remus, telling him things Remus didn’t reveal about his missions. And Sirius had believed him and had started noticing things about Remus, things he had never noticed before: his disappearances were longer than needed; on his clothes Sirius could smell scents that shouldn’t have been there – men, women, freedom, desire; he wrote letters late at night, when he thought Sirius was sleeping. He had procrastinated and procrastinated and when the time for the Fidelius Charm had come he had made his choice and he hadn’t told Remus, nor Dumbledore and James had trusted him.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>What if he were the spy? Would you have killed him to avenge me?</em>
</p><p align="justify">Sirius covered his face with both hands, he pressed his fingers against his eyelids until white lights started popping in front of him and Peter’s face in the Shack appeared before him, pleading and begging. Remus wouldn’t have begged, he wouldn’t have been on his knees. He imagined pointing his wand at his heart. He imagined asking him why.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Would you have murdered Moony for me, Padfoot?</em>
</p><p align="justify">Sirius lowered his arms and made himself look at Remus. He was looking back with the corner of his lip slightly upturned in a tight, sad smile: “This is why I am ashamed.” He said slowly “Not because of us or the fact that we are both men or whatever idiotic crisis I was going through when we were eighteen.” He paused “Now you know. I will move my things in Regulus’ room. Give you some space.”</p><p align="justify">The door closed soundlessly behind his shoulders and Sirius laughed, a joyless, strangled, pained sound. Only ten minutes before he believed he knew Remus like the back of his hand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sirius didn’t go down for lunch. He closed himself in his mother’s room. Buckbeak could feel something was wrong and they spent most of the time looking at each other from two different sides of the room, suspiciously. A big part of him wanted to change into Padfoot and just forget for some time about the conversation. The question was burning in his brain: James’ voice had repeated it so many times it didn’t make any sense anymore.</p><p align="justify">He felt nauseous.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Merlin, this is nonsense.</em>
</p><p align="justify">He didn’t want to think about the things Remus said, he didn’t want to… he wanted to <em>do</em> something. Keep himself occupied. He got up from the dusty corner and walked to the door. When he opened it his stomach sank. All wrapped up in defensive charms – probably to keep away spiders and mice and Kreacher – was a butter and jam sandwich. Sirius felt his eyes stinging. He picked it up and took a bite. It wasn’t bad. Sirius took a deep breath.</p><p align="justify">“Moony?” he called, looking up and down the stairs.</p><p align="justify">“Bit busy!” came a snappish voice from downstairs.</p><p align="justify">Sirius walked down the stairs slowly, savouring his sandwich; when he got to the first floor, he rubbed his fingers, getting rid of the crumbs. Remus was inside the second room they had cleared that morning, a concerned expression on his face, while he examined something on the ceiling.</p><p align="justify">“What?” asked Sirius, getting in the room and looking up. His newly full stomach churned.</p><p align="justify">What looked like a mass of green slime covered completely the blackened plaster. It didn’t make any noise, except for the occasional squelching sound, when part of it kind of… moved?</p><p align="justify">“I’ve seen my fair share of revolting things in my life, but this will now keep a special place in my heart. Thank you, Moony.”</p><p align="justify">Remus’ lips twitched: “Don’t mention it.”</p><p align="justify">A drop of green slimy thing splattered on the left nightstand, near enough to the abat-jour to stain the suffering looking house elf engraved in its body, and Sirius leaned in to examine it: “What the hell is this?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s a colony of Bundimun.” Remus said plainly and Sirius noticed that an old edition of <em>Fantastic Beasts and where to find them</em> lied on the bedsheets, opened at the correct page. Sirius smiled recognising Remus’ neat notes on little scraps of parchment tucked between the pages. It was his Hogwarts’ textbook.</p><p align="justify">“Fascinating.”</p><p align="justify">Remus shrugged: “It explains the stench.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius looked up again, hands on his hips: “How didn’t we notice it this morning?”</p><p align="justify">A noise like the suction of a drain answered Sirius’ question: one of the lovely creatures suddenly disappeared through the ceiling.</p><p align="justify">“I think they were upstairs.” Remus’ answer was calibrated, “and here when we were up. They feed on dirt and enjoy destroying decaying houses.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius lifted his eyebrows: “Their infinite qualities don’t cease to surprise me.”</p><p align="justify">This time, Sirius definitely recognised a smile.</p><p align="justify">“I really hope a simple Scouring Charm will suffice, or I will have to ask Arthur to do some research with his colleagues of the Pest Sub-division at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.” Remus grumbled.</p><p align="justify">Sirius shrugged, reading the paragraph on the Bundinum on Remus’ book: “It says their secretions rotten structures. I don’t really mind if the whole place collapses, honestly.” He turned the page “Did you know that they are only two Xs less dangerous than you?”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t make me hex you, Sirius.” Remus sing-songed, without looking at him, his wand pointed towards a pretty large fungus in one of the angles. He tried the movement a couple of times and Sirius noticed that he was putting a lot more effort in the precision of the S shape.</p><p align="justify">“Alright.” Remus cleared his throat and pronounced clearly “Scourgify!”</p><p align="justify">A voluminous cloud of bubbles enveloped the Bundinum, consuming it quickly like acid. In the end, only the eyes remained and fell on the ground, rolling around like marbles.</p><p align="justify">“Very well.” Remus turned towards him, a little greenish on the cheeks “You take that corner.” He pointed towards the left end and Sirius nodded. He knew the burning desire to focus on something in order to forget <em>something else</em> for as long as possible.</p><p align="justify">They worked in silence for a while, only muttering incantations and jumping on the sides to avoid jets of acid secretions and wandering eyes. Sirius had no idea why someone could ever desire to work at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creature, Pest Sub-division. He would have bargained that ghastly occupation with fighting deadly Manticores any day of the week.</p><p align="justify">When only a revolting, dark green layer of slime remained on the ceiling, Sirius sighed: “I really hate housekeeping.” He declared “Scourgify.” He pronounced for the umpteenth time, but the slime didn’t seem to falter.</p><p align="justify">Remus licked his lips: “Let me try something out.” He said, frowning in concentration. He lifted both his hands and pointed his wand at the corner the biggest Bundimun had previously colonised: “Surgito.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius looked at him, impressed. It was usually a counterspell, but Remus was using it to gather all the remains of the filthy creatures. The slime lifted from the ceiling, as if attracted to Remus’ wand. He moved his arm in a straight line, and the slime followed it, until it concentrated in a sort of awful blob that vanished into thin air with a loud pop.</p><p align="justify">“That was really remarkable, Moony.” Sirius couldn’t hide the admiration in his tone and neither wanted to.</p><p align="justify">He smiled, lowering his eyes: “Only ordinary wizards use the spells as the book tells them to.” He said, a tone louder than a whisper.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>I’m moved, Moony quotes me like he quotes Merlin or that Muggle he likes. Shocked-pear.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Shakespeare.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Whatever. Next step: Chocolate Frogs.</em>
</p><p align="justify">A stiff silence fell over them. Sirius didn’t know what to say: he wasn’t sure he could address the conversation they had had earlier – or better, Remus’ monologue. He wasn’t even sure how he himself felt. The desire of killing Peter had always been pristine in his head – the only thing that had kept him sane in twelve years. It probably wasn’t healthy, and it probably said a lot about him, but he couldn’t rely on good memories: they were taken from him, one after the other, leaving behind only shadows, like the green slime on the ceiling. Vengeance, though. The Dementors didn’t feast on that. Vengeance had allowed him to keep it together. Remus admission… <em>I would not have been able to do to you what we were ready to do to Peter</em>. James’ words in his head… <em>Would you have murdered Moony for me, Padfoot?</em></p><p align="justify">He was winding up again. He forced a tight smile: “Let’s go disinfest some more, shall we?” he asked, in a too cheerful voice.</p><p align="justify">Remus looked surprised that he was doing his best to avoid an argument. Sirius very rarely avoided confrontation. This time, though, he didn’t know how to play his part.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p align="center"><em>sometime</em> 1981 or 1982 or 1983 or 1984 or 1985 or 1986 or 1987 or 1988 or 1989 or 1990 or 1991 or 1992 or 1993</p><p align="center">Wormtail. Traitor. Rat. Kill.</p><p align="center">A Killing Curse. Like Lily and James.</p><p align="center">Or not? Something worse. He could take limb from limb from him, like they had done to… to… he didn’t remember his name anymore.</p><p align="center">He didn’t want to hear explanations. He already knew <em>why</em>. He had always been weak, always been too fond of his own skin.</p><p align="center">He was going to kill Wormtail and then he would go straight back to Azkaban, he didn’t care. There wasn’t anything else for him anyway. Just that burning desire to take his revenge. He owed it to… he owed it to… Lily and James. Lily and James. Lily and James. James. James.</p><p align="center">
  <em>All my fault, all my fault, all my fault.</em>
</p><p align="center">No, no, revenge must be his focus. Revenge was his lifeline.</p><p align="center">Kill Peter.</p><p align="center">That was his only goal.</p><p align="center">Go back in Azkaban after. Whatever. There wasn’t anything else, anyone else.</p><p align="center">A distant part of his mind objected to that: it sounded like echo, it felt like someone else’s memory. Woods, springtime, howling to the full moon. The corner of lips twitching. The fussing of a baby. Little hands.</p><p align="center">The Dementors closed in and Sirius Black lifted his eyes, defiant: “Came in for a snack?”</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p align="justify">Sirius couldn’t sleep.</p><p align="justify">Maybe he had become accustomed to Remus’ presence by his side, maybe it was the fight they had, maybe it was the pressing question in his head. He lied in the bed, chest lifting and lowering regularly. The faint light of a lamppost vaguely illuminated the red and gold shapes on the wall. He couldn’t distinguish the little figures on the photograph, but he knew they were there.</p><p align="justify">That picture, what it represented, had been his lifeline, back then, when he had been stuck in this house, this room, for weeks long as ages.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Still could be.</em>

  <em>You are soppy, Potter.</em>
</p><p align="justify">He got up and opened the door to his left. The loo he once shared with Regulus was dark and grim. <em>What a surprise</em>. A vile layer of dust and filth covered everything. The nights before, he and Remus had used the downstairs bathroom. It was bigger and they had thought it was better to have a functioning bathroom that also had a tub. He opened the tap – it was shaped like a snake, like everything else in that house. The pipes made a pained sound, like a poltergeist screeching, and the water poured out black and full of slime.</p><p align="justify">“Sirius?”</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p align="justify">“Sorry, Moony, the tap. Go back to sleep, it’s fine.”</p><p align="justify">The door creaked and Remus peaked inside: “You okay?” he asked.</p><p align="justify">He had deep circles under his eyes, and it didn’t look like he was sleeping. When he pulled the door more, Sirius spotted a lit candle and an open book on his pillow.</p><p align="justify">“I’m fine. I have trouble sleeping. It’s… suffocating. This house.”</p><p align="justify">Remus nodded, understanding, then summoned a blanket with his wand: Sirius didn’t even notice he had it. It would be probably better if he kept it with him all the time too. James didn’t have his wand on him when he had found his body. No, he wouldn’t go there.</p><p align="justify">“Let’s go out.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius blinked: “What?”</p><p align="justify">“The rooftop.” Remus walked past him, crossing Sirius’ room and reaching the landing.</p><p align="justify">Sirius followed him and retrieved his wand from the nightstand. He hesitated, then grabbed the pack of fags too.</p><p align="justify">“But how we…?”</p><p align="justify">Remus grasped his elbow. *CRACK* They apparated on a fairly straight surface. It was accessible only through the attic, and Sirius had never been there much – it was full of mementos and creepy dark objects. Kreacher’s favourite place.</p><p align="justify">Sirius inhaled profoundly: London was mostly quiet, he could hear the faint noise of the cars, a couple of streets from there, the coarse laugh of someone being thrown out of a pub. He looked up: the sky was dark, only a couple starts visible, because of the lights of the city. The moon was at her first quarter.</p><p align="justify">Remus was leaning against the wall, one leg propped up. He was looking at the sky. Sirius wondered if he’d ever looked at it and not hated it. He wondered how he spent all the full moons in which the dog, the stag and the rat weren’t there. <em>All the years they lost</em>.</p><p align="justify">He sat on the dirty concrete, circling his knees with one arm.</p><p align="justify">“Tell me how it was.”</p><p align="justify">Remus looked down at him with a questioning look.</p><p align="justify">“Teaching Harry.” He specified.</p><p align="justify">Remus visibly relaxed. He had already told him bits and pieces, the first days he had stayed at his cottage in Wales. It was a safe subject. He conjured the blanket he had brought with him and folded it in half and then again in half. He sat at one extremity and didn’t say anything when Sirius shifted to settle closer to him, on the soft fabric. Sirius lit a fag with the tip of his wand and passed it to Remus. He breathed in a puff of smoke and give it back to Sirius. They didn’t touch, nor they looked at each other. They kept their eyes on the summer sky, the cigarette passing between their fingers, and Remus recounting with fondness in his voice.</p><p align="justify">The Moon and Canis Maior were oddly close that night.</p>
