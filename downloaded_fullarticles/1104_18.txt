    <p>“Harry, do you really dislike me ? Is staying by my side really that hard for you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry, who was about to put the tray of cookies in the oven stilled as he heard the incriminating words from the mouth of his boyfriend. His heart started beating at double the speed and his hands suddenly felt cold and clammy. He carefully put the tray down and switched off the microwave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry turned to look at his boyfriend and his heart clenched in pain as he saw the misery etched on Tom’s face. He had never seen such an expression on Tom's face before. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry felt as if his legs were made of stone. He couldn’t lift his foot to take a step forward. Hearing those words from Tom had left him with a hollow feeling inside his stomach. They'd been together for five years, did Tom really not know his own place, his own <em>significance</em> in Harry's life ?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Why are you saying that?” Harry whispered softly. He knew he sounded heartbroken but he couldn’t help it. Hearing those words from the mouth of the man he loves made him feel as he was the unluckiest person in the world. He felt cold, empty, lost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom let out a bitter chuckle and Harry flinched when their glass dining table broke and crashed into the floor. Harry broke free from his stupor and ran to his lover whose uncontrolled magic was breaking everything around them now. Harry wrapped his arms around Tom’s waist and whispered in Tom’s chest, hoping that his voice will reach Tom’s anger dazed mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Tom!  Please! It’s alright – I won’t leave you. I will always stay by your side. Please!” Harry closed his eyes as he felt tears sliding down his cheeks, his voice muffled as he spoke softly in his boyfriend’s chest. “Please. Calm down, darling. You know how much I care for you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What has happened to Tom ? Anger, pure, unadulterated rage was coming of off Tom in waves. Tom was seething. This wasn’t normal, Harry knew that. Tom did have a temper but he was always- so controlled. He rarely lashed out like this. And never with him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He’ll kill whoever is responsible for his boyfriend’s anguish.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom snapped out of his anger induced haze when Harry’s sobs registered in his mind. What was he thinking letting his anger get the better of him? He looked around him and grimaced as he saw the utter destruction his magic had wrought upon the kitchen and dining room. He tightened his hold on Harry’s slender waist and felt a tremor go through Harry as he tugged the younger man closer to him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry whimpered as Tom’s hold tightened around his waist. What has happened to Tom?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How could he do this to his and Harry’s home? Since when did those vermins opinion mattered to him. Tom gritted his teeth in frustration. The urge to kill them was so strong that he didn’t know what to do anymore.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How can he even let those vile, lowlives words get to him? He knew Harry loved him. <em>He knew it.</em> Harry knew everything about him, everything. There were no secrets between them, there never had been.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the start of their relationship, they’d been honest to each other and never ever hid anything from the other.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most importantly, Harry was the one who understood him the most, the only one in fact. Even his parents came second to Harry. He was Harry’s in every way just like Harry was his.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why did he let doubt creep into his mind? Tom closed his eyes and tried to block out <em>those</em> words. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was the most powerful wizard in Britain. It was laughable at best the way Harry’s so called friends had tried to intimidate him at beginning. They knew who he was, everyone knew about him and his accomplishments, they knew what he could do. They all knew what he was capable of.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How dare they look down on him?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At first, he’d thought they were just concerned, as friends sometimes are. But he’d realised very soon he was wrong.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Did Draco Malfoy and his stupid family really think Malfoy or fucking Black name meant anything in front of the Heir of Slytherin? His blood was purer than any purebloods. He was Salazar’s Slytherin’s heir, one of the greatest wizards of all time. He could perform magic most wizarding community could only dream of.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His father was royalty and his blood was thousand times better than the idiots could ever be.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom disliked, no, dislike couldn’t even cover what he felt for Harry’s friends. Except for the odd girl Luna and the quiet boy Neville, all of Harry’s friends were beyond repulsive and gross. They thought they were very clever with their idle remarks and offhand comments about him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They weren’t.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For Harry’s sake he hadn’t said anything for last five years.  But he can’t tolerate their behavior any longer. <em>He will not tolerate it any longer.</em> That restaurant debacle was the beginning of the end. And that conversation which he’d coincidentally heard few hours ago-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After that, there really was no going back. They are going to pay dearly for everything.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry might be naïve and think the best of them, but he wasn’t an idiot. He had noticed from the very beginning how the mudblood and her red headed boyfriend had looked at him. He had seen them shooting distrustful looks at him when they thought him and Harry were busy with something else.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron Weasley at least had some redeeming points, he wasn’t a homophobe like his mental sister and his know it all girlfriend. Neither was he willing to stay by their side any longer. The naïve idiot didn’t even know what they thought about his elder brother’s wife. They wanted to chop her into little pieces and throw her body into the river for animals to eat, hoping to save Bill Weasley from her influence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As if.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was just jealously rearing its ugly head. The two females could take birth a thousand times and still could not be as good looking as Fleur Delacour - Weasley.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sometimes being a Legilimens around idiots like Harry’s friends was a headache. Their vile thoughts were too loud for anyone to ignore.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No wonder Bill, Charlie and Percy Weasley had cut off ties with their family long ago. They were smart. And the twins disgust for their horrid mother was known to everyone in the magical community of Britain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom’s hold tightened on Harry’s waist as he recalled what Malfoy had said a few hours ago. His hand holding onto his yew wand started shaking in rage as he remembered that. No, they have gone too far.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom had seen Draco Malfoy’s fake concern for Harry from the beginning. The stupid idiot  had even threatened him with some plebeian curse. Apparently, Malfoys had knowledge of a curse that would destroy a wizard.</p>
<p>What a load of rubbish.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He’d seen the way Draco had looked at his Harry.  He had wanted to gouge out the stupid ferret’s eyes for having the audacity to look at his love.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom knows very well what the horrid mudblood, Weasley’s bitch sister and her boyfriends excluding the main one, Zabini, thought about him and Harry. No, he will kill that slut who opens her legs for any guy along with her two outspoken fuck buddies. Malfoy, the know it all bitch and she - Weasley didn’t know who they were messing with.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If that’s what it meant to be straight, well, he was pretty happy he and Harry weren’t straight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These friends of Harry’s and Ron's pathetic mother were so deranged and vile that he was surprised that anyone could even tolerate their presence near them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He trusted Harry, he loved him. He knew Harry loved him, damn it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But somewhere in his heart, he had let doubt creep in.</p>
