    <p align="justify">When Harry Potter came to Hogwarts, he surprised everybody. Depending on the person, they expected various things: from a pampered brat to an adventurous but well mannered boy to a golden hero. What they certainly didn’t expect, was this child, too thin for it to be healthy, with head shaved almost to the bone, Avada Kedavra-green eyes shining out of a dark-colored face. Even when he sat on the stole and they waited waited, waited, <em>waited</em>...they didn’t expect...<em>”Slytherin!”</em></p><p align="justify">Quickly they hailed him either a magical prodigy or a cheating slob because<em> certainly James Potter’s son couldn’t be any good at potions</em>. What infuriated some of Harry’s classmates and gave others a new reason to admire him (until he moved and they saw what color of tie was he wearing) was that he couldn’t explain how he understood what he did. After the first few times when his explanations basically boiled down to “you just have to feel it”, the other first years gave up on trying, not without muttering about people too stuck up for their own good. What they didn’t know, was that the reason for Harry feeling so natural with magic wasn’t, in any way, a matter of envy.</p><p align="justify">The vast majority of Harry’s teachers back in Surrey believed him to be a rather dull child and a troublemaker. The former because Harry learned very early in his life that if he wants to get anything for dinner, he shouldn’t bring home better grades than Dudley. The latter because of a few situations connected with the color of his teacher’s wig or Harry ending up on the school’s roof. Harry, however, was a bright child and quickly realized that other kids don’t talk with snakes, can’t make create lights out of nothing, and definitely don’t have the ability to regrow their hair overnight. For the first time in his life (at least in his memory), Harry found himself at an advantage. So he practiced and practiced and <em>practiced</em>. And he learned how to open locked doors without a key, how to burn things without touching them, how to summon stuff into his hand. He just felt this weird tingling and he knew how to get it done. And then he learned it was magic that sung in his veins and he vowed to himself that he would be the best damn wizard they have ever seen.</p><p align="justify">The world will never know what hit them. </p>
