    <p>Perhaps it was the heady feeling of being in Chicago where they didn’t know anyone and could be out and open the way they couldn’t in London.  Perhaps it was the absolute shock of seeing Lavender Brown five years out of Hogwarts, in a leather bar, in Chicago, with her sub.  Perhaps it was the sheer annoyance when Lavender not only touched his collar, but screeched, “Oh my GOD, Harry…. But you don’t have a submissive bone in your body!” then started giggling in a way that made him wonder if they were still 11 years old at Hogwarts.  Regardless of <em>why</em>, regardless of what had driven him to do something so completely impulsive, Harry was sure he was in it and in it deep.  Which is why he quickly knelt down at Draco’s beautifully booted feet in the middle of a very crowded bar and started licking as though his life depended on it.  He was sure his ass did.    </p><p>Calmed by the familiarity of the scent of polish, the taste of salt from the road, and the feel of leather on his tongue, Harry ran through their evening thus far.  He had been left at the bar with instructions to buy two beers while Draco went to the lav.  Their usual rule was that he not speak in public while collared except as necessary to Draco, and to Draco only, or with Draco’s permission, so when Draco returned to find Harry speaking to Lavender he raised his eyebrow in question.  Of course, he couldn’t hear a word of what was being said.  All Harry would have had to have done at that point was explain that he was simply asking the stupid bint to remove her hand from his collar.  The evening would most likely have progressed pleasantly enough from there.  But he didn’t explain himself.  No, instead he got pissy about being brought to heel in front of a schoolmate, rolled his eyes, and huffed at Draco.  And Draco… well, Draco just didn’t do eye rolling.  Nor huffing.  He had explained that at some length the first time Harry had eye rolled and huffed, and on every subsequent occasion he had explained again, usually with a strap but sometimes with a cane, that he did not do huffing and eye rolling.  And now, of all things, Harry had huffed and eye rolled in public and in front of another dominant (although, fuck, Lav as a dom was just impossible to take seriously).</p><p>All thinking done in seconds, he realized that treating Sir’s boot like a pacifier while his mind wandered over events was hardly the right headspace for bootlicking.  He tried to refocus his energy, but at that moment a man tripped over him.</p><p>Draco caught the falling man before he hit the bar and righted him.  He sounded for all the world like a member of the landed gentry at a golf club rather than a leatherman at a leather bar as he apologized for his inconsiderate sub.  He then turned his attention to Harry, grabbing his hair roughly and hauling him to his feet.  He glared coldly at his boy, still pulling up uncomfortably on his hair, waiting until he had Harry’s full attention before growling, “What.  The hell.  Has gotten into you?”  He shook Harry by his hair with each phrase.  “You do not,” <em>shake</em> “roll your eyes” <em>jerk </em>“at me.” <em>Rattle</em> .  “You do not,” <em>shake</em>, “huff” <em>jerk</em> “at me.”  <em>Pull</em>.  “And you damn well,” <em>shake</em>, “do not lick my boots” <em>yank, </em>“without having” <em>jerk </em>“earned it.”  Draco let go of Harry’s hair before continuing in a voice so soft Harry had to lean in to hear it, “I don’t even fucking know where your head was while you were licking them.  It certainly wasn’t on me or my pleasure.  Bad enough that you did it without permission and in the middle of a crowded bar where someone was bound to trip on you.  We will discuss this further at the hotel.  Get the beer and keep your mouth shut for the rest of the evening.”</p><p>Harry was on his best behavior for the rest of the evening, the fluttering feeling of anxiety and anticipation never entirely leaving his belly.  Draco watched the tension slowly wear on his boy for a couple of hours before sending him ahead to the hotel with instructions to lay out his pajamas and draw him a bath.  Harry hurried and did as asked, now completely mindful of his Sir’s pleasure.  He then stripped off and knelt next to the bed to wait, his erection hard and exposed between his spread thighs.  “I don’t know what you are excited about,” he said to his cock, “punishment from Draco is never fun, and a punishment for publicly acting out in front of another dom [ha!  Lavender a dom.]… hell.”</p><p>Time passed.  Too soon and not soon enough Harry heard Draco swipe the lock.  Harry stiffened his posture, straightening his arms behind his back to push his chest forward, and ducked his head.  Draco stood behind him for a few long minutes before ordering him into the bathroom.  “Undress me.”  Harry tried to give his full attention to Draco while unbuttoning his shirt, but his mind was fixed on the coming punishment and his hands shook on the buttons.  Draco glared at him, unmoving, as he struggled with his task.  He wouldn’t give Harry any words of comfort.  They would be disingenuous given what he was going to do after his bath.  Finally, Harry finished with the shirt and Draco, not wanting the bath to get cold, grabbed him by the face and shoved him away hard enough that he stumbled into the wall before undressing himself the rest of the way.  Harry washed him, alternately rushing to get his punishment over with as soon as possible and trying to draw things out to hold off the inevitable.  Not his best service ever, Draco thought to himself.  Harry was dejectedly thinking the same thing. </p><p>Soon enough the bath was over and Draco pulled on a pair of black pajama bottoms.  Ordinarily, Draco would give a curt order to assume one position or another in a particular place while awaiting punishment, but he was enjoying Harry’s discomfort at not knowing whether he was doing the right thing.  He left Harry standing awkwardly to the side of the room while he transfigured a nursery and senior cane from their toothbrushes, as well as some cuffs from the washcloths.  He laid out his tools neatly on the bed.  Deciding the lamps would be plenty of light, he transfigured the overhead into a hard point.  He grabbed his belt from the dresser and put it with his other equipment.  He then turned his attention back to his boy, who was staring wide eyed at the collection on the bed.  None of it was particularly imaginative, but all could be used to cause a significant amount of pain with minimal work on Draco’s part.  The little nursery cane was incongruous, though, and somehow all the more threatening for not fitting in with the more serious implements.</p><p>Draco sat on the edge of the bed with his knees casually apart, and pointed to the floor at his feet.  Harry ducked his head and knelt, a thin sheen of sweat already marking his brow.  Draco began, in a quiet and reasonable tone, “Harry, we have been together for 3 years now.  Very early on, I told you that I expected verbal communication appropriate to your age and station.  You are simply too old, and too accomplished, and too … famous… to roll your eyes and huff.  It is beneath you, and it is displeasing to me.”</p><p>“Sir, I’m so sorry, I was….”</p><p>“Quiet!” Draco barked.  Harry fell silent again and Draco waited a moment before continuing in the same reasonable tone he had started with.  “If you had used your words earlier, it could have been a very pleasant evening.  Since you gave up your chance to use your words then, you will not use them now.  Animal sounds only until I tell you otherwise.  You may grunt, groan, weep, sob, and scream, but the only word I want to hear tonight is your safeword if you need it.”</p><p>“Yes, S…” Harry started before an open handed slap across the face cut him off.  Harry looked up, startled before his face clouded over with anger, “Fuck!”</p><p>Another smack landed on the opposite cheek, before Draco continued, “Fuck is not your safeword, boy.”  Harry ducked his head again, allowing Draco to continue.  “I realize seeing an old friend…”</p><p>“She’s not a…”</p><p><em>Smack.</em>  “makes it hard to bear correction, however there are certain standards which I expect you to maintain.  On your feet.  Get your wand and give it to me.”  Harry hesitated a moment before getting his wand and laying it in Draco’s hand, kneeling again.  Who wouldn’t get their rocks off at the Slayer of Voldemort kneeling naked and defenseless… and voluntarily so… at their feet.  Draco tore himself away from the toppy feelings and used Harry’s wand to move the desk to the center of the room, under the hard point. </p><p>“Up, boy.  Bend over the desk, ass out, grab the other side.”  Harry looked over his shoulder briefly to see Draco pick up the senior cane.  He rested his right cheek on the desk, and grabbed the edge with white knuckles.  An erotic caning would start slowly and build, likely never hitting full force.  This caning, Harry new, would start full force.  What kind of idiot rolled his eyes at a Sir who could conjure a cane and knew how to use it?</p><p>Draco watched the tension build in his boy before finally stepping into position.  <em>Tap, tap… swish</em>.  Harry grunted at the impact, then moaned as the sensation blossomed.  He turned his face into the desk and pushed his forehead down against it, wishing Draco had told him how many, but knowing better than to ask.  Draco, with infinite self-control, waited a full minute before tapping for the next blow.  By the third stroke, Harry wanted to beg.  He sobbed instead.  After 12 strokes, Draco stopped and Harry thought he might be done.</p><p>Before he knew what was happening, Draco had locked the cuffs around his wrists.  “Kneel up on the desk for me, Harry.  Let your feet dangle over the side.”  He conjured some rope which ran through the eye bolt and attached to the cuffs.  A sticking charm held his shins in position on the desk and the rope shortened to pull Harry taut.  Harry’s eyes took on the slightly wild look that people get the moment they realize they are immobilized, then widened as he saw Draco take up the nursery cane.</p><p>Draco put a calming hand on Harry’s calf, but touched the nursery cane to the exposed and immobilized bottoms of his feet.   “Harry, I won’t lie, you’re going to feel this.  For the next few days, standing and sitting are going to be extremely painful for you.  You’ll likely feel something for a couple of weeks in your feet and ass.  In fact, the only really comfortable positions I plan on leaving you are on your knees or prostrated at my feet.  Remember, it’s okay to scream… safeword if you need it.”  And with that, Draco started caning the bottoms of Harry’s feet.  Harry screamed.</p><p>Finally, Draco stopped.  Harry didn’t think he could take anything else, but there was still the belt on the bed.  Draco cancelled the sticking charm and moved the desk back against the wall, adjusting the rope so that Harry’s feet just touched the floor.  He watched as Harry struggled to pull up on his cuffs to take the weight off his bruised feet.  Harry looked over his shoulder to see Draco taking up the strap.  Draco put his hand on the back of Harry’s neck to steady him.   “An obstinate slave gets his back whipped.  This is to remind you of your place.” Harry wept.</p><p> As Draco whipped his back, Harry once again wished he could beg Draco to stop, but had to content himself with crying, sobbing, and screaming until Draco decided he was done.  By the time it was over, his face was a mess of snot and tears.  Finally, he heard the strap hit the ground. Draco’s warm body pressed against his unmarked front, an arm reaching around his lower back in the only place left unbruised to support him as his wrists were released.  Draco laid him gently prone on the bed before laying down on his back next to him.  He conjured a warm washcloth and wiped away the sweat, snot and tears, then ran his fingers through Harry’s hair for a long while until the sobbing stopped.</p><p>Draco turned off the lights with his wand, then whispered in Harry’s ear, “I don’t think you deserve to suck my cock tonight, frankly, but I know how important it is for you to regain your connected feelings after this sort of punishment, so I’ve decided to let you.  But Harry, no teasing.  Just suck me off.  If you fuck around, I’m just going to put you on your knees, fuck your face, and you’ll sleep on the floor.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes in the darkness, and huffed silently before starting in.</p>
