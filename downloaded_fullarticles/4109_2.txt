          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus Lupin was sitting in the Staff Room dipping some chocolate biscuits in this tea, when he was interrupted by Professor McGonagall, who walked into the room carrying a package.</p><p>"Remus, could I request something of you? Harry Potter received the package and we're unsure of who sent it, would you mind taking a glance over it?"</p><p>Remus took a glance at the package and almost choked on his tea. After taking a moment to swallow, he looked at McGonagall with an eyebrow raised.</p><p>"Profess- I mean, Minerva, who exactly do you think sent this?"</p><p>"Well, Sirius Black! If he's planning to kill the boy a cursed broom would be a good way of finishing him off!"</p><p>"Well, I suppose in a way your right. Technically that broom was bought by Sirius Black."</p><p>Minerva gave him an odd look at this, "I know you were very close with the man, but how can you tell?"</p><p>"I gave it to him."</p><p>McGonagall's eyes widened at this, not entirely sure what to make of it, she seemed stunned into silence, so Remus continued.</p><p>"I hate to use my husbands money, but as this is Harry, I'm making an exception, besides, I need to take revenge some way, and spending mountains of his money on a broom for the boy everyone's certain he's trying to kill seems good enough."</p><p>"You sound as if you're saying you don't think he's come for Potter!"</p><p>Lupin gave a sad smile at this and his eyes seemed to cast downwards, as if he'd rather be doing anything but having this conversation.</p><p>"I know what he did, but it's hard not be biased... he may have killed my best friends and a dozen others, but he's still the man I loved..."</p><p>McGonagall stepped behind him and awkwardly put her hands around him, half hugging him, half patting his back.</p><p>It wasn't a great life Lupin had, but considering he met his Godson-in-law and got a stable job, his life seemed to be getting better. Bit by bit.</p></div>
