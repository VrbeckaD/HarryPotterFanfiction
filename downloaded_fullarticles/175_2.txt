        <strong>Chapter 1: No Cheater achieved Anything Ever!</strong>
      </p><p>Ron and Harry wandered into the Great Hall to see the legendary Goblet of Fire for the Triwizard Tournament and watch as the older students of Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons put their names in. There was a line barrier that the students needed to pass to put their name in the Goblet. Even though they were underage, the boys could only imagine what it could be like if they were older and able to enter. The two boys were in awe at the wooden cup. This one cup was going to change the lives of the Champions who won and one of the two boys wanted that more than anything.</p><p>"If we were only a few years older Harry, we could participate in the Triwizard Tournament!" Ron said. "It would be brilliant!"</p><p>"Better you than me," Harry said.</p><p>"Just think about it for a second, Harry," Ron continued, taking no notice of Harry's mention. "Me being called to play and winning the tournament would be a dream. I would finally get the notoriety that I always wanted."</p><p>Harry simply smiled at Ron's insight on the matter. Harry was not on the same view as Ron. Ron wanted fame and fortune. As for Harry, he simply wanted a simple life given his past for being the boy who lived and being known by which in the Wizarding World.</p><p>"Getting notoriety doesn't make your situation any better, Ron," Hermione said behind them starling both Harry and Ron.</p><p>"Be quiet, Hermione you would be jealous of all the fame and fortune I would get," Ron said.</p><p>"No, I would not I don't want to be part of the tournament at all. It sounds dangerous," Hermione replied.</p><p>"Oh poor Ronniniks," Fred said joining the conversation with his twin brother, George. "We see you can't join The Triwizard Tournament because you are too young, but I think we have a solution to that problem."</p><p>"Oh, what is that? How are you going to get past the age limit line? You are underage too!" Ron said. "Professor Dumbledore said he put a spell around the Goblet which will kick you out once you jump in."</p><p>"Oh dear naive brother of ours," George said. "We always have a trick up our sleeve." Fred and George took out of their pockets two vials of a green potion.</p><p>"Isn't that an aging potion?" Hermione asked.</p><p>"Spot on, Miss Granger," Fred smiled.</p><p>"So you aren't going to tell your own brother about this?" Ron said. "We could have shared."</p><p>"Nah, we couldn't risk it," George said.</p><p>"You know the more the names in the cup the fewer chances you will be called into playing in the Tournament," Fred said as Ron began to pout but his older brothers didn't have any sympathy for him and just laughed it off.</p><p>"That is not going to work," Hermione chimed in.</p><p>"Just watch, you will be surprised!" Fred said.</p><p>Harry, Hermione, and Ron stood back as the twins crossed arms and toasted to each other before drinking the green liquid out of the vial. They jumped into the line with some happy relief that they weren't kicked out immediately. but all happiness subsided when the twins were catapulted back to the other end of the room with white hair and white growing beards along with it. Ron and Harry cringed when they landed as Hermione rolled her eyes. Utterly humiliated the twins ran out of the room to go get their minor mishap fixed.</p><p>Days afterward on the day the names would be called out of the Goblet of Fire, Ron still daydreamed about being called and what he would do with the subsequent money and fame he would win after winning the Triwizard Tournament.</p><p>"Ron, will you quit daydreaming about being called out for the Tournament!" Hermione exclaimed snapped Ron back to reality. "Don't you think it's going to be dangerous if you actually get called."</p><p>Ron shook his head, "Hell Hermione, you worry too much. They are going to probably make it a lot safer this time around. Harry would join me in this argument as well. Don't you Harry you would jump at the chance of getting into Triwizard Tournament if you had the chance and were old enough?"</p><p>"I actually don't want to join the Triwizard Tournament," Harry said. "I think it's a fun idea but I don't think it's for me."</p><p>"See he wouldn't do that..." Hermione started but Ron was already tuning her out. Ron observed Harry and Hermione talk about the upcoming tournament. Harry continued his argument of watching it would be cool while Hermione expressed her thoughts that this whole tournament was stupid. As they continue to talk, Ron felt an insignificant burning sensation arousing in his body as he watched. He didn't understand why his body was burning at that moment, but he dismissed it and thought it was a hunger pain slowly growing.</p><p>Professor Dumbledore caught the last piece of parchment that flew out of the goblet. The last of the Triwizard Tournament participants were already called so this was a little suspicious. Everybody in the room, professors and students, were confused about who else would be participating in the tournament.</p><p>"Harry Potter!" Professor Dumbledore announced to the Great Hall. Harry was utterly bewildered to the announcement. He did not want to be a part of these games, like explained to Ron and Hermione time and time again, unlike his peers who wanted nothing but to be in the tournament and winning the gold for themselves. The cold envy could be felt all around the room and they were all directed to Harry everyone including Ronald Weasley his best friend. Hermione Granger his more sensible friend shook him back to reality and he answered Dumbledore's call.</p><p>Ron continued to glare at his supposedly best friend as he went up to join the other champions in the room adjacent of the Great Hall later followed by every Hogwarts teacher. <em>Things always had to be Harry's way. Nothing with his best friend, Nothing I could do to be called a hero myself or something to share the limelight in. He has everything the fame, the fortune. He must have to drink a potion or cast a spell to make himself to be older to be in this tournament. Yeah, that was what he wanted more and the Triwizard Tournament was the best way to get notoriety in the Wizarding World. </em>Ron assumed.</p><p>"Can you believe this, Hermione?" Ron scoffed.</p><p>"Shut up, Ron!" She says elbowing him to knock it off. Ron rolled his eyes at her.</p><p><em>Whatever she always picked sides between us two and it was always Harry's. Can't she see Harry wanted this! Harry is the boy who fucking lived just add one more title to that already existing name. But it shouldn't be a Triwizard Tournament champion but a fucking liar! </em>Ron continued to consider.</p><p>Professor McGonagall came back out to announce to the rest of Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang students to go back to their dorms and wait for further instruction by their head house.</p><p>As Ron went back to Gryffindor Tower with Hermione walking with him, he noticed Hermione kept on looking back over her shoulder for Harry. Something Ron didn't understand why Hermione was doing this when she should already know Harry was doing this on purpose; for his own benefit. Just thinking about Harry somehow getting his name into the goblet and getting away with it made Ron feel fire all over.</p><p>"Forget about him, Hermione," Ron said.</p><p>Hermione whipped her head around so fast Ron could hear the air crack with a glare upon her face. Ron jumped not knowing what she would do next as she went ahead of Ron into the portrait hole. "I see she is up her own ass with this," He mumbled low she couldn't come back to retaliate or worse scold him.</p><p>About an hour and a half later Professor McGonagall and Harry comes through the portrait hole explaining Harry will participate in the Triwizard Tournament this year. The rest of Gryffindor either scoffed or booed at the idea, but it was short lived when Professor McGonagall shooed everyone to bed.</p><p>Harry was the last one in his year to enter their shared dorm room. He was greeted by his best friend Ron in the most snark he has ever heard from him.</p><p>"Oh, look it's the Triwizard champion Cedri- oh wait it's the fame seeker and cheater Harry Potter."</p><p>"Ron, you know I didn't put my name into the Goblet of Fire, you have to believe me," Harry replied. "You know I don't want to do this. I don't need the money. I don't need any more notoriety than I already have. Please believe me!"</p><p>"Yeah, right!" Ron said.</p><p>"Ron!" Harry confused.</p><p>Ron ignored him and pulls the curtains around his bed him away from his now ex-friend. Harry looked around the Dormitory and saw that Seamus, Neville, and Dean were doing the same closing the curtains to their beds and ignoring the supposed cheater of the Triwizard Tournament.</p><p>That next morning Harry came down from his dormitory to find Hermione getting ready for breakfast that morning. timid in his actions he walked towards her hoping to not get a big reaction of her. "Hi, Hermione..."Harry said.</p><p>" good morning Harry," Hermione smiled surprising Harry but in the back of his mind he reminds himself to keep things as simple as possible he replied with:</p><p>"So about yesterday...You believe me right Hermione?" He was losing hope this newfound hatred of Harry all around Hogwarts with something unheard of. Harry did have his fair share of enemies like Draco Malfoy and Professor Snape but the whole school was a level that Harry never thought he would ever hit.</p><p>Hermione was flabbergasted to the fact that he asked, " Harry you don't even have to ask that question. I know that you didn't want to be in this tournament at all."</p><p>Harry's face lit up at the sound of those words at least one person believed him and was not going to blame him for something that he knew that he never would've done.</p><p>"Thank you so much, Hermione," Harry said taking her hand gazing into her eyes with an overjoyed distinction in his eyes. There was hope for him after all. Afterward, Harry and Hermione decided to have a small morning picnic under a tree in the courtyard near the Forbidden Forest. They both could have sat with the rest of the Gryffindors in the Great Hall but Harry knew it would be a nightmare just by sitting there so he recommended this, good thing Hermione thought it would be nice.</p><p>"Are you nervous about the tournament, Harry?" Hermione asked.</p><p>"To some extent."Harry sighed. "But I want to know is why is everyone else doesn't believe me?"</p><p>"They want to be in your place," Hermione explained. "I think that's why Ron is being such a git. Ron wants nothing, but to be better than his brothers and, to some extent, Ginny and you getting into this tournament he feels as though he's insignificant to everyone he crossed paths with. He's friends with the boy who lived and his brothers are doing well for themselves and he is doing nothing extraordinary."</p><p>"You're ahead of him as well, Hermione."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"You're the brightest witch of our age so both of his friends are excelling and he's not."</p><p>"Yeah, I guess he can be jealous of both of us. At least he's still talking to me maybe I can change his mind."</p><p>"Let's hope so..." Harry took another bite of his sandwich when a blond Ravenclaw female student came towards them. Harry and Hermione looked at each other baffled to who she was. They barely knew anyone from Ravenclaw personally, but for Cho Chang and that wasn't even personally; it was more acquaintance situation with her. This Ravenclaw student was younger than them maybe about a year under them or two. They for sure knew she wasn't older than them by any means.</p><p>"Hello," The young girl said to Harry.</p><p>"Hello?" Harry replied.</p><p>"I am Luna Lovegood, I am a 3rd year Ravenclaw. I want you to know I know you didn't put your name into the Goblet. I know it couldn't possibly be you who put your name in. I want to let you know I will be cheering for you as well."The girl said nervously.</p><p>Harry gained the biggest smile upon his face when she expressed her support. One more person that believes him at least. "Thank you so much, Luna, it means a lot to me!"</p><p>"You're welcome," Luna bowed her head slightly to both of them. "Bye!"</p><p>She skipped back up to the Hogwarts Castle. Hermione turned to Harry once more, "That girl was weird."</p><p>"She may be weird but I have one more person to add to my team who believe me." Harry beamed. Hermione shrugged in response.</p><p>All that next week Ron refused to talk to Harry along with most of Hogwarts. Ron would go back into his mind when things got bored in his classes would go back into his mind and think on how Harry really did it. At one point Ron thought that maybe one of the Durmstrang teachers gave him a potion to make him physically older to put his name into the Goblet of Fire. Or maybe there was a possibility he asked someone to put his name in but who would do it was still a mystery to Ron.</p><p>During this time Hermione was the only one talking to the both of them. Even though her intentions are good, Ron was starting to get more and more irritated she was doing this.</p><p>"Hermione, stop being a saint a pick between one of us," Ron burst out at her one day while walking to class.</p><p>"Ron, you know I can't do that, you're both my friends," Hermione said.</p><p>"Well, I believe you should pick between him or me. And I think you should choose carefully because he is a liar and a cheater for getting into the tournament when he's not even of age yet."</p><p>"You know this whole debacle it's not his fault. You know he is just as worried and scared about this tournament than anybody else in it!"</p><p>"Please, Hermione he has continuously lie to you. All he wants is the money and the fame that comes with playing in this tournament. He just wants what everybody else wants the fame and fortune but for him, it's more of an added title to his already name of the boy who lived."</p><p>Hermione gaped at his words, "I didn't know that you had this much negatively towards Harry and all he wants is your companionship."</p><p>"Companionship? Hermione after he wins the tournament or even the first task he will never need companionship anymore. Guys will jump at the opportunity to be his best mate and girls will be all over him especially the purebloods having his kid would set them for life. Hell, I don't believe you haven't even jumped your chance yet Hermione your status will be through the roof once you get with him."</p><p>Hermione glowered at Ron, "What are you trying to say for that last part, Ron?"</p><p>"Isn't it obvious in The Wizarding World you are in the lowest status and with a legendary boy like him, the Harry Potter. I don't believe it when you say you haven't jumped at the chance to be with him and you have no competition ahead of you. You must be a fool. Or that's what you're doing right now on your knees every night? Is the view good? Is the way he looks upon your face the best thing that has ever happened to you? Does he tell you your beautiful? Does it taste good? Oh my Merlin, you are the brightest witch of our age you probably already thought about it way before I even thought of it. Hell, are you pregnant now?" Ron extended his arm close to her stomach but Hermione slapped it away before he even touched her.</p><p>Hermione clenched her fists as her nose flared, slowly losing her self control. She stopped in her tracks. "Ron I want you to take everything back before you ruin everything, now!"</p><p>"And why should I? I know what you do with him and guess what he's going to throw you away just for another one in your place maybe even someone with more experience. Hell, you might leave him once you get the news that you want."</p><p>Hermione was astonished at Ron's words. She has never felt so low in her life. Trying to keep it together and not start a yelling battle between him or worst slapping him into oblivion, Hermione exhaled trying to keep her cool. "Ron you want me to pick a side I think I just did!"</p><p>"Oh, well run to Harry then see if I care but I'll keep your secret but all bets are off once I find you and him the closet together!" Ron called out letting a few people overhear the conversation.</p><p>Hermione stormed off in the other direction having enough of this dead conversation to a now dead person to her who would never understand her or Harry. '<em>How dare he say all this stuff about us, his friends?!'</em> Hermione thought before the tears started streaming down her face. '<em>Who does he take Harry and me for?'</em></p><p>Ron's body raged up like fire again he knew she would resort to him sooner or later. He didn't know if all that he said was true but in a way, it would be true sometime in the future. He was never the first person on her mind. Harry Potter was always on her mind first, so good riddance to her. Ron split in her general direction.</p><p>But that was not the end of it, later that night Harry came up to the dormitory red-faced and ready to defend Hermione. Ron was the only one there and was trying to find a book in his bag when Harry burst through the door.</p><p>"Ron you can be mad at me being a hellspawn for entering this tournament even though I clearly said I never did but do not blame Hermione for anything." Harry ranted.</p><p>"What's the problem? She wanted to be with you. Wasn't she willing to blow you?" Ron replied continuing looking for what he was looking for.</p><p>"No! That is not the point Ron. You went out of your way to actually call her a slag."</p><p>"And who am I to blame her! Hell at this point in time you can take whatever you can get and guess what she would be a willing participant!"</p><p>Harry exhaled trying to keep his temperament to a minimum even though he really wanted to punch him in the face, "Ron we just want you to believe us and that's not just only for Hermione it goes for me too. I wouldn't want her to do that. Hell before the names was called I told you that I never wanted to be in this. I had enough of this type of treatment all my life I just want to live a simple life like you-"</p><p>"No, you do not want to be like me that's what you don't get. The last boy out of all your family and when you were born your mother wanted a daughter. Always overshadowed by your brothers and your little sister because of things like 'oh Percy you got to be a prefect again' Or 'Bill did this and Charlie traveling the world while I do nothing that excites my family to fawn over me."</p><p>"I'm sorry for wanting that Ron but your family is like a family to me I never had one and they were happy to accept me in. There is no need to blame me for gaining more attention just because I was born a person that I'll probably never live up to be ever again."</p><p>"So doing this tournament will give you another title to your name I understand completely, as a sidekick to a hero. You know what you can replace me at any time they will always be a sidekick to your hero, Harry. And guess what I'm probably the best sidekick you'll ever have and I don't want to be that person in your life. You're a cheater and a liar you want nothing but your name plastered everywhere. Also, my family is not your family to claim! I don't need another person to upstage me to be included in my family so piss off!" Ron gave up his search for his book and stormed out shoving Harry in the process with his arm, leaving Harry in a distraught state. Was Ron really that mad at him for something he didn't even do?</p><p>"<em>Number one rule from now on never trust Harry Potter or anything he says, nothing!</em>" Ron said to himself as he walked out of Gryffindor Tower. He needs to take a walk there was too much to handle in one day. Two best friends left him just because they can see the flaws and the debauchery that was happening. Harry was lying and everyone knew that but Hermione and Harry at this point. Hell at this point Harry was lying to himself. He didn't need to be friends with a glorified savior. He needed to change his environment for the better or better yet to benefit himself.</p><p>It was early evening when Ron reached the courtyard to begin his brainstorming on how to go on from here because he was most definitely not returning to his ex-best friends.</p><p>"Oh look who it is the Weasel!"An arrogant voice said behind him. Ron knew exactly who he was when he uttered his first word.</p><p>"Fuck off Malfoy, it's not a good day."Ron kept on walking in the opposite direction of Draco Malfoy.</p><p>"Oh, who's got you pissed off?" Draco jeered. "And it wasn't me? Maybe someone more terrible than me? Was it your mum?"</p><p>"Shut up Malfoy I'm in the mood to punch," Ron said turning a walk in small trot to leave him behind.</p><p>Draco saw what he was trying to do and caught up with him, "So it wasn't your mum maybe it was Potter."</p><p>"Wow, I even hate the name now," Ron mumbled but Draco heard it and garnered a sly smile to his face.</p><p>"Yeah, Potter was always that type of name you will always hate," Draco agreed. "But what really happened between you two?"</p><p>"You know what happened this whole tournament is what happened. He is a fucking dirty liar and I know it."</p><p>"Yes, we all knew he was a narcissistic twat even before this stupid Triwizard Tournament. The thing I don't get is why do you enable him so many times?"</p><p>"I didn't know that I was doing it until now," Ron confessed.</p><p>"Typical weasel stuff always in the background letting other people step all over them." Draco mocked.</p><p>"Do you have anything else better to do Malfoy than insult me. I'm trying to think what to do next in my life without the supposed savior."</p><p>"Well since you are thinking what to do next without Potter in your life, I was thinking we should get revenge on Potter ourselves."</p><p>"Us two! No way! There has to be something a catch!" Ron sneered.</p><p>"No, no catch. That's all I want is to put Potter in his place. I believe you want that as well. So what do you say?"</p><p>"No!" Ron trotted faster away from Draco as he stops chasing him as he called out. "I will give you about two weeks to think about it I think you'll come around and once you have made your decision meet me again and tell me I'm ready."</p><p>Ron sneered at Draco's snide remark. There was no way in hell he was going to work with Draco even if it was for revenge on a person they both despise at the moment. Ron continued his walk not even giving Draco a second thought.</p><p>Meanwhile...</p><p>Harry climbed down to the Gryffindor common room after Ron stormed out to find Hermione reading on the couch by the fireplace. At this point, Harry thought Ron wouldn't believe him no matter what he said. Harry found himself more and more alone the past few days than his younger years at the Dursley's. Even when he was living there the feeling of loneliness didn't feel this despairingly dreadful. Ron was his first real friend in his life and now he couldn't believe the words he was saying. Ron virtually called Harry a senseless cheater and Hermione a girl who only wanted Harry for his baby juice for a higher status. Harry couldn't wrap his head around why Ron went from a trusting and loyal friend to a person who thought he was the vilest person on the planet. Harry sighed this fight would be harder to settle than any other fight between the golden trio that ever happen before it.</p><p>"Ron is still not believing us," Hermione asked.</p><p>"No," Harry said. "I'm sorry Ron insinuated you were a nice shag to me than a friend. I don't know what has gotten into him. He would never say that."</p><p>"Harry, why are you saying sorry to me?" Hermione said flipping a page in her book. "Ron said all those things, not you. You would never think of me that way anyway."</p><p>Harry joined her on the couch and folding his arms. "Yeah, I just felt I needed to say something in place of Ron."</p><p>"Thank you, Harry but you are not him."</p><p>"I am hopeful that he will come around soon. This tournament has made Hogwarts little bit more lonely than it should be."</p><p>"I'm here if you want to talk, Harry."</p><p>"If I take you up on the offer would not nag me to do homework?"</p><p>Hermione sighed and looked him into his green eyes, "Okay Harry I'll keep it to a minimum."</p><p>"Thanks..."</p><p>A few weeks go by Ron was busy into his potions work one day, the only time that week he had taken his mind off of Harry. He wasn't talking to Harry or Hermione ever since the fight he thought to himself he burns those bridges and he was never looking back. In Ron's mind, Harry and Hermione were the couple they always wanted to be without him. He had better friends in Seamus and Dean then Harry or Hermione could ever be. The three of them like to play Quidditch and were already placing bets on which Champion would win the Triwizard Tournament. All of them voted for Krum to win. Ron's new set of friends were better than Harry and Hermione in every way there was no possible way he would change this anytime. The knocking at the door was inevitable But what comes next would be the defining moment in Ron's mind.</p><p>"Hello!" a shrill high pitched woman's voice came through the door as Professor Snape open the door not even having enough time to control the situation before this woman barged right in. The woman was a blonde haired who carried a crocodile-skin bag in her hand while a piece of parchment and quill drift through the air behind her. "I am Rita Skeeter. I am a journalist from the Daily Prophet. I am escorting all of the Champions that will be in the Triwizard Tournament this year into a meeting with me for interviews and photo ops. I would like to meet Mr. Harry Potter and I wish for him to come with me! Is he here?" She looked around curiously for him. Harry look meekly at this strange woman. He had never met anyone from the Daily Prophet before and he secretly hoped the other journalists at the Daily Prophet did not act like this.</p><p>Professor Snape grumbled at this woman's actions and snapped at Harry for him to come. Harry quickly put his books into his bag and went to this Rita Skeeter. Rita Skeeter greeted Harry with a handshake but Harry's face read he didn't want to meet this woman at this time. With Rita Skeeter's entrance, Harry felt as though this woman was making a scene to make a scene. Some of the girls in the class, for example, Lavender and Parvati were very interested in what Rita Skeeter had to say even though it wasn't much they thought her enthusiasm was fun. While the rest of the class thought of her as annoying.</p><p>Ron, on the other hand, did not see Harry's timid face; he saw Harry gleefully take Rita Skeeter's hand as they both led their way out of the potions classroom. '<em>This was probably the moment Harry was waiting for the tabloids will have a field day with him. 'Damn him! He doesn't deserve this! He should let someone else being that limelight...someone like Viktor Krum or the real Hogwarts champion Cedric Diggory!</em>' Ron thought. He found Draco on the other side of the room. They meet each other eyes and Ron nodded to him as Draco gained a smile. '<em>Maybe I should take Draco at his offer. Harry has been living in the spotlight for too long, time for him to get his retribution</em>.'</p></div></div></div>
