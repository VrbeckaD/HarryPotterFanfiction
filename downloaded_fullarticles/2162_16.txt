    <p>Three weeks.Three sleep deprived, stressful, agonizing weeks since Hermione's disastrous adventure to Hades. The notorious nightspot in Knockturn Alley. Three weeks since Lucius Malfoy ruined her for any other sexual partner; forever.</p><p>She had tried to forget about it. About the way he had danced with her in his office. His firm body pressed against hers as his tongue did wicked things in her ear which made her knees wobble. Nope. She wasn't going to think about it. Not at all.</p><p>He was married for Merlin's sakes! She had gone to school with his son, who detested her! Used the most derogatory name in the wizarding world for her! How could she even live with herself after what had happened on Samhain night? </p><p>She was in two minds to obliviate the whole ordeal from her memory and try and get on with her life. Her sorry excuse of a life in which even her elderly cat was getting more action.</p><p>The reality was; Hermione hadn't realised what she was missing out on in terms of her sexual needs. Her brain was stimulated enough through work and reading. She saw her friends often but there was no one to help her stave off the thoughts that came unbidden at night. </p><p>She had even gone as far as ordering a selection of adult toys from “Sultry Succubus” to help scratch that particular itch but everything came up short in comparison to him.</p><p>Since that day she received the Owl with the VIP membership card for Hades, she hadn't heard from the wizard at all. </p><p>At first, she had wanted to send the membership card back in disgust. However, she never got around to doing so and it still sat in her bottom drawer in her office at the Ministry.</p><p>She had pushed back her final visit to his manor in order to observe the elves but the truth was she didn't want to step foot inside the premises again. She had tried desperately to ignore his very existence, however, the more she tried not to acknowledge him, the more persistent his existent became. Nearly every day his name and photo were in the newspaper for some charitable work or donation. His wife was always beside him in the photos. Looking elegant and her hair always perfectly coiffed. Hermione's own wild brown curls would never look so polished, even with a whole bottle of ‘Sleekeazy’ on her head.</p><p>And then there were the Ministry visits. At first, she almost ended up in the same elevator as him but noticed him just in time and doubled back. Thankfully he was too busy speaking with  Mr Tenaman from the Department of International Magical Cooperation to see her. The next time he was walking down the corridor and she had to hide behind a column until the wizard passed. Her dreams that night were full of what would have happened if Lucius had discovered her in her hiding spot.</p><p>“Excuse me, Miss?” A voice brought her around from her daydreaming and she blinked and looked into the face of a young man with short brown hair and startling blue eyes.</p><p>“Are you going to buy that book? You've been staring at the same page for the past 15 minutes.”</p><p>Hermione looked down at the book in her hands and blushed when she read the title at the top of the page.</p><p>‘Unlocking the Divine Witch Within.’ </p><p>She closed the book abruptly. “Yes!” She exclaimed. The shop assistant gave her a rakish smile. </p><p>“Okay, is there anything else you need help with?”</p><p>“No, thank you.” She murmured. The bell on the door rang and the shop assistant went to see who it was, leaving Hermione to collect her thoughts. She was just about to leave the narrow passageway of bookcases when a voice stopped her in her tracks.</p><p>“I'm here to pick up the book I ordered last week.”</p><p>It was him. There was no mistaking his aristocratic drawl. Hermione clutched the book to her chest in order to stop her wildly beating heart from leaping out. </p><p>“Certainly Sir. I will just get it for you.” Replied the shop assistant. Hermione heard him walking away from the cashier's desk and a steady tapping noise. </p><p>‘This is ridiculous! What am I doing? He can't stop me from living my life!’ Hermione berated herself and took a few steps along the passageway. She stopped and took a peak around the bookcase. There he was. He had his back to her and she saw his perfect long, straight, blonde hair, like a white waterfall down his back. The tapping noise was from the serpent-headed cane that he was tapping idly on the bookshop's wooden floor. His head started to turn and Hermione quickly stepped back into the safety of the towering bookcases. Her heartbeat thudded in her ears so loudly that she was sure Lucius would have been able to hear it where he stood.</p><p>She couldn't face him. Her Gryffindor bravery had abandoned her as soon as she saw him standing so imposingly by the cashier desk. There was nothing for it. She would have to hide from him. Again.</p><p>She tried to calm her nerves and her thudding heart, shrinking further back into the depths of the bookshop and prayed to whichever deity who was listening that he wouldn't venture between the bookcases.</p><p>“Here we are, Mr Malfoy,” came the voice of the shop assistant. “Is there anything else I can do for you today?”</p><p>“That will be all. Have it charged to my account, will you?” </p><p>“Of course, sir. Good day to you.”</p><p>Hermione waited until she heard footsteps and the sound of the bell on the door before she could breathe easy again.</p><p>“It's alright, he has gone now.” Called the shop assistant. Hermione slowly made her way towards the cashier's desk, still clutching hold of the book to her chest.</p><p>“Are you okay Miss? It can't be nice to see one of his kind walking free.” The young man asked, clearly concerned for her well being. </p><p>“I'm fine, thank you.” She replied, placing the book on the counter.</p><p>“If I was the owner, I would ban people like him from the shop, but I'm just a weekend shop assistant.” He told her rather apologetically.</p><p>“It's fine really.” She insisted, all she wanted to do was pay for the book she didn't really want and go home. </p><p>“I would rather serve people like you, Miss. Those that fought on the good side. If you know what I mean.”</p><p>“How much do I owe you?” She asked, wanting desperately to get out of the book shop as quick as possible.</p><p>“Oh, er.. 1 galleon and 17 sickles. Do you need a bag?”</p><p>Hermione paid the money and hastily took the book, putting it in her own charmed bag and left the bookshop as quick as she could. </p><p>While she had been in the shop it had started to rain. Not wanting to be outside longer than necessary, Hermione quickly ran to the Leaky Cauldron to use the public floo to get home.<br/>
                                        ~oOo~</p><p>     It was inevitable really. Having been so close to the wizard earlier that day, of course, that would be an open invitation for her subconscious to replay the situation but change it completely.</p><p>She was in the familiar surroundings of Flourish and Blotts. Flipping through pages of a book when the sound of tapping reached her ears. Instead of reacting, she ignored it, even as it grew louder. It stopped abruptly and she knew that he was behind her but she carried on reading.</p><p>“Don't you think it's time you stopped hiding from me, Miss Granger?” His voice like silk in her ear.</p><p>“I'm not hiding, why would I do something like that?” She replied, turning a page in the book, her back still facing him.</p><p>“Because you fear me.” Hermione froze mid page turn as she heard him take another step closer. “You fear your bodies reaction to me and what you might do in response.” He was almost touching her now, she could feel the heat of him on her back, his heady masculine scent infiltrating her nostrils, making her head swim.</p><p>“I don't fear you.” Her voice was shaking as she spoke but it wasn't from fear.</p><p>“Prove it.” This was said directly into her right ear, causing a shiver to run down her body and heat to pool at her core.</p><p>Slowly she shut the book and replaced it back on the shelf. She was about to turn to face him when she was pushed against the bookshelf by his firm body. His hand firmly on her waist and her skin felt on fire where he touched her even through the layers of clothing she wore.</p><p>“I can smell your arousal. Your body is betraying you Miss Granger. You have no control and that scares you. Admit it.”</p><p>“This is a bookshop!” She hissed, “there are other people in here. They will see us!” </p><p>“That's not what you're scared of and you know it.” His voice, his scent, his closeness was becoming too much and then Hermione whimpered as he licked up the side of her face with the tip of his tongue. His hand on her waist had moved to the front of her cloak and slipped under the waistband of her skirt, inching towards the slick heat he would find between her legs.</p><p>“Please…” She whispered, not sure if she wanted him to stop or continue. He took it as a sign to continue and his hand slid across her heated core. She gasped at his touch, another wave of arousal surged to her womanhood.</p><p>“Tell me, Miss Granger.” He purred as one long digit stroked her aching sex. “Tell me that you haven't been thinking about me, doing this to you since Samhain.”</p><p>Of course, her subconscious knew she had been. It wanted to make her admit that she wanted this man desperately. She moaned and held on to his arm as his finger lazily stroked her sodden folds.</p><p>“That's it. You are so wet for me already. Your body knows what it wants. There is nothing to fear. Why fight it? Why hide from it?” His voice slithered into her ear causing her to groan loudly and then she remembered where they were and that any minute someone could catch them.</p><p>“We can't.. not here.” She rasped but Lucius ignored her completely as his questing finger slipped inside of her. “F-fuck!” She hissed, closing her eyes as he expertly explored her. The heat from his body and the hardness of him, magnified the lust that now flowed in Hermione's veins. All her senses were tuned into the wizard behind and inside her. </p><p>Another finger joined the first and she automatically clenched around them as if her life depended on it.</p><p>She was rushing towards the precipice. She could feel the tightening coil of pleasure and knew she couldn't fight it. The whole thing was so erotic. Being pleasured by Lucius Malfoy in Flourish and Blotts, only feet away from other people.</p><p>“Come for me, Hermione. Let me feel you. Don't fear your desire. Embrace it, own it, use it.” he whispered hotly in her ear while one hand palmed her breast through her blouse at the same time as his dexterous fingers stretched her tight channel and she was lost as pleasure sparked within her.</p><p>“Lucius!” She cried out which was followed by a thump. She had fallen out of bed yet again.</p><p>                                                 ~oOo~</p><p>Hermione was infuriated with herself. With him!</p><p>How dare he affect her in this way! Make her crave his touch, his kisses, for his voice to whisper naughty things in her ear. She had hardly slept the rest of the night after her erotic dream and was now on her 4th coffee of the morning to keep awake during the Department meeting. Thankfully it wasn't very long but Hermione had a hard time keeping her eyes open.</p><p>“Miss Granger, I'd like to speak with you after the meeting please.” Asked her boss.</p><p>This made her sit up straight in her chair. “Of course Mr Lyall!”</p><p>The older wizard smiled and the meeting was adjourned. Hermione gathered up her things and was last to leave the conference room.</p><p>“Let's chat in my office, shall we?” Mr Lyall gestured for her to take the lead.</p><p>“Take a seat Miss Granger, this won't take a moment of your time.” He said once they were in his large office. Hermione sat down on the chair opposite the desk.</p><p>“What can I do for you, Sir?” She asked once he was seated.</p><p>"Well, it's your Elfish welfare case against the Malfoy's.”</p><p>Hermione visibly stiffened at the mention of the purebloods.</p><p>“I was going through the reports and saw that you have still yet to sign them off. Is there any reason why it is taking so long?”</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth but no sound came out, she tried again.</p><p>“I had arranged for a final observation but I couldn't make the appointment. I have yet to finalise another time with Mr Malfoy.”</p><p>“Miss Granger, Hermione, would it be better if someone else took over their case? I know that during the war you had personal dealings with the family.” He watched as she unconsciously placed her hand over her forearm and bit her bottom lip. “I could easily pass your notes on to Delamere…” </p><p>She should acccept. That way she wouldn't have to step back in the Manor or deal with the wizard who was constantly in her thoughts as if he owned them. But it was her project. If it wasn't for her the House-elves of the wizarding community would still be nothing more than slaves. She had to see it through.</p><p>“No, it's.okay Mr Lyall. I will write to Mr Malfoy and arrange another appointment.” She said defiantly.</p><p>“If you're sure? I must say; you haven't been yourself lately. Is there anything bothering you at all?”</p><p>Oh, plenty Mr Lyall. Like how a certain ex Death Eater keeps showing up in my dreams and fantasies and giving me the best orgasams ever. </p><p>“My cat hasn't been doing so good lately. I worry for him.” She lied.</p><p>“Oh dear, poor thing!” Mr Lyall said sympathetically. </p><p>“He's getting old, it's one of those things. I'll be okay. Is there anything else you needed sir?” She asked, wanting to leave his office now and get on with some work.</p><p>“That will be all for now Miss Granger. I hope your cat will be okay, I understand how upsetting it can be when a pet is unwell.”</p><p>                                            ~oOo~</p><p>Hermione stared at the blank piece of parchment in front of her. At a loss for what to write.</p><p>She should keep it formal. Instruct the family that another appointment would have to be made in order to observe the house-elves and then the entire business could be put behind them.</p><p>The letter went unwritten. Pushed aside in favour of other, more menial tasks. Before Hermione knew it, it was time to go home. To her one bedroom flat, old cat and ready made meal for one.</p><p>That night her dreams were full of him yet again. Of heated kisses, sensual touches and erotic promises. Once more her body shuddered awake to the ghost of an orgasm leaving her feeling empty and alone.</p><p>This had to stop.</p><p>She couldn't survive on broken nights sleep like this. Never had anyone caused her sleepless nights in this manner, or consumed her thoughts in such a lustful way. </p><p>‘He's done something to me.’ She thought as she laid in bed listening to Crookshanks snoring. ‘He cursed me on Samhain night… that ‘contraceptive potion’ was probably spiked with something! That has to be it!’ </p><p>Spurred on by her clever thinking, Hermione decided to get up and get ready for the day ahead. </p><p>                                                 ~oOo~</p><p>“Good morning ‘Mione! You seem in a good mood.” Remarked Harry, once he caught up with her in the Ministry's Atrium.</p><p>“Morning Harry. I've had a breakthrough on a particular case that has been given me nothing but grief the past few weeks. I'm feeling pretty positive about it!” She smiled at her old friend.</p><p>“Well that is good. Listen, Hermione… I think Ron really wants to have another chance with you. He misses you. A lot actually.”</p><p>She stopped walking and took a deep breath. </p><p>“I can't Harry. Not yet. I need… I need to figure out my own head first before I can take on Ronald's.”</p><p>Harry nodded in understanding. “And that's fine. Really. Just know I'm here for you no matter what.”</p><p>“Thanks Harry. That means a lot.”</p><p>                                         ~oOo~</p><p>Once she was in the safety of her office Hermione reached for her quill and a blank roll of parchment and wrote a short and concise message to Lucius.</p><p> </p><p>‘Dear Mr Malfoy,</p><p>       I am writing to enquire if I could possible meet with you as soon as possible to discuss something of a delicate nature.</p><p>Yours faithfully</p><p>Miss H Granger.’</p><p>Satisfied with her letter, she took it to the owlery herself to see it got sent off.</p><p>A reply was received after lunch time. Hermione's heart thudded like a drum in her chest as she stared at the envelope on her desk. Her name was written in a elegant cursive.</p><p> </p><p>‘My Dear Miss Granger, </p><p>  I had wondered when I would receive word from you. As for your request, I can be found every night this week from 7pm at a certain night spot in Knockturn Alley for which you hold a V.I.P membership card for.</p><p>Perhaps this time, the use of Polyjuice won't be necessary.</p><p>I am intrigued to discover what is so delicate in nature that you wish to discuss as soon as possible. </p><p>I look forward to the pleasure of seeing you again soon.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Lucius Malfoy.’</p><p>Hermione stared at the letter in disbelief. He wanted her to visit him in his club. His co-owned club, which when she last visited, was holding a auction of muggle virgins. </p><p>But at least it wouldn't be in Malfoy Manor.</p><p>She reached into the bottom drawer of her desk and brought out the gold membership card for Hades. She had sworn to herself that she would never use it. However there was no way she was going to suffer another night of tangled bed sheets and disappointment.</p><p>‘I look forward to the pleasure of seeing you again soon.’ He had written. Not if Hermione had anything to say about it.</p>
