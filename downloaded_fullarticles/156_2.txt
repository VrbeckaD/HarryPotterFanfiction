    <p> </p><p>He could <em> curse </em> Theseus, for whining and moaning and finally just dragging him out of the case, to shove him into a suit. And for <em> what? </em> To pack themselves into a tiny dark little hole of a restaurant—in Tralee, of all places, where the pavement had only barely stopped smoking from the last skirmish between Britain and its stolen islands—along with what seemed half the population of well-to-do vacationing Brits, abusing Ireland’s coast and war-scarred people some little bit further, to eat tiny things off giant plates in the French style while Theseus waited to see if some wizard who had earned the Ministry’s suspicion would show up.</p><p>There were a <em> thousand </em> things he’d rather be doing—he could be making another round of poultices for the bowed tendon of his newest rescued unicorn, or rubbing down Cleo, the elderly sha-creature rescued from the terrible cramped courtyard of London's more passionate egyptology club, to help her shed the last of that terrible winter coat, the miserable result of an Egyptian creature overwintering in cold gloomy Great Britain, half-grown and half-shed half a dozen times no matter how many warming spells he’d cast on her habitat.</p><p>He could be strengthening the containment warding, to better resist the Niffler’s escape attempts, he could be expanding the subtropical section and tending to the wilty-looking trees in the Mediterranean area—</p><p>A thousand things, honestly.</p><p>Instead, he was here, twisting his body through thick-packed tables and sprawling guests, amid the clinking of two dozen silver implements and the head-aching sparkle of crystal in floating candlelight.</p><p>And he was doing it in a constricting suit— Theseus was not <em> nearly </em> as good with tailoring charms as he’d claimed— that left him aware that his limbs were entirely too awkward to be graceful. </p><p>He’d give a small fortune to be graceful for a few short minutes.</p><p>Falling was inevitable, he decided, as his knees hit the ground, his face already on fire with shame.</p><p>He’d tripped over someone’s stretched-out legs, and managed to drag someone else’s coat to the floor with him. He occupied himself now praying he hadn’t spilled anything too expensive onto that lovely woman’s very, um, expansive dress and fighting down the temptation to Apparate straight home.</p><p>He was going to murder Theseus, if he ever got back to their table. Murder him and order the most expensive thing he could find on the dessert menu. Something truly ridiculous. He wouldn't share, either. Let the wanker explain <em> that </em>expenditure to his tight-arse boss.</p><p>“Sorry, sorry, sorry,” he chanted, muffled in the over-loud chatter of people taking notice, trying to untangle himself amid the trappings of fine dining.</p><p>“Are you alright?” a man, the man whose coat was crushed under him, had jumped up; tightening the narrow space further—but chose to be helpful, reaching down to offer a hand.</p><p>“Yes, yes, sorry, I’m very sorry for the trouble—” he started, and stopped, looking up into a pair of warm brown eyes with concern lurking in their corners.</p><p>“I’m—I’m fine, thank you.”</p><p>“Let me help you,” he said, and Newt found himself gaining his feet despite his own natural tendency to flail, without any further destruction.</p><p>“Thank you,” he said, and found he was looking down now, a little bit, and that brown eyes darkened to nearly black in this low light, when the man smiled.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>He ducked, gathering the sumptuous coat up into his arms to save it from further abuse. He wasn't startled to find that the fabric was beautiful under his fingers — this was a very nice restaurant, after all. But the silky weight of the thing was richly sumptuous and warm with body heat.</p><p>How could woven fibers evoke the same sensation as stroking over the softness of a healthy, living creature?</p><p>“Your coat,” he said, coming back up with it. “Thank you—”</p><p>He froze, offering it back, because the smile had fled the man’s eyes, flattened them to something anxious, uncertain.</p><p>Oh—<em> Oh</em>.</p><p>Oh <em> my</em>.</p><p>“Thank you,” Newt repeated, careful, and offered out the coat.</p><p>The man twitched, like he’d received a bolt of electrical discharge instead of a soft garment. He took it back, then—</p><p>— it wasn't <em>quite</em> the snatch of a frightened parent, nor the furious swipe of a predator whose boundaries had been disrespected, but closely enough akin to both that Newt was reminded of a chimera mother he’d stumbled across in Macedonia.</p><p>It was startlingly fast, in any case, and then the man stilled once more, holding what must be his skin, and stood blinking at him.</p><p>“No,” he said, as does a man recovering from a terrible shock, slow and uncertain with a strange light in his eyes now, perhaps astonishment.</p><p>“No, thank <em> you</em>.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Newt got back to his table with no further mishaps, but wore a wondering expression of his own that narrowed Theseus’s eyes suspiciously.</p><p>“What’s this, pup? You look like you’ve found a unicorn in the bogs. I thought you were still grumpy at me, dragging you out to Kerry for a stake-out.”</p><p>“Oh, I am,” Newt agreed, cheerful. “But I suppose I can forgive you. Can you imagine, Selkies in Tralee? Anecdotal evidence had suggested that they’d all gone away, you know. Fled back to more historic ranges and gone into hiding, so the implications of a resurgence could be very exciting.”</p><p>“Finish your dinner, would you?” Theseus grumbled, and settled back into watching the room moodily over his coq au vin.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
