    <p align="justify">Harry woke up to the bright morning light streaming in through the windows of his room. He rubbed away the sleepiness in his eyes and stared at clock on his bedside table. <em>What time was it?</em> Harry rubbed his head and realised that the rest of the room was empty. He sat up and took in the surroundings. <em>Where had everyone gone?</em> Then, Harry's brain caught up to him and he realised that he was late for breakfast. He jumped out of bed and dashed across the room, pulling on his robes and tie. He didn't bother to brush his teeth or run a comb through his ruffled raven hair, which insisted upon falling into his eyes. He ran down the stairs and through the portrait, only stopping once he reached the door of the Great Hall.</p><p align="justify">Just as Harry was about to push open the large wooden doors, a tall blond-headed male pushed past him and hurried into the Great Hall. Harry quickly regained his balance and pushed his unruly hair out of his eyes. It was Draco Malfoy. Harry shot him a glare at him and straightened his robes as he made his way to the Gryffindor table.</p><p align="justify"><em><strike></strike>Why was Malfoy late anyway? Wasn’t he always early to everything? </em>As Harry looked back, he realised that these past few days, Malfoy had been late to almost all the classes that they shared. Harry sat down next to Ron and pondered over the new information that he had gathered. “Hey mate, what are you thinking so hard about?” asked Ron, jolting Harry out of his thoughts. “Yeah you seem rather out of it today,” commented Hermione, who was sitting across him.</p><p align="justify">Harry shook his head, waving away their questions and looked ahead. He soon realised that Snape was missing from the Great Hall as well. This struck Harry as odd as Snape was always ever-present at the table, staring down his nose with that signature look of his. “Harry, are you really okay? Did you hear what I just said?” asked Hermione, who at this point looked slightly pissed off. “I said,” repeated Hermione before Harry could answer, “that we should begin studying for all our tests that we have coming up.”</p><p align="justify">At this, Ron groaned and proceeded to gather support from the other Gryffindors who were listening in on the conversation, that any form of studying was a bad idea. Harry gave a half-hearted laugh as his mind wandered back to thoughts of Draco and Snape. When the great Hall suddenly silenced, Harry looked up to see Snape take his seat.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Harry’s curiosity was piqued. He was going to find out why Draco and Snape, the ever punctual Slytherins,  were now consistently late to everything. He considered asking Hermione and Ron but at the last moment, decided against it. Hermione and Ron would chide him and deem this ‘adventure’ pointless and as Hermione would put it, <em>a waste of time that could be used for studying</em>. He would do this by himself.</p>
