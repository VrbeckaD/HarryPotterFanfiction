    <p align="LEFT">It was hard for Percy to figure out what to do with himself after the Battle of Hogwarts, after Voldemort had been killed-it wasn't like he'd been on good terms with the rest of his family for years. Showing up in time for this wouldn't undo the years of lack of communication and bad feeling-</p><p align="LEFT">“It should've been <u>you</u> dead,” George rasped. “Not Fred-”</p><p align="LEFT">“George!” That was Ginny, her eyes red and swollen and flashing with something that wasn't entirely grief. Tired as they all were... it'd be so easy to permanently end ties here and now, and it wouldn't even require the rest of them dying. Percy realized George was grieving and probably in shock-but he shouldn't be able to get away with that type of shit either. Neither of them were children anymore-what was considered “cute” then was considered cruel now. Never mind it'd been cruel then too-because at least when you that young you were still learning how to be human.</p><p align="LEFT">But he still didn't feel comfortable standing up for himself, not when he <em>agreed</em> with George on this...</p><p align="LEFT">“Even if Percy had died here there's no guarantee that Fred-or you-would still have survived,” Ginny continued raggedly, breath coming in gasps. “I've lost one brother, I don't want to lost another, and Percy's admitted his mistakes. We need to admit we made mistakes too.”</p><p align="LEFT">“If he hadn't-”</p><p align="LEFT">“Driving Percy out isn't going to bring Fred back! You don't have to talk to him, but I'm not going to let my grief over Fred drive the rest of my family away.” With that Ginny looked at Percy and nodded at a point in the Great Hall, some meters away from the rest of the family and the awkward silence gripping them.</p><p align="LEFT">“Not right now,” Molly rasped, finally coming back from wherever she'd been and stopping the fight before it really got going-before McGonnagall or anyone else still in the Great Hall overheard them; right now they were being given space around Fred's corpse-and Percy knew it couldn't last.</p><p align="LEFT">As much as any of them might not want to move, they couldn't stay here for much longer. Others were beginning to move, beginning to contact others outside of Hogwarts. That's probably where Arthur had gone to, Percy reflected; they did have to make arrangements for Fred's funeral-he just... couldn't be left here.</p><p align="LEFT">None of them were willing to leave him here-the only way it'd happen is if they'd all died in the battle' Percy knew they'd gotten lucky. During the last Wizarding War his mother had lost more family than a child and his father hadn't lost anyone at all, as far as he knew. Maybe that'd been one of the reasons their marriage had stayed together, in spite of the strain the wars had put on it.</p><p align="LEFT">He took his mind away from memories that didn't help at the moment; it was better if he could focus and get through the here and now-as tempting as it might have been to... get lost in thought, to not remember <em>why</em> they were still around Fred's corpse, he couldn't do that. (<em>Fred would</em>, a traitorous thought went through his mind. <em>Fred would've been happy to leave you here, been happy to forget you...</em> He had no way of <b>knowing</b> if it was true, even if it'd felt that way over the last few years-and Percy would be among the first two admit he didn't know how much of that was on him misinterpreting their relationship, and how much was Fred being a little shit. Now with Fred's death there was no way to fix their relationship, see if there was any way it could be mended-if there was even any point to it.</p><p align="LEFT">“Percy? Perce, have you been listening?” It was Bill, and the combination of concern and annoyance woke Percy out of his thoughts.</p><p align="LEFT">“Not really,” he admitted. “It's just...” He found he couldn't look at Fred anymore; it was finally beginning to sink that Fred wasn't coming back. It'd been easier to believe when it was his previous employer-he hadn't had that many ties to Crouch at the time... and it wasn't something he could fix. He couldn't <em>undo any of this</em>, and the frustration was building. The inability to figure what to <em>do</em> with himself-there should be a manual or something, anything, to-to help those like him know how to handle situations like this.</p><p align="LEFT">Bill relented, seeming to realize that Percy was floundering as much as the rest of them, and had no idea of what the hell to do or say either. “Remembering Fred?”</p><p align="LEFT">“Y-yeah. When he was younger-”</p><p align="LEFT">George had gathered up his brother's body and wouldn't let anyone else help him; there was kind of... a wild look to his face that it unwise for anyone to try to take Fred away from him right now. Percy just hoped someone <b>would</b> be able to find the right words to help George let go, and he was aware enough it probably wouldn't be him.</p><p align="LEFT">Charlie or Bill, maybe. Or Fleur - she was close enough George wouldn't see her as a threat, yet still distant enough that she'd maybe still have enough emotional distance to find the right things to say...</p><p align="LEFT">He needed some space and The Burrow? Not it, he hadn't felt safe there in years. Since before he'd been old enough to hold down a job on his own and live in his own place, provided he could either afforded it or – more likely – if he'd been able to find someone willing to be his roommate; none of the wizards he'd roomed with after Hogwarts had been as close to him as Oliver had been-and there was an idea, both if could find Oliver and if he was still willing to put up with Percy... his own family wasn't. Might not be right now- George wasn't, and to be fair George wasn't entirely in his right mind-and an idea that it'd be better for everyone if he gave them some space but was still. Still involved in their lives if they'd let him-</p><p align="LEFT">“Of course you're coming back to The Burrow! That's where you and Fred were born, that's where Fred needs to go so he can be cleaned-”</p><p align="LEFT">“He loved our shop too, and wanted to be taken <em>there</em>-”</p><p align="LEFT">Percy moved in between them and intercepted them before either of them could do anything they regretted-like hit each other; he could tell Molly was struggling with it.</p><p align="LEFT">“Don't. <em>Don't</em>,” he said. “George doesn't need anyone hitting him right now; that's not going to make him let go off Fred any faster.” Percy could see the steam rising out of Molly, see the way the words were trying to work their way through, but Molly'd never been known for letting logic or facts stop her when she'd riled. Percy didn't dare look away from her-it'd only make things worse, make her angrier, but then... if he didn't back down she'd get angrier too. At least from what he remembered; the only way to “win” was not to <em>be</em> there when get angry. Be what she wanted; it was easier that way since she wouldn't be riled up-and she did tend to say things she later regretted. But it wasn't anything she'd be able to take back either, and he guessed-hoped-it was going through her mind now.</p><p align="LEFT">Because if she did or said the wrong thing? She'd be losing George too. And he might not be willing to come back-Percy could tell that much-so could the rest of his family.... He racked his brain for something to say, something to do, now that he'd decided to act...</p><p align="LEFT">“George, lemme help you with Fred there, it looks like he's about to slip...” Charlie said, moving fast enough that George couldn't fight him on this. “I'm sorry George, Mum, St. Mungo's it is for the moment=that should be safe.” He looked around at the Great Hall, sagging a little. “There's not a lot that I can do here, but I can keep an eye on George. Perce... don't let Mum bully you into doing something you're not ready for or comfortable with; don't let her run you over.”</p><p align="LEFT">“Charlie!” Molly's voice seemed to be working again. “We've always taken care of our dead at-”</p><p align="LEFT">Arthur put an arm around Molly's shoulders and said, “Later, Molly, later. We'll be able to lay him to rest soon, let's get you looked over before you fall over. Fred wouldn't have wanted you to hurt.”</p><p align="LEFT">Molly let herself be led away; Percy wasn't sure if she was aware she was weeping. Arthur was too-he kept wiping his eyes with a handkerchief-but Percy wouldn't want to push his luck with her.</p><p align="LEFT">“Are you coming back to The Burrow?” Ginny asked him-the way she was holding herself told him the day was definitely catching up to her. As well as to everyone else; the bruises under their eyes, the way they were trying to remain upright and not slump over in exhaustion and delayed reaction...</p><p align="LEFT">He shook his head. “Maybe tomorrow? If you think it'll be okay-I still have to pa=”</p><p align="LEFT">“That's okay, come over when you're ready. I'm not sure how happy Mum will be see any of us, just-be careful?” Ginny hugged him before darting after the rest of their siblings.</p>
