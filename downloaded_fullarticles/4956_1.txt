    <p>James should’ve known even before it happened that getting drunk with Sirius was a mistake. Firewhiskey made his tongue loose and his hands wandering, and he <em> definitely </em> should have known better than to drink around Sirius because his internal monologue was likely to become external, which led to telling Sirius all the ways he was amazing and that was a mere half-step from telling him that James was in love with him.</p>
<p>If all that wasn’t enough, then he should’ve known better because <em> Sirius </em> got handsy when pissed, and if there was one thing to make James say what he shouldn’t, it was Sirius looking at him with warm grey eyes and a smile like nothing could go wrong when they touch. (Technically the one thing that could make James say or do what he shouldn’t, was simply Sirius.)</p>
<p>Despite knowing all of that, knowing that he <em> should </em> have known better, he was still there, with Sirius, bottles of firewhiskey at their feet even though they would only need the one, all alone in their favourite abandoned classroom with the door locked and the large armchair they’d transfigured three years ago holding both of them as they giggled and leaned on each other with flushed faces.</p>
<p>Sirius was slouched in the chair, so much that he was nearly falling off. James was half on top of him, which was probably the only thing keeping him in place. Sirius’s arm was curled low around James’s back to help his balance.</p>
<p>“You’re gonna get a crick in your neck if you don’t move, Pads,” James slurred, grinning down at him. His hand was running through Sirius’s hair, but he didn’t remember starting that.</p>
<p>“You could always massage me,” he suggested, smirking up through his eyelashes.</p>
<p>James snorted, as if his hand wasn’t automatically going down to Sirius’s neck to rub at the warm skin. “As if.”</p>
<p>Sirius would have given him a pointed look for his conflicting actions if he hadn’t closed his eyes, but settled for saying, “‘As if’ he says, doing what I asked.”</p>
<p>James pinched his neck, not enough to hurt, but Sirius gave him a betrayed look with his patented Puppy Eyes anyways and James felt guilty. “I hate you.”</p>
<p>He leaned into James’s arm for a minute. Then, with some uncomfortable squirming Sirius managed to be sitting up again, still half under James, not that he minded. “No you don’t. In fact, I think you love me.”</p>
<p>James rolled his eyes. “Well who doesn’t? Honestly Si, the shite you say these days.” Not quite what he should have said, or meant to say, but him rubbing their noses together afterwards like they were bloody woodland creatures was worse.</p>
<p>Sirius chuckled, deep and breathy. James could feel it against his face, they were so close. “Yeah, well you’re not helping much, mate.” Sirius surged up, the last few centimeters between them gone in an instant as he pressed their lips together.</p>
<p>James didn’t think about it, his mind muddled, and kissed Sirius back.</p>
<p>“James,” Sirius whispered reverently.</p>
<p>He fisted a hand in the back of Sirius’s shirt and pulled him closer, reveling in the feel of Sirius’s body arched against him.</p>
<p>Sirius opened his mouth slightly, and James dove his tongue in, wanting-- <em> needing</em>-- to memorise the way he tasted, the way he would respond to James. He heard a moan, but couldn’t tell if it was from Sirius or himself because he could feel it down to his toes. Merlin Sirius was warm, tasting sweet from the chocolate frogs he’d devoured earlier, but it was hidden under the bitter tang of firewhiskey that painted the inside of his mouth.</p>
<p>James’s body responded to the information before his mind could figure out why. He jerked back, one hand pushing and the other pulling Sirius away from him. James stumbled off the chair onto his feet, falling on his arse, both from the liquor and how quickly he’d tried to leave his awkward position. “What the fuck Sirius?” he said, eyes wide and hand hovering near his mouth. <em> Why would you kiss me when you’re drunk? Why can’t you do that when you’re sober? </em> “Really, what the <em> fuck</em>?”</p>
<p>Sirius hadn’t moved, was just staring at him with his mouth parted like he couldn’t understand what was going on.</p>
<p>James shook his head, looking away, standing, and wiping at his mouth with a hand he hoped wasn’t shaking visibly enough that Sirius could see it. He had to get out of here. It took a couple tries for him to get out the door-- first because it was locked and then because he buggered up the spell to open it and if that wasn’t a flashing sign of how shaken up he was, nothing would be-- but once he was out, he high-tailed it to the common room.</p>
<p>The Fat Lady let him with a sympathetic look, not even asking for the password, and it wasn’t until she said, “Don’t cry too much dear, they aren’t worth it,” as he passed that James even realised he was crying.</p>
<p>There were only a couple people in the Common Room, but a hand raised as if to muss his hair prevented them from seeing anything if they happened to look his way.</p>
<p>He wasn’t so lucky in their dormitory. Remus nodded at him in greeting, but Peter asked, “Where’s Sirius?” looking at the closed door like he would suddenly appear behind James if he looked long enough.</p>
<p>“Are you crying?” Remus said, a definite vein of disbelief in his voice. He got to his feet and started walking towards James. “Are you hurt?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m-” James wiped at his face uselessly and shuffled away from Remus. “I’m fine,” he mumbled.</p>
<p>“You clearly aren’t,” Remus said, but he didn’t come any closer. “Did something happen with Sirius?”</p>
<p>James must have changed his expression because then Peter asked, “Is he hurt? Do we need to go to the Hospital Wing?”</p>
<p>James shook his head vehemently. “He’s fine, nothing’s wrong.” A traitorous sob tore through him, and he stumbled to his bed.</p>
<p>“O...kay,” Remus said slowly, going back to sit next to Peter. They must have realised that even though he was clearly lying, if there was something the matter with Sirius, he would never hide that from them.</p>
<p>“Well, goodnight, I guess,” Peter added. “Hope you sleep well.” If James had been in a better mind, he would’ve thought that Pete was far too sweet to him.</p>
<p>He managed to quickly change into his pyjamas, even with fumbling hands and blurry vision. He practically fell onto his bed and shoved the curtains closed around him, casting quick sticking and silencing spells. James finally let himself go, sobs wracking his body as he struggled to breathe. <em> Stupid, stupid, stupid</em>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Horrified.</p>
<p>That’s how James had looked. Sirius kissed him, and James was horrified.</p>
<p>Sirius felt stuck to the chair, frozen in place in a way that had nothing to do with a spell but was undoubtedly just as effective. He watched as James fought with the door, too desperate to leave to remember that they had locked it. James slammed the door behind him, but that was probably an accident. <em> Probably</em>, he repeated to himself.</p>
<p>He finally moved, slumping in on himself, head in his hands. His mind wasn’t clear enough, too muddled by firewhiskey to let him think about it, to try and create a solution that meant something other than James being horrified that Sirius had kissed him.</p>
<p>It had to have been that moan. He hadn’t meant to, but he was taken off guard first by the firewhiskey, then the easy way James said he loved him, then how he nuzzled Sirius as if being in his presence was a gift, and mostly by the way James had <em> kissed him back</em>. James had had his tongue in Sirius’s mouth, pressing against him and holding him like he wanted to devour him, and Sirius hadn’t been able to help it.</p>
<p>Maybe James had forgotten who he was with until then. His eyes were closed, he was drunk, there were lips, and a voice saying his name like they worshipped him. It could’ve been excused until Sirius had gone and ruined it by being too loud. If he’d just kept his bloody feelings to himself, they would be fine right now. They might’ve kissed a bit more but been able to laugh it off in a few minutes, or Sirius could have not been a dumb fuck and abstained from kissing him in the first place. He should have known better, should have known <em> so much better </em> than to think he could kiss James without consequences.</p>
<p>Sirius wanted to break down, cry and scream to match the wailing in his head, but his body was unresponsive. “You’re such an idiot,” he whispered to himself.</p>
<p>He doesn’t know how long he stayed in that room, alone in the too large armchair with full bottles of firewhiskey at his feet, except for the mostly empty one that he was willing to blame for all his troubles at the moment. Eventually, he made his way to the Tower, studiously ignoring the worried looks Remus and Peter gave him when he got to their room.</p>
<p>It wasn’t any of their business, and maybe-- just maybe-- if he didn’t say anything, he and James would be back to normal tomorrow. James’s expression as he pushed Sirius off flashed through his mind, but he willfully shoved the image away. He could live in denial for a bit longer.</p>
