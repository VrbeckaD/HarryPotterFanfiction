  <b>The Overcoming of Fears and Jumping Off Ferris Wheels</b>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>Part I</b>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span> “I used to think the Dauntless were fearless.  That is how they seemed, anyway.  But maybe what I saw as fearless was actually fear under control.” – Tris, Divergent, Chapter Eighteen</span>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<hr/>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="left">Facing a boggart five years ago was completely different. I had an armful of school books and an entire library at my disposal. Before Professor Lupin had even first mentioned the creature, I already knew about its existence, exactly what it would do, and its counter-spell. Failing all of my Hogwarts subjects had been my biggest fear during my first years in this world.</p>
<p>
  <span>Quickly, that fear evolved into something more sinister, as did everyone else’s in the Wizarding world.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Even with the fall of Voldemort or as everyone still refers to him: He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, people still fear for their lives.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Everyone has their own way of coping: becoming dependent on unauthorized potions, having weekly anxiety attacks or even becoming adrenaline junkies.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As for me, I don’t simply cope with everything that went on during the Second War. I just happen to have nightmares every time I close my eyes. I see flashes of green coming from the ends of wands and bodies falling to the ground and floating dark marks. My nightmares are so vivid that when I wake up from them, I get this intense feeling that takes over my entire body. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It reminds me of that exact moment at the Battle of Hogwarts when I had thought that Harry had been dead. Our one hope, our one chance of freedom, my best friend in the entire world: dead. That feeling instantly crashes over me and it takes over an hour to calm myself down before normal function is possible in the early hours of the morning.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But now, instead of knowing that one silly school-girl fear has a hold of me, I have to deal with owning six. I have six fears that I need to get rid of in order to move on with my life. I want this war to stop haunting me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Ministry of Magic knew that something had to be done to help people who needed a way to cope and offer a permanent solution. If not, almost everyone that took direct action towards the fall of Voldemort would be driven to the brink of insanity.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It took barely over a year—but Misery be damned—they claim to have found a method that will probably help, however crude it may be. The only reason I am here is because I truly trust Kingsley Shacklebolt and he backs this completely, even taking the time to have approached me personally to talk about this project.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Fear Landscape; that’s what he called it and what everyone else around here calls it. I want to take that </span>
  <em>
    <span>stupid </span>
  </em>
  <span>title, run up the thirty-some flights of stairs in this compound, and send it flying over the edge of the roof. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This damn bloody contraption is going to be the death of me because every time they inject me with this burning blue liquid, I feel worse than when I close my eyes and accidentally drift off into my own mental hell. Instead of having to deal with real memories that I know for a fact happened, I have to deal with future possibilities.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>What happened is this: about three-hundred witches and wizards were divided into five groups and each group was given an entire building that we were admitted to. From there, we were all further divided into groups of ten. The group that I am in is for the toughest cases, those of us with the problems that simple magic or treatment can’t get rid of. After the first week, we gathered in a special room close to the top floor of the building and they introduced this fear landscape. One person is put into the centre of the circular room, an invisible barrier set around them, injected with the liquid, and suddenly that person doesn’t see the room and the rest of the people in it. Instead, they see the inner workings of their mind and their personal fears brought on by the injection. In order to be able to free yourself from the landscape, you must go through all your fears, a minute each, or until you pass out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Everyone has a different number. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I have six: Bellatrix Lestrange, my parents dying at the hands of death eaters, the disappearance of magic, losing Harry and Ron and Ginny and Neville and everyone I know, knives, and heights.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The lowest number of fears so far has been four. I don’t know who that achievement belongs to, but I do know it isn’t anyone in my group.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>At first I thought this whole ordeal was silly and juvenile, to force grown women and men through a series of strange obstacles. So far we have only been through the fear landscape and I know we are about to start a new phase. However, if I may be honest here for a moment, I think it is actually helping most of us. Seeing our fears being played out and recognizing them is at least a huge step forward. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>My biggest problem is that none of this is helping </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I hope it is safe to assume that in order to be released from this program we must be able to conquer and eliminate all of our fears. However, I have not been able to get a straight answer from anyone and it is driving me mad.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Having no answers to anything isn’t helping either.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After the blue liquid released me from my fear landscape yesterday, that huge feeling of dread washed over me and I darted out of the room and ended up by the lifts, escaping into the loo. Before the door swung closed behind me, I saw the familiar face of Draco Malfoy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When I finished my fear landscape today and my thoughts cleared, I realized that Draco wasn’t one of my fears. I’m not quite sure what had possessed those rampant thoughts through my mind, but they were there—running around, connecting two things in my mind that shouldn’t be connected.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thank Merlin for the disconnection, though, because I am now currently standing in a room with my group and Malfoy is at the front of it with another ex-Slytherin. It takes me less than two minutes to realize they are our new instructors.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>We are not in the room that we have been in for the past two weeks with the vials of blue injectable liquid. This room is not circular, but rectangular in shape and with many things occupying it along the back wall that I recognize from a past life. Before I can organize any more thoughts, Malfoy speaks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Today, you will all learn how to use Muggle forms of weaponry.” He reaches behind him and picks up a handgun. “This one is a called a gun and it can kill by shooting out portions of metal.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I notice everyone else in the room looking at the object in awe, but I am just recoiling within myself as I remember hearing news reports about the terrifying damage that those guns could cause. The sound of metal clinging together hits my ears as he is spinning two short bullets in his other hand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His lips curl up in this weird smile—not at all reminiscent of those self-righteous smirks from back at Hogwarts—and Malfoy sets the gun and bullets back down on the long table behind him and he then reaches for something else.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You should all be familiar with knives, but you will learn the purpose of it as a gruesome killing weapon.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The dim light that comes from up high catches on the shiny blade and I suddenly feel as though someone has gripped tightly on my heart. My breathing becomes shallow and I can vaguely sense my vision becoming blurred. My hand finds its way to my throat and I can feel the longer scar that is still there, underneath the sensitive skin of my fingertips.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Granger, is there a problem?” he asks, cocking his eyebrows at me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If I am ever going to make it out of this compound fearless, now is definitely the time to start. My breathing evens out and I can feel my heart thumping in my chest again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What is the point of all this?” I ask, not realising that the question had already formed in my mind.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Blaise, care to explain?” he has turned to the dark-skinned man at his side. Once the name hits my ears, I instantly recall him from Hogwarts. He steps forward and furrows his brows in contemplation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“All of you picture this scenario: you are in the path of one of the rogue Death Eaters and he happens to disarm you, breaking your wand in the process. You have just become defenceless and at the mercy of this maniac.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I can feel George shudder beside me and whisper, “</span>
  <em>
    <span>damn</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” the only word I have heard him speak since we arrived.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you simply going to give in and let him capture you, or are you going to fight back in a way he or she won’t be able to?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fight back,” I hear myself say, not having felt my lips move.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Exactly,” Malfoy speaks again. His grey eyes are looking right at me and shivers run down my spine. “If you have a single chance of surviving, you are instinctively going to fight back.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“With a knife?” I instantly say. Slowly, it begins to feel as though we are the only two in this circular room.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“With what you have available.” Zabini shrugs his shoulders, feigning stupidity.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It could be a gun.” Malfoy grabs the handgun from behind him again, puts a fully loaded magazine into it, loads a bullet into the chamber by cocking the slide, turns toward a board at the opposite end of the room, and fires. Thankfully, I had covered my ears before he pulled the trigger, or else the ringing vibrating in my eardrums would be much worse.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>From pure curiosity, I know all the parts and mechanics of a gun, but I have never held one in my hand. Instinctively, my curiosity grows even more.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Or it could be a knife.” Malfoy switches from the gun to the knife and once again turns toward the same target. He holds the tip of the blade between his finger and his thumb, balances it somehow, and with a quick flick of his wrist he throws it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I look over to the target and noticed how it has lodged quite firmly into the middle of the board, close to the bullet; I admit it, he has good aim.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>How he has become so aware and so </span>
  <em>
    <span>brilliant</span>
  </em>
  <span> at Muggle fighting tactics, I am not quite sure, but I make a mental note of it and another mental note to ask about it when the perfect opportunity arises.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Or you could simply use your hands,” he mentions, quickly turning to attempt throwing a punch straight at Zabini’s jaw. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>However, the dark skinned man was able to stop his impending misfortune by holding Malfoy’s fist in the palm of his hand. In the same instant, he threw his own punch with the other hand towards Malfoy’s stomach, only for it to be blocked as well.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The blond did a fancy twist, crouching down, and with his swinging leg, managed to knock Zabini right down on his arse.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If you ever happen to be lucky enough,” Zabini said, making to stand up on his own without an offer of help from Malfoy, rubbing his sore bum from landing on the concrete, “your Wizarding opponent won’t have a single clue how to fight back.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I begin to wonder how well some of us would do at this, especially George. Most days I can tell he is on the verge of giving up, succumbing to his own nightmares, knowing that it is the only place he gets to see Fred’s face. I am not sure if he has any fight left in him and I highly doubt he’ll even want to block anything moving towards him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Everyone come and grab three knives from the table,” Malfoy says, moving out of the way and we all start slowly trudging there. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I hesitate before grabbing even the first one and I notice George has already grabbed his group of the sharp instruments, but still standing next to me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Without a single word, he grabs one by the blade with one hand and with the other he opens up my fist, putting the hilt of it straight into my palm. He closes my fingers tight around it and looks me square in the eyes as though he’s saying ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>it’ll be fine, face your fears</span>
  </em>
  <span>,’ and all of a sudden I feel different. For a moment I feel like I can do this.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Malfoy and Zabini are demonstrating how to throw the knives effectively, how to judge where to hold them depending on their weight, and how to release it. I’m listening and watching, but it’s all a buzz and blur because all I can focus on is the heavy weight of them in my hands.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They conjure up small stands beside each of us as we each line up in a direct line of a target. I set my knives down on the table and for a while I just stare at my target. I imagine one of the knives in my hand and practise the motion of throwing it at the board.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Remember what a </span>
  <em>
    <span>knife</span>
  </em>
  <span> is?” Anthony Goldstein says from my left, laughing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I choose to ignore him, not even acknowledging his comment. This time I pick up one of the knives, also ignoring the tightening that grows in my chest, and practise the throwing motions again, but without releasing it from my tight grip. Malfoy is pacing somewhere behind me and I can hear Zabini instruct someone, but I block them out, too.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Trying my hardest to keep the cackling laugh of Bellatrix Lestrange out of my mind, I take a deep breath and try to ignore her as well. But all I can do as I am staring at the target across the room from me is to imagine that crazy bitch’s face there, her head thrown back in insanity, her hair frenzied, and her mouth opened wide. An intense urge to kill off that stupid bitch rises in me, a volcano close to exploding, and in an instant my hand rises up close to my ear and my first knife is released from my hand. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A gasp escaped my lips and I watch the knife embed itself into the target. Sure, it isn’t right in the middle as Malfoy’s had been, but I am the first one to hit the target.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I am aware of everything around me again and next to me, Anthony throws his second knife and misses again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Remember what a </span>
  <em>
    <span>target</span>
  </em>
  <span> is, Goldstein?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>On the other side of me, George snorts and I see a shadow of a smile there.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For the rest of the week, we continue practising with the knives and on the last day, I am able to throw at least six of them in a row and have all of them hit the target.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This week, we have moved onto the hand-to-hand combat. George seems to be wary about this part of our program and I wonder if this will be his weak point.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He becomes my partner because I know I can take it easy on him while still learning what it is that I need to in order to survive this insane place. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Malfoy and Zabini are showing us the basics; the tactics on how to perform them and strategies on how to defend from them. I practise a low blow on George and he weakly defends against it, a bland gaze in his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I feel for him, really I do, but if he ever wants to live as close to a normal existence as possible, get past everything that we went through in the war, even overcome the death of half his life, he needs to find his courage somewhere.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Bam</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I punch him harder than I have been, in the stomach. Anger rushes through me as I realise how unfair Fred’s death was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Pow</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Another one of my punches hits him right in the sternum; anger that this good friend of mine has to live without his soul mate.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Thump. Slam. Pop.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I pound my fists against his chest, not hurting him, but releasing my pain. I feel wetness on my cheeks as he wraps his arms around me, shushing me. It feels so good to finally be comforted, that I let him continue calming me down. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When I open my eyes, I see Malfoy looking at me, grey eyes observing, but not judging.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That’s when I notice how </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucked</span>
  </em>
  <span> up I am, how I should be the one comforting George, not the other way around. I realise how much I am failing and how my affinity to keep doing so will keep me here forever.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>My free show that consisted of my mental breakdown during our first training session seemed to have left an impression on everyone. Either that or I have been noticing all of their glances in my direction a bit more than usual. A few days have gone by of me profusely apologising to George and hand-to-hand combat practises and still more stares.</p>
<p>
  <span>I decide that it is about time for some fresh air. After being locked up in this tall building for close to three weeks, I notice that my knees need a bit of a stretch and my mind needs something more to look than the Ministry approved decorations.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>From having overheard conversations, I know that we have been stationed in the ruins of an abandoned Muggle city. I also know that we are advised from wandering freely outside, but we are not being kept on leashes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I wait until after dinner is over when everyone is walking back to our shared rooms to walk away towards the exit of the building. The glass doors slam shut behind me and I don’t even bother looked back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The farther out I walk, the more destruction I notice. Paved roads have large cracks and holes in them, bricks are missing from building walls, street vendor carts are left along the side, and shop signs have fallen. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>My feet carry me even further until I reach a wide bridge that runs over a rapidly moving river. The road curves off to the right, but I manage to keep walking straight in a vast meadow, grass reaching up past the middle of my shins. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Suddenly, that feeling I normally get upon awaking from my nightmares returns and I feel as though I have slipped through a huge hole in the ground. I feel as though Bellatrix is going to run at me from behind, with a sharpened knife in her hand and that crazed look in her face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>My hands become magnetic to my throat and the rough edges of my scar hit the palm of my hand. That’s when I remember: Molly killed Bellatrix.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That evil bitch can’t touch me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I regret coming here alone, wondering if I should have brought George or even Parvati along with me. They both have lost other halves as well and would have appreciated an escape. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>My feet are beginning to turn me around to head back to my building, but then out of the corner of my eye, I spot something that reminds me of my past.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thoughts of innocent childhood days in London with my parents flood my mind. This isn’t nearly as colossal as the London Eye, but it certainly used to captivate Muggles at some point in the past. I had never been on a Ferris wheel, always scared that I would fall down from the very top. Somehow, this one seems to call out to me and I walk towards it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Ferris wheel towers over an ancient galloping horse roundabout. Some horses are completely missing leaving behind only empty spots and other horses have their tails ripped apart as though someone savagely took a broken wand to it. I come up to one of the golden-brown horses, this one with mostly all white details, and trail my hand along the attached saddle, up to the tip of its nose.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fancy a ride?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I whip around, my heart has stopped beating and a flash of Bellatrix zooms past in my mind.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Instead, my eyes land upon the face of Draco Malfoy, but my heart refuses to beat again. I watch as he steps up onto the platform and follows my previous actions, trailing his hand along an identical horse, but with gold details, directly behind mine. He’s probably laughing maniacally in his head, pointing out that if indeed had been Bellatrix or a rogue Death Eater, I would have been dead. We’re not allowed to have our wands while being admitted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Beautiful, aren’t they?” he asks, still not looking up at me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I continue to stare at him in awe, wondering how he has come to be this way instead of the boy I thought I had known before the war. Is he laughing or crying in that head of his?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What are you doing here?” The words come out of my mouth quickly, but not harshly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Same thing you are,” he replies, shrugging his shoulders, </span>
  <em>
    <span>still</span>
  </em>
  <span> not looking at me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A part of me wonders if he’s being honest or just pretending he understands me, because how can anybody else feel this horrible sensation of falling every time they walk on solid ground?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He steps off the carousel, his hand releasing the white horse, and continues on straight to the Ferris wheel. Yet again, I don’t know what possesses me, but I follow him, curious to know if he is leading me straight into my own hell or just a vision of it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Before I know it, I am standing so close to the wheel and its supports that I could extend my arm out and touch it. I realise that there is a rusted ladder visible there and Malfoy has already begun to climb it, one rung at a time. The muscles in my throat are clenching, closing tighter and tighter, until I can feel my lungs struggling with air.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I have already had to deal with my fear of knives a few days and I’m not sure I am ready to handle dealing with heights. Despite having been a Gryffindor for seven years and helping Harry take down Voldemort, I can’t seem to face most of my own monsters.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>At least not with a push.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The fact that Malfoy is already high above me helps me to realise that if he isn’t falling over with the wheel, then I definitely won’t.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>My left hand closes around the first rung and I can feel how rough it against the palm of my hand and how flimsy it feels. I shove that thought to the side and grab the next rung, pushing up off the ground with my foot.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I exhale deeply, and then inhale. A few more strong breathes in and out and I finally reach where Malfoy has stopped and sat upon a platform. Turning my body as carefully as I can, I move to sit next to him, finally aware that he has one of the guns attached to his hip.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There is no need to ask him why he’s carrying it around; I remember hearing the news of his mother’s death at the hands of Rodolphus Lestrange a few weeks after the war ended. I put that together with the fact that he is the one teaching us about other fighting tactics and it all makes sense. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It’s been only a few weeks that he has been helping us out, but somehow he always seems to distract me and his presence is always made aware of in my senses. I can either feel the heat of his body radiating towards my direction or I can smell his distinct scent—something musky and heavy and calming—or I see his eyes on me. I can’t decide if this is a good thing or something to worry about.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He takes an empty bullet shell from his pocket and throws it down to the ground, watching as it falls, hitting the ground without a sound.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I still have my demons, Granger.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Not wanting to impose on the personal details of his life, I’m not quite sure what to say.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, I think I’ll never get rid of mine.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t think that’s the point of all this,” he says, looking back down at the ground underneath us that seems miles away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And I think I understand. </span>
</p>
