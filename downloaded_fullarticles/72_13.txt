    <p>
  <span>December, 1995</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Located alongside the first-floor corridor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, tucked to the right of a staircase, was Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall's office. Disregarding Professor Snape, McGonagall was perhaps the strictest, most no nonsense professor in the entire school, but she always kept the fireplace warm and welcoming and always had a full tin of biscuits on her desk. However, while she was usually sprightly for her age, she looked older and more haggard at the moment as she bent over a stack of parchment, and her square spectacles sat crooked on her nose. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I knocked on the open door to be greeted with a distracted, “I’ll be with you in a moment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s okay,” I responded cheerfully. “I can wait.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her bright green gaze shot up from the parchment and fixed on my position in the doorway. She immediately straightened her spectacles. “Lilianna Flores!” she exclaimed and climbed to her feet. “You are on the wrong island.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I crossed the room and set down the parcel I was holding in order to take her hands in affectionate greeting. “I’m on the wrong ocean,” I laughed. “But I was given some time off, so I thought I would visit my family. It is good to see you, Professor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled, which was an expression that had rarely been shown to me when I was a student, and said, “I’m not your professor anymore, Lily. Minerva will suffice.” She gestured for me to pull up a chair as she sat back down, and she gave me an intelligent look in the process. “I think I would know if you have family here though. A sibling of yours with the Weasley twins alone would be enough to wreck the school, never mind the other members of my house.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gryffindor’s been giving you trouble this year?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gryffindor has been giving me trouble since you left. Your seven years caused chaos, but at least it was split evenly amongst the houses. That is no longer the case.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I laughed again. I hadn’t seen Fred and George Weasley since they were second-years, and even then they had been leaving destruction in their wake. Their skills had to have increased exponentially since I had been gone, and I had a hard time comprehending how much trouble they were getting into now that they were in their seventh year.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Weasleys are actually the reason I’m here,” I said. “I ran into Molly in London, and she asked me to deliver a care package for her kids.” I picked up the parcel and set it on her desk for her to see. “Should I leave it here with you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>McGonagall raised an eyebrow, and she studied me carefully before asking, “She couldn’t have sent it by owl?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled revealingly. “Some owls can be rather unreliable, you know? And besides, I don’t need much more than a terrible excuse to visit old friends and teachers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her lips twitched, and I couldn’t tell if it had been a hint of a smile or something else. “Old?” she echoed. “I see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know what I mean,” I said, waving a hand dismissively. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed,” she said. “Well, I can certainly take care of it, but if that’s your reason for dropping in, why not give it to them yourself? I’m sure they would love to see you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, well…” I hesitated, grasping for words, “I would love to see them too, but it sounds like they have enough going on right now. I don’t need to complicate things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed,” she said again, neither her tone nor her expression revealing anything. I doubted that my answer had been necessary; she already knew my real reasoning. She had simply been doing me a favor by pointing out the hole in my story. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s interesting though,” I said in an attempt to change the subject, “that Gryffindor has all the troublemakers. The houses seem different.” I had walked the corridors a bit before coming to the office, and what I had seen surprised me. In my school years, students of every house had mixed together happily, but now they seemed divided. They walked the halls in segregated packs, especially the Slytherins, who everyone else seemed to be giving a wide berth. I had never seen anything like it, and I didn’t know what to think. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Things are different,” she agreed, “and there is disagreement about why that is the case.” There was an edge to her words, and I took that as a sign that I had chosen a bad time to bring up the topic. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Surely it’s not all bad?” I asked, changing direction. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She relaxed. “No, certainly not,” she said. Her eyes sparkled, and I suddenly got the sense that I wasn’t going to like what was coming next. “Forgive me for saying this, but I think my house has benefitted.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yes.” She ticked off her fingers. “We took back the House Cup, took back the Quidditch Cup, and, if I may boast, one of my Gryffindors, a fifth-year named Hermione Granger is the top of every class. She is far above all the Ravenclaws, and I daresay she would have outmatched Rowan Khanna.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s rubbish!” I exclaimed. “You’re exaggerating.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can take you to the trophy display myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll hand you the trophies, but </span>
  <em>
    <span>no one </span>
  </em>
  <span>would have beat Rowan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can compromise there, but don’t dismiss the idea.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t underestimate Gryffindors, but I’ll believe it when I see it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughed once. “You better believe it then.” She paused thoughtfully and then asked, “Have you spoken with Filius yet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I shook my head. “Not yet. I was planning on saying hello to him next.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She raised her eyebrows. “So you came to me before your Head of House? I should be honored.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, in all honesty,” I said carefully, “your position is more conveniently located, Deputy Headmistress.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” she said, although the surprise in her voice did not match the shrewd look on her face. She clearly knew that I wasn’t talking about Flitwick’s office being on the seventh floor, and when she spoke again, the edge had returned. “Did I not just ask you to call me Minerva? These are stressful times. I would prefer it if I knew more people were on my side.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can count on it...Minerva.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded in satisfaction. “That’s good to hear. Now, tell me how you’ve been. Working with Australian Magical Customs must bring a fair amount of excitement. You’re in charge of overseeing the import and export of magical creatures, correct?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>We were both aware that this was a horribly obvious change of subject, but it still had the intended effect. I was being told to follow her lead, and to do so carefully. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Basically,” I said happily, as if I didn’t notice. “I travel with the creatures and make sure they get to where they need to go. I love it, but it does get tiring. I’ve been thinking about taking a position closer to home. Apparently I’m not the only one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve met with Bill Weasley,” she stated more than asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have, but I heard it from Charlie first.” My most recent job had involved escorting a dragon to Charlie in Romania, and once there, he had given me several shocking bits of information, including the confirmation of rumors I had desperately hoped wouldn’t be true. “I just couldn’t believe that our most adventurous Curse-Breaker would take a desk job with Gringotts,” I continued humorously. “I had to make a stop in London to see it for myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is rather shocking,” she said. “He has never been one to sit still. I wish I knew what made him change his mind about Egypt.” She had an impressively convincing act. Had I not known the truth, I never would have guessed that she was lying. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe it was the heat,” I said with a shrug. “I ran into Nymphadora Tonks too while I was in the area, so it’s nice to know that at least someone likes their dream job. But everyone keeps saying strange things...you know, about the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mouth became a thin line, but she said calmly, “You sound like you’ve been out of the loop.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not out of the loop exactly,” I replied. “I just know that the farther information has to travel, the more likely I am to be misinformed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well said. If I may inquire, what new position were you thinking of taking?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I hesitated, knowing she would disagree with my plan. “Well, since Tonks makes it look so cool, I was thinking of becoming an Auror.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her reaction was exactly as expected as I was struck with a soul-cutting glare. “You </span>
  <em>
    <span>have</span>
  </em>
  <span> been misinformed,” she said sharply. “There is no security in such a position, not like there once was. And especially not for someone of your...particular talents.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what would you recommend I do?” I asked, slightly frustrated. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I recommend you go back to Australia for the meantime. For your own good. Things here are becoming complicated. It’s not safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not safe?” I tugged up my left sleeve to reveal the scars that tattooed my arm—tributes to various burns, bites, scratches, and even the odd spell or two. “I work with creatures from Australia!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lilianna,” she said warningly, but her eyes were on my arm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I pulled the sleeve back down. “I have my own reasons for returning to Britain, as you very well know,” I said. “If I’ve heard correctly, things aren’t just going to blow over. They’re going to get worse. You’ll need all the help you can get.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Lilianna.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I fell silent, partially out of chagrin. So much for subtlety...not that it had ever been my strong suit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>McGonagall sighed and lowered her voice so that I could barely hear her. “Five years since you graduated, and you haven’t changed a bit. When there’s trouble, you always have to run towards it, never away from it like a sensible person. This is why I’m glad you were Filius’s problem and not mine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I stared at her suspiciously. That almost sounded like a joke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled, and I nearly fell out of my chair from shock. That </span>
  <em>
    <span>had </span>
  </em>
  <span>been a joke. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You say that,” I chuckled, “but I’m fairly certain you took more house points away from me than he did.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She let her voice return to a normal volume. “I do think he was too fond of you for your own good, and I’ll never forgive him for teaching you how to duel as a first-year, but you were a good student. And I’ll admit I was softer on you than I should have been as well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If he hadn’t taught me, then I would’ve found someone else,” I pointed out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As you most clearly demonstrated, time and time again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I grinned at her annoyance, but I also couldn’t suppress a wave of guilt. I loved my old professors, but I had put them through hell for as long as I had known them, even if it had never been intentional. “I hope you know I hated disappointing him,” I said, “and you and Dumbledore, but it was always to do what I thought was right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even if it was stupid and dangerous and wrong, I know,” she said, and my grin became sheepish. “It is honestly a miracle you lived to graduate. I hope you’ll never do anything like that again!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No promises,” I laughed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sighed again. “This is where you’re supposed to lie to me. I’ve had my own problems to deal with since you’ve been gone. Speaking of…” Her eyes flicked to the doorway. “Do you need something, Ms. Granger, or are you going to continue to eavesdrop from around the corner?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked over my shoulder to see a student enter the room with a guilty expression on her face. She looked to be a fifth- or sixth-year, wore Gryffindor robes, and had a wild mane of curly brown hair. I wondered how long she had been listening in or—and this was even more pressing—how long McGonagall had known she had been listening in.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, Professor,” the girl said sincerely. “I didn’t want to interrupt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s quite all right,” McGonagall said unconcernedly. “We were just catching up. What can I do for you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The girl handed her a small slip of parchment. “I was wondering if I could get your permission to check this book out of the Restricted Section. I want to do some extra reading on defensive spells….the theory of them, I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>McGonagall adjusted her spectacles as she studied the parchment. “Oh?” she said, taking the exact same tone she had used with me just minutes ago. “These are highly advanced spells, well beyond the capability of the average fifth-year. Why not ask your Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor instead?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I stared at her in bewilderment. That sounded like another joke, but I didn’t know why that would be.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re my Head of House,” the girl replied a bit too cheerfully. “I figured it would be best to go straight to you. I didn’t want to accidentally do something you would be unhappy with after all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I had told enough lies in my life to recognize one when I heard it, and this lie was bald-faced. There was no doubt that McGonagall was aware of this too, which is why I found her next actions even more bewildering. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I see no harm in letting you do some extra reading, so long as it is purely theory,” she said. “I’ll sign the permission slip only if you promise that I won’t catch you performing these spells. The same goes for Potter, Weasley, and whoever else. Understand?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I didn’t miss the loophole in her conditions, and it was clear from the girl’s excited face that she didn’t either. “Yes, of course!” she exclaimed. “Thank you, Professor!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t thank me,” McGonagall said seriously. “I will not bail you out if you get yourselves into trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I stared in amazement as she dipped a quill in ink and began to sign the parchment. I leaned toward the desk and murmured, “What happened to our conversation about Flitwick teaching me to duel?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told you things are different,” she said without looking up from her task. “I probably should have asked you this first, Lily, but does Umbridge know you’re here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An image of the pink-clad, toad-faced old witch forced its way into my mind, and I had to fight the urge to shudder. She had all but assaulted me upon my arrival, which was the opposite of a pleasant introduction. She reminded me of Emily Tyler—that is, if Emily Tyler had fused with a manticore. “I haven’t exactly been keeping my presence a secret,” I said. “She demanded to know what I was doing here, so I told the truth: that I’ve been out of the country for a while and wanted to visit old friends, but she wouldn’t believe me. Insisted on personally inspecting the package. She finally left me alone when a chocolate frog mysteriously escaped and jumped on her face.” I winked at the girl. She remarkably didn’t laugh, but her lips pressed tightly together, which was enough for me.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>McGonagall gave me another stern look. “Know that I am serious when I say this: avoid her at all costs. You would do best not to get on her bad side.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Prof...Minerva. But I can’t go sneaking around or people will think I’m up to something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just try to behave. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Both</span>
  </em>
  <span> of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me,” the girl addressed me. “But did I hear correctly? Are you Lilianna Flores?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had heard of me? That wasn’t necessarily a good sign. “I am,” I said amiably. “And you must be the student Professor McGonagall was just telling me about—the one that is outshining my old house. Hermione Granger, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked thrilled that I knew her name. “Yes! Oh, it is such an honor to meet you! I read about you in the latest edition of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hogwarts: A History</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Your rediscovery of the Cursed Vaults is legendary. And you’re one of the seven Animagi to be registered in the twentieth century, not to mention the youngest—registering at only thirteen, a few years before Talbott Winger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I was in history textbooks now? Oh, no, that was most definitely not a good sign. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I tried to hide my discomfort as I chuckled, “None of that’s based off of Rita Skeeter articles is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled knowingly. “Only the parts that call you the Mad Witch. But I don’t read Rita Skeeter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I didn’t know whether to feel amused or sick, and the result was an odd combination.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All right, Ms. Granger,” McGonagall said sternly, handing back the piece of parchment. “Don’t you have a class to get to?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right, Professor. I’ll get going,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One more thing.” McGonagall held up the parcel. “Can you deliver this to the Weasley siblings when you get the chance? It’s from their mother.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione blinked in curious surprise. “Oh, of course,” she said and tucked it under one arm. She gave me a wave with her free hand. “It was nice meeting you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was nice meeting you too!” I responded cheerfully. “I’m honored that you were honored.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And close the door on your way out!” McGonagall ordered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She did as instructed, but not before I heard an excited shout of, “Did you get it?” from the corridor, followed by a warning hiss. I pressed the back of my hand to my mouth and tried not to laugh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that why you praised her?” I asked. “Because she was listening?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>McGonagall smiled with rare pride. “I would have even if she had not.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I glanced at the closed door. “Sorry for getting carried away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is all right. I doubt the act would have fooled anyone for very long when both of us are already under suspicion.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I speak openly now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded. “To a certain degree. There is a protective charm on the room, but be careful.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I took a breath. This was it. We had finally reached the point in this entire roundabout conversation that we had been trying to reach, but now I barely had the courage to say the words aloud. “Is it true what they’re saying?” I asked quietly. “Has You-Know-Who returned?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took a deep breath as well and did not speak until after she had exhaled. “Here’s what I know. Officially, it has not been confirmed, but Harry Potter says he saw him come back. That boy is many things, but he is not a liar. And someone or something killed Cedric Diggory during the Triwizard Tournament. That was not an accident, not with the way the Death Eaters have been gathering. The evidence stands, but the Ministry denies it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see,” I murmured. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gazed at me in gentle concern. “How are you?” she asked. “I know he was a good friend of yours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I shifted uncomfortably. “I’m fine,” I said unconvincingly. In truth, Cedric’s death had hit me harder than I had expected it to, possibly because of the death it had reminded me of, but while it was the reason I had returned to Britain, it had little to do with why I was sitting in this chair.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She studied me with a hard to read expression. “You already knew all of this. Why are you really here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I tried to smile, but I felt my face slip into a grimace. “It’s funny that she brought up Talbott Winger. You know his whole story.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, the poor boy. Both parents killed by Death Eaters. He was lucky to have escaped.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He escaped because he was unregistered.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you saying?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I picked at a loose thread on my glove. “Talbott was terrified to go to the Ministry. He was afraid that if he registered, it would happen again, only this time, he wouldn’t get out alive. I’m the one that finally convinced him to register. I told him it would never happen again. That You-Know-Who was never coming back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I always had good intentions. I always thought I was doing the right thing, but people usually ended up getting hurt anyway, sometimes in a way that was irreversible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her expression softened. “You couldn’t have known. I didn’t either, or I never would have encouraged your transformation in the first place. Keep in mind that it would have been a greater risk to remain unregistered. Had the two of you been caught, as you certainly would have, you would have been sent straight to Azkaban.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So prison rather than death?” I said glumly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You exaggerate. The Death Eaters pick their targets based on who they wish to persecute and who stands the greatest threat to them. Animagi are threatening not because of their abilities, but because of how they choose to use them. And if I may speak from personal experience, this does not mean our enemies know what you or I look like in our animal forms.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That was the case in the Wizarding War. You were able to work with the Ministry to fight You-Know-Who’s forces. But things are different now. The Ministry isn’t on our side, and I don’t know what to do. Who are we supposed to trust?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is the question, isn’t it? I don’t know any more than you do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I leaned forward, hands braced against my knees, silent for a moment. A weight hung in the air—a weight that I was fairly certain hung over all of Britain...of Europe...maybe even the world. We were heading into a tunnel, and no one knew if there was an end in sight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, I straightened and attempted a laugh. “You know, I was waiting for an I-told-you-so—about the dangers of becoming an Animagus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gave a faint smile. “In truth, you deserve it. You deserve numerous more scoldings than I or any other teacher ever gave you. But I’ve always been too proud. You were my best Transfiguration student, even if you were the most troublesome. It has always been one of my greatest dilemmas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now I truly did laugh. “Glad I could make such a lasting impression!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is one of your talents.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I know.” I glanced at the clock on the wall and made to stand up. “I should get going. There are a few more people I need to see. Thank you, Minerva. I really needed this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“While we’re being open with each other, as did I. It was good of you to stop by, Lily.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I gave her a small wave from the doorway. “Until next time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>* * * *</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a brief friendly exchange with Flitwick, who insisted I call him Filius from then on, I was left with one more person to see. “Fizzing Whizbee!” I declared to the stone gargoyle as I tried to keep a straight face. As expected, the gargoyle leapt aside, granting me entrance to the Headmaster’s office. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I would forever be awed by the great circular room, with its walls covered in paintings of all the old headmasters and its tables and shelves filled with mysterious moving bits and bobs. I had been given the liberty to explore many times while waiting to meet with Dumbledore as a student, so I felt an odd intimacy with its dust and clutter, like that of an old friendship. I had probably spent </span>
  <em>
    <span>too </span>
  </em>
  <span>much time here since half the visits had involved a scolding for the latest bit of trouble I had gotten into. Still, I could spend the rest of my life in this office and never discover all its secrets. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The silver-bearded Headmaster himself was seated at his desk, his phoenix, Fawkes, perched beside him. He smiled warmly when he saw me and gestured at one of two chairs before his desk. “Come, come, Lily! Have a seat!” He waited until I did as instructed before continuing, “I’m so glad you could meet with me. How have you been?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Quite well, sir. It is good to be back. And yourself?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His blue eyes sparkled. “As well as can be, given the circumstances. You’ve seen the papers, so you know we’ve hit a bit of a rough patch. But I have faith the right people will prevail.” A rough patch was an understatement, but his optimism was comforting. I found myself relaxing in his presence. Dumbledore always seemed to have a calming effect on people—or at least those that weren’t part of the Ministry of Magic. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll admit I was surprised to get your Patronus,” I said. “I didn’t know they could do that.” Startled was perhaps the more accurate word. I had been surprised when the silvery phoenix had materialized in my bedroom, but I had knocked over a stack of books when it had started speaking in Dumbledore’s voice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A little trick of my own invention,” he said cheerfully. “And you learned it so quickly too! By that alone I knew you were the right person for the job.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it you want me to do?” I asked. He had not given me any details other than that he had a task for me. My decision to drop everything and return home had essentially been based on nothing more than blind trust and a restlessness that had settled in my chest since Cedric’s death. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore’s kind expression told me he understood this, but he said, “If you will just be patient a minute longer, I promise I will tell you everything. One more person will be joining us, and I’d prefer not to waste your time by telling a long story twice. She’s an old acquaintance of yours in fact.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An old acquaintance? That could have been numerous people. I barely had enough time to guess who it might be, however, when a voice spoke from behind me: “No need. I’m here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That voice. That soft, lilting voice with a rough edge forced into it—I knew that voice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>My heart leapt into my throat and then slammed back down into my chest as I spun around in my chair to see none other than Merula Snyde striding across the room. She was the very last person I had expected. My brain had not connected “old acquaintance” with the girl that had declared herself my enemy from Year One. Not that we were enemies now, but still...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merula,” I greeted, unable to keep the stupefaction out of my voice. “It’s been a while.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smirked. “Five years. I wasn’t expecting to find you here, Flores. You look well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As do you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was no lie. She was dressed in all black from her cloak to her stockings, and she wore a tunic that was strikingly accented with silver and green. Her wand was strapped in a sheath at her hip, on which she rested one gloved hand, and she sported an old pair of combat boots. She had changed very little from when I had last seen her at graduation. Her chin-length brown curls with their fiery orange streak were still untamed, and black eyeshadow still lined her violet eyes, which were as sharp and cunning as ever. Maybe it was the outfit or the way she lifted her chin, but this once scrappy witch looked </span>
  <em>
    <span>powerful</span>
  </em>
  <span>—and she knew it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry I’m late,” she said, dropping into the seat beside me without waiting for an invitation. “I was held up by the old witch downstairs. She’s in a foul mood because she’s convinced someone set a rogue chocolate frog on her. You wouldn’t know anything about that, would you, Flores?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I winced. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore maintained a straight face. “It pleases me to see that you two are your usual selves, but I would request that you keep your more controversial tendencies to a minimum while under the scrutiny of the Ministry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>To her credit, Merula adopted the same chastised expression I did as we both mumbled out apologies. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fortunately, he appeared more amused than angry. “Although, as they say, well-behaved witches seldom make history, which is partly why I called you here this evening. Now that Miss Snyde has joined us, we may begin. Tell me, do either of you know anything about the Order of the Phoenix?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only rumors,” Merula said. “Officially it didn’t exist. At least, the Ministry tries hard to make it seem like it didn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore glanced at me, and I shook my head. “Nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Order,” he informed us, “was a secret organization that I founded during the First Wizarding War. It was made up of many noble witches and wizards who worked from the shadows to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters, while at the same time protecting those he would persecute. We existed separately from the Ministry and the Aurors and thus could work without restrictions as the unseen frontlines of the war. I’m sure you know the names of some of the members—the Potters, the Longbottoms, and the Wingers were just a few of the great wizarding families that joined the cause. Of course, as you can also guess, there were many who lost their lives, and those who did survive were never the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what does this have to do with us?” Merula asked him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked grim. “Regardless of what the Ministry is telling the public, both of you know the truth. Voldemort has returned, and he will not wait for the world to become aware of his presence before he makes his next move.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I couldn’t help but flinch every time he said You-Know-Who’s name, and I had to fight to control my rising heart rate. </span>
  <em>
    <span>First </span>
  </em>
  <span>Wizarding War? He was making it sound as if...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merula, on the other hand, was unfazed, and she straightened in her chair as she caught on. “So what you’re saying is...?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded. “Your thoughts are correct. While the Ministry fails to react, both the Wizarding and Muggle worlds remain vulnerable. For this reason, a new Order of the Phoenix has risen—the Second Order—with a new generation of witches and wizards to fight for it. You already know several of its members personally.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Weasley boys,” I realized. “And Tonks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Precisely.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That likely meant some of the professors as well, including McGonagall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you want us to join the Order of the Phoenix?” Merula’s expression was fierce, although I couldn’t tell if it was from excitement or something else. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is my proposal, yes,” he said. “It would be highly dangerous, and I cannot guarantee you would make it out of this war alive. It is for this reason that not all of your friends accepted when I reached out to them, and I do not blame them for their decision. But much as I would rather send you two far away from here, these are desperate times, and you are among the most talented young witches I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>War. The word echoed in my mind. We were going to war. It didn’t seem real. I swallowed back the unwanted feelings of panic as I inquired, “What would you have us do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smiled, but the gesture was unusually subdued. “Now we get to the heart of the matter,” he said. “Each of you has your own unique talents and benefits to offer. Like, let’s say, a position inside the Ministry of Magic?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merula scoffed and shook her head. “It’s not as beneficial as you might think,” she said when she noticed me looking at her inquisitively. “Yeah, sure, I work in the Auror Office, but they don’t exactly let the daughter of Death Eaters go chasing after Dark Wizards. Your would-be inside source is currently chained to a desk.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was news to me. I had heard from Tonks and Talbott that Merula had become an Auror along with them, but neither had mentioned that she wasn’t allowed into the field. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I wanted a person inside the government, that would pose a difficulty, true,” Dumblebore agreed. “But your position is unique for another reason. Merula, would you mind telling Lily what you told me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She abruptly stiffened, and I saw something uncertain flash behind her eyes. It lasted only a second before she composed herself and sighed, as if bored or disinterested. “I was approached,” she said, waving a hand uncaringly. “Apparently some people think I’m unhappy with my job. And they would be right. I’ve done everything the Ministry’s asked of me—passed all the tests, met all the qualifications, and they still stick me with the paperwork. I don’t pretend to think this is fair, so some old friends of my parents decided I might want a better opportunity.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>My eyes widened. “Death Eaters? Inside the Ministry?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did they want from you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing yet. Just to know where my loyalties lie. I implied I would be standing by to offer my support when the Dark Lord returns to power.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You did what?” I gasped. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What was I supposed to do?” she snapped. “Tell them to bugger off and then wait to be hit with the Killing Curse in my sleep? I don’t think so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I...I mean, that makes sense.” The idea of being in that situation was simply horrifying to me. The enemy was inside the Ministry. That meant they could be anywhere or controlling anyone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She blew out a breath at her fringe, and when that didn’t make it move, tucked her hair behind one ear. “Believe me, I don’t want anything to do with Death Eaters. ‘Pure-blood supremacy,’” she made air quotes, “is one thing. Murder is another.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you went to Dumbledore?” I asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not at first. I, uh…” She hesitated, looked strangely sheepish. “I debated running. But that pink-haired friend of yours is too nosy for her own good. She caught on and had one of her own crazy friends ambush me in my own home.” Her face twisted at the memory. “The guy was insane. He confronted me about being a traitor and threatened to blow me up on the spot. I’m pretty sure he would have if she hadn’t stopped him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore chuckled. “Yes, Alastor can be rather intense, but he is a talented Auror and a truly loyal and dependable man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I nearly laughed. Of course she was talking about Mad-Eye Moody. I had had plenty of my own experiences with the ex-Auror, and “rather intense” was a mild way of describing him. Paranoid would be another. Dumbledore was right though; I trusted Mad-Eye with my life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I still think his name is accurate for more than one reason,” Merula grumbled. “Anyway, they’re the ones that have been setting up my communications with Dumbledore. Not sure I got them to trust me, but as long as they never come into my home again, I don’t care.” She faced Dumbledore directly. “Is that what you want me to do, old man? Play double agent?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not exactly,” he said. “At least not to an extreme. I have agents far inside the Ministry and far inside the Death Eaters, but not one on the edge of both. And for as opinionated as you claim to be, you have quite the, shall I say, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Slytherin</span>
  </em>
  <span> aptitude to not burn any bridges you don’t want burned, not to mention the influence of belonging to an old and respected family. You are in the perfect position to wait, to listen, and to prepare yourself for when the time comes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When the time comes for what exactly?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When the balance of the world shifts, be it toward a good outcome or not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t get it.” She sounded annoyed. “If we have such an advantage, why do you need me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is the problem,” he said seriously. “We do not have an advantage. We only have the means to ensure we do not all die instantaneously when darkness and chaos descend, and even then nothing is certain. No, Merula, the world needs all the help it can get.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She fell silent, and I could have sworn I saw her face whiten.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As terrifying as Dumbledore’s words were, I understood Merula’s annoyance. His plan for her didn’t make sense. What good would being on the edges of multiple sides do? She would never be trusted by any of them with that position. It sounded more like a hindrance than a benefit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have patience,” he said calmly, as if reading our minds. Maybe he was. “I will tell you all the details when I need you to act.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merula looked far from happy, so I took the opportunity to speak before she could share her opinions. “And me?” I asked. “What do you need from me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What I need from you, Lily, is to make a choice,” he said. “After this meeting, you will return to your vacation, before the end of which you will receive an owl from a good friend with a business proposition. You can either accept the offer of the new job and move somewhere close by, or you can respectfully decline and go back to shuttling creatures to and from Australia, away from the thick of the mess of current politics. You do not have to decide now, and you will not be faulted for your decision, but I hope you know that, like Merula, you have a lot to offer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I hesitated in giving my answer. This was a lot to take in, and frankly, it all terrified me. We were going to war. People were going to die. Maybe even my friends were going to die. Maybe I would too. But deep down, I knew without a doubt what the right thing was to do. It just wasn’t the easy thing to do. “I’ll think it over,” I told him, “but I’m pretty sure I’ve already made my choice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As have I,” Merula added. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore smiled. “I expected as much. I look forward to hearing from you soon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>* * * *</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Merula and I walked down the stairs from the Headmaster’s office in uncomfortable silence. I didn’t know what to say. I had an odd feeling similar to being hit with a stunning jinx, so my muddled thoughts didn’t make starting a conversation any easier. It hadn’t exactly been like we were the best of friends. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Five years. Where had the time gone?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fortunately she broke the silence with a grumble when we reached the corridor: “Crazy old fool. He told us everything and nothing. How is that even possible?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I laughed in relief. “With Dumbledore? Anything’s possible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Almost anything,” she muttered, almost to herself. Her gaze fixed on something I couldn’t see. “Are you going to do it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think so. I feel like there’s more to lose if I don’t.” I had already come halfway around the world at the drop of a hat. I was being impulsive, naturally, but maybe that was for a good reason.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She rolled her eyes, a classic move I had missed. “Always have to play the hero, don’t you, Flores? For me, anything’s better than spending the rest of my life in that stuffy old building.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Almost anything,” I corrected her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unexpectedly, she cringed. “R-right.” We paused as the hallway diverged. “Are you going a different way?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I nodded. “There are a few more people I want to see before I go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All right then. Sounds like I’ll be seeing you around. But take my advice and stay away from chocolate frogs in the meantime, for your own sake.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now I laughed for real. “I’ll try, but no promises. And, yeah, I’ll see you.” I turned to go, but her voice called my attention back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Flores?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hesitated, lips parted uncertainly. A beat passed. Then, “Never mind. It’s just...never mind. I’ll see you.” With that, she spun on her heel and disappeared down the opposite hallway, leaving me alone in my confusion. Well, then...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I shook my head and continued walking. It was almost time to go home. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Home. I was coming home. </span>
