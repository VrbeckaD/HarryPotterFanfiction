    <p>The scars on his wrists were old by the time he arrived at Godric's Hollow. </p>
<p>The wind picked at his coat tails, pushing at his body, as if to repel him from the only place he had left to go. Bagshot. The name spread like curdled milk against his tongue and mind, tasting of shame and resentment. He spit it out onto wooden panels of the porch, then gave the growling lion's head knocker a leveled look, taking it into his hand and letting it fall once. It whimpered under his touch. </p>
<p>The locks on the door clicked and clacked, clattering like unstrung piano keys. When the door finally swung open, all that stood to greet him was an empty foyer and a waft of warm caramel laced with cinnamon. A rasping voice called from the left, "We're in the kitchen, dear!" </p>
<p>We?  Taking another step forward, the door slammed close, knitting up each lock with a rhythmic pattern of clicks. Setting down the case, he walked to the left, through the dining area, and into the open arch of the kitchen hallway. He kept the right hand tucked into his pocket. A tremor of morbid curiosity prickled his fingers. Who could possibly stand the company of his droll great-aunt? </p>
<p>He rounded the corner with a sharp turn of his heel, stepping down into the cloying cloud of caramel and cinnamon, wrapping him in a warm blanket. He spotted his small relative first, her silver hair catching the lamp light to form a wispy halo around her head.  Then his eyes caught a flash of copper. </p>
<p>Curls, not necessarily unkempt, but particularly fashioned to give the air of effortlessly perfected disorder, framed a small face. A smile startled Gellert from his analysis, and he reciprocated just in time to not seem construed. The copper headed boy stepped towards him, unaware of what danger he approached, "Hello, my name's Albus Dumbledore." </p>
<p>A silence swallowed him up, in a sliver of timelessness that he could only accredit to a spike in adrenaline and shock. Like stepping out into open air when you were certain the next step would be on firm land. The world seemed to tilt, turn, twist, like he was being Apparated in place. The name was as familiar to him as his own, far before he'd known the meaning. He had carved it off his skin, as to hide it from prying eyes, the moment he had learned it was a masculine name. </p>
<p>Everyone knew the meaning of the words scrawled into the wrists of wizards, even if they were not cursed with it themselves. How could someone possibly be envious of it, or desire it upon themselves--to be tied to a stranger, even before the world knew of your existence, and to be led by an invisible fate, unable to break from the path carved for you. </p>
<p>He stepped forward, letting his height be known. His smile still plastered on his face, suiting its purpose of looking friendly and approachable, he said, "Which spell did my dear great-aunt Bathilda cast upon you to have you in her company?" </p>
<p>A twinkle lit in Dumbledore's left eye, either by the lamp light or by some intrinsic fey light, clasping his hands together behind his back, rather like an elderly professor, "It's a rather powerful spell, old and traditional, and unexpectedly easy to learn, but unfathomably difficult to master without guidance." </p>
<p>The unexpected response sparked the curiosity once more, striking a slightly different match inside his empty coal hearth of a soul. His fingers twitched inside his pocket, eager to grab hold and see exactly what kind of wizard this boy was. "Care to enlighten this ignorant soul?" </p>
<p>Dumbledore swept a hand to the animated stirring of spoons in pots and the dusting of cinnamon from a glass container above the swirling melt of sugar. "<i>Coquo Bellaria.</i>" As if by his wandless and soundless command, the spoons lifted from the pots and spun the sweet syrup into tight coils, laying them in neat lines on the parchment papers. Bagshot clapped her hands together in delight, laughing with a shared secret. "I dare say he might be as clever as you, Gellert." </p>
<p>The way Albus looked at him changed in that moment, fingers instinctively reach for the long sleeves around the wrists. He could save them both a future of trouble and walk out of the house once again, but instead, he said, "I am Gellert Grindelwald." </p>
<p>
  <i>Your soulmate, for better or for worse.</i>
