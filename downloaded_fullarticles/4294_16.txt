    <p>The Orphans</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I own nothing of these characters and thank J.K. Rowling for allowing me to play in her sand box.</p>
<p>Prologue<br/>December 31 1926</p>
<p>A woman dressed in rags walked down the streets of London with no idea where she was going. She was in so much pain, you see she was going into labour and didn’t have money to go to a hospital. She kept walking till she spotted a building that read ‘ Wools Orphanage’. </p>
<p>Merope, as was the woman’s name, staggered up the front steps and knocked on the door, a few minutes later a girl of about 18 opened the door and seeing the pregnant woman led her quickly inside.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Cole!! ” bellowed the girl behind her to call on the matron “ come quick there is a woman in labour!! “.<br/>“ what are you doing dear outside on a day like this and about to give birth no less?? “</p>
<p>“ please please help me I have no where to go and no money please let me keep my baby safe I’ll do anything “ pleaded the woman.</p>
<p>“ okay dear you just lie down here know and we’ll help you give birth, my name is Martha, I’m going to get some things ready first hold on dear”. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then a woman of about 28 entered the room and looked at the other woman, she noticed that she was really ugly, wearing rags like the homeless people and heavy with child, she looked really bad and Mrs. Cole didn’t think she would make it through.</p>
<p>“ Hello, my name is Mrs. Cole the matron in this orphanage, don’t worry we will help you dear”.</p>
<p>An hour later the was a cry heard in the room as the baby took his first breath, and his mother was taking her last breaths as well.</p>
<p>“ I hope he looks like his Papa” said Merope “ please I want you to name him Tom after his father, Marvolo after my father and his last name is to be Riddle.”  With that Merope took her last breath. And so Tom Marvolo Riddle was born.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>March 15 1927<br/>Martha was walking around the orphanage checking on the children when she heard a cry just outside the door. She quickly went to check what was happening when she opened the door and saw the most beautiful baby she had ever laid eyes on, other that Tom of course. She quickly picked him up and carried him inside to the only room fit for a baby, which was Tom’s room. <br/>She put him on the changing pad and removed the blanket he was tucked in, on the corner she noticed what was probably the baby’s name. Hadrian Oscuro Corvus.</p>
<p>Martha then changed his clothes to dry ones and carried him to Mrs. Cole’s office. She knocked on the door and the she heard “ enter”.</p>
<p>“ Mrs. Cole I found this little angel left outside on the door step in the rain, who would leave a baby in the rain I don’t know, so I took him inside and changed his clothes and then came here so you can put his name in.”</p>
<p>“ You did well Martha, now what is his name, was there anything with him?” asked Mrs. Cole as she looked at the baby in Martha’s hands. He was truly the most beautiful thing, he had black straight hair, pale skin, and the greenest eyes she had looked at.</p>
<p>“ He had a blanket with him it was engraved with a name in the corner, Hadrian Oscuro Corvus.”</p>
<p>“ what a weird name its worse than Tom’s name at least he has normal names for both first and last” Mrs. Cole replied, “ put him in the room with Tom, he can use the company as he looks to be the same age and because we don’t have any other cots.”</p>
<p>“ Yes, Mrs. Cole” said Martha as she started walking back to Toms room. Once she put Hadrian in the cot and made sure they were both quiet she left to finish checking the other kids.</p>
<p>As soon as the two babies laid eyes on each other they knew they where the same, and so when Hadrian reached out and caught Toms hand their magic mingled and flashed a light that brightened the room. When the light faded both babies were asleep not knowing the meaning of the light nor that they had formed a magical bond that would only strengthen with time and wouldn’t know for a very long time.</p>
