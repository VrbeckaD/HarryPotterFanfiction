  <b>Thank you so much for reading, but please, please, please vote for EVERY chapter. I know it's difficult but it's very important that you </b>
  <b>
    <em>vote</em>
  </b>
  <b>. If you're a writer you'll understand that if I don't get votes than it seems like no one likes it, no matter how many views I get. PLEASE VOTE!!!</b>
</p>
<p>I'd also like to tell you some key things about this book, before you start reading it. For starters I have not finished even this prequel but I'm still going to upload it. I will update approximately once every two wejs, however, the more votes I get the sooner I update, most likely and my editor (shout out to the best person in this world and the person whom this book is dedicated to, my best friend Katelyn). Another thing this is a prequel meaning there's no real conflict going on yet, but there will be in the actual story, instead we just get a lot of friendship, some back story, and a but load of really subtle foreshadowing. Also, I'd like to talk about my writing style, I write about a lot of stuff happening but I don't bother spending that much time on describing how things look because you probably already know about stuff, if you don't like it don't read my story, okay? Don't talk about how you don't like it, because I <em>will</em> block you, you've been warned. I also tweak scenes from the actual story or edit people's personalities a bit (really not very much but a little bit). . . IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, JUST LEAVE!!! </p>
<p>Oh yes, also my author's notes aren't generally something you have to read, <em>unless</em>, it's in its own separate chapter or at the beginning of the chapter. If there's an author's notes that is one of these please read it. Otherwise feel free to continue on without reading. Thank you.<br/>
