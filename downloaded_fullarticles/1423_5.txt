    <p>Oliver's always liked Boxing Day. Boxing Day is the lazy morning after the holidays-- a short-lived, precious in-between that still carried the festive spirit of Christmas without the stress of gift-wrapping, traveling, and preparing for the inevitable hell that would be family dinner. It's also considered the unofficial beginning of the Quidditch practice season, which-- of course-- made him like it even more. The local test tourneys each region of Britain held would start late, then tended to run all day-- <em> all day! </em> -- and Oliver's been to every single one in his area almost <em> religiously </em>since he was a wee boy sitting on his father's shoulders.</p><p> Now that he's Keeper for Puddlemere United-- <em> really </em> the Keeper, he'd just been bumped up from reserve for the coming season-- it just made it all the better for him. He isn't that little boy anymore. He's actually <em> part </em> of the tradition now. He's going to be one of many fliers in the sky, weaving a new dream for the kids in the crowd, bringing people together via friendly competition.</p><p> Yeah, Oliver's always been fond of Boxing Day. Good people, good cheer, and a day dedicated to Quidditch. Not to mention that he has a fridge just chock-full of holiday leftovers waiting for him when he gets home-- his mum had shoved a generous helping of each course into his arms before he'd left his family's house, and like hell Oliver isn't looking forward to tucking into all of that after working up a roaring appetite.</p><p> It's going to be the start of a wonderful new tradition for his adult self.</p><p> He should have known that Marcus Flint would find a way to bugger it all to hell.</p><p> </p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>Despite the cold, the crowd that's gathered for the day is huge.</p><p> It's even bigger than Oliver's used to seeing it, but he's not surprised by the turnout. It feels like everyone's been struggling desperately to return to normalcy since the war, and what with the Quidditch World Cup cancelled last year, it was only natural the need for sport-- for a distraction-- had grown stronger.</p><p> His teammates, caught up in all the enthusiasm of another season, whoop and shout-- and he can't help himself enough to keep from joining in. For once, he ignores their assistant coach's attempts at getting them under control enough to pay attention to the roster. He's also not surprised when he sees Coach Deverill watching the proceedings with a despairing look on his face, wiping a handkerchief over his brow for the umpteenth time because he's sweating like a pig under his twenty-odd winter layers.</p><p> Oliver <em> is </em> surprised, however, when his eyesight zooms in on a familiar, hulking figure amidst the other teams that step out into the field.</p><p> It's Marcus Flint.</p><p> He steps out onto the snow-covered pitch, having traded the rich green of his old house colors for the murderous blood red of the Wigtown Wanderers. He's also <em> massive </em>, much more massive than he'd been in school, all shoulders and scars and swaggering muscle.</p><p> They make eye contact. Oliver looks away first, but not before the flash of recognition flickers over Flint's face.</p><p> He manages not to stare openly as Flint lumbers his way towards the central field with the rest of his team's Chasers, whom he dwarfs in comparison. In fact, he's proud to say he gets himself under control almost immediately, his eyes forward, his stance straight-- just generally looking smart as the schedule for the day booms out from the announcer standing on the pedestal located dead center. </p><p> Around them, the audience cheers, and he's never felt so proud of himself in his entire life. <em> This </em> was what he'd dreamed of since he was little-- to be here, on the pitch, part of something bigger than himself. He was part of a tradition now, <em> really </em> part of it. He belonged here.</p><p> All of the participating teams stand in a semicircle behind the announcer's box, and Flint's team, as luck would have it, is located just to the left of Oliver's.</p><p> He sees his old rival smirk at him out of the corner of his eye. He also very pointedly ignores him. He ignores him so hard he accidentally makes it obvious, which defeats the whole point.</p><p> Flint notices. Oh, does he notice.</p><p> "You look shit in blue," the Chaser informs him-- and it's <em> loud</em>, for fuck's sake. He's standing right on the end, and Oliver's standing right at the beginning of his line, and despite all that Flint practically shouts in his ear. Oliver's head turns sharply to glare but Flint is already looking forward again-- grinning with those ugly teeth of his as teammates snicker in the background.</p><p> Oliver's face goes ruddy and he glowers at the crowd. He breathes in through his nose and out through his mouth several times. He feels like he's back in school again, his hand clenching as if in the ghost of a brutal handshake he doesn't want to lose.</p><p>"Thanks," he finally says, full of fake cheer. He's trying to be mature but he knows his posture screams anything and everything juvenile he can think of like, 'of <em> course </em> you play for the Wigtown Wanderers' or 'I didn't think it was possible to look sallow in both green <em> and </em> red' or even 'at least I can change my robes, <em> you'd </em> need to rearrange your entire face.'</p><p>He turns in time to see Flint smirk nastily, confirming that, yes, he <em> did </em> know all of the awful things Wood wanted to say, and yes, it was still satisfying to see Oliver struggle and inevitably fail to control himself.</p><p>Sodding bastard git.</p><p> "Quit it, Wood," one of his teammates whispers, elbowing him in the side when their stare-down gets too intense. Oliver snaps to attention, chewing the inside of his cheek furiously and vowing to beat the bleeding shitlights out of every pass thrown at him today, <em> especially </em> from the Wigtown Wanderers.</p><p> Because this was <em> his </em> favorite holiday, dammit. This was his new tradition, and he was going to do it justice.</p><p> And if he managed to smack a certain troll-faced, Slytherin bastard in the face with the Quaffle on a save, well.</p><p> It'd be a plus, to say the least.</p><p> </p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>Their first match is against the Chudley Cannons, and Oliver almost feels bad for blocking every fumbled shot they attempt to make. Almost, because every failed goal they try for still brings a huge uproar from the crowd. Every score Puddlemere makes leaves them whooping and cheering for more. It's an addictive feeling, and Oliver can't stop grinning.</p><p> That is, until he spots Flint from the player bleachers below, like he has <em> eagle </em> vision or something, sneering up at him with his lip curled and his eyes glinting maliciously.</p><p> As he's momentarily distracted he ends up getting hit in the arse with the Quaffle, bouncing the ball into the hoop behind him for the first (and only!) score the Chudley Cannons get on them. The whole stadium erupts into laughter-- including his teammates, the bastards.</p><p> Oliver is mortified. From below, Flint barks out a laugh, too-- and even though Oliver is too far up to hear it he knows exactly what it sounds like-- derisive, deep, and bleeding obnoxious.</p><p> Burning red, he shrugs at his team's Beaters and scratches his head, trying to smile it off and keeping his eyes straight ahead, rigidly ignoring the world below for the rest of the game.</p><p> </p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>"Nice pity score, Wood," Flint taunts as soon as he touches ground. "You best not lose before I get my hands on you."</p><p> Oliver stiffens.</p><p> "Leave it, would you?" He asks, <em> carefully</em>, because if he does, no one can say he didn't try to be civil. He has a dark feeling that he's going to inevitably punch Flint in the face. "It's Boxing Day."</p><p> Flint sneers.</p><p> "So?" he asks, and Oliver knows, he <em> knows </em> it's just a bleeding taunt, but he feels every muscle in his jaw go tight, every pint of blood in his system boil. There's something in Flint's tone that always put Oliver off his game-- something only he seemed to notice, and it drove him fucking mental that no one else could seem to pick up on it. Even after all these years he can still hear it-- that <em> something </em> in his voice that implies Flint is playing at something <em> bigger </em> every time he goads Oliver. He's <em> sure </em> there's something else, but <em> no one ever believes him</em>, because Marcus Flint is too stupid to think more than two minutes ahead of himself. He was just another Crabbe, another Goyle, another mindless minion who'd just grown up without someone to follow around.</p><p> <em> 'He was held back a year, Wood,' </em> he remembers Percy Weasley stressing to him. <em> 'Unless you're suggesting he did it on purpose,' </em> he'd said, and then laughed, because the idea was fucking preposterous.</p><p> And it should have been, and Oliver should have laughed, too, but he spotted Flint eyeing him from across the Transfigurations classroom-- leering at him, sizing him up, and Oliver... wasn't so sure how funny Weasley's theory was, anymore.</p><p> Slytherins did tend to take revenge to a whole new level.</p><p>In the present, Flint is still talking.</p><p> "--Boxing Day is stupid," he says, and Oliver's fingers clench so hard the leather of his gloves stretch with an audible creak. "This bloody practice tourney is stupid, even, right after a major holiday. I bet you half of these players are bloody hung over. Hell, Gudgeon is throwing up <em> right now</em>." He points over to the Cannons, where their Seeker is, indeed, throwing up into some sort of wastebasket, most likely Conjured.</p><p> Oliver ignores the sight. He's not about to let Flint rain on his parade.</p><p> "If you think I'll lose at all today," He says, hating the glee that sparks in Flint's eyes, "You're sorely mistaken."</p><p> Then he stomps off.</p><p> </p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>The semi-finals kick off somewhere in the late afternoon, with Puddlemere United against none other than the Wigtown Wanderers. And Flint, in true Flint fashion, tackles the fuck out of Oliver the first chance he gets, and sends them spiraling towards the ground.</p><p> It's not anything Oliver isn't used to. In fact, he's kind of more than used to it-- it's probably the only real strategy Flint ever used back in school because it's the only one he knew <em> worked</em>. Oliver wants to say that he himself is smarter now-- that's he's stronger, that he knows his way out of this bleeding, stupid foul-- but the truth is? Flint's really fucking strong. That hasn't changed-- hell, it might even be truer than it was four, five years ago. Flint is all swaggering shoulders and lanky, corded muscle, and even though Oliver surely is no flobberworm, the fact is: all of that force being focused entirely on keeping him out of commission is not easy to get out of.</p><p> He struggles hard, keeping his elbows in even as he feels something in his mental control straining so far back it feels like it's going to snap. Oliver's always been good about playing the game-- he doesn't lose his temper, he doesn't trash talk, he doesn't <em> foul,</em> for fuck's sake-- but Flint's always brought him really close to temptation.</p><p> <em> Really </em> close.</p><p> "Get the hell off me!" he snaps, and the furious blaring whistle of the referee in his ears lets him know he's not the only one incensed at the illegal contact. Flint's mouth just quirks to the side in response, and with the tilt of his broom handle he shoves Oliver's broom down, sending them tumbling towards the rapidly approaching, frozen grass of the pitch.</p><p> Towards where Puddlemere's Chasers are flying low in a valiant effort to avoid being punished by Wigtown's offensive. Which is, Oliver will begrudgingly admit, a really fucking brilliant offensive, and exactly why he needs Flint to <em> get the hell off of him. </em></p><p> "Shove off, Flint!" Oliver shouts.</p><p> "Bite me!" Flint snarls back, his teeth bared in a wild grin.</p><p> "I might," Oliver threatens, before he can stop himself, and he thinks it's weird that it makes Flint <em> laugh</em>, like he's enjoying himself-- but then Oliver notices their trajectory and forcefully rolls them to the side at the last second to avoid hitting one of the Chasers rushing away below them.</p><p> That's when he sees the Bludger heading straight for his face, and realizes belatedly <em> why </em> the Chaser behind them had been in such a hurry.</p><p>He hears a <em> crack </em> that's the ball slamming into the side of his head, and has about three seconds to watch it stagger off-kilter into the night before he blacks out, plummeting towards the grass.</p>
