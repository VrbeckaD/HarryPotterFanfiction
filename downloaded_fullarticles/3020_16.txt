    <p>It had been a beautiful ceremony. You hadn’t expected anything less from Fleur and you couldn’t believe that you were witness to such an amazing day, let alone that Fleur had asked you to be one of her bridesmaids.</p>
<p>You had been friends with Bill and Charlie since you met at Hogwarts. They had helped you to find the cursed vaults and supported you when you discovered the truth about your brother. </p>
<p>Through Bill, you had met Fleur and the two of you had grown close over time. She even knew that you used to have a teenage crush on Bill when the two of you had gotten drunk on nettle wine one night and exchanged secrets. You had been one of the first people to come to her side when Bill was attacked by Fenrir Greyback.</p>
<p>You and Charlie however had grown apart after he had moved to Romania. His responses to your letters which were once frequent were now few and far between. You could feel him distancing himself from you and you weren’t sure why.</p>
<p>You took at seat at an empty table to rest your feet and watched him dance with one of Fleur’s Veela cousins. You felt a twinge of jealousy in the pit of your stomach, but you distracted yourself by pouring some pumpkin juice into your glass.</p>
<p>“I always thought it would be you and Bill getting married,” Molly sighed, sitting down next to you, “You seemed so close when he would bring you home to visit.”</p>
<p>“No, no, we’re just good friends, I’m very happy for him and Fleur,” you smiled at Molly before taking a sip of your drink.</p>
<p>“Yes, and you’re in love with Charlie,” Molly hummed.</p>
<p>You spluttered and looked at her wide-eyed.</p>
<p>“If it makes you feel better, he loves you too,” Molly smiled, patting your shoulder.</p>
<p>“Molly –“ You began to protest.</p>
<p>“Ginny, dear,” Molly waved and quickly walked over to her daughter who had abruptly turned and started to walk in the other direction.</p>
<p>You chuckled and looked back over to Charlie and the Veela. He was looking over at you with a sad smile. You watched him whisper into his dancing partner’s ear and walk over to you. You poured him a glass of juice and handed it over to him as he sat down.</p>
<p>“So, what does my mother have to say for herself?”</p>
<p>“I should have been the one marrying Bill and that you’re in love with me. You know, the usual!” You laughed, taking another sip of your drink.</p>
<p>“Y/N…” he whispered, turning in his chair to face you.</p>
<p>“Charlie?”</p>
<p>Charlie didn’t respond. Instead he silently downed his drink and rose to his feet. He held out a hand to you with a smile.</p>
<p>“Dance with me?”</p>
<p>You took his hand and let him lead you to the dance floor. He spun you into his arms and you started to sway gently.</p>
<p>He rested his head against yours and whispered into your ear, “I am.”</p>
<p>“Am what?” You asked, pulling back and looking into his eyes. You needed to hear him say it.</p>
<p>“I am in love with you.”</p>
<p>Before you realised what you were doing, you were kissing him. You gripped onto him with every you had, and he held onto tightly in return.</p>
<p>It was the sound of screaming that eventually made you spring apart, and you both ran over in time to hear Kingsley Shacklebolt’s Patronus say the words –  “They are coming.”</p>
<p>Chaos descended but Charlie didn’t let go of your hand as the two of you ran to join his family.</p>
<p>He didn’t let go of your hand as you watched Hermione and his brother escape with a stranger who Charlie would later tell you was Harry Potter in disguise.</p>
<p>He didn’t let go of your hand as you all took out your wands and prepared to fight.</p>
<p>“Y/N!” Bill shouted over to you, “Will you take Fleur to safety?”</p>
<p>“Bill, no!” Fleur protested, “I want to stay and fight.”</p>
<p>“Fleur, please,” Bill pleaded with his new wife.</p>
<p>Fleur glared at him but decided to abide his wishes. You squeezed Charlie’s hand and finally let go without looking at him. You walked over to Fleur with a sad smile and took her hand in yours.</p>
<p>You looked back at Charlie before you disapparated to Shell Cottage</p>
