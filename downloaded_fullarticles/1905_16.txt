    <p>Hermione couldn’t help but smile at the familiar surroundings. She had never imagined that she would have been away from the Burrow for this long. The hodgepodge of buildings stacked on top of each other was always disconcerting after being around muggle architecture for months, but it evoked more homesickness from her at the moment than anything else. </p><p>“How is that even standing?” Tetsurou was eying the Burrow with incredulity.</p><p>Hermione laughed. “Magic, of course.” She began the long trek up the dirt path, levitating her trunk and Tetsurou’s behind her. “Come on.”</p><p>“Right. Why bother asking.” Hermione felt Tetsurou trudge along behind her. “And I assume they have some of those wards you’re so fond of so that no passersby happens to notice the architectural wonders?”</p><p>“Of course.” Though the home’s structure was hardly the only thing on the property that needed to be kept away from prying eyes. She could make out some of the Weasleys (and most likely Harry) playing Quidditch behind the house.</p><p>Hermione sighed as Tetsurou’s anxiety increased with each step. “You’ll be fine.”</p><p>“Every single one of these people is ridiculously fond of you and far more advanced than me in magic. You can’t prove that.”</p><p>“They would never do anything to hurt you.”</p><p>“I know that, they’ve protected me and healed me and stood by my side when those wizards were after us, it’s just…” Tetsurou trailed off, eyeing the distant figures on the pitch with wariness. Hermione sighed. She doubted Tetsurou was going to calm down around the Weasleys for a while.</p><p>There was some shouting on the pitch and two of the figure began to fly toward them—one with red hair and the other, black.</p><p>“Harry! Ron!” She smiled at the two of them as they landed, both covered in sweat. “Having a good game?”</p><p>“Yeah, though George thanks you for your well-timed arrival.” Ron rolled his eyes, “Harry was about to catch the snitch, and George didn’t want to lose and have to work in the gardens tomorrow.” </p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes, “You could have just caught it before you came to greet me, Harry.”</p><p>“Nah, I was just doing a feint.”</p><p>“You were?” Ron stared incredulously at his friend, “You’re getting too good at those, mate.” </p><p>Harry grinned, then turned to Tetsurou. “Welcome to England, Kuroo-san. We’d love to have you play with us if you want.”</p><p>Tetsurou rubbed the back of his head uneasily, “Maybe later? I’m always up for a game, but I don’t actually know the rules of Quidditch, so…”</p><p>“What?!” Ron stared at him, “But you’ve got the perfect build for a beater.”</p><p>“Thanks?” </p><p>
  <em>He means that as a complement, right?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I assume? It’s Quidditch—that’s just how Ron thinks.</em>
</p><p>“They’re the defensive players. You like that, right?”</p><p>Tetsurou laughed but nodded. “Yeah. At least in volleyball.” </p><p>“The others are cleaning up at the moment—Molly wanted to start lunch as soon as you arrived—so maybe we can explain the rules over lunch and you can join us after?”</p><p>Tetsurou grinned, “That I can do.”</p><p>They began walking up the path again, and Hermione slipped her hand into Tetsurou’s, trying to help him remain calm. She could feel his nerves rolling underneath his skin at the prospect of meeting her adopted magical family, despite the fact that his face remained calm and confident.</p><p>Well, first they would need to take their things up to their rooms. Molly would likely be cooking, and Arthur was probably in the shed, and George and the others still showering or on the pitch, and Percy holed up somewhere with a book. It’s not like Tetsurou would run into them all at once.</p><p>“I assume I’m in Ginny’s room?”</p><p>“Yeah, and Kuroo-san’s with Charlie. Mum figured he’d be the most comfortable there, since they’ve spent the most time together.”</p><p>“I appreciate that.” Tetsurou stuck close behind her as they walked through the garden, eyeing some of the magical plants warily. There wasn’t anything <em>too</em> dangerous in the Weasley’s garden, but who knew if they had degnomed it since she was last here. </p><p>“Charlie’s coming?”</p><p>“Not till tomorrow night, but he’ll be here all of Sunday, at least.” Ron paused at the doorway, throwing an uncertain look toward Tetsurou. “Well, welcome to the Burrow, Kuroo-san. Try not to get overwhelmed by the chaos.” </p><p>Tetsurou gave him a disgruntled look, “Chaos?” He turned toward her, one eyebrow raised, but Hermione just laughed and tugged him through the doorway. </p><p>
  <em>The Burrow is harmless.</em>
</p><p>The inhabitants, though, not so much. George had been busy. </p><p>There was a “Welcome Kuroo-san” banner hanging from the stairs, and that was possibly the tamest decoration. The second the door shut behind her she felt Harry pull her to the side before there was some sort of blast of air behind her.</p><p>
  Tetsurou immediately started coughing behind her. <em>Chikusho! I suppose this is harmless, love, but chaos is definitely right.</em>
</p><p>Hermione turned around, then promptly burst out laughing.</p><p>Tetsurou was covered in red, gold, and black glitter from head to toe. There was smoke circling around him, tiny cats and dragons chasing each other in the fumes. </p><p>“What the heck.”                                                                                                                                                      </p><p>“Welcome to the Burrow, mate.” George’s head popped over the stairwell above. “I would’ve given ‘Mione a welcome back treatment, but she would’ve killed me, so instead you’ll just have to shoulder double the burden.” George’s grin was dangerous.</p><p>Tetsurou’s eyes widened and he quickly jumped to the side as George upended a potion over the rail. His dodge was successful, but the sludge was apparently mobile and rather quick. It latched onto his leg, crawling up his torso as Tetsurou tried to shake it off, performing a lovely dance for his amused audience. </p><p>Undeterred, the sludge kept climbing until it reached the top of his head. The sludge let out a sigh of success, then slowly seemed to be absorbed by Tetsurou’s hair, which in turn began to change colors, shifting through a whole rainbow before settling on a bright Weasley red. </p><p>“What did that sludge just do?” Testurou was looking all over himself warily, then patted his head. Harry conjured a mirror. </p><p>Tetsurou squawked, “My hair?” He pulled a few strands down in front of his eyes and groaned in dismay. A flash went off from around the corner. Most likely Ginny taking a picture for posterity’s sake. Hermione sighed. Ginny’d probably set up a sound barrier, too, our Mrs. Weasley would have come running in by now.</p><p>Ron grinned at him, “Welcome to the family. Want me to take your things to your room?”</p><p>Tetsurou warily pulled his suitcase closer to him, “I think I’ll pass on that offer, thanks.”</p><p>“Wise choice.” Hermione grinned at the ridiculous picture her soulmate presented. “Come on, I know where Charlie’s room is.” She looked up at George, “There aren’t any surprises waiting in that room, are there?”</p><p>“You kidding? Charlie would kill me if I damaged his things.”</p><p>“That’s not a no, George.”</p><p>“I guess you’ll just have to find out then, Granger.” His head disappeared. </p><p>She rolled her eyes and turned to Harry and Ron, about to demand to know what they’d done to Charlie’s room, but stopped when she saw Ron’s smug expression and Harry’s eyes widen. </p><p>“Scourgify.”</p><p>An explosion of air rocked her forwards, but Harry quickly steadied her.</p><p>She turned around and sighed. Tetsurou was now buried under a mountain of glitter. “A word of advice, Tetsu. Never try to clean up something caused by George in a conventional manner.”</p><p>His head popped out from underneath the glitter with a scowl. “Noted.” He shook his head violently, scattering the glitter, but not displacing it. “How do I get rid of this, then?”</p><p>Hermione sighed. A banishing spell wouldn’t work, but… she conjured a bucket, then made it bottomless. “Accio glitter.” It didn’t move. She sighed, then transfigured the glitter into colored sand, and tried summoning that. The sand quickly rose and began to spiral into the bucket, slowly revealing Tetsurou’s disheveled figure, which was still covered in glitter.</p><p>Oh well, it was a start. At least the room was clean again. She handed the bucket to Ron, “You’re welcome for cleaning that up before your mother saw.”</p><p>Ron’s eyes widened, “But George did it!” </p><p>“And you knew what Tetsurou was about to do and that it would just make the situation worse. Now, I could either tell Molly, or you could tell me what you did to Charlie’s room.”</p><p>Ron glared at her sullenly, “It’s just a mistletoe spell with a camera, alright? We really didn’t want to risk damaging Charlie’s things.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes, “That’s alright, then.” Hermione levitated her own trunk along with Tetsurou’s, “If you’re leaving something out, I’m telling Molly, though.” She walked toward the stairs and giggled when Tetsurou quickly followed her, sticking right next to her side. </p><p>Ron’s defensive voice called after them, “I’m not!”</p>
