    <p>Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter never seemed to cross paths in the auror department of the Ministry of Magic. They did a few times in Diagon Alley, at Madam Malkins before a Ministry event, and once at a pub that Draco never went to again, but other than that they were always apart. Draco would often catch Potter slipping in and out of his office silently, his face bowed over a folder, or a cup of coffee, or even just his wand.</p><p>They had no reason to talk to each other, and so, they didn’t.</p><p>Draco’s ‘office’ was a cubicle in the center of the auror department. It was a cramped space, with about twenty different desks in groups of four. Draco sat with the interns, even though he was an auror, but he supposed that he didn’t mind so much because it was better than being shoved into a tiny office with another auror who most likely would want nothing more than to see Draco killed. Or worse; fired.</p><p>He would always grab a cup of coffee from the break room before coming to his desk, and his desk-mates would graciously avoid his eye as he sat down and got situated at exactly nine o’ five in the morning. The morning rush of people entering the ministry was something that Draco actively avoided. He would much rather be a little late than have his shoes be stepped on by every passing wizard. It’s not like anyone would notice, anyways.</p><p>“Malfoy.” Draco’s ears rang at the sound of his own name.</p><p>He knew the owner of the voice before he even lifted his eyes from the file on the desk. It was Nora, the Minister's secretary, who always came bearing bad news. </p><p>"The Minister is asking for you." She said, and Draco stood to follow her towards the lifts.</p><p>The Minister rarely called for Draco, but when he did, it was never good. It was never to thank Draco for all the progress he had made on indexing the file room, or doing grammar checks in case files so that the Ministry didn’t appear uneducated when certain files were released to the public. Of course it wasn’t very important work, but it was a lot of work. The work of an intern, not of an Auror.</p><p>He grit his teeth as the secretary opened the Minister’s door. He started to walk in, but froze almost immediately, his heart shuddering to a stop. Harry Potter was standing near the door, heading to make an exit as Minister Carter continued to talk to him. Potter was nodding, but turned his head when the door opened, and his eyes caught on Draco. Draco held his breath, and wasn’t exactly sure what his face was doing, but Potter looked away a moment later and nodded toward the Minister.</p><p>“Alright, I got it.” Potter said, and then all eyes were on Draco. “I’ll get started on it now.” Potter muttered, and slid out the door past Draco without another word.</p><p>The secretary shut the door as Draco walked in and took a seat. Carter was still standing from when he had been talking to Potter.</p><p>“This won’t take long.” He said, pulling a file from the tall book shelf behind his desk. It wasn’t until he picked up an empty file box that Draco realized what was happening. He was being fired.</p><p>Draco sighed and pressed his lips together as he stared down at the box, not all that surprised. He knew that he would be fired one day, and figured that he had been working here for quite a while anyways. He did, however, wonder what it was that caused his termination. Maybe those 5 minutes in the morning really did matter.</p><p>“You’re being moved.” Carter said, finally.</p><p>“Moved? To what department?” He asked, though he was happy that he was not being fired altogether, there wasn’t another section of the Ministry of Magic that he would have liked to work.</p><p>“Same department, different office.” Carter said, scratching a signature on the bottom of a piece of parchment.</p><p>“Office?” Draco asked.</p><p>“Auror Potter is without a partner. I’m assigning you to fill that roll.” He said, turning to fit the file back on his bookshelf.</p><p>“Harry Potter?” Draco questioned.</p><p>“Of course bloody Harry Potter, who else?” Carter snapped, picking up the empty file box as he rounded his desk toward Draco.</p><p>Draco stood, taking the box as Carter shoved it against his chest.</p><p>“Assignment starts today. Dismissed.” He said, and sat behind his desk again.</p><p>Draco let his feet carry him all the way to the lifts, and he stood there staring at the grated door as it took him back to the auror department. When the grate slid open, he walked to his desk slowly. His desk mates’ eyes lingered on the box in his hands, and then went up to his face.</p><p>“Fired?” One of them questioned quietly as Draco began packing up his desk.</p><p>“Reassigned.” Draco responded with the shake of his head.</p><p>None of them answered, but simply watched as he packed up the simple decorations that littered his desk. Then, once everything was in the box, he picked it up and turned, facing Harry Potter’s office.</p><p>He took a deep breath and approached the black, wooden door, tucking his box under one arm as he knocked. It seemed to echo throughout the room, and his neck prickled with all of the eyes that he felt watching him. He didn’t think that he could breathe if he wanted too.</p><p>After knocking a third time, he resolved to the fact that Potter was not in his office. He didn’t think that he would be able to again face the room of stilled interns that were all watching him, so he instead pushed through the door, and shut it behind him.</p><p>Slowly, he walked into the room, and out of the small alcove in which the entrance door sat. There was a narrow aisle between the backs of two desks, one desk small and pale brown, the other large, oaky and dark. He assumed, of course, that his would be the small pale one, but had nowhere to set his box, for the surface of the desk was covered with parchment, quills, and a half drank cup of coffee.</p><p>He considered resting the box on Potter’s desk, and went to stand by it, but his arms refused to put the box down. Instead, he stood there, alone in Potter’s office, fingers tingling with anticipation.</p><p>He supposed that there really wouldn’t be much point in setting this box down or unpacking because Potter was sure to kick him out the moment he heard the news. And so, Draco continued to stand, his box in his arms, next to Potter’s desk.</p><p>He flinched as the door opened, and Potter came in, biting into an apple. The ache in his arms and legs disappeared as Potter’s eyes found him, hanging his robes on the hook next to the door. Potter cleared his throat, and then rounded the small wooden desk that was adjacent to Draco, sitting down before pulling a folder towards himself and flipping it open.</p><p>“They assigned me as your partner.” Draco announced, the crunch of Potter’s next bite nearly overpowering his voice. He cleared his throat.</p><p>Potter looked up at him, chewing slowly as he observed Draco.</p><p>Draco didn’t know what he was expecting; maybe that Potter would grab him by the back of his robes, haul him into the hallway and slam the door. Maybe that Potter would just light him on fire and spare them both the trouble of this terrible situation.</p><p>“I know.” Potter said, finally.</p><p>“You know?” Draco asked, confused.</p><p>“Yes. That’s why there’s a desk there. For you.” Potter muttered, tossing his apple core into the bin.</p><p>“This is mine?” Draco asked, looking down at the shiny black surface, having been so certain that this was Potter’s desk.</p><p>“Yes.” Potter replied, looking back down at his file.</p><p>Draco continued to stand there, completely still. He found it impossible to believe that Potter was not causing an uproar. That he was not marching them both to Carter’s office right that very moment. Potter did not look at him as Draco set his box on the shiny black surface of his desk. He did not look at him as he unloaded the picture of his mother, his coffee mug, or his quill set.</p><p>“Why is this my desk?” Draco asked, before he realized he was even asking the question.</p><p>Potter looked at him, and then down at the desk.</p><p>“Do you not like it?”</p><p>“It’s just that mine is bigger than yours.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“So, doesn’t that bother you?”</p><p>“No. It’s just a desk, Malfoy.”</p><p>“But it’s your office.”</p><p>“Our office.” Potter corrected.</p><p>Draco hesitated, not as sure of that as Potter sounded.</p><p>“It just makes more sense that I should get the smaller desk.” He muttered, shrugging.</p><p>Potter looked at him then, hard. An expression that was almost a frown. Then, suddenly, he stood.</p><p>“Fine.” He said, raising both of his hands.</p><p>Abruptly, everything on Potter’s desk flew upwards, hovering in the air around and above Potter’s head. Draco, for a wild moment, thought that all of those belongings would fly at him, and was relieved when they simply continued hovering in the air where Potter left them and walked around his desk, and over to where Draco was standing.</p><p>“Move.” Potter instructed. Not forcefully, but with the tone that made Draco get out of his way as quickly as he could.</p><p>Potter waved his hand and made Draco’s things fly to the desk that Potter had just vacated, landing gently before Potter flipped his hand over and curled his fingers in a beckoning motion. Slowly, all of Potter’s belongings moved forward, pieces of paper and the feathered edge of a quill ghosting the sides of Draco’s face as he watched the belongings move across the room and settle in an organized fashion across the desk surface.</p><p>Then, he sat, and pulled the file back in front of him without another word.</p><p>Draco emptied the rest of his box, straightened everything on his new desk and then sat down. He looked across at Potter, who was still reading, and instantly regretted his decision to make a fuss over the desks. Potter looked intimidating. He felt like he was back at Hogwarts as a first year, and had been called into Dumbledore’s office. Potter seemed to notice that Draco had stopped moving, and looked up at him blankly.</p><p>They held each other’s gaze for a moment, and then seemed to both decide at the same time to look away.</p><p> </p>
