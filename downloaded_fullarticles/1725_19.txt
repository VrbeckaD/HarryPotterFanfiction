    <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">At </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">five</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> years of age, Harry would not say he was lucky, fortunate, or even blessed. His parents died when he was but one year old, killed in a car crash while driving drunk</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">, at least, thats what his relatives told him</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">, he was left in the care of his aunt and uncle, tormented day in and out by his cousin, made to work around the house, cooking and cleaning for his relatives while living in the cupboard under the stairs and barely eating anything more than scraps when they let him or stealing the odd piece of bread when he can get out of the cupboard late at night.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Another reason Harry wouldn't count himself blessed is the fact that he has spent nearly all day running from his cousin and his friends</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> and was now running through a condemned part of the town. Harry had hoped that Dudley would give up the moment they crossed into that part of the town. But no</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> such luck</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">. They were still chasing him down the street and Harry was pretty sure the street they had just entered was the one that had a record of things and people disappearing. Harry's legs were burning as were his lungs and he was sure he was about to collapse. He needed to either lose them or to just give in to his horrible fate. The second option wasn't one he wanted</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> though</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">. What Harry did want was to get away from the life he knows, to find someone who could take him in and give him the love that he sees Dudley getting. Though Harry knows that this is a hopeless wish as the Dursleys are the only family he knows he will ever have. Even though he knows he can't have it Harry can't help but wish for this.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Harry was coming to the end of the street. He had to choose to go either right or left. Dudley's thinner friends were </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">close behind him</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> and if Harry went right there was a chance that Dudley and his larger friends would slam into each other and fall on top of the thinner ones, giv</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">ing</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> Harry some time to get away or at least put some space between him and them. But if he headed left Harry was sure he could find some bushes and trees that would slow them down. Either way Harry would only have a short while before he would have to return home and face his aunt and uncle, who Dudley will most likely tell some made up story to get him in trouble so Harry has to spend most of the summer locked in his cupboard, and it was already the hottest summer on record.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Please, something, take me away from this," Harry whispered between pants</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> for breath</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Harry cried out in surprise as his foot caught on some broken asphalt and he fell forward. Shutting his eyes Harry waited for the impact of his already bruised face to the ground. What he got instead was a feeling like falling down a windy tunnel as lights flashed </span><span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">by </span><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">before his shut eyes before it all just suddenly stopped and his body smacked against something smooth and hard. It was only because of years of conditioning to</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">hard blows from his uncle that Harry didn't black out. He laid there for a moment, knowing getting up and running again wouldn't do him any good. But after a minute of nothing Harry took a chance and opened his eyes.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">He was no long on the condemned street. Instead, he was laying on some kind of smooth stone pathway in some garden with large flowers, fruit trees, and plants he'd never seen before. And when Harry pushed himself up and looked past the plants Harry found himself looking at polished stone walls, large elegant doors, and towers surrounding the garden. Things he'd only ever seen in books while in preschool with Dudley.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"What? Oh no. I'm going to be in so much trouble." Harry breathed as he realized something </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">'</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">strange</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">'</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> had happened to him again. This was going to be wors</span><span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">e</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> than the time he'd found himself on the roof of his school or when his teacher's wig turned blue.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Harry took a few steps towards the close</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">s</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">t door to him and jumped when his foot hit something metallic. Looking down Harry found some kind of metal ball with some engraved markings on it that he'd never seen before. Picking it up Harry turned it over a few times in his hands. There were gaps here and there where Harry could glimpse a crystal of some sorts suspended in the middle of the ball.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"What is this?" Harry asked himself before the crystal lit up. Harry made to drop the ball but found it flew back into his hands a second later. He was scared now. Having no idea just what it was or even what it does and now he was holding it and it didn't seem</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> to be </span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">about to let him drop it.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"What are you doing?" A harsh voice demanded from somewhere behind Harry.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry spun around and found a very tall man walking up to him. From the way that the man was dressed Harry could tell this man was someone important and the look on the man's face was similar to the one that Uncle Vernon would get when Harry would do something that he didn't like.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>The man stopped before Harry and his eyes zeroed in on the ball in Harry's hands. "Where did you get that?" He demanded.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I found it, sir, on the ground," Harry answered quickly. He found that answering his uncle quickly and honestly would at least spare Harry some of the punishment and time locked away in his cupboard.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>The man snatched the ball from Harry's hands before looking him over with a frown. "Wait, you are not of Asgard? What realm do you hail from?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry blinked in confusion. "Realm sir? I'm sorry but I don't understand what you're asking."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">The man seemed not to believe him for a moment before his eyes widen</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">ed</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> slightly. "Midgard? How did you get here?" He asked before glancing at the ball. "What? Is the spell working? But how?"</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I'm sorry sir. The crystal just lit up while I was holding it. I don't know what I did." Harry was staring at his feet, afraid of what the punishment might be for messing with something that is clearly important to the man.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"You? That's impossible. A mortal could not possibly make an Asgardian spell work. Just who are you?" The man demanded.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"My name is Harry Potter sir."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>The man frowned, as the name wasn't familiar to him. "Who are your parents?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry gulped as the man sounded angrier than he was a moment ago. "My parent's names were Lily and James Potter."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>The man sighed in annoyance. Those names weren't any more familiar to him than the boys. Then an idea hit him. "Come with me." He ordered as he took hold of Harry's arm and dragged him through the door he'd come through.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry had to work hard to keep up with the man's stride as the man's legs are much longer than Harry's own. Thankfully the man didn't take him very far before pulling him into a room and towards a large desk.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">The man let</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">go of Harry's arm and began fishing about in the desk after setting the ball down.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Harry just stood where he had been left. Trying not to make things wors</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">e</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> for himself.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"I know I had some parchment." The man </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">muttere</span><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">d to himself before finding what he was looking for. "Now the book. I left it," The man set the rolled up piece of paper on the desk before walking over to a pair of doors.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>When the man opened the doors Harry noticed a large bed covered in green and gold covers. Clearly, this was the man's home and the room he's been brought to must be a study.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>The man entered the bedroom for a moment before returning with a thick book with several marked pages. The book was set on the desk next to the paper before the man opened it to one of the marked pages and begin reading.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Standing slightly on his toes Harry noticed the book was in a text he couldn't read but from the way it was written Harry guessed they were instructions. However when the man pulled out a dagger Harry took a step back in fear.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Simple enough. Just need some blood from you." The man said as he finally looked up at Harry. "I am simply going to cut your finger. A mere drop or two will be more than enough." The man then unrolled the paper, setting some small weights on the corners of the paper to keep it from rolling up again before rounding the desk and holding out his empty hand to Harry. "Now, just give me your hand and we can get this over with."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Though he knew he shouldn't</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> Harry had to know just what was about to happen. "Sir, what are you going to do with my blood?"</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Using this spell I'll be able to learn who your family is</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> and just how it is you were able to make an Asgardian spell work. Your blood will allow my to see your lineage." The man explained.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry hesitated for a moment, not fully understanding what the man was saying before holding out his right hand.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">The man made a small cut on the tip of Harry's pointer and then held the finger over the paper until two drops of Harry's blood landed on it.</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> Harry remained silent through the pain, something the man noticed and filed away for later observation. Though he did see the awed look in the boys eyes when the wound healed up afterwards.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Alright. Just one more thing and I should have the answer." The man lets go of Harry's hand and held his now free hand over the page.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Harry watched as the two drops of blood began moving across the page, creating words and pictures connected like a family tree. One of the pictures was of him with his full name under it, connected to his picture was a woman who he guessed was his mother under his as well as a picture of a man who had to be his father and connected to his mother's picture was</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">...</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"What?" The man asked in shock as he viewed what was on the paper. The blood stopping it's creation of the family tree. There, on the page was his own image and name connected to the woman that was clearly the boy's mother. He was related to the boy. "This can't be. Lilias?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry stared at the man in confusion. Why were this man's picture and name appearing connected to his mother? And why was the name under her Lilias when his mother's name was Lily. At least Harry now had a name for the man. Loki.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">The man, Loki</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> turned to Harry and his eyes took in every detail about the boy next to him. From the thin frame, how he seemed to be </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">sm</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">aller than most children his age, the mop of dark hair on his head, and his green eyes that looked just like Lilias</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">'s did</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">. Loki didn't understand how he had missed it before. The boy was almost the spitting image of himself as a child.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"This woman," Loki pointed to the picture. "is your mother?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry nodded. "Yes, sir."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Loki had been to Midgard only a few times and during one of those times, he had met a woman named </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Alba</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> who he'd taken a liking to. They'd spent only a few nights together before Loki had to return to Asgard. He'd been able to sneak back to Midgard to visit with the woman once and he'd been greeted with the sight of an infant girl in her arms who he was quickly informed was his daughter. But that had been many years ago. Loki had hoped to bring the two to Asgard one day but had not been able to bring them up with his father for fear they would be taken from him as his other children and his past wives had. So he had given </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Alba</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> a ribbon, telling her that a spell connected it to a flower he had in his room. So long as she was alive and healthy the flower would show this. But one day Loki had looked to the flower and found it dead. His </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Alba</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> had died. Loki had asked Heimdall and learned that a fire had killed her and as far as Heimdall had been able to tell the fire had also claimed the life of </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Alba</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">'s daughter.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">But here was Lilias' son, alive and standing before him. And from the way the crystal inside the ball was glowing he possesse</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">d</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> magic.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Loki needed to sit down. The shock of learning his daughter had survived as well as had a child herself was hitting him hard.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Where</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">...</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">where is your mother now?" Loki asked Harry.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"She's dead sir. Died when I was a baby along with my father." Harry answered</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> sadly looking down at his feet</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>His mother had died at about the same age that Lilias had lost her mother. It had to be some cruel joke of the Norns.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"What were you doing before you found yourself here?" Loki asked</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> curiously, and much softer then before</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I was trying to get away from my cousin and his friends," Harry answered.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Cousin? Your mother had a sibling?" Loki asked in confusion. </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Alba</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> had promised him that she would wait for him to bring both her and their daughter to Asgard so that they may live as a family together. And given how short a time there was before </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Alba</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> died it seemed odd that </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Alba</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> would have another child so quickly. Then Loki realized that Lilias had to have been taken in by another family</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> and that that family must've already had a child of their own. "Ah, I see." Loki nodded. He went to ask another question when the door to his study opened and in walked the last person Loki wanted to see. Thor.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Brother!" Thor boomed when he spotted Loki. Thor then took notice of Harry. "What's this brother? Have you found someone interested in learning magic from you?" Thor knew it bothered Loki to no end when he would tease Loki about growing old and becoming an old teacher in the library.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Thor this is not the time. Please leave." Loki growled. Loki tried to </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">hide</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> the paper showing his relation to Harry but Thor had been too quick.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"What are you trying to hide from me?" Thor asked before looking at the paper. It didn't take long before Thor's eyes snapped to Loki. "Brother? Is this true?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Loki sighed. There was no way he would be able to keep this from his parents now. Not that he would be able to hide this from his mother for long anyway. "Yes, Thor. I had a daughter and this boy is my grandson."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry's eyes snapped from Thor to Loki. It was one thing to see it on a piece of paper but to hear it said out loud was shocking. And the man that just entered, Thor had called Loki brother. If Loki truly is his mother's father then that would make Thor Harry's great uncle.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Why did you never speak of this daughter?" Thor asked.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"You know how things often go when I have children. I left my daughter with her mother and thought to find the right time to bring them up to Father. But then </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Alba</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">, the mother of my daughter perished in a fire and I was unable to learn if my daughter survived. Now I know she not only survived and was taken in by another family but that she mothered a son. And now here he is." Loki waved towards Harry.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Have you spoken to Father about this? Or Mother?" Thor asked.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Thor I have barely gotten over the shock of learning this news myself as well as the news that my daughter died some time ago," Loki growled before sighing heavily. "I barely know what to do right now. The last time I had a child father was quick to take them from me. Now I have a grandson. I can only imagine father's reaction to this."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Thor was silent a moment before he smiled. "What if you told mother first?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"What are you suggesting?" Loki asked</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> in a tone that made it clear he thought his brother having an idea was akin to the impossible happening</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Father may try to take your grandchild from you right away. But mother may be able to convince him to let you keep your grandson. If anything</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> she should be able to convince Father to let him stay for a little while. Perhaps long enough for you to get Father to allow him to stay."</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Loki had to admit that this does, in fact, sound like a good idea. If there was one thing they could count on it was that their mother knows just what to say and do when it comes to their father.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Thor I rarely say this, but that is brilliant."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Thor laughed. "As if I am going to let father send away your grandson." Thor then chuckled. "I can not wait to see father's face when he learns he is a great grandfather."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Loki had to chuckle at that as well.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I shall go fetch mother." Thor then turned and ran out of the room.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry wasn't sure just what was going on. So he turned to Loki. "What's going to happen now, sir?"</p>
  <p>Loki raised a brow at Harry still calling him sir. "You don't have to call me that. You can call me Loki if you want. As for what is happening, my brother has gone to get our mother so that she may meet you before you meet our father."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"When can I go home? My aunt and uncle are going to be very mad if I don't get home soon." Harry asked.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Loki frowned at that. "You are worried they will be angry with you? How will they punish you?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Harry shifted a little on his feet. "If I'm lucky</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> they will just lock me in my cupboard for a month."</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Loki's eyes couldn't decide if they wanted to widen in shock or narrow in anger at that. "Lock you in a cupboard? What else could they do to punish you?"</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> he asked remembering how Harry never even so much as flinched when he had sliced the boys palm for the spell.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Sometimes they don't let me eat." Harry didn't want to admit to being beaten sometimes.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Loki could read between the lines. "Who are these relatives that you call aunt and uncle?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"My aunt's name is Petunia and my uncle's name is Vernon</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> Dursley</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">," Harry answered.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Loki made a mental note to pay a visit to these mortals. Not only to collect Harry's things from them but to also repay their kindness. Loki then noticed the glasses Harry wore. "Why are you wearing those?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry touched at his glasses. "They help me see."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"But they're clearly broken. Why haven't you gotten new ones."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry shrugged. "My aunt and uncle don't want to waste money on me."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Loki was liking these relatives less and less.</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> Not to mention thinking of various ways to torture them, or humiliate them, or curse them...</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>The doors to Loki's study opened and in walked Thor with their mother.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Loki smiled</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> grudgingly, after all, she hadn't really shown him much affection in years, more showing it to Thor then him,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> and stood. "Mother." He greeted her.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Loki." She greeted before spotting Harry. "Who is this young man?" She asked as she walked over to Harry with a warm smile.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Well mother, may I introduce you to your great grandson," Loki answered</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> with a smirk</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Her eyes widen at that. "Loki, why did you keep this from us?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"I had thought my daughter had died alongside her mother. I had no idea that she had lived</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> let alone grew up and had a child of her own. At least not until he stumbled upon a hidden path that seems to lead to my private garden." Loki answered.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"What is your name?" She asked Harry.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Harry Potter ma'am," Harry answered.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>She smiled. "My, such a polite young man. You may call me grandma Frigga."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Mother, I am weary of bringing him before the father. Do you think you could help me break this to him?" Loki asked.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Frigga smiled at him. "I will do what I can to help."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Brother while you and mother speak to father</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> why don't I take young Harry and keep him entertained until you are ready to show him to Father." Thor offered.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Loki wasn't sure about that but figured it would be best if Harry </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">was </span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">kept away from the throne room until they could be sure that the Allfather won't do anything to harm him. "Very well Thor. Harry, I want you to stay with Thor until I send for you."</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Harry hesitated. He really needed to get home to his aunt and uncle before he ends up in more trouble than he</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> probably was </span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">already. But if these people really are some lost members of his family then this could be his chance at a better life.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"When we have finished I will take you to your relatives to collect your things." In Loki's mind, he was keeping his grandson no matter what his father says.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Okay." Harry agreed</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> awkwardly, his hopes not being too high, as others had told him they would help him in the past, with nothing coming of it</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Come then. I'm sure we can find something to keep us entertained until my brother summons us." Thor threw his arm around Harry's shoulder and lead him out of the study.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Loki watched them leave. He was scared for how Asgard would react to his grandson, how Harry will take to Asgard, and most of all how his father is going to react to Harry.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Come Loki. We best go see your father while he is alone." Frigga said, drawing Loki from his thoughts.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Loki nodded. No point in worrying about this when he needs to go and speak with his father now.</p>

  <p>
    <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Odin listened as Loki explained the family he'd had on Midgard as well as how his grandson had just arrived in Asgard. He was angry that Loki had kept this hidden from him for so long as well as curious at how Loki's daughter was kept hidden from him as well as the daughter's son. He would have to look into this.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Where is this child now."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Loki had to hold his hands behind his back as they started to shake. Odin was always a hard person to read and this was a very important matter to Loki.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"He is with Thor right now. I've seen him. Such a polite boy</span><span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> and he remind</span><span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">s</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> me so much of Loki at that age." Frigga chimed in.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Odin needed to think about this. Every other time Loki has had children they have been monsters. But as he'd heard nothing about this daughter she must have turned out normal. And from the sounds of things Loki's grandson must be normal as well. But he would have to wait until he sees him be sure.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"What is the boy's name?" Odin asked.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"His mother named him Harrison. A mortal name as she did not know who her birth father was." Loki answered.</p>

  <p><br/> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Thor had taken Harry to the training field to watch his friends spar. They'd been able to watch for a while in peace before Thor's friends spotted him and came over. Thor was quick to introduce Harry to them, not for a moment hesitating to tell them that Harry is Loki's </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">student</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">.</span></p>
</div><div class="">

Fandral asked in shock.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"You are sure about this?" Sif asked.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Thor nodded. "My brother </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">did not explain his reasoing to me</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">."</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Well, this is quite the surprise," Volstagg said. He, like the others, was confused as to how Loki could have a</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> student and keep it a secret till now</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">. At least the boy looked normal.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Where have you been hiding child?" Fandral asked, doing his best to seem friendly.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I haven't been hiding sir," Harry said.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Thor chuckled at the looks of surprise on the faces of his friends at Harry's manners.</p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>"How old are you Harry?" Volstagg asked.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Fi</span><span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">ve</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">, sir," Harry answered.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"A fine age. Old enough to learn to use a sword." Sif commented before going over to where they keep the training blades.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry stared at her for a moment. "A sword? Why did she say that?" He asked Thor.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Most boys begin their training at the age you are now," Thor explained.</p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>"I'm not sure why you would want to learn magic from Loki. I am sure your family would be more please to see their son a great warrior standing next to Thor in battle." Fandral added.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Harry wasn't sure about this. He'd never held anything sharper than a kitchen knife and nothing heavier than a bag of potatoes. He also didn't understand just what Fandral had meant by that. Was something wrong with learning from Loki? And what was so special about being a warrior? Was it like being good at sports? Also when Fandral had spoke of magic all Harry could hear was his uncle telling him </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">'T</span><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">here's no such thing as magic!</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">'</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Here we are. This should be a good start for you." Sif said as she returned with a sword and held it out to Harry.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry stared at it for a moment before taking it, the weight almost making him drop it right away.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Thor and his friends chuckled at his struggle</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">s</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I can't lift this," Harry said as he could barely lift the hilt. He went take back what he'd said before he got in trouble with his great uncle when Thor placed a hand on his shoulder.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"In time you will be able to. With training." Thor told him.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I fear training shall have to wait," Fandral said as he pointed to an approaching guard.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"The king summons you and the boy prince Thor." The guard announced.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Sif took back the sword from Harry. "Another time then."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Come Harry. Let us go see father and hear what he has to say." Thor said as he leads Harry away, the guard following behind them.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Well, what do you make of this?" Fandral asked the other three.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Loki with a </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">student</span><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">? You remember how his children were when they were here." Sif said.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"But this boy is different from them. You heard him when he spoke to us, he was polite." Volstagg pointed out. Though he'd only known Harry for a few minutes he found himself liking the young boy.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"That may change over time," Sif commented. "It would be best if we keep an eye on the boy and try to steer him away from Loki. For his own good."</p>

    <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Thor frowned as he looked down at Harry. He had stopped them part way to the throne room and was looking Harry over carefully.</span>

  <p>"This won't do at all." Thor commented with a shake of his head.</p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>Harry tried not to let that worry him. He thought that Thor realized that he wasn't a the kind of family he wanted him to be and that he was about to abandon him in the halls to fend for himself.</p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>"You can not see the Allfather dressed like that." Thor picked at Harry's right sleeve. "What beast wore this horrid thing before you?"</p>
</div><div class="ace-line">

</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Thor raised a brow at that. "I did not know mortals could become so large at such a young age." He then shook his head. "Does not matter.

    <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Harry had not wanted anything fancy. He felt that it would be wrong to accept such things as he had spent most of his life being told he wasn't worth the money. But Thor kept pushing Harry to wear something more befitting his family ties. So Harry accepted the leather toursers and blue tunic that Thor gave him.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>Thor had found it odd that Harry did not want to change into something better then the rags he was already wearing, as well as how Harry agreed to the simplist clothes that they could find. There was nothing about those toursers and tunic that said Harry was royalty or even noble born. But Thor just shrugged it off and helped Harry into a pair of the smallest boots they could find. Even the clothes Harry now wore were very lose on him and it bothered Thor.</p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>"Now then. I believe we kept father waiting long enough." Thor smiled, trying to ignore the nagging feeling that much was wrong with his brother's grandchild.</p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>Harry allowed himself to be lead away from the room. He hoped that Loki wouldn't mind that he changed clothes and that no one got mad at him for it. Sure Thor had been the one to make him change but he was sure someone would get mad at him for it.</p>

  <p><br/> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Harry was scared. More so now than he was when he first found himself in this place.

</div><div class="">
  <p>"So, this is the boy you have told me about. The one you are sure is the child of your lost daughter?" Odin asked Loki.</p>

  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"He is Lilias' daughter. He ha</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">s also</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> proven to me that he has strong magic in his veins." Loki answered.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>That had Odin's full attention, as Loki had not mentioned this before. "Why did you not speak of this before?"</p>

</div><div class="">
  <p>"This child's blood is that of a mortal's. He has no place here. He should be returned to his mortal family." Odin said.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Hearing those words Harry felt his heart drop. He was being sent back to the Dursleys. He would have to continue to live with them. No. This couldn't be happening. He couldn't go back to find this lost piece of his family. Before he knows what he was doing Harry spoke.</p>
</div><div class="">

</div><div class="">
  <p>"What was that Harry?" Frigga asked.</p>

  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Because I would be happier with my mother and father then I would be with them," Harry answered</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> honestly, though with sadness too</span><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">.</span></p>

  <p>Loki couldn't believe what he was hearing. That there were people out there, on Midgard no less who could treat a child, a relative no less like that.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Father I beg you not to send him back. Whoever these people are that he must call family are monsters and have no right to have children in their home. We can not let him return to those people," Loki begged.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I agree my love. To said him back to that home would be a fate worst than death." Frigga agreed. She could only imagine the pain and suffering Harry had to have gone through while living with those relatives.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Father you can't send him back." Thor cried.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Enough!" Odin shouted, making everyone in the room shut up. Odin wasn't completely heartless. At first, he had questioned if Harry was telling the truth about what happens to him with his relatives. But those doubts didn't stay long as the look in Harry's eyes told him more than anything else that what he was hearing was true. This does change things. But this made things difficult for Odin. As every time Loki</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> has</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> had children problems would arise and before long he would have little choice but to cast them out as they would not listen</span><span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> and do as they were told by him. But would it be the same for Loki's grandchild? Would the same problems arise? Would this boy, who seemed so quiet and polite become like his cousins?

</div><div class="">
  <p>"I can stay?" Harry asked, unable to believe his change of luck.</p>

  <p><br/> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Loki had been shocked with how little Harry ate once the food had been set before them. But Loki had said nothing. He had more important things to think about. Like dealing with these relatives of Harry's. Loki had made sure to study up on some simple curses that would serve to punish them without getting into trouble with his father. At least he had his father's permission to go to Midgard and collect Harry's things. And so both Harry and Loki were currently walking down the street that Harry ha</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">d</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> called his for the last several years of his life. Loki was dressed in what Harry had called a business suit.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>According to Harry his uncle Vernon would think that Loki was someone of wealth, power, and upbringing. The sort of man that his uncle wants to deal with.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Loki was pleased to hear these clothes said such things about himself. For it is the sort of man that he is.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Now Harry, when we meet your uncle say nothing. I will get us inside and you will slip away to collect your things. I shall keep them busy with me. When you are done simply enter the room I am in." Loki instructed.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Okay," Harry whispered as they reached his house. He was so nervous. What if his uncle refused to let Loki in? What if he was unable to collect his things be</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">cause</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> his aunt had dragged him into the kitchen to cook or clean? There were so many things that could go wrong.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>It had to be almost 8:30 at night. His uncle was going to be so angry with him. But at least Loki was there to keep him safe.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Loki knocked on the door and the two waited. It wasn't long before a man larger than Volstagg</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">, and far uglier then a troll,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> appeared in the now opened door. The man was glaring murder at Harry and was just opening his mouth to snap at him when Loki quickly butted in.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Good evening sir. Sorry to trouble you at such a late hour." Loki gave his most charming smile.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry almost smiled at the surprised and stunned look on his uncle's face as he took in Loki's appearance.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Vernon cleared his throat. "Not at all. What brings you to my home at this hour?" Vernon tried to carefully reach out and drag Harry inside the house but Loki stopped him by putting a hand on Harry's shoulder.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I fear I have gotten very lost. I am not used to this area you see. Thankfully I stumbled upon this young boy and he was kind enough to suggest I come here for some rest and help before I head home for the evening to get ready for my meeting in the morning." Loki explained.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Vernon's eyes widen in interest. "Oh? W</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">-w-w</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">hat meeting would that be?"</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry was nervous. Loki wasn't from the same world as him and there for one wrong word could ruin everything.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Foreign affairs. Mostly I help my father with trade negotiations." Loki answered flawlessly.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">It was clear Vernon was very impressed with this. "W</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">-w</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">ell, would you like to come in? I believe my wife is making some tea and I'm sure we can be of help to you." Vernon moved out of the way and held the door open.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Why thank you, sir. I think I shall take up your offer." Loki smiled as he entered the house with Harry. "Charming home you have here." He </span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> <em>really</em> </span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> hated it. Everything about this place offended his sense in every way.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry quickly put distance between himself and his uncle but made sure to do so in a way that wouldn't draw his uncle's attention. He was amazed at his grandfather for coming up with such a convincing lie on the spot.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Please</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> in here," Vernon said as he led the way. "Petunia, we have company."</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> he snapped up the stairs in a bellow.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">A very thin woman</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">, who looked like some mad wizard's cross between a horse and a woman,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> quickly entered the room. When she saw Loki she smiled brightly. "Oh, this is a pleasant surprise. Welcome to our home Mr.</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">..</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">?"</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Odinson. Loki Odinson." Loki answered with his charming smile at full force.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"He handles foreign affairs in his father's company," Vernon told her</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> smugly</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Would it be too much trouble to inquire if I could get something to eat and drink? I have been wondering the streets for hours and have missed my dinner." Loki just needed to keep them busy while Harry gathered his things.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"No trouble at all," Petunia said before returning to the kitchen.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Please sit." Vernon waved over to the couch as he took a seat in a chair. "I'm in the drilling business myself."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Loki just gave a polite nod, not caring or knowing what the man was talking about. Loki said nothing and just nodded from time to time. It was clear to him the best way to keep this man away from Harry was to let him talk about himself</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> like the arrogant fool he was</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">When Petunia came back into the room she had a tray of tea and a plate of sandwiches. She sat on the arm of the chair that Vernon as sitting in. Every</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">now and then she would speak up, either boasting about her husband's work or something that her son had done.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Loki had been shocked to find out that the fat lump of cloth on the floor was a child. He'd been sure that thing had been some ugly toy for dogs. Thankfully Loki had managed to hide his shock</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> with skillful ease</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Vernon began telling some story from work and Loki was ready to call to Harry to hurry up. However just as he was tempted to do so Harry entered the room, with a very tattered bag on his back.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Boy, what do you think you are doing?!" Vernon snapped, then turned a smile to Loki. "Sorry, my nephew gets very confused sometimes. I'll just be a moment." He went to stand up but stopped when Loki stood.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"That will not be needed as I am leaving. And so is Harry." Loki told him with a smirk.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"What?" Vernon asked</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> with all the intelligence of a sloth showing</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">, thinking he had mis</span><span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">h</span><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">eard.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Which one was your mother's sibling?" Loki asked Harry.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Aunt Petunia," Harry answered.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Loki turned to her. "Where you aware that your sister was adopted?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Petunia looked like she'd sucked a lemon at that. "How could I not?" She asked.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry turned to his aunt in shock. "My mother was adopted?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I've no idea why my parents adopted that freak!" Petunia growled.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Freak? I see." Loki nodded. "I had thought I could feel Midgardian magic around this home. A protection spell</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> of some sort</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> I believe</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">, though it feels....weak..</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">."</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"How dare you speak of that in this house! You're one of them aren't you?" Vernon growled.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Oh, I am not part of Midgard's magic users," Loki smirked. "But my magic is strong you fat</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> pathetic</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> mortal." He</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> said, prounocing each word slowly,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> then</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> he</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> turned to Petunia. "And the woman you knew as your sister Lily</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> was my daughter</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> Lilias."</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I want you out of this house this moment!" Vernon roared, he then turned to Harry. "You are going nowhere freak!"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Loki grabbed Vernon around the throat and lifted him</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> with obvious and disconcerting ease</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">. "You will not speak to my grandson like that," Loki warned.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Petunia shrieked and ran to shield Dudley.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"I am Loki, prince of Asgard. And I will not let anyone speak ill of my family." Loki dropped him and headed toward Harry. Under his breath, Loki </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">m</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">uttered several quick curses that were going to ensure that the Dursleys never kn</span><span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">e</span><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">w peace again. One of the curses would even latch onto Vernon's sister the next time she visits. "Is that all you are taking with you?" Loki asked, noticing the bag on Harry's back wasn't all that big.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I don't have a lot of things," Harry explained.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I see. Well, that will change soon enough once we are home." Loki smiled.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"You won't get away with this. Petunia call the police." Vernon ordered.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Police?" Loki asked as he looked to Harry.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"They're law enforcement," Harry answered.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Ah, mortal law enforcement. They will do you no good. As we will both be back in Asgard well before they arrive. Come Harry. Let's get you home."</p>

  </p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Wing?" Harry asked.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Loki turned to him. "Yes, your own wing of the palace. I'll be sure to make sure it's near mine so if you need anything I can be there for you. I should make sure the servants know to keep an eye on you so that they can see to your needs, as you don't ask for anything. And I should see about getting someone to make your clothes soon. As royalty, you can not go around in s</span><span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">imple clothes</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> like those." Loki was talking more to himself now.</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Servants?" Harry had never thought that he would have servants. After all, Harry had spent years being treated like a servant. He really didn't wish that feeling on anyone.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Loki turned to him in confusion for a moment before recalling what Harry had told him his life at the Dursleys' was like. "I assure you the servants here are treated far better than what you had been treated</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> with</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">."</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>That made Harry feel a little better but he was going try to get things for himself rather than make the servants do it.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Loki crossed the room and stuck his head out the door, waving down a passing servant. "Fetch me a tailor. My </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">student</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> needs to be measured for his new wardrobe."</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>The servant bowed and walked off to do as they were told.</p>
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"Now then, once you are measured it should not take long for your new clothes to be made. I would guess by morning at the earliest." Loki told Harry. "Are you hungry? I should have asked for something for you to snack on </span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">to </span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">be brought as well."</span></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I'm fine Loki. I don't need anything to eat." Harry said.</p>

  </p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Fine," Loki answered smiling, his mind on things he felt he needed to do for Harry to make things better for him.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Loki." Frigga could tell he was miles away and was trying to get him to focus.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Loki sighed. "Sorry mother. I find myself unable to think of anything but how to help make Harry more comfortable."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Frigga smiled. She herself had gone through similar moments back when her sons were little. It showed that Loki did care for his grandson.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"He asks for nothing and when he gets anything he said thank you but barely touches it. He ate little when I had food brought to us before we went to get his things. I just don't know what to do. That family seems to have trained him to want nothing and to not accept things. I'm at a loss as to what to do with him." Loki sighed.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"It will take time for him to get used to how different things are here. He is not used to being able to ask for things and have whatever he wishes. Just give him time and enforce that he has the right to ask for things as well as have them." Frigga advised.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"It's just hard to see him looking so unsure when he gets something. And when the tailor came to take his measurements you should have seen how small he was under those horrid rags. I could see almost every bone in his torso. No living creature should ever be that thin."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Frigga nodded. "Yes, it is alarming how thin he is. But I am sure we can fix that in time. But do not try to force him to eat. And if he finds something he likes do not focus on that one thing." Frigga then smiled slightly. "Your father tried that with you when you were younger. Was not long before you grew sick of it.</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> Besides, we will have him see Lady Eir before long.</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">"</span></p>

  <p><span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Loki smiled. "I will not do that, I promise."</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> Happy though he was that Harry would be getting checked over by a professional healer of Asgard eventually, once he was settled in of course.</span></p>

  <p>Harry was sitting on the floor of his room, still reeling from what had happened in the last five hours. He'd been running from his cousin and his friends down the one street no one was supposed to go to, ended up in another world where he found his living grandfather, as well as his great uncle and great grandparents, his grandfather decided he wanted Harry to live with him and his great grandparents agreed to let him stay, he was finally free of the Dursleys and now living in a palace with servants as well as royalty. All of this left his head spinning.</p>

  <p>Sighing Loki carefully lifted Harry off the floor, doing his best not to wake him before setting him on the bed and tucking him in. Loki had taken note of just how skinny Harry really was.</p>

</div><div class="">
  <p>"Those people who had him before. Lilias's adoptive sister. He was never given a proper room and made to sleep in a cupboard. It seems it will take some time to break him of that habit." Loki brushed some of Harry's hair out of his eyes.</p>

    <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">Albus Dumbledore was not having a good day. The bowl of lemon drops he keeps on his desk had tipped over along with his glass of pumpkin juice, causing them to get all sticky and covered in fluff. He'd had a surge of letters from the ministry asking for his help with all kinds of matters on top of a few complaint letters from pure blood families demanding Muggle-born and half-blood students are made to stay in different dorms from the pure blooded ones. Also, he had lost three pairs of his best socks. And that was just that morning.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Then came the truly horrifying news. Arabella Figg had just reported in that the Dursleys had just announced that they would no longer need her to look after Harry as he no longer lived with them.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban">The agent Dumbledore had sent to check in on the family had confirmed that Harry was gone</span> <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">,</span> <span class="author-g-90gklbxz122zgjv0tban"> and that the wards around the home where still in place.

</div><div class="">
  <p>"I must find him and make sure he is safe," Dumbledore told himself. He also had to find out how the Dursleys could've just let someone walk off with Harry. He'd been clear in his letter that they were to let him live there until he turned 17. At that point, Dumbledore would have something else set up for Harry. But all of that would be for nothing if he couldn't find Harry.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Is it true?" Snape asked as he exited the fireplace after flooing over. "Lily's son has gone missing?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I'm afraid so. I plan to go over there myself and speak with them about this." Dumbledore answered.</p>
  <p>"How could you allow this to happen?" Snape demanded.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I promise you, Severus, I will find him." Dumbledore stood, transfigured his robes into something more suitable for Muggle homes, sent a quick summons to the closet Order member to join him and then flooed with Snape to Arabella's house.</p>
