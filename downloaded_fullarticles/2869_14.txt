    <p>It’s been three hours since Newt set foot in New York for the second time in his life and he’s already in trouble.</p><p>At least Theseus is not here to watch him, he’d probably had an aneurysm just to see Newt standing in front of a hurt and very angry hippogriff.</p><p>He hasn’t had the time to attend to the creature, he just stunned two wizards that tried to kill him. They’re both alphas; they attempted to use the Voice on him, but Newt is -fortunately- not like most of omegas and has an overprotective brother that taught him how to resist an alpha’s command.</p><p>And Newt took advantage of their atonishment and stunned them both.</p><p>He turns around to face the hippogriff; the creature is clearly upset and is thinking about flying away through a window, judging by her unsteady and nervous movement of her wings. But the space is too small for her to fit and Newt knows she’d only end up more hurt than she already is.</p><p>Downstairs, Newt hears someone yelling that the ‘aurors are here’ and he feels a little bit relieved; at least they can take care of the traffickers while Newt tries to patch the hippogriff up.</p><p>Unless said aurors try to take the creature away in which Newt would have to think a way of escaping from them with the hippogriff.</p><p>Which is going to be a problem.</p><p>He hopes Tina’s among them so at least he doesn’t have to explain them he knows what he’s doing.</p><p>‘You’d never get a good alpha with that attitude, my son,’ Newt bites his lip, remembering his mother’s words. She had always been so concerned about him not getting married, especially because she soon realized his son was far from what the British society would call a “proper omega.” However -and much to her concern- Newt had never been much interested in getting an alpha to court him.</p><p>Neither Theseus; he turned to be a very overprotective brother that contrary to what their mother used to think, was happy if Newt never got an alpha.</p><p>'Nobody deserves you, little one’ Theseus usually says to which Newt just rolls his eyes.</p><p>Despite of his overprotective nature, Newt likes his brother; he was the only alpha in his family that supported him when he announced he wanted to be a magizoologist.</p><p>Yes, he worries a lot and has a heart attack when Newt comes to visit him and tells him about his adventures, but he has never stopped him.</p><p>Newt has met alphas and has tried to chat with them, but as soon as he mentions his job they all frown at him in disapproval.</p><p>So he has decided to give up on that. He doesn’t need an alpha anyway.</p><p>The room is dark, but Newt doesn’t surrender to the temptation to use Lumos Maxima, the bright light would only startle the creature even more.</p><p>He hears footsteps and curses when the hippogriff does a distressed noise behind him; he knows is not very clever to turn his back on a upset creature, she could attack him at any moment, but he has no other choice.</p><p>The wizard that storms into the room is an alpha and despite the terrible light -and that he cannot see his face- Newt knows he’s an auror just by the way he stands. That man has received military training, just like Theseus.</p><p>“I need you to leave the room,” it’s an order, but at least the alpha has the decency to not use the Voice on him. He thinks he recognizes that voice though. “This creature is dang-”</p><p>Without thinking, Newt moves his own wand and takes away the auror’s one just with a quick spell.</p><p>The man freezes and since Newt still can’t see his face he’s not sure if it’s because he’s surprised or furious. Alphas don’t take very well when they’re defeated by omegas.</p><p>“She’s not dangerous, she’s just scared,” Newt corrects him. “Now please let me work. I know what I’m doing.”</p><p>A quick nod is his answer, or at least he hopes it is. He prays Merlin the auror is not just waiting for him to get distracted.</p><p>He turns to the hippogriff and takes a step closer to the creature; she does the same distressed noise than before, except that this time is a clear warning.</p><p>And then Newt notices; the wild, alpha’s scent -that’s something that reminds him the nature, the woods- changes. It becomes stronger, protective.</p><p>Except for his brother (and sometimes Tina), Newt has never experienced the protective nature of an alpha, especially directed towards him.</p><p>“You’re making her nervous,” Newt tells him. “She’s not going to hurt me. Trust me.”</p><p>“Sorry,” the alpha mumbles and Newt hears him taking a few steps back.</p><p>When the scent changes again, Newt is surprised to notice that the alpha actually believes him. He can’t help but smile at the thought.</p><p>“Everything’s going to be fine,” Newt whispers to the hippogriff. He takes another step forward, then stops, looking at her in the eye. He bends, not even blinking despite of her gruff approach.</p><p>Then, when she bows back, Newt relaxes enough to pet her.</p><p>He gets startled when the other wand in his hand flies away towards his true owner.</p><p>Wandless magic, it had never occurred to Newt that the wizard behind him could do such thing.</p><p>He only knows one person capable of doing that.</p><p>The alpha steps into the light and Newt feels horrified to find out that he has just disarmed Percival Graves, the real one.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Graves.” If his mother was alive, she would’ve scolded him for that.</p><p>“You were worried about her,” the alpha says, smiling. “However I need my wand to protect you two while you patch her up.”</p><p>Newt has so many questions, but startled by the sound of fight, he blurts out possibly the useless question that’s roaming in his mind: “How do you know it’s female?”</p><p>She is, but Newt is surprised that Graves knows too.</p><p>“You called her 'she’” the alpha explains. And he surprises Newt again because he’s not used to people actually paying attention to what he says. “You’re Theseus Scamander’s brother, am I right?”</p><p>“Yes,” he nods. Of course, the alpha is being nice to him because of his brother. “I’m Newt.”</p><p>“A pleasure to meet you… Newt.” He offers his hand but the magizoologist doesn’t have the time to shake it because of the two men that walk into the room.</p><p>Newt thinks about helping Graves, but it’s more than clear that the alpha doesn’t need any help.</p><p>Feeling oddly protected, Newt starts checking on the hippogriff. He starts whispering a few healing spells while he pets the creature.</p><p>“It’s okay, Clara. You’ll be much better in the morning,” he promises. He doesn’t even worry when he hears something hitting the floor.</p><p>“You named her,” Graves observes and Newt’s not surprised to see the other two men unconscious on the ground.</p><p>“I name all my creatures,” he says.</p><p>“Of course you do,” Graves smiles again, a gesture that reaches even his eyes.</p><p>Newt gets Clara in the case and returns just to see Graves staring at him.</p><p>The alpha closes his eyes, nostrils flared as he unconsciously leans forward. When he realizes what he’s doing, he stops, looking completely embarrassed.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Newt. I shouldn’t have-”</p><p>“It’s a perfectly normal reaction,” he assures, trying to ease him. And it is, most of alphas do that when they meet an omega.</p><p>“No, it’s… disrespectful. I have never done that… I apologise for my-”</p><p>“I’m not angry, Mr. Graves,” Newt smiles and only then Graves seems to relax.</p><p>“Please, call me Percival.”</p><p>Newt agrees but is interrupted by the auror’s sudden reaction. He steps in front of him, shielding him from the entrance.</p><p>However, the people that walk inside are just aurors.</p><p>“Sir, are you-”</p><p>“Tina!” Newt’s so glad to see a familiar face that he jumps right into her arms.</p><p>“Oh for Mercy Lewis’ sake, what are you doing here?” She demands, but accepts the hug anyways.</p><p>“I didn’t know you were courting someone, Goldstein,” the Director comments, interrupting them.</p><p>Newt blushes at that; he once considered Tina as a potential mate, since she was the most respectful alpha he had ever met. But it was more than clear that the two of them didn’t feel anything more than friendship for each other.</p><p>“We’re just friends, Sir,” she says, glancing at her boss in a funny way.</p><p>Newt nods as they both step away.</p>

        <p>“You know you have to accompany us to meet with Madam President…” The Director says and Newt panics for a moment.</p>
        <p>“I could just go, you know?” He says. “Clara didn’t do anything and I-”</p>
        <p>“We’re not going to take her away,” Percival swears. “I promise no harm will come to you or your creatures while I’m alive, Newt.”</p>
        <p>Some of the aurors gasp at the words, but Newt is not paying much attention to them. He’s too grateful for that.</p>
        <p>Coming from another alpha, that protectiveness would’ve seemed weird but Newt knows Percival’s doing it because he’s Theseus brother.</p>
        <p>“Thank you,” he whispers in return.</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>“You won’t be needed this time, Goldstein,” Percival says and Newt already misses his friend when he walks in Picquery’s office.</p>
        <p>“Queenie and I will be waiting for you at home,” she mumbles before fleeing from the room.</p>
        <p>“Glad to see you again, Mr. Scamander,” the President smirks at him. Newt had been taught that the most intimidating wizards and witches were the alphas and for years he believed that.</p>
        <p>Not anymore. Because Seraphina Picquery, a beta, is more intimidating than most of the alphas he has met.</p>
        <p>“Me, too,” he mumbles, noticing Percival gaze on him.</p>
        <p>“Well… tell me, what happened this time?”</p>
        <p>Knowing it will do no good to start babbling, he tries to explain that he had come to visit his friends and begin writing his second book when upon arriving New York, he noticed a man walking towards a pub, carrying something in his pocket.</p>
        <p>He managed to get the man to give him the egg (it was an occamy) and tell him all the information he knew about the hippogriff his companions had caught.</p>
        <p>But then, when Newt reaches the part where he found the place the creature was being kept and his encounter with Percival… he hesitates.</p>
        <p>“He disarmed me,” Percival continues for him, grinning. Newt tilts his head, trying to figure it out if that smile is genuine or if it’s a way to hide his irritation; most of alphas hate to admit defeat.</p>
        <p>Picquery rolls her eyes at the Director.</p>
        <p>“Now that is pretty much obvious, Percival,” she tries to suppress a chuckle. “But I was talking about the case…”</p>
        <p>Then she laughs while Percival glares at her and Newt is not sure if they’re still on the same topic anymore.</p>
        <p>“Very funny, Sera…” He growls.</p>
        <p>Newt looks from one to another and when the President notices she does a gesture with her hand.</p>
        <p>“Sorry, Mr. Scamander, please continue…”</p>
        <p>He does, pretending nothing happened, feeling a little more confident when he talks about Clara and how well the healing spells worked on her.</p>
        <p>“Well… it was not that bad,” Picquery says. “Just be careful next time, Mr. Scamander. You are dismissed.”</p>
        <p>Not quite believing his luck, Newt thanks them both and is ready to run when Percival’s words stop him.</p>
        <p>“You have a place to stay, Newt?” Percival takes a step closer. “You could stay at mine. My house is…”</p>
        <p>He interrupts himself, probably figuring out how that sounds. Even Newt knows when a single alpha that lives alone offers an omega his home has a completely different meaning.</p>
        <p>Although Newt knows he doesn’t mean anything by it; he’s just probably being kind because his Theseus’ friend.</p>
        <p>“You’re moving too fast, don’t you think, Percival?” Picquery comments, however it looks like she’s just having fun.</p>
        <p>“I’m sorry, Newt. I didn’t mean-”</p>
        <p>“Don’t worry. I’m gonna stay with Tina and Queenie.”</p>
        <p>“Oh… great. Well… I’ve heard them say they cannot apparate there because there are many no-majes living in that building.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, but it’s-”</p>
        <p>“I can walk you there.”</p>
        <p>“It’s not necessary, I already know the way, besides, it’s not far from here,” Newt points out.</p>
        <p>“I’m aware you know the way,” Percival comments, rolling his eyes, although he looks amused.</p>
        <p>“Then why you want to walk me there?”</p>
        <p>Picquery snorts and Newt notices that she’s covering her mouth.</p>
        <p>“To keep you company,” Percival says simply and Newt’s still not sure what to make of his attitude. “And to talk about Clara, of course. I’d love to know how you got her to trust you.”</p>
        <p>“Okay!” He agrees immediately this time; he likes to talk about his creatures and Percival has proved to be really interested in what he has to say.</p>
