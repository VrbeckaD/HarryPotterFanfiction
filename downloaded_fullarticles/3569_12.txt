    <p>The Duke of Rain was waiting in the living room. Screams of pain could be heard, but this wasn’t the first time, but it would be the last. His wife had struggled with this pregnancy unlike with his first three daughters. Even though he wished for a son, he was happy with his three, soon-to-be four, daughters. Each child was precious to him and his wife, though when his wife showed difficultly with the pregnancy they immediately sought for a doctor. His wife had always had a health issue, but now it would truly be an issue everyday. But she was happy with her family. The Duke agreed with his wife, but that didn’t mean he worried any less.  </p><p>A baby’s cry filled the air. The Duke stood up and walked to the bedroom they shared. More screams took over the house. The Duke paused and blinked in confusion. That hadn’t happened before. When his eldest girls were born the screams stopped after the birth. His eyes widened in fear, could this a complication due to his wife’s health?</p><p>The Duke ran to the room, and opened the door just as he heard a second cry of a baby. With the door opened he saw his exhausted wife and ….. two babies.</p>
