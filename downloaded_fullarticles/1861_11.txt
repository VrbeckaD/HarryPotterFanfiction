          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our tale starts in The Transfiguration Courtyard on a sunny summer's day. Teddy Lupin and his girlfriend Victoire Weasley are planning a prank.</p><p>Victoire asked, "Can you turn into Headmistress McGonagall?"</p><p>Teddy grinned. "Sure, Vic. What do you have in mind?"</p><p>Victoire said, "Awesome, we can make her give loads of points to Hufflepuff and take lots from Slytherin."</p><p>Teddy smirked. "You're no fun, we can do something better than that."</p><p>Victoire smiled. "Ok, Ted; how about we have a very strange conversation with a Professor?"</p><p>Teddy inquired, "How strange are we talking?"</p><p>Victoire told him, "Extremely strange. Go to Professor Silverton's office and ask him why his Boggart is a Niffler."</p><p>Teddy beamed, "You're cruel, but I love it."</p><p>Victoire made an outfit for Teddy to complete his disguise and they headed to the Defence Against The Dark Arts classroom.</p><p>Victoire stated, "I'll wait out here for you, good luck."</p><p>Teddy promised, "I'll tell you what happened afterwards, Vic."</p><p>Victoire chuckled. "You better after the effort I put into that outfit."</p><p>Teddy knocked on the door to Professor Silverton's office and waited.</p><p>Professor Silverton called out, "Come in!"</p><p>Teddy entered.</p><p>Professor Silverton gasped. "H-Headmistress McGonagall, what are you doing here?"</p><p>Teddy sighed. "It's Minerva to you, Xavier. How many times do I have to tell you?"</p><p>Professor Silverton muttered, "Sorry, I forgot."</p><p>Teddy went on, "I came here about an incident with your third years. I believe they laughed when they discovered that your Boggart is a Niffler. Why might I ask is that your Boggart, Xavier?"</p><p>Professor Silverton assured, "My Boggart is most definitely not a Niffler, Minerva."</p><p>Teddy scowled. "Are you accusing me of lying?"</p><p>Professor Silverton mumbled, "Not at all, but my Boggart isn't a Niffler."</p><p>Teddy queried, "Well, what is it then?"</p><p>Professor Silverton responded, "A baby."</p><p>Teddy stifled a giggle and instead answered, "A baby is a very strange thing for a man of your position to be scared of, Xavier. The rumours must have been wrong, my apologies."</p><p>Professor Silverton explained, "Babies have always terrified me, Minerva. It's their tiny hands and loud screams that set my teeth on edge."</p><p>Teddy said, "Well, we shall keep this between ourselves. I dread to think what your students would think of your Boggart being a baby. Good day, Xavier."</p><p>Teddy left the office.</p><p>Victoire asked, "Well, how did it go?"</p><p>Teddy laughed. "You're not going to believe what his Boggart really is, Vic!"</p></div>
