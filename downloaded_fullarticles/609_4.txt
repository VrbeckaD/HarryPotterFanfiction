    <p>Hey guys! I was rereading this and realized I only really like the concept of the first chapter. I will be mainly keeping that, but I think I’m going to lengthen it. The plot line is changing a lot but my overall plot diagram I drew out when I first began writing this is staying mostly the same. I started writing this book I think around Christmas or something like that my Sophomore year when I was a lot more devote to it and had more time on my hands. Because I’m taking many APs and Duel Enrollments my schedule is pretty packed, but I’m going to write this as a sort of stress relief. One good thing about it being a year is my writing style has changed a little and I realize how rushed the original draft was. I’m only keeping up the first chapter right now because it will be the least changed of the bunch.</p>
