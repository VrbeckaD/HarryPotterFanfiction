    <p>     Newt was not quite sure what to make of the creature in front of him.For though it wore the face of a <br/>man there was no mistaking the way it carried itself. The predatory aura which paralyzed all who were caught in it. <br/>Newt was no exception of this fact, caught in an invisible field of pure predatory intent. The beast that wore the<br/>façade of a man slowly quirked its mouth. Nostrils flawing slightly as it caught a scent only it could smell.<br/>A deep rumbling laugh filled Newt with a heavy feeling as the fantastical creature lifted its hand and stroked a curl <br/>out of Newts face.</p><p> ~“You may call me Percival, Mr. Scamander”</p>
