    <p>James ignored his rival's knife and lunged, tackling the dark hair teen to the ground. “ You fucked up, Black. “ he hissed. “The deal was going down on my family’s land.” <br/>This was becoming a way to common occasion , The Blacks popping up where they don't belong. And he would teach them a lesson this time. </p>
<p>Sirius retaliated by slamming his head into Potter’s and shoving him off. <br/>“you wish Potter, everyone knows that this street is Black property due to the 15th clause in the 1972 christmas negotiation. Therefore…” </p>
<p>James punched him before he could finish. </p>
<p>It was Sirius’s turn to lunge for the other boy. James had pulled out his own knife as he fell. quickly moving it to slash wildly at The Black Heir. </p>
<p>After a pause, Sirius sat back and made a mournful noise, that he would never admit too. “You cut my hair. “ </p>
<p>James pushed himself up on his elbow and stared at the teen in disbelief. “Well I was aiming for yours stupid face. “</p>
<p>Sirius stared back in outrage.”Excuse you. My face is a glorious perfection and my hair was a gift from god. /was/ Potter. Because you ruined it. “ </p>
<p>James found himself fighting laughter. How was this actually happening. “Well I think it is an improvement. “</p>
<p>Sirius looked James up and down in a judging manner. “Thats obviously an insult to your tastes. But I'm not surprised due to the state of your hair. “ </p>
<p>James sat up all the way to defend his hair with just as much outrage as Black. “My hair is artfully tossed and the girls love it!”  </p>
<p>For a moment they both stared at each other before laughing. <br/>“Want to get a drink?” James offered, when they had both gotten their breath back. </p>
<p>Sirius slipped back into his almost constant mask of haughtiness. “Our family would be displeased. “ He said carefully, thinking about how his mother would react if she found out. </p>
<p>“Nah. Dad will find it funny and he still gets drinks with your head of house. “  James said casually while standing. After a moment of silence, James held his hand out to sirius. “Let's call a truce black and get a drink. “ </p>
<p>A reckless feeling filled the boy still on the ground. He was already going to be in trouble with his family so why the hell not. Mind made up he clasped the offered hand and got up. “Sirius. if were getting drinks like friends. Then you can have the privilege of calling me Sirius. “ </p>
<p>James grinned at him. “James. Now. Are we going to one of yours or one of mine?”</p>
