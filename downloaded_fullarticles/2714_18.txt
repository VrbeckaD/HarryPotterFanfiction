    <p>If there hadn’t been a drunk bum in his apparition spot, Draco would have been punctual for his appointment. He’d showered, arranged his hair into the sleeky do he’d used to wear when he’d been young and stupid and utterly unfashionable, had dragged his last good dress shirt from the bottomless depths of his wardrobe, had argued with Filch and promised to talk to him later, then rushed out of the cottage. Only to find his Apparition spot occupied by Blergh.</p><p>Blergh, named after the only sound he ever utters, is the sole bum in the neighbourhood, usually very friendly and not too stinky, but right now someone has obviously given him enough money to get sloshed, and for all Draco knows he might as well have died right there.</p><p>“Why today,” Draco laments, kicking Blergh’s leg with his expensive loafers. “Blergh, please! I have to use this spot for… for… an alien abduction for fuck’s sake!” Blergh doesn’t move a muscle, and Draco curses. He cannot Apparate while Blergh is still in the alley, Statute of Secrecy crap.</p><p>“Blergh,” Draco pleads, “I’ll give you money! Here, ten pounds. Oh come on!” No reaction. Okay, maybe a different approach. “Oh Bleeergh,” Draco drawls as seductively as he can while crouching down, shaking Blergh’s dirt-caked shoulder. “Do you want sex? If you could just follow me around the corner, we can talk about it!”</p><p>Blergh opens a bloodshot eye, slumping an uncoordinated hand against Draco’s chest and sending him flying backwards onto his arse. Brilliant. Now there’s a disgusting smear of Merlin-knows-what down the front of Draco’s shirt and his trousers have a large tear. Fucking brilliant.</p><p>And today of all days, the day that should be the watershed in Draco’s life… Mumbling expletives under his breath he gets up, patting his trousers and shirt down as best as he can. Ten minutes later he lures Blergh away with an opened can of beer.</p><p>***</p><p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Malfoy, but your appointment was at eleven o’clock.”</p><p>The secretary fixes him with a cold, pitiless glare. He knows her from somewhere, Hogwarts probably. Her name tag says ‘Romy’, which he definitely isn’t familiar with. Her icy stare wanders from his hair, sticking up in all directions by now, to his flushed, sweaty face, to his dirt-smeared shirt and ripped trousers. Draco smiles, his usual, charming I-get-everything-I-want-smile.</p><p>“I’m only ten minutes late. Please?”</p><p>“And those ten minutes was all the time Mr. Potter had appointed for your meeting. I’m sorry, Mr. Malfoy, but you missed your chance.”</p><p>No. Fucking no. He needs this, this is his only chance to really make a go of it. And he won’t get a second chance, Potter is only seeing him to do Ginevra a favour. Deflating a little Draco heaves a sigh - and races past the surprised woman’s desk, straight down the corridor. He sees the name on the door - Mr. H.J. Potter - and rips it open, slithers in and stops precisely just in time to not crash into a huge mahogany desk.</p><p>There’s not much on the shiny, polished wooden surface, a landline Muggle phone, a Muggle laptop, a newspaper looking suspiciously like the Quibbler, and one of these click-clack-ball office thingies. But right now Draco isn’t really interested in interior design - all his attention is fixed on the man in the chair with his back to Draco, talking on a cellphone.</p><p>Strong, brown fingers hold it to a head full of fashionably tousled black hair. Draco takes a deep breath, studying the broad back, clad in an expensive, italian suit. Fitted, Draco notices immediately, and with no small surge of envy. There’s a platin watch wrapped around his wrist, his ring finger is adorned by a Quidditch Championship ring. All of it practically <em> reeks </em> of money.</p><p>Now the secretary enters the room too, slightly out of breath. “I’m so sorry, Harry, he just ran past me.”</p><p>The cell closes with a snap, the chair swivels around - and Draco looks into the familiar green eyes for the first time in thirteen years. The gaze is sharp and clear and somewhat amused. Gone are the idiot spectacles, gone is the shaggy, unruly hair, gone is Draco’s peace of mind. Potter smiles, showing strong white teeth, but it’s not a nice smile, and Draco flinches back as if boxed in the stomach. Fuck.</p><p>“Did you tell Mr. Malfoy that I don’t have time for him anymore? He should’ve been punctual.”</p><p>“There was a corpse on my threshold,” Draco lies without hesitation, turning to glare at the secretary before focussing back on Potter. “And I’ll have you know I’m right here, you don’t have to talk about me like that.”</p><p>A barely discernible nod from her boss has the woman leave them, not without sending a last withering glance in Draco’s direction. The door falls shut and an eerie quietness settles over the room as Draco turns back to face Harry Potter.</p><p>“So,” Potter says and leans back in his chair, stretching his arms behind his head. Draco watches, his mouth suddenly a little dry. “What can I do for you, Malfoy?” He grins, and Draco’s hormones roar to life.</p><p>Salazar, not this. Not now. Yes, Potter is hot. Yes, Draco was aware of that before. Yes, he’s seen enough pictures of him in the last decade to know that he’s not the scrawny, badly-dressed midget he used to be in school. But he had been abso-fucking-lutely sure he’d be professional about it. Potter rubs his square, smartly stubbled chin impatiently, clearly waiting for Draco to say something. Draco blinks like a moron, before finally remembering why he’s here after all.</p><p>“I don’t know if you’ve heard about my agency, Potter, it is a--”</p><p>“Medusa’s Magical Marriages, I know.” Potter tsks. “You should change that. It’s horrible.”</p><p>Ginevra had told him to be as aggressive as possible when pursuing Potter. But something about this specific kind of Potter makes Draco feel not aggressive at all, rather like he wants to throw himself down to his knees and just beg Potter to be his client. He doesn’t do it. It’d look… desperate.</p><p>“I know that, thank you, Saint Potter,” Draco sighs instead. “It’s what my Grandma Malfoy named it. It was her agency. I’m going to change it to--”</p><p>“Malfoy Meddles Mightily?” Potter grins, apparently enjoying himself. “Or Draco’s Dirty Dicking Den?”</p><p>“Haha, very funny, Potter,” Draco snarls while feeling his cheeks flush, slamming the folder he’s brought with him on Potter’s desk. On its cover it says, in bold, curvy letters: <em> Vows </em>.</p><p>“Hm, yeah, that’s better,” Potter deigns to remark after studying the folder for a moment. Then he starts leafing through it briefly before carelessly throwing it back onto the desk. “I already have a contract with a marriage agency.”</p><p>“I know,” Draco says eagerly. He’s done his homework. “With…” That one still stings. “With Parkinson’s Perfect For You.”</p><p>“Exactly.” Potter leans forward in his chair and shoves the folder in Draco’s direction. “Seems I won’t need your services today, Malfoy. Or any day. Thank you for coming. Romy will take you out.”</p><p>His finger with a very finely manicured nail hovers over a button on his phone, and Draco’s dream starts to dissolve in front of his eyes. “WAIT,” he shouts, nearly crying with relief when Potter really waits. “I can do better than her, I swear! I can find you the perfect wife, the perfect partner, if you just give me a chance! Come on, Potter,” he wails in a last, desperate attempt. “Where’s your fucking Saviour complex when I need it?”</p><p>Slowly, Potter’s hand moves back until it is lying on the desk. He’s slumping forward until he’s braced on both arms, the seams in his jacket cracking, his gaze piercing Draco until he feels like a butterfly on a needle. After a very, very long examination, Potter nods.</p><p>“Alright. I’ll give you a chance. Tomorrow, eight pm, at the Gilded Swan. Present me with your best offer and we’ll see. She’s got twenty minutes.”</p><p>“Twenty minutes? Isn’t that a little degrading? And you haven’t told me what kind of partner you’re looking for.” Draco produces a quick-quotes-quill and looks at Potter expectantly.</p><p>“Malfoy, I don’t have time for this shit. If you’re good at your job you’ll figure it out. And no, twenty minutes is perfect. The right woman will understand. You know why? Because she’s so bloody gentle and mild-mannered that nothing ever bothers her.” He opens his cell, typing something. Without looking up at Draco he waves towards the door. “Now piss off before I change my mind.”</p><p>“Yes, thank you, thank you!”</p><p>Draco gasps for breath, weak with delight and relief. He’s got a chance! Now the only thing he has to do is not to blow it. On his way out, ignoring the secretary’s sneer, he fishes out his own cell and scrolls through his contacts. And there she is. He calls her from outside of Potter’s office building.</p><p>“Astoria,” he says when her familiar hello chimes in his ear. “I need to ask a favour of you.”</p><p>***</p><p>Satisfied, Draco tucks his phone away in his back pocket - only to pull it out again with a curse. When he looks at the name on the display, the curses get louder and much filthier, to the point that an old Muggle stares at him with a scandalized expression.</p><p>The phone keeps ringing, and for a moment Draco contemplates just dropping it into the Thames. He should never have given her that phone, and he certainly should have never shown her how to use it. He swallows, and snatches it open.</p><p>“Yes, Mother,” he sighs.</p><p>When he’s finally gotten rid of her, Draco flees into the next McDonalds, heading directly for the loo. And nearly gets a heart attack when he looks into the mirror. His shirt is stained with dirt and sweat, hanging limply from his trousers. His hair is indescribable - half of it is still gelled back, the other half has decided to play let’s-defy-gravity on his head. His face - well, better not look too closely at his face.</p><p>Draco washes his hands with cold water, splashing some on his still hot cheeks. First Blergh, then Potter, and now his mother. What a day. It’s barely afternoon. And then the dinner tomorrow. Draco draws a shaky breath. This will either make or break him, and the agency.</p><p>It had been Medusa Malfoy’s little hobby, this marriage agency for all kinds of wizards and witches. And for a pure-blood witch married to a Malfoy, her clientele hadn’t been… distinguished, to put it mildly.</p><p>But she had left it to Draco, a fact he only found out about when he had been forced, due to Father gracing Azkaban with his presence, to take over the correspondence with their family notary. Who had, at one of their horribly strenuous meetings, asked Draco if he ever planned on doing something with the inherited cottage and appendant marriage agency.</p><p>That night Mother and him had had a very serious row. Draco had accused her of lying and keeping things from him, Narcissa had raged against his wacky grandma and her ghastly agency full of old people and squibs and whatnot. Of course he couldn't do it, why would he? He’d better be dealing with the family’s issues and trying to find a nice wizard for himself rather than dabbling in such atrocious, plebeian match-making nonsense.</p><p>Draco had promptly reminded her of his being of age, had stomped out and sent for his stuff the next day. It had taken months until Narcissa grudgingly accepted his choice of trying to make a go of it, and even longer before Lucius, at that time freshly released to the manor for good conduct, had accepted that yes, his only son and heir was continuing his mother’s little pet marriage agency as a fulltime job.</p><p>Now, three months into the game, Narcissa restricts herself to calling twice to three times a week, telling Draco about this guy or that, and did you know that Mrs. Fitzwilliam’s son is single and apparently one of your sort? Well, that and nagging him to give up the agency and come home, seeing as it wasn’t working out anyway. Draco knows she’s only worried about him. But it is his life, and his choices.</p><p>And now he has Potter. His star client. And if he can really do it - find the perfect spouse for Harry Potter, the famous Chosen One, the Saviour of the Wizard World, the former Seeker, now owner of the Twickenham Thestrals - that’ll throw Draco in the path of other rich clients for sure.</p><p>All he has to do is play his cards right. And forget that Potter is a wet dream come true.</p><p>Seriously, couldn’t Draco’s slumbering sex drive have <em> stayed </em> slumbering? Since that fiasco that his last serious relationship had been… he’d rather kept his head low. And now his libido rises like a phoenix from the ashes just because he’s been in the same room as Potter.</p><p>Yay.</p>
