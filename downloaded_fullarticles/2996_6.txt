    <p>Harry was going over a mental check list as he was silently packing up his “things”. In an hour it would be his 17th birthday and he would finally be leaving the Dursley’s house, but not in the capacity that he would like, so to speak.</p><p>Once the clock struck 12, Dumbledore would be sending a few of his blind followers to pick up Harry. Once 12 came around, the non-existent wards would fall. The infamous wards that Dumbledore always used as an excuse, were non-existent they have never existed. Dumbledore just used them as an excuse to keep Harry in one place. </p><p>But unfortunately for him, Harry wasn’t dumb and he knew all about Dumbledore and his machinations. He found out at the end of his Fifth all about Dumbledore and his scheming ways. After receiving his winnings, he hadn’t given it to the Twins as he originally planned on, instead, he decided to take deposit it into his vaults. Even more surprising to him, he managed to make his way to the bank, without any of Dumbledore’s cronies there to stop him. That day had been the day that everything had changed. After meeting with Griphook, Harry had been surprised when he was thoroughly scolded for not responding to the countless missives that the bank had been sending him since fire came into the bank before his first year. After a brief conversation, it was found out that Harry truly didn’t know about any of the missives and that raised suspicion between the two, so much that Chief Ragnok, head of the bank and goblin nation was called into the meeting. </p><p>Once he arrived, Ragnok issued an inheritance test for Harry, that was where all three parties received the shock of their lives in many different ways. After doing the procedure, Harry found out that everything he had been told had been a lie. One, he had more than just his trust vault, in fact he had the entirety of the vast Potter Fortune waiting at his fingertips for when he turned 18, about five billion galleons generated over about a thousands to be exact. Not did he learn that he was fucking rich, he learned that he was a pureblood. Apparently, Lily Evans was actually a pureblooded witch who had somehow ended up in the Muggle world as a baby and although she didn’t come from money or any influence, she was still a pureblood. The greatest shock for him came when he learned that he had been stolen from by the very people who he considered to be his family. The Weasleys, Hermione, Dumbledore, and the Order, they had all somehow managed to funnel funds from his account. Not only that, he was heavily under the influence of compulsion and obedient charms placed by the headmaster himself. </p><p>It was suffice to say that they he was furious and not only the thieves but Gringotts for allowing something like this to happen. So for the first time in a long time, the Chief Ragnok, asked for forgiveness as he sat on his knees in front of a red-faced Harry. Said wizard forgave the bank for its actions after a long five minutes of characteristic begging. Once that was taken care of Ragnok and Griphook quickly sent Harry down to the ritual room so that they could cleanse him of the charms and blocks that was on him. When he was finished, he went back to Griphook’s office where they gave him the Potter heirship ring that he should have been wearing but do to the circumstances hadn’t had the time. After officially becoming Heir Potter, Ragnok composed a list of books that it would be helpful for him to read about Wizarding politics and pureblooded families of England. After that they began to talk about what they were going to do to punish the people who stole from him. Ragnok suggested having them arrested immediately but Harry told them to wait until he knew the full story, but to be on standby for when he told the to recall all of the stolen money. Because, as he was examining the list of people stealing from him, there was one name that he didn’t notice on the paper, a name that gave him a sense of hope. </p><p>That was how he ended up in the Room of Requirement with a the tip of his wand pressed firmly against one Ronald Weasley’s throat. </p><p>“Harry what the fuck” One struggled as his larger body was somehow bound to the wall behind him,</p><p>“How long” Harry growled out. He knew Ron personally wasn’t stealing from him but the rest of his friends were and he wanted to know why. </p><p>“What” Ron struggled through ragged breaths</p><p>“How FUCKING long have you been stealing from me” Harry growled out as he dug his wand deeper into Ron’s throat. At the mention of the stealing, Ron went ramrod stiff. “Exactly, you didn’t think I would notice that you were stealing from me”</p><p>“No, Harry no, I didn’t steal from you” Ron tried as he struggled to get out of the invisible binds. </p><p>“Stop lying to me”</p><p>“No, Harry please, believe me. Just please release me and I’ll tell you everything” Ron tried with a hint of regret in his voice.</p><p>Exahling roughly, Harry undid the binds and walked over tot eh couch that he had asked the room to give him. Ron followed silently behind him and sat on the opposite side of the couch and began to look at Harry. </p><p>With an impatient hand wave, Harry said “Well go on then”</p><p>“Well you see Harry, it was mum. She was the one who agreed to do it. Dumbledore had come to the house before first year and told mum that he had a way for the family to make a ton of money. Mum would follow Dumbledore into the pits of hell so of course she agreed. He wanted me to become friends with you and make you do stupid stuff and he would pay everyone in the family five hundred galleons a month. But I didn’t want to do it. I promise, I told mum that  I wouldn’t do it but she made me. And so I told them I would do it but I refused to take your money, I refused to steal from you. They swore me to secrecy they put me under a vow so that I couldn’t say anything unless you brought it up first something that they said would never happen. Dumbledore planned for you to get in a relationship with Ginny and once you married her, he planned on killing you and he would give mum and Dad half of your money and he would take the other half.” Ron finished</p><p>“So this whole time, you’ve been lying to my about our friendship” Harry asked the red head with a raised eyebrow. He didn’t want to think that the one person who he had considered his best friend was just lying to him. And truth be told, his feelings for Ron had superseded a simple friendship and began to venture into deeper waters. He had begun to develop feelings for the redhead but of course he never acted upon them in fear of how the other would react. Unknown to Harry, Ron felt the same way about the green-eyed wizard. Ron felt immense feelings for Harry but of course he never said anything because that would go against Dumbledore’s plans. </p><p>“No” Ron began to cry. “Harry please believe me. I wanted to tell you, I really did but each time I tried, my throat would close up and physically stop me from saying anything. Harry please, believe me. I never wanted to do anything like this to you. I love you to much for that.” Ron tried </p><p>“Love me?” Harry whispered to himself disbelievingly but apparently it was loud enough for Ron to hear as the redhead responded</p><p>“Yes, Harry, I love you. And I like you more than a friend” Ron whispered the last part shyly</p><p>“What did you say” Harry said</p><p>Sensing that maybe Harry wasn’t mad at him, Ron gained every last ounce of Gryffindor bravery that he had, puffed out his chest and said, “I said that I like you more than a friend” he told Harry</p><p>And within an instant, Ron found his back against the arm of the couch and his arms full of Harry as the green-eyed wizard began to kiss him hungrily. They kissed for about thirty seconds before Harry pulled back and began to stare at Ron with hunger in his eyes “You big lug, I knew you weren’t stealing from me. I just wanted to make sure you were actually on my side and not Dumbledore’s.” Harry told him and Ron’s face lit up. </p><p>“Y-y-you mean you know?”</p><p>“Of course I knew.” Harry said as he readjusted himself so that he now straddled Ron’s muscled thighs. </p><p>“O-o-ok. So what about…” Ron trailed off. </p><p>“Ron, I’ve loved you since our second year, I just didn’t think you would feel the same way so I never said anything.”</p><p>“So, you feel the same way then?” Ron tried to clarify. </p><p>“Yup” Harry beamed</p><p>“Well good then. But what are we going to do about everything else.” Ron tried to ask but was cut off by a finger to his lips. </p><p>“Ron, I, am currently straddling your thighs right now. The person who you have had a crush on for years. Are you telling me that you would rather talk about getting revenge than taking me apart inch by inch? Might I remind you, it is Saturday and no one will be int he castle for the next five hours. And” Harry said as he leaned down and brought his lips to Ron’s ears, “I’m virgin tight” he whispered seductively as his tongue darted and traced a circle around Ron’s ears. </p><p>Almost instant, the positions were reversed and Harry was on his back with a lust filled Ron hovering over him.</p>
