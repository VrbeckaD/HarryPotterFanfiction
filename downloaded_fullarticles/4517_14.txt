</p><p>"you know children"started harry while siting in front of his children"the story between myself and your father is more long and complex from what you know...everything started in 1991, when i enter the hogwarts express for the first time.</p><p> <em>I was a little scared and confused with the idea of being a wizard, for me that was totally insane, but anything was better that my uncles so...</em></p><p>
  <em>Rigth after stepped into the train, i seriusly thougth i was crazy and was going agaisnt a wall but lucky me a family of red heads helped me or i woud have been there a long time trying to find the plataform. the twins that i later found that were called Fred and George helped me putting my trunk into the train and now i was with their youngst brother ,Ron,eating chocolate frogs and a lot of other candys. A girl called Hermonie Granger, stepped here a few minutes ago, she seemed really smart and was funny to see how she had left Ron so pissed</em>
</p><p>"dad, we know how you met uncle Ron and aunt Hermonie, you told us!"said the brown hair boy</p><p>"ok ok"harry laugth"lets jump to the part your father shows, how about that?"harry asked and the children nodded"ok..."</p><p>
  <em>i was chatting with Ron about hogwarts houses when 3 boys show up at the door of our cabin. two of them look like bodyguards or mayben even loyal foloweres i confess i didnt pay a lot of attention on them because my attention was stuck in the boy on the middle of them. He had blond and long hair, almost white, he´s eyes were grey, stuck on me, making me unconfortable</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"it´s true?"he asked still looking at me "they are saying Harry Potter is in this cabin.so it´s you?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"yes"i simply answer, his voice make me shiver, i looked away from the blond one to look to his side</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"oh, this is crabbe and this is goyle" he presented"and my name is Draco, Draco Malfoy"</em>
</p><p>the children started moving in the couch what make harry laughed</p><p>"ok, smart ones, you already know this part to, right?" harry asked and they nodded"so you also remember that he tried to be my friend and i denied?"they nodded again"ok so lets skip a little in the story to when the hate between draco and me started to grown bigger</p><p>
  <em>"i still can´t belive you broke the rules and got the skeeker place on the quidditch team"said hermonie unbeliving</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"and got malfoy with an idiot face,dont forget that" Ron laughed</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"it was not quite like that"i answer underbelly , walking into the great hall with them.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"of course it was, he left cursing you of all posible names after the teacher got you out of there"my best friend told while sitting at the gryffindor table</em>
</p><p>
  <em>i follow him and sit by his side, thinking about what happen i lifted my eyes and looked at the table of Salazar Slytherin that was envolved in an happy chat, the students looked exited with the activities during the week espcially the first years. my eyes run the tabe until they found the blond i was looking for. Malfoy was talking with a blond girl and a black hair boy, laughing at something they said. i watch  him for sometime, close to his friends he was completly different of the boy that anoyed me . He laughed of something and drink a little of pumpkin juice, his eyes stopped founding mine. i felt a shiver going at all of my body i looked aways feeling my face burning. Great now malfoy will think i spend my dinner looking at him</em>
