    <p>Ginny steeled her nerves and knocked on Professor Slughorn's door.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>She needed to do <i>something</i> to help the younger students and Slughorn was far more likely listen to her. Maybe she could tutor them during detention, and also encourage their resistance to Snape and the other Death Eaters. </p><p>Even if Slughorn didn't, though, he wouldn't torture her just for asking. The Carrows would just hit her with the Cruciatus Curse and laugh for even trying.</p><p>"Ah, Miss Weasley." Ginny swallowed as Slughorn's eyes seemed to roam over her in a less than professorial fashion. He licked his lips. "To what do I owe the pleasure?" </p><p>Her stomach turned. </p><p>"I wanted to talk with you about the detentions that are being given to the first and second years," she said, holding her head high. </p><p>"There isn't anything I can do, Miss Weasley." He reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a small container. "Crystallised pineapple?"</p><p>"No, thank you," she replied. "What do you mean you can't do anything?"</p><p>"Severus... that is the <i>Headmaster</i> has given me strict instructions about who is to receive detention with whom."</p><p>Ginny blinked. Snape? Why?</p><p>"Well, I think it's very unfair to frighten the firsties that end up in detention with the Carrows." She crossed her arms over her chest. </p><p>Slughorn took another piece of pineapple, chewing it slowly. "Tell me what you have in mind, Miss Weasley."</p><p>"I thought maybe you could make it appear that they are in detention but I could tutor them in potions or Defence Against the Dart Arts."</p><p>"What's in it for me?" He was giving her that look again, like she was a delectable sweet.</p><p>"You wouldn't feel guilty about bad things happening to your students."</p><p>"I'm afraid you'll have to do better than that, Miss Weasley," he said, standing and walking around his desk.</p><p>Ginny stayed perfectly still as his hand came to rest at the small of her back. She felt his breath hot on her neck and he seemed to be inhaling. </p><p>"You smell so very sweet, <i>Ginny</i>," he said. </p><p>She'd heard rumours about Slughorn though most still weren't as bad as the ones she'd heard about the Death Eaters. </p><p>"What do you want from me?" she whispered. </p><p>"You could make an old wizard like myself very happy." Slughorn brushed his hand lazily in circles on her bottom.</p><p>"You'll keep the first and second years out of the hands of the Carrows?"</p><p>"And in return you will serve two detentions a week—" His fingers then found the center of her bottom and slid between the crease. "—with me, in my chambers."</p><p>She closed her eyes and knew this was the moment when she had to decide.</p><p>"When is my first detention?" She shivered as he buried his nose in her hair.</p><p>"Tonight, my dear," he said, breathing heavily. "I can hardly wait." </p><p>Ginny swallowed the bile that had risen in her throat as she walked back to Gryffindor Tower. She could do this.</p>
