    <p>Each first dinner of the year at Hogwarts was as exciting as the ones before. Teddy loved the Sorting ceremony, the looks of hope and excitement in the eyes of each 11 year old that stepped up to be sorted. He actually kind of liked the terror he could see in some kids' eyes, but only because it was gone the second their house was announced.<br/>
Harry had told him that the houses used to be a lot more separate when he went to Hogwarts, but after the battle against Voldemort and his Death Eaters the lines were kind of blurred. They had movie nights in the Ravenclaw towers, sleep overs at Hufflepuff (it's the closest to the kitchen, duh), ran up the wrong staircase in the Gryffindor common room just to slide back down, and in summer, when it was hot even in Scotland, they all met down in the Slytherin common room, enjoying the cooler temperatures down there.<br/>
But at the Sorting ceremony everyone was hoping their house would get the most promising new students. They had a house cup to win after all.</p>
<p>The night of his fourth first day at Hogwarts, right before the first students started to leave and go to their dorms, one of the eleven year olds spoke up. Teddy was surprised to see such a young student standing up, getting on the bank he was sitting on and practically yelling to be heard. First years were usually a lot more intimidated by the whole experience and never dared to ask a question or say something that was meant to be heard by the whole school.<br/>
But there he was. A dorky looking black haired boy, waving his arms to get attention from everyone.<br/>
The conversations all around the great hall died down and everybody turned to the new Gryffindor.</p>
<p>"Sorry, but what's the Wifi password?"</p>
<p>Teddy could see the surprise on his friends' faces. The purebloods (who would never call themselves that) had a questioning look in their eyes. "What's a wi-" Lucas was shut down by McGonagall's magically loud answer: "sherbetlemon, all lowercase."</p>
<p>The muggleborns all hummed as a thanks, both to McGonagall and to the little Gryffindor. The other students who grew up with either one muggle parent or parents who tried to live like muggles all started laughing at their clueless friends while hundreds of people got their phones out and locked onto the Wifi.</p>
<p>Teddy just smirked. He'd known the password for years now. After all he did help Minerva and Neville set it up.</p>
