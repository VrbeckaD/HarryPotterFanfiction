    <p>Well. It was one thing to hear that his brother had gotten into such a predicament. It was another entirely to see it with his own eyes. And what a sight it was. </p><p>His large ass was sticking out of the wall, head poking out through the other side, exposed to the elements. Thor had decided, upon his arrival to Wakanda, that no metal – no matter how superior - could contain him, and so had decided to prove it by flying through a wall. Only, he had underestimated its strength, and had wound up stuck inside, like a deer’s head on a wall, although the ass isn’t usually the part being displayed. </p><p>Either way, it made for a most amusing sight, and would give him plenty of blackmail material for years to come, if the pleading look on his brothers face as he had entered the building was anything to go by.</p><p>It’s good to be the smart sibling.</p>
