    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p class="western">Time management had never been his forte as shown by today.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">John had been meaning to study, but then Sherlock had caught onto a murderer at Diagon Alley and of course the Gryffindor had to follow him as they chased him down. After that, John went to Muggle London to buy candy that wouldn’t explode or jinx him due from Sherlock’s experiments. When he returned, he had found out that Sherlock had foolishly tried to start a fight with Head boy James Moriarty again and ended up with a broken nose.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">After giving Sherlock a scolding and healing his broken nose, they had headed down to the field to watch the Slytherins train, but of course, Moriarty had been there. Sherlock, despite being a Ravenclaw, stupidly walked up to the Head Boy and landed a punch on his face before John had the chance to stop him.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">John had rushed to the Slytherin despite Sherlock telling him not to, already with his wand out, healing spell on his lips. Moriarty was sitting up, one hand reaching for his wand as the other wiped away the blood pouring from his nose.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Moriarty, can I help?”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">Before waiting for a reply, John touched the boy’s cheek. The second John’s hand made contact, Moriarty’s eyes snapped open to meet John’s eyes, hands twitching. The Gryffindor remained oblivious, casting a spell to fix his nose.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">After that, Professor Malfoy escorted Sherlock and Moriarty to the Headmaster Granger’s office, leaving John to finally sit down and study. The only problem was that Mary Morstan had seemed determined to convince John that she was the one he should invite to the Halloween Ball.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">It took an hour and a promise of a date to reassure her that maybe he would go to Halloween Ball with her. Just as he had all his supplies ready to study, Madam Hudson came and told him the library was closing.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>But, Madam Hudson, I need to study for tomorrow’s Potions exam.” John pleaded. “Can’t you give me like thirty more minutes please.”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">Madam Hudson sighed before reaching into her pocket. She took out a key and with a wave of her wand duplicated it.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>I trust you, dear, and I understand how it can get noisy at the common rooms. Go to bed before 11, and close the library doors once you’re done.” She ordered and John nodded eagerly. She smiled and ruffled his hair.</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Good night, John. I’m going to lock the doors behind me so that no one else comes back in.”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Thank you, Madam Hudson.” </span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">The librarian nodded and waved goodbye.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">With that, the Gryffindor opened his textbooks and began to speed read the books. Sherlock may be able to see something once and classify it for later, but John was normal. He had to study and reread and go over things, because unlike Sherlock he did not have a photographic memory.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">Somewhere between how to make Polyjuice Potion and its side effects, John began to think about what had happened earlier. Sherlock wasn’t the type to just hit someone for no reason, and yet, when it came to the Head boy, he seemed to lost all inhibitions.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">It had started earlier this year after the fall. Sherlock and Moriarty were constantly arguing in class, or rather Sherlock was always arguing with Moriarty while the other smirked and taunted him. Despite all this, there seemed to be an undercurrent tension and issue John didn’t know about. Moriarty was one of the best students at Hogwarts, with an intelligence rivalling Sherlock’s, but he did seem to be a little off. There was something wrong about him. Moriarty had plenty of friends though they seemed to be more like followers.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">John shook his head and tried focusing again, but he was bored by the text. Maybe a walk around the lake would help then he could come back in to finish the chapter at least.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">He left his things on the table and pocketed the key to the library after locking it close. Swiftly, he ran down the stairs and to the lake. It was beautiful at night time, the moon reflecting of the water’s surface. John walked around the edge, closing his eyes with a smile.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">Finally, a bit of relaxing time.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">The air around him suddenly dropped and John frowned, opening his eyes. Why had it suddenly gotten cold? His answer came to him as he saw a Dementor coming towards him. How had a Dementor gotten on grounds? The Gryffindor scrambled back, reaching for his wand, but it was too late.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">Pain and sadness ripped through John as the Dementor began sucking out the happy memories. John felt tears sliding down his cheeks, and his hands clenched but he was immobile. The ground beneath him shifted quickly and he felt himself sliding into the freezing water. He felt as if he were turning into ice, with the Dementor freezing his inside and the cold water freezing his outside. It was when he was chest high that he heard footsteps running his way.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Watson!” a voice shouted. “Expecto Patronus!”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">The Dementor screeched, letting go of the Gryffindor, and as John crumbled into the water, he saw a fox chasing it down. A pair of hands frantically grabbed John and pulled him out of the water, laying him down on the ground. Fingers caressed John’s face and his name was being repeated. Why did his voice sound so familiar?</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>John, come on. Open your eyes. Say something, Watson. ” </span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">He opened his eyes as he finally identified the voice. Moriarty.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Moriarty.” He coughed, trying to sit up. The Slytherin helped him up, quickly chucking off his robes.</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Fuck, you’re alright.” Moriarty wrapped his robes around John. The blond froze as the Head Boy ran his hands through John’s sopping hair. “Thought I had lost you for a second.”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Moriarty?” John coughed as Moriarty moved back, cupping John’s face.</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Why were you even out here, you idiot? Alone, no less?!” His voice went dark, and John flinched at the malicious tone. </span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>I was studying and wanted to go for a walk.” John blushed at the little distance between their faces, feeling overwhelmed.</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>You were almost killed! What if I hadn’t gotten there in time, Watson? For Merlin’s sake, you are such an imbecile” He hissed, sounding furious. John winced. He may not have been as smart as Sherlock but to hear it from someone else hurt.</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>I’m sorry.” John found himself shuddering at the warmth Moriarty was giving off through his hands. Even with the robes he had given him, John was shivering.</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">The Head boy noticed this and tugged him towards the castle.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Let’s get you warmed up.”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">John sleepily let him guide him back to the castle. He was somewhere on the thin line between sharp clarity and heavy drowsiness. It took him a second to realize he was not being led to the Gryffindor dormitories but down to the dungeons.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Where are you taking me, Moriarty?”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Jim.”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">John frowned in confusion.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Moriarty makes me sound like a creep. Call me Jim.” He smirked, and John couldn’t help the blush on his cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Where are you taking me... Jim?”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Head Boy rooms.”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">There was no explanation and John just tiredly followed him, stumbling on the steps which caused him to bump into Jim.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Sorry.” John muttered.</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>We’re almost there.” Jim smirked as they approached the Head Boy’s room. “You can sleep on my bed and I’ll sleep on the couch, yeah? I can bring you some chocolate from the kitchen.”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">John chuckled and shook his head, head pounding.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Thank you.” John smiled as Jim whispered the password to the door which opened a second later. As they entered, John’s vision suddenly dizzied and he was suddenly being held in Moriarty’s arms.</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Damn,” the Head Boy cursed as he sprinted to his bedroom John shaking violently. “John, I need you to stay awake for me. Talk to me. You close your eyes and you will die.”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">John could faintly feel Jim placing him on the bed and his clothes being ripped from him. Everything was freezing and a sudden painful pinch brought him back from the darkness he had been creeping into.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>John, talk.”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">John groaned.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Cold. Tired. Let me sleep, Jim... I think I left my things in the library. Madam Hudson is going to kill me. Dementor was so cold. Hurt. Then you were there.” John murmured as he opened his eyes to find a dishevelled Jim bringing in some more blankets from his closet. He also realized that somewhere between the door and now, he had been changed out of his soaked clothes and into some pyjamas that were too big for him.</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Sorry I got your clothes wet.”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">Jim blinked and let out a laugh.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>I don’t think that’s what’s most important right now.” He put the extra blankets over John whose vision was beginning to blur.</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“<span>Thanks for saving me.”</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">And with those last slurred words, John slipped into unconsciousness.</p>
<p> </p>
