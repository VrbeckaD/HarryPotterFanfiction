  <strong>Chapter One: Dinner </strong>
</p>
<p>“Viktor.” Hermione approached with a wide smile and outstretched arms.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help smiling back. She gave him a long tight hug and after a moment’s hesitation he returned it burying his face in her bushy brown hair. She smelt wonderful, something sweet and very light that he couldn’t quite place.She broke the hug and beamed at him. He hugged her again and she laughed.</p>
<p>“It has been far too long.” She said taking a small step back to look at him.</p>
<p>“Yes, it has.” He replied.</p>
<p>He had been working hard on his English. He still had an accent but it was much less pronounced thanks to a vocal coach by the name of Herman. He offered her his arm just as he had nearly seven years ago. She laughed again and together they made their way inside the muggle restaurant. They were quickly seated towards the back near some large decorative ferns. It somewhat gave the illusion of privacy as an impeccably dressed waiter handed them menus. </p>
<p>“Shall we have wine?” He asked and she nodded eagerly.</p>
<p>“I have had an alarmingly busy week and wine would be an excellent way to end it,” she said.</p>
<p>He nodded. She shed her coat and settled back with the menu. He couldn’t take his eyes off her. She had grown since their last meeting. She still had bushy brown hair and that delightful smile. Her eyes still had that defiant spark and her mouth looked as kissable as ever.</p>
<p>She caught him looking and he quickly fixed his eyes to the menu before him. He had missed her. Their regular correspondence had been lovely but he had missed seeing her. Not that it had been so very long. They had seen each other several times over the years. Mostly dinners like this when he came to play against English teams, but also for a few weddings. Including her own.</p>
<p>It had broken his heart a little to be there but he’d loved seeing her so happy. Having her smile at him when he arrived, and then later as he danced with her had meant everything. She had laid her head on his shoulder and thanked him for coming. After their dance they’d found a corner and talked for over an hour. Her new husband had had to come claim her from him so they could leave on their honeymoon.</p>
<p>His last sight of her had been as she left, her husband playfully pulling her to the door as she yelled for him to write.<br/>
He scanned the menu letting himself enjoy her presence again.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll try the fish. You’ll want the lamb,” she announced setting her menu aside and grinning at him.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help laughing back. It felt like a fairytale to be here with her having dinner again. </p>
<p>“How was the hospital today?” he asked. He knew she was up for a promotion and was excited to hear if she got it. </p>
<p>“I was offered the promotion,” she said with a grin.</p>
<p>“Congratulations,” he said.</p>
<p>“I turned it down,” she said looking very determinedly at her menu. For a second he was shocked but then recovered. </p>
<p>“Oh I thought you were excited about the possibility.”</p>
<p>“I was. I am. I just-” she looked away. She suddenly looked very tired.</p>
<p>“We had a patient last week, I’m not sure if I told you about them. He had been, traumatized by the war. I guess in a way we all were.”</p>
<p>Viktor nodded.</p>
<p>“It was a hard time,” he said.</p>
<p>“This young man was broken by it. We couldn’t really help.” She returned her gaze to him. “I keep up to date on several muggle medical journals. There was something in one, it might have helped. I don’t know for sure. But none of us were trained in how to do it. So he is now in the mental wards. He’s recovering but I can’t help thinking it could be a lot faster. In the magical world we focus so much on near instant results from potions and spells. I can’t help wondering what we are missing here. Especially around mental health.”</p>
<p>Viktor nodded. </p>
<p>“As a result I have been considering--” she hesitated then smiled at Viktor and continued. “I have been considering studying psychology, from the Muggle perspective.” </p>
<p>“That sounds great. If it will make you a better healer why would you not?”<br/>
Hermione sighed and slowly shook her head looking at him sadly. It occurred to him he might be missing something.</p>
<p>“Would it upset your husband?” he asked suddenly concerned.</p>
<p>“Upset isn’t really the word I would use.” She suddenly seemed on the verge of tears and he quickly leaned forwards placing his hand on hers. </p>
<p>“Hermione, is everything okay between you two?”</p>
<p>She sniffed and looked at him quickly shaking her head and pulling herself together.</p>
<p>“Yes, we’re fine. Totally fine. Just been a long day Viktor.” He knew she was lying. </p>
<p>“I do not believe you,” he said gently and squeezed her hand. “But if you do not wish to talk about it, we will not. I will not pry.” He sat back.</p>
<p>“Oh Viktor. I-” She reached across the table and grabbed his hand. “I just, I don’t want to burden you with my personal problems. I haven’t seen you in so long, and it’s such a lovely night. We should speak of happy things.”</p>
<p>He could see she was torn and felt a little like he was intruding. He was her friend, and he loved her. If he was honest with himself he would admit he more than loved her, but that wasn’t the issue here. He would give her the option to talk. </p>
<p>“We can speak of anything you wish Hermione. But please remember, I am your friend. And I am here to listen to your problems whenever you need. If you need to talk about your husband I am here. Even if it is just to listen.”</p>
<p>Hermione sighed heavily looking at him with sad eyes. </p>
<p>“It is not burden to hear your problems,” he added. “I wish to help you in any way I can.” He moved back again and signaled the waiter. “So, we will order some food, and a bottle of wine. Then you can talk to me about anything you so desire. I swear it will stay between us.”</p>
<p><br/>
The waiter appeared, they ordered, and Viktor sat patiently as Hermione looked at him with slumped shoulders. The wine was quickly poured and the waiter disappeared.<br/>
She picked up the glass and took a sip. Then with a small inclination of her head she seemed to make a decision.</p>
<p>“I haven’t really talked about this with anyone you see. I suppose I should, shouldn’t I?” He nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“My mother,” he started “She often told me, as child, if there is something wrong with your feelings, you should tell someone. Just like if you have hurt yourself. Considering your current interest in mental health I doubt you will have issue with her words.”</p>
<p>“There isn’t really much to say in a way,” she said leaning forwards. He very deliberately did not look at the cleavage that had just appeared.</p>
<p>“We still love each other very much. We are still best friends, but there is no-” She waved her hand vaguely as she tried to think of the word. “Romance between us. There was at the start but it disappeared, rather quicker than I would have liked. We fell into routine in a way, both of us leading our own lives, me at the hospital, him with the ministry. We became more and more house mates instead of partners. Then about six months ago I woke up and realised we hadn’t had sex in a very long time.” She smiled sadly at him and he allowed himself look at her rather stunning body. He didn’t make it a leer, more an appreciative examination.</p>
<p>“I am guessing he was hit with a curse to not appreciate you,” he said.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said sipping her wine. “If it was just that I would be fine. I don’t need him to-” she waved her hand again “-desire me.”</p>
<p>Viktor frowned a little at this but nodded.</p>
<p>“Okay, then what is it?”</p>
<p>“I think I’m hurting him.” Viktor put his wine down.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“By…” She hesitated and he saw those tears return. “Being more successful than him.” A single tear fell and formed a small perfect circle on the white tablecloth. He covered her hand with his once again. </p>
<p>“A man should be proud of his wife’s accomplishments. Even if they exceed his own,” he said gently.</p>
<p>“It’s not that he’s not proud of me, or pleased he really is. He is always the first to say I am a brilliant witch. But I can see it’s starting to hurt him, to be Hermione’s husband and nothing more. We were all rather famous for a while but now, it’s fading. I think he’s starting to really miss the attention.”<br/>
She took a deep shuddering breath.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I should be sharing this but he has… issues around being less important, less accomplished. He has always had older brothers who have greatly exceeded him. Anything he did they’d already done first. So for him it was hard to be himself and gain recognition. When we were, fourteen actually,” she gave him a cheeky grin. “He got very jealous of Harry being in the tournament, then I’m guessing you remember his uh-”<br/>
Viktor nodded smiling.</p>
<p>“I do remember his anger at our time alone at the Yule ball. He was rather, well rude.”</p>
<p>“He most certainly was,” she agreed. “He did apologise and learn and grow a bit. But those issues remain. Then war really shoved us all together. If not for it I think we would never have married.” She toyed with her wineglass. “We would have maybe spent a year or two together then grown apart naturally. After all we’ve been through though it’s a bit harder to do so. We were all so close, we still are.”<br/>
She sat back and their food arrived.</p>
<p><br/>
“So,” he hesitated. “Do you want to stay married?”</p>
<p><br/>
“Yes. It seems a terrible waste for us to not try and salvage our marriage. But at the same time I am so tired at the idea. I’m now worried about resentment setting in between us. He is such a loyal friend. He would never cheat on me or anything like that. I’ve tried a couple of times to talk about it but he always says he’s fine. And if I’m honest I don’t really want to try and fix it. It makes me feel so awful.”<br/>
She poked at her fish with a fork.</p>
<p>“Stupid man. He’ll never leave me. I’ll have to leave him and it’ll break his heart. Even if he agrees it’s better for us.”</p>
<p>She stabbed the fish and glared at it for a moment before eating it. </p>
<p>“He will forgive you. You are after all best friends, and always have been. Even though it will hurt he will heal, find another woman. One better suited and they will be happy. And you will find someone who gives you what you need.” He started on his lamb watching her carefully.</p>
<p>“I honestly hadn’t really considered it,” she said shrugging.</p>
<p>“Considered what?”</p>
<p>“Me, falling in love with someone else.”</p>
<p>“You should,” he replied. “You deserve happiness and a relationship that truly makes you feel loved, and wanted.” She looked at him as though surprised. He kept eating.</p>
<p>“How is it that you’ve said what I need without me realising it?” she asked reaching for her wine which was now almost empty.</p>
<p>“I am your friend. I may not be as close as Ron or Harry, but I am your friend. I want you to be happy.” He hesitated for a moment wondering if he should share his feelings for her. </p>
<p>“I want you to have the best possible life. I want you to be so happy you can barely-” he waved his hands. “Barely handle the joy. I want the best for you. I am your friend and I love you.” He stopped, wondering if he had gone too far as tears were forming in her eyes again.</p>
<p>“I say wrong thing?” he asked his accent becoming thick once more as he became anxious.</p>
<p>“No Viktor.” She wiped her eyes with her napkin. “You said the kindest thing. Something I have forgotten. For Ron and for myself. Thank you.”<br/>
He grinned and she laughed.</p>
<p>“See, talking helped.” She laughed harder and he saw more tears. He reached into his pocket and offered her his handkerchief. She took it wiping away the last of her tears. </p>
<p>“Okay now I demand we talk of happy things. Tell me of your romantic life.”</p>
<p>He held up both hands.<br/>
“There would have to be one for me to talk about,” he said quickly.</p>
<p>“No one?” she asked returning to her food.</p>
<p>“No one serious,” he lied. He wasn’t about to confess the depth of his inexperience. That truly would be a burden.</p>
<p>“I can however tell you I was offered a place on an English team.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really.” She asked excited.</p>
<p>“Yes, they offered me a great deal of money and I am tempted to take it. Just for one year. I think it would be good for me to try playing with others. I have been on the same team doing the same thing for a long time now and it might be a good idea to learn some new skills. But I probably won’t,” he confessed.</p>
<p>“Whyever not?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Why won’t you study psychology?” he shot back. She laughed.</p>
<p>“If you go study psychology I will join the English team,” he said.<br/>
She laughed and he was happy when he saw that determined flash in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Deal,” she said, holding out her hand. He shook it. </p>
<p>Unknown to them both a familiar blonde in green had seen them across the restaurant. A discreet photo was taken as they sat together, and a quick quotes quill started moving under the tablecloth. </p>
<p>Oblivious Hermione and Viktor sat talking long into the night eating, drinking, and swapping stories until closing. They parted with a friendly hug and a kiss on the cheek. Both promising to meet again soon. </p>
<p>Hermione wandered home that night feeling more herself than she had in a very long time. Turning on the light (”Honestly Ronald why would we not take advantage of electricity”) she entered her house. Dropping her coat and bag on the dining table she drew her wand. The rest of the lights turned on with a flick of her hand.<br/>
She entered the kitchen to find a note from Ron saying he was working late. Unconcerned she headed upstairs and collapsed into their bed alone. A soft thump and a gentle purring alerted her to Crookshanks entrance. He padded up the bed and curled himself against her back purring gently. </p>
<p>As she fell asleep she found herself thinking not of her husband, but of Viktor. The man, once the boy who had taken her to the Yule Ball. A boy who had kissed her so very gently and called her beautiful before any other. A man who had now reminded her of her own needs, her own desires.</p>
