    <h3 dir="ltr">September 1st 1964</h3><p dir="ltr">After all the impatient waiting, the months and months of missing her big sister and wishing away the time and counting the days, it was finally the most important day of Andromeda’s life so far. She was officially a Hogwarts student, and wouldn’t be thought of as a baby any longer.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, she was secretly quite glad that she was one of the first to be called forward for Sorting; she hadn’t liked the idea of standing there watching everyone else and wondering if she’d be the unlucky one who took forever. She stepped up to the stool, catching Bellatrix’s eye at the Slytherin table, and gave her a little smile before the brim of the Sorting Hat fell over her eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">“Another Miss Black, I see,” it said thoughtfully in her ear. “Not as fierce as the last one, though, and there’s certainly something that can be said for that love of learning… Ravenclaw might benefit from a mind like that -” She froze, a bolt of panic lancing through her. “But no, you’re right, I suppose it had better be SLYTHERIN!”</p><p dir="ltr">Swallowing down the brief jolt of terror, Andromeda tried to look confident as the Hat was lifted off her head. Tossing her hair with a little smile, she made her way down to the applauding table on her right. A space was made for her next to Bellatrix, and as she settled down the two girls gave each other a delighted look. As the hall quietened for the next first-year, Andromeda felt her big sister’s hand squeeze hers briefly, and felt a warm glow of pride.</p><p>She was a Slytherin now, just like the rest of their family, and she would make them all proud.</p>
