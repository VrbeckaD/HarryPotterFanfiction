    <p>“Scorpius! Post for you!”</p><p>Scorpius leaps from his unpacking to run down the stairs and to Draco, who’s gently stroking a tawny owl that Scorpius immediately recognizes as being Albus’ Fleck. He skids to a stop next to his dad. “Potter mail!”</p><p>“Potter mail,” Astoria confirms as she walks in, kissing Scorpius on the cheek as his dad hands him an envelope. “Didn’t you just say goodbye two days ago?”</p><p>“So many things could’ve <em>changed</em> since then, mum!” Scorpius responds. He’s sure his excitement seems silly to an outsider, getting so excited about mail when he’s reliably gotten at least two letters from Albus a week <em>every</em> week during breaks, but it’s hard adjusting to not having your best friend nearby. Even there’s a castle between the Gryffindor Tower and the Slytherin Dungeon at Hogwarts, they spend more time together than apart; Scorpius misses just being able to <em>talk</em> to Albus, without waiting days for owls to travel between houses.</p><p>Scorpius rushes to the sitting room and slides into one of the stiff-backed chairs, carefully opening the envelope. He loves his parents but reading Albus' letters is a <em>personal</em> thing and he'd rather not do it around them. He fishes out a piece of parchment with Albus’ messy script on it; it’s littered with stray ink blots and smells vaguely of mint, like all of Albus’ letters from home do, and he can already feel his smile stretching into silly territory as he unfolds it.</p><p></p><div class="transcript">

    <em>Scorpius,<br/></em>

  <p>
    <em>Summer’s just begun and being home is already an absolute <u>nightmare</u>. Lily is annoying, James is being a prat -- as always -- and my dad is <strike>irritat</strike> <strike>terrib</strike> <strike>he just doesn’t</strike> <strike>he keeps trying to talk and</strike></em>
  </p>
  <p><strike> </strike> <em>Well, you know how it is. </em></p>
  <p>
    <em>Panju’s planning some kind of “Ultimate Prank” for school already, even though we just got out, and I’m stuck being his test dummy all summer because our parents are making us hang out. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Again. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>My dad keeps stressing the importance of “having a large support system” and “being nice to others,” which is all bullocks, but my mum seems to think that being “good friends” with my cousins is important. I think she’s been reading Aunt Hermione’s parenting books again.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The worst part is that I don’t even know if I can say being home is better than being at Hogwarts, because at least Hogwarts has you. I wish you could come over.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Anyway, owl me back soon, let me know how the Malfoys’ French holiday is going. And give your mum my best, alright?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Yours,</em>
  </p>

</div><p>When Scorpius finishes reading, he feels like his heart’s been replaced by a fire crab. He’s sure that he looks ridiculous -- sitting with one leg folded into the chair, letter pressed to his heart, grinning goofily -- but he can’t find it in himself to care. <em>“At least Hogwarts has you”</em> bounces around Scorpius’ head, and it’s all he can do not to jump around.</p><p>It’s not that Albus is impersonal or <em>cold</em> with him, of course not, but it’s always nice to have confirmation that he means as much to Albus as Albus means to him. Scorpius lets himself sit, gleeful, for a moment longer before he gives in to his burst of energy and starts running back to his room to write Albus back.</p><p>“Albus sends his best, mum!” Scorpius yells as he speeds past the dining room.</p><p>“Hey, slow down!” Astoria says, and Scorpius reluctantly does so, though he continues to bounce on the balls of his feet as he stops in the doorway. Both of his parents are drinking tea and his mum is reading the paper, but she puts it down to look at him. “Are you all unpacked? We’re going into the city later, and I’d like all your stuff to be squared away by then.”</p><p>“I mean, sort of?” Scorpius rolls his lips thin, thinking of his mostly still-packed stuff in his room. “I promise it won’t take me long to finish up, I just have to write Albus back, then-”</p><p>“Love, you haven’t had the chance to do anything yet,” Astoria softly interjects, though she sounds a bit amused, “You can owl him back later, when you have something to tell him.”</p><p>“But if I owl him <em>now</em>, he’ll get it by tomorrow, and then he can write me back, and it’ll only be about two days until I get another letter from him,” Scorpius explains, counting off the steps on his fingers, “If I wait until we come back, I might not get anything for <em>three</em> days.”</p><p>“And what a tragedy that would be,” Draco says, drily. Scorpius deflates a little and Astoria swipes at Draco with her newspaper. The two share a look. “What I meant, Scorpius, is that you two won’t fall apart if you don’t speak to him for more than two days. I feel like you spend more time writing than actually enjoying our holidays, sometimes.”</p><p>“I don’t mean to,” Scorpius says, wishing he was wearing a jumper so he could fidget with the sleeves, just for something to occupy his hands other than just folding and unfolding Albus’ letter, “It’s just- He’s my best mate, you know? He’s important to me, and I… miss him, a bit.”</p><p>“Leave him alone, Draco, don’t you remember when we were-” Astoria cuts herself off with a hum, frowning for a moment. His parents exchange another look, this one more weighted. Scorpius politely averts his eyes as his mother and father make faces at each other, communicating without saying anything. Eventually, Draco clears his throat and Astoria says, “We understand, Scorpius. You can go write Albus back, just make sure to unpack too, alright? And give him our best.”</p><p>Scorpius is already in motion again by the time she finishes talking, climbing the stairs two at a time. “Got it! Thanks mum!”</p><p>When he gets to his room, he collapses on his bed, rereading Albus’ letter twice. He sighs, happily, and levers himself up to grab his writing supplies. He has a letter to write.</p>
