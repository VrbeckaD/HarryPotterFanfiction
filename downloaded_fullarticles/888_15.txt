    <p>The sky is a dreary grey as Harry walks through the ruins of a fallen Hogwarts. The castle repairs have yet to commence. In these long days following the battle, it seems almost as if everyone was dead. The majority of those who were alive were fortunate enough to have the foresight to escape the war. Sure Voldemort was also dead, and many of his Death Eaters were in prison, but at what cost? </p><p>For both sides, so many people died for what they believed in. Harry shakes his head. He'd never wanted anyone to die for him. The whole point of surrendering to death at the hands of Voldemort was so no one else had to die. </p><p>The bodies of the fallen had littered the vast expanse of Hogwarts, until the Healers came for them. Bodies were identified and given to their families. The unclaimed fighters would be buried in the upcoming memorial service. The few survivors had long been taken away to St. Mungo's. </p><p>Harry trudges past rubble and up the remains of the stairs. Harry wanders through the deteriorating castle, wary of any debris that may fall. He had given everything and still so many people had been killed. The Order had foolishly assumed that when Voldemort died, the Death Eaters would stop fighting and surrender. Or that after Harry gave himself up to Voldemort, the Death Eaters wouldn't kill everyone anyway. </p><p>After his brief death, when his Horcrux had been removed, Harry had woken up to an active battlefield. Deadly spells were flying as the light wizards fought for their lives. Many of the fighters on the light side had been killed while they were in the initial shock. Dumbledore's influence remained within his followers even a year after his death. They believed that the Dark Lord's supporters would honor their word. With this assumption, the Order stood in horror with the realization that Voldemort's plan was still to eradicate the Mudbloods and Blood Traitors. Too many died before they could fight back. Though even with this advantage, most of the Death Eaters had either fled or been detained or killed. </p><p>'And it's only going to get worse!' Harry thinks to himself, shaking his head. A new generation of purebloods will rise, and they will assume that this war only became so awful because of muggleborn participation. The persecuted muggleborn wizards would only retaliate in defense and so starts another war. </p><p>Dragging his hand down his face, Harry sighs and looks up to take note of his current surroundings. He has ambled to a room in the castle that has very few marks, or any other evidence that a war had even taken place. Harry pushes the door open. Inside, a single artifact sits. He hasn't seen this mirror since his first year at Hogwarts. Harry steps into the room. A few cautious paces puts Harry in front of the mirror. The image is similar to the one from the past. </p><p>This Harry isn't eleven, but older, seventeen it looks like, and stands proudly. Behind him stand his mother and father. Further into the mirror, space is filled with slowly appearing people. Remus, Sirius, Tonks. Hermione and Ron, Ginny and Fred and George. Neville and Luna and Colin and Lavender and - Harry doesn't notice the furious tears trailing down his face. He does notice, however, is that all these people are smiling at him and holding hands, as if they were a family. He's startled to find people he doesn't know. A redheaded boy and a black haired girl who seem to be a few years younger than Harry. He can recognize their faces though, are they- could they- he could of had siblings? </p><p>These children and standing next to Harry, in front of James and Lily who must be their parents. But they look up at the mirror version of himself. He follows their loving gazes to his face. It takes Harry a moment to notice what's different. His scar- the one he's famous for, the one he hates- is gone. Harry's eyes dart around the mirror image's body and sees no other scars that he has obtained over the years. </p><p>This is what Voldemort took away from him. A normal life with a family that loves him. No scars, mentally or physically, from traumatic experiences that no one, especially a child, should have to go through. </p><p>Vision blurring, Harry's hand swipes under his broken glasses at the angry tears in his eyes. He pulls out his wand, arm shaking as he points it at the mirror. Harry couldn't help but wish he could be with his family. Voice wavering, Harry eventually whispers a phrase he's heard too many times. </p><p>"Avada Kedavra." </p><p>The familiar green light shoots from his wand and whirls towards the mirror. It strikes his reflection and rebounds. The mirror explodes. Harry watches with resignation as the light comes back towards him. Unknowingly, Harry's last conscious thought isn't his wish for death, but to finally join his family. As the green light strikes his chest, Harry's eyes close and his arms spread. And all he can feel is relief. </p><p>The mirror shards release a golden burst of magic that engulfs Harry before he falls. If anyone had been at Hogwarts that night, they might have noticed a pulse of silver energy emit from the castle. And if Hogwarts or Magic themselves had been so inclined to share, they might have revealed that they were simply granting his wish.</p>
