  <span>Alexandra Macmillan walked briskly through the dark alleyways of the city. The 23-year old, kept her head down and curled herself into her black sweatshirt and denim vest combo. She turned the corner to her small apartment. She quickly ascended the stairs, rushing to get off the streets and into a cold shower. Slamming the door shut and turning all the locks, she allowed herself to breathe\ a sigh of relief before hissing. She jerked off her vest and sweatshirt, throwing them to the floor before allowing the full impact of the burning pain that traveled up her side to hit her. After her moment, she walked into her small bathroom and started the shower. She took off her shirt and stared into the mirror as she watched the new Celtic line etch itself into her skin. She gritted her teeth in silent pain and allowed her eyes to fall onto the red stains on her hand. She washed her hands quickly, and pulled out her knife. She washed that as well. The first moments of her after-mission routine fulfilled, she took off the rest of her clothing and jumped into the shower. As the cold water poured down on her burning flesh, she shivered. She leaned her head on the wall, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Another day. Another life.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Meanwhile in Lestrange Manor</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Loud banging and explosions echoed in the large hall. A child screaming for her mother, loud male voices yelling obscene words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We surrender! Just don’t hurt </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” A woman’s voice trembled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“WE HAVE TO KILL THAT BASTARD!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ron….we can’t…”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Harry, if we don’t, You-know-who will rise again. Who says they haven’t been planning this for two years?” Ron bellowed. The small child cowered to the floor, holding her stuffed snake. Bellatrix was magically bound, whispering words of comfort. Rodolphus and Rabastan fought the other aurors. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ron...she’s a child. We cannot kill a child!” Harry wavered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry, you and I both know that...</span>
  <em>
    <span>thing</span>
  </em>
  <span>...is filled with darkness. We must end her. She is the spawn of this pathetic woman who killed and tortured our loved ones! We are good Harry, we have to break the rules once in a while to maintain the cause.” Ron yelled as he raised his wand to the child. She whimpered for her mother.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, No...you can’t hurt her! She is innocent! Please, kill me. Kill me instead!” Bellatrix screamed as she watched Harry reluctantly raise his own wand. Harry blocked out the uncharacteristic screams of Bellatrix Lestrange and the cries of a young child. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s it, mate. In the name of all the fallen, we will destroy his legacy…” Ron muttered and with a snarl prepared himself to unleash the killing curse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It happened in a flash. Bellatrix was bound to the floor one moment, and then in front of the child the next. Bellatrix had used wandless and wordless magic to escape her binds, shield her daughter and stun Ron and Harry. Ron in his rage sent a slicing stunner that hit Bellatrix in the chest before the Lestrange brothers engaged them in battle. The other aurors had been defeated but not without major damages to both brothers. The four men duelled with the child’s cries in the background. Stunned by the pain, Bellatrix softly muttered comforting words as she held her daughter. She would be damned to let them take her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rod! Come on!” Rabastan yelled as they threw hexes over and over. Harry and Ron had been backed into far away enough for the two men to grab Bellatrix and the child to apparate away from the hall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No! NO!” Ron bellowed as he let loose a series of damaging spells to the Lestrange Manor. Blood, debris and glass littered the floor. The stuffed snake sat in a pool of Bellatrix’s blood. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A short distance away, the Lestrange brothers appeared with Bellatrix and the child. The three weary from being on the run and the damaging fight, looked at each other with solemn eyes. There was blood pouring out of each of them. Rabastan knew the end was near for him and his brother. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Take her..to Cissy. She will hide her. The Order is under the impression that she doesn’t know I’m alive.” Bellatrix gasped out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We need to get you to safety.” Rod stuttered. He was paling quickly. She nodded. Stan looked at his brother. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I will take her to Alexandra. I need to see her face one more…” Stan’s voice wavered. Both men looked at each other and quickly embraced. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I love you brother. I will see you in the afterlife.” Rod quietly said. He turned to his wife and struggled over to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“ Bellatrix, I know I was never what you wanted, but you and I were good in what we did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Protect her, Rod.” Bellatrix breathed heavily. There was no embrace, no epic words of undying love. Bellatrix fell to her knees and grabbed her daughter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My darling little girl. Aunt Cissy will take care of you…”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Mama, please don’t leave me!” The dark haired girl clung to her mother’s neck, the dark witch’s blood dirtying her shirt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My baby, listen. I am coming back for you. You will see me again, my love. I promise on the moon and stars. I promise my darling.” She placed a kiss to the crying girl’s head, tighten her embrace and heaved a sob. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rod, take her now.” She pushed the girl to her husband. Stan stood behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rod, tell Narcissa to send anything to Alexandra. She can contact Marcus Willows for her location. He knows to answer the call.” Rod nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Goodbye and may we see each other in the afterlife.” Rod said wearily and used the last of his magic and strength to apparate himself and the child. At the crack, Bellatrix let out a howling sob.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Come on, we need to go.” He heard yelling in the background. Stan transfigured a stone to look like Rod and the child’s dead body and pulled out an American quarter. The two staggered. Rod grimaced as he felt the deep cut in his torso and felt blood rising up in his mouth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“STOP WHERE YOU ARE!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rabastan and Bellatrix looked at each and activated the coin. They disappeared as Ron and Harry made it to their spot. The American quarter fell to the ground, the tails side up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is it?” Ron growled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry knelt down and looked at it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“New York.” Harry couldn’t look at Ron. His eyes were stuck on the site of a dead Rodolphus Lestrange and dead toddler. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We must alert the New York Aurors at once. Bellatrix Lestrange will die.” Ron angrily apparated, quickly followed by Harry. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*** </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alexandra Macmillan was a witch. Born in 1976 in the UK, she and her mother were sent over to America via emergency portkey after the Dark Lord fell. She vaguely remember that day. She remembered many loud voices and a man rapidly whispering to her mother. He kissed her and looked soulfully into Alex’s eyes. Another man with a wand drawn entered the room. The man who had kissed her mother, pleaded and drew his own wand. The other man, she learned later, a junior auror, hesitated and left the room. She remembered the weird feeling through the portkey and landing in the middle of an alley. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Following that day, Alex and her mother Maeve made a small life for themselves. They moved into a modest magical block and Maeve kept a low profile. When Alex turned 11, all of the kids on the block were accepted into Ilvermorny. Jealous she waited with bated breath for her Hogwarts letter, which never did come. She asked her mother why she didn't receive her letter. She had heard her mother’s stories of her time in Slytherin and wanted the chance to be just like her. Her mother just said to accept it and she would try and find a way to tutor Alex. She said there was nothing waiting for them back home and America was not too kind to them. Alex spent her remaining educational years in no-mage schools, toiling her days away while hiding her magic. Maeve would try to figure out a way to ward a practice space so Alex could use her magic even though she was underage. She had quickly grasped basic spells with an unsatisfied hunger to learn more. Maeve would limit her magical training time, often checking the area to make sure they were alone. For years they lived a modest life. No pure-bloods, no dark magic, just a daughter and mother trying to get by in the world. But when Alex turned 16 years of age, her life changed.</span>
