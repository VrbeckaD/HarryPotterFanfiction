          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our tale begins near the Black Lake, two Slytherins Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy are on their very first date.</p><p>Scorpius asked, "Why did you choose this location?"</p><p>Albus shrugged. "It's peaceful, I come here to draw sometimes."</p><p>Scorpius smirked. "You draw?"</p><p>Albus said, "The Muggle way though, not the wizard way."</p><p>Scorpius gasped. "You can draw the Muggle way?"</p><p>Albus nodded and stated, "It's pretty easy really, my dad taught me." He laughed. "I'm much better than he is though."</p><p>Scorpius inquired, "Can I see one of your drawings?"</p><p>Albus went scarlet. "They're rubbish really, nowhere near as good as the famous Muggle artists. You.. won't like them."</p><p>Scorpius insisted, "Please show me." He added, "I promise that I won't make fun of you."</p><p>Albus sighed. "Ok, fine."</p><p>He rummaged around in his school bag and pulled out a notebook.</p><p>He tossed it at Scorpius and muttered, "I'm telling you that you won't like my style."</p><p>Scorpius flipped open the book at random and let out an audible gasp.</p><p>He smiled broadly at Albus. "This is spectacular, Al. Did you draw this after we first met at your house?"</p><p>Albus nodded and frowned. "It's rubbish."</p><p>Scorpius told him, "Nonsense! This is the best Muggle drawing I have ever seen. The detail on the face is just amazing." He grinned. "It looks just like me when we first met all those years ago."</p><p>Albus murmured, "You really think so?"</p><p>Scorpius nodded.</p><p>Albus explained, "I draw to express my feelings sometimes."</p><p>Scorpius closed the book and put it back into Albus's bag.</p><p>He whispered, "This, you, us; we should have done this long ago."</p><p>Albus agreed, "You're right, but fate happens."</p><p>Scorpius beamed, "Well, right here and right now, this is just right."</p><p>Albus was grinning from ear to ear as he leant in and kissed him.</p></div>
