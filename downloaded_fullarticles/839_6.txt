    <p>It was a day like any other in the life of Lily Evans. The sun was shinning, boys were running in the corridors to arrive to class on time, those that didn’t have class were in the middle of a snowball fight, prefects were taking away point for infractions…</p><p dir="ltr">- Evans!</p><p>…and James Potter was harassing her. Again.</p><p>- What’s the matter Potter? Are you lost?</p><p>- You know Red, you have a great sense of humour. I like that.</p><p>- And I couldn’t care less. What do you want this time?</p><p>- I would like to grant you the overwhelming pleasure of…</p><p>- No</p><p>- No?</p><p>- No Potter. For the 26<sup>th</sup>time this month, I will not go out with you.</p><p>- why not? I am charming, handsome, brave…</p><p>- Self centered, pedantic, insufferable, womanizing…would you like me to go on?</p><p>- I want you to say that you will go to Hogsmeade with me.-said James with his best impression of puppy eyes.</p><p>Lily seemed to think about it for a moment. Slowly she smiled a mischievous smile and she slowly got closer to James, who at that moment had a triumphant smile that reached his eyes. When she was barely an inch away from his face, Lily’s expression changed to one of absolute disgust and loathing. </p><p>- I’d rather die, Potter.</p><p>Then, Lily turned around and started marching towards the dungeons leaving a deflated James in the hall. Pity his deflation didn’t last long. Before she could reach the potions classroom, James Potter was beside her. Again.</p><p>- C’mon Lily when are you going to admit you’re dying to date me?</p><p>- When toads start dancing flamenco. And it’s Evans for you Potter.</p><p>And she went inside the classroom with a decisive step.</p><hr/><p>After six exhausting hours of class, Lily decided she better go to the Library to finish her homework in peace. She still had to do the potions assignment, the translation for Runes, the sketches for Care of Magical Creatures, the Essay for History of Magic and…</p><p>Something really strange made Lily lose her train of thought. Everywhere in the library (over the tables and chairs, on the shelves, on the floor…) where dancing toads dresses in Spanish dresses and in the middle of it all, was a smirking self satisfied James Potter.</p><p>- Will you go out with me now Evans?</p><p>With a frustrated groan, Lily stormed out of the library. Stupid Potter.</p>
