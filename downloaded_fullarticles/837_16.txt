    <p>It was the morning of the first day of school. Summer holidays flew by, as if they were but a dream. Quite a good dream, but a dream nonetheless. Albus was lying face down, deep in sleep next to Gellert. The alarm went off. He started, quickly turned the alarm off and went back to sleep. Nothing bad would happen if he missed the first few hours of school. They could do without him for a while. However, it seemed that Gellert had other plans, because not a minute later a hand gently shook his shoulder “Come on Al, time to wake up.” Gellert whispered in his ear. “Five more minutes” mumbled Albus and tried to cover his head with the pillow. “Come on Schatz, kids are waiting” His blanket was pulled from him unceremoniously. It wasn’t fair! Gellert was a deep sleeper, he wasn’t supposed to be awakened by the alarm! “Don’t want to go” mumbled Albus, curling into a ball around his pillow. “Liebe, I can’t believe that I’m the one saying this but - you’ve got responsibilities, remember?” said Gellert with a laugh. “Don’t care” said Albus curling to an even smaller ball. “Fine” he heard a sigh beside the bed. “You leave me no choice.” another sigh “I’ll have to call Minerva” a dead silence hung in the bedroom. Suddenly an icy glare of two bright blue eyes was fixed on Gellert. Lesser men would have evaporated on the spot but he only chuckled, folding the blanket.<br/>
“That is a low blow, really below the belt Gellert” said Albus while getting dressed.</p>
