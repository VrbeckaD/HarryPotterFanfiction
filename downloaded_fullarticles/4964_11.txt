    <p> </p><p>Newt sighed a breath of relief.</p><p> </p><p>Love England as he may, it was still refreshing to travel considering he'd spend, like, eight years doing it.</p><p> </p><p>He saw the tall buildings that marked New York.</p><p> </p><p>He had come, like many, to start a new life here.</p><p> </p><p>No offense to his family, because he loved them like crazy, but it felt nice having his own thing, being surrounded by people who looked at his profession with awe instead of politely nodding and trying to be supportive even though he knew they disapproved of it.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“He could’ve done so much better,” he’d heard his mother say once to his father when they'd both thought that he was asleep. “The grades he graduated with- top of the class in almost every subject, he could’ve been an Auror, like Theseus! He could’ve run for Minister! He could’ve done <strong>something</strong> worth while!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>He’d kindly refrained from reminding her that given the whole ‘Leta Lestrange’ incident that had happened whilst in his sixth year, he doubted he could’ve done anything of the sort. Granted, he had gotten some pretty fantastic OWLs!</p><p> </p><p>And whilst it hurt, it did mean a lot that they still smiled lovingly at him and nodded politely whenever he talked about the magical creatures he'd met.</p><p> </p><p>But that wasn’t the point. The main reason, though he hadn’t told anyone, was because he wanted to court- and possibly start a life with- Tina.</p><p> </p><p>Porpentina Goldstein, possibly the most intriguing woman he’d ever met. There were just <em>so </em>many great things about her. For starters, she didn’t hate his creatures <em>or</em> him, which was pretty much all he ever looked for in a partner. But other than that she was kind and smart, and when she wasn’t stressed out about his stray animals running amuck around New York, she actually had a rather delightful sense of humor. She was also beautiful in a way that most people would probably never be able to fully appreciate.</p><p> </p><p>She was the main reason that, when Seraphina Picquery, President of MACUSA, had offered him the job, he'd taken it.</p><p> </p><p>The job? He was being offered a consultancy job for magical beast related cases, as well as being put in charge of training some new recruits on how to handle magical beasts as part of Auror training.</p><p> </p><p>Aside from getting to do the thing he loved most in the world around the people he loved second-most in the world, his pay wasn’t too bad wither, given that he was receiving the salary of an ‘International Specialist,’ which he garnered was MACUSA’s word for, ‘we have <em>way</em> too much money, take it, it’s yours.’ But seriously, he was <em>never </em>going to complain about making 20 dragots a week. That was <em>way</em> more than his previous ‘4 sickles a week’ salary which had been bumped up due to a promotion after his book came out. Granted, he supposed that he would be doing a hell of a lot more work now.</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>Nothing could have prepared him for what he saw when he got out of customs. There was Queenie and Tina, bright and perky as ever… and <em>him</em>.</p><p> </p><p>A tall, dark-haired man with a fairly muscular build. He had exotic green eyes that made him look hella attractive, and he was kissing Tina.</p><p> </p><p>Lucas Fontaine, as Tina would later introduce, a nice, handsome bloke that worked in her division. He was handsome, powerful, smart, kind, charming… everything he wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Queenie had looked at him crestfallen, and he assumed that she’d read his mind.</p><p> </p><p>Not that this little mishap mattered, right? He didn’t come here <em>just</em> for Tina, he also had work to do and animals to restore to their native lands, but that didn’t stop how badly it hurt.</p>
