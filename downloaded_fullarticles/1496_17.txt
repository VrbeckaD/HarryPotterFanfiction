          <div class="userstuff"><p>The quiet.<br/>
<br/>
It's what I noticed first.<br/>
<br/>
There was so much noise-- Hagrid's hut burning, my stupid fellow Death Eaters shouting, Potter's petulant screams of <em>coward</em> ringing in my ears.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it was quiet.<br/>
<br/>
We had Apparated to a very remote safe house in the middle of a forest, one that only a handful of us even knew about. From the terrified look on Draco's face, he'd never been here before.</p><p>Then again, now that I thought about it, he'd hardly been anywhere apart from Hogwarts and Malfoy Manor.</p><p>Why I just stood back and let him become Lucius's puppet, I do not know.</p><p>I somehow thought that Draco would have more resolve.</p><p>I should have guessed that he'd rather die than disappoint his father, or that he simply never cared enough to look beyond the surface of his feud with Potter.</p><p>But what was done was done; there was no use dwelling on what might have been.<br/>
<br/>
Our small group walked through the dark woods for a few minutes until the small cottage came into view, barely visible in the velvety night under a crescent moon and few stars.</p><p>Voldemort would be joining us there soon; the burning of our Marks made that clear.</p><p>Once we were all inside, protective wards were set, and then the other Death Eaters tended to their wounds, grumbling faintly as they did so.</p><p>I watched silently, not volunteering to help even though I knew I could and blessedly, they did not ask for it.</p><p>They began to talk of the battle, and our losses. Fenrir's name came up, and out of the corner of my eye I noticed Draco blanch.</p><p>I closed my eyes and sighed again, realizing for the first time how exhausted I was. My eyes stung; my limbs felt as if they were made of lead.</p><p>I was getting too old for this.</p><p>Snatches of the conversation reached my ears, and the words registered in my mind before I could stop them:</p><p><br/>
"Well, at least we finally snuffed that crackpot Dumbledore," Alecto was saying.</p><p>Her brother, the insufferable Amycus, laughed in response.</p><p><br/>
"Yeah, Snape saw to that, didn't you, eh? How'd you learn to make such a powerful Killing Curse there, anyway? Blasting him right off the tower like that! Amazing."<br/>
I turned from the window wearing my trademark sneer, but my stomach was roiling.</p><p>The <em>last</em> thing I wanted to talk or hear about right now was Albus bleeding Dumbledore.</p><p>And apparently I wasn't alone-- Draco had retreated to a corner, crying softly. Amycus noticed, and laughed.</p><p>"Hey there, little Malfoy, your father wouldn't like to see his son crying like a girl."</p><p>His wheezy laughter spiked my ire; I strode over to Draco, pulled him up on his feet in one motion, and led him to the door.</p><p>Amycus inquired loudly, "Where are you taking him?"</p><p><br/>
"Outside, to discuss his manners," was my curt reply.</p><p>Their laughter was at my back as I shunted Draco outside, and quickly followed. The Malfoy heir was still crying when we were both alone in front of the cottage, the tears rolling silently down his pale thin cheeks.</p><p>I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and calmed my initial first instinct, which was to slap him for being insolent.</p><p><em>That's what</em> he <em>would have done</em>, my conscience intoned, and instead I said quietly, "Draco, look at me."</p><p><br/>
He did, hiccuping softly as he did so. I couldn't help grimacing, but I continued in the same tone:</p><p>"Draco, I know I am most likely sounding like your father, but it does not do well to show weakness, especially around fellow Death Eaters. You are not supposed to be upset right now and if you are, they'll be suspicious. What happened tonight was-- regrettable--"</p><p><br/>
"Regrettable?" Draco seemed to have recovered his voice, and it was shaking with badly suppressed emotion.</p><p>"<em>Regrettable</em>? You fucking killed Dumbledore! You--"</p><p><br/>
This time, instinct overrode forethought, and my hand struck Draco on the right side of his face, leaving a red print visible in the dim light from the cottage window.</p><p>"You watch your mouth. Don't you dare speak of things you don't even begin to understand," I hissed, and some part of me gained satisfaction from the way Draco's eyes widened in fear. Content that I had quelled any further outbursts, I returned to talking in a gentler manner.</p><p>"You chose this, Draco, when you chose not to defy your father, or your House, or me for that matter. You let your silly child's feud with Potter delude you into believing in the nobility of the Slytherins. So now you're carrying out your family's tradition of being a Death Eater, and you must play the part or the Dark Lord will end you for betrayal."</p><p>I paused, listening, making sure that Voldemort wasn't already with us. But my mark wasn't searingly painful, just a throbbing ache reminding us that he was near.</p><p>"You must know by now, Draco, that to the rest of the Wizarding world, we are as evil as Voldemort himself. We have shown our true colors; there is no going back. The life you knew before, the friends you thought you had; none of that matters now. You must lay low, and not draw any attention to yourself, because if we die too then Albus's death will have been in vain."</p><p><br/>
Draco had recovered by now, and was indignant once more.</p><p>"What, so we're just supposed to sit here and do nothing--"</p><p><br/>
"<em>Listen to me</em>, Draco. If you continue acting in that self-assured Malfoy way, you will be dead in no time. I am trying to <em>help</em> you here, as much as that seems to be escaping your notice. But I cannot give you the benefit of an explanation every time we are in hot water. I shouldn't even be speaking with you like this now, because He will be here any second. There will be times when you have to simply take my word, follow my lead, and trust me. Do you think you can do that?"</p><p>My tone had become a bit exasperated, and I'm certain Draco noticed, because he nodded meekly and uttered a simple "Yes, professor."</p><p><br/>
"That's better. Now then, we'd best be going back inside; they'll wonder what we've been up to."</p><p><br/>
Draco nodded again, and we started to head back to the cottage. I'd nearly had my hand on the doorknob when Draco's voice stopped me.</p><p>"Professor Snape?"</p><p><br/>
I turned. "Yes, Draco."</p><p><br/>
"This is going to be hell, isn't it?"</p><p><br/>
I sighed wearily. "War is hell, Draco. Surely you've read that?"</p><p><br/>
A smile flickered on Draco's face, and some part of me felt good that his sense of humor hadn't been quashed tonight.</p><p>"Yes, professor Snape, of course." He sobered then, and continued:</p><p>"But I meant, this. What we're doing. It's going to be hell."</p><p><br/>
I glanced off into the distance, and waited a moment before responding.</p><p><br/>
"Yes, Draco, it will be."</p><p><br/>
My life as a double agent had ended; my life as a refugee had begun.</p><p>I had traded one hell for another. And, as we went back into the small, musty cottage, I couldn't help thinking that this one was far worse.</p><p>Â </p></div>
