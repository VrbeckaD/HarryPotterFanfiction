    <p dir="ltr" align="left">It was a sunny, yet brisk, late summer day in the Highlands of Scotland on the first of September 1991. The trees were slowly starting to wear their orange and red, autumn hues and the start of yet another term at Hogwarts, School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was about to begin. If it was to be anything at all like the last one (and it usually was), it would be full of good for nothing little dunderheads, always making a mess of their cauldrons and making trouble for him in the corridors. It however, did not slip his mind that this year there would be a new celebrity amongst them, yes; the famous Harry Potter had finally received his acceptance letter. He sighed audibly. He wondered what the boy would be like; hopefully nothing like his arrogant jerk of a father…</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/>He quietly gazed out of the arched dungeon window, over the Black Lake, at the sinking sun as thoughts of Lily swam through his head, her glowing face, her long, soft, red hair, and her warm and gentle smile. A single tear rolled down his pale cheek; he would never forgive himself for her death. He knew he must keep an eye on her boy, she would want that and he would do anything for her, even posthumously, although he would never let anyone know what he was truly up to, especially not the boy, he had a reputation to uphold after all. He shook his head and snapped himself back to reality.</p><p>…Malfoy’s boy would be attending this year as well. What was his name again? Ah, yes, Draco. He must keep an eye on that one; the Malfoy family was full of dark wizards who believed in an “un-tainted” bloodline. Severus knew things about Lucius and knew that he still believed in the ways of The Dark Lord. Yes, he would have to keep an eye on him as well; the last thing he needed was for Lucius Malloy to be meddling in the affairs at Hogwarts, he thought to himself. Albus had also mentioned in the staff meeting last week that there would be a new Astronomy Professor this year. He had heard that Aurora had finally retired; well hopefully he or she would be more competent than the last and stay out of his business. This was definitely going to be an interesting year he supposed. He stood up abruptly from the desk in his study, at which he had been sitting, and in the same breath, placed his cloak upon his shoulders and was out the door. The sorting ceremony would begin soon and he had to make an…impression.</p><p> </p><p>The Sorting Ceremony was completed as usual. Another Weasley! Did they just keep producing offspring, he wondered; they must have enough of them now to create a small, ginger-headed army, he smirked at the thought. Malfoy’s boy was sorted into Slytherin of course, along with a few other hopeful prospects but when Minerva called “Harry Potter” Severus froze. Merlin’s beard, he was the spitting image of his father, he had her eyes though and this would both haunt and intrigue him every time he saw the boy. It was going to be tough to not see James in him and trigger his PTSD. Of course, Potter was sorted into Gryffindor, just like his irritating father, although the hat hesitated an awfully long time before making its decision. That was definitely curious. Quirell was being extra fidgety and annoying. What the hell was wrong with him, he thought? These were all things to ponder, later, when he was finally alone in his chambers with a glass of Fire-Whiskey.</p><p>Dumbledore, wearing his periwinkle robes with tiny yellow stars, stood to make his usual start of term speech and after saying a few words about the forbidden forest, paused, as Filch came and whispered something in his ear.</p><p>“Students, I have just received word that our new Astronomy Professor has finally arrived. Please join me in giving a warm welcome to the newest addition of our Hogwarts family, Professor Sarai Sol----“</p><p>“Pfhttttttt…” Severus spit out his pumpkin juice. A few of the first years that didn’t know any better sniggered.</p><p>“Everything alright Severus?” Dumbledore smiled mischievously.</p><p>Severus glared at the man.</p><p>“Yes, er, just went down the wrong way”, he lied while glaring at the group of first years.</p><p>Albus continued, “It is with my greatest pleasure to welcome Sarai Soleil, our new Astronomy Professor, who comes to us all the way from sunny California!”</p><p>The Great Hall erupted in applause as the old oak doors opened but Severus couldn’t hear anything, the whole room had gone silent, he couldn’t move, he could only stare as the great oak doors swung open to reveal a beautiful young woman with long, wavy, violet hair that cascaded down her back and large, almond-shaped, glowing yellow eyes. She was average height for a woman with a figure that may have warranted unwanted attention, voluptuous in all the right places. As she made her way towards the staff table, he could almost smell the soft, delicate scent of rose petals floating off of her skin. Her hair had gotten long since he last saw her, it just brushed the small of her back and he couldn’t take his eyes from there as she walked towards Dumbledore. It looked soft, so soft, he wanted to reach out and touch it, run his fingers through it and breathe her in like all those moons ago. He was mesmerized; it was only he and she in the great hall in that moment. She looked even more beautiful than he remembered, although, there was a darkness in her eyes that had not been there before. Time had been kind to her, unlike himself. She had the most radiant, genuine smile plastered across her face as she curtsied and made her way towards the staff table. She had always been such an odd girl (were those the same Doc Martins from their school days?); it seemed to be a Dumbledore trait, although she wasn’t a girl anymore, she had grown into a stunningly beautiful woman and he couldn’t take his eyes off of her. He hadn’t seen her in at least eleven years and he hadn’t embraced her in more. As she approached, roses and a hint of patchouli wafted through his nostrils and he instinctually breathed in. His mind was racing now, how could Albus not think to mention this to him. Had the man lost his mind?</p><p> </p><p>Sarai waited outside the doors for the cue to her grand entrance. Her palms were a bit sweaty as she was nervous to be back here, to teach actual students…. to see <em>him.</em> Her mind easily drifted (as it often did) to her first day here, all those years ago.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p>
  <em>The first of September, twenty years prior, was when Sarai first walked through these great oak doors. She was 11 years old and had just ridden the Hogwarts Express for the first time; something she had been dreaming about since she was a small child and Uncle Albus would tell her the stories of Hogwarts. Both of her parents were Magical and her mother, Ajna, just so happened to be a Dumbledore. Sarai was eager to hone her craft, an introvert, but extraverted around the right energy. At eleven, she already knew she was an empath and a natural healer. She walked down the corridor of the train and was drawn to the last compartment on the left at the end of the corridor, so she followed her instincts. There were two students already seated in there, a girl with long, beautiful red hair and fair skin, and a lanky boy with shoulder length, greasy, black hair. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Er…hi” Sarai said awkwardly. “I..is it okay if I sit here?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>They both looked up at her at the same time. Sarai stepped inside the compartment.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I, um, I’m Sarai Soleil” she said.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> The girl smiled, “yes, of course. I’m Lily Evans and this is Severus Snape, you must be a first year too!” The boy continued to stare at her but didn’t say anything. “Sev, be nice” Lily scolded.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Er…hi” Severus said quietly. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sarai put her things away and sat down next to Lily. They started chatting and eventually even Severus joined in. By the time they arrived at Hogwarts, the three of them were giggling like old pals. Sarai was so happy to have made some friends right away and hoped they would all be sorted into the same house. They weren’t, of course, and eventually everything would change, but there, in that moment, Sarai was the happiest that she had ever been in her life.</em>

</p><p>“Sarai Soleil!”</p><p>She was startled back into consciousness by Albus’ booming announcement of her name, and that was her cue. Sarai was quite surprised to open the doors to hearty cheers and she didn’t know what else to do but curtsy. As she found the path towards the staff table, she caught a shroud of black in her peripheral and immediately knew who it was. It took everything in her not to run to him and wrap her arms around his neck and bury her face in his chest. No, that would be inappropriate now, she thought, as the wells in her eyes threatened to fill. Instead, she stood next to Albus on the right and began to address the students, her accent that of what muggles referred to as a “valley girl”.</p><p>“Hi everyone! Thank you so much for that warm welcome! I don’t know what else to say, except that I love the stars and I am looking SO forward to sharing my knowledge of them with you all this term. I have a lot planned for my students this year and I am so stoked to embark on this journey in the sky together!”</p><p>The Hall erupted once again in applause and he could already tell that the students would love her right away, what with her cool, free-spirited aura and California accent, he frowned. Was she really qualified for this position? She travelled with a band of gypsies for most of her formative years for Merlin’s sake, or was this just Albus, up to something? He really wouldn’t put it past the great wizard. This was his great niece after all and perhaps it was just nepotism, he sighed again.</p><p>            “Hello Sev” he heard a soft voice behind him say.</p><p>His thoughts were immediately broken as he was drawn back to the present. He turned to the voice, glaring…”Sarai” and turned back to his plate as if he cared not to speak with her.</p><p>Sarai was left staring at the back of his long greasy hair, thinking, “Well, he hasn’t changed much.” She wondered if he had forgotten her over the years or if he was just too bitter to give her the time of day? She knew he had been teaching here at Hogwarts, Albus mentioned it years ago so it was no surprise to her that he would be here, but she imagined, in true Albus form, that he had “forgot” to mention her arrival to Severus. Knowing him, he hadn’t dealt with his past, only bottled those feelings up and stuffed them away somewhere. Probably kept them next to a bottle of horned slugs or bubatuber pus or something. Was he just going to pretend like he didn’t know her? Like they didn’t have a history? She supposed she deserved it after how she left him. She was reluctant to accept this job knowing that she would see him again but she also really wanted to be back here at Hogwarts. She craved the familiarity of it after all that she had been through. She continued to glance over at him throughout dinner but he never once looked up from his plate, and she wondered what was going through that brilliant mind of his…</p><p> </p><p>…Finally, the great feast was coming to a close. The house prefects got up to lead their students to their prospective dormitories; there would be new passwords this term of course. She had heard that Severus had become the head of Slytherin House and she felt a sense of pride at the thought of it. She turned to look at him again, but he had already gone. She looked to the door and sure enough, there were his black robes billowing behind him like a bat out of hell. She rest her cheek on her hand and sighed a long and heavy sigh. This was going to be an interesting year to say the least.</p><p>           </p><p>Severus paced back and forth in his chambers. This is what he did when his head was heavy with thought. Well now his head was heavy but his heart as well. He was not expecting for these memories to come flooding back to him. She was his best friend, all he had, especially after Lily stopped talking to him, and she just left. She left without even saying goodbye or giving any sort of explanation. He never made friends again after that for he didn’t trust anyone. He only fell deeper and darker into the abyss that was his mind. Spiraling into the monster that he would eventually become. Going to the darkest corners of his thoughts and seeking out darkness in others until he was in the clutches of the darkest of them all…but that was all in the past now…sort of.  How could she be here, he thought. This was going to change everything, how was he going to be around her, how could he speak to her when he couldn’t find it in his cold, hardened heart to even forgive her. He would just have to treat her as he would anyone else. He would be civil but not allow himself to actually form any sort of relationship. People only left him anyways, or he got them killed. He was no good for anyone, he thought.</p><p> </p><p>Sarai found herself in the dungeons after the feast, partly out of habit (she was a Slytherin after all), partly due to curiosity. She knew Severus’ chambers were here, downstairs from the potions classroom. She missed the musty scent of the dungeons and she could smell the faint scent of herbs wafting from the labs. Of course he would be the Potions Master here at Hogwarts. He always excelled at potion making and even came up with some of his own back in the days of their youth. He had always been such a talented Wizard and she admired that in him.</p><p>“Are you lost?” Said a deep, silky voice from the shadows.</p><p>She was suddenly snapped back into reality. Gosh he really hadn’t changed, lurking in the darkness, sneaking up on her and catching her off guard.</p><p>“Sev” she exclaimed! “You startled me!”</p><p>“Humph, lost in your thoughts as usual, Professor Soleil” he smirked, “you don’t get to call me by that name anymore.” And he walked off, cloak billowing behind him, leaving her there, jaw open and heart racing.</p><p>Oh, he was bitter all right. She could feel his bitterness cut into her heart like a sharp knife. She did deserve it, in a way; to leave him like that and not speak to him again. It was wrong but at the time its what was best for her fragile heart. At the time, she had felt as though he deserved it. She knew that being here again at Hogwarts with him, she would have to find a way to explain herself, to get him to let her back in. That would be her mission. She made her way up to the Astronomy Tower, where her chambers were, all the way, lost in her thoughts of the past that she didn’t even notice the pair of eyes watching her in the darkness.</p><p>           </p><p>It was Monday, the first day of classes for this term. Sarai was both nervous and excited to be teaching for the first time. Her father, Etoile Soleil, came from a long line of gypsy witches. They studied the moon and stars for centuries and were guided by forces far beyond the reach of the simple, muggle mind. She spent her earliest years traveling in the caravan with her Gypsy Family and learning the language of the Heavens. She really should be teaching Divination as a skilled Master of The Cards but that position, unfortunately, was already taken; Unfortunately for the students.</p><p>She was ravenous as she made her way to the Great Hall for breakfast, quickly scanning the room for a shroud of black. Ha! Spotted! He always stood out as he had a way of dominating a room without even saying anything at all. Sarai quickly walked down the rows of students, the buzz of morning chatter in the air, and made her way up to the staff table to take the empty seat next to Severus.</p><p> “Humph”, he scoffed! “What do you want Soleil?” he asked harshly, barely looking up at her.</p><p>“I’m just here for breakfast Severus, just like everyone else. That okay with you?” she asked sweetly.</p><p>“Humph” he turned to stare into his porridge, not eating it.</p><p>“Sev…er Severus? Could we maybe get together and talk later? I’ve got a bottle of ‘89 Elven Red just begging to be opened!” she pleaded.</p><p>“Are you trying to persuade me with libations, Professor Soleil? Anyways...” he hesitated before saying, in a voice that was smooth as silk, which made the blow feel even harder, “there’s nothing to talk about.” He then sprang to his feet and stormed out of the great oak doors, cloak billowing behind him.</p><p>When breakfast was finally over, Sarai made her way back to her chambers to prepare for her first Astronomy Class. She was going to get through to him eventually. They couldn’t go on this way forever if they were going to be colleagues now.</p><p>“Good Morning Professor Soleil” said Harry cheerily as he passed her in the corridor.</p><p>Merlin, he looked exactly like James, with Lily’s eyes of course. It was going to kill Severus to see him every day, she thought.</p><p>“Harry Potter, you look just like your father, I mean the resemblance is uncanny, except for your eyes, you do have your mothers eyes” she smiled back at him.</p><p>“I-I do?” he stammered, “Y-you knew my parents?”</p><p>She smiled down at him and nodded, she wouldn’t have him as a student until his 6<sup>th</sup> year, unless Trelawney suddenly gave up the Divination position. She was a hack anyways! Sarai pondered that and chuckled silently as she climbed the stairs to the Astronomy Tower.</p><p> </p><p>Severus stormed into the beginner’s potions classroom, for effect of course.</p><p>“There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don’t expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few who possess the predisposition (he glanced at the Malfoy boy), I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper in death…”</p><p>This was the perfect time to put the new <em>celebrity </em>in his place he thought, smirking his signature smirk. And he did just that!</p><p>“Note that five points will be take from Gryffindor, for your classmates cheek.”</p><p>How dare he be so arrogant and rude? He knew the boy would be just like his stupid father.</p><p>The students were now working silently on their essays on how to brew “Cure for Boils”; the quiet was a nice break from the mindless chatter of the first years. His mind immediately wandered to breakfast this morning. What was wrong with that ridiculous woman? Really, after all this time, now she wants to talk!?</p><p>“Humph” escaped his lips.</p><p>Some of the students dared to glance up at him and he glared back. Dunderheads! He easily drifted back into his thoughts trying to forget about Sarai, damn it. Still, after all this time, she had a way with him. He never expected her to ever come to teach at Hogwarts, after all he had heard she had moved back to California all those years ago and had been living like a muggle there ever since, not missing him, obviously. He really didn’t ever think he’d see her again. What would bring her back to England anyways and why couldn’t he stop thinking about her?</p><p>“Damn it, Albus!’ he swore under his breath.</p><p align="center">
