    <p>It takes Harry almost a full week. He’s absolutely sure that without his skills and experience in finding people, navigating bad neighbourhoods, and defeating dusty archives, he’d have taken years. Snape is well-hidden. Has been, since the trials after the war ended. Harry had gotten him off without punishment, but Snape never so much as thanked him for it. Not that that’s what he did it for – of course not.</p>
<p>He rings the doorbell, one hand on his wand, fully prepared to take a good old hexing for breaking wards or simply existing. The door opens instead to a haggard looking Snape. It’s almost comforting how familiar the sight is, firm sneer, lank hair, long black robes.</p>
<p>“If you wake him I will kill you,” Snape hisses, and Harry looks at his watch. Ten at night, alright, so he shouldn’t have showed up this late. He just didn’t want to leave it to the next morning.</p>
<p>“Good evening, professor Snape,” he says kindly. “I was wondering if I could come in?”</p>
<p>Snape rolls his eyes but steps aside. As Harry walks in he smells the familiar smell of long-term poverty. It makes sense, considering that the address is still listed under Prince-Snape, three adults, at the Ministry, but it provides uncomfortable flashbacks to the memories Harry has of a younger Snape. No wonder that all of Snape's professional information has no links to where he lives.</p>
<p>Harry walks into the small corridor, crammed full of coats and boots, using his well-worn senses to take in as much as he can without looking like he’s prying. The door to the living room is open. It looks clean, but it smells of dust and that sour smell of not being able to afford cleaning detergents. There are books absolutely everywhere, and they are clearly loved better than the furniture.</p>
<p>“This’ll take a while,” Harry tells Snape, turning to look at him. “We could sit down and have some tea.”</p>
<p>Snape huffs and walks to the kitchen, past the stairs going up to the second floor. The kitchen has a small table with three chairs, and is mostly occupied by a brewing station. The door to the yard is open, it’s a mild night, and Harry can see through the window the privy outside. There are two toothbrushes next to the sink. Harry takes a seat, slowly, keeping an eye on Snape, selecting the one by the wall when the other chair makes him twitch as Harry touches it. Snape gets the kettle going and sets up a chipped pot and two mismatched mugs on the table. The tension is so high that Harry has to stop himself from responding to the sound it makes. He fills the pot with water when it boils, then adds a bag of Stockwell’s. The smell evokes such specific childhood memories for Harry that he can’t breathe for a second. The office of the head teacher, the screaming children that are allowed to play outside while Harry is scolded for yet another thing that he didn’t mean to do.</p>
<p>“Not what you’re used to,” Snape smirks. It’s not a question, it’s a confirmation. It’s true, Harry has fancy loose leaf tea these days, that he drinks in the beautiful airy rooms of a renovated Grimmauld Place. He doesn’t even make it himself, he has three house-elves (that he <em>pays</em>, thank you).</p>
<p>“Let me get to the point,” Harry takes a sip of the tea, it’s bitter and flat. “I was informed that you have adopted my godson.”</p>
<p>“Your godson?” Snape’s nose wrinkles, his lips thin. “The paperwork said no next of kin besides a grandmother at St. Mungos, who I’ve heard is wasting away fast.”</p>
<p>“Andromeda,” Harry nods. “No one knows if she’s going to wake up. She hadn’t updated her paperwork since her husband died.”</p>
<p>“And you?”</p>
<p>“Remus and Tonks must have never filed for it,” Harry sighs. “It’s not uncommon, for it to take a while, and I doubt they were planning on both dying while Teddy was so young.”</p>
<p>“So here we are,” Snape summarizes, “an unofficial godfather, an unconscious grandmother, and two dead parents.”</p>
<p>“And a father,” Harry adds gently. <em>That</em> paperwork had been filed correctly. “How did you decide to adopt him?”</p>
<p>Snape laughs, it’s a harsh and ugly sound, “that’s none of your business, Potter, we’ve just established that you have no claim over him.”</p>
<p>Harry nods, then fishes out his badge from his pocket. “I’m not here on official business, but I could come back during office hours and ask then, if you’d prefer.”</p>
<p>“Magical Child Services,” Snape reads out, “the <em>head</em>, even. Did they make up a job for you so you could feel important?”</p>
<p>Harry bites his tongue, he knew this would happen, “I went to university for four years to become a social worker, then started the department after lobbying for it to be created all through my studies.”</p>
<p>“Our saviour,” Snape mocks. Harry takes another sip of cardboard tea in an effort to calm himself down. If he punches Snape he’ll never see Teddy again.</p>
<p>“I’m here to propose sharing custody,” Harry gets back to what he wanted to say, what he’s been rehearsing for a week.</p>
<p>“Should’ve come to the orphanage if you wanted him, Potter.”</p>
<p>Harry swallows. “I was in – I was on holiday. I was not informed of the situation until I came back. I would have, had I known.”</p>
<p>“You’re not taking him Potter,” Snape leans back, crosses his arms. Looking so smug that Harry wants to scream.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to take him.” Harry tries to keep his voice calm, to explain. “I want to share custody, bring him up together.”</p>
<p>“If you think for one second that I will be sending a child back and forth after he’s lost all his family, you’re insane,” Snape intones, slowly, as if he truly believes Harry is mad. He has a point though, one that Harry had considered already.</p>
<p>“Professor,” he keeps his voice down. Low energy, politeness, as he was taught, “I am offering for you both to move in with me.”</p>
<p>Snape’s eyes flare, he draws his robes around himself tighter, sits up straight. <em>Threatened. </em>“I do not need, and have never needed, the charity of Potters!”</p>
<p>Harry knows not to bring up Snape’s living conditions, but he’s itching to throw it all at him. Instead he goes with flattery.</p>
<p>“I know you are the only one that could help figure out a way to keep Teddy safe during his transitions,” Snape narrows his eyes at Harry. “I have a lab, I have the room Remus used when he was staying in London. I’m not offering charity, I’m offering <em>help</em>. I want to work together.”</p>
<p>Snape twitches in his seat, looks at something from the corner of his eyes, then back at Harry. But it’s too late, Harry sees the stack of letters Snape glanced at. <em>Cokesworth Development</em>. Snape saw him look at them.</p>
<p>“They’re not offering enough, are they?” He says, his voice soft. It’s the worst thing he could’ve done and it sends Snape shooting out of his seat, flapping like a deranged bird in his long dramatic robes.</p>
<p>“I don’t need <em>pity</em>, look at my fridge! Look at my accounts! I can afford a child!” His eyes flash dangerously as he paces through the small kitchen, motioning wildly with his arms. “You don’t – couldn’t possibly understand. I don’t have to explain myself to you!”</p>
<p>“Professor,” Harry leans back against the wall, and Snape rounds in on him.</p>
<p>“You can’t waltz in here threatening to take <em>my </em>child away because you’re rich! Because you’re a <em>Potter</em>! Get out!”</p>
<p>He pauses to breathe and they both hear the crying at the same time. Long, drawn wails, and hiccoughs in between. Harry stands up automatically and opens the kitchen door. Teddy is standing at the top of the stairs, wearing nice, clean, clearly new pyjamas. He looks miserable, but also healthy and safe. When Teddy sees Harry, he runs down the stairs and leaps into his arms. Sobs into his shoulder. Harry holds him tight and moves little circles with him, humming about <em>hello little one</em> and <em>you’re alright</em> and <em>I’m so sorry we woke you up</em>.</p>
<p>“Harry,” Teddy gasps finally, face still red, breathing still rapid. “Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“I came to talk to your,” Harry turns around and looks at Snape, “daddy.”</p>
<p>“Papa,” Snape corrects, looking entirely defeated.</p>
<p>“Your papa,” Harry says to Teddy. “We were not friends before, but when we are done fighting I am sure we will be and then you and I will see each other more often.”</p>
<p>Teddy nods, smearing snot against Harry’s shoulder. “You’ll take me to the zoo again.”</p>
<p>“I will,” Harry laughs, “I promised I would. Do you have any nice books here?”</p>
<p>“I do!” Teddy’s eyes light up at the mention, even if his face is still wet and blotchy. “One about dinosaurs! They’re like dragons but they lived super long ago!”</p>
<p>Harry looks over Teddy at Snape, and smiles at him. “How about your papa puts you back to bed with a story about dinosaurs?”</p>
<p>“No more yelling?” Teddy asks.</p>
<p>“No more yelling,” Harry promises, handing Teddy over to Snape. Snape groans as he takes the boy, and Teddy giggles.</p>
<p>“You’re so heavy,” Snape complains. “Am not!” Teddy laughs. It’s clearly a well-worn routine even after only two weeks and it makes Harry take a deep steadying breath. Teddy needs them both to be in his life.</p>
<p>Harry goes back to the kitchen and puts the kettle back on. It takes less than twenty minutes for Snape to join him again.</p>
<p>“Asleep?”</p>
<p>“Out like a light,” Snape sighs, “if only it were always that easy.” He seems to remember who he’s complaining to, and draws his mouth into a tight line again, sitting down with his tea.</p>
<p>“I babysit Weasleys sometimes,” Harry tells him, “they’re at their worst when they’re keeping each other awake.”</p>
<p>“At least they’re not sneaking around castles invisibly,” Snape tells his mug, and Harry can’t help but laugh. It takes Snape a second, but he does seem to realize eventually that he isn’t being laughed at.</p>
<p>“Professor Snape,” Harry tried again, but he stops when Snape holds up his hand.</p>
<p>“Just Snape will do.”</p>
<p>“Snape,” Harry corrects himself, “please just – please.”</p>
<p>Snape leans back, clearly exhausted.</p>
<p>“Tell me what you’re worried about, I’ll help in any way I can. I’ve fixed up the house, it looks completely different, you can have a whole floor if you want – ”</p>
<p>“Don’t presume to know my concerns,” Snape stops him, a strange look on his face. “Come back tomorrow at nine.”</p>
<p>Harry nods eagerly, already planning the owl he’ll send to his boss to ask for a few days off. It’s not like he doesn’t have a dozen or so saved.</p>
<p>“We’ll split costs for him equally. Don’t spoil him, don’t bankrupt me by buying him anything expensive.”</p>
<p>Harry nods again, that’s nothing he wouldn’t have expected.</p>
<p>“Now get the fuck out of my house, Potter.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Harry says, getting up, pushing the chair back in. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>He walks out by himself, closing the front door behind him when he realizes Snape didn’t follow him.</p>
