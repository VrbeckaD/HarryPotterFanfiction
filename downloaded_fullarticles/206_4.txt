    <p>He groans as he tries to get his suitcase out of the car, but fails once again. Giving up, just not having the strength today, he steps away from the old vehicle and with careful, measured movements, making him look and feel like an old man, he sits at the passenger’s side and leans forward with a deep sigh, resting his elbows on his knees. His whole body is trembling because of the slight effort, and he’s panting as if he’d ran five miles. He moans again, hiding his face behind his hands, not believing his luck. </p><p>When he received the Hogwarts letter four weeks ago he thought he was dreaming. Though he wanted so, desperately, he never believed for a second he’d actually receive it. The haze of the dream lasted for two whole weeks, enough time for him to get way too excited with the prospect of assisting Hogwarts, and to go buy all the equipments required, until he thought of checking the calendar. And he realized the full moon was at the night of the 4th. </p><p>That is, three days from now, from the Start-of-Term feast. It’s too soon. He’s already starting to feel the effects of the wolf, three days before the transformation. He’s sore, he’s aching, he’s got a massive headache, he’s hungry for raw meat and all that escapes his mouth are grunts. It’s too dangerous. He shouldn’t be here. It’s been proven time and time again that werewolves are unstable for a community life--and now he’s planning to live in a Castle, away from home, surrounded by hundreds of students, even during the full moons? Has he lost his mind? And above all, the wolf is usually more stressed in a new environment, so this first transformation can be hell. He could pick up probably any reason for not going to Hogwarts, not yet. </p><p>“Hey, Remus,” says his father’s voice, from some feet away. He shoots his head up immediately, never wanting his parents to see him suffering more than the enough from his transformations, but this time it’s too late for his caution. He sees the guilt eating them alive. </p><p>“Are you OK?” demands his mother, approaching him with a slight smile, placing a hand on his cheek, caressing it warmly. </p><p>“Yes, of course,” says Remus. His weak voice or his probably rather pale face, or both elements, don’t convince them, but they don’t say a word as Hope embraces Remus and leads him gently towards the station with Lyall following them, carrying Remus’ bags. </p><p>“It’s going to be fine, Remus, you’ll see,” comforts Hope in a whisper, despite knowing no-one at the station will truly hear her and much less, understand her. “The Headmaster said on his letter that he had sorted it all out. Don’t worry about anything except recovering yourself.” </p><p>“Well,” interjects Lyall, suddenly on Remus’ other side. “Don’t forget--” </p><p>“I know, Dad,” replies Remus with a sigh and tired voice. “Always keep my distance so no-one will guess my secret. I know, I won’t slip up.” </p><p>They’ve stopped in the middle of the station--not a very wise thing to do, being as crowded as usual--so Remus can look directly at his parents’ eyes making sure they understand he gets the seriousness of the matter and the need of silence and isolation from anyone in order to protect his biggest secret, staring back and forth at each other. Lyall drops the bags and approaches his son, who readies himself for yet another lecture about his condition. But instead of this, his father places a firm and reassuring hand on his shoulder and leans forward, so his eyes are at the same level. </p><p>“I was going to say, don’t forget your grades, and to have as much fun as you can, you understand, son? Despite everything, this is going to be the best seven years of your life.” </p><p>Noticing he has a lump in his throat, Remus can do nothing but nod before hug his parents tightly, for the last time, as his mother won’t be able to get to the platform 9 and 3/4. </p><p>“I’m scared,” he whispers, in his last moment of honesty. </p><p>Hope caresses his back, as she so usually does before and after a full moon, to calm down both of them, him and the wolf. “You’ll be OK, I promise, dear. And we’ll see you on the morning of the 5th, remember? Till then be the strong and brave young man we know you are.” </p><p>“I’ll try,” concedes Remus. </p><p>“Well, let’s find you a seat before you drop,” proposes Lyall as a joke, stroking Remus’ shoulder to reinforce his statement. </p><p>Remus laughs and resumes walking towards the platform 9 and 3/4, knowing fully well that as soon as he finds himself in a partially horizontal position, with his head leaning in anywhere, he’ll doze off at once. And he better do so, he doesn’t want to bat an eye at Hogwarts and risk missing any small detail. He wouldn’t dare, when everything will be so precious and, like everything in his life, maybe caduceus. </p><p> </p><p>************************************</p><p> </p><p>One mile away from King’s Cross Station, at one wizard house, the new student to attend to Hogwarts isn’t even ready to leave yet. </p><p>“I’m missing you already.” </p><p>“Me too, Claire,” sighs Peter as he accepts the third hug in a row from his cousin. “Can we go now, Dad? Please?” he begs, looking up, imploring, to his father. The man bursts into laughter, punching his son jokingly on the shoulder, with a hit not that much feeble. </p><p>“Eager to go to Hogwarts, are we, Pete?”</p><p>“Who wouldn’t,” replies Aurelia, staring at her cousin with an envy look on her face. Despite she and her sister did went to Hogwarts already a decade ago, the both of them look as if they would kill anyone--being Peter that “anyone”, on this case--to assist Hogwarts once again. He believes it, though doesn’t share the same thoughts. </p><p>“Promise you’ll write everything about Hogwarts. Every small, little, stupid detail that’s changed.” </p><p>“I will,” assures Peter, uncertain if he’ll be able to keep the promise. How could he tell his family that once again in his life he’s got no friends and will be spending his academic years at Hogwarts alone, all by himself? he just hopes it won’t be too hard to lie through a letter, riddled with unimportant rubbish about the school, subjects, teachers and Hogwarts itself. </p><p>“Have lots of fun,” adds Claire. “Oh, you’ll have to tell us if Prof. Minnie’s still doing that one trick at your first Transfiguration class.” </p><p>“What trick?” </p><p>“You’ll see,” replies his cousin with a big smirk, before bursting to laughing. </p><p>“You just try not to fall on the lake. You wouldn’t make that good of a first impression.” </p><p>“Oh, and remember every word of Dumbledore’s Start-of-Term speech. Is very, very important, and usually they ask about it in the final exams.” </p><p>“Should I take notes, then?” Peter asks, almost preparing to faint.  </p><p>“You’re expected to remember it all.” </p><p>“How--?” </p><p>“Oh, calm down, Pete. You’ll do fine, right?” interjects yet another woman, making Clair and Aurelia finally shut up. Though the venom in her sentence and stare is that much stern that doesn’t help Peter calm down a bit. </p><p>“Of course, Grandma, I’ll try to keep up my grades.” Given his academic records to this day, however, he doesn’t know how any of his family members believe this particular obvious lie. Probably it’s just that they’re granting him a wish--miracle--on his parting day. </p><p>“Come on, we have to go,” says his father, checking the time. “You’ve got everything?” </p><p>“Yes”, sighs Peter, thankful for the interruption and the excuse to leave the house. </p><p>“Well, even if you’ve forgot anything, we can mail it back to you,” replies his grandmother, practical, following them to the entrance hall, as well as the couple of cousins. </p><p>Among more kisses, hugs and tearly-eyes farewells, Peter can escape to the outside of the house and to the deserted street. He sees his suitcase lying on the street and finds it a particular good excuse to avoid his cousins, though it backfires in such an spectacular way he couldn’t even have planned it himself, as he can barely drag his suitcase. His father takes it from him, laughing once more at his weak muscles, though for once abstains himself from pointing it out. He just puts the suitcase on the rear seats, signals for Pete to get in and he sits at the driver’s place, Mrs. Pettigrew at his side, and after checking that everyone’s wearing their seatbelt, he rushes off towards King’s Cross Station. Peter knows the route and he barely notices the houses and streets passing by. He’s too concerned by everything lying ahead of him. His family doesn’t expect him till Christmas Hols, in four months time, but he somehow fears he’ll be back home way sooner than that. As in, this same night. He’s read all about the four founders of the House and he doesn’t think he fits into any of the Houses, and what if the Sorting Hat thinks so himself? Will they send him back home? Probably it’ll be even a great idea--even if he passes the test of the Sorting Hat, he expects to be a mediocre wizard, if nothing less. Probably he’ll just waste everybody’s time. He should just stay behind and save himself the humiliation. </p><p>He can feel his father’s stare through the rear mirror, but he intentionally avoids his gaze, afraid of reading on his face his same thoughts. Or embarrassment, humiliation, or something worse. He doesn’t want to see it. </p><p>“Pete,” murmurs his mother with a soft, caring voice. He certainly doesn’t want to hear it either, so he doesn’t even look at her. But he hears as her mother turns towards him and he can’t offend her like that. “We’re proud of you. No matter what happens, we are proud of you. Always remember that, OK?” </p><p>So at least someone recognizes the path of stupidity and clumsiness he’s constantly leaving behind and that can be foreshadowed for tonight and the next seven years. Well, at least he’ll have a bed on his own bedroom to sleep at tonight. </p><p>“Yes, Mom, Dad, I know. Thank you,” he whispers, without truly believing any of the words he’s uttering. </p><p> </p><p>************************************</p><p> </p><p>Back again at King’s Cross Station, at the other end where the Lupin’s got in from, another wizard family is walking towards the entrance of the platform 9 and 3/4, with determined yet calm and slow steps, shoulders back and standing up tall, as if they were literally above every person at the station --and both parents certainly seem to think so. Their kids, however, stare mostly at the ground and avoid making eye contact with anybody, same as their parents, but for entirely different reasons. They pour their status at the A-list from every inch of their bodies, wether they like it or not. </p><p>“Again filled with filthy Muggles,” remarks Walburga with venom. “You’d think that since year 993, Hogwarts could have another way of transportation.” </p><p>“Indeed,” agrees Orion, clutching his hands in tight fists, as if to stop himself from hexing a couple of muggles. “Or at least, change the location of the entrance. It’s a disgrace having to come here every year.” </p><p>“It’s safer this way,” retorts Sirius, tired since he was five with his parent’s stupidity. “A separate place just for wizards would attract too much attention. And you’ve seen the Ministry workers--” Impossible to miss them, even if they’re dressed as muggles--yet another disgrace, as Walburga has pointed out at every Ministry worker they’ve spot--when they stop and almost bow at them upon recognizing their name. </p><p>“Don’t answer to me, young man,” interjects Walburga, turning around and facing her son. He shakes internally, waiting. Obviously Walburga wouldn’t physically hurt him--too muggle-ish for them--but she’s got her wand very close. Though it’s a far too public place for hexing him. And that’s the only thing that saves him from who knows what. </p><p>“Let’s go,” orders Orion, grabbing Sirius wrist. He doesn’t struggle at first, but waits until the first sign of distraction, when absent-mindedly frees his hand and steps back, to walk side by side his brother, exchanging a look filled with meaning. Though Sirius’ eye suddenly catches something else, beyond Regulus, and she waves with a soft smile at the girl who was absolutely checking him up. </p><p>And obviously, the gesture wasn’t missed by Walburga, who’s stopped again in the middle of the station, fury hidden behind a well-achieved neutral mask. </p><p>“What do you think you’ve done, greeting an ordinary girl like that?” she shrieks. “You don’t even know her blood status!” <em>Her blood status</em>, repeats Sirius to himself. Not her name, not her age, but Walburga’s first concern is about someone’s status. He obviously learnt years ago his family’s obsession with pure-bloods, but it doesn’t mean it doesn’t sick him to death every time this subject reappears. </p><p>“She was pretty,” he justifies, shrugging. And for a second, he fears if he’s gone a step too further. Walburga wouldn’t actually mind if she had to hex to everyone at the Station. </p><p>“Young man, do you want to turn back and go straight home? I assure you, you can be home-schooled and you’ll probably get more education than getting taught side by side with half-bloods and mudbloods.” </p><p>Sirius knows better than to answer to that right now, but Walburga’s just put on the table his biggest fear and worst nightmare, spending a minute more than necessary in that horrible house, in that awful company. He couldn’t handle it; both him and Walburga know it, so the woman, pleased beyond anything imaginable, turns around and resumes her walking, with such an aristocratic air that everyone lets her through, and she gestures at Sirius and Regulus to keep up. They do so at once, not daring to infuriate her even more this evening, again staring only forward. </p><p>At last they’re in front of the wall 9 and 3/4 and they stop. Walburga and Orion have made themselves crystal clear that they wouldn’t join Sirius there and meeting who knows what kind of company and new classmates. That means he’s going to receive his ultimate lection at a more public spot, sighs Sirius while turning towards Walburga and Orion. These people have never been his parents since he’s got a sense of ration, and probably he’ll never know what a caring family is. If it weren’t for his brother, Regulus, here present, he would have left years ago. Even without a wand, he could have found his way. Living at the streets would be more comforting than Grimmauld Place. </p><p>“Now listen to me, you quit this whole rebellious teenage thing before you get on that train and arrive at Hogwarts. Don’t forget you’ll be known as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black and it falls into your shoulders--” </p><p>“To always maintain our family’s good name and reputation and act upon it”, finishes Sirius, as he knows was expected from him. But internally he’s just counting the seconds till he can drop the Black façade, leave everything about his supposed family behind and just, be himself and free, away from Walburga’s paws and wrath. </p><p>“That’s right. We’ll be expecting your owl from Slytherin.” <em>Please, not Slytherin.</em> Everything at view from him just screams of Slytherin, but his insides scream nothing but. He’d much rather be without a house and without a family, which he actually has asked for in the past--and what got him his first Cruciatus as a present for his seventh birthday--before he’d ever contemplate the idea of going to Slytherin. He’ll burn the Sorting Hat if he so even dares to propose it to him. </p><p>He doesn’t have any goodbye word to address to Walburga and Orion, so he ostentatiously turns his back towards them as he grabs a hold of Regulus’ shoulder, who’s been avoiding his gaze for a few minutes now. </p><p>“Come here,” he says, hugging him tightly. He feels how Regulus holds on almost desperately, not ready to let him go. And he fully understands. If he could just delay his departure to Hogwarts for one, miserable year. . . He’d be going with Regulus, he wouldn’t leave him behind, they’d be leaving that house together. He shouldn’t be left alone with Walburga and Orion. “Hold on tight, OK? Write me everyday, if you need to. I’ll do the same. This year will be over way sooner than you imagine.” </p><p>“The house will be too much empty without you, Siri.” </p><p>“I’ll miss you too so much, RAB,” whispers him, his voice hoarse. </p><p>After a couple of minutes, obviously Walburga finds they’ve been stretching on this farewell for way too much and separates one from each other. She stands in front of Sirius, in the middle of them both. </p><p>“Come on, go. Kreacher has left your luggage on the train already.” </p><p>Sirius nods with his head and he only looks at Regulus while he slowly walks towards the metal wall separating the muggle platforms 9 and 10. The last thing he hears--or he thinks he hears--from his brother is a whispered “Good luck.” Well, he’s going to need it. No matter where he’s sent tonight, he’s going to need a good Felix Felicis. </p><p> </p><p>************************************</p><p> </p><p>Back to the car park, another wizard family has just pulled over to an unusual empty space, and all three passengers get out hurriedly. Though the son doesn’t seem that much troubled as his parents, as he can’t erase a big smirk from his face, even while getting his luggage out of the boot. He seems eager to get his hands on his bags; which to a wizard young eyes’ is comprehensible when he catches his racing broomstick and has the time to mount it before his parents catch him. </p><p>“Not HERE, James, for Merlin!” shrieks his father. “Do I have to chain your broomstick to your luggage with a Permanent Sticking Charm?” </p><p>“Nope,” says the kid immediately, still haven’t learnt the countercouse of a Permanent Sticking Charm, as he dismounts his broom with a rather gloomy mood. But his father doesn’t let him keep with that for long. </p><p>“Well, let’s go,” he orders, a bit exasperated, leading the way to the station. “We’re late, as usual. James, why is it--?” </p><p>“We’re on time, Dad, relax,” replies the son, smiling broadly at the prospect of finally, at last, being on his way to Hogwarts. </p><p>Even when he’s carrying all his luggage, after a couple of minutes of hurrying through the station his parents end up getting behind, struggling to catch their breath. At one point, his mother simply stops and leans forwards, hands on her knees. </p><p>“I’m too old for these sort of things,” whispers Euphemia, grabbing her husband’s hand to make him stop too. </p><p>“Nonsense, you’re as beautiful as ever," he disagrees. </p><p>“One thing doesn’t exclude the other, dear.” </p><p>James, who hadn’t realized he’d lost his parents on the way, goes backward and finds them at this precise instant. Leaving his luggage aside, he approaches his mother and caresses her shoulders. </p><p>“Do you want to sit down, Mom?” he proposes, true concerned for her welfare. </p><p>“I’m not an invalid either,” replies Euphemia. “But you really should go, you’ve got only five minutes till eleven o’clock.” </p><p>“I don’t want to leave you.” </p><p>“I’m fine, James, really. I’m just old,” replies his mother with a smile, caressing his hand in return. </p><p>“You don’t look old to me,” says him. </p><p>“And you’re too considerate towards your old parents,” laughs Euphemia. “Go, come on.” </p><p>“You sure?” Despite his supposedly over confidence, James is just a little bit nervous to get to the Hogwarts Express, and he was expecting his parents to see him off. After all they wanted to be there too, being his only child’s first time on the train. But the age forbids from doing some things, he guesses. </p><p>“Of course. Come here,” she orders, opening broadly her arms. Without a second of doubt James allows both of his parents to hug him and kiss him goodbye. His father’s kiss on his forehead, however, leads them to another kind of subject, one that wasn’t exactly on James’ mind today. </p><p>“Dear Merlin, James, your hair. You’ll embarrass the maker of the Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion if you appear at Hogwarts like this.” </p><p>“It’s fine, Dad, as usual,” replies James, stepping away from his father and checking his hair, as Fleamont has tried to tame it a little bit, getting even messier than before. </p><p>“And as usual you couldn’t be more wrong,” laughs his father. “Have you put inside his suitcase the bottle of Potion I said?” he asks at his wife, who, despite everything, is smiling too. "He'll see eventually how he truly needs at least one bottle of that." </p><p>“Yes, I did, earlier this morning,” confirms her. </p><p>“And I’ve seen you and later proceeded to take it out,” replies James at once. </p><p>"That's why I obliged Modry to put it inside your luggage again," interjects Euphemia, knowing her son well enough to predict and anticipate his actions. </p><p>"Ten minutes before I'd find it again and, in case you tried to hide it for the third time inside my bag, I left it in Dad's cabinet bathroom. So it's definitely at home." </p><p>“Merlin, James, you just can't--Why won't you accept a bit of--” exclaims his father, scolding him and laughing with him at the same time. They can barely get mad at him, though they probably should have told him off from time to time. They’ve just reached an age that some things, as long as they don’t cross a certain line, doesn’t matter anymore. </p><p>“Fleamont,” interrupts Euphemia. “Before you praise James for something you really shouldn’t if we were somewhere close to responsible parents, there are other things your son could embarrass you with.” </p><p>“Yes, indeed, sorry,” agrees him. </p><p>He turns and looks at his son again with what he calls a stern and strict look, though if asked, James’d say that he hasn’t mastered--and probably won’t ever master it--the appropriate look of a father who’s trying to teach a lesson or prove a point. However, he grants him the attempt and listens to him, promising to himself, half-heartedly, to try to do as he asks. In this family, everyone has to grant something to make it work. </p><p>“Son, you have to promise us you’ll behave, or at least try to behave, at Hogwarts. We won’t always be able to handle your misdemeanors and quite frankly, we’re reaching our limit here. Please, don’t make Minnie send us any letter in the first two weeks.” </p><p>James sighs, knowing what they’re asking of him is a bit too much. But his own father, out of exasperation, has left a clear loophole on the rule, so he can take it. Two weeks is not that much of a time; and the rule implies a letter being sent to them, not any kind of misbehavior. He can work with that. Not like a man, of course, because a man wouldn't break his word, but at least he's taking it like the eleven-year-old troublemaker he is. </p><p>“I promise I’ll try,” he sighs finally. And though it’s not exactly the compromise his parents were expecting of him, they know also this is the best deal they could have made given the place, time and situation, so they let him be too, to go and enjoy his life that's just starting, and James rushes to the entrance of the platform 9 and 3/4, barely containing his eagerness.</p><p>********************** </p><p> </p><p><em>Crap. </em>Crap, damn, shit and a thousand times crap. </p><p>Why didn’t she check the ticket before today? Why didn’t she come with Severus? Why didn’t Severus tell her? Why didn’t she ask anyone before it was too late? </p><p>She’s frantically running up and down the station trying to find something which she already knows doesn’t exist, her mother and father following close by, carrying her truck, keeping their sanity just for her. Because she’s this close to giving up, kneel on the floor and start crying. Has this whole thing been a sick joke, from the very beginning? Was it just a hallucination? </p><p>“Calm down, Lils. We’ll find it.” </p><p>“How?!” shrieks the girl. “It’s not like we can ask a guard, can we?!” </p><p>“Hey,” her father rests a warm hand on her shoulders and forces Lily to turn and look at him. “Just stop for a sec.”</p><p>“I’m going to miss my train!” </p><p>“Just stop for a sec,” repeats her father. “Take a deep breath and try to relax.” </p><p>This is what her parents always told Lily and Tuney to do whenever they felt anxious--because of an exam, a break-up, or when their dog was hit and died on the street--to get them to relax. Lily nods, closes her eyes and breathes slowly, inhaling by the nose, exhaling through the mouth, and then counts to twenty. She’s just lost half a minute but at least she won’t suffer a panic attack right there. </p><p>“That’s better,” approves her mother. “Now, take your time and think again. Didn’t it say anything about how to access the platform on your letter?” </p><p>“No, just the number and the departure time,” repeats Lily, doing her best to keep calm.  </p><p>“And are you sure Severus didn’t tell you either?” </p><p>“You know what, Mom, as a matter of fact he did--we’ve just been wasting a whole hour for the fun of it.” </p><p>“Lils,” her father reprimands her mildly, but the scolding doesn’t go any further because the poor girl isn’t the only one who’s desperate in here today. </p><p>“I’m sorry, Mom,” Lily apologizes without opening her eyes. “It’s just--” </p><p>“We know,” interjects her mother, caressing Lily’s cheek with tender. The whole morning’s been a disaster, from the moment they woke up and Lils and Tuney had their last quarrel. Now, they’re beginning to believe everything’s been for nothing, that Severus was just lying to Lily--and that Magic is no more than an illusion sowed in their minds, somehow. They cannot say such words in front of Lily, but they fear she’s coming to the same realization they are, and the couple just doesn’t know how can they deal with it, help Lily and return home. </p><p>“Perhaps we could go to the car,” suggest her father very slowly, assessing how the words affect Lily, “and think of what we can do. Perhaps contacting the School. . .” </p><p>“Perhaps driving home and forgetting all about it is a better idea,” replies Lily, her eyes still closed. “Goddammit,” she swears as she dries a tear falling from her eyes. The past few years have been nothing but a charade, the whole school supplies was nothing but a mind trick--and the only thing it all brought was her fighting with Tuney, when they once thought they’d be best siblings for life. If she could go back in time. . . </p><p>“No, Lily, I wasn’t going to say--” </p><p>“But I am saying it,” interjects the girl. “Let’s go home. Please. Maybe they can accept be back at the School.” </p><p>Her mother hugs her by the shoulders and squeezes her tight for some seconds, praising Lily for her maturity while facing such a crossroad. The real breakdown might come around at home, or maybe at the car, but she’s sparing them all a tantrum right at King’s Cross station. On the other hand, her father kisses her temple and, without releasing Lily’s hands, kneels to grab her cart again. </p><p>“Excuse me,” says a male voice behind them, making the family stop and turn around--a teenage boy, taller than Lily’s father and with a shy smile on his lips. He can tell he’s overstepping, the glares he gets from the couple and the tears in the girl’s eyes are more than enough evidence, but still he had to speak up before it was too late and they made the wrong choice. </p><p>“I’m sorry, I couldn’t help but notice your trunk,” he says, addressing Lily directly. “Hogwarts?” </p><p>Lily’s heart literally skips a beat at that. She steps forwards the boy, in spite of her parents trying to stop her, in case this just means the ultimate breakdown for the girl. </p><p>“Yes,” she breathes out. “D’you know about it?” </p><p>“I’m a Hufflepuff,” says the boy, removing part of his coat so Lily can see the yellow badge on his chest. </p><p>“That your surname?” asks Lily’s father, prompting chuckles from everyone and all. </p><p>“No, that’s one of Hogwart’s Houses,” explains Lily without looking at his father. “Can you please tell me how to access Platform 9 and 3/4? Please?” </p><p>The boy can’t help but chuckle upon Lily’s desperation. </p><p>“Thought there was something going on,” he nods. “Yep, let’s go, come on, or we’ll be late.” </p><p>He kneels to grab Lily’s trunk and points towards the direction they must follow, that is, the platforms 9 and 10, which makes Lily and her parents frown. They’ve searched every inch of those platforms for more than an hour straight and found nothing out of the ordinary. </p><p>The boy stops when he sees the whole entourage following him. </p><p>“I’m sorry, but only wizards can access the Platform,” he explains, his voice truly apologetic as he stares at Mr. and Mrs. Evans. “You want to say goodbye now. And--fast, too.” </p><p>Lily doesn’t even think twice before turning around, hugging her parents and kissing their cheeks all in the span of a couple of seconds, without giving them much of a chance at properly giving her a farewell. Which suit her fine--she’s about to start crying at any time, that’s how nervous she’s been all morning. </p><p>“Love you. I’ll write home soon. Take care. Goodbye!” she bids farewell before following the Hufflepuff boy. </p><p>She’s not so certain a few seconds later, when the boy tells her she needs to run into a wall in order to access the Platform, though. </p><p>“How many times have you done this?” she asks, eyeing the brick wall with fear. </p><p>“So many,” promises the boy, “and I’m alive and well.” </p><p>“You sure you’re not in a comma and we’re not dreaming all of this?” she protests. </p><p>“Come on, we don’t have much time. Together?” suggests the boy, raising one hand. </p><p>Shakily, Lily takes it, grabbing a hold of her cart as well. When the boy starts running she follows his suit and after a couple of strides she closes her eyes. This can’t be any more stupid than trying to find a Platform outside the station--or believing that Magic exists. Perhaps a concussion will serve her right and prove that everything about Hogwarts is nothing but a damn lie. </p><p>“This is it,” says the boy all of a sudden. </p><p>Lily opens her eyes in fright. They haven’t stumbled against the wall, for one--and as a matter of fact they’ve stepped into a side of the Station she’d never seen before. The big sign hanging from the ceiling confirms her that she’s finally accessed Platform 9 and 3/4. </p><p>“Right, this is where I leave you,” says the boy. “Guess we’ll see each other ‘round School. Good luck!” </p><p>“Bye,” stutters Lily long after the boy has vanished. She’s still mesmerized by the magnificent train waiting on the tracks, the steaming machine, the gold and black and red colors. It’s like she’s stepped into another era. Another world. Welcome to Hogwarts. </p><p>At some point she sees Severus in the crowd and her dazzlement vanishes, replaced by anger. </p><p>“Sev!” she yells. </p><p>“Lils! I thought you weren’t going to make it. Where were you?” </p><p>“Trying to find this forsaken Platform!” she shrieks. “You couldn’t have told me I had to run into a wall?” </p><p>Severus freezes, mid-gesture of carrying Lily’s bags down to the last carriage. </p><p>“Sorry. It slipped my mind,” he apologizes. </p><p>“What makes wizards think Muggleborns will ever consider getting a concussion for slamming into a brick wall?” resumes Lily, all her nervousness and anxiety leaving her system in the means of anger. “Is this your way of choosing the students who’re apt for the School?” </p><p>“No, it is not, Lily--it’s just the way things have always been,” whispers Severus, grabbing her hand to take her inside of the train, looking for a compartment. </p><p>“Well, perhaps things should change! Just a line on the acceptance letter would have made all the difference!” </p><p>“Talk with the Headmaster about it,” suggests Sev with the hint of a smile. </p><p>“You can bet I will,” promises Lily as she sinks into the sofa, arms crossed, but incredibly relieved, more than she can actually tell. To learn that the past months, quarrel with Tuney included, had been a lie would have been a tough call to process. She couldn’t be happier to find out that Hogwarts actually exists and that she’s been accepted there--and she hasn’t even set foot in the School grounds. Finally, she lets herself relax in the compartment.</p>
