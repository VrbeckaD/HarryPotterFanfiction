          <div class="userstuff"><p>It's 1996, Bellatrix is gloating to the other Death Eaters about killing her cousin Sirius Black.</p><p>Bellatrix smiled. "And then Potter screamed, that mangy werewolf Lupin had to hold him back so he wouldn't run after him."</p><p>The Death Eaters laughed.</p><p>Voldemort said, "That's enough Bella."</p><p>The Death Eaters fell silent.</p><p>Bellatrix bounded towards Voldemort and grinned. "My Lord, if you wish for me to stop then I shall. I'd do anything for you, my dear."</p><p>Voldemort hissed. "Do not call me that in front of the others."</p><p>Bellatrix replied, "I'm ever so sorry, My Lord."</p><p>Voldemort ordered, "I'd like to talk to Bella alone please."</p><p>The other Death Eaters left the room as fast as their legs could carry them.</p><p>Bellatrix asked, "What do you require, My Lord?"</p><p>Voldemort whispered, "You."</p><p>Bellatrix gasped. "S-Sorry, what?"</p><p>Voldemort turned to face her and told her, "I've always loved you, Bella. It took me this long to realise it, I do not wish to spend another second without you by my side."</p><p>Bellatrix assured him, "I'll always be by your side, My Lord."</p><p>Voldemort insisted, "Call me by my proper name."</p><p>Bellatrix beamed, "I'm glad that you admitted how you feel about me, Voldemort."</p><p>Voldemort smiled. "As am I, Bella. Now we can finally be together in the way we were always meant to be."</p><p>Bellatrix smirked. "It's a crazy little thing, isn't it? Love I mean."</p><p>Voldemort agreed, "Indeed, love is a crazy little thing and that imbecile Dumbledore was wrong for a change. I can love, I just chose not to."</p><p>Bellatrix grinned. "Dumbledore knows nothing, my dear Voldy."</p><p>Voldemort responded, "I rather like that little nickname, but do not call me that in front of the others or they might become suspicious."</p><p>Bellatrix giggled. "Let them be suspicious, I want the whole world to know that we're a couple now."</p><p>Voldemort shook his head and firmly stated, "If the others know about us, it will make me look weak and I do not wish to look weak."</p><p>Bellatrix answered, "As you wish, but we can be a couple in private."</p><p>Voldemort nodded and inquired, "What did you have in mind?"</p><p>Bellatrix pressed her lips to his and stuck her tongue down his throat at the same time.</p></div>
