    <p>Another day, another Ministry party. This had to be the fifth one this year already and it was only August. Ever since the war three years ago, the Ministry had been keen to keep morale high and the best way to do this, so they thought, was by throwing a party every other month. They were usually under the guise of some fake celebration and usually named after a wizard who had done something or other. Harry had lost track of how many he’d been to now and half the time he didn’t even know what or who he was celebrating. All he knew was, as Kingsley had so politely put it: ‘all Ministry employees are expected to attend so quit your moaning, get your dress robes on and get yourself to the party.’ As the Aurors were so respected within the Ministry, it was even more important for them to be there, which was unfortunate for Harry.<br/>
Each party was the same. The same people, the same food, the same speeches, everyone drinking too much and then reminiscing about all they had lost. Same, same, same.<br/>
By the time he’d had a Firewhisky or four, Harry’s frustration was really setting in. Ron and Hermione had spent the evening together on the dance floor, Neville was attempting to woo the latest in a long line of women and there wasn’t really anyone else there that he wanted to spend any time with. His other friends had long ago tired of these functions and as they were employed outside the Ministry, they had not been forced into attending like Harry had.<br/>
As he sat propping up the bar, a familiar blond head appeared alongside him.<br/>
“Potter”, he nodded.<br/>
“Malfoy.”<br/>
After the years they’d spent tormenting each other at Hogwarts, there was still some animosity left between them. However, it had been a while since Harry had faced the fact that most of this was due to his own confused teenage feelings. Although he hadn’t realised it at the time, he was aware now that his Malfoy obsession was in part due to a long-lasting crush on the blond and, after years of bumping into him at Ministry functions, he understood that his crush had never really gone away. Instead, he would usually nod politely when he saw him, gaze at him for the best part of the evening and then go home and wank himself silly. In all these years, he still hadn’t managed to share much more than a few words with his ex-nemesis.<br/>
Harry swirled his drink around in his glass and sighed. “Look, Malfoy. Don’t you think it’s about time we put all of the shit from school behind us? We’re adults now and this is just really uncomfortable.” He looked at Malfoy, studying his face and waiting for a response.<br/>
Malfoy turned his head and raised his eyes to look at Harry. He sighed and shrugged his shoulders. “I suppose so. A lot has changed since then and it probably is about time we stopped acting like children.” He reached out a hand and Harry suddenly had a flashback to being eleven years old and refusing Malfoy’s friendship for the first time. This time, however, he took his hand, feeling the surprising warmth in the long pale fingers, and shook it. He looked up to find Malfoy watching him carefully. Harry looked him straight in his silver eyes, lingering for just a little too long before swallowing and hastily looking back down, releasing his hand again.<br/>
“So, um…uh…” Harry cleared his throat, suddenly struggling to get any words out of his mouth. What was wrong with his throat and why did it feel like it had a Gobstone stuck in it?<br/>
“Eloquent as ever there, Potter,” Malfoy smirked.<br/>
Harry chuckled, blushing. “Uh…do you want a drink?” he asked, gesturing vaguely towards the bar.<br/>
“If you’re buying then I wouldn’t say no. None of that Firewhisky crap you’re drinking though, I want something that doesn’t take like rat’s piss if you don’t mind.”<br/>
“Of course you do,” Harry rolled his eyes and waved towards the bar man, ordering two of whatever it was that Malfoy had been drinking earlier.</p>
