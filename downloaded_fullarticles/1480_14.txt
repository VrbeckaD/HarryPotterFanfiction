    <p> </p>
<p>The Dark Lord knew where they were hiding.</p>
<p>His servant had told him, and he’d raided the rat’s mind to be sure, the pathetic man still whimpering on the floor.</p>
<p>He’d thought about taking down the house with everyone in it, or striding through the front door and tear through the Blood-traitor and the Mudblood if they foolishly tried to stop him. But he liked his new plan better. After all, the only important thing was eliminating the child.</p>
<p>With a feeling of glee, the Dark Lord was gone in a twist of black smoke.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>James and Lily were curled up against each other on the sofa downstairs, Harry tucked in for the night in his room.</p>
<p>They felt about ready to drift off to sleep themselves when they heard it.</p>
<p>A sound like a window being opened.</p>
<p>They looked at each other, not daring to move, straining their ears.</p>
<p>Then the pulse of magic.</p>
<p>The unmistakable cold, slimy, rattling feeling that they’d come to associate with the Killing Curse.</p>
<p>They were upstairs in seconds, but they were too late.</p>
<p>Their precious child was still in his cot hugging his teddy bear, but staring blankly at the ceiling.</p>
<p>James heart shattered looking at his son, then again as Lily crumpled to the floor with a wail of agony.</p>
<p>He was still frozen in the doorway while she crawled across the nursery’s floor towards the cot, still crying in an almost inhuman way.</p>
<p>When she reached inside with trembling hands, lifting their unmoving baby to her chest, James broke. Tears streamed down his face and he took the three steps that separated him from his wife.</p>
<p>They stayed huddled on the floor, Lily clutching Harry in her arms, kissing his face and pleading him to wake up, James holding both of them in an embrace that was probably too tight.</p>
<p>Silent tears ran down his cheeks as she cried for them both, shouting their sorrow and denial into the night, demanding that whoever was up there gave them back their child.</p>
<p>There was no answer and Harry remained still.</p>
