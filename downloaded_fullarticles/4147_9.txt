    <p>“Could everyone who is not a bloody Auror, get the fuck out?”</p><p>Harry’s roar was met with some shocked stares and more than a few sniggers. There was a momentary dip in the background noise of spells flying through the air, before it picked up again. The accompaniment of murmurs of the gathered crowd now departing added to the noise and Harry Potter huffed in unconcealed annoyance and turned back to Rupert, who quirked an eyebrows and raised his wand.</p><p>Harry shrugged his shoulders, grabbing the towel off the bench nearby and wiping his face of sweat, pushing errant hair from his eyes. It never stayed in the pony-tail, and no matter how Hermione or Ginny tried to teach him, he never understood why he couldn’t get it right.</p><p>Then again, proper ponytail care wasn’t on his list of priorities for the past three years.</p><p>Ever since he’d returned from Ireland, chasing down various dragon tails and hunting for potential werewolf connections, he’d been the subject of gossip. London wasn’t the place he’d wanted to be for good reason; he’d long ago become tired of being the boy who lived, the boy who defeated, the hero of the wizarding world. Hiding out in caves and forests and mountains had saved him, for a little while. But he couldn’t stay away forever, mores the pity.</p><p>Now he had returned, along with Rupert his attaché in Ireland but since become friend, having been bribed, coerced and vaguely threatened by Shacklebolt to run the Auror training program for the next while. But the fame had been waiting for him, and far too many admirers. In the few weeks he’d been back, he’d gotten far too many floo requests, pink owls and rose coloured office memos to feel relaxed about it anymore. The fact that Rupert laughed at the unnecessary amount of gawkers at his training sessions only made him scowl harder.</p><p>When he turned back to Rupert, wand at the ready, he was halted by Rupert’s indication to something behind him. Harry turned, still frowning and felt an unusual skip in his chest.</p><p>“Hallo.” Draco Malfoy said, waving his hand once and smiling a snaky little half smile. He took a sip from a mug he held in the other hand that said “this could be champagne.” leaning against the wall like he had no intention of going anywhere.</p><p>“…” Harry opened his mouth to say something, but his voice has vanished somewhere between his brain and his throat. He eyed the man with equal trepidation and curiosity.</p><p>The sound of Rupert clearing his throat spurred him into action.</p><p>“You an Auror now Malfoy?” he said, only turning himself halfway, refusing to let the man see any more than his side.</p><p>“No. not at all.” The blond replied, again with the same snaky smile, head cocked and eyes merry.</p><p>“Then I believe I told you to leave.”</p><p>Malfoy sipped once more from the mug, his eyes locking with Harry’s openly. He took his time swallowing, then licking the edge of his lips delicately.</p><p>“No thank you.” He said simply.</p><p>There it was again, the hesitancy of breath, the brief stuttered closing of the throat that prevented his immediate answer from coming forth. He watched Malfoy’s eyes for a moment longer than could be considered normal, before wrenching his head and body back around to face Rupert with no more argument.</p><p>Rupert was barely smothering a happy, salacious little grin. “Oh really.”</p><p>“Shut up, or you will regret it.” Harry growled back at him. Rupert did, but his grin lingered until Harry washed it off with a Flooding hex.</p><p>Draco stayed only a few more minutes, before uncrossing his elegantly folded legs and walking out of the door, not that Harry noticed.</p>
