</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">As Hermione unlaced her ridiculously high-heeled boots, she smiled to herself. <em>It was all so easy, like taking candy from a baby</em>. She chuckled at the muggle idiom that few would even understand. She took off her gloves and set them on the dressing table in the darkly-lit room beside a few of her favorite implements. She would put them back where they belonged later. At the moment, she needed to head somewhere else.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione unlaced her corset and threw it on the chaise, taking a deep breath. She opened the bottom drawer on the vestibule and pulled out her clothes,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>thinking about what she would need to do before this evening’s guest. She wriggled into her jeans, pulled her jumper over her head, grabbed her wand and then Disapparated to meet her friend.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Emerging from the alley in Muggle London, Hermione quickly spotted Ginny scanning the street, her long red har was unmistakable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“There you are!” Ginny exclaimed as Hermione reached her. “I’m famished. Let’s eat!” The redhead pulled her into an embrace before turning to head into the restaurant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Sorry, Gin. I was held up.”</p><p>“Yes, yes. We all know there must have been a tragic literary emergency.”</p><p>Hermione laughed. If only her friend knew that not twenty minutes ago, she had been flogging Phineas Fernbank, head of Magical Games and Sports, as he begged for more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“So, how are things?” Ginny asked. “Been on any dates lately?”</p><p>“I’m <em>fine</em>. Thank you for asking.” Hermione rolled her eyes, knowing Ginny cared far more about the answer to the second question than the first.  “And, no. You know I haven’t.”</p><p>“Ugh!” Ginny exclaimed, throwing her hands in the air. “How am I supposed to live vicariously through you when you make no effort at having a life!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione laughed, knowing how excited Ginny was just to get out of the house for their lunch date. As expected, Harry and Ginny had married once Ginny had finished at Hogwarts, and shortly after, Ginny was pregnant with their first child. They now had two lovely children that Hermione adored. She was thrilled to be godmother to James and Albus, but she knew she had little to no interest in following in her footsteps any time soon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“And how are the two cherubs?” Hermione asked in an effort to change the subject.</p><p>Quick as lightning, Ginny pointed a finger at Hermione, her eyes flashing. “Don’t think I don’t know what you’re doing, missy. I may be sleep-deprived, but I know you’re deflecting.”</p><p>Hermione smirked, but didn’t say a word, deciding to wait Ginny out. It didn’t take long.</p><p>Ginny sat back in her seat, grinning. “Ahh, they’re wonderful. Tiring, but wonderful. Al is so close to crawling, and James, well, you can ask him for yourself when you come over for brunch on Sunday.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione smiled and nodded her head, acknowledging the invitation. She hadn’t seen the boys in a couple of weeks. It would be good to see them.</p><p>“My question still stands - when was the last time you went on a date, Hermione? You’ve got to get out there at some point! I mean, all the good ones are being snapped up. When you’re finally ready, you’ll be left with Goyle.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was Hermione’s turn to roll her eyes. “Gin, I’m good. Really. Not everyone meets their soulmate at the age of ten, you know.” Hermione retorted. She knew Ginny meant well, and that she was only parroting what Wizarding Society had taught her. But, Hermione didn’t need a date, and she definitely wasn’t looking for a husband.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“And besides, the Prophet reported that Goyle married Millicent Bulstrode quite a while ago.” Hermione sighed. “I’m barely twenty-six. It is so odd to me that everyone is in a rush to date and get married. If and when it’s time, I’ll get there.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ginny sat back in her seat, waving her hand. “Fine. Fine. I just want you to be happy.”</p><p>“I am happy.” Hermione insisted. “I like my life. And I don’t need a man to define or complete me. Really.” She realized what she had said, and hoped Ginny hadn’t made the connection to her own circumstances. She added quickly, “I’m happy for what you and Harry have. Truly, Gin. It’s just not on my list of priorities right now.” She looked down at the menu in front of her. “Now, what are we having for lunch?”</p><p>After another hour or so catching up, Hermione parted ways with Ginny, promising to come by on Sunday. She checked her watch, noting that she had enough time to stop by the bookstore before her afternoon appointment. She ducked back into the alley and Disapparated, landing in Diagon Alley near her bookshop.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Irrepertus was a small bookshop tucked on one of the small side streets off of Diagon Alley. She had been in the bookstore once or twice when she was in school, searching its aisles to see what treasures it held. When Hermione had first seen the for sale sign in the window shortly after her twentieth birthday, having spent the last several months applying in vain for ministry jobs she would never be given, she felt confident that she would be able to forge another path — one not based on either ministry patronage or marriage. The previous owner had ready to retire and was more than happy to hand the keys over to her — for the right amount of galleons. Once the transaction had been completed and she had moved her things from Grimmauld Place, she breathed a sigh of relief. The shop was something that was hers, something she could control and build up. The bookstore would be a haven where she could lose herself among knowledge — and for the most part, books didn’t care about blood status.</p><p>Even after the war, Wizarding Society wasn’t as kind to Muggleborns as Hermione had hoped. Sure, there had been offers to work with the Ministry, but only the kind that meant cramped offices, long hours, and limited opportunity for advancement. Unlike for Harry and Ron, the way hadn’t been paved for Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Wizarding society was still so traditional — ahem, patriarchal — not that there weren’t women working at the Ministry of Magic. However, a young woman was supposed to be focused on settling down, starting a family and rebuilding the magical population in the aftermath of the war. At least, that’s what several department heads at the Ministry had told her. However, Hermione had no interest in settling down for the sake of conformity — not that there was a line of suitors beating a path to her door, either.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She had expected her blood status wouldn’t matter after having fought for equality, but it somehow remained a barrier to equal treatment. She was the <em>brightest witch of her age</em>. She had proved herself against the darkest of wizards. But the two things that she couldn’t change and had no control over — her blood status and her gender — would continue to define her interactions within the Wizarding World.</p><p>Harry was furious for her, but he had his own vault full of galleons. He was also a man, and as the savior of the Wizarding World, he was going to be just fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>And Ron? He tried to placate her, explaining that she <em>just didn’t understand</em> and <em>that’s how things were done</em>. It had led to a strained relationship between the two of them, that and the fact that he and Lavender had rekindled their romance in the aftermath of the war. From her vantage point, Hermione saw Ron as a product of the broken society in which he had been raised, as were the majority of their classmates. She, however, refused to take part.</p><p>Initially, Hermione had been frustrated and angry and wanted to bring the Wizarding World down around her. She had given up both her childhood and her parents for a fight that wasn’t hers, for a world that didn’t fully value her contributions and didn’t want to accept her. However, she was also a practical woman, with a touch of Slytherin cunning and ambition to balance out her Gryffindor bravery. She decided that it would be better to play the long game, given how entrenched some of the backward ideals were in society. So, in the absence of being able to find a job at the Ministry that would hold her interest, she took what little savings she had from selling her parents’ house and bought a small bookshop with a flat over it. That had been over six years ago now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was a dream come true, for a while. She wasn’t trying to run Flourish and Blotts out of business. In fact, her shop specialized in harder to find texts than schoolbooks and popular literature. Hermione carefully curated a selection of Magical and Muggle literature for true book lovers. The result was that her shop had gained a local following, amongst those who read. It was enough. It paid the bills, but it certainly wasn’t going to set the world on fire and she knew there were those who wouldn’t patronize her bookstore, simply based on the fact that it was hers... a Muggleborn’s, rather than someone connected (even if only partially) to an old Wizarding family. Hermione had been frustrated by this, but had chosen to overlook the slight. Instead, she bided her time, throwing her energy into the shop.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Oh, society still lauded her as a heroine. She was trotted out with Harry and Ron on occasion when it came time to raise money for one charity of another, but only the Death Eaters had been punished for their actions and ended up in Azkaban for their crimes. Everyday wizards and witches were still free to act and feel how they chose, and if that meant politely smiling at her in the ballroom, but sneering at her on the street, she was supposed to accept their disdain and disregard it with grace. In her opinion, it was a load of dung.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Ironically, it was the Muggle world that had given her the means to find an outlet to address her dissatisfaction with the Wizarding World. It had been an accident that had brought her to this path, although she considered it a happy one at this point. She was comfortable moving in both Wizarding and Muggle society, not afraid to express herself in either world. She appreciated the freedom and anonymity she was afforded in Muggle London, but she was a witch, and wanted... no, needed to also be a part of the magical world.</p><p>Hermione found herself on a shopping trip in Muggle London, looking for a few items that would allow her to “take care of herself” so to speak. She had needs, after all, and she knew she didn’t need a man to meet them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She had come across the store several years before, after yet another date that left her feeling distinctly unsatisfied at the end of the night. It was a rather nondescript building near Shoreditch, but inside, it was a shop catered to the sexual needs of women: things to bring pleasure, things to make you feel pretty, things to experiment with, they had it all. This was an area that she felt Muggle society ran circles around the traditional values and practices of Wizarding society. She chuckled thinking about some of the people that she knew, if they saw her in such a shop. Ron would be absolutely flummoxed to even knew such a place existed. Ginny would probably be intrigued, and Harry would benefit from Ginny’s open-mindedness. The shop carried all kinds of things, from standard fare to the exotic to the truly eyebrow raising.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Her mission was simple enough — she wanted a new vibrator. However, as she passed by a sign tacked on the billboard by the restroom caught her eye.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Not afraid to take the bull by the horns?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Looking for confident women for a unique opportunity.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Serious inquiries from interesting women only.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She paused, intrigued by the wording, wondering what exactly it meant. It was vague, but worded in a way that drew her attention. It had been so long since she had had a new adventure — at least one that hadn’t come from the pages of a book. She was confident, for sure. But did she qualify as interesting? At least, whatever it was would be outside of the Wizarding world. That was a plus.</p><p>Hermione tore off the slip of paper and tucked it into her pocket, as she made her way to the front to pay for her purchases, deciding to ask the cashier about the sign.</p><p>The girl looked Hermione up and down as if appraising her. “Uh, yeah, I hear Mistress Margaret is looking for a student, but she’s really picky about who she takes on. She’s a legend, after all. You can’t get to be her age and not be.” She paused. “You can make good money, if you’re good at it.”</p><p>Hermione frowned. She wasn’t sure what the girl was talking about. <em>Mistress</em> was an odd title. What was she expecting, after all? She had no need for a madam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The shop girl continued, unbothered by Hermione’s reaction. “I’d be interested in becoming a Dom myself, but my boyfriend, well...he wouldn’t like it, having to be around all those men.” She leaned in, as if there were others around to overhear, “He prefers that he’s the only one that I tell what to do.”</p><p>Hermione’s interest was once again piqued. When she got home, she set the slip of paper on her desk, and there it sat.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Several days later, Hermione was enjoying a day out with Ginny and the boys in Diagon Alley when she heard the slur. <em>Mudblood bitch.</em> It was whispered just low enough for her to hear, someone knocking into her side and causing her to stumble. Her head swiveled to try and find the source, seeing Petras Parkinson, Pansy’s older brother, narrowing his eyes, as if daring her to say something to him. His wife looked apologetic and tried to pull him along.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>While the Parkinsons may have been smart enough to not be marked as Death Eaters, feigning neutrality, it was well known that they were staunch supporters of blood purity and all the ridiculous pureblood traditions that went along with it. She scowled, reaching for her wand. He wouldn’t get away with it. She felt Ginny grab her arm. “Ignore it. Not here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione knew Ginny was right, this was not the time or place to react — he was hoping to get a rise out of her. She scowled and turned from him, seething inside. When was the time and place that arseholes like Parkinson got what was coming to him? When was it that she could stop turning the other cheek? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>That evening, as she sat at her desk, she pulled out her mobile and dialed the number written on the scrap of paper from the shop.</p><p> </p><p>A female voice answered, “Yes?” She sounded annoyed.</p><p>Hermione began hesitantly, not sure how to start. “Hello. I’m calling in reference to the flier I saw.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“I’d like to learn.” Hermione answered with more conviction. She had nothing to lose here.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Hermione paused. How truthful should she be? “I am looking for a way to show that I am a force to be reckoned with.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hmm... and are you?”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“Are you a force to be reckoned with?”</p><p>Hermione didn’t hesitate in answering, “Unequivocally.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Intriguing. Come by 14 Selwood Terrace on Thursday evening at 8pm. We’ll see what type of force you are.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The woman hung up, but Hermione kept the phone cradled to her ear for a moment, as she took a deep breath. <em>Well, here goes nothing</em>.</p><p> </p>
