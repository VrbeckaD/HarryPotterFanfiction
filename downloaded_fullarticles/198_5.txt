    <p>Tonight was the night.</p><p>For what, Harry wasn’t sure, but <em>something </em>was going to happen. He could feel it.</p><p>After all of the lights in the house were switched off and the upstairs’ bedroom doors all closed, Harry grabbed his phone and called Hermione. She answered after the first ring.</p><p>“What’s up?”</p><p>“We’re going out,” Harry said quietly. “Come pick me up.”</p><p>“Or we could have a movie night,” Hermione suggested quickly. “I just got this great DC animation boxed set; have you seen Batman: Gotham Knight? Ooh, and there’s a Twilight Zone marathon tonight…”</p><p>“Spoiler alert: it’s a cook book,” Harry cut in, rolling his eyes. “I’m serious, though; I have to go somewhere, <em>do</em> something… let’s go out! Please?”</p><p>Hermione sighed in defeat. “Fine, I’ll be there soon. But tomorrow we’re having a movie night.”</p><p>Harry laughed. “Deal.”</p><p>When Hermione pulled up to Harry’s building a few minutes later in her ancient van, Harry was waiting out front, excitement buzzing in his veins. He was dressed all in black, with his sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and had thrown on a skinny metallic green tie he’d bought at a thrift store in a fit of daring. Hermione, he saw, was wearing jeans and a t-shirt that said <em>‘I Am Vengeance. I Am the Night,’</em> over the silhouette of a bat.</p><p>Harry pulled open the passenger door and jumped in, grinning. “You’re the best.”</p><p>Hermione sighed and adjusted her mirrors. “Was his graduation really awful?”</p><p>“I spent all day listening to people congratulate the Dursleys on how great Dudley turned out,” Harry groaned, “when we all know he had a tutor in every subject and had to be bribed to go to class.” He watched the city lights streak by his window. “Pretty sure they just brought me along to park the car and take pictures; otherwise they just pretended I wasn’t there.”</p><p>“That’s brutal.” She sent him a sympathetic glance before making a careful left turn. “College will be amazing, Harry. I’m so glad you’re coming to stay with us.”</p><p>“Not as glad as I am,” Harry laughed, rubbing a hand over his face. “Thank your parents again for me, will you? And get ready for a whole <em>summer </em>of movie marathons.”</p><p>They shared another smile before falling into a comfortable silence. Harry idly traced a design across his window, his finger looping through an unknown pattern over and over again.</p><p>“One more weekend, then I can move on with my life,” Harry said. He settled back in his seat and smiled. “On Monday, everything changes.”</p><p>~</p><p>After squeezing the van into the last available parking space, they continued on foot, weaving through the crowd that grew denser and louder the closer they got to the club. Harry’s heartbeat sped up when he caught sight of the Pandemonium sign, which bathed the entire block in red light. Grabbing Hermione by the wrist so they wouldn’t get separated, he tugged her toward the door, where more colored lights splashed out onto the sidewalk.</p><p>“I don’t know why you like this place so much!” Hermione bellowed into Harry’s ear as they strode into the club. “It’s so… loud.”</p><p>Harry laughed, the sound swallowed up by the pulsing music that made the walls shake. It was hard to explain what drew him to Pandemonium on the nights they could sneak away. It was… being anonymous in a room full of giddy strangers. Surrounded by trance music and lights and painted faces, he could forget, for an hour or two, how empty he felt at home.</p><p>Harry focused on the crowd, shaking off his melancholy thoughts. A flash of gold caught his eye: a girl was twirling her way through the crowd, her long blonde hair pulled back in a thick braid and crowned with flowers, wearing a gauzy white dress that floated around her like flower petals.</p><p>Captivated, Harry barely heard Hermione say something about getting sodas. He walked deeper into Pandemonium, following flashes of golden hair. The girl danced slowly toward the little rooms in the back, where small groups of people sat on metallic sofas and sipped their drinks. With a pang, Harry saw that she’d been joined by a boy with electric blue hair. She continued to dance as if he weren’t there, a serene look on her face, but Harry’s heart still burned with jealousy. Surprised by his reaction to the strange girl, Harry decided to make a graceful exit before he embarrassed himself. His seemingly enchanted feet had followed the pair of them to a lounge that was nearly empty, but before he could turn back, Harry saw something shiny appear in the girl’s hand.</p><p>Distracted by the way it reflected the rainbow of light swirling around them, it took Harry a moment to realize it was a knife. His jaw dropped, but before he could take another step, the girl had plunged it into the blue-haired boy’s heart.</p><p>Choking on the gasp that was stuck in his throat, Harry stumbled back, bumping into a tall lamp and nearly knocking it over. The calm look vanished from her face, quickly replaced by a frown as she glanced his way. The others in the room, a strong, stocky boy with brown hair and two redheads that had to be brother and sister, jumped to their feet and scowled at Harry, as if <em>he </em>were the one who had just stabbed someone in the middle of a club. In contrast to the blonde, they were all dressed in black.</p><p>The redheaded brother made a sharp gesture in Harry’s direction. “Who’s <em>he?</em>”</p><p>Harry’s brain was still struggling to keep up. “She just- with- and that guy-“</p><p>The sister rolled her eyes. “That’s not a guy,” she said slowly, as if Harry was incredibly dim.</p><p>The guy in question quickly proved her point, snarling and sprouting <em>way </em>too many limbs.</p><p>They group sprang into action as Harry continued to gape, moving like a well-oiled machine: the redheads cornered the creature and the brunet stabbed it with a sword he pulled from who-knows-where, and with a final screech the creature vanished in a puff of smoke.</p><p>Their task apparently complete, the brother turned to the group and said, “Neville, do a walk through and make sure it was alone. Ginny, keep the other mundanes out of this area until we leave.” The brunet and the other redhead nodded and left, sending Harry curious looks as they brushed past him.</p><p>The remaining redhead crossed his arms and frowned at Harry again. “You have some explaining to do.”</p><p>“Me?!” Harry looked between them indignantly. “You’re the ones who brought knives into a club!”</p><p>The guy looked ready to argue, but the blonde put a hand on his arm. “No one here can see us,” she said, barely audible over the music. “No one but you.”</p><p>Harry had plenty of questions bouncing around in his head, but her wide gray eyes stopped him in his tracks, and all that came out was, “What?”</p><p>The redhead, who Harry would soon learn was named Ron, groaned and pinched the bridge of his nose. Harry learned a lot that night: about the darkness that lurked along the edges of the daylight world, about these strange people who fought to keep that darkness at bay, and how his family’s secrets linked them all together. But what stood out to him about that crazy night would always be Luna, her long hair coming lose from its braid and her gray eyes shining, moving closer and saying softly,</p><p>“All the legends are true.”</p>
