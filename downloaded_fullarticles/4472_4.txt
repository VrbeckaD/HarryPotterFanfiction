    <p>It was only the third of November, and yet snow covered the ground and everything in sight. It was freezing, and the sun was no where to be seen, which you believed to be more than appropriate for the day’s events. You were glad that the weather was so poor. Not only did it reflect your mood, but it reflected everything that had taken place over the last four days. </p><p>How could this have happened? How could <em>he</em>?</p><p>You couldn’t even bring yourself to say his name. </p><p>You wanted to believe that <em>he</em> was innocent, more than anything. But Lily and James were dead, and little Harry was an orphan. Peter was gone. You and Remus were the only two left. Your family had been destroyed, and for what? <em>He</em> would spend the rest of his days rotting away in a cell, and you would carry on with a broken heart. <em>If</em>, you could even carry on, that is.</p><p>How were you supposed to get through life having lost over half of the most important people in it? </p><p>Three of your closest friends, who would never grow old by your side. You would never get to watch their hair turn gray and their smiles grow brighter with every passing year. You wouldn’t even get to see them turn twenty-two. </p><p>Your godson - being raised by those horrendous muggles. Would you ever get to hold him again? Tell him the stories of his parents, and how much trouble you lot used to get into back in the day? </p><p>And the love of your life…</p><p>No. That term no longer applied. You couldn’t bring yourself to give him that title, even though you could feel your heart swell at the thought of his storm gray eyes and kind smile.</p><p>He didn’t deserve it. He deserved for you to hate him. </p><p>But, you couldn’t. Even as you stood at the edge of your friend’s graves, the fresh dirt already nearly covered with snow, you couldn’t bring yourself to hate him - making you hate yourself in turn. </p><p><em>He couldn’t have done this. There’s no way he could have done this. He would never betray them. He loved them.</em> </p><p>You crumpled, a torturous scream leaving your throat as you fell to the ground, although you couldn’t hear it. You couldn’t hear anything. </p><p>A strong pair of arms wrapped around you, pulling you back into a warm chest. You fought, thrashing in the individual’s embrace, even though you knew who it was immediately. You had spent the last four days latched onto this person, their own hands grasping your sides as you both struggled to catch your breath in-between sobs. </p><p>Remus had never heard a more agonizing sound in his life, your scream causing his own heart to break even further. He didn’t think it was possible. </p><p>He clutched your wrists and pulled them back towards your body, throwing his legs overtop of your own as you continued to flail in his arms. He brought his lips down to your ear, begging and pleading for you to sit still; to just let him hold you. </p><p>The pain in your chest was far too great, and you felt as if you were suffocating. Your vision was blurry, and you felt a darkness begin to consume your mind.</p><p>
  <em>He didn’t do it, he didn’t do it…</em>
</p><hr/><p>Over twelve years had passed.</p><p>They had been some of the longest, hardest years of your life. But no doubt had they also been the best.</p><p>You had grown rather close with Remus after the funeral, deciding to move in together when you could no longer stand to stay in the flat you once shared with <em>him</em>. You had been staying at his place long before you had made the official decision, though. He didn’t mind. He liked having the company, and he liked knowing that you were safe. Remus doubted that he would be able to handle it if anything ever happened to you. He couldn’t lose you too. </p><p>It didn’t take long for feelings to develop. Laying in bed next to you each and every night, he soon began to create scenarios in his mind where he could pull you against him and cradle your body as he slept. Little did he know, you dreamt of the same thing. And every morning, you somehow ended up tangled around each other, neither of you being able to tell where one’s limbs ended and the other’s began. All it took was an ounce of bravery on Remus’ part, and a chaste kiss to your lips for you to be hooked. </p><p>You ended up getting married, on a beautiful autumn night three years after your worlds came tumbling down. The both of you were slowly putting the pieces back together, and your marriage had been the final bit needed to heal your hearts. Although they would never heal completely, you felt like you could finally catch your breath again - something you hadn’t felt in a long time. You finally had a family again -  family with the<em> love of your life</em>.</p><p>You welcomed your first child into the world two years after taking Remus’ last name; a little boy named Denver James. He looked exactly like Remus, but had your freckles littering his rosy cheeks, and your breathtaking smile. Not soon after that, and your little girl was born. Hayden Lily looked just like her mother, but had her father’s eyes, and snow white hair that neither of you could figure out how she acquired. You had the most beautiful children to ever grace the Earth. </p><p>And much to Remus’ ease of mind, neither of them were troubled with his monthly affliction. He had been so scared that he would pass his Lycanthropy down to your children. It took months of reassurance before he was willing to try for children. Now, he couldn’t imagine a life without them. Remus was practically built to be a dad, as protective, loving, and caring as he was. </p><p>Both of your children were truly the lights of your life.</p><p>Life was perfect. You couldn’t have wished for anything more. </p><hr/><p>Sirius couldn’t believe how easy it had been to escape from his cell in Azkaban. He couldn’t believe that he hadn’t done it sooner, although he knew the true reason behind staying for so long. He felt as if he deserved to be there - as if it really was his fault. </p><p>He shook the negative thoughts from his mind, focusing on his destination instead. </p><p>You. </p><p>It hadn’t been hard finding your address. All of this had been so surprisingly easy. He was in high spirits as he walked down the busy streets of London, having just seen Harry off at the Leaky Cauldron, having stowed himself away on the knight bus in order to make sure his godson was safe. </p><p>He ducked into an empty alleyway, transforming back into his human form for the first time since his escape. Popping his neck, he leaned against the brick wall for a moment, preparing himself for what he was about to do. He couldn’t help but wonder if he was doing the right thing by going to see you. Sirius was sure that you wanted nothing to do with him. Would you even spare him a moment to hear him out? Or would you simply turn him back over to the dementors? </p><p>Whatever the outcome, it didn’t matter. He just had to see you.</p><p>As he apparated into your driveway, he felt his stomach flip with nerves. It had been so long since he had last seen you. Would you still look the same? Maybe you cut your hair, and dyed it a different color. He hoped your smile was still the same, and not broken as he had imagined whenever he lay in his cell at night, unable to sleep. Broken, because of him.</p><p>Sirius was trying to gather the courage to make his way up to your door and knock, but before he could muster up that kind of bravery, a soft voice spoke up from behind him. </p><p>A voice that he instantly recognized.</p><p>“Can I help you?” </p>
