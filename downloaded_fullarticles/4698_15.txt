  <b>August, 2000</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“It still hasn't really hit me,” Sirius said. He pushed James down against the side of the broken sofa so he could lean against him.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“That's because you haven't stopped being stoned since graduation day,” James said. “Sober up and you'll feel better.” James rifled his hair and Sirius practically snuggled backward into him.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Are you two about to make out again?” Pete asked from the giant recliner with the stuffing sticking out.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“You do know that never happened,” James said.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Sirius stuck out his tongue at Pete. “I would if James would have me. All of you should take a hit.” He gestured to the little box on the table, half open, that held his pot.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“I can't,” Pete said. “I have a job to go to.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“In a week!” Sirius said.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“What if they drug test?” Pete asked. “You don't know what it's like since you got that stupid money from your uncle, Sirius. Some of us have to make our own futures and… You know what? Fuck this. I told my mom I'd come home for the weekend anyway.” Pete stood up abruptly and walked out.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Oh my God, what the fuck was that about?” Sirius asked, reaching for the bong. “You may think I'm too stoned, but I'm not stoned enough for Pete's drama.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“His dad's out of work again. I think things have been strained. He told me the other day that he was hoping to get a job with this investment place right out of college.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Sirius snorted. “In four years. Try having no parents to go back to.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“You've got my Mum and Dad, though I think they might go back to England.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Sirius liked when James called his parents Sirius's family too. His mother had once told him to call her “mum” which was funny and British on his tongue, almost like a better mother, much better than his own. Still, he didn't like mooching. He lit the bong and took a hit, feeling the waves of relaxation run through him, letting everything slide away.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Wait, what?”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>James leaned on the foot of the sofa and tilted his head back. “I think they miss all their old friends. It's like, this tight knit Indian thing they had there. Or, we had, I guess. Anyway, you heard Dad telling us all about the deal for his company being sold.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Oh yeah.” Sirius sort of remembered that.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“And you know you're lucky, getting this place from your uncle and that money. Plus, there's college! We won't be far. You'll join the real world yet.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Sirius groaned. “I'd rather, I don't know, be somewhere outside of time. Outside of whatever bullshit is making Pete act like a dick. Outside of real world, whatever the fuck that means.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“There's nowhere like that, Sirius,” James said.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Sirius stared at his friend. His glasses were askew and his black hair was a mess. A slightly worn Radiohead T-shirt hung off his skinny frame. He was completely perfect. Sirius knew that James was straight, and his love for him was beyond that anyway. He was like a brother, though thinking about brothers was too painful. He was like something deeper than a brother, whatever that was. Sirius tried to pull his head out of wherever it had gone. Probably to that place outside time. He always got too maudlin about James when he was stoned.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Yeah, I know. We're all stuck here in the broken, shitty real world where parents fuck you over and death happens and love is for other people.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Oh, come on, Sirius. It's not that bad.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Time keeps marching on.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Did I mention you need to lay off the pot, just, like a little bit?”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Come to the show with me tomorrow night in Northampton?”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“I'm not going to go see whatever weird band you're seeing.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“They're a local ska band.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Ska? Punk or whatever you call it now isn't my thing, Sirius. Aren't you meeting Fabian and Gideon anyway?”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>He shrugged. “Yeah. You could still come.” He knew he sounded a little desperate, but there was something about this summer he was desperate to hold onto. As much as he had hated some things about Hogwarts, it was all ending. Pete had his very important internship. James was in love. School was over. Who knew what came next. Was it any wonder he wanted that place outside time? The future was so uncertain.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Can't. Lily and I have plans all day. We're supposed to have brunch with her sister and her boyfriend.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“That's not plans. That's torture by townies. God, you're so whipped.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“And happy to be.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“That's only in the morning.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“I'm sure we'll find a way to amuse ourselves later, especially if you're not here.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Hey, this is my bachelor pad!”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Some bachelor pad.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Sirius looked around his apartment. The industrial roots of the space were obvious. It had been the offices for the old factory his family had once owned. Minimal work had been done to spruce it up, but Sirius didn't mind. It let him stay in Meade for the summer before college without feeling like he was intruding at James's parents house in Cambridge. And it gave James and Pete somewhere to hang out. “It's retro chic.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Ha,” James said. </b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Ha yourself.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“You're too stoned to even have a comeback.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Like ha was so witty.”</b>
</p><p>
  <b>“Ha ha,” James said slowly, his faded British accent coming out more than usual.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Sirius reached up and grabbed a cushion from the sofa and knocked him with it.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>James, taking up the challenge, grabbed the other cushion and slammed him back, hard. James played lacrosse and his muscles were always strong. Soon they were wrestling each other to the ground, laughing, trading insults.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>If this wasn't that perfect world outside the real one that Sirius hoped for, he wasn't even sure what was.<br/>

  <em>Retrial Season Three</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em></em>
</p><p>
  <em>(sparse piano music)</em>
</p><p>
  <em>(woman's voice) I hardly saw his face.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>(man's voice) ...and then he says, I can do whatever I want. I'm bigger than Jesus in this county.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>(another man's voice) ...have you ever heard of a case where the judge did something like that?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>(another woman's voice) ...his brother should be in there with him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>(another man's voice) I swear to God, I'm innocent.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>(musical interlude)</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Remus Lupin: This is Retrial, a podcast about the justice system. Each season on Retrial, we choose a case of someone in prison who proclaims their innocence and explore the crime they were convicted of. This season, the case of Rodolphus Lestrange, convicted in the kidnapping and rape of Alice Longbottom five years ago in the town of Hog's Neck, North Carolina.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Announcer's Voice: Episode One.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Remus: First, I have to explain how I first learned about Rodolphus's case.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Older woman's voice: (over a crackly connection) So if you could get on down here and do some investigating like you did before, I think if anyone could prove there was something fishy out this here case, it would be you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Remus: I get a lot of calls and emails about cases, but rarely is anyone as persistent as Augusta Longbottom, the mother-in-law of the victim in the case.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Augusta: Because there ain't no way he done that alone. And he's in there saying he's innocent, but he's protecting his brother. And people are letting him get away with it. They keep saying he's wrongly imprisoned and it ain't right.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Remus: Augusta had a quite a tale to tell and once I'd heard pieces of it through her emails and messages, I became intrigued. Not only did she not think Rodolphus Lestrange was guilty, but she felt that his imprisonment wasn't enough, not if many people in their town believed he was innocent...<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Remus looked down at his notes for the various potential season four projects. The truth was that he couldn't seem to get excited about any of them in particular. This was going on five years of just being immersed in criminals and prisons. Maybe it was getting to him. Two years of doing a deep dive on crimes that had turned out to be worse than they originally thought had also done a number. He had started out thinking he was going to be doing the innocence thing.</p><p>“Hola, chavo. You look like you've gone all broody again.” Gabby leaned on the wall just outside his office, poking her head in. </p><p>Remus shrugged. “You finish up the work for that food podcast?”</p><p>“Yes, and now I'm hungry, thanks so much for that.”</p><p>That elicited a smile. Gabby was his favorite person at work and the first person he had ever hired. The minute she had come into the interview, round face and curly brown hair and bits of Spanish slipping out, he knew they'd be kindred spirits. She was as much a friend as an employee at this point.</p><p>“I think you should do the prep school murder,” Gabby said.</p><p>“Huh.”</p><p>“I know you want to.”</p><p>“Do I?” Remus looked down at his notebook again.</p><p>“Don't you?” she countered.</p><p>“What I want is to do something that touches on prison overcrowding or private prisons or mental illness or illness in general in prison. Getting adequate HIV treatment in prison is still a problem, for example.”</p><p>Gabby came all the way into the office and sat in the chair opposite his desk. “Obviously HIV treatment is close to your heart. But stop treating it like a checklist. I know you want to do this story.”</p><p>“I don't want to defend some white, overprivileged prep school bro who thought he was above the law.” Remus scowled. There it was. Gabby was right. He was drawn to the case. But it didn't fit any of the things he felt he should be looking into. The printout from the old newspaper article was sitting on top of the file and he pulled it toward him across the strewn papers. His desk was usually neat, but he'd been worn out lately, trying to produce another podcast, doing new media talks, mentoring a couple of new interns, and coming down to the deadline to really commit himself to a new story for the next season. Sirius Black looked out from his mug shot that headed the story. Something about the young man's pale, shocked face and wild, black hair compelled Remus. He wondered what the man looked like now, after years of prison.</p><p>“You don't have to defend him,” Gabby argued. “I know you want to do another actually innocent prisoner, but it'll happen eventually. You can't know if he's innocent or not until we've done the work. And even then, you probably won't know for sure.”</p><p>Remus knew she was right. He still felt victimized by Rodolphus having made him question his guilt for even a minute, especially after having found all the evidence later that things were even worse. Something about that experience had him still feeling dirty. It had been their most popular season to date, but uncovering what had turned out to be a brother serial killer team when they had thought they were investigating a single rape, had made the whole world seem darker to Remus. “I know,” he snapped.</p><p>“And let me just reframe that whole narrative,” Gabby said. “He was an outcast queer kid who got pegged with a murder by a homophobic small town cop who couldn't understand that his bromance with his straight best friend was platonic.”</p><p>“Maybe.” Gabby was good at swaying him.</p><p>“And as for prison issues, you're going to find those anywhere. There's not a single prison in America that's going to be devoid of the kind of bullshit that you find in prisons. He's only an hour or so away. Go see him. Get the lowdown. Make the call.”</p><p>Remus looked at the mess on his desk. “You're right, of course.”</p><p>“Por supuesto, chavo. You know it.”</p><p>Remus sighed.</p><p>“And in the meantime, come out and dance with me and Jen tomorrow. We'll be your lesbian wingmen and get you laid.”</p><p>“I'm reporting you for inappropriate sexual talk in the workplace,” Remus said sternly, then added, “Ask me again next week when I've figured this out and gotten some rest.”</p><p>Gabby stood up, smiling. “Glad I could help, boss.”</p><p>Remus looked at the photos he had of Sirius Black again. The mug shot was a young man, barely more than a boy, looking like a deer in the headlights. One of the newspaper printouts he had showed him just before his graduation from prep school, his arm around his two best friends, his face lit up with laughter and joy, the other two young men looking on with a sense of loving exasperation.</p><p>Remus hadn't had a great adolescence. For a moment, he imagined himself there with them, Sirius's arm around him instead of his murdered best friend. He shook off the feeling. Gabby was right. His gut was telling him to do this story, but his gut was flawed, maybe even twisted. The man was likely a murderer. He would just have to keep his distance if they ended up doing the story.</p>
