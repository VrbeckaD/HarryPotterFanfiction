    <p> </p><p>Two weeks after what was already being called 'The Battle of Hogwarts,' the ghost of his old house elf, Dobby, appeared at the foot of his bed, and Draco Malfoy swore off pixie-dust for the umpteenth time.</p><p>"... and I'll never drink again, either - or never mix drugs and drink, that is, at least not before noon. Unless it's champagne, because champagne's perfectly acceptable for mornings, with all the bubbles taking up space, it can hardly be considered real 'drinking,' now can it? - don't <em>judge</em> me, Dobby. You don't know how difficult it is to be me, right now." With speech came a gradual semblance of clarity, even if his vision seemed to be a bit off. "Hey, how come I can see right through you? Are you astral projecting? Is this what happens when house elves splinch themselves? Did you leave your entire body behind?"</p><p>Dobby gazed mournfully at him, twisting an ugly orange bobble hat in his hands, as if he'd always suspected young master Draco of not being quite right in the head.</p><p>"Dobby is not splinched, Draco Malfoy," said the elf. "Dobby is <em>dead</em>."</p><p>"What? Since when? How come nobody told me?"</p><p>"Only a good wizard like noble Harry Potter cares when a house elf falls. Noble Harry Potter is a kind wizard is cares for all creatures small and smallest. Great and powerful Harry Potter-"</p><p>"All right, all right, and he's got a huge knob, too," muttered Draco. "Wait, but how did Potter know <em>you</em>, Dobby? I never invited Potter to stay-"</p><p>There had been that awful incident with the snatchers when the Dark Lord had wanted Draco to identify the lot of them, but the Dark Lord had been so horrible, and Aunt Bella so in<em>sane</em>, and there had been shouting and fighting, and then the speccy git had stolen Draco's wand in the thick of things. It was just one more seering humiliation on a charnel heap of horrors that had been the last couple of years that it all just blurred together. He'd sooner forget it all. That was what the drinking was for. And the drugs.</p><p>Although, come to think of it, hadn't he seen <em>Dobby</em> run in and out in the midst of that fight? Had he been caught in the crossfire, the foolish thing?</p><p>"What did you go and get yourself killed for, Dobby? Did you want to meet Potter that badly? I could have invited - " No, he didn't feel like lying about being friends with Potter anymore, even if it was just to impress a hallucination of a ghost of his old house elf. "Ugh, I need a drink." He swung head-down to check underneath the bed for the bottle and almost vomited. His lower half joined him on the rug where he curled up in misery and passing nausea. "Uhhnnn…. Get me some hangover potion, will you, Dobby? And a good fry-up breakfast. Or is it time for lunch already?"</p><p>Dobby sighed wearily, as if Draco was a horrible disappointment for all that Dobby had brought him up himself. Well, Dobby could get in line. He wasn't the only one Draco was disappointing.</p><p>"Draco Malfoy's parents is close kin," Dobby said, shaking his head. "They's <em>parents</em> is close kin, and they's parents parents is. It's not Draco Malfoy's fault he not very bright. Dobby is not working for the Malfoys for<em> years</em>, Draco Malfoy. And besides, Dobby is dead."</p><p>This was too much family talk for three in the morning, and Draco hated thinking about dying whatever o'clock it was. He'd assumed he hadn't seen Dobby around for the past few years because Draco was all grown up and didn't need a nursery elf trailing after him anymore. Mother had said Dobby had been sent to the family farm in the Hebrides, to take care of Draco's (only slightly imperfect) Crup puppy, Hubert, and they were both having a wonderful time togeth- <em>ohhh… </em></p><p>"Dobby… " <em>what happened to Hubert?</em> seemed too little too late. Draco hated feeling like he was the last one to figure things out, that was what having Vince around was for, only Vince was <em>dead</em>... and oh no, he didn't want to think about this, he didn't have to if he didn't want to, nobody could make him -</p><p>But Dobby was relentless, the way only a house elf who'd succeeded in potty-training him could be, when Mother had all but despaired and was half-resigned to Draco growing up to be one of those uncouth wizards who simply <em>vanished</em> their excrement from their pants.</p><p>"Dobby come back from dead to warn Draco Malfoy. Draco Malfoy must change."</p><p>"What does that even mean, Dobby?" Draco whined as he dragged himself back onto the bed. "Could you be more specific? Are you saying that I should wear orange corduroy to bed and not this lawn nightshirt? Or do you mean that I should become someone completely different? Like a cabaret singer? A hippogriff? A woman? "</p><p>But Dobby was not impressed. Dobby, the elf who lived to murder good grammar, had never been impressed by Draco's verbal virtuosity. And now Dobby was honest-to-Merlin<em> dea-</em></p><p>"Draco Malfoy must change his ways and do <em>good</em>," said Dobby, "and not be a miserable toerag anymore. Or <em>else</em>."</p><p>"Or else what, Dobby? Or else what? How can the universe punish me any more than it already has? I gave it a chance, you know that? I went out there and I did the best I could, and nobody appreciated it. Father and Mother didn't even appreciate it. Mother didn't even understand how I was trying to save the family after Father was taken away, and she wasn't subtle about it, either, trying to <em>smother</em> me and make sure I <em>failed</em> at every turn. And still I persisted for what thanks I got. And you know what? It was all for nothing! Nada! Well, that's it from me. I've <em>efforted</em> enough for one lifetime. If they don't like who I am and what I've got to offer, then I'm not going to foist my unwelcome presence on them, I'm not that impolite."</p><p>"Draco Malfoy is plenty impolite for that," said cruel, merciless Dobby. "And them who? Who's is Draco Malfoy calling 'them'?"</p><p>Draco boggled at this nitpicking from an elf. "Them? You know… <em>them</em>. Everybody. The whole world."</p><p>Dobby snorted. "Sounds like them's is more like nobody then. Them's is more like excuses to lie about and not to do anything."</p><p>"Oh, what do you know? You're just a house elf. A <em>dead-</em>"</p><p>He stopped. He could still smell the blood, the stench of burnt flesh and pain and dead bodies, see Vince's face falling away from him before the flames rose up to consume him, and the Dark Lord-</p><p>"Aaaaghh!"</p><p>He buried his head under the pillows and willed it all to go away and leave him be. Hadn't he done enough? Hadn't Draco messed up his life enough already?</p><p>"What do you want from me, Dobby? You want me to go out there and rescue baby birds fallen out of trees and run a soup kitchen out of Knockturn Alley for homeless werewolves? You know I'm not good at that sort of thing. I'm not-"</p><p>
  <em>Good? A hero? Someone who didn't bung things up? Someone who actually mattered? </em>
</p><p>"Just leave me alone, Dobby. You're giving me a headache."</p><p>"Draco Malfoy is warned," Dobby insisted, as if he hadn't heard. "Draco Malfoy must change his toerag ways, or there be hell to pay."</p><p>"Oh, you go to hell, Dobby."</p><p>The crack of house elf Apparition made him jump. He hadn't actually sent the miserable thing to hell, had he? Draco poked his head out from under the pillows and immediately regretted it, as Mother swept into the room and jerked open the heavy drapes with a flick of her wand. The afternoon sun was blinding.</p><p>"Still in bed, Draco, darling? It's almost three in the afternoon. What were you shouting about? I could hear you from down the hall."</p><p>He mumbled something like 'bad dream, wolves, snakes,' and Mother let it drop, though she changed the subject by wrinkling her nose.</p><p>"When was the last time you bathed, darling? You're developing quite a unique personal scent." Her eye fell on the empty bottle of '62 Margaux under the armoire. "And your Father's nose for Muggle wine, I see."</p><p>The drunken louts who'd occupied his home during ol' Snakeface's reign of terror had drunk up or smashed up half the good bottles, so he and Father had to resort to nipping into the westernmost shelf, which shouldn't have been uncorked for another ten years, what a travesty. Normally, Mother would never have allowed for it, but these were not normal times (see the ascendance of yoinks such as Bongbottom and Weaselby, not to mention the long-in-the-tooth Mudbl- <em>Granger</em>), and besides, Mother was <em>busy</em>.</p><p>"Elf-made wine is syrupy shit," he muttered under his breath, but Mother heard him.</p><p>"Language, young man, language," reproved Mother, and he backed down without a fight. If Mother still thought that if they kept up appearances and behaved beautifully nothing terrible would happen, she'd learned absolutely nothing. She shook her perfectly poised head, as if she could read his thoughts. Maybe she could. Aunt Bella had been a Legilimens. The Black sisters were formidable, each in their own way.</p><p>Mother had always kept herself busy, sitting on the governing boards of a dozen or more Societies for the Improvement of Poor Squibs/ Unfortunate Muggles/ Three-legged Crups or some such charity or other, then hosting the Dark Lord in our valiant war effort, which was now quickly, and with a considerable amount of gold passing hands, being re-interpreted as 'being forced to endure a painful occupation of her home, which led to her pivotal assistance to the Cause at the eleventh hour.' Mother was using what little battle cred she had to come out on the side of right, and Draco and Father were going to <em>zip it</em> and behave according to script if they knew what was good for them.</p><p>"I'm popping out to call on your dear Aunt Dromy, darling, if you'd like to come with me. If you could just freshen up a bit…." She pursed her lips before bravely ploughing on with her bullshit plans. "Your Aunt Dromy is sole guardian of her grandson, your cousin Teddy, Draco, and it would be lovely if you could get to know him, perhaps sit with him a few afternoons so your Aunt and I can go out? It would be good for you."</p><p>Good for <em>you</em>, you mean, he thought sullenly. Mother wanted to be seen in public with Aunt Andromeda, war hero and mother of a fallen war hero, to play up her slight role on the side of light. Worse, she was trying to pressure Aunt Andromeda into naming her the wolfchild's godmother, so she could share godparenting duties with Saint Potter. The wretched woman didn't care that this would make them god-married, which would allow Potter to lord it over Draco as his <em>god</em>-stepfather.</p><p>Mother had just laughed when he'd hinted the obvious. "Oh, it doesn't work that way, Draco, darling," though she'd patted her hair girlishly and made sure to wear <em>scarlet</em> on her lips before going out that day. How could women be so fickle, even his own perfect Mother, going all aflutter at the thought of flirting with a speccy twerp who used to go to school with her son?</p><p>"You're forty, and he knows it!" he'd yelled at her as the green flames from the Floo had pulled her away.</p><p>Was today long-overdue payback for that off-color remark? The Blacks believed in delayed retribution so that their victims got tripped up when they'd least expected it. What was Mother planning here? Would Potter be at Aunt Andromeda's to accuse him of lycophobia and child abuse if the werechild even burped funny?</p><p>"How long has it been since you've set foot outside the house, Draco? Outside the East wing? Your own room?" Mother raised a judgemental eyebrow at him. "This isn't healthy, Draco. You can't hide in here forever."</p><p>Draco cut her off before this turned into a full-on nag. "I was thinking of taking a jaunt around the grounds," he lied easily. "See how the Abraxans are doing."</p><p>"What an excellent idea," she agreed smoothly. "And while you're at it, muck out their stalls and throw down some fresh hay, would you be a dear, do? You can't smell any worse than you do already. Getting the local help to come in and actually do their jobs has been rather tiresome lately, the lazy things."</p><p>No way, since the Dark Lord would lure the Muggles here for one of his <em>killing sprees</em>. Mother must have read more than petulance in his face because she turned and swept out of the room without another word - a bit like Pansy flouncing off in a snit. It was dreadful of him to think Mother could have anything in common with Pansy, but Mother hadn't always been Mother. She must have been a silly young thing once, or Father would never have dared marry her.</p><p>"Marriage is a trap, Draco," Father had told him that afternoon, the day after Mother had Apparated him home before the dust had even cleared from the battle. She had not looked back to see if anyone was following them, not even Father.</p><p>After a silent meal of cold chicken and cold silence and cold everything, Draco had wandered off to the west wing to find Father, who had not shown up for three meals so far, and Draco's over-active imagination had convinced him that the next skipped meal would mean finding Father sitting in his own tepid bath water with his wrists open.</p><p>But Mother had only laughed scornfully - she reminded him awfully of Aunt Bella when she was like this. Father was holed up in his study, "thinking upon his many, <em>many</em> wrongdoings," as she put it, though it seemed to Draco that Father had taken it upon himself to empty out his liquor cabinets, via his stomach.</p><p>"Nobody told me what I'm about to tell you," Father enunciated his words clearly; he was only second-stage drunk. "Young witches these days like to assert that marriage is a trap for women, that they want to do more before settling down. But it's always been great Juno's plan for women to tie up a man in marriage and not ever let him call his soul his own again. That's why they don't have time to do anything else."</p><p>"Is that why you offered yours up to the Dark Lord? Because you were afraid of Mother tying up your soul?" Draco sneered. And immediately regretted his impertinence.</p><p>Father didn't even raise his hand to reprimand him; he'd flinched as if <em>Draco</em> had attempted to strike him instead, and Draco despised Father then for being so pathetic, hated and pitied and loved his poor weak Father, and hated the world for bringing him so low, hated Potter and the Dark Lord and even Mother that he thought his heart would burst.</p><p>"Oh, Father…"</p><p>"Your Mother's a wonderful woman, you won't hear any different from me. A fine pureblood witch, if she's a tad cold, and that's only because she's got dem Black family standards, the bloody highest, there's no pleasing her," Father droned into his cut-crystal tumbler, a bit early for stage three, but there you go. "But she'll pull this family up by the bootstraps and give it a good shine, you won't see the scuff marks for the treads, don't you worry, son. Don't you worry. We'll get through this sticky stretch without too much mud clinging, and did I mention boots already?"</p><p>"I thought that would be up to me," said Draco.</p><p>"You? <em>You? </em>What could you do that would ever amount to anything, Draco?" That stirred a spark of life in his father that Draco wouldn't have begrudged if the drunken sod wasn't laughing at him. "No. No, no. Every generation has its best in show, Draco, and in yours, we have Potter and his Mudbl- Mubbledorn- <em>Muggleborn</em> witch to set the standard. Even that weedy scrap of a Weasley who's always running after them's not worth more than two Knuts, for all his good Prewett and Fawley blood. As for the rest… all runts and squibs, the lot of them. At least you're well provided for, my boy. We can weather a bad litter this time around. I haven't squandered the family money, and your mother's made sure her dowry's tied down with nothing less than blood rites so the vultures won't get at it. Perhaps your sons will turn out to be a better gamble. Perhaps there's some truth in that talk of hybrid vigor, eh, Draco? Perhaps you should look to fresh blood to strengthen the line."</p><p>"I thought you said marriage was a trap, Father," said Draco waspishly, and Father fell back in his chair, all the light gone out of his eyes again as he sploshed more firewhiskey into his glass.</p><p>"Tha's true, tha's true," Father slurred. "I said that didn't I? Fair warning that my own father didn't think to give me, what with one sister run off to marry a Mud-<em>dleborn</em> and another stark raving mad. Don't tie yourself down, son. You've got the Malfoy looks and the Malfoy money, and I'll be dang- <em>dame- damned</em> if my own son has to crawl to please anyone, even his own damn wife!"</p><p>And he drained his whiskey in one gulp and threw the glass into the fire. Evidently even this incoherent rant was too much of a strain on poor Father because less than a minute later he'd knocked himself out, and was snoring in grunts and gasps. Father's health wasn't what it was, and for all his bluster Father was sensitive and high-strung, like all the Malfoys. Mother was doing all she could to keep him out of Azkaban. Another stint in the poky would kill him off for sure.</p><p>All this and more Draco could have contemplated on a long, meandering walk over the manor grounds. Thought long and hard about what Mother was doing to establish herself in the new world order, which showed far more gumption than Father's time-honored method of sinking into drink and apathy. Then, he could have given a good think about phantom Dobby's cryptic warnings and had a good laugh at his own unconscious for being so disgusted with himself that it had rustled up a dream of his old house elf to rouse him into action. And maybe by then he would have made it out to grandfather Malfoy's Abraxan paddock and rolled up his sleeves and given the stalls a much needed mucking out, give the dem beasts a chance to wade out of their own filth. No one had had much time or thought to spare for anything other than the slender thread of their own survival in the past year.</p><p>But bestirring himself from bed was far too strenuous an effort for Draco that day, and he was out of wine on top of everything else. So, rearranging his comfortably smelly bedclothes around him like an animal snug in its den (not a ferret!), he stared up at the constellations on his canopy bed hangings as they drifted around the axis of the North Star, and thought about the smoking ruins of his life, and hated the Dark Lord, and Potter, but not his Mother so much any more, until the afternoon light gave way to dusk and he sank into the sweet oblivion of sleep, upon which he no longer had to worry about trying to be a better person just because his old (dead) house elf came to him in a dream and <em>nagged</em> at him to.</p><p>After two whole weeks of worrying, Draco Malfoy's plans for himself in this terrifying new world order were stunning in their simplicity: he intended to do bugger all, thanks ever so much for asking, and you can bugger off while you're at it, you nosy hags- uh, sorry, Mother, didn't mean you.</p><p>One might assume - naively - that such lack of ambition in once such a promising young Slytherin might have something to do with how the world had been turned on its head, and what once had been high was brought low <em>et cetera et cetera<em>, </em></em>and those who were considered the right sort nowadays were a bunch of drags and bores (that means you, Bongbottom &amp; Weaselby) who wanted nothing to do with him. But Draco would have told them, if they'd even bothered to ask, that he'd planned on doing nothing <em><em><em>first</em><strike> so nyah nyah</strike>.</em></em></p><p>And fourteen whole days after his schoolboy nemesis had saved the wizarding world from their own worst selves, Draco Malfoy was already fulfilling his best destiny, quite brilliantly if he might add... if only it weren't so 'nads-shrivelingly<em> boring</em>.</p><p>He let his aimless life drift along for another wasted day (day and a half? What did it matter?), wandering into the kitchen sometime before some day's noon to scrounge for some cheese, and idly read a brief note from Mother, saying that she and Aunt Andromeda would be visiting the Greengrasses in Cornwall over the long weekend, and she trusted Draco and Father could fend for themselves till she was back?</p><p>"But who will think of dear Teddy?" he mumbled around a mouthful of runny Camembert, amused at their flightiness, and wondered what day it was today - Friday? Sunday? - when the calling mirror from the porter's lodge shimmered and chimed, announcing callers at the front gate.</p><p>"But why would Mother be ringing the porter's bell?" wondered Draco, before his fear-brain jerked him to alertness.</p><p>The Aurors had arrived to haul Father away to Azkaban.</p><p>"But all charges of collusion have been suspended while the Committee is reviewing mitigating circumstances!" wailed Draco. Mother had made sure of that stop-gap; she had gotten herself named to the most junior seat on the Committee for Post-War Rebuilding and Reconciliation, two days after the Battle of Hogwarts. She would not have set foot outside the Manor otherwise. Blast those sneaky Aurors for showing up just when she wasn't here.</p><p>"What stupid, trumped-up charges, then?!" demanded an increasingly shrill Draco; he did not perform well under pressure.</p><p>For extreme neglect and cruelty to animals under his care, he was told. The Aurory had been informed that a herd of rare Abraxans were expiring this very moment on the grounds of the Manor, and <em>that rat bastard Malfoy was going to pay</em> - for cruelty to those poor creatures and all that, so open up!</p><p>And Draco panicked then and there. This was all his fault! If he'd only trudged out to the paddock and hosed down those luckless beasts - and buried or burnt what couldn't be helped - just like his mother had asked him to, this would not be happening right now.</p><p>But this was more serious than not listening to Mother and putting Father in a vulnerable position. He, Draco Malfoy, had set them firmly in harm's crosshairs by ignoring the warning sent to him from beyond the Veil. He had brought this down on their heads.</p><p>House elf magic was extremely powerful and very annoying, and had a tendency to turn deadly if you ever tried to ignore it. He wasn't some ignorant Mudbl-<em>bleborn</em>.</p><p>How could he have let this happen?</p><p>Mother would know what to do. He had to firecall Mother, but how? Where? She was at the Greengrasses. He didn't know their floo. Aunt Andromeda? She was with Mother, and besides Draco didn't know <em>her </em>floo, either. Who knew the Greengrasses? Pansy was somewhere in Denmark, useless bint.</p><p>He was running out of time, and more importantly, of nerve. First things first. Who could help with the Aurors? He needed a drink - no, he needed to keep his wits about him, what was left of them, that is.</p><p>In the end, he firecalled the only person he could think of who'd give a rat's arse, even if they'd probably punch him in the face first, yelled at the Aurors in the mirror to wait just one dem minute, he was getting dressed, threw on a pair of galoshes and apparated to the Abraxan paddock to incinerate the evidence.</p><p> </p>
