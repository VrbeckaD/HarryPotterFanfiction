    <p align="justify">Newt gets Graves a kitten, because he knows how helpful animals are in the healing process and while it’s been a year since Grindelwald, some scars just don’t want to fade away. Those tricky scars of the heart. </p><p align="justify">So he gets Graves a kitten. A small, fluffy kitten with blond wisps of hair and eyes too big for its head. Feeble in its youth. Its cries are more chirping than cat-like. He puts a big, floppy bow around its neck - the red ribbon practically bigger than its whole body and giving it the illusion of wings - before quietly slipping into the bedroom they share. </p><p align="justify">“This is him,” Newt whispers into the little kitten’s too large ears, lifting him up and out to show him the slender back of the man laying in bed before them - dead asleep. “Now off you go, just like we discussed.”</p><p align="justify">And then he sets the little beast down and lets it loose. He watches as it determinedly wobbles to the bed, obviously set on a goal. Smiles as it sets its tiny claws into the soft silk of their sheets and climbs the tall rise of their bed. Walks closer to watch as the little fur ball then makes an unsteady beeline for the man in the bed – as though completely aware of what Newt had said to him when walking home with him this morning from the shelter.</p><p align="justify">He can’t stop himself from laughing when the little beast finally makes it to Graves’ face. It reaches out with a tiny paw and taps his face kindly, as though asking for attention, before finally flat out sitting on the man’s face.</p><p align="justify">Graves jerks up, eyes wide and hair sticking out in every which way, and blinks first at the now upended little fur ball on his pillow, then at Newt – bewildered and confused from waking. Newt only laughs harder as he watches Graves slowly try to connect the dots, everything moving slowly from sleep. His hands seem impossibly large as he gathers the struggling little kitten up to better study it.</p><p align="justify">Bright green eyes, blonde fluffy coat, tiny little paws and a soft little chin that it rests atop his knuckles, staring up at him. Newt sees it the moment something melts in Graves – too tired and too early to hide the emotion before Newt can see.</p><p align="justify">“Do you like him?” Newt asks, bemused as his partner’s eyes rise from over top the little cat to stare at him, baffled and sleepy.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t understand,” Graves says, and Newt feels another piece of his heart melt for the man currently naked and in his bed, holding a kitten and blinking sleepily at him.</p><p align="justify">“He’s yours.”</p><p align="justify">“He’s mine?” Graves repeats.</p><p align="justify">“Yes,” Newt chuckles.</p><p align="justify">“You got me a cat?” Graves asks, eyes falling back down on the little kitten.</p><p align="justify">Newt pauses, suddenly worried that this had been a rash decision. He shouldn’t have surprised his partner with something so big, that required such a commitment, without talking to him first. His thoughts begin to tail spin. His hands tremble as he wrings them.</p><p align="justify">“I, uh – yes. That is… if you want him?”</p><p align="justify">Graves just squints at him for a long moment before suddenly collapsing back into the bed again, taking the kitten with him.</p><p align="justify">“That’s great,” Graves mumbles into his pillow, the kitten tucked happily beneath his chin and purring merrily away. “Kitten Newt won’t leave me alone in my bed at hideously early hours every morning.”</p><p align="justify">Newt squawked, indignant; a huge and spreading smile on his face despite his affronted tone.</p><p align="justify">“You’re replacing me?!”</p><p align="justify">“Technically <em>you</em> replaced yourself.”</p><p align="justify">“Move over, I’m coming in there.”</p><p align="justify">“Nope, I have kitten Newt now. There’s no more need for you in my bed,” Graves says, one eye cracking open to catch Newt’s gaze as he smiles, unable to hide his mirth.</p><p align="justify">“Oh you’re going to get it,” Newt growls as he stalks the bed.</p><p align="justify">“Not in front of kitten Newt!” Graves gasps, dramatic and scandalized.</p><p align="justify">Newt crawls onto the bed where he’d normally sleep and gently covers the little kitten’s eyes with one finger, ignoring its plaintive little meow as he leans forward to capture Graves’ lips in a soft, sleepy kiss.</p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” Graves whispers into his lips after their kiss.</p><p align="justify">Newt just kisses him again.</p>
