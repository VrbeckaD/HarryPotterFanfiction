    <p>For the <em>publicity</em>, his father had said. Apparently, Draco's single night out- or perhaps it was the whole Easter Holiday debacle -was enough to earn him his father's wrath for a lifetime. Only something this appalling, this dreadful, would mitigate the situation. And to think, his summer holiday would be eaten up by this sad endeavor. </p><p>Draco sneered at the thought of the 'reality television show.' Really. He had absolutely no desire to interact with the peons below him. Hell, no. Those people were poor because of bad choices and bad blood. It was not <em>his</em> duty to be an enabler to their laziness. They should get degrees, get an education, if things were so bad. Participate in the goddamned community! Draco crossed his arms and tried to hide his irritation from the cameras focused on him. He didn't want to do this. He hated this.</p><p>Draco could proudly give the history of the Malfoy family were he asked. It had existed for centuries even before Wiltshire Manor was built. The Malfoys were an old and proud French family, and his immediate family the only ones left with the name. Lip curling, Draco lamented to himself about the nouveau riche cropping up everywhere; the Malfoy name was slowly fading from public eye and therefore public recognition. Of course, that meant that Draco's life wasn't as scrutinized as other billionaires' sons, but it also meant that Lucius Malfoy was constantly unhappy. Which, by the simplest transitive law, meant Draco would be unhappy.</p><p>"I'm Lucius Malfoy, and this is my son, Draco," Lucius introduced them both to the cameras with a fancy wave of his hand. "We're a very old, very proud family, and Grunnings is one of the several companies I run. Draco will be taking it over shortly, and he agrees this would be a good opportunity to get to know the company and the hard-working people behind its success," he said, all the while leading the cameras into the house. His father would give them a grand tour of the house, and Draco just had to show up intermittently and appear as if he cared. </p><p>He sneered at the cameras when they were focused elsewhere and sneered at the giant microphone. It failed to satisfy him. Earlier, the cameramen had him and his father toss a baseball back and forth for the benefit of the audience. His father had the butler rush to the department store at five in the morning to buy a pair of baseball gloves for that scene. Then they had a short snippet of Draco playing the piano, his father making breakfast (now that was laughable), and his mother kissing both men on their cheeks before she climbed into her bright red car off-camera. Draco didn't mind the fake scenes. He already knew he was different, and most importantly <em>better</em> than the average twenty-something-year-old.</p><p>Only once the camera crew was gone did Lucius' façade fall. "Do not fail me. I swear, Draco, this is your last chance. I will be overseeing the end of all of this, so do not get too carried away," Lucius lectured his son.</p><p>Draco waved his hand casually. "Whatever. It's only for a summer."</p><p>"Good enough, Draco. Maybe you'll learn something."</p><p align="center">&gt;°))))彡</p><p>Draco didn't yet have his own office, so the camera crew suggested he use his father's. With a smirk, because his father couldn't protest the idea without appearing callous, Draco took a seat on the expensive chair and experimentally rested his feet on the leather-topped desk.</p><p>"Sir, we'll be filming soon. Maybe you'll want to, er, fix yourself up."</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Draco settled his feet on the floor and smoothed out his suit. He leaned back in the chair, ready to give his spiel.</p><p>"Okay, in three, two," One.</p><p>Draco read from the cue cards. His father crafted the script with the producers and writers on the show, but Draco had the final say. After all, he was the one reading it aloud for the cameras.</p><p>"My name is Draco Malfoy, and I will be taking over as Chief Executive Officer of the Grunnings Corporation someday, perhaps once I finish my studies at Oxford. The history of this company is a long one. A man named E. E. Grunnings started the company in the early thirties with electric drills, and has been manufacturing and selling drills ever since. It started to lose money, and though I was maybe eleven at the time, I told my father , 'I bet you can save them.' So now, more than a decade later, we've bought out the company, and we're ready to make some changes."</p><p>"Cut!"</p><p>Draco flopped back into the chair with a loud sigh. "What's wrong?"</p><p>"Mr. Malfoy, you cannot just make stuff up. The audience will roll their eyes and scoff at the thought of an eleven year old making business decisions. And 'bought out'? That's too aggressive for the image we're trying to project. Why don't you just stick to the script?"</p><p>"Listen. I'm going to do this my way, or we're doing nothing at all. I'm not lying about anything. Moreover, if the audience is so smart, they will know that we were not just <em>given</em> the damn company. We stole it, and I'm damn proud of it!"</p><p>A cameraman or two suppressed their chuckles, but the sound guy openly snorted.</p><p>"Whatever, let's just keep rolling. You can redo that segment later."</p><p>Draco cleared his throat and assumed his regal position with his shoulders back and head tilted upward.</p><p>"Take two!"</p><p>"What I'm specifically doing this for is, well, to see how Grunnings works now and how to improve it for the future. It's a new company to us; it's like adopting a child and trying to see, not necessarily how to fix him, but how to help him develop into the best he can be. That's what I'm doing here.</p><p>"I'm doing this, instead of my father, because he is the face of the company. Everyone who works in the company knows what he looks like. I've mostly stayed under the radar." Until a month ago, but no one remembered that debacle except his father. "Moreover, I'm going to be taking over this branch as managing director in the near future anyway. More than he, <em>I</em> need to get to know Grunnings." And maybe change the name, Draco thought with a mental wince.</p><p align="center">&gt;°))))彡</p><p>Draco thought he sounded much more confident than he felt.</p><p>He and his father were sitting in the man's secondary home office. Usually, his father would take the swivel leather chair behind the walnut desk and Draco would sit as a visitor, but because they had to make an impression, he found both of them on the couch instead.</p><p>The cameras followed them in.</p><p>"So, do you think you're ready, son?"</p><p>Draco would have scoffed at the tone and the ridiculous term if it hadn't taken him by surprise. Son? His father never called him that. "Yes, I think I've prepared well enough for this. I'm a bit nervous, though, since you're usually the one out there, talking to the franchisees and the managers." Laughing at this point wasn't in the script, but Draco was sorely tempted to do so. He couldn't imagine his father inconveniencing himself by going out to actually meet the people who worked beneath him.</p><p>"Well, I think you're ready as well. Make sure to come back with some insights from the workers."</p><p>"That's exactly why I'm here. So, <em>Dad</em>, the next time I see you, I might be a new man." Draco stood up and held his right hand out for the handshake that was expected of him. Instead, he felt two strong arms wrap around him. Shocked, he repeated the gesture, hesitantly putting his hand on his father's back. When the man didn't immediately pull away, Draco strengthened his grip and put his other arm around.</p><p>"Cut! Good job, you two."</p><p>Too soon, the hug was over, and the man was pulling away.</p><p>"It's a very good thing you were never interested in acting, Draco," his father sneered.</p><p>Draco couldn't let on that the words stung. He sneered in almost exact replication, "You're so good at it, I wonder why you couldn't do this yourself. You would just have to walk into a store without strutting, and they'd never recognize you," Draco shot back. "Ow!" He whined when his father's open hand lightly slapped the back of his head. Glaring at the man, he rubbed the spot. It didn't actually hurt, but it was the indignity of the thing!</p><p align="center">&gt;°))))彡</p><p>Draco's plastered smile was becoming tiresome. "I want to be able to work with these people and know the company, inside and out."</p><p>He sorely wanted to massaged his cheeks. "A goal I've set for myself is to expand the company. We have quite a few locations, but none outside of the United Kingdom. I'm especially looking forward to putting a warehouse in France."</p><p>These damn cue cards looked like something written by a primary-school child. "Nervous? I'm not nervous, I've been good at everything I've tried thus far. I'm bright, what can I say?"</p><p>"Cut. Mr. Malfoy, please affect some semblance of humility? Just a bit?"</p><p>"Fine," he said, stretching. It felt like he'd been in the office for hours, doing nothing but sitting and talking at a wall of boredom.</p><p>"Take sixteen," the director said wearily.</p><p>"I'm not too nervous. Thankfully, I'm young and good at picking things up. I mean, there's always the chance that I'll encounter something beyond my grasp, but there's a reason I'm a Malfoy. We work hard."</p><p>A man behind the camera raised a cue card. Okay, so this was just routine stuff now. "Undercover, I'll be known as Thomas Felton-"</p><p>"Cut. Tom, the name is Tom."</p><p>"No. Allow me to take a dignified name," Draco insisted, "and I'll read the rest of the cue card as it is." It was probably tempting, since Draco was being so difficult, but the man shook his head.</p><p>"Do it again, with Tom. Action!"</p><p>Draco cleared his throat. "Undercover, I'll be posing as Thomas-"</p><p>"Try saying it. Maybe you'd like the name."</p><p>"No, I will not go by such a base name. <em>Tom</em> is too simple."</p><p>The director smirked. "Fine. Keep rolling, and Draco, read the rest of the lines."</p><p>"Ahem. I'll be posing as Thomas Felton, a recent graduate unable to find work. My coworkers will be told that we're filming a documentary on how the recession has affected people from different walks of life."</p><p>"Good, good, thank you very much, Mr. Malfoy," the director said with slumping shoulders. Draco thought that at least if the rest of this was terribly boring, he'd have the fun of ruining the director's time.</p><p>"My pleasure!" he answered brightly. The assistant cameraman snorted.</p><p align="center">&gt;°))))彡</p><p>Regretfully, platinum blond hair was not all that common and tended to stick out. It was with only great effort and a touch of Valium that the hairstylist was able to get Draco calm enough to dye his hair a deep brown. Worst of all, the director had it all on camera. Draco's small goatee, grown out for the occasion, and even his eyebrows, were dyed brown. There was no beautiful silver shine, only a dull, dirty muck.</p><p>At least, that's what Draco called it when he complained up and down the manor about his makeover. "<em>And</em>, my stubble is <em>itchy</em>. I lie on my side, and I can hear it!<em> I can hear it</em>, scratching against my pillow. It is the most disgusting sound, and I hear it inside my head. Mother, are you <em>listening</em> to me?!"</p><p>"Yes, yes, dragon, my sweet. It'll be over soon, so drink your tea."</p><p>"My tea? There are more important things than my effing tea! I'll have you know, I have been clean-shaven for years, and for good reason!"</p><p>Narcissa merely nodded to herself, much too engaged in whatever magazine held her attention. "Tell your father," she offered uselessly.</p><p>Huffing, Draco stormed from the sitting room towards his wing of the house. He was stopped short by the mirror in the hallway, however, and he could only stare mournfully at his now brunet head and scraggly chin. He sniffed. This whole thing was a bad idea from the start.</p><p align="center">&gt;°))))彡</p><p>"Just one day, Mr. Malfoy. Your first appointment is at the Surrey location. We've told the manager there that you're helping us film a documentary about recent graduates entering the workforce."</p><p>"I'm not old enough to have graduated," he reminded the man giving him instructions.</p><p>The man waved a hand dismissively. "They won't be able to tell. Just be charming, and try to learn something you can reference later when you have to give something back."</p><p>"Give something back," Draco muttered, "What a load. It's rather counter-intuitive to force me to make changes, isn't it? What if everything's working fine, what then?"</p><p>"Then we'll find personal sob-stories, and you can give vacations to them, alright?"</p><p>Draco could tell the man was getting impatient. "Whatever. Let your boss know I hate the motel in which he has me staying. It is simply repulsive." It would be a <em>miracle</em> if he survived this ordeal.</p><p align="center">&gt;°))))彡</p><p>Now, Harry was having a completely different kind of day. He had no idea what kind of miracle it would take to tolerate the stranger he would meet that day. In fact, he didn't believe in miracles or fairy tales at all. As a young child, he had fantasies he would reenact in his mind of his parents whisking him away. He'd had the opportunity to leave the Durlseys once and for all, but like many things in his life, it all fell apart. Shortly after that, he'd had a vivid dream of a gargantuan man- who looked oddly like the company driver -with a letter of acceptance to a school of magic. He focused on his imaginary world whenever he could. It was the glimmer of hope in his otherwise dreary situation.</p><p>He still didn't believe there was any such thing, but nowadays he tried not to let the disappointment get to him when he woke up and he was still living his mundane life. All adults had to leave their childish fantasies behind sometime. He just had to reconcile himself with the fact that he would never receive that letter, that he was never so special, that miracles simply didn't happen for people like him.</p><p>"Boy!"</p><p>Harry sat up in his cot, wondering why he hadn't woken up naturally. He groggily searched for his glasses, surprised by the darkness of the sky through his window. It was summer, surely there was no reason to be up so early?</p><p>"Boy, you'll make us late!"</p><p>Late? But he hadn't even made breakfast yet. He shoved his round glasses onto the bridge of his nose and stumbled into opening his door.</p><p>"Uncle Vernon?" He looked down the staircase to see his uncle already dressed in the foyer.</p><p>"There's a camera crew coming to the company today, so I'll have none of your foolishness. It's a new show that'll be on the telly. We have to be there early!"</p><p>Harry groaned. "You never said-"</p><p>"I have other things to worry about than you, Potter. Now hurry up, because I am leaving in five minutes, with or without you." With those harsh words, he stuffed a donut into his mouth and left to gather his things.</p><p>"Five minutes…" Harry grumbled to himself. Hardly enough time to do anything. He brushed his teeth and washed his face, ignoring the reflection in the mirror. He knew his hair was unkempt and his face thin; he neither needed nor wanted to see it. He gathered his clothing and slipped on his threadbare slacks and blue shirt uniform, stuffing his feet into a pair of old work boots.</p><p>HONK-HONK!</p><p>Frustrated, Harry flew down the stairs, grabbed a belt from the cupboard under the stairs, and dashed out the door without making a lunch for himself.</p><p>"Took you long enough," Uncle Vernon muttered as Harry buckled himself in. He refrained from responding since any reply would have been laced with exasperation. He still had a minute or two left!</p><p>After a long silence of driving down the roads, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat.</p><p>"What'll happen is, I'm going to assign this Tom fellow to the warehouse. You will not screw this up for me. If he asks about me, tell him I'm the best boss you've ever had. If he slacks off, you be the hard-ass and get him back to working, understood?"</p><p>Harry shrugged. It didn't sound any different from the other times he had to pick up the slack for his uncle.</p><p>"Understood?" the man asked again, this time glaring over at Harry around his road-checks. At least Harry could say the man was a safe enough driver.</p><p>"Yeah, I get it. Make you look good for the cameras, and make him want to work at Grunnings."</p><p>It would be a hard task, Harry knew, because even <em>he</em> didn't want to work for Grunnings.</p><p>"None of your cheek either!" the man rebuked.</p><p>"Of course not, Uncle." It seems the man was trying to determine if Harry's tone was sarcastic because the man narrowed his eyes, glanced at Harry, and slowly returned his attention to the road.</p><p>Harry was surprised to note that this was the first civil conversation they'd had in the past three or so years of carpooling. Usually it was silence punctuated by the occasional gripe against Harry's tardiness, his sloppiness, or his all-around unworthiness. </p><p>It was strange. "Tom's his name?"</p><p>Vernon grunted.</p><p>"Sounds like a nice fellow."</p><p>"Recent grad, probably doesn't have an idea how the real world works," his uncle grumbled. He side-eyed Harry. "Like you, thinking a college degree'll get you anything." He harrumphed. "Worked my way up with good old-fashioned hard work, I did. Not like you ragamuffins these days, with your <em>research</em> and your <em>internships</em>."</p><p>Harry bit his lip in an attempt to keep his thoughts to himself. He swallowed down his bitterness and his protests, instead reciting, "Of course, Uncle Vernon."</p><p>Who knew, maybe this Tom would be a welcome breath of fresh air to the Grunnings distribution center. Maybe a recent grad could commiserate with Harry about the tough economy. Who knew what could happen?</p>
