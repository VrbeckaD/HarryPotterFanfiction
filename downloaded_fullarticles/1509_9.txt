    <p>Harry</p><p> </p><p>You’ve passed out already, and it’s only eight o’clock. I don’t know whether to mock you, or tuck the blanket up around you. Oh, who am I kidding, of course I’ll make sure you stay warm enough. I can save the mockery for breakfast. You’re always fun to tease when you’re just up from bed, with your defenses down and waiting for your tea.</p><p>I’ll be telling you come morning, but for an official record I might as well include it here as well. Who knows if we’ll use this book enough to even remember its purpose in a year? Hermione gave this journal to you for your birthday, oh, a year ago? You haven’t touched it since then, though you made all the right noises when you opened it at your party. You’ve even kept it at your bedside, gathering dust until one of Mother’s house elves swipes it away. If anyone were to look at your nightstand, they’d think you some sort of closet academic between the <em>Auror’s International</em> magazine, <em>The Self-Updating and Annotated Collection of Pertinent Wizarding Law</em> (also from Hermione, though you actually use this one on occasion), and <em>Hogwarts, a History <strong>Audio Edition</strong></em> as read by Lee Jordan in the style of our illustrious former Professor Binns (which you pull out when I’m travelling for work, and you swear it works more effectively than Dreamless Sleep).</p><p>Regardless. You’ve been away more often recently, and I’ve missed you. As our schedules are so at odds with one another, and so busy otherwise that Owling simply isn’t a practical option, I thought we might try “sharing a diary” as one of my colleagues put it. She’s fresh out of Beauxbatons, Muggleborn, and quite the romantic, but she was telling me about one she shared with her best friend when they were sorted into different scholastic tracks once they reached the appropriate school age. It would also give this poor, neglected book some purpose. The binding is lovely to look at, wouldn’t it be nice to create contents just as lovely to read in 20, 30 years’ time?</p><p>You’re snoring over there. I’ve tucked you in tightly, now, and you wrinkled your nose and pressed your face into your pillow, but you’re a bit less foetal in pose, now.</p><p> </p><p>Love you, talk to you tomorrow morning</p><p>D</p>
