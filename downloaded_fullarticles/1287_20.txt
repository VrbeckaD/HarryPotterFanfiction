  <b>Girl’s Night: The Formation of the Coven</b>
</p>
<p>Morgana sank into her chair, her ankles crossed as she sipped at the glass of Firewhiskey Narcissa had handed her upon arrival. The other women were slowly trickling in, attire ranging from casual like Amelia Bones who was wearing trousers and an untucked cornflower blouse to fancy like Elladora Zabini who landed through the floo in a svelte black dress, her neck adorned in pearls. Minerva was already seated and on her second glass of Firewhiskey, her tartan robes tossed over the nearest chair to reveal a high-neck buttoned white and black knee length dress.</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea how difficult it is dealing with Albus these days. Ever since Harry’s party he’s been sticking his beak in everything,” her accent got heavier as she shook her head, hair tumbling out of the severe bun in grey tinted black curls.</p>
<p>Elladora snickered as the witch’s Scottish brogue got deeper as she talked, the irritation at the meddling old man making the Italian witch smirk. Narcissa pursed her lips in a slight smile at the news, her actions behind the scenes in the women’s circles were paying off. Morgana reached over and handed Minerva a glass of Firewhiskey. The final stragglers stepped through the green flames, marking the number at nine. From Narcissa to Elladora, Amelia to Minerva, Andromeda to Pandora, Lakshmi to Augusta, the women were in various stages of age and power and station but connected in their womanhood and goals: to better the Wizarding World for their children.</p>
<p>They were gathered in Morgana’s solar, temporarily expanded to fit the group that had come together. The hostess watched her fellow witches settle into their chairs, glasses of Firewhiskey and elven wine in hand.</p>
<p>Clearing her throat, Morgana caught their attention and began, “Hello everyone, thank you for coming. I know that we’re all from rather—different backgrounds and political factions, but I thank you for putting aside those differences for the common good of the children. I know when I first floated this idea by Narcissa, she was hesitant to join because of her familial ties as a Black and her status as the wife of Lucius Malfoy, but the goal for this group, my goal is that we transcend family names, histories, and political leanings. That we focus on what truly matters—the children.”</p>
<p>“Our world has been stagnant for so long, the education our children receive at Hogwarts hasn’t changed since the early 1800’s. I for one, am appalled by how a ghost is teaching A History of Magic, one of the most influential classes for our youth. And he isn’t even teaching it, he’s just a mindless, biased, shade of a man who espouses false and heavily edited narrations on the Goblin Wars,” Narcissa panted as she finished her spiel, she’d been holding that in for years, ever since she herself had the misfortune of Binns as a professor at Hogwarts. She’d hated to drop History of Magic in her sixth year, but it was a useless course there and self-study would serve her much better.</p>
<p>Heads nodded around the room as her fellow Hogwarts graduates commiserated with the awful teaching Binns embodied. Elladora toasted her friend as Amelia began to compile a list of grievances they held against the school. Starting with the failure that was Binns, they moved to the cursed DADA position, and Amelia quickly came up with a solution for that with the simple addition of, “Why don’t we just rename it Defense Arts and move the classroom for extra measure?”</p>
<p>Augusta was quick to second that motion and move the topic onto muggleborn introductions to the magical world, suggesting that they introduce a Wizarding Traditions class into the first- and second-year curriculum to get the muggleborn students up to speed. Lakshmi cheered her on and added that a series of muggleborn/wizarding integration seminars throughout the school year, including an updated syllabus for Muggle Studies would help bridge the other side of the gap.</p>
<p>Knocking back her fourth glass of firewhiskey, Minerva interjected, “That’s all well and good, but we need to get these ideas past Albus and to the Board of Governors, and with who’s on the Board now, we won’t get any of the changes we need.” It took several moments for the other women to decode the inebriated witch’s words, but they were soon arguing over who to nominate as a pawn on the board. Augusta already had a place as interim Head of House Longbottom until Neville came of age, but they needed someone to second her motions. Tapping a finger on her glass, Andromeda tried to pull the conversation back in.</p>
<p>“Ladies, we’re forgetting my Head of House, Arcturus is also on the board, and now that he’s back in the political game and our ally, I feel he will be more inclined to back us now, than he was in the past. In fact, I can guarantee the full support of House Black on all these matters, even my father wouldn’t dare disagree with us now that Arcturus is on our side.”</p>
<p>Nodding her head at her elder sister’s words, Narcissa chimed in with her own opinion, “We’ve been summoned to a House meeting in the coming weeks, we can bring it to Lord Black’s attention then.”</p>
<p>Leaning back in her chair, Morgana watched as the women became more and more invested in the cause and pondered her next course of action. Narcissa was on her mind of late, ever since Harry’s fifth birthday when her dear friend had come to her, worried that her husband might never touch her again and she would never conceive the second child she longed for. While she could bring it to the attention of her Head of House during the House meeting, Morgana was curious to see what other solutions could arise, outside of the divorce she knew Sirius would be gunning for. Running a finger along the rim of her glass, she wondered if some of the other women may have a suggestion for how to gain her friend a child.</p>
<p>“I have a question for you my friends,” Morgana paused and took a sip, the burning liquor giving her the words, “If your husband was straying from your bed, regardless of if he was heading to another’s, how would you entice him back?”</p>
<p>“That depends, friend,” Elladora smirked, her eyes flicking to Narcissa before continuing, “Does the man in question desire to bed women?”</p>
<p>“I would say he does,” Morgana replied.</p>
<p>“Then perhaps his wife should endeavor to entice him to her bed with something new, something more suited to his tastes, if she knows what those are?”</p>
<p>Narcissa coughed and a light blush flooded her cheeks as the other women began to giggle. Amelia shook her head as Elladora nudged her arm, waggling her eyebrows at the redhead in an attempt to get her involved, but the Head of the DMLE ignored her and went back to listing all the ways Hogwarts needed to change to match the current educational standards.</p>
<p>Morgana began to run through a list of scenarios that might entice the wayward Malfoy back to Narcissa’s bed, when a light bulb went off. Perhaps she could kill two birds with one stone and handle her dry spell while simultaneously getting Narcissa her second child. It wasn’t as if she didn’t find her friend attractive, and it would help her get a handle on her raging libido, something that was aggravated tenfold by the attractive Marauders inhabiting the house with her. Setting her drink down, she stood and made her way over to the blonde witch who was currently fending off her sister-in-law’s offer to create a charm made with something called gurdyroots to increase fertility. Leaning down, Morgana whispered her offer in Narcissa’s ear, pleased as the witch began to nod her head, a slight smirk crossing her lips as she did. The coming months would be an interesting change for the women of the wizarding world, and Morgana was intrigued to see where the tides would take them.</p>
