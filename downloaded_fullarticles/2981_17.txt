          <div class="userstuff"><p>Imagine a Tom Marvolo Riddle without parseltongue, still powerful, still slytherin, but convinced somewhat that he was a muggleborn. </p><p>            Imagine different contacts with wizards, maybe some friendships. Imagine he still being a little violent, disregarding some rules and all, but not born evil because that is boring. </p><p>            Imagine he being more cautious with dark arts, being more interested in all kinds of magic and imagine him still angered with the world, but this time angered at the system, the pureblood bias, the predjudice against him even being more powerful and smart than all of them. </p><p>           Imagine him meeting people and creatures as angered as him. Imagine a Tom Riddle still wanted by the ministry, still feared by people, but not by being a dark lordâ€¦ By being a revolutionary.</p></div>
