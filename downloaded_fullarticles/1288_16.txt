</p><p> </p><p>The house was so silent that Harry could faintly hear the ticking of the Grandfather clock from downstairs in the parlor. It was driving him insane. He wanted to march down and smash the clock until splinters of wood embedded into the walls and into the floor and into his own skin.</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t move.</p><p> </p><p>His eyes were dry and itchy from staring at the same spot on the crumbling wallpaper since the Dursleys had left two hours earlier.</p><p> </p><p>His limbs ached from sitting still for so long, but he made no move to ease his discomfort. This was the first moment of peace he had had since the night in the Ministry and as relieved as Harry was for the solace, he was almost as equally desperate for someone he could talk to. An eerie stillness had settled around him that made his stomach twist up in knots and his skin clammy. He felt like air was stuck in his chest, making it too tight and hard to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Harry knew he would be not be talking to anyone he really wanted to until school began again, and perhaps even longer still after that.</p><p> </p><p>Ron, Hermione, and the rest of his friends would still be recovering from Voldemort’s attack at the Ministry. Dumbledore was probably too busy cleaning up Harry’s mess of a rescue attempt, and Sirius…</p><p> </p><p>Well, Sirius was dead. <em> And it was your fault, </em>whispered a small voice in the back of his head.</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t bother trying to argue with himself. He knew it was his fault that Sirius was gone. One of the last semblances of a family he had had disappeared in an instant because he was too stupid and too impulsive to stop himself from going to the Ministry that night.</p><p> </p><p>He had fallen right into Voldemort’s trap. Harry had been played like the foolish boy he was and he could do <em> nothing </em> about it other than wallow in misery and try to accept that Sirius was well and truly <em> dead </em>.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Sirius Black, dead. Everyone knows what you did. Everyone knows you killed him. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry stood suddenly, ignoring the protests from his joints, and swept everything from the top of his bedside table into the floor in one frustrated motion.</p><p> </p><p>“Merlin, I know that!” He yelled at the voice in his head, his words melting into the silence like butter. “I know that, why do you keep reminding me?”</p><p> </p><p>The last of his sentence was said in a trembling voice as Harry desperately tried to stop himself from crying. He could feel the tell-tale prickling at the corners of his eyes and he forced himself to blink rapidly in an attempt to keep his oncoming tears at bay. The back of his throat felt like it was trying to crawl up and out of his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Pathetic. Sirius would be disappointed, seeing you like this. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry couldn’t hold it anymore. He fell to his knees, tears streaming down his face.</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” he croaked one more time before curling into himself on the ground.</p><p> </p><p>Downstairs, the clock ticked on.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Dursleys returned later that night, long after Harry had picked himself off of the floor and cleaned up the mess he had made from his earlier outburst.</p><p> </p><p>He scrambled from his bed and went to stand in the center of his room as he heard the locks on his bedroom door unlatch. The door swung open with a loud creak and there in the doorway stood Aunt Petunia, her hair still perfectly curled from that morning and held in place by what must have been an entire can of hairspray. Petunia’s clothes, too, showed no signs of displacement; her blouse and skirt were cleanly pressed and her Mary Janes looked as clean and polished as the day they had been bought.</p><p> </p><p>The only sign that anything was amiss was the heavy crinkle of fatigue surrounding her eyes and the light smudge of lipstick at the corner of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Harry knew that Petunia would never have left the house unless her appearance was perfect, because she believed that somehow, it would make up for her spiteful personality. She was so obsessive about her appearance that she would have left for the powder room the moment she noticed that her makeup was smudged, so the fact that Petunia hadn’t redone her lipstick and especially that she hadn’t even seemed to notice it yet were quite telling.</p><p> </p><p>“Vernon’s business deal fell through,” Petunia told him, as if Harry cared.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, Aunt Petunia,” Harry responded anyway. He had learned long ago that the best way to avoid conflict with the Dursleys was absolute compliance, or whatever it was that he could do closest to it. A month or two ago he may have said something scathing, just to make Petunia irritable and defensive.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t worth the effort anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s words were of a sympathetic nature, but his voice was dry. Judging by the way Petunia wrinkled her nose, she could tell precisely how insincere he was being. She let it go, however, and continued as if she’d never stopped talking.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d say it wasn’t your fault, <em> boy </em>,” Harry recoiled from the harshness in her voice, “-but I’d expect you’re not above doing anything you can to sabotage Vernon and I, are you? And after all we’ve done for you…”</p><p> </p><p>It was natural, at this point, for Petunia to blame everything that went wrong in their lives on Harry. He hadn’t done shit to mess with the business deal; he hadn’t even known about it until this morning when Vernon had told him as he shoved him into his bedroom and bolted the door. Even if he had wanted to do something, he wouldn't have been able to, trapped in his own room as he was.</p><p> </p><p>This, of course, did not matter to the Durselys. In their pea-sized brains, magic was omnipresent and could do next to anything, and so that translated into Harry being able to do next to anything.</p><p> </p><p>Following this line of logic, they still haven’t quite deduced why Harry hadn’t escaped from the hellhole that was their household with his so-called ‘all-powerful’ magic, and perhaps asking them to do so would require too much of their shared two brain cells.</p><p> </p><p>Petunia’s statement had trailed off but she made it clear she was expecting a certain response. Harry knew that there would be consequences if he said anything other than what she wanted to hear.</p><p> </p><p>So he answered how Petunia wanted him to.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, Aunt Petunia. I’ll try to be more grateful. Thank you for everything you’ve done for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s voice was still void of any emotion, but Petunia’s eyes lit up in twisted triumph regardless. The lines of stress on her face smoothed out and she looked decidedly calmer and more collected than when she had first entered his room. She looked so satisfied she was almost smiling, which was a disturbing thought.</p><p> </p><p>He felt a surge of bitterness in his chest, knowing that his pain brought Petunia such joy.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s a good <em> freak </em>,” Petunia said vindictively, her lips curling into a mocking smirk when she saw Harry flinch away from the use of that word. “I’m pleased to see you’re capable of following your…” Petunia paused there, tapping her finger against her lip and making a dramatic show of looking for the proper word, “...training.”</p><p> </p><p>She was talking down to him like that on purpose, to embarrass him, and Harry knew that, but it did nothing to stop the flush he felt creep up his neck and onto his cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>Petunia raised her hand as if to hit him, and Harry flinched away from her once more, and <em> Merlin, </em>he was tired of reacting to the Dursleys like a scared pup. Instead of striking him like he was expecting, she gently patted his cheek as if to feel the heat of his shame herself.</p><p> </p><p>Sparing him one last look, his aunt retracted her hand and left the room as if nothing had happened, closing the door behind her. Harry could hear the click of the bolts locking back into place, but it was a distant sound in the roar of his violent thoughts. His face burned from where she had touched him, and the heat spread all along his body and deep into his limbs, making the room seem small and unbearable. He stumbled back to his bed and crawled on top, his movements sluggish and uncoordianted, and he felt unbelievably more exhausted and disoriented than he had before his talk with Petunia.</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t know why he reacted so strongly at the Dursleys every move, at their every word. They pushed him around plenty, but the Dursleys couldn’t actually hit him like they wanted to; Dumbledore would rain hell upon them should they ever harm him grievously. They knew that, and Harry knew that, but it didn’t stop him from living in a state of constant paranoia.</p><p> </p><p>At the beginning of the summer, when Harry had come back after the disaster at the Ministry, it’s like the Dursleys had sensed that all his liveliness had been drained straight from his body. They took great advantage of the fact that he no longer felt strong enough to fight back.</p><p> </p><p>Petunia had taken immediately to doing exactly as she did earlier: moving as if to slap him, fast enough for his stomach to drop and his adrenaline to start pumping, before slowing her hand just before it made contact with his flesh. Sometimes she’d pet him like she was calming a skittish animal, as she did before, and other times she’d sneer and drop her hand, usually following with a scathing insult.</p><p> </p><p>Vernon and Dudley preferred much less subtle methods. They were apt to push him around, shoving Harry onto the floor, or into the wall, or into any of the surrounding furniture. It was always hard enough to ache for hours afterward but never hard enough to bruise, and they excused it by blaming Harry for being in the way or making them stumble on purpose.</p><p> </p><p>They all threatened and insulted him tirelessly, never stopping for a moment to remind him of how much of an inconvenience he was, how useless. They’d sometimes whisper it through his door during the day, while he was locked in, knowing full well he could do nothing but sit there and listen. They sat in the kitchen in the evenings, eating dinner as loud as they can to make sure he could hear them while they ate, even over the static noise of the telly.</p><p> </p><p>Harry hated it, he hated <em> them </em>, but there wasn’t a thing that he could do about it. If Dumbledore didn’t think that starvation and imprisonment were heavy enough crimes to let him leave the Dursleys’ house forever, then Harry didn’t even want to know what the Headmaster would say about what they were doing now.</p><p> </p><p>Secretly, Harry didn’t want to do anything about it either. It was humiliating that his relatives could treat him like this, that he <em> let </em>them treat him like this. He was terrified of someone finding out what was really going on. Fortunately, most of the wizarding world didn’t even know the Dursleys names, so his secret was relatively safe. For now. But if it ever got out…</p><p> </p><p>Everyone would lose faith in him. If Harry couldn’t even handle a couple of dimwitted Muggles, how was he to handle the most powerful and intelligent dark wizard of the century?</p><p><br/>
