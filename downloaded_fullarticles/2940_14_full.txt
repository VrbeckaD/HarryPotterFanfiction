<p align="center">
  <b>Fall 2001</b>
</p>
<p>Kingsley Shacklebolt looked with some amount of exasperation at the four young aurors sprawled in his office chairs. Ginny’s hair was coming out of its plait and she somehow seemed to have damaged her shield vest, which Kingsley had thought was impossible. Part of it was smoking slightly from a ragged hole. Harry’s robe was missing a sleeve, or was it missing everything except a sleeve? Draco’s leg was oozing blood slowly from a long, shining cut and Ron was completely covered in….soot? Dirt? It was hard to tell underneath the pungent green slime that dripped over all of them (and seemed fully resistant to standard cleaning charms). Four stubborn pairs of eyes glared at him from a variety of defensive positions -- crossed arms, raised chins, hunched shoulders. All except Draco, who lounged languidly in the uncomfortable chair like this was just another Tuesday in the drawing room at Malfoy Manor and the slime was his preferred hair product. Kingsley rubbed his hands over his face and sighed.</p>
<p>“This isn’t working,” he said.</p>
<p>Draco looked as if he was about to say something sneering but Ron punched him in the arm, earning himself a stinging hex from Draco’s seeker-fast reflexes.</p>
<p>“Are you <em> children? </em> Honestly,” Kingsley said before Harry and Ginny could get involved. “I know you all care about this work, <em> regardless of your opinions about each other, </em>” he finished quickly as they started to clamor with accusations.</p>
<p>“I thought you would be able to set aside your personal differences in service of the department. Clearly, I was wrong. You’re not leaving me a lot of choices here. You’ve seen how effectively the established auror teams work with each other. I’m not going to break up successful partnerships because the four of you can’t get your act together. SO.” He took a deep breath, considering what he was about to do.</p>
<p>“Harry, Ginny, you are no longer partners. Draco, Ron, same for you. We’re going to see how things go with a rearrangement.” He saw alarm rise in their faces, and honestly he felt more than a little alarmed as well. <em> They are about to be furious </em> , he thought, <em> but I think this gamble could pay off. Eventually. </em></p>
<p>“Draco, Harry, get used to each other. You’re partners now. Ron and Ginny, same with you. END OF DISCUSSION!” This last he had to practically thunder at them over their outbursts, which sounded highly unprofessional in content. “<em> Merlin. </em>I am the head of your department, control yourselves. I know you could all be really excellent if you could just get out of your own way. Go figure out how to clean yourselves up and try out being civil. I don’t want to have another conversation like this. And Ginny, please notify the Unspeakables about the new method you seem to have found to destruct their indestructible vests.”</p>
<p>Sulking, the four squelched out of his office. As he penned a memo to maintenance to come deal with the residual slime he thought to himself, <em> how on earth did we end up here? </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <b> <em>Chapter 1: After the War</em> </b>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>Winter 1999 - Summer 2000</b>
</p>
<p>It had been a grueling game. To everyone’s surprise (and Ron’s somewhat complicated joy), the Chudley Cannons were fielding a good team this year, and there was no getting around it: Puddlemere had been outplayed. They had even scored three times against Oliver Wood, one of the best Keepers in the current league -- some would argue the best in decades. Despite Ginny’s individual prowess, the Cannons chasers seemed to play more seamlessly as a unit and had executed some really remarkable interceptions. The incredibly low-scoring game ultimately came down to the Seeker, which was not how they liked to leave it, because even with a world-class flyer like Harry there was an added element of luck. That added element today had been a well-timed bludger from the Cannons that had knocked Harry bodily away from the win.</p>
<p>The subdued Puddlemere team did a brief initial review of the game in their locker room that they knew would be converted into strategic planning under Oliver’s guidance the next day. Nursing sore muscles, the players gradually wandered towards the showers, except Harry, who had stripped down to his breeches and was examining his bludger injury with his captain. It had hit him in the ribs and although his Quidditch leathers had prevented fractures, a deep purple bruise was already blooming across his olive skin and it clearly hurt him to breathe. Harry went very still as Oliver did an initial inspection with his hands and then a second inspection with spells, determining which types of healing charms and potions would suit the injury. It was standard practice now for captains to receive basic healer training since accidents were so common even in routine practice. Some gentle spells shimmered over Harry’s torso and the bruising began to lessen.</p>
<p>“I think you could benefit from some extra support for a couple of days, mate,” Oliver said, unspooling a roll of muggle medical gauze. “I’m going to wrap you up muggle-style, okay? Just lift your arms up a little bit, not too high, and I’ll bring this around you.”</p>
<p>His arms encircled Harry as he gently wrapped his torso and despite his discomfort, Harry felt a curious sense of energy. He was suddenly very aware of Oliver’s warmth and the brush of his arms, and when Oliver circled around the front their eyes met. They momentarily froze in their motions, seized by some unexpected connection. Harry’s breath hitched and Oliver’s jaw slackened slightly before he shook his head as if clearing it and continued his treatment.</p>
<p>Unnoticed by either of them, Ginny had caught this interaction on her way to get something from her locker. A small frown creased her brow as she walked away.</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>…………</b>
</p>
<p>“Good practice today, Harry,” said Oliver. “I think these trick snitches are going to be a real innovation.” Ron’s involvement with Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes had led to a line of Quidditch-related products, including trick snitches originally meant for adding amusement to casual games but that had proven useful for professional practice. The snitches could blink out of existence in one part of the field and re-form in another, achieve top speeds well beyond regulation equipment, and become harder to spot due to a partial disillusionment charm. Practicing with them improved seeker observational skills and agility. Harry had really demonstrated in practice today why he had been drafted immediately to the Puddlemere starting lineup.</p>
<p> As they walked off the field, Oliver draped an arm casually over Harry’s shoulders, their heads close together, deep in discussion of strategy. Seemingly of its own accord, Harry’s arm snaked up to wrap around Oliver’s waist. Ginny walked behind them with the rest of the team, who were all engaged in their own conversations about the innovative practice techniques. She added a comment here and there but her attention was focused on the two attractive men walking ahead of her in an unexpectedly cozy position. Her eyes widened as if in sudden realization.</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>…………</b>
</p>
<p>Harry was pleasantly warm from the wine they had had with dinner and he basked in the relaxed conversation he shared with Ginny. At some point for <em> this </em>him, post-Voldemort him, she had become his best friend. They saw each other nearly every day as they traveled with the team and spent time with their shared family. They had taken things slow in their courtship, but that suited them both fine. They hadn’t wanted to jump into anything after the war. Ginny was the only other person who had experienced something close to the connection he had with Voldemort. She understood that he needed time to sort out his thoughts and experiences.</p>
<p>He knew there were steps that people would probably be surprised to find out they hadn’t taken. They had kissed a lot in the beginning, trying to recapture the feeling of their Hogwarts days, but they had ended up feeling like they needed to start from whether they were now. It was confusing to their friends why they slept in separate rooms at Grimmauld Place when they were in London (something they had been able to conceal for a year until Ron and Hermione moved in on the third floor), or why the most public affection they displayed was the occasional joking elbow to the ribs or ruffling of hair.</p>
<p>But their intimacy was their own...type. The kind of intimacy formed by moments waking up in her arms with her soothing touch on his forehead, the lingering effects of a nightmare and the feeling of a shout in his throat fading away. The kind of intimacy formed by ganging up on Ron and trying to pull over a prank on George. The kind of intimacy formed by helping each other out of disgusting mud-and-sweat-soaked Quidditch leathers and falling asleep on the couches of foreign hotel rooms in exhaustion. The kind of intimacy that just...didn’t leave a lot of room for other kinds of intimacy. But Harry loved her and their relationship, so he thought the rest would come as they healed. He assumed. In the meantime, he was just enjoying the comfort of her warm, teasing presence.</p>
<p>It took him a moment to notice that Ginny was looking at him intently over their dessert -- or what remained of it, since treacle tart never lasted long in front of Harry. His curiosity heightened  when she cast a muffliato charm to shield their conversation from the other diners. Harry looked at her questioningly.</p>
<p>“What’s up, Gin?”</p>
<p>“So when are we going to shag, Harry?”</p>
<p>He nearly choked, descending into a coughing fit as Ginny grinned at him lovingly. </p>
<p>“<em>Merlin, </em>Harry, the look on your face. I have never dated a man less committed to getting in my pants.”</p>
<p>“I’m just not… we agreed it was best to take things slow…you said that was fine,” Harry stammered.</p>
<p>“And it <em> is </em> fine, Harry.” She reached across the table and took his hands reassuringly in hers. “We knew things were going to be different after the war and it would take us some time to find our rhythm. But it’s been years now, and we <em> have </em>found our rhythm. It’s just... to me, it’s clearly as friends.”</p>
<p>Harry had to protest. “But...Ginny...I love you, I can’t <em> imagine </em> my life without you.”</p>
<p>“I love you too, Harry, and I certainly don’t plan on going anywhere. But can you honestly tell me that if I stopped calling you my boyfriend that anything about our relationship as it is would change?”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>“Think about it, Harry. Really think about it. We’re roommates. Teammates. Best friends. We drink tea in the morning and fight over the sports section in the Prophet and stopped kissing each other with any real determination ages ago. I’ve seen you naked sixteen ways that definitely aren’t sexy. And you’re part of my family regardless of whether you’re <em> with </em>me.”</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath and then sagged in defeat. “I’m sorry, Ginny. I want to be what you need, but -”</p>
<p>Ginny cut him off. “You <em> are </em>what I need, Harry. No one knows me better or makes me feel more comfortable. What we have is fantastic. It’s just...a fantastic friendship.”</p>
<p>She squeezed his hand and he realized that he was feeling something akin to a mixture of gratitude and relief. And love, so much love, as if… as if for a sister. <em> Merlin, she was right. </em></p>
<p>He barely had a moment before these warm feelings became alarm when he heard her say,</p>
<p>“And as your friend I want to encourage you to consider that maybe it isn’t <em> time </em> you need to want to shag me. Maybe what you need is someone else.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Ginny,” said Harry sadly. “You’re beautiful and you’re my best friend. If I can’t make it work with you, I don’t know how I’d make it work with someone else.”</p>
<p>She gave a small smile. “You can think I’m beautiful without wanting to shag me, Harry. I’ve been thinking lately that…” she trailed off.</p>
<p>“That…?” Harry prompted.</p>
<p>“That...maybe I don’t have the right...body parts,” she finished carefully. Harry stared.</p>
<p>“I think, Harry, that if you asked the <em> very </em>dreamy Oliver Wood on a date, he would say yes. Now finish your tart before I steal it from you.”</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>…………</b>
</p>
<p>It was a toss-up which news was bigger: that Quidditch stars Oliver Wood and Harry Potter were dating each other, or that Quidditch stars Ginny Weasley and Harry Potter were NOT dating each other. The media was determined to create a frenzy of drama where there wasn’t any, seemingly unable to grasp the idea of “casual dating” that so far defined Harry and Oliver’s relationship, or the fact that Harry and Ginny seemed to be as close as ever and were still living together. Ridiculous gossip abounded, but internally all was calm. The only thing that really mattered to Harry was how the team responded. Once it became clear that (as Ginny predicted) nothing between Harry and Ginny had really changed and that the team wasn’t going to suffer from love triangle drama, everything settled down except for ticket sales, which were through the roof. Speculation on the team was that crowds were hoping for a glimpse of Ginny’s trademark temper, but they had been disappointed -- at least when it came to her own teammates. </p>
<p>“Oh for Godric’s sake,” Ginny scoffed, plopping down on the living room sofa and flinging <em> Witch Weekly </em>down on the table. “Apparently your new boy toy is Draco Malfoy? What will they think of next.”</p>
<p>Harry looked at the cover, featuring a slightly grainy photo he didn’t even know existed, of a moment that looked more intimate than he would have imagined at the time. Not that he didn’t remember the moment. He remembered it very clearly, because it was the only moment in his memory when Draco Malfoy had let his sarcastic veneer slip and said something Harry had been certain was completely sincere. At some point during this contemplation he realized he was just staring at the photo, while Ginny looked at him with a look of increasing speculation.</p>
<p>“....Unless he is your boy toy?” she said with curiosity.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous,” Harry said, “they’re just mad you and I aren’t giving them any good gossip lately. This was after the Malfoy hearing last year, hardly <em> date material </em>. He stopped me in the lobby and I wanted to… well I wanted to tell him I had done the best I could.”</p>
<p>“I think he heard you, mate,” said Ginny. “Practically need to cast a cooling charm just with that photo in the house. I wouldn’t say no to Draco Malfoy looking at <em> me </em> like that.”</p>
<p>Harry laughed. “Don’t let Bradley hear you say that.”</p>
<p>“Keep up, Harry, Bradley is <em> so </em> two weeks ago.”</p>
<p>Harry considered the photo again incredulously. “Honestly, though, apparently seven year’s complete hatred is what counts as passion now?”</p>
<p>“More passion than <em> I </em> got from you,” Ginny pouted exaggeratedly, then laughed as Harry threw a sofa pillow at her.</p>
<p>“Might consider it Harry, he’s a fit bloke these days. I hear he’s even sold Malfoy Manor. Has a flat in London like a normal person. Probably looks like Versailles though,” she scoffed. “You can take the Malfoy out of the manor, <em> et cetera</em>.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, still Malfoy. Seriously, Ginny. Besides, I’m dating Oliver,” Harry said, without much conviction.</p>
<p>“Are you dating Oliver, or are you dating a book about Quidditch tactics?”</p>
<p>“I think I heard Kreacher from the other room,” Harry said, walking hastily towards the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Tell him about the Kenmare Kestrels 1997 seeker statistics!” Ginny called after him.</p>
<p>“Arse,” he said under his breath, smiling.</p>
<p>As Harry wandered into the kitchen for another cup of coffee (Kreacher was taking a day off, as Ginny well knew), his mind wandered back to that strange memory in spite of himself. Malfoy had caught up to him in the lobby of the ministry following the unusual hearing when his father had spoken under veritaserum to try to clear the family name before he died. Harry had heard that Lucius had since stabilized and was living out his days under house arrest in France. But he would never forget the physical effort it had taken Lucius to speak at that hearing nor the anguished faces of his wife and son. It had taken all of Harry’s <em> Chosen One </em>influence to get everyone to agree to let it take place at all. He wasn’t sure how much of a difference it had made, except to one person.</p>
<p>Draco’s face at the hearing had still had the pinched and haunted look of a teenager pushed past all endurance, and his face when he had called Harry’s name in the lobby was full of emotions too strong to conceal under his old Malfoy sneer. When Harry turned to face him, he had said something quietly to his mother, who released her white-knuckled grip from her son’s sleeve and went to wait for him by the fireplace that would take them to St. Mungo’s.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry about your father,” Harry had said, without preamble. “I did everything I could, but…”</p>
<p>Seemingly unable to speak, Draco had actually reached out and clasped Harry’s forearm, looking at him with a sincerity Harry didn’t know he possessed.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Draco had said. “I know you did. Thank you for...for what you did for my family. We...we only have each other now and…” he broke off, still gripping Harry’s arm, and trying to convey with his face what he was unable to say. Harry had reached up and gently squeezed Malfoy’s shoulder, looking back with understanding at his old enemy.</p>
<p>Watching this gesture splashed across the cover of the magazine on his coffee table like any other celebrity gossip, he felt the all-too-familiar pained annoyance of yet another private moment invaded. That he had had a private moment of that level of intensity with Draco Malfoy was a thought for another day. Passion? A type of it, he supposed. He shook his head and took his coffee back out to Ginny. Regardless of her teasing, she had promised to help him plan a non-sports-related date with Oliver.</p>
<p align="center"><b>…………</b> </p>
<p>“No Oliver?” said Ginny, as she tucked into her breakfast across from Harry at a small cafe in Hogsmeade. They had just finished the season with a home game and Harry was shocked to realize how long it had been since he’d had time to visit Ron and George at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. He saw them as often as Ginny did at family dinners at the Burrow, but even those had been sporadic lately. They had so many games on the continent and he felt like when they were in London they were either training or passed out from exhaustion. Ron and George were going to leave the shop with their capable manager and join Harry and Ginny for breakfast, but Harry wasn’t surprised they had beat them there. By a lot. Something always seemed to happen last-minute at the shop. They had given up and ordered breakfast half an hour ago.</p>
<p>“We broke up last night,” said Harry as he buttered a slice of toast. “It was amicable, though, not like we had been making big plans for the future. I’m sure you’re not surprised.”</p>
<p>“No,” admitted Ginny. “It’s a shame, though, he is <em> gorgeous </em>.”</p>
<p>Harry grinned. “And a phenomenal kisser.”</p>
<p>“And phenomenal other things, if the sounds I heard from down the hall were any…”</p>
<p>“Hey!” said Harry. “That’s none of your business!”</p>
<p>“If you don’t want it to be my business, take the three seconds to cast a silencing charm,” Ginny said unabashedly. “Anyway, this Quidditch captaincy is his dream. I can see how he wouldn’t have room for anything else right now.”</p>
<p>“Got it in one,” said Harry, just as Ron and George walked up.</p>
<p>“Ooh bacon, I’m starving!” exclaimed Ron, reaching automatically for Ginny’s plate. She slapped his hand away.</p>
<p>“Order your own, Ronald, or I’ll give you a pig’s tail like Harry’s cousin,” Ginny said, reaching for her wand. He backed off.</p>
<p>As the waitress came by to take the new orders, Harry said, “Any chance of Hermione joining us? She was already at the hospital when we got up this morning.”</p>
<p>“Actually it’s her day off at St. Mungo’s, so yes, she’ll be along later,” said Ron. “She’s out with Pansy right now, something about a gift for Neville.”</p>
<p>Ginny choked and Harry’s bite of toast fell inelegantly from his open mouth. “I’m sorry, I seem to have misheard absolutely everything you just said. She’s <em> what </em> with <em> who </em>now?”</p>
<p>“Pansy.” said Ron, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “Neville’s birthday is coming up and apparently she’s up to something elaborate that she can’t do alone. Actually, we’re hoping to have a party for both of you at Grimmauld Place since you’re here next week, been meaning to mention.”</p>
<p>“Pansy...Parkinson?” said Ginny.</p>
<p>Ron stared at her. “Wait… you know Pansy and Neville are dating, right? Almost a year now, I think. They’re serious.”</p>
<p>“Pansy,” said Harry intelligently, “and Neville. Longbottom. Our Neville. Wait, the same Pansy who <em> tried to turn me over to Voldemort </em>?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, she was terrified, wasn’t she? That wasn’t an easy time for anyone,” said Ron, “even Slytherins.”</p>
<p>“Oh don’t look at us like that,” said George in response to Harry’s very raised eyebrows. “Pansy’s a right laugh once you get to know her. She and Hermione are thick as thieves now. <em> Scary </em> together, though,” he said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“I know <em> I </em> sleep with one eye open,” Ron said with a laugh. “Remember that tickling hex they put on my pajamas?”</p>
<p>“Course I do, I helped them do it!” said George. “You should have seen it coming, mind you, Hermione hates your Cannons pajamas.”</p>
<p>“So…so...” Harry struggled to accept what his friends were telling him at face value. “So...Neville and Pansy got started through...Hermione?”</p>
<p>“Yep,” said Ron. “They started spending time together when Neville and Hermione were working with Draco on that stabilizing potion for Lucius.”</p>
<p>“Um.” said Harry. “Completely ignoring for a second the fact that you are calling Malfoy <em> Draco </em> , I thought he and Pansy were dating?” <em> Although apparently everything he believed about the world was wrong? </em></p>
<p>“<em>Merlin, </em>no,” Ron chuckled. “They’re like you and Ginny.” He gestured in their general direction with a piece of bacon Ginny hadn’t seen him take. “Friends, roommates, all that. Malfoy’s gay. It’s not like that’s a secret.”</p>
<p>Ginny and Harry stared at each other. “Harry,” said Ginny. “Apparently we have no idea whatsoever what is going on at home anymore.”</p>
<p>Harry’s brow furrowed. <em> Had they really been away so much? So caught up in their own world? </em> Well they had to have been to have missed such a significant shift in their friends’ lives. Come to think of it, when had he last seen Neville? Hell, when had he last spent more than a few seconds with Hermione before one of them had to rush off somewhere? And family dinners were always so chaotic, everyone talking at once about whatever…. And Malfoy was <em> gay </em>?</p>
<p>“Okay,” sighed Harry, pouring himself more tea. “You had better start at the beginning.”</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p align="center">
  <b>Summer 1998 - Summer 1999</b>
</p>
<p>Draco woke with a start, his body immediately complaining from the hard chair where he had fallen asleep. It took him several seconds to remember where he was and why, and then he buried his face in his hands and tried to slow his pulse. The soothing pale green of the walls in the Janus Thickey spell damage ward at St. Mungo’s could do nothing to counteract the vaguely antiseptic smell and claustrophobic feel of too many people with too little privacy. He was grateful for the curtained areas throughout the ward, but saying it was a step down from Malfoy Manor would be a gross understatement. The light was dim through the spelled windows and a quick check of the clock on the wall confirmed it was early morning. Or was it early evening? Honestly he didn’t know anymore.</p>
<p>He stood carefully, stretching his sore back and shoulders, and surveyed the scene before him with a grim resignation. His mother was still asleep, in a chair she had had the sense to transfigure into something more comfortable. And his father… Draco’s breath caught and his eyes prickled. He knew his father on the whole was not...a good man. Had not been a good man. But he had never doubted his father’s love for him. Pride in him. And he had idolized him almost past the point of destruction. He had never imagined that he would see him like this. Helpless, dependent, with no fight left. Dying.</p>
<p>Looking back, he should have known that something was seriously wrong after the incident in the Hall of Prophecy. The Dark Lord had been terrifyingly angry and he had cursed Lucius, apparently permanently. But in front of Draco, his father had made it seem like the situation was salvageable. Like Draco should be proud of the task set to him and what it would mean for the family. And he had spoken so much like he always had, that Draco hadn’t noticed the tremor in his hands, or the haunted look behind his eyes -- but he remembered them now, now that he knew his father had been trying to protect him still, had been trying to keep him blissfully unaware of just how much danger their little family had been in even then. How much danger Draco had been in as he became a good soldier like his father. How much more the danger would have been if he hadn’t fallen in line. He knew later, of course, how wrong things had gone. But he hadn’t even found out about the extent of it himself until the hearing yesterday.</p>
<p>To his surprise, his family hadn’t been expected to stand trial. Harry Potter had apparently spoken on their behalf in a private inquiry, testifying to his and his mother’s motivations and actions. Lucius wasn’t being tried on account of his impending death and the fact that the courts were already overrun. Draco didn’t know how to process the fact that he now owed Harry Potter his own life <em> and </em> his family’s freedom. It was too much. It was too unexpected.</p>
<p>The hearing had been equally unexpected, apparently the result of Potter’s influence as well, at his father’s request. To the dismay of Lucius’ healers, he had asked to leave St. Mungo’s to speak to the full Wizengamot, with his family present. With everyone present. Under the influence of veritaserum. It was more than unexpected -- it was unprecedented. He wanted the world to understand, he said, that his wife and son should not be punished for his crimes and that regardless of his personal beliefs and actions, everything he had done at the end of the war was ultimately to protect his family. This hearing was his last act to protect their future. Draco and everyone else heard the full truth for the first time. And he knew from the hard looks on the faces in the room that it wasn’t enough. His father would always be a villain, and Draco would be too. But he was glad that people had to hear, whether they accepted it or not, that things hadn’t been black and white. Lucius had collapsed at the end as his disapproving healers whisked him swiftly back to St. Mungo’s to try to stabilize him. That had been yesterday, and today there was only exhaustion. As he transfigured his chair to match his mother’s, a trim figure appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>“I found you a flat,” Pansy said. “Come and get some breakfast with me, alright? I know you’re not going to take care of yourself right now, but I can take care of you.”</p>
<p>In spite of himself, his brain automatically filled in the suggestive banter that was characteristic of their friendship, though he couldn’t make the words leave his mouth. Apparently Pansy saw something in his expression though, and the corners of her eyes crinkled fondly.</p>
<p>“Good. I see you’re still in there somewhere.”</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>…………</b>
</p>
<p align="left">“If we’re going to live together, we need to do something about this decor,” said Pansy one evening a few weeks later. They were curled up in opposite corners of the couch in the vast, nearly empty living room while Draco finished his latest round of inquiry letters for potions mastery programs. In her true Slytherin style, Pansy had never asked if she could move in to the flat near St. Mungo’s she had found for Draco and his mother. She had just sort of appeared and never left. Draco didn’t mind. He liked the company and it certainly wasn’t as if the flat wasn’t big enough.</p>
<p>“You can do whatever you want with it,” he said distractedly. Her eyes gleamed.</p>
<p>“Really? Anything?” she said. This got his attention.</p>
<p>“No,” he said. “I wasn’t thinking about who was talking to. Ground rules: tasteful, comfortable, nothing like the manor, nothing like Slytherin common room. And exercise restraint appropriate to the knowledge that I almost certainly won’t be able increase the family fortune in the future because everyone hates me and I can’t get a job.”</p>
<p>“Sold,” said Pansy. “And <em> I </em>don’t hate you. But while we’re on the topic of your family fortune, I was over at the manor going through records, and -”</p>
<p>“You went to the <em> manor </em>? Do you have any idea how dangerous that is right now? It’s practically covered in curses.”</p>
<p>“I am <em> well </em>aware, your mother said it was fine as long as I went with an auror who owes me a favor. Incidentally, you need to have someone clean out the curses. But I knew you and Narcissa don’t have any interest in the family business right now, and I don’t have anything to do, and I have a reasonably good sense of your holdings now, so… well you know I’m excellent with money, even if I like spending it.”</p>
<p>“This is true,” said Draco. No one had ever gotten away with swindling another student in Slytherin under Pansy’s watchful eye.</p>
<p>“Pansy,” said Draco, suddenly decisive, “Will you run our lives?”</p>
<p>She grinned. “Darling, I thought you’d never ask.”</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>…………</b>
</p>
<p>Draco fell into a sort of routine after that. He studied during the day, sometimes at his father’s bedside in St. Mungo’s and sometimes in their flat, and tried to stay out of Pansy’s way as she decorated their home, his job just to dispense gold to her various vendors. She seemed to know exactly the right balance of sweetness, iron will, and nonspecific threats to get them all to do exactly as she said for the best possible price. As Draco studied for his potions N.E.W.T.s he felt like he was watching her discover her true calling. <em> There is more than one way to be a Slytherin </em>, he thought, and hoped he could make that true for himself. At night Pansy regaled them with tales of her deviousness in their increasingly tasteful and comfortable home, and they tried to coax Narcissa into the occasional smile.</p>
<p>Given the strange situation of the past year, students who felt clear on their career direction and ready to take their N.E.W.Ts had been given the option of taking the test early and forgoing a return to Hogwarts. Draco had taken this opportunity eagerly. He had no desire to face the ridicule and scrutiny he would almost certainly endure back in the castle. It wasn’t lost on him that he had once been the perpetrator of that very type of ridicule. It wasn’t cowardice that prevented him from going back, he told himself, it was that it was so far from his family. Although his father had been placed in a potions-induced sleeping state, he and his mother still went to be with him and talk to him. The healers had said it could be helpful. Once a week they woke him for an hour. It was all they could risk while they continued to look for a more permanent solution. It was the first time their family fortune couldn’t buy them progress.</p>
<p>Late on a rainy winter evening, a rosy-cheeked Pansy was explaining triumphantly how she had finally developed an easy-to-implement layered warding charm, when a sharp rapping on the window froze their conversation. The owl outside had a bright green scroll tied to its leg, and as they unrolled the message Draco already had a sinking feeling what it would say. Lucius had gotten worse.</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>…………</b>
</p>
<p>“The curse seems to be...solidifying, for lack of a better word,” the healer told them. “With blood curses like these, things can change so quickly because it’s not localized.”</p>
<p>“Is there anything you can do?” Narcissa asked, helplessly.</p>
<p>“Hard to say, as it’s a unique case,” said the healer. “We’re learning what we can and we have some staff who are working on things from a research perspective, but they have to balance their time with their healer duties. There is one intern who has taken a particular academic interest, she can’t stop a puzzle once she’s started, but the healers have been thinking that the key is really going to lie in herbology and none of them has the expertise or the ability to give it their full attention.”</p>
<p>“I do,” said a soft voice from behind them, before they could reply to the healer. Draco turned to find Neville Longbottom, of all people, stepping out from a curtained area at the other end of the ward. “I’m starting my mastery soon but right now I’m just studying for my N.E.W.T.s, I… I have time.”</p>
<p>“Neville, I didn’t know you were visiting your parents today,” said the bubbly healer. “Draco, the two of you must have been in the same year at Hogwarts, I think?” They both nodded stiffly. “Well, you know then that Neville has <em> quite </em> the reputation in herbology.” Neville’s cheeks pinked, whether at the memory of their association in school or at the compliment, Draco couldn’t tell.</p>
<p>“Honestly if you’re interested, Neville, it might mean real progress. Pomona told me you’re the best she’s seen in years.” Now the blush was definitely from the compliment.</p>
<p>“Neville,” said Draco tightly, “We should go talk privately.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, go catch up,” said the healer cheerily, completely oblivious to the tension in the room. “If you decide to work together I’ll make an appointment for you to meet with our enthusiastic intern and she can catch you up on our progress so far.”</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>…………</b>
</p>
<p>“<em>Granger?” </em> exclaimed Malfoy, burying his face in his hands as Neville approached the cafe table with the bushy-haired young woman who was almost certainly the intern who couldn’t resist a puzzle. “ <em> Merlin, </em>this just keeps getting better,” he said into his palms.</p>
<p>“That is most definitely Hermione to you now, ferret,” she said briskly as she sat down across from him. “Or maybe ‘O Great One Whose Forgiveness I Beg For Being A Rotten Arse Forever.’” Neville snorted. Draco glared.</p>
<p>She gestured at his sad, half-eaten meal. “Too good for the food at lowly St. Mungo’s?”</p>
<p>“I most definitely am,” he snapped back. Hermione raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Neville, I was under the impression from talking to you that I would be working with a changed man. So far I feel like I’m going to end up hitting him again.”</p>
<p>“I thought healers could do no harm,” said Draco, with some alarm. He remembered that slap all too well.</p>
<p>“I am not a healer yet,” said Hermione sniffily. “Besides, you’re not my patient.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry mate,” said Neville, eyes leaking with suppressed merriment, “If she hits you hard enough for you to become a patient, she’ll make sure you get the best care.”</p>
<p>The tension broke a little as Draco smirked slightly in spite of himself.</p>
<p>“See?” said Neville. “He’s smiling at his own expense. Never thought I’d see the day. Besides, I never said he was a changed man. I said that we had found that maybe we had more in common than we had realized.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” said Hermione dubiously.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Neville. “No one can understand better than I do what it’s like to try to be the person your family wants you to be. It’s a lot of pressure. Not a lot of room to figure out what you want yourself.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes I think I got off easy, mate,” said Draco, warming up in spite of himself. “How long did it take them to figure out what your gran had done to Dawlish when they sent him to get her?”</p>
<p>“Three weeks, and he couldn’t stop itching,” chuckled Neville. “She’s terrifying.”</p>
<p>“Women are terrifying,” said Draco. “You should see Pansy when a contractor tries to revise an estimate.”</p>
<p>They both laughed and Hermione looked at them speculatively.</p>
<p>“Okay,” she said. “As long as you remember that women are terrifying, I think we can work together.”</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>…………</b>
</p>
<p>They worked together surprisingly well, and Draco started to feel something like hope. He had always been resentful of Granger’s intellect, making it harder for him to excel in school, to represent the Malfoy name. But now he had only gratitude. She was brilliant. Draco and Neville both brought valuable specific knowledge, but Hermione was the one who saw the connections, the bigger picture. They mostly worked spread out over tables in the cafeteria at St. Mungo’s, but eventually Draco acknowledged this was ridiculous.</p>
<p>“Maybe we should start working somewhere more comfortable,” he said.</p>
<p>Hermione stretched and winced. “I would say we should go to my mum and dad’s, but this is still all a bit new to them. Same goes for Ron, not that we’d be able to spread out much in the flat above the shop.” Ron had joined them for lunch a few times, but it had been uncomfortable. He said he was happy she had found some people to study for N.E.W.T.s with “regardless of who they were” and left it at that. Well, almost. Draco could have sworn he felt a light stinging hex as Ron left.</p>
<p>“That would still be a bit much for <em> me</em>,” Draco said drily. “He’s just so easy to annoy, I can’t help myself.” Hermione glared and he laughed. “I actually live nearby and we have plenty of room, just let me send ahead to Pansy so she knows we’re coming. Merlin knows what she gets up to when she’s there by herself.” He cast a quick patronus, which soared away before they could see its shape.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Draco, you’ve seen how it’s been with Ron, I didn’t sign on for Pansy,” said Hermione nervously.</p>
<p>“But you signed on to help my father?” he said. He wasn’t sure this was the moment to bring it up, but it had been on his mind for weeks and it came out before he could stop it.</p>
<p>“Well,” Hermione said somewhat sheepishly, “I didn’t know it was your father when I first saw the medical files. I was just looking through recent patient intakes for interesting cases, and it was the most interesting one I had ever seen, I was so engrossed by the time I realized who it was…” she broke off as she saw a shuttered look take root in Draco’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh Draco,” she said, “be fair, you know I couldn’t have been thrilled to help him.”</p>
<p>He sighed. “I know. I know what he did to you. Or...didn’t do for you. But...he’s still my father.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Hermione kindly. “And he’s a patient like any other. It’s not my place as a healer to decide who deserves care, and that’s a lesson I needed to learn as fast as possible. But I’m glad I’m helping him... for you. For who you are now.”</p>
<p>Something prickled in Draco’s eyes and he looked away. He felt he didn’t deserve their friendship, and knowing that they were his friends despite everything that had come before somehow meant more. He shook himself.</p>
<p>“Well, I think you will find Pansy largely unchanged, although hopefully you’ll...eventually...come to see why I love her so much,” he said.</p>
<p>Neville smiled. “Is it serious then?”</p>
<p>Draco blinked. “I’m sorry?”</p>
<p>“You and Pansy, do you reckon she’s the one?”</p>
<p>Draco laughed. “The one to keep me in line, sure, she’s my best friend. But I’m gay, I thought everyone knew.”</p>
<p>Neville choked and Hermione patted him on the back. “I think that was maybe only common knowledge in your house,” she said tactfully, “But it doesn’t change anything for us.”</p>
<p>“Might start talking to you about how fit Neville’s gotten, though,” she said with an exaggerated wink. Draco laughed at the expression on Neville’s face and headed towards home.</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>…………</b>
</p>
<p>The three of them passed their N.E.W.T.s almost as an afterthought. Draco thought they probably knew more from the books Pansy had retrieved for their research during her supervised purge and sale of Malfoy Manor than they would be tested on even for a mastery. They had also had a breakthrough, and quickly enough to make a difference for his family.</p>
<p>“The house in France will be ready soon,” said Pansy, coming back into the room with bolts of fabric in her arms. She had taken her interior decorating skills to a new level for the pleasant home in the south of France, integrating magic into the home in ways that would allow Lucius to be self-sufficient when Narcissa wanted to spend time with her nearby family. Draco had been surprised to learn she had even been consulting Professor Flitwick. <em> Neville’s influence, perhaps? </em> As she put down the fabric on the sofa and walked past Neville, Draco thought he saw her fingers brush lightly across Neville’s shoulder as Neville briefly closed his eyes. <em> There’s something going on there, </em> he thought. Last week he had found them asleep on the couch, Pansy’s head resting on Neville’s shoulder. He wondered now if they had fallen asleep that way. It wasn’t like Pansy to be discreet in her interest -- although come to think of it, she hadn’t been. The first thing she’d done when he had brought them home weeks ago was look Neville slowly up and down and say, “Who are <em> you </em>, and what have you done with Neville Longbottom?” He smiled to himself. Neville had certainly changed after the war, and he felt like this new, confident Neville could probably handle his devious best friend. Probably. He didn’t know precisely how they had worked through their chequered past, but that was their business. </p>
<p>“I think this is as good as it’s going to get,” said Hermione, stoppering the potion and brushing her hair out of her face. “We knew full recovery was too much to hope for, but he’ll be stable enough for home care, walking around.” She grinned. “Not too bad for, what did Healer Smythewick call us? Uppity youngsters?"</p>
