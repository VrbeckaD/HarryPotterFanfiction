  <span>If you give Hermione a book,</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She's going to want to read it.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And because she's finished all the books in her library</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She's going to want to go to Hogwarts</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>To see if the library has stocked anything new.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When you get there</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>You're met by Draco Malfoy</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The new potions master.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco immediately teases her</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>About her insatiable quest for knowledge. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione teases him right back</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>About his insatiable quest for hair products</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And redemption of his family's name.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They continue to bicker</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As they've always done</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>(And probably always will do)</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Until you start to think that the books</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Have been forgotten.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But of course with Hermione</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Books are always a priority. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And Draco, knowing this, tells her</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That he can take her to a </span>
  <em>
    <span>real </span>
  </em>
  <span>library. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Of course, she bristles </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Because the Hogwarts library to her</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Is better than the one at Oxford,</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>At least in terms of memories </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And its large role in her life.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And then he tells her that </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> library </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Is even better than this one</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Because it has a more extensive collection </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>On the origins of magic</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And magical history.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Not to mention many rare texts</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And first editions.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And she knows</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>(And you know)</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That he's talking about Malfoy Manor.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She's reluctant to go, of course, </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Which is understandable,</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Given her past experiences there.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>(You know this, because she wakes up </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Screaming from nightmares </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And has to reassure herself </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That she's at home</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And not at the Manor,</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A name that makes her weep.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco’s name, however,</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Never does.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It just infuriates her</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As she tells you what ridiculous thing he's said now</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>To rile her up.)</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But somehow, he convinces her to go</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>(You think he hooks her in with a promise </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Of a first edition </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hogwarts, A History.</span>
  </em>
  <span>)</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>So off you go</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>To Malfoy Manor.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>You get to come, too,</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Although you wonder if it's just because</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The blond wizard</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Is trying to ingratiate himself</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>With Hermione.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>You arrive at the Manor</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And you can tell from Hermione’s face</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That it looks drastically different from the last time she was here.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remodeling the Manor</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Was an absolute necessity, Draco says,</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Because they needed to cleanse the walls and rooms</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Of all of that evil.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione looks mollified and pleased by this</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And so Draco leads her</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>(And you)</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Through the halls of his home</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Until you reach a set of double doors.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He throws them open </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>With a patented Malfoy flourish</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>To reveal what is admittedly the most glorious library</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That you or Hermione have ever seen.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>You're reminded of that movie Hermione likes</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Where the furry beast gives the girl </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A humongous library for her own</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Because of his newfound feelings for her.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Because of course the best way to a bookworm’s heart</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Is to give her more books than she's ever seen before in her life.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And that seems to be what's happening here</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Because as you're strolling behind them</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As Hermione oohs and awes</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And Draco points out special texts </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That are sure to capture her interest</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>You turn the corner and find them</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Locked in an embrace,</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A first edition of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hogwarts, A History</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>In Hermione’s hand--</span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The one that's not ensnared in Draco’s hair, that is.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His hands are entangled in her curls</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As they kiss as if their lives depended on it.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And you think that maybe they do,</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Because you can just see them </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Spending a long and happy life together</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Reading and bickering and loving each other </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Until death do them part.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And to think that Hermione discovered </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The love of her life</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And mountains of books--</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Both to keep her happy--</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>All because </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>If you give Hermione a book</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>...she's going to want to read it.</span>
