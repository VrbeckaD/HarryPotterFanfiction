    <p>There is something intrinsically wrong about watching a Noble weep. It's like a concentration of everything a vampire shouldn't be, all that power, all that threatening aura – all those dead people – and he's weeping over a dying girl. It's a lie, it has to be a lie, Nobles aren't like that – but he's still there on his knees weeping over a little mortal human being, uncaring about the two vampire hunters at his back, both after his blood.</p><p>And Leila's finger keeps failing to pull the trigger.</p><p>"Charlotte please, don't do this," the Noble whispers in shaking voice. "Charlotte, please, you can't leave me. Come back to me, please."</p><p>Leila grits her teeth, aiming her pulse gun square between his shoulders, just at the right angle to hit his heart. It would kill the girl too, but she's already dying – dying in the vampire's arms, so would it matter if she died too, it would just cut short the inevitable process. Hell at this point it would be mercy, probably – on so many levels and</p><p>And she still can't pull the fucking trigger!</p><p>"I'm sorry Meier," the girl whispers, her voice only barely there anymore. "It doesn't – seem we can make it to the stars after all. I wished, I hoped... I'm so sorry. It was such a beautiful dream."</p><p>"It's not a dream – we will get there," the Noble says quickly, though he's obviously a shitty liar – even the girl doesn't believe him, her weak smile twitching into territory of pity for a and the vampire noble bows his head. "We'll make it there, I promise you – I will take you there –"</p><p>Nonsense, all of it. She's going to be <em>dead</em> and he'd follow suit just as soon as Leila's hand would start damn working and just take him out. He'd deserve it too, all the people he left dead in his wake, Nolt and Borgoff and Kyle and –</p><p>"Damn it," Leila mutters and her vision blurs a little as her hand cramps in attempt of taking the shot that she doesn't actually want to do. "Damn it, damn it, what the hell is this –"</p><p>There's a presence to her right, the same vague sense of eldritch horror wafting off Meier Link, except this one is a little more familiar and infinitely colder. D steps out of the shadows, looking somehow paler than even usually against the backdrop of the ancient castle of Nobility with all of its gold and splendour.</p><p>Leila's eyes take him in almost desperately, looking for a way out in his expression – is he going to attack Meier and take the decision out of her hands, or will he put his sword down and give some sort of justification to her inability to pull the trigger?</p><p>Meier notices him too and glances over his shoulder at the dhampir, his face pulled to a snarl that falls a little short of threatening and lands somewhere in the neighbourhood of mortally wounded and dying instead – and then the girl's hand is on the vampire's cheek, weakly tugging at him, making him turn his face back to her, and she smiles.</p><p>"I'm so glad you're here, Meier," the girl murmurs. "I wouldn't want – to be anywhere else when I died... except right here, in your arms."</p><p>"Charlotte, please, <em>don't...</em>"</p><p>Leila hisses out a silent curse and, finally, pulls her gun up, to aim at the ceiling instead. It's so stupid, it's <em>so stupid</em> and he sounds so fucking pathetic, broken and withering, like it's him who's dying and not the girl and – and she never knew Nobles could sound like that. Could feel like that.</p><p>And it hits her, momentarily, that she's not only buying this fucking charade, but she believes him. Meier Link actually loves the girl wholeheartedly. What the fuck.</p><p>"Don't leave me," the Noble whispers, bowing his head and catching the girl's hand as it falls, its strength lost. He cradles the hand to his cheek, and the sound he makes can only be called a whimper. Leila can just imagine it; the fading warmth of human skin against the chill of a vampire's, all of it's just so fucking poetic it hurts to watch. Hurts to listen.</p><p>A movement draws her attention way, thankfully, and Leila looks instead at D, who is now moving in on Meier and the girl, slowly walking towards them. Is he going to do it, then? He's not holding his sword; it's safely in his sheath...</p><p>"Meier," D says, the cold even tone of his voice a terrible contrast to the wretched sound of Meier, hissing at him. "Move aside."</p><p>Damn, Leila thinks and quickly jumps down from her vantage point on a ledge overlooking the hall. D's more cold blooded than she thought, after everything.</p><p>"No," Meier snarls, clutching onto the girl with terrible, trembling gentleness. "You can't have her, not now."</p><p>"Move aside."</p><p>The girl is still breathing shallowly; walking closer Leila can see her face, deathly pale with blue lips and shadows under her eyes. It doesn't seem she can actually see anything though; her eyes stare listlessly in front of him, finding no purchase even on her beloved Noble's face.</p><p>"These are her final moments; you will not take them from me!" Meier growls at the dhampir.</p><p>D's expression doesn't change, still utterly icy, the bastard, but he's still not going for his sword either. Leila sidles closer, just in case... what, she's not sure, but if it comes down to these two idiot men fighting, she'll grab Charlotte and take her to safety – even if she's dying, she doesn't deserve death trampled by couple of idiots.</p><p>D looks down as the girl in Meier's arms lets out a shaky inhale – and then struggles to breathe again. His eyes narrow and he moves, faster than Leila can see, around Meier. As the vampire snarls, D ducks under his swinging, scythe like arm, and then, ducked low on his knees and single palm, the dhampir presses his left palm on Charlotte's forehead.</p><p>"Breathe," he orders.</p><p>Over her gun, now aimed at all three of them, Leila can see how Charlotte's fading eyes open wide and her mouth falls open in a rasping gasp of air. It looks painful – not like he gave her strength or anything like that, more like he's forcing her to find the last dregs in the bottom of what little of her own strength she had left.</p><p>Meier looks at the dhampir, then at the girl, opening his mouth and then, with all the speed of a Noble, switching tracks. "Can you save her?" he demands the dhampir, who looks down at the girl, at the two pinprick wounds at her neck.</p><p>"No," the dhampir says. "She's lost too much blood."</p><p>Meier's face twists and he looks down at the girl, who looks up at him in half panic. "Charlotte, please," Meier whispers to her. "Stay with me, just for a bit longer."</p><p>"Meier," the girl gasps and inhales again, deeply, almost mechanically. "I – I don't – I'm sorry, I'm so sorry my love –"</p><p>Why? Leila lowers her shaking gun, though she kind of feels like just throwing the thing at D because – why? However he's doing it, it's just prolonging the inevitable, and he's not doing it kindly. It looks like a terrible struggle now, not the peaceful slipping away Charlotte was doing before – why?</p><p>"Why?" Meier asks shakily, as he strokes his hand down the girl's cheek.</p><p>D doesn't say anything, watching them with nothing on his face – and something... terrible in his eyes. It reminds Leila of that moment in the rain, when they talked. Understanding, Leila thought then, was a terrible thing to have.</p><p>"To buy some time," the dhampir then says and shifts a little. As Leila steps closer, now standing at their side, the dhampir takes something from under his cloak that gleams red and crystalline in the light of what seems like million candles lighting the hall. At first Leila thinks it's those candy shaped synthetic blood pops she'd spied in his gear – but it isn't.</p><p>It's a stone – a crystal about long as his finger.</p><p>Meier says nothing, glancing at the thing and then ignoring it in favour of watching his lover breathe. D looks at the crystal with something worse than understanding in his eyes and then he bows his head.</p><p>Then he snaps the crystal in two between his fingers. The sound is eerily loud and sharp in the silence of Charlotte's mechanical breathing – but it has nothing on what follows.</p><p>It seems like a sound that Leila doesn't so much hear with her ears as she hears it with her <em>spine</em>, a crack that splits the air and echoes from the glowing, shining walls and floors all around them. It's loud enough to make Meier jump where he sits on his knees, but D doesn't so much as a twitch – he'd been expecting it, or something like it.</p><p>And then there is a fifth person in the hall.</p><p>A man in gold and red robes and cloaks stands beside D now, appearing out of fucking nowhere. Black haired, bespectacled and looking a rather expressively stunned, it takes Leila a moment to recognize him for what he is.</p><p>A Noble.</p><p>"D," the Nobleman says slowly, looking down, taking in the scene before him. Meier Link looks up and snarls at him, making the black haired man arch an eyebrow and then look at the girl between the blond Noble and the dhampir. Then he looks down.</p><p>There's a round red pendant on his chest – and its glowing blood red light down on the vampire, human and dhampir before him.</p><p>D glances up at him from under the brim of his hat, glancing at the pendant and then ignoring it in favour of the man himself. "Can you take her to a hospital?"</p><p>The strange Noble touches the pendant for a moment and then looks at the girl, something in his expression shifting. He too goes down on his knees and then, ignoring Meier's snarling, he checks the girl, touching her neck, checking the bite mark.</p><p>"This isn't real?" he says slowly. "There's no infection."</p><p>"It was an illusion," D says.</p><p>"Ah," the strange Noble says in understanding and looks at the girl. Then he snaps his fingers. "Retta!"</p><p>A soft pop and then yet another creature appears – this one distinctively non human. It's a gangly little thing wearing a silk tunic of all things, with big eyes and floppy ears. "Yes, Milordy Potter?" she asks, bowing her head.</p><p>"Get me Blood Replenishing Potions from the Hospital Wing, please."</p><p>The elf hesitates. "All the potions are – old," she says. "Retta doesn't think they are good anymore.</p><p>"Well, you know what to do. Time Turners – take as long as you need, but I need the potions now, please," the Noble says.</p><p>The little creature vanishes – and then instantly reappears again, holding a silver shaded tray and number of rounded crystal phials on it. The Noble checks them over and nods, taking one of them and turning to the dying human girl.</p><p>"What is that?" Meier demands.</p><p>"What it says on the tin," Potter answers and glances at D. "Blood replenishing."</p><p>D says nothing though his hand shifts a little, and Meier hesitates just long enough for Potter to force the girl to drink the potion. Charlotte makes a noise of objection but drinks it – it doesn't really look like she has any choice on the matter.</p><p>"Keep her breathing," Potter says to D, putting the phial back onto the tray the gangly creature is holding and watching Charlotte closely.</p><p>The effect of the potion isn't instant, but it is noticeable. Charlotte's lips lose their bluish tint and the shadows under her eyes lessen – though she still looks terribly pale. After moment of considering her, Potter takes another potion and makes her drink that too – this time with less struggle. She obviously felt the effect herself too.</p><p>"Charlotte," Meier whispers, his voice utterly broken with the sudden, new found hope, as the girl's colour turns from deathly pale into healthier pink and she blinks her eyes, probably regaining her vision from the blackness of bloodloss.</p><p>"Meier," the girl murmurs back, and her voice is trembling even worse. "I'm – I'm not going to –?"</p><p>"I'd like to see her under professional observation for a bit," Potter says, pressing a single, strangely blunt nailed finger under the girl's chin, testing her pulse. "But no, you're not going to die of bloodloss."</p><p>Meier's face crumbles and without a word he bows his head to the girl's chest and starts to sob.</p><p>"She's starting to breathe on her own now," a strange voice mutters. "You can let go now."</p><p>D lifts his palm and Leila thinks she sees something on it, before he closes his fingers and lowers it. Then D looks at the strange Noble he'd pretty much summoned – and Leila forgets all about the palm.</p><p>The look the pair shares over sobbing Meier and Charlotte, who goes from surprise and hope to disbelieving laughter, is full of meaning. Potter smiles a little uneasily, and D's face is blank but his eyes are full of mixed feelings. The eye contact between them is <em>intense</em>.</p><p>"So," Potter says slowly, almost wistfully. "Long time no see, D."</p><p>"... hm," the dhampir answers and stands up. The vampire Noble follows suit, resting a hand on the glowing pendant on his chest for a moment before looking away awkwardly.</p><p>"So, what happened here?" Potter asks and frowns up at the hall. "Where am I?"</p><p>"Castle of Chayte," D says quietly.</p><p>Potter says nothing for a moment, almost expectant. "I... have no idea what that is," he then admits.</p><p>Leila shakes her head and finally shoves her gun away to its holster. Meier is still sobbing like – well, a heartbroken Noble – and Charlotte has gone from laughter to soothing him, kissing his cheeks and running her hands up and down his shaking back, and it's so unbearably sweet that Leila can't stand to look at them anymore.</p><p>"Summoning a Noble out of nowhere," she comments to D. "That's some power you got, D."</p><p>That, of course, garners her the Noble's attention, and Potter looks at her with interest. "Hello," he says and then, of all things, holds out his hand. "Harry Potter, how do you do?"</p><p>Leila stares at the hand for a moment and then sighs. Fuck it. She shakes it. "Leila Marcus – a vampire hunter. Lovely to meet you." She's not even really lying.</p><p>The vampire's mild smile spreads a little. "Lovely to meet you too," he says, and he doesn't sound like he's lying either. Then he glances down at Meier and Charlotte – over whom they'd reached to shake their hands – and then at D. "So. What's going on?"</p><p>D looks away, at the castle. "I would like to know myself," he admits and his eyes slide over to Meier and Charlotte. "Why did you come here?"</p><p>Meier seems utterly beyond speaking, and it's Charlotte who looks up over his spiky blonde hair, running her fingers through it gently. "We got a letter from a Noblewoman here," she admits. "Meier knew of her. She promised us... sanctuary somewhere, where no one could come between us. In the City of Night. She had passage here, a ship..."</p><p>Potter's eyebrows arch and D's eyes narrow slightly. "And why would she promise that?"</p><p>"I..." Charlotte frowns. "She seemed... like a romantic. I though she was just being charitable because there... aren't that many Nobles left."</p><p>Potter runs a hand over his neck, looking at the girl and the Noble still weeping into her cloak and then he looks away. "City of night," he murmurs. "I think I've heard of that..."</p><p>"It was a colony in the void of stars, two light years from earth," D says quietly. "Nobles build it nearly seven thousand years ago. It's in ruins now."</p><p>"Ah," Potter says. "And the Noblewoman?"</p><p>"Carmilla Elizabeth Bathory," D says. "This is her castle."</p><p>That makes Potter turn to him sharply. "Carmilla, the Bloody Countess?" he asks, his voice going tense.</p><p>"She's dead," D says and frowns a little. "You know of her?"</p><p>Potter's lips press together tightly and he looks up. "I know about her," he agrees and looks around. "I didn't think she was still around."</p><p>"Does someone want to share with the class?" Leila asks, resting a hand on her waist while Charlotte finally manages to ease Meier through his bout of sobbing, and push him to a sitting position so that she, too, can sit up. Leila looks her over – she still looks a little pale but better – and then looks at D. "Who's Carmilla?"</p><p>"She was an especially vile Noblewoman. Vile enough that other Nobles found her abhorrent. She was supposedly slain by them, thousands of years ago," D says quietly. "Her heart was pierced with a silver sword."</p><p>"That should be enough to kill any Noble," Leila says thoughtfully.</p><p>Potter runs a hand over his chin, peering up at the castle. Then he looks at Charlotte and then at D. "You said the girl was bitten by an illusion – I take that was Carmilla's work?"</p><p>"She tried to use Charlotte to resurrect herself. I imagine that is why she lured them in here, to get at Charlotte," D says and looks at Meier who looks up sharply. "What I don't know is why. Carmilla put a lot of effort into getting Charlotte especially here, when she could have gotten anyone for far less effort. Why her?"</p><p>Charlotte's eyes widen a little and Meier frowns, wrapping an eye around her shoulders. "She's dead," he murmurs to her. "She cannot harm you anymore."</p><p>"Hm," Potter says, folding his arms and eyeing them thoughtfully. "You're sure Carmilla is dead? And not just in stasis, but properly dead? How?"</p><p>"I destroyed her spirit," D says.</p><p>Potter narrows his eyes.</p><p>"I ate it up," another voice comes from D's direction and the Dhampir lifts his hand. "It was <em>disgusting</em>."</p><p>"Ah," Potter says, his voice a little faint. "You ate her spirit. I... see." he shakes his head and then looks down at his chest – at the glowing pendant. "Well anyway, I can tell you why she might want this girl in particular," he says and touches the pendant. He holds it up a little, at Charlotte's direction, and it glows a little brighter. "She's a witch," he says, and it sounds almost reverent, the way he says it.</p><p>"Excuse me?" Meier demands in outrage, almost bristling. "How dare –"</p><p>"... witch in the sense that she has old magic, not the terrible-wicked-woman sense," Potter says, smiling a little, and then turning to D. "Magical person with magical blood."</p><p>"... that would explain it," D mutters, looking at the pendant in Potter's hand, which looks a lot like the blue one on D's chest.</p><p>Leila looks between them and then sighs. Fucking vampires. "Right, okay, wonderful, the witches and bloody vampires, whoopdedoo," she says and shakes her head. "Now what, though? Because in case you forgot," she aims a look at D. "We were contracted to get her," she nods at Charlotte, "back to her family. And away from the vampire. Who supposedly kidnapped her."</p><p>Instantly Charlotte clutches onto Meier. "He didn't and I won't – I won't go back," she says. "I won't leave Meier, not now, not ever."</p><p>"Yeah, we kind of got that by now," Leila says flatly and looks at D. "What now, D?"</p><p>The dhampir looks away, up at the stairs leading up to a pedestal, leading up to what looks like stone coffin. It's splattered with blood – that's probably where all of Charlotte's blood went. He presses his lips a little tighter together, looking displeases and then glancing at Potter.</p><p>Potter is watching the human-vampire couple strangely. "A bird may love a fish but where will they live?" he asks quietly and while Charlotte and Meier exchange desperate looks, he glances at D.</p><p>D looks back and then away. "How about the shoreline?" he offers and turns his back to Potter.</p><p>Potter opens his mouth to say something. "As parting words go, those are worse than the last ones I got," he mutters and looks away with a grimace.</p><p>"I was going to get my horse," D says dryly without turning around. "It cost me a lot of money and I'm not leaving it here."</p><p>"... oh," Potter says, a little sheepish now.</p><p>"What?" Meier asks, slowly standing up with Charlotte.</p><p>Potter shakes his head. "Never mind us," he says and then smiles. "Would you two like to come to stay at my castle?" he asks and motions around them. "It's not quite as fancy as this place but I can promise you – no one's going to bother you there."</p><p>Meier eyes him suspiciously. "Who are you?" he demands. "I – I am very grateful to you for saving Charlotte's life, but just who are you?"</p><p>"My name is Harry Potter. I'm the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft, Wizardry and Sorcery, and you, my dear," he turns to Charlotte, "as a witch you fall under my purview. Tell me, has anything strange ever happened around you?"</p><p>Charlotte eyes him with disbelief. "Stranger than <em>this</em>?" she asks faintly, motioning around them.</p><p>Leila snorts and shakes her head. This is insane. Bloody countesses and witches and now sorcery. And the famous dhampir vampire hunter being in some sort of... pact with a vampire. Why the hell not. "Hey can I come too?" she asks.</p><p>"The more the merrier," Harry Potter says and glances at her. "If you have anything you want to bring along, go get it now."</p><p>"Right-o," Leila says and frowns. Going back to the tank doesn't really appeal to her – she's not sure she wants to see the state Grove might be in. There is very little chance he survived that last attack and... It might have been long time coming, but still, she isn't sure she wants to know.</p><p>"I'll be right back," she says and turns to head away. And it doesn't strike her until she's already out of the hall, how easy it was to leave Charlotte and Meier alone with the strange vampire lord. How strange.</p><p>Harry Potter had no vampire's presence.</p>
