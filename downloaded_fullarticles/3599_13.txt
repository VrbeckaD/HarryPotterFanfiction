    <p>           Draco hadn’t been expecting anyone to walk in on him as he tried to collect himself in the girl’s bathroom on the first floor.  Most people tended to avoid Myrtle’s domain, well, except for him, of course… misery loves company and all that.  He was allowing himself the dubious pleasure of wallowing in his self-pity and the overwhelming enormity of the task he’d been assigned when he heard footsteps outside the bathroom and hastily wiped his eyes and covered his dark mark, still covered in red nail marks from where he’d angrily tried to scratch it off earlier… not that it ever worked.  The thing seemed to be stuck on him; he had figured that out the night he’d been forced to take it and spent the next two hours desperately flinging every painful hex he knew at it, trying to get it off while it was still fresh.  It hadn’t worked then, and now his pitiful attempts to claw it off were merely to relieve some of the aggression he felt towards the world and everyone in it, towards himself. </p><p>            He’d no sooner hastily buttoned the sleeve of his pressed white shirt over his forearm than he saw large green eyes peeking timidly out at him from a dark face topped with atrociously messy black hair.  Of course, Potter had been following him.  <em>Again.  </em>Of all the times he’d wished for Harry to take an interest in him, this year had to be the only point of his school career he’d wished for the exact opposite.  But then, here he was, savior of the wizarding world, Gryffindor’s golden boy, looking as if he’d only just now realized he’d made a mistake as he tried to back away unnoticed. </p><p>            “Potter!” he spat, injecting as much venom into his voice as he could muster, which wasn’t nearly approaching his usual levels of postulated haughty contempt. </p><p>            “Malfoy, I was just… I’m gonna, um…” the other boy looked as if he wasn’t sure quite <em>what </em>he wanted to do when faced with a situation so far away from what he’d expected. </p><p>            “What, spying on me now?  As if the hero of the wizarding world has nothing better to do with his time than stalk a mere Slytherin…” Draco’s face contorted with disgust, more towards himself than Potter, but he wasn’t to know that. </p><p>            “No! It wasn’t… I didn’t mean for, well, I shouldn’t have done… maybe I could help you?”  He ended his string of incoherent ramblings/apologies with an offer of aid and, dear gods, was that <em>hope </em>in his brilliant green eyes?  Draco felt sick, and he couldn’t quite forgive himself for wanting, so badly, to take the outstretched hand Potter offered, a mirror of their first year, despite what switching sides would do to his family, to his <em>mother.  </em></p><p>            “I’m not your pity project!” Draco spat at the Gryffindor, which he knew was probably false- Harry had a habit for extending a friendly hand to the weak and helpless, and he <em>hated </em>that that was what he, Draco Malfoy, was at the moment.  “I know perfectly well what I’m doing!”  Out of all the lies he’d told that day, this was the largest, but then again, a major part of him didn’t really <em>want </em>him to know what he was doing, now did it?</p><p>            “I…” but Draco didn’t give Harry a chance to finish, to say more, words that would no doubt lead to his willing undoing, before he fired off a hex from his wand.  Harry easily side-stepped, held up his hands, and tried to say something else, but Draco didn’t let him. </p><p>            As Draco fired off more and more desperate spell-fire, Harry did eventually resort to defending himself, but it was easy to see, even in the heat of the moment, that in comparison to the Slytherin, he was firing off milder, playground-type jinxes, and missing so conspicuously that there was no way a wizard of his talent would have fought so badly unless he were trying.  And Draco was angry, oh, so <em>furious, </em>that even as he fought more desperately, with darker and darker spells, Harry merely dodged them easily and continued trying to placate him like he was a feral little puppy.  He was so angry that he did something he thought for sure he’d never, <em>never </em>do, especially not to Harry Potter, who had drawn him in, secretly prostrate on his knees, for just the slightest flicker of appreciation and acknowledgement. </p><p>            <em>“Crucio!” </em>he yelled, and even as the curse left his wand he was surprised, and Harry stopped in the middle of the floor, eyes wide, as if he couldn’t quite believe Draco would do such a thing, even though every minute of the role Draco had played for the past six years suggested that the Malfoy Harry knew most certainly would. </p><p>            Even more surprising, for Draco at least, was when Potter seized up as the curse took effect.  Draco knew he didn’t have enough hatred in his heart to pull off that spell, much less against Potter- Merlin help him, <em>least of all against Potter.  </em>Alarmed, he moved to drop the spell, but it didn’t let up, and Draco tried again and again, frantically.  By some miracle, Harry hadn’t started screaming yet (it had been what, a minute by now?  Even Sev couldn’t stay quiet for more than thirty seconds of such extreme pain).  But the Gryffindor’s body was writhing on the floor, and he’d bitten straight through his lip in his efforts not to cry out, so that blood streamed down his chin and onto his chest. </p><p>            Draco dropped his wand and ran, still the spell hadn’t let up.  He shook the other boy, and he was dimly aware that he was screaming, begging for the spell to end, for Harry’s face to stop twisting in vivid agony. </p><p>            “Harry, no!  Dammit, just, just be okay, alright!  You can make me your pity project or try to help me or anything you want, just… just don’t do this! What have I done?  Just, just take it off him, alright? Do it to me, or turn me into the ministry or whatever, but <em>dear Merlin just make it stop!</em>”  Draco had gone from begging Harry to pleading for the world in general to just <em>fix this, fix whatever he’d done, </em>and it had been approaching two minutes of the cruciatus curse and Harry had started whimpering quietly when Draco remembered that Severus had given him an emergency Portkey to his office, and he pulled it out, one arm around a shaking, seizing Harry, as he tapped it with his wand and they disappeared. </p><p>            Then they were in Uncle Sev’s private quarters and the older man was taking in the scene, normally emotionless eyes wide, as he pulled Draco away from Harry by the shoulders. </p><p>            “Draco, Draco, what the hell happened?!” And then his godfather’s hands were shaking some sense into him as Draco shakily explained and Harry’s low whimper turned into an agonized whine. </p><p>            Draco hadn’t thought he was speaking very coherently, but Professor Snape must have gathered enough as his eyes widened and he cursed aloud. </p><p>            “Merlin, Draco!  You accidentally cast the curse with your own self-loathing; that’s not how the spell is supposed to be done, so you can’t just <em>cancel </em>it on a whim.” The potion master’s fathomless black eyes looked at him with pity as he realized just <em>what </em>his godson had gotten himself into, and with whom.  “You’re going to have to open your heart to him if you want this to end, you’re going to have to bare your soul and your feelings and satisfy the spell as to why your self-hatred is so intense.  I wish I could make things easier, but Potter’s been under the spell for nearly five minutes now and we don’t have much time before it does permanent damage; his nerves may have suffered something irreversible already.”  </p><p>            The last thing Draco wanted to do was bare his soul and his feelings to Potter, to Harry, but he was suffering because of him and that was even worse.  So, without even realizing just what he was doing, he’d taken Harry’s hand and started to speak. </p><p>            “Potter… Harry, this wasn’t… I didn’t mean for this to happen.  I was angry at myself for being weak and not fighting, not fighting like you would have, if they were making you do the things they’re trying to make me do, and angry at the world for what’s been happening lately, but I wasn’t angry at you.  I don’t think I <em>could </em>be angry at you, dammit, and I didn’t know that the way I hate myself for going along with the things I’m being forced into could hurt you; I was lashing out and it landed on you because you were right there…” he swallowed, the spell hadn’t ended yet and he knew he needed to say more, say the one thing he’d been hoping to take with him to the grave.  “And because… because, you, Harry, well, you’re unfortunate enough to have the biggest wreck of a sniveling, terrified coward desperately in love with you, and you don’t deserve that, and I’m sorry that it’s ended up like this, with you suffering because I’m angry and desperate and pining for someone I could never have, could never <em>deserve.</em>”  There were tears streaming down his face now, more tears than were on even Harry’s face as he took a deep, gasping breath of air and gave a great, gasping shudder as the spell finally gave way. </p><p>            Draco realized, embarrassed, that he was still holding Harry’s hand, and before he could pull it away the other boy leaned over and retched all over the stone floor for a full minute before there was nothing else in his scrawny body and he was just dry heaving.  Severus, feeling sorry for him, which he <em>never </em>thought would happen with a Potter- but, well, here they were- muttered a spell that would stop his gag reflex, and Harry took a deep, shaky breath and fell back, spent, against Draco’s lap, seeming not to care that he was leaning for support on the person who’d put him in this state in the first place. </p><p>            Harry was still gasping and showing no signs of moving off of Draco when Snape moved cautiously towards him a few moments later. </p><p>            “Alright Potter, you were under that spell for a long time, and while it’s an excellent sign that you seem lucid and sane after nearly <em>seven </em>minutes of the torture curse, I’m going to need to assess the physical damages.  I’m going to gently remove your robes now.” </p><p>            Green eyes widened in a panic as Harry tried to protest, to move away, but after seven minutes of having his body thrown around like a ragdoll, he could neither move of his own accord nor manage any more than a weak slur of “nnn.. pr…” as Severus, almost unbelievably gently for the dour man, batted aside his protesting hands and gently pulled the robes away from the boy’s tan back and chest. </p><p>            Draco and Severus gasped in unison, and Harry would have looked away embarrassedly if his head had been capable of doing more than just lolling weakly to the side.  His chest and back were covered in deep, knotted scars that appeared to come from a belt buckle and Merlin-knows-what-else and it was obvious immediately to the other wizards that they could have only been inflicted by Harry’s muggle relatives; wizards didn’t do that to their children, even the worst sort used spells that didn’t leave so much as a blemish, both for the sake of their reputation and out of a belief that to physically lay hand (or something else) on another wizard was to stoop to a boorishly low level when a wand could be used instead. </p><p>            Severus very gently laid a hand on Harry’s shaking shoulder.  “It seems I had the wrong idea of your relatives, if I am to guess, eh Potter?” </p><p>            Harry, shivering, sank even further into Draco’s lap and the softness of the silk robes covering it and looked at Snape for a long moment before nodding his head in a nearly imperceptible <em>yes.  </em>The potions professor let out a deep sigh and pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Well, it seems to me we three have a lot to talk about, but first we must get you well.  I am going to have to floo Pomphrey to come here, it is unsafe to move you at the moment.” </p><p>            Harry shook his head desperately before gripping it as the action caused him intense pain.  “Draco needs to leave,” he rasped.  “It… he didn’t mean to do this; it wasn’t his fault.” </p><p>            “You cannot possibly mean that!” Severus snapped.  “Draco is my godson and even I am forced to admit that however unintended, his actions were reprehensible.” </p><p>            Harry slowly and deliberately shook his head again.  “Then we’ll figure it out between the three of us; no need to get Pomphrey involved.  Draco has enough on his plate as it is.”  The significant look in Harry’s emerald eyes as he carefully inclined his head upwards towards Draco’s clearly demonstrated that despite the haze of agony he’d been in, he had heard and remembered every word of his confession. </p><p>            Draco was touched and keenly guilty over the fact that he had somehow won over the affection of someone who was so much nobler than he was, affection that he wasn’t worthy of.  Nevertheless, despite knowing he really had no right to, he gently pulled Harry a little farther up against his chest. </p><p>            “No.” He stated firmly, and in some back corner of his mind he was dimly aware that for better or for worse, this pivotal moment was him taking his life into his own hands for the first time.  “I’m taking responsibility for myself.  I’m staying here, with you, come what may.” </p>
