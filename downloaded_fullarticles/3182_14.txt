    <p>When everything ended, Luna had known she wasn't going back to her world. </p>
<p>The gods had their reasons of course, and as she sat beside Noctis and his throne, clad in her wedding dress, she knew that she wouldn't be there long. His story was ending with peaceful sleep, but her's... </p>
<p>The world was Dark, then it was light. </p>
<p>Someone was screaming. </p>
<p>It took almost an eternity to realise it was herself. </p>
<p>Hands as large as her body passed her along a line and into the arms of a woman who looked down at her with all the love and wonder in the world. </p>
<p>Lunafreya had been reborn. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>-------------------------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her start to life was a charmed one. She was born into a wealthy family, her parents loved her and she wanted for nothing. It felt like living in the palace in Tenebrae all over again, except with much less responsibility and a greater emphisis on life. The world outside her new castle was full of people, the population outstripping even the Empire's in it's day. In her old world the population had been on a decline, even with people flocking to the cities they'd been dwindling in response to the secret crisis brewing in the background, but here, life flourished. She gloried in the feeling of not being alone. </p>
<p>It wasn't until she began to attend school that she learned that not all was right in her second world. </p>
<p>Children of other wealthy  families all responded differently. She knew her family had been well off, but the way some either followed, reviled or feared her was unnerving and strange. She'd gone along with it for a while, keeping her silence, being polite, using every scrap of diplomatic experience she had to keep the various warring factions of the school yard from erupting into chaos, before someone finally gave her a hint. A revelation of the true nature of the family she'd been reborn into. </p>
<p>She was the Heir of a Mafia Family.</p>
<p>In the city of New York her family was the second most powerful crime syndicate around. And didn't that leave a bitter taste in her mouth. </p>
<p>Still, she loved her mother and father, she was loved by the people around her and she was in good standing if not outright liked by the children she interacted with in school. So she kept her silence.  She wasn't idle though. Driven by her particular form of foresight she made friends and contacts, if it ever went the way she knew it would she'd need to know things. Cultivating connections with people who would likely stay in the mafia for life would only work to her benefit. </p>
<p>It was a sad realisation that she'd even need them when her father seemed to take a maddening turn toward insanity. She watched as he became more and more ambitious and eventually started talking about taking over the city and ruling it from the shadows. His actions became more and more erratic and Luna tried to hold as much of her life together as she could.</p>
<p>But then one day her father went a step too far. </p>
<p>He murdered her mother. </p>
<p>Luna left that day. He'd come to her after, ranting about how she'd been groomed as his heir, now she would be a princess in his kingdom and nothing was left to stop him from taking over everything...</p>
<p>That had been enough. </p>
<p>Luna had disowned herself. In an obvious dramatic fashion she'd used the resources at her disposal and fled. It was noticed too. Everyone who had been watching her father saw when she disavowed anything to do with him and his family and walked out the door. She'd spent a lot of time, just hiding from the fallout before she finally re emerged a number of states away and had to reassess her life. </p>
<p>She was Eighteen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-------------------------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She hadn't brought much with her. Only a suitcase and enough money to get herself set up but that was it. Finding an apartment, she started working to put herself through University. She began a nursing degree and spent her time studying. About a year in she found a puppy that reminded her so much of Pryna that she took it home and hadn't felt lonely since. Finishing her schooling she found work at a hospital and began to sink into the life of a nurse living from shift to shift, helping people. It was familiar in a way she hadn't realized she'd missed, and with the lack of darkness in this world, she never had to see any of her patients become monsters. She made friends and began to open up once more. </p>
<p>About a year into university she'd gotten notice that her father had finally bitten off more than he could chew. He'd been outed to the police by "concerned parties" and the organized crime families had repelled his attempts to take over, allowing the police to finish him off.  She'd been investigated briefly during the process, but her clear distance had ruled her out of any wrong doing and her age at the time of his rise had given her the leniency to slip by the consequences brought to bear on the rest of the Family.<br/>
She'd given her statements, made anonymous testimonies and put her childhood behind her.<br/>
But it seemed the Mafia wasn't done with her.<br/>
They came, quietly. One or two at a time. Gunshot wounds, stab wounds, Burns, diseases and trauma from the strangest and most unexplained circumstances.</p>
<p>They all asked to see Her. They all asked after the one nurse that had the power of a Sun. </p>
<p>Even if she'd been mostly oblivious to the nature of her family as a child, the flames had always been with her. From an early age she'd hid them from her parents. Flickering golden flames that she'd first mistaken as a new manifestation of her star's blessing before she learned they were a part of this new world she was in. The Seven Flames of the Sky while common in the Mafia, were uncommon everywhere else, and as far as the Mafia was concerned, she was distinctly powerful. </p>
<p>Her past as Oracle gave it shape, but the Flames were all her own. </p>
<p>But it did mean she had those affiliated with the mafia coming to find her at all hours for healing when they were in the area.  She'd tell them off, heal them to get them out of her hair, but they kept coming back. It was maddening. People noticed that she had visitors. They whispered as rumors started and eventually she'd had enough. She quit her job, sold her apartment, collected her dog and prepared to move to the other side of the country when she heard the rumors.</p>
<p>The underworld was abuzz with stories of a Rouge Sky traveling across the country with his guardians. Seen in a black car that no one could follow for long, having adventures that were epic in nature. </p>
<p>It felt so achingly familiar.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she knew what she wanted to do. </p>
<p>Last time she'd missed the fun and chaos of Noctis' road trip to Altissia and beyond. Her own journey had been hard and full of politics and trials. They'd forgotten just how little time it had been while they wondered and Noctis had admitted he'd wanted it to go on forever. </p>
<p>She wanted that.<br/>
She wanted to do the same.<br/>
Adventure across the world with people who could be her family and the all encompassing joy of flying in the same sky. </p>
<p>Whistling to Pryna she locked up the apartment and went to hand in the keys. </p>
<p>She'd have to make plans. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>-------------------------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She smoothed down the fabric of her blazer restlessly. </p>
<p>It had been months since she'd first made her decision to pursue the rouge sky, but unlike the others still watching she was well ahead of them. Even if her gods weren't here she still had a little foresight left . She'd anticipated their final destination and gone to wait. Liquidating her funds, finding a new place to stay for a few weeks and getting herself a job to pass the time. </p>
<p>The moment they'd come into range she'd felt them. The Sky's energy spread out ahead of them searching and even as the energy brushed against her own she had to resist the urge to go running to them. They danced around the edge of her perception for most of the day till finally, the Sky walked in and she may well have been bouncing in place. </p>
<p>He was adorable. </p>
<p>Wide green eyes, dark hair not unlike Noctis' usual bed head, a slender but clearly male frame and clothes, that while they were new, looked like they'd been picked to hide his form. (she'd have to change that eventually) </p>
<p>He was clearly dazed by her enthusiasm. The moment their hands touched her sun flooded the surroundings and she gloried in it when the bond was accepted  without words. The other guardians were clearly more aware of her than the sky was. They eyed her with critical gazes, accepting as she dressed them up, the Storm that could have been the Skies sister was the most wary of all of them, she resisted being crammed into any kind of dress until the sky turned doe eyes on her and she relented to a slinky black number. Their judgement was silent and unnoticed by the sky, but by the time they were all ready to leave they'd calmed down from the surprise. </p>
<p>She swept them along, dragging them toward a restaurant she'd booked for the evening. She had the money after all. All the while she chattered, pleased to have someone else to talk to. The rain chipped in occasionally, the mist and his partner were indulgent of her behavior while the Lightning was bemused. The cloud was tugging at his collar like it was the devil trying to choke him and the Storm was a silent but insistent guardian that walked two steps behind. Luna found herself telling the sky... Harry, about the mafia, how she'd left it such a long time ago, but how it had followed her everywhere... until today. </p>
<p>When he shook himself out of his daze, once they'd been seated in the restaurant, Luna to his right, He smiled. </p>
<p>He smiled and Luna, along with everyone else in the room, felt Happy. </p>
<p>Happy they all finally had a place to belong.</p>
<p>... And then A baby wearing a fedora and a bright Yellow pacifier around its neck walked in an Luna had to try very hard not to let anything show on her face. </p>
<p>She'd known they'd show up sooner or later, she didn't need foresight to know that the Vongola's pet hit-man wouldn't be far behind.</p>
