<p>
  <em>2<sup>nd</sup> May, 1998</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gravel and dust, pieces of broken furniture and parts of the stone walls and ceiling were crunching under his feet as he walked towards his unknown destination. Ron and Hermione were doing it again; he could practically hear them exchange those glances behind his back.</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly, Hermione bumping into him and almost slipping on a stray piece of wood; Ron caught her by the arm and held her in place. An uncomfortable look passed between them and Ron hastily removed his hand. Harry pretended he hadn’t noticed the small exchange and strained his ears for the voice which had originally made him stop.</p>
<p>A very quiet and distant moan sounded from somewhere ahead of them. The corridor they were standing in was clear but the noise seemed to have come from a classroom up ahead.</p>
<p>They exchanged a glance and moved towards the room quietly, wands held tightly and at the ready. The classroom was in a state of utter destruction – a part of the wall was blown up and most of the ceiling was in pieces on what remained of the floor.</p>
<p>It had to be the west side of the castle, for no sunlight streamed through the large gap, even though the Black Lake was visible from an angle. Another moan erupted from somewhere under the rubble, louder this time; the person seemed to have sensed their presence. Harry looked at the two of them in indecision – what if the person underneath turned out to be a death eater? He couldn’t think of anything he would do, or not do, if it was one of them. Hermione took a deep breath and decided it for them, by walking forward at the edge of the rubble and starting to lift the larger pieces away.</p>
<p>The bright, fierce light feeling of victory was slowly fading away, giving in to something much darker than Harry could have imagined feeling. Every time he looked at Ron and Hermione though, the light hope and happiness flickered in his chest again.</p>
<p>It was easier to follow Hermione and not think, simply work. Underneath the largest broken piece of wood, a foot came into view. Within the next few minutes, they had the now unconscious form of Theodore Nott unearthed. Harry recognized the reedy boy from the few times he had seen him at the Slytherin table, but his mind still felt blank. He felt no emotion for the boy. He didn’t care it was a Slytherin. To him, it was someone who’d been hurt because of the War. Another side-effect of the Battle.</p>
<p>Ron looked uncertainly towards him but Harry had already made up his mind. He bent down to check Nott’s pulse once, which was very weak, and then with Hermione’s help, hoisted him in the air.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nott was deposited in the Hospital Wing, which was set up in the room off the entrance hall for the time being. Ron had stoically followed them, and Harry could sense that he did not approve. Harry was fussed over again by everyone, some congratulated him, clapped him on the back, while some kept their distance. Madam Pomfrey suddenly swooped in on the three of them as they were standing by Nott’s bed, Ron glaring at his still form.</p>
<p>The matron inspected Nott’s injuries for a few minutes, while the three of them watched her from a corner. Ron and Hermione tried their level best to just somehow hide him from view so people would stop coming over to talk to him, but it did not appear to be working much. Thankfully, the nurse had looked over Nott properly and had appointed Hannah Abott in charge of the boy within the next few minutes.</p>
<p>She immediately stalked to them and caught hold of Ron and Hermione and ushered the three of them upstairs to her office. The part of the Wing opposite to the office of the matron had been demolished too, but they didn’t linger there much. “Now, tell me all about these injuries quickly, so that I can assign you potions and then get back to the hall. Come on.” She bid them, hurriedly opening cupboards and taking out numerous bottles and vials. Harry felt Hermione and Ron look at him, unmoving, but he couldn’t bring himself to look at them directly. Instead, he stared at the Matron’s cluttered desktop.</p>
<p>The sight provoked a sharp memory of Snape’s bleeding and still body on the floor of the Shrieking Shack. Harry gave a slight shudder; then pretended to ignore Ron and Hermione’s questioning stares, instead focusing on slowly peeling off his clothes. He had only told them in short about Snape’s memories and he did not think he could recount the details for anyone else so soon, even though he knew he would have to tell McGonagall sooner rather than later. But more importantly, he had to make a trip to the shrieking shack and he had to do it alone.</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione had followed his lead and shed almost all their clothing and exposed their burns, cuts and bruises. Madam Pomfrey stopped her movements suddenly, and gave a horrified gasp on seeing them. “What did you do? Walk through a <em>fire</em>?” she whispered in shock, and he distinctly felt Hermione look towards him. He remained silent. They followed his lead again.</p>
<p>After a few seconds of staring, Pomfrey snapped out of it, and started muttering furiously, and Harry spotted her wiping a few tears while getting out more vials.</p>
<p>She poked and prodded them for about an hour, making a list of potions and liquids they needed, then found all she could provide them. Hermione quietly took initiative for helping her list the supplies she had, and promised that she would look for the rest and meet her later.</p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey left after assigning them five bottles each to drink now and giving some more instructions to Hermione. Harry gulped all five quickly, without taking many breaths in between, and felt Ron and Hermione exchange a panicked glance. Great, now he could even <em>sense</em> their expressions. But he didn’t care; he liked the way the potions burned down his throat, almost like firewhiskey, but for the bitter taste. It made him feel <em>something</em>, instead of empty and hollow.</p>
<p>“So, Grimmauld Place?” Ron said tentatively, and Harry shook his head silently, and replied without looking up. “I need to bury Snape.”</p>
<p>He knew they were doing it again but it did not bother him as much as it should have. He got up and they followed him again – he had a sudden urge to laugh. After seven years of following him around, it felt like Ron and Hermione were at a loss for what to do now that they didn’t need to do it anymore.</p>
<p>“Do you need help?” Hermione said as they descended the great staircase towards the entrance hall, and Harry smiled despite himself. “No. You’ve both been incredible, but I think I can take it from here.”</p>
<p>He looked back at the two with a smile as they reached the ground amongst a bustle of activity. Hermione made a brave attempt at a smile but it didn’t work, so she decided to barrel into him with a tight hug. He returned it, and shared an eyeroll with Ron behind her back before Hermione decided to untangle herself.</p>
<p>“We’re going to talk to McGonagall about the whole thing – I think we need to tell one person about the everything, don’t you?” She said, looking at Ron as he joined them, thumping Harry on the back.</p>
<p>“Yeah, and we’ll need you with us for it, because there’s some stuff we still don’t fully understand.”</p>
<p>“Just find us on the map – we’ll be in Hogwarts most probably –“</p>
<p>“Oh, but this could take time, y’know –“</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, just find McGonagall when you’re ready and she’ll find us.”</p>
<p>“Yeah and don’t forget we need to get our story straight for Mum and Dad and Bill and Ginny and the whole lot.” Ron said, looking disgruntled towards the Great Hall. Harry felt a stab of apprehension – he had forgotten he would have to explain all the crazy shit they had done to the rest of the adults too, who he was sure would not be as understanding or forgiving as McGonagall.   </p>
<p>“Yeah, I thought we’d escape it,” Ron explained when he noticed Harry’s expression, “But Bill was already up my arse about it before you came to get me and Hermione earlier.”</p>
<p>“And Ginny was asking me questions too.” Hermione nodded along, and Harry sighed resignedly. “Fine, we’ll figure it out later. Don’t say anything yet, we’ll tell them everything together and somewhere safe like The Burrow – not here.”</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione nodded their assent and Harry slowly and carefully pushed through the crowd to the oak front doors, finally stepping into the chilly air of the morning.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Professor McGonagall stared at them for two long minutes with an incredulous expression on her face, looking like she hoped someone would laugh and say they were kidding.</p>
<p>It was afternoon and they had just relayed the entirety of the events starting properly from Voldemort’s birth and ending with the events of that morning. Harry felt like he had just relived his whole life within the span of the last hour they had spent talking to McGonagall.</p>
<p>He had found Ron and Hermione easily enough after returning from the Shrieking Shack since he had been unable to decide what to do with Snape’s body. He knew that the only place the man should be laid to rest was next to his mother, Lily, but how did you do that? It had felt ironic at that time, when he stared into the lifeless eyes of his Potions Master, that despite facing the death of so many loved ones at such a young age, Severus Snape was the first man whose funeral he had to directly arrange.</p>
<p>It was the responsibility of ‘next of kin’ and he had never been that for anyone except now, perhaps, for the dark haired man. He had been unable to do much else except sit by the battered body and think about what had unfolded and the unfairness of it all. He had proceeded to let out his anger, frustration, tears and howls in all the violent ways he could for a good two or three hours, occasionally alternating with sitting silently and stewing, before finally walking back to the castle with Snape’s body hovering behind him and depositing it in line with the rest of the dead in the Great Hall.</p>
<p>McGonagall had been shocked to say the least, on learning about the precarious position Snape had spent his entire life in. “And to think I hated him all that time. If I was doing that, I’d be that bloody pissed off at every single thing too!”</p>
<p>It had bothered Harry some to hear McGonagall, because as much as a guilty pit the size of Hogwarts blew up in his stomach at the thought of what Snape had done for him, he also had trouble getting the images of Snape bullying him, Neville and Hermione out of his head.</p>
<p>Finally though, Professor McGongall took off her glasses and heaved a deep sigh, before walking around her office twice and standing behind her desk again, “I take that we four are the only people with the complete knowledge of what has happened?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Professor.” They replied in unison, and McGonagall nodded once and fell back into her chair, picking up her spectacles and cleaning them.</p>
<p>“So what do you propose shall be told to the general population? Surely, this story cannot be allowed to be presented in the open.” She said, placing the glasses on her nose and looking down at the three of them.</p>
<p>“Uh, yes Professor. We were hoping that you would help us out with that. What do you think we should do?” Harry said, and McGonagall’s eyebrows rose dangerously before she considered him for a moment and slowly nodded, speaking quietly to herself, “Yes, I suppose, now that Albus-“</p>
<p>She stopped and cleared her throat, resetting her glasses again, “Well, I think that we shall have to come up with an alternate half-truthful version of the story, for no doubt, the <em>Daily Prophet</em> shall have to print <em>something</em>.”</p>
<p>“I have thought of something, Professor, but we’ll need to discuss it first.” Hermione said, and both Harry and Ron turned to her, confused.</p>
<p>“Yes yes, I thought of something, but I thought I’d tell you together.” She shrugged, folding her arms. Harry saw Ron open his mouth to say something, when there was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>Kingsley entered, looking as worn as ever but stopped suddenly on noticing them. “Oh, Harry. I’ll just wait outside, Minerva.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s quite alright, Kingsley, I will be with you in just a minute. Why don’t you lead everyone to the Defense Classroom- it is the largest.” McGonagall said, and Kingsley left silently with a nod.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of work to do and only a few people trustworthy enough to do it – so we’re having an emergency meeting and Kingsley will be able to immediately sort out some important things like the funerals.” McGongall looked at Harry as she said it but he diligently avoided her eyes, until she started speaking again.</p>
<p>“As for <em>The Prophet</em>, I think it is best to give the people some time to deal with their losses and recover a little bit before <em>The Prophet</em> prints your version of the careful truth. A week should be enough to come up with that and refine it, I think – I shall talk to Mr. Jordan about contacting Barnabas Cuffe about this and they can find an interviewer you shall feel comfortable talking to.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that sounds perfect, Professor.” Hermione replied enthusiastically and Harry and Ron nodded along. “Now, can we go back to Grimmauld?” Ron turned to him, and Harry rolled his eyes before McGonagall replied for him.</p>
<p>“Ah, I think that is a good idea. Although, I would suggest you take someone with you in case somebody is waiting to apprehend you – Mr. Longbottom and Miss Lovegood, would be happy to help, I’d think.”</p>
<p>She was almost at the door before she turned back to the three of them, “And I would suggest staying and laying low there for a while – particularly you, Harry.”</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The place was still being guarded by two cloaked Death Eaters, but they were quickly taken down. Neville and Luna volunteered to deposit the unconscious men at Hogwarts itself.</p>
<p>They had quietly entered the place, him hoping the neighbors hadn’t seen the little show, to find it the same as it had been when they had left. A few things in the drawing room had been upturned and the kitchen was also messed through, but nothing was missing or much out of place.</p>
<p>“One hour to wash up. Then food.” Hermione had said quietly, and then retired to her and Ginny’s room.</p>
<p>That had been two hours ago.</p>
<p>He had been in the bathroom, hands against tiles, staring at the draining water. At first it was murky red, then it had faded it to faint brown and now it was clear. He was feeling a little better after washing himself properly, feeling like he had washed away years of sweat, grime and memories in the process. He felt cleaner, and his head was a little clearer, even though his neck was now aching because of standing in the same position for the last half hour.</p>
<p>He would have to admit to himself that bathrooms had often held life-changing experiences for him. He had entered today feeling empty - then he had mechanically washed himself after an hour of crying his eyes dry in the shower. While washing himself, his mind had slowly cleared and he was letting the Hermione section of his brain take over. He had compartmentalized- there were things he had to do, things he had not dared to think about all his life – for whenever he had thought about his future, he had seen nothing but a blank dark stretch ending with Voldemort. And now that he was gone, it was time to step into actual reality - time to leave this chapter of his life behind.</p>
<p>He felt guilty when he thought about it. It was guilt that threatened to rip him apart from the inside out if he let it, but he couldn’t let that happen. A faint burning hope ignited in his chest again as he made his decision – they needed him now, more than anything. He would throw himself in the clean-up effort, personally visit people, donate, work, talk, give speeches,<em> do things</em> and keep himself busy.</p>
<p>No matter what McGongall said - she didn’t understand. He couldn’t have a breakdown, or shut down. No. He would work. And do something worthwhile with his life that so many people had died to protect. That he himself had died for.</p>
<p>“Harry?”</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door as Hermione’s voice trembled slightly as she called him, knocking again when he didn’t answer, hurriedly drying himself and pulling on clothes. He opened the door after a few silent seconds, to find Hermione’s hand raised in the air again.</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry. Harry, we need to talk.” She said, and her voice had the urgency he hadn’t expected – his thoughts immediately turned to horrible things like something happening to Ron, or Ginny, or Voldemort being back.</p>
<p>“Harry, there are some things we need to sort out between ourselves without telling the others.” She began, and the panic subsided in Harry’s chest – this he could handle, “I think you need to keep the Hocruxes safe, so that no one accidentally finds them; there are going to be speculations and rumors about what happened today and the Prophet’s going to jabber on with the nastiest versions for at least a week, not to mention the rest of the Wizarding World.” She continued as she took a seat on Ron’s bed, pulling out the beaded bag from her sock.</p>
<p>“Well, they’re destroyed, aren’t they? They can’t do any harm now.” He said, but Hermione shook her head, closing her eyes.</p>
<p>“No no, I mean yes, they’re destroyed but they were filled with dark magic so they’re going to leave traces. If someone discovers them, well…”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t need Hermione to explain to him what would happen. Any normal witch or wizard might not understand but they could still be dangerous in the hands of the wrong person.</p>
<p>“The ring is in the Forest, and it needs to remain there. I have the locket right here-“ Harry fumbled behind him for Hagrid’s moleskin pouch, pulling out the ornate locket, and feeling it’s weight in his hand. Even though no metal heart beat beneath it, he still felt an inexplicable urge to hurl the thing away from him, but dropped it back inside.</p>
<p>“The cup is with Ron, and the diadem?” Hermione asked, eyeing the chain in his hand, frowning.</p>
<p>“I don’t know… can’t remember, I think it’s still on the seventh floor in the rubble somewhere. Death Eaters had just broken in when it shattered in my hands – I don’t remember picking it up.” He said, wracking his brains to remember the moment right before Fred had – when Fred had…</p>
<p>“Okay, and the diary?” Hermione interrupted, voice trembling slightly, he suspected she too must have remembered.</p>
<p>“I gave it to Lucius Malfoy right after we got back from the Chamber. He’d come to visit Dumbledore with Dobby.” He said, throat constricting at the mention of the excited house-elf, and his eyes burning slightly.</p>
<p>“Where’s Kreacher?” he asked Hermione, who hadn’t spoken but seemed to be taking deep breaths to calm herself. She looked like she was about to cry too.</p>
<p>“He’s…” She began, then cleared her throat, blinking rapidly, “He’s prepared some food – Ron, Neville and Luna just finished eating.”</p>
<p>“And you?” Harry asked, noticing she’d omitted herself, and as he watched, she began to shake slightly.</p>
<p>“I’ve had to take care of something else.” She said quietly, voice trembling, looking at him with a scared look. Harry found himself panicking again – something else had happened, hadn’t it? Someone else was…</p>
<p>He stared at Hermione in silence as her breathing quickened again and her eyes filled with tears. Neither spoke a word for a minute, but Harry was waiting for the news – he didn’t think he could handle anyone else –</p>
<p>“It’s the dagger. Her dagger. I don’t know what to do with it.” Hermione blurted out, looking like she’d done so with great difficulty, breaking into sobs as soon as she finished. Harry blinked at her, surprised, but moved to her side quickly as she collapsed into him, mumbling noisily.</p>
<p>“She killed Dobby with it – I – I don’t want to keep it but I can’t get r-rid of it either.” She sobbed hysterically into his shoulder for a minute, while Harry tried to rub her back soothingly. He was still bewildered about what was happening, but he couldn’t make sense of what Hermione was saying right then.</p>
<p>“What are you saying, Hermione? You can’t get rid of it, why?” He asked, and she sat up again, wiping at her eyes frantically, trying to stifle her sobs.</p>
<p>“I hate it, it’s a vile object. But… I don’t know how to explain it, Harry. I feel safe when it’s with me. When I know where it is all the time.” She said in scared whisper, and understanding struck – Hermione didn’t want to get rid of it, but it’s presence scared her.</p>
<p>“So that’s why you can’t rid of it?” he asked, and she nodded silently, her sobs finally subsiding.</p>
<p>“I hate it though.” She said again angrily, pulling the blade out from her beaded bag and placing it between them on the bed. They stared at for a minute in silence and Harry noted with a stab of revulsion that Dobby’s blood was still on it.</p>
<p>“What do I do, Harry? What should I do?” She said, voice desperate, and Harry shook himself out of his thoughts. It was the first time, if he remembered correctly, that Hermione had asked him for help; she had been the answer to most of their questions from as long as he could remember. It disconcerted him to see her so out of sorts, especially asking him for help.</p>
<p>“What if I keep it?” He said after a while, and Hermione looked at him surprised. He saw her consider the idea and nod slowly, “That’s a good idea. I’ll know it’s in safe hands and can’t cause anymore trouble. And I won’t have to keep it with me either.” She thought out loud, nodding slowly.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes Harry. That sounds good.” She said finally and Harry smiled at her reassuringly, patting her hand. She seemed much more collected as she wrapped the silver blade in a cloth and handed it to him.</p>
<p>“So what about the hocruxes? We don’t know where the Malfoys are, do we?” She said, wringing her hands thoughtfully, and Harry sighed deeply, feeling the stabs of hunger in his belly sharpen.</p>
<p>“Listen Hermione, is this so important to do right now-?” He began, but Hermione cut him off, looking panicked.</p>
<p>“Of course Harry! We have to make sure that we collect them, I can’t sit idle after all this – after everything that’s happened. I can’t – I need a project or I won’t –” She began, before her voice constricted, and she looked up at him with tear-filled eyes. He understood the problem – she needed to keep herself occupied, typical Hermione.</p>
<p>“I don’t see how I have to participate too. How about this – I take care of the dagger and you collect the Hocruxes. I won’t feel comfortable having them near me for the same reasons you feel that with the dagger. So you can hide them.” He said, and Hermione brightened.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s a really good idea Harry! It’s fair, and – oh, you really need to eat, don’t you? I have to warn you though, Madam Pomfrey is going to be here soon.”</p>
<p>“What? Why?” He said, turning around to face her – he had just been about to go down to the kitchen. Hermione had a guilty expression on her face as she answered him – “I sort of let slip that you’d actually died when I went to get some potions. So she said that you’re to eat and she’ll visit you here to give a thorough check-up.”</p>
<p>“Why would you that, Hermione? Why, why, why?” He whined childishly, feeling annoyed at his brilliant bushy haired friend. All he needed was a good rest – he would be right as rain in no time.</p>
<p>“Would you rather be in St. Mungo’s? They’ll cut you open to get an answer to how you survived the killing curse – how many times is it now?” She said, walking towards him to the door, giving him an exasperated look.</p>
<p>“Thrice now? I think…” He said glumly, conceding her point as they walked down the stairs together, glaring at her half-singed hair in front of him. Sometimes, he hated when she was right.</p>
<p>"Master has finally returned. Master is alive… Kreacher hoped… of course, his old masters told Kreacher his master was dead, but Kreacher knew… he went to Hogwarts… Kreacher is sorry about Dobby… and Kreacher thinks master should have some onion soup and bread, master looks very thin."</p>
<p>Kreacher’s bullfrog voice greeted Harry as he stepped into the glinting kitchen. Harry smiled widely when Kreacher looked up at him and the elf immediately turned to Hermione with a slightly filthy look, "And Master's friends… should have some too… Of course, Kreacher merely suggests… Kreacher will follow orders…"</p>
<p>"Nice house, Harry." Neville remarked with a grin as Kreacher moved away mumbling lowly. Hermione and Harry merely rolled their eyes before taking a seat at the kitchen table. Half of Neville's face was covered in thick yellow paste – Harry had a nasty suspicion some poisonous plants were involved. On his other side, Luna merely looked like she had run through some rough bushes; her hair was tainted with what Harry was sure was blood and dirt, but her face held no sign of injury.</p>
<p>As he and Hermione settled onto the table and dug into the soup Kreacher had produced for them, Harry tried to avoid looking at Ron directly, because he wasn’t sure what he would find there, and if he could deal with it right then. Thankfully, Neville had somehow obtained the latest edition of <em>The Prophet</em> and just like McGongall had predicted, it was full of Harry Potter.</p>
<p>“They’ve raved on about you and your adventures for like six pages. There’s photographs and everything – it’s almost like they’re telling your whole life story backwards.”</p>
<p>“Really? I didn’t think they’d go that all out.” Hermione said, pulling the folded paper towards herself and disappearing behind it just as Kreacher brought out some dessert.</p>
<p>“Oh they have gone all out. We’re all in there – you, me, Neville, Luna, Sirius, Remus, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Snape. They’ve gathered all the scandals they’ve ever printed and just rewritten them in your favor – Dumbledore’s death and your allegations about Snape and how they were proven right, Sirius’ innocence and how you were right about it all that time, Cedric’s death and the Triwizard fiasco, Lupin’s resignation and this time, they somehow managed to mention he was the best Defense teacher we had, Hagrid’s innocence, etc.”</p>
<p>“Seriously? And what source are they citing this time?”</p>
<p>“Oh just a ‘reliable source’. Does it even matter now – anybody present at the castle could’ve given the information about today, there were so many people. And I see they’ve conveniently glossed all over the Umbridge crap they pulled in fifth year.” Hermione said angrily, folding the paper noisily and throwing it aside. “It’s a load of codswallop – just like I expected.”</p>
<p>“So when are you guys giving an official interview, Harry? It’s got to be better to tell them something than letting <em>The Prophet</em> go on and print half-true stories about it all, right?”</p>
<p>Harry exchanged a look with Ron on Neville’s question. He wasn’t sure he could tell everything as it had happened to Neville and Luna – their expectations of the whole truth from him were not misplaced, but could they risk it?</p>
<p>“McGongall told us not to tell the full version to anyone – especially the Prophet. I don’t think the public can handle that kind of truth, to be honest, so we’re going to feed some other story to them.” Hermione said nonchalantly, and Neville turned to frown at Harry. Luna, who had not seemed to be bothered by anything until now, set down her spoon to turn to him with wide eyes too.</p>
<p>Harry looked at Ron, whose ears seemed to have turned pink. Hermione, who had been obliviously busy with her soup, looked up and finally noticed. “What?”</p>
<p>“Look, I’m not saying we tell <em>The Prophet</em> everything, but we have to tell Mum and Dad what we did for a year while we were in hiding. They’re not going to stop hounding us about it until we tell them, y’know?” Ron said, trying to remain confident as they all saw Hermione’s blatant disapproval of the idea in her face. Harry nodded his support and jumped in before Hermione could get a word out.</p>
<p>“And it’s not like we tell everyone or we tell everything. Just the important parts, yknow to keep them satisfied.”</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous, Harry! It’s too dangerous! I cannot believe <em>both</em> you and Ron think this could be –”</p>
<p>“Look, Hermione,” Neville interrupted and both Harry and Ron turned to him, surprised, but not more so than Hermione, “We’re also not saying we want to know the whole truth. I trust your and Harry’s opinion – we all remember what happened in fifth year. So if you decide that something’s too dangerous for the world to know, I don’t want to know it.”</p>
<p>He aimed the last part at Harry and he felt a sudden rush of… respect for Neville. It was something that Remus would have said in a situation like this. He stared, a bit shocked, as Neville continued eating his treacle tart, before turning to Hermione, “It’s only going to be people we trust, Hermione. I can give you a list right now if you want and you’ll agree that these are people we would trust with our lives. So why not the truth? Or at least a part of it?”</p>
<p>“Just sleep on it, ’Mione. Mum’s invited you all for dinner so we need to be there and ready to talk about it all – so get your rest. Both of you.” Ron said, getting up from the table and stretching languidly, just as the doorbell rang and Mrs. Black’s screams filled the halls.</p>
<p>“Again, how did you end up with this house, Harry?”</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Potter, I don't give a <em>rotting rat's arse</em> if you saved the wizarding world, you just <em>died</em> twelve hours ago. You're my patient and you're going to stay in that bed <em>until I say so</em>."</p>
<p>A bit of a shocked silence followed her words as the nice, calm, polite Hogwarts Matron Madam Pomfrey stood in the doorway of his bedroom, red in the face, glaring at Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Harry was sitting in his bed disgruntled, looking ready to revolt again, when he saw Hermione glare at him too. That made him clench his jaw and huff quietly at the ceiling.</p>
<p>Neville was standing behind the matron, ready to escort her out, looking like he was fighting a smile, while Ron smirked at Harry's distress by his side. He had a sudden urge to hurl something at the ginger, but resisted, only because he knew Hermione would hex him before whatever he threw at Ron actually hit him.</p>
<p>Hermione shuffled around with his potions as Ron dragged two armchairs and settled them by his bed. Luna was closely inspecting the posters of scantily clad models on the wall of Sirius’ old room when Neville returned.</p>
<p>"Harry, you really need to go to sleep." Hermione said, sitting beside his legs, and he groaned petulantly. He did <em>not</em> want to sleep just yet.</p>
<p>"Now." Hermione continued before he could say anything, and surprisingly, Ron intervened. "Let the man breathe Hermione. We've just defeated bloody Voldemort, I think we all deserve a bit of relaxation – not being poked and prodded and ordered around."</p>
<p>Hermione flushed at his words and crossed her arms, but Harry could see this escalating into something worse. So he quickly spoke as Hermione opened her mouth to counter angrily – "That's right – I mean you're right too, of course, and I know I have to sleep because of this bloody medication and I will but I just wanted to know what you lot are going to do in the meantime."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm going to go home and visit Gran and see if she's alright. Then probably go to McGonagall and see how I can help." Neville said squishing into an armchair beside Luna and Ron leaned in as well.</p>
<p>"I'm going to take everyone home and- and sort out some other things." Ron said, and Harry knew he meant the funeral.</p>
<p>"I'll also join you, Neville. I need to talk to Mr. Shacklebolt about getting Daddy back from Azkaban and then we need to rebuild our home." Luna said in a dreamy voice, completely at ease with the idea of her father being locked up in the horrible place.</p>
<p>"Right. Hermione?" Harry prompted, after everyone had stared at Luna for about half a minute, who as usual seemed oblivious to it.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm- I'm free, I guess." Hermione said uncertainly, then threw a fleeting look at Harry and added, "Though I think I'll go to McGonagall as well."</p>
<p>"Really Hermione?" He looked at her bemusedly, "Do you seriously need me to say it?"</p>
<p>She blushed a delicate shade of pink, "I- I, well, I don't want to impose-"</p>
<p>"Rubbish. You're staying here." He said with a tone of finality in his voice he had often heard Mrs. Weasley use. "Luna, you and Mr. Lovegood are welcome to stay here while the house is getting ready." He continued, and was awarded with a brilliant smile that seemed to brighten the blonde’s hair.</p>
<p>"Ron, Neville, do I even have to say?" He turned to the two boys. They shared a face-splitting grin then, and he felt warmth spread through him. Yes, there had been casualties. Yes, they had lost people, loved ones. But they had survived. It was finally over – the darkness was gone and he suddenly felt lightheaded with belated relief. He could feel himself breathing better again.</p>
<p>They would build their world back together. He would. With his friends. His family.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Harry woke up three hours later, and entered the kitchen yawning, only slightly aware of his surroundings as the half-formed images from his dreams flashed before his eyes. He did not feel rested at all, it felt like he had collapsed on the bed, passed out to a blur of flashing colors as his brain tried to make sense of the events of the past few hours and then woken up abruptly as if to an alarm.</p>
<p>Hermione was already there, making tea and looking more miserable than he had seen her in the afternoon; he could spot dark circles beneath her eyes. He felt guilty at once – sleep, especially sleeping separately, had been a bad idea. He didn't want to think what she might have gone through in her dreams, when she spoke hoarsely, "Sorry, did I wake you?"</p>
<p>His stomach turned with guilt again and he felt a lump form in his throat on seeing her apologetic expression. "Let me do that." He replied, quietly taking the pan from her hand.</p>
<p>He slowly made some tea – while Hermione sat in the chair closest to the fire. He had expected her to pull out a book, or talk, but she had only stared at the fire in deep thought. He was only half-curious about what was going on in her mind; he wasn't sure they could talk about things so soon.</p>
<p>Ron joined them just as he finished drinking, silently entering without any greeting. Hermione straightened up and left her morose staring, focusing instead on him. There was still some time before they had to be at the Burrow for the funeral and dinner and Harry knew why Ron had chosen to visit them first – they had to decide how much to tell everyone.</p>
<p>"Hermione, have you thought about telling them?" Ron asked bluntly, sitting across from him and fixing Hermione with a dead stare. He looked worse for wear and even though Harry and Hermione had not been able to rest, they had at least managed a few hours of sleep – something Ron had obviously not had the time for. The only time Harry had seen him in a worse state was the few days he had been wearing the hocrux at the start of their journey with an arm injury. He had bags under his eyes and his hair looked as disheveled as ever; the only difference he could make out was that he was cleaner now.</p>
<p>"Yeah. You both are right, I suppose. We need to share things with people we trust in order to grieve properly and move past them.”</p>
<p>Harry and Ron exchanged a relieved glance, and Hermione turned to look at them, “I have a condition though – everyone present at the time of this recollection has to make an Unbreakable Vow to not reveal anything we tell them to anyone else. They want the story? They’ll get it, but we <em>cannot</em> be naive about this – we can’t risk anyone spilling the secrets of the darkest wizard of our time and the reason he was called that. Does that seem fair?”</p>
<p>They both nodded and she continued, this time looking at Ron with a little bit of apprehension, “I’m going to say a list of names and I think anyone other than these people cannot know about the details of things. I don’t mean to offend you, Ron but I can’t agree with all of your family knowing. Only Ginny, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Fleur and George. Other than them, Neville and Luna. And that’s it.”</p>
<p>Ron stared at her for a few seconds, his ears turning slightly red, a dangerous sign, before he finally glanced at Harry. He, however, could not think of any particular reasons to counter Hermione so he blinked uselessly from one to the other.</p>
<p>“Well, am I allowed to ask the reason for the exclusion of the rest?" Ron said in a very calm voice, but it had the hint of suppressed skepticism. Hermione did not look surprised at all, and instead replied very matter-of-factly, “Because Charlie is too close to Hagrid and Percy – I just don’t trust.”</p>
<p>Ron stared at Hermione for a resolute moment, and Harry shifted his eyes to the fireplace as soon as Ron turned towards him. A muscle twitched in his jaw as he mastered the urge to argue with Hermione about excluding Hagrid but the smallest, most logical part of him knew that it wasn’t the best idea and that Hermione wouldn’t budge anyway.  He tried his best to avoid Ron’s eyes as he digested the information and finally let out a hollow, “Alright then. Let’s get going.”</p>
