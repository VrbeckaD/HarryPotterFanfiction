    <p>Percy was ready for the depression to hit.</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have to go?” Percy asked his older brother, Charlie. “Who am I supposed to go to now when I'm having trouble? I'm going to be alone this year. You really can't stay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie chuckled and shook his head. “Afraid I'm leaving. Romania is going to be great, and I'm finally going to be able to study dragons like I've been wanting to. Aren't you happy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course Percy was happy. It's not everyday that you get to go to Romania to study dragons and meet new people. It's a great opportunity to get out there more instead of having to stay forgotten at The Burrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he didn't want his brother to leave, anyways. Being smart and a stickler for the rules always meant that he was going to be socially awkward, despite everything that Ron said about Hermione or whatever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I mean, yeah,” Percy sat down on the floor of his room. “But still, now I have to pack for Hogwarts and I'm not gonna have anyone with me for the train over there. I'm not hanging out with Ron and Ginny, lemme tell you that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dinner's ready,” Bill poked his head into the doorway. “Pretend that you like whatever dad made. It's a muggle food that he tried making today.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It's probably going to taste like burnt frog,” Fred commented, passing by the room. “Frog mixed with a log,” George added.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know that he likes to cook now that mom isn't here to do it,” Charlie lectured to everyone, including Ginny who was just a passerby. “Act like it's good. It'll cheer him up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That's another problem. This was going to be Percy's first time at Hogwarts without his mom here, who had passed away at the very end of the school year due to some unknown disease she had been suffering for years now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>First, he loses his mom. Now, his brother was going to leave him too. He didn't really have much to look forward to when he got back from school come summer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe it's the break up. Charlie and his boyfriend, Marcus Flint, had broken up a week before Charlie's seventeenth birthday. Marcus was barley to turn sixteen this year. It may be the heartbreak that caused him to live in Romania.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It's also equally embarrassing when Percy thinks about how he used to </span>
  <em>
    <span>like </span>
  </em>
  <span>Marcus. Before Marcus and Charlie dated, Marcus was Percy's first boy friend. Notice the space in between boy and friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Considering the whole ‘Gryffindor vs Slytherin' thing, it's amazing that the two lasted as long as they did. Year four to the middle-end of year five, in Marcus' terms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Marcus, being a Slytherin, had acted like the breakup meant nothing to him and conspired to still be an amazing Quidditch player. But after the game against Ravenclaw when he had cost his team the game, everyone knew what was really behind the lost.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That's why Percy wrote the letters. He would never get with Marcus. Like hell he'd ever do that to Charlie. He couldn't tell anyone else because he didn't really have any friends, so he ranted about his crushes in his letters.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first one went to Viktor Crum, from the camp that dad had sent the whole family to so they could learn how to play Quidditch. Percy spent most of it inside of his cabin with Viktor. What a memory that summer going into year two had been.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percy remembers on the last day of camp, when he had gotten his quill and parchment and wrote the damn thing. From there on out, he had ranted about all of his crushes from there on out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There's Oliver Wood from year three. Percy went to his first party (wow) and at twelve years old, had his first kiss with the other boy during Spin the Bottle. That's when Percy's feelings for his roommate had started. They aren't really friends, but sharing a room together for what was going to he six years forces them to be, at the very least, mutuals.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then this is where Marcus' letter comes from. He had been getting over Oliver and was in a vulnerable place when he liked Marcus, but that died out when Charlie told him about the cute boy that's on the Slytherin quidditch team.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dean Seamus was, yes, a year younger than him. But in Percy's defense, he didn't know that when he was writing the letter. It wasn't until Ron started rooming with Dean that he had come to the realization in year four.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After that was Cedric, who he had taken to the ball in their fifth year. Or rather, Cedric had taken him to the Yule Ball. Cedric had been chosen as by the Goblet of Fire, and even though he lost in the end, it had still been an amazing night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Plus, that was the first time he had seen Viktor since camp. Anyways, Viktor seemed to have grown a liking to Ron's friend, Hermione. Percy could only bid the old friend goodbye as his school left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cedric was the most recent letter. It's not like Percy ever sent them. Oh god, no. The only purpose those letters served was a way for him to rant about his feelings while also remaining completely secretive about them. It's a way to remind himself how powerful that one's emotions can be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He kept them all in a (very) small trunk that mom had given him. It didn't have any fancy enchantments so that only he could open and close it, but it was a nice little keeper for his letters .</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It </span>
  <em>
    <span>is </span>
  </em>
  <span>a very girly thing to do. Percy had seen Hermione writing away in a little notebook she had. She had once dropped it, and it was addressed to Ron. Percy felt the disappointment that he and a teenage girl did the same thing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I gotta keep packing,” Ron walked away backwards. “Don't wait for me. I shouldn't have waited for the last day to start packing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That's why you should've done it when I told you to,” Percy lectured. He had gotten tired of telling Ron to pack over the duration of the summer, and had finally given up last week.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They all made their way downstairs, minus Ron. Percy had greeted Harry and Hermione, who both had stayed the end of the summer at The Burrow, with a smile. They both waved and went upstairs. No doubt that Ron had told them that the food was bad.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, you have to go?” Percy asked once again, with the little hope that Charlie said that he was going to stay home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, shut up you big baby,” Percy had to duck to avoid being hit by the burnt food that Charlie had thrown.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Pervy,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I assume you're doing good. It's only been like, a week so far at Hogwarts, but I know how you can't possibly survive without me. Get out there, make friends! Break hearts. That's what I'm known for with the Slytherins, at least. All I'm saying is that you should at least try making friends. Don't be so closed off.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Love, </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Charlie </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Percy set the letter down on the table in the dining hall, eyes rolling at the nickname that Charlie had given it. Percy has no experience in that sense with boys or girls so it's not like it has much meaning behind it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as he was done eating dinner, he left the table. No point to stay there when he was hanging out with nobody else. No friends to stick around with to talk about random stuff like everyone else is.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The closest thing that Percy has to a friend is his dorm mates. But Oliver is with his other friends which includes the Quidditch players, and Percy isn't about to intrude on his downtime. He notices something that Oliver is holding between his fingers, though.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a shrug of his shoulders because he doesn't really give a crap and just wants to go back to his room to sleep, Percy left his plate and stood up from the table. He noticed someone else making their way towards him, but couldn't make out who it was at the moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Percy?” He turned around behind him to come face to face with Ron. He noticed the twins laughing as they left the dining hall, but decided not to question it. They can't get into too much trouble right now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm?” Percy responded as he looked at Ron.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Remember how the day before we left for Hogwarts, I said I didn't wanna eat yet?” Ron flushed red.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In all honesty, Percy didn't remember that. But, if Ron says that it happened then like, he’s guessing that it happened. It's a weird thing to lie about anyways. “Sure. Why are you bringing it up now though?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron inhaled and rubbed the back of his neck. “Well, I was looking for something and I found a small trunk. It didn't look any bigger than Ginny's jewelry case, so that's why I assumed that it was! When it turned out to be letters…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percy stopped paying attention as his heart dropped to his toes. Someone else had gone through his room and found the freaking letters he wrote to the guys that he had previously loved. Oh god, Ron </span>
  <em>
    <span>read the freaking letters.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“What'd you do with the letters?” Percy asked, trying his best to keep his voice from cracking and a freakout from happening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I left them all on the window, but Hedwig found them and-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percy didn't let Ron finish his sentence because he had a feeling that he already knew what was coming up. He was trying to keep a straight face as he saw Oliver stand up from his position at the table. “They didn't get out, did they?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Ron shrugged relentlessly. “When I came back to your room, they were gone. I assumed that Hedwig had taken them. I think that they were delivered today.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you say that?” Percy chuckled, ignoring the way the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because Oliver is on his way over here with something red in his hand,” Ron smiled nervously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you delivered my secret love letters?” Percy raised an eyebrow, waiting for confirmation of the inevitable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I accidentally delivered your secret love letters,” Ron shot him finger guns before turning around to try to run away, but all Percy had to do was stick a foot out his younger brother fell face first into the floor. The familiar laughter of the twins filled the dining hall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is… crazy. There's absolutely no way that Hedwig actually delivered the letters to the right place. She's never even seen Oliver or Marcus and the rest. The letters probably ended up in thr middle of the Great Lake. Yeah, no reason to freak out over something stupid.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe we should try avoiding trying to murder other people?” Percy whipped around so fast that he almost got whiplash. The voice of Oliver Wood that he recognized made him regret everything he just thought. “Especially in front of my salad.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You quidditch players always try so hard to stay healthy,” Percy rolled his eyes. “It gets truly annoying at times how much you guys diet. You and your muggle books.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They're called magazines,” Oliver chuckled. “I thought that your family loves muggles? How come you don't know? Anyways, I actually wanted to talk to you about something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percy swears that he almost fainted when he saw the red envelope tucked in between Oliver's hand, but Ron on the floor had later said that all he did was stumble in place a little bit. He didn't even fall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What's that something?” Percy asked, first putting his hand behind his head. That seemed uncomfortable, so he put it on his hip. No, that's seductive. He settled for crossing his arms, trying to not look panicked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm flattered and all,” Oliver smiled shyly at him. “I really am. But Cho and I just broke up and we're in a… really weird place right now if you can even call it that. But really, I'm glad that you think I look like a cloud as I ride on a broomstick-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shhh,” Percy silenced the boy, not wanting to hear anything else. That, and Marcus was now making his way over to where the two were standing right now. And he had a green envelope accompanying him. “Shhhh, shhhhh, sssssshit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oliver turned around briefly to see what Percy was looking at, but didn't see anything worth noting and turned back to face the letter writer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh no,” Percy mumbled as he saw Marcus get held up by Draco for a quick second. “I'm sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percy ignored Oliver's confused face before grabbing him by the shoulders and pulling the other boy in to kiss him. Percy went at him too fast, and the kiss had ended up being really wet and the placement of their lips was all awkward. His chin was getting more kissed than his actual bottom lip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he pulled apart, he briefly saw Marcus’ confused expression before he turned back to look at Oliver. Oh </span>
  <em>
    <span>god Percy had just kissed Oliver Wood in the Great Hall with almost everyone watching. </span>
  </em>
  <span>He'll have his metal breakdown later when he's alone in his room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Percy whispered and patted his shoulder. He turned around on his heel to walk out of the Great Hall, ignoring the whispers that he could hear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His awkward walk turned into a little run as he saw Marcus in the corner of his eye watching him. He's been a week without Charlie and so far he's kissed Oliver Wood and almost beat Ron in the middle of dinner.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe Ron is depressed too. That could be way he's still lying on the floor, head down. Percy walked with his head down all the way back to his room, his letter to Charlie explaining everything that had just happened already written out in his head. </span>
