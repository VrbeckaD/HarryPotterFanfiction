    <p>The orchestra comes to a full crescendo, the sound echoing throughout the large Opera House, builiding <em>higher, higher, higher</em> until it crashes and burns within the hearts of the audience. The dark velvety voice of the lead role captures their minds and seduces the heroine and audience to believe <em>his declaration of love. </em>Oh, how the heroine easily falls for <em>His</em> charms, not knowing that she is just one of many to believe him. Everyone's breath holds deep within their body. Will she learn of her Love's true nature or succumb to the sweet sound of temptation? </p><p>The Angel of Darkness is much too tempting for the heroine, she is <em>falling, falling, falling, </em>until she can fall no more. Her song of inner struggles to fight or succumb, it pulls at the audience. Their judgment of the heroine is oppressive and daunting but they are also entranced with the scene in front of them. </p><p>From the shadows, green green eyes watch in awe and wonder as His voice sings of love while dark undertones of manipulations and insincerity lace his words. They send shivers down everyone's spines.</p><p>The show is a success, and no one can stop praising the lead Tom Riddle. A prodigy with a voice that could cause even the most pure soul to sin. An angel of Darkness, one who many fear and revel all the same. Many Patrons stand behind Riddle, showing their support for his greatness. None can get enough of Riddle, and he basks in the limelight with a façade of humble modesty. </p><p>During the day, the Opera House, Hogwarts, is busy with hustle and bustle as everyone rehearsing the next opera, dancers working until their muscles burn in exhaustion, music floating constantly until it is perfect and Riddle and the other singers practice their scenes until everything is mesmerized and perfect.</p><p>Nothing short of perfection, is the Opera House Motto.</p><p>But during the darkness of the night, when all and everyone lays asleep to the world around them, a lithe figure with green green eyes steps upon the darken stage with only a single candle. They call him the Phantom of the Opera or Opera Ghost, but he is just a human who lives within the attic of the Opera House. Giving inspiration and encouragement to those who need it.</p><p>Harry. His name that no one will ever know, even after he perishes and his body decays and rots back to the earth. But it doesn't matter.</p><p>Laying the single candle near the edge but not to too close to fall, Harry puts on the worn dancing shoes he had seen one of the dancers throw in a corner to lay abandoned. They would last him a little while until he could take the old ones from another dancer. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. The exercises help to calm him. Slowly and gracefully, he begins the steps for a dance that has no routine but comes from within.</p><p>Harry twists and turns. Jumps and bends. Fast and slow. Movements that have no order but are just his pure existence in life. He may never become a part of the theater's group but dancing was in his blood. The shadows dance across his body and Harry can hear the orchestra playing within his own mind. The single flame and the light sounds of dancing feet are the only things visible and heard upon the large shadowy stage.</p><p>Harry never notices calculating and shrewd icy blue grey-eyes watching from deep within the shadows, hidden in one of the many corners of the Hall.</p><p>As the candle becomes a single stub with a dying flame, Harry ends his dance breathing hard, muscles full of exhaustion, and a bright smile upon his face. How dancing breathed life into him. With a quick blow to the flame, everything is once again enshroud in darkness.</p><p> </p><p>//</p><p> </p><p>Harry stays hidden within the attic where the old costumes, props and set pieces lay forgotten within, the <em>Room of Hidden Things,</em> but it is his Kingdom. A place where no one dares enter in fear of upsetting the Opera Ghost. While rehearsals are practiced and practiced until no one can no longer dance and sing, Harry plays within his kingdom, wearing old costumes, becoming a King, General, ghost, even the occasional regal Lady.</p><p>It doesn't matter, Harry can pretend that he isn't a nobody but a world known singer like...<em>Riddle.</em></p><p>When it is safe to venture, Harry goes to the kitchen to see a plate full of lunch just there for him. He knows the cook does this to stay on his good side. A lovely Mrs. Wesley, who makes wonderful and delicious food. But he is thankful all the same that he does not starve.</p><p>He knows he has at least an hour before the cook comes back to make more lunch for the rest of the troupe, so he quickly eats his food and washes the plate, days it before putting it away and silently opening a secret passageway that no one knows about. It is easy for him to move around and bee unseen.</p><p> </p><p>//</p><p> </p><p>Harry doesn't know what happened. It was a normal night like always, with his worn out dance shoes, a single candle and the empty stage, a place where he could dance his heart away. It was the same... yet it wasn't.</p><p>Harry knew no one knew about him or had seen him, or at least he thought so but apparently that wasn't true because, there by the dwindling candle and flame, lay a single red rose with a black ribbon next to the candle. Green eyes widen in shock and it is like time has frozen.</p><p>
  <em>Th-thump, th-thump, th-thump</em>
</p><p>How his heartbeat raced within his chest, he knew it was from dancing but also the fear of being discovered and removed from Hogwarts. His only home. He can't be discovered. He just can't!</p><p>Harry leaves quickly, blowing the flame out, not wishing to stay to only be discovered. The Hall is once again enshroud in darkness, allowing Harry to covertly move towards the hidden passageway back to his Attic.</p><p>The rose lays forgotten on the stage.</p><p> </p><p>//</p><p> </p><p>He doesn't go to the stage the next night, or the next, or the following nights after that. Hiding away from the world, as fear of discovery occupy his mind, he has hardly ventured out from his safe haven, only to eat. Too distracted, Harry barely notices when the attic door is creaking open, signaling that someone has dared to enter his domain. He quickly hides behind a large prop of a half made and half deteriorated castle piece.</p><p>It takes all his willpower and years of practice to be silent, to not let out a surprised gasp, placing a hand over his mouth for good measure.</p><p>Tom Riddle saunters into the semi-clean attic full of props and costumes, gazing around with a slight interest. The man walks slowly around the front part of the attic before stopping by a large crate and placing a letter with a single red rose with a black ribbon on top. He turns to leave but after his grey-blue eyes sweep the attic one last time.</p><p>Seconds, minutes, maybe even hours pass before Harry cautiously moves away from his hiding spot towards the letter and rose.</p><p>The items lay there so innocently, tempting him to read and Harry can't help wondering why <em>The Tom Riddle </em>would journey up towards the room of the Opera Ghost.</p><p>An internal struggle happens before he finally succumbs temptation, gingerly he breaks the wax seal to see the elegant handwriting flowing across the paper.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>My Dear Little Phantom,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>For many years, I have been curious to know more about you. I had always hoped to meet you faced to face. Then a fortnight ago, I saw you dancing alone on the darken stage. How entranced I was by your lithe and agile body and performance of your dance. You had truly captured my interest that night. I wish to meet you. I would like you to meet me in my room at midnight tonight. I eagerly await your arrival, My Phantom. I will wait every night until you show and I can be quite persuasive when need be. I hope that you will take up the invitation.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yours,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>TMR</em>
</p><p>
  <em>P.S. I do hope you enjoy my little gift.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The letter shook within Harry's trembling hands. His thoughts full of panic, fear, intrigue, and wonderment. He had been <em>seen. </em>He had been seen dancing by Tom Riddle. Harry didn't know what to do. Riddle wanted to meet with him. </p><p>But what did Riddle want? Harry knew how dangerous and manipulative the man could be. He had seen it a many a times when Riddle charmed all those around him.</p><p>It didn't bode well for him.</p><p>Carefully, Harry picks up the rose. It's beautiful and in full bloom and Harry can't help but smile softly at the rare gift he received.</p><p>But now he had to be extra careful, because the Angel of Darkness was after the Phantom of the Opera. He couldn't be caught, no matter what.</p>
