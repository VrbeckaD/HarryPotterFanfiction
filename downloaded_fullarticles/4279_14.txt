  <span>The Potters were a model family in the wizarding world; their pictures appeared in papers and magazines across the magical world. The people adored James Potter’s roguish good looks and easy going smile. The perfect picture of a proud father and a family man and he was Head Auror to boot. The public was enamored with Lily Potter’s gorgeous eyes and deep red locks. Pretty, smart and a muggleborn actually climbing up the social ladder. She was an inspiration for young witches everywhere. Then there was the Boy-Who-Lived, little Charlie James Potter. Everyone adored the little redhead with the hazel eyes. He was as cute as a button and showed promise to be the next heart throb for Witch Weekly once he hit his teens. Everyone loved the Potters. They just seemed so...perfect. Of course they were though, the Boy-Who-Lived's family had to be perfect, right? Well...two little boys would honestly beg to differ.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>Hector and Hadrian Potter were born the same day as their older brother, but a year apart...and yet they never had a celebration put on for them like this. They never really had much of their parent’s attention to begin with. Maybe once, a long time ago, but they couldn’t recall it. They were much too young when their brother defeated Voldemort to remember anything but what they had now, which were two stone cold parents. It was always Charlie before anything concerning the twins. When they were little it didn't bother them nearly as much; it was just how things always have been. It was normal. They were old enough, now, though, to know that the coldness their mother treated them with and the indifference their father treated them with was just simply not normal. They've watched the Weasleys before, when they were brought over to play with their brother. Mrs. Weasley treated all of her children with the same tenderness that their parents only showed Charlie. She really didn't seem to be trying to put on over the other and she didn't, say, ignore one for the other constantly. They way they lived, scurrying from one shadow to another to avoid their older brother's shrieks of blame or their mother's cold glare and harsh words was not the way every younger sibling lived. It made something start boiling inside of Hector and something hard grow in Hadrian's heart. </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Currently, Hector, who was the older twin by mere seconds, leaned against the banister of the grand staircase leading down into the Potter Manor’s Entrance hall, watching the crowds come and go and mingle with a scowl on his face. Hector was a lanky child and temperamental child, whose hands and feet were a smidgen too big for his skinny arms and legs. He, quite unintentionally, was the one who got them in trouble the most. Hector, plainly, had the shortest fuse in existence and wouldn't really stand for Charlie's constant bullying. He often stepped between his twin and Charlie when the older boy decided he wanted something to wail on or throw stinging hexes at with his practice wand. Unlike Hadrian, who would just put up his arms in defense and take it, Hector was one to hit back and hit back hard. Needless to say, he got the belt more than his younger brother ever did. He frowned and brushed back some of his dark red hair from his eyes, which was a curly mess laid at his chin and promised a literal mane someday if allowed to continue. His eyes were a sharp, dark brown and he was the only Potter male that did not need glasses quite yet. He let out a huff and pressed leaned his chin against his folded arms, leg shaking slightly with bound up energy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hadrian, otherly known as Harry by only his uncles and twin, let out a small snort, looking over at his twin. Hadrian was nearly the complete opposite of Hector in not only looks but demeanor. Hadrian was calm, cool and collected. He knew when to be quite and it took quite a bit to get the small boy truly angry. Though, when he did strike back it was always meticulously planned and prepped in a manner which, 8 times out of 10, did not lead back to either of them. Didn't really stop them from getting the blame anyways, but he tried. Where Hector was lanky Hadrian was what could be described as petite. He was slender and strangely graceful looking for a child. It made him seem both endearing and eerie; A fact that both twins found kind of amusing as Hadrian's presence seemed to make their mother uncomfortable, which, they, of course, found hilarious from time to time. He's even made her shriek before by just standing in the doorway of the kitchen. Unlike his twin, his hair was a bit more tamed, falling to his shoulders in slightly looser curls and his eyes were a wide and bright green. Though, they were obscured by a pair of old glasses, for which he was lucky to be able to see out of at all, since they were Charlie’s old prescription. He hummed softly, tapping his fingers against chin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Vultures,” Hadrian commented from his perch on the stairs where he sat, leaning his chin on one palm. His eyes mainly followed the minister as he shook their father’s hand enthusiastically. Hector grunted in response, eyes more trained on their brother, Charlie, who was on the shoulders of </span>
  <em>
    <span>their</span>
  </em>
  <span> Godfather, Sirius, having a grand old time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hadrian blinked and followed his twin’s line of sight and frowned, letting out a sigh and shifting his eyes to the ground. When was the last time Sirius paid them any attention? When they were eight maybe...they were nine now. A full year. Hector glanced at Hadrian and gripped the banister tightly, gritting his teeth slightly before returning his now glaring gaze to his Godfather and older brother. Hadrian noticed that and frowned thinly, and shook his head. He didn't want Hector's temper to get the better of him today of all days. Last time they ruined one of precious little Charlie's birthday parties their mother had screamed at them until she was horse and their father had locked Hadrian in a cupboard in the kitchen and Hector in a closet on the other side of the house. Hadrian shivered slightly at the memory, wrapping his arms around his middle. He's never been that long without Hector. Never. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He understood Hector's ire though. While they never really had their parent’s attention, since it was always focused on Charlie, they </span>
  <em>
    <span>at least</span>
  </em>
  <span> had Sirius and Remus. Sirius and Remus always paid attention to them when they came by, bringing them toys and books (Most of which Charlie claimed as his after they left, but it was fun while it lasted) and playing with them. Sirius would even let them ride around on his back when he was in animagus form when they were small, running around the manor at full speed much to the twins’ delight. Remus would read to them softly and let them cuddle into his sides. He’s the one who taught them to read actually. They missed their Moony and Padfoot...and they didn’t know what they ever did wrong because suddenly it all just stopped and, like with their parents, it became all about Charlie. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, I have to help Charlie with lessons today” or “I just don’t have time, pups.” It just all made Hector want to explode. He jumped slightly when he felt a hand touch his arm. Hadrian was now on his feet in that moment, seemingly able to tell what was on Hector's mind. They stared at each other for a moment before looking back down at the party once more, Hadrian's hand still firmly on his forearm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t get it,” Hector muttered, letting out a heavy sigh and wiping his slightly teary eyes with the back of his hand, “What did we do wrong, Harry?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hadrian stared mutely down at the party for a moment before saying softly, “I...I don’t know...maybe...maybe </span>
  <em>
    <span>we </span>
  </em>
  <span>didn’t do anything wrong but-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe it was Charlie...Charlie stole Padfoot and Moony from us...like our toys,” Hector muttered, a dark look crossing his face as he dug his nails into the banister. It honestly made perfect sense to Hector. Charlie liked to steal things that weren't his and Padfoot wasn't his godfather, he was Hector and Harry's godfather. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Someone should punish him,” Hadrian said bluntly, eyes narrowing at the red headed boy again as he stuffed his hands in the pockets of his trousers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hector went silent for a moment, eyes locked on Charlie and Sirius. He felt something seemingly bubble under the surface of his skin; red hot and boiling, churning and just wanting to </span>
  <em>
    <span>come out</span>
  </em>
  <span>. In that instant something did. Fire. Fire, the party was burning, Charlie was screaming and Hadrian’s bright green eyes were looking down at him in shock and concern, thin, pale hands grabbing his arm tight, trying to pull him up from his knees. When did Hector fall to his knees? Everything felt fuzzy and last thing he saw before completely backing out was the blurred figure of his twin and the larger figures approaching rapidly behind him. </span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily knew this day would come, she just knew it. Ever since she brought them into this world she distinctly felt like she should of done the world a justice and drown them both. They weren’t supposed to happen, either of them. After Charlie was born Lily did not want anymore. They were in the middle of a war and one child to care for was enough, especially after Albus told her and James the prophecy. Her son, her baby boy, had a destiney...a terrible one. The mere thought made her insides twist with anxiety. Her sweet baby boy...she shook her head slightly...she shouldn’t linger on that. He lived though, past that terrible night, she made sure of that and the twins were the unwanted result that came with that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stared down her nose at them, Hector, who was passed out on the couch still and Hadrian, hovering next to him...staring right back at her with those eyes. She always thought he was an unnerving child from the day he was born. He just...stared right through her with those wide, killing-curse green eyes. The redhead shuttered and looked off to the side, just to break eye contact. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She should of tried harder to convince James that they were dangerous...or her Charlie wouldn’t be at Saint Mungos, getting the skin regrown on his arm. At least he finally believed her, as did Sirius and Remus...they had to go. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Next to her James was nearly vibrating in anger, and on the other side of her Albus Dumbledore was stroking his beard, staring at the twins with that twinkle in his eye.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I warned you that this would happen,” The old man began, “That they would get jealous of their brother.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I never thought-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“James...accidental magic is unpredictable, of course it would respond to a child’s jealousy and lash out. He might of not meant it, but he and young Hadrian are too dangerous to keep around Charlie now. I propose we send them to live somewhere else.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hadrian seemed to slightly perk up at that and asked, in a soft voice, tentative and hopeful, “P-Padfoot and Moony?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like they would want you!” Lily hissed out, before James could beat her to it, “You’re dangerous little freaks! It just took them until now to realize what you two really are…monsters” She let out a shaky breath, digging her fingers into her skirt to keep them from trembling. She didn’t care how hurt Hadrian looked. She didn’t care about the tears building in the child’s eyes and how his lower lip wobbled. He and his brother both are little monsters, and not her sons...at least not now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re sending you to an orphanage,” James said bluntly, his voice cold, “And you’ll never hurt Charlie again.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please! Father, Mother...w-we...we...w..” The boy was cut off by a silent sleeping spell shot at him by Albus, and soon went limp next to his brother after trying in vain to keep his eyes open. His head fell forward and his glasses fell to the ground with a small clatter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that Albus stood up, “We should erase their memories so they can’t try to hurt Charlie again once they’re older…as well as put a bind on their magic...they’ll be barely above squib level and lucky if they receive a Hogwarts letter at all.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily nodded, smiling in approval of the plan. They would never darken her doorstep again and she could put them...and </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span>, behind her now, once and for all. </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>The two children were left on the doorstep of a local muggle orphanage hours later, a letter carefully tucked into young Hadrian's hand. Their magic was bound and memories wiped so that they only remembered their first names and the fact that they were brothers. Albus Dumbledore walked away from the pair of unconscious children humming lightly, a smirk playing on his lips, not realizing that he was not the only one who just witnessed him abandon two children. He didn’t see the figure looming in the shadows of the brick archway that was the entrance to the orphanage, just out of view. Dumbledore thought, as he apparated away, that there would be no more kinks in his perfectly formulated plans.</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well...he was quite wrong. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My my,” A silky voice spoke softly as a male figure approached the unconscious boys, “Don’t you two smell </span>
  <em>
    <span>quite</span>
  </em>
  <span> familiar…” With a wave of his hand shadows engulfed both him and the boys and seconds later they disappeared from sight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The letter that was in Hadrian’s hand laid forgotten on the doorstep to Wool’s Orphanage, only to be blown aside in the night and into the muddy soil by an overgrown bush. The matrion of the orphanage would wake in the morning, get the milk and move about her day as usual, never knowing that, briefly, two particularly odd children might have become part of her life. Albus Dumbledore would sit in his office, sucking on the lemon drop, rather pleased with himself. Lily Potter would spend the night sitting by her oldest, and now only, son’s bedside, feeling lighter than she had been in the last nine years. James Potter would spend his night ridding his home of any trace of the fact that three children had once lived there and not just one. Sirius Black and Remus Lupin would sit together, a heavy feeling in their guts as guilt began to twist up from insides then as they looked at the single picture on the mantle of them and a pair of smiling, bright-eyed little boys. </span>
