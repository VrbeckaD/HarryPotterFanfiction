          <div class="userstuff"><p>I took 23 Benadryl. It wasn’t like I was expecting anything to happen. It said online that you’d hallucinate but I guess I didn’t believe it. i thought I would just throw them up like usual, like the time I took my grandpas prescription pills and nothing happened so I took some more and then threw up. All that happened was an aching stomach, vomit, and an unnecessary trip to the er. </p>
<p>Maybe I was hoping something would happen. That I would feel, and it would be enough. That someone would find me and maybe lend a little help. Or that I would get lost inside my head and finally figure something out.</p>
<p>Nothing happened. And it wore off all too fast. And my parents found out and did nothing.</p>
<p>I should’ve taken more</p></div>
