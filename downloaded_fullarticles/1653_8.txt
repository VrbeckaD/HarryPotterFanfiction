    <p>Hi my name is Liliana Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long black raven hair (thats how i got the name). With purple tips and red streaks that reach my mid back and icy blue eyes that look like limpid tears. A lot of people tell me that I look like Billy Eyelash (AN: if you don’t know who the fuck that is then get out of here!) I’m not related to Brendon Urie but I wish i was because he’s a major fucking hottie. I’m a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I’m also a necromancer, and I go to a magic school called Ravnica Academy in Ravnica where I’m a senior (I’m eighteen). I’m a goth (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. An I also have a bunch of markings on my skin from the evil dwagon &gt;:3 Nicol Bolas. I was walking outside Ravnica Academy. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of Boros stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.</p><p>“Hey Liliana!” shouted a voice. I looked up. It was…. Jace Beleren!</p><p>“What’s up Jace?” I asked.</p><p>“Nothing.” he said shyly.</p><p>But then, I heard my friends call me and I had to go away.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>AN: IS it good? PLZ tell me fangz!</p>
