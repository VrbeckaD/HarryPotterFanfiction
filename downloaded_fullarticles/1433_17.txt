    <p>Mila huffed as she entered the Common Room, announcing her presence. Most people were usually alerted to her presence anyway, no matter if she made a fuss or not. However as she looked around the room she noticed there weren't many people still awake, it was a late hour and the loudest thing in the room was the crackling fire. </p><p>She caught the eye of her friends and made her way over to the couch they had occupied. Harry was on the floor, facing Ron and Hermione, and Mila went to his side. It was nice to belong somewhere, and for Mila that place was by Harry. She had been there in first year when they’d stopped Professor Quirrell from getting the Philosopher’s Stone, in second year when she and Harry killed the basilisk, third year when they met Sirius and fourth, when Harry had come out of the maze after seeing Voldemort try and fail to reanimate. By his side she had stayed, and him by her’s. </p><p>They hadn’t heard so much as a soundbite from Voldemort since then, and now in their sixth year it finally started to seem like he had never come back. Things had calmed down since the Triwizard Tournament. The benefit was, of course, no Voldemort, but on the other hand it gave Mila a lot more time to get in trouble. Restlessness didn’t suit her.</p><p>“How was detention?” Harry smiled at her. </p><p>“Snape kept me back way longer than anyone else. Completely unjustified!” Mila complained. Ron and Harry laughed and even Hermione, who often disapproved of Mila’s antics, cracked a smile.</p><p>“Well, you did set Malfoy’s desk on fire. What was he supposed to do? Give you house points?”</p><p>“But unlike my cruel punishment, that <em>was</em> justified. He was being… Malfoy.”</p><p>Harry nudged her and spoke quietly, “And I appreciate it, but you need to stop getting in trouble for me.” The reason Mila has set Malfoy’s desk on fire was because, once again, he’d kept making snide remarks about Harry. That wasn’t what Mila had told Snape, instead opting for the excuse that she had seen a mosquito on his desk and hadn’t wanted Malfoy to get malaria. </p><p>Mila smiled back at Harry, “Worth it.” If possible, his own smile widened even more. </p><p>“You’re right Mila, it was worth it. His face was priceless,” Ron agreed and Mila turned her attentions to him. She noticed he was sitting a lot closer to Hermione than he normally dared to, and it made her cheerful to think they might finally be making a bit of progress. </p><p>“You are certainly right Ronald. I would do it all over again.” </p><p><br/>
“Well hopefully not on another night when we have such an early class the next day. But Harry insisted we all wait up for you,” Hermione said. </p><p>Mila turned disapprovingly to Harry, “Harry, you didn't have to.”</p><p>Harry ducked his head, “Well I mean, you did save a life today. It was least I could do, Malfoy might have gotten seriously ill.”</p><p>Mila chuckled, “Anyway, we’d better let Hermione get her beauty rest. Bed?’ All three of them nodded. </p><p>Not for the first time Mila wished boys and girls were allowed to share rooms. She wanted to tell Harry about the weird looks Snape had been giving her in detention, but she could tell he was tired and she didn’t want to make him stay up any later than he already had for her. He would if she asked, of course he would, and it was for that reason she didn’t. </p><p>She could tell Hermione, but it just wasn’t the same. Hermione didn’t have the history with Snape that Harry did. Mila would probably still tell her anyway, she was a night person and she often didn’t slow down enough to sleep until the early hours, and thankfully Hermione had stayed up enough nights studying to be used to the same. That was definitely one of the benefits at having Hermione for a friend. </p><p>Mila and Hermione walked up the stairs to the girl’s rooms. As they got ready for bed, Mila told her story.</p><p>“I’m telling you Hermione, he kept snarling at me. It was just the weirdest thing.”</p><p>“You’re exaggerating,” Hermione chastised. She was right, as she often was, and Mila did have a flair for dramatics. </p><p>“Ok fine, but he just kept… staring.” The look on Snape's face was one she had seen before, usually when he thought she wasn’t looking. It was unnerving, especially when the others serving detention had left and she was alone with him. She’d kept herself busy scrubbing cauldron’s, but she couldn't help noticing the two beady eyes on her.</p><p>“He was probably making sure you were staying on task. You get restless, especially in detention.”</p><p>“I guess you're right,” Mila answered after a moment. What else could it be anyway? At least it wasn’t the looks he gave when she was with Harry, he always acted like the two were conspiring against him. </p><p>Still, when Mila went to sleep that night she couldn’t help but think about it. This had been happening a lot more lately, not just with Snape, but other teachers as well. It was like they all knew something she didn’t. </p><p>Maybe it had something to do with Voldemort, maybe not, but she was going to find out.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Mila had overslept. She knew that because she had woken up to a post-it note on her forehead from Hermione. </p><p>
  <em>Tried to wake you, but you refused to move. Gone to class. Don’t be late again. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your sensible friend, Hermione. </em>
</p><p>Mila laughed at the note and quickly shot up to put her dress robes on. At least they had double Defence Against the Dark Arts this morning, Lupin wouldn’t mind her being late. Hopefully. She quickly got changed and rushed out the common room, annoyed she had missed breakfast after also missing dinner last night. It would be ages before she got to eat anything.</p><p>She made her way to the class room in record time, having got the hang of the moving stair cases in first year. It hadn’t taken her long to figure the school out. Nobody knew more of its secrets than she did. A lot of that could be credited to the map Harry’s dad had made. Even still, she could tell she was very late. She took a deep breath before opening the door, wondering if she could get away with just taking a seat quietly.</p><p>That didn’t happen. </p><p>“Nice of you to join us this morning, Miss Lovett,” Professor Lupin said. She froze in the spot and sighed humorously. </p><p>“Nothing gets past you does it, Professor.” He wasn’t laughing, but she could see a twinkle in his eye to let her know he was amused. Good. She caught him in a good mood. </p><p>“What was it this time? Saved a student from an avalanche? Had to see Madam Pomfrey for a broken leg?”</p><p>Mila played along, “Actually Sir, it was gross injustice. I did in fact rescue a student yesterday, only it was from malaria. But instead I was punished with a late detention. Very late, Professor. In fact I’ve only just gotten out of it.”</p><p>There were a few giggles among the class and she caught Harry’s eye, him being among them. </p><p>Even Lupin cracked a smile, “And which teacher should I speak to for your horrible treatment. Just to make sure your story holds up I mean.”</p><p>“Don’t fight anyone on my behalf, Professor, but if you must know, it was Professor Snape.”</p><p>Lupin’s smile fell, and for a second Mila couldn’t quite make out his expression, but then he gave her an understanding look. </p><p>“I see. Take a seat Miss Lovett. It seems that Harry has saved one for you.”</p><p>Mila nodded gratefully, and practically ran to the seat, hoping she wouldn’t get in any trouble for holding the lesson up.</p><p>“However,” Lupin continued, “I would like to see you after class.”</p><p>Mila groaned, but nodded. The class laughed, both Gryffindors and Slytherins were used to her giving back talk to Professors, and though maybe the Slytherins wouldn’t admit it, they all enjoyed it. </p><p>“Bad luck,” Harry whispered, “I really thought you got out of that one.”</p><p>“To be honest, I’m more upset I’ll have to wait even longer to get something to eat.” At this point, her stomach would be growling through the whole class. </p><p>Harry grinned at her, piquing her curiosity. “What?” she asked, matching his smile. </p><p>Underneath the table she felt him put something in her hands, she knew immediately what it was.</p><p>“Oh Harry, you are a blessing!”</p><p>“You skipped breakfast,” he shrugged, and got back to the work they were both supposed to be doing. </p><p>Mila spent the lesson eating the muffin as inconspicuously as possible. She was pretty sure Lupin didn’t even notice. Not that he would mind, he was pretty lenient with his students, especially friends of Harry. It was because of James, of course, but she sensed he cared more about Harry than as just his friend’s son. He treated him more like his own. </p><p>At the end of the lesson Mila waited dutifully in her seat for the other student’s to leave. Harry offered to wait for her, like he always did when she was asked to stay behind. She didn’t want that on her conscience though, so she told him to get some lunch. He didn’t look pleased, but went anyway. Sometimes he worried about her more than his own good. </p><p>Lupin beckoned her to the front of the class where his own desk was. He stayed seating as she stood before him, waiting for him to speak. </p><p>He seemed to be struggling for the right words so Mila helped him, “So, how much trouble am I in?”</p><p>Lupin smiled, “You’re not in trouble. I was just wondering how long Snape kept you last night.”</p><p>“Oh,” Mila haltered at the unexpected question, “Uh, pretty late I guess. Later than the others, though I suppose I got into a bit more trouble than they did,” she said honestly. </p><p>“And.. it was ok?” Lupin seemed to be searching for something from Mila that she totally wasn’t getting.</p><p>“I scrubbed cauldrons, is that ever ok? Those things are nasty. It’s exploitive labour.”</p><p>Lupin coughed, “That’s not exactly what I meant-“</p><p>“I think Mr Potter is eager to escort Miss Lovett to lunch, Professor Lupin. Maybe we should let the kids run along.”</p><p>Mila turned to see the Headmaster closing the distance between them. </p><p>Great. Now Dumbledore was going to know she was late to class. “I told him not to wait for me, Professor Dumble-“</p><p>“I know dear, but it’s ok. Rather than keep him loitering in the hall, perhaps you should both get something to eat. I noticed you weren’t at breakfast, you must be hungry.” He knew already, not that Mila should be surprised. </p><p>“Sure,” she said slowly, and gave both Professors a last look before she left the room. Lupin seemed to be embarrassed and she wasn't sure why, but Dumbledore gave her a pointed look so she hurried out of there.</p><p>She ran into Harry, who like Dumbledore had said, was waiting for her outside the room. </p><p>“I see you made it out alive,” he smiled, but frowned when she didn’t return it. </p><p>“Whats the matter?” he asked worriedly. </p><p>“You know, I’m really not sure, but I think Lupin is in trouble with Dumbledore.”</p><p>Harry laughed at his confused friend, “Come on Lovett, lets go get some lunch.”</p><p>~~~~</p><p>Remus didn't meet Dumbledore’s eye as he spoke, “Snape kept her late last night, Dumbledore. I’m not sure that-“</p><p>“I spoke to Severus this morning Remus. It seems she set a students desk on fire, the detention was deserved.”</p><p>Remus visibly relaxed, “That’s good. I was worried.”</p><p>“About Severus, or about Mila?” Dumbledore said knowingly.</p><p>“Both. It’s getting harder Albus. For both of us, I think,” Remus admitted. </p><p>Dumbledore put a hand on Remus’ shoulder, “I know. But Voldemort is gone and she’s very settled. It would be a mistake to tell her at this moment.”</p><p>“It’s not just that though,” Remus paced and moved out of Dumbledore’s grip, “Sirius is getting more and more agitated, he keep’s talking about coming to the grounds. And Molly, she just about cries every time she sees Mila.”</p><p>“You’ve done a good job at keeping Sirius in line. If it helps, I’ll talk to him. But he’s seeing her in the Christmas break. He’ll get better for a while.”</p><p>“Or worse,” Remus said quietly, “The older she gets… we’ve been lying to her for a long time Albus. I’m worried that maybe, she’ll never forgive us.” </p><p>“I know. But what can one accomplish with worry?”</p>
