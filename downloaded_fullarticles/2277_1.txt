    <p>"I have plenty of my own money, you know," Harry pointed out.</p><p>"I know," Tom said, not even looking up as he flipped a page on the Daily Prophet. The picture on the front page waved at Harry and Harry made a face back in response.</p><p>"You don't need to keep buying me things," Harry continued, holding out the fine dragon-hide gloves Tom had just given him. They were supple to the touch, obviously expensive, which was a shame since Harry was just going to scratch them up in Quidditch.</p><p>"I enjoy buying you things," Tom said simply. He looked up then and raised an eyebrow. "I enjoy taking care of you."</p><p>Harry flushed at that and looked back down at his new leather gloves. He touched them reverently. They really were quite nice.</p><p>“Do you want me to return that?"</p><p>"No," Harry immediately answered, pulling it back and scowling. "They're mine."</p><p>Tom smirked. "I <em> do </em> enjoy seeing you wear the things I bought you. It’s almost as enjoyable as seeing you wear my clothes."</p><p>Harry paused at that, and then a sly smile curled up his lips. He inched closer towards the older man and tilted his head, fluttering his eyelashes in an over-exaggerated motion.</p><p>"You buy me clothes," he stated, and Tom frowned.</p><p>"I do."</p><p>"You take me on expensive vacations."</p><p>"…I do."</p><p>"You feed me," Harry continued, slowly closing the gap between them. Tom watched him in amusement, already putting aside his paper. Harry slipped into his lap, draping his arms over Tom's shoulders, and Tom automatically held onto his waist, his hands warm and firm. The beginnings of arousal curled in Harry's gut. "You take such <em> very </em> good care of me."</p><p>Harry's voice was low and overtly sultry, his smile mischievous now.</p><p>"Are you my <em> sugar daddy</em>, Mr. Riddle?"</p><p>Tom's eyebrows shot up to his forehead in genuine surprise before he smirked.</p><p>"Well," he said, playing along, his hands slipping underneath Harry's shirt to splay his hands out over Harry's side. "I <em> am </em> 12 years older than you. And you're right, I do all those things."</p><p>"So are you?" Harry asked, grinning down at him.</p><p>"The real question is," Tom said, tilting his face up to brush his lips against Harry's neck. Harry tilted his head to the side, and Tom nipped at his jaw, mouth hot and wet. He pressed a kiss to the curve of Harry's ear, and whispered into it, "are you my baby?"</p><p>Harry laughed and pulled away as he shivered. "Oh, that's weird," he said, rubbing at his ear where Tom’s mouth had been. "People <em> do </em> think I'm just your trophy husband though."</p><p>"Shame on them," Tom smirked. "That's their problem."</p><p>He reached up with one hand to brush his knuckles against Harry's cheek, tenderly almost. His eyes were dark, and Harry swallowed at the lust in them.</p><p>"I do take very good care of you, don't I?" Tom mused out loud. Harry nodded silently, leaning into Tom's hand on his face, and settling into the older man's lap, thighs on either side. "I take very good care of my things, in general."</p><p>"Are you trying to say you own me?" Harry asked, laughing. He couldn't deny the low heat that burned in him at his own words.</p><p>"Don't I?" Tom teased. "Everything you're wearing right now I paid for."</p><p>Harry swallowed. There was a tension in the air now, thick and heavy around them, and Harry felt his cock twitch in his pants—that Tom did, in fact, buy him. His shirt felt tight on him, a heavy reminder of the truth in Tom’s words.</p><p>"I should be allowed to take them back or to tell you to take them off," Tom said. He wasn't completely teasing now, Harry could tell. He sounded intent, obsessive in that way he sometimes got, and Harry licked his lips. He inched closer, settling in right over Tom's hardening erection.</p><p>Tom's grip tightened around his waist, his hand at Harry's face curling down to wrap at the back of his neck. Heavy. Almost like a collar. Harry had to stop himself from whimpering.</p><p>"If you do own me…" Harry said, and trailed off, his face hot. Tom waited with his hand on Harry's neck, warm and firm. Harry swallowed. "If you do own me, then you can have me anytime. Anywhere. That's how it works, right?"</p><p>"Anytime?" Tom asked. His lip twitched, curling into a dark smile. Harry's breath stuttered and he looked down, bashful, his whole neck and chest warm now too. "And what am I allowed to do to you?"</p><p>Tom nudged his chin up and Harry met his eyes through his eyelashes, expression coy.</p><p>"Anything," Harry promised. "Everything."</p><p>Tom chuckled lowly and pulled him in down for a kiss, slow and languid. Harry moaned into his mouth, his grip tightening on Tom's shoulders as he closed his eyes. Tom's mouth was slick and warm against his own, hungry, his tongue greedy.</p><p>They pulled away from each other, Harry panting in the space between them.</p><p>"You're going to regret saying that," Tom told him, amused, and Harry laughed.</p><p>"You promise?" he asked, and Tom grinned, wide and pleased before he drew Harry back into another kiss.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>Their conversation lay at the back of Harry’s mind the next few days, but Tom did nothing about it. Their sex life stayed much the same with brief bouts of passionate love-making when they were both free, Tom from his political duties and social maneuverings, and Harry from Quidditch practice and what not.</p><p>Harry could almost believe that Tom had simply just forgotten about it, preoccupied as he was with the recent bill he was trying to push through. And yet…he couldn’t dismiss the intensity of Tom’s gaze, the way Tom was so obviously into Harry’s suggestion of anything and everything, anytime and anywhere. But after a week of nothing, even Harry had let it go to be brought back up when Tom wasn’t so busy.</p><p>It was easy, especially when whispers of the Quidditch World Cup started to pop up. It was held every four years but Qualifying Rounds started 2 years before the Tournament Proper, and Teams were picked a year before that.</p><p>When the manager of the English National Quidditch Team owled him with a request for a floo call, Harry excitedly agreed.</p><p>“Would you like to play for England, Mr. Potter?”</p><p>“I would be honored to play for England,” Harry immediately said, a wide smile breaking out across his face. The last time they had been looking for players, Harry had been but 15. It had been 4 years since then, and Harry was now well established in the British and Irish Quidditch League. He was the only proper choice for Seeker, the Quidditch tabloids had said, with his 2-year-straight run of catching the snitch in every game.</p><p>A superb performance, especially if you took into account how he’d only been playing for those 2 years, a rookie among the more experienced players.</p><p>“The World Cup is still 3 years off of course,” Denison Frisby—former Keeper, now Manager of the English National Quidditch Team—said. He was squatting down in front of the fireplace, and still Harry had to look up from where his head was in the Floo. “But we’d love to have you practice with the team, get a feel.”</p><p>Harry opened his mouth to respond, but the sensation of hands on his hips stopped him. They moved to his front and unbuttoned his trousers.</p><p>“Er,” he said, suddenly flustered, his face heating up. He wondered if he could pass it off as a result of the green flames of the Floo, but probably not. “Give me a few seconds, Mr Frisby.”</p><p>He pulled his head out of the fireplace and whirled around to glare at his lover, hand flying out to stop the steady advance of his trousers down his hips.</p><p>“<em>Tom</em>,” he hissed. “I’m talking to the English Team’s Manager!”</p><p>“I know,” Tom said cooly. He raised an eyebrow and motioned towards the fireplace. “Go ahead, I’m not stopping you.”</p><p>Harry stared at him in disbelief, his face hot. He squeaked when Tom yanked his trousers and underwear down to his thighs, his ass and cock exposed to the cool air, and squirmed in embarrassment at Tom’s dark, heavy gaze.</p><p>“Tom…” he said plaintively, but Tom only smirked at him.</p><p>“Anytime, anywhere, right?”</p><p>Harry swallowed. Of course Tom hadn’t forgotten. It was naive for Harry to think so. Slowly, he nodded.</p><p>He ducked his head back into the fireplace, painfully aware of his position on his hands and knees. It was temptation personified for Tom, easy access for anything he wanted to do to Harry.</p><p>“Where were we?” He asked. Behind him, Tom rubbed at the rim of his asshole, his dry thumb pushing, pulling, nudging its way inside to spread him open. Harry’s toes curled and he forced a smile up at the man.</p><p>“Ah yes, practice,” Frisby continued, smiling back eagerly. “You’re familiar with most of the other players, or so I heard. It won’t be much of a problem for you to mesh with them.”</p><p>“Oh?” Harry said, pleased. Tom pulled his thumb away, and his fingers came back slick. Two of them pressed inside Harry then without preamble and Harry jolted, making a soft noise of surprise at the sudden stretch. Frisby’s eyebrows raised.</p><p>“My cat,” Harry stuttered. Tom paused at that and then slapped him solidly on the ass. Harry flinched, hips jolting away. “<em> Bad </em> cat. My very bad cat.”</p><p>“Yes…” Frisby said slowly. He eyed Harry in suspicion but quickly brushed it off, shaking his head with a smile. “We have Ginny Weasley for one of the Chasers and Oliver Wood as Keeper.”</p><p>“That’s wond—”</p><p>Tom rubbed at his prostate, and Harry’s voice cracked mid-speech. His face heated up even as he spread his legs further apart and lowered his ass to bear down on Tom’s fingers inside of him. He cleared his throat.</p><p>“That’s wonderful,” he said evenly as Tom thrust his fingers inside, stretching him open. His face twitched. “I assume that I can’t play for Puddlemere anymore?”</p><p>“Oh no, you’ll have to attend practice. We’re really hoping to win this Cup.”</p><p>Tom pulled out his fingers and Harry relaxed. Maybe Tom was done playing with him. Maybe, for once, Tom would be nice to him.</p><p>“When do practices begin?” He asked. Then—the blunt head of Tom’s cock pressed against him and Harry froze. He paled. Tom couldn’t possibly, actually be planning to fuck him.</p><p>“You can sign the contract this Friday, and we’ll begin the Monday after,” Frisby told him, and Harry nodded, even as his attention was caught on Tom’s dick. He squirmed, pulling away, but Tom’s hands on hips were firm and unyielding.</p><p>Tom pushed in, his length and thickness spreading Harry open. Harry’s lips parted, his eyebrows drawing together. A moan threatened to bubble out of his chest but Harry kept it locked in out of sheer force of will, his gaze dropping helplessly to Frisby’s shoes.</p><p>“I, uh,” he said, breathless, his jaw tight.  “I already said that I’d be honored to play but—”</p><p>Tom pulled out and then fucked into him hard, the head of his cock brushing against Harry’s prostate. Harry cried out and instantly clamped his mouth shut, his whole neck and chest hot now too with shame as he tried to keep in the rest of his moans. His hands tightened on the carpet, his shoulders tightening, and Tom smoothed a hand down his back in comfort, rucking up Harry’s shirt.</p><p>“Mr. Potter?”</p><p>“Sorry, the cat!” Harry squeaked, voice high. He licked his lips, and laughed nervously. Tom took mercy in him and changed the pace of his thrusts, slower now but <em> deep </em>, nudging ever so often against that spot inside Harry. “I was saying I’d be honored to play but I have to confirm with my partner.”</p><p>“Of course, do give my regards to Mr Riddle,” Frisby replied, smiling again.</p><p>“Is there—uh—” Harry’s breath caught as Tom reached down and stroked his cock, the twist of his hand sending Harry’s jaw dropping. He squeezed his eyes shut and whimpered. He looked back up at Frisby, sweating slightly. “Is there anything else?”</p><p>“No, that’s it for now, Mr Potter.”</p><p>“Okay, thank you!” Harry rushed out before he pulled his head out and ended the fire call.</p><p>“You utter arse!” Harry hissed, pushing Tom off him. His hole was left empty, aching, and Harry quickly tackled Tom to the floor, landing on his lap. Tom grinned up at him, his hands big and warm on Harry’s waist, spanning across the width of it.</p><p>“Anytime, you said,” Tom reminded him smugly, and Harry scowled. He reached down underneath him and lined up Tom’s cock to his hole. He sank down and both of them moaned. Tom’s grip tightened around his waist.</p><p>Harry didn’t bother keeping quiet anymore, his groans echoing loudly in their living room as he rode Tom’s dick. His thighs strained with his frantic motions, his cock bobbing, red and leaking clear fluid. Harry threw his head back and cried out, every hit of the head of Tom’s cock on his prostate sending pleasure down his spine.</p><p>Tom was merciless now, his hips meeting Harry’s with every thrust. The sounds of their skin slapping against each other echoed in their living room, obscene, and Harry’s moans joined it. He grinded down against Tom, his fingers digging into the front Tom’s shirt, nails leaving lines at the exposed skin of Tom’s neck and collarbones.</p><p>All of the pent-up noises of pleasure from earlier were released, Harry almost sobbing now at how thick, how deep Tom was inside of him. He fucked himself onto Tom’s cock, frantic now as he felt himself reach the edge, little <em> ah ah ah </em>’s escaping him with every thrust.</p><p>Tom wrapped his hand around around Harry’s cock, his gaze heavy and dark. Harry looked into his eyes, his lips parting at the intense burgundy. It only took one, two strokes before Harry was groaning, his hips jerking as he finished all over Tom’s hand.</p><p>Tom quickly sat up and the change of angle made Harry cry out, his fingers digging into Tom’s shoulder. Tom smirked at him. He wrapped his arm around Harry’s waist and leaned in, pressing their lips together in an open-mouthed kiss, hot and wet. Tom’s teeth nipped and pulled at Harry’s bottom lip, Harry’s soft moans muffled into it.</p><p>Tom continued to fuck into him, uncaring of Harry’s pleasure now and only seeking his own. His pace was erratic, his eyebrows scrunched as a low groan escaped him. Harry shuddered at the sound and clenched around Tom’s cock in his ass, breathless in pleasure.</p><p>Tom buried his face in Harry’s neck, panting, and it only took a few more thrusts before Tom finished inside him, wetness and warmth filling Harry. Harry let out a weak moan, trembling at the feel of it inside him, shifting on Tom’s lap. He was boneless now, his body dependent on Tom’s to hold him up. Only Tom’s arm around his waist anchored him, and Harry relaxed into it.</p><p>They panted in the silence, both of them just breathing each other in. Harry closed his eyes, smiling, and tilted his head to press a fond kiss to Tom’s lips.</p><p>“Merlin, I hate you,” he murmured into Tom’s mouth. Tom chuckled and pulled away, pressing his lips to Harry’s neck. He nipped at the skin there, kissing and sucking, laving his tongue over the forming bruises that Harry would have to wear tomorrow.</p><p>“I love you too,” Tom murmured into his neck. They exchanged more kisses, lazy now, a gentle slide of lips and tongue. Harry sighed blissfully, nuzzling into the side of Tom’s face. A nap would be perfect right now.</p><p>“You should take it,” Tom said, pulling back. It took a moment for Harry’s brain to parse through before he remembered that he had been invited to play for the Quidditch World Cup team. “You’ll do wonderful. Maybe the English team will actually make it to the tournament proper for once.”</p><p>“I’ll have to travel a lot,” Harry warned, a little hesitant, and Tom nodded easily.</p><p>“Exactly. We’ll have a larger reach. You can get a feel for where the rest of Europe will lean in terms of the new changes in Britain.”</p><p>Harry bit the inside of his cheek and rose up, grimacing at the feel of Tom’s come leaking out of him. Tom was right. So far, they only really had ties with the Scandinavians and the French by virtue of Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. They needed more allies and followers in the other European countries.</p><p>They cleaned up quietly, trading tender touches every now and then. Harry’s mind was off dwelling in the pros and cons. He did honestly want to play Quidditch for England though. He looked up at Tom as he pulled up his trousers, buttoning them.</p><p>“More countries to spread propaganda to?” Harry joked, and Tom frowned at him.</p><p>“The word—”</p><p>“<em>Propaganda </em> has negative connotations—yes you’ve said that a million times.” Harry rolled his eyes. “Spread the <em> truth</em>, then.”</p><p>“Glad you agree with me,” Tom said lightly. His dark eyes said more, holding a threat there that Harry was intimately aware of. Tom was glad Harry agreed because then Harry wouldn’t need to be…corrected.</p><p>“Do you want me to look for potential followers?” Harry asked quietly, shaking his legs. He winced at the sensation of the beginnings of rug burn on his knees and the ache in ass. His thighs were sore as well, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to regret it in the wake of what was objectively a fantastic shag.</p><p>“Of course. Let me know personally if they’re Death Eater potential,” Tom said smoothly. He tipped his head down for another kiss, tender and sweet, and then pulled away to smile down at Harry. He reached up to thumb at the bruise already forming at Harry’s jaw, smirking smugly.</p><p>“Heal it,” Harry said, his bottom lip jutting out, and Tom hummed in amusement.</p><p>“No, I’d rather not.”</p><p>He paused, and tilted his head, running his knuckles down Harry’s cheek. “If you really want me to stop, just say so. You know I’m going to take full advantage of it.”</p><p>Harry hesitated. He licked his lips and thought back on what had just transpired. It was humiliating to have to keep in his moans while talking to Frisby—to know that just behind him Tom was fucking him open and yet…</p><p>Harry couldn't deny that it was hot too. Just the memory of it was enough to make his dick twitch valianty.</p><p>“It’s fine,” Harry said, shaking his head. “I trust you. I’m yours, remember?”</p><p>Tom smiled.</p><p>“Yes, yes you are.”</p>
