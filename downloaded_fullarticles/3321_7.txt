    <p>The sun was slowly setting, although it was hardly visible in the grey sky.  Rain had been incessantly beating down for the entire day. Once night fell, the forest would grow even chillier, with wind and darkness winding through the wet trees.  Amidst these trees was a small, ramshackle cabin, miles away from human civilization.</p><p>Here, within the aged wooden walls, was where Remus Lupin dwelled. The man was currently pacing his bedroom.  He had been anxious for an entire day and a half, ever since he received Dumbledore’s owl - <em> Sirius will be staying with you for the time being.  Keep an eye out. </em></p><p>Sirius Black - one of Remus’s first friends.  His first crush. His first love. And on that terrible night, his third loss, right behind Lily and James.  </p><p>Thinking about him grew quickly overwhelming in too many ways.  Too many feelings of love, betrayal, grief, unearthed after years of numbing separation.  Remus eventually sighed and collapsed onto his bed, the rusty springs squeaking from his weight.  Outside, as the evening grew dark, the wind was growing more fierce, the rain pattering louder. A large gust of wind shook the cabin, and the walls groaned.  There was a loud creaking sound, which he guessed to be the wind.</p><p>Remus resolved to make himself a cup of tea; after all, in this weather, it might be a while more before Sirius makes it.  No use in just waiting around. He pushed himself off the bed and headed to the small kitchen. Rubbing his eyes wearily, Remus failed to take notice of the tall man with long black hair leaning against the wall.  Walking to the stove, Remus began to pour himself a cup of tea.</p><p>“Pleasure seeing you too, Moony.”</p><p>The teapot crashed to the floor as Remus let out an audible gasp.  Whipping around, he saw, for the first time in a year, the human form of Sirius Black.  Drenched from the rain, Sirius was as tall and imposing as ever, grey eyes glittering on his gaunt face.  The corner of Sirius’s mouth quirked into a smile at Remus’s fumblings.</p><p>With a trembling hand, Remus repaired the broken teapot and said, as evenly as he could,</p><p>“When did you get here, Sirius?  You alarmed me.” How like Sirius it was to barge into Remus’s life without warning.</p><p>“Not a minute ago,” Sirius replied.  “I was going to knock, but your lock is broken.”</p><p>
  <em> So that’s where the creaking sound came from. </em>
</p><p>“Is it?  I’ll see to it later.  Sit down, please, you must be exhausted,” Remus said, motioning to the kitchen table.  As he tried to play the gracious host, pouring tea and reheating stew with his wand, Remus’s mind was racing.  <em> He was alone with the man he had loved since they were teenagers, it had been fourteen years- </em></p><p>“How’s Harry?” Remus asked, trying to start conversation.</p><p>“Harry?  Not great after his ordeal,” said Sirius, running a hand through his hair.  “That Crouch bloke didn’t help matters, either.” As Remus set down bread, bowls of stew, and cups of tea onto the table, Sirius recounted the madness that was the final Triwizard challenge.  Remus had known, of course, of Voldemort’s return, ever since receiving notice for the Order - however, hearing Harry’s first-hand experience of it made Remus feel a dread he hadn’t felt since the first war.  </p><p>“So, what do we do know?” asked Remus, who was now seated across the table.</p><p>“Wait till further notice from Dumbledore, I guess,” said Sirius, chewing on a piece of bread.</p><p>They ate in silence for a few minutes.  Remus stared worriedly at Sirius, at his matted hair, his lean frame.  </p><p>“And how have you been?” Remus asked.  “You know, er, being on the run and such.”</p><p>Sirius barked a laugh.</p><p>“It varies.  Foodwise, it goes from tropical fish to rats.  Once, this family took me in as their stray for a while.  But it got a bit better later in Hogsmeade, once Harry started sending me food packages-”</p><p>“You were in <em> Hogsmeade </em>?” Remus exclaimed.</p><p>“Yes, to look after Harry.  Someone was obviously out to get him-”</p><p>“Sirius, do you have any idea how risky that is?  What if you got caught?”</p><p>“Well, I didn’t, did I?” Sirius said, eyes challenging.  Remus pursed his lips, but didn’t comment further. Sirius was just as reckless as he remembered.  Remus tried not to think about the fact that it was that fearlessness, that bravery, that had made him so attracted to Sirius in the first place all those years ago.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-----------------</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Night soon fell, with stars adorning the lonely black sky.  The rain had abated, leaving behind a silent, dripping forest.  Having just taken a shower, Remus towels off his wet hair, putting on a soft, threadbare sweater and pants.   After changing, he padded around the cottage, looking for Sirius.</p><p>Remus found Sirius not within the cottage, but on the porch in the back of the house, drinking the large bottle of Firewhisky that had been in the back of Remus’s fridge, while gazing out at the lonely wilderness.  Remus opened the door and cleared his throat.</p><p>“Enjoying the view?”</p><p>Sirius turned around, grinned, and motioned Remus to join him.  He was wearing Remus’s old clothes, having changed out of his filthy Azkaban robes after showering.  The sight of it makes Remus’s stomach twist with pleasure. Despite the years of Azkaban and life on the run, Sirius never truly shed his good looks.  He still had those piercing eyes and high cheekbones that had enamored Remus for years. Remus tried not to focus on that thought. As Remus sat beside him, he noticed that Sirius had already drank a good amount of Firewhisky.  </p><p>The two sat in silence for a while, taking turns sipping Firewhisky.  After several minutes, each lost in their own thoughts, Sirius asked,</p><p>“How long have you lived in this place?”</p><p>“About a year.  Ever since, well, teaching at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yeah.  Can’t stay in one place too long, you know, with my condition.”</p><p>“You never settled down?”</p><p>“Not really, no.”</p><p>Sirius raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“No boyfriend, girlfriend, nobody you wanted to settle with?”</p><p>Remus’s laugh was bitter.</p><p>“Yes, because it’s every witch and wizard’s dream to be the partner of a poverty-stricken werewolf.  Besides, I don’t want to risk it.”</p><p>Sirius snorts.</p><p>“You’ve always been too selfless for your own good, Remus.”</p><p>Another long silence followed.  Somewhere in the distance, a dove softly cooed.  Crickets chirped and bugs hummed from the woods. Water dripped from tree leaves like silent tears, plopping onto the fragile roof above them.  This time, the silence between them is heavier. The weight of unspoken memories them grows stronger between them, and finally, Remus breaks the silence.</p><p>“Sirius.  I know that I said this last year at the Shack, but I really am sorry for assuming you betrayed Lily and James.  For all these years.” Remus bit his lip. “Even before the night they were killed.”</p><p>Sirius turned to face him, smile grim.</p><p>“Well, you don’t have much to apologize for, seeing as I suspected you just as much.”</p><p>Those were some of the many memories Remus didn’t like to think about.  Of the two of them in Sirius’s flat, a flat once filled with breathless happiness that soon grew to be filled with suspicion and mistrust.  A flat of questions and terse responses, of growing coldness and empty kisses, as Remus began to face the dreadful prospect that the boy that he loved and had worshipped for almost half his life was possibly a traitor to them all.</p><p>Now, as they sat under the stars, with thoughts growing more hazy, Remus wondered if he had ever stopped loving Sirius at all.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>--------------</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It happened because of the Firewhisky.</p><p>It happened because of Firewhisky mixed with years of melancholy.</p><p>They had sat outside for hours, talking more as the bottle grew emptier.  Finally, when Sirius, who had drank more, began to slur his words slightly, Remus decided it was time to head inside.  Helping Sirius up, he let Sirius lean on him, ignoring the way the warmth and proximity made Remus’s tipsy head spin.</p><p>They had made it through the doorway when Sirius turned his body to face Remus, crowding him against the closed door.  Both of Sirius’s hands were holding Remus’s shoulders, and they were so close their noses were nearly touching. Sirius’s warmth was everywhere.  Remus felt his brain short circuit - his heart started racing in a way it hadn’t in fourteen years, and he was suddenly aware of how intense Sirius’s gaze was.  </p><p>“I really, really missed you, Remus.”</p><p>Sirius’s breath smelled like Firewhisky and familiarity, and Remus felt his self control begin to slip.  Inhaling and hating himself so, so much, Remus mustered a whisper,</p><p>“You should go to bed, Sirius.”</p><p>Then using the last of his control, Remus gave Sirius a small push away before slipping past him.  He begins to walk to his bedroom, telling his disappointed, aroused body that the situation would have been disastrous - pleasurable, but disastrous.</p><p>He had made it halfway before Sirius- impulsive, fearless, Sirius - grabbed him.  Pinning Remus against the wall and taking his face in his hands, Sirius kissed Remus with a desperate ferocity.</p><p>And Remus, who had been so lonely and so longing, kissed him back just as eagerly, his head spinning and blood racing from the feel of Sirius’s warm lips on his.</p><p>The kiss was hungry and desperate, and Sirius ran his hands down Remus, gripping his hips and pulling him closer.  Sirius backed Remus against the wall, where he began to move his mouth down the werewolf’s neck. Remus was gasping, terribly aroused, hands in Sirius’s hair, as Sirius placed hot, open-mouthed kisses on his neck.  He could feel Sirius’s erection pressing against his hip.</p><p>“Remus, I missed you so much, you feel so <em> good,” </em>Sirius growled.</p><p>“Sirius,” Remus gasped.  “Sirius wait-”</p><p>In his hazy thoughts, Remus tried to remember that <em> Sirius was drunk </em>, that he wasn’t in his right mind, but that was so hard to do when the other man’s mouth was moving lower.</p><p>“<em> Sirius </em>,” Remus finally said, pushing him away.  “We- we can’t do this now.”</p><p>Sirius’s eyes were wide and his lips and cheeks were flushed.  Remus swallowed at the sight. Sirius’s hands were still on Remus’s hips.  </p><p>“Why not?” Sirius said, eyes narrowing.</p><p>“Because you’re drunk, and we can’t think straight.”</p><p>“I’m not that drunk,” Sirius said.  “I’m sober enough to know that I want this.  I wanted this for- Merlin, Remus, you have <em> no idea. </em>”</p><p>“This really isn’t a good idea, Sirius.  To start something like this.”</p><p>“Why the hell not?” Sirius said, voice rising.  “We both care for each other, and we both clearly want this.”</p><p>“It’s not that easy! It’s been fourteen years, Sirius!<em> ” </em></p><p>“What does that matter?”</p><p>“Because- do you have any idea how long it took to get over you?!  How incredibly painful it was?!”</p><p>Silence fell like an axe at those words.  The two men stared at each other. Finally, Sirius said,</p><p>“Are you over me?”</p><p>Remus choked a laugh, looking away.</p><p>“Clearly not as much as I thought.”</p><p>“Remus.” Sirius’s voice was soft.  “I know a lot has happened. And I know it’s not going to be like how it was before.  But please,” he urged. “If you give us a chance, I know we can be happy.”</p><p>“I can’t, Sirius.  Not again.”</p><p>A cold silence fell between them.</p><p>“Fine,” Sirius said.  “If that’s what you really want.”  He stalked off to the spare bedroom.  The door slammed shut.</p><p>Remus, overwhelmed by too many feelings to examine, sunk to the floor and buried his face in his hands.  He knew he did the right thing. There were too many years of mistrust, miscommunication, and unspoken barriers between them.  Reigniting what he had with Sirius meant inevitably unearthing the grief and pain from fourteen years ago that Remus had tried so, so hard to bury, to move on from.  Of years of loneliness, depression, and unaddressed anger.</p><p>Yet some part of him knew one couldn’t just overrule their own feelings.  And he knew that deep down, despite believing he was a criminal, despite burying his feelings in hate and blame, some part of him would always be in love with Sirius Black.</p>
