    <p>Christmas is lonely when you’re alone, Remus thought as he walked towards the bridge. He had lost his parents in an accident just five months ago. Less than a year before, his best mate died from cancer. In between it all his boyfriend had cheated on him after being together for two years. Following his parent’s death, he left Wales for the first time in his life and moved to London for a new job in hopes of starting over. He did like his job but it didn’t solve everything. It didn’t solve anything, really. He still felt completely empty.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time Remus had thought about killing himself. It crossed his mind multiple times but something about being alone on Christmas Eve was just too much. The thought of having to suffer Christmas Day then Boxing Day then New Year's Eve then a whole new year by himself was daunting. So, he planned to kill himself. There was a bridge across the Thames that he regularly walked across that wasn’t always busy, especially later in the night. He figured that would be a good place, it seemed peaceful enough.</p><p>Remus thought of leaving behind a note but there would be no one to read it. The people are work were nice to him but they weren’t exactly his mates. They weren’t close to him so it wasn’t as if they would care. The family left, he didn’t care for nor did they ever try to reach out to him after about a month of grieving. Remus Lupin was completely alone in the world. He believed that at least as he climbed on to the railing of the bridge.</p><p>Remus sat on the edge for a moment and took a deep breath. It should have been easy to let go but it wasn’t.</p><p>“It’s bleeding cold you know?” The voice startled him but then there was a hand gripping the back of his coat.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“The Thames right now. It’s so cold. I don’t think — I don’t think you want to go that way.” The man’s voice was soothing.</p><p>Remus wasn’t sure what to say or do. When he had got to the bridge, he hadn’t noticed anyone coming or going. He thought he was alone in the night. Remus purposely made sure he was alone for this very reason.</p><p>“Let me buy you a coffee or tea or something, please. I’m sure whatever it you’re going through is complete shite but I can’t walk away from this now that I’m here. I’m being selfish if that’s okay with you and I’m asking you to come get a something at the café down the way because if I don’t I could be able to live with myself if I didn’t at least try.”</p><p>Remus finally turned to the man who had been speaking to him this whole time. His blue eyes were wide and pleading and his expression was soft. He looked a bit like an angel with his long wavy black hair framing his pale face.</p><p>“You see, my brother killed himself and I found him. I don’t fancy walking away from this because you have someone in your life that cares about you as I cared about him — even if you think you don’t. Now I’m guilting you, so that’s shitty of me but I don’t know what else to say because you haven’t said anything since ‘what’ and if you don’t talk soon who knows what I’ll say next. I’m a rambler, mate.” The man bit his lip.</p><p>“How do you know I won’t get the coffee with you then just come back here?” Remus questioned.</p><p>“I don’t know what you’ll do after and I can’t control it.” The man shrugged. “I’m just putting in some hope that it won’t happen.”</p><p>Remus looked back to the river rushing below him. He could have just slipped out of his jacket and done it but he hated the idea of letting this man have to be witness to his death. If he wasn’t lying about his brother then, god, Remus didn’t really want to be a monster in this man’s memory. “Fine.” He said then was taken aback when the man practically pulled him back and off the railing.</p><p>“Thank you,” He sighed once both of Remus’ feet were back on the pavement. “Come on, let’s go.”</p><p>It took a few seconds for Remus to regain some kind of equilibrium. He had just almost jumped off the bridge to his death, now he was letting some stranger drag him to coffee. Remus thought nothing felt real since Alice died and everything just kept getting murkier and murkier until he couldn’t see the surface. What was happening now was just something strange to add to everything else.</p><p>“Do you want to go to the hospital?” The man softly as they began to walk.</p><p>“I — I’m not sure.” Remus shook his head.</p><p>He nodded, “That’s fine. Whatever you want. Let’s just get the coffee then we can part ways. I can at least say I tried and I hope you can’t fault me for that.”</p><p>“Your brother really killed himself?” Remus asked outright. There was no dancing around it, why would there be? This man almost saw him jump from the bridge. He saw him at his lowest moment.</p><p>“Yeah, just over a year ago now.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry.” Remus was glad he didn’t have anyone he’d leave behind like that.</p><p>“I had no idea either.” He shook his head as they got to the end of the bridge. “He was fine until he wasn’t fine any longer. I felt horrible because I never realized but I read the note he left behind and learned more about depression and sometimes people close by don’t see certain signs until it’s too late. I don’t blame myself but I always wish that I could have been more aware at the time.”</p><p>“Well, I don’t have anyone left so I guess no one’s around to even notice it.” Remus explained then bit his lip.</p><p>“No one? Really? I’m sure you must have someone.”</p><p>“Well, you noticed.”</p><p>The man shook his head, “I stopped you from jumping, it’s not like I knew you before. It’s different when you love the person who’s in this situation.”</p><p>“I’ve lost a lot of people recently and I moved not long ago to London. I don’t have many connections here.”</p><p>“I see. Who did you lose?” He asked. “Wait, can you give me a name I can call you? It doesn’t have to be your real one. You can call me Padfoot, if you want. It’s an old nickname.”</p><p>Remus was surprised but thought for a moment, “Moony, you can call me Moony.” Alice used to call him that.</p><p>“All right, Moony,” Padfoot spoke as they came to the café. It looked empty with the exception of a bloke on his laptop with earbuds in and two people working behind the counter. “Why don’t you pick a seat and I’ll buy us something then we can talk?”</p><p>Remus nodded, “Sure, er, how about a chamomile tea?”</p><p>Padfoot smiled softly before nodding and heading to the counter. Remus decided to sit on the squashy looking settee in the corner of the shop. It faced outside and Remus noticed snow was starting to fall. He took a deep breath and thought about just walking out the door. Padfoot was at the counter chatting happily with the baristas, he wouldn’t even notice if Remus just took off. Except, he couldn’t imagine the feeling the man would have if Remus did that. He was already living with the death of his brother, he must have felt like this was some divine intervention to help him deal with his own grief.</p><p>So, Remus stayed seated. He rubbed his thumb into his opposite palm, trying to find something to calm him. He was supposed to be dead by now but he was getting tea with a stranger. Okay.</p><p>“Here,” Padfoot handed him the paper cup and then sat down next to him.</p><p>“Thanks,” Remus hand the cup between his hands feeling the heat. “I lost my best mate Alice a year ago. She had cancer and left behind her husband and son.” Remus bit his lip. “We were mates since we were in nappies and then she got so ill… I …”</p><p>“It’s okay, I’m sure that’s hard to deal with,” Padfoot put his hand on Remus’ knee and gave it a squeeze. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“That’s not it, though. My parents, they died in a car accident five months ago,” Remus cleared his throat. “Drunk driver hit them one night on their way home from dinner one night. I couldn’t stay in Wales any longer because of it all, it was too much so I moved here.” He took a deep breath.</p><p>“Moony, that’s terrible. I can understand why you’re feeling this way.”</p><p>“I don’t have anyone left.”</p><p>“I’m sure you feel that way but what about Alice’s husband and son. Do you still keep in touch?”</p><p>Remus shook his head then took a sip of his tea, it burned all the way down as it was still too hot. “I didn’t want to get in the way of their grieving, I didn’t want Frank to feel like he had to worry about me.”</p><p>“I’m sure he’d still miss you if you were gone.” Padfoot said softly, his hand still on Remus’ knee. “What about here in London, have you met anyone?”</p><p>“I— well, at work there are a few people who are nice and all but we’re just acquaintances.”</p><p>“What do you do for work?” Padfoot asked him.</p><p>“I’m a writer at the Quibbler.”</p><p>Padfoot smiled, “That’s brilliant. Do you like it?”</p><p>“Yeah, I do.” Work was one thing that he did enjoy in his life right now.</p><p>“What do you like about it?”</p><p>“I love to write, it’s what I’ve always wanted to do. I get to write about interesting people now. I meet interesting people all the time.”</p><p>“That must be bloody brilliant. Who’s the last interesting person you got to meet?” Padfoot asked him, tilting his head to the side much like an interested puppy.</p><p>“There’s the elderly woman, she started a dance troupe and they performed over in the States at an American Football game. She’s nearly 90 and still so in shape and full of energy.” He wished he had half as much spark left in him as that woman. She was amazing.</p><p>“You’re crying,” Padfoot leaned forward to grab the napkins on the table in front of them.</p><p>Remus hadn’t even realized that, he was just so full of a million different emotions. It wasn’t too surprising to him. He took the offered napkin and wiped his eyes. “I just want to feel that way. Happy to be alive. I want to stop hurting but it — I don’t think that I can.”</p><p>“I know it feels that way, Moony, but… have you tried to get help? Have you gone to therapy or anything like that?”</p><p>He sniffled and shook his head.</p><p>“If you want, I know someone great. I don’t go to her anymore but I used to when I lived in the city when I was at Uni.” Padfoot explained.</p><p>“Maybe,” Remus wiped his eyes again. “Can we keep walking? I know it’s snowing but I— I feel like I need fresh air.”</p><p>“Of course, come on.” Padfoot stood up and pulled on his coat then took some napkins to shove in his pockets.</p><p>Remus followed him, he still had his coat on so walked out with his hands wrapped around his cup.</p><p>“You don’t live in the city, you said?”</p><p>Padfoot shook his head, “No, I actually live in Singapore. I inherited my family’s company after Reg— my brother died. I hate business but I’m trying to get it to be a good place. I want to sell it one day but I want to make sure it’s in good hands and on the right track. I’m in town because my best mate lives here so I always come out for the holidays.”</p><p>“After your brother killed himself, what… what was it like for you?”</p><p>“Ah, hard. I was depressed and didn’t know what to do with myself. I’m impulsive and reckless, so I’ve been working on not being that way but for a few months I sort of spiraled. Then I got some help, best thing I could have done.”</p><p>“Were you ever suicidal?”</p><p>“No, no, I wasn’t.”</p><p>Remus took a sip of his tea as they walked, not sure what to say. They didn’t say anything for a long while. Remus wasn’t even sure where they were in the city. Padfoot just took turns and led them to wherever he had in mind. Remus liked the feeling of the snow falling on his face how the cold bit his nose. It made him feel a bit more alive.</p><p>They ditched their teacups in a bin on a street corner and stood there for a moment when Padfoot smiled as his eyes fell on the store across the street.</p><p>“I used to go to that record shop all the time. I didn’t even realize we were over here.” Padfoot said, jogging across the street. Remus followed after him. “I wanted to be in a punk band growing up to properly piss my parents off.”</p><p>“It never happened?”</p><p>“No, but I did buy a motorbike. I never get to use it, though. It’s here in England at my mate’s. I plan on moving back one day so I’ll use it more then.”</p><p>“I’ve never been on a motorbike.”</p><p>“Huh, maybe when I move and it’s nicer weather, you can join me on a ride.” Padfoot suggested.</p><p>“If I’m here.” Remus muttered, staring into the shop’s window. He couldn’t see anything but his reflection in the dark. “How am I going to make it through another day then another then another?” He shook his head.</p><p>“I don’t know, really, I don’t. I don’t know you or your life or anything but I care about you now. If anything, remember I care — this random ass stranger who found you in the middle of the city. I want you to be happy and get everything you want out of life.”</p><p>“You don’t know me,” Remus began to cry again. He put his hands over his face.</p><p>“I’d love to one day. You have an interesting job, I’m sure we could talk about that all day. You also want to ride my motorbike. That’s a plus.” Padfoot said. “Can I hug you?”</p><p>Remus nodded, not moving his hands as he continued to sob. The other man wrapped his arms around Remus and pulled him against his body. Remus buried his face in the other man’s shoulder. He couldn’t remember the last time someone held him tight and told him it was going to be okay. It didn’t solve his problems. He still wanted to die but the comfort felt like something that he needed.</p><p>Hours could have passed but he knew that it wasn’t that long when Remus pulled away. “Sorry.”</p><p>“It’s all right, Moony.” Padfoot stepped back.</p><p>“I don’t know what to do next.”</p><p>“I don’t either, so let’s keep walking.”</p><p>“Okay, I can do that.” If they kept walking then he didn’t need to make any choices yet. He wasn’t ready to make any choices just yet.</p><p>So, they walked some more. The snow had stopped falling but it was still freezing. It must have been nearly midnight now. It was probably Christmas and this person was walking around London aimlessly with him. Surely he should have been with his mates but Padfoot was sticking with him. He never thought anyone would do this before. It was as if he really cared about Remus. They didn’t even know one another.</p><p>Padfoot would occasionally point out points of interests to him as they walked but Remus stayed mostly silent, trying to decide what he wanted to do next. Eventually they ended up across the street from St. Mungo’s Hospital. Remus stopped in his tracks and looked at the building.</p><p>“Moony?”</p><p>“I think I should go in there. I mean, I don’t know what else to do. I think I need the help because if I don’t get it I’m not going to make it to the New Year.” Remus shook his head.</p><p>“Do you want to make it to the New Year?”</p><p>“Sometimes.”</p><p>“Okay, let’s go.”</p><p>“You don’t have to.”</p><p>“I’ll sit with you in the waiting room, okay? Then I’ll go home. Waiting rooms are absolute shite and no one should ever wait in them alone.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Remus bit his lip.</p><p>They walked across the street and into the doors of the A&amp;E. It wasn’t too full but Remus still had to wait. He and Padfoot sat near the doors that led back behind the nurse’s station. Padfoot held on to his hand, rubbing his thumb across Remus’ knuckles.</p><p>An older woman with kind eyes came out to take Remus back. “You’ll be okay.” Padfoot said, giving him a hug. “I hope I see you again.”</p><p>“Thank you, thank you so much.”</p><p>“No worries, go ahead. One day, you can ride the motorbike.”</p><p>Remus followed the nurse back and they ended up sitting in a small room. She took all his information and details down. Then she started to ask him questions that Remus didn’t want to answer out loud. She said they were to assess his risk and he knew where he was going to end up on whatever chart she was using.</p><p>“Why are you thinking about suicide, Mister Lupin?” She asked after flipping the paper on her clipboard over.</p><p>“It just — I don’t have anything left. I can’t go on any longer. It just doesn’t make any sense to.”</p><p>“Did you have any specific plans?”</p><p>“I was going to jump off a bridge but someone stopped me.” He said and the nurse looked at him in surprise then noted it on the paper in front of her. “If I went home then I think I’d hang myself. That’s something that, ah, I keep thinking about.”</p><p>“What are some options for coping beside suicide?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Remus looked down at his hands.</p><p>“And have you felt this way before?”</p><p>Remus nodded.</p><p>“How did you avoid it?”</p><p>“I just, I just pushed on. I don’t know, really. I just kept trying but I can’t anymore, it’s too much.”</p><p>“Are you depressed or have you been until recently?”</p><p>“Yes, for over a year now, it’s just gotten worse since they passed and I moved here…” He had already explained his major life events earlier.</p><p>“I didn’t take many of my things when I moved to London. Uh, I don’t really have much here.”</p><p>“Is there an anniversary of a loss or any other significant date approaching?”</p><p>“It’s Christmas.” Remus answered simply.</p><p>“Have you been avoiding or withdrawing from others?”</p><p>“I don’t have mates here and I don’t talk to anyone from back home.”</p><p>“Have you recently made a will or other arrangements for your death?”</p><p>“No, I was hoping they just wouldn’t find my body.” Remus picked at his cuticles.</p><p>“Have you… have you recently experienced any significant losses?” She asked, already knowing the answer because they had talked about it before but it was on the sheet so she had to ask it.</p><p>“My parents and my best mate within the last year.”</p><p>“Are you terminally or chronically ill?”</p><p>Remus shook his head, “No.”</p><p>“Are you currently under the influence of alcohol or other substances?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Do you use alcohol and/or other substances on a frequent basis?”</p><p>“Not really, no. I drink but not a lot. I don’t think at least.”</p><p>“Have you ever been told that you take too many risks or are impulsive?”</p><p>“No, rather the opposite.” Remus snickered.</p><p>The nurse made a few more notes on the paper then looked at him softly before calmly saying, “Remus, we’re going to get you the help you need.”</p><p>He let out a long breath, feeling as if there was some weight lifted off of his shoulders.</p>
