    <p>She was wrong. Garrison was quite angry. Even after she told him that he’d given her the spell to get through the wards for the guest house he’d read her the riot act, reminding her how dangerous it was to go anywhere without her wand, to let herself be so easily disarmed, or to agree to anything that a Malfoy proposed.</p>
<p>“I understand that you two have something of a…<em>history,” </em>Garrison said, lowering his voice to indicate jus how scandalous it all was. “But if you’re going to just start up and disappearing every time you want a good shag, we’re going to have to replace you on the team.”</p>
<p>She was scolded for slapping him and they were no longer on speaking terms although she was still a part of the team.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Information about Voldemort’s Order was slow moving through the pipeline and Hermione became anxious. It wasn’t just that she wanted the mission to be over, that she wanted the house in Wiltshire to be cleared out. It was also the promise she’d made to Malfoy in Hawaii. He’d left everything in her hands. If she wanted him again, if she wanted to see him, to talk to him, to kiss him…feel his tongue stroking against her…if she wanted any of that she would have to find him. He promised her that he wouldn’t track her down anymore, going so far as to remove the tracking glamour he’d put on her neck in Monte Carlo. But beyond that he hadn’t given her the slightest clue and she wondered if it meant that he didn’t want her to find him at all. Was this just another form of the torture he loved to inflict? Had his time with her all been a joke, using her and then disappearing into the wind? She didn’t want to believe it…but it was Draco Malfoy they were talking about. She couldn’t put anything past him.</p>
<p>Still, every knock on her door, every owl she received, every movement out of the corner of her eye she wondered if it was him; if he’d changed his mind and couldn’t stay away. Her eyes tracked every blonde that walked past. She scanned every man who flirted with her to see if it was Draco hidden beneath some disillusionment and every time her heart sank with the knowledge that it wasn’t him. What did it mean? Why was she so heartbroken without him? All they’d had was sex; delicious, mind blowing, leg shaking sex that no one else could possibly live up to. Not that she was interested.</p>
<p>There were other men, men in the Order, men at the Ministry, drunk men at the Leaky, all of them propositioning her at one time or another…offering to soothe her sorrow at losing Harry and Ron or wanting to “pick her brain” about civil rights for magical creatures. She went out with some of them, accepted their dinner invitations and even invited them back to her flat. But every time, she knew within seconds that she wasn’t going to bed with them. Their kisses did nothing for her. Their touch on her skin was dull, meaningless. They were soft and polite and romantic and treated her like a delicate queen and it bored her to tears. A man would pull her into his arms and she’d think back to Draco putting her on her knees, calling her a cock slut, stroking her lip with his thumb. A man would kiss her and she’d think back to Draco refusing the same, holding back his kisses until she nearly went mad with need, clawing at his back, silently begging for his mouth. Draco knew exactly what she needed, and he knew she was strong enough to take it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She was sitting at her desk within Grimmauld Place when Fordham knocked on the door. </p>
<p>“There’s going to be a meeting in Wiltshire. Not everyone, but some of the higher ups,” he said, not walking all the way into the room. Things were tense between all the team members. </p>
<p>“When do we leave?” She asked, pushing back her chair, feeling the adrenaline start to course through her veins. </p>
<p>“Three nights from now. You, me and…Garrison.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” she said, getting up from her desk, relieved it was about to be over. She'd ask for a transfer to another team and be done with Garrison for good.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione, Garrison and Fordham snuck into the guest house at the Manor. It was nearly midnight and they could see the telltale Morsmordre quivering in the sky over the darkened mansion, billowing black smoke streaking from the horizon, signaling the incoming Death Eaters.</p>
<p>“How many?” Hermione asked as Fordham cast a heat and pulse charm from his wand…three…four... </p>
<p>“I’m detecting five. Not a huge meeting,” Fordham said. “Wait. Six. There’s someone else at the far end, a different cluster. Like its not part of the meeting.”</p>
<p>“Could be a house elf, or a maid,” Hermione suggested.</p>
<p>“Or a hostage,” Garrison said. “We’ll surprise the five that are together.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The path to the Manor hadn’t been used for years according to Draco. He told Hermione that it was actually called the Mistress Passage – a convenient way for the Lord of the Manor to pay a friendly visit to whomever was staying in the guest house. Now it was a musty damp tunnel, filled with cobwebs and swooping bats. Garrison and Fordham had been skeptical that it would work, doubting Draco’s intel, but it did indeed open into a small, dark parlor inside the main house.</p>
<p>The three of them stood silently, listening to the hushed conversation, closer than they thought it would be. The Death Eaters were going to London on September 1<sup>st</sup>, an attack on King’s Cross when everyone was headed back to school. This was the state of the war…even children were fair game. After they’d listened in long enough to cement the plans, the team exchanged silent signals and planned their attack.</p>
<p>Hermione was surprised at how easily the they were captured. There were no big names present of course...that intel had been incorrect. These were just low ranking foot soldiers who had probably been sent in as a sacrifice or they lived at the Manor. Fordham secured them all in wizard cuffs after they’d been stunned and they prepared to disapparate to Grimmauld Place when Garrison called out </p>
<p>“Wait! What about the sixth? The hostage?” </p>
<p>“I’ll go,” Hermione said, “where are they?”</p>
<p>Fordham cast the charm again and they saw one slow, even heartbeat coming from upstairs, not the dungeons, and not what they would have expected from a hostage.</p>
<p>“Could be a trap,” Garrison whispered as they conferred out of range of the restrained Death Eaters huddled in the corner.</p>
<p>“Well they can’t trap me if I sneak up on them, can they?” Hermione smiled and made her way to the front foyer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her footsteps were the only sound as she made her way up the wide staircase. The second floor of the manor was far less formal than the first. There were more paintings and knick knacks, more shining silver candle sconces, jewel toned carpets running the length of the wide corridors. She walked with her wand out, a whispered Lumos lighting the floor a few feet ahead of her. Somewhere down the hallway she heard music – Chopin if she wasn’t mistaken. Reaching the end of the corridor she saw light spilling out onto the floor from a room off to the left. She extinguished her wand and crept closer, staying close to the wall.</p>
<p>The door was only half open, low warm light from a fireplace glowing and flickering on the walls. Taking a deep breath she held out her wand and entered the room.</p>
<p>“I’m glad it’s you and not that crusty old git you were trying to shag.”</p>
<p>And there he was, sitting at a grand piano in a bedroom suite nearly the size of her entire flat. He was barefoot, wearing a pair of dark wash jeans and a gray t-shirt that fit him like a second skin.</p>
<p>“Draco…” she whispered, still holding out her wand, even though her hand was shaking.</p>
<p>He stopped playing the Chopin and stood, pulling his lit cigarette from the crystal ashtray on top of the piano and taking one last drag before crushing it out.</p>
<p>“No kiss?” He asked, walking close enough that her wand touched his chest and with one finger on the tip, he pushed it off to the side.</p>
<p>Hermione grabbed a fistful of his t-shirt and pulled him against her, kissing him before he could make another smart remark. He plucked the wand from her hand and threw it over his shoulder, walking her backwards across the room until she was at the foot of the massive four poster bed, his mouth laying a trail of kisses down her throat, his hands roaming up beneath her shirt, over her ribs, the pad of his thumb brushing over the underside of her breast.</p>
<p>“That’s more like it my sweet little kitten,” he murmured, pushing her jacket off her shoulders, working his leg up between hers until she gasped.</p>
<p>“Wait!” She pushed him away, wiping her wet mouth off on the back of her hand, struggling to catch her breath.</p>
<p>He smiled at her with a little bit of incredulous pity, his eyebrow arched high as he hooked his finger into the waistband of her jeans, pulling her forward, licking at the shell of her ear.</p>
<p>“You don’t want me to wait,” he said, “Not really.” </p>
<p>“Draco, I’m not here alone. Garrison, Fordham…”</p>
<p>“Have what they came for, darling. Unless you plan on turning me in.” He searched her face with genuine concern and added, “unless you plan on going back on your promise.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She’d given her word four months ago that if she ever found Draco again she would go with him wherever he lead. She agreed she would stay with him for three days. And no, she had no intention of breaking it, because it was a promise she thought about every day, every long, lonely night as she wondered where he could have gone, where she was supposed to find him.</p>
<p>“How long have you been here?” she asked, stepping away from the temptation of his perfect mouth.</p>
<p>He sighed and turned to sit on the edge of the bed, confident that she was not going to give up on “having a conversation” before he could get in her pants.</p>
<p>“Not long. I’ve been following the Death Eaters just like you have and I knew when those dimwits would be here. I snuck in the same way you did and hid up here in my old wing,” he said, running his fingers over the dark wood of the bed frame.</p>
<p>He’d imagined bedding her here for months, laying her down in the silken linens, smelling the sweet scent of her hair, hearing her moan his name when he made her come. He’d imagined waking up with her in the Manor, making her breakfast, showing her the library, the art, playing the piano for her. He knew she hadn’t been here since the incident with Bellatrix. He knew that walking inside the walls of this place was like entering the gates of hell and he wanted to change that. He wanted her to see what it looked like in the sunshine, when the drapes were open, when there was music. He needed her to see the light inside it’s darkened walls, although he wasn’t sure why.</p>
<p>Now that she was there though, standing in front of him; now that he’d felt the way she’d kissed him, pulling him in with such ferocity that he’d nearly laughed, he wanted to take her away so that the only focus was her. He wanted to show her what relief there was in hiding from all this, pretending it wasn’t happening, to get drunk and watch the sun rise. They could run away. She could stop being Granger. He could stop being Malfoy. It didn’t matter where they went, he just needed to be with her.</p>
<p>“I suppose if you hadn’t shown up they would have…” he didn’t get a chance to finish his sentence as the door was kicked open all the way, Garrison and Fordham standing there with their wands at the ready.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was not lost on Draco that Hermione stepped closer to him than to her colleagues.</p>
<p>“Fucking Malfoy,” Fordham spat. “First we’re looking for you then we can’t seem to get rid of you.”</p>
<p>“I like to keep things exciting,” Draco drawled, leaning against the foot of the bed, not concerned in the least with their aggressive attitude. He could tell just by looking at them that they had no fluency in wandless magic and they were far more concerned with posturing than securing him.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you cuff him? Stun him?” Garrison asked Hermione, his voice calm but laced with disappointment, like a parent upset with her choices. “He’s a wanted man.” </p>
<p>“He was wanted for information and he gave it to us,” she said. “I told him…” </p>
<p>“What, that you’d suck his cock again the minute we got in the door?” Fordham laughed but was on the floor stupefied before he could say another word.</p>
<p>Hermione turned and saw Draco, his hand extended in front of him, eyes fiery with rage. He was not out of practice.</p>
<p>“Apologize to her,” he said, walking to stand over Fordham’s groaning form.</p>
<p>“I don’t take orders from Death Eaters.”</p>
<p>Draco stupefied him again without his wand, a bright blue light exploding from his palm, rendering Fordham completely unconscious.</p>
<p>“Stop,” Hermione said, touching his arm. “The more you do, the more they’ll have on you.”</p>
<p>“Make your choice, Granger,” Garrison said, lifting his wand, aiming it at Draco. “But just know that if you don’t turn Malfoy in, I’m reporting you to the Ministry.”</p>
<p>“I made a deal,” she said. “He gave me the info and I told him we would let him go.”</p>
<p>“And here I was thinking that following your dick was a uniquely male experience,” Garrison snorted. </p>
<p>Draco lunged forward but Hermione grabbed his elbow, pulling him tight against her body and with a deep, inward pressure and a loud crack, both of them were gone.</p>
<p> </p>
