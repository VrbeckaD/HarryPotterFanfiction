    <p>Harriet Rose Potter became Tsunayoshi Sawada, or rather Sawada Tsunayoshi as she was in Japan this time… </p><p>And she was a boy. She may have miscalculated a bit somewhere, she had not meant to be a boy nor starting out as a squealing new-born. Also, no one is meant to remember that shit, it is horrifying. New-borns may not have the best senses, but she managed to get the gist…</p><p>Death has no language. They understand all and everything. All living things go through dying, so it would make sense that They understood all that was being hurled at them when the dead realised what was happening.</p><p>As Their companion she has the same ability, so she quickly gained the knowledge that she has reincarnated as a boy. Male. With something between her legs.</p><p>She freaked for a day or so, but quickly became interested in learning this part of life as well. Another side to a story, though she would have preferred if she had done so intentionally in the first place. </p><p>Oh well, she became a he, though they would always be more feminine than, some narrow-minded, people would have liked.</p><p>Harriet knew she would never be fully male, but non-binary? That she could do, she didn’t want to confuse herself or her new mother, but frankly this was the best she or they could do. It’s after all their identity, not everyone else’s.</p><p>Though Death did have a laugh over their new pronouns, They accepted it immediately. Death was non-binary as well, after all, They didn’t conform to one gender after all.</p><p>Nana, their new lovely amazing mother, was the best thing so far in their rather short life. Tsu-kun, as she lovingly called them, was incredibly joyful that she was their mother.</p><p>They couldn’t have picked a better mother themselves.</p><p>Tsu-kun would be the best child to her ever! That they promised after only a month in their new life, so they upped the cuteness factor even more!<br/>
So, if the neighbourhood heard squealing joy from their mother often, well that was their problem.</p><p>…</p><p>The first two years were quite boring, trying to regain lost mobility and strength was a chore. </p><p>Nana couldn’t help but noticed her Tsu-kun was quite the smart boy, and if she expressed that often to the other mothers, well. She was proud.</p><p>Her little boy was the cutest thing in the world, a thing that became universally accepted in little Namimori. There was just something about him, lighting up everything no matter where he went. His big doe eyes were truly deadly, more than half of the population over 10 years old had fallen to them.</p><p>They others just haven’t seen him yet.</p><p>So Tsuna became known quickly as the cute little boy around town. Trying to waddle around, holding his mother’s hand and cooing over something.<br/>
Always happy, that little one.</p><p>Of course, Tsu-kun was not happy all the time, but for the most part, they were. Nana was still amazing, and nobody could convince them otherwise. Brilliant woman, truly a goddess in the kitchen and where all their good looks came from it seemed.</p><p>However.</p><p>Tsu-kun had yet to see their father more than three times all their new life. Which would have already been bad, had they only been one month old, but at almost two years old? </p><p>Oh hell no.</p><p>Tsunayoshi did not like him. At all.</p><p>The man was the source of brief happiness from Nana, but soon left her crying quietly in her bed. She tried, she tried so hard not to let Tsuna see it. Clinging to her little sunshine, her hope, she faced the morning each day and made it a good day.</p><p>Nana would have nothing else for her child.</p><p>Tsu-kun should not feel sad as she did every day. And when she looked at him, she let go off that sadness to give her everything to Tsuna. She did feel happier when together with her Tsu-kun.</p><p>Of course, Tsuna noticed, and they were in awe of their mother. Such a strong brilliant woman, doing everything and more to be happy with her child. They increased their loving actions, said I love you and all the cutest things they could do. A little manipulating, but for a good course.</p><p>If Nana could face every day like that, then so could Tsuna.</p><p>…</p><p>Then the Flames happened.</p><p>Tsuna had been playing around and hadn’t moved fast enough to avoid falling down the edge of the table. Kid table. As in 30 cm at most.</p><p>Not their proudest moment, but it held a special place in their heart because they figured out what was going on with their new body. Tsuna had noticed in the first months that something was abnormal in their new body, not a bad thing, just weird.</p><p>Like their Magic.</p><p>Oh, they still had it of course. They couldn’t be them if they hadn’t.</p><p>So, they knew quite fast there was something more to their new body. That day was just the catalyst that sprang the blockage so to speak, Tsuna scared themselves silly at first, I mean Flames all over you?!</p><p>Scary.</p><p>Then Death popped in to check on Tsuna, They had to bend over to breathe, not that Death needed to breathe in the first place.</p><p>Apparently, they looked hilarious. All gobsmacked and small.</p><p>Death then patiently waited for Tsuna to talk to them again, Tsuna pouting as they did, before explaining what was going on. Mafia and all. Weaponizing their inner Flames. The different cores and abilities.</p><p>It took some time, but Tsu-kun understood. Understood their body was dead tired and wasn’t about to be awake anymore. They thanked Death and passed right out.</p><p>Death just looked amused at them, held their fragile new body to Their being and moved her to bed where Nana found them later.</p><p>Death came and went. </p><p>They had only come since they felt the shock, but it was time to go again. The living didn’t stop dying after all.</p><p>…</p><p>Of course, releasing their Flames had consequences, Tsuna was stared at a lot more and sought they them out more. It was as people were moths to Tsuna’s Flame.</p><p>Consumed by their brightness.</p><p>Tsuna wasn’t amused, it was fine before when they just looked at them when Tsuna was being cute. Now people sought him out and touched them???</p><p>No.</p><p>Nana was confused as well, she knew her boy was a little popular with the neighbour-hood, he was adorable after all. This, however, was unsettling.</p><p>So, she became more aware of people, always having a smile on her face while she stared them down. No touching her Tsu-kun without his permission. Death still found it amusing, though They did help Tsuna learn to control it better.</p><p>But of course, it was a little too late.</p><p>Tsuna now had a little shadow in the form of Hibari Kyoya. Very cute, and the only reason why Nana hadn’t shown her terrifying smiling face towards him. She mostly just used it on teens and older people, but Tsuna wanted to learn it as soon as possible, it was awesome.</p><p>Nana was incredible.</p><p>Harriet/Tsuna was awestruck at her. They may have been a little in love with their new mother’s abilities and personality. Really who in the world could make people so darn afraid just smiling at them???</p><p>Death was threatened by them to make them live a long and happy life, They were too busy laughing at Tsuna’s starstruck eyes when mentioning their mother. Though Death noticed Tsuna already were starting to have Nana’s terrifying smile at age 3…</p><p>Should They be afraid?</p><p>…</p><p>Soon Tsuna tired of their stalker and went over to Hibari.</p><p>Hibari may have stared at their sheer fluffiness and swore to protect them (and their fluffiness). Tsuna stared at Hibari Kyoya and felt at ease, thus began their long friendship.</p><p>Kyo-kun loved their fluffy friend, and all the great snacks they made.</p><p>Tsuna enjoyed feeding the older boy, Nana had after all promised to help them learn more cooking even if they were already good at the western styles. Now to the eastern foods, Tsuna enjoyed it a lot.</p><p>Spending time with their mother AND learning how to cook? Amazing. Also, it was nice seeing Kyo-kun enjoying their food so much. Made them feel good.</p><p>And so years went by, happy and ignorant to the fact it would be ruined by a little visit.</p><p>Death came suddenly when Tsuna had just gone to bed, interrupting their daily Magic training. Controlling their Magic was harder because they were in a child’s body, but their Magic knew they weren’t, so it was too big for them. Hence the daily training.</p><p>“Your father is coming next week.”</p><p>Tsuna just stared. What.</p><p>“Your father is coming next week.” Death stated again, just as deadpan.</p><p>Tsuna slowly put her head in her palms, groaning out “Oh my goodness, I had forgotten I even had one. Why the hell is he suddenly coming now? I’m 5 already and still haven’t seen him since I was 2.”</p><p>Death sighed and swept them into Their arms while sitting down on their bed.</p><p>“He has a small break and decided he wanted to come for that. See his little baby boy and lovely wife.”</p><p>The sheer nerve. How dare he come into their life so suddenly again. Oh, he will have hell to pay. If he thinks that they will let him off lightly after making their mother cry, making them learn to live without him?</p><p>Oh, hell no.</p><p>He would have the shock of his life if they had any say.</p><p>Death couldn’t wait to see this little show.</p><p>…</p><p>Iemitsu came home ignorant to all the changes that had happened while he was gone. Nana’s long hair, her new terrifying smile and strength. His little Tuna-fish, grown more, long hair as well. Their family dynamics, their routines.</p><p>He came blazing in, a whirlwind with him, expecting happy tears and pleased laughter.</p><p>He got no such thing.</p><p>A scream came out his beloved child at the sight of him.</p><p>When he tried laughing it off and gripping for Tsuna, his Tsuna-fishy screamed louder and ran for Nana, who had come sprinting. Not sparing a glance at her husband, Nana immediately went for Tsuna shushing him and cuddled him.</p><p>She even glared at him!</p><p>Sweet Nana, what had happened?</p><p>When Tsuna was appeased, Nana still talking slowly to him, she took him on her hip.</p><p>“This is your papa, Tsuna, though we don’t come crashing into people’s houses okay Tsu-kun?” she stated. His Tsuna shyly looked at him before looking at Nana again.</p><p>“I won’t, Mama, who’s Papa?”</p><p>Nana slumped a bit while holding him, but it couldn’t compare to the wail that came from Tsuna’s “father”.</p><p>“My Tsuna-fishy don’t even remember me anymore! Dearest, help me?!~”</p><p>Iemitsu had fallen to his knees, wailing at Nana.</p><p>Nana, though unimpressed at his behaviour in front of their child, still helped him out.</p><p>“Your Papa is your father, sweetie. He is my partner, husband and such. He is the other part of the team with Mama.” She said, looking at Tsuna.</p><p>“But… He’s not here? A team is not only one person Mama, you said that!”</p><p>“I know Tsu-kun, but he does his best to come home to us when he can.”</p><p>Nana looked more and more unhappy when explaining. Tsuna looked up at her with his big doe eyes and gave her a hug.</p><p>“Don’t be sad Mama! Tsu-kun is here!”</p><p>Nana giggled at their lovely son, having a little moment together, ignoring Iemitsu at the floor.</p><p>“Nana~ Tsuna~, don’t ignore me! I feel so lonely all by myself.” He said once again, displaying tears at their betrayal. They only looked at him for a moment before looking at each other again.</p><p>“Mama, do I have to call him Papa?”</p><p>Iemitsu’s sopping could be heard all over town.</p><p>…</p><p>Nana was mildly frosty towards her husband, she didn’t even know how to act towards him anymore. It had been 3 years after all since they last saw each other, with only sparse phone calls since. She did know Tsuna probably wouldn’t remember Iemitsu, but it still cut her deep. Her child didn’t know their own father, couldn’t even recognize him!</p><p>Nana felt like a bad parent, she tried so hard, but she was only one person. She was Tsuna’s mother, she couldn’t be his father as well. It had plagued her mind before, but when her husband suddenly came home startling Tsuna into screaming, she realised how far it had processed.</p><p>Nana almost couldn’t recognise her husband anymore, with tan skin, lighter hair and a new scar on his face. How come she didn’t know about that?</p><p>Also, what in the world was he wearing? A miner’s outfit?</p><p>How far apart had they come in recent years.</p><p>She remembered trying. Trying so hard to keep their connection when he was gone, but it slowed down to just him calling as it wouldn’t go through otherwise.</p><p>Nana was tired.</p><p>She loved her life. She loved her amazing child. Tsuna would always be first.</p><p>So, when she heard him scream, she didn’t even think. Never mind that Iemitsu came home, Tsuna would always be her priority. </p><p>She might have ignored him a little. But just a little.</p><p>He hadn’t contacted her about coming home after all, no he hadn’t even rung the last month. She really couldn’t believe herself sometimes, she should have talked to him about it more. Her fears about them and their relationship, or lack of it. She also had to talk about his behaviour, if he wanted to be with them he had to actually know them. Especially Tsu-kun, as he didn’t like being touched suddenly or suddenly noises.</p><p>If he couldn’t then she would make him.</p><p>She would talk to him about it after Tsuna was in bed. He didn’t need to hear all this mess.</p><p>Nana didn’t really want to herself, but she was a mother and grown-up now. She had to step up and make her voice heard, or it would continue down this rabbit hole.</p><p>…</p><p>Iemitsu was rather confused, when did Nana become this strong amazing woman? Her fierce, read cute, glare as she told him in no argument that this had to change. He, of course, listened to her, but he was rather occupied looking at his lovely wife.</p><p>Her long brown hair shined in the kitchen, falling to her shoulders, almost as when they had first met. Her doe eyes large along with her voice.</p><p>“- we have to change this, Iemitsu! Are you even listening right now?” she sighed at the end.</p><p>Panic went through him, “I know honey, but it is hard doing my job and being away from home as well. I love you and our little family, I want the best for us and that is why I’m doing my best to provide for us.” Iemitsu said as he took his hand through his hair.</p><p>“I’m really doing my best, honey.”</p><p>Nana looked at him, really looked at him and searched for something. Her standing shifted and became softer, she started tearing up and Iemitsu felt the slowly reclining panic rise to new levels.</p><p>“I know you are doing your best, I know. But you aren’t here, you weren’t here when Tsu-kun spoke his first words nor his first steps. You weren’t here when people started following Tsu-kun around and I had to go to the police.”</p><p>Silence filled after Nana spoke.</p><p>“I even tried contacting you so many times, Iemitsu. You never take the call, you aren’t here!” Nana croaked out, turning around to hold her hands to her eyes.</p><p>Iemitsu had never felt so low before.</p><p>He knew the situation was bad but to this extent. He wasn’t stupid, he knew that this couldn’t go on for long no matter how strong Nana was. Raising a kid alone is never easy.</p><p>He was the worst.</p><p>“I love you, I love you so much and I’m so sorry I haven’t been here with you both. I know you need me as well, and I can’t say sorry enough times. “<br/>
Iemitsu sighed and stopped for a moment, then continued.</p><p>“I still have to work as I signed the contract, but I will discuss this with my boss again. He will probably come here to discuss this with us as he is in Japan currently, and I frankly think that’s for the best. You have to understand I want to be here with you as well!”</p><p>Iemitsu had taken Nana’s hands and stepped closer towards her as if to make her believe him more.</p><p>“I can’t normally so when I finally got the call that I could visit I rushed here as fast as I could! I apologize I didn’t contact you beforehand and made such a mess of things…”</p><p>He couldn’t look into her eyes when he said the last, he knew he had made a mistake. Many actually. His child didn’t even know him! Tsuna screamed in panic because he didn’t know his own father.</p><p>How had he sunk this low in life?</p><p>This was a moment of clarity, he realized if he didn’t do something soon he might lose his family.</p><p>Timoteo had to understand, he had to.</p><p>…</p><p>Nana hadn’t completely forgiven him, Iemitsu still had to do a lot to get them both to forgive him.</p><p>But he had explained himself, told her what was going on and apologized. He was trying, he was trying to fix it and so she tried as well.</p><p>They sat in the living room, talking things through and deciding what to do next. They were sitting on the couch, closer than they had been in ages. Nana would admit it was nice, actually being with her husband.</p><p>So, they made a call to Iemitsu’s boss immediately. Arranging a meeting that evening to talk things over and letting him see their family as well. Nana thought his boss sounded nice, he was even concerned if something had happened! It already seemed better, they were doing something about the problem.</p><p>Small steps.</p><p>“Mama? Can I play with Kyo-kun?”</p><p>Tsu-kun had come done the stairs while they had talked, he looked a bit sleep-ruffled but happy.</p><p>“Hmm, we are having a guest later tonight, so perhaps here?” Nana said, leaning over to see past Iemitsu.</p><p>“Okay! Can I call him now?” Tsu-kun grinned as he already started walking over to the phone, “Of course darling.”</p><p>Iemitsu looked curious about this boy they talked about and looked to Nana about it. She had leaned back again, fondly watching their son call his friend.</p><p>“Kyo-kun is Tsu-kun’s friend, they met a year or so ago. They are always together, though Kyo-kun is somewhat possessive of Tsu-kun. I think he doesn’t have a lot of friends.” She mused to her husband, “But they have fun, Tsuna is more alive when together with him, the same with Kyo-kun.”</p><p>Iemitsu still had no idea of who he was, but he is happy that his son was brimming with excitement.</p><p>It was a sight for sore eyes, he hadn’t seen him in so long.</p><p>“-yeah, I’ll see him soon then! I’ll go see him outside! Bye, auntie!”</p><p>Tsuna was excited to see Kyo-kun, they had wanted to get away for a bit, but playing here was also okay.</p><p>Tsuna went for the door as soon as he had said goodbye, Kyoya was always incredibly fast. So, he skipped to the door took off his indoor shoes in exchange for his out-doors ones. </p><p>They were happy that Nana had bought some shoes with good soles, it was already hard keeping up with Kyoya, so all the little things helped a lot.</p><p>“Bye Mama! Oh, and Papa I guess.”</p><p>The door shut before they could say anything back to him.</p><p>…</p><p>Tsuna paused, then ignored what sounded like a wail and continued to walk to the gate.</p><p>Kyoya would be here any moment!</p><p>… But he hadn’t told him about Iemitsu coming over or who he is. Oh, this could easily be bothersome to explain. More than anything they were concerned that Kyoya would beat their… father to a pulp. It would be annoying to clean it up and explain it to their mother.</p><p>Oh well, they would take it as it comes.</p><p>Speaking of Kyoya there he is, sprinting a straight line towards them. The only reason Tsuna wasn’t run over was their reaction time, laughing as he spun around to face Kyoya and greeted him.</p><p>“Hn, why is there a herbivore staring at us from the window.”</p><p>Tsuna spun around again, looking directly into Iemitsu’s eyes. They glared at him, they knew this would be difficult, but Tsuna thought it would be Kyoya, not Iemitsu that would be the problem.</p><p>They slumped and took at hand through their fluffy hair, looking a bit dejected.</p><p>“Apparently, I have a father, I haven’t seen him in forever, so I don’t know him at all. He suddenly decided to come home and mess everything up.”</p><p>Looking more and more dejected, Kyoya started to panic a little. He didn’t want him to be sad or god forbid cry. Awkwardly standing a bit closer, he slowly started to pet his little head.</p><p>Tsuna immediately stilled, then relaxed. Kyoya knew he didn’t like to be startled but still tried his best to help, it warmed their heart. Kyoya is a good friend, if not a bit awkward.</p><p>“We have to go inside and play, Mama said I had to be here today. Someone is coming to visit later.”</p><p>He nodded and quietly followed them inside. Neither of them wanted to go in there, but Nana’s call of snacks made them hurry regardless.</p><p>…</p><p>Iemitsu was nervous, his boss was coming, and his little boy still hadn’t wanted to talk with him.</p><p>He understood that this was a delicate matter, that he had been away for too long and he may not ever be close to Tsuna again. He was also told, rather sternly, by Nana that he would have to get to know Tsuna again.</p><p>His likes and dislikes, his hobbies, interests, fears. All of them, and that she wouldn’t help much as he needed that quality time with his son. Iemitsu hadn’t even seen his son a lot since he came home, though it had only been half a day already. That didn’t lessen his desire to see his only son a bit more though. He knew intellectually that he still had some time to get to know him, but his feelings were in complete distress.</p><p>He wanted desperately to see his son, play with him, hear him laugh. Everything he could get, he wanted so badly.</p><p>But he realised that he had to be patient, first he had to deal with Timoteo Vongola.</p><p>Timoteo hadn’t expected their call at all, he thought Iemitsu would have been too lovely dovely with his wife.</p><p>So when they called he was immediately concerned and asked if something had happened.</p><p>And while he sighed in relief that nothing serious had happened, he hadn’t expected that a family crisis would have happened instead. Iemitsu explained that he needed to talk to him and invited him to come eat with them that evening. Still concerned, he agreed.</p><p>That and he would finally see the lovely Nana and Iemitsu’s little son. Getting to embarrass him would be nice, it is the privilege of the elderly. </p><p>He just had some business to do before, a meeting and then he would come to them.</p><p>Timoteo sighed again, he rarely had time anymore. There were always problems and he needed to be there to solve them. He hoped that it would soon be another’s turn, but frankly thought it would be at least another 10 years or so till that happened.</p><p>So very depressing.</p><p>…</p><p>Tsuna waved goodbye to Kyoya, their guest bound to come any minute now. They didn’t know what to expect, he knew it was Iemitsu’s boss that was coming but that still was enough to go from.</p><p>They just hoped that they would all be gone soon so that their routine could go back to normal. Tsuna knew it wouldn’t be that easy, but they could hope, right?</p><p>Damned luck of theirs.</p><p>There was also the problem with all the pronouns. </p><p>Harriet is female, she had always felt comfortable being one but hadn’t minded going on as androgynous. That was how she was raised the first many years, after all, sometimes she only had male clothes. It was easier being male when young, she wasn’t looked at as much.</p><p>And no one took a longer look at her bruises.</p><p>Boys will be boys after all, right?</p><p>So, while Harriet was fine going on as neither gender, she preferred female pronouns or they/them when in a 'male' form.</p><p>But all the talk from Iemitsu about his strong, masculine boy was taking a toll on them. Also being told that they should be more direct and manly by the older generations. That while they were adorable now, and that women loved that, they should start being more than that.</p><p>That their kindness, skill with cooking, love of life and their mother was a bit too effeminate?</p><p>That they should talk more in the masculine type of speaking, and not as cutesy. That ‘he’ was a big boy now and should think more about how he was seen by others. Tsuna, for they were Tsunayoshi at the moment, was sick of it.</p><p>They had days where they thought of themselves as female, but most of the time they thought of themselves as agender. It was less of a deal having male parts then.<br/>
And it wasn’t like Tsuna would be in a relationship with any other than Death anyway. So it didn't matter.</p><p>Sure, they had married and had kids in other lifetimes, but it was more of a go with the flow type of situation. They might love their partners, but never in the same way as Death.</p><p>Loving a friend is different.</p><p>But they digress, it was about their annoyance of continuing comments about being manly, masculine and such. Let a child be a child.</p><p>So, when Iemitsu said it again, they looked at him and said very seriously, “I don’t want to be manly, I want to be myself. I don’t want to be like you if that’s what is being manly is. I want to be with my loved ones always!”</p><p>…</p><p>The dinner went well.</p><p>Though Iemitsu was rather quiet, he still tried to talk to everyone as best he could. Nana heard what Tsuna had said, and while she agreed at some of it, it had been a blow like no other to her husband.</p><p>But she would not censor his feelings. Right now, everything was an oozing wound, and they needed to clean it before it could heal so it wouldn’t fester. By telling Iemitsu that he had opened up, it was a process. And she knew it wouldn’t be an easy one for them, she knew she was rather weak regarding Iemitsu. She loved him so much.</p><p>She would crave at some point, but the main thing, problem rather, was between Tsu-kun and Iemitsu.</p><p>And while she hoped, she didn’t think it would go too well. Both were stubborn.</p><p>Timoteo was a lovely elderly European man, that quickly charmed her.</p><p>He had brought flowers to her, and a teddy bear to Tsuna. He had an interesting accent, which she learned was from being Italian. He told her about the scenery and how lovely it was there, their culture and all that. She made a note in her mind to visit there with Tsuna some time! It would be lovely.</p><p>Nana started showing him around while noting that Tsuna still was in the kitchen, she would interduce him properly a bit later. He was a bit shy around strangers. Tsuna was almost sinking into the floor when they had dinner so Timoteo hadn’t really been introduced.</p><p>Oh well, she started to hear more about his hometown in Sicily and how wonderful it was. She was so interested, she truly hoped she would get to see it herself someday.</p><p>She saw Tsuna looking around in the corner of her eye, turning to him and begging him over with her hands, she started to greet Timoteo again.</p><p>“And this lovely child is our son Tsunayoshi, he is a bit shy, but it seems your stories about Italy interested him too much!” She giggled while Tsuna buried his head into her stomach.</p><p>Timoteo was obviously interested in her child, understandable since he was so adorable!</p><p>He tried interesting stories, so Tsuna drew more out to hear, and it worked to a point, he didn’t move from her side, but he did put his big doe eyes on him.</p><p>Timoteo was Tsu-kun’s newest victim, he melted at his cuteness. Iemitsu’s small whine wasn’t important, he had been trying to get Tsuna’s attention for a while now and that he even graced his boss with his eyes?</p><p>The jealousy that poured off him was enormous!</p><p>Timoteo had the time of his life, getting Nana and Tsuna’s awestruck eyes on him and annoying his subordinate for all his lovestruck recalling of his family the past years. It was truly annoying to hear about it and couldn’t go be with your own family.</p><p>So, he had a blast.</p><p>But he did notice that Tsunayoshi had somewhat active Flames, a bit unusual but not dangerous, so he let them be. He was an adorable boy, exactly like his mother.</p><p>Big brown doe eyes, chestnut fluffy brown hair and a small face that just made his eyes bigger, nose and rosy pouted lips smaller. He was on the smaller side and he could imagine that when he grew into his Flames that his Guardians would be overprotective brunch.</p><p>He couldn’t wait to see what would happen, being an old man he loved to see the younger generation flourish. But the sheer joy of seeing them panicking and running around was too amusing, no one said he had to be gentle all the time…</p><p>Though Tsuna did make him question his sadistic nature a bit… He couldn’t imagine letting anyone harm this lovely little child.</p><p>But it wasn’t like he needed to be in danger anyway, his children were alive and well and Tsuna wasn’t needed as the Decimo. Enrico was even wooing his lover, so he might even have grandchild soon! But so far, Tsuna was his only ‘grandchild’, age-wise at least.</p><p>…</p><p>After the visit of Timoteo, and the grownups had talked about their problems it was decided that Iemitsu would come home at least once a year. Again, it depended on a lot of things, but it worked somewhat better than expected.</p><p>Nana started being even happier, so Tsuna had less trouble with their father. They still didn’t care that much for him, as Tsuna found him annoying and loud. He had his moments of course, but he was like an overexcited golden retriever with a vengeance in the sense of hunting Tsuna down for cuddles…</p><p>Tsuna wasn’t impressed, Nana was gleeful as she got a lot of pictures out of it. Tsuna looked so cute when pouting and glaring!</p><p>Truly they had started having a better relationship already, being annoyed with Iemitsu only breathing… But again, Iemitsu wasn’t there that often, but they still communicated. It was a deal-breaker on Nana’s side, she had to talk to her husband, and he had to talk to her and Tsuna, so they didn’t get further away in the meantime.</p><p>When Tsuna was 8 when they took a vacation to Italy.</p><p>They were visiting Nono, as Tsuna called Timoteo in their monthly calls and his sons! They might even see Iemitsu, though Nana was more excited than Tsuna.</p><p>Being greeted in the airport by a limousine set the point for the rest of the vacation… Droving by a chauffeur to a grand mansion, staff greeting them in the entrance and helping them navigate the colossal place.</p><p>Tsuna as usual captured attention as he walked close in hand with Nana, radiating awe and cuteness, it was like he had sunshine and flowers around him. Some people even thought it was a Mist thing till they realised it was a little Sky making them even more awestruck.</p><p>Skies were after all immensely rare, for Vongola Nono to strut him around he must be very important! </p><p>The staff got even more respectful, the Sawada’s oblivious to it in their enjoyment of their vacation and surroundings.</p><p>After awhile Tsuna got a bit bored and wandered off.</p><p>Okay, so they didn’t actually get that bored, but Death said they should consider going out for a hilarious time. For who it would be hilarious they didn’t know, but frankly, it didn’t matter. They were bored!</p><p>Going around, looking at the paintings and their stories, looking outside at the beautiful garden. This mansion had so much to offer, and Tsuna couldn’t wait to explore a bit!</p><p>Though they were quickly halted when a loud crash further ahead sounded, suddenly they saw a figure sprinting away from the scene, towards their location. Tsuna wasn’t scared but didn’t want to be in the way of the figure, but at the last moment they were almost crashed into, but the figure merely grabbed Tsuna and continued!</p><p>Now rather confused, but not that scared after all Nono would rescue Tsuna if it came that far, they looked at their kidnapper.</p><p>It was a young man, black hair flowing behind him while he grinned maliciously in glee. It seemed he was thrilled by something, but he did keep mumbling some-thing about scums of earth and something else Tsuna didn’t catch.</p><p>“Um, mister?” Tsuna tried, still in Japanese before remembering being in Italy.</p><p><em>“Um, mister?”</em> They hadn’t learned a lot of Italian, but Tsuna was surprisingly good to the grown-ups surprise.</p><p>He stopped suddenly, then opened the nearest door and slammed it shut with one arm, the other holding Tsuna tight.</p><p><em>“Who are you tra- what is a little child doing here?!”</em> He snarled at Tsuna, but upon realising it was a child he let go immediately.</p><p>Tsuna might be quite good at Italian, but this was spoken too fast for them, luckily they had a built-in translator, Death. Death knows no bounds after all and transit all language borders, dead people are all the same for Them. Harriet had gotten that ability as well, but even she had to adjust a bit, so her new human shell had to speak a little more to completely understand.</p><p>Tsuna did, however, catch the insult in the start and the aborted words after seeing them.</p><p><em>“Um, I’m Tsuna, I’m sorry my Italian isn’t the best…”</em> a little interested new, they acted a bit shy and looked down and looked at him from under their lashes. Knowing that Tsuna looked like a little cherubic angel, truly that adorable.</p><p><em>“… It’s fine. Why are you here?”</em> He said after a while, slowing his speech a bit.</p><p><em>“I’m on vacation with Mama here, my name is Sawada Tsunayoshi!”</em> Tsuna shone in his cuteness, making the man pinch his eyes in response. <em>“What’s your name, Mister?”</em></p><p><em>“Xanxus, so you are the Lion’s child…”</em> then slowly mumbling <em>“I see, he wasn’t completely insane in his ramblings, seriously this child…”</em>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tsuna had heard him and had a more annoyed expression, Iemitsu had talked about him again! He always went on and on about his adorable little son, and how he would grow up to be like him.</p><p>It was annoying.</p><p>Xanxus also saw his annoyed expression, still thinking Tsuna looked like a little bunny puzzled by something.</p><p>Seriously this little <em>Coniglietto</em>… </p><p>But he still had a problem, he suddenly had Tsuna as his responsibility. This hadn’t happened in a long time, when in the slums he had run from many people and dragging a poor youth with him to get away.</p><p>So, this had happened before, his mother, may she rest in peace, had always said in her lucid moments that he had to take responsibility. They were the younger ones, so he as the older had to step up and help.</p><p>Besides, he had dragged Tsuna with him on accident.</p><p>… What a drag.</p><p><em>“Alright, do you know where you were headed, bunny?”</em> Tsuna startled at the nick-name, then glared at him.</p><p>When that did nothing, they pouted and glared at the floor for a bit. Always annoying how they only think them cute and harmless! I mean they aren’t wrong currently, they could still do a lot of damage, but their young body couldn’t handle that much before tiring.</p><p>Also, they were destined to be short again. Something Death always though hilarious and lovely, They enjoyed being bigger and squishing Harriet. Tsuna didn’t mind as much as they said at times, just not when people cooed at him.</p><p>They would show them! Humph.</p><p>While they had thought, Xanxus had already decided to go out and handle them off to a staff member.</p><p>
  <em>“Alright, this is what is going to happen. We are going to find someone on the staff to deal with you, then the trash is going to show you the way to your Mama. Okay?”</em>
</p><p>Tsuna who quite liked this gruff young man, was not as accepting as Xanxus probably hoped. They didn’t want to find Nana yet, they had a lot of fun running around and meeting new people. Exploring was fun!</p><p>So, they decided to fuck with Xanxus.</p><p><em>“…You don’t want to be with Tsu-kun?”</em> Tsuna said with a wobbling lower lip, their eyes shining a bit making them even bigger.</p><p>This performance was rather hard to do when Death was crackling so hard in the corner, bending over and then just deciding to laugh hysterically on the floor.</p><p>A small tick was already throbbing on Tsuna’s forehead, but they continued to guilt Xanxus into being with them for a bit longer. They wouldn’t let this prime opportunity disappear so easily, besides they had a slight sense of foresight that having Xanxus bringing them along would bring more chaos.</p><p>Xanxus being bombed with this sight had to look away, this whole behaviour was unusual even for him. But his Flames thought the bunny as kin, he felt at ease with him. This hadn’t happened for a long time, so he was hesitant to begin with, this just solidified that.</p><p>To say that he cracked would be right.</p><p>Score one to Tsuna, zero to Xanxus!</p>
