  <strong>Chapter 1</strong>
</p><p>The Burrow was full of laughter and fun, the Weasley's plus Harry and Hermione were crowded around the kitchen table full of Christmas spirit. The party was in full swing with some muggle music playing in the background. Hermione was sandwiched in between Harry and Ron, her breath being squeezed out of her, they had both grown over the summer, in more ways than one. Harry had finally had his growth spurt and was nearly as tall as Fred and George; he had also became more muscular which you could easily define through his shirt. Ron also had become more muscular, with the help of Quidditch and extra training with Harry.</p><p>The summer had been great for Hermione, she had spent more of her time with Ron, they went on dates to the park and moonlight strolls. He had been the most caring and sweetest guy Hermione had ever dated. Ron had catered to her every need and she knew that she loved him with all of her heart. But little did she know that, that was all about to change.</p><p>There was a sudden pop in the back garden and the 8 figures all froze in place, it had been over 2 years that Voldemort had been defeated and there were a few Death Eaters still in hiding but the Ministry were close to finding him."Fred,George and Bill. Come with me..Everyone else stay here and have your wands with you"</p><p>The 3 older brothers took out their wands and followed their Father out into the dark night,there was hardly a movement made as they all waited for some signal of such.But nothing came.A loud booming laugh echoed throughout the house and then Fred,George,Bill and their father all walked through the threshold once more.Although they weren't alone.</p><p>They were now followed by a hooded figure,Hermione's hand clenched tightly on her wand as if the intruder would attack at any moment."Arthur? What's going on"Molly looked at her husband worriedly and then back at the figure,</p><p>"Don't worry Mum.It's only me"Charlie Weasley lowered his hood and a dazzling grin illuminated his face.It took a few moments but there were squeals of delight from Ginny and Molly as they rushed forward to give the last Weasley brother a giant hug.</p><p>Hermione's breath caught in her throat as she studied the shortest Weasley brother, his arms were chizzled to perfection.His muscles were evident through the white shirt he had on.Charlie had the sleeves rolled up and when the light hit them Hermione saw the burns being reflected.But the burns had healed perfectly and now contrasted with his perfectly toned skin,she had only ever met Charlie once and that was at the Quidditch World Cup a few years ago.He had definitely changed....for the greater good. Hermione had hardly noticed that all of the Weasley's had greeted their brother and now they were parting.Charlie's eyes looked around the room and his gaze locked with Hermione's. She felt her breath hitch in her throat again as his dazzling grin returned to his face.</p><p>"And who do we have here?"Charlie gave a husky,chuckle which made Hermione go weak at the knees.</p><p>"Oh! Charlie? Don't you remember the one and only Miss Hermione Granger" Fred chuckled to himself earning a glare from Hermione. Charlie and Hermione shared a few intimate moments back at the World Cup but it was no surprise that he had forgot.He was working with freaking dragons after all!</p><p>"Hermione?! Is that really you?"Charlie's already dazzling smile hit a 250 kilowatt smile,just melting her heart altogether."It's great to see you again Mione"He grinned and pulled her into a bear hug. Hermione let out a small laugh as she carefully wrapped her arms around his neck.She took a deep breath and breathed in his cologne,he smelled of vanilla and chocolate with a hint of...pine.Strange.She had never smelt that concoction before.</p><p>"It's great to see you too Charlie"Hermione was surprised that she found her voice at all,she hardly managed to breath around the man let alone talk.Charlie pulled away to peck her cheek,causing Hermione to go a very bright shade of scarlet. There were booming laughs all around the kitchen as the Weasley's noticed Hermione's blush.She looked down feeling self conscious all of a sudden,Charlie chuckled and looked at his family.</p><p>"Let's leave the pretty girl alone.She's already had enough torture for one night,am I right?"</p><p>Fred decided that it was his turn to burst in,"Nope! She hasn't had enough torturing"his eyes sparkled with mischief and glee as he turned to his twin,"What do you say Gred?".</p><p>"I would agree with you Forge,our dear Hermione hasn't had enough torturing....We'll start tomorrow!"George grinned and then both he and Fred apparated out of the kitchen to work on their master plan.</p><p>"Thanks Charlie,you've just put me in for a lot of torture from Fred and George for god knows how long"Hermione playfully hit his arm and smirked but tried to hide it behind it.Charlie saw it in her eyes,saw the devious but playful glint.</p><p>"I'm sorry Hermione,would you very dearly forgive me?"he batted his eyes at her and grinned,showing her that two could play at this game.</p><p>"Of course I will Charlie...But you'll have to make it up to me"Hermione pecked his cheek,"Night all" and she bounced out of the kitchen..just like that.Charlie stood there,his mouth agape and a hot fluster creeping up his neck.</p><p>"Yeah..I think...I'll head to bed..too" Charlie glanced around before a similar 'pop' echoed throughout the kitchen.</p><p>Little did Hermione and Charlie know they left a very angry looking Ron standing in the kitchen.</p><p>-------------------------------------</p><p>Charlie was having a very peaceful dream,he had sorely missed his own bed.During his dreams,a beautiful angel with pouting red lips and long, curled hair visited him.Her voice was barely a whisper but it was full of need for him. Charlie was suddenly pulled from his slumber by yelling."I AM GOING TO KILL YOU FRED WEASLEY!!"Charlie rubbed his tired eyes and groaned,it was 10 in the morning and Fred had already infuriated someone.That someone sounded just like...Hermione?</p><p>"It was only a joke Granger" Fred could barely talk through his laughter.</p><p>"YOU AND GEORGE ARE A PAIR OF BARBARIC ANIMALS!"Charlie chuckled softly and pulled on his pyjama pants,still trying to recover from the dream he just had.He pulled on his dressing gown and walked downstairs to eavesdrop.</p><p>"Oh come on Hermione! It was a prank! Learn to take a joke will you" George bit back a laugh as he hid behind his twin.</p><p>"This.Means.War"Hermione snarled and turned to storm up the stairs when she spotted Charlie lingering there.His mouth fell agape as he stared at her appearance. Hermione was covered in a purple goo which was now turning her skin a golden colour.</p><p>"Who's baking you at 180 degrees Mione? You're a nice,golden brown" Charlie grinned at her and let out a throaty chuckle.</p><p>"Not funny Charlie" She muttered.</p><p>"Is it not? I think it is...Or do you find this more funny...I'd gladly eat you any day Mione"Charlie grinned as he jumped the last few stairs,avoiding a punch from Hermione. No sooner had she begun walking up the stairs had she heard three booming laughs from the kitchen.</p><p>"Oh it is on like donkey kong"she muttered as she slammed the bathroom door.</p><p>Charlie had to admit,teasing Hermione was fun,he could definitely get used to this.Molly had prepared a banquet for breakfast due to the fact that Charlie was now home."So Charlie,dear,how long are you home for?"</p><p>Charlie grinned to himself as he took a drink of orange juice."About that"</p><p>Everyone's head turned to stare their brother,hoping and praying that he wouldn't have to leave just yet. Charlie stood up with a prominent grin on his handsome features."I'm moving back! I'm not working in Romania anymore" He grinned. Mrs. Weasley let out a giant squeal of delight and surprise,</p><p>"Oh my boy! You're coming home"she grinned and plastered his face with kisses.</p><p>"Oi! Mum! Leave some for Hermione" Fred catcalled,George roared with laughter at his twin while everyone turned to Hermione.</p><p>"Charlie? Hermione?" Mrs. Weasley looked between them.</p><p>"Yes Mum?"Charlie grinned like a wild cat,finally glad that he let Fred and George help him on an evil genius plan.</p><p>"What's this about you and Hermione?" Charlie pushed his chair out from under the table and walked around to Hermione.</p><p>"I guess it's out now..Mum.Me and Hermione are in love" Charlie grinned,he was always a great liar.One of the best as Fred called him.</p><p>"We just felt there was too much sexual tension between us.We couldn't bare it anymore. Hermione visited me over in Romania last summer and this escalated from there.It's been going strong for over a year now.And we couldn't be happier."Charlie grinned like a Cheshire cat while Fred and George held in their laughs.</p><p>Hermione sat there rigid like a rock as she felt Charlie place his hands on her shoulders,massaging them softly."Why didn't you tell me darling?" Mrs. Weasley smiled gleefully at the two."</p><p>We thought it wasn't the right time,with everything still going on and the Wizarding world still recovering from the war"Charlie sighed and kissed Hermione's hair for effect. Hermione's skin went from a snow white to a freaking tomato in less than second.She felt all eyes on her and the fact that Charlie was massaging her shoulders didn't help the situation either. She met Ron's eyes and saw betrayal,hurt and...pain. Her heart ached as she realised that Ron believed Charlie.</p><p>"Ohhh...I am so happy for you Charlie! You finally found someone special for you" Mrs. Weasley grinned and hugged her second eldest son and then grabbing Hermione in a tight,bear hug.The breath was knocked out of her and now she knew where the boys got their strength."T-Thank you Mrs. Weasley"She smiled nervously and shot a glare at Charlie who just winked and grinned.</p><p> </p>
