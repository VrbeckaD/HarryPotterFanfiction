    <p>Moonlight sifted through the trees of the Forbidden Forest, scattering itself over the dewy grass. Hermione Granger admired it as she walked. Night was magical. Wine was magical. Being magical was magical.</p>
<p>The full moon cleared a path for her, winding past a meadow, guiding her deeper into the forest, all the way to the bank of a fast-flowing stream— where Hermione came to a dead stop, arrested by the sight of a fellow magical being sitting on the other side. A wizard made of stars, his back against a huge old tree. The moonlight silvered his fair hair; his body was outlined by a sprinkling of the phosphorescent lichens that grew here and there in the forest.</p>
<p>She blinked twice, suddenly realizing whom she was seeing. “Draco Malfoy. What are you doing? And why are you doing it here?”</p>
<p>From across the stream, Draco took in the sight of Hermione in a short, summer skirt. Harry Potter’s glasses were perched on her nose and a Hufflepuff tie hung askew around her neck.</p>
<p>“Good evening to you, too, Granger,” he called back. “I am enjoying, in no special order, the stars, the stillness, and the fact that I am currently the main focus of your thoughts.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s brain whirred but she could come up with no valid retort.</p>
<p>To say she wasn’t thinking about him would be an obvious lie. Especially since she thought about him a good bit more than seemed healthy, in her rigorous opinion of what constituted good mental health. This moonlight-and-magic Malfoy would see right through it.</p>
<p>Defeated, she sank down on the mossy bank on her side of the stream and kicked off her shoes, dangling her toes in the water. It was icy cold, even on an August night.</p>
<p>“Let’s have an impromptu game of Truth or Dare,” Draco suggested. “I dare you to cross the stream, sit beside me, and tell me a previously unknown truth about yourself.”</p>
<p>“That’s not how Truth or Dare works.”</p>
<p>Draco shrugged. “My version does.”</p>
<p>“No doubt,” she mumbled.  Then, “If I do it, will you take a turn as well?”</p>
<p>“I might.”</p>
<p>Hermione decided this could be worthwhile.  Grabbing her shoes, she waded into the shallow stream.</p>
<p>“Careful, Granger. There’s a hole a bit to your left. You could end up treading water.”</p>
<p>“S’okay. I’ve been treading white wine for most of the night,” she giggled.</p>
<p>Draco wasn’t surprised. He’d seen her heading out with the others earlier in the evening, the lot of them carrying bottles and wearing each other’s House ties in a show of post-war unity. They, as well as Draco, were part of a group preparing for a special sitting of NEWTs. It was open to 7<sup>th</sup> years whose chance to score well had been disrupted by the war, as well as 6<sup>th</sup> years who wanted to be done with their education. Special times called for special measures.</p>
<p>Hermione arrived successfully on Draco’s side of the stream and plopped down next to him, gazing into his face like a pretty owl.</p>
<p>“Can Potter see without his glasses?” he asked.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t need to see for shagging Ginny in the woods.”</p>
<p>“Good point. Now, reveal your truth, please. Or I will toss you back into the stream.”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>“Try me.”</p>
<p>Shoving Harry’s glasses to the top of her head, Hermione studied Draco. His eyes glowed with moonlight and mischief. Hers glittered back at him, bright with interest and wine.</p>
<p>“Here’s my truth.” She leaned close to him. “You didn’t ask me why I’m wandering around in the woods alone. I’m searching for Luna Lovegood. She seems to have gone missing.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you talking to me instead of looking for her?”</p>
<p>“It’s Luna. That’s her M.O. She’s likely wandered off in search of some nocturnal creature. She’ll turn up.”</p>
<p>Because Hermione was sitting close to him and had a Virgo’s natural perceptiveness, she’d felt Draco tense at the mention of Luna’s name. She looked at him closely.  “Have you seen her?”</p>
<p>“No. I haven’t seen anyone other than you. How long has she been missing?”</p>
<p>“Not sure. A couple of hours, maybe. We were drinking; people were starting to pair off.  Neville noticed she was gone. I agreed to help him search and to round up the others.”</p>
<p>“Maybe she went back to the castle?” Then, “Look, I’d offer to help but your “group” wouldn’t likely want my assistance.”  Draco’s voice turned bitingly harsh.  “And that’s <i>my</i> truth, Granger.”</p>
<p>Hermione found his mood change jarring but far from surprising. Time to press this further. She’d been wondering about it for the whole month, anyway.</p>
<p>Touching his hand, she asked.  “Why did you come back to Hogwarts, Malfoy?”</p>
<p>Her voice was soft, serious. The way she sometimes spoke to him when they’d been thrown together in study partnerships this summer. As if she really wanted to know. As if it mattered, and she genuinely cared. Such honesty startled him, made him want to be honest, too.</p>
<p>“I came back,” he said bitterly, “because I wanted to see what it felt like to be at Hogwarts as a normal student. One without Voldemort’s shadow always looming over me, defining my life, ruining everything.”</p>
<p>“It hasn’t been like you’d hoped, has it?”</p>
<p>“No. Even after apologies, reparations, attempts to help make things right, I’m still an outsider. A pariah. The strange one who sided with Death Eaters.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure you had a choice,” she said softly. “I’m not sure any of us did.”</p>
<p>Hermione searched for something else to say, anything to take away that bleak, suddenly defeated, look on his face. It had been much nicer moments before, when his eyes were bright with moonlight and flirting.</p>
<p>Her wine-dazzled brain suddenly offered what seemed like a brilliant distraction.</p>
<p>Leaning against Draco, she turned her head, her breath warm on his cheek. He shivered and Hermione smiled. She knew the sensual power of another’s breath in one’s ear. “You told me a private truth, now you deserve one in return,” she whispered.  “I’ve been having sex this summer. And I’ve found I really, really like it.”</p>
<p>“Granger…” Draco breathed. “Why are you telling me this?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s a secret you wouldn’t expect me to tell. Because I’ve had too much to drink. Or maybe, because I’ve gone mad since the war.” Laughing, she leaped up to splash back across the stream, sandals in hand. “Still clever, of course, but barking mad.”</p>
<p>“I could believe any or all of those things.” Draco didn’t rise from his spot against the tree, but her strategy seemed to have worked. His voice was teasing again, the bleakness gone.</p>
<p>“Then don’t tell a soul.” Hermione turned back to him and pressed one finger to her lips. “We’ll keep each other’s truths for now.”  She struggled to slip her sandals onto her wet feet. “I really have to get back to searching for Luna.”</p>
<p>They stared at each other across the stream’s sparkling expanse.</p>
<p>“G’night, Strange Boy.”</p>
<p>“Good night, Curious Girl.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Draco was sure she had gone, he rose from his place against the tree and knelt beside it instead. At the bottom of the trunk was a fair-sized hole, which his body had completely hidden from Granger’s view.</p>
<p>Casting <i>Lumos</i>, he peered into its darkness.</p>
<p>“Hello?” he called. “Lovegood? Are you there?”</p>
<p>The night stayed silent except for the far away hoot of an owl. Draco sighed and sat down again, dangling his legs over the edge of the stream’s bank. If Luna was truly missing, he had a horrible feeling it might be his fault. </p>
<p> “I wish you could talk,” he told the moon as it peered at him through the tree branches. “You saw what happened. You need to tell me what I’ve done, because I swear I have no idea.”</p>
<p>It was going to be a long night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center><p> </p>
<p>Morning sun streamed through the windows of the Gryffindor dorm rooms. Hermione stretched, pleased that she had no hangover. She’d wandered the forest, searching until dawn, then slept for a few hours. Seemed to have done the trick.</p>
<p>But no amount of spell work or shaking the bushes had revealed Luna’s whereabouts. Hermione felt puzzled, and the first tiny hint of alarm began to snake its way into her thoughts. Maybe Luna would be at breakfast, happily explaining how she’d chased some glowing, midnight creature and got a wee bit lost in the process. Hermione could easily picture that, except…</p>
<p>She remembered her conversation with Malfoy, how he’d tensed at the mention of Luna. He knew something. She was sure of it. And later today, she would find a way to find out what.</p>
<p>She also remembered, with crystal clear precision, what she’d whispered in Malfoy’s ear as they sat leaning against each other beside the stream.</p>
<p>Hermione considered regretting it, then decided there was no time to waste on regrets. She’d enjoyed it too much. Just like she’d enjoyed slapping him in 3<sup>rd</sup> year. Both times, she’d shocked the hell out of Malfoy by doing the unexpected. That did feel bloody brilliant.</p>
<p>Wandering down to the Great Hall a half hour later, Hermione saw him seated alone at one of the long tables. She glanced at him from beneath her lashes as she passed.</p>
<p>Draco quirked one eyebrow, his lips curving the tiniest fraction. Hermione did the same. She hadn’t forgotten that last night, he’d seemed to be a wizard made of stars.</p>
<p>Taking a seat across from Ernie Macmillan, she handed over his Hufflepuff tie. They smiled at each other across the table. And she knew Malfoy was watching.</p>
<p>“Your tie is still in my room,” Ernie told her.</p>
<p>“No worries. It’s Sunday. I’ll only need it by class time tomorrow. Thanks for trading with me.” Another smile, then she looked down the table at the others gathered there.</p>
<p>No Luna.</p>
<p>“She’s still missing?” Alarm rose like a tiny wasp, stinging Hermione as it went.</p>
<p>“I’m going to fire-call Luna’s father after breakfast,” said Neville. “On the off chance that she went home. But Luna wouldn’t just leave the forest or Hogwarts without telling me… err, someone.”</p>
<p>“Yes, she would,” Hannah Abbott argued. “Luna drifts about whichever way the wind blows, we all know that!”</p>
<p>Hermione sensed the bite of jealousy beneath Hannah’s words. She knew Hannah had a major crush on Neville and resented his attraction to Luna.</p>
<p>Discussion ensued. The table seemed divided on whether to be genuinely worried or to go with the premise of “It’s Luna; she would absolutely do that.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s breakfast had arrived by then, scrambled eggs with toast and fruit, and the strong, sweetened coffee that she loved. Like the wine from last night, the caffeine traveled straight to her brain and caused it to suggest a Very Good Idea.</p>
<p>“Here’s a thought.” She leaned over the table, the others leaning in as well to hear her lowered voice. “No matter which way you view what’s happened, we have to find Luna and make sure she’s okay. I think we should enlist Malfoy to help us.”</p>
<p>There was an outburst of “Hell no, Fuck no, and Shit no!” which Hermione quickly squelched.</p>
<p>“Be quiet for a minute and hear me out. Malfoy has skills. He’s good at Legilimancy, at Divination as well. He’s clever. He’s the third top student, after me and Anthony.” She smiled at Anthony then, a personal smile to celebrate their brilliance. He grinned back at her. “Malfoy’s also good at sneaking and spying. If Luna’s truly missing, he’d be an asset.”</p>
<p>She didn’t add that her intuition was telling her Draco knew something. If he joined the group, she’d have the perfect opportunity to find out what it was by being sneaky herself</p>
<p> Two tables away Draco watched Hermione, torn between worry over what he may have inadvertently done to Lovegood, and his inability to forget what Granger had told him last night.</p>
<p>He’d lain awake until the sun rose, thinking about what she’d whispered in his ear, puzzling over who it was she’d been with all summer. She and Weasley had paired up immediately following the battle, but that had seemed to last for all of ten minutes. Still, not being a couple didn’t necessarily mean they weren’t shagging.</p>
<p>Today he’d seen Hermione give Macmillan back his House tie. They’d smiled at each other. Twice. But then she’d also smiled at Goldstein as if they shared some sort of special secret. So, who the hell was it? The wondering was driving him mad, to the point that he’d touched himself before falling asleep and wished it was Granger’s hand.</p>
<p>“Malfoy.”</p>
<p>Draco blushed bright pink as he looked up to find Hermione standing by his table.</p>
<p>Had she read his mind? Did she know what he was thinking? The look on her face said ‘no.’ Actually, on closer inspection, it said ‘maybe.’  Draco quickly cleared his thoughts and willed himself back to paleness.</p>
<p>“Morning, Granger.” He grinned. “I’m guessing you are here for another round of Truth or Dare?”</p>
<p>“You’re right; I am. I dare you to leave your table, sit with my group, and help us decide how to locate Luna.”</p>
<p>“She’s still missing?”</p>
<p>“Would I be asking, if we’d found her?”</p>
<p>“Only if you were a sadist. You know they don’t want me there.”</p>
<p>“But they do, Malfoy. We need all the help we can get. Neville’s just gone to fire-call Luna’s father, but I don’t think he’ll find her at home. I’m beginning to think something’s happened to her. Something awful.”</p>
<p>Draco surprised Hermione by standing up and stalking across the room to where her friends were seated. They stared up at him curiously, from their places along the table.</p>
<p>“The war’s over,” he told them, before anyone else could speak. “There aren’t Deatheaters in the forest, if that’s what you’re thinking. Or anywhere else. But just because the war ended doesn’t mean the world is a perfectly safe place. I… I may have seen something last night.”</p>
<p> The thick tension that Draco’s arrival had caused suddenly cleared, replaced by exclamations and questions, everyone talking over everyone else. Hermione wondered why he hadn’t told her this last night. And why he’d suddenly admit it now, before the whole group.</p>
<p>“What was it, Malfoy?” Anthony looked up at him, his eyes challenging, as if convinced Draco was lying before he’d even got started.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I… only caught a glimpse through the trees. A glowing <i>thing</i> of some sort. Turned into a ball of fiery smoke and rushed off. It all happened so fast…”</p>
<p>“Could it have been ball lightning?” Ginny asked.</p>
<p>“Last night was clear, with about a zillion stars,” Dean Thomas put in. “You’d know that if you and Harry hadn’t been so busy tearing off each other’s clothes.”</p>
<p>“Shut up,” Ginny replied affably. “Or I won’t tell Harry to beat your arse. I’ll do it myself. You’ll like it and beg for more.”</p>
<p>Laughter, then: “Maybe it <i>was</i> a star. A meteor, I mean?” Hannah asked.</p>
<p>“No. It had a shape. Not clear, but there were limbs or something.”</p>
<p>“Like tree branches?” Dean asked.</p>
<p>“No. Like weird legs or maybe… arms. Sort of twitchy.  I don’t know. I just couldn’t tell.”</p>
<p>“I think,” Anthony spoke again, his eyes still on Draco and still lit with challenge, “that you’re a liar, Malfoy. There wasn’t any creature. I think you know what happened to Luna because I think you did something to her.”</p>
<p>“What? No, I never… I wouldn’t hurt Lovegood!”</p>
<p>Hermione started to say, “It wasn’t him because he was with me!” but stopped herself just in time. She’d only been with him for part of the night. This revelation about a strange creature was new and she wasn’t entirely sure she trusted it, either.</p>
<p>Something was going on with Malfoy and she had to find out what.</p>
<p>“Here’s what’s going to happen.” Anthony rose from the table, his eyes never leaving Draco’s face. “I’m telling the Headmistress that Luna is gone, and I have a strong suspicion that you are responsible for her disappearance. Because that’s exactly what I believe.”</p>
<p> The others remained silent; the group tense again, with a tension Hermione realized had never really left. Draco had been right. They didn’t trust him. For her to include him, to open him up to this kind of threat, had been a very bad mistake.</p>
<p>“Anthony, be quiet!” Hermione rose, too, grabbing Anthony by the arm.</p>
<p>But Draco had turned and was striding away from them toward the far doors, the sun through the high windows creating an ironic halo around his white-blond head.</p>
<p>Hermione whirled on Anthony. “Draco isn’t responsible for this, and you aren’t telling McGonagall that he is!” she shouted.</p>
<p>“How would you know if he’s responsible or not?” Anthony asked angrily.</p>
<p>“Because I saw the same thing he saw and I have no idea what it was!” Hermione lied, spinning the tale as she went. “I wasn’t really searching last night, like I’d promised Neville. I thought it was just a case of Luna being Luna!”</p>
<p>She lowered her eyes.  Now or never, all or nothing. The rabbit hole yawned and she jumped in. “Draco had been studying in the library, then he came out to meet me in the forest.  And I was <i>with</i> him. All night long.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t think to tell us right away that you saw something strange?” Anthony shouted.</p>
<p>“You didn’t think to tell us right away that you were shagging <i>Malfoy</i>?? Ron, who was just coming down to breakfast, dropped his plate and stared at Hermione in shock and outrage.</p>
<p>“No. I’m… I’m guessing I just didn’t think at all.” </p>
<p>At least that last bit was the indisputable truth.  She’d gone with her instincts, leaving herself no time to consider how quickly a lie might spin out of control.</p>
<p>Hermione turned and stormed from the Great Hall, knowing that her choice to protect Draco had just cost her every single one of her friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>The library was quiet. Hermione’s favorite seat by the window lay in a puddle of August sun. She sat lost in thought, staring at the clouds that drifted like giant sheep above the mountains.</p>
<p> The door creaked. Footsteps approached her table, closer and closer until they stopped beside her chair. Hermione continued to stare out the window. At the moment, there was no one she wanted to see.</p>
<p>“You can stop pretending that I’m not here, because I clearly am. And I want to know why you lied for Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“What makes you think I was lying?” Hermione looked up into Ginny’s pretty, not unsympathetic face.</p>
<p>“Because you’ve been sleeping with George all summer.  I don’t think you’ve had time to start something with Malfoy as well.” Ginny sat down across from her. “Was there really a creature in the woods?”</p>
<p>“No idea. I do think Malfoy saw something. I’m just not sure what. My gut tells me he didn’t hurt Luna but…”</p>
<p>“You’re really not sure? Gods, I wish Pansy were here.”</p>
<p>“You hate Pansy.”</p>
<p>“I do. I caught Harry side-eying her one too many times when we weren’t together, even though he knew she’d be bad for him.” Ginny gave a pragmatic shrug. “But that’s long over. If she were here, she’d know what to do about Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“She isn’t here, so I’ll have to deal with him.”</p>
<p>“I’m guessing you’re not really sorry about that?”</p>
<p>It was Hermione’s turn to shrug.</p>
<p>“Fine. But swear to me that you and George are over.”</p>
<p>“George was wonderful. He is wonderful. We were what each other needed, but only for a little while. We never even tried to define it. Ginny, no one knows about that but you, right?”</p>
<p>“Well, George knows.” Ginny laughed. “But your secret is safe. You and Ron were never meant to be more than friends. Still, it would hurt him to know how quickly you jumped into bed with George after turning him down.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t like that! I’m not like that!”</p>
<p> “Yes, you are. And I’m glad. Before this summer, you were too busy winning the war to have time for the sexy kind of fun.”  Ginny leaned across the study table and hugged Hermione, hard. “Now, what are we going to do about Luna?”</p>
<p>“I need to talk to Draco. But after that shite-storm in the Great Hall, I have a feeling he won’t want me near him.”</p>
<p>“Think again, Hermione. You more or less told the whole lot of us that you spent the night getting naked with Malfoy in the woods. If that doesn’t grab his attention, nothing will. All you have to do is sit and wait until he hears about it.” Ginny smiled and rose from her chair. “I’m on your side. I don’t think Malfoy would hurt Luna. Just let me know if I can help.”</p>
<p>“Ginny? I’m not sure why I lied for him.”</p>
<p>Ginny grinned knowingly. “You’ll figure it out. Come and find me when you do.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>The rest of the day turned out to be as surprising as the morning had been. Hermione was still tucked up in the library, trying to decide if she’d be welcome to join the others in the continuing search for Luna, when Madame Pince bustled over to tell her that Miss Lovegood wasn’t missing after all.</p>
<p>Luna had simply scampered off to Ireland with Rolf Scamander, following a sighting there of the elusive Bandersnatch. No-nonsense Madame Pince actually giggled, as if imagining the Bandersnatch wasn’t the only thing being pursued.</p>
<p>Headmistress McGonagall has received an owl,” she continued with a happy shrug. “All is well.”</p>
<p>Hermione sat quietly as the librarian hurried away, then broke her quill in frustration and threw the pieces on the floor. </p>
<p>Damn it all to hell. As she’d suspected, it was nothing more than a case of Luna being Luna. But as a result Hermione had lied for Malfoy in a potentially life-changing fashion.</p>
<p>What should she do now? Round up everyone and say, “Sorry, sorry, sorry. I haven’t really fucked Malfoy, though we did it in my head once or twice?” </p>
<p>No matter what she’d told Ginny, her growing attraction was partly why she’d lied to protect him. The main reasons were, of course, her Gryffindor sense of fair play and her dislike of seeing anyone falsely accused. </p>
<p> <i>Keep telling yourself that last part, Hermione.</i></p>
<p>On the positive side, she’d been right about Draco’s lack of involvement. Plus, Ginny was still her friend. Ginny could help her explain it to the others.</p>
<p>Except that Anthony, the future barrister, would likely give that challenging look at which he was so adept and say, “I’m not buying it. Hermione didn’t just partner with Malfoy during study sessions— she <i>likes</i> being with him. Smoke means fire, you know.”</p>
<p>Things would quickly spiral into a gossipy mess of bonfires and forest sex, with Draco’s claim of seeing a weird creature tossed into the mix. Correction: No doubt, things already had. </p>
<p>“Shut up,” she told her overactive imagination.</p>
<p>Bending to gather the broken quill pieces, Hermione scooped up her books and returned to her dorm room, where she found an owl sitting on her bed.</p>
<p>The owl was beautiful and one she’d seen before. Malfoy’s owl, Bedivere, who carried a message written in loopy script<em>:  <i>Look for me in the stillness &amp; the dark, under the tree beside the stream.</i></em></p>
<p>
  <em></em>
</p>
<p>Ginny had been spot on in thinking that he’d waste no time.</p>
<p>
  <em></em>
</p>
<p>Hermione’s finger traced the curves of Malfoy’s handwriting, re-reading the almost poetic message. That simply and that easily, her mind transported her to the night before. The moon, the glowing lichen, the forest hush— and the wizard who’d seemed made of stars and magic.</p>
<p>
  <em></em>
</p>
<p>Who might, with any luck, remember that she liked wine.</p>
