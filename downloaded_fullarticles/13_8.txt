    <p>A black cat changes cells and sees dog who changes back into a man. She saw it many times before. Yes, the cat is a she, when she is in the same cell as the man, she changes back human. The man stands with his back towards her: ‘What do you want?’</p><p>‘Nothing. You didn’t do it. Is that what’s keeping you sane?’</p><p>He turns around: ‘How do you know that.’</p><p>‘Don’t pretend you don’t know who I am.’</p><p>He looks at her again, she has dark brown hair, that once must have sleek and fell around her face the way it’s supposed to. Not anymore, not here: ‘Why do you think that I want to talk to you?’</p><p>‘Maybe we’ve both been played.’ She sits down against a wall.</p><p>‘Oh yeah, someone tricked you into his live. You married you-know-who against your will and never found a way to escape.’</p><p>‘Done?’</p><p>‘What?’</p><p>‘I didn’t get tricked that way. I was stupid, but he had promises that I believed as naive as I was. He went too far. He promised me that he wouldn’t do it, that he wouldn’t kill that boy. I’m glad he didn’t succeed completely.’</p><p>That man doesn’t understand: ‘What are you saying?’</p><p>‘It’s good that he is gone, and I hope Voldemort will never return. He took away the only thing that matters to me. My daughter.’</p><p>______________________</p><p>The cat and the dog didn’t talk anymore until two weeks later when he finds a moment and sees she is alone again: ‘How old is she.’</p><p>’13, she will be in her third year of Hogwarts when she goes back.’ He doesn’t answer: ‘Same age as Harry. I know.’</p><p>‘Is that why you wanted to protect him. It reminded you of your own child.’</p><p>‘Maybe, I think it made me realize how much there was destroyed and therefor lost.’ There is a pause: ‘There are rumors, that he’ll come back. I want to stop that.’</p><p>He looks around: ‘The rat he is at Hogwarts, pretending to be a boy’s pet.’</p><p>‘I think it’s time to plot an escape. Are you in?’</p><p>He looks at her, thinking he can trust her. He isn’t sure but is there another way: ‘My name is Sirius.’</p><p>‘I know.’</p><p>‘Yes, but maybe you should use it. If we’re going to do this, we have to introduce ourselves first.’</p><p>She laughs: ‘Yes, I’m Julie.’</p>
