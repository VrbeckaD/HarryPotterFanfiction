    <p>
  <span>Harry didn’t want to think as this imposing woman stood before him. Hair the shade of moonlight, eyes that sparkled like an amethyst. She was clad in a black dress that seemed more for a warrior than a queen, draped with a crimson cloak on her back.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She was shorter than him, by a few inches and had a small frame. Yet, Harry had never felt more fear standing under the scrutinizing gaze of another person. Not even Voldemort made him feel this undeniable cut of inferiority, as though he was nothing but dust on wind.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Daenerys Targaryen.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Her name felt like an omen of death. Adding in the three dragons circling high above, Harry felt ready to surrender, and they weren’t even at war. But, Harry was smart enough to know that if they were, he would lose. At least with Voldemort, they stood on equal footing. Daenerys Targaryen was on an entirely higher playing field, staring down at Harry from above. Both metaphorically and literally.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She stood on a platform within the Ministry of Magic, alongside Minister Shacklebolt and a number of her own warriors. The Ministry had welcomed her with open arms into London.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The newly crowned Queen of Westeros. The land from whence all magic hailed. A land that, for the better part of the last ten years, had been combating a civil war. Where Queen Daenerys had come out as the victor, reclaiming her ancestral throne. The Ministry had banned all travel to the large island nation, as had many other magical governments, not wanting to see their people caught in the crosshairs of the raging war. Now the wars had ended and the land had fallen back into a relative, but shaky, peace.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Wisps of information had floated into Hogwarts over the years about the war. Westeros was a basic knowledge in the magical world. The first pages of each history book started in Westeros and expanded outward into the rest of the world as magic spread. Every student had been taught about its importance in the world. Dumbledore and the ministry, however, had tried to keep out the news of the country’s internal war.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Voldemort was causing enough issues within the country, knowing the magical ancestral home was in danger as well…..they were afraid of the effect it would have on the people. Afraid that Voldemort would use such knowledge to his advantage. Which he had, leaking out the stories of the battle-torn country, ripping itself apart at the seams. The mad queen burning people alive, the bastard king raving on about winter beasts come to destroy the world, and the rightful ruler, Queen Cersei. The latter of the three meeting a gruesome end at the hands of her own twin brother.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The country split in two with the Queen in the South: Daenerys Targaryen, and the King in the North: Jon Snow. While the king held the northern part of Westeros, the Queen had the southern half, along with the lands of the larger island to the east. Those islands that made up the beginning of the magical world.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>In this moment, the queen of those great lands stood before him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She addressed the crowd praising the brave fight the people of England had fought against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Along with her own struggle to defeat the tyrannical queen and the past king who had stolen her families throne. She spoke with an air of conviction and humble triumph that spun Harry’s head. She was a truly remarkable woman.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And Harry was to marry her.</span>
