    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Harry has always hated rainy days. The sky is gray and full of doom, droplets of water on his glasses obscure his vision and his clothes are slowly getting soaked. He has never been good with an Impervius charm. Back in Hogwarts, Hermoine used to cast it for him, keeping his glasses water-free during Quidditch games. <br/>But now, at twenty-two, as a (supposedly) grown-ass man with a job, he reckons he can't get away with running to his best friend to spell him dry anymore.<br/>The Ministry of Magic is buzzing with witches and wizards coming in, the Atrium almost overflowing. Every single floo supplies a never-ending stream of people stumbling into the building, most of them looking slightly disoriented for a moment, despite having done it hundreds of times before.<br/>„Harry! Wait up, mate.“<br/>Ron is jogging up to Harry, a crooked smile on his freckled face. <br/>Harry turns, smiling back at him.<br/>„We're not working together anymore, Ron.“<br/>His other best friend, who is probably shit at Impervius charms as well as Harry himself is, rolls his eyes.<br/>„Bloody hell, you're not still sulking over that, are you?“<br/>They fall in step together, passing a group of wizards that are working in Magical Law Enforcement as well. Harry sometimes sees a couple of their sort in his office, even though they're not Aurors, but lab rats. Not to sound condescending – without them, they'd never solve anything. <br/>He nods curtly at Parkinson, who returns the gesture, eyes as razor sharp as her eyeliner. Since they've been involved due to several different cases now, they'd had not much of a choice but to work through some of their issues<br/>„I still can't believe she actually apologized to you,“ Ron says, as if he'd have read his thoughts. His eyes are on Parkinson and her expression is cooling significantly.<br/>„Yeah, well. I guess she didn't want to sabotage her own career. Bad blood between coworkers is always a pain in the ass.“<br/>Ron laughs.<br/>„You can say that. Imagine working with your ex.“<br/>Harry rolls his eyes at Ron's sour expression.<br/>„You and Lavender have been over for, what now? Six years?“<br/>Ron's eyes grow comically huge.<br/>„Believe me, I thought we'd be cool as well. I mean, how was I supposed to know that she's still holding a grudge?“<br/>Harry smiles. Ron and he have covered this topic already. More than once. <br/>„Yeah... women. They'll always remain a mistery, won't they?“<br/>Ron grins.<br/>„You'd think living with one would give you some kinda insight, but not really.“<br/>Harry hides the sting Ron's words are leaving very carefully. It's not only selfish, but also pathetic to be jealous of Ron and Hermoine moving in together.<br/>If Ron would have had his way, they'd have lived together since right after Hogwarts, but Hermoine didn't want to. She said she'd wanted to have a place of her own first and left Ron no choice but to accept that. <br/>Much to Harry's benefit, who got to share a flat with his best mate. Living with Ron for those two years had been great – even better than the dorms at Hogwarts.<br/>But now Ron is all shackled up with Hermoine (it is only a matter of time until he'd pop the question, Harry is sure) and Harry is living on his own. Which is not a problem, but sometimes, it can leave just the slightest trace of bitterness, thinking about his best friends' happy ever after. Especially since his own blew up right after he left Hogwarts.<br/>„I gotta go,“ Ron says, chagrin in his voice. Harry doesn't pity him – he knows Ron loves his new job at the Quidditch League Headquarters. How ever much Harry might hate Ron leaving the Aurorforce, even he can see that his friend is happier now.<br/>Quidditch seems to be the youngest Weasleys' destiny, considering that Ginny is now playing professionally – and pretty successful with it. Harry has yet to watch her on the pitch.<br/>Their breakup had been a messy one. <br/>„I'll see you later,“ Harry says, before heading to the Auror Headquarters.<br/>When Harry slips through the door, Terry is already there, a messy stack of files spread on his desk, a steaming cup of coffee half empty.<br/>He's not the only one – next to him is sitting Zabini. Harry knows he should start calling the Slytherin by his given name, but he feels they're just not quite there yet. Zabini, despite ever so polite, keeps his distance from Harry if he can help it.<br/>„Have you seen Parker?“ Archer asks, only briefly looking up from his own desk that is littered with little notes.<br/>„Not yet, Sir.“ Harry's Headauror sighs. <br/>It's not the first time Sam is late. She's going to have a real problem if she keeps it up, Archer has told her so multiple times now. Maybe Harry should talk to her again as well. The last thing he wants is having her kicked off the team.<br/>„Apologies.“<br/>With a whisper of her long blue coat, Sam rushes through the door and drops into the seat next to Harry.<br/>Her black hair is shining, fallling down to her hips, styled impeccably, and her lipstick today is dark red. <br/>„Look who decided to show up,“ Zabini drawls. „Long night, Samantha?“<br/>She raises one of her dark brows at him, then picks up her cup of bad Ministry coffee. Her nails match her lipstick.<br/>„Maybe. What about you, Zabini? Looking a little edgy.“<br/>Harry resists the urge to roll his eyes. Slytherins really are exhausting sometimes.<br/>Archers dark brows meet over the bridge of his nose. He's already well over fifty, but his eyes are still piercing and one look of him is usually enough to silence the room.<br/>They begin the day with wrapping up some of last week's work – nothing special or overly exciting, mostly just stolen wands and some misuse of magic that the department down the floor was too lazy to deal with.<br/>Aurors in training are worse off than interns – they get all the shit jobs, Harry knows that now. <br/>„I'm starting to suspect that they're putting our patience to the test,“ he says in Sam's direction as he's listlessly sorting through some files concerning a minor that thought it would be a fun idea to make a little extra cash by selling some sketchy potions' ingredients for one of the stores in Nocturne Alley. Really, Harry feels like that doesn't really belong in his department, but he knows better than to complain. If there is one thing Archer hates, then it's people being whiny.<br/>„More like our self-control. Not to set this whole desk on fire really does call for more self-restraint than I usually practice,“ Sam says and Harry smiles. He came to like this haughty Slytherin with a chronic tendency to be late for everything. <br/>„Did you find anything on that lost Gillyweed?“ Terry asks them, leaning over his desk, looking a little desperate. His nosering glitters in the yellowish light of their office and his big blue eyes swim with confusion.<br/>Harry flips through another stack of files. Files. What a disgusting word. Horrific, really.<br/>„No, sorry. Zabini might,“ Harry says, looking at the wizard, who rolls up the sleeves of his dark green shirt, exposing lean, smooth-skinned black forearms.<br/>„Skim that,“ he says, handing Terry a folder.<br/>„Even though I'm almost certain that this is actually Samantha's job, not yours,“ he adds, dark eyes fixed on the witch next to Harry.<br/>Sam's eyes narrow.<br/>„And I'm almost certain no one gives a damn about what you think, Zabini.“<br/>Harry and Terry exchange a quick look. The Ravenclaw tends to be intimidated by the Slytherins snapping at each other – but he is also better than Harry at easing the tension.<br/>„Thanks, Blaise,“ Terry says and flips through the sheets.<br/>Just then, the door opens. <br/>Archer, who usually leaves them to their own devices during most of the days, walks in. <br/>Followed closely by no other than Draco Malfoy.<br/>Everyone stills and looks up. The reasons for their reactions are very different ones.<br/>As for Zabini, he's still quite close with Malfoy, at least as far as Harry is informed, so he's probably wondering why he didn't know that Malfoy would show up in their office today.<br/>Sam used to grill Harry about Malfoy, because their families are very distantly related and she has apparently heard a lot of stories about Malfoy – being two years older than the rest of them, she didn't see much of him in Hogwarts.<br/>And Harry – well, Harry almost never sees Malfoy around these days. He's spoken for him at the Malfoy trials, almost four years ago. Lucius Malfoy is since rotting in Askaban, as he deserves to. Narcissa Malfoy's wand is broken, while their son has gotten off with a strict warning and a restraining order – he's not to leave Britain and has to wear a magic-tracker, meaning the Ministry can trace every single charm, spell or curse Malfoy casts.<br/>After the trials had been over, Harry hadn't seen or heard anything from Malfoy until three years later, when Hermoine told him he'd work as an Unspeakable now. It's still beyond Harry how the Ministry is willing to trust Malfoy enough to do that kind of work. The Unspeakables might be even more important than the Aurors and they definitely have to handle more rare and sometimes devastating magic.<br/>„We've got a new case,“ Archer announces, as always without any preamble.<br/>„Unspeakable Malfoy will work with us on it.“<br/>Terry, Sam and Harry exchange looks.<br/>Malfoy looks remarkably uncomfortable in his crisp shirt. Harry is surprised to see him wear muggle clothes. It has become a trend amongst wizards during the last couple of years, but many still insist on so-called proper attire, especially when at work.<br/>His black trouseres accentuate his long, lean legs and seem, all in all, as muggle as it gets.<br/>Zabini is looking at Malfoy, brows slightly furrowed, but Malfoy avoids his gaze.<br/>„Why him?“ Harry says bluntly. If no one else is going to speak up, he will. The last thing he wants to do is having to work with Malfoy. Even though Harry doesn't consider Malfoy his enemy anymore like he had in school (it seems so childish now), Malfoy is most definitely not his friend. Most importantly, Harry doesn't trust Malfoy. In any regard. <br/>Zabini might not ever become his best mate either, but he trusts him to be able to do his work and do it well, without backstabbing him.<br/>Granted, right now their dull office work doesn't really leave any room for backstabbing anyway, but they had trained in field together and that had been significantly more exciting. Despite not necessarily liking each other, Harry knows that he can trust Zabini with his life if he has to.<br/>He'd never, in a million years, do the same for Malfoy. The Slytherin would probably run at the first sign of danger. The Malfoy Harry used to know would have, that is for sure at least.<br/>Archer pierces Harry with his gaze.<br/>„Malfoy is in training, just as you lot are. Or do you think the department of Misteries would give you one of their elders to solve your practice cases for you?“<br/>Harry feels the familiar anger flare inside of him, hot liquid boiling, a beast rearing its head. Maybe it's time to give them some real cases, then, he wants to say.<br/>Under the table, Sam has put a firm hand on his leg and squeezes. Her sharp fingernails dig into his denims and Harry bites his tongue. It's not easy.<br/>He's become an Auror to help, afterall. To do something important. To do what he's good at – taking down the bad guys.<br/>But now, all he does is sorting through dusty files and figuring out who sold some kid fucking two grams of Gillyweed, dammit.<br/>„Sit,“ Archer says to Malfoy. Terry, always a sweetheart, smiles at him briefly and then scoots over so Malfoy can sit next to Zabini. The dark Slytherin is still trying to catch the blond one's gaze, but Malfoy just shakes his head slightly, jaw set.<br/>„Alright, newbies. Our new case will actually be calling for some thinking. I hope you haven't forgotten how that works by now.“<br/>Sam grins wryly and Terry chuckles. Harry is still staring at Malfoy. The Slytherin hasn't looked at him once so far and it irritates Harry. Irks him, even. He's not used to Malfoy ignoring him.<br/>„We've got reports of Ipo Trafficking.“<br/>Sam's eyes flickers.<br/>„What's Ipo?“<br/>„Illegal Potions,“ Zabini says and Sam presses her lips together. Harry knows that she hates nothing more than feeling less smart than Blaise Zabini.<br/>„Apparently, two people have died due to overuse and pollution of those Ipos. The Department of Mysteries is raging, because those fuckers use ingredients that should only be available to Unspeakables, yet somehow, they got a hold of them and are merrily spreading them among minors and adults equally, not even knowing how to properly use them – hence the deaths. And since Unspeakables don't like to get their hands dirty, it's now our job to hunt down the bad guys for them.“<br/>„Wait up,“ Harry says. „I thought this is just practice?“<br/>Archer looks at him impassively.<br/>„Every case should be practice, Potter. I certainly hope your skills will be a little more refined after this one. You could definitely use some more finesse.“<br/>Harry swallows, torn between annoyance and excitement. If he just got it right, then this is an actual case – not a petty offense no one gives a shit about and not a simulated case. A real one. His blood is starting to buzz in anticipation.<br/>„What kinds of potiones are being trafficked?“ Sam asks, tilting her head. Her almond eyes, betraying her Chinese heritage, have that special glint in them, the one Harry hasn't really seen since their field training days.<br/>Archer looks at Malfoy and the rest of them follows his examply.<br/>Malfoy clears his throat and shifts in his seat. His silver-blond hair has grown and is now brushing his sharp jawline, falling to his shoulders and hiding his face quite effectively. He pushes it behind his ears before starting to speak.<br/>„Most of them are used for better focus and endurance. One centilitre will allow you to stay up two nights in a row, working or partying – depending on the user's intentions.“<br/>„Like coke or something,“ Harry says and everyone but Terry looks at him in confusion.<br/>„It's a muggle drug,“ he says, flapping his hand. „Go on,“ he then says, looking at Malfoy and for the first time since he walked in, the first time in years, really, their eyes lock.<br/>It's weird to have those pale, gray eyes fixed on him again. They seem different than Harry rembers them, somehow more shuttered, maybe a little calmer as well. But at the same time, he's taken back to school, having those eyes on him while Malfoy'd insult him and Harry would feel his blood boiling.<br/>Malfoy looks away first.<br/>„The other type is something like the Daydream-Potions that flooded the black market two years back. They seem to be opiates and have a smilar effect as alcohol, only much stronger. Sometimes they can cause hallucinations.“<br/>„Isn't that type currently a major problem in brothels?“ Zabini chimes in.<br/>Everyone looks at him.<br/>„I think I've heard that there have been some dead prostitutes because of those potions. It seems like since it's available, many prostitutes use it.“<br/>Harry has no idea how Zabini knows that and maybe, he doesn't really want to know. <br/>Malfoy just nods.<br/>„Yes. They are highly addicting and many understimate the effect of those potions.“<br/>He touches his eyebrow and Harry wonders if it's a sign of headache.<br/>„Well, then I suggest you check some of Nocturne Alley's clubs for said Ipos,“ Archer says.<br/>„Get to work.“</p><p>Harry has already forgotten what it feels like to actually work – not kill time until the hours of the day are done and he can finally leave the stuffy office.<br/>Malfoy whips out a stack of neatly organized documents – mostly interviews and reports.<br/>„Pansy is currently running some more tests on the Type A Ipos,“ he says while handing Harry a pile of paper, not looking him in the eye. <br/>By the end of the day, they have a solid plan for the rest of the week – clubs to visit, people to interview and tests to be run.<br/>Around six PM, Sam gets up and stretches. Her spine cracks, making Harry laugh and Zabini frown at her as if she'd bothered him in his concentration – even though he's been staring at the same report for the last thirty minutes, rubbing his eyes discreetly. Maybe he's had a rough weekend.<br/>„I'm in the mood for a drink,“ Sam says. „We should celebrate, right? No more Gillyweed!“<br/>She smiles brightly and Harry suppresses a sigh. Sam has been trying to bring the team together from the start and while Harry appreciates her efforts, he can't help but think they are most likely futile. He likes Terry well enough, but Zabini is a stubborn prick. If he isn't interested in bonding with his coworkers, then so be it.<br/>And Harry'd be dammned if he'd be caught dead sharing a pint with Malfoy of all people.<br/>As that thought goes through his head, he's watching Malfoy – the curtain of light hair covering half his face, the way he's bending his head, trying to make himself look smaller.<br/>Maybe Harry shouldn't be this bitter. Yes, he has the right to resent Malfoy, maybe even hate him – but isn't Harry also always the first one to remind people that times have changed? There are already too many wizards and witches ostracizing Slytherins and former Death Eaters. And while some might deserve that, there are many others who really don't. <br/>Harry can't even count the times anymore Archer had an assault report thrown on his desk, someone being beaten up or worse just because they happened to be sorted into Slytherin or had relatives that had been on the wrong side of the war.<br/>„I'm game,“ Harry says, trying for an easy smile. He and Sam had been out together multiple times now and as long as she's there, it'll be fine.<br/>When they had first been put in a team together, Harry had been curious about her – afterall, Sam is clearly attractive and also smart and driven. Qualities Harry values in a partner.<br/>After one tipsy makeup session though it became obvious that Sam and Harry were never going to happen. Since then, Harry appreciates her as a friend and capable coworker.<br/>„Me too,“ Terry chirps, getting up from his chair and brushing imaginary dust from his denims. His nails are painted blue.<br/>He looks over at Zabini.<br/>„Are you coming too?“<br/>Zabini frowns. Looks at Malfoy.<br/>All eyes are on the two Slytherins.<br/>„I am if you are,“ Zabini says to Malfoy.<br/>From what Harry can tell, Malfoy seems beyond uncomfortable.<br/>„I doubt that I'm welcome. I'm not really part of this team, afterall.“<br/>Malfoy's eyes flick over to Harry and Harry wonders what the blond can read of his expression.<br/>„You are now, aren't you?“ Sam says matter-of-factly.<br/>Malfoy is still hesitating.<br/>„I don't really have time...“<br/>Zabini shoots him a look that seems way too sharp for the situation, Harry thinks.<br/>„Oh, alright. If you insist.“<br/>Malfoy sighs, apparently accepting his defeat.<br/>„Splendid,“ Sam chirps.</p><p>Felix's is packed tonight, even though it's a Monday. It's not only Harry and Sam's favorite for an afterwork drink – all young (and also some older) Aurors share their fondness of the cozy bar with the mismatched armchairs and slightly sticky tables. <br/>The unlikely group picks out one of the last free tables. It's not really big enough to fit all of them, but they make it work, Sam, Harry and Terry huddling together on a small sofa, while Malfoy and Zabini take two chairs across from them,<br/>They order their drinks – and are then overcome by an awkward silence.<br/>Merlin, that was a mistake, Harry thinks. They're just not at the stage of sharing drinks yet. Not with Malfoy as a heavily weighing factor of unease sitting at the table.<br/>Harry is still waiting for some of his characteristic sneers, a sharp remark, something. But Malfoy seems to have lost his voice. <br/>To everyone's surprise, it's actually Zabini who is breaking the silence.<br/>„I've never asked, Potter – what happened to Weasley? I remember him training with us and then he suddenly left. Why is that?“<br/>Harry tries his best to hide his suprise and instantly runs every possible reason for Zabini to be interested in Ron's career choices through his head. <br/>Zabini's mouth twitches.<br/>„No need to go all Auror on me. I was just making conversation.“<br/>Even Slytherins don't always have an ulterior motive to every question, it seems.<br/>That makes Harry smile wryly.<br/>„Ron decided he likes Quidditch better than chasing criminals. He's on the fifth level now and pretty happy with it.“<br/>„Smart guy,“ Terry says and Harry can only agree with him.<br/>He studies Malfoy's face. It's hard to tell whether the blond is even listening. He's fidgeting and his eyes keep darting over the room.<br/>„Is he still with Granger?“ Zabini asks.<br/>Just then, their drinks arrive. Harry doesn't miss the way the pretty waitress is eyeing Zabini. He is quite fit, Harry has to admit. <br/>„Why so interested, Zabini?“ Sam asks before Harry can answer him.<br/>Zabini lifts an eyebrow.<br/>„As I said, I'm just making conversation.“<br/>„Are you though? I remember you being quite impressed by a certain know-it-all back in school,“ Malfoy chimes in unexpextedly.<br/>There is an almost-smile on Malfoy's face as he looks at Zabini, something impish in his expression. Harry catches himself staring at the blond.<br/>Zabini crosses his arms.<br/>„So we're talking school crushes now, Draco?“<br/>Harry is still so baffled at the implication that there had been a time Zabini was interested in Hermoine that he almost misses the red blotches on Malfoy's neck.<br/>„We're not,“ he says, voice sharp.<br/>Sam looks between the two of them.<br/>„Well, yeah, Ron and Hermoine are still together. He moved in with her over a year ago, actually,“ Harry says, just for good measure.<br/>„Lovely,“ Zabini says and Harry can't tell whether he's being ironic or not.<br/>„What about you, Terry?“ Sam asks, looking over to the curly-head. „Any embarassing school-crushes?“<br/>Terry takes a sip from his drink, then smiles sheepishly.<br/>„Nothing major. But I have to admit, Cedric Diggory really was something.“<br/>Harry nods and says without thinking: „Shame he's straight.“<br/>Four pairs of eyes are glued to him. Harry feels his cheeks warm.<br/>„What?“<br/>Zabini shakes his elegant head.<br/>„Nothing, really. I think it was just unexpected that the Savior is gay.“<br/>Harry snorts, not amused.<br/>„Yeah, well. I don't think it's any of the public's business who I sleep with. And for the record, I'm bi, not gay.“<br/>Zabini frowns.<br/>„I didn't mean to offend you.“<br/>Harry shrugs and smiles crookedly, taking another sip from his drink. He can feel gray eyes on him and it's unsettling. His heart is beating a little too loudly.<br/>„It's all good.“<br/>„So, guys. Now to the important matters. Can you really believe that McGonagall is about to retire?“ Sam says after a moment of uncomfortable silence.<br/>„It's so sad,“ Terry says and just like that, they're all engaged in a conversation about Hogwarts and their former teachers. It's something they all have in common, but each of them provides a different perspective, making for an interesting conversation.<br/>Without realizing it, Harry is relaxing against the soft cushions of the sofa and Sam's warm shoulder, talking animatedly about his failures in Divination. Terry says that once, Trelawny told him he was going to marry a highborn Veela that would eventually murder him in his sleep with a golden necklace, which has everyone choking on their drinks.<br/>It says a lot about the quality of their chatter that Harry only notices a certain ginger approaching the table when she's almost right in front of him. <br/>One minute, he's laughing about something Zabini had said in that dry voice of his, the next, he's looking into brown eyes, his mouth dry.<br/>„Hey, Harry.“<br/>Ginny smiles at him. It's a little forced, as always nowadays. He smiles back, equally forced.<br/>„Didn't think I'd see you here.“<br/>She has the decency to look embarassed. Afterall, she does know that this is Harry's territory. His bar.<br/>Even just thinking it makes him realize how pathetic he is being.<br/>His eyes are wandering over to the girl who's holding Ginny's hand. <br/>Luna's hair is even longer now, slightly past her hips and she's wearing enough bracelets to imitate a rattlesnake.<br/>He's not going to lie – when he first heard that Ginny was going out with Luna, he accidentally exploded a stack of glasses in his kitchen. Because, of course, it couldn't have been someone Harry doesn't know, a random stranger that he could easily despise. No, it had to be Luna – one of his dearest friends. There are not many people who would have been worse.<br/>„How are you doing, Harry? Has it been very strange for you to see Ron and Hermoine move in together?“ Luna's voice is as airy as ever.<br/>Harry wants to slam his head against the table. Repeatedly.<br/>Instead, he gives Luna a tortured smile.<br/>„I'm fine. Thanks, Luna.“<br/>„We should hang out sometime. I feel like I haven't seen you in forever,“ she says and both Harry and Ginny cringe.<br/>„Yeah,“ Harry just says, silently thinking that hanging out with Luna is about the last thing he wants to do. Compared to that, hanging out with Malfoy is a breeze.<br/>„Well, we'll be over there,“ Ginny says, voice unnaturally cheery. „See you around, Harry.“<br/>He nods and stares into his drink.<br/>„Awkward,“ Sam comments when the two girls are out of earshot.<br/>„Yup.“ Harry chugs his drink.<br/>It's not even that he necessarily wants Ginny back, he thinks. After almost three years, he's over her. He doesn't dream of her anymore and the thought of her sleeping with other people is... well, not exactly pleasant, but okay. He's okay with it.<br/>But what he's still not okay with is that she destroyed all his plans for the future. Just like that. Without any reason Harry could comprehend. Things were going great, until, one day, they weren't going at all anymore.<br/>Ginny broke up with him completely out of the blue – that's how it was for him, at least. He didn't see it coming.<br/>Still doesn't understand why.<br/>„I imagine having your breakup being dissected by the papers has not been very fun,“ Zabini says.<br/>Everyone at the table knows about Harry and Ginny, the Prophet made sure of that. Lacking facts, they just came up with a lot of theories how and why the realtionship ended. Harry almost wishes one of them would be right.<br/>„You imagine right,“ Harry says with a tight smile.<br/>„The downsides of being famous,“ Sam says, ordering another round of drinks.<br/>„I didn't know she's with Luna now,“ Terry says, frowning. <br/>Harry shrugs.<br/>„Yeah, well. They've always worked well together.“<br/>Malfoy is looking at him, those pale eyes irritating Harry more than he cares to admit.<br/>„So, what about you? Zabini? Malfoy? Any bad breakups?“<br/>„Oh, I'm dying to hear this,“ Sam says, leaning forward, basically licking her lips.<br/>Zabini crosses his legs in a very elegant fashion and inspects his long fingers.<br/>„Not really. When Pansy and I ended things, it was rather civilized. We both knew our relationship was expiring. We're still friends, though not as close as we used to be.“<br/>Harry is surprised that Zabini just told them that. If he thinks about it, it's the most he's ever gotten to hear about the Slytherin's private life.<br/>„Malfoy?“ Sam is looking at him with gleaming eyes.<br/>„Yes, Draco. Indulge us.“<br/>If stares could kill, Zabini would be dead. Harry can't help but be curious what part about his lovelife has Malfoy so embarassed.<br/>„I've got to go,“ the blond Slytherin says – with a look at his phone. <br/>Wonders do seem to never cease, Harry thinks, astonished that Malfoy owns a cellphone.<br/>Zabini frowns at him.<br/>„Why?“<br/>„Yeah, stay a little longer! It's not that late.“<br/>Sam purses her lips.<br/>But Malfoy shakes his head, already standing up.<br/>Zabini looks up at him, eyes narrowed.<br/>„Are you leaving because of Derek?“<br/>Harry can see Malfoy's mouth forming a tight line behind strands of pale hair.<br/>„Shut it, Blaise.“<br/>Now Harry's curiosity is peaked.<br/>„Who's Derek?“<br/>Both Slytherins stare at him.<br/>„Draco's boyfriend,“ Zabini drawls and Malfoy looks like he wants to kill him. Harry doesn't understand why.<br/>Maybe he doesn't want people to know he's gay. But that would be a little weird, since there are currently two queer people at their table.<br/>Harry also doesn't understand the strange little jump his heart performs, the slight churn in his stomach. What does he care if Malfoy's gay? Or if he's got a boyfriend?<br/>„I'll see you tomorrow, I assume,“ Malfoy says and before they can answer, he's off.</p><p>The cold air is like a slap in his face as Draco steps out of Felix's. He's hurrying, as if afraid that Zabini might charge after him. Which he won't, Draco knows, but still.<br/>Rationality isn't always his strong suit.<br/>And this evening has been so strange, a little paranoia is excusable.<br/>His phone is buzzing again and Draco's fingers twitch. He's already told Derek he's on his way, dammit.<br/>He's not even entirely sure why, but he hates that his new team already knows about Derek. Because Blaise just never keeps his mouth shut, does he?<br/>Draco closes his eyes for a moment.<br/>If he's honest, he doesn't want to go to Derek's. This day has been so exhausting, he just doesn't feel up for it. <br/>And yet, if he doesn't go, it'll only be worse in the end.<br/>But not only being thrown into a team of Aurors, but a team which Potter is a part of – well. Draco thinks he deserves to feel a little worn out.<br/>Potter, with his stupid glasses and that messy hair and annoyingly perfect body. <br/>Blaise always says Potter isn't even that much of an eyecatcher. So does Pansy.<br/>He's not bad, of course, but I wouldn't look twice, she once summed it up pretty clearly. Draco wants nothing more than to agree with her. He's tried for years. Studied Potter to find a flaw, something that would allow him to not think of him as so absolutely breathtaking in every way. And yet, he never found anything.<br/>Sure, his knees are kind of knobby and, well, maybe his shoulders aren't as broad as Blaises', his hips not that narrow.<br/>But he still, after years, makes Draco's face heat and Draco hates it. Hates it so fucking much that it drives him to do stupid, reckless things. At least it used to. Now, he's smarter.<br/>He has to be.<br/>And, anyway, he's got a boyfriend. It doesn't matter if Potter is theoretically interested in men. Draco's taken and Potter probably wouldn't touch him with gloves on anyway and really, Draco just needs to let this stupid, stupid crush of his go. Immediately. He has to work with Potter now. If anyone finds out, Draco thinks he might have to leave the country.<br/>Not that he actually could.<br/>Standing in front of Derek's flat, his heart starts pounding. Draco wills it quiet. Traiterous thing.<br/>„Seems to have been fun,“ Derek says as Draco steps through the door. He smiles at the taller man, pretending not to understand the subtext of that statement.<br/>„It was alright,“ Draco says, taking off his scarf and then getting rid of his boots. Derek is leaning in the doorframe to the kitchen, muscular arms crossed, dark hair slightly tousled.<br/>„How was your day?“<br/>He hates how lately, everything he says to Derek feels like taken out of the script for a bad soap. <br/>Derek shrugs and cracks a can of beer open, watching Draco. The Slytherin's skin is crawling.<br/>„The usual. I've just came home.“<br/>Draco turns away to put his coat on the hanger, hiding his bitter expression. He knows what Derek usually gets up to when he comes home late. Draco just chooses to ignore it.<br/>When Draco turns around again, Derek has crowded up to him and Draco is pushed back against the wall, kissed fiercely.<br/>„You know I don't like you going out with guys I don't know,“ Derek says in that dangerously low tone he always uses in situations like this.<br/>Draco swallows.<br/>„It was just a work-thing, Derek. There is no reason for you to be jealous.“<br/>„I'm not sure I believe you.“<br/>No, of course not. Derek never believes Draco. <br/>As his boyfriend is making quick work of Draco's fly, the blond says: „I have to be in early tomorrow. Perhaps I should go to bed...“<br/>„Don't worry, I'll be quick.“</p><p>When Draco sneaks out of bed the next morning, he feels like he hasn't slept at all. Which isn't the case. He did get about four hours of sleep, even though they might have been rather restless and diluted by strange dreams.<br/>His whole body is aching somehow as he takes a quick shower. <br/>Derek's place is nice. Draco likes the large bathroom that leaves plenty of room for all his products. But he can't really enjoy his showers anymore since Derek threw a fit about how he hates it that Draco always locks the bathroom door.<br/>Draco has honestly never thought about it – he always locks the bathroom door, whereever he is. It's just a habit and has nothing to do with Derek (but maybe a little with living under the same roof as a hoard of Death Eaters for more than a year).<br/>But now that Draco can't lock the door anymore, he rushes through every shower, eyes darting to the door anxiously. He knows that he's being paranoid and that it shouldn't be a big deal, yet somehow, it is.<br/>The prospect of having to go back to Archer's team today doesn't really make things any better.<br/>Draco dries his hair with a charm (it's faster this way) and tries to be positive. He knows that working with the Aurors means that he's finally getting somewhere with his career. It's all his pride, working as an Unspeakable. They didn't want to have him at first, but he got lucky – Granger threw in the weight of her higher rank and the fact that she's close friends with The Boy Who Lived Twice and Draco got his chance to convince all those old, wrinkly pricks that he's good at what he does.<br/>For once in his life, he didn't fuck it up and now, most respect him, even though they might not like him much.<br/>He can't let Potter destroy this. It's everything he has, so he needs to make this uncomfortable arrangement work.<br/>Draco manages to get dressed before Derek stirs and is out of the flat with a rustle of his coat, his boots making close to no sound on the floor.</p><p>Of course, since bad luck is drawn to Draco like moths to the light, the only one already at the office when Draco arrives is Potter.<br/>He's leaning on the edge of his desk, all rumpled clothes and thick, black hair and shining green eyes and there is a deep ache in Draco's chest at the sight of him.<br/>Potter looks up as soon as Draco enters the room.<br/>„Morning.“<br/>„Good morning.“<br/>Draco looks at the floor, until something is pushed into his line of sight. He looks up.<br/>Potter is holding out a cup of coffee for him.<br/>„For me?“<br/>Potter smiles wryly.<br/>„Yeah. You look like you might need it.“<br/>Draco hesitates, then takes the coffee from Potter. It warms his cold fingers.<br/>Potter sips on his own cup, studying Draco.<br/>„Look, I know this is weird,“ he begins and anxiety is flaring up inside Draco.<br/>„But I just want you to know that I don't... hold grudges or whatever. I'm here to do my job and do it well and so are you, I guess. So you don't need to be worried I'd try to make life hard here for you.“<br/>Draco blinks and looks at Potter. The Gryffindor has grown just the slightest bit taller than Draco. He's certainly heavier, but then again, most people are. Draco knows that he's way too thin.<br/>„Why are you telling me that?“<br/>Potter rubs his neck, shifting his weight.<br/>„Don't know. You just seemed, like, super uncomfortable to be here. With me. And I just wanted to make clear that we don't have to like each other to work together like adults.“<br/>Draco raises one eyebrow, the faintest smile playing around the corners of his mouth.<br/>„Harry Potter talking about acting like adults. It does have an odd ring to it, doesn't it?“<br/>To Draco's surprise, Potter just grins. It's a painful sight.<br/>„I'm trying, okay?“<br/>Draco is smiling now and they stare at each other for a moment, both aware that this is a first. He lowers his gaze before Potter can say something stupid.<br/>„Alright, Potter.“</p><p>Luckily, the others are coming in soon enough, Samantha being the first one. Draco can't help but stare at her fabulous snakeskin-boots and the long plait of jet black hair falling to her waist, adorned with a few strategically very well placed jewels.<br/>She grins at Potter as she takes the seat next to him, throwing her plait over her shoulder.<br/>„You're on time,“ Potter says, sounding impressed. <br/>„Of course I am.“ Samantha takes Potter's cup and lifts it to her lips, leaving pink lipstick stains on the white china.<br/>Draco looks away, feeling like he's watched something oddly intimate. He wonders whether Samantha has slept with Potter. Whether he wants to.<br/>It wouldn't be surprising – Draco might be as bent as they come, but he does have eyes. Samantha Parker is gorgeous. And if Potter is bi, why wouldn't he want to get into her perfectly tailored and admirably stylish pants?<br/>Draco doesn't care. He doesn't.<br/>„Draco Malfoy in the flesh.“<br/>Blaise is dropping down into the chair next to Draco's, watching him out of his dark eyes.<br/>„Good morning to you too,“ Draco says, raising one of his eyebrows.<br/>„It's surely strange to see you two days in a row. I've gotten used to my best friend not having the time to see me more than once a month.<br/>Draco swallows. He knows that Blaise has a point. And he wishes he could explain to him that it's not easy making time, that it's not like Draco doesn't want to see him – it's just that he's so busy proving himself to the Unspeakables and spending time with Derek. <br/>Also, Derek doesn't like Draco meeting Blaise. Draco has told him multiple times that Blaise is straight and even if he wasn't, he wouldn't be interested in Draco – they're like brothers. Derek didn't care and once, Draco let it slip that Derek seemed to have no problem hanging out with gay men who were clearly interested in him.<br/>That didn't go so well for Draco.<br/>„You alright?“<br/>Draco blinks, focusing on Blaise.<br/>„Yes, just a little tired.“<br/>Terry comes into the office only moments later, a book pinched under his arm and his brown, slightly reddish curls tousled.<br/>When he sits down and nods at Draco, greeting him, Draco notices the Ravenclaw is wearing a hint of eyeliner. He can't help but admire him for his courage – Draco would never dare to wear makeup in public. Actually, he never really dares to wear makeup anywhere.<br/>Archer storms into the office, in his usual no-wasting-time kind of fashion and tells them that they have a subject. An addict, apparently.<br/>„We've been trying to get him to tell us who he's buying from, but he won't say a word. Which means that his dealer must be someone important, otherwise he hadn't intimidated his customers so much that they don't rat him out to save their own asses.“<br/>Archer looks up from his file.<br/>„Potter, Malfoy, I want you to interrogate him.“</p>
