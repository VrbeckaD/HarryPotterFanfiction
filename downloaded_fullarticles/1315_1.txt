          <div class="userstuff"><p>To say that Harry and Draco’s team-building weekend was going less than well was the understatement of the century. “Complete, unmitigated and absolute total-fucking-disaster” had been Draco’s description of their situation. </p><p>And Harry, always one to look on the bright side of any state of affairs, was starting to tire of cheering Draco up. His Auror Partner seemed determined to be ill-tempered about the fact that they were lost the wilds of Scotland, entirely wand-less and without any access to magic. </p><p>The aim of the weekend was to experience roughing it, muggle-style, and it really wasn’t suiting Draco. </p><p>“Father wouldn’t have put up with being stripped of his wand,” Draco moaned, as he limped along the mountain path. Blisters that couldn't be healed immediately were a <em>catastrophe</em>, food that couldn’t be warmed was a <em>calamity</em> and the idea of sleeping under the stars (without a warming spell) was making the blond one perfectly intolerable.</p><p>“Just follow me,” Harry muttered. “I know the area.”</p><p>“Do you <em>buggery</em> Potter,” Draco hissed. “You said that half an hour ago, and we still aren't at the campsite. Merlin! Were I have been born a muggle I’d have not lived past five! I’d have died of exhaustion-”</p><p>“You’d have lived Draco,” said Harry mildly. The fact was, the Auror Partners had wandered off the edge of the map, and the cold grey of the evening was starting to creep in around them. It was March, and they were both shivering. </p><p>“Why ever did I think that life in the Aurors was a good idea?” Draco griped as a thin sleet started to fall on the pair of them. “I could have stayed at home. Lived a life of unadulterated <em>leisure</em>. But <em>no</em>. I had to make amends… Had have a useful bloody existence!”</p><p>“Do shut up Malfoy,” Harry replied, squinting at the small muggle town that they’d wandered into. “We’ll stay at this <em>Premier Inn</em>. Nobody will know. No wands mean no tracking spells.”</p><p>Draco agreed gratefully, almost- but not <em>quite</em>- kissing Harry. </p><p>And as for Harry? There was a tissue in his pocket with an emergency Port Key wrapped inside. There was no need to use it tonight though.</p></div>
