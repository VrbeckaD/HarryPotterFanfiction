    <p>It was 6 am on a Friday when the Aurors knocked on Harry’s door, rousing him from a nightmare wherein he was back at the Dursley’s house, and Vernon was banging furiously on the door of his cupboard.</p><p>Harry woke with a start and rolled off the couch, hitting the floor. His face was pressed into the musty, tattered carpet, and he rolled over with a groan.</p><p>“Coming,” he shouted, searching the coffee table with a frantic hand for his glasses, sending boxes of takeout and empty Styrofoam cups flying.</p><p>He found them, tucked under a book on curses he’d been reading last night, and scrambled up from the floor.</p><p>He opened the door to a very odd sight indeed. Two Aurors, dressed in their ministry robes, holding a tattered looking man between them. Harry was reminded of Sirius Black, if Sirius had been in the habit of bleaching his hair Marilyn Monroe blond.</p><p>“Mr. Potter,” the Auror on the left said, a tall, skinny man with dark hair. “We’ve come on direct orders from the ministry, to deliver prisoner #6583-9K into your custody, as agreed.” He held up a remarkably official-seeming document with a flourish.</p><p>“Wha…” Harry said sleepily, readjusting his glasses and taking another look at…prisoner #6583-9K. As he did, the man looked straight back up at Harry.</p><p>Recognition hit him like a punch in the gut. Or a boot heel to the face.</p><p>Malfoy.</p><p>A bit more bedraggled and sickly, surely, but Harry would know those ice blue eyes anywhere.</p><p>Wide-awake, Harry folded his arms. How dare they. How dare the ministry show up at his house—when he’d made it very clear he wanted nothing to do with them—and drag his enemy onto his doorstep? And into his <em>custody</em>?</p><p>“Let me see that,” Harry demanded, snatching the document from the Auror’s thin fingers. He skimmed it for a moment—prisoner rehabilitation program—prisoner #6583-9K, formerly referred to as Draco Lucius Malfoy—Custody of Harry James Potter, by legal agreement filed with the Wizengamot—He’d read enough. He all but threw the parchment back at the Auror.</p><p>“I don’t know what this mess is, but it’s nothing I want anything to do with.” He began to shut the door, but the other Auror, this one heavyset and ginger, stuck his foot into the doorjamb.</p><p>“Mr. Potter--” he began.</p><p>“Whatever you’re about to say next, it had better be ‘We’re very sorry we wasted your time, have a lovely day,’” Harry interrupted.</p><p>“But…you agreed, sir,” the skinny Auror said.</p><p>“I did what?” Harry spat.</p><p>The Auror held up the half-crumpled parchment Harry had returned to him. He tapped a line at the bottom.</p><p>Harry squinted at what was, admittedly, a very near duplicate of his signature.</p><p>“We sent the papers to you, and they were returned, signed and filed, we didn’t—“</p><p>“Well there must have been some kind of mistake. Wherever you found that heap of self-aggrandizing dragon dung, take him back.”</p><p>At this, Malfoy looked up again. “Self-aggrandizing?” His voice was a little hoarse, but it still had echoes of his signature drawl. “Rich, coming from ‘The Boy Who Lived’ himself.”</p><p>“Shut up, Malfoy.”</p><p>The heavyset Auror punched Malfoy in the gut, hard.</p><p>“Oy,” said Harry, as Malfoy doubled over, coughing. Sure, he and Draco were far from friends, but Malfoy was bound with what looked like the heaviest chains Azkaban could afford. Surely there was no need to be hitting him?</p><p>But before Harry could continue, Malfoy straightened up and offered him a familiar smirk that made <em>Harry</em> want to punch him.</p><p>“Ah, I see. The idea of having Draco Malfoy as your personal prisoner sounded fine and dandy on paper, but now that you’re looking me in the eyes, you’re getting cold feet.”</p><p>The Auror smacked Malfoy upside the head this time, but it didn’t faze him.</p><p>“Aw, poor widdle Harry Potter, scared of his classmate. I thought you defeated Lord Voldemort? What’s the matter? Gone soft with your age? Looking a little worse for wear, aren’t you? Still getting your clothes out of the Weasley’s laundry?”</p><p>“I’m not <em>scared,</em>” Harry gritted out despite himself, resisting the urge to straighten his loose-fitting nightshirt, which he now realized was hanging off one shoulder.</p><p>“It’s alright,” Malfoy drawled. “I’ll just go back to my cozy little cell, get some rest.” He turned to the heavyset Auror next to him. “Say, do you think I could have a bottle of wine delivered? This weekend is promising to be terribly more boring than expected—“</p><p>The Auror punched Malfoy in the face and shoved him to his knees on the dry leaves covering Harry’s doormat. “When you get back to Azkaban, we’re going to have a little talk about your continuing attitude problem.”</p><p>Malfoy, despite the blood streaming from his nose, just snickered. “Can’t wait.”</p><p>Harry knew when he was being wound up. What he didn’t know was why. He was aware Azkaban was far from “cozy,” but Draco was clearly still as proud as ever. Why would he be as good as <em>daring</em> Harry to take custody of him? Surely being the prisoner of his most hated rival would be worse than a stint in prison?</p><p>As Malfoy continued to argue with the Auror, Harry glanced down and studied him, looking past his initial shock of recognition. Malfoy looked…awful. His eyes were sunken and glassy, the bones in his wrist and neck sticking out beneath his tattered shirt, and his skin was pale, pale as parchment and littered with dark, startling bruises like blotches of ink. He’d obviously been abused, and underfed, and he looked like he hadn’t seen the sun in years. But the Malfoy he knew would probably prefer that to being within a hundred miles of Harry Potter.</p><p>There had to be something more. And as much as Harry despised him…Malfoy had been in that hell for what…almost five years now? For crimes he’d committed as a scared, foolish teenager. Malfoy was never a great person—he was a selfish, bullying little wannabe neo-Nazi, in Harry’s opinion—but he didn’t deserve this.</p><p>“Fine,” Harry said finally.</p><p>The two Aurors, engrossed in their argument with Malfoy, looked up in surprise. Malfoy didn’t look at Harry, but there was a small smile of triumph playing on his lips.</p><p>“Fine, I’ll take him.”</p><p>“Wonderful,” said the skinny Auror, looking pleased to be doing less paperwork. The heavyset Auror aimed one last kick at Malfoy.</p><p>“Oy,” said Harry, before the Auror could land his blow. “He’s in my custody now, right? By my reckoning, that means if anybody’s kicking him, it’ll be me.”</p><p>The Auror crossed his arms and glared childishly, while his skinnier coworker handed the parchment over to Harry, with a quill.</p><p>“If you’ll just sign here at the bottom, to finalize the delivery.”</p><p>Harry signed on the small line that had appeared at the bottom, and handed the parchment over. The Auror handed him a leather briefcase, thanked him for his time, and then they were gone, the thickset Auror giving Malfoy one last glare over his shoulder. Harry understood the sentiment.</p><p>He looked down at his new prisoner. “What now?”</p><p>“Now?” Malfoy looked back at him, with a rather sick smirk. “Now the fun begins.”</p>
