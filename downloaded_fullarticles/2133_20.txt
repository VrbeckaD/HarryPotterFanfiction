  <em>–Ophis</em>

<hr/><p>
  <em>Salazar coughed, pain burning with the intensity of an inferno through his veins as fresh blood spilled from his lips, feeling his own body slide against cold solid metal that was beginning to grow warm as it pressed into his body. A sickly warm spread over his body.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His vision grew blurry, in front of him, his three friends all cried in shock and pure rage. He could vaguely see them running towards him, firing off spells as they did so.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The feeling of betrayal washed over him both cold and unforgiving as the sword was pulled out of him roughly and Salazar fell to the ground bonelessly. His head pounded and his eyes fluttering shut. Behind him, he could hear the woman he had once considered as his sister laughing behind him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The Slytherin didn't have to see her to know that she was lost in her steady descent into madness. He knew his fellow founders would have to bear witness to the insanity sparkling in deceitful red eyes. That they would have to see how obsessed she had become.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Someone he vaguely recognized as Helga was yelling at him. Salazar slowly slid his eyes open his body shaking. The Hufflepuff was casting one healing spell after another desperately trying to reverse whatever his sister had done to him. She was dressed in black robes with golden jewelry, red-brown hair pulled back and looking more desperate than he had ever seen her.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"H-Hel...ga" He croaked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Helga resisted the urge to cry, her friend was not meant to sound as if he was being choked. He was meant to have his usual smooth but mocking tones, not ones that she had seen on far too many of her patients.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Hush, Salazar save your strength." Her voice was still as warm and steady as ever despite the panic rising in her tone.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>At this point, the parselmouth was struggling to breathe each breath was stressed and broken, "'ric… Wh-where?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Th-They'll be here both Godric and Rowena." Her tone was still soft but she was crying, still trying to save him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Salazar closed his eyes again, he was starting to feel so very tired but he needed to stay awake. When he opened them again Rowena was hovering over him, tears streaking down her face and usually silky blonde hair wild and windswept. Godric was next to her, his face was the picture of grief.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The raven-haired man did not think it suited the other. Godric was always supposed to be smiling and knowing that it was him causing the other such pain troubled him greatly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It took a moment for Salazar to realize that his head was in the other's lap, he gave his Gryffindor a weak half smile. The blonde was so noble even in his panicked state. Light blonde hair and silver eyes were staring at him wide and disbelieving.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Godric looked at his best friend, raven black hair was matted in blood and pale skin was splattered with red. The other's green robes were being stained as crimson red spilled from his wounds. It seemed so wrong, that he was tempted to try and brush it away but he refrained knowing it would be useless.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Salazar's beautiful emerald eyes gazed up at him, ones Godric was so used to seeing light up with emotion were dazed and confused, seeming to grow duller as each second passed and more of his lover's lifeblood spilled onto the earth.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It amazed Godric how Salazar could be so unaware of his own beauty and elegance. How he could be do something so common yet so breathtakingly exquisite and still not be find worth in his looks.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Even now as he lay on his deathbed Salazar still held his own sort of tragic allure and Godric had no doubt that even as he grew old his lover would still have had his limitless grace and charm.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You're so beautiful, Salazar," Godric said his own voice sounding lost.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was something that he had said many, many times before despite Salazar never seeming to truly believe him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Godric…" Salazar mumbled tears springing into his eyes before they slid shut again, "'m sorry…"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It took a moment to realize why the other was apologizing the moment already seeming to be so long ago. The fight was over something that only escalated due to Godric's own stubbornness.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"No… No…" Godric cried his shoulder's slumping in defeat as his tears fell onto Salazar's face, "It was my fault."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The Slytherin's voice came out in ragged gasps and pants, "N-no… no shouldn't… ran away."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>This was all wrong. Godric was normally the one jumping into situations while Salazar cautioned him against it. It was the Gryffindor that had always gotten injured. He regretted it now of course, far too late, if this is what the ravenette felt every time he had been reckless.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Salazar took in a deep shuddering breath, a pale hand trembled as he reached up to wipe away Godric's. Still worrying about the blonde even though he was dying. Always so kind under all the sarcasm and sharp wit.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Ro...w-wena… He-el...ga… look after… him…" Salazar coughed his body shuddering as more blood spilled from his lips, "-for...m-me."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Agony spreading across his body as his magic tried to heal himself in one last desperate attempt.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"No, no please Salazar…" Rowena muttered her normally unbreakable composure had all but shattered as she shook her head.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Salazar turned to Godric, eyes gentle and with the last of his strength he pulled himself up his bloodstained lips meeting with his best friend's.</em>
</p><p><em>"Salazar, </em>please.<em>" Godric begged, "You can't just </em>die,<em> Salazar. I need you."</em></p><p>
  <em>"I-I love you…" Salazar breathed his green eyes closing and his body giving one last shudder before going still.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Godric sobbed, "I-I love you too." He cried.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Both women wept and the Hufflepuff's hands stilled. Rowena and Helga joined him in his grieving as they all wept for the loss of their friend.</em>
</p><p>In another place over a thousand years later, four young teens' eyes flew open.</p>
