The dark-haired wizard was sat on their settee, with one leg contorted around him at a very odd angle. Harry peered, seemingly captivated, at the sole of his foot. “Another splinter, Potter? You’re a complete <em>nelipot"</em>.</p><p>“A nelipot?” Harry asked, turning his gaze onto his husband. “That some fancy wizard word for <em>prat</em>, love? Because, I admit, filling the bird-feeder without my shoes on wasn’t my best moment. Trod on the biggest thorn.”</p><p>Draco shook his head. “A nelipot just means somebody who walks barefoot,” he replied, kneeling down in front of the settee and carefully placing their Dittany bottle on the floor. “An activity you partake in far too often. You’re a wild man, Harry. <em>Undomesticated</em>.  Don’t know why I put up with you-”</p><p>“You wouldn’t have me any other way,” Harry interrupted, holding his foot still and giving Draco a smirk. “Now, are you going to make yourself useful or do I have to <em>Evanesco</em> this dammed thing myself?”</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” Draco replied firmly, pulling wand out from his back pocket. With a quiet incantation and the most subtle of twirls, the offending thorn vanished into nothingness. “There,” Draco said, taking Harry’s foot in his hands, “your splinters entirely gone.”</p><p>He ran his thumb gently over the small red spot that still marked the ball of his husband’s foot. Draco picked up the bottle of Dittany, pouring several drops into the palm of his hand. He massaged it over Harry’s sore spot, making sure that it healed entirely. </p><p>“You’re cured, you utter <em>barbarian</em>,” Draco grinned. “Thank Circe. I really didn’t fancy kissing that particular wound better. I wouldn’t like to think where that foot has <em>been."</em></p><p>Harry leaned forward, snaking strong arms around Draco’s shoulders. “I’m rather less interested in you kissing my feet,” he murmured, “than I am in kissing your lips, Malfoy.”</p><p>With that, Harry captured Draco’s lips.</p><p>Their kiss was warm and loving; lingering as Harry moved his hands lower, spreading them wide over the small of his husband’s back. Being a nelipot, Harry decided, was quite worth the occasional splinter.</p></div>
