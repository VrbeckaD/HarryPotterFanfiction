          <div class="userstuff"><p>Ginny broke away from Pansy, heaving her rucksack over one shoulder. “I’ve got Potions in five minutes.”</p>
<p>“Have some decency Weasley, at least do up your buttons first. No need to show off that shabby brassiere.”</p>
<p>“Jealous, Pansy?” Pansy scoffed, tightening Ginny’s tie to a vice-like degree. Ginny laughed. “You are!”</p>
<p>Ginny grabbed a handful of Pansy’s sweater and tugged her in for another kiss, nipping playfully at her lip.</p>
<p>“I’ll try to keep my knickers on then. I can’t think of what you’d do if you caught Draco Malfoy ogling my bare arse.”</p>
<p>“Kill you both and frame Goyle.”</p></div>
