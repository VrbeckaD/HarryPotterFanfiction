    <p>Holly Potter was not originally a Potter, at least as far as her soul was concerned. She wasn't human either. Holly, for she knew instinctually that that had always been her name in any world or life, was what a human would consider to be a very old soul. Almost as ancient as the husband she once had but could no longer remember after her centuries at the mercy of Gundabad orcs.</p><p>The dark haired woman was tall, tan skinned as a human, and bore striking green eyes. Her eyes had always been green, it was one of the few things she could remember about her long past life in her past world; her husband (though his name and face still eluded her) had loved her eyes. Eyes whose color was unusual but very beautiful for an elf to possess. As a human they were less rare, but equally as stunning.</p><p>As her body lay tortured and sleeping in the orc fortress that had held her captive for centuries her soul was sent on a brief (to one of her lifespan) but no less exciting journey in another world. She has faint but present memories of powerful and otherworldly beings sending her on this journey, the lady in green gripping her heart with a deep feeling of familiarity that she still could not explain, and had faith that once her task here was done they would return her to her own world.</p><p>Until then, she had work to do.</p><p>Holly was the one chosen to fulfill a prophecy apparently, to end the reign of the Darkest Lord of this strange and very much different world she'd found herself in. Oddly enough the concept felt somehow familiar to her, though she hadn't the foggiest idea why. </p><p>The so-called Girl-Who-Lived, as she had been titled upon her partial defeat of Voldemort as an infant, had a childhood which would have been torturous and soul crushing were she not already numb to tortures far worse from her time with the orcs that stole her. Her relatives despised her for her magic, a gift she was born with and could not currently control, and tried their damnedest to stamp it out of her. While she was not in any way fond of being treated as a slave, cleaning up after and cooking for the Dursleys from the moment her new human body could walk, it was preferable to her centuries of the foulest tortures imaginable prior to this life. Holly bore her temporary struggles with grace and poise which her human relatives envied, not once crying out in pain or complaining.</p><p>Not to say the raven wasn't in pain. Holly was near constantly shifting between pangs of starvation that gripped her stomach in a nauseating vice, bone deep aches from a body worked far beyond its limits, and splitting headaches from the chunk of rotten soul Voldemort had lodged into the scar on her forehead. Sometimes, if she was particularly lucky, she would feel all three at once.</p><p>But to one with a pain tolerance as high as hers these were only minor issues, their frequent occurrence quickly numbing her to them.</p><p> </p><p>-----</p><p> </p><p>Holly hummed in contentment, a tune nameless yet familiar, as she sat in the Gryffindor common room with her friends. Hermione was a clever and knowledge hungry witch, always eager to learn with a fiery temper. Ron meanwhile, while still clever in his own right, was a loyal and adventurous sort. The redheaded boy was more interested in getting into mischief and having fun than pursuits of raw knowledge or schoolwork. </p><p>Ginny, Ron's younger sister, had an even shorter and more wicked temper than Hermione did. She was a tomboy, preferring the masculine pursuits of battle and sport to the feminine, much like Holly herself. Her older brothers, numerous as they were, all just as passionate and welcoming as Ginevra and Ronald were. Bill was a curse breaker, Charlie a dragon keeper, Percy a prefect in school before later joining the Ministry - which he rapidly climbed to a high position in, and the twins were pranksters of the highest caliber. Holly gladly gave Fred and George the money to start their prank shop, giving them her prize money from the Tri-Wizard Tournament.</p><p>Then there was Neville Longbottom, herbology genius with a heart of gold, and Luna Lovegood. Holly was almost certain that Luna was a seer of some sort. She knew far too much for any other explanation.</p><p>The other Gryffindors had long since gotten used to the blonde Ravenclaw being in their dorm. Often sitting between Ginny and Holly as they read the Quibbler or talk about things in strange tongues that only Holly, herself, and to a lesser extent their other friends can speak. Currently the Girl-Who-Lived was being taught how to put her hair up into another intricate yet strangely familiar braided hairstyle by the young seer, winding a pair of deer antlers into the updo that reminded her not just of James Potter - her father in this life - but filled her with a warm nostalgia for the long lost home she couldn't remember. </p><p>She got the same feeling when she strolled through the Forbidden Forest.</p><p><em>"I believe my past home must have been near a forest, one filled with deer." </em>Holly stated blankly in Sindarin as she finished styling her own raven locks and held up a second pair of antlers in askance to the white-blonde girl, who smiled and nodded before replying. <em>"It was actually in the heart of one. Your memories of there will return to you in time, they won't stay lost forever." </em></p><p>As she sat cross-legged on the floor behind Luna, weaving her long elven white hair into this style much faster than she did with her own, she had a brief flash of doing this with an elf with hair just like the girl's. The flash of memory, while brief and not showing his face or name, she knew was of her husband. The realization made her smile. <em>"You know Luna, I believe you're right."</em></p><p>The human girl's far-seeing blue eyes sparkled with joy, her face pulling into a smile. </p><p> </p><p>-----</p><p> </p><p>Holly smiled faintly as she walked to what would be the death of this life. </p><p>She had lost many good friends from this life to this war with Voldemort, and what little had remained of her family. Earlier this very day she had lost Luna, who risked her life to distract Nagini enough for Neville to kill her, and Draco. The Slytherin prince, while not always on friendly terms with her, had changed eventually. He even risked his life to help her and her friends escape his home and paid the price for it. The once elf had not cried so hard as she did holding the blondes' dying bodies in centuries, the seer's promise that they'd meet again in the near future doing little to ease her pain. </p><p>Luna was family. Draco had become family. </p><p>As she stood before Voldemort, knowing full well that currently his only tie to life was the chunk of his soul lodged in herself, the raven smiled. "Hello Tom." Holly took satisfaction in the way he bristled at her casual use of his birth name, something Dumbledore had once done before his death.</p><p>"Holly Potter, come to die." he taunted, earning laughs from his followers. The young witch's kind yet tired smile did not waver, for a brief moment Voldemort and his Death Eaters were struck by how a mere child could bare the same wizened and ageless look on her face as the late Albus Dumbledore. But quickly they shook it off, the dark lord eagerly moving to strike his supposed vanquisher down with his favorite curse.</p><p>Holly made no moves to dodge the flash of green light, did not move a muscle to strike back with a curse of her own, merely closed her eyes and accepted her fate. The witch died with a smile on her face, crumpling to the forest floor like a marionette whose strings were cut. Those who watched, even the man who killed her, were briefly struck at the sight of her still body with a deep sense of sorrow; though for most it was merely fleeting. </p><p>Seeing her die was like staring upon the slain body of a unicorn, leaving all feeling as though they had seen an affront against nature and magic itself. </p><p>While her body was taunted, cruciod a few times for kicks by the fouler Death Eaters there and the Dark Lord before Hagrid was forced to carry her corpse to the castle, Holly herself was resting briefly in the glowing white realm of the space between worlds. The Lady in Green smiled down at her, green eyes sparkling with pride, and spoke in Sindarin <em>"Hello again child, I see your work is done." </em></p><p>They watched the final fight, Neville stepping up upon Holly's death and slaying Voldemort once and for all in her name. The witch knew the boy had the makings of a hero in him, smiling fondly as he is hailed as the Man-Who-Conquered and honors the sacrifice of herself, Luna, Draco, and all those who stood for what was right. Turning back to look at the flower decorated and otherworldly woman Holly smiled, holding out her hand <em>"I am ready."</em></p><p>Upon taking the raven's hand the woman disappeared in a flash of light. Back in her old body, in her old world, toxic green eyes opened. And while Holly may be back to her imprisoned state, deep in a dank orc stronghold, the elven woman was not staying here. Flexing her magic, a gift carried over from her human life, her chains released her.</p><p>Holly was free.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
