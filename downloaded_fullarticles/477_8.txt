          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Where is he?"</p><p>The voice was as cold as the ground upon which its owner stood - though, not nearly as coldhearted as he. The 'General', as he was known at the Ministry, had little patience.</p><p>-</p><p>When the Muggle war had begun, Archer Evermonde had been very explicit in his public refusal to allow witches and wizards to get involved with the conflict. However, behind the scenes, he allowed for some space (albeit just barely) in allowing wizards to aid in helping the Muggles - in a rather unusual way. The Ministry had received reports that the combat had been interrupted multiple times by disturbed Ukrainian Ironbellies. With more and more villages and hamlets being destroyed each day, it was getting harder to pin them down on the Muggles and their combat. So, several of the brightest and most eminent of magizoologists and aurors had been sent to aid a select few Muggle soldiers in rescuing the villages from the Ironbellies, and the Ironbellies from the war. The General, one of Evermonde's top aides, had been dispatched to supervise.</p><p>On paper, the operation seemed to be nothing short of a success. This could not be further from the reality of the situation, however. When the General arrived to inspect the progress of the situation, several men were missing, a few suffered from scalding, and almost all of them had been totally unsuccessful in wrangling anything remotely close to a Ukrainian Ironbelly.</p><p>Save for one.</p><p>-</p><p>"He's up near the ridge," motioned one of the muggle officers elatedly. They'd never seen anything like it in their lives. "It'll be his seventh one," cried another soldier. "They're like little babies with him. Beats all I've ever seen," he laughed, running a hand through his hair.</p><p>The General could only sneer at their infantile fascination with the dragons. "I trust your commander is somewhere in the vicinity?" His hands stuffed into his battle clothes, he could only muster a sneer at them, too - they weren't all that different from the Muggles' clothes. Filthy things.</p><p>"Hawke's with that Scamander chap," came a weak voice. One of the maimed magizoologists, Lawson Grubbly, only recently able to move about. He was one of the more highly esteemed members of the group; former professor of Care of Magical Creatures at Hogwarts, and a close friend of Minister Evermonde. It was his injury that was the principal reason for the General's visit - he was certain that the progress of the whole operation would have been bungled with Grubbly being out of action. "I tell you, Scamander's been the only one of us able to tend to those dragons." Jerking a thumb to a bandaged arm, he gave a grim smile. "This was one of the first to go, you see."</p><p>The General clicked his tongue. Taking in Grubbly's words, he decided to inspect for himself. Motioning for one of the aurors, he began picking his way through the muddy grasses, briars, and bushes. At the foot of the camp, he finally came to a clearing. He shook his head at the sight. The trees - the very few remaining ones, anyway - had been stripped clean and had been left as little more than jagged stumps. The sky was dreary, and the whole horizon was painted with dismal greys, greens, and browns. Even the remaining slush of the snow was streaked brown with mud.</p><p>Only those Muggles would be able to commit such atrocities, he thought.</p><p>Filthy things.</p><p>Making his way into the clearing, he heard a noise. It sounded like... snuffling? Or snorting— a great, heaving, huffing noise. He and the auror glanced at each other, and glanced down— and noticed that they stood upon a precipice. The ground was not too far below; enough that the General could swing himself down. What was below him, however, made him splutter in surprise.</p><p>"Mister Carneirus," began the General, "just how many Ukrainian Ironbellies were last reported to be terrorizing this area?"</p><p>"Twenty-three, sir."</p><p>Below, twenty-two Ukranian Ironbellies snuffled and snorted contentedly, as a wiry figure picked his way through them, feeding them their dinner. He took no notice of the two figures standing above them; he was too busy cooing and chatting to the creatures beside him, and speaking to several Muggle soldiers that had arrived to protect him. At last, the soldiers glanced up— and saw the General.</p><p>"Which one of you is Newton Scamander?"</p><p>Newt himself did not respond until he had finished feeding the last dragon, before slowly looking up. The General took this as confirmation that this was the one he sought.</p><p>"I am told you are the one that has had success with the operation regarding the Ukrainian Ironbellies?"</p><p>Newt blinked, glancing about himself. "Well, they needed help. And so did the Muggles—"</p><p>At this, the General rolled his eyes. "Yes, yes, the <em>Muggles</em>. At any rate, if you are the only one aiding in the rescuing of the Ironbellies with any competence, I fear we will have to shutter this operation."</p><p>At this, Newt was indignant. "Now, sir, with all due respect, there's only one left."</p><p>"Well, with all due respect, Mr. Scamander, <em>you</em> will be the only one left yourself if this whole game of chasing dragons is kept up - it's rather foolish to keep up the whole pursuit. Besides, those filthy things," he motioned to the soldiers, "need a bit of population control—"</p><p>The General immediately found himself on the ground. Newt had sprinted off; the sudden nature of this bolt had knocked the poor man to the ground.</p><p>"Where's he—"</p><p>Suddenly, an explosion rocked the ground, and masonry and dirt had been kicked up into the air. The Ironbellies began to snort nervously. Newt called back from the field. "There's one more out here— go ahead and start moving them out, please!"</p><p>Carneirus had begun to aid the muggle soldiers in trying to get the dragons to start along in the small trench— it had apparently been dug for the express purpose of getting the dragons along in the midst of muggle fighting. Newt hadn't wanted to take any liberties with such cargo, and evidently the fighting had began again.</p><p>The General found himself overwhelmed as the remaining magizoologists and muggle soldiers staggered into the trench, helping the dragons along. He found himself glancing toward the field where Newt had sprinted towards. He couldn't see anything of note, besides the ruins of several hovels. A rather common sight at this point.</p><p>Suddenly, he saw movement from one of the ruins.</p><p>The ruins shifted, and out popped the head of an Ironbelly— apparently none the worse for his being buried. Newt appeared as well, carrying something with him. Straddling the dragon - the final one, the General hoped - Newt began to make his way over to the rest of the group.</p><p>Newt gently goaded the Ironbelly onto the ground with his peers, before silently moving towards one of the soldiers. He held in his arms a blue bundle— tattered and singed. It was Newt appeared rather shaken. "It was under a beam, you see— the only one left, I think.. the coat was—</p><p>A cry pierced the din of the snorting Ironbellies and the distant roar of the guns and machinery.</p><p>A baby.</p><p>A <em>Muggle</em> baby.</p><p>Oh, <em>no</em>.</p><p>This would not do.</p><p>Making his way to the two, the General snarled as he seized the bundle, sneering down at the— the<em> thing</em>. "Really, Mr. Scamander, with as many men dying out there... a baby? And one of these<em> filthy</em> things..?"</p><p>A beat.</p><p>"I commend you for your service, Mr. Scamander, but this is simply foolhardy. Surely," he spluttered, "Of all things—"</p><p>Newt took the bundle, pressing the child close. "They were friends of mine, sir. A farmer and his family— they were the ones that pointed out some of the Ironbellies, you see—"</p><p>Motioning to the bundle, Newt unwraps a part of it only to reveal he was holding a sleeve. "This was on top of him... I'm not—"</p><p>The blue bundle is suddenly snatched. "Well, then," sighed the General, "No need to have the poor thing miss his family."</p><p>The General leaned back, and swung the bundle, standing right next to the mass of Ironbellies, stomping and ravenously snorting—</p><p>-</p><p>The General awoke to find himself at some kind of camp— adjacent to him, the Ironbellies dozed peacefully behind a fence.</p><p>He found himself sore, with a blackened eye and several missing teeth. Newt Scamander stood over him, caked in mud and grass, cut and splotched with black and blue, with a dirty boot resting on the General's chest. His eyes were red, and he was silent, cradling a whining bundle.</p><p>"I am surprised," came a voice, "That such an esteemed wizard would act so heinously— and that such a young magizoologist could have such potential...</p><p>And such a left hook."</p><p>It was none other than Minister Evermonde himself, hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>"I must say that the mission was almost a complete success— I fear one of the Ironbellies was discovered dead in one of the Muggle trenches. That business has been straightened out, of course," coughed the Minister. "I must say, 'General'," he frowned contemptuously, "that I would have rather preferred Muggle participation to your <em>disgusting</em> display."</p><p>The General could only splutter as he was taken away.</p><p>The Minister stepped close to Newt, cradling the bundle. He motioned to a group of Muggle soldiers— their chaplain stepped forward with an elderly woman, hunched and teary eyed. "The closest kin, Mister Scamander."</p><p>Newt stooped to hand over the child, and found himself enveloped in an astonishingly tight hug by the old woman. Gently taking the baby, she pressed a kiss to Newt's forehead, before pausing. Unwrapping the coat from the child, she handed it to him, and spoke something Newt didn't understand.</p><p>"The farmer's coat, it seems— her son," one of the soldiers said. Relaying the message for confirmation, the elderly woman replied with a nod. With another hug, she departed with her grandson, and the group gradually dispersed.</p><p>Newt stared down at the worn coat, singed at its edges and tattered in spots. He slowly slipped it on, wrapping it around his wiry frame.</p><p><em>For all the talk about Muggles,</em> Newt mused, <em>there's certainly much, much worse in the world.</em></p></div>
