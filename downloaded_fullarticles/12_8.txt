    <p>The unthinkable happened. Voldemort had won at the Battle of Hogwarts. Although Harry had faced off against Voldemort, the spell was shot too far to the right and had shot off to the side after the spells met. Harry fought as well as he could after surprising us that he was alive, but as much as he tried, we had to retreat. With the wards down, we apparated away to safe houses.</p>
<p>Ron, Harry and I ended up at Shell Cottage with the rest of the Weasley's. Together we mourned the loss of Fred, Remus, and Tonks. Individually, we mourned those we lost that we were close to as well others such as Lavender Brown, Colin Creevey and many other students we had classes with over the years. When it was safe, we buried the bodies we were able to save from the death eaters and the damage they would do to the dead.</p>
<p>After a month of sitting around with very little advancement made, I had the best and worst idea possible. It was to the point the Order was fighting with themselves and many were threatening to quit and hide on the continent or the United States. While I was in the Muggle world shopping for food, I sent a <em>Patronus</em> to Draco Malfoy of all people, with a brief message, '<em>Meet me at Hogwarts in the Room Where Things are Hidden tomorrow</em>.' I knew there was a good chance I could be killed with others coming with him, or that Malfoy wouldn't show at all. The best part of this plan, I didn't tell anyone I was doing it.</p>
<p>The next morning I left before anyone woke up. Because I didn't say a specific time, I figured I should be there early and plan on staying until after the sun went down. I left a note saying I would be back later for the occupants of Shell Cottage and apparated to Hogwarts. Not much had changed in the month since the final battle. I was lucky to find the path to the seventh floor was stable and did not crumble under my weight. Once outside the room, I pulled a book from my bag and sat to read.</p>
<p>Around mid-day, I took a sandwich out of my bag to eat. So far, the castle had been quiet other than the gentle lapping of water coming from the Black Lake. Knowing I needed to get up and stretch, I walked around the seventh floor to see how damaged Hogwarts was in this section. It seemed like this part of the castle was untouched, other than the Room of Requirements, which had burned with <em>Fiendfyre</em>. After half an hour of exploring, I went back to my book.</p>
<p>Just as the sun was beginning to set, and I was getting ready to leave, a faint pop was heard near the stairs. I got my wand out and stood closer to the corner to peek around. Stood with his wand out was Draco Malfoy, looking paler than normal. I looked around quickly but noticed he was alone.</p>
<p>"Malfoy?" I called out hesitantly, even though I knew it was him.</p>
<p>"Who's there? Show yourself," he called back. I guess he didn't know it was my <em>Patronus</em>.</p>
<p>After putting my wand in my pocket, I walked slowly around the corner with my hands in the air to show I meant no harm.</p>
<p>"Granger?"</p>
<p>"Thank you for coming. I know it was a very vague message, but you may be the only person who can help us."</p>
<p>"Who's us? Potty and Weaslebee? I don't think so. I'm leaving," Draco scoffed.</p>
<p>"Please, just hear me out. If you want to leave after that, I won't stop you."</p>
<p>"Fine, you have ten minutes to convince me to help you."</p>
<p>So I began to tell him about Horcruxes and how Voldemort had split his soul into seven fragments. How Harry, Ron and I had spent the last year tracking them all down and destroying them, but in the end, it was a standoff between Harry and Voldemort.</p>
<p>"Wait, you're telling me that the noseless bastard found a way to make himself immortal? Did you get all the pieces?" Draco asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, we destroyed all the pieces that we knew of, but in the past month, he could have made more. This is where we need you."</p>
<p>"Granger, in case you couldn't tell, I am not in any place to help anyone. You and the rest of the Order should give up and leave Great Britain."</p>
<p>"No. This is our home too. Now, this is what I need from you. You need to find out if he created more Horcruxes. And…"</p>
<p>"And what? What more could you possibly need from me?" Draco interrupted. </p>
<p>"We need you to get Voldemort's wand. He currently has Dumbledore's wand, which happens to also be the Elder Wand."</p>
<p>"You want me to believe that <em>The Tale of Three Brothers</em> is real? Now I know you are crazy. Thanks for the laugh, Granger."</p>
<p>"You think I'm joking? Harry also has an invisibility cloak that was his fathers and has been passed down through the generations and works perfectly fine," I said with my hands on my hips.</p>
<p>"That means nothing. Wait; is that how you got away with so much?"</p>
<p>"I don't have time to debate all that we did during our years at Hogwarts right now. Will you help us with this or not?"</p>
<p>"Maybe. I have conditions."</p>
<p>"Naturally. What are your terms?" I asked with an eye roll.</p>
<p>"First, I want a better way to communicate with you. I want one of those coins you had in fifth year for your little defense group."</p>
<p>"I can do that. It may take me a few days to get the materials I need. Once that happens, I can cast the charm easily enough."</p>
<p>"Then, I want a wizarding oath that at the end of all this, you will vouch for my help in all this and try to help me get a lighter sentence. This goes for my mother as well."</p>
<p>"Not your father?" I asked with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>"No, he can rot in Azkaban for all I care. It's his fault I have this awful mark and have to bow to a crazy man."</p>
<p>"I can make the vow with you as well. Anything else?"</p>
<p>"One more thing, I want one night with you," Draco said with a smirk as he crossed his arms.</p>
<p>"What, are you short of women who will please you? And why me? You have made it perfectly clear that you hate all that I am and stand for."</p>
<p>"My reasons are my own. Take it or leave it. Those are my terms."</p>
<p>One night. Could I do it? Ron and I had fizzled after that kiss and I didn't have any other prospects at this time. Moreover, we could really use his help to end this once and for all. If it was too bad, Ginny would probably <em>obliviate</em> me if I asked her.</p>
<p>"Deal."</p>
