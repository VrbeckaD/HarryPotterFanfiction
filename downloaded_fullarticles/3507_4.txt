    <p>Harry sat down at the long table in Malfoy Manor. Voldemort had just released all of his followers. Harry had been in the shadows. He had been watching and listening. "You have a traitor."</p><p>"I am aware. I have been trying to figure it out." Voldemort had cursed a few of his followers. He still felt like he needed to curse someone.</p><p>"I have an idea if you want to try it." Harry told the man. He got a raised eyebrow, not that there was hair there. "Give every one of your elite a basic plan of attack, same date, same time, but change the minor important details. If you were to attack Hogsmeade, tell Bella you want her to start at the north end of town, Lucius, use the south, Severus start at Honeydukes, work your way down and around the details. It will weed out your traitor by the minor detail, as they won't feel endangered by everyone having the same basic plan." </p><p>"If I selected Hogsmeade, Dumbledore will arrive. Especially if I do it over the holiday." </p><p>"Exactly."</p><p>"Let's work up the battle plan. If we give just a few days warning, it won't enable Dumbledore to prepare."</p><p>Harry grinned.</p><p>___________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Harry leaned against the tree. He was watching the battle unfold down at Hogsmeade. Dumbledore had arrived after about ten minutes of fighting. Voldemort and Dumbledore were battling it out. Dumbledore was, frankly, hard to miss. Dumbledore was wearing a bright red robe with dancing mistletoe and reindeer prancing around. </p><p>The spells were flying fast and furious. The Death Eaters and the Order were wiping each other out, as Voldemort and Dumbledore were dueling. Dumbledore and Voldemort had taken a lot of curses, hexes, and spells and it was showing.</p><p>Dumbledore couldn't raise his left arm, there was blood running down his right shoulder, and he was limping. Voldemort was a bit worse for wear. He was missing his right arm, had a gash on his forehead and looked ready to drop.</p><p>"You do give me the best Yule gift." Severus stated as he kissed Harry.</p><p>"Soon, it will be over. I already planted the magical listening devices in Malfoy Manor. Dumbledore's signature is all over them."</p><p>"Those emergency port-keys?" Severus asked. "Bella is dead." He watched the cutting curse hit the woman's throat. He knew Bella couldn't remain alive, she was too crazy.</p><p>"Yes, I used a parsel magic spell to make them into the listening devices. Avery and Malfoy were killed over by Honeydukes. I am not sure who got Malfoy."</p><p>"I did." Severus smirked. He had been waiting years to get back at Lucius and enjoyed surprising the man, and watching him fall dead. "Draco got the students who were in Hogwarts to safety before the battle, so Dumbledore couldn't drag them into it."</p><p>"Good. Oh, that was creative. I didn't think Tonks had it in her." Harry was impressed by the little Auror. She took out Macnair with a leg locking jinx, followed by a spell that removed all of his clothes, and tied him. Macnair was now hanging from the eave of the Three Broomstick. </p><p>"How much longer before we get rid of Dumbledore and Tom?" Severus asked.</p><p>"Already taken care of. It's why they are both not able to fend off the spells. I gave them that lovely little potion Tom wanted you to create."</p><p>Severus smirked. The potion was very simple, as you used your magic, it drained your core, the bigger the spell the more it drained. If you used it enough it wouldn't stop until you were a squib. "I wonder how they are going to like being squibs?"</p><p>"No idea, but I figure we could always hire them next Yule to play St. Nick and his wife."</p><p>Severus laughed, he looked down at the battle that was clearly wiping out the Death Eaters. "I will show you how much I loved my present later."</p><p>"I am counting on it." Harry pulled Severus into his arms. "So what do you want for your birthday?"</p>
