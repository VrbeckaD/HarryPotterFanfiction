  <strong>Prologue (April 28, 1998) </strong>
</p><p>Sybill Trelawney convulsed on the floor, her face distorted. Two pairs of pale blue eyes watched her with concern. Her voice rumbled out, filling the headmaster’s office:</p><p>
  <strong> “The dark lord approaches… <br/></strong>
  <strong>The girl with ‘very little aura’ is called…against her will… <br/></strong>
  <strong>To the place where the Grindylows sleep <br/></strong>
  <strong>She will go to the one whom you trust <br/></strong>
  <strong>They are in grave danger…” </strong>
</p><p>Albus Dumbledore gave a quick nod, interpreting her meaning. “Fawkes,” he called. The bird gracefully swooped down to him, landing on his outstretched arm. He whispered something in the creature’s ear, gently stroking its colorful feathers. Giving it a pat, he moved his arm up and the magnificent bird flapped its wings, causing loose parchment on the desk to fly into the air. The bird soared out the window, flying slowly, watching the school grounds.</p><p>Minerva McGonagall looked back and forth from Trelawney to Dumbledore in alarm.</p><p>A few more jerks and then Trelawney went rigid. Her eyes glazed over. Her chest heaved upwards and she made a sound as if she was trying to suck all of the air out of the room and into her body. Silence for a few seconds and then a loud gurgling sound, that seemed to echo off the walls, filled the office. McGonagall clutched at her heart, truly terrified, but Dumbledore stood patiently his hands clasped in front of him, watching Trelawney expectantly.</p><p>
  <strong>“Seven will approach seven, <br/>By the end of the seventh year<br/>the stage will be set, the characters in position<br/></strong>
  <strong>Evil will not rest. <br/></strong>
  <strong>The two who will rot in the cage <br/></strong>
  <strong>The two who held hands at birth <br/></strong>
  <strong>Two pureblood snakes, coiled together in marriage <br/></strong>
  <strong>The one thought to be eliminated by a kiss <br/></strong>
  <strong>The Outside threatens those Within…” </strong>
</p><p>“Minerva,” Dumbledore’s deep voice made McGonagall jump, she had been so transfixed on Trelawney. “Make sure you keep this memory protected. It’s of utmost importance.” She could only nod in response, as she stood trembling; horror, she could not hide, etched across her face.</p><p>But Sybill Trelawney’s Sight had more to reveal…</p><hr/><p>
  <strong>Chapter 1 (5 Years Later…)</strong>
</p><p>Hermione Granger looked up at the castle with the same optimism and wonder she’d had as a first year student. A flood of memories washed over her. Some painful, some truly awful, but most were happy, comforting, or bittersweet to say the least.</p><p>She adjusted the straps of her bulging book bag. The straps dug into her shoulder as the weight of it bore down upon her. She had over prepared. Again.</p><p><em>Oh well</em>, she sighed. <em>No use in denying it.</em> She <em>was </em>an overachiever.<em> But</em>, she reasoned, <em>being an overachiever has certainly gotten me places in the last 5 years</em>. Only 23-years-old she had built up quite a distinguished resume since leaving Hogwarts in 1998.</p><p>The students who survived the Battle of Hogwarts had been allowed to take the N.E.W.T. exams in the fall after months of recuperation and the restoration of the school. Then the 7<sup>th</sup> year classmates went their separate ways. Well, mostly. She, Ron, and Harry continued to remain pretty much inseparable. The three of them rented a flat in London as they all went to work for the Ministry of Magic; the two boys as Aurors and she, interning for the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Harry and Ginny became an official couple just weeks after the battle, although Hermione had a feeling they had been secretly dating since Bill and Fleur’s wedding, probably wanting to avoid Ron’s reaction for as long as possible. Ginny moved in with them soon after her own graduation in 1999, much to Ron’s discomfort at first. But the apartment proved to be just a little too snug with four occupants, and they decided to part ways in regard to their living conditions.</p><p>Hermione found a quaint little cottage for herself on the outskirts of London, happy to have a refuge from society, a place where she could curl up with a book or turn to research for days without anyone interrupting her. Her friends argued against her habit to be a social recluse, so she made sure to join them just enough to stop their pestering and appease them. Ginny and Harry found an apartment in a trendy part of the city, a district with lots of shops and nightlife to offer. Unwilling to move out of the original apartment, Ron talked Neville, who had joined Harry and Ron as an Auror, into moving in with him and the two grew closer than anyone expected.</p><p>But now Hermione was back at the school, her eyes fixed with determination. She entered the castle and made her way towards the headmistress’s office. Despite her attempts to tame her unruly hair, the July humidity had force wayward curls to break loose from her knotted updo. She felt most uncomfortable wearing heels, she <em>loathed</em> high heels, but Ginny had insisted that these were the only shoes that worked well with the pinstripe pencil skirt Hermione had chosen to wear. So she stumbled along, pretending like she knew how to walk in heels, her feet feeling raw and aching terribly.</p><p>She smiled and greeted the portraits she passed. Despite any physical discomfort, she felt happy, as if she was coming <em>home </em>from a long vacation. <em>This just feels right. </em> </p><hr/><p>“This is an impressive resume, Ms. Granger, especially for someone as young as yourself. But that doesn’t surprise me, you were always a go-getter. Top of your class, ambitious, had a good head on your shoulders. You’ve made both Hogwarts and Gryffindor proud.”</p><p>Hermione beamed under McGonagall’s praise. Her former house head had always been at the top of Hermione’s list to impress and please.</p><p>The older woman looked out over her glasses, perched on the end of her nose, studying Hermione. “I do find it interesting that you applied for the position of Potions Professor. I knew you excelled at that subject, but I didn’t know it was that great of an interest for you.”</p><p>“Well,” Hermione leaned forward, her eyes merry, her face lit up with excitement. “I don’t want to limit myself just yet. I want as much experience as I can get in various fields. But I’ve always thought I’d like to teach at some point and with my high N.E.W.T. scores in Potions, I feel as though I am capable of teaching this subject. I’m also interested in potion experimentation, with the access to research the school allows. It coordinates with some growing interest I have in eventually combining my previous work with the International Community with medical research at St. Mungo’s.”</p><p>“Oh my, Ms. Granger, you are even more driven that I realized,” McGonagall’s eyes were tearing up, pride radiated from her face.<br/> “Well, my dear, as you know, step two of the hiring process is an interview with other faculty members and then I will confer with them privately for the final decision. But as far as I’m concerned you are a top candidate and would be a great addition to our faculty. You have always been a natural leader and teacher. And I would love to see you lead Gryffindor House, with all the dignity and courage you had as a student.”</p><p>“Thank you, Prof-I mean Headmistress McGonagall,” Hermione blushed at her gaffe. “I truly appreciate your encouraging words and consideration.” Hermione smiled warmly at the woman, standing up and gathering her bag and folders. She held out her hand confidently to McGonagall before turning her attention to Dumbledore’s portrait.</p><p>“Headmaster Dumbledore,” she said respectfully. She looked up and tapped her hand over her heart a couple of times.</p><p>“I’ll give Harry your love, of course.”</p><p>Minerva turned towards Dumbledore’s portrait after Hermione retreated, her eyes still shimmering. “Just look at our girl now. She’s the embodiment of youth and vitality.” Dumbledore nodded approvingly. “Indeed. And she has a much more important role to play than she ever imagined. You must begin to prepare, make sure they stay the course.”</p><p>Minerva looked concerned. “But, Albus, wouldn’t that be tampering with the prophecy if I get involved?”</p><p>He shook his head, stroking his beard thoughtfully. “No, you are merely assisting the prophecy. Similar to the ways I assisted Trelawney’s earlier prophecies. She may be pliable enough. <em>He</em>, on the other hand-”</p><p>“I know,” Minerva responded, her voice resigned.   </p><hr/><p>Hermione left Headmistress McGonagall’s office with a bounce in her step, completely forgetting the pain in her feet. She couldn’t contain her smile, optimistic that this next adventure would be just as wonderful as her former jobs with the Ministry.</p><p>Practically skipping down the stairs she failed to notice Severus Snape lurking at the bottom, still in his routine habit of hiding in the shadows. His perpetual scowl deepened. <em>What is she doing here?</em></p><p>The Defense Against the Dark Arts professor took to the stairs she just descended, taking two or three at a time, his school robe swishing around his legs. He was out of breath by the time he knocked on Minerva’s door.</p><p>“Severus, what can I do for you?”</p><p>“What was she doing here?”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Granger. <em>Ms.</em> Granger, I mean.” He shot a quick look at Dumbledore’s portrait, his eyes apologetic for his slip.</p><p>“She applied for your old position.”</p><p>“Potions Professor? Is she even qualified? She still looks like a student.”</p><p>Minerva laughed. “Oh Severus. It’s been five years. She’s in her mid 20s now. And while…yes, I agree, she’s a bit fresh faced, I think she would breathe a lot of that youth and energy back into this place. The faculty is so…old.”</p><p>Snape grimaced. But Minerva continued, “plus, weren’t you nearly the same age when Albus hired you?” She raised her eyebrows at him, tilting her head.</p><p>“He was even younger,” Dumbledore chimed in, his voice amused. Snape rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Well I didn’t think she had that much interest in the subject, other than memorizing all the information and rattling off answers like an encyclopedia.”</p><p>“Severus,” Minerva gave him a reproachful look. Snape sunk into a chair, slouching like a teenage boy. “We will be interviewing her as a faculty at the end of the week. You can test her aptitude then. But her resume is quite impressive.” She handed him a piece of parchment.</p><p>He read it wearily.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

He hoped it drove her crazy that she only got an <em>Exceeds Expectations</em> in Herbology. He wish he could have seen her face when she received her N.E.W.T. letter.</p><p>“So, we’ll be interviewing her Friday. Now will you stay and join me for some tea?”</p><p>Snape nodded, rubbing his forehead, the crease between his eyes deepening. “Is this how you felt when your former students started getting hired?”</p><p>“Oh probably. I went ballistic when you were hired,” Snape still had his head bowed in his hand, but he could hear the smile in her voice. “You’ll get used to it eventually.”</p><p>“I’d prefer <em>not</em> to get used to it,” he said flatly.</p><p>She served him a cup and sat behind the desk, observing him over the edge of her cup as she sipped.</p><p>“I thought surely by now you all would be over your former prejudices.”</p><p>“They graduated and moved on. I figured I wouldn’t need to see them again.”</p><p>“You really believed that? I think Harry Potter will always be connected to this school in some way. I’m not at all surprised Hermione has shown an interest in teaching. Remember when she would lead their study groups? And I daresay I heard during 5<sup>th</sup> year she held potions seminars to help with students struggling in your classes.”</p><p>He made an exasperated face, but said nothing.</p><p>She smiled kindly at him. “Oh, Severus. She bears you no ill feelings and I’m surprised you’ve never been able to recognize that. Give her a chance.”</p><p>“Just like I’m given the same chance by Order members? They all still despise me. Come, Minerva, let’s not pretend that the battle changed anything. All those prejudices still exist on their end too. I will forever be judged and misunderstood.”</p><p>He sat back, looking at her frankly. He was not immune or sensitive to the truth about him. He had long accepted it.</p><p>She watched him sadly. “We shall see,” she said, almost inaudibly.</p><hr/><p>Hermione entered into the staff room and actually felt nervous as she surveyed her interview committee. Swallowing hard, she took the empty seat that faced the six faculty members. She willed herself to relax.</p><p>At either end of the long table sat Professor Sprout and an unfamiliar face of a middle age man. McGonagall introduced him as Professor Sebastian Keighly the new History of Magic teacher. Next to Sprout sat Professor Vector and next to Professor Keighly Professor Flitwick sat, his head not much higher than the table. That left Professors Snape and McGongall in the middle, directly opposite of Hermione’s chair.</p><p>She arranged her stack of parchment in front of her, trying to exude confidence, and looked up, meeting Snape’s sharp eyes. Her stomach dropped. He did not look pleased to be there.</p><p>She dropped her eyes. <em>Maybe this was a mistake.</em> She hadn’t seen Snape in years but she thought that by now, with everything that had happened during the battle and revealed afterwards, he would have shed his former hostility towards her. She had always been quick to defend him and tried remain positive about his faithfulness to Dumbledore as a student, despite his consistent attempts to ridicule her. While other Order members, including Harry and Ron, had remained dubious about his allegiance, he <em>had</em> proved to be a diligent servant to Dumbledore and the Order.</p><p>She didn’t have much time to mull over her confusion, though. McGonagall’s voice broke the silence. “Tell us, Ms. Granger, why you’ve taken an interest in teaching?”</p><p>Hermione was grateful for the softball question. Her eyes softened and a faint smile appeared as her nervous tension dissipated.</p><p>The pedagogical questions continued as Sprout asked what skills Hermione had learned in previous jobs that she could carry into a teaching profession. Vector asked about discipline in the classroom. Keighly asked about her philosophy on homework and balancing practical application versus theoretical knowledge. Five pairs of heads continued to nod enthusiastically. Snape sat perfectly still, his black eyes intense, patiently bidding his time. Hermione dreaded what awaited her. </p><p>Flitwick asked what she thought her greatest weakness and how she could improve upon it. At this question Hermione hesitated and caught Snape’s sardonic gaze. </p><p>“I…I think, I <em>know,</em> that I am too quick to think I know all the answers,” she stared hard at the table, concentrating. “I do struggle with having a prideful attitude and it has proven to be detrimental at times. I…I need to…learn how to carefully listen to others and not be so sure I have all the answers. As for working on that as a teacher, I want to make sure that the students know I have an open mind and can critically think about and accept other perspectives and ways of solving problems.”</p><p>Looking up she saw Flitwick scribbling something on a piece of parchment, nodding. McGonagall gave her a slight nod, trying to maintain an impartial face, but the crows feet wrinkles around her eyes indicated a smile was just below the surface. Hermione didn’t dare look at Snape, but she couldn’t resist for long.</p><p>“Ms. Granger,” he began, the syllables slowly easing out from his mouth. She reluctantly dragged her eyes from McGonagall’s to his. “According to your N.E.W.T. scores you <em>only</em> got Exceeds Expectations in Herbology,” he sneered. “Do you think it wise to be in charge of potions and teaching others about it when your understanding of the plants you’ll need to use as ingredients is rudimentary?”</p><p>Hermione blanched.</p><p>“I hardly think Exceeds Expectations constitutes as rudimentary, Severus!” McGonagall’s voice was sharp.</p><p>“Anything less than outstanding, then.”</p><p>Professor Vector cleared her throat, very deliberately, but kept her eyes on Hermione. This seemed to quiet Snape and Hermione silently thanked the witch.</p><p>“Ms. Granger received Outstandings on all her other exams, I hardly think having one Exceeds Expectation should deter her,” McGonagall turned to her right looking Snape up and down. He kept his eyes glued to Hermione.</p><p>“Ms. Granger demonstrated proficiency in my class,” Sprout added, learning over the table to look down at him. “I am actually quite surprised she didn’t receive an Outstanding.”</p><p>“Then let…her…………prove <em>it</em>,” Snape spoke excruciatingly slow. His eyes pierced hers with such intensity that Hermione found she couldn’t look away from him. She felt her pulse throbbing through her body.</p><p>“What do you get mixing an infusion of wormwood with powdered root of asphodel?”</p><p>“-Living Death.”</p><p>“Should you cut or crush the Sopophorous bean in the Draught of Living Death?”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at him, gritting her teeth. “<em>Crush</em>,” she said resentfully, remembering how the Advanced Potions textbook directed students to cut the bean, but that Snape’s “Half-Blood Prince” copy had corrected it to crush to work more effectively. His lips quirked into a smirk.</p><p>“What is the result of mixing fluxweed <em>leaves </em>instead of its seeds with asphodel and mistletoe berries?”</p><p>“It makes a poisonous gas.”</p><p>His questions sped up, almost rapid fire as she aimed to answer them all just as quickly.</p><p>“And what do you need for a Draught of Peace?”</p><p>“-Powdered Moonstone, Hellebore syrup, powered porcupine quills, and powdered unicorn horn.”</p><p>“And the ingredients of a Memory Potion?”</p><p>“-Jobberknoll feathers”</p><p> “What are the effects of an Emerald Potion?”</p><p>“-Extreme thirst and pain, fear and delirium that results in angry outbursts.”</p><p>“What can one use knotgrass for?”</p><p>“-Polyjuice potion”</p><p>“Anything else?”</p><p>Hermione paused for a second. “To…help fertility.”</p><p>“For a temperament modifying potion, what color and smell should it have?”</p><p>“-A wintergreen color and it should smell like a fresh pine trees.”</p><p>“And what specific type of oil do you need for it?”</p><p>“-Lily oil. <em>Five</em> drops.” She added to her answer quickly, a spark in her eyes that challenged his. He cocked an eyebrow at her.</p><p>“How long does Veritaserum need to brew for?”</p><p>“-A lunar cycle.”</p><p>“And its color and smell?”</p><p>“-Clear and odorless.”</p><p>“A bezoar that cures poisoning must come from the stomach of what mammal?”</p><p>“-A goat.”</p><p>“What is a good healing herb to use?”</p><p>“-Dittany.”</p><p>“And, tell me, how should one use it effectively?”</p><p>“-By eating it whole.”</p><p>“What is Panacea?”</p><p>“-A supposed cure for all diseases”</p><p>“And the alchemists who worked on panacea used what ingredients?”</p><p>“-Salt, vinegar, Sal Ammoniac, urine, and Sulphur Vive.”</p><p>Snape stopped his questioning, folding his arms across his chest and sitting back in his chair. For a brief moment he actually looked pleased with her, before his expression returned to its concealed, guarded state.</p><p>The rest of the room swirled around them and came back into view. During his interrogation it had seemed like they were the only two in the room and Hermione had completely forgotten about everyone else. She inhaled slowly and pried her eyes away from his to glance at the other faculty members. Everyone sat gaping at her. McGonagall quickly collected herself, straightening in her chair, and gathering the parchments in front of her as she cleared her throat.</p><p>“Thank you, Ms. Granger, for that display of knowledge. I think that concludes our questions.” She looked down both sides of the table to verify.</p><p>“Thank you for this opportunity,” Hermione said softly, as she rose. She swept her eyes across the six faculty members, bowing her head. She left quickly, her heart racing.</p><p>“Well, obviously she’s perfect!” Keighly burst out the minute the door closed behind her, his brown eyes wide with amazement.</p><hr/><p>“Hermione? Are you home?” Hermione heard the voice coming from her fireplace in the next room. Hermione laid aside her book and moved to her parlor. It was Tuesday, four days since her faculty interview.</p><p>“I am,” she responded as she closed in on the fireplace. She saw McGonagall’s face forming.</p><p>“May I floo in?”</p><p>“Yes, of course.” Hermione stepped back, preparing to meet the headmistress. </p><p>McGonagall flooed in, stepping out of the fireplace, and wiping soot off her black robe.</p><p>“Would you like some tea?” Hermione offered, moving towards the kitchen.</p><p>“Oh, yes please!”</p><p>Hermione quickly brewed the tea, setting out milk and sugar, unsure of how McGonagall preferred to take it. She handed a spoon to the older woman and then grabbed yellow teacups and saucers from the cabinet.</p><p>“These are lovely,” McGonagall said, admiring the tea set.</p><p>“Thank you,” Hermione smiled. “They were a birthday present from Luna.”</p><p>“Oh, lovely Luna. Is she still traveling?”</p><p>“Yes, she’s keeping quite busy.”</p><p>Hermione joined McGonagall at the table, pouring the tea. They both sipped the hot drink for a few seconds. Hermione’s cup clinked against its saucer as she replaced it, looking at McGonagall expectantly. She felt calm.</p><p>“Well, my dear, the job is yours if you want it.”</p><p>Hermione burst into a huge grin, jumping up from the table abruptly and throwing her arms around McGonagall, catching the headmistress off guard.</p><p>“Oh my gosh! I’m sorry! I guess that’s not very appropriate now that you’re my boss!” Hermione’s face went crimson with embarrassment, her hands flying to cover her gaping mouth. “Please forgive me!” she cried out.</p><p>McGonagall only laughed. “Of course, of course.” She took a drink of her tea and swallowed, giving Hermione a curious look as the young woman returned to her seat.</p><p>“You do realize that Severus may always be looking over your shoulder? I will try to manage him, but you know…the man will always do what he wants.”</p><p>Hermione sighed. “Yes, I suppose he will. I will be fine. I’m not afraid of him.”</p><p>“No I daresay you handled his questions quite well. But afraid or not, he will most likely be frustrating to work with I suspect.”</p><p>The grin returned to Hermione’s face. “Well, good thing I’m stubborn.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p><strong>This song is my main inspiration for the story:</strong><br/> <em>It’s not your eyes, </em><em>It’s not what you say</em><br/> <em> It’s not your laughter that gives you away</em><br/> <em> You’re just lonely, you’ve been lonely, too long.</em><br/> <em> All your acting, Y</em><em>our thin disguise</em><br/> <em> All your perfectly delivered lies,</em><em>They don’t fool me</em><br/> <em> You’ve been lonely, too long.</em><br/> <em> Let me in the wall, you’ve built around</em><br/> <em> And we can light a match and burn it down</em><br/> <em> Let me hold your hand and dance ‘round and ‘round the flame</em><br/> <em> In front of us, </em><em>Dust to Dust.</em><br/> <em> You’ve held your head up, </em><em>You’ve fought the fight</em><br/> <em> You bear the scars, </em><em>You’ve done your time</em><br/> <em> Listen to me, </em><em>You’ve been lonely, too long.</em><br/> <em> You’re like a mirror, reflecting me</em><br/> <em> Takes one to know one, so take it from me</em><br/> <em> You’ve been lonely, too long</em><br/> <em> We’ve been lonely, too long.</em><br/> -<em><strong>Dust to Dust</strong></em> by The Civil Wars</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p><strong>A/N</strong>: This is my 1st fanfic story (that I’ve seriously pursued). I started it 3 weeks ago &amp; have been working on it daily. I have pieces of a lot of chapters already drafted. I’ve been doing a lot of research for it to make it plausible and work within JKR’s wonderfully crafted universe. I’m also trying to include some canonical elements (like dialogue &amp; some events). I don’t have a beta, if anyone wants to volunteer (for grammar, characterization, plot issues) let me know and we can chat. Sources Used:<br/> Pottermore essays<br/> Harry Potter wikia<br/> Harry Potter Lexicon canon essays (very interesting/useful)<br/> Legacy.hp-lexicon.org<br/> Harry Potter Books &amp; Movies<br/> Quote used in Trelawney’s prophecy is from the Prisoner of Azkaban<br/> For the 1st chapter I found the site <em>Hogwarts Is Here</em> for the RPG potions courses they offer extremely useful</p><p>
