    <p>In the Evans family, petunia is the odd one out . Evans are loyal to the last and don’t take shit from anyone. You don’t mess with an Evans or their offspring. Grandma is pissed.</p><p>Harry was neglected , abused, and sent into battle untrained and. Ill-equipped ( not counting Hermione) , Harry’s grandma is Alive and irate . The wizarding world has never Seen carnage on this scale. Grandma Evans is on the warpath, Alastair Moody is in love and Trying to figure out how to turn Voldemort into a quail.</p><p>Harry’s Grandma Evans comes back from a world tour and finds out what the world and Petunia has done to her grand baby. Hell hath no fury like an irate grandma.</p><p>For some reason I have a picture in my head of Grandma Evans being a retired Bobby( police officer).That was a Liaison for Scotland Yard to the wizarding world after Lily got her letter. Alastair Moody knew her his entire career and had a crush on the scary muggle copper. Grandma Evans takes on anyone who hurts her grand baby and Hermione idiolizes her.</p><p>Somehow I’m picturing a scene a off Grandma Evans beating Lucius Malfoy with her purse( that is filled with bricks) and Hermione watching them telling Grandma Evans the story of what she did to Umbridge with the Centaurs. Grandma Evans is so impressed she hugs Hermione and ask her What she thinks of concrete filled wiffleball bats.</p>
