    <p>Thunder roared as the rain came down in thick sheets, hammering on the castle’s draughty windows. Marvolo winced, he hoped the stained glass would not break, this was the worst storm he had seen in a very long time. Bad storms were not a good omen when you were awaiting the birth of a child. A scream ripped through the air, followed swiftly by another. He continued to pace outside the bedroom of his daughter, hands clasped behind his back. It was times like this he was glad that men did not have to carry the burden of bringing a child into the world.</p><p>Another scream and still the door remained firmly closed. His daughter, Merope, had been in labour for a while now. Longer than his wife had been with Merope, or his son, Morfin. He feared something was going, very, very wrong. He did not want to lose his daughter. He did not want to lose the child she was bringing into the world. He had been assured the child would be a boy by a local trusted Seer, and if that were true -. Marvolo sighed, feeling every bit his age. He was an old man, now. He needed this child to be a male heir, a granddaughter would be of no use at all.</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>The rain came down harder still as the night wore on. Lightning flashed across the sky. Morfin sat, slouched in a chair he had carved into a throne. If his sister had a son, he'd have to kill the little brat. He would not have his birth right taken from him, from some whore’s son! His father was a joke – a once ruthless King, the man had whipped up an army and marched into this Kingdom, the Kingdom of the Badger in his youth, declaring himself the rightful king. Marvolo had slaughtered entire villages; men, women and children had died in his father's desire to rule more than one Kingdom and now? Now the old man <em>negotiated</em>. The Lion Kingdom should have been theirs by now! Who would stop them? They were rulers of the Snake Kingdom, all that stood against them fell If his father could no longer stomach killing, then he should step aside and let someone who could rule.</p><p>The last Royal family had been killed without mercy, Marvolo had murdered them all, save the prettiest of the old King's daughter, whom he had forced into marriage and raped to acquire his children. Morfin had found his mother hanging from a rope, in his parent's bedroom when he was a small boy. She had taken her own life, rather than live and continue to play the happy wife of a killer. Morfin glared darkly, he had heard the rumours of what his father had done to those loyal to the old King. Of the babies, he had impaled on spikes, of the slaughter and rape of innocent women and his father had the nerve to wonder why his son was so screwed up?</p><p>It was no secret that Marvolo did not want Morfin to take the throne when he died, fearful that his son would screw up. That Morfin could not handle the pressure of ruling two kingdoms. That Morfin would lose the Kingdom of the Badgers. Morfin sneered, his army was strong, he could defend the Kingdoms. His father was a fool, gambling his throne on a brat from his <em>sister</em>.</p><p>As Morfin stood and began to pace his rooms, the church bells began to ring. He paused, listening intently. The people who had been waiting for news started to cheer. So, Merope had had a son. Too bad for her. It would be her first and last son.</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>Merope held her infant son tightly. He was healthy, at last. At last. She stared down at his innocent pink face, screwed up from crying and wanted to cry herself. He was perfect. She couldn't ask for more.</p><p>She glanced up when her father walked in and smiled, “Would you like to meet Thomas?” she asked, looking back down at the babe in her arms.</p><p>“Hullo,” said Marvolo, smiling down at the small child in his daughter's arms. “I thought for a moment you weren't going to make it,” he added, looking at his daughter closely. Merope looked exhausted but was smiling from ear to ear. The happiest smile he had ever seen on her face. Happier than the day he had given her, her first pony.</p><p>“Just a long labour,” Merope shrugged, tired.</p><p>“I'm sending you two home,” Marvolo informed his daughter, in a tone that brokered no arguments. “I need to know you're both safe and Morfin will know soon enough that you have a son,” Marvolo sighed, “The bells are already starting to ring.”</p><p>There was a tense pause between father and daughter. Both knew Morfin would hate a challenger to the throne and would stoop to killing his own nephew if he had too. Their stand-off ended when Thomas cried, his small face screwed up, demanding his mother's attention. Merope turned back to her son, running a soothing hand over his head, calming him with a gentle touch.</p><p>“For his sake,” she said softly, her soft brown eyes, locked on her child's.</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>The birth of a peasant child was always celebrated. Maybe not the extent that the Royals celebrated births, but they were celebrated all the same. Lily Potter could only laugh as her husband made more and more exuberant toasts in the local tavern. To her, to Harry, to anyone he clapped eyes on. James wasn't drunk, but he was sure well on his way to be wasted. Lily smiled tiredly, as Harry nursed from her. Times had been tough recently, for everyone. War was threatening to break out in the Kingdom of the Lions. Marvolo the evil Snake King was trying his damnedest to take over theirs.</p><p>James walked over to his wife and picked up his son, Harry yawned in his arms, turning his big green eyes on his dad. “Hey bud,” James looked excitedly up at Lily “We made him,” Harry was a week old and it still took James' breath away that he and Lily and made such a perfect little thing like Harry.</p><p>“I know, it's truly a miracle.” Lily smiled up her husband.  </p><p>The tavern doors bust open and Sirius Black stomped through them. The noise of the rain increased with the door open and Sirius slammed it shut. He was dripping wet, his normally well-groomed black locks coated with rain and dripping down his back. James waved enthusiastically, still holding a sleeping Harry in his arms. The baby opened one eye and gave a warning whimper. James stooped waving straight away. Sirius shook his head at his friend, amused and stomped over to them. The man was wrapped up in now rain drenched light fur and sweating profusely. He sat down heavily and shrugged out of them.</p><p>“How's the hunt been?” Lily asked. Sirius gave her a dark look.</p><p>“We keep getting hunters from the Snake Kingdom entering our forest because they are supposedly gathering enough food for Prince Thomas’ naming ceremony.” Sirius scoffed “Codswallop of course, they're scouting our lands, trying to find the Kingdoms weak points. We're spending more time chasing the shits out than actually hunting.” James placed a large tankard of Ale in front of his best friend.</p><p>“The sooner we're ordered the kill them the better,” James agreed darkly. James was a Knight in the King's Army and was frustrated that his King had repeatedly kept them from fighting the Snakes. Pleading patience and tolerance.</p><p>“If they interrupted one of the <em>King</em>'s hunting trips, maybe you'd get your chance to fight.” Lily suggested, taking Harry gently back from his father.</p><p>“Not even the Snakes are dumb enough to do that.” James sighed “Besides, they can’t risk anything that could be seen as a hostile action right now. Their new heir isn’t that much older than Harry.”</p><p>“Our only hope is they stay toeing the line and the new heir doesn’t grew up to become Marvolo 2.0.” Sirius drained his ale. No one needed another Marvolo at his peak evilness.</p><p>“If the rumours about the new heir not even being in the country are true, maybe we have a chance.” James stroked his son’s face. He could hope things would work out and that his son’s future was better than the current present. There was thoughtful silence at the table. Ever since the Prince was born a few months ago, rumours had filtered through then Kingdoms, suggesting that the Prince had been taken into hiding.</p><p>“At any rate, at least we know Prince Morfin will never be King.” The small group breathed a joint sigh of relief. Morfin was insane. A bad evil king was better than an insane one.</p><p>“Thank goodness for small mercies.” Lily gently kissed her son of the forehead. Lily and Merope may not have a lot in common, but they shared one thing in common – they would do anything for their sons.</p>
