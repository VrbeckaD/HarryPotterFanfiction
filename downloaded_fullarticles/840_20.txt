    <p>Queenie sank onto a sidewalk after failing to catch up to Newt and Jacob on the rainy Paris street. She rubbed at her eyes. When had she slept last? She had been unable to sleep more than a few hours on the steamer, trying to keep the no-majs from noticing Jacob's state.</p><p>Jacob. Oh, she had messed up so badly. She shouldn’t have put him under that spell. The way he looked at her, hate in his eyes, when he had shaken a finger at her and thought that she was crazy—he had never thought anything bad about her before. Whatever he’d said about not meaning it, she’d heard him loud and clear. It had been his first reaction, after all. He really thought she was unstable. </p><p>What if she was? Normal people didn’t do things like this. The way <em> Newt </em> had looked at her. She rubbed at her eyes again. If only she could sleep, maybe she would have a more clear perspective but the French no-majs were so <em> loud </em>. Their mental voices beat into her brain, pounding every inch of her mind. They weren't like Jacob, whose thoughts were relaxed and jovial. A bit insecure at times, but she'd never felt like she would drown there.</p><p>Those no-maj's practically yelled their stress as they hurried to their destination, made worse with her not even being sure who was friend or for because they thought in French. She couldn’t even hear herself think to reason if she was crazy or not. </p><p>As if things couldn't get worse, it began to rain. Queenie choked out a sob.</p><p>Then, out of nowhere from below, Queenie heard a new mental voice. In English! One she knew and loved.</p><p>
  <em> I have to find a way out of here! I have to get to Credence! </em>
</p><p>Wait… Was that Teenie? She sounded worn down. And what was that about finding a way out? Was Teen trapped somewhere? Queenie stood up, no longer thinking about her problems with Jacob or her sanity.</p><p>She had to help Teenie, if Tina was being held somewhere. It didn’t even matter if Teen hated her once she’d told her what she’d done to Jacob—her first priority had to be Tina’s safety. If Tina never wanted to see her again? Well, she may just have to resign herself to a new life without Tina or Jacob. She'd refused a 'no' once, she wouldn't again, even if it meant no forgiveness from Tina.</p><p>A life without Jacob or Teen. She shuddered. Unfortunately, it looked like that was her new reality. She probably hadn’t heard Jacob’s voice before she had sat down on the sidewalk. She must have just imagined it if she wasn’t stable. </p><p>Regardless, even if she wasn’t sane anymore, if fear of rejection after the article had came out, after Tina had left had snapped her sanity, that didn’t mean she wasn’t going to try and find a way to help Teenie. </p><p>She paused, though. What if Tina’s voice wasn’t real, just like Jacob’s probably wasn’t? She straightened. The only way to know if she’d really heard Tina would be to see if she could hear her thoughts again, to see if she could track Tina. It might give her answers on if she was nuts or not. Not to mention, if there was a chance Tina was in danger, she had to investigate. Ha, how strange. For the first time ever, she was the Goldstein with an investigation! What to do first? What would Tina do? Probably channel everything she had into her first goal-tracking.</p><p>First she had to find someplace quiet, where she could focus on her connection to Teenie, listen properly. Tracking thoughts over a long distance was hard enough, especially with all those loud voices. </p><p>“Excuse me, madam?” A brunette woman in green with a matching pointy hat and a wonderfully bright red lipstick spoke to her. “May I help you, madam?” </p><p>Queenie shook away the hand she was holding out.</p><p>“No… No thank you, I’ll be fine.” With that, Queenie disapparated to an attic in a no-maj house. Or at least, she assumed the owners were no-majs because there were no wards to stop her from doing so. The attic was filled with furniture twenty years old and was covered in dust. It also gave Queenie a good view of the street from it’s large windows. Queeenie flung open a few of the windows and flickered a sheet off an armchair, where she sat down. Queenie smiled and took off her damp coat, her soaked heels. Yes, this was a tranquil place to rejuvenate and maybe dry off a little bit, if dust didn’t make you cough. A cup of cocoa and changing out of this outfit would be lovely, but beggars can't be choosers and… She shuddered. If Tina was here, she had to find her before nightfall, or she may have to stay in this attic overnight. She wasn’t sure what her options were in the long term for getting home. She couldn’t hide out in this attic for long. If the owners heard noise, that would be the end of this hiding place. </p><p>Beyond the attic, for a place to stay?</p><p>Sbe couldn't exactly ask for a hotel room in French. How would she even get a ticket for a steamer back home when she couldn't read street signs? Oh, she’d been so stupid to leave Newt’s, even Jacob’s hateful glare and Newt’s judgemental gaze would be better than facing homelessness. Not that she didn’t deserve it, their hatred or being out on the streets, but...</p><p>Queenie laid her case down on the wooden floor, closing her eyes. Yes, it was much easier to listen now that she had some <em> quiet </em>. Where had Tina's voice came from? She listened again. </p><p>… <em> What spell has he put on this door? </em>Aberto! Reducto!</p><p>Queenie’s heart skipped a beat. That <em> was </em> Teenie. She wasn’t completely crazy! And it had been <em> definitely </em> came from below the Earth, far below, so…. A sewer? She needed to find an entrance. Queenie grabbed her coat and case and disapparated again, scanning an empty alley until she found... Yes! A sewer entrance! She hurried over to it. Sighing, she aimed her wand at the sewer lid and it flew off. It was then that Queenie remembered that she had left her wine-colored heels behind. <em> Rabbits </em>! She had liked those shoes. Oh, well, she didn't have many dresses matching those shoes, anyway. She hated this whole outfit now and the mistake now associated with it. She would be fine with burning this dress, if she ever got back home. </p><p>Miniaturizing her case and pocketing it  so she didn’t have to carry it, Queenie stuck her rosewood wand between her teeth and descended into the sewers, her feet cold on the damp metal and her hands on the rusted and rough slick handles. The floor was wet and slimy when Queenie’s feet touched the ground. She girmanced and pulled her suitcase out again, restoring it to normal size. Nothing in here that Tina would call “adventure worthy.” Well, Queenie would <em> make </em> heels adventure worthy. She pulled out a pair of black heels and pulled them on. She shut her case, miniaturized it again and pocketed it and listened again. Queenie paused and listened again so she could know which way to go:</p><p>
  <em> Maybe I should sleep, keep my strength up. It’s not like I’ve got anything else to do and morning might bring new ideas for an escape. Worst comes to worst I can overpower Kama, hopefully without hurting him… </em>
</p><p>That was Tina! Queenie wasn’t mad, at least not completely! Hope spread it’s wings. Queenie hurried down down a tunnel that lead in the direction of Tina’s thoughts, which ranged from wondering how Queenie was doing, if she was safe (Tina thought about her! She missed her!). Tina even bitterly pictured Newt in the arms of the beautiful Leta Lestrange, sulking. Credence remained in danger and she was stuck here in this smelly sewer hideout alone. </p><p>Though she wouldn’t be lonely long. </p><p>Queenie was on her way! Though if Tina would ever speak to her after what she’d heard about what she’d done to Jacob… High and mighty Tina who always knew what was best for everyone. Queenie probably be lucky to get a ride home, and for once, she would deserve it.  </p><p>Queenie continued to follow Tina’s thoughts as they grew louder. It was a comfort to know they were as depressed as hers, in many ways. She even worried about if Queenie was in jail (why did no one understand that she just wanted a family? To feel loved and secure like everyone else? To never be left alone or have to hide) then TIna’s thoughts bounced to Newt again, whether or not she’d have a job when she got back after running to Paris to look for Credence, Credence, Newt again… It went on and on until Queenie felt as though she was being screamed at. Finally, Queenie sensed Tina’s presence was nearby, but she wasn’t sure where to look-</p><p>“TEEN?” She yelled. “Teenie I’m here!”</p><p>Tina’s thoughts stopped, then grew confused, hopeful-</p><p>“Queenie?” <em> I must be losing my mind, Queenie is at home.  </em></p><p>“You’re not crazy, Teenie, it’s me, I’m here to rescue you! Do you where you are?” She kept her voice loud, even higher than when she’d talked to that unhelpful rude French receptionist at the French Ministry. </p><p>“I’m at—<em> how </em> did you find me? Why aren’t you in New York? Is Jacob with you--” </p><p>Queenie’s heart felt as though it were being flattened by a rolling pin. Jacob. There truly was only one man with a heart has giving and kind as him. She’d taken advantage of his trust and used magic against him. Now, he thought she was crazy and never wanted to see him again. </p><p>She didn’t want to think about that, let alone talk about it. </p><p>“No, he ain’t here, it’s just me, Teenie.” </p><p>Worry spiked in Tina. </p><p>“Why isn’t Jacob with you? Why?—”</p><p>“Enough with the questions and let me save you!” Less than a second later, Queenie felt guilty for snapping at Tina. Tina had kisses her bruises and taken care of her when she’d been sick like a parent would when she’d just been a kid herself. She didn’t deserve to be yelled at because Queenie felt ashamed of herself. She was glad no one could see her flush of shame in the dark sewer. “I’m sorry, Teenie… I’m standing in a fork in between three tunnels. This man who put you here, Kama, do you know which path he took?”</p><p>“It was the center.”</p><p><em> Of course </em> Tina remembered a good deal of the path here! She was reliable. Queenie felt a flash of pride—and it was then that she realized she’d missed Tina. Queenie hurried down the center path, where she saw a hand sticking out of some bars, waving at her. </p><p>“Teenie!” As Queenie hurried to her sister, she remembered the questions Tina had asked about Jacob. Should she expect a night on the streets, after she told Tina what she had done? </p><p>But those questions fled from her mind as she came face to face with Tina on the other side of the bars. Tina had a small smile on her face that widened when she saw her sister and they linked hands.</p><p>“It’s good to see you,” Tina said. “Did you see Kama on your way here? How did you find this place? How long have you been planning to come to Paris?” <em> Where is Jacob? Why isn’t she in New York? Why doe she look like she’s been out in the rain? Hm, alone and no Jacob. Did they fight? And rain–that means no shelter— </em></p><p>“Queenie did something happen between you and Jacob? Do you have anywhere to stay?” She tugged Queenie closer so that she could pull her in tightly for a hug. A hard job, given that she was behind bars. The action was so tender that Queenie found a lump in her throat. She found that she couldn’t speak and tears welled in her eyes. </p><p>“Why are you sounding so worried? Shouldn’t you be h-happy Jacob and I fought? That’s what you wanted, ain’t it, Teen?” She could feel the bitterness spiking. She broke away from Tina. She gripped the bars in her frustration. “Me miserable?”</p><p>Tina’s face fell. “Is that what you think? That I want you to be unhappy? Queenie that couldn’t be farther from the truth.” Tina squeezed her arm gently. </p><p>“How did you even get down here?” Queenie asked. </p><p>Tina’s mind was blank, other than a flash of a dark-skinned French wizard. Ah, Occlumency. “I will tell you once you tell me what happened between you and Jacob. I <em> do </em> care, despite what you think. You’re my sister! You’re hurting! You look as though you were out in the rain recently and I don’t see Jacob anywhere. I want to help.” </p><p>Dread welled up in Queenie and she felt more tears coming. She took a step back, shaking her head. She couldn’t say it. Maybe she was a coward, but she didn’t want to see the hatred that would flash across Tina’s face, or a look of judgement like Newt had given her. </p><p>“It’s okay, you can tell me,” Tina said gently. “No matter how bad the fight was, we can fix it Queenie. I know I wasn’t supportive enough now—but I’ll help you win him back, if that’s what it takes to prove to you that I’m—” She stopped. Paled even worse than when she had lost her job. Her hands left the bars, covered her mouth. “Mercy Lewis—Is it MACUSA? Are you on the run? Did they find out? Are you here because they Obliviated Jacob?”</p><p>Oh Morrigan, in some ways that would have been a better story to tell Tina. </p><p>She looked down. She had to tell the truth. Tina was coming to worse conclusions, and letting Tina worry because she was ashamed wasn’t right. She shook her head. Tina looked puzzled, apparently out of theories. She stared at Queenie, and she could feel the worry swelling as high as a skyscraper. </p><p>“What is so bad that you can’t tell me?” Tina said softly, more worried about Queenie that this point than the fact that she was imprisoned herself. It was so very Tina like that Queenie felt comforted. The worry wafted off Tina, the emotions stronger than the smell of the stink nearby in the sewers. Tears swarmed Tina’s eyes. </p><p>“Jacob isn’t here, Tina,” Queenie said quietly, clasping her hands. She gripped them tightly. She took another step back and noticed that she was dangerously close to stepping into the sewer. The water smelled like trash and feces. She stopped, about ready to gag. She kept her gaze on the stone floor. “Because I put him under a love spell and brought him to England against his will.” </p><p>
  <em> No! How could she? But it makes sense and oh, I would expect so much— </em>
</p><p>Then Tina said words that were worse than shouting. Her voice was filled with melancholy. Disappointment. </p><p>“I raised you to treat people with kindness and respect, from strangers to family. Why did you do something so despicable to the man you love? The man who has done nothing but accept you and make you happy?” Tina sat down on her side of the bars and motioned for Queenie to do so as well. She sat opposite Tina. Queenie still felt the need to explain further, to make sure that Tina understood. So she sat, relieved at least that Tina wasn’t shooing her away, but seemed to realize that this would be a long story.  </p><p>“I-I didn’t plan it Teen,” Queenie said, supposing that maybe she should explain better to Tina that she’d done to Jacob. “It happened<em> — </em>” She took a deep breath. “It was just something that happened on the spur of the moment, one of those things you don’t think about. You’d left and Jacob and I’s relationship could end at any second if MACUSA found out. I was afraid I’d have no one and—” she couldn’t speak and she felt Tina squeezing her hand “—I just wanted to be loved, and I thought once we got to UK, I’d… Well, I don’t think I thought about it that in-depth, but I thought he’d be willing to marry after I took the spell off when we got there I guess.”</p><p>“I put him under the spell, packed our bags, Confunded the ticket man when he wasn’t looking to think we had tickets… And it was done.” Queenie’s throat seemed to close up. She buried her head in her hands, jerking away from Tina,  too ashamed to look at Tina anymore. Tina never would have done something so low. “You don’t have to lecture me, Teenie, I know it was wrong. He was right next to me, but he didn’t feel like Jacob at all, you know. And now I’ve ruined it all! He’ll never speak to me again!” She broke off. She was reminded of when she’d been ten and their grandfather had died how she’d not been able to stopping crying, to the point where she could not speak. This kind of crying like that. </p><p>Tina gently reached over and rubbed her hand. </p><p>“Well, I’m glad you know it was wrong,” Tina said. “Saves my voice.” </p><p>She stopped crying completely and found she could laugh along with Tina. </p><p>“I don’t know what to do,” Queenie began to wipe the tears off her salty face. Her makeup had to be ruined. “I’ve lost Jacob forever, Teen.” </p><p>“I’m sure that’s not true,” Tina said, still calm and strangely motherly for the one who’d always been the breadwinner of the two of them. She stood up and brushed herself off. Queenie followed her lead. Tina passed her a handkerchief. “I’m sure you can win Jacob back, if you offer him a sincere apology and make an effort to show you won’t do it again. Where is Jacob? That’s the first thing you have to figure out<em> — </em>”</p><p>The answer to that question filled Queenie with excitement as she remembered where she had left Jacob. “Teenie! He’s with Newt! An’ guess what? He ain’t engaged! The newspaper messed up the names, it’s his brother marryin’ that Lestrange woman, not Newt!” Queenie leaned forward a little, beaming. “He was so disappointed you weren’t with us, Teen! I think he wants you back!”</p><p>A smile crossed Tina’s face. “You mean that? Truly?”</p><p>“Really,” Queenie assured her sister, grinning at her. She clasped hands with Tina. They were warm despite the damp dungeon, touching Tina’s hands was like warming herself next to their large fireplace back in New York. </p><p>Tina downright <em> glowed </em>. People often said because of her blond hair that Queenie looked like an angel, but Tina, Queenie knew, was truly the angelic sister, inside and out. Queenie had a feeling this was the happiest her sister had been since they had read that article. She had a chance with Newt, Queenie was here—a spike of nerves rose in Tina. But did she have her sister back?</p><p>“Queenie, I’m so sorry if my concern for your safety made it seem like I care don’t care about <em> you </em>. You’re my sister. Of course I love you. Here’s the plan. We’re going to get out of here, we’ll stop Kama because we can’t allow him to harm Credence, and before I go back to searching to Credence, I’m going to help you fix things with Jacob—”</p><p>“And maybe fix things with Newt.” There was a teasing tone to Queenie’s voice and she wiggled her eyebrows at Tina. “I hear you thinking about him a lot, you know.”</p><p>“Maybe I will.” Tina agreed coyly, not denying it. The corners of her mouth turned up. “But as I said, I”m going to help you fix things with Jacob, we just need to get out of here—”</p><p>Technically, <em> she </em> just needed to get <em> Teen </em> out, but she loved that Tina knew she was in this with her. Because she was not leaving her sister in a smelly sewer alone, even if she <em> could </em> leave. </p><p>Something broke Tina off, and her eyes widened as she said “look out!” An arm appeared out of nowhere, Queenie’s was wand ripped out of her hand, she was pulled to her feet, the door shoved open, her captor flung her inside with Tina and her wand was flung back at her again, and then the door slammed shut again. </p><p>As she turned around, Queenie found herself face to face with the man that she’d seen in Tina’s mind, who called himself Kama, who wanted to harm Credence. </p><p>And the whole story seemed to seep out of Kama’s brain, like cream from a freshly bitten into pastry–there was no stopping it, overflowing. </p><p>Queenie’s mouth parted in sympathy as she stared at Kama, who stared back at her with an equal look of sympathy. </p><p>“I am sorry, miss, but I can’t have you saving the Auror. I have to kill Corvus Lestrange and she would stop me! I will release you both when he is dead!”</p><p>With that, Kama fled the sewers. Queenie stood there, Kama’s thoughts, in many ways, where just as overwhelming as the ones from the streets in Paris. Her fingers drifted to her temples. </p><p>“Are you all right?” Tina asked, picking up on her change in mood. She walked over and placed a hand on Queenie’s arm. </p><p>“His pa,” Queenie breathed. “He forced him to make an Unbreakable Vow, Teen. That’s what he said, why he has to kill Credence—he thinks he’s this Lestrange person.”</p><p>“Then we just have to prove that Credence isn’t Corvus Lestrange as soon as we get out of here.”</p><p>Everything hinged on escape. Queenie laughed. She also shivered. That was a lot of pressure. Credence’s life hinged on them breaking out. Fortunately, Queenie knew Tina could free them. It was Tina, after all. Queenie spun around to look at her sister. </p><p>“I came here to save you and all I did was get myself stuck here, too!” </p><p>They both laughed. Tina walked over and took off Queenie’s wet dark-pink coat. Tina took off her trench coat and wrapped it around Queenie’s shoulders before she pulled Queenie close for a hug. </p><p>“I’m so sorry you thought I didn’t love you,” Tina said, rubbing Queenie’s back. “You’ve been indispensable to my success, Queenie. Always. There’s nothing I couldn’t have done without you. I love you so much.” </p><p>Tears leaked out of Queenie’s eyes at all the love packed into Tina’s gentle squeeze. Queenie wrapped her arms around Tina as well, stroking her hair.  </p><p>“I promise I’ll find a way to help you win back Jacob,” Tina said again as they broke apart. “Like I said, what you did was pretty awful, but Jacob is an incredibly kind person. As long as you mean your apology—”</p><p>“I do, Teen!”</p><p>“Then you should have no trouble offering an honest apology and backing it up with sincere actions to show you’re sorry,” Tina said, smoothing her sister’s hair. “Now let’s get out of here. Stopping Kama and proving Credence’s isn’t Corvus has to be our first priority.”</p><p>“Is it awful I feel sorry for Kama?” Queenie said as she looked around the hideout. It was chilly, damp, there was no sunlight, and he had no bed. The ways were lined with markings around the Lestrange family tree.  “He doesn’t want to hurt anyone Teen, that’s why he’s left us untouched, he just wants to be free.” </p><p>There was a longing tone in her voice. She understood what being trapped felt like far too easily after dodging MACUSA officials to be with Jacob. Poor man. The longing for freedom, to go and do as one pleased, Queenie understood that. </p><p>“I feel sorry for him as well,” Tina also looked around, expression grim. “I’m an Auror, after all, you learn to get a sense of a person quickly. Someone who <em> can </em> do harm but doesn’t… Kama feels trapped, but if he made an Unbreakable Vow I don’t know what we can do for him—” Tina sighed. “Let’s just focus on getting out of here.”</p><p>Queenie helped Tina search the place again for a way, but also found nothing. Kama had clearly thought through possible escape attempts. </p><p>“Can you use your Legilimency to see if there’s anyone nearby?” Tina asked. “Perhaps we could find a way to send a message. Kama did leave us our wands.” </p><p>Queenie sat down on the cold hard floor, feeling a bit sorrier him. And she thought her life was awful. Imagine having no one and living in a dirty sewer with the knowledge that you must kill or be killed. </p><p>And her life wasn’t as bad as she’d thought lately. She didn’t lack a family, not completely. She still had Tina. She wasn’t totally alone. If Jacob could just forgive her, she would be all right. </p><p>Ignoring the dirtiness, and smiling to herself Queenie closed her eyes. “You know the drill, Teenie, I need quiet so I can focus.” </p><p>“Of course.” Both Tina’s thoughts and words stopped, now Queenie could hear nothing but the sound of her breathing and dripping from the sewer. </p><p>Queenie tried as hard as she could, searching with her consciousness as much as she could both up and down and around for any human thoughts. </p><p>“We must be very far underground,” Queenie groaned. “I probably only heard you ‘cause it was you and you were in trouble—” Tina smiled a little and Queenie had to smile back “—but I can’t hear anyone from the street above. Sorry, Teenie.” She hung her head. She’d disappointed Tina twice in one day. </p><p>Tina hurried to sit next to her and wrapped an arm around her. </p><p>“You did the best you could, don’t worry,” Tina said, squeezing her shoulder. “We should get some rest. If Kama was decent enough to give us our wands, he’ll probably bring food eventually, maybe we can overpower him when he does.” </p><p>This seemed like a good idea. </p><p>“‘An’ if he don’t, I could always conjure something good from one of the no-maj restaurants and whip us up something to eat, Teenie.”</p><p>Tina smiled. “I’ve missed your cooking. You know I burn everything.” </p><p>They laughed. Queenie felt as though a tiny piece had healed in her heart. Tina had missed Queenie as much as she’d missed her! </p><p>“This may seem like an obvious solution, but have you tried apparating out?” Queenie tilted her head in curiosity.</p><p>“That was the first thing I tried,” Tina said. </p><p>Oh. Too bad. So much for hoping Kama had overlooked the obvious. </p><p>“Okay just wanted to be sure,” Queenie said. “Where are we sleeping, Teenie?”</p><p>Tina waved her wand and two fluffy blue bedrolls appeared. “The floor, unfortunately.” She placed a hand lightly on Queenie’s shoulder. “I wish I had better for us, but conjuring those from my apartment is the best I can do for now, sadly.”</p><p>
  <em> Queenie has been through so much lately. I’d give her a more comfortable bed if I could, but sleeping bags are better than the ground. I wish we had a real bed. Good sleep could do wonders for her.  </em>
</p><p>Yet Queenie had trouble falling asleep that night and it was not because the fluff of the sleeping bag didn’t compensate for the hard floor or the chill from the damp sewer or that she and Tina were sharing Tina’s coat as a pillow. Queenie rolled over to face Tina. </p><p>“Teen? Psst, Teenie!”</p><p>Tina rolled over to face her sister. “Yes, Queenie?” </p><p>Queenie paused. This was a rough question to ask, yet she couldn’t get Jacob’s words  out of her head. <em> “If I am a coward, then you are crazy!” </em> Maybe Tina could help her. If she asked someone else, maybe she wouldn’t feel so haunted by those words? Tina had been there for her so far since they’d got reunited. </p><p>“Teen, do you think I’m crazy?” She whispered the words, afraid to hear the answer. What if Tina agreed with Jacob? Queenie didn’t want to go to an institution, didn’t want to be locked away. </p><p>But what if that was best for everyone?</p><p>Tina’s face filed with empathy and she reached over and took Queenie’s hand. </p><p>“I—” Tina paused. Queenie couldn’t get a clear read on her mind, much like the minds in Paris but it wasn’t because it was crowded or because they were all thinking in French but because Tina seemed uncertain of how to voice her thoughts. Queenie felt as if her stomach had frozen to ice. What if Tina wanted to lock her away, like Jacob did? Queenie rolled away from Tina, and felt the tears rolling silently down her face. </p><p>“Hey,” Tina wrapped an arm around Queenie. “Let me talk, okay?” Tina sighed. “Look at me, Queenie.” Queenie rolled over to face her sister. Tina tugged Queenie’s bedroll over her shoulder, which had gotten kicked away when she had tossed and turned. “I think you’re under a lot of stress right now, and that you’re very unhappy and afraid and lonely, and that is driving you to consider things as a plausible solution that you wouldn’t normally. But that doesn’t mean you should be locked up or that you can’t ever be happy again. You just need some rest and proper attention, like anyone who is feeling a little blue.” Tina leaned forward and kissed her curls. </p><p>“Now get some sleep. I love you, Queenie.” Tina snuggled deeper into her sleeping bag and Queenie quickly felt Tina’s mind slip into unconsciousness, into dreams about Newt. </p><p>Queenie laid awake, listening to the <em> drip drip drip </em> of the sewers, jealous of her sister able to have a simple dream about Newt showing her an exotic creature. Meanwhile, Jacob might not want to see her again, and she would deserve it. </p>
