On 19 September 1979,a girl child is born in England named Hermione Carina Granger blissfully unaware of the apprehension in her parents minds.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Mr and Mrs. Granger knew that their Hermione was different from them.It was not in terms of how eidetic her memory was or how quickly she could finish reading her books.They themselves were dental students once,so they could relate to such abilities. </p><p>Instead ,it was in terms of the things that were happening around her.Like when her story book was torn accidentally ,the 3 year old threw a gigantic fit and suddenly the pages repaired themselves without leaving any trace of ever being torn.Or it could be when her mother discovered that the chocolate cookies were in Hermione‘s mouth instead of being locked away in the cupboard.</p><p>However the surprising thing was that her parents were not confused of their 3-year old daughter,they were just happy and terrified simultaneously .</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p> </p><p>5-year old Hermione was sitting on the dining table along with her parents for dinner with her nose in her book.For Grangers this was a regular occurrence. However the distress on their daughter’s face was completely new.</p><p>Belvina Granger frowned and asked her daughter,”Hermione dear, is there anything you want to share with us?”</p><p>Hermione broke out of her reverie and exclaimed,”Today,Serena pushed me down while climbing the swing.Instead of falling down,I suddenly started floating few inches above the ground.They all called me abnormal.Momma,am I abnormal?Her voice  breaking towards the end.</p><p>Belvina leveled her gaze at her husband as if asking for his permission.Rigel Granger just shrugged and coolly assured her that she was perfectly normal in their eyes and that they were proud of her.After saying that, he calmly left the table.</p><p>Hermione was placated after hearing her father’s words and witnessing her mother’s encouraging smile.She however, failed to see her mother’s hopeful eyes.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The Granger family was sitting in the posh drawing room with the now 8-year old Hermione going through her birthday presents which were floating around her.On unwrapping one of gifts she gasped after seeing the book"The Stars and the Celestial Bodies."She quickly submerged herself in the book.</p><p>Suddenly her eyes lit up and she exclaimed,"Father, here it is mentioned that Rigel is the brightest star in the constellation of Orion.My middle name Carina is the constellation containing Canopus,the 2nd brightest star.Why my middle name is after the 2nd brightest star and not after the 1st brightest star like you?Most of my classmates have middle names resembling their father's first name!</p><p>All the humour of Birthday celebration drained from her father's face and her mother's face was grimly set.After giving a slight node to her mother,her father leaves the room in distress.</p><p>She looked towards her mother in confusion and with vulnerability in her voice she asked,"Did I say something wrong ,mother?"</p><p>Her mother's face expression was resigned and she exclaimed"It is for your best to learn some harsh truths about our heritage.I think this will give you more time to prepare for your future."</p><p>"What truths ,mother?,"she asked.</p><p>Her mother explained her all about the wizarding world,the bloodlines,the prejudice,her accidental magic,the Burke family and how they were hiding in Muggle world.</p><p>Hermione's mind was in overdrive.Finally coming out of her shock she manages to say,"So,I am a witch and you are Belvina Bianca Burke,the squib pureblood disowned daughter of The Ancient and Noble House Of Burke."</p><p>"Yes,darling",her mother said with a wistful sigh.</p><p>"Ok",Hermione continues,"What was wrong with my question that caused father so much distress?"</p><p>"Hermione,your father is disowned and blasted off from his family tree due to being a squib.There's a binding vow in pureblood families which states that the name of the disowned person can never be used again in following generations.Your father wanted your middle name to be named after him.He tried but was unable to do so due to the binding vow."She explained.</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth to ask another question but is hushed by her mother justifying that her father requests Hermione's company in his study.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Rigel Orion Black was sitting in his study both anticipating and dreading this conversation with her daughter since she was born.He was putting off the conversation thinking that maybe Hermione was just showing weak bursts of magic which would cease soon like his had been.But they were getting stronger and stronger each day.He desperately wanted her daughter to be a witch so that she didn't share the same unfortunate fate as her father did.Thankfully she was a witch.</p><p>The once  Noble and Most Ancient House of Black was now in shambles and in need of new Magical blood to flourish again.</p><p>His mind then wandered off to unbidden thoughts Sirius's pranks and a chuckle left his mouth.Thinking of the sweet and obedient Regulus brought a smile to his face.But the shrieking voice of his mother Walburga which was still resonating in his head brought him back to his surroundings.</p><p> He was broken out of his silent muse by Hermione asking his permission to enter his study.He beckoned her to enter and sit in the chair across him.</p><p>"I hope you have understood the basic things about the wizarding world and your accidental magic from your mother,"intoned Rigel.</p><p>"Yes,father,"replied Hermione dutifully. </p><p>"Now listen carefully, I belong to the Noble and Ancient House Of Black.The pure-blood families like the Blacks simply removed Muggles and Squibs from their family trees. The Blacks place a great importance on blood purity, considering themselves akin to royalty in the wizarding world and disdaining Muggles, Squibs, blood traitors, and Muggle-borns. The family motto, which can be found on the family crest, is Toujours Pur, which means "Always Pure" in French. Many members took this phrase very seriously.</p><p>               I am the eldest child of Orion and Walburga Black.Since my childhood I was expected to take upon the role of Heir Black.I showcased some accidental bursts of magic in childhood but they were very weak.After some time I stopped have these weak bursts of magic as well.But my family strongly believed that I have learned to control my magic.So they prepared me for all the duties which are expected of Heir Black.I was treated with respect and honour.</p><p>               But this all changed on my 11th birthday when I didn't receive the Hogwarts letter.Everyone was disappointed.I was too.But my mother was incensed.Beatened me up and called me vile things.Called me disgrace to the Black name.Poured her anger even on my two younger brothers also who tried to placate her.</p><p>                Finally the day of my disownment ceremony came.I still remember Siri and Reggie crying.I begged my mother to stop the disownment ceremony but all my pleadings were ignored .I could see regret etched on my Grandparents and father's faces but they couldn't go against the magical vows."</p><p>Perplexed she questioned ,"Magical vows?"</p><p>Her father answered,"If a person is disowned, a spell called-'Oublier le déshonneur' is cast which means 'Forget the disgrace' in French.It causes the disowned person to be removed from his family and related families memories including everything related with the House," with a wistful sigh.</p><p>She gasped,"Why would they do that?It is barbaric."</p><p>"To remind the person of the shame and dishonour he/she has brought on such a noble family as this spell does not affects the disowned person's memory.It serves as a very agonising punishment.I remember each and every moment of time spent but my family and relatives remember no....thing of m..e.",his voice wavers towards the end.</p><p>"But can't we meet with them and tell them about the circumstances, they might open up to us father",she replied with determination and hopefullness. </p><p>"No,this goes against the magic vow.It hinders me to approach them and tell them the truth."He replied.</p><p>"Is there any way to prove them that we are Blacks?We shouldn't give up on our identity!I"She asked.</p><p>"There is only one way.Fear not daughter,they may have taken away my rights as Heir Black but you will be provided with your rights and your rightful place as Heiress Hermione Carina Black!",replied Rigel Orion Black full of determination.</p><p>Unknown to both of them,Belvina Bianca Burke smiled standing in the doorway of his study.</p><p>"Which is the only way, father?"asked Hermione curiously.</p><p>"Listen!There are many things to discuss and decisions to be made"he started explaining.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
