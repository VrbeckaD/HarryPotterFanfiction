  <span> Oh? You mean you’re re-reading your doctorate application for the 90th time? </span>

  <b>HJGranger</b>
  <span>: Also, Harry? He didn’t touch your bike. I think Draco took it for the afternoon. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: FFS! Ugh, alright I’ll brb. Gonna give him a call. Be better not have gotten a single scratch on her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>RDawg</b>
  <span>: Okay so get this! I was working this morning, right? Usual morning rush. Most of my usuals come in, things are flowing easy. Then this fucking douche walks in, like he fucking owns the place, and starts talking on his phone really loudly. A lot of the other customers start getting really upset and it’s just chaost right? So I look around the line of people at the cash, and tell this guy to cool his jets while he’s in the shop. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>RDawg</b>
  <span>: Well, that doesn’t go over well. He hangs up his phone, and basically stares at me the entire time he’s in line. It’s ridiculous! AND THEN! When he finally makes his order, I take the cup and it’s a fucking: Medium, SOY, half-caf Latte with WHIPPED CREAM. Explain to me the logic behind that one? OH and the milk had to be steamed to exactly 120 degrees. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>HJGranger</b>
  <span>: That’s….Excessive. So what happened then? </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>RDawg</b>
  <span>: ...Well. Nothing I guess. I was gonna tell him off or something, but the drink really threw me off so. I don’t know. Hopefully it was just a fluke and he never comes in again. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: Ron, I’m very excited for you and your new conquest but right now I have a blond I need to go murder.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: And of course, I don’t mean murder. Wouldn’t want you guys to be implicated…</span>

<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: The facts are, there’s a hot guy who’s started getting coffee on Ron’s shifts, and is flirting hard with him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: But our precious ginger is too oblivious to notice.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>

</p>

  <span>: Ooo, all caps. Looks like I hit a nerve. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>

  <span>: Harry, give Ronald some credit. Clearly he’s not oblivious.</span>

</p>

<p>
  <b>HJGranger</b>
  <span>: Usual wager? </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: Yup. Draco says he’s in for a few quid as well. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>HJGranger</b>
  <span>: Does he have any left after having to buy you a new bike?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: Technically he’s loaded, and technically we have a shared account now so… His money is my money? </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>HJGranger</b>
  <span>: Oh!? Did you guys finally take that step?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: Yup. Finally landed me a sugar daddy. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>RDawg</b>
  <span>: First of all: Gross. Second of all, okay so get this. Today Blaise comes in, and it’s the same thing as usual. He’s got the whole store in a tizzy, without even saying a fucking word. He just walks in and most of the shop can’t keep their eyes off him and that stupid, form fitting suit. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: Yes, we established you think he’s gorgeous. Go on. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>HJGranger</b>
  <span>: Wait wait. We have a name for him now? When did that happen?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: Likely someone at cash asked for his name to put on the cup? Makes sense if they’re all into him I guess? They’d all want to know more about him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>RDawg</b>
  <span>: GUYS PLEASE! I’M TRYING TO TELL THE STORY!</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: Oh sorry! We thought you were just recapping the things we already knew. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>RDawg</b>
  <span>: SHUT IT HARRY. God! ANYWAY. So he comes in, orders his coffee, flirts with Todd at the cash.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: Oooo. So confirmed gay! Or bisexual at the least. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>RDawg</b>
  <span>: SHUT IT HARRY. So Todd takes his order and passes me the cup, but I’m ignoring Blaise at this point because I’m talking up one of my regulars. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>RDawg</b>
  <span>: So I make his stupid coffee anyway, and pass it too him, still ignoring him.  AND THEN THE FUCKER COMES BACK FIVE MINUTES LATER AND HANDS THE CUP BACK TO ME SAYING IT WASN’T RIGHT. AND THEN I LOOK AT THE CUP AND IT’S GOT HIS FUCKING NUMBER ON IT. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: WHAT?! Why didn’t you lead with that?!?! He is totally into you holy shit, get it Ron!!</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>RDawg</b>
  <span>: What no?? He’s just a jerk. LIKE WHO IS THIS GUY ANYWAYS?? How dare he come into my space and jerk up the place like he owns it and just ASDKFJLSJ!!!</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: Is a Jerk Up anything like a Jerk off?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>HJGranger</b>
  <span>: Gross. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>RDawg</b>
  <span>: Why… Why do I even bother talking to you two? </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: Because we’re your friends?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>

<p>
  <b>HJGranger</b>

</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>

  <span>: Well I guess you and your eyes aren’t interested to know what I found out about Mr Blaise. </span>
</p>

<p>
  <b>RDawg</b>
  <span>: No. No! Tell me ‘Mione!! TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>HJGranger</b>
  <span>: Well I don’t know. Maybe I shouldn’t tell you after all, since you’re being so mean. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>RDawg</b>
  <span>: Hermione please…. I really need to know!! Please tell me!</span>

<p>
  <b>HJGranger</b>
  <span>: It’s not what you think Ron. I only found out after the second time he came into your shop. I started looking into him and that’s when I figured out the connection. In fact, if you recall, I was going to tell you but then you decided to sass me and I felt no sympathy for you then. </span>
</p>

  <span>: You both are so cruel. I don’t know why I put up with either of you.</span>

<p>
  <b>HJGranger</b>
  <span>: Because you don’t know anyone else, or bother to make other friends?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>TheGoldenSwitch</b>
  <span>: Because you’re the best man at my wedding?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>HJGranger</b>
